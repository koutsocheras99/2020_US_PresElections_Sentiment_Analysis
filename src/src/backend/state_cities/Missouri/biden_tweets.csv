And Biden was raping little girls while it happened.
The point is if Biden is elected his VP pick will be President in months when they declare him ill with senile Dementia and unable to perform the duties of POTUS. Do you want a man with dementia to carry the nuclear strike briefcase and codes?
Because like you said it's the extremist. You have Beto saying he would take your weapons of war and Trump saying there won't be guns if Biden wins. It's all scare tactics to get votes.
Biden‚Äôs first edict after elected will be to not investigate Trump and his regime in an effort to ‚Äúavoid dividing the country over the mistakes of the past‚Äù or some political BS like that.
Trump is bringing Russia to a China fight. I like our chances, Biden for the win.
It sounds as though you may have voted in a primary in state #1. It‚Äôs not possible that you would have already voted in the Nov election since neither Trump nor Biden have officially been nominated. You should be fine to register and vote in state #2.
BIDEN ABOUT 50 YRS OF PUBLIC SERVICE NO ACCOMPLISHMENTS, A RACIST VOTED WITH KLU KLUX KLAN SO CHILDREN WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL WITH BLACKS.  ABOUT 80 YRS OLD, BRAIN SURGERIES, POLL EVEN DEMOCRAT SHOWS DEMENTIA.  CAMPAIGN HIDING HIM IN BASEMENT.  CORRUPT

üî¥ LIVE PODCAST: Joe Biden....Please just shut up!! on  #joebiden
Do who have any evidence at all that anyone is going to vote for him? Who are the people that we assume are stupid enough to do this? Seems potential Trump supporters are more likely than Biden supporters.
So obv you‚Äôre an idiot but I‚Äôll engage. 1. Will never impact you (no 1 is proposing forced abortions for you) 2. Is made up Trumpian fantasy that all the ppl Biden beat are somehow now his puppet masters. Joe has been a mainstream Dem his whole career who shifts w party &amp; country
Joe Biden is not progressive leaning.
your ad demeans joe Biden‚Äôs faith a lifelong Catholic; u accuse him of being ‚Äúagainst God‚Äù and wanting to ‚Äúhurt God‚Äù. Sir, I assure that the Catholic faith is not against God nor in favor of hurting him. This is your most dispicable and hurtful utterance yet.
Biden Vows To Never Stop Fighting For Black Community After Questionable Remarks On Diversity
I'm not sure what Biden could possibly do to loose my suport, especially considering most anything the right comes up with is complete bullshit. The same applies to Russia propoganda.
I can't wait to vote for Joe Biden!
You really think so? Dude isn‚Äôt okay in the head. Neither is Trump of course... I don‚Äôt think competence is what Biden will bring personally... maybe his cabinet will at least be okay?
The "Hill" is a pile of BS, and we all know it! Just like Joe Biden claiming he's a devote Catholic.  Right!
Biden should call upon our allies with the ability to do so,  to shut down foreign interference since Trump is currently not willing to
The current president abandoned the black vote months ago and started dog whistling to the Klan about heritage and history of slave owners and this guy is focused on a Biden slip up.
baby boy, is trashing Biden, when at least he can pronounce Thailand and Yosemite. Grow up donny boy, you are a jackass.
Yeah, I‚Äôm sure these folks can‚Äôt wait to vote for Biden. üôÑ

BIDEN WAS NEVER WORTHY OF THE BLACK VOTE, ALL OF HIS 50 YEAR CAREER A RACIST.  VOTED AGAINST MINORITIES WITH  KLU KLUX KLAN LEADERS.  GAVE THE EULOGY AT SENATOR ROBERT BYRD'S FUNERAL.  DEMOCRAT PARTY IS PARTY OF LYNCHING NEGROS.  REPUBLICANS FREED SLAVES.
I‚Äôve said it before and I‚Äôll say it again, Stone...  If Biden chooses Kamala he will win in a LANDSLIDE.üëç
Even Rasmussen has Biden up by 3.
Donald Trump -- DONALD TRUMP (you know, the pathological liar with all the extramarital affairs) -- is questioning Joe Biden's faith.
Why Joe Biden Keeps Missing His Own V.P. Deadlines  It's not inconceivable that he would pick a woman that satisfies none of the various Democratic constituent groups but one only he relates to.
Pretty sure Biden doesn't need the Russians to make a complete fool of himself almost daily at this point. Race to the bottom this election.
This is bullshit! Biden is not seriously considering Karen Bass for VP. Someone submitted her name so he has to go through the motions because she is a black female. It was probably the Trump Campaign that secretly submitted her name in the first place.
BIDEN ABOUT 80 YRS OLD, HAS NORWEGIAN DEMENTIA PSYCHIATRIST CLAIM.  DIAGNOSED WITH ANEURYSM, HAD BRAIN SURGERIES.  PRIMARY RIGGED EXIT POLLS SHOWS FRAUD.  RACIST BIDEN SAID LATINOS ARE DIVERSE &amp; BLACKS ARE NOT.  DEMOCRATS WANT THIS RACIST MAN TO BE PRESIDENT
My contribution to the "Is the Race Tightening?" debate. Here's a 30 day moving avg using top quality nat'l polls (538 B or better grade). Biden's lead has shrunk by ~1% since it peaked in early July, but his margin's stabilized a couple points above early June with Biden at ~51%
Whew! That eliminates a lot of pressure!
Bernie was a likely lock until candidates dropped out and supported biden.  You cant predict that with polling
WASHINGTON (AP) - US intelligence says Russia is using a range of measures to denigrate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.
No matter how you spin what Biden says, it will never be as bad as what spews from Trumps mouth all day, every day
I had a dream last night that Biden picked  as his VP. Will this dream come true..? üëÄ
Joe Biden is a shity father ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Well being a Past Democrat I don't see how voting for a Person that outright dislikes Blacks like Biden does is a better choice. Not to mention looking at these Democrat run cities that now look like 3rd World Countries. Not 1 Democrat voted for a Tax break for workers NOT ONE!
on CNN, you said you didn't think the LA party goers on the news lately were Republicans... Why is that? Because they were primarily Black? Because there was gunfire? Odd that Biden is being demonized for saying what I think you just said
Amid reports Republican and Trump-affiliated operatives are trying to get Kanye West onto various state ballots for November‚Äôs presidential election, Kanye admits he isn't really running to be president for real. It's solely to siphon votes from Biden.

Maybe Biden will come out of his basement.
What's funny is there's no way the reporter can follow up to allow Biden to clarify, because they are terrified he would make it even worse.   And no reporter wants to get the blame for torpedoing Biden's chances.
Joe Biden is such a joke üòÇüòÇ
Biden has stood on numerous stages in the past year and debated a massive Democratic field.  Every single candidate makes mistakes. You can pour through hours of video and find ANYBODY getting lost in a thought or phrase or, god forbid, pausing to formulate a thought.
Have the media never seen  talk before? The thing that Biden has ALWAYS been is an off-the-cuff, extemporaneous speaker who sometimes doesn't say the "right" thing.  So no, it's not cognitive decline   et al. That's just Biden.
Trump got "black vote" trending knowing that liberals would say some racist shit in response to turn off black voters  Great play. If he actually was smart like that instead of pretending Biden is some sort of secret grandpa antifa agent he wouldnt be getting destroyed üòÇ
I am speechless...come on Joe. And yes this election 'Bout to be Long AF.
I‚Äôm not trying to argue with you, I just think that leftists who decide not to vote for Biden or use their deep red/blue state status to make a point aren‚Äôt ignorant or hateful the way you‚Äôre saying. Most of the people I‚Äôve talked to have weighed the decision carefully.
Yeah you don‚Äôt want Biden to take away your being black card
Biden is a staunch supporter did abortion, therefore, he is not a ‚Äúdevout Catholic‚Äù. Saying he is a devout Catholic is like saying a member of ISIS is a devout Muslim
On that same note, Biden has championed a LOT of disgusting legislation and is in general a shitty person, so others could take that farther and say that supporting him in any way is to align with fascists
Today, on Unintended Consequence Theater, Petulant Man-baby and High King Dumbass  makes a mortal enemy of every single e-sports player and fan in the US.  To win the 18-35 demographic, Biden need only promise to ease off of Tencent.
Hell No - Biden is an old Senate guy he is not killing the filibuster.
Mr Cooper, if VP Biden takes corporate tax rates back to the non-competitive levels of pre-Trump that is going to slow the economy.
Last updated in 2018, there are between 699,000 and 800,000 DACA recipients. If returned to their birth country they would still be alive. Nearly the same amount of children aborted in the US yearly. But  appears to be telling us Biden is the lesser of two evils?

History is rewritten in real time.  Biden was always predicted to win SC, with or without Clyburn‚Äôs endorsement.  It is obama‚Äôs dishonest narrative that Clyburn turner the Super Tuesday black vote to Biden.  Loyal Bernie supporters were not suddenly convinced that Bernie     1+

Dude, I‚Äôm. Going for Biden and I agree with you totally!
And I am not a bot. I'm just someone that wants people to be educated and informed about the candidates, and it takes more than just my word. It takes research on everyone's part, we all have to know the candidates as best we can. Biden is just the better man for the job
Dear President Biden. Do not under any circumstance, pardon Donald Trump. Signed Karma
replacing red trump with a blue trump seriously risks ensuring we end up with something *worse* than trump in 2024.  Four years of no meaningful progress and president biden insulting people the way he does will erase the memory of Trump enough for R's to refurbish themselves.
The issue at hand is, who is better for the country to get us out of the crises we're in. At this point, Trump has proven himself incapable of taking control or even seeing that there are crises. Biden is the obvious choice because at least he has a plan and he acknowledges 2/
Especially when we actually know the Candidate FOR THE Democrats is in know way fit to be President &amp; the Majority of both Parties know it. Even Mail in Ballots as (crooked as they are) Could not help Biden.
Dems: Biden and Pelosi are devout Catholics, Trump is a heathen! Orange man bad!  Also Dems: *support abortion up to and even after birth*
No, Biden did not say that. He actually said if Trump is prosecuted for anything he won‚Äôt interfere. Tweet reported for posting bald-face lie about a presidential candidate.
Anything other than a reluctant vote for Biden is a vote for Trump unfortunately
Thank you!!!
It's uncool--"moderate" even--of me to agree with this, but he's right. I will add a caveat: there will be legitimate criticism from smart people against any pick, just as there has been legitimate criticism against Biden...
Its not to sell music it is to take votes from Biden for Trump
Joe Biden is still in the lab, putting the final touches on the vice presidential candidate.
Were you paying attention during the Clarence Thomas hearings?  The way Biden treated Thomas was dispicable.
Biden for 2020. He won't gas your grandma.
Now replace Joe Biden with Donald Trump
Plenty of Catholics support/have supported abortion in the past. Church teaching said a fetus didn‚Äôt have a soul until the ‚Äùquickening.‚Äù Anyway, we aren‚Äôt a Catholic nation, so even if Biden‚Äôs personal faith is against it, he shouldn‚Äôt push his faith‚Äôs doctrine on the rest of us.
Can you tell your uncle and his daughterWife(which is really creepy the way he acts around her)to just give up? Resign? Walk away? Take McConnell, Pelosi, and Biden in tow and allow The USA to right itself, kick covid19s ass, and move on from this 4 year dark age nightmare?
Ask yourself if #HidenBiden is likely to do anything to roll back the regulatory state, or lower taxes, or appoint originalist judges, or work to secure the borders, or resist China's attempts to undermine our economy.  Biden has made his leftist intentions abundantly clear.
Oh shut up. These are Biden oatmeal brain concerns ONLY. What could possible be the excuse for cancelling these things when it‚Äôs 3 ppl: 2 candidates and a moderator? They literally could all be 60 feet apart!

Your desperation is showing. Nobody believes Joe Biden is a racist that is your area. You are the one that likes to put immigrants in a cage and  m√≥ck handicap people
And we knew he was a nut. But ppl upset about shit they already know. But yes Biden the man talkin bout the diversity that isn‚Äôt in the AFRICAN American community üòÇüòÇüòÇ hes the savior. The lesser of two evils
There is NO doubt that if Biden is elected, Millions of law abiding citizens will become legislated felons! It has already happened in several states. Nearly every Democrat candidate pledged to ban guns &amp; even strive to end the 2A! Nothing like making 1/3 of population criminals!
I did hold my nose and vote for him over  but I would have voted for any GOP nominee over Obama.  Just like you should vote for any GOP nominee over Biden.
Please see my above tweets. Regardless of whether it is Trump or Biden in the White House, eventually the Tax Acts that are active will expire. Eventually, new relief acts will have to be written just as they were by Obama, George W, and somewhat by Trump.
Trump campaign has nothing real on Biden so they have to make it up:
No but he‚Äôll refuse to answer it and he‚Äôll spew lies, propaganda and hate comments about Biden so fast nobody can keep up.
Don't forget energy. Trump: Biden is against energy  Fact Check: Biden lives in a house with electricity.
Maybe but trying to see what kind of hoops he can get Biden or Obama to jump through is classic Donald Trump behavior.
Dem leaning Public Policy Polling post Kansas primary survey: Donald Trump 50%, Joe Biden 43%. Undecided 7%. Trump carried Kansas by 20 points in 2016. 864 Kansas voters. Poll: 8/5-6. MOE 3.3%. #Kansasvoters #PublicPolicyPolling #Trump #Biden #KMBC
Right. He‚Äôs just testing to see if he can manipulate Biden.
Trump's debating is a force of bullshit. If I were Biden I would stipulate beforehand that Trump must discuss actual policy issues in a mature way or the debate is over.
Largest tax cut in American history", referring to the fact that the bills tax rates replace the much higher rates for 2013 that were provided for in the laws previously in effect. And this relief act was written during the recession. It doesn't matter if Biden gets elected 2/

Ummm hey Junior, Biden signed on for three debates in June.  You‚Äôre as full of shit as your Daddy is.  You make it very apparent that an asshole doesn‚Äôt far from the asshole tree.

Donald Trump is also a nightmare horror. It's incredible that not only is the only thing demd can offer against him now as bad as biden, but that bill clinton enticed him into running in the first place thinking he'd be an easy opponent
Not one ad have I seen of any Democrat backed group against Biden. Now to the other side. Countless backed Republican ads against the Coward. Why is this? THEY WANT AMERICA BACK. TRUMP HAS DESTROYED OUR COUNTRY.

This is by far the best vote Biden stance I've seen   I won't, but can't get mad at the reasoning here
Joe Biden has my VOTE.
I would argue that Biden would be worse on immigration, afterall the administration he took part in deported the most. Biden already said he wants to give police more funding. He's against #m4a, he's against Marijuana, he's against against #gnd.  I'm not voting for him.
And Biden will win Nov 3

You need to stop talking. Biden wants to hurt God?? First of all, that's a ridiculously stupid thing to say. Secondly, he's a devout Catholic! You aren't religious at all! Holding up a bible does not make you a Christian!

I'm confused, is Biden weak and ineffective or powerful enough to hurt God?  As a Christian - yes sir, I've seen more than enough.
Our vote is power.  Voting for Biden when he's made no major concessions to the left would be letting the establishment know we are still here for them.  I can't do that.

There is no gray area on abortion. You stand for or against. Biden stands FOR abortion like his voters. End of story.

No one with any sense concerns themselves that much with Biden's VP pick. Biden knows what a VP can and should be. He can be trusted to choose wisely.
Debates don't scare Biden... Trump has a much more serious issue than he's let on. "Frontotemporal Dementia" is a cognitive dysfunction disorder that has some very unique and interesting side effects, behaviors and physical issues
Weird how Joe Biden has never had an abortion or entered into a marriage with a man! Practicing one‚Äôs own faith and legislating it into public policy for everyone including people who don‚Äôt believe the same things as you are two different things.
He's not voting for Biden. That's for sure.

President Trump billed his trip to Ohio Thursday as a chance to promote economic recovery, but he quickly pivoted to a deeply personal attack on Joe Biden.

I understand if you don't like Trump, but if you think Biden can manage a country...not just any country...the USA...you are a complete moron sheep.
The Republicans are using Kanye‚Äôs bipolar disorder to try and deflect votes from Biden. They are evil.
A vote for anyone other than Biden, is a vote for Trump. Period.
Again, where is the evidence? I have provided quotes with citations, evidence to prove that Trump is an obvious racist, xenophobe, and can prove that he's a misogynist and lead you to the conclusion that he's probably a pedophile and rapist. Prove that Joe Biden is a racist.
Related, Joe Biden said same racist AF shit today, but whatevs
Good night Twitter world. Dream of a Biden Presidency. It will happen. Biden 2020.
Russia, China, Iran, North Korea need to be put on a terrorist list all by themselves. Biden needs to drop all diplomatic relations with them. Sounds crazy. But it would work in our favor. Economically these countries rely on America. Meet our demands get reinstated
This   Joe Biden is toxic   He's the type of guy to tell an immigration activist to vote for Trump, now liberals on Twitter imitate that behavior instead of discussing ideas
I will vote for Biden, if he chooses:  1)   2) Disgraced Tour de France winner, Lance Armstrong  3) The actual entree Tour of Italy from Olive Garden.
Haha üòÑ I just like Tulsi, think she has gotten a bad rap. I'd take her over Biden.
Fuck Putin. Biden needs to go after him. Kick his commie diplomats out. Put NATO troops on his border. Pressure is what Vlady doesn't like.
I can actually because there is no evidence to suggest that Biden is actually a racist. However, Trump is blatant and clear about his racism. Including lawsuits in the 70s, congressional testimony where he was called out for his racism in 1994, among so much other evidence
What - and I cannot stress this enough - the actual fuck?  No one except the batshit crazy  pronounces it that way and I guaran-damn-tee it's because HE - not Biden - is the one whose mental state is deteriorating.  Fuck off with this bullshit.
Biden didn't say he made a mistake or that he was wrong. He said that's not what he meant. Had Trump said the same thing media would be attacking him right now, not praising like they are with Biden.
Bernie Sanders is literally campaigning for Joe Biden yet liberals are still attacking him  In a middle of a pandemic and economic collapse that's their focus. Instead of hitting the phones they are attacking Bernie Sanders   These people are deeply unserious
Maybe Biden was right???
We love you president Biden
The only reason you say that is because Biden was Obama's VP and claim everything Obama did for the black community Biden did too. Obama didn't do anything for the black community, they only claim that he did because Obama was black.
Can't we do better than our own blue trump? Replace Joe biden at the convention with someone who isn't racist and demented. We don't have to walk off the cliff like this
No one believes him. Bullshit. Plain and simple. Quit giving Biden a pass because he slips up all the time. Grow a pair and understand that what you say can sometimes have consequences.

If Biden's got that much power, then you should definitely vote for him!

I'm sorry, but you can't use racism against Joe Biden, or claim that you're choosing Trump because Biden's racist. First of all, there's a difference between misunderstanding what someone means and someone saying something flat out racist. Trump IS A RACIST and a XENOPHOBE.

CNN: Swing Voters Are Overwhelmingly Supporting Trump Over Biden
I don‚Äôt disagree with you. But the choice is easy if you ever want it to change. There is zero chance if Trump extends his dictatorship. We need a landslide victory to send him back to the hell he came from. Then we go after Biden and establishment dems to get what we deserve.
in 2018 majority of US voters, by population, voted democrats in to be the majority into the house. which aligns with biden. a majority of the US does align with biden policies even if they dont vote biden. red stated and trump won districts rejected the GOP in tons of districts
You really believe this? Trump has done more for minorities than any previous president.   Biden is out there making one racist gaffe after another. He helped write the 1994 crime bill which has incarcerated millions of African Americans. He is the real racist. Wake up, man!
I don't worship Trump, nor Biden ... I worship Jesus Christ. In my view, the Republican platform more closely matches my beliefs. In particular, the pro choice stance is a major issue for me. I'm also against socialized government ... and completely opposed to communism.
Finally a Biden position I can get behind.
I hate to say it, but any state Kanye gets on the ballet, i think will be an issue for Biden.

Ironic that you accuse those who support the president as "cultists" yet you merely parrot hollow talking points from  because you can't support Biden on substance.  Real Republicans are actually capable of clearer thinking than that...
Now they are going to vote for a reality show star. Can you imagine the discussions they've had about having a Kardashian in the WH?  They need to do something to weaken the D/Biden support with young voters. This is a hail Mary. One of many they'll likely try.

Exactly! Who is hurting God?! Biden? Hmmmmm.... ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
this is the man who couldn't name one bible verse saying biden is going to "hurt the bible".  girrrl, the bible you grabbed by the pussy for that photo op is still in pain.
Especially if it comes up in a debate. Trump won't be ready, because he has no fall back. Biden could forget, and fall back on his knowledge and life as a Catholic.
The President is right, Biden has failed to honor oaths made to God, the Catholic Church, and to the Nation in trust with God, he does attempt to "hurt" God by persecuting those who believe in Him, and by refusal to adopt policies which agree with life, and "you know the thing".
Can‚Äôt even imagine. The rally‚Äôs on twitter still get me excited. Biden just feels like politics as usual. Let‚Äôs hope he does his part and brings in some young blood in the cabinet.

What an idiotic statement.  Joe Biden has integrity.  I know that's hard for you to understand, but most of us in America miss the days of integrity in the WH.  Certainly not the only reason I'll vote Joe, but the embarrassment in the WH now has to go.
Some of us just need to see if Biden can hold an intelligible conversation or if his Veep will overthrow him and run the Country.

Well that's not Biden because he's not historically unpopular. But anyway, sucks you don't like the candidate but apparently whoever you like didn't have enough people vote for them so by those standards they were even more "evil" so would be even shittier candidates and do worse
Biden hates God.
Two big differences: 1. This has been Biden‚Äôs average lead margins while it was the biggest margin HRC ended up having.  2. Biden is near 50% in most polls while HRC seldom broke 48%.
Better.  Now to the issue at hand.  I am bigly confident that this kind of police behavior will not change at all under the current administration.   Hence, my post. Biden himself may not do much,  but his VP and AG would help.
Fuck Biden and fuck Trump. Only things I agree with Biden is pro-choice and equal rights. Only thing I agree with Trump is we need to stop relying on other countries for stuff. They both not fit for president. Biden is unhealthy and Trump is a hater.
well when they see Biden can't stay focused over the period of time of the debate with many rambling answers it likely could change many votes.
Black Folks waiting to misread anything Biden says so they can have an excuse not to get off their Asses and Vote.
My prediction is that Biden chooses Susan Rice as VP. Has a great prior relationship with him and the Obamas. Lots of foreign policy experience. Neither too moderate for progressives or too progressive for moderates.
Trump is such a fucking idiot! Can‚Äôt even make an argument against Biden when he‚Äôs not even there! ‚ÄúHurt the Bible, hurt god‚Äù??? What is he even talking about?!
I will feel better once Biden consistently polls ahead of Trump and past the margin of error in Ohio.  Ohio is one of our most reliable bellwether states.
Thanks for the update, Jim! We the people who voted for him, like it! He doesn't take a salary from us taxpayers, and then break his oaths and promises, like Biden does.

Is this the same Joe Biden that made over a 40 year career of policies that put thousands of Black Americans in prison? The same who has on multiple occasions tried to cut social security which a majority of Black Americans need? The one who's against reparations for ADOS?

You may not like it but A. Biden can be influenced by progressives that push him. B.  His platform is the most progressive democratic platform of any GE nominee. And C. he‚Äôs likely going to be a 1 term president. So consider it a bridge presidency away from pure evil.
Yeah. They stopped polling Bernie vs Trump when he dropped out.   Historically Biden did better in polls in purple states than Bernie. Bernie was very close if not under in many.   That‚Äôs a huge gamble when a Trump second term is on the line.

Biden is for redirecting police funds!
Nope. Trump is far worse at confusion than Biden will ever be or ever has been. No comparison.
No. They didn‚Äôt. I kept watch on the polls. There were several purple states where Bernie was consistently behind Trump while Biden was ahead. There were plenty of Blue collar unions in those states that wanted Biden to win but would have pushed for Trump if Bernie was the nom.
I already said I wasn't voting for Trump.  Biden has been filmed doing it many times. His handlers told him to stop because it looked bad. He didn't stop. I think it is compulsive. I can't vote for someone like that.
Biden inherently brings in POC, older blue dog democrats, rural white democrats, etc.   Look I believe in Bernie‚Äôs policies. But you can clench your teeth and believe as hard as you want - it doesn‚Äôt change political reality.

I can't believe he, of all people, actually said this. That he would put his moral history up against Biden's shows just how far gone his mind must be. Stupid, stupid mistake.
I always figured Biden was against the quantitative property that must be transferred to an object to do work.

If Joe Biden can hurt God then I'm pretty sure it won't matter which way you vote anyway. I mean, you think a dude who can fuck God up is going to respect the vote?
Well, it‚Äôs clear that Biden could never do that to Trump because Trump only goes to church when he changes wives...
So Joe Biden is a JRPG protagonist?
A man who hurts guns and hurts god sounds mighty appealing tbh   Trump is doing more to sell me on Biden than Biden is.
That's been the go to mantra of the right for decades. Bill Clinton was going to take all their guns. Then Obama was. then Hillary was. And they were already going to say the same about Biden, so it doesn't really change much.

Trump is about 1 campaign speech away from claiming Joe Biden eats babies.
Serious question- Has Joe Biden been to church as of late or are they still closed?
He‚Äôs trying every evil angle to discredit Joe Biden but it just makes him look more pathetic and desperate.
he ends this by saying Biden is "against energy" which, in fairness to Mr. Trump, is true
TIL Biden went and unlocked all the bonus weapons for the party
Biden is a racist!
The guy we are supposed to vote for in November has such a track record, how do I just downplay his history and pretend its all good. Like this gives me so much anxiety. He is the "My best friend is a black guy," type.
I‚Äôm short, Joe Biden has the power to defeat Trumps god..  Trump himself.
Holy Shit, Biden is bad ass.   If he has the power to hurt God, it‚Äôs best we not anger him by voting against him.
I just had a customer ask me if I was voting Biden or Trump in November. First of all, sir, this is a recorded line. Secondly, you couldn‚Äôt pay me vote for Trump.
Biden just claimed that the ‚ÄúAfrican-American community is not diverse‚Äù. Let that sink in.
Biden is against God. ü§£  But not Donald Trump! üòÇü§£üòÇ  Sheep.
I‚Äôm so tired of these people. They fully intend to find some reason to vote for Trump and then they will be fake aghast at him for four more years and claim that if Biden had just picked the right VP we wouldn‚Äôt be stuck with Trump again. It‚Äôs gaslighting.
I wish a progressive was the dem candidate. Biden is flawed and I didn‚Äôt want him to be the nominee. But‚Äî pay attention to the fact that Biden has adopted many of Liz Warren‚Äôs plans and made them his own. The goal now must be to rid us of the cancer that is Trump.
Yep no difference between Corn Pop, Waters, Harris and oh let‚Äôs say, Thomas, Sowell, Owens and millions of other educated black Americans. In Biden‚Äôs world blacks are the black version of the Borgs and he is their master. He decides who is black or not.
If you want to vote for Joe Biden then you should just vote for Joe Biden. I don't even want to vote for Joe Biden, but I'm going to vote for Joe Biden anyway. This really isn't very difficult.
It isn't to HURT Biden, it's to HELP Trump! That is the mindset we must use...  #KayneWest
Hey so I could write a Biden-Christian/Trump-mammon ad for you guys in about an hour suggesting clips that would absolutely kill. Hit me up.   Kinda relevant given Trumps comments about ‚Äòhurting god‚Äô today.
Yeah but they posted a picture of Biden‚Äôs dad‚Äôs accident
oh nooooo biden burt my fee fees! he cannot become president! i president!
Joe Biden has been through so much. I wish DT was decent but he‚Äôs not. Also- why is it even legal to go after political opponents like that ? It‚Äôs so shady.
Duh, clearly Biden will personally do it himself. Geez.
Biden will also take away the sunshine!  It'll be cloudy all the time.
Trump‚Äôs god is money and wealth. Mammon as the Bible calls it. The giant golden bull on Wall Street   And I doubt Biden is going to do much to harm his god, sadly, but at least it‚Äôs in the realm of possibility.   Claiming a human could harm God is blasphemy, evangelicals.
I heard Biden really is against puppy dogs and ice cream too!
Wow!! Not only is Biden an atheist, but some type of god himself that can hurt god and hurt the Bible. How can trump beat such a foe?
Biden wins Texas. I've been saying it for a while.
You claimed without pretext that I didn‚Äôt support those progressive values. I‚Äôve followed Ryan for a long time. I know what he is for. Dem party deserves criticism/overhaul. But trashing Biden to his 360k followers is helping Trump.
If Biden turns out to be too big a scardycat to actually debate #BestPresidentEver45  can simply respond to each idiotic comment from crooked creepy senile old Joe via

"Moral Leadership" by DNC hacks? Hell, Biden has insulted Blacks, Hispanics and women just this past week.  Someone needs to get him some help, this is elder abuse at this point! #GruberLibs
Imagine if Biden accomplished finding and killing God
Just that Biden arrogantly presumes he knows what a black person thinks, or ANY person for that matter, blows ME the fuck away. That demented moron doesn‚Äôt know what HE thinks minute by minute...proven EVERY time anyone views his videos.
I can‚Äôt stand Biden but I do feel bad for anyone who has lost or are in the process of losing cognitive abilities. I don‚Äôt wish Alzheimers or dementia on anyone.
It looks that way. I don't know what the Democrats are doing. All I do know is that this "non-Black" "non-diverse" woman can't vote for Joe Biden.
He also said if you don‚Äôt vote for him you ain‚Äôt black how many times this guy gotta show u he is racist you know you have all theses accusations with trump but no proof there are countless vids of Biden
If Joe Biden can hurt God, shouldn't we elect him? Shit, shouldn't we give him whatever he wants to keep him appeased?
As much as I want Harris, and her influence on the campaign messaging, I'm really not looking forward to her (or any other Black woman VP pick to be fair) having to answer for every one of Biden's racial gaffes and the media talking about how *his* words reflect on *her*.
If Biden would just keep his mouth shut until November, maybe we could get Trump out. He‚Äôs really not helping the cause rn.
GOP need not worry. Biden opposes basically all of these things as well.

After the election Biden will need to set up a separate, well staffed division in the Justice Dept (criminal &amp; civil) just to go after Trump &amp; his ilk for unprecedented crimes and profiteering to loot the US government &amp; its people. Will probably take over ten years to unravel.

Here are some of Joe Biden's greatest hits!   #walkway
Drinking game: Take a shot every time Biden says "Hey look" or "Here's the deal". Two shots for every reference that Black people are all the same.
It didn't take Biden to make liberal feminists rape apologists.
Biden could make a gaffe on 5th Avenue and he wouldn‚Äôt lose a single vote.
Who wrote that for Biden since his buds George Wallace and Robert KKK Byrd are deceased? #BidenIsARacist
Joe biden literally makes people become worse versions of themselves simply by existing and putting an onus on them to defend him as nominee
Joe Biden turned liberal feminists into rape apologists and now he got liberals arguing black people aren't diverse   Lesser of two evils my ass
Joe Biden really got liberals arguing black people aren't diverse   This is fucking sick
Even if Biden defeats Trump, fully expect a Red Wave during his administration

Nice try. Trying to make everyone forget about Joe Biden and his mistakes and lack of leader ship. New York just keeps screwing up
The black vote doesn't go "one way"  There are black people who vote Democrat   Then you have EVEN MORE who don't vote   The black people who don't vote matter. They don't vote because Democrats keep backing scumbags like Joe Biden
I'm a Bernie girl and don't care for Biden, but I don't think Biden was being racist. The Latino community is diverse because of our backgrounds. Not all Latinos come from one place. our ancestors come from Mexico, Cuba, Puerto Rico, all the way down to South America.

Joe Biden unable to answer softball questions and media's silence is 'mind-blowing,' says Sarah Sanders

Still pandering to our culture while sh*thing all over us to other groups. Joe Biden is no different than Donald Trump in my eyes.
According to Joe Biden we choose to be everything but diverse, like the Latinos.
What the actual fuck?   Fuck Joe Biden and anyone who pressures black progressives to vote for him
That would be asking for trouble. Trump lies about literally everything. There would be no way to catch all and then some lies would be treated as true. And then they will nit pick at something that is subjective that Biden says and call it not true to both sides it. Just debate
The Biden campaign is trolling progressives right now   It's the only way it could be this terrible. The establishment is just rubbing salt in the wound of former Bernie supporters for having the audacity of challenging the DNC   They are laughing at progressives voting for Biden
If I run, the establishment will 100% use my anti Biden and anti Hillary stance to attack me   They will attack me for voting Stein and Hawkins   Do you think it will work?
Based on US history, when an extreme crisis hits, the population votes in the challenger, regardless of who they are or what they‚Äôre offering. That is the probable outcome in this case as well. It‚Äôs probably the only way Biden even had a chance, but here we are.

Biden always has been relatively dumb and now he is impaired by age. He does have a prejudiced view of blacks, but here I think he was trying to talk about voting patterns and used ‚Äúdiverse‚Äù when another word would have been better.

This is what Joe Biden says about African Americans, the base of Democratic wins for decades. Notice how he panders to Latinos, a furtherance of dividing communities. Is this who Black people want in offce? Are Latinos willing to let themselves be used against Blacks this way?

Biden Owes It to America and Himself to Take a Cognitive Test

Biden really does have such a low opinion of the African American Community.  I enjoy many friendships with African American as well as Latino friends.  Both are extremely diverse.  #Election2020
Do the Republicans really think they can con Black voters in to abandoning Biden for Kanye? Are they stupid or just racist?

And we will not let it happen. Biden has 600 lawyers ready to go at any time. Bring it on biotch.
Biden is so far gone he insults people who are asking him questions to find out if they want to vote for him. He is just a puppet and you are blind if you don't see it. But in his words "if you don't vote for him you ain't black" racist much ?
Biden is playing this perfect. Let Trump be Trump. Attack. Biden is a conservative Dem. He has unexpectedly unified the Dems more than I thought. The Bernie Bros are on board. Let's just beat Trump

Love all the Biden apologists on here.  Dude lost his marbles long ago.
#GoHomeJoe  Joe Biden clarifies comments comparing diversity in Latino and Black communities
If you think Biden is coherent your the issue!!!  #FridayThoughts
She gave one to Joe Biden.
God, and the Bible, when biden walks in the room:
SO WERE ALL GONNA JUST IGNORE TRUMP SAYIN BIDEN IS STRONGER THAN GOD? ü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Ø REMEMBER WHEN THE PRESIDENT WASNT A JACKASS? ü¶¨ü•í I DONT
TOO LATE, Mr Biden,  YOU ALREADY SAID IT, YOU MEANT EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID.  That WHAT you THOUGHT &amp; THAT is WHAT SLIPPED OUT.
Don‚Äôt forget the Adults blacks don‚Äôt sit with there kids in front of the radio enough &amp; colored kids liked to rub his legs at the pool when he was a kid.   I wish I made that up but that‚Äôs Biden.   #goneskiess
He chucked out going after Biden and calling him a liar on TV    He knows Biden was lying none stop on stage and Bernie never stopped it!  Cowardly
Ok so I started following you to see just what yall are trying to accomplish. But I am confused. You don't want Trump, you dont want Biden. So what is it? What's the end goal?
Well biden is basically brain dead....
oh 100% i hate them both don‚Äôt worry üòÇ biden may forget but when he doesn‚Äôt he can speak üòÇ
Ok but politics aside, have you heard any of the times that biden completely forgets what‚Äôs he‚Äôs saying
That's because you already support him. Some of the people who voted for Trump might vote for Biden if he refutes effectively the lies Trump tells. You and I know it's BS but not everyone does and they need to hear it and see it.
So this person would rather have four more years of Hell on Earth with Trump if they don‚Äôt like Biden‚Äôs VP pick? WTF? How short sighted can you be? We are trying to save America.
Its not that fucking hard. It is trump and pence or biden. That's the choice.
As far as political affiliation goes (Republican vs. Democrat), African Americans do tend to skew heavily Democrat. Latinos, on the other hand, do have higher levels of support for the Republican Party. I suspect that's what Biden meant, but he didn't state it very well.
So, everybody's jumping all over Biden for one stupid comment while ignoring the constant stream of stupidity coming from Trumps mouth. Anyone who's looked into political opinion polls understands what Biden likely meant.
And people freak out over one stupid comment Biden makes...  Seriously, do they never listen to Trump speak? I'll take the occasional verbal stumble over this any day.
I see a tide turning among swing white voters I know. But Biden needs more visibility
Well Biden is Catholic and Trump is a Klansman. They hate Catholics too.
Joe Biden has got to be more visible.  Not just visible to his supporters. Do network interviews and make an immediate kick ass dignified response to this desperate garbage
No one:  Trump: God, when you vote for Biden.
Remember, Trump is bad and Biden and the Democrats will win everything! How dare you disagree with us!
After what Kellyanne Conway put on Twitter about Joe Biden, I suggest she take a look at this compilation of only a sparse amount of the gaffs tRump makes.  tRump cannot talk clearly AND he can almost never finish a sentence!
No shit. Don‚Äôt want to see a debate, fucking press lobs Trump softballs and will dig into Biden.
Did anybody tell dewphus that Joe is gonna JUST LET HIM TALK. An easy debate win for Biden!!ü§£
how is your top story on Fox website, and channel not the words from racist Biden interview?
Wearing a mask, will the real Joe Biden please stand up...and come out of your basement. Will the real one show up?
No matter how Republicans alter Biden‚Äôs image or how many lies they spread, it doesn‚Äôt make Trump any more electable, more capable or any smarter.Trump shows us who he is every time he speaks, stumbling over simple words, refusing to answer questions, ducking and running. Coward.
Probably isn't Biden but a double. The mask makes it easier to hide his true identity. Bet a double debates with Trump.
This is the truth.  Trump can only con you for so long.  Vote for a man of integrity. Vote for Biden to rid America of the Trump plague.
Mr Biden SHOULD TAKE a COGNITIVE TEST EXACTLY LIKE President Trump has,  Mr Biden's RESPONSES  are VERY DISASSOCIATING,  SOMETIMES MAKE NO SENSE, his POSSIBLE PRESIDENCY SCARES ME.
I also hope for a message of unity. So far, a lot of Biden's rhetoric has been more in that vein, and as far as Democrats go, he's one of the least scary ones you could pick in order to appeal more to centrists.
Donna I respectfully disagree. Do yourself a favor and look up RFK Jr and FAUCI fraud. Do some research into the Remdesivir patent, conspiring with WHO, Soros, Gates, Clinton‚Äôs, Biden‚Äôs, Fauci. Funding the Wuhan lab, virus originated. Fauci &amp; Gates vaccine to modify DNA.
Save America from total destruction by Trump. Neither Bernie nor anyone else should get your vote if you really care about the fate of our democracy.  Failure to cast a vote for Biden is tantamount to casting one in favor of Trump,the fascistpiece of shit destroying our country.
Biden has lost touch with reality.
Hiding Biden is so far gone he doesn‚Äôt even remember that he can‚Äôt remember. Sad situation.
Imagine what it will be like November 4th if Biden wins. I have two gun stores within two miles of me and will be first in line at one of them when they open.
I think Biden needs to step up his game. Create the momentum like he did in primary/caucus period before COVID. He has my full support, but there are some undecideds that are leary due to the accusations made by GOP.
I talked with 2 yesterday. Another problem is many aren't hearing anything from Biden. If it was 2016 you would see clips from his rallies on the news at least. Trump is on TV every day
Then we need to make it better. VOTE Biden
Oh yah.... Biden sent requests.  You mean his handlers may have....hes hiding in a rubber room somewhere.  Hahahahahahahahahha
Just went through three States and saw no Biden anything.
is such a Trump sycophant. This questioning of Yates is a blatant attempt to smear Biden and it‚Äôs disgusting!
He finishes sentences which tRump cannot do.  He is humble which tRump is not.  He has compassion which is an anathema to tRump.  Biden is a human.  tRump was spawned.  Just the facts Kellyanne, not your "I am going to make tRump happy" BS!
Hey a$$hole Joe Biden has suffered with a stutter his entire life!  Just like your boss making fun of people!  #Biden2020 #VoteBidenToEndThisNightmare
The GOP shouldn't want Biden to test. It would make him cognitive because testing causing results.
She‚Äôs a Castro sympathizer and will sink Biden
Big FBI raid. Has to do with Ukraine and Biden.
FBI raid, has to do with Ukraine and Biden.
If you‚Äôre a news anchor and start your hour with a rant about #Trump or #Biden, the coronavirus, or the #2020election, then you‚Äôre not a real journalist and you‚Äôre part of the problem. The rest of the world is talking about and watching #Beirut, and so should the United States.

And all of Biden's advisers are from the AOC and Bernie camp. Wake up. If Biden wins, this country will become very different--and you will not like it. Regardless, my hope is not  ultimately in government but in Another. -- Have a nice day, sir. (I lived in Europe for 17 years.)
When Biden is president he will be happy to answer any and all questions addressed to him. My favorite will be when he is asked if he will pardon any of the trumps and he responds NO! #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Oh my, what would a phantom Joe Biden presidency--which would be a radical Marxist regime--do to our economy for instance? What would his Green New Deal do? What would higher taxes do? What would open borders do? What would  paying out reparations do? Oh my Daniel! Think!
I support the idea the Biden should not debate Trump. Trump will lie, make up fake facts, call names and in general make a mockery of the process. The aren't enough fact checkers to keep up with his lies.
Yesterday  answered 17 questions from reporters today &amp; at least 220 q‚Äôs from reporters since July 19.  Joe Biden answered NO questions from reporters today &amp; only 36 q‚Äôs from reporters since July 19 - and none since July 28.  Why is the media covering for Biden??
If Joe Biden is incapable of debating President Trump, how can he be capable of negotiating with foreign leaders or Congress?
What rally has Biden had
Robin Williams ‚Äì Rambling Joe Biden  via   Even Robin Williams knew it back in 2009
The smartest thing Biden can do is to just let Trump do exactly what he is doing now with his incessant insanity and stupidity.   Biden just has to let Trump continue to self destruct.
Oh my...Joe Biden is loosing his mind. He won't debate. He stays virtually locked in his basement. He can't think on his own. -- And you will vote for him?!??!? Oh my!
You didn‚Äôt post this Hiden Biden.
Science tells us that a baby in the womb is a baby.   Joe Biden denies this.
Supporters Urge Joe Biden Not to Debate Trump, Applaud Hosts for Canceling Over COVID-19 Concerns
Why would any Biden supporter have been attending a Trump rally?
Hurry Election Day.  Joe Biden wind by a landslide!!!
They‚Äôre afraid Joe Biden will speak in public.
You though I liked Biden?!?   üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Does Joe Biden know where Joe Biden is?
Not that you're wrong, but there are a lot of black people who love biden for better, or worse. Their votes matter, and he seems to have a large percentage of them, so...
Why? By the time they get the actual money, they will be moving out. Perhaps they want to put in surveillance equipment to spy on President Biden
There wouldn‚Äôt be a message about space if Joe Biden were elected, unless he finds a new green way to fuel rockets.
Biden is a puppet . What has he done in office 40 plus years ???
Good let‚Äôs see Biden and Pelosi‚Äôs taxes !!
I think the only one that knows anything at all about Biden's process is Joe. For all you know, he made his choice long ago. I'm so tired of people speculating on it like they know anything
None of us know what Biden is thinking or deciding and I think the speculation by people that think they do is embarrassing
You ignored Lewis's funeral.  We know you were doing work for the American people. We've watched, you don't do shit. You've written off the black vote haven't you. You are counting on West to take their votes away from Biden. You think they are that stupid!ü§°üí©!
Biden isn‚Äôt their leader, he‚Äôs their puppet.
US election 2020: The war hero who could be Biden's running mate and SHOULD be
My family voting for Biden are long-time Reagan Republicans but OK
Biden needs to have command of exact facts and figures of Trump's failed term to show not only that he has better plan, but also Trump was wrong choice. Play offense and defense
excellent piece on How Biden is Winning. Thank you
Obama had two terms!! You didn‚Äôt beat him!! Praying BIG time you are out of here soon!!! VOTE BIDEN!!!
LOL there is a HUGE exodus going on in the Republican party. Many Reps are realizing what a giant mistake they made and are now voting for Biden. Some of them are my aunts and uncles. 5 of my aunts and uncles are Republicans who voted for Trump, 4 of whom are voting Biden.
Why is BARR already saying he won‚Äôt prosecute Obama or Biden?
If Biden only wins the electoral votes, do you think he will accept the win? After all, the left wants to eliminate the Electoral College.
You are right. We need ICE officers that follow the guidelines President Biden gives them after he cleans house in January
Same way Biden is ahead of Trump; fake polls!
I mean, I‚Äôm still voting for him. Still better than Biden in my opinion lolü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
All of these need to be taken down. The top two are essential. If Moscow Mitch is still in office, Biden will have a more demanding task. No one should have to put up with a jerk like McConnell. #DitchMitch #votebiden #voteblue
Mr Biden,  WHAT is YOUR EFFECTIVE PLAN to STOP the SPREAD of this CHINESE CORONAVIRUS which  President Trump has ALREADY been doing, HE has been WEARING a MASK, HE has been SOCIALLY DISTANCING, HE is being TESTED EVERYDAY, as are MILLIONS of American Citizens = HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE
Wouldn't that stop all this BS dragging out lock downs! If he could delay it , they would have to change their strategy to cheat  and lie to get Biden elected üôÑ  #bidendementia
Trump has destroyed the checks. Restoring them has to be a Biden priority. He won't abuse them but the laws need to be clearer so it won't happen in the future. Trump should have been impeached. Majority leaders should not have so much power as Moscow Mitch used to save Trump.
We really need to ABOLISH THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE... This is why the left won't vote for Biden! We need to push him further Ieft!
I didn't think Dan Rather was still alive!  I guess we have to classify him in the generic Joe Biden classification.  Dementia is a terrible disease.
In the scenario where Biden wins the election, he would also still be under protection from the Secret Service at that point in time. So would the Secret Service be put up against its own team? Who has the authority in that situation?
Biden is just the Democratic puppet
Ok then, vote for Biden. He's your man!
Mom's for Biden? They want their children molested?
What about high risk people? I mean I‚Äôll be voting for Biden in person regardless. You should probably no show up. You‚Äôll see soon that the *impeached bunker bitch is going to try to get you to stay home. He wants it to look like it wasn‚Äôt a fair election when you don‚Äôt show up.
Why can‚Äôt Biden just laugh at him and move on? He can use the police and military against his supporters if they try anything, since they like type of thing that so much.
And so, you will now vote for Joe Biden who can't complete two sentences?
GOP members up fo re-election are signing their death warrants as elected officials. When the election is over if Biden wins if the US and UN don‚Äôt hold all members that did not impeach Trump, Pence, and Trump should be charged mass murder Nuremberg II. Then he shot 150000
Is there now? And before you scream ‚Äú2016‚Äù, you should know margin of error was in effect because polls were close at the end. Biden is up 20% in NJ. That is a deep blue state.
I‚Äôm not a young woman and NOTHING will stop me from voting on November 3. I‚Äôll stand in rain, snow, amid a pandemic surrounded by idiots without masks to vote for Biden.  Trump will do anything to steal this election.
So how many years joe Biden been in congress and hasn‚Äôt done anything!? That‚Äôs the changes that needs to happen
Joe Biden. He picks himself for VP.
So I guess yur for socialism which you will get if Biden gets electedLol dafck going on bruh ü•¥  Intelligence community's top election official: China and Iran don't want Trump to win reelection, Russia working against Biden
lmao....both would probably fail. But I would still vote for Biden. At least he would still listen to those around him...unlike Trump's demented ass! üò°
Trump wouldn't take a swing at a MAN...only his ex-wives and other women.  Let him try it....Biden would kick Trump's ass!! üò°
Well, to be honest, Trump is on record of saying that latinos entering our country are all rapists, drug dealers, and murderers....this statement from Biden is not that.
Well said, Leah, and I completely agree.  The position that  holds in a Biden admin isn't as important as that she be the one tasked to coordinate the investigation into the deep rot in the WH, Congress and financial institutions
I'm trying to understand what's the issue... everything....and I mean, everything is an opportunistic moment ... what Biden says needs no clarification... but African Americans do. Do I need to clarify that?!
he just revoked Biden's n-word pass
Joe Biden with that racist comment üò¨
That may not happen It will backfire at Kayne West because there will be a Biden-Democrat Landslide coming on November 3 because of The escalation of The COVID-19 üò∑going on.
Considering Biden isn‚Äôt with it enough the VP is going to be a target, the media will spin it as Trump is attacking her because she‚Äôs a woman...and a woman of color at that. It‚Äôs a built in defense mechanism.
I like how no one talked about not voting for biden in the initial tweet but you are like already here ready to insist that is what the tweet was about
"Dear Diary, The Orange man can't say a single word without people realizing how much better of an option he is than Biden. How do we continue to be good little resisters? XOXO, Little Jimmy"
If Biden loses any state by the number of votes that Kanye West gets in that state, then they deserve 4 more years of Trump. If that is the master plan, then we should be good, right?
Yeah, and what exactly is Biden offering Black moderates?   Name ONE policy for Black people. ONE
They need to implement a comedy show staring Biden. He would get a lot of polical laughs
That's why I always vote &amp; I will be voting for Biden because I just can't see Myself voting for Trump.
Such a weirdly cynical thing this is  Forbes: Exclusive: Kanye West Indicates That His Spoiler Campaign Is Indeed Designed To Hurt Biden.
Its not that fucking hard. It is trump and pence or biden. That's the choice.
Trump is going to get nailed in a Biden-Democrat Landslide on November 3.
That's what they do. They deflect &amp; ignore the dumb ignorant stuff he says and only focus on Biden.  There are no good choices in this election.
While I'm very happy with Biden as our nominee, I often ponder whether Kamala would have won the nomination for president if Biden hadn't sought it.
If Joe Biden could just shut up for 3 months and stop making idiotic comments, that would be great.
How about Joe Biden is better.
You ever left your city? Black people on the coasts aren't like Black people in the Deep South or the Mid-West or the Southwest.   Also, just because older Black people are on board with Biden doesn't mean that the youth gives AF about him.
Get your paper and pencil out and write out all the pros that Trump has done so far.  If by chance you are blinded by your bias, I will help you. Now tell what Biden has done in 40 years of politics besides filling the pockets of his family with $$...greed...power...
Do you want our economy to collapse? Trump is fighting an all out battle. Words slur‚Äîso. Are you so perfect that you don‚Äôt make a mistake. There is a difference of occasionally slurring a word and out and out insanity coming from Biden‚Äîbeing closeted for what reason‚Äîgaffs...hmm
How y‚Äôall voting for Biden is beside me üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I keep hoping that Biden will just come out and say that he supports democratic capitalism, the free market moderated by democracy.  It IS what he believes, but sometimes wonder if Dems are afraid of the C word, capitalism, right now..
I keep hoping that Biden will just come out and say that he supports democratic capitalism, the free market moderated by democracy.  It IS what he believes, but sometimes wonder if Dems are afraid of the C word, capitalism, right now..
Give me the other reasons why Trump would be so dangerous. Are you willing to have Biden who is afraid or rather mentally incapacitated lead the world against China/Russia .  Give me a legitimate reason why you hate Trump so bad.
How discussing Mia. Get the news straight. You are taking clips about Biden and inserting your bias towards Trump. Why don‚Äôt you sit down and write all the things Trump has done so far and then put a list along side of Biden‚Äî8 yrs VP=0!
But not a bad roadmap for what will likely happen after the election, assuming Biden wins.  Wouldn't be surprised if they even started calling Trump a closet democrat again, because it makes the narrative a little easier.
CNN: Virginia mayor urged to resign after allegedly saying Joe Biden picked 'Aunt Jemima' as his VP.
I will not be voting by mail because I don‚Äôt trust it. Trump has his claws in the process. I will vote using a paper ballot and will crawl over glass to cast my vote for Biden.
Dems on Biden‚Äôs Mental Decline - (BEFORE He Won the Nomination)
Voting for Biden
Biden knows how the traditions in our system are supposed to work. I believe his establishment background will do a lot to restablish norms. It‚Äôs going to be such a narrow line to walk. It will require complete alignment with the rule of law. I don‚Äôt envy the new AG
Sarah Cooper should be Joe Biden‚Äôs VP
You are correct. To be honest I am incredibly dismayed with how easily our Federal Government caved into a coward. If Biden wins it will be the work of decades to re-establish norms.
This guy is hurting Biden? Ok
Couldn't they just wait a few months till Biden takes office and THEN smack him with the charges? That way, Pence can't pardon him? Lull him into thinking he got away with it, then POW! I would pay serious money for a front row seat when he's charged...and even buy popcorn üçø
Right? I still fail to realize how he will hurt Biden. I mean...
You want to beat Biden but not 45?  Never thought I'd see the day where you'd become a politician's b*tch.  Such is life.
Interesting...Joe Biden said in one of his few talks he will be the most progressive president if elected. That‚Äôs a wife for you‚Äîhanging on to any power string dangling in the media to bolster her frail husband using the term ‚Äòmoderate‚Äô.  Define Moderate Mrs Biden
Joe Biden eulogized a segregationist
The MSM needs to be ALL OVER THIS!!  PLAY IT 24/7 because if Biden made this gaffe...the MAGAts surely would....You-Semite.  What a DOTARD!
Drip biden
Could somebody explain why the left (Pelosi, Dems,squad, Hollywood...)are using a mentally incapable Biden to push the socialist view in that everyone should share. Does this mean that Pelosi &amp; others are willing to give up their gated communities and $235 gallon ice cream treats
And all of Biden's advisers are from the AOC and Bernie camp. Wake up. If Biden wins, this country will become very different--and you will not like it. Regardless, my hope is not  ultimately in government but in Another. -- Have a nice day, sir. (I lived in Europe for 17 years.)

Look, another ex republican for Biden... isn't it interesting how there's so many of those
Revolutionary Communist Party USA leader endorses Biden
Send us your financial records no_scooters. I don‚Äôt get why it‚Äôs a thing. Idc what his say what Biden‚Äôs say or what yours says. It‚Äôs your shit. Not everyone else‚Äôs. With Obama it was show us your birth certificate. Now it‚Äôs taxes. What‚Äôs next year? Nudes?
The Biden Campaign is already behind mobilizing black churches.  As the kids say ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up with that?‚Äù
That's it., no one likes me, well no one in the media but he will blow Joe Biden away , and how is it at election time so many like you have single digit followers Troll Maybe
"Harris knows the Black American experience. She knows the South Asian American experience. She knows the immigrant experience. She knows the aspirational power of the American dream. She is the running mate for this moment."
Oh my...Joe Biden is loosing his mind. He won't debate. He stays virtually locked in his basement. He can't think on his own. -- And you will vote for him?!??!? Oh my!
OMG! are you insane (while Biden will look like the distinguished, Presidential, intelligent and educated gentleman that he is)
You must be out of your mind Biden doesn't know where he's at or what position he's running for
And, really, it's not like we will vote for the Republican if we don't like the VP candidate. So, we need a VP who is qualified to be president and who will work well with Biden. That's all.  I wonder who Obama favors.
That WOULD BE IDEAL.....but we KNOW that's not going to happen.  I promise not to say one damn negative thing about Biden's VP pick.   I can just control me....not others. ‚ô•
It's unreal that they're still trying to drag this brother over these lies.   One of the accusers is a proven liar, and the other one claimed that she didn't remember being assault until Fairfax was elected Lt. Governor.   Me Too is dead anyway after the Biden nonsense.
I'm very torn on this.   I'm not sure we can guarantee which states are "swing" this year. feels like everything is crazy, up in the air.  Im nervous if Trump eeks this out, we won't be alive to vote for a 3rd party in 2024.  Its like "Vote biden and buy us time" sort of.
There is zero evidence Biden is a ‚ÄúPedo‚Äù two accusers of trumps were under 18 one was 14. But please continue to prove your in the cult and that the Dear Leader does no wrong ü§£.
The country is in ruins while the racist-in-chief fixates on Obama, lies on Pelosi and harbors jealousy for Biden, Fauci and the late John Lewis.
Next. No.  The actual poll numbers as of late are that 38% of voters think that Biden has dementia.  Of that 38%, 20% are Democrat voters.  Quit lying to your loyal audience.
Next. You make this seem like it‚Äôs a bright spot in  re-election hopes.  There are approx 53.7M Black people between the ages 18-29.  68% is approx 36.5M that are voting for Biden.  You left out the ages 30-64.  Clearly you don‚Äôt think they are voting for Trump!
Let‚Äôs start with how you lead with how "we don‚Äôt know much about Biden‚Äôs 2020 governing style".  Not true!  You know because you‚Äôre a "journalist" and you are acclimated to the campaign chatter.  Your loyal audience doe t know because all they listen to is Fox News sources.
lol this claims Biden's platform is the most progressive of any candidate in history, and yet his healthcare plan is just, "restore the worst part of Obamacare that everyone hates". we're in a literal pandemic and this is all they offer. fuck you
You have lost your mind like Biden
So if I‚Äôm hearing this correctly, Biden is interested in free tuition towards HBCUs for students qualifying due to a family income of $125K or less and debt cancellation of HBCU alumniü§®
If you were smart you wouldn't be voting Biden, the man doesn't know what year it is
Hope Americans are not falling for their bullshit!  Elect JOE BIDEN and help save our democracy!
Riiiiggghhhtt. üòÇ Kinda like your transition from Bloomburg to Biden? üòÇüòÇ  Have a great rest of your morning!
Yeah - like we're not exactly going to vote for the other guy if we don't like Biden's choice.
Yes definitely not the back story Biden wants to drag forward at the moment (Dems have enough image problems with the socialism-fearing crowd already  :) ).  I keep coming back to Harris- tested at state level several times, attorney general &amp; I like that she has the sharp elbows
I will be up ALLLLLL night watching and celebrating a landslide victory for Joe Biden and his Black female running mate! ü•Ç
Of course, I would vote for a hot turd in the son over Trump. Not that Biden is a turd but I cannot imagine anything changing my vote
excellent piece on How Biden is Winning. Thank you
And they talk about Biden.  The man's cheese has clearly slid off the cracker. #TrumpIsNotWell
I think GOP will die after the election or at least have 0 political impact. The main opposition party to right/centrist Biden administration will be the progressive/left side of the Democratic party.
My favorite fantasy scenario is where Joe Biden, during his inaugural address, commands the law enforcement officers in attendance to detain Donnie John in the middle of the inauguration.  #JusticeServed
So the vote blue no matter who crowd really didn‚Äôt mean no matter who then? Shocking. Also, perhaps u haven‚Äôt noticed but Trump &amp; co are literally doing the same thing w Biden. Calling him a socialist, calling him the radical left, etc. He was gonna do that no matter who it was
Identity politics need to stop. It is destroying our country. Mr. Biden you need to pick a competent candidate it can be a white male don't look like you're pandering it's disgusting.
You can't understand how corporate corruption doesn't hamstring a party that's supposed to represent the interests of everyday working people? Just wait until 2022 when a spineless Biden loses his majority in Congress because they did nothing to rein in corporate malfeasance.
I love that you did this. The #DNCisCorrupt and needs to be pushed to reform itself. Biden should no honeymoon, so I propose we start pushing #AOC2024 starting November 4th. #NoHoneymoonForBiden
Biden may have dementia...but he didn‚Äôt comment about a pandemic in October for no reason...he knew what was coming...
Look at the dates...Biden and Wapo knew what was coming...
Yes, wouldn't be surprised if there were ulterior motives.  Harris would be formidable in 2024, assuming Biden picks her and they win.  But our country could do far, far worse - Harris is a pro
If I‚Äôm reading this correctly, if Biden announced today it would be second earliest since 1968, in relation to the convention.
Pretty sure the first thing Biden will do is fire all of the inspector generals, reach out to our enemies for support and try to push back the elections. Frightening!
I'm still thinking about how I saw a campaign yard sign for Biden this week. I wonder who lives in that house, and what the process of ordering that sign was like for them.
For the most disliked he outshined in 2016. Maybe his tweets are not liked, but this president has the stamina and keeping his promises. He is exposing the swamp.  This man is for the people!  Check everything he has done so far. Be careful of a cognitively impaired Biden
The very first thing the Biden Administration should do is to disband DHS and send all those agencies back to where they were pre-9/11.
Ok then, vote for Biden. He's your man!
I'm waiting for a proper answer. There just isn't one. There's no sense in this lesser evil shit anymore. The people didn't want Biden just like they didn't want Trump. DNC/GOP are the same.
And so, you will now vote for Joe Biden who can't complete two sentences?
what say you now hack?
I thought that was only supposed to happen in Biden‚Äôs America?!
While I think Biden is a shit candidate. I believe this video is pretty old. Like 2019 old. No one in the video has a mask on. If this was recorded in the last few months that would not be a think. Posting falseish info doesn‚Äôt help the cause.
This is the first time I feel acknowledged &amp; targeted as a Berniecrat. I'm just out here settling for Biden
Kinda like what Biden did.
And isn‚Äôt Biden a former VP.....who is now running........for...........president???? Folks say some goofy ass shit
Yes, Biden needs to stop saying that. He will need to string some of these things out over the entire first week.
Ohhh! So when you said Biden was going to destroy the suburbs, you were just projecting again? Man. Wish I could have seen that coming. When we finally get your tax returns, and you going to start calling Biden a tax evader and a money launderer?
Craazy.. she is about the most talented on Biden's list
My point is, i don‚Äôt think Beto helps Biden win Texas. If anything, he hurts his chances... I appreciate your Bernie reference though. Reminds me of why we have trump now, because the most corrupt modern day politician lost.
Biden just isn't strong or able to run this country as President. He really needs to retire this whole thing. I di find it sad to watch him even if he is  an asshole at times. He's not well.
Desperately trying to make Joe Biden a radical. Don't think it'll work.'You have blood on your hands': Antiabortion protesters interrupt Biden's Iowa speech  Trump has killed over a 150,000 and a woman has a right to chose. The dead from a declared hoax is mass murders. I'll take Biden.
Thanks!
Evil duo of Galloway and Biden!
Thanks Fake Joe. Followed all I wasn‚Äôt. Please follow back. Stronger together.

He isn't Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden.  All the worst people in the world hate Trump.  That's a good enough reason to support him.
The entire GOP exonerated Trump when they had damning evidence of him seeking to influence his own re-election by leaning on foreign powers to create dirt against Biden, and still people are fainting when the GOP enable and participate in the actions of traitors.
Russia wants Trump to Win.  China and Iran and Canada and Mexico and India and Italy and the United Kingdom and Spain and Germany and Japan and New Zealand and France and Australia and Sweden and Norway and the Netherlands and oh, we can't forget #Thighland ... want Biden to win.

Welp.....  Aug 7 (Reuters) - Easing uncertainty will likely drive U.S. stocks higher after the Nov. 3 presidential election, regardless of whether Democratic candidate Joe Biden or Republican President Donald Trump wins, Scott Minerd of Guggenheim Investments said.
Joe Biden is truly a politician's politician and that's not a good a thing. How in the hell did we get stuck with these two idiots?
Good, I'm glad you said that.  I was just about to point that out on your other thread.  Also, the whole statement is worded to make it look like 2/3 nations are actively opposing the US gov't, and Russia is just besmirching Biden, not deploying active measures.
Trump and the GOP are literally traitors and should be tried in a court of law.
Joe Biden did not apologize he said people took him wrong. That's not an apology that's an excuse

In Biden‚Äôs day, when Warren was a Republican and Bernie was mostly a communist apologist, he was actually a progressive. Is he without faults when it comes to being supportive of feminism or assisting systemic problems? No. But he arguably did a lot to move the ball forward.
To me, this and other critiques of Biden and other pols that aren‚Äôt Bernie or Warren, always fails the test because neither Bernie or Warren were always progressives by today‚Äôs standards, and often still are not in certain areas.

IMO, if anything is true of Biden, it‚Äôs he‚Äôs a male of his era and embodies those qualities (good and bad), but he‚Äôs actually been more submissive to women and their requests than most male colleagues throughout his career and life - not the other way around.
This gives me hope, but we gotta vote!
LOL! You are really laying it on thick. Truth is, Democrats always have to fix the economy, and to be clear Obama and Biden gave us the economy we have been enjoying. It was the GOP enablers and Trump who have put all of us in this mess. No lying will change that.  #Biden2020
I understand her point if you look at it from the way the media treats ambitious, political women, but dumping on Biden for it and making him central and not the fact that most of the media is dominated by dumb men seems counterproductive and ridiculous.
Donna Brazil is embarrassing with the way she just handled herself on the Daily Briefing. This is typical Dem behavior! Voters beware! Dems are so far left,  A Biden Presidency will turn your life and mine upside down!

I find Traister to have good opinions on sexism and a lot of her criticism is typically correct and warranted, but her critiques of Biden are just absolutely off the wall wrong and make no sense when you compare it to his actual life, legacy, and who he has given control.
Hunter Biden isn‚Äôt running for President. Besides, that‚Äôs a whataboutism
Joe Biden is clearly racist. He just knows how to cover it up way better than Trump. And that‚Äôs what white Democrats do.
He has never been a fan of keeping troops in Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq. He has tried to pull troops out of there many times with the Rep and Dem establishment being very much against it. Biden's potential VP wants to keep troops in Syria.
Question for those touting Biden's public option as a step forward:  What is to stop the insurance lobby from helping write a weak public option, just as they helped write the ACA, as a means of souring opinion on universal healthcare?
*me logging into twitter after a week away*: hmm, I wonder if Biden has announced a VP pick yet?  (sees Betty White trending)  Bold and unexpected choice! Can't say I disapprove!
My emphasis nowadays is more on building a coalition in Congress, and what I've settled on is that Trump would definitely veto good legislation that needs done like M4A and Green New Deal, but I don't think Biden would
I just learned from  that covid-19 is a scam perpetrated by George Soros so Joe Biden can select Hillary Clinton as his running mate so Dems can force Biden to step down once elected to make Hillary president.   Thoughts, everyone?
Well, to be honest, Trump is on record of saying that latinos entering our country are all rapists, drug dealers, and murderers....this statement from Biden is not that.

is CRAZY talking about getting people ‚Äúexcited‚Äù to vote for Biden. NOBODY IS EXCITED ABOUT ELECTING ANOHER RACIST RAPIST, not even the democrats.
Biden‚Äôs message was clear to me.   The white community is very divided over Trump.  The Latino community is less so but somewhat divided.  The black community is united in opposition of Trump.  Good for them. They‚Äôre the smartest among us and are most affected by Trump‚Äôs racism.
How long ago was that? It's called educating yourself and evolving after being conditioned your whole life. Also, how is Biden in '70 something any different from this:

I'm trying to understand what's the issue... everything....and I mean, everything is an opportunistic moment ... what Biden says needs no clarification... but African Americans do. Do I need to clarify that?!
Biden can hurt GOD?! I'm definitely voting for the all-powerful Biden, then. I ain't incurring his wrath.
November may well be a debacle for the GOP. Haley may not want to be on a ticket with that much loser stink.  I think Trump sticks with Pence no matter what. He'll need him for a pardon two-step in January if Biden wins.

I wouldn't expect Biden's campaign ads to be yanked either. This is stupid.
Good luck to Venton but I hope Biden fires his boss on Jan 21, 2021 for the Roger Stone Trump ass kissing decsion.
Will be very interesting to see how they decide on AOC. On one hand, no doubt it could be an effective endorsement that would fire up young progressives. On the other, it‚Äôs a ready-made Trump ad at a time when Trump is already trying to paint Biden as a puppet of AOC and Sanders.
My hope is a stabalization of US politics.  Polarization leads to conflict and eventual collapse.  Trump used conflict on the right to inject polarization, get elected, then dismantle the structures that protects people like us from people like him. No idea what biden did wrong..
Be real!  If  gets a second term, he will be the oldest president in office, too!  I think it's hilarious all the points the Trump Republicans are making about Biden.  Let's face it-it's two old white guys running for office.  That comes with lots of baggage!
I had the same thought. Especially because (to my knowledge) Clinton has yet to publicly endorse Biden (or at least not been very vocal about it), which I‚Äôm assuming has been a conscious choice on the part of the campaign.
Biden has made a career out of ignoring people. He doesn't need you to remind him.

Sad, but true. "...recent reports that Republican operatives have been aiding his campaign suggest that GOP members see West‚Äôs candidacy as a way to draw votes away from Joe Biden."
Yes. Actually came very close too. Look at late +George's column - penned in '12. It's about what Obama did &amp; what will happen if it's not stopped. Trump stopped it. Supreme Court upheld his measure. Biden vows to return to Obama's mandate. +George died in '15. Google up article
7- "..liabilities of (Biden)..involve the same issues that dogged (Dukakis).. ‚Äî mental fitness to handle the duties.., difficulty connecting with the minority voters.., and the willingness to brand any opponent a racist who dares to bring up ‚Äúlaw and order‚Äù.  Look familiar? ü§î

Broken record: 1) Joe Biden says something racist; 2) JB forgets he says it; 3)his handlers right an apology trying to make it look like JB wrote it; 4) JB forgets the apology; 5)Joe Biden waits two weeks to talk again from his basement; 6) JB says something racist; Repeat
I know the Constitution says a census must happen every 10 years. It doesn't say we can't have them more often. Can the Biden administration have another legit one? Or continue this one too count everyone and then make the necessary changes to ensure states have what they deserve

My theory: Biden's campaign people run his twitter account, but every so often they let him tweet, except it goes on the Cleveland Indians account.
Another Joe Biden apology. Until the next one....

Interior. Police interrogation room.  A detective in kneeling in prayer while holding a doll towards the ceiling.  Detective: God, take the doll and show me where Biden hurt you. #Biblicalidiot
If Biden loses any state by the number of votes that Kanye West gets in that state, then they deserve 4 more years of Trump. If that is the master plan, then we should be good, right?
Either Joe Biden is a quivering, senile, weak-minded man who is easily controlled by his own party, or, as the president said, he can "hurt God." I can't keep up with the messaging. And I don't know how small the president thinks God is.
BIDEN  BELONGS IN A ‚Äú ALZHEIMER FACILITY‚Äù HE LOST HIS MARBLES ! HE CAN KISS GOODBYE 2 D PRESIDENCY! ANYWAY ! TRUMP IS THE CHOSEN ONE BY GOD ALMIGHTY TO LEAD HIS NATION TO THE RIGHT PATH OF GREATNESS AMEN! TRUMP 2020 OR BUST!! DEBATE!! DEBATE! CHICKEN  BIDEN MUST DEBATE IF HE CAN
The longer Biden keeps from announcing the VP pick the longer Trump is kept from attacking them.
Lmaooooo this is what the media focuses on and completely ignores anything Biden says
Ok as long as all the Biden voters show up on Nov 4 to vote
Biden carries a Rosary with him... EVERY DAY!!!  Trump carries Hepatitis, Herpes and enough Adderall to kill a small horse!!!
In opposite land they say Trump is a stroke victim that can't hold a glass of water. That his appearances are limited because he's on death's door. That we should vote for the brain-dead Biden because he might last a few days longer than Trump. This is our world now.
Ignore it. Work like we're 10 points down in nat'l.  Biden's down here in MO. One CD -- MO-02 -- is flippable. MO Gov, AG, Lt Gov, Treasurer, seats in the GOP super-majority Leg are the prizes. They're all uphill fights. Focus. Give time, $, sweat.  .
But still, if aren‚Äôt voting for Biden, you ain‚Äôt black.
Who is writing this BS?! It‚Äôs definitely NOT Biden. Not with his record. It‚Äôs trash. #ReplaceBiden
Really This is what you say about Biden? Crazy
For me, they most important thing about Biden's candidacy is the Not Trump part.  Other than that, he could choose an old stinky sneaker and I'm all in.
Did you discuss how Father Drinan SJ and Father Joseph Fuchs SJ were among the ones who came up with the formula that allowed Catholic politicians like Biden to support abortion?
Special reminder to fuck Bernie Sanders because he abandoned us.  I won't be voting in November no matter who Biden picks. I ain't voting for a fucking rapist.   Burn mother fucker burn.
BIDEN'S GONNA RIP CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS AND PUT THEM IN CAGES AND TAKE AWAY YOUR HEALTH CARE AND SEND ARMED MILITIA TO YOUR CITY TO TAKE YOUR FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS AND CALL  YOU LOCAL PAPER FAKE NEWS AND LET 160,000 PEOPLE DIE AND HAVE THE BIGGEST DEFICIT...oh wait.
Kanye West says he's OK taking Black voters away from Joe Biden ‚Äî thus helping Trump's reelection ‚Äî as he launches his wild card presidential bid
#VoteTrumpOut Trump is now attacking Biden's Faith--Trump has 'fake faith'! He is corrupt in the WH, he lies, he has sexual allegations against him, alleged tax fraud for devaluating Trump Org &amp; Trump University defrauded people! Trump using this lie for votes! Get rid of Trump!

"Exhibit A to Z. Focus on booting the ü§° and his maggot Republicans out of the Oval Office come November."
Trump will literally call out anyone who attacks him. He's petty, it's one of his worst flaws. I don't know why Biden does it
Too late, Joe Biden‚Äôs script writers! You‚Äôre fooling no one. I prefer his direct, verbal messaging; it reveals what he‚Äôs really thinking and the panicked flurry of spin in his wake is highly entertaining. I wish him all the best after November when his political career is over.
When asked whether his effort would serve as a Biden spoiler, Kanye  reportedly texted back, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to argue with you.‚Äù Asked  again about hurting Biden‚Äôs campaign, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not denying it; I just told you,‚Äù he replied.  Don't fall for it, folks.
Nobody is beyond God‚Äôs mercy, but let‚Äôs be clear: Joe Biden is pro-abortion and has been denied Communion for it. At best, he is a terribly, terribly lapsed Catholic whose personal beliefs starkly contrast church doctrine.
Obama didn't announce his choice of biden until August 23rd 2008.
Why Biden has only 7.8mil followers In twitter? Where are the Bernie followers? Even Bernie has only 12+mil followers. On the other side Hillary has 24mil. Even when combined, they are Still less than Trump‚Äôs! What‚Äôs the matter ?
Like...as if we were ever silly enough to vote for Biden
Joe Biden tried to clarify remarks he made at #NABJNAHJ20 suggesting African Americans are not as diverse as Latinos. ‚ÄúIn no way did I mean to suggest the African American community is a monolith ... ,‚Äù Biden tweeted Thursday night.
Wait, I thought you bubble brains said Biden was the leader of BLM and Antifi now he locked up black people. Get you stories right. Did you forget Regean was the one who enacted 3 strikes. He locked up way more Black people. Oops!
I‚Äôm attending Joe Biden for President‚Äôs event, ‚ÄúBiden National Volunteer Call with Special Guests‚Äù ‚Äì sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
Make no mistake, I‚Äôm going with Biden, because Trump has proven he only cares about himself, but this is a clear example of how much Biden has to learn. It‚Äôs one thing to say geopolitics in the Americas vary, but it‚Äôs not acceptable to diminish Black lives in this way.
True.  Biden just apologized for being a racist.
Is she gonna send a death squad to threaten them to vote Biden?
Yes and that's why I won't vote for Biden or the illogical party of hate.
Biden really doing everything he can to lose in november.
They have no where else to run to. Biden is like that abusive husband to them. Stockholm syndrome basically.
Biden‚Äôs faith shouldn‚Äôt be questioned like it was.   But let‚Äôs not act like his policies match up with his faith.
yo no one cares bout this bruh your mans said Biden will hurt God
Joe Biden.  Wrong yet again on important issues.
I just signed a  petition: Get Biden and Bernie to the Peace Billboard in Milwaukee. Sign here:
Biden walks back African American 'diversity' remarks, lauds community's 'diversity of thought'
I‚Äôve totally trained myself to not think of it as a vote for Biden, but a vote AGAINST trump. I wanted Elizabeth Warren, but here we are. That‚Äôs what I try to tell the younger people. It‚Äôs not a vote FOR Biden, but a vote AGAINST trump. That resonates.
Joe Biden getting ratio'd for this tweet and I am cackling
Domt you know? All the chaos this year is what will happen if Biden becomes president. How the hell Trump convinced them of that is freaking beyond me. They have absolutely ZERO common sense. Clearly they have ZERO intellect. How can anybody be stupid enough to believe THAT!?
Trump did not attack Biden's faith. He was talking about what Biden would do as president. Which is wipe out Religious Liberty by rescinding the protection from the HHS mandate and his Supreme Court picks. Gorsuch turned out to be disappointment. Biden picks would be disaster.
And just to be clear, I LOVE Bernie Sanders. Always have. Always will. But to STILL do some kind of "protest vote" desipte all that has happened is grade A bullshit. Sorry, not trying to be a dick. But dont be part of the problem. Hold your nose and fucking vote for Biden.
Blah, blah, blah. Lot of Trump like word salad there.   You‚Äôre a smart woman and despite your ‚Äúconvinctions‚Äù or whatever, write ins are in part why we are where we are today. Write in if you want, but stop with ‚Äúthoughtful‚Äù excuses, don‚Äôt blame Biden or Rice. Own your shit.
Biden will wipe out Religious Liberty with his promise to rescind the HHS mandate as well as his Supreme Court picks. Roberts/Gorsuch have been (big) disappointments. A Biden pick will be disaster.
The Biden people can‚Äôt be happy about this. A pissed off NRA voter is the last thing they need in PA, OH and WI.
policies put Americans in the ground. Quit killing us! Biden prefers us alive, so yeah he's got our vote. #TrumpFailedAmerica
Yes. The Durham Report. He calls it obamagate but he will falsely accuse Obama and Biden with a crime and try to jail them.
Mr. Biden,   Meet your pick for Attorney General,
I'm down with getting him out no doubt but I just cant vote Biden. Maybe Kanye will get in there
I don't see a lot of Biden voters changing their minds to Kanye.
Joe Biden Insults Afro Americans &amp; tweeter stays quite.
Agreed. Biden is smarter than that.
Joe Biden is corrupt to the core. We will know this fact in detail soon.
HE IS DAMN RIGHT! BIDEN IS A MARIONETTE FOR CHINA AND OTHER FOREIGN COUNTRIES! OBAMA IS PULLING HIS STRINGS  SO HE CAN FINISH D DESTRUCTION OF AMERICA!PUT AMERICA IN A SILVER PLATE FOR ISLAM! BECAUSE HE IS A ISLAM WORSHIPER! IT  WILL  B D END OF AMERICA! TRUMP IS OUR SAVIOR!! !!
Is this the same Joe Biden who thinks it's okay to kill unborn babies? That Joe Biden?
To Biden, today‚Äôs slander is tomorrow‚Äôs pander.
Well, Biden is hurting God, apparantly I don't have any water despite that shower I took earlier so now I might have to move to Thighland.
Joe Biden just reclaimed his time. (Satire Dems) He noted that the New Democratic Party as witnessed at the AG Barr hearing gets unlimited do overs, in his case 47 years to actually accomplish something for America now that he has made his family wealthy.

Biden is fearless. Got it.
No way Joe Biden wrote this.
They need to implement a comedy show staring Biden. He would get a lot of polical laughs
Riden with Biden..Dump tRump
Well he and Obama left a pandemic playbook and a fast response team. Both Trump threw out. Biden also listens to experts and doesn't believe 'it will just go away'.
I love it when your tweets sound nervous- and Biden is closing in- so much for the so called MAGA leader.
You like to kill people with guns and claim religion. Wh'ats the difference? See, Joe Biden can't have an abortion. Not really his decision.
I‚Äôm definitely not a fan of #Biden and he‚Äôs does say some stupid shit. But I‚Äôd literally almost vote for anyone over an incoherent wanna be authoritarian with chin flaps and a awful hairdo like #trump. I enjoy democracy too much. So fuck it #Biden2020
I don't care. Vote Biden!!!!!
The debates will set you free. I understand that they are setting it up like a game show.  The candidates will be allowed to call a friend for help answering questions. The glitch is that you get one call for every year in politics. ‚Ä¢President Trump 3 calls  ‚Ä¢VP Biden 47 calls
I asked because you said you wouldn‚Äôt stand for Bass. The only way you could not stand for her is to vote against Biden.
At least I was able to canvas in Ottumwa, Iowa, make calls and campaign for Biden‚Äôs rally last March. But that was the last big group of people I attended due to COVID. üòè Darn Trump‚Äôs incompetence! Obama/Biden never let Ebola touch our shores! ü¶ã
I absolutely love Kamala Harris. I absolutely love Susan Rice. Biden should choose the person he wants to work with actively as his right arm. Both women are off-the-tracks amazing.
You‚Äôre so emotional. Doesn‚Äôt your side have a better candidate that Joe Biden?
Democratic voters heard Biden say Trump won't be getting any breaks, one presumes that means no pardon, which is the only way the president can be involved in a prosecution.
But let me guess you don‚Äôt want Biden to debate right?
1 Biden shouldn't be involved at all in prosecuting him. It's proper for a presidential candidate (before Trump) to never go there. To go there, ironically, would be Trumpism. As long as Biden doesn't say we need to "put it behind us," or other code words.
Can't vote for Biden. Sorry. He's sad.
Biden better win because if I have to hear people complain about his VP selection being the decisive factor, and not like Trump sabotaging the post office, I‚Äôll lose it.
BBC News - US election 2020:  says opponent Biden will 'hurt God'   YOU FREAKING LIAR!  TRUMP DOES NOT KNOW GOD!
Missouri. Little hope but I'm voting anyway. And my immigrant wife will be voting for the first time as a U.S. citizen‚Äîfor Biden!
I hate joe biden and trump equally. I hate all of you. Where's all my independents at mane?
If Biden is strong enough to hurt God? He doesn‚Äôt need the presidency. He could just smite trump.
Recently we put my father in the ground. He belonged to a local AOH chapter and was prolife. Biden walks lock step with the baby killers, aka Planned Parenthood. Any Roman Catholic that goes to the grave actively supporting abortion, will be spending the afterlife in Hell.
He's got my vote
That's why I always vote &amp; I will be voting for Biden because I just can't see Myself voting for Trump.
People thinking Biden is a *practicing* Catholic:
I‚Äôd pay money to see Joe Biden attempt to say all of the countries and regions you mentioned in your tweet. That might just take him 20 minutes to complete.
"were tough as nails." ~ joe biden.
The rapper's paperwork to make ballots has been aided by Republicans in Colorado, Wisconsin, Ohio, Arkansas and Vermont
I gained a lot of respect for you over the past three years. This column eradicated all of it. Biden could pick Kanye West as his running mate and I‚Äôd still vote for him. Nothing would be worse than 4 more years of the Presidunce and VP Pray Away the Gay.
Projection? This was a video of Joe Biden himself talking. Lol
Melania is for sure voting for Biden
I have never agreed with any of Biden's policies, but it's very disturbing &amp; upsetting to see Biden decline before are very eyes. When the Democrats are willing to use &amp; belittle a man to gain power, what else will they do. Cheat,lie, and steal an election. #Trump2020 #voterID
Overheard a mother at my daughter's volleyball practice say, "If Biden is elected, we'll have a socialist in the White House. Our country will be ruined." I laughed out loud when I heard this. So loud that every parent in the gym looked at me. And I kept laughing.
Biden is against high powered weapons and for background checks. That‚Äôs it. He‚Äôs not taking away your guns. He supports a VOLUNTARY buy back option if you want to give up your assault weapons.
This election is against candidate #DonaldTrump and the radical left. Joe Biden is a mere shell of a man being used by the Democrats to GAIN POWER. They don't care about nothing else, they are willing to embarrass Biden. No human decency. #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver #MAGA #KAG
If Joe Biden's family cared about him, they wouldn't let the Democrats use him. My God love your father/husband more than you hate Trump. #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver #MAGA #WalkAway #TrumpTrain #follo4follo #KAG #FreedomOfSpeech #BuildTheWall #VoterIDNow
Who predicted Biden sacrifices his black Queen to open up a line for the Latino Knight &amp; Bishop..?
Interview with me on  show about election threats, Cyrus Vance, NRA crackdown, Trump's attacks on Biden, more. My segment starts 20 minutes in:
God recently made driving a classic car, sporting aviators, and looking cool a sin, and Joe Biden is guilty as charged.
And people realize that just saying Biden is ‚Äúback to normal‚Äù mean going back to what? Invading countries like Iraq, crime bills, favorable policy to corporations increasing the wealth gap, continued ICE raids..some people just think..is normal basically just a less extreme Trump
idk if you have tracked it but biden has ads up in missouri
Fred Fleitz: If Biden skips debates with Trump here's how our enemies will read it  #FoxNews The left want to do away with debates, because they have to flurt with telling the truth.
Aint this the truth! Major cities across America are being ripped to shreds with unending violence, yet you don't see Biden nor his party say a word about it. Reality doesn't fit their narrative, so they simply ignore it.
Biden door knocking (by their own admission) looks like
Ben Shapiro warns Biden 'falling apart' after bizarre interview, would be 'ripped up and down' if Republican  #FoxNews Actually Biden has finally said how the Democrats feel about blacks. It's  about time you spoke the truth on behalf of the Democrats.
What freedom?????). Give me a break.  I doubt you can even define communism but that‚Äôs not what Biden is about.
Obama got on the phone, promises were made to Buttigieg and the others in exchange for them dropping out and coalescing just before Super Tuesday, and the rest is history.   Now, Biden might still win b/c Trump is a massive dumbass and botched covid terribly.
Joe Biden could delete my vintage Pok√©mon Yellow save from 1999 and I would still vote for him. #SettleForBiden
Biden is a paper tiger that was propped up by the MSM and the entire corporate Dem machine as "electable" even though he had never in 3 runs at the presidency ever won a single state's primary. He was the only option they had in their Stop Bernie campaign. This is all documented.
The Black community has no diversity according To Joe Biden. WTF? What do they have? Hopefully not your vote. #Trump2020LetsSaveAmerica #MAGAROLLERCOASTER  #VoterIDNow #FreedomOfSpeech #BuildTheWall
Amen. Biden has kept the faith.
Right. Some of us are willing to make the grown up decision and vote Biden since he is 100% clearly the better candidate regardless of who his VP is.
There is no such thing as fake dirt on creepy joe biden, it‚Äôs all real dirt.
Anybody that tries to paint Joe Biden or anything he does as working class deserves to be bullied ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Clearly you don't know how our voting system works.  A vote for anyone other than Biden is just helping Trump.
Current POTUS using God, the Bible, and other rants  against Biden is an indication DJT is similar to a rabid dog. He strikes at anything that moves towards him.
Ok sure, on the "saying dumb shit" front, I'll grant you, they're pretty similar. But I just don't see the institutional decay and pressure testing, the blatant trampling of norms and a legitimate constitutional crisis in a Biden Admin. I am not convinced, Bret. Trump's gotta go.
A debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Both trying to make the other look older. Boring. But ok.
seeing a biden ad in missouri just goes to show his internal polling shows that missouri is a battle ground state.  more polling needs to be done in missouri.
We could ask the same question about  taxes. Biden has released his, why hasn‚Äôt #TraitorTrump?
This person is really trying to paint Joe fucking Biden as working class, hilarious
Such a weirdly cynical thing this is  Forbes: Exclusive: Kanye West Indicates That His Spoiler Campaign Is Indeed Designed To Hurt Biden.
Brb as soon as I'm done laughing at your lame ass attempt to paint Biden as working class
The point is to pick a few votes off of Biden here and there such as Wisconsin   There is a method to the authoritarian playbook
Hi Jim, this is Reality calling. There might be one or two states that went for Biden over Bernie in the primary that won't be going for Trump. K bye
Mr. Trump today said "Thigh-land" in place of "Thailand" and yesterday said "Yo, Semite" instead of "Yosemite."  Neither of those stories is on CNN, Fox, or any other news source of any size right now.  And BIDEN gets a pass?
at least Biden goes to church on Sunday instead of a golf course
Its not that fucking hard. It is trump and pence or biden. That's the choice.
Biden IS A REPUBLICAN. Do the homework. Check that record.
But he thinks Biden has insulted blacks more.
Exactly; Biden is a life long Catholic and Trump holds the Bible upside down.
Trump is going to get nailed in a Biden-Democrat Landslide on November 3.
This is my Male cat hiding from a dog. Biden could pick him for VP and I'll still vote for Biden.  But seriously, all of the human candidates' names that have been thrown around are exceptional and would be a great VP.
At least Biden doesn‚Äôt have to ask a staffer to ‚Äúfind a Bible for me.‚Äù
Well he's not his gun guy and Biden can't speak for Beto. Literally no one is talking about beto anymore.
If you don't vote for Biden, you're voting for Trump.
Joe Biden Says He Will Stop Building Border Wall, Supports Health Care For Illegal Aliens (VIDEO)  via
Never Trump means voting for Biden and supporting Biden on TV and on Twitter.
Apparently Biden will hurt god &amp; take our guns. Lol.
That's what they do. They deflect &amp; ignore the dumb ignorant stuff he says and only focus on Biden.  There are no good choices in this election.
Sooo what has Trump said or done racist towards black people?? ü§î...or am I missing something. The fact Joe Biden said "All black people are the same" after he said "You ain't black if you don't vote for him"
I mean it‚Äôs forbes so I believe it but im conflicted because it hasn‚Äôt picked up any steam I know for a fact ye doesn‚Äôt like Biden for the black comments and doesn‚Äôt like the democrats in general because they don‚Äôt do anything for us so it‚Äôs not surprising
To Biden and centrist Dems that love to talk about how everyone just needs "access" to care, how do you explain this? There are thousands of stories like this every single year.  This country bankrupts you for daring to need the health insurance you pay every month to have.
Remember what the late Cardinal George wrote and what Biden has vowed to do as President?
While I'm very happy with Biden as our nominee, I often ponder whether Kamala would have won the nomination for president if Biden hadn't sought it.
Bizarre rant? Ask The Little Sisters of the Poor or Hobby Lobby if it was bizarre. Biden will end Religious Liberty between rescinding the HHS Mandate and his Supreme Court picks.
fall. The only thing that may save you is Biden and the socialists. People just won‚Äôt vote making a close election.
Not surprised. The cops love Biden.
I‚Äôve actually seen one Biden 2020 sign in my cop-filled Boulevard Heights neighborhood.
If you look at the full video and transcript, it‚Äôs clear that Vice President Biden was referring to diversity of attitudes among Latinos from different Latin American countries.
Biden will ‚Äúhurt god‚Äù? I‚Äôm just going to leave this little ditty here for you DJT.
Dude Joe Biden number 1 and Obama number two tour so fixated on those people I see who controls your mid frame
If all Biden did was point out the Latin communities' large political diversity, I doubt most people would have taken issue. But his strange decision to clumsily bring up the black community, and his failure to explicitly clarify language used, is rightfully met with sketicism.
How Biden became the candidate is beyond me. Oh wait.. I know. DNC money.
I slap my friends‚Äô hands when they say dumb stuff. I get it from Ma cause she did it to me. Does Biden have a friend like this?
A person who bases their choice of Biden or Trump on the vice presidential pick really has no set of beliefs about the world and the way it should be.
That tells you what Drumpf is about because he‚Äôs projecting his evil on Biden
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time that a Democrat crossed the invisible picket line to condemn both the ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù and the mindless violence in our cities.‚Äù  ‚ÄúUnfortunately, today‚Äôs Joe Biden is not that Democrat.‚Äù  Good read from a Dem Trump supporter..üëá
I was in Florida last week I saw trump flags everywhere. I only saw one Biden flag and that was in a hard core blue browsed county. Shocking
Because, even if they'd shared the entire context in the initial tweet, (the OP does go on to link the full video) his comments are still at the very least questionable. Plus, we can't act as if the black community's concerns with Biden start and end with this single comment.
This makes no sense. Biden and Trump couldn‚Äôt be any more different.
Do Trump supporters and the people on the fence not get it that Joe Biden is a centrist not a liberal?
Claire, Biden‚Äôs faith teaches abortion is intrinsically evil: same-sex marriage is forbidden; no Communion if in mortal sin; and religious freedom. He is not a faithful Catholic.
If Joe Biden could just shut up for 3 months and stop making idiotic comments, that would be great.
Trump also used his trip to Ohio to talk trade, telling workers at a plant, 'I will stand up to the foreign trade cheaters and violators that hate our country.'
I muted all words containing political names (trump, Biden, pence, etc) and words (senators, Congress, etc). It‚Äôs always some biased article or headline and it just got exhausting trying to read every day.
I KNOWWW it actually drives me crazy that the same people who denounce Trump praise Biden and it‚Äôs like??? Aren‚Äôt y‚Äôall sick of picking between the lesser of two evils when they‚Äôre both evil
CNN VP rips ‚Äòreally gross‚Äô attack on Joe Biden‚Äôs Catholic faith by right-wing website
This is sickening. I will vote for Biden but only if zi like who he picks as Veep: Really ? Do I guess S.E. Wd Esther have an authoritarian adulterer serial killer as president than a woman for Veep she doesn‚Äôt like:   #veep
Everyone who knows shit, knows Biden was the man on the grassy knoll.
Have you seen Twitter polls or in depth analysis taken which show black users mostly think Biden's statement was fine?
Biden, Gore, Humphrey is the sample?
Biden for president of the AAR.
Well I would ask Chris if he‚Äôs paid attention to who Donald trump is. He will debate every night on tv if he could.  So what does this tweet even mean unless your trying to get the president to tweet back at you ??? Biden doesn‚Äôt want debates. It‚Äôll be a blood bath #Trump2020
Trump is giving  a lot of power if he thinks Biden can hurt the Bible and hurt God! What a moron!
If Biden actually made an  incredibly racist remark, you would be cheering it on as you usually do when racist remarks are made. Don't try to act as if you have a moral compass.
FFS.  Please    tell me how senile Joe Biden is.  It's only Thursday and this man with all the best words doesn't know how to pronounce Yosemite and Thailand.
Joe Biden [as Eminem's "Rap God"] "I'm beginning to feel like a Hurt God, Hurt God!..."
Vote against trump or don‚Äôt. You gotta follow your conservative conscience I get it. But Biden doesn‚Äôt have to capitulate to republicans demands in order to get their vote.
Expect when they are granting Ivanka patents or granting her immunity to tariffs. Trump's clothing line is made there too. Biden will be tough on China's human rights violations. Trump commits human rights abuses on the daily.
Not Joe Biden.
I don't know where you're going with this. You are the only person I've ever seen argue that Biden does not have constituents in the Democratic party.
"The manipulations that white men make in order to advance themselves and their interests are normalized ‚Ä¶ but woe betide those very same women should they get too excited about their own advancement."
One would think that with everything else, God would have bigger things to worry about than Joe Biden.
They also need to let Biden talk about guns. Guaranteed he understands and respects the 2nd Amendment more than Trump.
I'm black, and I've said nothing about voting for Trump. Don't assume everyone who acknowledges Biden's faults is a Trump supporter, lmao
Soooooo, if you don't like Biden's vp pick, you're voting for Trump??  Are you sure? üòÆ
Joe Biden needs to prove he can read his own watch at this point. His cognitive decline is real, and stunning. He's even divulging long-held D party theology. They really do believe they own black vote.    They've gotten away w/ playing hide the ball for months, that ends soon.
Tell us how you really feel Joe Biden!  via
Biden‚Äôs whole campaign should be just let Trump continue to ramble....
Joe Biden is further right than Reagan.
Thanks for bringing us together Rose! üíôü¶ãüåä #StrongerTogether  #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica
Trump's comments were not about Joe Biden's personal faith but what he would to the constitutionally protected right of freedom of religion : He would destroy it with rescinding the SCOTUS ruling for The Little Sisters of the Poor and with his Supreme Court picks.
Aww, Michelle Obama has mild depression, bc of racial strife, and the trump admin. Are YOU FUVKING KIDDING ME?!?! It sounds like she just doesn‚Äôt want it on display, and wants to go back to brunch, because *NEWSFLASH!* This shit has BEEN going on, under her husband &amp; Biden incl.
They have to convince people they'll lose their 2nd amendment. Just one more BS reason to vote for Trump. Lies,  gaslighting, bullying, convincing his supporters that this is what Biden wants to do. Wonder if Trump himself gave the tip, so he can appear the hero. What a LOSER!
Biden wouldn't block Trump's prosecution if the Justice Department pursued it  #FoxNews when Trump is reelected, He will not stand in the way of your prosecution, or Obama Bin Ladens.
"Excuse me," Biden reportedly said, "What does God need with a starship?"
If you don't want Biden's weird comments to be spread, tell him to stop making them, especially if he expects to be handed the presidency because "at least he's better than Trump," lol
Joe Biden has the power to hurt G-d! He is more powerful than G-d?
If Trump would have said anything, in the ballpark of what racist Biden says, that fricken puppet Lester Holt, White racist, would have it in the news for weeks.
And next he'll ask to see Biden's birth certificate.
So, did anyone ask a follow up question like ‚Äúhow will Biden hurt God exactly, will there be nuclear weapons involved?‚Äù
He is.
Biden raises eyebrows with remark contrasting African American, Latino diversity  #FoxNews Hey corrupt media, this story should be front page for days. I know you are going to bury this shit. The media is going to pay for this corruption. 4 more years,Trump
All of this to slam Biden and try to garner more votes bc Trump is desperate to win. He will do whatever it takes to divide the country, piss on the constitution, and take away ALL your rights! He's trying to normalize taking away constitutional liberties. But only for the left!
‚ÄúGod‚Äôs honest truth, my word as a Biden‚Äù = BULLSHIT. That family is CORRUPT AF.
Mannnnnnnn! I felt this. GWB was ass but he ain‚Äôt got nun in Trump. Hell Biden steady saying slick shit about black folk and he think Mfs ain‚Äôt listening!
I'm so glad there are apps that can turn what I imagine in my head into reality.    May I present to you my brain when it hears: "Biden vs. God"
Biden from the top rope....
50 Years of Joe Biden's Racists Comments
If Trump had said this we'd be letting him have it too. Biden isn't exempt.
Yes, Biden can hurt God, as tRump said, he can definitely destroy Coronia with the snap of his finger. We need Joe to stop out Coronia.
50 Years of Biden's Racist Comments
This afternoon in Ohio, phony "Christian" Donald Trump made an unhinged suggestion that Joe Biden would "hurt the Bible" and "hurt God." America needs to vote this man out! #Biden2020 #VoteTrumpOut
Instagram claims bug favored Donald Trump over Joe Biden #stl #TrumpTrash
So Christian Trump supporters  Trump said Biden was against the Bible? Then later doubled down to say Biden was against God, and not only that but if elected Biden was going to hurt God  So how much blasphemy from Trump is still okay with you?
Biden supports killing babies, so...  Zero Pinocchios
This afternoon in Ohio, phony "Christian" Donald Trump made an unhinged suggestion that Joe Biden would "hurt the Bible" and "hurt God." America needs to vote this man out! #Biden2020 #VoteTrumpOut
Making Biden sound like Dr. Manhattan
I have my issues with trump but they are not left wing idiot problems, but he still remains to be the best choice. If the lp candidate had any chance I'd vote for her but it's just not going to happen her messages will be suppressed and it could help that corpse Biden win
I so fucking wish I could vote for the Biden that lives in Republican cognition instead of the Biden of the real world.
Sure! But Joe Biden‚Äôs dad wasn‚Äôt a first responder was he?
umm...care to comment  Does Biden hate God?
For the Republicans to use a person with mental health problems for their own political gain is absolutely disgusting to me. The Republicans will do anything to win this upcoming presidential election. It's all about putting the best candidate  in the Oval Office. Vote Joe Biden.
Imagine wanting Trump to *stop* helping Biden look good.  What are you doing?
How about Joe Biden is better.
If there was a god, and Joe Biden could hurt him, I just wish he would.  But as long as we're playing make-believe, I get to cast spells and transform into a magic dragon!
We've had 4 years of the jackass and his sorry excuse for a administration. Why in the hell would we sign up for another 4 years of the same bullshit? Don't fall for it again America. Especially black us African Americans. Stay focused on putting Joe Biden in the Oval Office.
I agree. Catholic Americans are very familiar with Joe Biden, and I think are less likely to find him "too liberal" or a "puppet of the left."
Currently watching Trump speak in front of a bunch of cardboard washing machine boxes at Whirlpool Corp. HQ, hitting it out of the park.  Contrast that with Biden trying to show-off his Corvette coolness, and babbling incoherently (sad to say that).  Why is this even close?
12:01 Jan 20, 2021  ‚ÄúNot even God can stop me now...‚Äù  -Biden
LOL, Joe Biden didn't say anything remotely offensive, it was a statement of fact on basic political thinking and positions.
Wow!  is so powerful that he can hurt God? Wouldn't we want someone like that on our side? Mr. Biden's next ad should be "I can hurt God...you BETTER vote for me!" #VoteBiden
Biden just woke-up from a 70-year nap and rambles about his pre-conceived stereotypical notions of "blackness."
Whoever Biden‚Äôs team picks for VP will be the real person running for President. My guess is they are hoping Biden wins and then have him retire right after he takes the oath of office.
Remember: They said Hillary Clinton was sick and wouldn't even be able to last the first term.  She is alive and well.  Biden is gooooood
Trump Calls Biden‚Äôs 'Junkie' Remark To Black Journalist A 'Great Insult To The Black Community'  via
So Biden is now an all powerful being who will engage in one on one battle with God?
And some people really thought Bernie could not beat Trump..?   Not only will it be a resoundingly fat L if he loses to one of the least apt candidates ever to run, in Joe Biden, but it will also be a referendum on all the stupid shit he has had a hand in over the last 4 years.
But the 2nd Amendment! The NRA! But but but Biden! üôÑ
This ought to get you banned again.  Biden is pro-guns and has his own to prove it. Do you have to lie to stand any chance?
I support Biden but I don‚Äôt think he disses people for using scooters or needing oxygen. Try talking your parents into using oxygen if the time comes that they need to, after they‚Äôve heard you talking like that.
I'm PRETTY sure God is bigger than Joe Biden.  And I'm QUITE certain He's bigger than Donald Trump.
But Biden isn't egomaniacal or narcissistic. He actually cares about the Americans AMD his country, while Trump wants to be able to watch it burn once he's forced out. What a POS!
part 2578 of joe biden getting away with stuff trump would be thrown out for
Lol, Trump won't let the Media ignore this from Biden.
I'm convinced Biden is doing everything he can to make me dislike him, lol
This meme also works because, just like Benedict, Biden doesn‚Äôt actually care about us and will completely ghost on progressives the first time that he is pressed by his donors.
With a cocktail, on a yacht, pants unzipped, not his wife, nothing here to see folks, all innocent.   Meanwhile, ‚ÄúBiden is against God‚Äù  These fake Christians are unbelievable.
Racist heresy aside, this is also unnecessarily divisive and politically idolatrous.   In a better age, such a leader would be relieved of duty.
Of all of his many grifts, he's the worst at the religion one. Like, he doesn't get the genre or the gestures enough to even fake it. Biden doesn't support Christian values‚Äîdoes this...hurt...God? Here's a Bible‚Äîwhat do you do with it? Hold it in the air!
Is it true God? Has mean ol Mr. Biden been hurting you?!
Trump takes out an ad which features Biden praying (though images were doctored for other reasons) then says this.
Republicans actually believe Biden is afraid to debate this jabbering lunatic
All part of his effort to get African Americans to vote for Kanye, taking votes that would otherwise have been Biden's. When can we call his efforts of election interference? This is beyond ridiculous. It's blatant and obvious! #CheatingTrump!
Biden clearly holds blacks in contempt. Whether it‚Äôs telling them they‚Äôre stupid to not vote the same way, that Obama was exceptional bc he was ‚Äúblack &amp; articulate‚Äù, or now ‚Äúthey‚Äôre not diverse, like Latinos‚Äù; the patten is the same.  No amount of woke policy support fixes thisüëá
new slogan: Joe Biden. He knows which end of the bible is up (and he‚Äôs read it).
Biden shut the fuck up and stop putting your foot in your mouth challenge
Can you say if this is consistent with a Biden +10 national? It's obviously a larger shift than that from Clinton-&gt;Biden, but I don't know the demographics of this district (e.g. education level, etc.)
The Left needed #COVID in July to happen in September. It didn‚Äôt cooperate..üëá  Instead, by October #COVID will have flamed out, a vaccine will be around the corner, school closings will look stupid, &amp; all key economic numbers will be trending upward.  Biden better have a Plan B.
If I could be 100% honest with y'all, I'm voting for Biden even if he personally comes to my house, throws a brick through my window, and sets fire to my bushes outside.   On election day I would vote, then go buy some plywood and some plants and call it a day.
Isn‚Äôt that what folks said about Obama/Biden?  New York is filing on behalf of NRA members who were cheated.
Dawg no way people want to vote Biden I don‚Äôt believe it
Got me wondering who are Joe Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúnotable exceptions?‚Äù Right and wrong answers only lol.. I‚Äôll start: Stokely Carmichael and Dennis Rodman.
In no way is this taken out of context. What are even talking about?
You ever left your city? Black people on the coasts aren't like Black people in the Deep South or the Mid-West or the Southwest.   Also, just because older Black people are on board with Biden doesn't mean that the youth gives AF about him.
This is why Trump and his folks can never be pleased, something the benefits them they still see as somehow being a leftist plot against them. Always the victim  CNN: Instagram's algorithm blocked negative coverage of Trump, but not Biden.   via
Who thinks this is a good plan of attack on Biden?
I guess I just wonder how many people are going to be moved by the details of policy differences between Trump and Biden. The teams are kind of set, I think.
Joe Biden must be hella strong if he can hurt an omnipotent deity.
Wait, wait . . . Biden is going to ‚Äúhurt God‚Äù? What does that even mean? How is that possible?
In that sense, its not a binary choice. If you're a DC resident and want to vote for the next president, you must vote for Biden. If you want to vote for someone who won't be the next president, then fill in the blank however you choose.
Wait, so that would mean Joe Biden is secretly Rick Sanchez.
The point that  is trying to make, is that in DC, the decision is already made. DC will go for Biden, regardless of whether he votes Biden or Trump. He can vote Biden, Trump, or Darth Vader, and it won't impact the outcome of the election in his municipality.
Liar. Trump is hurting the Bible and God, NOT Biden. #Biden2020 #TrumpIsNOTAChristian
The reason why I liked Duckworth so much is that she represented a Midwestern Rust Belt state (among other reasons). Although Illinois is obviously going to go blue no matter what, Biden needs to make sure that he doesn't lose Michigan and Wisconsin again.
The Obama administration let Bush and his cronies go free for all of their war crimes, there's zero chance Biden would do anything to Trump.
Oh. Ok. It‚Äôs just yikes city today for Biden I see.
Biden‚Äôs most conspicuous crutch...
Someone call Biden's campaign HQ and find out if anyone pulled a muscle while cringing during that interview.
You're all good. I'm just tired of talking about Covid and Trump/Biden is all.
Reporters need to ask the Biden Campaign if the "notable exceptions" are the Obamas?
Instagram's algorithm blocked negative coverage of Trump, but not Biden - CNN What happened to the alleged ‚Äúliberal‚Äù bias in the media?
It does have makings of flypaper for dems. The best way to react for Biden et al is to express confidence in a fair investigation ava that the NY AG is doing her job and return to the Trump failure du jour. Not to engage in a loud public dialogue that serves Trump's interest.
I'll vote for Biden and whoever he picks for VP. The other choice is fascism. But this moment demands massive change, and unless that change happens by pushing Biden further left, we're going to repeat 2016 in 2024. Trumpism is a symptom of a much deeper problem in America.
Biden saw the polls showed him winning and just said ‚Äúfuck y‚Äôall‚Äù.
Just watched the video. So, he supports reallocating funds that are being mishandled. Not ‚Äúdefunding‚Äù. Check out this article from yesterday.
And this is not to suggest the debates shouldn‚Äôt happen or to be any kind of a defense of Biden. In principle, I still feel like they should. I just also don‚Äôt think they matter. So it‚Äôs hard for me to care much.
I live in Illinois near St. Louis.  I see some Trump signs and very few Biden signs.
After what Kellyanne Conway put on Twitter about Joe Biden, I suggest she take a look at this compilation of only a sparse amount of the gaffs tRump makes.  tRump cannot talk clearly AND he can almost never finish a sentence!
Perhaps I'm alone here, but I question the timing of this.  I've grown very weary of lawsuits &amp; appeals that lead nowhere, so why announce this 90 days before an election?  As unreal as it may seem, there are people on the vote Biden/Trump fence who now will use this against us.
Joe Biden Calls For Defunding The Police  via
Awesome. I love it when our leaders support women's healthcare needs. Just another reason to vote for Biden over Trump.
And what Joe Biden said was right. Black people really do think as one. In previous elections we have voted 90%+ for the Dems. That's very disturbing and most of that comes from people telling us to vote Dem all our lives.
Joe Biden pretty much slapped black people in the face twice and he still gonna get about 80% of the black voteüòÇ.
So...if your boss decided to ‚Äúredirect‚Äô some of the funds used to pay you thereby you taking home less money would you consider yourself defunded?  On July 8th Biden clearly stats that funds should ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù be redirected from police.  Playing with words to bail Biden out!!
What did Biden say bout Black people that Trump tryin to capitalize on?
This has absolutely nothing to do with guns or the 2A.  Anyone who thinks it does was never voting for Biden in the first place.  The NRA played a stupid game and won a stupid prize.  Sucks to suck.
I can‚Äôt even blame Joe Biden for that rhetoric, Black people call other Black people a ‚Äúcoon‚Äù or ‚ÄúUncle Tom‚Äù when they have a difference of thought.
There doesn‚Äôt need to be one, it‚Äôs a landslide victory for Biden
you don't think the fallout from the timing of this decision is going to soil Biden and other liberal Senate hopefuls?  I feel like it might be like gay marriage being a wedge issue and bringing conservatives to the polls who would otherwise have sat it out.
This! There may be a constant drumbeat as we move forward to the election exposing Russian corruption and money laundering and overshadowing the Biden-Burisma hoax.
It's funny how all these socialist larpers are proving that they've never driven a manual transmission car by clowning Joe Biden for saying that super innocuous line.   Get on the same team.
If I was Joe Biden I‚Äôd continue doing me, not like I‚Äôll lose votes. Biden could call everybody mama the b word and he‚Äôll still bag votes lmao.
I generally agree, but it‚Äôs also nonsense to believe that NOW Biden is going to change tune and create sweeping change.  We‚Äôre f‚Äôd again
It‚Äôs time to throw  Biden some bucks. I‚Äôve been giving to mostly local candidates but now the primaries are over that is less necessary.
I rather politicians show their true colors like Joe Biden and Donald Trump instead of the continuous pandering.
Gunowners are too smart to fall for this trick of the liberal New York AG looking out for the little people.  This is how these people try to shut down the only organization that has stood in the way of Obama, Holder, Biden and Susan Rice from taking guns away from Americans.
I guess you really approve of Trump then?  Don‚Äôt be a sore loser, even Bernie is begging for his supporters to vote for Biden!  Don‚Äôt disappoint him!
Can you imagine the ‚Äúbrainstorming‚Äù meetings at the White House  ‚ÄúSo Hunter and obamagate fell flat‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat about the Bible?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat about it?‚Äù ‚ÄúTrump can say Biden is against the Bible‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that even mean?‚Äù ‚ÄúWho cares, his base will make it mean something‚Äù
No I‚Äôm just not embarrassed to be me.  Didn‚Äôt vote for him last time either, but Biden is a dumpster fire as well and it‚Äôs a sad state of affairs we‚Äôre in politically
As Biden would say ‚Äú come on man‚Äù what are you talking about? Just plain stupid.
Because Biden offers NOTHING, not even his empathy.
Amen brother - manufacturing another hoax.  How much you wanna bet the ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù would have been gone by mid-November if Biden won (which he won‚Äôt). üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏TRUMP 2020üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
Well, unfortunately Biden offers nothing to young voters, not even empathy.
Interesting how you changed the subject. Okay, I'll play. Federal employees have been contributing overwhelmingly to Democrats FOR DECADES. Of course they endorsed Biden.
Which one? Because the Obama/Biden administration put brown babies in cages too
Get your paper and pencil out and write out all the pros that Trump has done so far.  If by chance you are blinded by your bias, I will help you. Now tell what Biden has done in 40 years of politics besides filling the pockets of his family with $$...greed...power...

yeah that's entirely untrue. the litany of times biden has been confused where he is and all the pics of him sniffing and licking lil girls far surpass trumps last 3.5 years.   keep guzzling the koolaid tho
Do you want our economy to collapse? Trump is fighting an all out battle. Words slur‚Äîso. Are you so perfect that you don‚Äôt make a mistake. There is a difference of occasionally slurring a word and out and out insanity coming from Biden‚Äîbeing closeted for what reason‚Äîgaffs...hmm
Seriously. ‚ÄúBut trump‚Äù is not a good argument.. Biden is blue diet Trump. We should all be demanding #ReplaceBiden This POS racist rapist is UNACCEPTABLE.
Biden doesn't deserve our vote. What is ge offering? What will he do for us? He can't say. And his policies have shown where he stands. Pick the lesser of 2 evils? Righteous people don't choose EVIL.
Biden will be a no-show at the debates because his overseers have chosen to run him as a generic opponent to Trump: window dressing to hide their radical Leftist agenda.
Yes! Biden needs to do this when they debate.
How can people be voting already? Biden hasn‚Äôt even accepted the nomination or identified a running mate.
How y‚Äôall voting for Biden is beside me üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Joe Biden gone pander to Black people to reel em back in like some cattle.

I keep hoping that Biden will just come out and say that he supports democratic capitalism, the free market moderated by democracy.  It IS what he believes, but sometimes wonder if Dems are afraid of the C word, capitalism, right now..

Biden: "I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue, screaming out the n-word and I wouldn‚Äôt lose voters."
Quick tour of the future: 1. Barr's DOJ will release bullshit "report" on Biden in late October 2. NYT, MSM will understand that it is bullshit, just like Barr's report on Mueller 3. NYT, MSM will treat new report as potentially explosive bombshell, with moon landing headlines
The black community a must see . They are getting involved. I am impressed as they should! They need to know, liars operate within the Political arena. The weird thing about Biden. He makes statements and when you check! theres no history at all. Like he's paying google to remove
Biden's best attack is to just let Trump keep talking!
Give me the other reasons why Trump would be so dangerous. Are you willing to have Biden who is afraid or rather mentally incapacitated lead the world against China/Russia .  Give me a legitimate reason why you hate Trump so bad.
The only black people who would vote for Kanye wouldn't have voted for Biden anyway.   This was stupid, short sighted, and hella insulting.

"I believe some of these Republicans re-finding religion on debt/deficit right now are genuinely freaked out"  &lt;--- No, they're freaked out by the prospect of a Biden administration. They spend and borrow as much as they want when they're in power. They're scared of losing power.
It‚Äôs ALL bullshit. Biden didn‚Äôt ‚Äúwin‚Äù shit
But not a bad roadmap for what will likely happen after the election, assuming Biden wins.  Wouldn't be surprised if they even started calling Trump a closet democrat again, because it makes the narrative a little easier.
After being laid flat by Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúI passed a dementia test‚Äù roundhouse, Biden regains his footing with a devastating ‚ÄúI know how to drive a car‚Äù counterpunch. What‚Äôs next in this heavyweight battle?
Yes, Fox attacks on Dems hold generally up a mirror to GOP vulnerabilities. If Trump weren't losing his marbles, they'd be using some different talking points on Biden.
Biden: "I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue, screaming out the n-word and I wouldn‚Äôt lose voters."
It‚Äôs political. The left wants to lock down the country til after the election. They can‚Äôt have a population who isn‚Äôt scared,  who works and goes to school cause heavens forbid they might not vote for Biden.
‚ÄúI trust Joe Biden to get this virus under control.‚Äù
Awful..üëáüèº  Don't have full context, but Biden was likely attempting to justify ruling out a Latino VP versus requiring a black VP.  In other words, begging Latinos to vote for him (because they know they're losing them, in droves).  Identity politics always consumes itself.
Um. Comparing the two, Biden is way worse. It‚Äôs sad.

Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt have to campaign, he just has to let #TraitorTrump talk.
1/1 Dear President Trump, why is it that the Democratic Party can get away with any crime? Are they above the law of which the rest of Americans must abide in? People who have had information against the Clintons keep mysteriously being murdered, including Biden.
Biden is a corrupt disaster; Even his sentences are corrupt to the point that they make no sense.  President Trump had a good run and I supported him for quite awhile, but he just can't get it done...just too much arguing between him and the false media and others alike.

God, and the Bible, when biden walks in the room:
TOO LATE, Mr Biden,  YOU ALREADY SAID IT, YOU MEANT EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID.  That WHAT you THOUGHT &amp; THAT is WHAT SLIPPED OUT.
Well biden is basically brain dead....
oh 100% i hate them both don‚Äôt worry üòÇ biden may forget but when he doesn‚Äôt he can speak üòÇ
Ok but politics aside, have you heard any of the times that biden completely forgets what‚Äôs he‚Äôs saying
Be nice to Biden  He is gonna over see your punishment.
That's because you already support him. Some of the people who voted for Trump might vote for Biden if he refutes effectively the lies Trump tells. You and I know it's BS but not everyone does and they need to hear it and see it.
So this person would rather have four more years of Hell on Earth with Trump if they don‚Äôt like Biden‚Äôs VP pick? WTF? How short sighted can you be? We are trying to save America.

Um sure!  Good luck with Biden, AOC, Maxine,Nadler and all the other goofballs in the Dem Party!
As far as political affiliation goes (Republican vs. Democrat), African Americans do tend to skew heavily Democrat. Latinos, on the other hand, do have higher levels of support for the Republican Party. I suspect that's what Biden meant, but he didn't state it very well.
So, everybody's jumping all over Biden for one stupid comment while ignoring the constant stream of stupidity coming from Trumps mouth. Anyone who's looked into political opinion polls understands what Biden likely meant.
And people freak out over one stupid comment Biden makes...  Seriously, do they never listen to Trump speak? I'll take the occasional verbal stumble over this any day.

This is a clever way of voting for Biden without having to answer for how he‚Äôs not fit for the job.
It‚Äôll go one of two ways. Either Biden wins and steps down after inauguration or trump wins by a landslide. Personally i think it‚Äôll go the first way. Fact is trump wouldn‚Äôt even have that chance if Bernie was nominated
Clearly a bot, but ironically not far off from the answers I'd expect the real Biden to provide...
No matter how Republicans alter Biden‚Äôs image or how many lies they spread, it doesn‚Äôt make Trump any more electable, more capable or any smarter.Trump shows us who he is every time he speaks, stumbling over simple words, refusing to answer questions, ducking and running. Coward.

This is the truth.  Trump can only con you for so long.  Vote for a man of integrity. Vote for Biden to rid America of the Trump plague.
Mr Biden SHOULD TAKE a COGNITIVE TEST EXACTLY LIKE President Trump has,  Mr Biden's RESPONSES  are VERY DISASSOCIATING,  SOMETIMES MAKE NO SENSE, his POSSIBLE PRESIDENCY SCARES ME.
I also hope for a message of unity. So far, a lot of Biden's rhetoric has been more in that vein, and as far as Democrats go, he's one of the least scary ones you could pick in order to appeal more to centrists.
Save America from total destruction by Trump. Neither Bernie nor anyone else should get your vote if you really care about the fate of our democracy.  Failure to cast a vote for Biden is tantamount to casting one in favor of Trump,the fascistpiece of shit destroying our country.
Sorry, cant tell who you are talking about. Trump or Biden? Only one has wished maxwell well. Only one is being investigated for fraud. Only one one cant run a charity....bc of fraud. And only one was elected BECAUSE he is an asshole.
It is going to be a landslide for  will be obvious November 3rd the mail in count will be done quickly. States that do mail in are good at it.The only delay will be pulling Trump out of the White House in January!   Stop trying to scare people and think.
We can stop him with Joe Biden!!!
Imagine what it will be like November 4th if Biden wins. I have two gun stores within two miles of me and will be first in line at one of them when they open.
I think Biden needs to step up his game. Create the momentum like he did in primary/caucus period before COVID. He has my full support, but there are some undecideds that are leary due to the accusations made by GOP.
I talked with 2 yesterday. Another problem is many aren't hearing anything from Biden. If it was 2016 you would see clips from his rallies on the news at least. Trump is on TV every day
Then we need to make it better. VOTE Biden

Will continue and the media will be grabbed by the balls. Biden may not be what some people want but by not voting for him the chose petty beliefs over any chance of change in the future.
What anyone who refuses to vote for biden is saying is they have no long term goals. If trump remains in office he will stack the supreme court. They will remove anyone who could fight his policies. Americans who go against trump will be labeled as terrorists. The war on science
What rally has Biden had
B. Honestly do you advertise for biden? You guys keep listing the best things about him. Also who photoshopped your pic? Your gums look smaller
You‚Äôre a huge Biden supporter tho
The smartest thing Biden can do is to just let Trump do exactly what he is doing now with his incessant insanity and stupidity.   Biden just has to let Trump continue to self destruct.
No it won't.  MO is nuclear waste.  Her on the ticket guarantees Biden defeat.  Unless there is the continued push to steal the election like Nevada just did.
Am I a super enthusiastic and excited Biden supporter? No. Do I think he‚Äôs better than Trump? Yes. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm supporting him, since I feel we need to remove Trump from office.   I may disagree with you if you‚Äôre voting third party, but in no way will I voter shame you.
Why would any Biden supporter have been attending a Trump rally?
We plan on it, that's why we are voting for BIDEN. You Plump Trump and your Trumpetts have done enough damage.
Not that you're wrong, but there are a lot of black people who love biden for better, or worse. Their votes matter, and he seems to have a large percentage of them, so...
Why? By the time they get the actual money, they will be moving out. Perhaps they want to put in surveillance equipment to spy on President Biden
I think the only one that knows anything at all about Biden's process is Joe. For all you know, he made his choice long ago. I'm so tired of people speculating on it like they know anything

I disagree. Successfully moving even slightly to the left with Biden would give the progressive a more positive look in our country. Also, with the sweeping progressive wave coming to Washington this election and the next, I think we will begin to see some real change.
Biden will not get you all the progressive reforms you want in the next 4 years.   BUT, he will stabilize things and reverse some of the Trump administrations actions regarding climate change and immigration. Then we can make some progressive changes. #Biden2020
I‚Äôm actually not a Trump or Biden follower. Both are effed. But I believe that of the two, Biden is less fit to run a country just based off his mental capacity. That‚Äôs neither here nor there. It‚Äôs a 99.7% survival rate, they will be fine I promise. Have fun not winning the WS.

This obviously isn't Biden Tweeting 17 times a day. Are you guys at least taking care of him? Feeding, watering,,,, getting his pills? This is bordering on elder abuse
Obvious to everyone at this point Biden is running nothing. He isn't Tweeting by himself, he can't answer a question in public without wandering into "Neverland" Who is really running this thing?
There is no point to this because hypocrites like  who call Trump a liar, will never hold Biden accountable for his wrong doings and the constant lies he has told for 40 years. It‚Äôs only Orange man bad for them.
I didn‚Äôt say Trump lies, you did. I said Biden lies and you don‚Äôt care. And I can prove Biden lies becasue he has been caught plagiarizing, lied about his entire college career. He lies constantly yet you say the whole problem with Trump in a debate that he lies your a hypocrite.
Good question. I voted for a 3rd party candidate in last election as I did not trust Trump or HRC.  With Biden I trust him but worry about his mental health. I am hopeful he picks strong vp candidate.
I believe Biden is being controlled, He's Obamas puppet.  Can't speak for himself because he's too deep in the Swamp.  Scared to death to get off script.  Maybe a little dementia?
I believe it will.  Media has become such a shit show.  My President is Busting his Ass to save us.  I look at the facts.  Biden's a lying, paid for by Osama Obama, joke.  If he knew how to save a Country, he should've told Obama.  Come on man.  Watch stuff jump.  Indictments!
So, he‚Äôs a bully and now so are you? If you‚Äôre a Biden supporter, I‚Äôll make sure to mention you everytime he screws up too. Can‚Äôt wait!
59 years of presidential debates and now Biden will likely bow out.  There has to be a way to force him to a non-partisan evaluation.  Every American who cares about this needs to stand up and start making a loud noise.  We need to be heard.

üòÇ healthcare is a serious issue for many of us. That is why  ‚Äòs healthcare plan is so important to get passed. I know you and Rocky disagree, and that is OK. But be careful what you ask for. When Rocky loses timely access under Biden, you will feel differently.

I‚Äôm glad he is protected. Everyone will be protected by Trump‚Äôs plan. Today everyone is not. Biden‚Äôs Medicare for all, and that is the plan to keep Bernie supporters on board, will not protect Rocky. Ask anyone in a country who has it.
Bernie Sanders proposal, which is where Biden is heading is a failed model. People die while their free healthcare is rationed out. I‚Äôd love to be proven wrong. The ACA has been a disaster for my business. Maybe your business faired better.
This is like a bizzare movie sequal for Weekend at Bernie's. Sadly, old Dead Bernie looked more alive than Biden.

As far as political affiliation goes (Republican vs. Democrat), African Americans do tend to skew heavily Democrat. Latinos, on the other hand, do have higher levels of support for the Republican Party. I suspect that's what Biden meant, but he didn't state it very well.
So, everybody's jumping all over Biden for one stupid comment while ignoring the constant stream of stupidity coming from Trumps mouth. Anyone who's looked into political opinion polls understands what Biden likely meant.
And people freak out over one stupid comment Biden makes...  Seriously, do they never listen to Trump speak? I'll take the occasional verbal stumble over this any day.

This is a clever way of voting for Biden without having to answer for how he‚Äôs not fit for the job.
It‚Äôll go one of two ways. Either Biden wins and steps down after inauguration or trump wins by a landslide. Personally i think it‚Äôll go the first way. Fact is trump wouldn‚Äôt even have that chance if Bernie was nominated
Clearly a bot, but ironically not far off from the answers I'd expect the real Biden to provide...
No matter how Republicans alter Biden‚Äôs image or how many lies they spread, it doesn‚Äôt make Trump any more electable, more capable or any smarter.Trump shows us who he is every time he speaks, stumbling over simple words, refusing to answer questions, ducking and running. Coward.

Mr Biden SHOULD TAKE a COGNITIVE TEST EXACTLY LIKE President Trump has,  Mr Biden's RESPONSES  are VERY DISASSOCIATING,  SOMETIMES MAKE NO SENSE, his POSSIBLE PRESIDENCY SCARES ME.
I also hope for a message of unity. So far, a lot of Biden's rhetoric has been more in that vein, and as far as Democrats go, he's one of the least scary ones you could pick in order to appeal more to centrists.
Save America from total destruction by Trump. Neither Bernie nor anyone else should get your vote if you really care about the fate of our democracy.  Failure to cast a vote for Biden is tantamount to casting one in favor of Trump,the fascistpiece of shit destroying our country.
Sorry, cant tell who you are talking about. Trump or Biden? Only one has wished maxwell well. Only one is being investigated for fraud. Only one one cant run a charity....bc of fraud. And only one was elected BECAUSE he is an asshole.

What anyone who refuses to vote for biden is saying is they have no long term goals. If trump remains in office he will stack the supreme court. They will remove anyone who could fight his policies. Americans who go against trump will be labeled as terrorists. The war on science

I disagree. Successfully moving even slightly to the left with Biden would give the progressive a more positive look in our country. Also, with the sweeping progressive wave coming to Washington this election and the next, I think we will begin to see some real change.
Biden will not get you all the progressive reforms you want in the next 4 years.   BUT, he will stabilize things and reverse some of the Trump administrations actions regarding climate change and immigration. Then we can make some progressive changes. #Biden2020

I read it. Here's my thought process. Trump is evil as fuk. He has to be voted out. If there was a better option that Biden, I'd choose it. If Bernie was still running, I'd vote for him over Biden no problem. But right now, I'm voting for the one person that can beat Trump.
Challenge Trump to take that cognition test live on TV.  Biden can take it right alongside him.  Trump likes gameshows, let's have one.
Probably. It's best Biden doesn't participate in Trump's game show.
The most frustrating thing a bully can face is a victim that never reacts. There's not satisfaction in it. Without Biden standing there reacting to Trump, all America sees is all the different ways Trump is trying to beat up an opponent that has risen above the mud slinging.
If lying or making misleading statements is a grounds to not debate someone well, there will never be another political debate if those are the Rules of Joe.  But isn't Biden the guy who lies and doesn't even KNOW it?
So, the faction that failed to beat Biden, and who doesn't want Biden are the "winners" here?
Anyone who thinks Biden will save anyone from this problem is part of that problem. If by half the country you mean the 46+% that didn't vote, then you may be right, but no one is successfully rallying them to end the problem because every loud voice demands allegiance to Biden.

Trump should be sailing toward reelection. The fact that he isn't is troubling. A lot of people would like a return to normalcy right now. Every time Trump has a Twitter tantrum, people are reminded that Biden would be different. People are tired.
Vp is the most worthless job i literally dont care who it is. People are fucking crazy if they think biden will die in office. Architect of the crime bill and was a vocal supporter of the Iraq War/Patriot Act. That fuckers never gonna die, evil people dont die. Ex: Kissinger.
Only if biden dies immediately.
From CNN: CNN analyst: This is the latest sign that Trump is in trouble.

Don't give trump a platform for his conspiracy theories.  From CNN: Political analyst makes plea for Biden not to debate Trump.
Joe Biden could pick a running mate at 11:59pm Nov 2, 2020.  Fine by me.  Less time for Russia to offer a counter-attack. Fewer tweets ranting on the individual from POTUS.  Win-win, followed by a win.
Listen jack, I love you too baby girl and I love you too baby girl and I love you too baby girl  ...I think my Biden is broken

If he wants, hopefully, Biden will get him back in service. It would be too bad to waste his expertise and loyalty‚Äîsomewhere in NSA, probably.
Good!   They need to do some serious catching up with the RNC.  Hoping Biden is having a great day too.  Saw a text a lil while ago that they wanted to raise an additional $8 million or something before midnight.
For all we know, the Biden camp already knew about Bass and her Scientology comments as well as her past stances on Castro/Cuba.  Most of these sources that are leaking probably aren‚Äôt truly connected to the campaign in any way yet the media is amplifying them like they‚Äôre fact.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden
How many votes would this swing be if Biden received non-Hillary numbers?
do you see the way biden touches, sniffs, and rubs young children? all on camera?
Hey.. did you hear that Biden wasn‚Äôt crazy about trump trying to delay the election? How does that plate of crow taste? You people at fox are the best comedy on tv... keep up the show.
All of you who called Biden crazy for saying trump might try to move the election must feel pretty stupid now. Thanks to all of you for being the joke of the day!
‚Äúthey‚Äôd rub up and down my hairy legs‚Äù -biden
I know but the timing of the announcement keeps getting pushed back.  Biden has had much longer than both Obama and Clinton did to pick his VP.   No reason for him to not know who he wants by know.

He's not even a leftist, he's just a moderate who doesn't believe in anything. It's the most basic position to take, requires the least though, and is generally the most popular. Biden is trash, Trump is trash. This may be one place where the left and the far right can agree.
I hate Biden, but I hate Trump‚Äôs reign of terror more
It‚Äôs not like Bernie or the Green Party and all aren‚Äôt significantly better than Biden and Trump, but it‚Äôs taking more votes away from Biden and essentially just handing them to Trump. Exactly what happened at the last election 4 years ago.
And unfortunately I think we are going to end up with 4 more years of Obama if Biden wins. I really believe Biden is gonna pick barrack or Michelle as his running mate.
Only way Joe Biden is gonna win in November is if he picks Barack or Michelle Obama as his running mate. I honestly think either one of those is a strong possibility.
Every single one of those pics has been proven to be innocent in nature by accounts of all parties involved. Top left, for example, is Sen. Coons‚Äô daughter. Biden was trying to connect her with his daughter so they might be friends. I know. What a monsterüôÑ
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!!!  EVEN THE SLOW KID THAT WEARS A HELMET IN CLASS, IS BRIGHTER THAN DROOLIN, DEMENTIA ADLED JOE BIDEN.
So, what is your argument for Biden? If you think we should vote for him, make the case to me as a Bernie supporter.
If Biden is the law and order candidate, then my name is Hezekiah 'jumpin' Jehosaphat.  His crime bill caused generations worth of socioeconomic damage to the black community, unapologetically. Both he and Trump would or will functionally change nothing, thus the problem proceeds
Ok, so you're gonna ignore the full context? He said he legitimately believes Joe Biden is unwell, and he thinks the guy is being taken advantage of. Its weird you think voters should toe the line instead of political establishments running better candidates.
With Biden's age, one would have to assume he will be a one-term Pres. So, the VP choice should be his best choice to run in 2024. Harris, maybe. Warren, maybe. Duckworth? Rice? There are several who might fit the bill. Who knows? It's his choice.
Just finished reading the Biden-Sanders 110 page unity agreement. Radical left wing document. Restores federal funding to Planned Parenthood, and would use tax dollars to pay for abortions.  This is but the tip of the iceberg.  Read the document for yourself.

I know we have different view points on politics, but I still love you guys like my brothers. No love lost on my end!   If Trump wins, I‚Äôll buy the rounds. If Biden wins, you guys buy.   Fair?
This might ease my concerns with Biden/Harris/Clinton winning this year... if Trump remains on the horizon, I can fantasize that perhaps that will keep things somewhat sane in the meantime.
Biden will never do that!
Empty bluster like everything else you've ever said. The constitution does not give any president the authority to delay an election. Authorities will clear any trespassers out of the White House following Joe Biden's election.
‚Äúsuggesting a delay in the election is an extraordinary breach of presidential decorum‚Äù:  on that Trump tweet this morning
I will gladly risk my life to vote for Biden. And as a Texan, without another option, I‚Äôll have to do just that.

My only argument in favor of Biden is that it's likely he will get a supreme court appointment if he wins. It's likely gonna be a centrist if Biden wins, or a right wing maniac if Trump wins. Unfortunately, it forces me to choose biden. Though, I do see the points from the right.
Boris Johnson is desperate Biden to beat Trump ‚Äì and it‚Äôs clear why | John Rentoul
Normally we get very credible hints when the VP announcement will drop.  Remember in 2008 we knew about Biden before it was announced due to him getting Secret Service protection.It sounds as though you may have voted in a primary in state #1. It‚Äôs not possible that you would have already voted in the Nov election since neither Trump nor Biden have officially been nominated. You should be fine to register and vote in state #2.
Can you tell your uncle and his daughterWife(which is really creepy the way he acts around her)to just give up? Resign? Walk away? Take McConnell, Pelosi, and Biden in tow and allow The USA to right itself, kick covid19s ass, and move on from this 4 year dark age nightmare?
Don't forget energy. Trump: Biden is against energy  Fact Check: Biden lives in a house with electricity.
Not ignoring Trump just pointing out hypocrisy. Obama says 58 states and media says slip of the tongue. Biden says black crack, you ain't black, etc and media ignores. Trump says Thigh land and the world is supposed to end. Pols can't admit mistakes, including your Biden.
At traitor John Lewis funeral he turned it into Trump bashing and Biden campaigning.
There is quite a difference In leveling accusations of racism, which Dems do to Trump constantly and pointing out real racist comments. I hate to break it to you but your monoculture comment is a racist one just like Biden‚Äôs comments were.
When did Biden? What is different between when Trump says "that's not what I said" and Biden saying  "in no way did I mean to imply"?
I'll try one more time and then I'm done. Nowhere in Biden's statement does he say the words 'wrong' or 'mistake'. He is not admitting that he was wrong or that he made a mistake.
That goes to the question of who is ‚ÄúGod‚Äù? Is the god Biden might hurt the jealous trickster one who tortures people to test their fate? Is he the punitive god that indiscriminately wipes out the good &amp; innocent with fires &amp; plagues to show displeasure? Does that god take bribes?
Biden does the same. At least he tries
Scratching my head here. It is like you didn't read either Biden's tweet or mine. You know damn well you'd never give Trump a pass, let alone the praise you're giving Biden.
Biden don‚Äôt play dumb no one likes a liar and destructive evil piece of nothing Obama obviously can be President George Bush you can come to
Biden didn't say he made a mistake or that he was wrong. He said that's not what he meant. Had Trump said the same thing media would be attacking him right now, not praising like they are with Biden.
If Biden's got that much power, then you should definitely vote for him!
I only like gods that can't be hurt by Joe Biden

Pointing out things Biden is doing wrong isn't us helping Trump,  it is Biden helping Trump

If Joe Biden can hurt God, he's got my vote.  If there is a God, He has a lot to answer for.
This makes Biden sound like a jrpg protagonist.   Which makes it easier to vote for him, honestly

Holy Shit, Biden is bad ass.   If he has the power to hurt God, it‚Äôs best we not anger him by voting against him.
I just had a customer ask me if I was voting Biden or Trump in November. First of all, sir, this is a recorded line. Secondly, you couldn‚Äôt pay me vote for Trump.
It isn't to HURT Biden, it's to HELP Trump! That is the mindset we must use...  #KayneWest
Wow!! Not only is Biden an atheist, but some type of god himself that can hurt god and hurt the Bible. How can trump beat such a foe?
Just that Biden arrogantly presumes he knows what a black person thinks, or ANY person for that matter, blows ME the fuck away. That demented moron doesn‚Äôt know what HE thinks minute by minute...proven EVERY time anyone views his videos.
My dad just called me the best daughter ever. Do we think I can leverage this to change his vote from tr*mp to Biden?
Based on US history, when an extreme crisis hits, the population votes in the challenger, regardless of who they are or what they‚Äôre offering. That is the probable outcome in this case as well. It‚Äôs probably the only way Biden even had a chance, but here we are.
speech impediments, I don't see this as a sign of mental decline.   There are a lot of things to criticize Biden over, but criticizing him over something that I, a person in my 30s, do regularly, just leaves me cold.
Biden is so far gone he insults people who are asking him questions to find out if they want to vote for him. He is just a puppet and you are blind if you don't see it. But in his words "if you don't vote for him you ain't black" racist much ?
Wouldnt he first have to have the support of the black community in order to take votes from Biden? I mean he had crowdfund his last album, how much support from the black community do you think he actually has, if anything he's taking votes from trump.
Biden Beat You
I believe that Bill Kristol asked about 150 thousand Americans that have died on Trump‚Äôs watch. Neither Biden or Hunter have gone into hiding. By the way, have you been in his basement? Were you spying? I do believe someone should check you out.  Becky
Joe Biden is too scared to go to Milwaukee for the DNC convention. What a cowardly decision. #DNC2020
Why is the potential commander in chiefs mental state a ridiculous thing to be concerned about? Biden isn‚Äôt young
What a ridiculous headline. A cognitive test is administered when a neurological event has happened. Are you suggesting Biden had an issue??
Funny how everyone thinks Trump is to blame, no acknowledgement for taking this unprecedented road unlike Obama and Biden /w H1M1 stopped testing and gave up when Americans needed help!
Biden won‚Äôt travel to Milwaukee to accept Democratic nomination amid coronavirus concerns
Somewhere, a Biden staffer:  "Joe! You will not die! Trump is President! You are not Trump, Joe!"
Lmao it‚Äôs always funny when liberals make excuses when the reality is Trump will wipe the floor with Biden. It‚Äôs also funny that Biden lies constantly, even had to drop out of a presidential bid in 80s for lying, yet they don‚Äôt care that he lies. Ok kid
Enthusiasm for and against candidates is a fascinating concept to poll:
This is hilarious. Please take a look into anyone in a position of power in that party. Biden, Obama, Pelosi, etc.
OK, the paper is done. A1 for Wednesday:  ‚Ä¢ Independence schools adapt and prepare. ‚Ä¢ Independence using CARES $ for utility bill relief, etc.  ‚Ä¢ Metro officials look at COVID rules. ‚Ä¢ Sexism in debate over Biden VP. Plus Annie Dear, Ron Finke and a freaky caterpillar.
re Biden fact check so  is lying?
Sad to say, but if you are a woman on Twitter, you are all too aware that Biden‚Äôs VP should be prepared for an onslaught of online misogyny.

You guessed it, Joe Biden is out of Trumps mouth
You are aware Biden wasnt kneeling because the of the flag right? He was talking to a child and knelt to be on thier level while speaking to them.
Obama didn‚Äôt name Biden until Aug. 23 in 2008. H. W. Bush didn‚Äôt announce Quayle until Aug. 17 in 1988. This idea that Biden is taking forever to name a running mate is ridiculous.
I agree he's a disaster... but shouldn't biden want extra debates with this moron?
This is devise and she hasn‚Äôt been the focal point of that talk in weeks.... why? Do not insult the character of advocates like her just to make a point. Biden and his campaign make that decision not her.
Granted the Queen would most likely knight Biden thats not the point. He waa talking to a child and got down on thier level to speak with that child. Unlike trump he just rapes them and throws money at them and makes threats on thier families before leaving afterwards.
Joe Biden remembered the horrifying attack on Hispanics in El Paso, then again that‚Äôs what real leaders do....
Trump has been an empty vessel for the past 3 years. He is surrounded by empty headed yes men. Voters will vote for Biden because he will be a strong leader. A leader that won‚Äôt blame everyone else for his lack of knowledge in everything. Becky
NO MORE OBAMA'S &amp; BIDEN'S!!
While trump hides behind 12foot walls in the white house and tweets lies and conspiracy theories from the bunker because he's afraid of the American people.  Why would Biden waste money on huge events when trump is winning Bidens campaign for him anyways?
I agree,  sadly Biden is bad on 5 of these issues.
Are you serious? He is telling the truth &amp; documents, not hearsay, are proving how vast the lies &amp; deception went. It started at the top- Obama, Biden, all the way to the top of the FBI, CIA,  NSA, &amp; down the pike of his cabinet &amp; admin. Obama was the orchestrator.
Documents released prove that the President did NOT lie. Obama, Biden &amp; other  democrats attacked the President through lies, deception, corruption with the bogus dossier, division, with a complicit media repeating the narrative. The ultimate goal is control over all the us.
My anonymous sources have confirmed that #Biden has chosen #Satan as his #VPPick
We'll see how the results (and turnout) shakes out tomorrow. 7 of the STL Wards didn't go Clay 18/Biden 20 (14 wards) or Bush 18/Sanders 20 (7 wards). So it comes down to how turnout for other races splits for MO-1?
He'd vote for Biden if he actually earned his vote.  He's just hiding in his basement and letting trump defeat himself.
He's actually the only one with substance.  All of his issues are policy related. What's your favorite Biden policy?
Lmao all these people liking this tweet like Joe Biden wrote it himself.... You guys are funny
This satire right? Biden has been a POLITICIAN for 43 years and responsible for some of the worst policies ever for African Americans. He also can‚Äôt even express a coherent statement, and that‚Äôs not arguable. Voting for Biden is definition of insanity and your too blinded by TDS
Biden will win for himself, true, but a strong woman VP will be a wonderful win for all of us women, and girls growing up in a country that once , just 100 years ago prohibited us from voting. #GoJoe2020 . And let‚Äôs work on #BlackLivesMatter

A completely senile Biden still makes more sense than a thoroughly "competent" trump. I guess the idiot works for ya.
The loyal followers on Fox News are worried. Steve Hilton‚Äôs ‚ÄúNext Revolution‚Äù tonight was three worried commentators feeding off one another. Sara Carter convincing the others that Susan Rice will be Biden‚Äôs VP pick.

It seems so obvious but so many people just don't get it. The good news is that Medicare for all is supported by the majority of people, too bad Biden isn't interested in representing the interests of his base.

Its too bad Biden doesn't actually have a platform or talk to the people in any kind of meaningful way.
Actually, shouldn't even have Biden and Trump in the same room considering how reckless Trump and his people are with this pandemic.
And the Imperial March as he walks in...after Trump is already at his podium. I could totally see Biden giggling over it. ü§£
Well you didnt even attempt it in the first 4 years so why would anyone believe you'd start now? Start packing cause Joe Biden will be moving in soon. You will be starting crate training in prison.

So you're voting Biden? Since trump is known child rapist and had Cohen handle hush money payments to kids he raped. Where as Biden has never been accused of raping a child.
Let Biden win Florida, Texas , and Ohio make it an onslaught
This Biden voter is VERY frustrated.  Frustrated because we have to out up with the traitor Trump until January.
Yes. I think Biden has been pretty clear about his plans &amp; we know who he is.  Trump lies constantly &amp; would just yell over Biden or say fake news every 30 seconds.  I honestly think people know who they are voting for &amp; a debate won't sway anyone at this point. #Biden2020
It should be a forgone conclusion that Biden is much better at...everything. Anyone in denial about that is ignoring reality, which is Trump's entire base.
Biden tweets like a sheet of white paper lmao
So those polls aren't phony? Which polls are phony and which aren't? I see individual polls everyday that Biden is up 10. So which are real and which aren't? Just for my own edification.
If Russia facebook ads are influencing voters for Trump, that means they are influencing Biden voters to switch to Trump. So basically that means Biden voters can be influenced by fake social media. I knew they were dumb, but really?
Maybe he should call off testing like Obama and Biden did or maybe he can travel this unprecedented road to show everyone he does care about mankind
The president is traveling an unprecedented road with COVID and mistakes can be made and will be made unlike Obama and Biden just walked away because they had no answers!

Trump can‚Äôt do it on his own. But, with how some of the resent Social Media hearings have gone, i bet there would be support from both sides if the app is determined to be so bad that even Biden campaign made every staff member delete from personal and work phones immediately.
I think Biden Political team made everyone delete it off their phones earlier this week.
Biden is not well
Got a Biden video ad and it was him talking to the camera "I have a question for you, can I ask you to join my campaign" and it was the same tone I would use to ask somebody to pick me up from the airport at 4am
Franklin Roosevelt was the best president in our nation's history. The crisis that Joe Biden will inherit, assuming he wins the election, will give him the opportunity to have the same sort of positive impact as FDR.  Here's hoping he takes full advantage of the opportunity.
I cant wait for Biden to win either in November as well. I also cant wait to see trump hauled off to jail in 2021. Get your safe space ready.
Joe Biden didn‚Äôt really create the office of Vice Presidency, or the office of Congressman.  Those jobs were kinda there.  Obama‚Äôs admin created more jobs it‚Äôs last three years than have been created under Donald.

In this analogy I do, of course, think of Donald Trump as the "platter of shit with bits of broken glass" and I relate "how the chicken is cooked" to whether Biden will actually do anything about the climate crisis, jobs, and health care, or just talk about these critical issues.
Mr. Secretary, you took Con Law at a more prestigious school than I did, but I aced l &amp; ll so apparently I got more out of it than you did. There's no "legal determination" to make. He doesn't have that power. He's just trying to plant seeds illegitimacy when Biden wins.

‚ÄúWe are not aware of any evidence supporting the claims made by President Trump,‚Äù the National Assn. of Secretaries of State said in a statement.
So that if Biden wins, he can fan the flames of his base to make it seem like he didn‚Äôt lose legitimately. This won‚Äôt change the results, but it will create a perfect reason why he can leave office while never admitting defeat. It‚Äôs Pride.

You are so sad and scared and pathetic its not even funny. Its amazing your malignant narrassasism wont let you drop out and losing to Biden is going to kill your ego. I cant wait to watch your head explode November 3rd!
It's amazing to me that you have the ability to determine who people vote for without them having told you.  Sounds a whole lot like Biden's "you ain't black" mindset.
Nope.  Democrats can't afford to put Joe Biden out in public and allow him to answer questions.
Biden is a problem for all
That would be awful to picture should Biden become president seeing that he has dementia and doesn‚Äôt know where he is half the time.  Why do you all like violence and destruction  so much?Biden‚Äôs quote on Black Americans was taken wildly out of context.  Should he have said it?  Probably not, but in terms of voting Biden is absolutely correct.  You see more diverse voting habits in the Latino community than in the black community.  Again though shouldn‚Äôt have said
‚ÄúYou will know them by their fruit.‚Äù Aside from Biden‚Äôs powerful defense of a genuine faith, the man‚Äôs literacy is just so dang refreshing.

Actually telling us about a guy who actually a record of going to church every Sunday. From a guy who hardly ever set a foot in church. I am sure Biden will win that debate any day of the week.
Whoever wrote this tweet for Joe. We don't believe you. He has a long history of statements about minorities. My Father told me years ago... "When someone tells you who they are, BELIEVE THEM" He's a racist, he tells us all the time.  We believe him. Bye bye hiden Biden
The President is right, Biden has failed to honor oaths made to God, the Catholic Church, and to the Nation in trust with God, he does attempt to "hurt" God by persecuting those who believe in Him, and by refusal to adopt policies which agree with life, and "you know the thing".
President Trump supports policies that are in agreement with America's Constitutional trust in God, Biden never has.  Biden is not a man of "deep faith" nor even in alignment with the policies of the Catholic Church, let alone the Bible.   Biden lives this one verse, Romans 1:21!
Thanks for the update, Jim! We the people who voted for him, like it! He doesn't take a salary from us taxpayers, and then break his oaths and promises, like Biden does.
I just had a customer ask me if I was voting Biden or Trump in November. First of all, sir, this is a recorded line. Secondly, you couldn‚Äôt pay me vote for Trump.

You know there are other alternatives to Biden.

It will never happen. Even more so now that Biden nor you will answer questions of the reporters. And double more so if Biden doesn't Debate Trump himself. We are beginning to realize that Biden is hiding because he can't answer questions nor Debate. Time to change parties
Biden &amp; Kamala rising is very bad omen for me &amp; it seems for Trump too so we have to work on getting them off our backs. Someone changed the color of my pc background to pink &amp; I hate it. I did not do that, so someone else is controlling my pc which I bought with my money. Bad.
I also got this runny nose &amp; nose block going on for almost a month now started since January, they are not letting us breathe - mostly on the right nose. It has gotten worse after June 2020 when Biden polls rose &amp; Trump is getting lower rating. Everything is worst this week.

The only question remaining in this election cycle is, what are the Republicans going to do when they are the minority in DC? It's over. Trump will not win. I am that confidant. Biden's team has got all Trump's plays covered. Trump knows he is done.
Thank you  #BidenHarris2020 let's do this
Biden's team is very aware of Trump's treasonous actions with the post office. Don't you think there will be lawsuits before the election? I am not worried. This will be an ass kicking on Trump.
It is not my problem that you cannot walk and chew gum at the same time.  [It is within the realm of possibility for one person to loathe both Trump and Biden.]
Think about this. Biden is from Delaware. Democrat win. Harris from California. Democrat win. Pence from Indiana. Repub. Win. Trump from Florida. Democrat win. Trump is the odd man out. Biden-Harris 2020.
Relax Democrats. Biden will win. Breath. Trump late night election steal will not happen again. One reason, people are tired of the lies and treasonous acts against America. DC will be dominated by the Democrats.
Only number Joe Biden needs is 270. The electoral college has myriad options for Biden. Biden is neck and neck with Trump in red states. This speaks volumes. Trump's road is so narrow. Biden 2020.
Truth üé¨ domino Biden almost down!

when does Biden do an actual interview by someone who's not his friend?
The photographer posted an edited version of Joe Biden's 2020 campaign logo.
BIDEN ABOUT 50 YRS OF PUBLIC SERVICE, NO ACCOMPLISHMENTS, RACIST.  THOUGHT OF BLACKS AS INFERIOR RACE.  VOTED WITH KLU KLUX KLAN SO THEIR CHILDREN WOULDN'T GO TO SCHOOL WITH BLACKS.  BIDEN WROTE CRIME BILL, RESULTED IN MASS INCARCERATION OF MINORITIES.
Vote for Biden. There is no perfect candidate, just as there are no perfect people.
Harvarti is very underrated and a personal favorite of mine. Also, I am voting for Joe Biden but that‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt mean I like him.
BIDEN ABOUT 50 YRS OF PUBLIC SERVICE, NO ACCOMPLISHMENTS.  ABOUT 8O YRS OLD, BRAIN SURGERIES, POLL EVEN DEMOCRAT SHOWS DEMENTIA.  OFTEN DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS.  WAS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE SAID IN VERMONT, HAD ON NO MASK.  SAID RUNNING FOR SENATE CAMPAIGN HIDING HIM
As I drive around Kansas City (MO) area for post mates I‚Äôve seen a total of 3 Biden signs.
This has got to be the most racist thing I have ever heard a politician say, good thing it‚Äôs a dumb millennial who‚Äôs typing, we all know his boy Biden created this system
I am excited to endorse the presidential ticket of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.  They are ready to tackle the crippling issues facing our country with the urgency and seriousness they deserve.  #VoteEarly #VoteOften #BidenHarris2020
Joe Biden isn't a sensitive little bitch like Trump so he was able to put his big boy pants on and move on.
He said it at a campaign rally in February, dumbass! The entire month he did nothing to prepare our country for the worst pandemic in 100 years. Called it a hoax by the Democrats. And for the record, again I am not a Democrat, not a Biden supporter, but Trump has got to go.
How many days before the election will Barr announce an investigation into Biden and Harris?
Yep, I‚Äôll celebrate by electing Biden/Kamala
Right? Bernie is a bit too crazy now for me. But Kamala and Biden are hardly an answer either.
I thought the very same thing. What‚Äôs Biden got to do with it? Why use his pic? That way if anybody googles it, his pic comes up insinuating he was involved? Bloomberg = original dirty trickster.
Virginia mayor urged to resign after saying Biden picked ‚ÄòAunt Jemima as his VP‚Äô A lawmaker has been asked to step down after comments about vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris
Hear ye, hear ye - people over the age of 45:  Ultimatums and shaming folks about not agreeing with you (now, in regards to the Biden/Harris ticket) has never, in the history of the world, counteracted hopelessness.
Biden is not going to have an administration.
If you really don't see the difference between Biden and Trump, you're lying to yourself.   I 100% support a #GeneralStrike. Wouldn't a strike be more effective with Biden in office?
The Undertold, Undersold Story of Kamala Harris
The postal workers union endorses Biden-Harris. Never forget roughly 100,000 US Veterans work for USPS and their livelihoods are on the line.
Lol, offended so easily! Give an example of Trump being a racist? I‚Äôll wait....  ‚ÄúBecause poor kids are just smart as white kids‚Äù or ‚Äúc‚Äômon man! You ain‚Äôt black if you don‚Äôt vote for me!‚Äù Quotes like Joe Biden! (And you can even spell Trump correctly)
It's Biden and Kamala who are getting highs in polls while people are all dying all over the world not just in USA
Just been listening to CNN and Trump answering questions from reporters? I can‚Äôt believe how they allow this clown to lie and not one of them challenge him? Bashing Joe Biden with false statements and blaming Dems, non stop?  This is the worst country in the history of America
I hate you you are not black and I pray that not a one black person vote for you fake b.tch.And your sick partner diaper Joe Biden. Go to hell you and your party.
if you have information on Biden release it. Why don't you just go ahead and resign instead of joining Trump to change our democracy into a fascist country. I consider you a traitor and it is sad.
It's been all over Twitter where I saw,along with audio of the call made from Ukraine officials to Biden,how they fired him and changed their laws to accommodate further bribes apparently lol,try to keep up
Fake of day is seniors going for Biden Euthanasia top of list.Cutting social security and Medicare is insult to seniors.
The staffer on the Biden campaign who discovered this should get extra ice cream today.
Immigrant children were reported by the AP as being locked up as early as June 2014 under Obama/Biden. Our choices r the guy that said he wouldnt tear them down or the guy that set them up?  You allude if she doesnt vote for the ‚Äúright‚Äù candidate those kids are ‚Äúon her‚Äù
Does Joe Biden even write his own tweets? #BidenHarris2020
You can‚Äôt just say whatever you want that libelous not to mention you‚Äôre being fact checked constantly but the thing is, facts or not you‚Äôre living in a FANTASY WORLD.  600 lawyers FOR THE BIDEN TEAM, are they expecting legal trouble?
I‚Äôll get it when the Biden administration says it‚Äôs safe.
I stand by that Biden will be a GOOD president.
Mike Pence said that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are going to take your meat. If that happens you can no longer go to a meet and greet. It will just be a greet.
Joe Biden could walk up to me and stab me in the side and Kamala could walk by and spit on me as I lay there on the ground bleeding and I WOULD STILL VOTE FOR THEM.  I would.
You‚Äôre digging a deeper hole. Don‚Äôt play word games. Just say yes, Biden and Harris need to answer questions.
It's 2020 and the Republican party is strongly warning me that Joe Biden is coming for my meat.
Trump and Biden are polar opposites when it comes to policy.
It looks like Biden is exactly where Hillary was at this time in 2016.  Hillary had the ‚Äúfirst woman president‚Äù thing going for her, I did see Hillary bumper stickers and yard signs.  I have seen exactly one Biden bumper sticker and zero Biden yard signs.
She has 1/4 mixed white and Jamaican. 1/2 Tamil. 1/4 white Irish slave-owner.  Biden has insulted American blacks with this choice.
Biden insulted blacks by choosing her to represent blacks..  Biden insulted women by choosing her to represent women.
Biden has insulted blacks with his choice of a ‚Äúblack‚Äú. 1/2 Tamil, 1/4 Irish slave-owner, 1/4 mixed white/ Jamaican.
Biden has insulted blacks by his choice of a ‚Äúblack‚Äù who is 1/2 Tamil, 1/4 Irish slave owner, 1/4 mix Jamaican + white.  Biden has insulted women by his choice of an arrogant Hoe who used sex to get jobs.  Biden himself is an insult to America.  Corrupt.
No one is voting for Biden, they're just voting against Trump
The amount of new Biden signs I saw on my walk this morning &gt;&gt;&gt; I‚Äôve never been more proud to see people settle
Every Republican including Joe Biden has tried to defund Social Security.  I am so old that I can vividly remember my grandmother caring for both her bed-ridden mother and bed-ridden mother-in-law in her home for years.
Hillary Clinton is the nasty woman‚Äôs disease.  She choreographed this 2020 Democratic primary with scary precision.  From Iowa on.  The Clintons anointed Harris in the Hamptons three years ago to be the 2020 Democratic nominee. If Biden wins, Harris will be president.
She'd have a better chance compared to Dementia Joe Biden.
This is not original, but it is like Biden stole your car then comes back to ask you for gas money.
While there are undoubtedly many who will not get vaccinated out of some strange political loyalty or belief in conspiracy, there are far more who are lying when they say they won't.  Talk is cheap. Self-preservation is an effective motivator.
As long as people are buying post office shirts and forever stamps, they‚Äôre not selecting checks for the Biden campaign. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Biden is the dmt death burst of democracy
It‚Äôs since Biden and Kamala announced ppl have become way more lenient with social justice, that protest energy is dead...
I see the hardened racist washed up fallen star is trending again. I will NOT give him attn but he‚Äôs trying to smear Biden. What I WILL say. MATURE PPL listen,grow,change. #BidenHarris2020Landslide #VetsResistSquadron
Their original plan announced in Feb was to vote for the underdog and prolong the primaries, which was expected to be sanders. Then sanders won the first three, so they changed track to biden. Then dems latched on to biden's one win to consolidate with unprecedented intensity.
Among those voters who plan to use mail-in ballots, Biden leads by an astounding 50 points, 72% to 22%.  Among those who plan to vote in-person on Election Day, Trump leads by 35 pts, 55% to 31%.  Among those who plan to vote in-person early, Trump leads by 4 pts, 49% to 45%.
It‚Äôs OK. Biden and trump are tied for the white people vote which means Trump has lost.
Sometimes you just have to scratch your head and wonder where all of this is leading us.  Democratic Party sets rules for criticizing Biden‚Äôs VP pick Kamala Harris -  -
How?  Joe Biden will have complete media complicity
Dr. Siegel tells Tucker Carlson there is 'no science' behind Biden's mask mandate
If liberals are hesitant to join us in a #GeneralStrike  during the fucking Trump administration after Washington DC abandoned MILLIONS of people  I have no idea how anyone can make a coherent argument that they will help us push Biden left when he's in charge  Clown shit
BLACK VOICES FOR TRUMP DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW OBAMA  LEADER OF METOO ENDORSED MULTI-MILLIONAIRE BIDEN FOR PRES WHEN HE WAS ACCUSED OF RAPE OF POOR TARA READE.  CAREER, ACCUSED OF SEX CRIMES OF POOR WOMEN &amp; LITTLE GIRLS.  WHY DID DR GILL BIDEN LET IT CONTINUE?
The disappointing thing was Craig Melvyns indignant question as to when Biden/Harris were going to start "answering questions." They know they are co-conspirators but feel entitled to do Trumps dirty work for him
Alot of people call themselves anti imperialist but they are telling people to vote for Biden  Very confusing
If Joe Biden were president we would have a united plan against the pandemic. There would be a mandated mask order. If we really want this pandemic to end wear an effing mask! The GOP needs to step aside and let the smart people lead.
Why do they think will have leverage over Biden when Biden already said he will be a one term president?  Obama did all the shit he did while worrying about reelection  Biden is to his RIGHT and doesnt have to worry about it plus you pledged your vote. Makes no sense
But a biden presidency congeals the unification of democrats with Bush Republicans, and results in liberals then defending all those hideous trump policies when biden just continues them.
and it's all traceable back to Obama and Biden!
Biden, you couldn't build, even with a child's block set! You and Obama destroyed more of the USA goodness than any other group of crooks in history!
Essentially what I just heard on  is: Trump moves the news cycle Biden/Harris have not followed that tactic , and remained laser focused on their agenda because they are not answering reporters questions That leads to the inescapable conclusion, the news media enables Trump
That's funny. Buy me a Punch Presidente Maduro when Biden wins.
Do you really not remember biden and Obama championing pipelines and incentivizing the massive expansion of fracking wells for natural gas?  Wells which are currently vomiting super-greenhouse gas methane into the atmosphere, totally uncontrolled, as they are abandoned?
A NEW POLL FINDS THAT BIDEN'S SUPPORTERS ARE LESS ENTHUSIASTIC OF HIM.  RASMUSSEN REPORT SURVEY POLL: 59% THINK BIDEN IS UNLIKELY TO FINISH HIS FIRST TERM.  HIS VP IS NOT BLACK, SHE IS JAMAICAN INDIAN.   NOBODY WANTS THE JOB OF SELLING BIDEN DOOR TO DOOR.
Overconfident. Biden is neck and neck in 3 traditional red states. Kicking ass in all other blue states.
You know Biden wins Florida. Trump has zero chance at reelection. Bet you a good cigar.
I want him to explain how we push Biden to the left after pledging out vote to him when he's going to be a one term president anyway and dont have to worry about reelection  Very interested in hearing it
I have issues with the woman that basically called Biden a racist and said she believed his accusers jumping at the chance to run with him.
Dude. Trump can't win. End of story. Biden is so prepared. 600 lawyers ready at his response. Done deal.
As we all knew, SHE‚ÄôS the one running and doing all the talking for Hidin‚Äô Biden!  Sorry, but I‚Äôm totally sick of her, already!!!
punching left accomplishes what exactly?  He is a fucking grifter  He is pissing more people off than convincing to vote Biden
If biden wants to actually oppose trump policies and push for good things instead, I'm all ears. But he's very clearly not interested in that.
That, ultimately, is the problem. Biden doesn't actually represent stopping trump policies at all. He represents getting liberals to support trump policies at 60% power. I'd rather then keep opposing fascism instead of being partially invested in it.
Trouble is, biden has made it clear that not only will he not punish any of those trump people if he gets in office, he's likely to generally sustain all of trump's policies. He literally said he's going to make most of the trump tax cuts permanent!
Biden will save the Post Office. Republicans are dead meat. This party is so fucked up. I hope they all rot in hell. Especially Pedophile Gym Jordan I am really pissed off. Hate that party.
If Joe Biden were president, we‚Äôd already be past the worst of this. Instead we have record-setting unemployment and 200,000 deaths projected through next month. Please look at reality. Or just keep quiet.
BIDEN HAS ABOUT 50 YRS OF PUBLIC SERVICE NO ACCOMPLISHMENTS ALL RACIST &amp; SEXIST.   THOUGHT OF BLACKS AS INFERIOR RACE  VOTED WITH KLU KLUX KLAN AGAINST MINORITIES.  SENATE AIDE TARA READE ACCUSED MULTI-MILLIONAIRE  BIDEN OF RAPE  CAREER, ACCUSED OF SEX CRIMES
To put it bluntly: biden and the democrats explicitly aren't even offering bread and circuses and have rejected doing so for costs. They're at best just promising that the prison guard kicking you in the stomach might not be a white man, perhaps, someday.
Can we get Biden to take some questions for Christsakes
Vote AGAINST Trump!  Vot e Biden/Harris2020 #DumpTrump2020
I mean... Biden is going to sustain all of the brutal trump policies about protest responses. This federal escalation was literally out of a playbook biden and Obama wrote! None of the tear gas and beatings and punitive arrests will stop or even slow down.
We can‚Äôt get Biden even to take ANY questions. He forgets where he is.  Creepy Joe
We need to add 10 points to Trump and take away 10 points from Biden with every one of these polls we see. That‚Äôs the advantage Trump gets from the cheating, the suppression, the screwing with the postal service, and Russia.
It's not like they were voting Biden anyway.                                                 #Joemala2020
Biden is going to sustain every single negative policy from trump, he's explicitly said he's rejecting every policy I consider important, he's going to drop DACA like it's hot... If he wants my vote, he can consider changing his mind on any of those things. Try supporting m4a Joe
BIDEN ABOUT 50 YRS OF PUBLIC SERVICE, NO ACCOMPLISHMENTS, RACIST &amp; SEXIST.  VOTED WITH KLU KLUX KLAN SO THEIR CHILDREN WOULDN'T GO TO SCHOOL WITH BLACKS.  SENATE AIDE TARA READE ACCUSED MULTI-MILLIONAIRE BIDEN OF RAPE.  CAREER ACCUSED OF SEX CRIMES OF WOMEN
how do we get Pence and Biden to Debate?  Followed by Harris and Trump?  Mix it up, baby!
Kamala Harris in past interviews has said she wouldn't champion programs and policies specifically beneficial to Black ADOS. Nor has she or Joe Biden addressed any of the issues mentioned here, in their campaigns. She is literally just a Black face in a high place. #BidenHarris
I‚Äôm also not going to let Joe Biden cut my meat.
I don't think Joe biden's ever had a original thought in his head.
Joe Biden is no John Kerry when it comes to his Catholic faith, and this invites a robust debate about the public significance of Catholic faith.
History of asthma.... As a child but was able to play sports in Highschool and College... and was a life guard....but couldn't serve due to Asthma.  Hmmmmü§î (6 Deferments for Biden.)
Not even close. Clinton was within margin. Biden is not.
BIDEN &amp; DEMOCRATS WANTING CRIME AND EVEN MURDER IN ORDER TO DEFEAT REPUBLICANS IN NOVEMBER.  DEMOCRATS SEEM TO WANT TO TURN CITIES INTO WARZONE.  THEY WANT CRIME AND MURDER.    BIDEN WANTS TO CHANGE POLICE FUNDS, HE HAS A FUND THAT GETS RIOTERS OUT OF JAIL.
Is that the best that you have Pence? Biden and Harris will take away red meat when they are elected. No wonder Trump‚Äôs rigging the election (Putin, post office, birther conspiracies).Believe me, it‚Äôs not going to happen. You are out. Becky
And Clinton says she would be willing to serve in a Biden administration...as the President when they put Joe in the home. #KillarysBack #Trump2020
Isn‚Äôt Biden catholic
A ‚Äúselfless leader‚Äù huh? Interesting to hear considering earlier this year Kamala said she believed the women who accused Joe Biden of sexual assault and rape. This party is bought and paid for more than creepy Joe‚Äôs son.
BIDEN &amp; DEMOCRATS WANTING CRIME AND EVEN MURDER IN ORDER TO DEFEAT REPUBLICANS IN NOVEMBER.  DEMOCRATS SEEM TO WANT TO TURN CITIES INTO WARZONE.  THEY WANT CRIME AND MURDER.  BIDEN WANTS TO MISMANDLE POLICE FUNDS.  HAS A FUND USED TO GET RIOTERS OUT OF JAIL.
Did Biden serve?
lets watch trumps train go by using coal to continue ruin the atmosphere because he doesn‚Äôt care at all about Mother Earth. Then let‚Äôs watch Biden put all his power into MAN POWER to get any where he wants. #biden2020
Yeah, Politico does love a good ‚ÄúDems in Disarray‚Äù story but this is interesting. A lot of gossip but this is why a lot of people like Biden. He‚Äôs just a regular guy whose accomplished a lot and always faced adversity including ‚Äúelites‚Äù who have never accepted him
Vote Biden/Harris unless you‚Äôre in a sure-thing blue state. And hold them accountable for their despicable bullshit.
There‚Äôs a lot of groups who have room to criticize Biden bumbling like an idiot and Trump supporters are not one üòÇ y‚Äôall have the King idiot please pipe down
There are so many "progressives" with Stockholm Syndrome over the two party system to the point where they repeat their political fanfiction as if its fact   We couldn't push Obama to the left, and Joe Biden is to his RIGHT
Those people aren't Biden voters anyway.
Vote for Biden
Adding to a long list of exs in which he manipulates faith for pol gain the¬†pres‚Äôs rant in Ohio¬†last Thurs also undermined yet another sec of the Constitution ‚Äî¬†Article 6, Section 3¬†‚Äî which quite specifically states that there is no relig test for office.
Biden, Harris blasted by mainstream media for not taking questions from reporters
Vox says Biden is 'moving left' with Harris on ticket despite media calling her 'moderate'
Biden lies about what Trump says, makes it the centerpiece of his campaign, and you can‚Äôt see who is creating racial division in pursuit of power? Instead, you suggest someone you don‚Äôt know is racist. Cognitive dissonance. More important, Biden hurts America.
We Catholics should be able to explain how our faith informs all of our decisions, including our political ones. Biden's decision to lean in to the discussion, and not to avoid it, will be good for Catholicism, whether or not it is good for the Democrats.
WTF is Pence talking about??? Biden &amp; Harris r now going to ''cut America's meat?" How and where do they come up with this nonsense anyway???üò≥üëá
He won't. Perhaps we should focus our imagination on Biden and Harris taking office in January 2021.üëç
POST OFFICE IS NOT GOING ANY WHERE. TRUMP IS. LET THAT SINK IN. TRUMP IS DONE. TIMING IS EVERYTHING. BIDEN WILL STILL KICK HIS ASS. TRUMP IS GOING BYE BYE.
If and/or when Biden/Harris win in a landslide victory, the Senate will naturally flip.  Then we can finally get things done and Mitch will lose all his power, even if he wins re-election, which I don't feel he will...not even close. The Turtle's time is up too.
Yes, this IS our last stand, James. And WE THE PEOPLE are drawing a line in sand and we chose Biden and Harris on November 3.   Why u ask?üò≥ Bc we've fucking HAD it with this sociopathic LUNATIC.üëá  So, ya know, you've LOST. ‚ö°Ô∏è
Biden looks so ready to take our country back.
America, tell my friend John Fox to vote Biden.
The American people are seeing how frail the Orange ass is. Biden looks vibrant and ready to roll.
"We're not gonna let Joe Biden and Kamala Harris cut America's meat". Mike Pence..
That would require senile old Joe to speak without a cue card or teleprompter &amp; we all know that is no longer part of Biden‚Äôs skill set.
Whether we are lying or not I don't feel a cringe when I look at our faces in the mirror or at the faces of those like Trump but I cringe when I look at Biden or Kamala - its some radar that makes me stop looking at them. They must be very evil as I have an intuition - built in.
Try to build Biden as clone of clinton is disgusting.
You see what the Democrats do? They dirty every beautiful clean valuable thing on the planet to waste it away, they do it to people too, they destroy good folks - the prostitutes and liberal demoncrazies like Biden &amp; Kamala &amp; the rest of the trash.
Looks like the Democrat‚Äôs get-out-of-Biden-nominee card was to allow him to appoint an ineligible running mate par for the course after all BO was never eligible to serve as POTUS either
I had some steaks in the freezer last night but Joe Biden and Kamala Harris snuck in and stole all my meat.
BREAKING: New FOX poll says that Biden is leading Trump 50 to 36% on who Americans think who would do a better job handling coronavirus.  That's a 14 point lead...which is astounding, considering our ''divisiveness."   Doesn't look like we're that divided any longer.üò≥
Amen üëè And now Biden/Harris üôèüéâ
Internal Documents Circulated To DNC Delegates Hint At Why Biden Picked Harris  via   Trump is correct, as Biden and now I know it was only Biden &amp; Kamala who brought fish market folks from  Indian slums to US to replace educated upper class Indians

Joe biden does not want your guns!
How did he get that from Biden recommending that everyone wear a mask?
A FB acquaintance posted o meme with ‚Äúcreepy Joe‚Äù  touching the shoulders of a little girl in distress. The meme claimed the pic is proof of Joe‚Äôs pedophilia. I was happy to point out that the photo was taken at Beau‚Äôs internment &amp; the little girl is Biden‚Äôs grand daughter.
Ineligible to serve as either VP or POTUS anchor baby Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in her First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate She MUST be disqualified &amp; replaced or Trump wins unopposed by a Constitutionally qualified Democrat ticket
Trump is losing to Biden in a new general election poll by 11 points:  41 to 52% against Biden.  We're on our way my beloved Resisters.‚ù§Ô∏èü§çüíô  #BidenHarris2020Landslide
If Biden is elected, ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt seen nothin yet!!!!‚Äù
That being sad if the Democrats are playing chess no other candidate could have jump right in and win over so many votes so Biden had to get the position but Harris is the next actual candidate they are backing
Hey King Biden wanna be. .how about NO! #BidenIsARacist
‚Äúclassic #GenX straddle:  She‚Äôd navigated... a system controlled by older, whiter, more-conservative politicians, and then proposed to wield... that power in the service of... the enormous, diverse, and progressive... generations coming of age behind her.
Franklin Graham warns Biden-Harris ticket ‚Äòshould be a great concern to all Christians‚Äô
The awful Israel-UAE deal that Trump oversaw would have been overseen by Biden too, and Hillary - absolutely. But we have leaders in Congress now who are finally speaking up about Israeli apartheid. They are better positioned to grow influence without Republicans in charge.
God it would be cool if the people who made up 82% of america‚Äôs wealth saw a higher Rex percentage cut under Joe Biden tax plan but unfortunately he won‚Äôt do anything üòî
For those that are interested here's the source of this
Bernie had money from actual passionate voters. Biden gets corporate pac money.  Biden didn't even campaign in some states but won off of name recognition because half the country sadly doesn't pay attention.
You keep shifting to your hatred of Trump.  I'm trying to focus on Biden and D's lying about what he said and thereby creating further racial division in their pursuit of power. I don't think people should be okay with it. I assume, you would not be, if you did not hate Trump.
No evidence Obama and Biden did anything to spy on the Trump campaign. No basis for the claim Democrats will rig this election. Copy-paste, every night at 5:30.
You can hate Trump (as you obviously do) and still criticize Biden and D's for lying about what he said.
My main question is that if Biden wins and he raises taxes on the top 1% and Fortune 500 companies who will provide jobs for Americans when they take their factories to other countries? Please explain. I‚Äôve never ever got a definitive answer on this.
To state the obvious, Biden and D's are lying about what Trump said that day.  To create racial division to achieve political power. And you are okay with it.
will not win!!  And somehow if the Democrats pull off a criminal win, we the people will take it back.  So either way Biden will lose!
Biden got like 5% of the under 40 vote. AOC could reach them.  But keep licking those boots
I‚Äôm sorry, but no. Neither Biden nor Harris are socialists, &amp; they haven‚Äôt called for abolishing police.  However, Trump is actively hollowing out the government, profiting from it, is a white supremacist, and has let Covid completely overrun the country while calling it a hoax.
And this.
Wow... don't even where to begin here.  According to you,  Joe Manchin and AOC are the same since they are both Dems. So I guess Kasich and Trump are both the same since they are both Republicans.  Biden got like 5% of the under 40 vote.  AOC can reach them more than anyone.
If you are honest and open minded, read this and let me know your thoughts.  Put Trump's flaws to one side for a moment.
Tom, any concern about Biden and D's doing this -- smart liberal honest former law school professor sees Biden creating racial division in the pursuit of power.
Biden struggles with young voters. AOC excels with them. Kasich and Clinton will just be preaching to the choir.  AOC could actually reach New voters.  These are facts.
The thing is, the kind of people who will vote for Biden don't care about tax increases. None of them pay taxes. They're either here illegally or living in their mom's basement.
How will usps get them to and from with Trump slowing the mail system, purposefully.  I bet she votes Biden.
Biden is a pedo Harris got her job on her knees great choice!
Trump was dumb, not racist, to say anything other than Harris eligibility not an issue. But which is worse, a dumb "I have no idea" statement by Trump or a calculated false racial division political strategy by Biden and D's?
Again violating my vow to stay away on political stuff. Other day you  questioned if D's falsely created racial division to pursue power. See below by smart liberal honest former law school professor. You seem interested in truth.
The 2nd amendment was not about owning guns it's about the right to over throw a government that no longer had the best interest of the people. That's what will get with biden/ Harris #takemycountryback
Because it has attacked the great booming economy &amp; is now calling Trump a liar and Biden a catholic is winning &amp; they are citing sex abuse etc. I see a repeat of the same broken record player &amp; I know they are defrauding &amp; cheating &amp; pretending their religion is great &amp; its not.
Stick to sports. The dude got owned by Trump. Not one single reporter asked that question recently. Shannon, if you really are as smart as you are, name five things Biden has done for our country.
I loved the words that Biden had: "you could set your watches to it'' bc Trump is actually the most PREDICTABLE person on the planet if you've been paying attention.  And once u figure out the psyche of a sociopath, they're really not that complicated and therefore predictable.
There's go that theory that they will hold Biden accountable LMAO
Liberals are fighting and pushing back against a #GeneralStrike when fucking Trump is president   And y'all think they will have our back trying to force Biden to the left?   Clown shit
Me being old is not a big issue. As that Kamala - my step sister is 8 years older than me really and Biden is 77 years old - Nancy Pelosi has no teeth &amp; she is swaying her hips sitting in her chair like a dancing girl. They are the ones pretending to be universal but are they?
Hell yes... I'm loving that he says he's going to hold Biden accountable for the Green New Deal... you don't see that often!
These Biden commercials are eh just saying
Joe Biden is really in ‚Äú Dire Straits ‚Äú now!!
If and/or when Biden and Harris win on November 3 in a landslide victory...  it'll be the imminent END of the Republican Party as we know it.  Why? Bc the American people are simply TRAUMATIZED from the last 3.5 years and will vote blue for at LEAST the next 12.  Just sayin'.üò≥
On August 20th, Joe Biden will accept the Democratic nomination for president of the United States. Don‚Äôt miss it.  #DemConvention
People think Biden and Harris are just politicians with a few flaws when in fact they're very awful people who have caused some of the very same problems some people think they will solve for some reason
It is you who lied &amp; still lie. You are pitiful. Trump did not lie. You will suffer terrible consequences for attacking so many decent good honest people because of one woman's hatred for her step sister. Kamala's hatred. Poor woman. I forgive her &amp; hope God forgives her &amp; Biden.
You cannot be serious? If this Trump Virus wasn‚Äôt as truly serious as it continues to be, your idiotic comment would be laughable. 160,000 + Americans DEAD and counting. If the Biden/Harris Administration was in charge, we all would be better off.   #BidenHarris2020 üíô
They hate us so much &amp; we never hurt them in anyway except we are not prostitutes they all are. The worst prostitutes &amp; whores attacking decent folks using dirty reporters dirty Biden dirty Kamala &amp; dirty liberal democrats who throw dirt on everyone they can get trapped some way
SENATE AIDE TARA READE ACCUSED MULTI-MILLIONAIRE BIDEN OF RAPE.  LAWYER SAID CASE WAS CREDIBLE.  TARA TOLD SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS ABOUT THE ACCUSED RAPE, IGNORED HER.  CAREER, ACCUSED OF SEX CRIMES OF POOR WOMEN &amp; GIRLS.  OBAMA OF METOO PROTECTS BIDEN.
A DNC spokesperson told The Hill that Yang was among a list of former 2020 candidates who would be speaking during two segments about the status of America and how they will work with former Vice President Joe Biden.
Trump's Response When Asked If He Regrets All The Lies He's Told America: None  via   That reporter and those prostitutes &amp; Democrats &amp; Biden &amp; Kamala are the only ones lying. Trump is not lying. I am not lying. We are all the ones who are victimized.
C‚Äômon. I answered your question honestly. Man up. The chaos in Seattle okay with you?  Defunding the police sound like a good idea?  Do you support Chicago BLM leaders defending looting calling it reparations? Biden saying we all need to wear masks outside, even in rural Kansas?
I swear some of these people are proletariats straight out of 1984. Most of these people probably don't vote anyway, but criticizing and telling people they shouldn't vote for Biden
Make America Sleep Restfully Again is a legit potential Biden-Harris slogan
Biden is the 'presumptive' democrat nominee not even the real one. Everything is so presumptuous &amp; presumed not real. Whole thing is a fraud.
Never succumb to Biden hit the rascal directly on his face &amp; break the nasty arrogant nose of Kamala. Beat them up &amp; make them eat dirt &amp; become rag dolls stomp on them throw their broken bodies in the rubbish heap where they belong with their fake evil gods they try to protect

I will never support Biden no matter what he does. As he is the real liar not me or Trump.
I am sick of the Democrats, sick of Biden, sick of Kamala, sick of these type of reporters S.V. Date - like having a Date going on a Date &amp; so on that is what they are saying - that I am looking for a Date with some man or woman as they change my gender &amp; say any lies to push it
I'll believe that when Biden starts screeching about conspiracies on Twitter for five hours a day.
They have nothing else other than to tweet disinformation as nothing positive ever has happened from the  administration. Trump &amp; minions  are frantically editing photos of Biden to rile up the uneducated base. They have no other amnitition. üòÇ
I told my mother about this by phone right after which Nancy Pelosi got very angry with all the Democrats joining to put the impeachment trial that Trump had asked Ukraine for proof about Biden doing some cover up there for his son Hunter. So it is still the same issue going on
They are pushing the same deal over again now - Biden and Kamala - that I am immoral &amp; that I had amorous relationships with younger men, that I had baby with a CIO of Citibank Shankar Iyer. She put a baby carriage in my basement &amp; said it was proof of my adultery &amp; immorality
Jilly? Dougie? Aww, how folksy. C'mon man. Give me a break. Joe Biden and Kamala going to eat Trumps lunch? Nope. Not even close
Joe Biden can‚Äôt even spell UAE.
I cannot wait to see  tell Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to keep their mitts off his meat.

The longer AOC talks, the greater the risk she‚Äôll point out that Biden is a racist with dementia and that KamAllah is descended from slave owners, and that AOC is the best candidate to lead a fascist global new world order.
Maybe if you handed voted to give Trump a pass for TRYING TO LEVERAGE UKRAINE FOR DIRT ON BIDEN, we wouldn't be suffering from all these crises.  THIS IS ON GOP!  #COVID19  #USPSsabotage  #deficit
Biden picked Harris to pander to woman and people of color.  That seems like trying to rig something to me.  Look up all the states where voting by mail has left ballots uncounted.  Left or right, right or wrong it doesn‚Äôt work. NJ, NM, MO, WV, IN.
BIDEN &amp; DEMOCRATS WANTING CRIME AND EVEN MURDER IN ORDER TO DEFEAT THE REPUBLICAN IN NOVEMBER.  DEMOCRATS SEEM TO WANT TO TURN CITIES INTO WARZONE.  THEY WANT CRIME AND MURDER.     BIDEN DONATES MONEY TO RIOTERS TO GET THEM OUT OF JAIL, THEY HAVE A FUND.
I don't think Claire has many open minded followers, but for any who are here, look at how liberal former law professor Ann Althouse views Biden's and D's intentional creation of racial division to pursue political power.
I would have loved Joe Biden to have picked Tulsi Gabbard or Nina Turner over any "Third Way" Corporate Zionist DINO like Harris!
If you consider yourself on the left and you are busy pushing and holding water for Joe Biden instead of helping with a #GeneralStrike, you are a fraud  Sorry, not sorry
If you are annoyed that Biden isn‚Äôt exactly who you want to vote for, so are unexcited about participating in this election: I have good news!    If you vote some random third party or sit out the election, you won‚Äôt have to worry about voting ever again.
If Trump wins but Democrats retake the Senate and the House  What exactly could Trump get accomplished that Joe Biden wouldn't already do?
And you think Biden will be better?  I get you stated it twice.  My issue was never about the story I‚Äôm particular.  It‚Äôs with the constant pandering to the liberal agenda.

The number one priority for progressives should be organizing a #GeneralStrike, not holding water for fucking Joe Biden and the Democratic Party who are complicit with this shit
The reason why I know you are a deeply unserious grifter is because if you really believed Trump was this existential threat, instead of punching down at people with no money or no power, you would have hit the phones to actually help Biden win  Who's chasing clout now?
In a perfect world,  Bernie Sanders.  In a realistic world,  none of the current republican goons would be a good start.  I hate Biden too, but sadly it's the only alternative.
BLACK VOICES FOR TRUMP DOESN'T THINK IT IS FAIR THAT THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA DON'T COVER BIDEN'S HEALTH &amp; FITNESS.  VOTERS NEED TO KNOW IF A CANDIDATE CAN DO THE JOB.  TRUMP SUCCESSES ARE TAX CUTS, ECONOMY, UNLEASHING DOMESTIC ENERGY PRODUCTION, &amp; THE COURTS.
Very concerning ticket... I just don't see how progressive Democrats will be able to vote for Biden/Harris... Though I also though Christian conservatives wouldn't vote Trump. So wtf do I know.
Joe Biden wants to shut down ice cream parlors, close amusement parks and put a complete ban on board games.

Shitty progressives like  can easily pitch Joe Biden because he is fucking ignorant about how trash the Obama administration was  He was part of the class who wasnt devastated by their policies  But he thinks he can shame black leftists to vote for a racist? Fuck you
yes, I ‚ù§Ô∏è it, yes young people for BIDEN/HARRIS your vote is truly NEEDED!üëçüèæ‚ù§Ô∏èüíØ
Except Biden doesnt let himself into the dressing rooms of nude underage pagent constestants or install camera's in the rooms of women on game shows.
Oh ask Joe Biden what he thinks?? He gives credit to the Obama administration almost 4 years ago for Trump's hard work

I have 2 daughters...I don't want them living in Biden's America! I'll die for them. Trust!
Biden / Harris 2020~ !!! Let's bring honesty, CLASS, respect, and intelligence back to the White House.  America misses those qualities in a President.
"I was one of the people who publicly expressed concern about Harris during her presidential campaign. A few key things have changed since then ... my politics have changed."  Translation: I went from critic to bootlicker within 2 changing seasons.
Libs: Trump wants to be a dictator! An autocrat!! Trump: The governors should make decisions. They know what works for them. Libs: He is not a good leader!  Biden: All governors should require people to wear a mask. Kamala: That's what leadership looks like. Libs: Yay!!
Then maybe, if nothing can be done now, Biden's DOJ will indict Trump. He would be out of office, could be charged, could be impeached. That way he doesn't get to run for president again.
Don the con is going to raise taxes to the middle class to pay for his failed reaction to Covid. Biden will tax billionaires which means trump will pay more. Trump is going to spread any lies to get reelected to pay less in taxes and to stay out of jail for tax evasion.
Biden has his downside being an old white man and an establishment Dem. Kamala being selected shows the progress. This ticket is the best Dems have to beat the current GOP. But u don't beat GOP voter suppression without the black vote. After that women will lead the country.
So Biden‚Äôs not winning then?
I love the convo. But the Dem party has been making strides since 2018 w/ black women and other minority women (AOC, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley&amp;Rashida Talib) beating out old establishment Dems. While introducing new ideas and bills. Biden is to appease old Dems. Party unity.
Biden picks Harris for running¬†mate
Seems like all of the Biden press is positive and the Trump press is negative.  Who would have thought that?
The fact Biden is trying to take credit for this is exactly why he shouldn‚Äôt be president. He tries to take credit for what others have done.
I agree! She threatened Biden.
Biden mumbled and was zoned out today- ü•±üò¥ü§§.  Would you explain to Marie the importance that I know WHY JOE HAS NEVER had a covid test? Marie, hasn‚Äôt he gotten the COVID test ‚Äúout of the goodness of his heart?‚Äù
Best President ever. Biden/Harris cannot even come close
Wrecking the post office to interfere w/ mail-in voting &amp; set it up for privatization is 1000x more terrible than refusing to help Ukraine w/ its proxy war w/ Russia if they don't investigate Biden (or whatever the impeachment was supposed to be about)
No, we're not. It's coming back up because folks who haven't paid attention during the primary are now looking to get caught up for the general.  These folks that haven't any clue about Biden or Harris beyond the headlines of articles they've been scrolling past in the last year.
Quick now do a Biden is senior story.  Or Kamala will sell anyone out to gain power.  No?  Only anti-Trump.  Wow.  I‚Äôm ashamed this is my KC radio station.    You don‚Äôt even try to hide it anymore.
I would trust Biden to do a better job than Trump with the virus anytime
Bernie‚Äôs volunteers [as opposed to paid staff, a/k/a Jeff Weaver] and donors deserved better.  I know unpaid volunteers who gave up at least two years of their lives because they believed in the urgency of M4A.  And then immediately endorsing Biden?  WTFF?
I hope she and Biden don‚Äôt give it the time of day. Sadly, I think one of Obama‚Äôs biggest mistakes was releasing his birth certificate rather than dismissing the accusations as nonsense
I will never vote for Biden, but I will admit you make a good point.
Exactly! As the saying goes, as Ohio goes, so does the country or something like that. Biden is actually faring well in OH. Let‚Äôs turn it blue!
Don‚Äôt get the rambling(see Joe Biden), thought he was well spoken and very thoughtful!
Harris has the same criminal mind as LBJ.  And she's just as determined as he was to be POTUS. Biden won't last long.

I cannot believe the anti-mask idiocy. Biden takes a stand to call for a nationwide mask mandate, and the MAGAts come crawling out of the muck exclaiming, "But my freedom!" Please. It's not about freedom. It's about saving American lives! If you're a "patriot" then act like it.
KAMALA HARRIS BRINGS NOTHING TO THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN, SHE ISN'T BLACK, SHE IS JAMAICAN INDIAN.  MALES BLACK,  WHITES, &amp; LATINOS ARE UPSET WITH BIDEN FOR NOT BEING CONSIDERED.  IT IS ASTONISHING HOW BIDEN WAS ABLE TO PICK A RUNNING MATE HAS DONE MORE DAMAGE.
The onion is right! Biden really did need more centrist to even out all the centrism on the ticket

Really!? What Obama and Biden had was not prosperity. Remember Obama what was he going to wave his magic wand. Said it was the new normal and it wouldn't ever be like it was again.
He hasn't made racist comments every week. Twice he has said something that was out of context. He explained himself very clearly. Trump makes racist comments almost daily and never explains. To accuse Biden of being a racist, you don't have the evidence stacked behind him.
You meant Biden. Right?
Biden won‚Äôt be leaving his basement so he doesn‚Äôt need a mask. Kamala wouldn‚Äôt be leaving the Lincoln bedroom as she ‚Äòentertains‚Äô guests so I guess she won‚Äôt need one, either.
You won't win this one, because Trump has undeniable evidence of absolute racism. Joe Biden has said a few goofy things. And yes we know about the crime bill. But he's also been a very strong advocate for civil rights, and he served exceedingly well with a Black president 7/
Biden just said he will issue a NATIONWIDE MASK MANDATE as soon as he and Harris take office...and then Kamala added, "This is what TRUE LEADERSHIP looks like."  Now THAT'S what I'm talking about people.ü§£üëç  #BidenHarris2020Landslide
We've seen Biden for over four decades with zero positive results. He needs to stand on the stage with Trump and make his case as to why and how after all of those decades he will finally do something positive for America.
Joe is on his last limb I know he has dementia I can tell by his actions. The Obama/Biden administration did nothing for Americans in the eight years if they were in office. Media radio and television lie to the people. I‚Äôm tired of the left radical destroying cities.

Surely, the big story is not what Biden said but the fact that Trump himself openly proclaimed that he is doing it. Otherwise, we should have stories like, "Biden claims big blast went off in Beirut," etc.
No questions  for Harris or Biden. Guess figure press will carry their water. Make their spin for them. üëÄ

Franklin Graham warns Biden-Harris ticket ‚Äòshould be a great concern to all Christians‚Äô
I love the people who are like  ‚ÄúPLAN: Nov 3 - get Biden and Harris elected.  Nov 4 - push them to be better!‚Äù  Then they provide a laundry list of policies that they would essentially want from a candidate who isn‚Äôt worthless/ACTUALLY progressive. It‚Äôs so sad.

We've killed more US citizens in 3 months than Joe Biden and Barak Obama killed in 8 years in office.
I don't like Biden, and I don't like Trump. I don't like Jorgensen, and I don't like Hawkins. But even more insidious than any of these, and I think you'll all agree, are people who don't put their PowerPoint presentations in presentation mode.
So they get rid of honest folks and those with good intelligence &amp; worth - so everyone is either stupid or corrupt - Biden and Kamala - types. That is their goal to form what they call the Mafia mob team that will then allocate jobs study monies everything according to favoritism
Drumming up support for Biden so he can win she can collect her money from trump and then divorce him.
They reduce our ability to breathe they reduce supply of oxygen - they use viruses - anything to make those who usually excel in anything they do to lose that ability so that  incompetents  like Biden and corruption criminal actions of dishonest women like Kamala can win
The tragically dim Joe Scarborough asked in 2016 why Democrats have voting booths.  Biden did not earn his candidacy.  obama royally screwed people who had voted for him twice when he rigged Super Tuesday and beyond.
She's not debating trump. Biden is. That'll be a disaster all it's own.  She's got to face pence, who is a repellent and shameless monster who made his career on call-in talk radio. He's actually good at the forms of debate, and she explicitly is not.
There‚Äôs so much wrong with this.  Completely ignoring how illegal it is, Jared Kushner seems to simply think putting an African American on the ballot is enough to sway votes away from Biden?
Harris has done more pressers and answered more questions than Biden did since the pandemic started. That's just what I'm looking for in a POTUS - delegation until it's time to stand up and read something my babysitter wrote for me.
'Open and shut': Kamala Harris argues case is clear against Trump in introduction as Biden's running mate

Terrorism, bio terrorism, dark web crimes - list goes on for money making deals by defrauding good folks like me. Lying cheating making us look stupid, doing bad customer service by taking our money delivering bad products - this is Kamala's signature &amp; Biden's policy. Bastards

Thanks for the kind words.  Hypothetically say my vote tilts MO to Biden or Trump and determines the electoral college victor.  If I would vote for Trump should I still vote?   That‚Äôs the only options in this scenario.
You spelled Biden wrong lady
Same! I wanted a Harris-Biden ticket, actually. But Biden-Harris is good, too!!
I can't wait to watch both of these videos later today! I am just so thrilled to see this Biden/Harris ticket! We are so overdue for a return to decency and normalcy!
Even if there were indictments, it will disappear if Biden wins. Barr ran the clock out like he planned.
5 Takeaways From Kamala Harris‚Äôs First Full Day on the Biden Ticket   I want this woman to do her best to prosecute POTUS. I really want to see her do it as I know its all hocus pocus lies fraud. I have just seen my  account hacked
Biden-Harris ticket a blow to Palestinian hopes
At least Yang is now speaking at Dem convention.   There is hope
Not to defend Trump but the economy was fine before COVID (from a financial investment perspective not for everyday people but it also sucked for them under Obama) in fact the big question before the pandemic was how could Biden beat an incumbent when the economy is strong
In Bernie Sanders they had a perfect candidate that actually excited the people.  They decided to smear said candidate and prop up Joe Biden, who is already bungling this election 2016-style.  No one is excited about Joe.
It's fascism or fascism. Biden will throw feds at protests just as much, because he literally did so at protests under his and obama's watch. Even the rhetoric is getting explicitly fash

If you have an account with experian, its been hacked to reduce credit scores, steal our information already. That is what dark web does. That is what Kamala Harris slut and Biden bastard do and why they come to power.
Original tweet was about VP debate. Then you did a 180 pivot and took it down a tangent about mumbling and Biden. Typical right wing spin. Then tried to tell everyone to stay on topic. You would be a good faux news reporter.
The BLM ticket is headed up by Biden who authored the 94 crime bill leading to mass incarceration of black folks and an overzealous prosecutor who sent 1500 people to jail for Marijauna crimes in California. So you‚Äôre right they both aren‚Äôt anti-cop and the irony is hilarious
Was Biden pick just joke on black community
I think I defended it just fine, and said Biden is an overall 5% improvement over Trump due largely to fact that his Covid response would be better, as for the rest of his presidency ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Since when did trump give dam about Muslims? He MUST be shitting his pants over Biden/Harris 24hr fundraising!
I'm not so sure of that. I don't believe their will be a "Beat Biden at all costs mentality" in 2024, I think ideology will still be a major player like it was in 2016.
Look I already said I‚Äôm gonna vote for the garbage Dem ticket I don‚Äôt really know what else you want from me, this how a feel and I‚Äôll feel the same in 2 year when Biden hasn‚Äôt accomplished anything significant despite having a Democrat controlled Congress
The former vice president and California senator may not be completely aligned when it comes to coronavirus aid.
So so funny!!! #Biden #MAGA
Terry, yes they voted for the individuals now in charge. But I doubt many voted for what this has become. While this is the natural conclusion of what the Dems have been promising for 60 yrs, creeping incrementalism has been kicked to the curb. No moderate Dems are voting Biden.
Oh and they can dirty us, we should not be clean somehow. I want them to be dirtied all sorts of filth heaped on their heads starting with Kamala Harris and Biden. Just dump them in a sewer.
Their killings bombings thieving harassing is all OK but ANYTHING WE DO is all wrong &amp; should be punished, any education we have or work we do is worthless - its a huge hoax &amp; its Kamala Harris and Biden &amp; Democrats who must be prosecuted as enemies of entire US, UK, Europe
Defund the police does not mean get rid of the police. Stop being so silly.
don‚Äôt vote for joe Biden
Biden and Kamala won‚Äôt be any better for Black people
For the record I was on the fence about voting for Biden but trumps absolute failure to respond to COVID is the reason why I‚Äôll vote for Biden so I do recognize there would be an improvement just, a small one
It‚Äôs horrble if either one does it so we shouldn‚Äôt give Biden a pass because masks it with nice language which is point the OP was making
If I‚Äôm getting tossed into an unmarked van by some armed goons it doesn‚Äôt really matter at that moment whether it was Biden or Trump that had me drag off the street without due process because they think I‚Äôm an anarchists (which I‚Äôm not btw)

Kamala Harris worked with the Church of Scientology. I was going to vote for Biden, but not now. Not voting for Trump either.  Gonna sit this one out. Again.
Biden‚Äôs VP pick gives her first speech full of lies:

Biden has a long history in public office that makes it pretty easy to predict what is presidency will look like
I look forward to it just don‚Äôt forget to remind me when Biden is still bombing people overseas and deporting immigrants at record rates
Kamala Harris is Joe Biden‚Äôs VP pick. These Black Kansas City area residents are elated - a story from
This is more or less what I‚Äôm laboring to say here: Biden will be an improvement by virtue of not doing some of the bad things that trump does which is why I‚Äôm gonna vote for him but he‚Äôs not gonna do anything to make things materially better for people just less bad
You really do need to overcome your TDS. You think Biden the child molester and pervert (as seen in many many pictures) will do better? His party has caused much of not all of the current chaos in America. He‚Äôs a pathetic puppet of all that is bad for this country.
Harry Truman, Lyndon B Johnson, Richard Nixon, Al Gore, Dick Cheney, Joe Biden. They were all fairly influential VPs during their terms in office in the modern era. 3 went on to become POTUS. And hopefully a fourth one in January 2021.
What in Biden‚Äôs long public history of supporting segregation, voting for the Iraq war, attacking Anita Hill, and authoring the crime bill, makes you think he‚Äôs gonna do ‚Äúmany positive things‚Äù?
One of the worst outbreaks was in NY under Cuomo and DeBlasio. Despite all the hero worship that Cuomo got, he actually did a horrendous job responding to COVID-19 so let‚Äôs not pretend Biden would have been a magic cure all
Curious what would Biden have done to make Desantis in Florida and Abbott in Texas take the virus seriously from the start? Our federal system is the problem here (again I think things would have gone better with Biden but the difference would not be as dramatic as you think)
Not sure how that‚Äôs possible when Biden has said multiple times he would veto any universal healthcare legislation
I sure hope you are right. I won't rest until Biden/Harris are inaugurated.

The civil rights movement. The picture of him and Biden together was taken in 2008, 56 years after Byrd had left the Klan. Or, do you just not forgive anybody whatsoever? Nobody's allowed to repent? That's the kind of Christian you are right?
Wait so their strategy is Biden is racist? The trump campaign‚Äôs strategy
Trump knows he can‚Äôt beat Biden in a fair election, a rigged election or even a fraudulent election. His only hope is to remove Biden from the race. Trump is stirring up the troops.
Why wouldn‚Äôt the next executive branch have the same access to the daily testing and quick results of the current executive branch? Trump &amp; Biden are both one Olympiad from a hover-round.
Prove it with real numbers. I believe that you could say, with all honesty, that your inaction on #COVID19 has killed more in 3 months than Obama/Biden did in 8 years.
170,000 people are dead thanks to the incompetence of you and this WH. Do you have nothing else to do? You should be scared of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. They will save our country and our democracy. It will take decades to fix what you have destroyed. GFY
Joe Biden is a right wing fascist
I‚Äôve already accepted that trump will probably get another 4 years. This is how it felt in 2016.  The only conversation happening is how much we don‚Äôt like our options. But republicans will vote &amp; stay organized. I agree Biden/Harris have major issues. But I‚Äôm still voting them.
The Democrats had to know she would seal the Deal of Biden Losing. Why did they pick her???
So the phone speakers could be next to the computer microphone cmon guys.
I understand that a majority of people don‚Äôt want Harris/Biden but that‚Äôs what we have. And what we can do is keep using our voices. Especially local to make actual change. But I‚Äôll be fucking damned if I have to spend another 4 years with trump/pence. Look at our fucking country
Once again, Dems will have to clean up the sh!t storm left behind by a corrupt and incompetent GOP administration. With the support of the majority of the American people, I believe Biden/Harris can restore our country and go after those criminally responsible. #VoteTrumpOut
Show me a video clip of Biden lying, especially on a scale of 160,000+ deaths, the severity of a pandemic, telling people to inject themselves with disinfectant, how he passed a cognitive test that he aced, meaning he's very intelligent. How his business would not do 1/
Biden is ahead in Minnesota by 3 which means Trump is ahead by 7. This is big.  This will be a Trump landslide, and the Democrats know it.

Like he has our nation?  You bet I believe he will and whatever else he can get away with to steal this election because he knows Biden and Harris are going to run him into the ground.
But lots of candidates are race baiters. Harris wasn‚Äôt race baiting when she supported jussie smollett and then didn‚Äôt retract when it was a lie? Biden wasn‚Äôt race baiting when he invoked Browns name even though his own justice department found hands up don‚Äôt shoot was a lie?
So you see why technology industry &amp; so many rich folk are supporting Biden &amp; Democrats &amp; Kamala Harris &amp; why everyone is against those like Trump &amp; they make up all these excuses - about attacking some women or calling somebody names or being racist or stupid not smart on virus
Wow! So Trump controls internal policy in China? Obama said ‚Äú tell Vladimir I‚Äôll have more flexibility after the election‚Äù. And Trump sent weapons yo Ukraine, not Biden. Syria, you would be throwing a fit if we invaded Syria!
In March, when the lockdowns started, I thought I'd be working from home for 2 weeks.  I guess I expected a competent response.    5 months in and I miss going to the movies, out to dinner, and traveling.  I don't expect it to get any better until Biden is sworn in.
I can‚Äôt believe we have to celebrate another Easter every year now that  rose from the dead just to tweet the Biden is Nuts gospel.

Biden introduces Harris, campaigning together for the first time in Delaware
You all miss the point here.  The Pence(anti-glbt)  loving supporter whos openly gay is questioning Biden as a possible homophobe. The hypocrisy here is ridiculous &amp; reveals his loyalty to the political party is way more relevant to him than his concern for glbt rights.
All Trump had to do was research how black folks accepted pols like Herman Cain or Ben Carson We don't support black ridiculousness anymore than we accept white ridiculousness Kanye would literally take more votes from nincompoop Trump fans than Biden constituents
Really want to dive into the one bill Biden got passed with his 50 yrs in public service. Term limits..but let's dive into the 1994 crime bill
Hillary was never going to be the 1st woman president.. America doesn't forget.. so you double down..with a ticket that has done more to make black lives matter less? This ticket has to be a troll.. harris quits after a debate.and you won't let Biden debate to defend his one bill
Ugh...i hear you... Trump is just that bad. But Biden ain't moving anywhere but right

Harris is incredibly intelligent. I don't agree with her on plenty of things but. She's head and shoulders above Trump Pence and Biden. She will eat your lunch in a debate .

We can get into why Harris was ran out by Tulsi in the debates.. but only after you see why America won't let Biden get away with his shit...
Biggest problem is. . . You don't know Biden. And still voting for him.. he overpopulated prisons..his bill..his only one in 50 yrs of office.. trump is something else.. but we only have to suffer 4 more yrs .. blacks have suffered for 30 yrs because of Biden.
What about her record? How could her record not be presidential.since she dropped out after  Tulsi drilled her.. but all of a sudden she is OK for VP? Wont even touch the 1994 crime bill Biden authored.
No. "significant change or dismantling" is not something i expect from voting for Biden. Perhaps I misspoke. Would much rather hit pavement against Biden than against Trump.   To my mind, "thinks ICE should exist" isn't quite Stephen Miller-directed policy.
At least they were nice admit to show that Biden is more physically capable than Trump.
Yep, Biden administration about to mirror Trump administration with the only difference is liberals will be cheering it on
Got your contract I see. Imagine being so ashamed about your own parties politics to switch sides for Biden. Yes, vote for Biden don't be foolish. Those in depth "takes" from people that HATE his party and have actively worked to destroy it is the neolib üòò

Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Florida. If Biden wins 3 out these 4 states, he wins the title. Game, set, match. And Trump knows this. Any combination. Game over.
Neither Trump or Biden is a good choice, there is a #thirdoption we need a leader who is fiscally responsible, and believes that government should be smaller #Libertarian  #democracy #freedom
Kamala Harris is an ICE enthusiast   Joe Biden was the Vice President of the Deporter in Chief  Joe Biden campaign publicly admitted that the Latino vote isnt a big priority   Gotta feel for the Latino community right now
I think they think too little of black voters that they think they‚Äôre so dumb to vote for Kanye instead of Biden
There is a #thirdoption a choice for fiscal responsibility,  a choice where common sense will prevail, #Libertarian  I'm not for Biden or Trump, there is a better choice.
Kamala has no integrity.  Neither does Tara Reade,  who has stated that she is still going to vote for Biden
Why would the Trump campaign (or anyone) think that black people would vote for Kanye if they otherwise would‚Äôve voted for Biden?
Finally. Adults in a campaign. Biden Harris 2020
Kamala has the same criminal mind as LBJ and she wants the presidency just as much as LBJ did. Joe Biden knows that he is just a temporary placeholder for Kamala.  George Soros has picked Kamala.

George Soros has picked her to be the next POTUS. He‚Äôs ordered his son Alex and all his open society foundation‚Äòs to get her into office. Biden is her place holder.
Yes, The latest orders of George Soros.  He‚Äôs now put his son Alex and all of his ‚Äúopen society‚Äù foundation ordered to support her and make her POTUS. Joe Biden knows he is just her temporary placeholder.
The only lead Trump has over Biden is called Senior moments. That's the true Trump landslide.
This is hilarious. You people can not be serious about Biden and Harris. You really must live in a bubble.
Kamala has no integrity. What do you expect????  She wants to be POTOS and has the same criminal mind as LBJ.  Biden won‚Äôt last long, he‚Äôs her place holder.

Fox News put a hit out on the Democratic Nominee Joseph Biden on National Television saying that he will not make it to Election Day why is this being allowed on a Candidate for President in America Fox News should loose their license to broadcast all employees fired
This BIDEN/HARRIS TICKET, the SATANIC DUO, the Socialist Dems, STATE-RUN MSM, are VIGOROUSLY TRYING to MAKE We Americans SEE them through ROSE-COLORED GLASSES=WHY? EVERYTHING this DUO WANT, I'm AGAINST=Medicare FOR ALL, OPEN BORDERS, PUBLIC SCHOOL EDUCATION INDOCTRINATION=FREEDOM
Get with it, Mr Biden,  ABSENTEE BALLOTS ARE VERY DIFFERENT from MAIL-IN BALLOTS,  the ABSENTEE BALLOT MUST be REQUESTED, SENT to at REQUESTED ADDRESS,  MAIL-IN BALLOTS are NOT REQUESTED by VOTER, automatically SENT to VOTER'S LAST ADDRESS, FRAUD/CHEATING VERY LIKELY to HAPPEN.
Vote for Biden
im afraid if we don't vote for biden we won't be able to vote next election
At this point, I think both top party choices suck and would be bad for the country. So I don‚Äôt feel swayed by the charge that I‚Äôd be helping Trump or Biden, for that matter. I weary of the binary and banal choices given. I‚Äôm considering using my voice in a different way.
Don't take our foot off the gas: Biden expands lead over Trump to double digits: poll
First of all I HATE Biden but I have not heard Him take any credit for this Second of all look closely at my profile pic dumbass it‚Äôs not just The Republican or Democrat logo in a no sign but BOTH cause both parties suck hard #EndThe2ParySystem
Great article showcasing how the ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù stuff between Obama/Biden wasn‚Äôt always real and how much they differ on style.   Paints Biden as an opponent of the ‚Äúelitist‚Äù attitude Obama became known for during his tenure, and more about personal relationships.
We are destroying this country over a virus with a 99.96 survival rate.   Kids need to go back to school and the country needs to open.   All Biden can talk about is mask mandates(tyranny)   Hydroxychlorquine is the cure multiple doctors and epidemiologists agree.
When he said minorities will invade the suburbs and lower the property values under Biden
You are quite welcome!! TEAM BIDEN!!!
Biden is not the President until 2021.. Then I‚Äôm sure he will take questions üòÑ
Quite serious actually. I will be voting for Biden. 165k of my fellow Americans have perished under the current President, as well as millions without work. I believe it is Time for a change.  Have a great day.
I can already SEE the BIDEN/HARRIS TICKET will be a CAMPAIGN of LIES, HATE, AGAINST President Trump with OCCASIONAL SOCIALIST POLICIES INTERJECTED. By the way BLUE VOTERS, Kamala Harris is NOT a MODERATE, will TRY to APPEAR ONE, do NOT LET Kamala FOOL YOU,  check DEMOCRAT DEBATES
The fact that my mother had to push me out in december instead of november genuinely makes me upset   i would do anything to give my vote to biden
I would NEVER vote for Donald Trump or Joe Biden but Donald Trump and Joe Biden are more than welcome to vote for Me
WTF  There‚Äôs making it so easy to sit this one out!   Don‚Äôt you dare come blame me if Biden Loses this shit!!   He‚Äôs doing everything he can to tell progressive we don‚Äôt care about you!!   Harris is awful &amp; completely for sale$   #DNCisCorrupt #Clueless #help
I would never suck Joe Biden's dick but Joe Biden is more than welcome to suck my dick
So what do u call what Biden does?
Biden is actually right about one thing Trump has not done jack shit about Coronavirus He could have done something much earlier but He did not and We still have to deal with this shit because He will not get off his lazy ass and order more testing
I love that you named it the "Harris-Biden" Ticket...
Obviously need some corrective legislation from President Biden and oversight of postmaster
Trump's favorite tactics against his political opponents are to lie, fabricate, deceive, cheat and bully. Biden simply has to point out all of Trump's corruption, lies, abuses, racism, hate speech and failures. A mountain to work with. #dumptrump #bidenharris
Love it! An ambitious smart fine lady will have strong drive... it will strengthen #BidenHarris2020 to help us out of this chaotic created by Prez Trump. Thank you late AG Beau Biden for connecting both.
VP Pence FORGOT: Prez Obama took over a recession economy and built it up (including saving Chevy &amp; Chrysler)!!! It was broken but Obama-Biden Admin got it FIXED... then Prez Trump took over this FIXED economy and MESSED it mainly due to MISmanagement in fighting COVID-19!
Trying to pin Biden/Harris to Iranian connections is ironic considering the Trump Saudi/Russia connections. Biden was Vice MF President. I‚Äôd be worried if he DIDNT have connections with our biggest adversaries. How do you communicate without rapport?
Kamala Harris Is The Best At What She Does!!  So Very happy To See Her As Biden's Running Mate!!  Time To Get To Work!!
Hey talking loud and saying nothing Jimmie boy I see you are running scared also of Biden/Harris.üòÉüòÉ
I rather elect Barack Obama to a third non-consecutive term than have either Trump or Biden get elected
Trump said a very messed up thing about His daughter and was good friends with Jeffrey Epstein and Joe Biden has touched many females of all ages without consent Yeah I‚Äôm pretty sure both of them are Pedophiles #EndThe2PartySystem #VoteThirdParty
Would it really surprise anyone if either Trump or Biden turned out to be pedophiles? Many people in the entertainment industry as well as business and politics have turned out to be Pedophiles so it‚Äôs possible Trump and Biden could be too and there‚Äôs clues to suggest both are
Retweet it If You are not voting for Donald Trump Like if You are not voting for Joe Biden Do BOTH  if You are not voting for either of those douchebags &lt;3
Nothing Trump can say to try to scare Americans, claiming that Biden and Harris are extremists, could be half as scary as the Hell that we have experienced for the past three and a half years and is getting worse by the day.  Nothing begins to compare. Nothing.
Happy Thursday!!! Cool profile pic!! Are you a pirate in this one? Have a great day!! I know I am!!! Biden 2020.
If people don‚Äôt want Trump or Biden then they should vote third party TBH
Fuck Trump and Fuck Biden both of them can go get fucked in the ass at ram ranch by 18 naked cowboys
Everything about Trump and Biden is surreal
Timing is everything. It wasn‚Äôt his moment. It‚Äôs Biden‚Äôs moment, finally. Hopefully  Booker won‚Äôt have to wait that long.
Was his name Joe Biden?
Trust VP Biden ! Trust him to #BuildBackBetter ! We must stop the free fall of OUR people dying from COVID-19 and seriously look into Economy Recovery  2.0 (Obama-Biden was Economy Recovery 1.0)!
I‚Äôd drag my balls over a mile of broken glass to vote for Biden-Harris.
I'd vote for any of the Simpsons over Trump and Biden anyday
I remembered people pleading for Prez Obama to do something w recession after he won in 2008  even before his inauguration! People forgot it was Obama-Biden lead the recovery to a flourish economy! I strongly believe #BidenHarris2020 is the best ticket to repeat this!
Pence-ive about the future? Just Biden your time until November 4?     big announcement, tomorrow, 8/13/2020, and give your future something amazing!
Kanye will take votes away from Biden... educate yourselves my people!
They have the same mentality when Biden makes the occasional gaffe. Trump can barely string a coherent sentence together most of the time, but they fixate on a few stupid things Biden has said.
trump: I'm from missouri. If we were to move the polls and get your lead over Biden down to a point or two(within the margin of error) could we get some shiny new buses? We are working on it. VOTE ALL BLUE !!
I missed the big event with Biden &amp; Harris. Was at the Dr. finding out I might have throat cancer. yes, #afraid
I think one term is a good idea for Biden. I didn‚Äôt realize he would be so old in 4 years.
Chuck Todd is such a little boy. Will the voters in Madison Wisconsin be energized enough to vote Biden Harris . From a 70 year old  how the fuck did your Protest vote work in 2016? As a lifelong Democrat I have never blamed Trump voter they voted. Democrats apathy thanks
You say that but then Biden says if you don‚Äôt vote for him your not black. Like I don‚Äôt agree with both but both say dumb stuff.
That‚Äôs exactly what we want.  Tucker just made a case to elect Biden/Harris.
What should the Biden/Harris campaign song be?
if you actually listen to what gen z is saying you‚Äôd care that we‚Äôre still voting for biden in november. we‚Äôre not going to suck his dick though. we‚Äôre going to be just as critical of him as trump
Joe Biden/ Kamala Harris will be the next President &amp; Vice President of the United States of America Vote Blue 2020 end Republicans cover up madness of hate immoral racist bigot vile behavior
Hm... representation does not matter I don‚Äôt care who is up in the seat as long as they do a good job. A woman who said she believed in the women accusing Biden... then standing next to him smiling as big as she can is somewhat sketchy to me. Btw I‚Äôm half Asian too.
Biden is life long Catholic and you know it. You're trying to deceive or just being petty This is so beneath you. Stay out of politics and take care of your flock
Yep! No way Biden has spent any resources there including get out the vote efforts
He would've cheered for whoever Biden picked lmao he has no idea what he's talking about
The upcoming election feels like 2016 all over again. I‚Äôm not a fan of Biden, but I‚Äôm sure the fuck not voting for Trump‚Äôs racist ass. üòë
that bitch K. Harris did call Joe "Dimwit" Biden a racist.  Your a stupid "Never Trumper" you azz.  No wonder I never watch your shows on Fox Business. Your A Damn idiot.
trump: Joe does smart things he is not like you and does not do things based on childish emotion. Return the country to adult leadership! BIDEN HARRIS 2020
I suppose you want four more years of hate, name calling, lying?  Biden/Harris will bring a level of decency that is now nonexistent.  They will reach across the aisle to form workable solutions to our economy, job formation, education and healthcare.  They will not obstruct.
Perhaps because she identifies as an African American.  Perhaps because her views on Biden were he was a racist pervert. #PhonyKamala #PhonyKamalaHarris
I am terrified that the constant request for money from supporters will hurt Biden and Yourself. Alot of us are about to lose our homes because of covid-19 and sudden unemloyment. My middle class community is rife with pre foreclosures. We are out here tredding water.
Have you not yet figured out trump that, in our opinion, if it comes out of your mouth it is absolutely guaranteed to be untrue. You might want to take that into account when you craft your next lie!  No! That would be clever, you are not clever.  BIDEN HARRIS 2020
The IDIOCY of the Democrats, Progressives, Liberals, Left, Radical Left, for MOST IMPORTANT JOBS in the USA, Biden &amp; Harris PORTRAY a LIE in PUBLIC to GET VOTES, &amp; in TRUTH, HATE EACH OTHER, won't SPEND MUCH TIME TALKING TOGETHER, eventually, President Harris will TAKE OVER=GOAL.
For the first time in a long while, I'm beginning to see a ray of light. Trump was already headed for the trash heap, but Biden just made a decision that will surely provide a rallying point and build unstoppable voter enthusiasm to cast their ballot for him. #VoteBidenHarris
Thank you Gen McCaffrey for this tweet: "The Biden-Harris ticket is a powerful return to leadership competence and integrity and the rule of law. Sen Harris very experienced. Tough. Extremely intelligent. Also fully qualified to serve as President.‚Äù
Biden/Harris to be swapped for Killary and Big Mike?
Biden and Harris. Strange bedfellows indeed.
There‚Äôs was little chance with Biden he‚Äôd pick the right person but there‚Äôs few candidate the progressive hate more then Harris.    He had to pick the one black lady married to an old white guy?! üòÇüòÇ   She‚Äôs a shallow woman you see right though when she talks! A centrist dem üëé
The Clintons, Bush‚Äôs, Kerry‚Äôs, Obama‚Äôs, Romney‚Äôs and Biden‚Äôs. Small list with room for many more.
Kamala Harris will be awesome as VPOTUS.  She has the experience and backbone to stand up to Pence and Trump before the election and will be a key asset to POTUS Biden after they take over the White House.  Out Trump/Pence In Biden/Harris! #Biden/Harris 2020!!!!
What happened to joe Biden ?
iTrump and Republicans will not be re-elected Joe Biden/ kamala Harris will win in November and we have the Vote for the new Senate and gain more seats in the House of Representatives Vote Blue 2020
Trump looks punch drunk. Of course he always does but I Love that he doing more to get Biden elected than perhaps anyone else. His 'handlers' can't seem to keep him under control I say let's put this mutt to sleep.
I think it was going to be Amy Klobuchar since she helped so much on the night Biden clenched the nomination; however, Biden did well to go with Kamala. Trump knows for whom the bell tolls she is that last nail in his casket.
8 years of Joe Biden &amp; 8 years of Kamala Harris
It's a debate... even VP Biden didn't hold grudges... the opponents will lose ground if go after that.
Welcome. She's an experienced politician having been the L VP nom in 96 and a candidate for Congress. Would be interesting to see her on the debate stage with Biden and Trump
That was a long time ago. Things change. Harris called Biden a racist and is now his running late. Who cares?
TY   for the friendly note to remind others that  VP Biden is NOT favor for ABOLISHING the police!!! The last headline on this matter was an interview between Prez Trump and Fox's Chris W!!!  Bet it will be repeated till election day!
No one knew Tim. Everyone knows Kamala. This is Obama/Biden take 2 not Clinton/Kaine
I'm a 60 something white man who is over the top excited to vote for Biden/Harris. I love who they are and what they stand for.
Biden was maybe my 5th choice, but this ticket is the choice. Im all in. For the first time in 4 years I feel hopeful.
Kyle all jokes aside, We have to admit we don‚Äôt respect most of his chooses anyway.   It‚Äôs Biden, he‚Äôs gonna suck regardless!! #RealityCheck
That‚Äôs Biden.     What‚Äôs the worst pick he could make?!    That‚Äôs who‚Äôs he‚Äôs going with.      #Biden is gonna beg us to blame dementia soon!!!  #Clueless
First, you scare people with the "Biden will take away your God and religion" lie, now you are spreading another lie which is people will learn Chinese if Biden wins. Don, please, these are third-world dictators like Erdogan's tactics. Be better.
It was lost the day Biden announced his candidacy.
#Happy: Sen. Kamala D. Harris named as Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate
how do I obtain a Biden Harris yard sign please??
Biden himself grabs the swing off his "blue collar" persona(yes i know its fake). Kamala rallies the usual base.
Harris also has a good amount of star power, and that runs the risk of her outshining Biden, particularly if they win.
That said, Harris has significant liabilities. She has one of the most Liberal voting records in the Senate, there's plenty of issues with her time as AG (which Progressives will have issues with), but I think Harris injects energy into Biden's campaign.
Looking at this objectively, I think Harris is an alright pick. Biden severely limited his options by only going for a woman pick (and it reeks of pandering too), but Harris would be a good way to reach out to sections of the Progressive base and is a good public speaker.
There's nothing pragmatic or moderate about Kamala Harris. She's one of the country's most liberal Senators and would be just as bad as a VP as Biden would be President. We can't afford their socialist agenda.
Just realized with Kamala named Biden‚Äôs VP that Maya Rudolph will make more appearances on SNL
Are we seeing white smoke coming from Biden‚Äôs home in Delaware?
Maybe this will finally wake him up.  He sold out to the establishment by endorsing Biden and they fuck him in return and don't care one bit.  He'd still have his dignity at least for endorsing Sanders.
My guess is Rice.   Harris is a lighting rod.   And he‚Äôs big on a bond.   Him and Rice are close already.     #Rice   Total guess cause Biden‚Äôs a moron and has no political Instinct!!
Don‚Äôt ever take the blame.   It belongs with the people the shoved Biden Down our throats!   They didn‚Äôt even want him.   They just got stuck with him when the other besides Bernie sucked so bad.   This is the bed the made they have to not be able to sleep in it! üòÇüòÇ
It‚Äôs also possible they just did a red herring with the list and Biden still picked Harris.
You should realize that there are voters out there who don‚Äôt flip out over every little thing like a 10 minute speech at a convention.  Biden needs those voters not just ones who tweet about Trump in jail 24/7
Me for one possibly.  I would never vote for Trump. Supported Kasich in 16. Thought I would never vote for Biden. Then I read your responses to this post and I see a lunatic just like Trump screaming over a convention speaker.
dt: Does the more testing lead to more deaths. We lead in that category too. How does that work? The person says dt's gonna test me and i don't want that thing shoved up my nose so I'm just gonna die. Are you that dumb are do you think we are? BIDEN CAN DO BETTER IN HIS SLEEP.
Trump is busy raking the forest, or drinking bleach.., oh wait that‚Äôs right he‚Äôs golfing!!! Meanwhile over 160k are gone!!! Failed President !!! Vote Biden!!!!
How much did Obama and Biden unfreeze for the Iranians?  50 billion!
We get your point. Attack China because they would prefer Joe Biden, a stable and respected person. Ignore Russia's bounties on US soldiers because Russia is interfering again to help 45 be reelected. I pray you find your soul. You need a lot more Jesus.
A Trump legacy. He's destroyed virtually all of our European allies. Fortunately, if Biden gets into the presidency, he and Obama established excellent relationships with them. My guess is that they're anxiously waiting for him to win as I am.
Poor ol‚Äô Biden can‚Äôt remember where he left off in the middle of a sentence.
When your chosen line of attack is that Biden is a frail old man who is in decline, it matters when there is video evidence showing that he is neither of those things. Let‚Äôs see Trump ride a bike. Or walk down a small hill.
Damn... you and Joe Biden must have taken the same math
The crackhead on Hollywood and Vine wit two teeth and dragging one leg thru a pool of Covid could be his pick and I‚Äôm still rolling with President elect Biden! üíô
Another stupid tweet by one of Joe Biden‚Äôs staffers.
Which tells you it‚Äôs overweighted towards Biden
Biden's campaign is dead. It will not matter who he picks.
Other than the two Joe Biden signs and one Jo Jorgensen sign that I've seen in my blue Illinois town, I've seen a lot more Trump flags, signs, and stickers than any of those!  The fake news doesn't want to admit it, but we're going to go in person and re-elect the MF'er!
He has a lot of information on his website about his platform.  To be fair to Biden, he may not be saying much about his platform, but neither is Trump. Fox News keeps giving him the biggest of softball questions, and he can't say anything specific about his goals.
I read the poll numbers constantly. I know they don‚Äôt mean much but I can fool myself into thinking Mr. Biden will surely win
He should ride a bike so he can lose some of that weight. He is obese, you know. Pro tip- maybe don‚Äôt attack Biden for being frail and locked in the basement when there is video proof that neither claim is true.
I‚Äôll see you next January after Biden‚Äôs inauguration.
I agree with every podcast/radio clip you played.  Biden has the mental acuity of a doorknob.  The best chance the Dems have of winning is to lock him in his basement until November 4.
Biden will surround himself with the best and brightest. He will have a laundry list of wrongs to right in his first days, then he and his team will have to rebuild America from the ground up. He will need a Democratic Senate and House of Reps. to accomplish this.  Vote blue.
It‚Äôs really not for Biden, but whoever he picks
As Dr Biden said on CBS Sunday morning, she is not going to call him names. It's beneath her
If Trump‚Äôs voted out of office, so is Mnuchin.  Even if he tries to say that loans must repaid, Biden will invalidate this when he takes office.  He‚Äôs just making empty threats. He‚Äôs desperate, just like the Trump. They know they‚Äôre losing and they‚Äôre resorting to fear mongering.
Prediction: trump will end up with a vaccine that Biden will be stuck with and that will not work well for black peeps because it was not well tested on them.
It doesn‚Äôt matter if you like or dislike Joe Biden, that is very sad.
ABSOLUTELY, DEFINITELY, POSITIVELY OUTSTANDINGLY WONDERFUL FOR ALL HARD-WORKING AMERICAN CITIZENS, THANK YOU,  Mr President for LOVING ALL WE AMERICAN CITIZENS. If Joe Biden as a President would NEVER EVER MAKE SUCH a MOVE ... Joe Biden would RAISE OUR TAXES INSTEAD.
Mr Biden's pick is down to  or Susan Rice, BOTH with SOCIALIST IDEOLOGY.  Joe Biden's CHARACTER is HORRIBLE, picking a VP with SAME does NOT SURPRISE ME, THEY BOTH SUPPORT the SAME POLICIES.
Only way Biden wins is if his handlers lock him in the basement til November 3.  Every minute he spends in front of a mic is another minute closer to a Trump 2020 win.
If you believe this you don‚Äôt know how to read either! IT IS DEFFERED NOT DEFUND! I can‚Äôt believe how many people are purposely spreading misinformation. Biden is on record gutting Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, Welfare 3 times since 1984.
It looks like you can‚Äôt read or hear either. It‚Äôs DEFERRED NOT DEFUND! STOP SPREADING YOUR LIES! You are the same Joe Biden that has been advocating gutting SOCIAL SECURITY SINCE 1984! Don‚Äôt you remember? I do!
Joe Biden will not win the 2020 election.   Like if you agree.
Then why did Joe call Trump a xenophobe when he stopped flights from China? Why were there no supplies left for the American people? Why didn‚Äôt Obama-Biden do anything during the H1N1 pandemic of 2009?   #TrumpsCovidCoverup
I just telling myself Biden will win in November and anything Trump broke (everything) Joe will fix it.
President Trump ‚Å¶ isn‚Äôt the one advocating for abortions up until the moment of birth. I would say Trump is more a man of faith then you   Thoughts ?
Honestly, does anyone believe Biden would share such an important announcement with Fox entertainment?  I love the way the Fox entertainer tried to take a joke and make it a real story-just like they do with tRump!
Robin Williams refers to Joe Biden as rambling Joe Biden.   Must watch !
I think Biden will pick Harris
Love the mass attendance not optional reference. Reminds me of growing up in a home of faith. If you were too sick to go to mass on Sunday morning then you were too sick to do anything for the rest of the day. That knowledge usually perked me right up! Biden home sounds like mine
Can you imagine Biden talking to world leaders? If he can‚Äôt even read from a TelePrompTer, he can‚Äôt read. Being his VP WILL take over the country will not be represented. HARRIS did not win the Primary, so the people will not be represented.
What the actual fuck? Are you saying Russia is team Trump while China and Iran are team Biden? What top secret cold war bullshit is this?
Even Fox can‚Äôt hide Trump‚Äôs stupidity, corruption and incompetence forever. It doesn‚Äôt matter how much they alter their images or edit their audio, it is apparent in every word uttered from his lying mouth, and all America sees it. We‚Äôve had enough. Vote Biden and save America.
Trump and Biden will be campaigning at Ram Ranch little do they know their assholes are about to be fucked by 18 naked cowboys #RamRanch
Trump and Biden can go get fucked in the ass at Ram Ranch by 18 naked cowboys for all I care #EndThe2PartySystem #RamRanch
Joe Biden will probably choose Dick Cheney as His running mate to pander to Warmonger Rebloodlicans
Joe Biden says   #YouAintBlack
That‚Äôs not true. I vote based off who is better suited. I have concerns for both... far fewer concerns with Biden.
Oh this must be the Russian Bots trying to discredit anyone for Biden.  Too bad, sucker, it won't work this time. We will crawl on our hands &amp; knees thru broken glass, stand in the baking sun, pouring rain, sleet &amp; snow to vote for Biden. Trump will be carried out!
China versus Russia! If only someone had stood up and said stay the hell out of our elections or else: Russia Working to Damage Biden's White House Bid, Spy Agencies Say
The DNC fucked Bernie again for the worst dem candidate ever in Biden.  They'd rather lose the election with him than win with Bernie.  Its not about us, it's always been about the donors.
So if he chooses someone you don‚Äôt like, you will vote for someone other than Biden?  That has to be the stupidest thing I‚Äôve heard today.
At least Joe Biden is a human being.
Given #Trump‚Äôs limited vocabulary and propensity for name calling, I don‚Äôt doubt that he will soon call #Biden Biden a poopenhead;  after all,  a man who hates God, communities, clean air, voting, the military, and people in general would clearly be a poopenhead.  #incompetent
If either Trump or Biden see my face I hope it gives them Hell and if either of them see this tweet I hope it gives them Hell
Truth be told I‚Äôm voting Biden  and Truth be told I‚Äôm lying once again If He sees my face I hope it gives Hell
National Anti corruption Bureau Ukraine  Biden's pay for play Nabu leaks
Love all the Biden apologists on here.  Dude lost his marbles long ago.
#GoHomeJoe  Joe Biden clarifies comments comparing diversity in Latino and Black communities
If you think Biden is coherent your the issue!!!  #FridayThoughts
She gave one to Joe Biden.
God, and the Bible, when biden walks in the room:
SO WERE ALL GONNA JUST IGNORE TRUMP SAYIN BIDEN IS STRONGER THAN GOD? ü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Ø REMEMBER WHEN THE PRESIDENT WASNT A JACKASS? ü¶¨ü•í I DONT
TOO LATE, Mr Biden,  YOU ALREADY SAID IT, YOU MEANT EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID.  That WHAT you THOUGHT &amp; THAT is WHAT SLIPPED OUT.
Don‚Äôt forget the Adults blacks don‚Äôt sit with there kids in front of the radio enough &amp; colored kids liked to rub his legs at the pool when he was a kid.   I wish I made that up but that‚Äôs Biden.   #goneskiess
He chucked out going after Biden and calling him a liar on TV    He knows Biden was lying none stop on stage and Bernie never stopped it!  Cowardly
Ok so I started following you to see just what yall are trying to accomplish. But I am confused. You don't want Trump, you dont want Biden. So what is it? What's the end goal?
Well biden is basically brain dead....
oh 100% i hate them both don‚Äôt worry üòÇ biden may forget but when he doesn‚Äôt he can speak üòÇ
Ok but politics aside, have you heard any of the times that biden completely forgets what‚Äôs he‚Äôs saying
That's because you already support him. Some of the people who voted for Trump might vote for Biden if he refutes effectively the lies Trump tells. You and I know it's BS but not everyone does and they need to hear it and see it.
So this person would rather have four more years of Hell on Earth with Trump if they don‚Äôt like Biden‚Äôs VP pick? WTF? How short sighted can you be? We are trying to save America.
Its not that fucking hard. It is trump and pence or biden. That's the choice.
As far as political affiliation goes (Republican vs. Democrat), African Americans do tend to skew heavily Democrat. Latinos, on the other hand, do have higher levels of support for the Republican Party. I suspect that's what Biden meant, but he didn't state it very well.
So, everybody's jumping all over Biden for one stupid comment while ignoring the constant stream of stupidity coming from Trumps mouth. Anyone who's looked into political opinion polls understands what Biden likely meant.
And people freak out over one stupid comment Biden makes...  Seriously, do they never listen to Trump speak? I'll take the occasional verbal stumble over this any day.
I see a tide turning among swing white voters I know. But Biden needs more visibility
Well Biden is Catholic and Trump is a Klansman. They hate Catholics too.
Joe Biden has got to be more visible.  Not just visible to his supporters. Do network interviews and make an immediate kick ass dignified response to this desperate garbage
No one:  Trump: God, when you vote for Biden.....and I'm part of that one-third. Voted for Biden in the primaries, not going to vote for president come Nov unless Harris is replaced. There's a reason we didn't back her candidacy.
When Biden tries to claim responsibility for the Israel deal, but the people he really made a deal with come out and condemn it. Poor guy probably can't even spell Emirates.
Ralph Nader caused the Iraq War! anyway wish we had Bush back because he's better than Trump! also please vote for Biden, who supported war along with most democrats. but we all know the real iraq war culprit was the guy worried democrats were becoming too right wing
I‚Äôm voting Biden/Harris as a matter of harm reduction not harm elimination and because I‚Äôll already be there voting down ticket dem/progressive because Congress and my state politics are a mess.
Start packing your bag don and spectators ITS TIME FOR            BIDEN/HARRIS
joe biden's ability to laugh at the absurdity of trump's claims is a stupendous strategy.
He is in cognitive decline. My Father is going through the same thing. Can not keep a train of thought. This makes Biden with the Football a scary proposition.
Biden: I want to put more African American women on the federal and Supreme Court bench  Yall: Kamala isn't black enough
Hey talking loud and saying nothing Jimmie boy I see you are running scared also of Biden/Harris.üòÉüòÉ
Biden‚Äôs running mate gets announced, prison stocks go up.
Hey is ther a Joe Biden doppelganger . . . . . .or is he truly, hopefully one of a kind?
Once Biden-Harris win in November, people in positions of authority will cease their complicit acquiescence to #ThatFucker. They‚Äôll do it to save their hides. They‚Äôve already started distancing themselves from him. He will be taken OUT.
Biden/Harris ‚Äîwhat a winning combination!!
I donated to the Biden/Harris campaign last night and it sure feels good.   Please baby Jesus, don't let Trump win again. My mental health seriously can't take it. I swear the Trump administration is a HUGE reason why my depression is so bad and why my anxiety is SO HIGH.
Oh jees! She ain't the best, true. But fuck it! U can't hav ya cake n eat it 2. Dump HAS GOT 2 GO!!!! Current administration has NOT n WILL not FIX ANY of THEIR Fuck-ups! And dude will probably send us into a real life PURGE!! Fuck tht BIDEN/HARRIS 2020 (Can't be worse then this)
Who gives a Fuck!! Biden/Harris 2020. It ain't hard!!
. Joe Biden is going to win, his dementia gone fuck up and Kamala going to be the first female prez
Thankfully we didn‚Äôt have to find out how comparable it truly was because we had true leadership that took action and protected us! Had Obama/Biden been in office during COVID-19, you probably would have said the same because it too would have been contained.
Thought this was in reference to the Biden/Kamala ticket...but the Stl Blues are great too!
LOL, this is just sad üòÇ Biden/Harris has Team Trump RATTLED, y‚Äôall!
Exactly.  And did he think people should not like Biden coming through town on a hand car blasting Eddie grant? Regardless of his policies, Or how I would vote, I‚Äôm hopping on that hand car with Joe.
Doesn‚Äôt this show how hard Biden is willing to work to get where he‚Äôs going, even though he may have forgotten where that was.
I guess Biden?? Either way we still lose.
Um....i voted for Hillary and then Biden in the primary. But I'm not voting for him or trump come nov bc trump is a racist &amp; biden picked kamala. So ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Some of y‚Äôall dead ass think JOE MF BIDEN aka (creepy joe)(joe who is truly senile)(joe who said if you don‚Äôt vote for me you ain‚Äôt black)(joe who doesn‚Äôt even know where he is at most of the time) is some savior and great man who will turn this country around y‚Äôall kill me ü§£üòÇ
They‚Äôre equally bad. Biden is just a republican disguised as a Democrat.
This shld be spread and investigated ASAP  as a threat on the biden presidential nominee
Learning your candidates terrible history is not tearing down, it‚Äôs informing oneself. Why do you think young black/brown folk are not pleased? Kamala has sent so many black and brown people to their imprisonment. Regardless, Biden/Kamala have my vote. It‚Äôs the best choice.
Lol I‚Äôm not trying to tear down a black woman. In the middle of mass protests for black lives themselves and against police brutality... Biden elects a cop and prosecutor as his running mate. I would have voted for whoever Biden and his running mate would be regardless
Biden campaigning like look niggas gone vote for me regardless cause they don‚Äôt have a diverse mindset and as long as I get a nigga on the ballot I‚Äôm good . And it‚Äôs working . Y‚Äôall are eating this shit up .
Ok I can get behind that and see that but I can't pretend that Kamala Harris hasn't incessantly imprisoned people her entire career and that Biden helped deport thousands. We can't celebrate because we have to hold them accountable.
Although, if biden wins and then we had 8 years of Kamala, the natural order of things would suggest we‚Äôd have 8 years of a republican after Kamala. It pretty much always goes back and forth. I hate it here. I feel like we‚Äôre doomed.
. "The fact that Biden recognized Harris' debate performances as a sign of strength, even when she targeted him for a withering attack, is a tribute to Biden‚Äôs judgment and character ‚Äî in sharp contrast to Trump‚Äôs petty vindictiveness."
This has been Biden's theme song since at least South Carolina.
What are you holding in your hand while you watch Biden/Harris drag you for filth, a big mac or vodka on the rocks?
Biden &amp; Harris, this is what we need. Bringing our country together, not tearing us apart
Is it ‚Äú please go vote‚Äù or is it ‚Äú go vote for the democrat ‚Äú cause I‚Äôm telling you now if I go vote it won‚Äôt be for Biden
That's been Biden's theme song going back at least to South Carolina.
You say that but then Biden says if you don‚Äôt vote for him your not black. Like I don‚Äôt agree with both but both say dumb stuff.
Look, no matter how you feel about Trump, you can't actually rationalize a vote for Biden/Harris sheerly because voting for them undermines the non Trump Republican ideals you'd have to claim to  still stand for.
Do y'all not understand how awful Trump is??? Like pls just stfu and Vote Biden
We will see when the debates start. Gabbert who should be the dnc nominee destroyed Harris. Trump will destroy Biden no questions asked. How ever these should NOT be our choices. The fact they are our choices shows A. Americans are brain dead. And the government doesn‚Äôt care.
maybe you can't appreciate how ridiculous it is that the only other person they can put up to channel the anti-biden vote is KANYE WEST.
This whole post is sarcastic, I'm obviously gonna vote biden, I'm satirizing the people who actually bitch and say they won't vote for him because bernie or warren or whoever isn't the candidate. I think it wooshed you
Right. To ‚ÄúNot All‚Äù people: this will require more than voting. We have to actively defend this ticket. Anytime you hear negativity about Harris/Biden or ‚Äúthe parties are basically the same‚Äù you have to shut that shit down. No more going along to get along
Totally! He has no grip on reality. I‚Äôm a suburban ‚Äúhousewife‚Äù that works and so are most of my friends. We‚Äôre all voting for Biden!
LOL üòÇ These Republicans are turning out to be pretty great hype men for Biden/Harris 2020, tbh.   Bless their dumb little hearts üòÇ
People....LISTEN!!! Don't waste your time and energy on these naysayers and distractions. We have work to do!! Vote for Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris!! üëçüñ§üëç‚ù§üëçüíôüëçüíúüëçüíñ
And she is why we have. Trump. Biden will be why we have him again. I don‚Äôt see how dems do not see this. To be honest if they went with gabbert or yang they had my vote. But i could never think of voting Biden.
Biden cannot be President!! USMC
It's not small. Do not under estimate them or their support. I have a feeling their numbers are about to balloon bc of this Biden decision.
Do y‚Äôall really think Biden will win???
If anything Harris is back walking some of her primary talking points in order to fall in line with Biden.
my normie friend called me an 'extremist' cos i said i would've preferred bernie than biden as the candidate omg
I didn't put trump there. It's not my job to remove him. &amp; you're right, she's not the right kind of blk bc blkness is not flat. Seems like yt ppl are about to learn a valuable lesson about blk ethnicities. I voted for Biden in the primary. I will not be voting for him in Nov.
Getting his formaldehyde booster shots from Biden‚Äôs dr
Biden and Harris ain't looking at us, they're looking past us because they know they have black folks in their pocket. Are they the lesser of two evils? - Yeah, but how long are we going to be OK with evil?
Now do Biden
anybody who thinks biden and trump are "equal evils" hasn't been effected by trumps active anti-lgbt legislature/rhetoric. as a queer person, i implore every single one of you to pull your heads out your ass and do the right thing for fucking once and vote blue, even if it's hard
At this rate I‚Äôm just not voting this year. I hate Biden and I refuse to have a cop (former or otherwise) in the White House. Lmao
I love you both! I can‚Äôt wait to vote Biden/Harris in November!
Biden also has no selling points....

For the first time in a while? I guess he forgot that Biden was VP
I‚Äôll still vote for Biden, but let‚Äôs not celebrate kamala Harris as some progressive savior.
Ever since Kamala got picked as Biden‚Äôs running mate it‚Äôs just been one big divide amongst that decision.
Yes I am. She's not African-American AND she's married to a yt man. It's a HELL no. Biden should have read the room. He had a list of qualified African-American women to choose from &amp; he instead opted for the biracial Indian Jamaican raised in Canada &amp; married to a yt man.
He‚Äôs even ready for Biden to take over.
Trump is the phony one and is going to lose to Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris. That is why Trump is trying to CHEAT and wants help from Putin!
Kamala Harris as a running mate is a power move by Biden!!
i cant believe joe biden is our best option why
Biden only chose Kamala as VP for the pass
Liberals say ACAB and defund the police and then tell people to vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as the solution to that with no irony whatsoever
But yea imma still vote for Biden. Sucky option but shit anybody but Trump
I do mam.   Aint nobody said they aren't voting. We're not happy about it. Joe Biden is literally racist as hell and Kamala put people in jail like a human terrarium.
"Descendant of Jamaican slave owner who was a ruthless prosecutor of petty misdemeanors becomes 1994 crime bill writer, Joe Biden's, VP."  Why would anyone question this combination, right?
Every day Biden is doing everything in his power to get people to not vote for him
A little disappointed that Biden didn‚Äôt choose Seven as his runningmate, but whaddya gonna do?
Many people know that Biden has mentally slowed and the VP will be president...arguing about Kamala record won‚Äôt work...it‚Äôs not happening
Y‚Äôall shit talked Hilary so bad and look where it got us. Don‚Äôt let history repeat itself. We need Kamala just as much as Biden right now. We gotta get Trump out of office .... it‚Äôs been a shitty 4 years. I‚Äôm good on 4 more lol
Ready For Progressü•∞ Team Biden, Harris and WE The  PEOPLE Winning the 2020 Election war. GOD'S Blessings and Favor every Second of every day.   and
In comparison to the segregationist Joe Biden, she looks far-left.
That's not hard considering that Biden is senile.  Doesn't matter matter though because people don't like her. That's why she dropped out of the primary 3 months before Iowa.
These people are just like Biden. They think that all Black people are exactly the same.
My prediction for Biden‚Äôs cabinet picks: Attorney general Val Demings Treasury sec: Elizabeth Warren  Chief of staff: Cory Booker HUD secretary: Bernie Sanders Foreign policy: Valerie Jarrett
Perfect! One more reason to vote Biden/Harris!
Who is, do you have a list, everyone I know still on board with TRUMP 2020, who in their right mind would vote for Biden.
Y'all think its jokes but that show Veep was real shot. Nobody's actually a true liberal and everything is driven by money. You know damn well Kamala and Biden kissed and made up for the power.
Yo this wasn‚Äôt even to your tweet üòÇüòÇ I clicked the wrong one. I‚Äôm hella impressed with Melo. This was to somebody Joe Biden tweet right above or below yours üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Trump‚Äôs line about Kamala being Biden‚Äôs living will was pretty good
Biden should have picked Al Jolson as his Vice President
In a STUNNING historic moment for the US, Biden's selection of Kamala Harris shows all POC women that they too can make it in America, provided that they spend three decades making life worse for their peers.
Biden is so weak that I'm guessing he will be under her....  Wait, you meant betting?
She and Biden are going to kick you and Aryan Pence's ass!  I can't wait for the debates.
"In selecting Harris, Biden demolished the misogynistic memes and condescending statements circulating about her 'ambition.' Yes, an ambitious, powerful woman is just the sort of person Biden wants to associate with."
Great choice Mr. Biden!!!!
to say there is absolutely no qualitative difference between a trump presidency + a biden presidency is wrong  flat out  debate nuances all you want but, if you‚Äôre not actively organizing for a legitimate/viable third party option...it‚Äôs quiet for that  üíõ‚ö°Ô∏è
Biden was maybe my 5th choice, but this ticket is the choice. Im all in. For the first time in 4 years I feel hopeful.
Does she still believe Biden's accusers?
the biden/harris administration has promised that under their watch there will be no more "kids in cages". all the kids they deport will be free range and certified organic
I‚Äôm so happy about this! Can‚Äôt wait to vote Biden/Harris in November!
and jill biden is no slouch. it's such a remedy for melania.
just the optics of the biden/harris ticket are stupendous. smiling, happy vibes. and sorry but she is SO damn good-looking.
Definitely not a fan of Harris being Biden‚Äôs running mate

He‚Äôs not going to recommend we inject bleach into people to cure COVID, so I‚Äôm much more confident in him than the current POTUS. Imagine making fun of Biden when the alternative can‚Äôt even answer a question without losing his train of thought.

I mean the two are interchangeable right?! They're both pedophiles. No a "big deal" to swap one pedophile with mouth diarrhea for another pedophile with.... mouth diarrhea?  But that one was about Joe Biden üòï

What about what he said about Joe Biden?! ‚ô°
Susan rice is about as close as Biden could get to Hillary. Take the L
This is 100% a meme making fun of Biden, but gotcha...
Y'all be so quick to diss biden on his low cognitive functions as if trump isn't doing the same ass thing
Biden saying he would choose a woman for VP so early in the election cycle was 100% pandering but it was a promise he made. If he chooses Pete lmao man, my dude. You're gonna make people so mad.
I have also stopped following Joe Biden
This is ridiculous.  He is just basically getting free ads against Biden.   Thats all this is.
Why does Trump want to Debate Biden at all?  He gets to lie, unchecked, at his basic "rally" , what used to be a press counference.
I thought, and still think, that Biden made a huge mistake when he committed to selecting a woman. This demand is another very poor idea. There are many highly qualified candidates. Biden should choose one who (1) will be a good VP and (2) wants the job.
I‚Äôd like to propose a live pay per view event: Joe Biden attempting to sing ‚ÄúThe Itsy Bitsy Spider‚Äù all the way through from memory. Think of how much money the betting industry would make.
Yes i do. Because just like with Hillary be trump I‚Äôd rather see what happens with him than Biden. Again if if we‚Äôre tulsi gabbert I‚Äôd be voting for her 100%
I‚Äôve also stated if it was yang or gabbert over trump I‚Äôm going with yang or gabbert. Biden has been in politics for 50 years and has done nothing good for the American ppl.
I‚Äôve said that in almost all of my reply‚Äôs....the current outspoken dems have made me turn more towards rep and that unfortunately means trump. The bullshit system should not be giving us this 2 party bs. We should not be voting between trump/Hillary or trump/Biden. All shit.
A. I do not watch the news.  B. I‚Äôm not on a side. Well the American ppl side. C. I do not have a team. I do not have a stake in the game. I don‚Äôt treat politics like a religion like the rest of the ppl commenting.  D. If you think Biden will do any good look into what he‚Äôs done
Not condoning the riots. Not letting ag Barr talk at the hearing. Using joe Biden as a puppet. Saying to defund the police. Calling trump a nazi. Calling anyone who disagrees a nazi. Cancel culture. Trying to remove guns. Using covid to sway the election. The list goes on.
First off only idiots and old ppl watch the news. Secondly I‚Äôm not on a side. Well atm I am more on the trump side due to how crazy dems are being and their silly ass choice in Biden. But like I‚Äôve said I would of voted dem if it was gabbert or yang. Fuck even Bernie.
Lol. First of all sure bud. Second of all idc. Biden is a shit human. Just like trump. Neither should be president. Biden has done nothing good for this country in the 50 years he‚Äôs been a politician. Dems should of went with yang or gabbert and you would have so many more ppl.
Joe Biden can‚Äôt even handle a debate due to his cognitive decline. Either he‚Äôs a robot or he‚Äôs really in a fast, downward spiral. How would he focus on climate when the coronavirus has everyone‚Äôs attention? What about the kids being rescued? #SaveTheChildren
this is the hollywood version of "they are dating," if biden even talks to a woman. every conversation puts her on the 'short list'. this ain't the one,
Democrats should have been on TOP OF THIS STORY FROM DAY 1.  I am sure the machines are programmed to "switch" Biden votes to TRUMP votes.   We are doomed! ü§¨
I would STILL vote for Biden!!
No Democrat/Biden supporter should vote by mail or use anything but a paper ballot. It‚Äôs insane we are waiting around for Trump to completely corrupt our election. He should be removed now.
Then phone bank for biden getting mad on here isnt helping your cause
Just make calls for joe biden
Trump has accomplished more in 3 years with constant daily attacks on him than biden has in 40 years but hey joe means business now
And hillary was innocent of all the crimes even comey had to admit she did right ???? And biden is a genious right lol???? Admit it you hate america !!!! Trump lowered your taxes fool. Trump stopped the tax of $1600 per year on people that didnt have insurance which was illegal
As of the day you announced that you were running you NEVER had my vote. Biden is not perfect. But he‚Äôs not you. And I would vote for that guy who makes a asinine statement over someone who is a complete ass any day.  How many more people died today because of YOU
Yeah Biden hates that passage where Jesus slipped in the extra commandment "Thou shall not leave the house without packin"
I mean the whole talking point(maybe not with you) is that he‚Äôll pull votes away from Biden. Like maybe that‚Äôs the mistake of the dnc for putting Biden on the podium. And while,I‚Äôll likely vote Biden- I do think the dnc deserves to burn.
Lol dafck going on bruh ü•¥  Intelligence community's top election official: China and Iran don't want Trump to win reelection, Russia working against Biden
lmao....both would probably fail. But I would still vote for Biden. At least he would still listen to those around him...unlike Trump's demented ass! üò°
Trump wouldn't take a swing at a MAN...only his ex-wives and other women.  Let him try it....Biden would kick Trump's ass!! üò°
Well, to be honest, Trump is on record of saying that latinos entering our country are all rapists, drug dealers, and murderers....this statement from Biden is not that.
Well said, Leah, and I completely agree.  The position that  holds in a Biden admin isn't as important as that she be the one tasked to coordinate the investigation into the deep rot in the WH, Congress and financial institutions
I'm trying to understand what's the issue... everything....and I mean, everything is an opportunistic moment ... what Biden says needs no clarification... but African Americans do. Do I need to clarify that?!
he just revoked Biden's n-word pass
Joe Biden with that racist comment üò¨
That may not happen It will backfire at Kayne West because there will be a Biden-Democrat Landslide coming on November 3 because of The escalation of The COVID-19 üò∑going on.
Considering Biden isn‚Äôt with it enough the VP is going to be a target, the media will spin it as Trump is attacking her because she‚Äôs a woman...and a woman of color at that. It‚Äôs a built in defense mechanism.
I like how no one talked about not voting for biden in the initial tweet but you are like already here ready to insist that is what the tweet was about
"Dear Diary, The Orange man can't say a single word without people realizing how much better of an option he is than Biden. How do we continue to be good little resisters? XOXO, Little Jimmy"
If Biden loses any state by the number of votes that Kanye West gets in that state, then they deserve 4 more years of Trump. If that is the master plan, then we should be good, right?
Yeah, and what exactly is Biden offering Black moderates?   Name ONE policy for Black people. ONE
They need to implement a comedy show staring Biden. He would get a lot of polical laughs
That's why I always vote &amp; I will be voting for Biden because I just can't see Myself voting for Trump.
Such a weirdly cynical thing this is  Forbes: Exclusive: Kanye West Indicates That His Spoiler Campaign Is Indeed Designed To Hurt Biden.
Its not that fucking hard. It is trump and pence or biden. That's the choice.
Trump is going to get nailed in a Biden-Democrat Landslide on November 3.
That's what they do. They deflect &amp; ignore the dumb ignorant stuff he says and only focus on Biden.  There are no good choices in this election.
While I'm very happy with Biden as our nominee, I often ponder whether Kamala would have won the nomination for president if Biden hadn't sought it.
If Joe Biden could just shut up for 3 months and stop making idiotic comments, that would be great.
How about Joe Biden is better.
You ever left your city? Black people on the coasts aren't like Black people in the Deep South or the Mid-West or the Southwest.   Also, just because older Black people are on board with Biden doesn't mean that the youth gives AF about him.Technically, we will still be waiting even if Biden gets elected.
DEMOCRATS R D  DOMESTIC ENEMY! WE MUST ARREST THEM BEFORE THEY DO MORE DAMAGE!‚Äô BIDEN MUST B REMOVED FROM D TICKET HE HAVE DEMENTIA ! OR HE CAN PROVE IT  THAT HE IS OK DURING A DEBATE W/ TRUMP ! BUT HIS HANDLERS DO NOT APPROVE IT! HE MUST DEBATE W/ GENIOUS TRUMP !TRUMP  2020!

Far enough left for you that you fail to see they have been moving hard left of where they were years back, or in Biden's case, before the candidates left of him pushed his platform left over the last year. Take the W's &amp; keep pushing. Cynicism won't move anyone

Mask wearing by all of the experts does NOT require mask wearing outside unless you are violating the basic distancing rules, period!!!!! Biden and Harris off base scaring Americans who are outside, following all of the rules without a mask are actually worse off wearing a mask!

This girl just said ‚Äúyou said you‚Äôre not voting for Biden, so regardless of who u vote for ur vote is going to Trump.‚Äù Man 2020 has revved up the stupidity amongst Americans.
This is equally as misguided tho b/c same argument also applies to Rs. If we want to talk about something meaningful we should be talking about removing barr/devos/etc, saving USPS, continuing to win small seats, not having unmarked feds in our cities. All more likely under biden
This is spot on (thread)..üëáüèΩ  Biden is badly miscalculating by playing up panic porn. America has had enough. It wants:  -Schools open -Restaurants open -People back to work -College football -Minimal, reasonable social distancing -Individuals empowered to manage their own risk
Voter Fraud has ALWAYS been a more real problem and a more credible threat than voter suppression. Voter suppression requires you know how someone plans to vote. And there's only one candidate who claims to be entitled to votes: Joe "if you don't vote me you ain't black" Biden
Every Berner I know would happily support AOC for president including myself. I don't think you've got the read you think you do on his previous supporters. There are a variety of women Berners have suggested since Bernie stabbed us in the back to endorse Biden.
But trying to make this an issue just guarantees people will cry fowl on election night. If Trump wins, the dems will bitch about "voter suppression" and if Biden win Trump will bitch about voter fraud. But only one of those two has a leg to stand on.

Holy cow. Ok. Nowhere did I say that Trump was good, or even better than Biden. The question was: You're assuming that Biden will make a good pick for SC. Why would you assume that? And what will your response be when it's a bad pick just like the ones he's made in the past?

I'm shocked at my own inclination to vote for Biden not necessarily because it says anything about me, but because the last 6 months of Trump, Qanon, and Covid19 have been so abysmal that I just have to do my part to make sure Trump loses. And I absolutely despise Kamala.
Ah so when you support Joe Biden who‚Äôs says ‚Äúyour ain‚Äôt black‚Äù if you‚Äôre black and don‚Äôt support him, or who says all black people are the same or who did the eulogy for this man he‚Äôs holding hands with, you‚Äôre not a racist?
He has still not removed tweet   Biden is Catholic but not Catholic enough for him
Ok Jared! Stop this silliness. Congratulations, no one believes you were ever going to vote for Biden anyway.
Imagine if Biden tried to get rid of idk, say the US Postal Service, in order to help himself win re-election. I bet the media would lose their minds over that.
Yeah, this seems like bad messaging from Biden.   We need to a simplified summary of:  - Outside if you can't physically distance - Inside everywhere except your own home with your own housemates  (Figure from Covid-19 Recovery Consulting,

If you want to vote for joe Biden because of ‚Äúdamage control‚Äù go ahead. That‚Äôs your choice and I understand it and respect it but stop telling me that I‚Äôm ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äùsubmitting to fascism‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù
Casting a vote for Joe Biden will not defeat US fascism, it will not start a revolution. Little, if anything at all, will change under Biden. It will give people a false sense of hope. Again, fascism did not start in the US with Donald Trump, and will not end with Donald Trump
The only thing that can stop fascism is REAL CHANGE for the working class, and Biden does not bring that to the table.
Fascism requires control of the government to be in the hands of a few. Biden has repeatedly catered to the wealthy elites, said nothing will fundamentally change for them, and that they would keep their standard of living.
The Democratic Party will not compromise with the people for basic necessities, but they WILL, however, sit down and willingly compromise with fascists. That is just as bad. Maybe Joe Biden‚Äôs not a fascist to your definition, but he‚Äôs a racist, neoliberal, war criminal.
I feel like it‚Äôs really important for people to understand that fascism didn‚Äôt start with trump and it won‚Äôt end with trump and if we want to actually get rid of fascism in the US, we‚Äôre gonna need to do a hell of a lot more than vote for Joe freaking Biden

Be an adult and vote for Biden like the rest of us. Enough of this childish bullshit.
How is that clear, when all we had was him losing the first 3 states, then a total DNC reshuffle with everyone dropping out except a spoiler for sanders and everyone else rallies behind biden to prop up a single establishment candidate.
so do you think a Biden presidency would not clearly be a reduction of harm, policy-wise, as compared to a second Trump term?
Because if you were going to hold the microphone up to your face, the phone would naturally be upside down in your hands, you dolt.
We definitely don't want him to honestly on-paper win the election though. If only because it forces him to falsify or ignore results. Like yeah its naive to act like voting Biden is "enough" but the value of voting is still greater than zero.
No I was trying figure out what was outrageous, what has happened now that Biden needs to call out. I can‚Äôt watch/to politics where I am at today. trump supporters.
Hey what's Missouri's COVID numbers looking like with Parson and a Republican Assembly?

4 of trump, but you wont' get 8 of Biden. You get 2 Biden, 2 harris, and 8 of Tom Cotton
If Biden were ever to become President, we would get five for one or 4.5 for one. There is Doper valley girl Buppie Kamala, Self hating Israel hating Bernie, the Squad, Al Sharpton and at least half of Biden's half brain. So 1/2 x 1/2 plus 4 equals 4 and a half for one Joe.

This is why they think Biden won the nomination?!?!? While certainly that is part of if... also combined with the fact that he was basically the only candidate not a communist or socialist.
There is a lot of truth in this statement. Remember, more than once Rashida Tlaib has said she does not favor a 2 state solution. Just one state. She said it again recently on an interview on why she won't endorse Biden.
Yes they have been doing that for 50 plus years. They also said Iran and China are working to help Joe Biden. Unfortunately there's not a way to prevent all the foreign influence. People need to be smarter than to look at something on Facebook or Twitter when they vote.

Trump is also terrible and incompetent. Biden is colonialist. Trump is a white supremacist. Biden is also racist, but not a xenophibic nationalist.   We need a left party, but that isn't happening this time.   Let Dems lose to show 'em? That's what we did in 2016. It didn't work.
I truly believe most Trump voters and Biden voters are good people but in the end, everyone thinks the vengeance baked into their own party's platform is born from pure righteousness. There's nothing particularly magnanimous coming from the Democrat side of the aisle either.
It's so difficult. I did not vote for Hillary, and I do not believe I was responsible for Trump. However, this time I feel like if I would be. I have been voting third party in the GE for over 30 yrs. For the same reasons you just changed. Biden is terrible and incompetent.
I look at it this way- even if you aren't super excited about either candidate- Do you want to have the opportunity to ever vote for a candidate you really like? Then vote for Biden, because I seriously question the survival of democracy w/ 4 more years of Trump.   Not hyperbole.

Of course the job of campaigning is very different from the job of holding office; Obama may have selected Biden for the latter rather than the former, and being considered fairly competent as a VP may have compensated for his lack of skill as a primary campaigner.

It is impeachable, but Senate will not remove.  It will be a distraction from Biden and Harris and other Democrats running for election and reelection right now.  Since the results are a foregone conclusion, imo, it would be better to use our resources on the election.

Biden lied about how his first wife was killed for political gain, so this should surprise no one.
I know several people who claim Covid-19 will go away on or after Election Day. I don't get this way of thinking. If Biden wins and the pandemic is still very much overtaking the populace, wouldn't that disrupt their narrative immediately?
This mentality is why the left loses elections. Creating a false equivalence between Bush and Gore, between Biden and Trump. It‚Äôs total nonsense. It‚Äôs gotten us 2 decades of infighting because inadequate ideological purity. So they don‚Äôt turn out and outright fascists win.

He is in cognitive decline. My Father is going through the same thing. Can not keep a train of thought. This makes Biden with the Football a scary proposition.
Would love to hear Biden or Harris respond to this.  It's an issue that perfectly illustrates the divide we have in this country.  And so far, I have not heard one Democrat condemn, or even question, this kind of thinking.  Or even talk about it.

Biden Harris suck.   Can‚Äôt wait for a debate
"I'm just not convinced that Biden or Harris will push for M4A or defunding the police!"  News for you, sunshine. No one was ever going to. And those who claimed they would failed to get support from the majority. Your pet issue isn't the whole story. Vote for them anyway.
Biden helped to give me healthcare for the first time in my life with pre-existing conditions.  We both know it's not far enough or fast enough, but let's please not pretend like the party who gave healthcare to millions is the same as the one who voted 56 times to take it away.
When it comes to foreign policy, it‚Äôs an undisputed fact that the Trump administration has made the world safer.  is absolutely right that China, Iran, Russia, etc... would love to go back to the days Obama and Biden were running things. We can‚Äôt let this happen.
Best description yet of KamAla Harris----"Psychopathic Opportunist"..  Perfect.  Thanks  Hope Biden has a food taster if elected.....
Hey, Biden‚Äôs writers: this twisted/false version of what Trump said is so old, debunked and played-out, you do Joe and yourselves a disservice by using it. I guess you suppose/hope that people who read this have cognitive abilities similar to Joe‚Äôs (none).
He can't even fill a Highschool gym floor with supporters, while Trump fills arenas...There are usually more people standing in line for the bathrooms during a Trump rally than there are at any Biden rally...That's a fact.
That's definitely true. And in the end it won't matter because Jews are still going to vote for Biden at a minimum 2:1.  I'm personally happy because once COVID is over I can finally take the cheaper flights to Ethiopia.
Right now the republicans are so panicked I‚Äôm surprised they haven‚Äôt claimed Biden can‚Äôt be president because he was born on Mars
Thank you for volunteering to help the Biden/ Harris ticket. Your story brought tears to my eyes. We have reason to hope.

It's not just Kamala Harris. President Trump has also struggled to land on a simple narrative against Joe Biden, or in favor of his re-elect.  My analysis on Trump's messaging struggles and what it means for 2020:
commercial crew is rlly an extension of commercial resupply which can be tied to bush ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  I wouldnt expect nearly as much money to go to nasa if biden wins and dems control congress.   funding nasa doesnt hold up to the virtue signaling of the left.

That was the pandemic. Biden didn't want to close borders early. Would have been 10x worse.
Trump needs to dble down on stopping child trafficking - use for re-election. There is a big social media movement and needs to hit mainstream. Dems electing pedo's - Joe Morrisey. Make Biden &amp; Kamala denounce. Trump's numbers will jump!
Joe Biden is actually like that old pair of jeans you only use to mow the lawn and clean out the gutters. The crotch button is missing and sometimes the zipper comes loose by itself. Joe reminds us that things can always get worse. Let's fall off the roof.

They definitely couldn‚Äôt do worse. Trump only cares about numero uno and the rest of us be damn. Biden/Harris will have the best interest of the entire country and world at heart.  #VoteBidenHarris2020
Biden agrees that‚Äôs survivors don‚Äôt deserve help, so presumably not.
I'm a libertarian socialist and I am NOT voting for Biden and Kamala
Hey man come on are u on crack? Joe Biden quote
Once Biden-Harris win in November, people in positions of authority will cease their complicit acquiescence to #ThatFucker. They‚Äôll do it to save their hides. They‚Äôve already started distancing themselves from him. He will be taken OUT.
Hey man come on man are u ajunkie? Joe Biden quote
Two true statements:  1. If you are alarmed about the state of the country, you should 100% vote for Biden and Harris in November.  2. You don‚Äôt thank the firefighter who saves your home if they are the same person who set it ablaze in the first place.
Joe‚Äôs alright, but how do we get Biden impeached so Kamala can reignnnn #girlpower #BidenHarris2020  #reignonme #celebrateblackwomen
So y‚Äôall are voting for Biden?
So Biden does the hard work while listening to catchy tunes? I don‚Äôt think this conveys what you think it does.
One easy question for DOJ..or Congress..if Biden is elected..  Brett Kavanugh should be Impeached..or a Special Prosecutor investigate??
Not that Biden is a solid choice, however the argument that he‚Äôs a ‚Äúcreep‚Äù or ‚Äúpedo‚Äù is just ridiculous...  We have visual confirmation of Donald saying he‚Äôd bang his daughter if she wasn‚Äôt his daughter because of her figure. Like wtf is wrong with this picture??
I‚Äôm not really scared of Biden. I honestly don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs really the issue
Biden has flaws but Biden can b compromised and pressured by Blacks. I think we can get him in there and he can actually move things around...His problem will be the house üò¥
Honestly ... i don‚Äôt think most of us blacks paid attention to the entire election process. Are y‚Äôall really afraid of Biden? I don‚Äôt think Biden is really the problem. I think our Congress and Senste is really the issue.
They took down another joe Biden video. Censorship
Joe Biden‚Äôs tiddies tho.
The fact that you decided, instead, to bitch about it in this manner- for, like... 5 or 6 minutes on Tucker's show? speaks volumes  almost like you *wanted to promote a certain agenda or viewpoint*, not simply "correct Biden on an innocent gaffe", which could've been easily
Was Joe Biden's 'gaffe' REALLY worth you going on Tucker Carlson's propaganda show to bitch about it on nightly Fox??  Couldn't you just- oh, I dunno- HAVE MESSAGED OR TWEETED AT HIM ABOUT HIS MISTAKE?  Or told someone that knows him and who he listens to to "fix it"?
Biden says a lot of things, most of which are lies
is such a fearmongering, opportunistic piece of shit.  "he made a gaffe that sounds to me like he's ENDORSING SHARIA LAW! OMG"  Grow up... Also... further empowering Fox and Tucker Carlson's bullshit.  "classy" No principles whatsoever, other than

I don't think we are "moving in that direction." I think it is a not so subtle pitch to republicans who reluctantly voted for trump last time, and can be persuaded to go for Biden/Harris.
In the bagüòÇüòÇüòÇ. Biden/Harris is the worst ticket ever. Landslide for Trump

I donated to the Biden/Harris campaign last night and it sure feels good.   Please baby Jesus, don't let Trump win again. My mental health seriously can't take it. I swear the Trump administration is a HUGE reason why my depression is so bad and why my anxiety is SO HIGH.
Realize it will take more than one election cycle to make change happen. Just because change is hard doesn't mean we can or should give up. #GND and #MedicareForAll will never happen under Biden. As far as the environment and economic justice are concerned, Biden=Trump...
Top story: WATCH: New Trump ad hammers Biden/Harris over Joe's endless array of racial gaffes  see more
Biden has the muscle to empower himself to correct our course &amp; save democracy &amp; protect the environment. Autocratic Trump‚Äôs elitist train roars through a town, devoid of human activity because Covid has decimated the population &amp; economy. #TheLincolnProject
I love this biden train! But i would love to see the train run him down! After all biden &amp; kamala  Is a real Trainwreck!
LMAO fuck Jim Crow joe biden
I'll wait to see what she does if her and Biden take the White house. Their actions (and infections) will mean more than anything they'll say to a microphone. Can't be bothered with so-called campaign "promises" anymore.
There's a difference between revenge against personal enemies and revenge against the American people. Both are wrong, but if he's going to be petty it's gonna be over stupid nothings. Biden would reverse major Trump decisions anyways. Trump talks dumb, but he isn't stupid.
Oh jees! She ain't the best, true. But fuck it! U can't hav ya cake n eat it 2. Dump HAS GOT 2 GO!!!! Current administration has NOT n WILL not FIX ANY of THEIR Fuck-ups! And dude will probably send us into a real life PURGE!! Fuck tht BIDEN/HARRIS 2020 (Can't be worse then this)
And you think Biden is the solution? The guy who said China is not a problem, who was VP for the Russia "reset"? Get some sense.
1. Trump‚Äôs been trying to dismantle the ACA since inauguration. Biden‚Äôs part of the team that CREATED healthcare FOR people w/ PREEXISTING conditions. GOPs bungling will result in increased taxes because we have to pay for all the debt TRUMP‚Äôs incompetence created.
Who gives a Fuck!! Biden/Harris 2020. It ain't hard!!
Trump: Yeah I'm a racist, and I dogwhistle frequently, but... I'm not THAT KIND OF RACIST (i.e. Joe Biden and 'similar people')üôÑü§™
LOL  The Trump campaign is now trying to 'attack' the Biden campaign on "him being racist"  ...as if THE CURRENT PRESIDENT AND HIS ADVISERS are "really nice, tolerant and have no problems on race whatsoever"  I'm not 'defending' Biden's past racism, but this is SO FUCKING PHONY!
First thing we need from Biden/Harris is new, IRON-CLAD rules about conflict of interest. If they give you money, no matter how, they can't hold a position of power or influence in the administration. How many in Trump's cabinet and prominent agencies forked over huge bucks? See?

Kanye West is extremely dangerous and idc honestly..but Biden is too...and trump is not an option IMO so wat we gon do
Not as dumb as someone voting for Biden.
Watch parks and rec but only the parts where Leslie gets a WAP thinking about Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton
The Catholics who are voting for Trump because they don‚Äôt think Biden is Catholic enough are what‚Äôs wrong with the Catholic Church today
Dems, being a little slow, won't realize this is the new normal. But once Republicans have done it, Democrats will have to follow suit.  This, BTW, means no filling of the VP slot if Biden steps down during a GOP Senate majority.
If Republicans keep the Senate, I expect they will refuse to hold hearings, or vote, on any Biden appointments. Executive branch, judges, everything. Full shutout. And Fox News will shout Amen.  And with that, the process will be fully destroyed.
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate
Herman Cain is still sending out tweets dissing Biden. Ummm that's not at all creepy.
Joe Biden is a liar and a plagiarist.   He is the candidate of division and racial politics.
Kamala Harris/Joe Biden Event, blunts with the bff, lots of hockey
And I do respect the desires of people to have another AA or female on the ticket. It just kinda blows it's like this. Not quite as bad as it being Condoleeza Rice for the republicans but it can't feel great for it to be like this. Carrying water for Biden. But wtf do I know?
Fuck Joe Biden
It's really strange, I do not follow Joe Biden, I thought I only followed Trump supporters, but I just had to mute Joe Biden's tweets because the kept showing up on my time line.  And they were on my time line because people I followed had liked the tweet.  WTF
Fun article. (One grammar typo. See if you can find it?) But the outrage in the language is eloquent. Why former Republicans back Biden over Trump ‚Äî¬†and attack Senate Republicans
Several times I've seen people arguing about what Biden "actually said" or "meant" or something about "context", so I go to the full unedited videos and start transcribing...2 hours and 20 mm Hg later, I decide that the actual speech is even worse than what's being reported.
Holding out for you as Attorney General once Biden is inaugurated. Kinda fun to picture your case against the Trumps üòÄ
I wish Biden wouldn't have spent the first 20 min of his speech hammering how Black and Female you are, not how qualified you are. Can someone say "tokenism"? Still voting for y'all, but for God's sakes.
Biden outage too.
April Ryan  just made an ablist attack on  But is it accurate?  Well, I think ye would make a better President than Joe Biden.  April Ryan just said some horrible things; how can she be a reporter and be that biased? Aren‚Äôt they supposed to be #NPOV?
I am going to keep shouting this. What would you expect from The Washington Post? The post office will handle massive mail like they do during Christmas. You're only making excuses when Biden loses!
In fact, the best argument in favor of Biden is that he seems to be an excellent coalition builder -- much better than Warren or especially Bernie, for instance, who was particularly bad it. It is precisely for this reason that Biden trounced Bernie.
This tweet was from 12 March and since then Kamala has repudiated her support of #Medicare4All. Note that Biden had repeatedly promised to veto #M4A
So again some people apparently believe that Biden supports #Medicare4All despite him saying repeatedly he would veto it. Help!
On me I‚Äôll accept the criticism of Biden/Harris from Dems but from the people who gave us Cheetoh Chong? Naw
So follow this thread to understand the reality-free zone Kamala supporters live in, where Obama is a progressive, Biden will vote for #MedicareForAll, etc etc.   Commenter didnt get a single fact correct, but did know lol.
We get it, Jean. You ain't got nuttin'.
. Joe Biden is going to win, his dementia gone fuck up and Kamala going to be the first female prez
I don't want to get my hopes up with Biden/Harris. I'm excited  yet tempered. Trump has gotten away with almost every lawless and unconstitutional act there is.
Good for you! That's awesome!
Makes my skin crawl as a survivor of incest by my own ‚Äúfather‚Äù. But Biden also has issues with physical boundaries. Door #3, please, but maybe not Kanye. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Lord, we need a miracle!
Great idea!
Thankfully we didn‚Äôt have to find out how comparable it truly was because we had true leadership that took action and protected us! Had Obama/Biden been in office during COVID-19, you probably would have said the same because it too would have been contained.
Interesting that Kamala Harris deep-sixed an ongoing investigation regarding allegations against Catholic clergy following her election to AG.  Suggesting the book, Profiles in Corruption by Peter Schweitzer. Chapter on Joe Biden as well.
What did Obama/Biden do for black lives in Ferguson?
In reading about President Trump, I gather that he might be full of malarkey, a trait antithetical to the office he holds. If that is indeed the truth - as I believe it to be - then Biden is the candidate I support, as he has been unambiguous in his opposition to malarkey.
That is my prediction. We'll fall into a great depression, and Biden/harris will be Hoover figures. Tom cotton or another awful GOPer will sweep in and destroy them and the tiny remaining shreds of the Republic
Thought this was in reference to the Biden/Kamala ticket...but the Stl Blues are great too!
So you know Biden is also a racist, but you think the way to convince a black man to vote for him is to call them stupid because the country backed them into some imaginary voting corner 4 years ago?
Bullshit. You don‚Äôt speak for me. Watch me walk my suburban housewife ass up in there and vote for Biden. #BidenHarris2020
Biden and Trump are both racist, I can vote against both of them
No, I'm not voting for Biden or Trump
It‚Äôs a relief actually.  I love that idea of Biden announcing a cabinet level position 15 minutes before each Trump presser.
"If you are an anti-war pro-pot Bernie Sanders-liking class warrior type, Kamala does nothing for you."  Biden desperately needs to motivate this group, but apparently he needs Big Tech even more.  Great summary of key things to watch with Kamala, from  üëáüèº
Biden is a Republican in all but name. That's how he got your vote.
1. No 2. Stop replying to Kanye 3. You should not be that far off. It says to me that you're not fully aware of the political playing field outside of cable news framing. You should take the time to understand why certain people don't like Biden.
LOL, this is just sad üòÇ Biden/Harris has Team Trump RATTLED, y‚Äôall!
5- I could go on &amp; on, but you get the idea.  Identity politics / wokeness invariably behaves like a swarm of locusts. It devours everything in its path, &amp; eventually eats its own as the supply of victims dwindles.  This is Joe Biden's America. Vote wisely.  /endHow about we do a Dog Presser at 1:10 then go to Biden Harris
Vote for Biden. He isn‚Äôt going to destroy our country!

Funny how she was mad about Kavanaugh.  But, when it comes to Joe Biden,her ambitions come before her convictions. Remember, It was only a couple of months ago that Harris says she believes Tara Reade when she says that Joe Biden violently raped her.  What a filthy pig.
Don't forget, she also said that she believes Tara Reade when she says that Joe Biden raped her.

had a nightmare that joe biden slapped my ass and said ‚Äútell Twitter you got a groovy shitter‚Äù
So Joe Biden just put someone on the ticket with him who implied that he was a racist and said that his sexual harassment allegations should be heard. I thought he was running AGAINST Trump?! ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è but ‚Äúhistory‚Äù and whatnot.
Yeah... the binary decision is seriously crazy and ridiculous. But, for right now, it‚Äôs what we have. Biden could have selected Bing Bong from ‚ÄúInside Out‚Äù and I would still be voting for Dems. ü§£
Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate, first Black woman
The real winner of the Biden VP sweepstakes: Elizabeth Warren.
Joe Biden in email to supporters:
Biden selected California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
I don‚Äôt think she was even the safest choice, but I do think she was the most politically expedient choice. Biden probably views those two as the same thing, though.
God please spare me from the inevitable fancams of Biden-Harris that will come out in the next few days
Biden and Harris, the ultimate buddy cop duo
It‚Äôs just the third time in history a woman has been chosen as a running mate on a major party presidential ticket
Bill Kristol acting like Biden‚Äôs cognitive decline is alllllllll apart of the plan lol
Now honestly ask yourself to name 10 people voting for Biden, and 5 ppl who have his sign in their yard...... they honestly think we‚Äôre all this dumb......
I think the VP is gonna be told, 'Don't think -- even if you become president -- that you're running this show. You're gonna be a figurehead just like Biden is.' That's part of the deal.
The FBI said in a statement that it had received the subpoena and that the bureau had already been producing documents and information for Johnson's committee.
The choice offers Biden an unusual opportunity to unify a party still reeling from Trump's 2016 win and solidify its future.
I would love to know what their Plan B is if Biden can‚Äôt get to the election. They gotta be worried about that themselves.
That only shows how stupid Biden &amp; the DNC are!!!!

Neal (atneal_katyal), Biden and Harris should sue the insane Russian asset for injunctive relief re the Post Office dismantle, and you should represent them. Also, request appt. of a master to take over the USPS. File it Monday.  Thanks!
Don't know for sure whether Biden &amp; Harris have standing. One way to find out, file the suit. About appointment of a master, maybe, given Trump's statements &amp; PG's actions and conflicts of interest.
Wondering whether Biden and Harris would have standing to sue for injunctive relief.  Also wondering whether a court could be persuaded to appoint a master to take over the USPS, given Trump's admissions.
Or it‚Äôs a holiday based on this topic and they both reported a fact. Do you want Biden to change the statistics for originality points.
Vice President Biden is lying to Americans in order to advance his agenda. We‚Äôve seen countless examples of cheat-by-mail over the past few months, but he would like you to believe those were made up. Another lying Liberal.

Strange to think that the best ticket for the alt-right is Biden/Harris. Racist white supremacists looking for government to crack down on minorities have a stronger argument for supporting the Democrat ticket this year.
These new conservatives really love cops. If so Kamala is a stronger law and order candidate than Trump. Trump's been much better on criminal justice reform. The best vote to crack down on minorities is Biden/Harris.
They're lucky Biden didn't call her, you know the thing.

You can be excited about Biden/Harris. But if you care about criminal justice reform you have to be honest and admit that Trump did more for that cause than Biden and Harris, simply by undoing policy put in place and enforced by Biden and Harris.

BBC News - Biden VP pick: Kamala Harris chosen as running mate
Harris also has a good amount of star power, and that runs the risk of her outshining Biden, particularly if they win.
That said, Harris has significant liabilities. She has one of the most Liberal voting records in the Senate, there's plenty of issues with her time as AG (which Progressives will have issues with), but I think Harris injects energy into Biden's campaign.
Looking at this objectively, I think Harris is an alright pick. Biden severely limited his options by only going for a woman pick (and it reeks of pandering too), but Harris would be a good way to reach out to sections of the Progressive base and is a good public speaker.
There's nothing pragmatic or moderate about Kamala Harris. She's one of the country's most liberal Senators and would be just as bad as a VP as Biden would be President. We can't afford their socialist agenda.
Same with Trump and Pence. I would take Biden/Harris over Trump/Pence mayday.

I read the poll numbers constantly. I know they don‚Äôt mean much but I can fool myself into thinking Mr. Biden will surely win
You vote for Biden and you are anything but Conservatives! #MAGA
Wearing a mask on a bike ride. So flip‚Äôn staged.  Regardless, it doesn‚Äôt matter. Left loons are not voting for Biden anyway, we all know that. They just are not voting for Trump And Biden just happens to be the puppet they have in place. His family should be ashamed of themselves

He should ride a bike so he can lose some of that weight. He is obese, you know. Pro tip- maybe don‚Äôt attack Biden for being frail and locked in the basement when there is video proof that neither claim is true.
I‚Äôll see you next January after Biden‚Äôs inauguration.
Biden will surround himself with the best and brightest. He will have a laundry list of wrongs to right in his first days, then he and his team will have to rebuild America from the ground up. He will need a Democratic Senate and House of Reps. to accomplish this.  Vote blue.
Well he can‚Äôt write legislation through tweets, so I do t think it‚Äôs fair to criticize him for his team‚Äôs tweets.   View Biden‚Äôs full Climate Plan at:

If Trump‚Äôs voted out of office, so is Mnuchin.  Even if he tries to say that loans must repaid, Biden will invalidate this when he takes office.  He‚Äôs just making empty threats. He‚Äôs desperate, just like the Trump. They know they‚Äôre losing and they‚Äôre resorting to fear mongering.
ABSOLUTELY, DEFINITELY, POSITIVELY OUTSTANDINGLY WONDERFUL FOR ALL HARD-WORKING AMERICAN CITIZENS, THANK YOU,  Mr President for LOVING ALL WE AMERICAN CITIZENS. If Joe Biden as a President would NEVER EVER MAKE SUCH a MOVE ... Joe Biden would RAISE OUR TAXES INSTEAD.

Be nice to Biden  He is gonna over see your punishment.
That's because you already support him. Some of the people who voted for Trump might vote for Biden if he refutes effectively the lies Trump tells. You and I know it's BS but not everyone does and they need to hear it and see it.

As far as political affiliation goes (Republican vs. Democrat), African Americans do tend to skew heavily Democrat. Latinos, on the other hand, do have higher levels of support for the Republican Party. I suspect that's what Biden meant, but he didn't state it very well.
So, everybody's jumping all over Biden for one stupid comment while ignoring the constant stream of stupidity coming from Trumps mouth. Anyone who's looked into political opinion polls understands what Biden likely meant.
And people freak out over one stupid comment Biden makes...  Seriously, do they never listen to Trump speak? I'll take the occasional verbal stumble over this any day.

The Blue Wave stands for water over the Dam, 40 years of BIDEN as a public servant with 0 to show for it. TRUMP has done more for all Americans in 4 years than Democrats have done during their history. Blue Wave is a sinking ship with Biden and Harris going down with it. So
So a 44 follower liberal troll that follows 25 times as many people as follow her......which is proof virtually nobody gives a üí©what she thinks....... Actually is under the delusion Biden is sure 40,000 lives would be saved by wearing masks playing golf for the next 3 months. ü§£
Your ‚Äòresponsibility‚Äô, according to Biden, is to waive your ‚Äòrights‚Äô because of the scientists HE believes.
To liberals, Trump shows disrespect to NATO members for insisting they honor their 2% defense commitments. Biden has insinuated that if he wins, they can go back to welching.
That‚Äôs more people than Biden will save by mandating wearing masks playing golf!!!!!
I just think that in the end......the economy is going to be the biggest factor when someone votes. They saw what Biden did for 8 years.....then what Trump did before Covid. When they see during the debates Biden really has no plan beyond platitudes....it flips.
The debate over masks has moved to the presidential race:
Biden/Harris will ‚Äòcreate‚Äô millions of good paying govt union jobs making solar panels and wind turbines. So let‚Äôs see.....millions of oil and natural gas workers will be thrilled with the ‚Äòforced‚Äô career changes. Righhhhhhhht.
Biden/Harris national mask mandate, even outside, is specifically targeted at pressure for mail in voting. Fear. Convincing weak people that there‚Äôs a difference between going to Walmart and a polling station.
Biden‚Äôs ‚Äòexperts‚Äô.......40,000 lives saved by wearing masks playing golf......... Righhhhhhhht.
Why does the GOP fellate Trump?

I hope she plays a pivotal role in the Biden administration. There is still so much good she can do and I'm sure he will have a consequential role for her.
Start telling your Bernie Bros about the importance of VOTING FOR BIDEN/HARRIS! Your Followers are planning to vote you or Hawkins/Wallace This isnt how we're going to fix anything! DO SOMETHING FOR THE COUNTRY!

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris attacked the character and performance of Pres. Trump in their first appearance as running mates:

You say that like he won‚Äôt just yell ‚ÄúNo‚Äù and ‚Äúfalse‚Äù and talk over or mock Biden
I‚Äôm usually with you Kim, but if there is one thing we know about Trump, he will say what he means. If these are dog whistles, what do we call what Biden said when ‚Äúpoor kids are just as bright and talented as white kids‚Äù? Or ‚Äúunlike the black community...incredibly diverse...‚Äù?

biden was anti bussing. before bernie was in politics he was marching in the civil rights movement. both voted for the crime bill, bernie was the only one to apologize. the 93% rating from the ACLU speaks for itself. his rating is a perfect 100% in the current congress (116th)
Joe Biden has no say over who he picks. He doesn‚Äôt even know where he is or what year it is.

I don't think you should call Biden Sleey Joe anymore.  That nickname doesn't really describe him properly.  I think you should call him 'Barely there Biden' because there's not much of him left in there anymore.   #BarelyThereBidenIt will never happen. Even more so now that Biden nor you will answer questions of the reporters. And double more so if Biden doesn't Debate Trump himself. We are beginning to realize that Biden is hiding because he can't answer questions nor Debate. Time to change parties
Thank you  #BidenHarris2020 let's do this

Trump is going to lay down the FNF stolen card along with spying on him.  Anything to discredit Biden.  We are the Ace.
It will all be done and over before Biden has a chance to screw with them.

Niether can Trump.  That isn't the point.  Biden can be bargained and negotiated with.  You can't do that with Trump.  Id rather "fight" Biden than Trump.
Personally, I'd rather vote for Biden because I'd rather fight him than Trump.  Biden is actually somewhat reasonable and has SOME morals, Trump, not so much.
It will be how Obama/Biden stole Fannie and Freddie siphoned all the funds for their personal agendas leaving the shareholders nothing.

The only one gaming this Presidential election is the democrats. They are afraid and scared to have Biden debate Trump in the election. So now they hide him and say the world is not safe to do debates. LOL THEY ARE AFRAID LOL

I am a senior that is going to stand in line, no matter the length of time so I ca vote for BIDEN/HARRIS, and put it through myself.
Biden is actually right about one thing Trump has not done jack shit about Coronavirus He could have done something much earlier but He did not and We still have to deal with this shit because He will not get off his lazy ass and order more testing
Completely believable.  He is on record that he wants Trump to lose.   The only way that happens is if Biden is ‚Äúhandled‚Äù. If Biden participates in Presidential Debates, the veil is off and he is exposed as mentally disqualified to office.
Private prison industry backs Trump, prepares if Biden wins
Biden and Harris just called for a National mask mandate without explaining what that means. Then claimed that‚Äôs an example of strength. The Dems really screwed this up.
Love this.   It also reminds me of the constant push by the Right to describe Biden as "senile" are they really so unaware of their guy's faded mental health that they think it's a good idea to bring mental fitness into the forefront of the conversation?

Agreed but it is funny that Biden picked someone who identified as an Indian-American when they got sworn into congress to try and win the African-American vote.
Joe Biden was hit with one ultimatum that could cost him the election
This suburban housewife is riding with Biden!  And Kamala Harris!
I suppose you want four more years of hate, name calling, lying?  Biden/Harris will bring a level of decency that is now nonexistent.  They will reach across the aisle to form workable solutions to our economy, job formation, education and healthcare.  They will not obstruct.
Perhaps because she identifies as an African American.  Perhaps because her views on Biden were he was a racist pervert. #PhonyKamala #PhonyKamalaHarris

Trump looks punch drunk. Of course he always does but I Love that he doing more to get Biden elected than perhaps anyone else. His 'handlers' can't seem to keep him under control I say let's put this mutt to sleep.
I think it was going to be Amy Klobuchar since she helped so much on the night Biden clenched the nomination; however, Biden did well to go with Kamala. Trump knows for whom the bell tolls she is that last nail in his casket.
You can be excited about Biden/Harris. But if you care about criminal justice reform you have to be honest and admit that Trump did more for that cause than Biden and Harris, simply by undoing policy put in place and enforced by Biden and Harris.
That was a long time ago. Things change. Harris called Biden a racist and is now his running late. Who cares?

BBC News - Biden VP pick: Kamala Harris chosen as running mate
Harris also has a good amount of star power, and that runs the risk of her outshining Biden, particularly if they win.
That said, Harris has significant liabilities. She has one of the most Liberal voting records in the Senate, there's plenty of issues with her time as AG (which Progressives will have issues with), but I think Harris injects energy into Biden's campaign.
Looking at this objectively, I think Harris is an alright pick. Biden severely limited his options by only going for a woman pick (and it reeks of pandering too), but Harris would be a good way to reach out to sections of the Progressive base and is a good public speaker.
There's nothing pragmatic or moderate about Kamala Harris. She's one of the country's most liberal Senators and would be just as bad as a VP as Biden would be President. We can't afford their socialist agenda.
Really?!? Did Biden change his mind on Harris?
Biden just tried to get the African-American, Native American, &amp; the female vote in one pick. Harris father was Jamaican so may even get that vote. Not sure of her policy but I'm sure its strong left.
Same with Trump and Pence. I would take Biden/Harris over Trump/Pence mayday.

He has a lot of information on his website about his platform.  To be fair to Biden, he may not be saying much about his platform, but neither is Trump. Fox News keeps giving him the biggest of softball questions, and he can't say anything specific about his goals.

Biden will surround himself with the best and brightest. He will have a laundry list of wrongs to right in his first days, then he and his team will have to rebuild America from the ground up. He will need a Democratic Senate and House of Reps. to accomplish this.  Vote blue.

As far as political affiliation goes (Republican vs. Democrat), African Americans do tend to skew heavily Democrat. Latinos, on the other hand, do have higher levels of support for the Republican Party. I suspect that's what Biden meant, but he didn't state it very well.
So, everybody's jumping all over Biden for one stupid comment while ignoring the constant stream of stupidity coming from Trumps mouth. Anyone who's looked into political opinion polls understands what Biden likely meant.
And people freak out over one stupid comment Biden makes...  Seriously, do they never listen to Trump speak? I'll take the occasional verbal stumble over this any day.

I think you've prolly gathered by now that *I* hope Trump wins.  That being said, I'd rather see Biden win legitimately than to see Pelosi win (without running) on a technicality used as a loophope (by design). That's just slimy.
I know we lean opposite directions on this... But I'd recommend actually going to the polls if you can, regardless of how you vote.  I'd rather see Biden win legitimately than to see Pelosi become President in January because of a designed technicality.
Larry Kudlow expects large economic recovery numbers in 3rd and 4th quarter  Biden planes would be a disaster, let us not have our country become socialist it would take away our freedom is that not what our countries ideals were founded on freedom

Yep, strategy that many of us employed in this and the last primary. Bernie dragged Hillary left. EWarren and Bernie dragged the entire blue circus left. It a good thing and I support it. However, not supporting the prima donnas who r taking their vote and going home cuz Biden.
Guarantee that the Dems paid for it. This was their plan all along. Have her drop Out, Biden runs chooses her as a VP then if he gets POTUS he will step down she becomes president and Pelosi becomes vice president that‚Äôs been their plan all along. They know he is competent.

Nope, congress should be talking about how to fix it.  Biden should be telling people what is happening and using it to color Cons for sitting by idly while the Orange-menace runs roughshod over our Constitution.  Then Biden should pivot to positive messages.

So much racism. Let me translate:   The [white women] will be voting for me. They want safety &amp; are thrilled that I [protect them from black and brown people who] invade their neighborhood. Biden would [let the bad dark people invade] with [black man] Corey Booker in charge!
Was Biden my first choice? No. Will I absolutely vote for Biden/Harris so that we stand a chance at removing Trump from office? Yes. We owe it to all the marginalized groups and women who have been oppressed this entire presidency to stand on a united front against injustice.

If only your dad experienced the same pain that Joe Biden has experienced.  Maybe he‚Äôd be more relatable.
Three things you should think about: 1-It's odd that you're obsessed with Morning Joe 2-Biden knows the 1918 Pandemic didn't happen in 1917, but it seems that you don't. 3-Calling women names won't make you less afraid of them
will you be scrutinizing biden/harris at ALL? or will you just keep hanging around in trump's nutsack?
If you think that Trump's open fascism and kleptocracy isn't worse than a Biden/Harris administration then there is something wrong with you.  These things don't even belong on the same scale, much less are they remotely equivalent.
#ConspiracyTheories  has been kept in basement cause of mental issues, they wanted to keep his image intact to pick a progressive VP that wouldn't win the general. Biden gets elected, 6 months later, he resigns due to health reasons. And ta-da! President Kamala.
A line from a donor speech from last year does not demonstrate any equivalency between the risks and potentials of a Biden presidency compared to the prospect of Trump round 2.
last summer Joe Biden told a private meeting of rich donors that "nothing will dramatically change" if he got elected president so yeah, there's totally equivalency.
How the F do any of you think Biden is approaching even a tenth as bad a choice for president as a re-elected Trump? Yeah the system is fucked but there‚Äôs no equivalency.

Don‚Äôt forget when you vote for Biden you support a pedo AND a cop. Go fuck youself
I don't think he's left of FDR.  Sanders and his supporters have at least made Biden and the DNC give lip service to some progressive causes, which isn't enough, but is slightly better than nothing.

Russia is trying to undermine Biden campaign, top US intelligence official says
I was thankful our veterans are taking a stand and supporting Biden. This election is not about Republicans vs. Democrats. It‚Äôs about Leadership!
Oh I‚Äôm not saying that there‚Äôs much good at all to say about Biden. I don‚Äôt like either of them. It‚Äôs just crazy to see actual proof of stuff trump has done and says and then people just say it isn‚Äôt true. A 2 party system is üí©
As per Bishop Stika, "Biden is lost" This Practicing Roman Catholic WILL NOT VOTE for "LOST" Biden!
Obama is supporting #Biden2020. Like Elizabeth Warren is doing. Like Bernie Sanders is doing. Like AOC is doing. Like everyone that was against him in the primary is now doing. A vote for Biden is a vote for all of the above. Support progress not stubbornness, fellow Progressive.
Biden wades into controversy over race, ethnicity
If that is what this is, then Biden should have been all over Cuomo.  All I am saying is that Biden does not have credibility in saying what he said. Trump also lacks credibility on COVID, for other reasons. We need leadership at the national level, and it is nowhere to be found.
I'm not talking about this discussion, but the propensity of politicians to use this crisis to bash each other...Be it Biden or many others.
Biden is trying to use a state situation to bash Trump. Governors from both parties as well as the Presidential candidates all need to stop this stuff. The politicization of this crisis is making matters worse.
I used to think 30% of the Black vote was pie-in-the-sky thinking but Joe's got a LOT of time left!  The more he talks, the more u see who he really is

Right there with you.  Really wish Biden wouldn‚Äôt have said August 1st as when he was originally wanting to announce his pick, makes the wait agonizing.  He‚Äôs had longer than basically anyone else in recent memory to vet his candidates.  Don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs taking so long.
Hidin‚Äô Biden who has already admitted to plagiarism in the past has Faith in one thing and one thing only. Chinese Money!!  He sold his soul and the soul of his son to China!!! He will sell America the same way.
Biden is the schill chosen to sell the radical AOC, Bernie, Farrakhan, MuzBroHood agenda to the masses. Beware.

I don‚Äôt understand how she can say she‚Äôs not 100% for Biden, she‚Äôs 100% against Trump, and still not see that it means she should vote Biden. Trump and Barr are actively undermining our democratic institutions. It should be ‚Äúanyone but Trump‚Äù at this point. For everyone.
Bishop Stika calls him "lost". Biden is fully embracing abortion and leaving born alive babies to die. "Lost" is not the word for this support.
Joe Biden has been saying stupid things for decades, but liberals do not care as long as they can control this country. Biden will be their puppet if he wins the election.
I have no knowledge of anything but my gut tells me Biden is going with Rice.  Guess we will see, hopefully tomorrow.
is this a pro biden post referring to him with the phase "pedo"? hahaha
Joe Biden DIDN'T just LOSE ANYTHING you IDIOT. As far as saying "dumb things", TRUMP is the expert on that. I must've watched that interview a hundred times with TRUMP &amp; his little Sharpie chart claiming that America has "LESS CASES THAN THE WORLD". THANKS FOR THE LAUGH, TRUMP.

Trump claims Biden, a devout Catholic, wants to 'hurt God' CNN's Jeremy Diamond reports that President Donald Trump has been trying to associate former Vice President Joe Biden with the "radical left" and shore up support among evangelical voters.
The reason Biden hasn't announced a VP is because he's too weak to make the dart stick. He's gonna spend a week working out and try again.
Trump claims Biden opposes God
At age 77, I think we have to assume Biden will not run for a 2nd term. Consequently, his choice of VP needs to be one we can get behind for President 2024. Hopefully, he can pick one that can do that as well as help elevate the odds for this election.

Says the guy who had peaceful protesters beat to pose with a bible in front of a church, can't quote one scripture, and doesn't ever attend church, versus Biden who has been seen praying in church. Trump is a sociopath.*merrily votes for Joe Biden, an instrumental supporter of the invasion and occupation of Iraq*
I agree with pretty much everything you said... but unfortunately Biden won't do anything to help other than slow the bleeding.  He already said he wouldn't stop fracking. Bleh
Rudy Giuliani‚Äôs daughter announces her support for Biden/Harris
Everyone I know loves Bernie,  only knew a couple Biden supporters. I wish my experience was the reality
Are you kidding me right now?  That's one of the stupidest things I've read all day, and I'm in the comments of a Joe Biden tweet.
Polls last election had Hillary up by 3 or 4 points which is what she won the popular vote by. Trump is deeply unpopular even compared to then and Biden is liked much more than Hillary and is winning in states like Texas.Things can change as Biden is awful but Trump knows its bad
If Joe Biden were president we would have a united plan against the pandemic. There would be a mandated mask order. If we really want this pandemic to end wear an effing mask! The GOP needs to step aside and let the smart people lead.
Is that the best that you have Pence? Biden and Harris will take away red meat when they are elected. No wonder Trump‚Äôs rigging the election (Putin, post office, birther conspiracies).Believe me, it‚Äôs not going to happen. You are out. Becky
Vote for Biden
A FB acquaintance posted o meme with ‚Äúcreepy Joe‚Äù  touching the shoulders of a little girl in distress. The meme claimed the pic is proof of Joe‚Äôs pedophilia. I was happy to point out that the photo was taken at Beau‚Äôs internment &amp; the little girl is Biden‚Äôs grand daughter.
‚Äúclassic #GenX straddle:  She‚Äôd navigated... a system controlled by older, whiter, more-conservative politicians, and then proposed to wield... that power in the service of... the enormous, diverse, and progressive... generations coming of age behind her.
Bernie had money from actual passionate voters. Biden gets corporate pac money.  Biden didn't even campaign in some states but won off of name recognition because half the country sadly doesn't pay attention.
Biden got like 5% of the under 40 vote. AOC could reach them.  But keep licking those boots
Wow... don't even where to begin here.  According to you,  Joe Manchin and AOC are the same since they are both Dems. So I guess Kasich and Trump are both the same since they are both Republicans.  Biden got like 5% of the under 40 vote.  AOC can reach them more than anyone.
Biden struggles with young voters. AOC excels with them. Kasich and Clinton will just be preaching to the choir.  AOC could actually reach New voters.  These are facts.
I'll believe that when Biden starts screeching about conspiracies on Twitter for five hours a day.
They have nothing else other than to tweet disinformation as nothing positive ever has happened from the  administration. Trump &amp; minions  are frantically editing photos of Biden to rile up the uneducated base. They have no other amnitition. üòÇ
Maybe if you handed voted to give Trump a pass for TRYING TO LEVERAGE UKRAINE FOR DIRT ON BIDEN, we wouldn't be suffering from all these crises.  THIS IS ON GOP!  #COVID19  #USPSsabotage  #deficit
Biden picked Harris to pander to woman and people of color.  That seems like trying to rig something to me.  Look up all the states where voting by mail has left ballots uncounted.  Left or right, right or wrong it doesn‚Äôt work. NJ, NM, MO, WV, IN.
I would have loved Joe Biden to have picked Tulsi Gabbard or Nina Turner over any "Third Way" Corporate Zionist DINO like Harris!
And you think Biden will be better?  I get you stated it twice.  My issue was never about the story I‚Äôm particular.  It‚Äôs with the constant pandering to the liberal agenda.
Expect another rounds of Fox News bashing tweets from trump anytime now. New poll released today shows Biden leads nationally.
In a perfect world,  Bernie Sanders.  In a realistic world,  none of the current republican goons would be a good start.  I hate Biden too, but sadly it's the only alternative.
Except Biden doesnt let himself into the dressing rooms of nude underage pagent constestants or install camera's in the rooms of women on game shows.
Quick now do a Biden is senior story.  Or Kamala will sell anyone out to gain power.  No?  Only anti-Trump.  Wow.  I‚Äôm ashamed this is my KC radio station.    You don‚Äôt even try to hide it anymore.
Exactly! As the saying goes, as Ohio goes, so does the country or something like that. Biden is actually faring well in OH. Let‚Äôs turn it blue!
I live in Missouri. More than half of my extended family and friends voted for him. This is my plea to everyone to please, if you can‚Äôt stomach voting for Joe Biden, don‚Äôt vote.  Trump and DeJoy are already making sure people CANT vote.  This right is supposed to be guaranteed.
Biden Harris show authoritarian side. Demand nationwide mandate for mask. This is just the very beginning of dictating what they believe is right more than you. I not saying mask are bad or good. What I‚Äôm saying is Washington should not dictate anything like that to us. #pathetic
Funny how Biden and Harris are demanding a Covid vaccine. If they‚Äôre so up on how vaccines are developed they should just pull it from their ass. This does nothing but show just how f‚Äôing stupid they are. #patheticdemocrats

I'm not so sure of that. I don't believe their will be a "Beat Biden at all costs mentality" in 2024, I think ideology will still be a major player like it was in 2016.
Are Biden and Harris so hated by #Democrats that the party is pushing them out front knowing they'll lose and their "careers" will be over? Wha th is the purpose of these 2 pawns?ü§î
Isn‚Äôt Haris Alic is a peach but truth alludes Breitbart.  Biden is right. Trump does coddle terrorists &amp; thugs. Maybe someone at the Breitbart fake factory should read real news on occasion.
And Biden didn‚Äôt say not to kill Osama. The GOP screams ‚Äúfake news‚Äù because they are constantly cranking out false information to suppress elections.
Ugh...i hear you... Trump is just that bad. But Biden ain't moving anywhere but right
What has the Russian right given us higher unemployment, out of control pandemic, a recession leading to a depression and the worst division of the American people since the civil war! Biden/Harris will unite us again!
Barack did nothing to ensure that black people have equal protection(s) under the law. Biden &amp; Harris both have a long, punitive records on criminal justice, but now they‚Äôre sorry because they need the black vote? The mockery is real!
This is hilarious. You people can not be serious about Biden and Harris. You really must live in a bubble.

3) The problem isn't just that Trump needs even more undecideds to go his way this time, but when asked they lean towards Biden this time. Which is why I've been so confident that the Democrat would win for a while now.
2) 87% of RV today have already decided, compared to 76% this time in 2016 and 83% of LV right before election day. It's not just that Biden has bigger leads than Clinton, but Trump doesn't have the same number of undecideds to pull from to come back. But there's more!
the fact that my first time voting i was stuck w clinton and trump. now my second time voting in an election of this magnitude and i have to choose biden/harris or trump! come on
Dog whistles for the base to try and do something to Biden, thats my educated guess.

Someone ask Joe Biden when he will finally accept the science behind therapeutic marijuana use or if he'll continue his nearly half century of science denial
2 problems here:  1. Whining about the presidential candidate not being a member of your particular religious sect is the ultimate snowflake behavior. 2. Biden is Catholic.
don‚Äôt vote for Biden y‚Äôall they haven‚Äôt once said what they are going to do FOR the people. only what they‚Äôre going to do against the people... think on that.
So Tucker Carlson is endorsing Joe Biden?
They can't seem to decide whether Biden/Harris is radical left or corporate elite.
Biden is more Catholic than Trump is Christian.

Obama and Biden showed us all how prepared they were with H1N1!
That‚Äôs always the argument the center makes to the left. I understand Trump is awful, obviously. I just don‚Äôt think Biden is a ton better based on record. I‚Äôll vote for progressives locally and vote Green nationally until the party starts adopting policies I agree with. üññ
You can vote for Biden without celebrating him as a person! You can vote for Harris without pretending like she‚Äôs a girl boss! Let‚Äôs not force people to ignore and be quiet about their deep flaws!
Yeah, I don‚Äôt really feel inclined to ‚Äòfall in line‚Äô though when the candidate makes it pretty clear his disdain for the policies I care about. M4A, GND, marijuana legalization. None of that is happening with Biden.
So smart people are backing Biden/Harris? Thanks for pointing that out Mr. TikTok
Look at Cornyn over there campaigning for Biden/Harris!
The Dems could have also not rigged the primary to annoint Biden, but they did what they did! I hope he wins, but he‚Äôs done nothing to earn my vote

I'm pretty sure Biden will beat him to the punch. I used to call him the gaff Master general.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot .
Yeah he's all against his fellow jew Bernie Sanders,  but all in even after Biden says the most ignorant racist shit.  Still like him,  but it's disappointing.  I feel like he doesn't pay attention
For all those disappointed that Kamala (Kopmala) is the VP pick, here‚Äôs some comfort: if #BidenHarris2020 wins this Nov, she will have the most limited role in a Biden Admin. As VP she‚Äôll constitutionally only have 1 job vs a more expansive cabinet role such as Attorney General
We "Liberals‚Äù considerthe Biden- Harris Ticket and Platform far superior to what we have endured in the Administration of Trump - Pence.  A famous question from the 1979 Reagan campaign, ‚ÄúAre you better off today than you were 4-years ago‚Äù.  Obvious answer, No way!
Exactly how is the pairing of joe biden and kamala Harris good for Foundational Black Americans???
So i woke up this afternoon looked at Twitter and saw Biden has Officially picked Kamala Harris and i turned to my husband and told him, he said "so what does that mean?" I said that means we get watch them completely destroy trump and pence until November! HELL YEAH!
Actually we all lose since the best we can do is Joe biden
I doubt it Commander Tang already said Biden is disrespecting men everywhere by picking a woman running mate. But we all know how much of a hypocrite trump is so i suppose its still possible
I'm really surprised by how many people are surprised by Biden's VP pick. The minute it was clear he was going to be THE guy, it was obvious she was going to be the VP choice. And, yes, I saw ALLLLLLL of the debates. But it was still so obvious. Well, at least to me anyway. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Fuck both y‚Äôall Biden got my uncle locked up.
I still can‚Äôt believe Biden picked that lady lmao like bro what?
Like Biden. Both Soros backed puppets. You can see the strings when you see them.
Imagine actually believing Biden and Harris are ‚Äúleftists‚Äù.
Well Clinton got laid in the White House. Soooo with her past, so will Biden. But it‚Äôs never gonna happen TRUMP 2020!!
Donald Trump had to write notes on his hands to remind himself to show sympathy towards the Parkland victims. No matter what you throw at Biden, Trump has always done worse.
I really wish Biden would‚Äôve picked someone other than Kamala Harris.
Civility is a two way street btw! Implying progressives want Trump to win because they don‚Äôt like Biden is mad insulting. That kind of shit is why I tell people to fuck offü§ôüèª
Biden has also tried to cut social security many more times than Trump.
Bringing us to climate change, which Biden is slightly better than Trump in terms of mitigating. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs pass/fail, and 43% isn‚Äôt better than 16%, so the result is we all die horrifically as a result of either candidate winning. Lol, awesome!
Yeah, I‚Äôm not a Bernie stan. You can fuck off as well. Not voting for Biden. Patronizing people is a great campaign strategy. Btw, Wall St is ‚Äòthrilled‚Äô with Kamala
Yeah, Biden‚Äôs criticisms of Trump in all those examples is that he didn‚Äôt do ENOUGH. A Biden presidency would do even MORE, and since he‚Äôs a Democrat, everybody will be out to brunch by then.
I wanted  as Secretary of State but I can't wait to see her destroy  the way she destroyed Biden in debate.
Kamala Harris is the most obvious goddamn choice Biden could have made.
Half of Biden‚Äôs ads right now are about Trump being weak on China or weak on Russia. If that doesn‚Äôt terrify you then I don‚Äôt know what planet you live on.
Trump/Pence pulled off one single coup, in Bolivia, the rest has been incompetent bungling in every direction. Obama/Biden took out multiple governments, and a president Biden will take out multiple more. They‚Äôre both evil monsters but Biden can actually get these atrocities done
Yes. We are "Dreaming". Go Biden/Harris!
I am thrilled and so ready to see the healing, and restoration of competence, dignity, compassion and true leadership that they will bring to this country!  Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate, first Black woman
Not to mention Biden‚Äôs belligerent language toward Russia and China is about a hundred times more aggressive than Trump‚Äôs and is a hundred times more likely to kick off WWIII.
The difference is that Biden has a much warmer relationship w/ the CIA and Pentagon, and when he tries a coup in Venezuela and Iran, not only will it be successful, the public will overwhelmingly support it because he‚Äôs not Trump.
Biden basically built the mass incarceration system and militarized police apparatus that Trump is now taking advantage of. He‚Äôll keep doing all that stuff, just with a Democratic sheen so all the liberals will shut up about it.
Biden wants to push for war in like ten other countries and accuses Trump of being weak. He would increase deadly sanctions on poor people around the world.
True, but there‚Äôs a possibility that Biden would get even more people killed than Trump. He‚Äôs mostly attacking the president for not being hawkish enough on foreign policy. These equations are not all cut-and-dry.
Hey look, an actual policy pitch! Maybe if Biden supporters would come at us like this rather than implying we‚Äôre fascist sympathizers you could win some votes!
I noticed that the national evening New was giddy that Kamala Harris was picked to be Biden‚Äôs vp. #VPHarris

Trump said that the flu of 1917 killed anout of troops in world War 2. Stop talking about biden when its clear that trump is a total tard
We gotta choose between Biden and Harris and Trump and Pence? TF kinda options are these
This has disaster written all over it.  Kamala Harris isn't the VP Biden needs in order to get that left-wing independent vote.  Sure as fuck not getting mine.
If she had any soul she would of turned it down but if Biden is racist I guess so is she
don‚Äôt vote for Biden goofies
Also, I have yet to be contacted by the Biden team but rest assured I do have my phone on hand and am making sure its adequately charges
*biden picks kamala*  Y‚Äôall: excited  Me: I guess chile

We should acknowledge that, the fact that Biden is contemplating a running mate who is a woman of color isn‚Äôt just about this moment in time, or energizing the base, it‚Äôs about the fact that women of color have acquired the level of experience to be a credible Vice President.
BIDEN/POKEY 2020: FOR GREATER FUN!!!
We have two, and only two, possibilities: four years of a Trump unbound, not limited by the need for approval via reelection, or Biden.  I get being disappointed, I get being unhappy. I don't get sitting this out or acting like they're the same.
Yeah, I voted Clinton last time but to see the party spit in our face again is a little beyond the pale. It‚Äôd be one thing if Biden came left on any meaning policy position but he hasn‚Äôt.
The reason why I say this is that the VP nominee usually speaks the day before or during the day of the nomination acceptance speech. Warren speaks day before and Harris speaks the day Biden does.
I‚Äôve noticed a lot of fear mongering coming from supposedly Biden voters! Several have blocked me because I question their motive! I don‚Äôt mean to affend but don‚Äôt like people trying to scare with BS!
If he's not voting for Trump,  then he can complain.  Remember,  not voting for Trump is a vote for Biden
Eh, I don't think the president should have dementia. I do think anyone with dementia should have access to free healthcare though,  which is something Biden said he would veto. You should redirect your anger to the people that got us here.
Imagine making fun of anything Joe Biden has ever done after seeing this.
If you actually care about the environment you have a moral and ethical obligation to vote for Biden. Case in point ‚¨áÔ∏è
Everyone here lacks nuance. Cenk was never a cheerleader for Biden or Hillary.  He fully endorsed Bernie before anyone else on 2016. Unfortunately we have a lesser of two evils scenario. Its not like he goes on the show and says how great bidrn is for fucks sake

There are many reasons that Trump is not trying to control this virus.  I do think Biden would do better.  There will be so much voter suppression and fraud.  They changed me from an independent to a Republican on their rosters.  It was the first example.  Of course, I changed it
I will vote for Biden if he picks Satan.  I don‚Äôt care.  I‚Äôll vote for a rock before I vote for Trump.
He reads the prompters well &amp; frequently ad libs, keeping his train of thought. He has demonstrated insight, wisdom, discernment, &amp; integrity. Biden has dementia &amp; is being abused by Democrats who are trying to deceive Americans for power.  Riding a bike means nothing in regards
Doctors still can lie &amp; are only humans practicingin the medical field. If that surgeon were honest, he would admit that although nothing showed up then, it can be now. Every time the brain has to have surgical action, brain cells die. Dementia happens. Biden‚Äôs dementia is real.
Simple explanation. Plus he daily proves his mind is sharp. He eAny other belief is a lie.  Biden‚Äôs dementia is real. Any laymen can see it every time he gets behind a microphone. He is being abused, when he should be enjoying life &amp; making memories with his family while he can.
I noticed that Brian never denied Biden‚Äôs dementia. He tried to slam FN, as if they were lying.  A bike ride proves nothing about his cognitive abilities. He is being abused. He should be making good memories with his family, while he can.  Brian needs to learn about dementia.
love how joe biden is using his formal running mate as a surprise album announcemen. boy-
It‚Äôs the same here in Missouri although the state is Red our big cities are blue and there flags and signs in every neighborhood yet I haven‚Äôt one single Joe Biden sign....
This is bound to be very good.
How stupid. This guy is acting like  marriage is why NYC is a stink hole. Bet he thinks Clinton was a Saint and Lewinsky was just an intern.   This is the #Democrats base. No wonder they are in big trouble and have Biden as their candidate!
Y‚Äôall are just as senile as Biden if you think that. I would have voted for Tulsi, as would a lot of Libertarians. But y‚Äôall decided uncle Joe was the way to go? The Democrats love trump if that‚Äôs their play.

I know sane people who plan to vote Biden maybe they are sane yet deluded.

Yep, good description of Biden, too bad that will never apply to  who is at his private country club acting like he‚Äôs addressing country while millions out of work &amp; getting evicted. Completely unaffected by the pain Americans are going through.
It sounds as though you may have voted in a primary in state #1. It‚Äôs not possible that you would have already voted in the Nov election since neither Trump nor Biden have officially been nominated. You should be fine to register and vote in state #2.
Can you tell your uncle and his daughterWife(which is really creepy the way he acts around her)to just give up? Resign? Walk away? Take McConnell, Pelosi, and Biden in tow and allow The USA to right itself, kick covid19s ass, and move on from this 4 year dark age nightmare?
Don't forget energy. Trump: Biden is against energy  Fact Check: Biden lives in a house with electricity.
At traitor John Lewis funeral he turned it into Trump bashing and Biden campaigning.
There is quite a difference In leveling accusations of racism, which Dems do to Trump constantly and pointing out real racist comments. I hate to break it to you but your monoculture comment is a racist one just like Biden‚Äôs comments were.
That goes to the question of who is ‚ÄúGod‚Äù? Is the god Biden might hurt the jealous trickster one who tortures people to test their fate? Is he the punitive god that indiscriminately wipes out the good &amp; innocent with fires &amp; plagues to show displeasure? Does that god take bribes?
Biden does the same. At least he tries
Scratching my head here. It is like you didn't read either Biden's tweet or mine. You know damn well you'd never give Trump a pass, let alone the praise you're giving Biden.
Biden don‚Äôt play dumb no one likes a liar and destructive evil piece of nothing Obama obviously can be President George Bush you can come to
Biden didn't say he made a mistake or that he was wrong. He said that's not what he meant. Had Trump said the same thing media would be attacking him right now, not praising like they are with Biden.
If Biden's got that much power, then you should definitely vote for him!
I only like gods that can't be hurt by Joe Biden
Yes, but only if they take a test for cocaine first.
I will... by voting for Joe Biden! Btw everyone watch the axios hbo interview. I think everyone should watch it before November.btw, I think you did great on it Donald Trump, and yes.. that‚Äôs sarcasm
Pointing out things Biden is doing wrong isn't us helping Trump,  it is Biden helping Trump
When I read that Joe Biden might destroy a god
Look I think we can all agree that Biden has his problems, but right now he's the only hope we have if we're going to ATTACK AND DETHRONE GOD
Hilary you know Biden threw you down the steps
If Joe Biden can hurt God, he's got my vote.  If there is a God, He has a lot to answer for.
This makes Biden sound like a jrpg protagonist.   Which makes it easier to vote for him, honestly
PIERCE THE HEAVENS WITH YOUR DRILL, BIDEN-SENPAI
Naming my next JRPG character ‚ÄúJoe Biden.‚Äù
Holy Shit, Biden is bad ass.   If he has the power to hurt God, it‚Äôs best we not anger him by voting against him.
I just had a customer ask me if I was voting Biden or Trump in November. First of all, sir, this is a recorded line. Secondly, you couldn‚Äôt pay me vote for Trump.
It isn't to HURT Biden, it's to HELP Trump! That is the mindset we must use...  #KayneWest
Wow!! Not only is Biden an atheist, but some type of god himself that can hurt god and hurt the Bible. How can trump beat such a foe?Fares, please realize that if you don‚Äôt vote for Biden, you are helping trump who is an idiot and is using this country to make more money and get more power.  He has caused more damage to this country than any terrorist could possibly have done.
America loves our next President Joe Biden and Vice President Harris ..
Tucker Carlson Called ‚ÄúRacist‚Äù For Mispronouncing Kamala Harris‚Äô Name, Then Biden Does the¬†Same

I don't know who the worse liear joe Biden or Donald Trump to me they all are liear especially about the stimulus package and checks they are just teasing American people who is jobless and about to loose their homes and hungry
If Biden were President he already had a plan in place that we would be back to normal. Trump did away with the Pandemic response team! As well as sold our national Stockpile to CHINA
Joe Biden is calling for a nationwide mask mandate, citing health experts‚Äô predictions that it could save 40,000 lives over the next three months.
‚ÄòAntifa‚Äô website cited in conservative media attack on Biden is linked to ‚Äî wait for it ‚Äî Russia
And I'm sure you are upset that Biden mispronounced her name or the fact she slept with a married man to get a job but hey I'm sure you really care üôÉ
how did the trump train pass the joe biden handcar without running it over if they're on the same track?
You understand it's Biden not Harris running for president? That means Biden not Harris will be calling the shots for at least a month and if he can't debate Trump he shouldn't be anywhere near the presidency
Just because Biden and Harris might be ‚Äòbetter than‚Äô 45 doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt suck.  It also doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt contribute to systems of oppression. We‚Äôre still gonna be fighting the good fight with them in office
Me every time I see a tweet about Joe Biden
TRUMP TRAIN vs Biden 2020 üòÜ
I can't believe that a woman of color such as Gray Beaver was passed over as vice president by the prospective Biden administration.  Well, there is always 'inclusivity czar' as a consolation prize.

My follower base is solely from weather so there‚Äôs no political bias. People from all around the country. 325 votes is a decent sample size. Biden got demolished by the silent majority in my poll.
She is also trader to the house of representatives and she leaking out government information to Joe Biden which he has no right to so kamala harris needs to be impeached from white house and fired and charged with torsion and being a trader to her own country
Oh great the moron that got a whopping 3% is going to lead the way for Biden üòÇ
Yeah democrat senator Harris is disrespectful and unfair and nasty to both sides including to house of representatives and our government thinking that you could put $2,000.00 monthly to every single American people
Oof man Dems you really picked a winner with Biden üòÇ and then some genius thought it be great to add Harris who barely polled at 3 percent
So me calling out Trump is me endorsing Biden?

Joe Biden was just as surprised by the VP pick as everybody else. #HidinBiden
WOW! Trump Biden-Harris Video Gets Millions of Views in First Hour! (VIDEO)
So for everyone who voted in the Democratic primaries to make sure Harris would NOT be President, how do you feel now that she will be the President (if "Biden" were to win)- totally ignoring the wishes of the American people?
Biden is Catholic...
Biden and Harris
Imagine thinking Kamala Harris is a radical left wing politician. We all knew they were going to paint anyone Biden picked as a radical, so he should‚Äôve chosen someone who would appeal more to the far left part of the party. Kamala has some strengths but that‚Äôs not one of them
A great team, Biden-Harris! I'm excited at the VP he chose. Now let's go win this thing! #ambitiouswomen #BidenHarris2020

Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate on Tuesday, making history by selecting the first Black woman to compete on a major party‚Äôs presidential ticket.
Biden picked a winner lol
Joe Biden has chosen California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate.
OFFICIAL: Trump/Pence &amp; Biden/Harris
Or they could follow the Biden cult-like ‚Äúexpert‚Äù liberal doctors into believing blaming Trump then running and hiding is an answer for everything ...or they could simply study the facts, a strategy texas niner and those like her are not accustomed
We are awaiting the formal announcement:
#VPPick should be Val Demings, if Biden is serious.
After his remark that Biden picking a woman for veep would be an insult to men, I‚Äôm totally ticked off.

Hunter Biden‚Äôs $450,000 Tax Debt Mysteriously ‚ÄòResolved‚Äô Despite His Having No Discernible¬†Income
The tax cut did not help the middle class who contributes  the most to this country by buying the most of the country‚Äôs products, so they create most of the jobs. Biden will look out for the middle class.
If Biden wins it will flip in 2022.
I can't wait for President Joe Biden to open an investigation into the traitors of the GOP the American ppl deserve justice
I just thought of something by them democrats leaking government information out to joe Biden that makes those democrats and lady speaker of the house guilty of being a trader of their own country that is against federal law
Lots of liberals on here, despite that Trump still gets 3x the likes as Biden and has 10x more followers
Yeah I think so also. Driving around town I‚Äôve seen 1 biden sign compared to probably 1,000 trump signs. Granted my town is 3/4 conservative but still.
Text TRUMP to 88022!  I stand with  #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver
Landslide of red is coming. Once the first debate happens biden will tank in the polls. Trump has already started catching up after being way down last month. Also most everyone I know supports trump. Never seen anyone with a biden sign or shirt
For some reason today was the day I decided to call all my family out on the fake news they‚Äôre sharing.  I had to explain to my grandparents the reasoning behind BLM and called my uncle out for sharing a fake Biden quote  Also I got a wicked sunburn   So it‚Äôs been one
Joe Biden is worthy of every vote in American .Trump has got to go! We don't want the incompetence that we have seen the past 4 years .We can't afford the extravagant lifestyle that this family lives off the taxpayers. Bunch of grifters
Yes we know the GOP ideology is Fascism! That is why you will lose. , we don't want a Fascist government! Trump was a criminal way before the GOP allowed Putin to install him!  Joe Biden will be the next potus and dems will be majority in Congess both houses
BIG-TECH ELECTION INTERFERENCE: Facebook bans pro-Trump super PAC from advertising on its platform as they promote pro-Biden¬†ads
Biden‚Äôs quote on Black Americans was taken wildly out of context.  Should he have said it?  Probably not, but in terms of voting Biden is absolutely correct.  You see more diverse voting habits in the Latino community than in the black community.  Again though shouldn‚Äôt have said
‚ÄúYou will know them by their fruit.‚Äù Aside from Biden‚Äôs powerful defense of a genuine faith, the man‚Äôs literacy is just so dang refreshing.
I‚Äôm not voting for Biden because he‚Äôs clearly got dimentia  Also you:  Just admit you you were going to vote for Trump no matter who was send out from the left because this is the type of person you are
This guy is gonna dig deep to find dirt on Biden then respond to me; ever notice how you don‚Äôt have to look too far for 45 mishaps/scandals
No your reasoning for not liking Biden is that he‚Äôs incoherent; why does that not apply to our current ‚ÄúPresident‚Äù
President of the United States said he "Had a very beautiful life before all of this." "But that's okay." says he doesn't want to watch Biden win from some beautiful resort somewhere in the world....All the old men 77 years of age like Biden like watching me shower as they did when I was 10 years old. They call themselves as superior doing that to me since I was little. Sex abuse is a routine &amp; they will give some excuse of helping some poor children do online learning etc
I honestly do not care about Democrats anymore at all. Want nothing to do with them now I know they are my deadliest enemies always have been and the only ones who hate me so much for whatever reason &amp; this time they have attacked whole world to win the election for Biden, Kamala
This time whole world is suffering for the whim of this Kamala woman who is Biden's pet &amp; the pet of all those who hate Trump &amp; those like myself who supported him.
My step sister also called Kamala but is 70 years old really has always been about me &amp; women like her having an old man with a younger woman but it can't be anyone who protects me or likes me it has to be Biden some old man of her choice where she gets perks &amp; I am killed off
Biden &amp; Kamala rising is very bad omen for me &amp; it seems for Trump too so we have to work on getting them off our backs. Someone changed the color of my pc background to pink &amp; I hate it. I did not do that, so someone else is controlling my pc which I bought with my money. Bad.
I also got this runny nose &amp; nose block going on for almost a month now started since January, they are not letting us breathe - mostly on the right nose. It has gotten worse after June 2020 when Biden polls rose &amp; Trump is getting lower rating. Everything is worst this week.

Where was Biden on the  campaign trail today?
How would Biden handle a civil war?
People forget, communist manifesto teaches to undermine the American people.Everything Biden is suggesting is exactly what Hitler ordered
It's Biden and Kamala who are getting highs in polls while people are all dying all over the world not just in USA
Fake of day is seniors going for Biden Euthanasia top of list.Cutting social security and Medicare is insult to seniors.
Whether we are lying or not I don't feel a cringe when I look at our faces in the mirror or at the faces of those like Trump but I cringe when I look at Biden or Kamala - its some radar that makes me stop looking at them. They must be very evil as I have an intuition - built in.
Try to build Biden as clone of clinton is disgusting.
You see what the Democrats do? They dirty every beautiful clean valuable thing on the planet to waste it away, they do it to people too, they destroy good folks - the prostitutes and liberal demoncrazies like Biden &amp; Kamala &amp; the rest of the trash.
Internal Documents Circulated To DNC Delegates Hint At Why Biden Picked Harris  via   Trump is correct, as Biden and now I know it was only Biden &amp; Kamala who brought fish market folks from  Indian slums to US to replace educated upper class Indians
Because it has attacked the great booming economy &amp; is now calling Trump a liar and Biden a catholic is winning &amp; they are citing sex abuse etc. I see a repeat of the same broken record player &amp; I know they are defrauding &amp; cheating &amp; pretending their religion is great &amp; its not.
Me being old is not a big issue. As that Kamala - my step sister is 8 years older than me really and Biden is 77 years old - Nancy Pelosi has no teeth &amp; she is swaying her hips sitting in her chair like a dancing girl. They are the ones pretending to be universal but are they?
It is you who lied &amp; still lie. You are pitiful. Trump did not lie. You will suffer terrible consequences for attacking so many decent good honest people because of one woman's hatred for her step sister. Kamala's hatred. Poor woman. I forgive her &amp; hope God forgives her &amp; Biden.
They hate us so much &amp; we never hurt them in anyway except we are not prostitutes they all are. The worst prostitutes &amp; whores attacking decent folks using dirty reporters dirty Biden dirty Kamala &amp; dirty liberal democrats who throw dirt on everyone they can get trapped some way
Trump's Response When Asked If He Regrets All The Lies He's Told America: None  via   That reporter and those prostitutes &amp; Democrats &amp; Biden &amp; Kamala are the only ones lying. Trump is not lying. I am not lying. We are all the ones who are victimized.
Biden is the 'presumptive' democrat nominee not even the real one. Everything is so presumptuous &amp; presumed not real. Whole thing is a fraud.
Never succumb to Biden hit the rascal directly on his face &amp; break the nasty arrogant nose of Kamala. Beat them up &amp; make them eat dirt &amp; become rag dolls stomp on them throw their broken bodies in the rubbish heap where they belong with their fake evil gods they try to protect
I will never support Biden no matter what he does. As he is the real liar not me or Trump.
I am sick of the Democrats, sick of Biden, sick of Kamala, sick of these type of reporters S.V. Date - like having a Date going on a Date &amp; so on that is what they are saying - that I am looking for a Date with some man or woman as they change my gender &amp; say any lies to push it
I told my mother about this by phone right after which Nancy Pelosi got very angry with all the Democrats joining to put the impeachment trial that Trump had asked Ukraine for proof about Biden doing some cover up there for his son Hunter. So it is still the same issue going on
They are pushing the same deal over again now - Biden and Kamala - that I am immoral &amp; that I had amorous relationships with younger men, that I had baby with a CIO of Citibank Shankar Iyer. She put a baby carriage in my basement &amp; said it was proof of my adultery &amp; immorality
Jilly? Dougie? Aww, how folksy. C'mon man. Give me a break. Joe Biden and Kamala going to eat Trumps lunch? Nope. Not even close
Biden take credit yet?
Yes FORMER VP BIDEN/HARRIS keep making TRUMP &amp; his ADMINISTRATION look at how leadership sure B! TRUMP is frightened that U &amp; Kamal is WINNING &amp; his job now &amp; always been CHIEF OF DEFLECTOR &amp; CHIEF OF PROMOTING RACISM/DIVIDER! IT HAS BEEN EMBARRASSING 2 HAVE TRUMP AS PRESIDENT!
yes, I ‚ù§Ô∏è it, yes young people for BIDEN/HARRIS your vote is truly NEEDED!üëçüèæ‚ù§Ô∏èüíØ
If this was a Biden flag, could you imagine the uproar? As civil servants, you should be doing something about this instead of allowing is to continue. It‚Äôs disgusting, but somehow not surprising,  Are there no adults left in this state?
So they get rid of honest folks and those with good intelligence &amp; worth - so everyone is either stupid or corrupt - Biden and Kamala - types. That is their goal to form what they call the Mafia mob team that will then allocate jobs study monies everything according to favoritism
They reduce our ability to breathe they reduce supply of oxygen - they use viruses - anything to make those who usually excel in anything they do to lose that ability so that  incompetents  like Biden and corruption criminal actions of dishonest women like Kamala can win
Terrorism, bio terrorism, dark web crimes - list goes on for money making deals by defrauding good folks like me. Lying cheating making us look stupid, doing bad customer service by taking our money delivering bad products - this is Kamala's signature &amp; Biden's policy. Bastards
5 Takeaways From Kamala Harris‚Äôs First Full Day on the Biden Ticket   I want this woman to do her best to prosecute POTUS. I really want to see her do it as I know its all hocus pocus lies fraud. I have just seen my  account hacked
If you have an account with experian, its been hacked to reduce credit scores, steal our information already. That is what dark web does. That is what Kamala Harris slut and Biden bastard do and why they come to power.
Was Biden pick just joke on black community
Oh and they can dirty us, we should not be clean somehow. I want them to be dirtied all sorts of filth heaped on their heads starting with Kamala Harris and Biden. Just dump them in a sewer.
Their killings bombings thieving harassing is all OK but ANYTHING WE DO is all wrong &amp; should be punished, any education we have or work we do is worthless - its a huge hoax &amp; its Kamala Harris and Biden &amp; Democrats who must be prosecuted as enemies of entire US, UK, Europe
If you don't want dark web stealing all that is yours &amp; selling  deadly illegal drugs, stolen fraudulent identification documents access devices, counterfeit goods, malware   computer hacking tools, firearms, toxic chemicals throughout the world, do not vote for Biden &amp; Kamala.
So you see why technology industry &amp; so many rich folk are supporting Biden &amp; Democrats &amp; Kamala Harris &amp; why everyone is against those like Trump &amp; they make up all these excuses - about attacking some women or calling somebody names or being racist or stupid not smart on virus
They were doing the interrogation on public tv about Russian collusion. These dirty rich who make lot of money by corrupt means such as selling stolen personal info are the ones funding Kamala Harris &amp; Biden - who are no good &amp; will help criminals steal from good folks everything
'Antifa' website cited in conservative media attack on Biden is linked to ‚Äî wait for it ‚Äî Russia  via   Since June Antifa is back? That is when I could no longer work on my Math questions at  &amp; Biden got ahead in polls too.
We don't need them around us &amp; we take strong objection &amp; want to be safe from the smears of dirty politicians like Biden and Kamala and their shack dwelling blacks and filthy rich conscienceless pieces of scum who are always throwing dirt on us good folks.
Democrats have killed off a lot of people using coronavirus and shut off so many so people like Kamala and Biden can be leaders - the last dregs of society from the shacks &amp; the filthy bad corrupt rich vs honest folks &amp; we need to be protected from their evil effects in our lives
Democrats &amp; Anfifa &amp; Biden and Kamala and those supporting them are sending them after me. I don't want these people near me or around me or associating with me. I am not a democrat so I am not obliged to have to be accompanied by blacks who I consider dangerous &amp; corrupt.
How can we stay safe from their manipulations from wicked Democrats like Biden and Kamala and Obama?
How can we republicans stay away from the blacks like Kamala &amp; Democrats like Biden stalking us &amp; ruining our lives?
I hate filthy rich dirty shack women who got rich by smearing themselves or others ruining good families honest police folks or throwing dirt on good ladies like myself. I want nothing to do with shack women or blacks or Biden or Democrats. They must stop following me around.
Its the psychological terror I have been having to fight off &amp; its getting bad to worse only especially after this Kamala &amp; Biden ticket. Never happened before today, its new form of psychological torture.
This is not a graffiti, Biden is flat lying.   Guess he‚Äôs teaching Kamala the way he operates.

ACAB but vote for joe biden :T
The selection by Joe Biden of Kamala Harris excited the Democratic party and the nation. The announcement changed the news cycle from suffering, death, and Donald Trump to hope! It also shows the Trump campaign as lack luster  reduced to attacks and blame defending a poor record.
I‚Äôm sorry I gaslight you‚Äôre it wasn‚Äôt right, but I also have family that‚Äôs been Directly affected by policies that‚Äôs politicians like Biden create.  I got family members that‚Äôs never coming home because of the war on drugs and the 1994 crime bill

I wanted  as Secretary of State but I can't wait to see her destroy  the way she destroyed Biden in debate.
Why cant Joe Biden meet in the middle and pick a more conservative leaning VP? Now the democrats are just running one huge marxist ticket. SMHüòæ
Since it no longer matters what a person thinks - only how they look - in all actuality, she‚Äôs more brown than black. And in fairness to Biden, he never expounded upon what color...

What a great Tuesday special we got the next President Biden and vice President Kamala Harris! I cannot wait to vote! #VoteNow #DemocraticMovement
Because everyone said Hillary wore a manly pant suit so she is no lady so Biden should pick Hillary Clinton as she is not a dainty lady &amp; she is not a black lady so I am ok with that.
I think Biden should pick Hillary Clinton for vice president.
Trump Suggests 'Men Are Insulted' by Biden Committing to Pick Female as His VP   And Biden is helping black women attack the rest of us nice ladies even killing us off.

Biden and his black women sex partners top one being Kamala Harris.
We have two, and only two, possibilities: four years of a Trump unbound, not limited by the need for approval via reelection, or Biden.  I get being disappointed, I get being unhappy. I don't get sitting this out or acting like they're the same.

The Wallets of Wall Street Are With Joe Biden, if Not the Hearts   I won't be voting for Biden or his ever growing list of black equally heartless women who however say its all about fighting against racism &amp; being money minded &amp; completely heartless &amp; rich
The Wallets of Wall Street Are With Joe Biden, if Not the Hearts   A heartless money machine = Biden. We have found who he really is &amp; what he stands for &amp; how he is able to beat even the most caring kind honest persons dead &amp; have fake election wins.
Not a‚Äùsell out‚Äù but someone who realizes that every 4 years the Democrats come knocking and after the elections don‚Äôt deliver. Trump is a no-nonsense guy who is trying to deliver. Biden has been there 47 years and now he‚Äôs going to get things done!
Chris Wallace says President Trump attacked  faith? Faith without corresponding action is dead like Biden's policy!  rightly brought attention to Joe's lack of performance on his stated faith. Joe says he is a "practicing" member of the Catholic Church, not true!
Biden, I know that all LIVES MATTER, but I DO BELIEVE that BLACK LIVES MATTER because racism &amp; reforming policing r ways 2 show changes n USA! It‚Äôs problematic that Trump has continued 2 promote racism on many levels! He wasn‚Äôt the 1 who create racism but he‚Äôs Chief Promoter

Actually telling us about a guy who actually a record of going to church every Sunday. From a guy who hardly ever set a foot in church. I am sure Biden will win that debate any day of the week.
Whoever wrote this tweet for Joe. We don't believe you. He has a long history of statements about minorities. My Father told me years ago... "When someone tells you who they are, BELIEVE THEM" He's a racist, he tells us all the time.  We believe him. Bye bye hiden Biden
The President is right, Biden has failed to honor oaths made to God, the Catholic Church, and to the Nation in trust with God, he does attempt to "hurt" God by persecuting those who believe in Him, and by refusal to adopt policies which agree with life, and "you know the thing".
President Trump supports policies that are in agreement with America's Constitutional trust in God, Biden never has.  Biden is not a man of "deep faith" nor even in alignment with the policies of the Catholic Church, let alone the Bible.   Biden lives this one verse, Romans 1:21!
Thanks for the update, Jim! We the people who voted for him, like it! He doesn't take a salary from us taxpayers, and then break his oaths and promises, like Biden does.
I just had a customer ask me if I was voting Biden or Trump in November. First of all, sir, this is a recorded line. Secondly, you couldn‚Äôt pay me vote for Trump.Jennifer Epstein on Twitter: "Crowd awaiting Biden and Harris outside the school where they‚Äôll be speaking soon.  / Twitter
For those in this thread calling Trump a racist - wake up.  Those same people think that Biden ISN‚ÄôT a racist...which is laughable.
And Bernie has made it clear that he's with Biden. This country is not in support of Socialism. So you would rather get none of what you want to make your point. Okay. The people struggling don't have the luxury to get none of what they need.
Or president biden and vp harris
Hey all you Biden Harris donors: Thank you. I pledge to crawl naked over broken glass, dodging sniper fire, with a ventilator strapped to my back. I will stand for twenty hours wearing depends in the rain to pull that lever for the Biden Harris ticket!
I was just thinking this today. You‚Äôre either with Biden or you‚Äôre for the orange buffoon, no in between ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
It‚Äôs probably already done.  Unless Biden wants to grow some balls and fight back, he will lose.
How long Biden is going to get a free pass by running his campaign from the confines of his basement?  When is he going to actually do some TV interviews where he can get questions about how he would run the country and respond in kind? Aren't we as Americans entitled to know?

#BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica HAPPY DAYS ARE HERE AGAIN                                                            BIDEN/HARRIS WILL SAVE THE AMERICANS                                         THANK YOU GOD FOR LISTENING
All due to you DJT and the TRUMP VIRUS!  He will outlast you the Impeached President aka ‚ÄúOne &amp; Done‚Äù                #Biden/Harris2020
Both Biden and Harris are throw away candidates. Kinda like Dukakis and whoever his VP pick was.
Not watching. Sure he's just phoning it in to try to steal Biden's thunder.
Great selection!! Biden/Harris Finally hope for our country!!!!!!!
I took it as a signal to US- that she is going to be a true partner, a respected partner, a valued partner and what she has to say really matters to him. Frankly, I am ecstatic to hear it from Biden.
What time is the biden kamala event
Democrats are so radical they will use a Dementia riddled Joe Biden as a RUSE to get Kamala Harris as Presiddnt!  Another ‚ÄúBlack‚Äù person with far leftist values and no Business experience!  It will be an Obama Criminal Administration on STEROIDS! TRUMP 2020!
Biden‚Äôs lead expanded in Florida, Michigan, and PA from their last poll.
Going from a 10 to 6 point lead, while swing states expand leads makes no sense.  Biden wasn‚Äôt up 2 in PA up 10 nationally, now up 4 after being up 6 nationally. Numbers don‚Äôt work like that üòÇ
Biden‚Äôs lead shrunk in their national poll and expanded in states lol. This poll is all over the place.
Come on man!
How do they sell her as a crazed liberal while highlighing how unhappy the crazed liberals are with a Biden-Harris ticket? Is there something I am just not getting?
Illhan Omar looks set to win her primary. Now progressives shift their eyes over to Delaware and Florida. Delaware carries a significant symbolism. Since getting a M4A advocate into Biden‚Äôs old seat given his opposition to it sends a message.
I‚Äôm sorry who gives a shit about Biden and that donkey Harris.  I‚Äôm pissed beyond words the coward liberals that run Athletics in the Big Ten and PAC 12   You gutless worms don‚Äôt tell me the danger when these men bang together with such force they destroy their bodies.  Cowards
Tell me your opinion on Biden‚Äôs VP pick.
Now watch the polls.  Biden made the right choice but the independents afraid of a black woman President will run back to Trump.
Yes, this!  Biden is strong enough to have someone disagree with him.
She also does not fully support many progressive policies or is only partly for them. This means that even though she is a great pick there is so much more work to be done in the campaign as well as if/when Biden/Harris is in office. Don‚Äôt act like this is over...
Get on board, dude. It's Biden/Harris or four more years of Trump.
No. But Biden yes. He trusts science and is not on Putin‚Äôs payroll.
Yay! Biden/Harris all the way.
for today's momentous news of biden picking kamala as VP nominee
Way to go VP Bidenüòä. You and Kamala are a winning teamüíô.#BidenVP
Tomorrow Biden will probably give an interview promising that his VP pick announcement is ‚Äúright around the corner.‚Äù
Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate #SmartNews ..... Another Skank Democrat that slept her way to the top and she is NOT BLACK!
It‚Äôs weird to think that the Democratic Party has chosen such a clearly presumptative one-term candidate for POTUS.  Even should Biden win, 2024 will be more analogous to 2016 than 2020.
Biden's hideous plan to make family life in suburbs unbearably miserable
Do you see who is burning our cities?  Biden is a man of faith?  He has funneled money to every member of his family.  His priest denies him communion.  You hate Trump because he did what you could never do.  Your career is over, like Romney, Bush, Clinton.  Congrats!
But Biden is falling apart??
Average male life expectancy in the US is like 77. It‚Äôs not unreasonable to think something could happen to Trump or Biden at their age.
Biden needs to respond to Trump attacking his faith.  Lincoln Project, I‚Äôm sure there are clips.  Do your thing!
The Truth about Biden and his mix/matched dissolving Party!
I will vote for Biden if he picks Whitmer or Warren. I prefer other candidates. But that's okay. It's not my pick to make
Trump has been consistent at 45-46% across every poll recently in the state. Only one showing Biden below 48% since YouGov.
Het,   Biden OWNS that house. Americans OWN the White House. What a grifter you turned out to be.
Oh, and Biden went to church yesterday. The same church he always attends when he is in town.
Joe Biden Says You Need More Than The 2nd Amendment To Fight A Tyrannica...  via    thank you for sharing your vast knowledge with us the American people!
All you can do is make sure you vote, educate those in your in your sphere of influence about the dangers of this president as well as the positive impacts on our country of a Biden presidency, and encourage those people to vote as well.
Those of us supporting Biden will be grabbing the Tums during the debates.  It‚Äôs not like he speaks with clarity.
Wall Street Journal New York Post Fox News all owned by 1 family constant feed back loop support Trump/denigrate Biden. Limbaugh. NYTimes always frames stories as if Biden a devil. The media, CNN too gives  free airtime to Trump. Remember they all said Clinton was near death too
I‚Äôm just not buying it.  How is Biden reaching out to Trump supporters who are wavering.  How is their ground game mobilizing people.  There just isn‚Äôt any enthusiasm for Joe.  That‚Äôs a major concern.
Couldn‚Äôt hope for anything more.  But everything in me feels that Trump will steal it along with Biden blowing it.    The polls are already too close for comfort.
Well, I missed this whole damn thing....I wonder if they saw Biden out riding a bike today, trolling the Fox reporter? Looked fit and trim and healthy.
Anyone else think these comparisons between the physical capabilities of Biden and Trump are super gross? I‚Äôm voting for Biden bc he will be a competent leader, not bc he can walk a ramp or ride a bike. Just stop with the pissing contests.
Biden rides a bike while tRump rides a golf cart with his caddy riding the bumper.
HA! America is LAUGHING At Biden After One Look At How Many People Tuned in to Hear His Master Plan | Red State of Mind Daily
Exactly....beating trump is about Biden‚Äôs views and he‚Äôs smart enough not to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna take your guns!!‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna abolish all police!!‚Äù or ‚ÄúTime for a huge tax hike!!‚Äù
Can you please explain ‚Äúthis‚Äù leftist take on America?   What are the top 2 or 3 that you feel will get Trump re-elected and how is Biden‚Äôs position on it too extreme to vote against Trump?
He was asked if his campaign could damage Biden‚Äôs chances. Which is how all campaigns function, you lower your opponents chances by getting votes till you win. They literally picked the bottom of the barrel of criticisms to lodge at Kayne
Trump will defend God from Biden?

Well,  is basing all their coverage of Biden as the gaffe machine as if it is the only thing we should consider. Yes. I am serious. They must take the call from the GOP Operatives and frame their stories about Biden every damn day that way. It. Is. Ridiculous.
Of course. Make the whole campaign about Biden gaffes. Like that's the most important thing. Do you all realize how ridiculous your political coverage is? Is straight out of the GOP headquarters. I wish in my heart you could do better. I canceled my subscription after 27 years.
I am 100% certain that Joe Biden is more religious than Donald Trump
