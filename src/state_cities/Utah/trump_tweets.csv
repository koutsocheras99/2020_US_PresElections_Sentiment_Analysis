Biden is definitely not that candidate. There's a huge chunk of people turned off by Biden's history. Those people will either go grudgingly to Trump or not vote. That's who Jorgensen wins. This election is too important to split the vote with Biden. Maybe he can run in 2028.
Biden didn't write it, but he claims credit for it and he laid the groundwork.   And Trump signed its renewal this year. They're both awful candidates.

It's been all over the news and Facebook. Trump needs to stop trying to be a martyr and just have good policies instead.   is the only candidate worth a vote this year. #EndTheATF #LetHerSpeak
Here's the full context:   Trump doesn't care about the 2nd or 4th amendments. He's an awful candidate just like Biden.
We need to stop voting for bad candidates, not continue like an addict saying they can stop whenever they want but they just need a hit to get through work.  Stop voting for bad candidates. Is Biden a bad candidate? Yes he is, so don't vote for him. Same with Trump.
It will never be "the year". We're going to continue on the death spiral until we start voting 3rd party en masse. If Biden gets elected we'll see Trump 2.0 in 2024 &amp; it won't be the year. If Trump wins we'll have Mega Biden to "fix" 8 years of tantrums &amp; it won't be the year.
What is there to debate anyway? Trump has already been impeached once and is currently killing 1,000+ Americans per day through his own gross incompetence and delusion.

Yes it is. Dr. Jorgensen is on the ballot and you're free to vote for her.  We'll never have real change without changing how we vote. Biden and Trump have shown their true colors, and millions of Americans don't want either. This election is too important to vote for them.
Biden &amp; Trump are terrible candidates. I'm voting for  She won't try to "put our country back together": how it was before Trump is the reason we got him. She would make real change for real people, chiefly by restoring the fed. govt to its constitutional limits.

Biden is an authoritarian who doesn't respect the Constitution &amp; its limits on the federal govt. He's an awful candidate. I don't agree with or trust him.  Dr. Jorgensen has great ideas &amp; no muddy past. Getting the LP to 5% will be a greater victory than electing Biden or Trump.

Feb. to March is about a month, I was just going off your claims. It's great if Trump managed to not bumble this one thing, but it's beside the original point. He's not a good person or a good President.
Will Trump 2.0 in 4-8 years also require you to vote for a bad candidate?
Regardless, Trump is an awful candidate for many reasons. His constant lying is at the top of my list, but the list is long.  Don't vote for a bad candidate out of fear of a bad candidate being elected. That's nonsense.
Trump is a symptom, not the disease. The cure is to buck the 2 party death spiral. You're going to keep seeing worse and worse candidates every election. When will the weather be fair enough to vote for an umbrella?
Are you not in favor of limited government? Under Dr. Jorgensen, the FDA would have very little power over vaccine research or anything else so American companies would've gotten started on a cure months ago instead of having to wait for Trump to believe the virus was real.
She's not even included in most polls, or they misname her as "other". That's the problem we're fighting  If we reelect Trump, we'll just face Biden 2.0 in 2024. This election is too important for either of them to be running. Vote for real change to end America's death spiral.
There's loads of time. #LetHerSpeak in the debates and millions of people will know who she is and appreciate her policies.  But if she can't win, she can get us to 5% of the vote to secure FEC funding for the Libertarian Party. That's a greater victory than electing Trump/Biden.
No, she'll also take votes away from Trump. And get the Libertarian Party to 5% of the vote so we can finally get FEC funding and a more level playing field next election.  Why are your tax dollars being used to prop up just 2 political parties? Does that not concern you?
This election is too important for Trump and Biden to be running. Maybe they can try again in 2028 after we scale back the federal government so much that it doesn't matter who the President is.
That's not how math works. Trump voters got us Trump, and nobody else.  Duverger's Law is self-perpetuating. Stop voting for bad candidates and we'll stop having bad candidates.

Even if you live in a swing state, your vote can count toward the 5% needed to get the Libertarian Party federal funding. If we elect Biden this year we'll get Trump 2.0 in 4-8 years unless we have a healthy 3rd party to fight for us.  Let's all stop voting for bad candidates.

Nah. We only "don't have a chance" because defeatists and shills keep saying so and don't report on our candidates or include them in polls. I'm going to use my little vote to move the Libertarian Party closer to 5%, a far greater victory than electing Trump or Biden. #VoteGold
No. Duverger's Law is a self-perpetuating historical observation, not a rule. If enough people vote for a candidate she will win.  But even if she doesn't, getting the Libertarian Party to 5% so we can have a level playing field is more of a victory than electing Biden or Trump.
POTUS Trump has got to lose the election so overwhelmingly, there can not be even a tiny bit of doubt of the outcome or things will get ugly.  #WeWillVote
By law Election Day is statutorily set as "the Tuesday next after the first Monday in the month of November" equalling "the first Tuesday after November 1‚Äù.  Trump CANNOT move or delay the election.The most corrupt politicians and it shows - high unemployment, crime etc and when Trump brings order, they complain.  You believe lies, that‚Äôs it.
I would vote for no president if it meant that I would vote be voting against Donald Trump.  I wanted otherwise but fuck...I‚Äôll vote for Joe if I have to.  He‚Äôs not a bad dude...even if I don‚Äôt agree with his politics.  I‚Äôll criticise him like hell still.
You‚Äôve been brainwashed.  Trump not Obama accomplished prison reform.  Many more people were on food stamps during the Obama years because he taxed businesses because they are somehow evil.  Trump knows that most people want to be self-sufficient so he decreased taxes so they‚Äôll
This is the epitome of the problem with our country right now. Even when trump does something the left all wants, they are mad at him. Even if they want it it can‚Äôt be a good thing if trump does it. He should encourage riots and protesters and then everybody would stop them.
You just won‚Äôt face it.  I‚Äôm being totally objective regarding Biden.  Trump is Trump.  He‚Äôs just like when he was elected and he has tremendous stamina compared to Biden, it is obvious to an outside observer.  You are too much of a partisan to admit it to me.
That‚Äôs awesome! Trump 2020

Lol. You actually went there even bigot trump is president.
Good Time To Revisit Rep Cummings Scathing Letter Documenting Trump's Abuses In Office (Its almost like he knew there would come a time when Trump's unchallenged claim of Pres. Priv. would extend to FOIA requests for info re: his numerous leases w/gov).
Come on, President Trump is fine regarding his cognitive skills.  Why do you refuse to acknowledge Biden‚Äôs cognitive decline?  Track how many times he says ‚Äúanyway‚Äù and get back to me.
What about the fact that Trump said "Thighland" and "Thailand" within five seconds of each other?
I asked a sincere question.  Trump goes off, always has, but his cognitive abilities are fine.  Look, I like Joe, he‚Äôs been through a lot in his life.  He is displaying a pattern I have noticed in a good friend of mine with is having declining cognitive skills.
QUIT saying and even thinking Trump is just going to lose this election. Problem solved. You underestimate the stupidity and inhumanity of his base and his determination to cheat in any and all ways possible.
anyone gonna talk about how trump doesn‚Äôt even have a reelection plan? straight up he‚Äôs just like vote for me again ‚Äúmaga‚Äù like you do realize that you didn‚Äôt make America great again the first 4 years right? That‚Äôs embarrassing. Biden is out here with 40 planned out plans
New hat, i wear this hat in public proudly. Now I have two Trump hats thanks to  Trump 2020!

Hillary is literally evil and into some disgusting shit. I used to honestly think that trump being president was the worst idea. I was wrong. He has basically done everything he said he was going to do when running for office. How many times has that happened?
People just jump on a train saying that trump is racist üôÑ pls bring out factual evidence of this that isn‚Äôt from mainstream media. Btw Trump has done more for the minorities than any recent president. People refuse to see that. Before COVID, unemployment was at its lowest

At this point, Biden could choose Goofy and I'd still vote for him. We'll all be dead or be wishing we were under 4 more years of Trump.
I guess the answer lies in one's definition of "great." As far as Trump's conning of America... she was invaluable...
Let‚Äôs as trump tool Kayne that. Or better yet, his porn wife or his porn concubines.
No concrete evidence.  Number of US casualties in Afghanistan is way down.  You‚Äôre probably in greater danger in South Chicago.  And the US under Trump is finalizing the end of the war and our troops will be coming home.
I don‚Äôt use the AP as my news source.  Biden apologized to President Trump for criticizing the President‚Äôs China travel ban.
Baloney.  President Trump had the guts to hammer Syria for using chemical weapons while Obama backed down.  We have a much stronger military, Veterans are being treated right, our economy is coming back.  We are much more energy independent, our borders are more secure etc.
H1N1 was no where near as serious as Covid, not even close.  Please be objective.  President Trump did what the federal government should do, provide resources to the States and the governors were grateful.  The Democratic Governors of California and New York thanked him.
Are you trying to blame President Trump for the Covid deaths?  Good grief, please have objective arguments.  Doctor Fauci said President Trump saved thousands of lives by shutting down travel from China and Europe.
All these trump supporters: ‚Äúlet‚Äôs not shove your opinions down other people‚Äôs throats. Let‚Äôs love everyone no matter what.‚Äù .... okay prove that you do that bitch I‚Äôm waiting.
Look, Sir, you are the one who accused President Trump of lying.  And I responded with President Obama‚Äôs lies and you started throwing out more false accusations.  You are the troll.
Why? Is it because he's the great Statesman, Joe Biden, or because he's not Trump. Can't fathom the former, so it must be the latter.
Can‚Äôt seem to recall Biden saying he was against God.  My guess is Biden has read more of the Bible than Trump.

Come on Ashley you can't possibly be that taken in by these lies that you are sprouting? Como did more danger than Trump ever could have by inviting people to go out and enjoy dinners at a restaurants in New York City when trump it already put the ban in effect.
It's the complaining about how much Obama golfed, and not saying a word on how much more Trump golfs. It has nothing to do with "business", and you know Trumps not doing business.
The fact that this man is in charge of the country still boggles my mind. Cases are up because cases are up.... obviously if nobody got tested we wouldn‚Äôt know who has covid. That‚Äôs exactly what he wants. He doesn‚Äôt care who dies üôÑ send Barron to public school and vote trump out
trump thinks he's better than you. Why can he vote by mail and you cant?
You are out of touch.  President Trump lead the passage of criminal justice reform which resulted in the release of many Black Americans from prison.  By the way, it was Joe Biden‚Äôs actions as a Senator which got many of them locked up for years and years.  Check your history.

Well, if anyone knows a narcissist, it's a trump lover.
If Trump has deleted his twitter as soon as COVID hit and went into his pressers prepared, he would be around even in the polls at this point.
Well, memory recalls another lady who tried, not to diminish the reigning queen.
With respect, Alan, I know where you stand on Trump and so I also know how you are going to analyze any Trump decision in the same vein. It doesn‚Äôt make you wrong, necessarily. But it doesn‚Äôt make for much meaningful discussion.
Trump is using the Exec. Order as leverage to get Microsoft to play ball. And that might be what happens. And it would be good for us!   This is not a new thing. Or specific to the US. Or even Trump personally. So people connecting it to something other than NatSec rings holllow.
Regardless of how you feel about him Mitt, President Trump knows business and the threat China poses better than most......and certainly better than any Democrat on the current scene.  Support your party‚Äôs nominee unless you‚Äôre truly of a different stripe!

Yes we can blame trump. He could have said no mask, no entry.  Easy peasy.  Or, he could have been like other world leaders and actually showed leadership in the early months of this pandemic.  Making China the scapegoat for his lack of leadership in this, is wrong.

Just go to 2 trillion and shut them up. Let the liability for business and employees that protects everyone from unfair bias. You can do this. Trump threw millions to army, jets, equipment, and how much did space force cost?
I live in Utah a republican state. 90 percent of voting is done by mail. The US has been voting by mail since the Civil War. Trump put a task force together in 2017 to find voter fraud with mail in voting. And they found nothing. ITS NOT FUCKING CHEATING!!!!
Trump has been trying for years to invalidate this provision in the ACA, which was passed by Congress, so he could try to swoop in &amp; implement the exact same thing by Executive Order. What a worthless president.
Trump's own admin arguing to SCOTUS that the very thing his admin just announced ought to be dismantled.

Sad thing is I think Trump will win in November. I can't do another four years, I rather die, or I will have to leave this country. My mental state can't take it, I hate the man.
I noticed the second word in your header is Family. Ask Jason miller  about family. Yet you retweet him. Gross. Your first word is Faith. Something trump has none off. Never been to church. He‚Äôs the opposite of Christ. You are a sheep.
Obviously, Trump hasn‚Äôt read the Bible and thus has no favorite verses or ever memorized any. I think I had memorized Bible verses by the time I was 6 years old. Trump should have been able to answer this easily and quickly
Nearly any thinking person could debate Trump. He can‚Äôt stay on topic, can‚Äôt focus, can‚Äôt speak in logical sentences, and can‚Äôt make an argument or reply to one without praising himself. All Biden has to do is show us what a sane person looks like.
Trump and the GOP are so damn corrupt  They lie, cheat, steal and have destroyed America. But 40% of the buffoonS in this country will vote for stupidity and destruction. Wake the hell up America or we can kiss our asses goodbye.
Must be difficult for the Trump group running both the Trump and Biden campaigns.  Good news for Dems is that is how Trump got elected in the first place with Clinton's help running the 2016 Trump campaign.

and he goes ‚Äútrump was a filthy rich new yorker, rich people know other rich people‚Äù i then asked about ghislaine and trump being pals, and he gave the same excuse. he believes with his entire heart that they were just rich friends, not pedophile friends.
the other day my dad asked why i wasn‚Äôt up in arms about bill clinton being on epstein‚Äôs island, ( i didn‚Äôt even know what a president was, and also the past is past). i then asked him how he felt about trump being buddy buddy with epstein...
You know Trump thinks the secretary of interior, picks out fabric swatches &amp; ugly ass wall paper.
I don‚Äôt think nearly enough people care about the NRA, that aren‚Äôt already Trump voters anyway
Trump doesn‚Äôt give a shit about god. He‚Äôs just pandering to his delusional base
Pence is a disappointment to most Americans. He‚Äôs been Trump‚Äôs lap dog. But Pence won‚Äôt be around much longer.
This feels like we‚Äôve now made the 2A front and center Nov 3rd. Whereas before, some on the right with a conscious would finally vote Trump out, we‚Äôve just given him a shiny new talking point to distract voters from his absolute failure in everything else. The timing here...üëé

List of moderators suggested by trump very interesting! David Brody? Really he is a loser.
Actually the Democrats because they have nothing but corruption to hide. Biden is a part of that. Trump certainly did not need to take a cognitive test because he plays 4 dimensional chess. If Biden wasn‚Äôt afraid of having a cognitive test he would take one but he won‚Äôt.
Utah for historical years has done melon voting we‚Äôve had other states come and ask us and have a show them how our process works. So clearly other than Trump and his cronies everyone knows melon ballots are safe

The article on my FB feed makes it sound like Trump is personally giving the $35 Mil, not a govt grant.
TRUMP. IS. NOT. A. CONSERVATIVE.

As the Trump Virus continues to ravage the country üò∞
Hunch tells me no source will be "credible" for you. But it's widely reported. Trump has only identified "Antifa" &amp; "BLM" never once white supremicists, despite evidence. So ignorance or apathy?
Nope!

I honestly don‚Äôt know either.  I think it‚Äôs because the Jesus Lovers want to rid our country of Abortion. And Trump is paving the way for that. Oh, and they hate the gays.  I need all the help I can get so I don‚Äôt end up going to jail for knocking someone out with a 2x4üò©
Trump the Movie.
How could there be people out there like that. trump should do something to help the Dr and his family. Dr. Fauci reveals he's received death threats, daughters have been harassed resulting from his statements on COVID-19
Bad for Trump
You do know that your salary is currently paid by the American people, not the Trump campaign, right? You should act like it then, instead of posting inane crap like this. If you want to send this kind of tweet, then resign. Hatch Act much?
The President and Vice President are exempt from the Hatch Act unless they violate 18 U.S. Code ¬ß‚ÄØ610.  Now is there an ethical issue here, YES 100% but it is not unlawful.   and others should know better.  They just want to gaslight.
Besides the constitutionality, there is no evidence that lockdowns work. The idea that "there is a silver bullet, Trump just won't use it" is simplistic partisanship
First, we need to restore our country. And while we‚Äôre doing that, send the prosecutors out to find every crime Trump committed. We‚Äôll need a lot of prosecutors
I guess she didn‚Äôt know many young girls, so Trump doesn‚Äôt wish her well
I hate these Mercenaries that have been bought by Trump and William Barr
Oh I totally get that. I just look at it as who can I vote for and feel good about it. That‚Äôs not Trump or Biden.
Never said anything about Trump. Won‚Äôt be voting for him either.
We don't underestimate the stupidity of the American people, like in 2016, like supporting orange nutsack, we don't underestimate such stupidity. You sir are correct, just look how many idiots are in love with Trump. Person. woman. man. camera. Tv.
I am betting Biden will do better in the popular vote than Hillary but I think Trump will win the electoral college vote, probably by a narrower margin, but he'll probably do it.
I left the Republican Party in 2015 after Trump got the nomination. The Republican Party has abandoned their values and principles. I will be voting democrat for the first time in 2020. #LincolnVoter

Why would delaying school in Utah have any impact on the presidential election? All church leadership could come out and say to vote for Biden and Pres. Trump would still win here. This type of stuff just serves as a rallying cry for the ‚Äúother‚Äù side.
As the mother of a Marine...I agree. The hate is not just focused on one man when you act like this...but many who have made sacrifices. Disgusting &amp; disrespectful. You all are literally the very thing you claim to hate when you behave this way.
Did Trump even watch the speech?
Young people are totally immune. A doctor told me young people are totally immune, I don't know why he says "totally..." Trump doesn't know why he said that! ü§£
If trumps interview with foxnfriends should scare all Americans. Years for election results BS he's planning a dictatorship and for all you this violates my constitution rights folks because of masks this actually does violates our constitutional rights. Putin winning with trump
I'm not even a Trump supporter but if he would've just made that cocaine comment to a black reporter, he'd never hear the end of it.   Face the truth, Biden is a creep and has said plenty of racist things over his career and the last few months.
One of Facebook's official third-party fact checkers is sending fundraising emails for Trump:
Good for Nevada. I think we will be seeing you in court  Donald Trump
Keep after them. What is frightening is that if Trump and Biden are locked in a tie then Pelosi will be the next President. America will be no more

These governors and any other  leader needs to be held accountable for the mass murderers.  DeSantis, Kemp Trump and the rest of the Republican Congress that have said nothing have killed our people.   these guys are responsible for the deaths in our USA.
I watched the whole Trump HBO interview and it's true what they say that he's not like other politicians...he's worse. He lies more is more corrupt and doesn't care about the common man and doesn't really try to hide it.

Good point...Trump is signing an executive order to nullify his lawsuit that will nullify a law that he now somehow supports...  #5DChess

Maybe in a sane world. But trump has been getting away with his criminal activity for over 30 years and nothing‚Äôs been done so far.
Since  has criticized professional sports and the athletes in our country, in one form of another.. I am asking all fans of these sports to vote against #Trump this election year. #VoteOutTrump #NBA #MLB #NASCAR #NHL #NFL #ASL #WNBA #NCAA #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
Thanks for pointing out that crime has increased in our Country under  leadership. But if the President can commit crimes, I guess the people can too!  #trump has done nothing to help with crime rates in our country!  #TrumpFailedAmerica

again the so-called President wants to boost his ego, due to his narcissist nature.   When in reality most Americans are struggling due to lack of work, higher cost in products, Higher cases and deaths of #Covid19.. But #Trump will say " It is what it is" #VoteToSaveAmerica
Bernie Trammel: one more murder covered by local press (liberal press, I might add). Do they cover every killing every day? No:   Charles Wade: got covered in the very liberal Washington Post:   It‚Äôs not a conspiracy against Trump

I‚Äôm issuing an order banning Trump in 89 days!
Actually if you look at the worlds most densely populated cites, they DON‚ÄôT have as many deaths as Democrat run New York, New Jersey, etc. Sorry wrong answer. Democrats want to blame Trump for massive deaths in Democrat run states.
A good start would be to stop the guns coming in from #Indiana to Chicago and to stop the Trump administration from cutting benefits that could lift people up.  had us going in the right direction before the avoidable pandemic created chaos in America. So #STFU
Then put up a Republican. All anyone sees who represents you and your Father is Trump. Your Father would have done something about Trump. You‚Äôre just enabling him.

Listen, ya'll know I hate Trump. But if we're going to allow science to continue learning and adjusting recommendations based on new knowledge gained, Trump should be allowed to do so also. I'm glad he's fixed his message on this issue.
I thought Trump was suppose to be the one to take this evil ring dowm
doesnt care about the 157k deaths due to Covid19 in the U.S. He gave the response  "It is what it is" Basically blowing off all the deaths and impacted families. He then goes of on tyrant saying " No one has done more for Blacks then he has"  OMG Really? #Trump
When  has a meeting with the #coronavirus Task Force.  He falls asleep and doesnt hear that experts are telling him about how bad the Virus is. Then he wakes up and says great meeting. Our Government has failed the people they suppose to serve. #FireThemAll #Trump
Every time  does an interview, he is getting more incoherent.  The funny thing is only one that listens to him anymore is the Ass Kissing  especially   and  .  When #Trump loses they be pro Biden.  #Trump #FoxNews
JT... nice fake stats... he never been above 49 percent and is currently at 41%  so stop lying to the American People..  You must love FoxNews  #Trump is gone come November.  Start packing
Maybe they are listening to Trump and thinking ‚Äúhey if we don‚Äôt test there won‚Äôt be any cases and our life can go back to normal‚Äù
Democrats burnt the church. Trump didn‚Äôt.  See the difference? Legal protest ends when law enforcement declares it over. The law breakers were gassed for refusing a valid order from law enforcement.
If they're able to just not talk about politics yes. Redpillable to any extent yes. Old school blue dog Dems who even liked Reagan-usually, even if they'll only 'agree to disagree.' Progressive libs-no; even if I just say 'I don't hate Trump' it's too much for their pea brains.
Did #trump actually say in an interview that no one has done more for Black Americans then he has?  Omg really?  What all have you done?  Dont talk bad about the late #JohnLewis ... Sheesh  really doesnt have a morale compass! #VoteTrumpOut
Quoting Trump....sad.
‚ÄúI read once a day...two or three times a week‚Äù -Donald Trump on ice skates

Native San Franciscans sometimes call it that, but I doubt that's what Trump meant/referred to.
"Is it my imagination, or do anti-Trump writers have difficulty distinguishing between coherent arguments and insults?"
I wonder what kind of political favors trump negotiated for pulling out of Germany. If you think any differently you are being very very naive. #utpol #corruption #VoterFraud #FAM46
I think you misunderstood my tweet, it‚Äôs about excuses, and the article is about millions of dollars of our tax money that was given to China. Maybe Trump is too busy worrying about an election he is losing then our failing economy, our collapsing health care, and thousands dead?
Shut up Blake.  It's Jimmie choice not yours, and who knows if fans will be back in stands next year either. Way #Trump leading this country.. dont think we will!
Every time I hear  on Fox i laugh as he has his head so far up #Trump ass that he knows what Donald had for breakfast! If Hannity was on any other network he would be against Donald.  That is why I hate both #cnn and #foxnews both pro this or that! #VoteForOurLives
All of these men and women raging about child trafficking, but are still supporting trump, can fuck the fuck off

Trump sucks.
Lol trump hasn‚Äôt done much to embarrass himself and that‚Äôs not even the issue BIDEN IS A POLITICAL CRIMINAL that‚Äôs the issue here
We are inching closer and closer to school opening and I am not feeling very confident in our states approach to the whole thing by lowering the amount of tests to bring the average amount cases down to fit guidelines. That just sounds like Trump 101.
He cares about people though, and we know trump does not which makes him very dangerous

Right? If it weren‚Äôt for trump and republican governors we wouldn‚Äôt be in this mess üò°
Meanwhile, when the right gets its' panties in a wad it elects a dipshit "reality" show host president who unsurprisingly fucks everything up.
Now that Democrat run states (NY,NJ, HI, etc) are enforcing quarantines on travelers from some other US states are they ‚Äúxenophobic‚Äù for enforcing their state borders? Or it it ok for Democrats to enforce borders but not Trump?
Bad thing is that  will probably pardon the guy. Since is a #trump supporter... Totally disgusting behavior for any human being.
For sure, I don‚Äôt know why the trump has not had charges for this!!!
I love this! I wish every Governor right now was telling Trump where to go!! If local leader‚Äôs would step up and fight for their citizens instead of being concerned about being a republican we wouldn‚Äôt have a pandemic!!!! üò°üò°üò°
Coverage of Trump's retweet completely missed the mark! Why?  His focus was on the obvious efficacy of #hcq #Zinc &amp; azythromycin.   Check #ZelenkoProtocol and get educated so you won't let people like  misrepresent a true game changer in the war against #covid
likely the most lies in one article, good job on trying to make Trump look racist.  Look at your own party. #youretheidiot

Donald Trump is desperate. Desperate people do desperate things. Forwarned is forarmed. Suit up, America, and MARCH!
President Trump - a failure?  Get off CNN . . .
USA will only turn into Egypt if we become a Socialist/Communist country or a semblance thereof.  President Trump is the path away from that crap. If you cannot see that, then you are looking in one place not all.

Unmasking of Trump campaign leaders and leaking the contents of the wiretapped conversations to the media. That's a felony.
Bahahahahahaha. Trump???  Speaking the truth???  Has that ever happened??
One family after the next makes clear the current President is unwelcome at the funeral for their loved one:   I think their reason is attributable, in general, to Trump‚Äôs same character trait in choosing to go to a movie, rather than to the hospital as his own brother was dying.
First:   families of departed people don‚Äôt let Trump come to funerals, let alone speak  Second: I can see that Trump‚Äôs victim-mentality is what appeals to you, but most of us already get far too much of it from him, for any more victim-mentality here on Twitter to have any appeal
Trump likes to say he‚Äôs different from previous 44 Presidents:  aside from being the only Pres to never reach 50% popularity, while other Presidents are welcome at funerals, asked to speak, and get standing ovations, he‚Äôs the only one, whom one family after the next, have barred.
Raping the US Treasury for personal gain is certainly something I don‚Äôt think anybody else could have done. And Trump couldn‚Äôt have done it either without his enablers, McConnell, Barr, et. al.
Trump says this will be the most rigged election in history.  I hope he‚Äôs proven wrong, but given that he (and probably his financier, Putin, and voting-machine company owner daughter) is the one attempting the rigging, this is the closest he‚Äôs ever come to telling the truth.
The episode of Seinfeld when they take the limo and George is mistaken for a literal Neo Nazi and an White Power spokesman is 10/10 entertainment (because his speech sounds word for word like Trump today??)
Of course it is. look at Greg Hughes for instance. He ran his campaign on the idea of ‚Äòoriginal Trump supporter‚Äô look where that got him in the primary. Katie Witt in kaysville in Congressional race as well.stupidity starts at the top (Oval Office) and seeps into local politics
Why MAGA? Isn‚Äôt it great now with Trump as president? Oh yeah you‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs not
Did they not get the memo that Trump‚Äôs chances of winning are lower if the voter turnout is greater. I mean duh, ever heard of the southern strategy?
I may have not agreed with everything  did as President, but he had the best interest of #Americans at heart. He was a true leader of our Country, unlike #Trump who only cares about money!  failed our country, caused more divide, death and corruption.
#Trump...just go ahead and start packing, your time is up in the White House.  You failed the people of the United States. People are tired of you and your lies. You are worse the #cnn.  You proved that you do not care about the people, just the almighty Dollar.  #VoteForOurLives
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Trump earned being a pariah, being deceitfully mean-spirited.Seems every leader who died during this Admin made clear he‚Äôs unwelcome.  Imagine you get told an acquaintance doesn‚Äôt want you at their funeral. Now imagine it over &amp; over.  Now imagine thinking that‚Äôs a badge of honor
I don‚Äôt like Trump.  With that understood, please seek professional psychological help.  I mean that sincerely.And They Came Up With A Great One üëçü§£
Trump's healthcare plan is literally #Obamacare, but with Trump's signature on it.
I‚Äôm not a trump fan, I‚Äôm just saying the hypocrisy is incredible. You were not allowed to visit your dying grandma who died alone in the hospital scared and without anyone and the next day it was acceptable to gather in the streets and scream in each other‚Äôs faces .
Sad thing is Trump absolutely knows the whole Tik Tok thing is no actual threat to him. This is merely a ‚ÄúI can do what I want‚Äù move. Notice how *possible* things are when a leader places emphasis and focus on that thing.

Ugh the amount of you that blame trump for not requiring martial law is insane. we live in a federalist system. Trumps a moron but he didn‚Äôt shove seniors back into their nursing homes at the epicenter of a pandemic Which mostly affecting seniors like Andrew cuomo did.

I mean it's not that Russia, China, and Iran are secretly manipulating things so Trump and Biden face off (no matter how many big-brained Dems claim otherwise), just that out of those two they have their preferences. This is not as big a story as some think it is IMO.
Presuming the Lincoln Project is rational, both of these sentences are lies. Biden believes in abortion. *Devout* Catholics do not. Trump has never gassed peaceful Americans.

So, anyone wanna place bets that Trump's miraculous Oct vaccine for #SARSCoV2 is just going to be yet another push of #Hydroxycholoroquine?
I wonder if the world and it‚Äôs symstems are really broken and everything that is going on, including Trump, is just a distraction from letting the panick really set in across society.
So exactly where does Trump think he has power on his own to cut payroll taxes and extend unemployment supplements without congress. Is he king or dictator now?
Dems cards much weaker now with better jobs report and virus cases declining in TX, CA, FL, AZ. I can see republicans walk away and do executive actions now. They know courts will overturn but Trump can crow ge tried to help but democrats stopped him.
With signs virus cases and deaths now past max and more jobs than expected July she waited too long to compromise. Now republicans starting to feel jobs will recover and can put blame on democrats by doing executive actions that when fail in courts Trump will blame DEMS.
Unsurprisingly, a known liar who Trump pardoned for a felony, is lying to make it seem like Trump isn't as stupid as Trump clearly is. I've been to these places. That is not how people pronounce Thailand.

And to pay his personal debts with taxpayers money.  Did the national deficit decreased during the Trump Administration? Nope! It double Moscow Mitch and added 45,000,000 Americans to the unemployment list and 1,500 Americans fatalities per day.  Killing America Great Again!
Trump is taking bets that his administration will kill $500,000 Americans by Thanksgiving Day while his Senior Advisors and relatives wish they get to the $500,000 Americans deaths by Christmas.  The Trumps are such an example of Russian patriotism!
Yap! ... the No Respect for Americans is part of his Royal Blood.  With all the charity work done by the NRA, the historic number of mass shootings is proportional to the money ‚Äúdonated‚Äù to the Trump Foundation mainly known for feeding Trump‚Äôs hungry kids with Goya beans.
Trump is still using taxpayers money to subsidize his political campaign while denying an extension to 45,000,000 of Americans their unemployment benefits.  Trump had a vision that Biden will upset God by having an affair with Karen Mc Dougal and Stormy Daniels.

Yap! ... the coronavirus has stabilized and kills only 1,500 Americans per day... and Trump aced his cognitive test!
More than 1,400 Americans die from coronavirus daily... lets vote this idiot out of the White House before Trump kills all of us.
He gave up. He can't lie about it. He can't manipulate it. He can't twist it. He can't hide it. This is when an actual leader would be nice. Trump is nothing but a wannabe con man. Not even a big boy in the real estate world. And an itty bitty virus laid him low. Scumbag.

Soon Liberals taking over ha ha!! And we can use Trump‚Äôs examples executive orders you conservatives supported to do stuff on guns and right wing hate groups too. Biden gonna love the new powers President Trump established.
Worst crime rates in Red State in south. The homeless are essentially refugees from other places do to failure of capitalism. Often driven out by police. Few homeless from cities they are now, they come from other places. And homeless up every city in US due to Trump.

I think it's just bad optics (from a Trump perspective): a small, underwhelming crowd socially distanced and wearing masks.
Based on polling right now, Solid and lean toward votes give Trump 170, Biden 268. Battle-ground states total 100 more votes. Meaning Trump must win every single one of those votes to get to 270 and be re-elected. Biden needs to win just 2. But 3 months is eternity.
We let Trump rise by laughing at his conspiracy theories and not taking him and all the extreme media more seriously.  More than 156,000 Americans are death because the actual administration does not care about America and the GOP endorse such behavior.  We need to vote them out!
So Trump is cool with an American company buying the US assets of #TikTok, but ONLY if the US gets a substantial cut of the sale?! When has that EVER been how we do things? I guarantee you Trump has some scheme to make a crap ton of money off of this deal somehow.
I agree.  How much do you miss a President like Barak Obama?  How much did we do to silence the Birthers and Obamacare Death Pannels conspirazy theory?  We left President Obama alone and he and Joe Biden were bullied by Hannity, Limbaugh, Trump, Mc Connell, and Alex Jones.
I agree with this statement in the abstract sense, but I worry that Trump and his supporters lack the ability to correctly distinguish truth from falsehood.
They don‚Äôt want Biden to debate Trump, as Biden can‚Äôt form a coherent sentence. Dude has no chance of becoming president
I agree 110%.  A nation designed to lead the world in social justice and economic prosperity can‚Äôt afford either extremes.  MSNBC and the FOX News can‚Äôt manipulate the public opinion and spread division and hatred.  I never liked Trump but his failure affect my me and the nation.
Pam, we only learned through painful experiences.  The GOP adopted Trump‚Äôs corruption and they will regret that for at least the next twelve years.  Millennials and immigrants are a growing Democract majority.

Worse human being ever! Trump hates middle and low income Americans including his own MAGA followers:
Trump does not care about his own MAGA followers:

Trump did not even lose yet and he is already calling himself a LOSER!
That's a pretty low bar. Hardly any effort at all. When Trump is lying,  you KNOW he's lying. I'd like to see you keep track of all the lies from previous presidents too! Those MFers were sly.
Is Trump trying to build a safer west wing for the new President Joe Biden?
Why not vote for  at that point? Not Trump. Not pissing herself. It's kind of sad that's a qualification in this election, but I guess that's where we are.

True. Program contracts 2014. Before Trump. Only credit Trump can take is he wasn‚Äôt dumb enough to cancel it?
Some other president will claim credit Trump‚Äôs moon program after 2024 too. That‚Äôs politics I guess. Almost never is a program started by a president at NASA done in his term. They take many years.
Program started 2011, contracts awarded 2014. Trump started office Jan 2017. He has not modified contracts for this program at all. So why he gets any credit?And something the Trump administration has been trying to end by not defending Obamacare in the Texas lawsuit

Trump has been trying for years to invalidate this provision in the ACA, which was passed by Congress, so he could try to swoop in &amp; implement the exact same thing by Executive Order. What a worthless president.

I noticed the second word in your header is Family. Ask Jason miller  about family. Yet you retweet him. Gross. Your first word is Faith. Something trump has none off. Never been to church. He‚Äôs the opposite of Christ. You are a sheep.
Obviously, Trump hasn‚Äôt read the Bible and thus has no favorite verses or ever memorized any. I think I had memorized Bible verses by the time I was 6 years old. Trump should have been able to answer this easily and quickly
Nearly any thinking person could debate Trump. He can‚Äôt stay on topic, can‚Äôt focus, can‚Äôt speak in logical sentences, and can‚Äôt make an argument or reply to one without praising himself. All Biden has to do is show us what a sane person looks like.
They voted for trump, so yeah.
Trump and the GOP are so damn corrupt  They lie, cheat, steal and have destroyed America. But 40% of the buffoonS in this country will vote for stupidity and destruction. Wake the hell up America or we can kiss our asses goodbye.
Must be difficult for the Trump group running both the Trump and Biden campaigns.  Good news for Dems is that is how Trump got elected in the first place with Clinton's help running the 2016 Trump campaign.
the right wing Trump lovers won't wear a mask but why should they? The Governor and Lt. Governor won't put any teeth in a mandate because they love corrupt Trump too much. Trump and the G.O.P. have destroyed this country. God help us.
There is nothing cosmo about Donald Trump. Furthermore, he has a third rate education from a first rate college - the "dumbest" damned student that ever attended Wharton. Furthermore still, he is a failed illegitimate president permanently impeached and a joke of a man.

Why? You would vote for trump/pence because of Biden vp choice? That is absolutely silly. Look at the state of this country. We have literally become a shit hole country because of trump. And you would vote to keep that? GTFOH
Yes, Trump is dumb, we get it. This country will go through a recession to the point where society completely collapses and people will still point out Trump pronounced something wrong the other day. Yes he‚Äôs a stupid man, that‚Äôs nothing new. You‚Äôre not breaking any ground here.
It could, though. So many of these Republicans are complicit in upholding Trump when they had many chances to get rid of him.

Pathetic u &amp; others blaming him for the for the coronavirus. We should be blaming China and holding them accountable. Democrats want to make the USA a communist shithole. Vote TRUMP 2020
I would pull over and tell him, "To drive in my car you either have to be a Trump supporter or be quiet if you're not." I'd then give him the choice to ride quietly or walk home.

I hate to be agist, but in addition to simply being the worst, no one needs a 78yo Trump running again in 2024.   But 100% agreed with Kamala Harris.
But many people are as stupid as Trump.
Trump said there would be doubts about mailing votes,but the source of doubt is himself,He might manipulate it,turn a vote thats not his into one thats his.
Our President Trump is too stupid and the officials are very stupid.
Because of our governments default racial discrimination,together with presidents disregard for the people,the goal of President Trump now is to collectively smear China,in order to achieve his goal of re-election,But he was wrong,not all Americans are fools.
Yes, I think your president is very good,100 times better than our stupid President Trump. Our president has no goal for treatment,only a lot of goals for his shirking responsibility.
Regarding the election, we will not support idiot Trump,But I knew there'd still have idiots behind him,compared to Trump, your president has done a very good job. our president shirk his responsibilities always.
No one deserves it more than #Trump! üò°
We cannot do 4 more years of #Trump!

And for what it is worth I didn't vote for Trump in 2016 and I won't vote for him in 2020
The only reason Biden wins is because enough people are sick of Trump. No one, let me repeat, no one is voting for Biden because they like him or want him to be President. They simply don't want Trump.
Do you think we will see the same phenomena as last time where people won't say in a poll they are voting for Trump but when push comes to shove they cast their vote for Trump?
Historically Fox News watchers vote, NBA viewers don't to the same extent. I personally would much rather watch the NBA over cable news. I am sick of non stop talk about Trump
To be honest, the common denominator is that Chicago keeps voting democrats for their state and local government. That's the real issue. Not Obama or Trump. State and city officials have failed over and over. But hey, keep voting Democrat!
I get it if you are voting against Trump the person. I just hope everybody understands the policy behind door number 2.
It wasn‚Äôt just Trump. The senator‚Äôs never tried to dtop him and redeme the party. They are all in on it. It is a secret combination.
Trump's Covid boast is nearer to the truth than his opponents would like to admit. So much for the conceit that a reckless president has led the US into a disaster.  #coronavirus
I figure I will support  because #Trump is dangerous for our country NOW! They can rebuild their Republican Party later &amp; hopefully it‚Äôs better. But if Trump gets 4 more years along with the #GOP &amp; #MitchMcConnell we are ALL screwed. Bigly! We need the help!

‚ÄúDrain the swamp‚Äù means different things to different people. It can mean get rid of one party or the other, cut the ties between money &amp; politics, end corruption, etc. For Trump it means make everything favor him so he can get more money &amp; power while avoiding jail. #KingConDon
Donald Trump said that he has done more for the black community than anyone. With the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln.. üò≥ I‚Äôm sorry wtf üòÇüòÖ I love being led by a delusional man.

Go President Trump. I've been traveling from California to Nevada to Idaho to Montana to Wyoming to Utah. And every state I go to wearing my trump hat. Everyday at least 5 to 10 people come up and whispered to me I like your hat. There are mil of silent majority Speak up people
Apparently #Trump isn‚Äôt very concerned about mailing in his own ballot! Why should we be? My state has voted by mail for years with no problems at all. #MailInVoting
wait, you‚Äôre telling me this Trump-Swan interview ISNT satire????
#LincolnVoter I was GOP 25 y, started seeing hypocrisy for the good of the party 10 y ago in CA. (I‚Äôm not Democrat either bc of hypocrisy.) Last straw was when I saw GOP allow Trump to castrate them all. #CountryOverParty The only GOP senator who still has balls is Romney.
He also described Trump perfectly b4 Nov 2016: liar, con artist, no morals or ethics, stupid, narcissist, chaotic, weak, hypocrite, destructive, loves money and self above all else, etc. #Hypocrite
Romney has been too wimpy regarding Trump except for this vote - what incredible courage it must have taken for him to vote Trump guilty! He knew exactly how much trouble that would bring him bc he represents lots of GOPs. I sent him a thank-you letter. #CountryOverParty

Exactly, only Racegate is a constant. They're trying to prove, however unsuccessfully that Trump is a racist.
My own questions about Biden's cognitive health were not based on some absolute (he stutters), but on a relative comparison to the past (even 2016). In the same way, in my opinion, Trump's cognitive function has declined markedly over the past 4 years.
Agreed. Fortunately nobody from the Biden or Trump campaigns has invited me to treat either candidate. To be fair, I would have no idea where to begin since I'm not a neurologist, but I'm confident it would be very entertaining. üòÜ
This is what happens when you live in Trump world üôà
Yep, and #Trump is nobody‚Äôs real friend either!
That‚Äôs fair. I would be hesitant to draw conclusions even from a neurologist who has not specifically evaluated him in person, but I understand the basis for your statement. And I agree that Trump is not doing anything to help himself on this front.
#Trump is lying about the incident in #Lebanon!

Remember when Boris Johnson didn‚Äôt take COVID seriously until HE got it pretty bad?  Trump is damn lucky he is so sheltered from everything.
No but Trump said Herman was a friend. Not that he was a good friend obviously.
He has a chance, but he won't win and probably won't even be the one running against Trump come November
Tik Tok, fake news, immigrants, anti-fascism, it's really hard to keep track of all of Trump's declared enemies
Trump is so evil that he is like a giant magnet drawing more evil to him and everyone that has evil in them is drawn to him. And those evil people draw more until the evil consumes them all. The only thing good people can do to combat this is to do good things with good people.
I've seen many Trump supporters claiming Biden is not cognitively well and that they don't trust his mental capacity. How can they feel better about their guy? Neither are strong speakers

5. Trump has created thousands upon thousands of jobs all while still keeping the market affordable for everyone at reasonable prices.  6. No he‚Äôs not.  7. Prove it. 8. You look dumb rn 9. Take your dementia pills.  10. That‚Äôs the farthest thing from the truth.

1. Trump knows how to play the ball game with democracy, remember 2016? 2. He‚Äôs the president that‚Äôs been protecting it out of the past 3, damn you‚Äôre ignorant.  3. Anyone that‚Äôs government lies their ass off, just like you do.  4. He‚Äôs worked closely with WHO the entire pandemic
It‚Äôs must be pretty bad if they are afraid to debate Trump.  The US has never had a President that inserts his foot in his mouth so often.  I would think the media would be begging for another opportunity to twist Trumps words and run bias stories that make him look bad.

Regardless of how poorly Trump has handled things, it is incredibly ignorant to say he is RESPONSIBLE for all Covid deaths. If so, then Obama was RESPONSIBLE for all H1N1 deaths (mostly young ppl). And H1N1 originated in the US, so shall we also blame him for worldwide deaths?

The real question is where the hell is POTUS with them damn coronavirus tests and PPE for our healthcare facilities, our schools and Americans.   Wake up team Trump! Americans are dying daily by the 1,000‚Äôs. Joe and Hunter are fine. Worry about the people you should be dammit!!!
America needs to remove Trump from power  and the White House. He has really cramped America‚Äôs style. Oh and wait he won‚Äôt rent to black people but he will rent a black man to run for president only because he can‚Äôt beat Bidenalone. Kanye shame on you for being used like that
It‚Äôs official America has 2 unstable men teaming up to run against Biden! Yup!!! Its going to take more than 2 unstable cables (Trump and Kanye) to play dirty tricks to win. Roll your sleeves boys it ain‚Äôt going to be easy sleezies
Trump will get that amount, not Kayne.
I'll take it.
Exactly! They KNOW there is NO WAY in God's Earth he is getting anywhere near 50% of the vote. He will be lucky if he gets 30% with #COVID19 raging. They are hoping Kayne takes some black votes. He may get some young dumb Trump voters though.
andy bernard is definitely a trump supporter
I know its going to tighten up, because right leaning people are gonna hold their nose and vote for Trump.  But Biden would have to really screw up to lose.
Say what you will about Trump (and I do, I‚Äôd never vote for him), but the cool thing about this is that Biden will sleep through it all too!
Trump is such a fraud, and the Republicans need to go down with him, he has ran out of plausible lies, but it doesn‚Äôt stop him
Everyone should just welcome trump to social society. We run this country mother fucker not you, you are our civil servant stupid fuck, do your job. We will bitch and complain until we get what we want and we will strike down tyranny.
Arguing with Trump supporters is like negotiating with a terrorist
Trump helped him
I know what you mean: anyone who thinks Trump was sent by God is crazy.their 7.8 billion people on earth, and god picked Trump, where is the perfection in that?
It‚Äôs interesting how Trump wants to make America Great again and The Democrats want to destroy it. Hmmm ü§î who‚Äôs really on our side?

15 minutes into the Axios interview, and it's plain as day just how out of his depth Trump is regarding the state of the covid-19 in the U.S.
Really enjoyed  interview with Trump. He did a magnificent job of holding Trump accountable and not following Trump down incoherent tangents.
Paper trails are always more secure to that of digital. This is just another reason Trump want's no mail in ballots, no paper trail to keep the Russians or other people from easily hacking into the voting results. Any thoughts?
Congrats, you are literally the FIRST person to make a point about Biden's policy, instead of just railing about Trump. Or how left independents are ruining a party they aren't even registered to ü§£ you win!

You voted for Trump
What happened to states rights? Or does that only matter when it favors the Republicans Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt know diddly squat. He voted on a mail in ballot, in the 2018 election, I did too, it is so much easier than standing in line, and probably safer.

I am not underestimating Trump. Why are you underestimating Biden's right-wing tendencies while exaggerating his progressivism?
1- not really. Biden has already threatened protesters and "violent anarchists," same language as Trump, and promised nothing will change. 2- 1994 Crime Bill. New Jim Crow. Mass Incarceration. 3- *MIGHT* Biden hasn't come out against the expanded powers he and Obama gave DHS

The obvious answer is no. What most people refuse to acknowledge is our country was already in a recession before COVID hit. Trump had been robbing Peter to pay Paul for 3 years to make it look like the economy was doing well. His whole life has been built around fixing numbers.

That's why we need to keep this sense of pragmatism, common sense and simple decency for longer than one or two election cycles. It's cynicism, apathy and intellectual lazyness/selfishness masquerading as a governing philosophy that got us to Trump. Noonan is the perfect example.
Exactly, been hearing nothing but fuck trump and this the best y‚Äôall came up with. The party of diversity? There were better candidates on that ticket that could have given them back the presidency.
I‚Äôm just pointing out why Sanders lost. It wasn‚Äôt any conspiracy, it‚Äôs just simply that not enough of his supporters voted for him. Primary turnout was horrible all around, and I‚Äôm disappointed more didn‚Äôt show up. We do need to get behind Biden, Trump needs to be stopped, now.
I hate Trump.
Re-elect trump
Regardless of the GOP controlling the Senate i   Congress could be doing more to draw attention to Trump's crime spree in progress,  lack of covid response, #RussiaBounty.
I detest Trump and his enablers more.
Trump just issued an executive order that bans tiktok in 45 days if it‚Äôs not sold from the Chinese parent company.. interesting.
Ohh..is Trump following God, bible and religion?...
Like I said before.. Kanye ain‚Äôt the one splitting the black votes.. there are a lot of black people who voted trump and will vote again for trump without Kanye‚Äôs help..ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
so is tRump trying to get in as much corruption before Nov 3 ?  because he‚Äôs sure got a lot of it going on
and Trump has learned alot... He never dreamed the deep horror of destruction being done by these people in power.... I am faithful, this will stop, very soon....
Trump, the incompetent fascist.
Trump is killing Americans
Trump is lying
America has the highest death count due to Trump's incompetence
I am 100% a Trump supporter,  I don‚Äôt get much of the pro left feeds or videos on FB EXCEPT THAT IS ALL I GET NOW  IT STARTED LAST NIGHT!  Everything I am against is on the news feed, the watch videos, the ‚Äúwoke‚Äù culture, etc. NOTHING pro Trump in 18 hrs
Doesn‚Äôt that violate some sort of campaigning laws? I mean, I know there isn‚Äôt a trump from that branch of the family tree that gives a good goddamn about laws and stuff, but that won‚Äôt be happening in OUR WHITE HOUSE!
Also
If there is fear in the air it is from Americans of all flavors, left, right, and independent, knowing another Trump term will continue the devistarion of our great country.
I hope none of them plan on voting for trump. Under trump child sex trafficking prosecution has fallen 32%.
He‚Äôs a Trump supporter
First of all, NOBODY is coming up to him at all!!! They keep everybody away from him!!! Trump don‚Äôt want no ‚Äòrona!  Second, he can just fuck right off!
Yes, because that will make all the wrongs the Trump‚Äôs have done and continue to do, all okay. I don‚Äôt think so.
Nor are Twitter and Facebook obligated to accommodate Trump‚Äôs lies.
The truth is not allowed in Donald Trump‚Äôs America.
Voting For Trump Is Going To FEEL GOOD, 2020 Might Surprise EVERYONE
I‚Äôm afraid this is true.  Comes from the trump appointed PMG.
One thing we are not different on Joe- we know a racist comment when we hear one... Oh wait- if I was offended I ain‚Äôt Latino!! üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇTrump 2020üá∫üá∏
They Unlike us Latinos.... some shit or another... he is certifiably racist and nuts. Trump 2020üá∫üá∏
You can‚Äôt really tell sarcasm on the internet. Wouldn‚Äôt expect a Trump worshiper to know that though.
Lol. You may want to do a little reading on the Trump ‚Äúcharities.‚Äù
Trump all the way but not because he is Republican, in spite of it. Republicans are either traitors or just losers. We need to clear them out as soon as the Dems are gone.
Will this bastard ever tell the truth? This is the monster who hurt protestors in order to have a photo op in front of a church, holding a bible upsidedown. He's sweating bullets because he's desperate.  Trump: Biden will 'hurt the Bible, hurt God,' guns
And of course, Traitor Trump supports an organization that is playing patty fingers with its funds. Just one thief showing support for a bunch of thieves.  Trump Calls New York Lawsuit Against NRA 'Terrible Thing,' Suggests Gun Group Moves to Texas
They are those who have business with Trump and Netenyahu
Trump is close to accusing Biden of being against water
Futile unfortunately.  France and the US have India's back in this matter.  Clearly ...Weapon Sales and Bilateral trade worth Billions and the threat of China trump Human Right and "Values" anyday.
And it‚Äôs beginning to hurt them. I‚Äôve talked to people who voted for Trump the first time, I live in Salt Lake City, Utah, and they‚Äôve said they won‚Äôt this time because how the republicans and trump himself have embraced straight up neo-nazis. This isn‚Äôt reserved for Utahns only.
In Trump‚Äôs America there is corruption endorsed by the Republicans, an invitation of Foreign interference in elections, letting people starve and go homeless during a pandemic and the constant reach of stealing healthcare. Plus, everything you said are lies.
Democratic leadership probably would have responded better, I fail to see what that has to do with the 2020 election. If you're referring to how our corrupt electoral systems enabled Trump to "defeat" HRC then you proved my point. Without secure elections, we are not a democracy
The entire tRump clan is "special". Grifters, cons, racists &amp; cheats...
I still don‚Äôt understand how is Kanye splitting the black votes when a lot of black people voted for trump in the beginning ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è..
"tRump ideals are closer to Christian values than..."  NO ONE is less an example of Christianity than that lying, sniveling GRIFTER.  It's no wonder that Americans are turning away from ALL big business er religious institutions.  Utter hypocrisy.

The one state, Florida, that has the worst record of voter disenfranchisement and suppression is the one state Trump says mail in ballots are airtight
Since Hillary won 3,000,000 more votes we already know. Most of Trump‚Äôs followers are Dems who drag him mercilessly. Your COVID king is going down. #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
Bullshit. Trump is filling morgues.
Shelbys step mom posted something on Facebook along the lines of ‚Äúif you need a reason to unfriend me I‚Äôm pro trump, pro life, all lives matter and there‚Äôs only two genders‚Äù  And what did I do?  Unfriended her lol.
Trump wouldn‚Äôt know or mispronounce it and Biden would go on a tangent and ultimately ask if you‚Äôre a junkie
Miriam thinks Donald Trump is mentally compromised...........

trump‚Äôs ‚Äúmedical advice‚Äù could kill people. You have to be smarter than you look, surely you understand that at some point a muzzle has to be put on his blathering mouth. Or in this case, his Twitter account until he considers public safety.
Trump is clearly nuts. He‚Äôs unfit &amp; needs to be removed.
#DonsNextCon So many Republicans have had enough. Trump has damaged us domestically &amp; internationally. He‚Äôs turned Americans against Americans. If he‚Äôs lost my fiercely GOP, retired, fighter pilot uncle, he‚Äôs lost the presidency. #DonsNextCon

‚ÄúHorowitz also reaffirmed that the so-called Steele dossier, a collection of partly unverified reports about then-candidate Trump, "had no impact" on the bureau's decision to open the investigation.‚Äù
Andrew Jackson and Trump are so alike its scary. Andrew Jackson was a total loser.
This trump interview has completely broken my brain. This man is so god damn dumb that my brain refuses to believe this shit is real. It has to be a bit. Just can‚Äôt believe we willingly gave a guy this fucking brain dead the nuclear codes.
The article on my FB feed makes it sound like Trump is personally giving the $35 Mil, not a govt grant.
Trump is lying, Matt. Lying. Endangering the health of CHILDREN. Come to Jesus, Matt. Trying to judicially force feed propaganda to the masses is egregiously wrong.

‚ÄúHorowitz said his office "certainly didn't see any evidence" in FBI or Justice Department files that former President Barack Obama asked the U.S. government to investigate Donald Trump's campaign, as Trump has charged.‚Äù   Horowitz your boy though.
As crazy at it seems, Bidens ability to do what he did here is the only way anyone can competently debate Trump.
I pray for your safety, your victory over evil, and your complete vindication. I pray you return to Trump's team to help him clean house.
Seriously dude? Trump &amp; the GOP have turned the U.S. into a plague infected third world country. You‚Äôre literally starting to throw children &amp; teachers into the abyss to appease a delusional president. Come to Jesus, Kevin.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a rollercoaster of emotions for [undocumented immigrants]. One day, we‚Äôre telling them it‚Äôs a temporary victory. But now they don‚Äôt know what to do. We, as immigration attorneys, sometimes don‚Äôt know what to do either.‚Äù
I'm just glad we're finally seeing #ConsequencesForTrump Twitter and Faecbook have let him and other right wingers get away with so much. Probably out of fear that theyll attack them or something but it's ridiculous. The rules need to apply to everyone.
Honestly I thought that about Trump so yes I'm worried as f.
"Trump trials we need!"
What is the Trump Death Clock up to today?
Kim, I‚Äôm begging you to encourage Kanye to remove himself from presidential consideration. Trump associates are trying to use Kanye to split the Biden vote. Kim, please, we can‚Äôt endure 4 more yrs of Trump. Please help us stop him.
last count i saw awhile back 3 deaths many many hospitalizations..... SO HAPPY ABOUT THIS !!!
So you do realize with how weak a candidate and unstable Biden is, a vote for Sanders is a vote for Trump really. Same thing happened in 2016...
Trump has to lie. He has no power in the truth. His deflection about Biden‚Äôs capability is clearly a desperate attempt to obscure his own cognitive decline. Trump thinks he can‚Äôt win without lying &amp; cheating, when the truth is that TRUMP CAN‚ÄôT WIN AT ALL. #TrumpThreatensAmerica
Trump is disgusting. I hate him with the power of a thousand suns. This nightmare has to end in November.
Cognitive tests have never been a standard for running for President. Tax returns and health records are and he's released his. Trump still hasn't released his tax returns and seems to have serious medical issues with his mind and body

What a joke. Creepy uncle Joe cannot even get through an interview with his mental state. But maybe as the plagiarizer Joe is, he could steal Trump‚Äôs plan. Or we could just vote #Trump2020
Well, he and his family did kick their nephew Robert's sick child, who suffered from a rare neurological disorder off the Trump family medical plan as a payback for Robert suing the estate of Fred Trump for their rightful inheritance. So there is that lovely precedent.

We don't underestimate the stupidity of the American people, like in 2016, like supporting orange nutsack, we don't underestimate such stupidity. You sir are correct, just look how many idiots are in love with Trump. Person. woman. man. camera. Tv.You're changing the subject. You can hardly believe that Trump supporters have a nefarious bone in their bodies. You doubt that Trump supporters could be so enthusiastic or so desperate as to hack Reddit. Have you ever disagreed with *anything* that Trump has ever done?
I follow Trump and a few other unsavory jackasses doesn't mean I endorse or agree with them in any way I simply don't trust people in general and have always looked to find my own truths Turning a blind eye to your enemy is a fast way to be out flanked This war MUST be won

Trump is already revitalized American manufacturing jobs
Trump signing an executive order for something that already exists is a very trump thing to do.   His cult will hail him as a hero, and a man of the people for it because they‚Äôre idiots.
Dems who regularly make mistakes themselves, rejoice when Trump makes a mistake. They act like Trump needs to be the most perfect human being on the planet, in order to remain in his position. &amp; yet, the Dems have no problem with their own mistakes, even when there‚Äôre purposeful.
Dinesh is giving trump another verbal blowjob in return for a pardon.

Trump is very inarticulate and says a lot of dumb things. It's obvious he's been given new information on several occasions &amp; he can't keep his story straight.  It's very clear is that his administration has not said Russia or othe countries havn't been interfering.

No. Trump is making up China as pro-Biden
He‚Äôs trying to change the prices to lower prescriptions. He said something like he has a lot of enemies and you may not see him for a while. It was sad. He‚Äôs doing so much yet is hated by so many.
Elites ‚Äî and rural America likes Trump why?
Are you calling Trump a communist because of his list of accomplishments?    I agree he is not a conventional Republican and has haters on both sides.
The list includes social welfare, healthcare expansion, environmental protection, affirmative action, anti-discrimination laws, consumer and worker protections that Trump as implemented during his term - I approve Until 2020, Dems were also in favor of border security, like Trump
I truly believe that Trump's followers don't care. They don't see anything wrong with Russia supporting Trump and doing everything it can to get him re-elected. The rest of us may be appalled but not them.

Trump can't do anything. He can't extend the unemployment benefits or send out another round of stimulus checks because those are power of the purse things. I'm fairly certain that a moratorium on evictions is a legislative matter which Trump doesn't control either.
why is this major? Obama and Biden did this eight years ago. Another example of trump supporters being absolutely detached from reality
It was a meaningless gesture since both Pompeo and the Kremlin know that Trump won't do anything. That makes Pompeo's call at best performative for a domestic audience.

President Donald Trump on Friday said that he is ready to sign an executive order that will offer unemployment supplements, eviction protection, and a payroll tax holiday through the end of the year.

Trump Champaign: a dry white with an orange hue, strangely salty, with floral notes of McDonald's hamburgers, and the slight rancid aroma of fecal matter.

Oh, boy.  Pompeo warned Russians about bounties on American soldiers in Afghanistan, but doesn't want to say so publicly because it might make Trump mad.   Wow!
The reality is, his precious president mangled the pronunciation, the way he routinely does with so many words. I'm convinced Trump is functionally illiterate. He doesn't READ. So when he sees a word on the page, he tries to sound it out and gets it wrong.

So exactly where does Trump think he has power on his own to cut payroll taxes and extend unemployment supplements without congress. Is he king or dictator now?
Dems cards much weaker now with better jobs report and virus cases declining in TX, CA, FL, AZ. I can see republicans walk away and do executive actions now. They know courts will overturn but Trump can crow ge tried to help but democrats stopped him.
With signs virus cases and deaths now past max and more jobs than expected July she waited too long to compromise. Now republicans starting to feel jobs will recover and can put blame on democrats by doing executive actions that when fail in courts Trump will blame DEMS.
Unsurprisingly, a known liar who Trump pardoned for a felony, is lying to make it seem like Trump isn't as stupid as Trump clearly is. I've been to these places. That is not how people pronounce Thailand.

Trump does not want Joe to upset God by having an affair with Karen Mc Dougal and Stormy Daniels or cage immigrant babies, or commit bank and insurance fraud, or pardon criminals, or become a pedophile and end up killing Epstein, or evade paying income taxes, or etc.

Yap! Trump wished a little girls sexual trafficker well and shows 45,000,000 unemployed Americans the middle finger!  Trump is such a God pleaser!

And to pay his personal debts with taxpayers money.  Did the national deficit decreased during the Trump Administration? Nope! It double Moscow Mitch and added 45,000,000 Americans to the unemployment list and 1,500 Americans fatalities per day.  Killing America Great Again!
Trump is taking bets that his administration will kill $500,000 Americans by Thanksgiving Day while his Senior Advisors and relatives wish they get to the $500,000 Americans deaths by Christmas.  The Trumps are such an example of Russian patriotism!
Yap! ... the No Respect for Americans is part of his Royal Blood.  With all the charity work done by the NRA, the historic number of mass shootings is proportional to the money ‚Äúdonated‚Äù to the Trump Foundation mainly known for feeding Trump‚Äôs hungry kids with Goya beans.
Trump is still using taxpayers money to subsidize his political campaign while denying an extension to 45,000,000 of Americans their unemployment benefits.  Trump had a vision that Biden will upset God by having an affair with Karen Mc Dougal and Stormy Daniels.

In Trump‚Äòs mind, everything is:  1. Disaster.  2. A mess.  3. Total disaster.  4. A total mess.  Such a Shakespearen high IQ who aced his cognitive test could at least explain with data why everything is wrongly done by other and only Trump is capable of killing 156,000 Americans
Trump‚Äôs second opinion:
Yap! ... the coronavirus has stabilized and kills only 1,500 Americans per day... and Trump aced his cognitive test!
More than 1,400 Americans die from coronavirus daily... lets vote this idiot out of the White House before Trump kills all of us.
He gave up. He can't lie about it. He can't manipulate it. He can't twist it. He can't hide it. This is when an actual leader would be nice. Trump is nothing but a wannabe con man. Not even a big boy in the real estate world. And an itty bitty virus laid him low. Scumbag.

Trump did not, does not, and will not ever care about minorities and low income families.  All Trump cares is taking as much taxpayers money as possible.  How many families could have a paid rent with the money spend on political adds?  Trump is a heartless narcissist bully.

I think it's just bad optics (from a Trump perspective): a small, underwhelming crowd socially distanced and wearing masks.
Based on polling right now, Solid and lean toward votes give Trump 170, Biden 268. Battle-ground states total 100 more votes. Meaning Trump must win every single one of those votes to get to 270 and be re-elected. Biden needs to win just 2. But 3 months is eternity.
We let Trump rise by laughing at his conspiracy theories and not taking him and all the extreme media more seriously.  More than 156,000 Americans are death because the actual administration does not care about America and the GOP endorse such behavior.  We need to vote them out!
So Trump is cool with an American company buying the US assets of #TikTok, but ONLY if the US gets a substantial cut of the sale?! When has that EVER been how we do things? I guarantee you Trump has some scheme to make a crap ton of money off of this deal somehow.
I agree.  How much do you miss a President like Barak Obama?  How much did we do to silence the Birthers and Obamacare Death Pannels conspirazy theory?  We left President Obama alone and he and Joe Biden were bullied by Hannity, Limbaugh, Trump, Mc Connell, and Alex Jones.
I agree with this statement in the abstract sense, but I worry that Trump and his supporters lack the ability to correctly distinguish truth from falsehood.
They don‚Äôt want Biden to debate Trump, as Biden can‚Äôt form a coherent sentence. Dude has no chance of becoming president
I agree 110%.  A nation designed to lead the world in social justice and economic prosperity can‚Äôt afford either extremes.  MSNBC and the FOX News can‚Äôt manipulate the public opinion and spread division and hatred.  I never liked Trump but his failure affect my me and the nation.

Obviously, Trump hasn‚Äôt read the Bible and thus has no favorite verses or ever memorized any. I think I had memorized Bible verses by the time I was 6 years old. Trump should have been able to answer this easily and quickly
Nearly any thinking person could debate Trump. He can‚Äôt stay on topic, can‚Äôt focus, can‚Äôt speak in logical sentences, and can‚Äôt make an argument or reply to one without praising himself. All Biden has to do is show us what a sane person looks like.
Trump and the GOP are so damn corrupt  They lie, cheat, steal and have destroyed America. But 40% of the buffoonS in this country will vote for stupidity and destruction. Wake the hell up America or we can kiss our asses goodbye.
Must be difficult for the Trump group running both the Trump and Biden campaigns.  Good news for Dems is that is how Trump got elected in the first place with Clinton's help running the 2016 Trump campaign.
the right wing Trump lovers won't wear a mask but why should they? The Governor and Lt. Governor won't put any teeth in a mandate because they love corrupt Trump too much. Trump and the G.O.P. have destroyed this country. God help us.
Not to mention Trump did win the last election....

Why? You would vote for trump/pence because of Biden vp choice? That is absolutely silly. Look at the state of this country. We have literally become a shit hole country because of trump. And you would vote to keep that? GTFOH
It could, though. So many of these Republicans are complicit in upholding Trump when they had many chances to get rid of him.

I made it thru 2/3rds of the interview. Kudos to ‚Å¶ for not losing it during this rambling interview. trump should keep doing these interviews. Fodder for Biden, the Lincoln Project, Midas Touch, and ‚Å¶
how about going after Biden and his son. There is proof of his criminal activities. He admitted it on TV. All my kids have jobs and we are better off now than before. But you lousy pricks have got it in your mind to get Trump. You don't have enough protection. Okay??
unbelievable that a person with your intelligence would pull this cheap shot. I dont care what Trump has done and you know he is done more for this country than the last 3 presidents. You are a guy that would crawl over his dead mother just to get his dying sister.
hi i'm donald trump and I am on drugs and have severe  brain issues.  it was no late night coup.  Republican states love vote by mail
You must be facetious to state that Trump is 6'4". He's 6'1-1/2" and he wears lifts. Guy's a fraud. Fake golden combover, fake teefus, and a Hebrew National salami stuffed down his blue suit pants.

I guess if you have false hope then go ahead and believe it.  Looking forward to the trump crime family leaving the whitehouse.   But go ahead and fantasize.
The DHS is led by Trump appointees that are in an "acting" role that is past the 210 max days. The DHS leadership has never been confirmed by Congress. These folks shouldn't be leading the department. Therefore no one in DHS has authority to send "troops" to Portland, etc.
so i guess you don't like absentee ballots either?  Trump voted through the USPS system and says he is going to do it again.  UT votes by mail and it works great
what's going on is that you had paid contractors stirring up trouble so Trump could look tough.   most of the people stirring up trouble were on the Greedy Old Party's payroll.  Don't see hangin Chad talking about all the white supremacists getting arrested

Trump...Bought and Paid For by Russia
I think it's pointing out the hypocrisy among Trump's most ardent supporters. Obama liked the spotlight, but to claim that it was anything near Trump's obsession with it is just ludicrous. There are gradations of ego, and they're not even close here.
Because most of those "wrongs" are fictional and Trump is a real rapist

The Trump Pandemic Response...
They are horrible. I donated to Hillary‚Äôs campaign in 2016, and some to Biden‚Äôs. Trump‚Äôs reminds me of the school bully, taking kids lunch money.
Somehow the Trump campaign got my cell phone number? I don‚Äôt know if someone is pranking me, or what? Take a look though at the difference between Biden‚Äôs campaign, and the idiot‚Äôs one. Biden‚Äôs is chill and normal. Trump‚Äôs is aggressive and loud and ridiculous, just like him.
At this moment where do your loyalties really lie?  You want change but are doing everything you can to keep Trump in the WH.  How can you be a socialist and point this out and not the 685 billion going to F-35 as a ‚Äústimulus package‚Äù for the people?  Who‚Äôs side are you REALLY on
I would also like to know why you are targeting Biden when Trump just gave 685 billion for F-35 in a global pandemic and how many people unemployed and going hungry.  Your priorities are so skewed!  WTH dude????
Seriously fight Biden AFTER Trump is out of the White House!  Not before.  Prioritization is key here
So you would vote for Trump before Biden?  You are a socialist supporter and you would vote Red and not Blue?  Well there is an oxymoron.
So many here think my dislike of Trump is because I am a liberal. I am a registered Republican. I thought it might be great to have a business man and not a politician, but he is an awful business man, no politician.  Trump does not care for American‚Äôs. He should move to Russia

Only Trump would complain that "nobody likes me" during a pandemic. He made Juneteenth about him. I could go on. Sure, "it's not always about him." The sheer stupidity and cognitive dissonance of Trump supporters is something to behold.

Genuinely wondering living in CA and mostly being surrounded by people with similar political affiliations...is the GOP as split as the left right now? Or are they wholeheartedly rallying around trump?
The obvious answer is no. What most people refuse to acknowledge is our country was already in a recession before COVID hit. Trump had been robbing Peter to pay Paul for 3 years to make it look like the economy was doing well. His whole life has been built around fixing numbers.

Yes, because that will make all the wrongs the Trump‚Äôs have done and continue to do, all okay. I don‚Äôt think so.
Nor are Twitter and Facebook obligated to accommodate Trump‚Äôs lies.
The truth is not allowed in Donald Trump‚Äôs America.

Trump all the way but not because he is Republican, in spite of it. Republicans are either traitors or just losers. We need to clear them out as soon as the Dems are gone.
Will this bastard ever tell the truth? This is the monster who hurt protestors in order to have a photo op in front of a church, holding a bible upsidedown. He's sweating bullets because he's desperate.  Trump: Biden will 'hurt the Bible, hurt God,' guns

Futile unfortunately.  France and the US have India's back in this matter.  Clearly ...Weapon Sales and Bilateral trade worth Billions and the threat of China trump Human Right and "Values" anyday.
And it‚Äôs beginning to hurt them. I‚Äôve talked to people who voted for Trump the first time, I live in Salt Lake City, Utah, and they‚Äôve said they won‚Äôt this time because how the republicans and trump himself have embraced straight up neo-nazis. This isn‚Äôt reserved for Utahns only.
In Trump‚Äôs America there is corruption endorsed by the Republicans, an invitation of Foreign interference in elections, letting people starve and go homeless during a pandemic and the constant reach of stealing healthcare. Plus, everything you said are lies.
The entire tRump clan is "special". Grifters, cons, racists &amp; cheats...

Actually the Democrats because they have nothing but corruption to hide. Biden is a part of that. Trump certainly did not need to take a cognitive test because he plays 4 dimensional chess. If Biden wasn‚Äôt afraid of having a cognitive test he would take one but he won‚Äôt.

So you do realize with how weak a candidate and unstable Biden is, a vote for Sanders is a vote for Trump really. Same thing happened in 2016...
Trump has to lie. He has no power in the truth. His deflection about Biden‚Äôs capability is clearly a desperate attempt to obscure his own cognitive decline. Trump thinks he can‚Äôt win without lying &amp; cheating, when the truth is that TRUMP CAN‚ÄôT WIN AT ALL. #TrumpThreatensAmerica

I am betting Biden will do better in the popular vote than Hillary but I think Trump will win the electoral college vote, probably by a narrower margin, but he'll probably do it.
I left the Republican Party in 2015 after Trump got the nomination. The Republican Party has abandoned their values and principles. I will be voting democrat for the first time in 2020. #LincolnVoter
Not that you would know or care but in a court of law curcumstantial evidence is not considered conclusive but a bunch of it together can be used to build a case and establish a pattern. I.e. Trump is a disgusting sex offender
The irony of being accused of being brain washed by someone who's been programmed to believe that literally everything Trump and right wing media says. If i were "brainwashed" would i really be as against Clinton as i am? Im just a person with eyes who can see Trump is a criminal

I don‚Äôt care for Clinton or Trump and I‚Äôm far left? Okay then.
I think many are capable of following more than one narrative. Kind of obvious you like Trump and don‚Äôt like Clinton. I don‚Äôt personally care for either. Your right. My right.
Steve, there are 23 women who have credibly accused Trump of rape and plenty of evidence he hung with Epstein. He‚Äôs no angel. Neither is Clinton. But you just admitted you got that info from, where else, the media.
There are many who agree with you. But unless you are a media member who writes opinion, which I did much of my career, you report the facts. Media has reported Clinton and for that matter Trump involvement with Epstein. You are free to offer your opinion.
Remember how smoothly Susan Rice lied about Benghazi being due to a video? Or how she lied about the unmasking of Trump people in #ObamaGate? Not harmless lies. She also had no problem falsely imprisoning the guy who made the YT video.  This who you want for president, America?

Russia‚Äôs efforts are more entrenched &amp; Trump has actively sought their foreign interference in the past. China is more direct in its criticism &amp; Iran‚Äôs influence is peripheral.
There is no bottom for Trump. He would have given Ivanka to Epstein if he thought he would profit by it.
Sad thing is I think Trump will win in November. I can't do another four years, I rather die, or I will have to leave this country. My mental state can't take it, I hate the man.
Hey!  ! If you‚Äôre going to play a clip of trump attacking  , do a little more than say that Biden fired back in a statement, without enough of the statement to be helpful.
plan all along yet no one mentions it..This way tRUMP says do nothing Congress and he provided for Americans..this guy . is a simpleton How People haven't figured this out yet is beyond me #Bernie2020
I think you're talking about democrats. They have spewed more hate than Republicans have and that's been their whole platform for 3.5 years anything to beat Trump and get the power.
I noticed the second word in your header is Family. Ask Jason miller  about family. Yet you retweet him. Gross. Your first word is Faith. Something trump has none off. Never been to church. He‚Äôs the opposite of Christ. You are a sheep.
Trump is a fucking traitor!
Obviously, Trump hasn‚Äôt read the Bible and thus has no favorite verses or ever memorized any. I think I had memorized Bible verses by the time I was 6 years old. Trump should have been able to answer this easily and quickly
Nearly any thinking person could debate Trump. He can‚Äôt stay on topic, can‚Äôt focus, can‚Äôt speak in logical sentences, and can‚Äôt make an argument or reply to one without praising himself. All Biden has to do is show us what a sane person looks like.
Such a large divide between the progressive left who rallied behind bernie and the straight establishment that forced biden as the candidate from the primaries, obv trump will be the GOP candidate but does the party mostly agree?
Genuinely wondering living in CA and mostly being surrounded by people with similar political affiliations...is the GOP as split as the left right now? Or are they wholeheartedly rallying around trump?
Trump and the GOP are so damn corrupt  They lie, cheat, steal and have destroyed America. But 40% of the buffoonS in this country will vote for stupidity and destruction. Wake the hell up America or we can kiss our asses goodbye.
Must be difficult for the Trump group running both the Trump and Biden campaigns.  Good news for Dems is that is how Trump got elected in the first place with Clinton's help running the 2016 Trump campaign.
The obvious answer is no. What most people refuse to acknowledge is our country was already in a recession before COVID hit. Trump had been robbing Peter to pay Paul for 3 years to make it look like the economy was doing well. His whole life has been built around fixing numbers.
the right wing Trump lovers won't wear a mask but why should they? The Governor and Lt. Governor won't put any teeth in a mandate because they love corrupt Trump too much. Trump and the G.O.P. have destroyed this country. God help us.

Uh the democrats wanted testing and Trump told his staff to stop just to remove the statistics as in less reports less evidence of spread and just bury it. That's you're messiah.

Doesn‚Äôt that violate some sort of campaigning laws? I mean, I know there isn‚Äôt a trump from that branch of the family tree that gives a good goddamn about laws and stuff, but that won‚Äôt be happening in OUR WHITE HOUSE!
Also
Tubby Trump is too scared to release his taxes.
If there is fear in the air it is from Americans of all flavors, left, right, and independent, knowing another Trump term will continue the devistarion of our great country.
I hope none of them plan on voting for trump. Under trump child sex trafficking prosecution has fallen 32%.
I know ppl like to virtue signal &amp; act as if trump is the devil on this app. But the democrats are now full on authoritarian socialist. The but trump says rude things excuse is dead and gone. Authoritarians or the gop, it‚Äôs a simple choice

He‚Äôs a Trump supporter
First of all, NOBODY is coming up to him at all!!! They keep everybody away from him!!! Trump don‚Äôt want no ‚Äòrona!  Second, he can just fuck right off!
Yes, because that will make all the wrongs the Trump‚Äôs have done and continue to do, all okay. I don‚Äôt think so.
He‚Äôs just gunna reply and say Trump inherited Obama‚Äôs economy , even after Obama said that the economy was going to be bad and Trump would need a magic wand to fix it. üòÇ

Well, to state the obvious, Trump has no understanding of how vaccines work or realize you can‚Äôt force a vaccine into existence
I will not vote for Trump. Did not last time. Will not this time. BUT every American should be rooting for a safe and effective vaccine as soon as possible regardless of the election date.

I don‚Äôt think nearly enough people care about the NRA, that aren‚Äôt already Trump voters anyway

Actually the Democrats because they have nothing but corruption to hide. Biden is a part of that. Trump certainly did not need to take a cognitive test because he plays 4 dimensional chess. If Biden wasn‚Äôt afraid of having a cognitive test he would take one but he won‚Äôt.

Trump can't do anything. He can't extend the unemployment benefits or send out another round of stimulus checks because those are power of the purse things. I'm fairly certain that a moratorium on evictions is a legislative matter which Trump doesn't control either.
why is this major? Obama and Biden did this eight years ago. Another example of trump supporters being absolutely detached from reality

All they want me to do is rot in the shitty house they have and wait to die. After I was raped in Hollywood while homeless they told me they wanted me to die to my face. Fuck them. They voted for trump. Even as I was protesting them. They love Fox News. I fucking hate them.

Trump lies. Your ad lies. Fake imagery.
This all could have been avoided if Trump did his job and actually built a national strategy and listened to the experts. But please, keep sharing the NYC death total like you're making some big point and as if they weren't the first big outbreak before we had decent testing.
You know sticking people back in nursing homes only accounts for 20% of their deaths? And I love how easily you dullards fell into Trump's trash of it's up to the states. Right. After Trump punted any responsibility so he could literally claim the same iT wAs ThE GoVeRnOrS fAuLt!

SLC native  , proving a Salt Lake City education can actually lead to something, lays down what bodes next for her generation (gen x and millenials) per our traditional trans-atlantic alliances. There's hope post Trump.
That‚Äôs the only solid argument for biden I have seen.  I‚Äôm still undecided but will probably settle for the corporate dem because I can‚Äôt stand to see trump dismantle all the progress that has been made over the decades.
Does this really surprise anyone? This whole division thing is all because we elected a black man for President. Twice! Shocking I know. Our racist other half of the country and in the Senate lost their minds. Apathy for candidate choices, add nonvoters and you end up with Trump.

This is an absolutely disgraceful poll of Utahns; people who pride themselves on outstanding morals and in following deity who emphasized love and compassion-- the antithesis of impeached trump. Honestly I am unable to comprehend the hypocrisy.

Biden won't save us from Trump. Everyone else in opposition to Trump will save us from Trump. Even Trump is doing a great job of that by alienating as many people as he possibly can. Sometimes I wonder if he is an agent saboteur working against the GOP.

How many Americans died today from the Trump Virus?
President Trump only likes to bring up what has been done. Never what he is going to do to try and slow things down with the virus. He is a terrible boss, which no one who is good hearted, would wanna work for.
Who said it was the same. It can't be the Republican they don't believe in science because theyI want the Bible Belt to follow them. Jesus was healer I don't think the Evangelist Christians teach anything about Jesus. They r as murderous as Trump and his Republican's.

Keep it up idiot protestors. Celebrate criminals, block streets and intimidate drivers. You are assuring a massive victory by Trump and Owens (Utah-04) in November.
Republicans don't like science. It destroys their myths and lays waste to their false assumptions. There's a certain sadness to watch Trump supporters blatantly deny his lies and misdeeds. The rigidity of thought protects them from their own fallacies.
"You can't do that" ... haha. You can't just point out problems with Trump's logic. Not satire, unfortunately. The whole interview is here:

This type of shit shouldn‚Äôt have to be published. This is fifth grade level constitution. Also, citizenship test level constitutional knowledge. As Sen Lindsey stated, if you want to vote against Biden do that on your own accord, not because of this nonsense
He means Biden oh and AOC
Your not, but in an electoral based system, those will always go to either of those parties. In swing states (which Utah is this election), voting ‚Äúother than Trump‚Äù (which a large number of Utahns are likely to do), could result in our votes going to Biden.
100 people vote Biden 98 people vote Trump 4 people vote something else  Biden wins, and we take a huge step towards socialism.
Really! He's not lashing out at Biden, Harris, or anyone else because he's scared, he does all of it because he hates them and us!
Yes, do it now before you see even more evidence that Biden is a walking corpse.
LOL. Only career politicians like Joe Biden get rich off ‚Äú public service.‚Äù President Trump was rich way before he ran for office and donates his entire presidential salary back to the Treasury, keeping only $1 per year. Stealing campaign funds is illegal.

‚ÄúThe Postal Service must not be allowed to fail," NALC President Fredric Rolando said in a statement.  via
No, they all need to get back ASAP and agree to a damn stimulus package! People are hurting.
I'm a small government conservative, so I can't vote Trump. He &amp; Biden are terrible. I'll be voting for a good candidate instead. Fear is a bad reason to vote, especially when Trump spends so much time stoking irrational fears. Why would things be different his 2nd time around?
Got that wrong look into Biden‚Äôs ‚Äútax plan‚Äù yo
Joe Biden's worsed words are a tiny fraction of the hate that boils in your diseased mind 24/7.
- Ban "assault weapons" - Set a harmful precedent with a national mask mandate - Expand our unconstitutional wars - Ramp up the drug war and police militarization - Break healthcare more - Expand anything he wrote bills about badly  Biden is a terrible candidate.
She made a career sending innocent people to labor camps. Close enough.  Trump and Biden are both awful, vote for Dr. Jorgensen.  #LetHerSpeak #SpikeTheDebates
No, but they're both completely awful candidates. Biden has 40 years of bad legislating. Nobody should vote for either of them.
Electing a different "B team despot" is not the solution. Biden is an awful candidate, just as bad as Trump. Maybe worse because he'd face less obstruction from Congress.
With no evidence or discussion? I guess I'm not surprised. If you act according to the Blue No Matter Who trend you'll block me next.  Why do you think Biden is worth your vote?
That's never going to happen without a 3rd party. If we elect Biden we'll just see Trump 2.0 in 4-8 years. Why not vote for real change now instead of kicking the can down the road? Biden and Trump are existential threats to our democracy, neither is worth your vote. #LetHerSpeak
endorses Biden/Harris, which would probably be appalling to Lincoln, as would Trump/Pence. They clamor for the sneeches with stars: Republicrats are all the same now.  Vote Libertarian ( if you want real change for real people. #LetHerSpeak
And the Dems don‚Äôt want her to be POTUS in March when Biden is 25th amendment-ed out of office.
I‚Äôve seen plenty of criticism of her service as prosecutor, the fact that just months ago she fizzled out as a candidate, or that she recently called Joe Biden a racist and believed his accusers but is now running alongside him which makes her phony.  That‚Äôs not sexist or racist.
Joe Biden held a press conference today but took no questions. Instead be said that "every person in the USA needs to wear a face mask when they are outside for the next 3 months". Hmmm ü§îSeptember, October, November. Wear masks until election day?
Man your a hypocrite and her too so it‚Äôs ok for her to say she believes all of the women who accused Biden and now all good what happened to MeToo doesn‚Äôt fit your narrative any longer
If you can‚Äôt even remember what you said then that means 2 things.  1. I see how you relate to joe biden 2. The ‚Äúgifted‚Äù part of your kids must be from your husbands side  (Alternate option 2. Your kids aren‚Äôt gifted, they‚Äôre just smarter than you, which isn‚Äôt saying much)
This is a good list of things to keep in mind when voting comes in November. Supporting Biden has been hard for me because I was so excited to see representation of my progressive views, however I cannot forget the importance of what's laid out here.
this is hilarious, the incumbent say horrible things about almost everyone daily....Harris and Biden made up, he should try it.
Getting the Libertarian Party 5% of the vote and FEC funding will be a much more impactful victory long-term than electing Biden or Trump. It's the only way we're ever going to have more choices in the future. #LetHerSpeak by voting for her this eleciton even if she won't win.
The thing I don't get about "voting for biden is stemming the tide" mentality is ok let's say we get biden in office; then what?? You're being very naive if you believe we can "root out corruption" from the system because the system IS CORRUPTION plain and simple
I'll be protesting in person if they don't include him. Utahns want more voices and more choices. Trump and Biden do not represent most Americans.
Because Biden is going to take your SS and then I‚Äôll get üí© by the time I retire just get your money üí¥ and invest it yourself
You mean Biden?  I mean after 50 years in office and literally doing jack üí© I can‚Äôt believe anyone would vote for that dude take a closer look at his record
Sexist slight? Wow just overlooked ole Biden my man has made lots of slights
Interesting thatTrump said, 1) She has said many thinks that aren‚Äôt true, 2) She was disrespectful of Joe Biden, and 3) She wants to take health care away for millions of Americans. Is President Trump trying to claim that she‚Äôs running as VP on the wrong ticket?
Biden is also an existential threat. Neither has regard for the rights protected by the Constitution. Picking Harris confirms it.  Dr. Jo Jorgensen is the only candidate worth voting for. She gets it and has real solutions that don't involve stripping rights. #LetHerSpeak
I was making a jab at those wanting to defund the police while simultaneously rejoicing in Biden‚Äôs VP pick  But yes, voting for chiefs of police and other high ranking officials could only help with our current situation as well!
You people are missing the point!!!  The biggest difference between Trump and Biden is that Trump is an awful person.  If Biden is gaffing and revealing himself as a racist and picking an awful running mate, that key difference is lessened, even if not overcome. It helps Trump.
You‚Äôre missing the point.   If Biden wants to separate himself morally from Trump, picking an awful, homewrecking skank as VP is a bad move.
Well Biden just ruined my theory about the election and his running mate, kinda pissed I wanted to be rightüôÉ
Haha üòÇ damn just handed the election to Trump...I mean this is the same person who all but called Biden a predator
I'm right of center &amp; I think Kamala is a good selection for Biden. She makes the ticket stronger. Will we see human decency and a return to presidential statesmanship, character and unified leadership that comes with the highest office in the world? I hope so. #GOP #UTPOL
Gee, here's a surprise
That‚Äôs statement would‚Äôve been true no matter who was picked for Biden.
I was out of the country how did all those picks work out?  Biden picks someone who all but accused him of being a predator this is hilarious
This morning Joe Biden announced his VP pick, this afternoon he forgot who it was that he announced. üòÉ
Even if it takes locking people away for life for no reason, or withholding evidence that could prevent someone from being murdered by the government?  I think somehow you might be an even worse candidate than Biden.
Biden Harris 2020. Let's do this!!
Biden/Harris was the last idea on my mind during the primaries (hi, Elizabeth ü•∞).  But this feels like a super-solid ticket for a very important moment in time. I dig it.

Yeah Biden he‚Äôs the answer dude can‚Äôt even form a sentence I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm a Trump supporter but a career politician who has literally done jack shit is the guy

While there‚Äôs no bill that I‚Äôm aware of, the discussion includes members of Congress like AOC and Bernie Sanders.  And given that Joe Biden is currently an empty vessel for whoever is puppeting his corpse on any given day, it‚Äôs understandable to fear who has his ear.
Zelda Williams Calls Out Eric Trump For Posting Late Father‚Äôs Biden Jokes To ‚ÄúFurther Political Agenda‚Äù
You‚Äôre already starting from a place of assumption. Biden is ostensibly more racist than Trump. Yes he‚Äôs an idiot, but so‚Äôs Biden. Hunter Biden is as swampy as they get. The tax cut helped nearly 70% of Americans.  Add in abortion, socialism, and the antagonizing...it‚Äôs not hard.
The power tower needs to fall. The office of President is a lightning rod for sociopaths, narcissists, and liars like Trump and Biden. I'm voting for the candidate who's promising to dismantle it instead of just polishing it.
wwwONE and your minions are going after Biden gaffes?
"There's questionable activity" sounds like a loophole to let plant possession replace getting a warrant. Dr. Jorgensen would end warrantless and no-knock raids, especially those only justified by drugs.  If you want prison reform, Biden is absolutely the worst candidate for it.
OK, more recently: Biden helped Obama expand our endless unconstitutional wars, ramp up the war on drugs, put children in cages at the border, sign a harmful NDAA that contradicts the 6th amendment, force poor people to pay for inaccessible healthcare.. He's a real bad candidate.
Yes, not only is there no guarantee Biden would help, there are literally decades of contraindicators. The Democratic Party is just as corrupt, irresponsible, out of touch, and unwilling to account as the Republican Party. It's time for real change for real people.  #LetHerSpeak
I feel like you've got your hands over your eyes. Almost every harmful thing Trump is doing or has done, Biden wrote laws to enable or sat quiet as VP when precedents were set.  Don't vote for a bad candidate. The cycle has to stop sometime because it's just going to get worse.
Biden's been in office for decades and many of his votes and speeches are public record. It's irresponsible to just dismiss alarmed summaries of them as propaganda out of fear. Can you honestly say that you think Biden is a good candidate?
Why do you think that would not happen under Biden? He has a long career of voting for cronyism, racism, and heavy, harmful authoritarianism. He's just a fascist with a smile instead of all-caps tweets ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Again, what are the consequences? 4 more years of Trump? That's equally abhorrent to me as 4+ years of Biden. Why do you think Biden should be favored over Trump?
I voted for  in 2016 because Gary said bake the cake, &amp; other reasons I honestly don't remember now. I saw Evan speak in person &amp; he appealed to moderation. I don't like his implicit endorsement of Biden this year, and I regret not helping grow the Libertarian Party.
I'd rather help the LP make real than check a box for a terrible candidate just to spite a different terrible candidate. Biden and Trump both represent the wrong way for America. We need a more constrained executive branch or we'll just keep repeating this cycle.
How would Biden magically fix things if he were elected? And if he has all the solutions, why didn't he let Obama know, or implement them during his 40 years in congress instead of pushing racism, imperialism, &amp; cronyism to hurt minorities and the poor? Biden is a bad candidate.
No he got elected because people are tired of politicians who have been in office for decades and have done üí©....you know like Biden
I see it as a waste in any situation. Why vote for either racist lying clown when you can help the Libertarian Party get at least 5% of the vote and secure Federal Election Commission funding? That's a much more impactful victory than electing Trump or Biden.
is the only candidate worth a vote this year. A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump: Biden supported laws that got us so divided and hurt, and he sat idly as VP for more.  Dr. Jorgensen has real change for real people, not more of the broken same. #LetHerSpeak
Lots of people talking abt the political ramifications of Biden‚Äôs VP pick, but I‚Äôm very interested to see how her name is incorporated into his logo and branding ü§î
ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  I‚Äôm fully aware of the definitions, genius.  Anyway, do you think Joe Biden is racist? There‚Äôs as much or more evidence to suggest that he‚Äôs as racist as Trump.
The democrats wanted those things done too though, Biden is literally running on the basis of some of those.
Getting Trump out is a phyrric victory if it means we get Biden instead, and if Trump or Biden wins we're going to see the same dilemma in 2024. Voting R or D instead of L is like arguing about how to paint the walls when the foundation is cracked and sinking. #LetHerSpeak
He just lost the election...how do you think "defund social security and medicare is going to going to sound when the Biden campaign starts using this?
Trump's making this stuff up as he goes.  Biden did no such thing! Biden wouldn't have gone on a 3-day golf trip before passing the $600 unemployment benefits extension!  PEOPLE AFRE HURTING‚ùóÔ∏è   TRUMP IS COMPLETELY OUT OF TOUCH WITH REGULAR AMERICANS, WHO ARE W/O MONEY &amp; WORRIED!
You've been talking in circles, but I'm glad you can at least admit that Biden is not a good candidate.  Hopefully you'll take the next step and vote for real change this year instead of kicking the can down the road.  Do you think we should #LetHerSpeak in the debates?
Biden was tough on Russia as VPüòÇ
LITERALLY all Trump had to do was take the virus seriously, wear a mask, and set strict social distancing measures and we would've seen so many people on the fence vote for him.   Instead he treated it like a fucking joke and now has pushed moderates to Biden's side.  Fuck Trump
You still haven't said why a Biden Presidency would not also lead to that. Why do you think he's a good candidate?  #LetHerSpeak
A vote for Trump is a vote for Biden.  #LetHerSpeak, she's the only presidential candidate worth a vote this year.
A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump.  #LetHerSpeak

Getting rid of Trump is a phyrric victory if it means we get Biden instead. They're both horrendous candidates. Getting Dr. Jorgensen past 5% for federal funding would be monumentally more impactful than electing either creep. Join up and vote for real change.
A vote for Trump or Biden is a vote for the same garbage we've had for decades. Don't waste your vote, give it to Dr. Jorgensen!  #LetHerSpeak #VoteGoldNotOld #JoJorgensen2020

So you're not voting for Biden or Trump, right? Jo Jorgensen is the only viable candidate worth your vote this year. Don't throw it away on Biden or Trump.   #VoteGoldToSaveAmerica #LetHerSpeak
If the election were today, it would be very likely Biden‚Äôs VP would be POTUS in less than a year.   I‚Äôm not happy about that, but that‚Äôs where we are at the moment.
Biden is slip sliding away. He needs to retire &amp; spend his days fishing and reading to his grandchildren. (Notice how I didn‚Äôt say have his grandkids jumping on his lap?) I cant imagine an America where we elect a man who will choose who the leader will be. He won‚Äôt last a week .
This candidate: - Clearly lives an adventurous life - Has to use the normal healthcare system instead of whatever fluffy stuff Trump &amp; Biden have: she gets it - Is transparent about her personal health &amp; fitness for office - Might be Batman  There's no downside to voting for her.
I hear ya brother! And Biden is from Kenya!
He's not creepy Joe Biden.When is the media going to ask Biden a question? Oh wait he doesn‚Äôt know what day it is, what office he‚Äôs running for, or where he is! Really Shannon? Maybe when you can complete a sentence on Undisputed, we will give you an ounce of political credibility.
I speak for myself here, but as a member of the  I am uncomfortable with anyone from the church telling me to vote in any direction.  Trump does not reflect church values.  Biden certainly does not either.  The Savior was pretty clear how he felt about lawyers 1/2
Beyond team Biden?
I‚Äôm busy. Sorry. I‚Äôm working a phone bank for for Republicans supporting Biden. I never no interest in what will fall from your lying lips.
I‚Äôm only curious why this ember is where YOU live. There has been a bunch of interest. Why does Trump still look guilty? His defenders don‚Äôt defend, they what if Biden. Weak. No worth of proof done disgusts me: either lazy or lying.
Biden has one (ridiculous on facts) potential scandal. Trump has thousands. Who looks bad?
If it was equal justice, not fact free conspiracy, yes. Not what it is, not what it was, timeline totally does not support. Biden rids corrupt guy who WONT prosecute Burisma. Next year, Burisma hires Hunter as PR move. A little ICK. Not scandal.
She‚Äôs just mad bc a Union isn‚Äôt supporting the Democratic candidate.  She‚Äôd have ZERO problems if they endorsed Biden.  ZERO.
It seemed like they picked her to take the seat when biden inevitiably becomes unfit mentally
For the second election in a row they‚Äôve had a pretty easy opportunity for a landslide victory... and blown it both times lol I still would predict Biden wins, but not by as much as they could‚Äôve won if they nominated someone decent lol
What a load of misinformation. Biden along with the European allies requested a corrupt individual retired. And they got the money. No election interference. Trump tied duties of office (oval office visit) to something of personal value. It is so opposite its funny.
I don't watch any of the cable news channels. Who said your a racist if you mispronounce Kamala Harris's name? Biden mispronouncing her name doesn't surprise me.
All I'm saying is that Trump's entire presidency has signs of senility. Much more than what weve seen from Biden.  I'd take a Biden administration in a fraction of a heartbeat before another Trump administration, regardless of Biden's shortcomings.
And Joe Biden molested one of his staff and you ignore it.
Its time to replace the traitorist fake Republicans with real Republicans. Non-sychophants to Trump. I'm voting for Biden just to get that traitor out.
Hmmm, trying to keep the focus off of Biden and his diminishing cognitive abilities?
I‚Äôm gop too I talk all the time to some great democrats. And through those conversations I see what teump and his supporters are snd will be voting Biden/Harris.
No thank you.  This republican us voting Biden/Harris
Thank god im not part of that stupid squad!!!  Independent and free women for Biden/Harris.
Kampala, in your own words you have said Biden is a sexual predator, and a racist. Now you‚Äôre his running mate. You can‚Äôt make this üí© up! This is your Democratic Party in all its glory.
If Biden is elected, your health insurance will mirror the failures of the USPS. The government couldn‚Äôt run a hot dog stand efficiently!
Other. I‚Äôm not voting for either Biden or Trump. I‚Äôll likely go third party or write in. Unsure of who as of now. I refuse to pick for the lesser of two evils and the only way to make a third option viable down the road is to start voting for them now.
So untrue, our 401k took off when President Trump was elected after being stagnant under Obama and Biden.  Our retirement income has greatly improved.
Fun fact, trump knew who was the VP pick before Biden even knew. But then Biden forget until he read the teleprompter.
why can‚Äôt you have an opinion without people jumping down your throat and saying well if you support this you DONT support this blah blah blah I don‚Äôt love Kamala she actually isn‚Äôt that great but y‚Äôall we need trump OUT and voting for Biden is the best way out. #wishitwasbernie
Yes. It makes me angry that they ignore the popular candidates and insist on corporate centrists who probably won‚Äôt fix what they need to. I have hope in winning the Senate, and I‚Äôll vote for Biden anyway, but the Dems would‚Äôve done so much better if they‚Äôd just let Bernie win
True on the second part, which is why it‚Äôs such a maddening choice. And I‚Äôm probably too reluctant to believe Utahns can always be so idiotic, but Biden is a centrist and they‚Äôve seen Trump for what he is the last four years
I basically agree with you guys, which makes it even more infuriating that electing the Dems is still critical with Trump and his cronies destroying the country more and more permanently than anyone ever, and Biden probably can be swayed because he doesn‚Äôt really believe in much
Just as NYT Opinion Page spread anti-HRC propaganda in 2016,... Greensit will surely manage the anti-Biden Opinion Page for NYT  this election.  A reputation that took decades to build gone in the matter of 2 election cycles... Guess that's what doing business w/Ru mob can do.
Now do Joe Biden. You people could not be any dumber.
I've been learning about Kamala's smart digital following and ways...
Saw my first post from a Democrat attacking Kamala Harris because she used to be a cop and that Biden had lost their vote. My eyes almost rolled out of their sockets.
What kind of research you been doing? The man touches little kids, can‚Äôt remember what he said 30 seconds ago and once again been in office for 47 YEARS and hasn‚Äôt done shit to BETTER AMERICANS daily lives. Trumps down more in 4 years than Biden‚Äôs done ever
New Zealand hasn‚Äôt had a Rona case in 100 days. Wonder why oh wait hydrocloroquine something trump said worked: I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs perfect but good god if y‚Äôall don‚Äôt see the writing on the wall for putting Biden‚Äôs old dumbass in office we‚Äôre fucked.
Lol y‚Äôall brainwashed. Biden‚Äôs been in politics for 47 years and hasn‚Äôt done shit. Trumps been in office for 4 and had the lowest unemployment EVER, that‚Äôs for all races since Black lives matter, put out bills to help child sex trafficking. To be continued
Wrong. We ‚Äúsuburban housewife‚Äôs‚Äù are a myth you generated in your pea brain. We women are educated, co equals in our families, raise children and bring in the bacon. We‚Äôre voting Biden Harris.
Yes, but Biden will I'll surround himself with qualified, adept, decent humans who will do their best to rebuild what the sociopath and his cabal (&amp; family) of corrupt, racist, entitled monsters have destroyed. Therein lies the difference.
Lol  really backed Biden hoping to be vp shitting on her apparent long time friend  only to not get the VP nom and still shat on Bernie who could have gotten alot garter if she would have backed him lol
Unlike trump, Biden has reading skills!!
Who had the diaper duty today when you learned you and Mikey are up against Biden/Harris?

I agree she's terrible. I just think she eases some of the hesitations around Biden that most of electorate have in regards to his age, capability, and tenacity.
Kamala Harris's signature moment in the campaign was dunking on Joe Biden. Biden then asks her to be his VP. Say what you want about the decision, but I can't think of anything more Not Trump than that.
I truly think that Biden will pick Susan Rice as his running mate.  She has worked closed to him for 8 years and has all the experience we need right now, in this country and outside this country.
I can't speak to Biden's particulars only that 80% of my clients are over 65 and see these issues nearly every day. I have my worries. But being cruel to the elderly or those suffering age-related  infirmities is still far too common.
If you believe Joe Biden has memory-related issues, then sadness for his plight and worry over the potential consequences for our nation are acceptable responses. Mocking and making light of his perceived cognitive disability is an ugliness that has no place in our discourse.
And the next President of the United States is (insert Biden VP pick here).
Biden-Cone 2020. What a VP pick. History will show this administration was very cool and refreshing.
Apparently Biden does.  But you‚Äôre more ticked off Biden showed he‚Äôs fit, and trump is not
Almost as bad as Biden not finishing a single sentence. Oh wait it‚Äôs not even close.
Nice try, keep swinging.  Just don‚Äôt hurt yourself.  Do you give Biden‚Äôs comments this same scrutiny?  Of course not, surprise, surprise.  Oh, and when was the last time Biden had a real news conference?
Meanwhile in the Biden household
Are you really comparing Ivanka to Hunter Biden?  Absurd!
Thank you!
Old news, Senator Graham is a major supporter of President Trump.  Why didn‚Äôt Obama endorse Biden from the very beginning?
Joe Biden‚Äôs son, Hunter, received special treatment from China.  He is beholden to them.
You are fuckin loopy. You should be Biden's running mate. You two would be the greatest shot show EVER!!
Talk about a complete joke, if your blind you could make these claims, but for the rest of us that watch any Biden video can see it plane as day.
Keep trying, ha, ha.  So are you counting how many times Biden says ‚Äúanyway‚Äù like I asked you to?
#MiaLis79 China would prefer Joe Biden?  Wow
Chins wants stability, and this cycle Biden. They are the current counter to Putin. (Discounting our, you know Allies and Democratic international institutions once revered.)
Bernstien update: Biden biking ably, doing road, roague and riff with ease raises renewed reason concerns about his current most pressing concern: the vote.
You‚Äôve made it clear that you‚Äôre anti Trump, and that‚Äôs it period. You can‚Äôt honestly say that you‚Äôre voting for Biden because of the great accomplishments he‚Äôs had as a 47 year politician. The guys a habitual liar, and has voted against racial equality for decades. Bruh, wtf?
How funny the devil that can‚Äôt quote one verse from the Bible is baring false witness about Joe Biden and his relationship with God. I pray the Lord strikes you down. I hope you return to hell sooner than later. It‚Äôs where you belong. #JesusSaves #ChristiansAgainstTrump #Traitor
Legitimately curious, and would appreciate the LDS perspective on this.  The only reasons out there I‚Äôve gotten back when asking this question point blank on social is Trump is bad, you must vote for Biden or you‚Äôre bad too.  I would love something deeper.  Thx.
good morning, just read the Deseret News article.  I‚Äôm a recently emancipated-from-the-GOP member of the church ... but I‚Äôm not wild about Biden yet.  I‚Äôve read through his site and his positions, but can you please help me see why he deserves my vote?   Not trolling,
Absolutely, President Trump is going to win, he has the momentum.  Joe Biden is slowly slipping away right before our eyes.
Nice try, we all know that it‚Äôs Biden in cognitive decline.  It must be tough to admit.  He‚Äôs a nice guy who should be enjoying his retirement.
Lets not forget Biden's "Poor Kids are just as bright as white kids" quote or his wonderful "7-11/Dunkin Donuts" quote.
You just won‚Äôt face it.  I‚Äôm being totally objective regarding Biden.  Trump is Trump.  He‚Äôs just like when he was elected and he has tremendous stamina compared to Biden, it is obvious to an outside observer.  You are too much of a partisan to admit it to me.IDK Dan. I'm not a Democrat (never have been) but I'm solidly not for Trump. Plenty of independents here in Utah I know who feel the same. I wish I wasn't voting for Biden but I don't see a reasonable alternative. Too bad the GOP let itself get hacked and taken over by a conman.
not about Trump or Biden. It‚Äôs about the legislation they push through. Sorry. As long as the democratic candidate is pushing for more babies to be killed &amp; drugs to be legaiized around the country, this mormon is voting for Trump. don‚Äôt like Trump but Biden has dementia.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
What is WRONG with people???? If Biden lost a loved one I would feel bad for him and his family. I think a lot of republicans would. This makes me sick
I honestly believe that Biden will be president for a very short time then Kamala will take his place .. gut feeling
...And Biden supposedly does? If how well a candidate embodies gospel principles is important in choosing who you'll vote for, neither Trump nor Biden deserve your vote.  (Please remember not to use "LDS" or "Mormon"  anymore! Let the Lord pour out His blessings on you!)
I‚Äôm really concerned that Biden WILL pick up where Ovomit left off
Biden can‚Äôt answer randonm questions.
The word ‚Äúdefund‚Äù is unfortunate because that is not really the goal. Biden stated several times that he does not support defunding police.  It‚Äôs simply a matter of deciding what reforms are needed (and where) to best protect citizens.
Join me in supporting Joe Biden via   #VoteBidenHarris2020 üåä
That's funny kind of reminds me of the lazy crazy sleepy Joe Biden swamp.
How did it become the Harris-Biden ticket?
I would hope that she still believes them. She can believe every word she said about Biden and still be his VP. Swallowing your pride for your country is called patriotism.
Speechless reading foolish tweets of people who I‚Äôm pretty damn certain couldn‚Äôt pass a 2nd grade civics exam. The left has lost its mind. This country will be in the toilet and on track to socialism with Biden and Harris.
The United States Postal Service Board of Governors appointed DeJoy in May. You accuse Trump of anything and everything because you are a liberal Democrat and like all the rest of the Democrat Party you know Biden doesn‚Äôt have a chance to win. #Dementia
Bulll Crap. Biden failed to give Welshman Kinnock credit during the convention speech, but was giving him credit to on previous speeches. By the way: Kinnock is supporting Biden.
Mainly because when it comes to actually lowering abortion #‚Äôs, Biden is the candidate. Access to affordable contraceptives is the single easiest way to curb abortions and Trump is against it. Plus, abortion is a legal issue, not a political one. No president can change that
Got my vote. More qualified than Trump or Biden
I am LDS and WILL NOT be voting for Trump or Biden.
Regardless of who you want to win the election, you are a moron if you preach voter turnout and then talk about how big of a landslide it‚Äôll be for Biden. The left played this game four years ago and it probably gifted trump the White House
Whatever...Seniors would be safer getting from UPS and we don‚Äôt want it saved for all those dead people , cats and dogs to vote. Why do you blame Trump when the postal service has lost money for years and years and years-including the ones Obama and Biden could have helped!
It‚Äôs NOT the elderly people that would have an issue with it. Guaranteed. It‚Äôs Democrats trying to use illegal immigrant votes, or fraudulent ballots and it‚Äôs not a secret. Joe Biden is lost in his own body. Wake up.
I registered Republican for the first time in my life, this was going to be my first vote and for you, but now I'm voting Biden cause of what your doing to the postal service, sorry, should have thought it through BIDEN 2020!
The matter of fact is that all Arabs face a regional threat from Iran, and if Joe Biden wins the US elections that threat will increase and to overcome the threat they have openly shook hands with Israel as a regional partner. #uae
Biden/Harris will take all the support that millions of post office workers are giving them. Now that is a endorsement from true blue collar workers. #SaveTheUSPostalService

Twitter has added a "manipulated media" warning to this video. Obviously Hannity is intending to talk about Biden here, but it fits #BunkerBoy like a glove, so, uh... it works. Technically also manipulated media. It's both. That is all. #ByeHannity
are you kidding me Kevin Obama taking credit for Trump's job increase just like oh biden's taking credit for Trump getting peace in the middle East.
And Trump can control all his constituents? It's silly to assume a fact, based on a single biased picture. Either way, it's just pandering. I'm sure I could find things that Biden would contradict. None of it is helpful to the American at large..
Biden = Leader. National mask mandate should have been implemented in April.  #BidenHarris2020
I'm unhappy it's never that bad. Even if Biden wins I'll survive. My bank account and equity in my home may take massive hits, but I'll find a way to get through it and have a smile on my face

As a member and a republican this makes me so uncomfortable!! Haha I‚Äôve seen both #LDSforTrump and #LDSforBiden and it makes me cringe. There are great members who will vote for Biden. There are great members who will vote for Trump. It‚Äôs not a church thing üò¨
Biden doesn‚Äôt know or can‚Äôt remember what or who he cares about these days.
I was hoping that she would give me reason to like her and so it would be less painful if biden won, but she hasn‚Äôt given me much.
Vote for Joe Biden is worse than Trump.
Especially you Mr. Biden cuz you would rather sniff them.
It is a caricature now. Anything America like, the Rep says Biden would remove. Meat, apple pie, football, jobs, BBQ, cars, teddy bears, diet soda, grandmas...ANYTHING. Basically it is TRUMP or TOTAL APOCALYPSE.
Yes he does but never held accountable. I hope after Biden-Harris are elected they convict him &amp; all his friends he let out of jail.
I live in Utah, so my ballot for Biden is going in a ballot lock box.

Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate
Thank you fellow resisters. I appreciate fhe follows. We need to stick together and make sure we put Biden and Harris in office. Otherwise we can kiss our asses goodbye!!! Thanks again.
I‚Äôm not sure that is accurate, but he HAS been on the side of most bad ones. Joe Biden‚Äôs 1994 crime bill has incarcerated more Black men than any single othe factor. Could‚Äôve reversed it as VP under Obama. Nope.
I am patiently awaiting your tweet regarding the way Joe Biden mispronounced his own running mate, I'm wondering if it was intentional by Biden as well?
No, being handsy and sniffing hair is not the same as admitting you think it‚Äôs okay to grab women by the pussy. Who are the white supremicists supporting? thousands if not millions of white supremacists are Trump supporters. Find me one single white supremacist Biden supporter.

Here's my question: let's say Biden gets impeached. Can you honestly tell me that a Democratic-controlled Senate wouldn't behave the exact same way the Republican-held Senate did in Trump's impeachment?  Don't project virtue upon the Democrats that they don't have.
Look at that Biden strength, I bet he can drink water with one hand and walk down a ramp.

Hey  and  you might want to cover up, your bias is showing. I‚Äôve never had a tweet from Joe Biden or Kamala Harris show up on my timeline until yesterday. Now they‚Äôre all over it.
Calling someone racist who you know isn't racist is wicked. Harris did that to Biden, and she's about to do it to Pence.
I have supported many women along the way too. I just think you need to open your eyes about Kamala. She called Biden a racist. Was that true? If not it was wicked. She's ruthless. You'll see.
I love the smell of desperation in the morning!  Smells like Biden/Harris landslide!
Dear People Who Write Joe Biden's Tweets: This is a lie. It was very clearly proven to be a lie. And only people who live in a self imposed bubble aren't aware of it.
And those it happens to become ineffective. Biden isn‚Äôt. He has shown time again his effectiveness and longevity. This will be his grand finale.
Yeah, he tweeted about the bus system in Ogden a few months ago. I think he had a Biden moment.
Would you be outraged if he was wearing a Biden hat? Asking for a friend.

The center-right should abandon Trump wholesale. Vote for Biden, vote third-party, or leave that part of the ballot blank. But when it comes to Republicans in the Senate, vote for all but the true Trumpists.
And it‚Äôs in a state‚Äôs best interest to keep someone in the Senate. The entire body is structured around seniority. Biden‚Äôs longevity is one of the reasons he accomplished so much.

This Republican "suburban housewife" who lives in Utah,  will be voting for Joe Biden.
You can either be center-left or pander to the Twittergressives. Trying to do both just makes the Biden campaign look squishy.
What the Biden campaign probably THINKS it's doing is going with the safest pick that still gives a nod to the Sanders wing of the party.  But an ultra-progressive anchor is an ultra-progressive anchor, no matter how mainstream it looks.
Donald Trump is not her opponent.  Mike Pence is.   Well at least until they push Biden out but that won‚Äôt be until after the election.
Just did this and sure enough it goes directly to Joe Biden's site. WTF!!!
#Biden should make a fourth debate contingent on #Trump releasing his #taxes
Unlike yourself. However, we are all aware the Obama/Biden regime is responsible for the division. Nice try though.
There are plenty of reasons to vote for Trump and there are plenty of reasons to vote for Biden.
I think the two party system is trash and should be done away with. But it‚Äôs not, and Biden/Harris is still MILES better than 4 more years of Trump/Pence. King is swallowing his pride and getting on board. That shows some fiber, to me
He may be a hypocrite (I barely know who he is), but these screenshots aren‚Äôt examples of it. I suppose you think Bernie is a hypocrite for supporting Biden, as well? Or Hillary for supporting Obama?
I was a Warren supporter and didn‚Äôt like Biden or Harris. But now I‚Äôll enthusiastically support them, because Warren is no longer an option. That doesn‚Äôt make me a hypocrite and it doesn‚Äôt make King one either.
I don‚Äôt understand how people think this is a dunk? The first tweet was in 2018, before the campaign even started. OF COURSE he would have preferred candidates. But now that it‚Äôs set, OF COURSE he would support Biden and Harris.
I do not, that's one of Trumps worst decisions. But hear you me our troop presence around the world will increase dramatically under Biden. And the Venezuela coup will happen where Trump failed, and a hot war with Iran isn't out of the question
Biden was just shown in a video riding a bike without a helmet on.   The precedent for his impending accident has been set.
Current Indian government will not like Biden government. They better start praying for his defeat

Column: Biden picks Kamala Harris. Trump should dump Mike Pence and replace him with a yacht.
Oh, is she having trouble deciding between Biden and Trump?  Makes sense now.
It felt like there was a little veiled misogyny in the field as folks easily dismissed huge flaws in Biden and Bernie, but cancelled Harris and Klobuchar for being mean and Warren for being...uhh...prepared
Because she was getting crushed in the polls despite utterly mud-hole stomping everyone in the debates.  I think the Dem Primary was funny because they'd fail to vote for candidates and then lament them when they suspended. Then voted for Biden and now grump about him constantly
Onboard and ready with step one: dump Trump What is step two? Biden is President - how do we have a solid conservative non-Trumpism candidate in four years?
Because Dems dislike Biden even more?
Are we deciding whether to put Cheney back in the White House, or Biden? You know, arms to ISIS and Black men to prison Biden.
I still say if Biden had wanted to win hands down, he should have gone split-ticket with Condi Rice.
Why can‚Äôt we switch it up right now and make it a Harris/Biden ticket instead of Biden/Harris?
As a conservative that isn‚Äôt thrilled with the way the Republican Party has gone, I totally would have supported a Biden- ticket way over Biden- . Kamala is part of the reason we joke that CA is ‚Äúcommie-fornia‚Äù. She‚Äôs an alt-left dumpster fire.
Great combination, her aligning with Biden will ensure Indian-Americans &amp; Afro-American voters.                      Nightmare for opponents !
Sure am! Better dig out the hat and shirts! Would like a new shirt tho maybe with Biden Harris design!
I can't imagine Modi to have a free run under Biden-Harris administration.  India-US relations stand where they are.  However we could even see a "American Values" driven Foreign Policy agenda.
I think that a Biden presidency will be just about the same as a Trump one, except Trump says the quiet part out loud and Biden won't. And I actually think Biden will be worse on foreign policy. I could wrong but I don't think so
CNN is now pushing for Biden to step aside after he wins election. Apparently, his aides are pushing this too in his weak state. In his campaign announcement, he said she would be ready to lead the country. Hmmm.
And you feel no bit of nausea with Biden??? That's all I need to know
4 years of Trump and 4 years of Biden will look just about the fucking same. Except Biden and Co. will stab us in the back, and Trump stabs us in the front. At least Trump makes me laugh...fuck outta here with that "we can't survive" shit

Then also google The First Step Act, a bipartisan bill signed by Trump, which begins to reverse some of the effects of Biden‚Äôs bills. Obama and Biden had EIGHT YEARS and did nothing for minorities in prison, even when the Dems held both Houses
I know, I got an actual ‚Äúburst‚Äù of euphoria when Biden announced his choice for VP!  There is so much hope for us....
The DNC's embrace of civil rights is relatively recent development &amp; one of political expediency only.  I'm still voting for Biden, but I'm not happy about it. lol
I mean If we are talking morally bankrupt I think Biden more fits the bill, corrupt as the day is long, supports abortion up to birth, the equality act (that would destroy church education) but yeah let‚Äôs not vote for the guy stopping those things... makes perfect sense
But you‚Äôre spending more time criticizing Biden and Kamala than Trump and Pence. No free pass is one thing, quite another is a circular firing squad of people with similar but not identical views sniping each other for their differences while their true enemies go unchallenged...
Mixed thoughts and emotions about Biden/Harris ticket. Still supporting them obviously.
According to D. L. Hughley in his book Surrender, White People! Kayne is an "honorary white guy" due to hanging out with Trump &amp; spouting crazy nonsense all the time. Black folks have given him to White people. I'm not worried he's going to take any votes from Biden.

With this pick, it mostly seems like Biden just gave up in the fourth quarter, which the Jazz completely understands
President Trump won't have to campaign against Biden and Harris....all of the former democratic candidates have done that already. Soooo much material out there....all from democrats!
Biden and Kamala are far from radical left. üòÇ As far as I'm concerned, they're cops too.
If you vote for Biden, you‚Äôre really voting for Kamala
I think  will make a kick-ass Senate Majority Leader. It wasn't good for the country to have two very old people on the democratic ticket, so I'm all in for Biden / Harris. Glad a decision has been made.
If you think you‚Äôll see riots if Biden doesn‚Äôt win????  I promise you it will be ten fold the violence in one day then you‚Äôre seen in 70+ KAMALTOEHARIES

Not to mention ISIS, which rose under Obama and Biden backing down to Russia and Syria, was squashed in a matter of weeks under Trump
Trust me Biden will have him removed. The military is not loyal to a President if Biden says remove yam tits, yam tits will be removed.
Baby nut is Biden‚Äôs VP pick
There's a difference between it being his house, which it isn't, and being the house he temporarily lives in. Biden owns his home. Trump DOES NOT own the White House.
I believe this would be extortion. What he thinks people are too enamored of him to notice is that those programs get funded when Biden is sworn in as president.
Donald Trump could pack $1 trillion in a suitcase and take it home when his second term is over and it would still be less costly and a better deal for America than the Green New Insanity and the Democrats  march toward socialism that would happen under Biden.
Joe Biden and 1995 wants to cut the social security benefits for Americans you got to hear this.

You said Biden is a socialist/communist. That is a lie. Stop telling lies. It undermines everything else you say.
Well, they CAN but they don't want us knowing it, because they are desperate right now. If the big germ psy-op bubble breaks, Biden is toast. They know that. They're so scared--not only that we'll disobey, but that normies will figure out WHO has screwed the entire economy--Dems.

Kamala Harris called Joe Biden a racist and he denied it. Who was right? Who was wrong?

Vote for Biden.  Trump is no longer an option. His incompetence killed 170,000 Americans so far including his younger brother Robert.
Biden means hope.  Only a President with his wisdom gained over the year will be able to rebuild America.  Kamala means social justice.

would you still maintain silence if a group (I have no clue if this actually exists) like LDS Women for ERA, LDS for Biden, or LDS LGBTQ for Temple Marriage used this for their causes? If such a group existed and held a rally you‚Äôd be OK with an identical use?
Leadership?  No, Biden means Dictatorship!!!
It's a personal choice how anyone in the Church wants to vote. Both Trump and Biden are morally flawed and how you choose to equate if one is more flawed than the other is also a matter of personal opinion. How the two will govern in office is very easy to see

i dont think this is what you actually want. because guess what. voting 3p doesn't make trump number go up, thus he has the same standing vs biden. voting trump does make the number go up and he has a better standing than before. youre digging yourself in to a hole buddy
Biden's best category is "not being trump." I think that speaks to how Biden doesn't have a specific mandate.   Also speaks to how Trump is not liked in some circles.   Thoughts?
My main man  Would be younger than Biden is now in 4 years.

Biden raises $26M US in 24 hours after Harris running mate announcement | CBC News
So Biden‚Äôs campaign team wakes up each morning and says ‚Äúwhat the hell‚Äù right?
Trump would desperately love to make the media cycle about how desperate the Democrats are because of the new hoax of an impeachment witchhunt. Right now the entire focus needs to be on Biden v Trump. Even a morally correct impeachment would hurt right now. /2
Possibly because it gives Trump yet another vector to distract on. "Oh look, they know they can't win so they're going to try and impeach me again. Witch hunt, hoax, blah blah blah." Nancy wants this to be about Biden and Trump. Not impeaching keeps the focus on the election.
Biden cares
If there are no questions from the press, it is NOT a "press conference." Biden/Harris made a public statement. They did not submit to a press conference.
The difference is that Biden isn't saying anything.
Your going to have a tough road ahead, Joe Biden cannot even finish a complete thought. It‚Äôs sad to watch him. If he was in my family it would break my heart. I say let him enjoy his senior years.
The best part about this statement is that it isn't enough 2 vote for Biden &amp; K, you also cannot criticize them... Holding them accountable is getting off to a GREAT START!
45k people die every year caused by lack of healthcare but nobody can criticize Kamala &amp; Biden even though they do not support M4A and Biden says HE WOULD VETO IT IF PASSED and Biden was the top recipient of pharma dollars in the D primary! V cool Ava!
Yes, ambassador to the Vatican is a known path to billions and endless power. Guessing you could care less about those foreign companies enriching the Biden's via Hinter, though?
It's quite phony to both say you believe Biden's sexual assault accusers, what happened to that story, and accuse him of racism only to later happily accept his offer to run with him. If not phony, what would you call it?
All this disingenuous framing of Biden as a leftist makes me wish we had actually chosen a leftist
Biden mispronounced it, as well. So have countless others. Why is your outrage targeted at only a single conservative?
You‚Äôre deliberately conflating approval ratings with primary choice (a huge chunk of which was for Biden). This is intellectually dishonest.
when people say they‚Äôre voting for trump because they care about their freedom and they think that Biden is a socialist... its because they‚Äôre afraid of their white cis privilege not mattering as much anymore.
Trump, House Republicans embrace unrepentent racist Joe Biden?!?  That can't be right.  Is this a parody account?

What was it all about when Joe Biden mispronounced her name? Please enlighten us.
In case you missed the headline. You have 4 choices Trump, Biden, Third party that is late to the game and no one knows and will only be in a handful of states (waste of time) or sit it out. If you're a democrat then get on board. We don't all agree on everything.
Goes to church regularly? Ha!
the difference is all the teams against team bernie played it out when playing against him. they surrendered and left the conference when they played against team biden.

Will Kamala Harris make a full commitment to running as Joe Biden's VP and resign her Senate seat as proof of her seriousness, or muh?
"I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab 'em by the pussy. You can do anything."   You idiots created the opportunity for Biden/Harris. Don't go blaming us.
Well, because Biden said his main qualifications for a running mate was race and gender. Like her or not, it's been openly stated why she was picked.
Biden is the radical left?! HAHA. I mean, when you're as far right as you guys have gone even an independent must look radical left.

Biden and Obama are part of the establishment, but they're better than Trump. But "the establishment" is as a whole worse than Trump how exactly? Because they promote capitalism and imperialism? Trump does too, but he's not "establishment?"
Are Biden and Obama establishment?
The bigger problem is you treating Trump like an abberation or an abnormality that will simply "go away" eventually. He has done lasting harm in both domestic and foreign policy, and those harms will be amplified if he wins. Biden and Obama suck. Trump is much worse.
Will Joe Biden denounce this, or is he willing to accept anything his supporters do in the name of social justice?
lmao at Biden supporters who think that bullying people into supporting their candidate will make leftist voters want to support him if he wants the vote from the left, he needs to earn the vote from the left; simply not being trump isn‚Äôt enough
Just a heads up, Biden has said he will veto Medicare for All if it passes. This is one of the main reasons why I have major issues with him as the nominee
How is it that any level headed, reasonable thinking person would want to vote for Biden/Harris &amp; bring us to the brink of Socialism. Socialism is evil. Think about it people. Do you want Socialism? Look at what the Dems platform is. What do they support?
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see this election as being about choosing a candidate who will be able to lead us in the right direction. It will be about choosing a candidate who can be most effectively pressured into allowing more space for the evolving anti-racist movement.‚Äù

Everyone knows this election will be Biden‚Äôs VP vs Trump. He had a chance to add fire to a bland campaign and some electability to his otherwise weak bid for office. He added fire, I‚Äôll give him that‚Äîbut Harris is far too controversial to be electable.

alright folks does anyone actually believe that biden will undo the massive overreaches of executive power that trump caused and if so give me any reason why lol
I wouldn‚Äôt say Harris or Biden qualify as middle on police reform.   Trump will argue he has done more for reform then them, and he will have some actual points to make.   They all have invested a lot in our unbalanced justice system.
No. I'm an American. And I'm not dissenting anything. Or dividing. I'm uniting behind #BidenHarris2020  Im calling out the bot dissenters who are crying and saying they won't vote to try and sway others to do the same. Are you Voting Biden or sitting out?
Biden picking Kamala Harris only makes sense if Biden just gave up and intentionally didn‚Äôt try
Trump is the incumbent. His infidelities are well known and built into his persona. His voters know what they‚Äôre voting for and have made peace with it. Women won‚Äôt move from Trump to Biden for Harris. She is nearly as unliked as Hillary and she‚Äôs proven to be morally bankrupt.
Trump won‚Äôt have to. Willie Brown has admitted that he appointed her to high paying fast-track positions that she wasn‚Äôt qualified for simply because of their relationship. Biden has now alienated a female voter block who despise the image of women moving up from their knees.

Agreed. It‚Äôs wonderful. I‚Äôm even happier about the prospects of KH taking over the reins at some point. I see the Biden/Harris pairing as a competency or power equivalent of the Bush/Cheney ticket. Good news in 2020 is hard to come by, so I‚Äôll relish this until Election Day.
Joe Biden just picked for VP running mate Kamala Harris, a police officer who descended from a slave-owning plantation owner Hamilton Brown, told him to his face on a debate stage that his policies are racist  How could this possibly go wrong with today's Democrats?!

OK, I apologize that I misread it.  I am inspired by people coming together to defeat an incompetent, immoral, and divisive president.  Kasich isn't going to talk about his ideas. He's going to make the case for Biden from his perspective; we'll see if it gets votes for Joe.
I don't think that's true.    and  are speaking the same day.  Also, did you read the joint policy recommendations from the Bernie/Biden working group?
Biden promised us a woman
OK yes Biden used the N word. 40 years ago. Why if he's so bad would a black man pick him as VP? And still endorse him now. Biden is the nominee you don't like it. Fine that's your problem. I'm committed in my vote so you are wasting your time and mine.
How is she a hypocrite? She supports Biden. And I take it your not voting. So like not voting STFU. Stay silent. A non vote is a silent voice. Everyone in politics has mud on their shoes if you look close enough.
1  a time. A book Trump read and quotes. Biden meeting Putin when VP not uncommon to shake hands. Proof that insurance companies are still fucking us. And Obama on the economy and why it's important to protect the Middle class. He did. Trump has ruined it. He's pres. 3.5 years.
Still with that shit.  Yes Biden gave support to the war in the beginning. Then he saw where it was really going and changed his mind. What do you care about human life? You support kids in cages at the border. You support suffering in South America and Central America. üñïüèª

Any vote not For Biden is a vote for tRump! There is NO "i" in TEAM Biden.IDK Dan. I'm not a Democrat (never have been) but I'm solidly not for Trump. Plenty of independents here in Utah I know who feel the same. I wish I wasn't voting for Biden but I don't see a reasonable alternative. Too bad the GOP let itself get hacked and taken over by a conman.
not about Trump or Biden. It‚Äôs about the legislation they push through. Sorry. As long as the democratic candidate is pushing for more babies to be killed &amp; drugs to be legaiized around the country, this mormon is voting for Trump. don‚Äôt like Trump but Biden has dementia.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
What is WRONG with people???? If Biden lost a loved one I would feel bad for him and his family. I think a lot of republicans would. This makes me sick
...And Biden supposedly does? If how well a candidate embodies gospel principles is important in choosing who you'll vote for, neither Trump nor Biden deserve your vote.  (Please remember not to use "LDS" or "Mormon"  anymore! Let the Lord pour out His blessings on you!)
Biden can‚Äôt answer randonm questions.
The word ‚Äúdefund‚Äù is unfortunate because that is not really the goal. Biden stated several times that he does not support defunding police.  It‚Äôs simply a matter of deciding what reforms are needed (and where) to best protect citizens.

How did it become the Harris-Biden ticket?
I would hope that she still believes them. She can believe every word she said about Biden and still be his VP. Swallowing your pride for your country is called patriotism.
Speechless reading foolish tweets of people who I‚Äôm pretty damn certain couldn‚Äôt pass a 2nd grade civics exam. The left has lost its mind. This country will be in the toilet and on track to socialism with Biden and Harris.
The United States Postal Service Board of Governors appointed DeJoy in May. You accuse Trump of anything and everything because you are a liberal Democrat and like all the rest of the Democrat Party you know Biden doesn‚Äôt have a chance to win. #Dementia
Bulll Crap. Biden failed to give Welshman Kinnock credit during the convention speech, but was giving him credit to on previous speeches. By the way: Kinnock is supporting Biden.
Mainly because when it comes to actually lowering abortion #‚Äôs, Biden is the candidate. Access to affordable contraceptives is the single easiest way to curb abortions and Trump is against it. Plus, abortion is a legal issue, not a political one. No president can change that
Got my vote. More qualified than Trump or Biden
I am LDS and WILL NOT be voting for Trump or Biden.
Regardless of who you want to win the election, you are a moron if you preach voter turnout and then talk about how big of a landslide it‚Äôll be for Biden. The left played this game four years ago and it probably gifted trump the White House
Whatever...Seniors would be safer getting from UPS and we don‚Äôt want it saved for all those dead people , cats and dogs to vote. Why do you blame Trump when the postal service has lost money for years and years and years-including the ones Obama and Biden could have helped!
It‚Äôs NOT the elderly people that would have an issue with it. Guaranteed. It‚Äôs Democrats trying to use illegal immigrant votes, or fraudulent ballots and it‚Äôs not a secret. Joe Biden is lost in his own body. Wake up.
Biden/Harris will take all the support that millions of post office workers are giving them. Now that is a endorsement from true blue collar workers. #SaveTheUSPostalService
It‚Äôs weird hearing joe Biden form coherent sentences
Biden-Harris 2020 light at the end of the dark tunnel.
Vote for Biden and Harris!
Twitter has added a "manipulated media" warning to this video. Obviously Hannity is intending to talk about Biden here, but it fits #BunkerBoy like a glove, so, uh... it works. Technically also manipulated media. It's both. That is all. #ByeHannity
And Trump can control all his constituents? It's silly to assume a fact, based on a single biased picture. Either way, it's just pandering. I'm sure I could find things that Biden would contradict. None of it is helpful to the American at large..

Look I‚Äôm atheist so I could care less about a presidents religion or lack thereof, but to claim Trump is more ‚Äúpro god‚Äù than Biden, who‚Äôs been a practicing catholic his whole life is just laughably stupid. He‚Äôs the least Christian president we‚Äôve ever had.

It‚Äôs different. The Hunter Biden thing stinks, but getting a job because of who your dad is happens everywhere. But Hunter didn‚Äôt get a job in the White House while Joe was there. Ivanka and Jared did.
As a member and a republican this makes me so uncomfortable!! Haha I‚Äôve seen both #LDSforTrump and #LDSforBiden and it makes me cringe. There are great members who will vote for Biden. There are great members who will vote for Trump. It‚Äôs not a church thing üò¨
Biden doesn‚Äôt know or can‚Äôt remember what or who he cares about these days.
I was hoping that she would give me reason to like her and so it would be less painful if biden won, but she hasn‚Äôt given me much.
Vote for Joe Biden is worse than Trump.
Especially you Mr. Biden cuz you would rather sniff them.
It is a caricature now. Anything America like, the Rep says Biden would remove. Meat, apple pie, football, jobs, BBQ, cars, teddy bears, diet soda, grandmas...ANYTHING. Basically it is TRUMP or TOTAL APOCALYPSE.
Yes he does but never held accountable. I hope after Biden-Harris are elected they convict him &amp; all his friends he let out of jail.
I live in Utah, so my ballot for Biden is going in a ballot lock box.
This conservative "#Suburbanhousewife üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èwill be voting for Biden/Harris even if I don't agree with all their policies because at least they have ethics. Our democracy can't endure another 4 years of Trump authoritarianism. #LincolnVoter #BidenWarren2020 #utpol #LDSforbiden

Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate
Thank you fellow resisters. I appreciate fhe follows. We need to stick together and make sure we put Biden and Harris in office. Otherwise we can kiss our asses goodbye!!! Thanks again.
I‚Äôm not sure that is accurate, but he HAS been on the side of most bad ones. Joe Biden‚Äôs 1994 crime bill has incarcerated more Black men than any single othe factor. Could‚Äôve reversed it as VP under Obama. Nope.
I am patiently awaiting your tweet regarding the way Joe Biden mispronounced his own running mate, I'm wondering if it was intentional by Biden as well?
No, being handsy and sniffing hair is not the same as admitting you think it‚Äôs okay to grab women by the pussy. Who are the white supremicists supporting? thousands if not millions of white supremacists are Trump supporters. Find me one single white supremacist Biden supporter.

Joe Biden does not support killing babies or satanism. That is 100% fact. It really is cut and dry this election, either you‚Äôre an intelligent person or not. If a religion is making you believe Biden kills babies, it‚Äôs not a good religion.

I voted for McMuffin in 2016 and will vote for Joe Biden in 2020. I still think teasing Biden about his hair sniffing and children on lap is funny. He‚Äôs Creepy Uncle Joe, every LDS ward has one or two of these close talking handsy older guys.
Absentee vs mail in voting  Lets make it simple Biden sends out campain flyers to every one in the country half the people have zero interest. Now if a quarter of his supporters ask for a campain flyer an he sends one to them then 100% of interest.   DIFFERENT
Trump will make the stock market crash if he loses in November, and blame it on Biden.

I am part of the older generation living in suburbs voting Biden Harris. My daughter is a suburban housewife voting Biden Harris for sure! My other daughter is also but she lives in rural Montana!
Here's my question: let's say Biden gets impeached. Can you honestly tell me that a Democratic-controlled Senate wouldn't behave the exact same way the Republican-held Senate did in Trump's impeachment?  Don't project virtue upon the Democrats that they don't have.
Look at that Biden strength, I bet he can drink water with one hand and walk down a ramp.
Hey  and  you might want to cover up, your bias is showing. I‚Äôve never had a tweet from Joe Biden or Kamala Harris show up on my timeline until yesterday. Now they‚Äôre all over it.
Calling someone racist who you know isn't racist is wicked. Harris did that to Biden, and she's about to do it to Pence.
I have supported many women along the way too. I just think you need to open your eyes about Kamala. She called Biden a racist. Was that true? If not it was wicked. She's ruthless. You'll see.
I love the smell of desperation in the morning!  Smells like Biden/Harris landslide!
Dear People Who Write Joe Biden's Tweets: This is a lie. It was very clearly proven to be a lie. And only people who live in a self imposed bubble aren't aware of it.
And those it happens to become ineffective. Biden isn‚Äôt. He has shown time again his effectiveness and longevity. This will be his grand finale.
Yeah, he tweeted about the bus system in Ogden a few months ago. I think he had a Biden moment.
Would you be outraged if he was wearing a Biden hat? Asking for a friend.
The center-right should abandon Trump wholesale. Vote for Biden, vote third-party, or leave that part of the ballot blank. But when it comes to Republicans in the Senate, vote for all but the true Trumpists.
And it‚Äôs in a state‚Äôs best interest to keep someone in the Senate. The entire body is structured around seniority. Biden‚Äôs longevity is one of the reasons he accomplished so much.
The 2020 remake of Romeo and Juliet features a man from a Trump family falling for a woman canvassing for Biden.
How far left has the Democrat‚Äôs pendulum swung if Kamala Harris and Joe Biden are considered moderate within their part?
It‚Äôs Kamala. Or Mz. Harris if you‚Äôre nasty!  Biden/Harris 2020
Imagine thinking Biden isn‚Äôt viable. Family man. Non-Ivy Leaguer. Raised, lived, and worked in blue collar America. Over 30 years of experience in DC. History of bipartisanship and ability to get things done.
Liz Warren heard Biden picked an Indian woman as his running mate and showed up at the announcement ceremony today.    Awkward!!!!     #Itcouldhappen
This Republican "suburban housewife" who lives in Utah,  will be voting for Joe Biden.
You can either be center-left or pander to the Twittergressives. Trying to do both just makes the Biden campaign look squishy.
What the Biden campaign probably THINKS it's doing is going with the safest pick that still gives a nod to the Sanders wing of the party.  But an ultra-progressive anchor is an ultra-progressive anchor, no matter how mainstream it looks.
Donald Trump is not her opponent.  Mike Pence is.   Well at least until they push Biden out but that won‚Äôt be until after the election.
Just did this and sure enough it goes directly to Joe Biden's site. WTF!!!
#Biden should make a fourth debate contingent on #Trump releasing his #taxes
Unlike yourself. However, we are all aware the Obama/Biden regime is responsible for the division. Nice try though.
There are plenty of reasons to vote for Trump and there are plenty of reasons to vote for Biden.
I think the two party system is trash and should be done away with. But it‚Äôs not, and Biden/Harris is still MILES better than 4 more years of Trump/Pence. King is swallowing his pride and getting on board. That shows some fiber, to me
He may be a hypocrite (I barely know who he is), but these screenshots aren‚Äôt examples of it. I suppose you think Bernie is a hypocrite for supporting Biden, as well? Or Hillary for supporting Obama?
I was a Warren supporter and didn‚Äôt like Biden or Harris. But now I‚Äôll enthusiastically support them, because Warren is no longer an option. That doesn‚Äôt make me a hypocrite and it doesn‚Äôt make King one either.
I don‚Äôt understand how people think this is a dunk? The first tweet was in 2018, before the campaign even started. OF COURSE he would have preferred candidates. But now that it‚Äôs set, OF COURSE he would support Biden and Harris.
Biden was just shown in a video riding a bike without a helmet on.   The precedent for his impending accident has been set.
Biden Wins Over Trump in 71 Percent Out of 40,000 Election Simulations, Forecast Shows - Newsweek  via
Column: Biden picks Kamala Harris. Trump should dump Mike Pence and replace him with a yacht.
Onboard and ready with step one: dump Trump What is step two? Biden is President - how do we have a solid conservative non-Trumpism candidate in four years?
Because Dems dislike Biden even more?
Are we deciding whether to put Cheney back in the White House, or Biden? You know, arms to ISIS and Black men to prison Biden.
I can't even imagine what they are going through considering his possible debates with Biden. Not too sure they will even happen.
I still say if Biden had wanted to win hands down, he should have gone split-ticket with Condi Rice.
Why can‚Äôt we switch it up right now and make it a Harris/Biden ticket instead of Biden/Harris?
Sure am! Better dig out the hat and shirts! Would like a new shirt tho maybe with Biden Harris design!
CNN is now pushing for Biden to step aside after he wins election. Apparently, his aides are pushing this too in his weak state. In his campaign announcement, he said she would be ready to lead the country. Hmmm.
Biden/Harris thoughts for  and
Then also google The First Step Act, a bipartisan bill signed by Trump, which begins to reverse some of the effects of Biden‚Äôs bills. Obama and Biden had EIGHT YEARS and did nothing for minorities in prison, even when the Dems held both Houses
I know, I got an actual ‚Äúburst‚Äù of euphoria when Biden announced his choice for VP!  There is so much hope for us....
The DNC's embrace of civil rights is relatively recent development &amp; one of political expediency only.  I'm still voting for Biden, but I'm not happy about it. lol
I mean If we are talking morally bankrupt I think Biden more fits the bill, corrupt as the day is long, supports abortion up to birth, the equality act (that would destroy church education) but yeah let‚Äôs not vote for the guy stopping those things... makes perfect sense
But you‚Äôre spending more time criticizing Biden and Kamala than Trump and Pence. No free pass is one thing, quite another is a circular firing squad of people with similar but not identical views sniping each other for their differences while their true enemies go unchallenged...
According to D. L. Hughley in his book Surrender, White People! Kayne is an "honorary white guy" due to hanging out with Trump &amp; spouting crazy nonsense all the time. Black folks have given him to White people. I'm not worried he's going to take any votes from Biden.
There are a lot of smart women too. He isn't fooling any of us. Biden-Harris 2020! Can't wait!

I would vote for a rock before I‚Äôd vote for Trump.  Biden and Harris will bring sanity, dignity, and humanity, back to the executive branch. I‚Äôll vote blue and continue to press for progressive policies. #BidenHarris2020
There are a handful of people I would prefer to be president over Biden/Harris. There are hundreds of millions of people I would prefer to be president over Trump. November is going to be an easy choice.
question that is all on our minds - bigger JB: Justin Bieber (2011) or Joe Biden (2020)?
With this pick, it mostly seems like Biden just gave up in the fourth quarter, which the Jazz completely understands
President Trump won't have to campaign against Biden and Harris....all of the former democratic candidates have done that already. Soooo much material out there....all from democrats!
If you vote for Biden, you‚Äôre really voting for Kamala
I think  will make a kick-ass Senate Majority Leader. It wasn't good for the country to have two very old people on the democratic ticket, so I'm all in for Biden / Harris. Glad a decision has been made.
If you think you‚Äôll see riots if Biden doesn‚Äôt win????  I promise you it will be ten fold the violence in one day then you‚Äôre seen in 70+ KAMALTOEHARIES
This is what works for them - just throw out every possible attack, even if they are conflicting. Their base will never notice, they just glom on to the part they like. It‚Äôs time for everyone to get to work to elect Biden/Harris!
I thought this was informative and funny... The funny is in the last paragraph....according to the article, Biden's cause is that he can beat Trump? What kind of a cause is that?
Thank goodness Biden‚Äôs pick has finally been announced.

If Biden wins, I bet he will resign after a year &amp; let Harris take over as president.
Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate
No opinion.  Just wish we could get rid of Biden.
give up. that was only possible with bernie. Biden has no such crossover appeal to Mexican voters.
I would like to see a Biden cabinet of predominantly female leaders.
To be Biden‚Äôs bitch I mean VP?
Also not to mention the First Step Act, a pipaerisan bill signed by Trump, which reversed part of Biden‚Äôs racist 1994 Crime bill that doubled incarceration of black men.
Not to mention ISIS, which rose under Obama and Biden backing down to Russia and Syria, was squashed in a matter of weeks under Trump
Trust me Biden will have him removed. The military is not loyal to a President if Biden says remove yam tits, yam tits will be removed.
Biden is a typical old racist that is amazed that blacks can think. He‚Äôs said Obama was the first smart black. Please someone ask Biden what he would have done better?
There's a difference between it being his house, which it isn't, and being the house he temporarily lives in. Biden owns his home. Trump DOES NOT own the White House.
I believe this would be extortion. What he thinks people are too enamored of him to notice is that those programs get funded when Biden is sworn in as president.
Donald Trump could pack $1 trillion in a suitcase and take it home when his second term is over and it would still be less costly and a better deal for America than the Green New Insanity and the Democrats  march toward socialism that would happen under Biden.
1 biden yard sign
It is interesting one Biden commercial counter his other commercial that just showed before it. I find dem ads so twisted with mistruths.
Stuck watching two back to back scripted Biden ads (studio canned edited commercials). Filled with mistruths.  Debates are NOT scripted and allow point and counter points to bring out real positions.  I would settle for a debate a day if they would shut off junk ads.
He has to get elected first and trump‚Äôs approval rating is statutory tick up....Biden needs to announce that you have been selecuas VP so we have some energy and passion in the race. Biden shows no passion and has no energy it is scary.
Biden needs to get this out exactly like you said it. Why is he not doing anything and what happened to Bloomberg I thought he was going to spend like a drunken sailor?
I drive for a living &amp; have only seen 1 Biden yard sign in my blue city
The biggest clown of 2020 award goes to, this guy. Greg Logan beat out the likes of Biden, Trump, Antifa bro‚Äôs, etc.   How can this guy say he even watches basketball with Luka, Porzingas, Lowry, Drunmond, Simmons, Whiteside, Westbrook &amp; Bam on a List before Rudy Gobert?
Sinclair story. Trump has made so many racist comments that pointing at Biden is grasping at straws
Trump is offering payday loans, but Biden will be stuck with the job of getting everybody to pay the money back.
Checks with his giant signature on them.   Just about any previous President would have been been more capable in this situation. As for Biden selling the country to China?  You know our trade deficit with them is larger now than ever. Trump personally owes China $400,000,000.00!

I agree. Trump can‚Äôt even ride a bike &amp; talk at the same time. So at least Biden has that going for him. Doesn‚Äôt change the fact Biden‚Äôs brain is still mush.

Why not forever? Why not a national speed limit of 30?  We'll save thousands of lives. Why not require us to eat 7 servings of vegetables everyday?  We'll save hundreds of thousands of lives!  Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks

The next three months are going to be hilarious watching all of the videos of past quotes by Harris and Biden üòÇ
You can bet that if Biden was predicted to slaughter Trump the way Trump is expected to destroy Biden, noone would be calling of the debates.
Weird. Ramses Cat got his ballot from Virginia today. It was even preselected for Biden to make voting easier!
No cause Biden said he would pick a woman!!!
Kamala Harris is the perfect choice. But in reality, I would still vote for Joe Biden even if he selected my granddaughter.
Kamala Harris said she believed women who accused Biden of inappropriate touching - 'I believe them, and I respect them being able to tell their story and having the courage to do it'.  #Biden #accused
Joe Biden: I've chosen Kamala Harris as my running mate.  #Biden #runningmate #KamalaHarris
I doubt she's forgotten anything, including the fact that Biden has learned from past mistakes and perfection is not required before they join forces to defeat Trump.
Biden had a wealth of good choices; he could only pick one. He did well.
So Biden‚Äòs the one who‚Äôs losing his mind, right?
Seriously.  In fact, I‚Äôd bet Biden discriminated against a bunch of eligible candidates that identify as women.
Haha. Biden has lost his marbles and they know it. This is now elder abouse.
And a grand total of zero people are surprised. What happens when Joe Biden resigns from running.
I remember when Harris threw around threats of executive orders on the national debate stage over and over again. She lost any chance at my vote there and then.   Since Biden is essentially just a corpse, voting for Biden means voting for Harris. What a scary thought.

That‚Äôs EXACTLY what the stall is‚ÄîWhen he sees he isn‚Äôt getting elected, the funds will disappear and he‚Äôll blame Biden stating that HE could‚Äôve saved us. Pathetic and infantile brainwork.
Nancy you are so smart and never lose your cool, I think that is why Republicans hate you. Keep it up, Trump is half asleep, slurring his words calling Biden Sleepy Joe, you can see that Trump is desperate
The Biden/Harris ticket is so superior to Trump/Pence. They should not even be in the same election
Which is exactly what Biden said about Universal healthcare so I‚Äôm flummoxed as to your point. Didn‚Äôt your mom ever teach you that you catch more flies with honey than vinegar? I‚Äôm about done with your veiled insults. You want to be right. I want to be effective.
USPS, step it up and get it done. be one of the hero's in this   covid season as well as the election. headline "biden/harris win in a landslide-usps delivered all ballots on time."
Exactly! If Bernie were our nominee I sure wouldn‚Äôt be demonizing him right now. This has to work so let‚Äôs roll up our sleeves and make some change!
My ex is Australian. I‚Äôm sure it isn‚Äôt perfect but it worked really well for him and his family. My parents are on Medicare and it‚Äôs far from perfect. Surely, the greatest country of all time can come up with something better.
I absolutely agree with this ‚ÄúCorporate influence doesnt belong in the platform or our  healthcare‚Äù but there is an advantage to public/private partnerships. I like Australia‚Äôs healthcare system.
It wasn‚Äôt because of media. People are scared. Stop telling people they are sheep for voting for Biden. There is no way we can go from the far right mess we are in now to a far left agenda and not terrify people. Weüëèüèªüëèüèªhaveüëèüèªüëèüèªtoüëèüèªüëèüèªcomeüëèüèªüëèüèªtogether üëèüèªüëèüèª.
If 90% wanted it then Bernie would have won the nomination.
I hope. In the meantime, a show of solidarity would come a long way in bringing the party together. It doesn‚Äôt have to mean compromising your integrity. We can still hold the moderate dems feet to the fire.
People are creatures of habit. They don‚Äôt understand this can actually be done. Let‚Äôs keep pushing Joe but not lose the majority of the democratic base by scaring them. Let‚Äôs show them how even differences won‚Äôt come between us and that we are committed to change.
And encouraging him to continue that progress into the presidency. And then showing the party that we are going to come together to make real change in this country?  It‚Äôs a missed opportunity just to posture.
This is the point. We all need to come together. Joe wasn‚Äôt my pick. But politics are designed to demonize the opponent. We have to come together. Wouldn‚Äôt it have been nice if Ro had thanked Joe for being willing to come to the table with Bernie to move the platform forward....
And clearly I‚Äôm too fired up to type - ‚Äúhactially‚Äù???
This doesn‚Äôt do that. It doesn‚Äôt incentivize Joe. Sitting down and coming up with the best plan to move the country that direction does. I want universal health care. I work in public health. I lost my 39 year old brother to cancer last year. He had no insurance which delayed tx
Joe is a good person and hactially has a verifiable history of implementing policy change. We don‚Äôt come together by purity bashing.
Biden could run on a platform to dismantle the USPS and Democrats would fall in line and try to justify it just because he isn't Trump.  Change my mind.
Which Biden has adopted much of.... so what is the purpose of this? Nothing except to showboat. It doesn‚Äôt change one thing except give the GOP talking points about infighting.
Perhaps he should listen to his idol. Huh? Talk about insufferable.
I remember you calling someone a "petulant child" because they indicated they won't be voting for Biden.  Pot, meet kettle.
Why should I talk about Trump if we both know how bad he is?  You seem to be stuck under the illusion that Biden is not also a White supremacist corporte extremist. He already promised nothing will fundamentally change and that he will go after "anarchists."
Okay. So the words and actions of the DNC are lockstep with the GOP, and Biden is a right-wing corporate extremist. And you are just gunna go along with it and tell the rest of us to lick the boot with you.  No. Thanks.
While ignoring, entirely, that Biden will perpetuate the Oligarchy and trying to sell him as the most progressive candidate in history (hahahahaha no)  Maybe try being honest.
Its time to replace the traitorist fake Republicans with real Republicans. Non-sychophants to Trump. I'm voting for Biden just to get that traitor out.

If not voting for Biden is a vote for Trump, then not voting for Trump is a vote for Biden. Therefore, based on this logic, a leftist who votes 3rd Party or independent is an ultra-powerful supervoter with 3 times the voting ability. See how that works?  #KHive #BidenHarris2020

Hearing he is going to prosecute Former President Obama and Former Vice President Biden and Obama for treason for spying on him...
If Biden gets to control his presidency, then it may not go too far left.  I'm not sure how much control he will have
I think if Biden is President like he was a Senator, he will be left/center one.  I don't know if that's the case.  Harris was the 4th most liberal Senator with her voting record. So if she's moderate for the party...then that says something too.
She's even got the "centrist" Biden saying planes will be off fossil fuels in 5 years.  (Incidentially, I think they have the technology to do this already, because they know they have to do it eventually...probably actually not the worst thing in the world)
Even though she's the one setting the party agenda (seriously), the party doesn't want her as visible to the public.  They are framing Biden/Harris as "moderate", when the definition of moderate for progressives seems to mean anything right of Bernie Sanders.
Other. I‚Äôm not voting for either Biden or Trump. I‚Äôll likely go third party or write in. Unsure of who as of now. I refuse to pick for the lesser of two evils and the only way to make a third option viable down the road is to start voting for them now.
Friendly reminder that Biden‚Äôs entire reason for opposing #M4A is literally ‚Äúmy family is rich and we still faced hardship so fuck the poors‚Äù
No, but I'd wait 8 hours in line to keep Biden out.
No. There are plenty of reasons Harris and Biden are awful without resorting to this shit.
Harris just showed why Biden chose her
Well, maybe if you manned up and stayed in the running things could have been different. No one wants Joe Biden.
Let‚Äôs put it this way, I see about 8 or 9 KAG, MAGA and Gadsden flags before I even leave my neighborhood every morning. I‚Äôve seen a grand total of one Biden sign and one Biden bumper sticker in the whole county.
That‚Äôs silly that‚Äôs Joe Biden and his bladder control issue.
Dude voting for Biden/Harris isn‚Äôt about fixing every problem the Trump administration caused. It‚Äôs literally about getting them out of office. That‚Äôs the FIRST step and the ONLY way we can even BEGIN to clean this gd mess up.
I am hoping that he gets beaten so bad that he cant claim he actually won probably about 75% of the vote going to Biden
things that have made me cry today-  3 different tiktoks  The 2nd page of a book I started reading  And a video of Joe Biden where you can see that he has a heart emoji next to his wife‚Äôs name in his phone

Absolutely! If anything, the blame is on the DNC for splitting the left vote. Most of the left was NEVER going to vote Biden or Harris, regardless. Bernie was the compromise for many on the left.
Ok never mind, i figured it out.... But dont get your hopes up, it will never happen. Mondale chose Ferraro, McCain chose Palin and Clinton ran as a female candidate against Trump and that failed. So I highly doubt that Biden will win. Trump will be a 2 time President.
imma bring this back bc y‚Äôall workin my nerves lol just bc Biden/Harris isn‚Äôt our first choice doesn‚Äôt mean we shouldn‚Äôt vote?! Lmao y‚Äôall the same ppl that failed 16yr old me 4yrs ago by writing in harambe .

Ya trump is an asshole but the media barely even focuses on the actual shit he does wrong They care more about 2 scoops and his verbal gaffs than kids in cages because if u trace the kids in cages back just a few years you start seeing Obama and Biden‚Äôs signatures on everything
Joe Biden made the laws in California? Weird.
Everyone knows Biden is a racist
Kamala Harris and sleey Joe Biden are an improvement on Mike Pence and sleazy Don Trump-I can see the debate now and Pence had better wear dark pants, because it won‚Äôt look so bad when he pees his pants
I'll go with Jill Biden
If you‚Äôre voting based on qualifications alone you should absolutely vote for Biden/Harris over Trump/Pence.
This is what cracks me up about Rs on my timeline freaking out over Biden, and now Harris. They're like the two most centrist candidates of the bunch, not named Bloomberg.

Kamala Harris, a cop, is now Biden‚Äôs running mate... she called him racist... but now it‚Äôs all good? Dems and republicans both fucking crash.
Kamala Harris prosecuted over 1,500 people for possessing marijuana as attorney general in California. She also seems to have flip flopped on her previous accusations of Biden being racist. She is running with the man who supported the 1994 crime bill...
The dichotomy between leftists and liberals in my circle on the Biden pick is stark:   Liberals: I love this ticket! Let's beat Trump!   Leftists: Hahahahahahahaha
It really makes very little difference. Trump and Pence are ogres. Biden and Harris will smile nicely as they fuck you over. They're all cut from the same cloth, and none of them will be running the country anyway.
That's of little comfort to the millions Biden and the cop will continue to fuck over.
Biden/Harris....I think it's a win..
I think this VP pick hurts Biden quite a bit.  Not enough to lose the election, but he had better options.
Mmmmm Joe ‚ÄúCrime Bill‚Äù Biden and Kamala ‚ÄúThe Cop‚Äù Harris. Now that‚Äôs a dynamic duo of #resistance! üìé
I am offended: Trump thinks that men are upset because Joe Biden is selecting a woman, for Vice President. there are many good men that joe could have picked but the women on the list are all more qualified than them. I think all women should be upset about this
I agree. I also see why they‚Äôre having him speak: it‚Äôs not like Biden has ever been one to buck tradition.
Politics and culture in this era: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and The Making of the President 1972:
Biden has three things going for him:   1. He‚Äôs not Trump. 2. He hung out with Obama for eight years.  3. Coronavirus, major unrest, and Trump being Trump keeps the focus off him, potentially making ‚Äúrunning out the clock‚Äù to Election Day a viable strategy.
If the GOP was running practically ANYONE else I‚Äôd be all in. Romney, Rubio, heck, even Pence would be fine, because it‚Äôs just unimaginable to me that anyone would think Biden would be a great President. Sorry.
Whooooo! Biden-Imminent 2020!
I will vote for  Biden. PERIOD!!
Joe Biden disqualify him for the White House so we can keep President Trump for 4 more years
The implication of your statement is that Biden couldn't/wouldn't govern with people who attacked him or tried to upstage him. I sure hope that's not true.

1. A 7-point Biden lead would be some tightening. 2. 9% undecided/other seems high for this race. 3. The other results in here do not imply that much if any of that 9% will break for Trump.

.....Joe Biden actually wrote the crime bill that allowed mandatory minimums &amp; the 3 strikes rule. He even said out of his own mouth that, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care about the conditions that created them all I want is these super predators odd the street‚Äù
Despicable.   Will not be voting Biden/Harris
It's well known that people will accuse others of things that they themselves are guilty of. He has brought our country to this point with his lack of leadership and his stupidity. So he accuses Biden of poor leadership skills and poor mental capacity. He fools no one. He's out!
I‚Äôm positive that 94‚Äô crime bill . wrote has done more harm to the black community than any conspiracy especially when u take into account Biden worked with segregationists to lock up minorities with tough on crime policies and mandatory minimum legislation
Krystal at this point is a grifter. She has nothing new to offer expect "Biden bad". Her job is to constantly feed her audience the same steady diet that fuels their anger and disgust in the primary outcome while giving ammunition to Trump sympathizers to use against Biden.
I'm kind of surprised that the Republicans' attempt at Othering yet another black opponent is not reportable as an in-kind contribution to the Biden campaign.

Tell us now if Biden plans to raise Americans taxes? I don't know how it works in Canada, but I'm paying enough already without supporting the D's socialistic policy proposals for America.

Tell us how Biden/Harris are going to help?
Well I'm hopping china blocks Russia out and helps joe Biden win win win because I still really think trump start this virus thinking it would save him to stay president then it got out of control and he and his family did not know how to stop it that's why he does not want to

That's what Joe Biden has said. Is there anyone out there who thinks that they're taxed too little?
I told you Joe Biden is the modern day Harry Anslinger he has been since the 80s when he introduced Billie Holliday type legislation tough on addicts and the pushers just like Anslingers racist crusade but this time all minorities where Billie Holliday and whites got a taste too

I'll admit, still better than Trump in the GOP. But like I've said over and over and over and over and over again, it's like having to choose between herpes and full-blown AIDS. Trump and GOP = full-blown aids. Biden/Harris is like herpes, manageable
How about this for a Biden/Harris campaign slogan - "we want to bring back the status quo, we must maintain the status quo, for the greater good"

My intuition is that this is a three coin-flip race. Biden's lead has been stable, moving within a fairly narrow range. At the low end, Trump still needs a polling error in his favor to have a 50-50 chance. At the high end, he's toast. Three coin-flips instead of two. 88% Biden.
Biden should win.  Trump's chance of winning is not frivolous.

Haha just know Biden supporters will be treated like trump supporters from now on lmfao
I do not, that's one of Trumps worst decisions. But hear you me our troop presence around the world will increase dramatically under Biden. And the Venezuela coup will happen where Trump failed, and a hot war with Iran isn't out of the question
Current Indian government will not like Biden government. They better start praying for his defeat
Psychopathic Sadist??? Look, being hyperbolic to the point of utter stupidity is a symptom of TDS. OBiden had the House, Senate, and presidency and gave us shit Obamacare. 50,000 people a year die because they have no healthcare. So yeah, go vote for Biden
Oh, is she having trouble deciding between Biden and Trump?  Makes sense now.
Lots of polling showed Democrats were really worried about a safe, electable pick. Many of the rank-and-file were leery (and there‚Äôs a lot of problematic stuff tied up in that) of a black woman at the top of the ticket.   With Biden anchoring the ticket those concerns went away.
It felt like there was a little veiled misogyny in the field as folks easily dismissed huge flaws in Biden and Bernie, but cancelled Harris and Klobuchar for being mean and Warren for being...uhh...prepared
Mentioning Biden's memory while supporting/believing tRump is capable of anything besides...  *160,000+ dead Americans  *Record numbers or UNEMPLOYED Americans  *Caged Children *Grifting, Lying &amp; Conning at every opportunity
Because she was getting crushed in the polls despite utterly mud-hole stomping everyone in the debates.  I think the Dem Primary was funny because they'd fail to vote for candidates and then lament them when they suspended. Then voted for Biden and now grump about him constantly
If Trump supporters are racist by association what does that make . supporters? This man considered Storm Thurmond(a racist, segregationist) a friend of his smfh and Biden sees nothing wrong with working with racists he‚Äôs proud of it....

The choices are clear Trump/Pence or Biden/Harris. You can either choose to cry on the sidelines because you didn't get your perfect birthday present or choose a side. If you decide not to participate, you cant complain about the what happens in the next 4 years.
I love Biden's ability to stay on topic and not get sucked into culture wars and mundane debates about Kamala's racial heritage.
So you are already handicapping Biden's demise? What???!! Why didn't Democrats just choose Harris at the beginning?
You can stand by you decision and not vote for Biden but know this: Your big system-wide change may never occur and the things you want to see may have to come in steps. You can be making a difference now instead of waiting for the the climate to be right.

This is why Biden picked her. Trump can't figure out how to attack this ticket at all. You can't call Biden anti police with an Attorney General on the ticket
Biden didnt pull a John McCain and pick Sarah Palin, Kamala Harris is ACTUALLY qualified. Even if Biden didn't commit to picking a woman VP, she was the best choice out of everyone that ran this cycle for the VP slot.
If Bernie Sanders supporters were the base, Bernie wouldve won the nomination. Black women are the democratic base, Biden would have been crazy to not pick a black woman in acknowledgement of that. As a man with sisters who I want to see do well, this is a great day.
Imagine being a black man not voting for Biden because he picked a black woman with a white husband. Childish irrelevant mufuckas

BSOTA: The hosts discuss postponing collegiate football and Utah's daily case count dropping below 350/day. In the national scene, perspectives clash on Sen. Harris earning Joe Biden's VP nomination and POTUS's unconstitutional use of executive orders.
As I am fully aware that the vote will go to waste if I don‚Äôt vote Biden. It is illogical to vote for anyone else‚Äôs knowing it will go to trump.
It‚Äôs a very clear choice for me. Either vote my conscience and have it go to trump or vote Biden. So in my mind either I am voting for change or not voting for change. Biden will bring about better change than trump will. My humanitarian conscience won‚Äôt let me vote for green...
I know that my vote for any1else won‚Äôt count right now. It‚Äôs simple math in my eyes. We can vote our conscience but it just ends up going to trump. Knowing that I cant vote for anyone other than Biden. 2024 election is the time to put our middle finger up and show them we r done
I apologize for not recognizing you. üò¢ I didn‚Äôt mean to disrespect you&amp;understand why you said what you said. I just hope between now and then you may see that if we don‚Äôt vote for biden we will essentially vote for trump. I know it sucks, but I can‚Äôt see a way around it.
Yes. And they are starting in on  and  now. Right wing pundits like  demanding that Biden hold weekly news conferences.
I will say this though hun. This election is a hard one. Simply because of the fact that a vote for anyone else is a vote for trump. He‚Äôs a wicked wicked man who is destroying our environment and our freedoms. I can‚Äôt in good conscience vote for anyone other than Biden.
You may be on to something here.

Not really. Someone who strives for certain values, even if they personally fall short, is preferable to someone motivated by self-interest and pride. Clinton versus Bush and Dole were much closer choices than Tr*mp versus Biden, the subject of my original tweet. Tr*mp is awful.
Yes. These are ideals we should strive for. I think Biden strives for them, even if he sometimes falls short. I do not think Tr*mp strives for them. At least, I see little evidence of it.

USPS is 3rd largest employer in the USA....their union endorsed Biden....shows a conflict of interest....should not be allowed to collect/transmit junk mail-in ballots to support the democrats voting fraud scheme....

Why is nobody is talking about how Joe Biden is ALSO descended from slavers?   They both support #Reparations, which means they both want others to be held accountable for the sins of their ancestors.   But then simultaneously, they don't want to be held accountable themselves.

How to get your Grandparents to vote for Biden: Call them up and ask if they got the card you sent (you didn't send one)  When they say no, let them know it must've got lost in the mail because Trump is taking USPS away but you hope Biden wins so you can keep sending them cards.
I registered Republican for the first time in my life, this was going to be my first vote and for you, but now I'm voting Biden cause of what your doing to the postal service, sorry, should have thought it through BIDEN 2020!

Vaush, you speak so matter of factly that Biden will concede and buckle under pressure from the left when concessions and rhetoric can and will be easily walked back.. as history shows.
Is that your entire list of things you love about Biden/Harris?
My father in law said that if Biden gets in they will take all of our private land.
...or more to the point, you've done more TO women and none of it good, you dirty old man. Get out of DC! Vote Biden and Harris!
Why is Xi standing next to trump when he wants Biden? Are you really that slow?
Uknow voting fraud system is set2roll....the postal union endorses Biden....postal workers have access to the ballots....good enough to remove ballot access from USPS....a clear conflict of interest...saying postal workers I've talked to are vehemently anti-trump not vilification
we know police are very pro-Trump.....I'm sure from my interaction with postal workers you will find they support anti-Trump or Biden just as much......it doesn't take a majority to do voter fraud....pro-Biden have dominance and access...needs to be taken out of hands of USPS
A) I don't think VP sways votes anyway and B) I don't think there was anyone Biden could pick that would sway a 2020 Trump voter
will Trump debate himself when Biden refuses to show?
Biden isn‚Äôt even good enough for his own hashtag. You have to put Harris on there, he has already lost. ü§£ü§£ü§£
wonderful...yet we hear the postal workers endorsed Biden...those thru whose hand the ballots are allowed to flow...now that's some conflict...very dangerous
There is not one Democrat I know of (correct if I am wrong) that if for any restrictions on abortion.  Which includes biden and Harris of course. The open encouragement of abortion as birth control bothers me even past a religious aspect cause let‚Äôs be real I am bad Mormon
You have made one choice you regret. I regret voting 3rd party last time. It was a waste of my voice. Try option 3, vote Biden-Harris, and see if actual Republicans become a thing again under Biden. They won't under Trump. Check out  ,  ,
Absolutely not. I never voted for Trump before. I don‚Äôt think I will this time. I want to vote for Biden but abortion is a topic that sways me yes.
How do you rationalize abortion when voting for Biden?
For LDS people who support Biden, I genuinely and in the most sincere way want to know how your rationalize the abortion issue?  Pls no hate tweets or disagreements. State your case and I will stay out of it unless asked a question
How can you possibly call out Biden on Tara Reade without acknowledging these women?
If you go to his website he has policy proposals bur I have no idea if he is serious about implementing them.  Like Bernie I knew was passionate about Healthcare, Julian Immigration, Elizabeth Wallstreet reform, Tulsi Foreign policy. Biden no idea.
This is funny. I could absolutely see Biden asking this question when reading about #trumpGoldenShower lmao
Reasons why I should actually vote for Joe Biden when he is less than 1% likely to win UT and also I want to bolster third parties READY GO
I have never suggested  Biden is not flawed. He wasn‚Äôt my 1st or 2nd choice. But in our system it is him or Trump and, though imperfect, he is orders of magnitutude better than Trump.
And I'll vote by mail, as I've been doing in Utah for well over a decade, for Biden/Harris, and will know my vote will be counted and not changed because of the plethora of evidence that shows that doesn't actually happen.
It‚Äôs the WORST lol. Like, yeah karen I get it you *really* want me to vote for Biden, but I have a candidate this time that I actually agree with and like, so I find it more important I vote who I want to support lol.

I tried to keep my mouth shut around my more centrist elders re: the election but they kept hounding me. So I told them straight. that I don‚Äôt think biden will win. When I tell you they would rather blame me if that happens rather than idk...a white supremacist government...üòë

We know we have to create change from the local level but that takes time. So it would seem like Biden is the obvious answer.... but idkkkkkk.
I am so glad to see this. Is Obama even able to be his biden‚Äô lol wouldn‚Äôt that be amazing
Yeap unfortunately. I don't remember the last time our country was in such desolate and separatist state. I'm not necessarily pro-Trump, but I think that a Biden presidency will worsen the crime rates, homelessness, and lawlessness in general.
If this was a voter suppression conspiracy, why would they be warning people of a potential problem?  It also assumes that the mail-in votes will favor Biden.  What is the evidence?  Mailed ballots were already a problem in the primaries.  I smell a hoax.
I know the definition. That's my point. It still doesn't say "Biden is a tyrant". It says a cruel, oppressive ruler is a tyrant. It's very generalized and subjective. So if someone thought Trump was cruel and oppressive, then he is by definition a tyrant.
What‚Äôs Biden‚Äôs favorite cum town bit?
Has Biden or Obama done anything like this?
It was only political in pointing out the problem with the term "tyrant" because anyone can use that to justify their crime.   "I don't like Trump, he's a tyrant." Or "I don't like Biden, he's a tyrant."   What constitutes a tyrant that gives someone the right to then shoot them?

HUGE: Joe Biden Alienated Black Voters by Choosing Kamala Harris

If you want me to fight for you, things have to get a little better. They won‚Äôt be all the way better by a long shot. But still. I know that we can‚Äôt trust this ticket to solve real, huge problems. Biden and Harris leave a LOT to be desired.

My biggest issue with the movement. I supported him because at least he was proposing progressive bills with Kamala and Markey. I‚Äôll vote for Biden to fight facism and harm reduction. But I also have faith in Kamala‚Äôs senate record to move Biden left. We aren‚Äôt all that naive.
I‚Äôm pragmatically voting for Biden-Harris for many reasons, but would really have preferred voting for someone without questions about their conduct toward women. You should be free to voice your valid concerns about him. Protecting freedom of speech is one reason he has my vote.
Biden isn‚Äôt proposing universal healthcare either. That‚Äôs the issue. The public option will still leave millions uninsured

This claim of a "Trump Bump" is nonsense. Strong economy was built from 2011 to 2017, trump maintained for  few years then ran the ship aground. Biden will have to clean up his mess.
Difference, Biden's were dropped. Not enough credible evidence. Trump's were settled, with children no less.
Oh sweets,  how vacant your mind must be to surpport Biden.    Been in Goverment for 48 years and his only accomplishment is enriching his family.  Don‚Äôt even get me started on Harris.
Ignore this. Pretend it‚Äôs Biden/Harris at 34%. The US can‚Äôt afford another 4 years of this guy.
In such a time where violence towards Americans is decried, looking at the record of Harris &amp; Biden, one should be appalled. Harris keeping innocent people in prison &amp; other crimes should be shown on corporate media, yet its not. Government should NOT be allowed to commit crimes.
Also weird to think Biden/Harris wouldn't be anti-sex trafficking, since Harris practically wrote the book on fighting sex trafficking.
Also a weird flex to call the guy who started his term with a Muslim ban, &amp; apparently gave his approval to Pres Xi to go ahead with his Uighur Muslim concentration camps, as being for religious freedom. And Biden, who is a faithful Catholic and regularly attends, isn't pro-God?
I definitely follow politics.  I‚Äôm just not brainwashed and deluded.  But since you seem to think Biden Who is deeply religious is anti religion you must not follow politics very closely.
If there was anyone but Donald on their ticket they‚Äôd be attacking Biden/Harris with razor blade precision.
Don't expect any media coverage for this, but the lady who is running against Biden/Trump 2020 posted this:
The church isn't supposed to endorse politicians, so in a way, yes. That's part of my problem with this misappropriation.  Also, an independent evaluation has found Obama/Biden WH told 18 verifiable lies in their 8 years. Trump has told +20,000 so far in his 3.5 yrs.
Listen to the words coming out of Biden's mouth...,
Yep. Also it's a weird flex to say Trump, the dude who had at least 8 extramarital pregnancies ended with abortions, is "the most pro-life." When Biden/Obama literally oversaw one of the greatest declines in abortion rates in 30 years because they made birth control available.
People who live in a swing state/more competitive state should absolutely vote Biden. But I don't think we should urge people to vote blue no matter what in non-competitive states.
The problem is I don't see how we ever break the cycle. Say Biden wins on fear of Trump. The next election, the party and voters become complacent, some other right-wing nutbag wins a surprise victory, and we're right back where we started.
By reminding us of the fact that just a couple of months ago she mentioned that she believed Tara Reade‚Äôs allegations that Joe Biden sexually assaulted her. That will get the media off of the story that I called  a segregation sympathizing racist.

Lets get some activism then. But that is still no comparison to Trump who currently uses a man on his legal council that defended Epstein and that same lawyer raped an underage girl that was trafficked to him by Epstein.  Biden is better than Trump. Period.
Trump admits he's blocking postal cash to stop mail-in voting. For Democrats, Trump‚Äôs new remarks were a clear admission that the president is attempting to restrict voting rights. Biden said it was ‚ÄúPure Trump. He doesn‚Äôt want an election.‚Äù Trump=dictator!
See Biden as a "bridge" to a better future.
Trump admits he's blocking postal cash to stop mail-in votes, including the false claim that Democrats are seeking universal mail-in voting, specifically to gain an advantage in his November matchup against Joe Biden. EVIL MAN AND WANNABE DICTATOR!

I would offer this counterpoint. The fact that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris is the DNC ticket is a far cry from accepting anarchists overtaking city blocks into the fold.
My issue is with understanding what their goal is. I've gotten a couple people to talk to me about it. It seems that for a lot of people, Biden having been accused of rape is a bridge too far. Harris' record with trans rights and hanging with CBP and ICE in general has them cold.

Biden, Seizing on Masks as a Campaign Issue, Calls for a Mandate
I'm to the point of just removing people from my life who tell me Trans Lives aren't enoigh of a reason to vote for Biden/Harris.  My life is all I have. Its plenty of enough reason.
mail in fraud easy with mail in vote......Biden's only hope
Utah Republican Stuart Reid is voting Biden-Harris. "I cast my vote to preserve the wellbeing of the nation if not its very survival first and foremost."   Utahns and Republicans take note. This country burns down with Tr*mp. He deserves no votes.  #VoteBidenHarrisToSaveAmerica
Bunker Donny hasn't done $hit for Indians in the US or India as a country. He lied about Modi asking him to mediate on Kashmir issue. We'll know no Indian PM wont do a stupid mistake like that. Bunker Donny is dangerous for Indians and India. Vote Biden/Kamala. #s386
Half my social circle thinks that Biden/Harris aren't far enough left and the other half thinks that Biden/Harris will turn this country into the U.S.S.A.
I can‚Äôt believe that Sleepy Joe has picked Kamala Harris as his running mate. This lady is one mean, vicious bitch. One who only got maybe 2%of the votes when she ran for president. Now she‚Äôs on the ticket. And Biden says she has to be ready to take over on day one. Are you (1)
No, Biden is a religious person. None of his policies will erode religious freedoms. Stop the scare tactics.
The Alt-left, like the Squad fall for &amp; spread Russian propaganda. They like rest of Sanders &amp; Warren's cult is a disgrace &amp; embarrassment. They sand in the of real Democrats &amp; progress. Biden &amp; Hsrris are the change America needs
How ironic is Trump‚Äôs use of a train given that Biden famously commutes by Amtrak from Delaware while in congress and has consistently advocated for more funding for rail service?
Part of the reason Biden polls well is because people won‚Äôt admit that they will vote for Trump. We need to work hard to get folks registered to vote and support them with a voting plan. Check out:
If the conservative movement is continually being defined by voting for the lesser of two evils it will never stand for its principles.  The most adamant never Trumpers I've seen pushing for Biden previously voted Trump to stop Clinton. Compromise creep.
Are you that dense?  He has done nothing illegal.  All you corrupt Dems have tried and tried to pin something on him but he is clean.  Check your peeps.  Biden is under investigation by the Ukraine.. but I‚Äôm sure you don‚Äôt care.
We both know that you don't believe that. Biden is lost mentally; he is a racist and pedophile
Yeah watch this actually be pretty spot on in a few months or a year or two lol
thank you very much for putting no effort or critical thinking into your  you realize what a corrupt lifetime politician Joe Biden is? It is so scary that people like you, lazy, low IQ partisan hacks get to vote.
Big ups to Bron Bron for helping that happen! But California was already going Biden‚Äôs way. No Republican has won CA in how long?  let‚Äôs make this happen in MS, NC, MI, WI, all over the the Central US and the South where the black vote is more easily suppressed.
Biden is not against religious freedom. He is not opposed to you practicing your religion; he is opposed to people using their faith to discriminate against other groups. Trump says he is against abortion but that's it. He has said it, but he has done nothing about it.
You mean if I vote for biden it will turn the red state I live in blue? Didn‚Äôt know my little vote had so much power!I don‚Äôt have an issue with the group calling themselves LDS for Trump or LDS for Biden. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs appropriate to be using the temple as their background and symbol.
HOT AIR BLOWING FOR DEMS! Any real true-blooded American would be ashamed to say they're a Democrat. SPINELESS JOE won't &amp; take questions instead he runs &amp; hides. We know he can't CONFRONT PUTIN! BHO/BIDEN appeased PUTIN  WE KNOW HE KOWTOWS w/ CHINA B/C HE OWES THEM FAVORS!
And if the point is to say that Biden staffers are afraid of Biden showing cognitive decline by going off message with unscripted answers, let's not forget that the Spanish Flu ended WW2, LOL.
I have my Biden stickers on their way. I need to get over to my DNC office and get signs and whatever else.

Leadership?  No, Biden means Dictatorship!!!
It's a personal choice how anyone in the Church wants to vote. Both Trump and Biden are morally flawed and how you choose to equate if one is more flawed than the other is also a matter of personal opinion. How the two will govern in office is very easy to see

i dont think this is what you actually want. because guess what. voting 3p doesn't make trump number go up, thus he has the same standing vs biden. voting trump does make the number go up and he has a better standing than before. youre digging yourself in to a hole buddy
Biden's best category is "not being trump." I think that speaks to how Biden doesn't have a specific mandate.   Also speaks to how Trump is not liked in some circles.   Thoughts?
My main man  Would be younger than Biden is now in 4 years.

A national pandemic! Biden wants us to wear a mask when we're outside? OUTSIDE! Inside if we can't social distance, but not outside! Science doesn't support his insanity! Science requires a mental test for   He's pathetic!
Just had to read ADJUNCT professor &amp; its evident where the LOW IQ comment came from!  IT MUST REALLY SUCK 2B A STUPID DEMOCRAT!  A vote for Biden is more corruption from the party who has committed Treasonous acts, fraud, QUID PRO QUO'S &amp; lied to American's for 4yrs!
want's us to wear masks when were outside!! DUH!  SCIENTISTS &amp; FAUCI SAY WHEN WERE INSIDE AROUND OTHERS!  BIDEN MAKES NOISE BUT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE!  DEMS LOVE LOW IQ VOTERS SO  DOESN'T LOOK SO BAD!
wants American's 2 wear masks when OUTSIDE! Why OUTSIDE?  Biden opens mouth 2 make noise, but doesn't know what he's talking abt! The FAKE NEWS keeps coddling incompetent   We still don't know where is HUNTER?  It's time  answers questions?

So Biden‚Äôs campaign team wakes up each morning and says ‚Äúwhat the hell‚Äù right?
Trump would desperately love to make the media cycle about how desperate the Democrats are because of the new hoax of an impeachment witchhunt. Right now the entire focus needs to be on Biden v Trump. Even a morally correct impeachment would hurt right now. /2
Possibly because it gives Trump yet another vector to distract on. "Oh look, they know they can't win so they're going to try and impeach me again. Witch hunt, hoax, blah blah blah." Nancy wants this to be about Biden and Trump. Not impeaching keeps the focus on the election.
Biden cares
If there are no questions from the press, it is NOT a "press conference." Biden/Harris made a public statement. They did not submit to a press conference.
The difference is that Biden isn't saying anything.
Your going to have a tough road ahead, Joe Biden cannot even finish a complete thought. It‚Äôs sad to watch him. If he was in my family it would break my heart. I say let him enjoy his senior years.
The best part about this statement is that it isn't enough 2 vote for Biden &amp; K, you also cannot criticize them... Holding them accountable is getting off to a GREAT START!
45k people die every year caused by lack of healthcare but nobody can criticize Kamala &amp; Biden even though they do not support M4A and Biden says HE WOULD VETO IT IF PASSED and Biden was the top recipient of pharma dollars in the D primary! V cool Ava!
Yes, ambassador to the Vatican is a known path to billions and endless power. Guessing you could care less about those foreign companies enriching the Biden's via Hinter, though?
It's quite phony to both say you believe Biden's sexual assault accusers, what happened to that story, and accuse him of racism only to later happily accept his offer to run with him. If not phony, what would you call it?
All this disingenuous framing of Biden as a leftist makes me wish we had actually chosen a leftist
Biden mispronounced it, as well. So have countless others. Why is your outrage targeted at only a single conservative?
You‚Äôre deliberately conflating approval ratings with primary choice (a huge chunk of which was for Biden). This is intellectually dishonest.
when people say they‚Äôre voting for trump because they care about their freedom and they think that Biden is a socialist... its because they‚Äôre afraid of their white cis privilege not mattering as much anymore.

Best part about Biden‚Äôs announcement .   He doesn‚Äôt say her name correctly, not just once, but many many times!! Classic
What was it all about when Joe Biden mispronounced her name? Please enlighten us.
In case you missed the headline. You have 4 choices Trump, Biden, Third party that is late to the game and no one knows and will only be in a handful of states (waste of time) or sit it out. If you're a democrat then get on board. We don't all agree on everything.
the difference is all the teams against team bernie played it out when playing against him. they surrendered and left the conference when they played against team biden.
Rethinking how to setup presidential debates is long overdue. We can do better.
Biden has said basically the same thing
Wow Biden is not corrupt. How are you tweeting under that rock?

oh wait was that where the joe biden rest stop is LMAO
Will Kamala Harris make a full commitment to running as Joe Biden's VP and resign her Senate seat as proof of her seriousness, or muh?
Well, because Biden said his main qualifications for a running mate was race and gender. Like her or not, it's been openly stated why she was picked.
Biden is the radical left?! HAHA. I mean, when you're as far right as you guys have gone even an independent must look radical left.

Are Biden and Obama establishment?
The bigger problem is you treating Trump like an abberation or an abnormality that will simply "go away" eventually. He has done lasting harm in both domestic and foreign policy, and those harms will be amplified if he wins. Biden and Obama suck. Trump is much worse.
Will Joe Biden denounce this, or is he willing to accept anything his supporters do in the name of social justice?
lmao at Biden supporters who think that bullying people into supporting their candidate will make leftist voters want to support him if he wants the vote from the left, he needs to earn the vote from the left; simply not being trump isn‚Äôt enough
Just a heads up, Biden has said he will veto Medicare for All if it passes. This is one of the main reasons why I have major issues with him as the nominee

Everyone knows this election will be Biden‚Äôs VP vs Trump. He had a chance to add fire to a bland campaign and some electability to his otherwise weak bid for office. He added fire, I‚Äôll give him that‚Äîbut Harris is far too controversial to be electable.
I mean, I was already going to vote Biden. But now I'm 1,000 percent on board. I love  She's going to be an excellent vice president!

alright folks does anyone actually believe that biden will undo the massive overreaches of executive power that trump caused and if so give me any reason why lol
I wouldn‚Äôt say Harris or Biden qualify as middle on police reform.   Trump will argue he has done more for reform then them, and he will have some actual points to make.   They all have invested a lot in our unbalanced justice system.
No. I'm an American. And I'm not dissenting anything. Or dividing. I'm uniting behind #BidenHarris2020  Im calling out the bot dissenters who are crying and saying they won't vote to try and sway others to do the same. Are you Voting Biden or sitting out?
Biden picking Kamala Harris only makes sense if Biden just gave up and intentionally didn‚Äôt try
Trump is the incumbent. His infidelities are well known and built into his persona. His voters know what they‚Äôre voting for and have made peace with it. Women won‚Äôt move from Trump to Biden for Harris. She is nearly as unliked as Hillary and she‚Äôs proven to be morally bankrupt.
Trump won‚Äôt have to. Willie Brown has admitted that he appointed her to high paying fast-track positions that she wasn‚Äôt qualified for simply because of their relationship. Biden has now alienated a female voter block who despise the image of women moving up from their knees.

Joe Biden selects Kamala Harris as U.S. vice-presidential running mate | CBC News
fuck joe biden fuck kamala harris and fuck trump
The Constitution is a sacred document  to me, next to the holy scriptures. I choose a presidential candidate who‚Äôll support the principles taught in it, given by the great Founders of this country.  Joseph Biden and Kamala Harris aren‚Äôt good choices.   If they win, America will
Don‚Äôt love a lot of her record as a prosecution lawyer lmfao obviously but she‚Äôs pretty much as good as we could have expected from Biden
I‚Äôm excited bc I‚Äôm def voting for Biden bc two party system &amp; Kamala is more left leaning than Biden which,, the bar is low but there u go  I also believe biden will die &amp; Harris will be the first woman president &amp; she will be unelected, a woman &amp; black which is just dope
Joe Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
Agreed. It‚Äôs wonderful. I‚Äôm even happier about the prospects of KH taking over the reins at some point. I see the Biden/Harris pairing as a competency or power equivalent of the Bush/Cheney ticket. Good news in 2020 is hard to come by, so I‚Äôll relish this until Election Day.
Joe Biden just picked for VP running mate Kamala Harris, a police officer who descended from a slave-owning plantation owner Hamilton Brown, told him to his face on a debate stage that his policies are racist  How could this possibly go wrong with today's Democrats?!
He's spent his life scamming Americans! The truth will come out b/c American's want 2 know where's Hunter &amp; his other QUID PRO QUO's! He &amp; Obama knew abt spying on opposing party!  will fileting Biden &amp; Harris! Just tell Joe it's groundhog day! Sad this is the best DEMS have!
Oh, is Kamala Harris a cop? Gee, that's too bad, I hope it doesn't alter the time-space continuum to somehow make Joe Biden worse than Trump, that seems like a real possibility now, my stars
Although I was rooting 4 Sen. Warren I'm confident in Harris, &amp; support the ticket 100%. I think Biden-Harris's going 2 kick tRump's ass &amp; I can't wait until he's shown the door. Sen. Kamala D. Harris named as Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate By Amanda Erickson
This is the one thing Biden couldn‚Äôt do. The one thing that would show the Democratic Party hasn‚Äôt learned a thing in four years. As of now this is a Trump re-election. We‚Äôll see how they play it over the next two months but honestly I‚Äôm livid.
Regardless of my varying feelings about a Biden Harris ticket, the idea of a Kamala Harris debating Mike Pence is invigorating.
Considering Biden‚Äôs health...
. trying to spread fear with his comment that we'll all have to learn Chinese if Biden wins. What about us having to learn Russian if he wins again? I mean either way the US will become bi-lingual. Silver lining?

But you don't see any value in him making a pitch for Biden to a segment of the electorate that might help Joe win?  Also, I'd really like to hear how you think he's done "immeasurable amounts of harm?"  Honestly curious.
OK, I apologize that I misread it.  I am inspired by people coming together to defeat an incompetent, immoral, and divisive president.  Kasich isn't going to talk about his ideas. He's going to make the case for Biden from his perspective; we'll see if it gets votes for Joe.
I don't think that's true.    and  are speaking the same day.  Also, did you read the joint policy recommendations from the Bernie/Biden working group?
Biden promised us a woman
OK yes Biden used the N word. 40 years ago. Why if he's so bad would a black man pick him as VP? And still endorse him now. Biden is the nominee you don't like it. Fine that's your problem. I'm committed in my vote so you are wasting your time and mine.
How is she a hypocrite? She supports Biden. And I take it your not voting. So like not voting STFU. Stay silent. A non vote is a silent voice. Everyone in politics has mud on their shoes if you look close enough.
1  a time. A book Trump read and quotes. Biden meeting Putin when VP not uncommon to shake hands. Proof that insurance companies are still fucking us. And Obama on the economy and why it's important to protect the Middle class. He did. Trump has ruined it. He's pres. 3.5 years.
Still with that shit.  Yes Biden gave support to the war in the beginning. Then he saw where it was really going and changed his mind. What do you care about human life? You support kids in cages at the border. You support suffering in South America and Central America. üñïüèª

It's almost as difficult to understand as Joe Biden speak.
The GOP wants to give bucketloads of cash to the wealthy who will hoard it. Biden wants to INVEST bucket loads of cash in the public, and when you lift the lowest level, everything above it rises. Biden's investments will return multiple times over the cost, and you KNOW it.
Trump's trillions for the rich don't benefit anyone. Not even really the rich. Biden's benefit hundreds of millions of people. Infrastructure reduces huge costs on everyone SAVING money. Child care and elder care reduce burdens on the health system saving money long run...

not about Trump or Biden. It‚Äôs about the legislation they push through. Sorry.

Biden can‚Äôt answer randonm questions.
The word ‚Äúdefund‚Äù is unfortunate because that is not really the goal. Biden stated several times that he does not support defunding police.  It‚Äôs simply a matter of deciding what reforms are needed (and where) to best protect citizens.

How did it become the Harris-Biden ticket?
I would hope that she still believes them. She can believe every word she said about Biden and still be his VP. Swallowing your pride for your country is called patriotism.
Speechless reading foolish tweets of people who I‚Äôm pretty damn certain couldn‚Äôt pass a 2nd grade civics exam. The left has lost its mind. This country will be in the toilet and on track to socialism with Biden and Harris.
The United States Postal Service Board of Governors appointed DeJoy in May. You accuse Trump of anything and everything because you are a liberal Democrat and like all the rest of the Democrat Party you know Biden doesn‚Äôt have a chance to win. #Dementia
Bulll Crap. Biden failed to give Welshman Kinnock credit during the convention speech, but was giving him credit to on previous speeches. By the way: Kinnock is supporting Biden.
Mainly because when it comes to actually lowering abortion #‚Äôs, Biden is the candidate. Access to affordable contraceptives is the single easiest way to curb abortions and Trump is against it. Plus, abortion is a legal issue, not a political one. No president can change that
Got my vote. More qualified than Trump or Biden
I am LDS and WILL NOT be voting for Trump or Biden.
Regardless of who you want to win the election, you are a moron if you preach voter turnout and then talk about how big of a landslide it‚Äôll be for Biden. The left played this game four years ago and it probably gifted trump the White House
Whatever...Seniors would be safer getting from UPS and we don‚Äôt want it saved for all those dead people , cats and dogs to vote. Why do you blame Trump when the postal service has lost money for years and years and years-including the ones Obama and Biden could have helped!

Thank you fellow resisters. I appreciate fhe follows. We need to stick together and make sure we put Biden and Harris in office. Otherwise we can kiss our asses goodbye!!! Thanks again.
I‚Äôm not sure that is accurate, but he HAS been on the side of most bad ones. Joe Biden‚Äôs 1994 crime bill has incarcerated more Black men than any single othe factor. Could‚Äôve reversed it as VP under Obama. Nope.

Trump will make the stock market crash if he loses in November, and blame it on Biden.
Here's my question: let's say Biden gets impeached. Can you honestly tell me that a Democratic-controlled Senate wouldn't behave the exact same way the Republican-held Senate did in Trump's impeachment?  Don't project virtue upon the Democrats that they don't have.
Look at that Biden strength, I bet he can drink water with one hand and walk down a ramp.
Hey  and  you might want to cover up, your bias is showing. I‚Äôve never had a tweet from Joe Biden or Kamala Harris show up on my timeline until yesterday. Now they‚Äôre all over it.
Calling someone racist who you know isn't racist is wicked. Harris did that to Biden, and she's about to do it to Pence.
I have supported many women along the way too. I just think you need to open your eyes about Kamala. She called Biden a racist. Was that true? If not it was wicked. She's ruthless. You'll see.

Yeah, he tweeted about the bus system in Ogden a few months ago. I think he had a Biden moment.
Would you be outraged if he was wearing a Biden hat? Asking for a friend.
The center-right should abandon Trump wholesale. Vote for Biden, vote third-party, or leave that part of the ballot blank. But when it comes to Republicans in the Senate, vote for all but the true Trumpists.
And it‚Äôs in a state‚Äôs best interest to keep someone in the Senate. The entire body is structured around seniority. Biden‚Äôs longevity is one of the reasons he accomplished so much.

You can either be center-left or pander to the Twittergressives. Trying to do both just makes the Biden campaign look squishy.
What the Biden campaign probably THINKS it's doing is going with the safest pick that still gives a nod to the Sanders wing of the party.  But an ultra-progressive anchor is an ultra-progressive anchor, no matter how mainstream it looks.
Donald Trump is not her opponent.  Mike Pence is.   Well at least until they push Biden out but that won‚Äôt be until after the election.

I think the two party system is trash and should be done away with. But it‚Äôs not, and Biden/Harris is still MILES better than 4 more years of Trump/Pence. King is swallowing his pride and getting on board. That shows some fiber, to me
He may be a hypocrite (I barely know who he is), but these screenshots aren‚Äôt examples of it. I suppose you think Bernie is a hypocrite for supporting Biden, as well? Or Hillary for supporting Obama?
I was a Warren supporter and didn‚Äôt like Biden or Harris. But now I‚Äôll enthusiastically support them, because Warren is no longer an option. That doesn‚Äôt make me a hypocrite and it doesn‚Äôt make King one either.
I don‚Äôt understand how people think this is a dunk? The first tweet was in 2018, before the campaign even started. OF COURSE he would have preferred candidates. But now that it‚Äôs set, OF COURSE he would support Biden and Harris.

CNN is now pushing for Biden to step aside after he wins election. Apparently, his aides are pushing this too in his weak state. In his campaign announcement, he said she would be ready to lead the country. Hmmm.

Then also google The First Step Act, a bipartisan bill signed by Trump, which begins to reverse some of the effects of Biden‚Äôs bills. Obama and Biden had EIGHT YEARS and did nothing for minorities in prison, even when the Dems held both Houses
I know, I got an actual ‚Äúburst‚Äù of euphoria when Biden announced his choice for VP!  There is so much hope for us....
The DNC's embrace of civil rights is relatively recent development &amp; one of political expediency only.  I'm still voting for Biden, but I'm not happy about it. lol
I mean If we are talking morally bankrupt I think Biden more fits the bill, corrupt as the day is long, supports abortion up to birth, the equality act (that would destroy church education) but yeah let‚Äôs not vote for the guy stopping those things... makes perfect sense
But you‚Äôre spending more time criticizing Biden and Kamala than Trump and Pence. No free pass is one thing, quite another is a circular firing squad of people with similar but not identical views sniping each other for their differences while their true enemies go unchallenged...
According to D. L. Hughley in his book Surrender, White People! Kayne is an "honorary white guy" due to hanging out with Trump &amp; spouting crazy nonsense all the time. Black folks have given him to White people. I'm not worried he's going to take any votes from Biden.

Not to mention ISIS, which rose under Obama and Biden backing down to Russia and Syria, was squashed in a matter of weeks under Trump
Trust me Biden will have him removed. The military is not loyal to a President if Biden says remove yam tits, yam tits will be removed.
There's a difference between it being his house, which it isn't, and being the house he temporarily lives in. Biden owns his home. Trump DOES NOT own the White House.
I believe this would be extortion. What he thinks people are too enamored of him to notice is that those programs get funded when Biden is sworn in as president.
Donald Trump could pack $1 trillion in a suitcase and take it home when his second term is over and it would still be less costly and a better deal for America than the Green New Insanity and the Democrats  march toward socialism that would happen under Biden.

The ‚Äúobvious answer‚Äù was a complete dodge of the question. How does she answer for believing the women Biden accusers, but now she, what, doesn‚Äôt believe them or is ok with Joe doing it?
We‚Äôre some of her haymakers not very much insinuating racial under/overtones by Biden?
No he doesn‚Äôt bring up specifically racism. But he does bring up generally there were some serious things Harris said about Biden, and how does she reconcile that?   Laughing it off is not a response
Racism isn‚Äôt the only significant shot she took at Biden. The women accusers is an interesting back pedal she has to make as well
More elder abuse.  They shouldn't even let Biden run
Now You Know #3 - Biden is staying in his basement and in the presidential election race in order to keep  away fro DOJ in 2021.  , ,  ,   ,
Biden/Harris 2020... They Don't Believe in Magic, They Have a Plan.
Biden acts and sounds like a Christian, unlike Trump...
Three YouTube Ads  ....this is Joe Biden‚Äôs America
Opinion | Tom Toles: Republicans can‚Äôt make head or tails of Biden-Harris
Biden had a great week. Who are you bulls hitting?  You guys are losing and you know it
Yep get rid of 45 and Vote Biden. TRUMP LIES AMERICANS DIE
Can't sleep.  I just keep thinking of new Dem ticket as   Harris/Biden Harris/Biden Harris/Biden  Compare: Biden is a teddy bear and she is a rattlesnake.
She was just biding her time, just as Biden did.  Just as Hillary did.
Will Joe Biden or Kamala Harris give up their salaries to run the country?
This message approved by the Hartis/Biden campaign!  Looting is good!  Reparations, you know.
Biden is bullying Americans who have been terrorized by Democrats during the COVID-19 hoax.  You feel good being part of a team of bullies?  I think you fit right in.  You are just like the people who stole my lunch money as a kid.
Biden/Harris...They Won't Try To Kill You.
‚ÄòMake America Great Again‚Äô is the mantra of white supremacy. Biden and Harris are the huge challenge to white dominance as the nation becomes more multiracial and multinational.
Yesterday, one of our priests gave us his pitch on why we don't vote for Biden, especially with Kamala as VP.  I walked out, went into the ladies room, went back into church and made it through Mass.
#Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks #nannystate #feds no legal authority
It‚Äôs just Trump trying to distract from Biden‚Äôs VP pick announcement.
Just a thought...   What you resist persists.  Block the orange turd and give him and all the others no more of your energy.   Focus the love on Biden/Harris! That‚Äôs where our collective energy should be given.   #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica
There is no attack on the USPS. Voter fraud will run rampant and illegal aliens can steal mail in ballots and vote and mail them in. Voter security is important to the President as is integrity in the election process. Hey, Atleast Trump isnt getting a fake FISA to spy on Biden.
She mistaking tRump‚Äôs rape charge for Biden‚Äôs glorious hope to the American people.
Dems need to repeal that damn law they wrote in 06, when they take all 3 branches. That should go in Biden‚Äôs list of to-dos. It total b.s. and undermines a constitutional mandate.
I've been camping and missed much of what happened.  Seems Harris is taking over the Biden campaign.  She couldn't make it onto the Presidential ticket just months ago.  What makes her think she can now?
SO WHAT‚ÄôS NEXT, ... BIDEN IS GOING TO COME DOWN WITH COVID ... SO ... OF COURSE KAMALA WILL HAVE TO DO IT FOR HIM .... I guess 1/2 a Brain is better than NO BRAIN AT ALL .... LOL üòù
Remember when you said sexual assault accusations against Biden (that Kamala believes, also) didn‚Äôt matter because Orange Man Bad basically?
None of us have a voice or beaten or locked up will happen to us.  Only the felons can speak. Treasonist people as Biden must be locked up. Must do their job  must make sure or after the next few months will probably stroke out for all the lies already told in ONE DAY
Here starts the lies. IF YOU HAVE THE FIX ON VIRUS THEN DAMNIT, please share it. You don't &amp; you know Obama/Biden did NOT replenish what they used on last flu discovered. But they only had to drop it. It was not even close and you people know it yet you go on &amp; on with the lies.
Opinion | What the Kamala Harris Pick Tells Us About Joe Biden - The New York Times
So Kamala did her candidacy announcement and it was actually, really good? Idk call me a hopeless optimist but my gut is telling me things are looking up should the biden/Harris ticket win
I am SURE the media will come out with a story on this and say Biden supports a domestic terrorist group because they are UNBIASED right? üòÇüòÇ
If you want Mexico and Illegal aliens treated better then LEGAL Americans and military veterand then vote for Biden and Harris. I prefer  he has kept his promises and done more in 3 yrs then Bidens done in 47 yrs in the Senate and as VP. Lol
DOPEY DON IS A LIAR.  VOTE BIDEN
Whatever you think of Harris, it‚Äôs nice of Tulsi to lend her to Biden.
What roadmap we are seeing is a wannabe dictator trying to  punish cities that he doesn't like.  Even though he has sworn to protect all america.  Real leaders like Joe Biden understand that.  whinny little crybaby men don't
Haha good move, lol fuck joe Biden.
As long as she stops Biden it.
Not just women of color, but many of us white women are 100% behind Biden/Harris.  However, I am also overjoyed because my daughter is a woman of color.
Biden is strong enough to move forward and do what is needed to be successful in his bid for president.
If they do it's because media hacks like you keep saying that Biden is a corpse even while he's in better physical health than Trump.
OMG! Biden's Staff Gave Him A Script So He'd Know He Was Calling Kamala
Why do you think women and people of color will vote for Biden? Cause they only vote for people with same genitalia or skin color? Surely they learned their lesson already. And Biden could live for another decade with dementia.
Politics are the worst.   Harris: 'I believe' Biden accusers
guys joe biden is on this list
It's time to think ahead (pun intended)..If elected, Biden will be removed in a 25th amendment coup led by his VP-"Alien head" Harris in 2021. The year 2020 will look like a Disneyland vacation in comparison, and the dismantling of America will be expedited. ü§¢üí©üëπ
I‚Äôm sorry y‚Äôall but Harris is Biden‚Äôs best bet. He needed to sway that last bit of generation x that was on the fence, and generation x loved Harris. He would‚Äôve lost voters if he picked a candidate too left or too right. She‚Äôs the most middle he could get that would benefit him.
It would make sense to do it today. Within the hour even. It would suck up any media boost for the Biden campaign.
If they have odds out there that Biden drops out in September or October and is replaced with Michelle Obama I would hammer it right now. üòÇüòÇ they are going to pull out all the stops in the next couple months.
I think you mean #HarrisHarris2020. Biden is done. Harris will be calling the shots.
Glad Biden made his selection.  Harris wasn't my first choice, but I'm gonna back her 100%.  It doesn't have to be perfect to be good.    Go Biden/Harris 2020!
Do you think Biden actually had a say in who is VP candidate was going to be? Guy probably doesn‚Äôt even remember he is running for President. üòÇüòÇ #DementiaJoe
I‚Äôm just gonna say I called it right when Kamala dropped out of the race that she was gonna be Biden‚Äôs vp.
FANTASTIC CHOICE!   WE GONNA BLOW IT UP!  BIDEN 2020!!!!!
Same. I'm technically a registered Republican doing my part to defeat Trump, and that includes following the path of least resistance for Biden.
Personally I agree that I will vote for Biden no matter what but I DO believe it's vitally important that she be extremely experienced in government because of Biden's age  and the fact that she could be faced with the presidency at any moment.
Biden 2020...He Won't Shit on America.
In the last few days, I‚Äôve been called a mother f*cker, for asking people to vote for Biden, no matter who he chooses as his VP. I was accused of impersonating myself (don‚Äôt ask) and I‚Äôve been sexually harassed by bots and people. I‚Äôm just a regular guy who wants our country back
I will one hundred percent vote for Biden, no matter who he chooses for his running mate.
..but Biden?? I still got highly inappropriate DMs. SMDH
The sweaty basketball pic, maybe?? Joe Biden, no offense? The football helmet? Please no..
Your stupid biden
I‚Äôm not telling anyone what to do, but that‚Äôs not cool for her to react that way. I was polite to her. She obviously only wants Warren. I‚Äôll support and vote for Biden, and whoever his running mate is.
This lovely lady, just called me a mother f*cker because I suggested that we all get on board with Biden‚Äôs choice for VP. I reported and blocked her. If you‚Äôre friends with her, then I suggest that you ask her to chill, and cut down on her caffeine intake? üôÑüò≥
Be careful of this person. They said F you to the thought of Biden/Harris. They are not a true resister or who we need, especially right now.
Guess what? I received just as many inappropriate propositions, if not more, with my new Joe Biden profile pic, then I did with my sweaty basketball pic. I‚Äôm not even sure what that says? I‚Äôm going to go with whatever makes me happy. I‚Äôm just blocking the pervy people.
Biden is a lying buffoon and you fall for his lies.
The image is definitely not how I would personally describe Biden‚Äôs opinions. It‚Äôs satire - but I don‚Äôt love it.  Your interpretation of the image is entirely up to you. But an image of enslavement has nothing to do with the enslaved‚Äôs mental capacity.
This is a depiction of what Biden literally said last week.
Ilan Omar believes  is guilty of SEXUAL Assault. UNBELIEVABLY She FEELS ‚ÄúJustice can be DELAYED, but should never be denied.‚Äù EITHER #METOO IS A JOKE &amp; needs to be shut down NOW! OR JOE BIDEN SHOULD STAND TRIAL NOW! We didnt wait for a convenient time to impeach
When I look at my profile pic in my circle, I‚Äôm taken aback a little bit. Not because I don‚Äôt love Joe Biden. It‚Äôs more like, who‚Äôs that old guy looking back at me? If you‚Äôre not following    and  you should be. They are all awesome.
The Difference Between Rump &amp; Biden...
Some of you may have noticed that I changed my profile pic to Joe Biden. This was my choice, but I‚Äôm going to navigate my account and profile, however I choose to. Does anyone have a problem with that? üôÑ
Haha!!! Amazing.  Biden is riding a bike.  Struggles to form a sentence, but rides a bike...like a 3 year old and people are sold ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Same situation for me here in Utah.  But I always vote.  Voted for Obama twice, then Hillary.  And I will be voting for Biden.
Poll: Should Joe Biden Debate¬†Trump?
Editorial Cartoon: Biden Delays VP¬†Pick
Biden is still the PRESUMED nominee!
Accept anyone who isn‚Äôt one hundred percent voting for Biden. #ThingsICanNoLongerDo
That's true.  I want a nice guy (Biden).  However, I am looking forward to him picking an ass kicking woman as VP to be our next president after Biden to keep the house clean for good.
A Vote for Biden is a Vote for America. A Vote for Rump is a Vote for Russia.
What sane person would want to play second fiddle to blithering Biden?
Biden 2020...He Won't Fuck You Over Like Rump
CONye deserves to share the same fate as everyone else in tRumps house of cards. Seriously thinking we might need the whole of Leavenworth to house the fallout of Biden's victory!!!
Looks That Way...Vote Biden 2020.
Biden should have gone with "Baby Got Back".
It is a false choice.  American blacks come from many different cultures, not all of which stem from slaves.  If you are talking about diversity of opinions, they are equal in that respect.  Biden doesn't know what he is talking about.
ROFLMFAO, they mention the Black and Hispanic journalists conference but don‚Äôt even bring up the Biden interview FFS.
You know Biden claiming that unlike blacks, Hispanics have diversity of thought is politically radioactive for Democrats when CNN won‚Äôt even complain about Fox‚Äôs coverage of it.
No way Biden could have a come back that quickly!
ROFLMFAO, same people who say Biden has to choose a WOC for VP FFS.
This isn't going to win you the minority vote.  nor is it going to lose it to Biden.  It just shows what a out of touch white supremacist you are.
Joe Biden:  There is no there there.
If we don‚Äôt want Biden, but also don‚Äôt want Trump.....what are we supposed to do?No you got it wrong. He spoke of it.   It was Biden that really did it to the intern.
You mean Harris/Biden?
8out of 10 people in my state are voting Biden/Harris, they voted Trump 2016, but he didn‚Äôt deliver on his promise , jobs, coal, hurt farmers, and their lives are not better but worse.  Utah has always been Red, but I think it‚Äôs looking pretty purple right now.
No we will not be voting for you!  Your right about one thing though.  We will be voting for Joe Biden because we want a better safer life!  You have provided the exact opposite! #TrumpFailedAmerica
Goes to church regularly? Ha!
"I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab 'em by the pussy. You can do anything."   You idiots created the opportunity for Biden/Harris. Don't go blaming us.
If Biden wins, the Kamala vs. Ivanka 2024 race is going to be just the absolute worst
I realize that many aren‚Äôt happy with a Biden/Harris ticket. HOWEVER it is WAY better than a Trump/Pence ticket. We need to realize that another 4 years with Trump will destroy ALL communities regardless of race, sexual orientation, gender identity or political party. #VoteBlue
The best thing about Biden picking kamala is, he will get to do it again tomorrow#50firstdatespresident
Okay, so based on your line of reasoning, I am super curious. Who are you voting for in November? And please don‚Äôt say Biden, because he doesn‚Äôt fit your narrative either. Maybe we should all vote for President Nelson
This is how liberal press is freaked out by Biden:
If Joe Biden wins I will be praying for the second coming to be here!
You are out of your MIND, Typical Liberal, Truth Means nothing, watch 15 minutes of Joe and 15 minutes of Trump, Biden will be a blathering idiot in places.  Trump is speaking all the time there are hundreds of hours you can pick from.
What? Are the citizens in these countries legally able to vote in the election? What does it mean, "Russia is working against Joe Biden?" Unless these countries are fraudulently voting as American citizens during election, why are they acting as if they get to decide? Nice try.We need to ensure we win by a LANDSLIDE that is undeniable.  Please vote for Biden. We have to end this nightmare.
So all cops are voting trump are they? Guess that tells us all we need to know. I bet the postal workers are voting Biden.
What?  As a recent transplant to Utah, I‚Äôm shocked.  I do believe that Mormon values are more aligned with Biden and Harris, but most folks i meet are straight Republican ticket voters...
I‚Äôm attending Joe Biden for President‚Äôs event, ‚ÄúSalt Lake City For Biden/Harris Swing State Get Out The Training‚Äù ‚Äì sign up now to join me!
Just came out the church of jesus christ is having members of the church vote for Biden and Harris  . So that's going to put a real damper on trump and his election
I honestly believe that Biden will be president for a very short time then Kamala will take his place .. gut feeling
'The Five' fact-check claims Biden made in speech with Kamala Harris
I‚Äôm really concerned that Biden WILL pick up where Ovomit left off
a lot of y‚Äôall saying you‚Äôll vote biden and then hold him accountable are the same ppl who had ‚Äúif hillary was prez, we‚Äôd be at brunch right now‚Äù signs at the woman‚Äôs march so forgive me if i‚Äôm a lil skeptical of y‚Äôall.
"oNLy rEpUbLiCAnS aRe ImMoRaL"   Joe Biden &amp; Bill Clinton are rapists.  Also, at the time Trump did those things, he was a Democrat.  Please, continue favoring us with your dumb-assery.
Can‚Äôt wait to hear LDS NeverTrumpers justify voting for Biden now since Kamala Harris supports late-term abortion &amp; blocked the Senate (twice!) from voting to protect babies born alive after botched abortions. She is also anti Catholic. The choice this November is clear.
The thing about this election is that the democrats already know that Biden is flawed, so all the conservatives trying to convince everyone that he isn‚Äôt perfect aren‚Äôt really doing much in terms of changing opinions.
#Democrats  And #JoeBiden   Are So #UNHINGED And #Broken That Even #BrackObama   SLAMMED #Biden As #UnfitForOffice
That's funny kind of reminds me of the lazy crazy sleepy Joe Biden swamp.
I already follow him! I'll retweet!
Start question Biden. See  how far it goes.
Clinton or Biden would be pushing that but it‚Äôs easily verifiable. Try harder
One of if not the most important #book you‚Äôll ever read üíØüíØüíØ #AbolishThePolice #BidenHarris #Biden #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
Don't give Joe Biden a pass, either. üëá
Why is nobody is talking about how Joe Biden is ALSO descended from slavers?   They both support #Reparations, which means they both want others to be held accountable for the sins of their ancestors.   But then simultaneously, they don't want to be held accountable themselves.
How to get your Grandparents to vote for Biden: Call them up and ask if they got the card you sent (you didn't send one)  When they say no, let them know it must've got lost in the mail because Trump is taking USPS away but you hope Biden wins so you can keep sending them cards.
I registered Republican for the first time in my life, this was going to be my first vote and for you, but now I'm voting Biden cause of what your doing to the postal service, sorry, should have thought it through BIDEN 2020!
The matter of fact is that all Arabs face a regional threat from Iran, and if Joe Biden wins the US elections that threat will increase and to overcome the threat they have openly shook hands with Israel as a regional partner. #uae
Is that your entire list of things you love about Biden/Harris?
...or more to the point, you've done more TO women and none of it good, you dirty old man. Get out of DC! Vote Biden and Harris!
And not to forget Tony Blinken, whose ‚ÄòWestExec Advisors‚Äô help companies to get access in China. Take a look at the companies these advisers are associated with and you can get a sense of what kind of China policy they will run
Here is Jake Sullivan, a key Biden Foreign policy adviser, listen to him and compare to Trumps team on China
I don‚Äôt think she will be in charge of foreign policy anyway,  it will be driven by Joe Biden‚Äôs foreign policy advisers, the same ones that advised him when he was Vice-President with Ukraine/China portfolio.
are you kidding me Kevin Obama taking credit for Trump's job increase just like oh biden's taking credit for Trump getting peace in the middle East.
Literally someone had a Biden 2020 sign in their porch today and I wanted to throw up.
Biden &amp; Harris are going to restore justice. Tick Tock, Matt.
This is all I need to know.  Trump hats are made in China.  Biden hats are made by Union Members in the USA.
Postal carriers union endorses Biden, warns that 'survival' of USPS is at stake  The endorsement comes after the president's resistance to Postal Service funding, amid his fight against expanded mail-in voting.
Get excited about Biden.
I'm unhappy it's never that bad. Even if Biden wins I'll survive. My bank account and equity in my home may take massive hits, but I'll find a way to get through it and have a smile on my face
So why you voting for Biden?
It's a good question.   Why does Joe Biden want to see his own kind "cleansed?"
You should vote for Biden. He‚Äôs a good man and will serve us well. #BidenHarris2020
Lets get some activism then. But that is still no comparison to Trump who currently uses a man on his legal council that defended Epstein and that same lawyer raped an underage girl that was trafficked to him by Epstein.  Biden is better than Trump. Period.
Little Brian Stelter Is VERY UPSET That Right Wingers Talk About Joe Biden.
List all the great things about Biden and Harris
Do you think Joe Biden even realizes he‚Äôs running for president or so his handlers have to remind him daily or hourly?
I‚Äôm LDS and Voted trump in 2016 And his handeling of pandemic and his constant shots at low income housing and how it‚Äôs ruined suburbia. And his racist ways I‚Äôll vote Biden/Harris
The democratic ticket has to be a joke.  No way are they running with a Biden/Harris ticket.  I am calling their bluff!
I'm to the point of just removing people from my life who tell me Trans Lives aren't enoigh of a reason to vote for Biden/Harris.  My life is all I have. Its plenty of enough reason.
uhh joe biden
There are no credible facts that Joe Biden is a pedophile.  This is another conspiracy theory. Don't fall for it.
News flash, Spanky, the world already is laughing at us. Well, they‚Äôre laughing at you, but as the supposed leader of this nation, the mocking of you is the same as laughing at us. If anything, a Biden administration will help America regain its standing in the world.
üé∂ Biden can‚Äôt run his own life, I‚Äôll be damned if he‚Äôll run mine üé∂
the fuck is ava gonna say when biden gets elected and people keep dying. doesn't count anymore?
Yo, Hear me out. Joe Biden wins the election, after some months in, he‚Äôs dead. Kamala is the next president
If only Kamala Harris were even a fraction as far left as Trump is trying to paint her. Meanwhile multiple Wallstreet execs recently breathed a sigh of relief as they saw Kamala as a sign that Biden/Harris is going to be a moderate ticket.
1. A 7-point Biden lead would be some tightening. 2. 9% undecided/other seems high for this race. 3. The other results in here do not imply that much if any of that 9% will break for Trump.
"I'm Joe Biden, and I approve this message."
Despicable.   Will not be voting Biden/Harris
It's well known that people will accuse others of things that they themselves are guilty of. He has brought our country to this point with his lack of leadership and his stupidity. So he accuses Biden of poor leadership skills and poor mental capacity. He fools no one. He's out!
I‚Äôm positive that 94‚Äô crime bill . wrote has done more harm to the black community than any conspiracy especially when u take into account Biden worked with segregationists to lock up minorities with tough on crime policies and mandatory minimum legislation
I'm kind of surprised that the Republicans' attempt at Othering yet another black opponent is not reportable as an in-kind contribution to the Biden campaign.
"I'm Joe Biden, and I approve this message."
Hey, asshole, it isn't getting better! Nobody has even a marginal grasp on this virus except the scientists. Stop lying to us, bastard! You SUCK! Vote Biden/Harris!  Trump turns toward a third season of coronavirus with a tale of success
Drudge stole your line. "Did  Biden Trump Trump".
Analysis: Harris struck Trump in her ticket debut. Biden needs her to strike a balance.  via
However when Joe Biden introduced her as his running mate and mispronounced Kamala he gets a pass! Tucker was following Joe's lead, but typical liberals only report what they want to hear.
Tell us now if Biden plans to raise Americans taxes? I don't know how it works in Canada, but I'm paying enough already without supporting the D's socialistic policy proposals for America.
Tell us what Biden/Harris plan for America? How much more in taxes are you ready to pay for the GND? Slavery reparations? Yes, they support these.
Tell us how Biden/Harris are going to help?
Well I'm hopping china blocks Russia out and helps joe Biden win win win because I still really think trump start this virus thinking it would save him to stay president then it got out of control and he and his family did not know how to stop it that's why he does not want to
If anything like this ever reaches  verification , Joe Biden will be looking for a new VP pick.
That's what Joe Biden has said. Is there anyone out there who thinks that they're taxed too little?
I told you Joe Biden is the modern day Harry Anslinger he has been since the 80s when he introduced Billie Holliday type legislation tough on addicts and the pushers just like Anslingers racist crusade but this time all minorities where Billie Holliday and whites got a taste too
I swear 2020 is worst than 2016 in the "2 party voting system, evil scale style":  Evil scale '16: Hillary 100 to Trump 50 (Trump was evil on words, Hillary was plain evil)  Evil scale '20: Biden 100 to Trump 100 (both equally evil on action and words, non-words for Biden üëÄ)
‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs candidacy will be nuts‚Äù says man who died two weeks ago lmao
If they get to use this stat, Biden should freely use the current unemployment rate with no asterisk.   I‚Äôm being told that indeed, both wildly misleading stats are being used quite freely. In next week‚Äôs episode of Post-Fact Campaigning....
The things we have learned from the past whether it's #Democrats or #Republicans #Congress or #BJP, both are enemies of Islam while Trump may be visible and Joe Biden invisible or Amit Shah as Visible and Rahul Gandhi as invisible.  History has proved that.
You realize Biden pronounces it wrong too?
Nah. Biden‚Äôs mind is totally gone.
MAGA is big &amp; loud &amp; blasts through without humanity. Biden is a real guy, does the hard work, &amp; has a cool soundtrack.
Any #Canadian friends have some insights about me possibly moving to #Canada ??  -What's it like? -How's the weather? -How expensive/easy is healthcare or getting treated? -How is the housing situation? -Is #Trudeau better than Trump/Biden? Most importantly: -Will my cat like it?
ICYMI üëá  &gt;Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris: "It's not fair to hold us accountable for the slavery sins of our ancestors."  &gt;Also Joe &amp; Kamala: "We think ALL current Americans should be held accountable for the slavery sins of our ancestors."   #BidenVP #Biden2020 #Reparations

Biden calling Harris CNN doctors the photo so it doesn't show Biden looking at a script
How sad is it that Dems are more excited about a vice presidential debate than the presidential debate. I‚Äôm so looking forward to the PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE where Trump relentlessly assaults #RacistJoe and ol‚Äô Joe can‚Äôt mutter a coherent sentence. Dems always support Racism #Biden

Does Radical Islam make an appearance during a Biden Harris Presidency?
My intuition is that this is a three coin-flip race. Biden's lead has been stable, moving within a fairly narrow range. At the low end, Trump still needs a polling error in his favor to have a 50-50 chance. At the high end, he's toast. Three coin-flips instead of two. 88% Biden.
Biden should win.  Trump's chance of winning is not frivolous.

The Fred election model says:  Biden is materially ahead right now. Biden would be very likely to win if the election were today. There are three months till the election and a lot can change. Trump can still win. This year is crazy.
Haha just know Biden supporters will be treated like trump supporters from now on lmfao
I do not, that's one of Trumps worst decisions. But hear you me our troop presence around the world will increase dramatically under Biden. And the Venezuela coup will happen where Trump failed, and a hot war with Iran isn't out of the question
Current Indian government will not like Biden government. They better start praying for his defeat
That's sad Joe Biden should know better. Trump four more years God bless you President Trump.
Psychopathic Sadist??? Look, being hyperbolic to the point of utter stupidity is a symptom of TDS. OBiden had the House, Senate, and presidency and gave us shit Obamacare. 50,000 people a year die because they have no healthcare. So yeah, go vote for Biden
Oh, is she having trouble deciding between Biden and Trump?  Makes sense now.
Lots of polling showed Democrats were really worried about a safe, electable pick. Many of the rank-and-file were leery (and there‚Äôs a lot of problematic stuff tied up in that) of a black woman at the top of the ticket.   With Biden anchoring the ticket those concerns went away.
It felt like there was a little veiled misogyny in the field as folks easily dismissed huge flaws in Biden and Bernie, but cancelled Harris and Klobuchar for being mean and Warren for being...uhh...prepared
Mentioning Biden's memory while supporting/believing tRump is capable of anything besides...  *160,000+ dead Americans  *Record numbers or UNEMPLOYED Americans  *Caged Children *Grifting, Lying &amp; Conning at every opportunity
Because she was getting crushed in the polls despite utterly mud-hole stomping everyone in the debates.  I think the Dem Primary was funny because they'd fail to vote for candidates and then lament them when they suspended. Then voted for Biden and now grump about him constantly
If Trump supporters are racist by association what does that make . supporters? This man considered Storm Thurmond(a racist, segregationist) a friend of his smfh and Biden sees nothing wrong with working with racists he‚Äôs proud of it....
What‚Äôs remarkable is . actually wrote a Crime Bill that resulted in mass incarceration in the black community üíØüíØüíØ Biden worked closely with his racist colleagues to push crime policy toward mandatory minimum sentences and other ‚Äúget tough‚Äù positions
But did you also know that Joe Biden's ancestors owned slaves? Sauce üëá
tRump isn't simply "an asshole". He's a stoopid SOB whose incapable of managing a pandemic, killing 150,000+ Americans.  Unemployment at historic levels yet somehow Barry &amp; Biden's "socialism" has gotten you into a lather.  WHAT has tRump accomplished in 3 years besides this‚òùÔ∏è?
As a conservative that isn‚Äôt thrilled with the way the Republican Party has gone, I totally would have supported a Biden- ticket way over Biden- . Kamala is part of the reason we joke that CA is ‚Äúcommie-fornia‚Äù. She‚Äôs an alt-left dumpster fire.
&gt;"simply ignore Biden's existence, as most people have done for most of Biden's career."   *China &amp; Ukraine have entered the chat* üëÄ
Great combination, her aligning with Biden will ensure Indian-Americans &amp; Afro-American voters.                      Nightmare for opponents !
So you are already handicapping Biden's demise? What???!! Why didn't Democrats just choose Harris at the beginning?
You can stand by you decision and not vote for Biden but know this: Your big system-wide change may never occur and the things you want to see may have to come in steps. You can be making a difference now instead of waiting for the the climate to be right.

I can't imagine Modi to have a free run under Biden-Harris administration.  India-US relations stand where they are.  However we could even see a "American Values" driven Foreign Policy agenda.
I think it's become clear that Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris to appease our Neighbors To The North and secure the illegal Canadian vote.  I'm looking forward to Bill Barr opening up an investigation on Canadian collusion &amp; interference in this election.
3. Joe Biden's handlers' strategy still going strong, right  Cancel those debates!
2. Joe Biden's racism is baked into the cake. Y'all can stop wasting your breath on it.
Thread  1. How about a thread of tweets that have aged well?  Joe Biden's racism won't hurt him. ‚úÖ
Biden is a Dem
I think that a Biden presidency will be just about the same as a Trump one, except Trump says the quiet part out loud and Biden won't. And I actually think Biden will be worse on foreign policy. I could wrong but I don't think so
And you feel no bit of nausea with Biden??? That's all I need to know
4 years of Trump and 4 years of Biden will look just about the fucking same. Except Biden and Co. will stab us in the back, and Trump stabs us in the front. At least Trump makes me laugh...fuck outta here with that "we can't survive" shit

The Joe Biden twist might be for some, though.
Appeal to a lot of Utahns? Who writes for KSL, a teenager? Does Harris still believe Biden is a racist who hung out with segregationists and does she still believe the women who accused Biden of sexual assault? Obviously üôÑ Biden can‚Äôt remember any of this.

I‚Äôd vote for Biden if he ran with a can of applesauce, but ok.
"Harris said that she would pass the Equality Act on her first day in the White House.  She also vowed to end the epidemic of violence against trans women of colour, saying there must be ‚Äúserious consequence and accountability‚Äù."
Yeah, but I am wondering how that's going to work out. I would love to see that. Wondering if any Dems will get in the door in a supposed red state. Can't imagine supporting anyone but Biden and Harris! Finally, a light at the end of a very long, dark tunnel!
Does Harris still believe Biden is a racist who hung out with segregationists and does she still believe the women who accused Biden of sexual assault? Obviously üôÑ Biden can‚Äôt remember any of this.
Tulsi is such a beautiful, intelligent woman. Why did we, the actual left, get screwed all over again with Biden/Harris when we had incredible candidates like Tulsi, Bernie, and Andrew Yang.
It‚Äôs Biden/Harris or authoritarianism. One step at a time.
My reaction when Biden announced  as his VP: HERcules! HERcules! HERcules! #BidenHarris2020
Biden could pick a table lamp as his running mate at this point and I would vote for him just to get the orange buffoon out of office.#Biden2020
If elected with Biden,  would be two firsts: First woman and first person of color to serve as vice president. Regardless of political preferences, I hope everyone can appreciate such historic firsts.   #TakeNote #BlackLivesMatter #SpeakUpandDribble #JazzNation
I‚Äôm so thrilled. I‚Äôm alternately dancing with joy or crying. I‚Äôm so glad that you &amp; Biden are going         to the White House. The horrible Trump years are about to end.

Biden and Kamala are far from radical left. üòÇ As far as I'm concerned, they're cops too.
This could be the market starting to shift to the idea that Biden could get the seat. Kamala Harris was a great strategic pick by the Biden team as she is known to be more of a moderate dem that is very wall st friendly. Loosing the artificial mkt prop was the cause of the dump
Yes it is an exciting moment when Kamala‚Äôs appetite for political gain is greater than her belief in his sexual accusers and her anger towards Biden for supporting segregation... and the list goes on. Really good for Americaü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Biden is a tank with low aggro and Trump the damage dealer can't concentrate on a target.
Hahahaha... you're scared silly... which is saying something since you're always running scared. Vote Biden and Harris! Down with tyranny! Get rid of the lemmings and toss the lying Traitor Trump into prison and forget about him. He deserves a cold, dank cell with no privalges!
Biden once again ignores the Extremely Online on both sides and does the safe, normie thing.
I am just amazed at the miracle that must have happened to change her mind from thinking Biden has racist tendencies and she believed his accusers...the quest for political gain is strong in this oneü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Kamala came through and saved Biden like how anime characters come in at the last second and block the killing blow. Talking bout "Sorry I'm late....hehe"
I wonder if they are worried that the accusation Biden is just a socialist Trojan horse has more weight than they want to fight. So they chose a more moderate woman of color.
She will certainly help Biden carry California if he can remember where that is.
She literally called Biden a racist in the initial debates. So her hunger for political gain erases that now?
Does Biden feel bad that she called him a racist in the initial debates...or is that not matter now?
Honestly it doesn't matter who is choice was. I will be voting for Biden. With that being said, I like the choice.
give up. that was only possible with bernie. Biden has no such crossover appeal to Mexican voters.

Please vote for Biden.  I won't survive another 4 years. I'm scared.   "Conservatives in America are reportedly hoping Donald Trump will weaponise trans rights in an effort to revitalise his failing re-election bid."
Joe Biden is about as corrupt as they come, and he has been for a long time.  I couldn't care less if he's being exploited now. He spent decades exploiting us.
Now we got sleepy creepy lazy Joe. And brainwashed blond Miss Biden. and I don't know what kind of softball lobs this reporter was doing it was ridiculous. As boring as watching paint dry.IDK Dan. I'm not a Democrat (never have been) but I'm solidly not for Trump. Plenty of independents here in Utah I know who feel the same. I wish I wasn't voting for Biden but I don't see a reasonable alternative. Too bad the GOP let itself get hacked and taken over by a conman.
We need to ensure we win by a LANDSLIDE that is undeniable.  Please vote for Biden. We have to end this nightmare.
So all cops are voting trump are they? Guess that tells us all we need to know. I bet the postal workers are voting Biden.
What?  As a recent transplant to Utah, I‚Äôm shocked.  I do believe that Mormon values are more aligned with Biden and Harris, but most folks i meet are straight Republican ticket voters...

Biden can‚Äôt answer randonm questions.
The word ‚Äúdefund‚Äù is unfortunate because that is not really the goal. Biden stated several times that he does not support defunding police.  It‚Äôs simply a matter of deciding what reforms are needed (and where) to best protect citizens.
"oNLy rEpUbLiCAnS aRe ImMoRaL"   Joe Biden &amp; Bill Clinton are rapists.  Also, at the time Trump did those things, he was a Democrat.  Please, continue favoring us with your dumb-assery.
Can‚Äôt wait to hear LDS NeverTrumpers justify voting for Biden now since Kamala Harris supports late-term abortion &amp; blocked the Senate (twice!) from voting to protect babies born alive after botched abortions. She is also anti Catholic. The choice this November is clear.
The thing about this election is that the democrats already know that Biden is flawed, so all the conservatives trying to convince everyone that he isn‚Äôt perfect aren‚Äôt really doing much in terms of changing opinions.

Why is nobody is talking about how Joe Biden is ALSO descended from slavers?   They both support #Reparations, which means they both want others to be held accountable for the sins of their ancestors.   But then simultaneously, they don't want to be held accountable themselves.
Mainly because when it comes to actually lowering abortion #‚Äôs, Biden is the candidate. Access to affordable contraceptives is the single easiest way to curb abortions and Trump is against it. Plus, abortion is a legal issue, not a political one. No president can change that
Got my vote. More qualified than Trump or Biden
I am LDS and WILL NOT be voting for Trump or Biden.
Regardless of who you want to win the election, you are a moron if you preach voter turnout and then talk about how big of a landslide it‚Äôll be for Biden. The left played this game four years ago and it probably gifted trump the White House
Whatever...Seniors would be safer getting from UPS and we don‚Äôt want it saved for all those dead people , cats and dogs to vote. Why do you blame Trump when the postal service has lost money for years and years and years-including the ones Obama and Biden could have helped!

How to get your Grandparents to vote for Biden: Call them up and ask if they got the card you sent (you didn't send one)  When they say no, let them know it must've got lost in the mail because Trump is taking USPS away but you hope Biden wins so you can keep sending them cards.
I registered Republican for the first time in my life, this was going to be my first vote and for you, but now I'm voting Biden cause of what your doing to the postal service, sorry, should have thought it through BIDEN 2020!

Despicable.   Will not be voting Biden/Harris
I‚Äôm not sure that is accurate, but he HAS been on the side of most bad ones. Joe Biden‚Äôs 1994 crime bill has incarcerated more Black men than any single othe factor. Could‚Äôve reversed it as VP under Obama. Nope.
It's well known that people will accuse others of things that they themselves are guilty of. He has brought our country to this point with his lack of leadership and his stupidity. So he accuses Biden of poor leadership skills and poor mental capacity. He fools no one. He's out!
No, being handsy and sniffing hair is not the same as admitting you think it‚Äôs okay to grab women by the pussy. Who are the white supremicists supporting? thousands if not millions of white supremacists are Trump supporters. Find me one single white supremacist Biden supporter.

Calling someone racist who you know isn't racist is wicked. Harris did that to Biden, and she's about to do it to Pence.
I have supported many women along the way too. I just think you need to open your eyes about Kamala. She called Biden a racist. Was that true? If not it was wicked. She's ruthless. You'll see.
I love the smell of desperation in the morning!  Smells like Biden/Harris landslide!
Dear People Who Write Joe Biden's Tweets: This is a lie. It was very clearly proven to be a lie. And only people who live in a self imposed bubble aren't aware of it.
And those it happens to become ineffective. Biden isn‚Äôt. He has shown time again his effectiveness and longevity. This will be his grand finale.
Yeah, he tweeted about the bus system in Ogden a few months ago. I think he had a Biden moment.
Would you be outraged if he was wearing a Biden hat? Asking for a friend.
Any #Canadian friends have some insights about me possibly moving to #Canada ??  -What's it like? -How's the weather? -How expensive/easy is healthcare or getting treated? -How is the housing situation? -Is #Trudeau better than Trump/Biden? Most importantly: -Will my cat like it?

Donald Trump is not her opponent.  Mike Pence is.   Well at least until they push Biden out but that won‚Äôt be until after the election.
Just did this and sure enough it goes directly to Joe Biden's site. WTF!!!
My intuition is that this is a three coin-flip race. Biden's lead has been stable, moving within a fairly narrow range. At the low end, Trump still needs a polling error in his favor to have a 50-50 chance. At the high end, he's toast. Three coin-flips instead of two. 88% Biden.

There are plenty of reasons to vote for Trump and there are plenty of reasons to vote for Biden.
I think the two party system is trash and should be done away with. But it‚Äôs not, and Biden/Harris is still MILES better than 4 more years of Trump/Pence. King is swallowing his pride and getting on board. That shows some fiber, to me
The Fred election model says:  Biden is materially ahead right now. Biden would be very likely to win if the election were today. There are three months till the election and a lot can change. Trump can still win. This year is crazy.
He may be a hypocrite (I barely know who he is), but these screenshots aren‚Äôt examples of it. I suppose you think Bernie is a hypocrite for supporting Biden, as well? Or Hillary for supporting Obama?
I was a Warren supporter and didn‚Äôt like Biden or Harris. But now I‚Äôll enthusiastically support them, because Warren is no longer an option. That doesn‚Äôt make me a hypocrite and it doesn‚Äôt make King one either.
I don‚Äôt understand how people think this is a dunk? The first tweet was in 2018, before the campaign even started. OF COURSE he would have preferred candidates. But now that it‚Äôs set, OF COURSE he would support Biden and Harris.
Haha just know Biden supporters will be treated like trump supporters from now on lmfao
I do not, that's one of Trumps worst decisions. But hear you me our troop presence around the world will increase dramatically under Biden. And the Venezuela coup will happen where Trump failed, and a hot war with Iran isn't out of the question

Column: Biden picks Kamala Harris. Trump should dump Mike Pence and replace him with a yacht.
Oh, is she having trouble deciding between Biden and Trump?  Makes sense now.
Lots of polling showed Democrats were really worried about a safe, electable pick. Many of the rank-and-file were leery (and there‚Äôs a lot of problematic stuff tied up in that) of a black woman at the top of the ticket.   With Biden anchoring the ticket those concerns went away.
It felt like there was a little veiled misogyny in the field as folks easily dismissed huge flaws in Biden and Bernie, but cancelled Harris and Klobuchar for being mean and Warren for being...uhh...prepared
Mentioning Biden's memory while supporting/believing tRump is capable of anything besides...  *160,000+ dead Americans  *Record numbers or UNEMPLOYED Americans  *Caged Children *Grifting, Lying &amp; Conning at every opportunity
Because she was getting crushed in the polls despite utterly mud-hole stomping everyone in the debates.  I think the Dem Primary was funny because they'd fail to vote for candidates and then lament them when they suspended. Then voted for Biden and now grump about him constantly
Because Dems dislike Biden even more?
Are we deciding whether to put Cheney back in the White House, or Biden? You know, arms to ISIS and Black men to prison Biden.
If Trump supporters are racist by association what does that make . supporters? This man considered Storm Thurmond(a racist, segregationist) a friend of his smfh and Biden sees nothing wrong with working with racists he‚Äôs proud of it....
What‚Äôs remarkable is . actually wrote a Crime Bill that resulted in mass incarceration in the black community üíØüíØüíØ Biden worked closely with his racist colleagues to push crime policy toward mandatory minimum sentences and other ‚Äúget tough‚Äù positions
Why can‚Äôt we switch it up right now and make it a Harris/Biden ticket instead of Biden/Harris?

tRump isn't simply "an asshole". He's a stoopid SOB whose incapable of managing a pandemic, killing 150,000+ Americans.  Unemployment at historic levels yet somehow Barry &amp; Biden's "socialism" has gotten you into a lather.  WHAT has tRump accomplished in 3 years besides this‚òùÔ∏è?
As a conservative that isn‚Äôt thrilled with the way the Republican Party has gone, I totally would have supported a Biden- ticket way over Biden- . Kamala is part of the reason we joke that CA is ‚Äúcommie-fornia‚Äù. She‚Äôs an alt-left dumpster fire.

I think that a Biden presidency will be just about the same as a Trump one, except Trump says the quiet part out loud and Biden won't. And I actually think Biden will be worse on foreign policy. I could wrong but I don't think so
CNN is now pushing for Biden to step aside after he wins election. Apparently, his aides are pushing this too in his weak state. In his campaign announcement, he said she would be ready to lead the country. Hmmm.
And you feel no bit of nausea with Biden??? That's all I need to know

My political prediction is this: if Biden and Harris win, in four years from now, 30% of the country will still be mispronouncing her first name.
Then also google The First Step Act, a bipartisan bill signed by Trump, which begins to reverse some of the effects of Biden‚Äôs bills. Obama and Biden had EIGHT YEARS and did nothing for minorities in prison, even when the Dems held both Houses

The idea that Biden who, though imperfect like us all, has led an admirable life of public service is ‚Äúas bad as‚Äù Tr*mp is laughable, and is used as a defense by people who are embarrassed that they support Tr*mp.
Did he say if you don't go after Biden I won't give you your money? Or is that a made up deamon rat lie.
Where's Hunter, Biden is racist/rapist, attack Democrats for being too weak to stop Trump, Kamala is a cop, attack Hillary, attack Bill Clinton, Kamala isn't black, Kamala isn't a citizen, Kamala is racist, Qanon, then cycle back to Biden can't survive an interview/debate.
"I am here to tell you that our country needs Joe Biden," Howell says, arguing that Latter-day Saints should not be afraid to stand up in their wards and share their support for his campaign.
4 years ago, Joe Biden was in Utah and met privately with Elder Ballard. The church had prepared Biden's genealogy and the then-vice president cried looking through it, Howell recounts.
Fake Warren? Yeah, you mean like how she accused Bernie of being sexist. That snake was polarizing, and she's done. The silver lining was thinking she could become Biden's pick for VP lol.
She highlights the Biden campaign's stance on voting rights, climate change, the justice system, women's rights, daycare, affordable housing and immigration.
I‚Äôve seen stats that it could! And will in the future, just not this election cycle so really what is the point? If it were closer to a battleground state, or if we actually had direct elections then ya I‚Äôd vote Biden
If knowing all that I‚Äôve said to be true (which can be easily fact checked) u still refuse to vote Biden then you know damn well why we can‚Äôt progress as quickly as we hope. Nothing in life is as easy as refusing to budge to get to where u want. Open a history book and see.
I did choose Bernie but no matter what happened the dems would‚Äôve pulled some bs to create the situation we now have. That is why u need to put everything u want to happen to the side while protecting innocent ppl by voting Biden until the Green Party has figured out a way to win
You act like a liberal, post like a liberal, and chase conservatives like a liberal...your a liberal my friend.  None of your posts or retweets pursue negative comments on biden or the dem halfwits.  All anti trump and anti establishment.  Liberal
Dickson is the Biden campaign's national faith engagement director.
"I want to kick off by saying how important outreach to the Latter-day Saint community is to the Biden campaign. We believe there is a strong overlap in shared values between what Latter-day Saints stand for and" the Biden/Harris agenda. says Josh Dickson.
Taking a short break from weekend fun to watch the Biden campaign's virtual town hall with Latter-day Saints. I'll tweet some observations.
That's funny kind of reminds me of the lazy crazy sleepy Joe Biden swamp.
No ballots to vote. The post office mail sorters have been removed from the floors and hours cut in order to purposely delay ballot voting. You need to understand the severity of the precedent that sets. Do you want Biden to defund the post office in 4 years? He can if Trump can.
Pls don‚Äôt forget that Obama and Biden were the ones trying to get us towards Medicare for all. ACA was a starting point. You should watch the movie on YouTube about it. They were the ones hoping for the same thing you are fighting for but we‚Äôre stopped at every turn by repub‚Äôs
BSOTA: The hosts discuss postponing collegiate football and Utah's daily case count dropping below 350/day. In the national scene, perspectives clash on Sen. Harris earning Joe Biden's VP nomination and POTUS's unconstitutional use of executive orders.
As I am fully aware that the vote will go to waste if I don‚Äôt vote Biden. It is illogical to vote for anyone else‚Äôs knowing it will go to trump.
It‚Äôs a very clear choice for me. Either vote my conscience and have it go to trump or vote Biden. So in my mind either I am voting for change or not voting for change. Biden will bring about better change than trump will. My humanitarian conscience won‚Äôt let me vote for green...
I know that my vote for any1else won‚Äôt count right now. It‚Äôs simple math in my eyes. We can vote our conscience but it just ends up going to trump. Knowing that I cant vote for anyone other than Biden. 2024 election is the time to put our middle finger up and show them we r done
I apologize for not recognizing you. üò¢ I didn‚Äôt mean to disrespect you&amp;understand why you said what you said. I just hope between now and then you may see that if we don‚Äôt vote for biden we will essentially vote for trump. I know it sucks, but I can‚Äôt see a way around it.
Yes. And they are starting in on  and  now. Right wing pundits like  demanding that Biden hold weekly news conferences.
I will say this though hun. This election is a hard one. Simply because of the fact that a vote for anyone else is a vote for trump. He‚Äôs a wicked wicked man who is destroying our environment and our freedoms. I can‚Äôt in good conscience vote for anyone other than Biden.
If the polls are useless then everything is just fine then. Let Biden not give interviews and let Trump continue with his daily briefings. We'll see come November
You may be on to something here.

A lot of San Franciscans just went "meh" when she was announced. She wasn't a very good DA, she was an okay AG, and she hasn't done much as a Senator, but we'll vote for her and Biden to get the Cheeto Puff out of office. Racial criticism is dumb but she has a lot to answer for.

Not really. Someone who strives for certain values, even if they personally fall short, is preferable to someone motivated by self-interest and pride. Clinton versus Bush and Dole were much closer choices than Tr*mp versus Biden, the subject of my original tweet. Tr*mp is awful.
Yes. These are ideals we should strive for. I think Biden strives for them, even if he sometimes falls short. I do not think Tr*mp strives for them. At least, I see little evidence of it.

If this was true, any comments section of any website can be held liable. Twitter accounts are also not tied to just one person. Joe Biden's Twitter account is not run by Joe Biden. Again, the ToS override any of these constitutional questions you bring up.
Why is nobody is talking about how Joe Biden is ALSO descended from slavers?   They both support #Reparations, which means they both want others to be held accountable for the sins of their ancestors.   But then simultaneously, they don't want to be held accountable themselves.
Hey Clint do you really see Trump and Biden as equally divisive? I‚Äôm genuinely curious and not just trying to be disagreeable.
Your former press secretary  is actively aiding him in suppressing the vote by constantly maligning Biden/Harris at every turn and encouraging voters to hold their votes hostage or vote 3rd party.

Why is Xi standing next to trump when he wants Biden? Are you really that slow?
Uknow voting fraud system is set2roll....the postal union endorses Biden....postal workers have access to the ballots....good enough to remove ballot access from USPS....a clear conflict of interest...saying postal workers I've talked to are vehemently anti-trump not vilification
we know police are very pro-Trump.....I'm sure from my interaction with postal workers you will find they support anti-Trump or Biden just as much......it doesn't take a majority to do voter fraud....pro-Biden have dominance and access...needs to be taken out of hands of USPS
A) I don't think VP sways votes anyway and B) I don't think there was anyone Biden could pick that would sway a 2020 Trump voter
will Trump debate himself when Biden refuses to show?

Absolutely not. I never voted for Trump before. I don‚Äôt think I will this time. I want to vote for Biden but abortion is a topic that sways me yes.

How can you possibly call out Biden on Tara Reade without acknowledging these women?
If you go to his website he has policy proposals bur I have no idea if he is serious about implementing them.  Like Bernie I knew was passionate about Healthcare, Julian Immigration, Elizabeth Wallstreet reform, Tulsi Foreign policy. Biden no idea.

Yeap unfortunately. I don't remember the last time our country was in such desolate and separatist state. I'm not necessarily pro-Trump, but I think that a Biden presidency will worsen the crime rates, homelessness, and lawlessness in general.
If this was a voter suppression conspiracy, why would they be warning people of a potential problem?  It also assumes that the mail-in votes will favor Biden.  What is the evidence?  Mailed ballots were already a problem in the primaries.  I smell a hoax.
I know the definition. That's my point. It still doesn't say "Biden is a tyrant". It says a cruel, oppressive ruler is a tyrant. It's very generalized and subjective. So if someone thought Trump was cruel and oppressive, then he is by definition a tyrant.
What‚Äôs Biden‚Äôs favorite cum town bit?
Biden &amp; Harris are going to restore justice. Tick Tock, Matt.
Has Biden or Obama done anything like this?
It was only political in pointing out the problem with the term "tyrant" because anyone can use that to justify their crime.   "I don't like Trump, he's a tyrant." Or "I don't like Biden, he's a tyrant."   What constitutes a tyrant that gives someone the right to then shoot them?

My biggest issue with the movement. I supported him because at least he was proposing progressive bills with Kamala and Markey. I‚Äôll vote for Biden to fight facism and harm reduction. But I also have faith in Kamala‚Äôs senate record to move Biden left. We aren‚Äôt all that naive.
I‚Äôm pragmatically voting for Biden-Harris for many reasons, but would really have preferred voting for someone without questions about their conduct toward women. You should be free to voice your valid concerns about him. Protecting freedom of speech is one reason he has my vote.
Biden isn‚Äôt proposing universal healthcare either. That‚Äôs the issue. The public option will still leave millions uninsured

This claim of a "Trump Bump" is nonsense. Strong economy was built from 2011 to 2017, trump maintained for  few years then ran the ship aground. Biden will have to clean up his mess.
Difference, Biden's were dropped. Not enough credible evidence. Trump's were settled, with children no less.
Oh sweets,  how vacant your mind must be to surpport Biden.    Been in Goverment for 48 years and his only accomplishment is enriching his family.  Don‚Äôt even get me started on Harris.
Ignore this. Pretend it‚Äôs Biden/Harris at 34%. The US can‚Äôt afford another 4 years of this guy.
In such a time where violence towards Americans is decried, looking at the record of Harris &amp; Biden, one should be appalled. Harris keeping innocent people in prison &amp; other crimes should be shown on corporate media, yet its not. Government should NOT be allowed to commit crimes.
Also weird to think Biden/Harris wouldn't be anti-sex trafficking, since Harris practically wrote the book on fighting sex trafficking.
Also a weird flex to call the guy who started his term with a Muslim ban, &amp; apparently gave his approval to Pres Xi to go ahead with his Uighur Muslim concentration camps, as being for religious freedom. And Biden, who is a faithful Catholic and regularly attends, isn't pro-God?
But you're not sure if you vote for Biden against the man who spits on your fathers grave. Great daughter you are
I definitely follow politics.  I‚Äôm just not brainwashed and deluded.  But since you seem to think Biden Who is deeply religious is anti religion you must not follow politics very closely.

I'm not Biden or Trump  #MyCampaignSlogan
Yep. Also it's a weird flex to say Trump, the dude who had at least 8 extramarital pregnancies ended with abortions, is "the most pro-life." When Biden/Obama literally oversaw one of the greatest declines in abortion rates in 30 years because they made birth control available.
People who live in a swing state/more competitive state should absolutely vote Biden. But I don't think we should urge people to vote blue no matter what in non-competitive states.
The problem is I don't see how we ever break the cycle. Say Biden wins on fear of Trump. The next election, the party and voters become complacent, some other right-wing nutbag wins a surprise victory, and we're right back where we started.
By reminding us of the fact that just a couple of months ago she mentioned that she believed Tara Reade‚Äôs allegations that Joe Biden sexually assaulted her. That will get the media off of the story that I called  a segregation sympathizing racist.
Biden is more religious than Trump, he‚Äôs a devout catholic who actually goes to church and knows the Bible. I think you will be fine..
"Biden‚Äôs choice of Harris heightens expectations for the vice presidential debate", says Hinckley Director Jason Perry as he weighs in on the recent announcement.  via
So while that might be true in swing states, I don‚Äôt think that this sentiment applies everywhere. Biden has an extremely slim chance of winning Utah. Isn‚Äôt voting for him here also not going to do anything and as much of an empty gesture as voting third party?

You should vote for Biden. He‚Äôs a good man and will serve us well. #BidenHarris2020
Lets get some activism then. But that is still no comparison to Trump who currently uses a man on his legal council that defended Epstein and that same lawyer raped an underage girl that was trafficked to him by Epstein.  Biden is better than Trump. Period.
Trump admits he's blocking postal cash to stop mail-in voting. For Democrats, Trump‚Äôs new remarks were a clear admission that the president is attempting to restrict voting rights. Biden said it was ‚ÄúPure Trump. He doesn‚Äôt want an election.‚Äù Trump=dictator!
See Biden as a "bridge" to a better future.
Trump admits he's blocking postal cash to stop mail-in votes, including the false claim that Democrats are seeking universal mail-in voting, specifically to gain an advantage in his November matchup against Joe Biden. EVIL MAN AND WANNABE DICTATOR!
This IS is our last stand, folks. But our fight is for the opposite of everything James Woods wants. We must fight against letting Trump transform our nation into an evil, fascist state forever. Vote for  life DOES depend upon it. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #Biden

Here‚Äôs a wild stat from the poll done in this article: 31% of people say they can trust information coming from the president. But somehow his approval rating is still above this at is 39% What?!?!
I would offer this counterpoint. The fact that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris is the DNC ticket is a far cry from accepting anarchists overtaking city blocks into the fold.
My issue is with understanding what their goal is. I've gotten a couple people to talk to me about it. It seems that for a lot of people, Biden having been accused of rape is a bridge too far. Harris' record with trans rights and hanging with CBP and ICE in general has them cold.

How ironic is Trump‚Äôs use of a train given that Biden famously commutes by Amtrak from Delaware while in congress and has consistently advocated for more funding for rail service?

thank you very much for putting no effort or critical thinking into your  you realize what a corrupt lifetime politician Joe Biden is? It is so scary that people like you, lazy, low IQ partisan hacks get to vote.

Biden is not against religious freedom. He is not opposed to you practicing your religion; he is opposed to people using their faith to discriminate against other groups. Trump says he is against abortion but that's it. He has said it, but he has done nothing about it.
You mean if I vote for biden it will turn the red state I live in blue? Didn‚Äôt know my little vote had so much power!

If you combine this with Biden shifting key views like climate farther left throughout the election process. Progressives should still have hope and be excited about this ticket. First and foremost is getting Trump out of office.
Kamala should get more credit from progressives. She supports a plan very close to Medicare 4 all and the green new deal. She has a very liberal record in the senate specifically. Biden could have done much worse. Harris is a big win for me üëç
Yo, Hear me out. Joe Biden wins the election, after some months in, he‚Äôs dead. Kamala is the next president
If only Kamala Harris were even a fraction as far left as Trump is trying to paint her. Meanwhile multiple Wallstreet execs recently breathed a sigh of relief as they saw Kamala as a sign that Biden/Harris is going to be a moderate ticket.
The way I see it is progressives can protest and get mad and try to push the party farther left after Biden/Harris are elected. Priority over anything else right now has to be getting Trump and Republicans out of the White House. Nothing else matters if that doesnt happen.

1. A 7-point Biden lead would be some tightening. 2. 9% undecided/other seems high for this race. 3. The other results in here do not imply that much if any of that 9% will break for Trump.

Biden can‚Äôt answer randonm questions.
The word ‚Äúdefund‚Äù is unfortunate because that is not really the goal. Biden stated several times that he does not support defunding police.  It‚Äôs simply a matter of deciding what reforms are needed (and where) to best protect citizens.
Can‚Äôt wait to hear LDS NeverTrumpers justify voting for Biden now since Kamala Harris supports late-term abortion &amp; blocked the Senate (twice!) from voting to protect babies born alive after botched abortions. She is also anti Catholic. The choice this November is clear.

Bulll Crap. Biden failed to give Welshman Kinnock credit during the convention speech, but was giving him credit to on previous speeches. By the way: Kinnock is supporting Biden.
Mainly because when it comes to actually lowering abortion #‚Äôs, Biden is the candidate. Access to affordable contraceptives is the single easiest way to curb abortions and Trump is against it. Plus, abortion is a legal issue, not a political one. No president can change that

And those it happens to become ineffective. Biden isn‚Äôt. He has shown time again his effectiveness and longevity. This will be his grand finale.
Yeah, he tweeted about the bus system in Ogden a few months ago. I think he had a Biden moment.
Would you be outraged if he was wearing a Biden hat? Asking for a friend.
Any #Canadian friends have some insights about me possibly moving to #Canada ??  -What's it like? -How's the weather? -How expensive/easy is healthcare or getting treated? -How is the housing situation? -Is #Trudeau better than Trump/Biden? Most importantly: -Will my cat like it?
The center-right should abandon Trump wholesale. Vote for Biden, vote third-party, or leave that part of the ballot blank. But when it comes to Republicans in the Senate, vote for all but the true Trumpists.
And it‚Äôs in a state‚Äôs best interest to keep someone in the Senate. The entire body is structured around seniority. Biden‚Äôs longevity is one of the reasons he accomplished so much.
The 2020 remake of Romeo and Juliet features a man from a Trump family falling for a woman canvassing for Biden.
How far left has the Democrat‚Äôs pendulum swung if Kamala Harris and Joe Biden are considered moderate within their part?
It‚Äôs Kamala. Or Mz. Harris if you‚Äôre nasty!  Biden/Harris 2020

Imagine thinking Biden isn‚Äôt viable. Family man. Non-Ivy Leaguer. Raised, lived, and worked in blue collar America. Over 30 years of experience in DC. History of bipartisanship and ability to get things done.

This Republican "suburban housewife" who lives in Utah,  will be voting for Joe Biden.
You can either be center-left or pander to the Twittergressives. Trying to do both just makes the Biden campaign look squishy.
What the Biden campaign probably THINKS it's doing is going with the safest pick that still gives a nod to the Sanders wing of the party.  But an ultra-progressive anchor is an ultra-progressive anchor, no matter how mainstream it looks.
Donald Trump is not her opponent.  Mike Pence is.   Well at least until they push Biden out but that won‚Äôt be until after the election.
Just did this and sure enough it goes directly to Joe Biden's site. WTF!!!
#Biden should make a fourth debate contingent on #Trump releasing his #taxes
Unlike yourself. However, we are all aware the Obama/Biden regime is responsible for the division. Nice try though.

There are plenty of reasons to vote for Trump and there are plenty of reasons to vote for Biden.
I think the two party system is trash and should be done away with. But it‚Äôs not, and Biden/Harris is still MILES better than 4 more years of Trump/Pence. King is swallowing his pride and getting on board. That shows some fiber, to me
He may be a hypocrite (I barely know who he is), but these screenshots aren‚Äôt examples of it. I suppose you think Bernie is a hypocrite for supporting Biden, as well? Or Hillary for supporting Obama?
I was a Warren supporter and didn‚Äôt like Biden or Harris. But now I‚Äôll enthusiastically support them, because Warren is no longer an option. That doesn‚Äôt make me a hypocrite and it doesn‚Äôt make King one either.
I don‚Äôt understand how people think this is a dunk? The first tweet was in 2018, before the campaign even started. OF COURSE he would have preferred candidates. But now that it‚Äôs set, OF COURSE he would support Biden and Harris.
Biden was just shown in a video riding a bike without a helmet on.   The precedent for his impending accident has been set.
Biden Wins Over Trump in 71 Percent Out of 40,000 Election Simulations, Forecast Shows - Newsweek  via
Column: Biden picks Kamala Harris. Trump should dump Mike Pence and replace him with a yacht.
Oh, is she having trouble deciding between Biden and Trump?  Makes sense now.
Lots of polling showed Democrats were really worried about a safe, electable pick. Many of the rank-and-file were leery (and there‚Äôs a lot of problematic stuff tied up in that) of a black woman at the top of the ticket.   With Biden anchoring the ticket those concerns went away.
It felt like there was a little veiled misogyny in the field as folks easily dismissed huge flaws in Biden and Bernie, but cancelled Harris and Klobuchar for being mean and Warren for being...uhh...prepared
Because she was getting crushed in the polls despite utterly mud-hole stomping everyone in the debates.  I think the Dem Primary was funny because they'd fail to vote for candidates and then lament them when they suspended. Then voted for Biden and now grump about him constantly
Because Dems dislike Biden even more?
Are we deciding whether to put Cheney back in the White House, or Biden? You know, arms to ISIS and Black men to prison Biden.
I still say if Biden had wanted to win hands down, he should have gone split-ticket with Condi Rice.
Why can‚Äôt we switch it up right now and make it a Harris/Biden ticket instead of Biden/Harris?
CNN is now pushing for Biden to step aside after he wins election. Apparently, his aides are pushing this too in his weak state. In his campaign announcement, he said she would be ready to lead the country. Hmmm.
If we know one thing about Biden, he'll definitely get behind her üòÆ
Biden/Harris thoughts for  and
My political prediction is this: if Biden and Harris win, in four years from now, 30% of the country will still be mispronouncing her first name.
Then also google The First Step Act, a bipartisan bill signed by Trump, which begins to reverse some of the effects of Biden‚Äôs bills. Obama and Biden had EIGHT YEARS and did nothing for minorities in prison, even when the Dems held both Houses
Appeal to a lot of Utahns? Who writes for KSL, a teenager? Does Harris still believe Biden is a racist who hung out with segregationists and does she still believe the women who accused Biden of sexual assault? Obviously üôÑ Biden can‚Äôt remember any of this.
I know, I got an actual ‚Äúburst‚Äù of euphoria when Biden announced his choice for VP!  There is so much hope for us....
The DNC's embrace of civil rights is relatively recent development &amp; one of political expediency only.  I'm still voting for Biden, but I'm not happy about it. lol
I mean If we are talking morally bankrupt I think Biden more fits the bill, corrupt as the day is long, supports abortion up to birth, the equality act (that would destroy church education) but yeah let‚Äôs not vote for the guy stopping those things... makes perfect sense
But you‚Äôre spending more time criticizing Biden and Kamala than Trump and Pence. No free pass is one thing, quite another is a circular firing squad of people with similar but not identical views sniping each other for their differences while their true enemies go unchallenged...
Mixed thoughts and emotions about Biden/Harris ticket. Still supporting them obviously.
According to D. L. Hughley in his book Surrender, White People! Kayne is an "honorary white guy" due to hanging out with Trump &amp; spouting crazy nonsense all the time. Black folks have given him to White people. I'm not worried he's going to take any votes from Biden.
There are a lot of smart women too. He isn't fooling any of us. Biden-Harris 2020! Can't wait!

Tulsi is such a beautiful, intelligent woman. Why did we, the actual left, get screwed all over again with Biden/Harris when we had incredible candidates like Tulsi, Bernie, and Andrew Yang.

Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate
Biden-Harris 2020! Save our country!
Biden could pick a table lamp as his running mate at this point and I would vote for him just to get the orange buffoon out of office.#Biden2020
Joe Biden picking Kamala as his running mate has sent a surge of excitement into my mind and body that I haven‚Äôt felt in a long time. Can‚Äôt wait to get about a bunch of lawn signs , bumper stickers, hats and tee shirts to share with like minded folks. Love this team. ‚ù§Ô∏è
I would vote for a rock before I‚Äôd vote for Trump.  Biden and Harris will bring sanity, dignity, and humanity, back to the executive branch. I‚Äôll vote blue and continue to press for progressive policies. #BidenHarris2020
There are a handful of people I would prefer to be president over Biden/Harris. There are hundreds of millions of people I would prefer to be president over Trump. November is going to be an easy choice.
question that is all on our minds - bigger JB: Justin Bieber (2011) or Joe Biden (2020)?
With this pick, it mostly seems like Biden just gave up in the fourth quarter, which the Jazz completely understands
President Trump won't have to campaign against Biden and Harris....all of the former democratic candidates have done that already. Soooo much material out there....all from democrats!
Biden and Kamala are far from radical left. üòÇ As far as I'm concerned, they're cops too.
If you vote for Biden, you‚Äôre really voting for Kamala
This could be the market starting to shift to the idea that Biden could get the seat. Kamala Harris was a great strategic pick by the Biden team as she is known to be more of a moderate dem that is very wall st friendly. Loosing the artificial mkt prop was the cause of the dump
I think  will make a kick-ass Senate Majority Leader. It wasn't good for the country to have two very old people on the democratic ticket, so I'm all in for Biden / Harris. Glad a decision has been made.
If you think you‚Äôll see riots if Biden doesn‚Äôt win????  I promise you it will be ten fold the violence in one day then you‚Äôre seen in 70+ KAMALTOEHARIES
This is what works for them - just throw out every possible attack, even if they are conflicting. Their base will never notice, they just glom on to the part they like. It‚Äôs time for everyone to get to work to elect Biden/Harris!

Tbh I tend to unfollow. Thinking we can pressure Biden is ridiculous on so many levels
Honestly it doesn't matter who is choice was. I will be voting for Biden. With that being said, I like the choice.
No opinion.  Just wish we could get rid of Biden.
give up. that was only possible with bernie. Biden has no such crossover appeal to Mexican voters.
To be Biden‚Äôs bitch I mean VP?
Bernie needs to hire the top 10 funniest humans on Earth to help him write the ultimate roast of all time, for the DNC &amp; Biden, as well as the GOP, Trump, &amp; the whole political duopoly. Since he's probably not going to be alive long enough to be president after this, send it hard
Also not to mention the First Step Act, a pipaerisan bill signed by Trump, which reversed part of Biden‚Äôs racist 1994 Crime bill that doubled incarceration of black men.
Not to mention ISIS, which rose under Obama and Biden backing down to Russia and Syria, was squashed in a matter of weeks under Trump
Trust me Biden will have him removed. The military is not loyal to a President if Biden says remove yam tits, yam tits will be removed.
There's a difference between it being his house, which it isn't, and being the house he temporarily lives in. Biden owns his home. Trump DOES NOT own the White House.
I believe this would be extortion. What he thinks people are too enamored of him to notice is that those programs get funded when Biden is sworn in as president.
Donald Trump could pack $1 trillion in a suitcase and take it home when his second term is over and it would still be less costly and a better deal for America than the Green New Insanity and the Democrats  march toward socialism that would happen under Biden.
1 biden yard sign
The market will remain bullish as long as Donald Pumpy is in office. IF (big if) Biden somehow takes the seat, I think we are in for a nasty mean reversion. I think we are currently pricing in a Trump victory, so some back door puts may present cheap premiums
I drive for a living &amp; have only seen 1 Biden yard sign in my blue city
It'll give Conservatives something to howl and scream about, after Biden wins and has to reinstate the taxes. Talk about snowflake tears...
I'm gonna need a shower after voting for Biden.
Sinclair story. Trump has made so many racist comments that pointing at Biden is grasping at straws
Biden‚Äôs cognitive decline worsens every day. His family needs to step in and stop this presidential run. This is senior citizen abuse.
Trump is offering payday loans, but Biden will be stuck with the job of getting everybody to pay the money back.
Checks with his giant signature on them.   Just about any previous President would have been been more capable in this situation. As for Biden selling the country to China?  You know our trade deficit with them is larger now than ever. Trump personally owes China $400,000,000.00!
I'm not going to fucking vote for Biden
It shouldn‚Äôt be depleted at all!  That‚Äôs why we need Biden to save it!
That‚Äôs why we have to get Biden in to save Social Security!  My husband and I are receiving all of our social security benefits that we have earned.  The govt. has to quit borrowing from it!
From the horse‚Äôs mouth ‚ÄúChina would prefer Joe Biden.‚Äù ü§î And you wonder why people question the timing of the Wuhan virus and the shutdown of USA economy and the mainstream media discussing the only way Trump would lose the election if America would go into another recession.

I do have empathy for Biden‚Äôs cognitive decline. It gets worse every day. By November he will be a zombie. His family needs to step in and stop this. It is elder abuse.

It's like we're about to see who can fuck with the US more by the outcome of this election. I don't know much about hacking, but if it comes down to Chinese hackers vs. Russian bots; Biden should have this in the bag.
1/3 of NRA members are democrats. Guess they won‚Äôt be voting for Biden.
What you just said is the definition of a racist. Joe Biden is a racist.
Biden/Monster would make an incredible ticket!!!
In an ideal world, Donald Trump would have a massive heart attack that kills him on stage during a debate with Joe Biden. In front of a live audience, answering some question with some completely made-up bullshit lie, he just drops the fuck dead? Wouldn't that be something?
Yeah I think the supremacist and nazi are out in full force supporting trump. I dont see them marching for Biden. Try again.
But I thought trump was winning? So basically the gop has to run 2 candidates against biden cause you know this whole trumpism is coming down. Get your shit together.
Yo,  are you one of the traitors working with Russia to get Trump re-elected?My farm in Oregon is 100% BIDEN HARRIS!!! Yippee üòÅ
Why do I get the sense that the Des News and KSL are almost daily campaigning for the DNC.  No questioning Biden and Harris‚Äôs far left views??  Come to the middle ground please.
Just about everything the DNC and Biden stand for are about as far as you can get from the retored Gospel of Jesus ChristüôÑ.   I can‚Äôt imagine voting for that platform.

I‚Äôm busy. Sorry. I‚Äôm working a phone bank for for Republicans supporting Biden. I never no interest in what will fall from your lying lips.
I think Trump looks 10 years older than Biden , and he can just barely stay awake long enough to call Biden ‚ÄúSleepy Joe‚Äù
Senile Biden picked her to place blame on when he loses.
Did he suggest he is going to fuck Biden and Harris?
My My, Hey Hey, Rock and roll is here to stay (and so is Daddy Trump) It's better to burn out, Than to fade away (Biden) da da Trump, da da Trump, da da Trump Trump Trump We love Trump, Yay!!!!!!!
It seemed like they picked her to take the seat when biden inevitiably becomes unfit mentally
That‚Äôs EXACTLY what the stall is‚ÄîWhen he sees he isn‚Äôt getting elected, the funds will disappear and he‚Äôll blame Biden stating that HE could‚Äôve saved us. Pathetic and infantile brainwork.
Nancy you are so smart and never lose your cool, I think that is why Republicans hate you. Keep it up, Trump is half asleep, slurring his words calling Biden Sleepy Joe, you can see that Trump is desperate
The Biden/Harris ticket is so superior to Trump/Pence. They should not even be in the same election
Which is exactly what Biden said about Universal healthcare so I‚Äôm flummoxed as to your point. Didn‚Äôt your mom ever teach you that you catch more flies with honey than vinegar? I‚Äôm about done with your veiled insults. You want to be right. I want to be effective.
USPS, step it up and get it done. be one of the hero's in this   covid season as well as the election. headline "biden/harris win in a landslide-usps delivered all ballots on time."
Exactly! If Bernie were our nominee I sure wouldn‚Äôt be demonizing him right now. This has to work so let‚Äôs roll up our sleeves and make some change!
My ex is Australian. I‚Äôm sure it isn‚Äôt perfect but it worked really well for him and his family. My parents are on Medicare and it‚Äôs far from perfect. Surely, the greatest country of all time can come up with something better.
I absolutely agree with this ‚ÄúCorporate influence doesnt belong in the platform or our  healthcare‚Äù but there is an advantage to public/private partnerships. I like Australia‚Äôs healthcare system.
It wasn‚Äôt because of media. People are scared. Stop telling people they are sheep for voting for Biden. There is no way we can go from the far right mess we are in now to a far left agenda and not terrify people.

If 90% wanted it then Bernie would have won the nomination.
I hope. In the meantime, a show of solidarity would come a long way in bringing the party together. It doesn‚Äôt have to mean compromising your integrity. We can still hold the moderate dems feet to the fire.
People are creatures of habit. They don‚Äôt understand this can actually be done. Let‚Äôs keep pushing Joe but not lose the majority of the democratic base by scaring them. Let‚Äôs show them how even differences won‚Äôt come between us and that we are committed to change.
And encouraging him to continue that progress into the presidency. And then showing the party that we are going to come together to make real change in this country?  It‚Äôs a missed opportunity just to posture.
This is the point. We all need to come together. Joe wasn‚Äôt my pick. But politics are designed to demonize the opponent. We have to come together. Wouldn‚Äôt it have been nice if Ro had thanked Joe for being willing to come to the table with Bernie to move the platform forward....
And clearly I‚Äôm too fired up to type - ‚Äúhactially‚Äù???
This doesn‚Äôt do that. It doesn‚Äôt incentivize Joe. Sitting down and coming up with the best plan to move the country that direction does. I want universal health care. I work in public health. I lost my 39 year old brother to cancer last year. He had no insurance which delayed tx
Joe is a good person and hactially has a verifiable history of implementing policy change. We don‚Äôt come together by purity bashing.
Biden could run on a platform to dismantle the USPS and Democrats would fall in line and try to justify it just because he isn't Trump.  Change my mind.
Which Biden has adopted much of.... so what is the purpose of this? Nothing except to showboat. It doesn‚Äôt change one thing except give the GOP talking points about infighting.
Perhaps he should listen to his idol. Huh? Talk about insufferable.
I remember you calling someone a "petulant child" because they indicated they won't be voting for Biden.  Pot, meet kettle.
Why should I talk about Trump if we both know how bad he is?  You seem to be stuck under the illusion that Biden is not also a White supremacist corporte extremist. He already promised nothing will fundamentally change and that he will go after "anarchists."
Okay. So the words and actions of the DNC are lockstep with the GOP, and Biden is a right-wing corporate extremist. And you are just gunna go along with it and tell the rest of us to lick the boot with you.  No. Thanks.
While ignoring, entirely, that Biden will perpetuate the Oligarchy and trying to sell him as the most progressive candidate in history (hahahahaha no)  Maybe try being honest.
Its time to replace the traitorist fake Republicans with real Republicans. Non-sychophants to Trump. I'm voting for Biden just to get that traitor out.
I‚Äôm gop too I talk all the time to some great democrats. And through those conversations I see what teump and his supporters are snd will be voting Biden/Harris.

Hearing he is going to prosecute Former President Obama and Former Vice President Biden and Obama for treason for spying on him...
Other. I‚Äôm not voting for either Biden or Trump. I‚Äôll likely go third party or write in. Unsure of who as of now. I refuse to pick for the lesser of two evils and the only way to make a third option viable down the road is to start voting for them now.
Friendly reminder that Biden‚Äôs entire reason for opposing #M4A is literally ‚Äúmy family is rich and we still faced hardship so fuck the poors‚Äù
No, but I'd wait 8 hours in line to keep Biden out.
No. There are plenty of reasons Harris and Biden are awful without resorting to this shit.
Harris just showed why Biden chose her
Well, maybe if you manned up and stayed in the running things could have been different. No one wants Joe Biden.
That‚Äôs silly that‚Äôs Joe Biden and his bladder control issue.
Dude voting for Biden/Harris isn‚Äôt about fixing every problem the Trump administration caused. It‚Äôs literally about getting them out of office. That‚Äôs the FIRST step and the ONLY way we can even BEGIN to clean this gd mess up.
I am hoping that he gets beaten so bad that he cant claim he actually won probably about 75% of the vote going to Biden
things that have made me cry today-  3 different tiktoks  The 2nd page of a book I started reading  And a video of Joe Biden where you can see that he has a heart emoji next to his wife‚Äôs name in his phone
Biden did not even know who his.vice president was because the left told him who to pick
President Trump 2020 for keeping America Great!! What has happened to our country and the world is not President Trump‚Äòs fault or mine or Joe Biden‚Äòs it is China virus ü¶† that‚Äôs why we are sick üò∑ Stan together quit fighting and keep America great.üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
Glad to see a woman on the ticket for VP. Joe Biden marked history in so many ways! Joe you are every woman‚Äôs hero forever! Your legacy will live on forever! Now let‚Äôs kick out Chump and Pence so that we can get much done! Let‚Äôs unite, do right &amp; make America better.
Absolutely! If anything, the blame is on the DNC for splitting the left vote. Most of the left was NEVER going to vote Biden or Harris, regardless. Bernie was the compromise for many on the left.
Ok never mind, i figured it out.... But dont get your hopes up, it will never happen. Mondale chose Ferraro, McCain chose Palin and Clinton ran as a female candidate against Trump and that failed. So I highly doubt that Biden will win. Trump will be a 2 time President.
imma bring this back bc y‚Äôall workin my nerves lol just bc Biden/Harris isn‚Äôt our first choice doesn‚Äôt mean we shouldn‚Äôt vote?! Lmao y‚Äôall the same ppl that failed 16yr old me 4yrs ago by writing in harambe .
Congratulations on being  pick!  I am a independent center right voter usually, but you and Joe Biden will be who I vote for.  Looking forward to you and President Biden re-uniting our torn and divided country.

Wrong. We ‚Äúsuburban housewife‚Äôs‚Äù are a myth you generated in your pea brain. We women are educated, co equals in our families, raise children and bring in the bacon. We‚Äôre voting Biden Harris.
Lol do you think Biden and Harris do?
Thanks to Biden picking Kamala Harris for VP, I get to drag my Viking name out of the closet. An AOL-era edgelord irritated that he couldn't get a rise or his way from a woman in tech support dubbed me Amanda the Nasty. It's been a thing insecure guys do for decades. #nastywoman
Ya trump is an asshole but the media barely even focuses on the actual shit he does wrong They care more about 2 scoops and his verbal gaffs than kids in cages because if u trace the kids in cages back just a few years you start seeing Obama and Biden‚Äôs signatures on everything
Unlike trump, Biden has reading skills!!
Who had the diaper duty today when you learned you and Mikey are up against Biden/Harris?
Joe Biden made the laws in California? Weird.
News flash... Biden dodged the draft 5 times too
Biden is a racist and kamala doesnt care that minorities are filling prisons for petty crime.
at work this lady pulled out her phone to look up one of her rewards and then she went ‚Äúoh look Joe Biden selected Kamala Harris as his running mate‚Äù and i kind of just stood there like
Everyone knows Biden is a racist
Kamala Harris and sleey Joe Biden are an improvement on Mike Pence and sleazy Don Trump-I can see the debate now and Pence had better wear dark pants, because it won‚Äôt look so bad when he pees his pants
Chief, if you like minorities you should not be happy about kamala and bidenüòÇ
I'll go with Jill Biden
If you‚Äôre voting based on qualifications alone you should absolutely vote for Biden/Harris over Trump/Pence.
This is what cracks me up about Rs on my timeline freaking out over Biden, and now Harris. They're like the two most centrist candidates of the bunch, not named Bloomberg.
Fukushima news ;; Biden Picks anti-Nuclear Energy Kamala Harris VP Kevin...  via
People will respect the average older person with mental illness, Biden has been a corrupt politician who consistently throws rocks (metaphorically) at political opponents.  He‚Äôs not an innocent old guy.
Biden‚Äôs a dirty old man
The only question now is how long Biden will be in office before the Democrats compassionately invoke the 25th Amendment. Days? Weeks?
Kamala Harris prosecuted over 1,500 people for possessing marijuana as attorney general in California. She also seems to have flip flopped on her previous accusations of Biden being racist. She is running with the man who supported the 1994 crime bill...
The dichotomy between leftists and liberals in my circle on the Biden pick is stark:   Liberals: I love this ticket! Let's beat Trump!   Leftists: Hahahahahahahaha
It really makes very little difference. Trump and Pence are ogres. Biden and Harris will smile nicely as they fuck you over. They're all cut from the same cloth, and none of them will be running the country anyway.
That's of little comfort to the millions Biden and the cop will continue to fuck over.
Biden/Harris....I think it's a win..
Mmmmm Joe ‚ÄúCrime Bill‚Äù Biden and Kamala ‚ÄúThe Cop‚Äù Harris. Now that‚Äôs a dynamic duo of #resistance! üìé
I am offended: Trump thinks that men are upset because Joe Biden is selecting a woman, for Vice President. there are many good men that joe could have picked but the women on the list are all more qualified than them. I think all women should be upset about this
I truly think that Biden will pick Susan Rice as his running mate.  She has worked closed to him for 8 years and has all the experience we need right now, in this country and outside this country.
And the next President of the United States is (insert Biden VP pick here).
I agree. I also see why they‚Äôre having him speak: it‚Äôs not like Biden has ever been one to buck tradition.
Politics and culture in this era: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and The Making of the President 1972:
Apparently Biden does.  But you‚Äôre more ticked off Biden showed he‚Äôs fit, and trump is not
Biden has three things going for him:   1. He‚Äôs not Trump. 2. He hung out with Obama for eight years.  3. Coronavirus, major unrest, and Trump being Trump keeps the focus off him, potentially making ‚Äúrunning out the clock‚Äù to Election Day a viable strategy.
If the GOP was running practically ANYONE else I‚Äôd be all in. Romney, Rubio, heck, even Pence would be fine, because it‚Äôs just unimaginable to me that anyone would think Biden would be a great President. Sorry.
Whooooo! Biden-Imminent 2020!
I will vote for  Biden. PERIOD!!
Meanwhile in the Biden household
Joe Biden disqualify him for the White House so we can keep President Trump for 4 more years
The implication of your statement is that Biden couldn't/wouldn't govern with people who attacked him or tried to upstage him. I sure hope that's not true.
Thank you!
Talk about a complete joke, if your blind you could make these claims, but for the rest of us that watch any Biden video can see it plane as day.
Won't have any investment goals if Biden wins! Market crash

Ma‚Äôam, with all due respect, the republican party is the party that got us this mess of a president. I don‚Äôt think america would necessarily be voting for biden if it were literally any other less divisive republican.
Libs: "If you dont vote for Biden you are a racist!"   *Joins the #PeoplesConvention for a People's Party*  Libs:
So Biden will cancel Religion? Wow that‚Äôs pretty ballsy of him.
He arranged for the impasse on purpose so he could claim this ‚Äúgift to the people‚Äù for his own. If Biden were smart, he‚Äôd announce his VP pick tomorrow and suck all the air out of this stunt... which works bc he promised to announce this week, anyway.
It‚Äôs interesting that we can‚Äôt afford a payroll tax cut but we could afford free college and free healthcare according to Bernie and AOC? Wonder if Biden thinks we can afford those?
What is the impact of Biden‚Äôs VP choice on the race?  Or How do you keep your eyes open during a picture? (I seem to always blink on the snap)
You're so desperate and full of fear knowing that you're down the road in November that you stay awake at night thinking of ridiculous lies about  Biden. No one with a brain believes your bullshit.
No Wrist Corsages, Please
Lets not forget Biden's "Poor Kids are just as bright as white kids" quote or his wonderful "7-11/Dunkin Donuts" quote.
Jerry Falwell Jr., Newt Gingrich, Donald J. Trump-adulterous men. Fierce believers in the Bible, all pretend they love God. Joe Biden first wife died in a a car crash, still married to his 2nd wife goes to church regularly, really loves God-what kind of God would not favor Biden?
Because Biden wants to do push ups, his mind is not right
