Can you believe that they are seeing Rice is a liar? Compared to who Donald Trump?
Ron Wright remains favored heading into 2020 without a doubt, but it‚Äôs not difficult to see him being booted out. If Biden wins or even narrowly loses Texas, this district could be in danger of flipping to Trump, in which case Wright would be in serious trouble.
When the Affordable Care Act was originally designed it required ALL insurance to cover everyone regardless of preexisting conditions. Ironically Trump, in attempting to dismantle "Obamacare" removed this requirement changing ACA into the useless mess it is.
I agree on both counts. And may I add...what the fuck? Is Trump a fucking Captain Planet villain?
My husband is a manager for the Census. In my opinion, the employees are placed in a situation where it is impossible to get an accurate count in this condensed time frame. The Census Bureau is being held hostage to Trump‚Äôs politics and the whole country will suffer as a result.

The US Census announced that it will halt all counting efforts for the 2020 census on Sept. 30, a month sooner than planned, drawing objections from civil rights groups and Democrats who say the Trump administration is trying to deliberately undercount poor people and immigrants.
An elderly Florida man arrested for drunk-driving a golf cart blamed his intoxication on watching President Trump give a coronavirus briefing. Cary DeVan, 82, told officers he ‚Äúgot really mad at what [Trump] said‚Äù and started drinking vodka.

Trump is the most corrupt, self-serving individual ever to occupy the Presidency. He talks big, but delivers little, and while you are listening in awe to his lies, he picks your pocket.
Another Trump friend, too. Shocking.
Use of or installation of the app is already prohibited on Government devices. Restriction imposed be agency IT security. Happened way before Trump had even heard of TikTok. It may compromise user privacy, but that‚Äôs not really a Government concern unless banking is threatened.

Bullshit. Trump has no authority to ban TikTok. If I am wrong, please correct me, but I think Congress would have to pass a law to force ISPs to filter content and Apple an Google to remove it. There may be reasons to do so but Trump cannot do anything.
Time to take down Trump and #PutinsGOP.
Talk about October surprises ‚Äî what about the big reveal of turning Rachel Maddow loose on what Deutsche Bank has on Trump.
If MS falls for that, they are as stupid as Trump. He cannot ban TikTok, nor can he force its sale. TikTok is a private entity used by private individuals. China and other totalitarian or corrupt states do shit like this but so far it is not done here.
the darker part is that they convinced people like you trump is not a problem.
Let's hope so. Putin's boys are hard at work to hurt Joe Biden and Trump Toadies like Ron Johnson and Lady G are in on it I'm sure
I should add that he has no authority to either ban TikTok or force its sale, much less take a cut. He can ban the app from Government devices. This was done months ago by agency OCIOs without input from Trump.
Time to take down Trump and #PutinsGOP.  Ron Johnson and his Sycophant Ruby Red Righties in the Senate better watch out playing footsie with the Russians  and let us not forget Lady G.

No. Trump has set us back decades.
They are trying to prevent Trump from spreading lies. While I realize that you and your fellow Republicans need lies to hide behind, the rest of us need the truth in order to make good decisions.. You should take a moment out and read my father‚Äôs message.
yeah I didn‚Äôt mean to shame anyone who wasn‚Äôt following him. but I remember seeing a facebook post that was like ‚Äúremove all these people from your friends list‚Äù and it linked to all your friends who liked or followed trump on fb...which is so stupid.
Except that every one of his statements is wrong. The Virus is not under control. We know what to do, but thanks to #OrangeusDumbasseous we are not doing it. As to exponential growth, predictions were made but ignored with Trump insisting that coronavirus will just ‚Äúdisappear.‚Äù
i find it very concerning that very few of my friends actually follow Trump on twitter.
Dear Susan, you let your country down. Your epic failure to your constitutional oath has led us down a path of death and lawlessness. You do not deserve one more day as a senator serving the American people. You made your choice to serve Donald Trump. Now we will make ours.
And that screed right there puts you squarely in the GOP/Trump cult. You're in a cult. I cannot stress this enough. You. Are. In. A. Cult.
President Trump, I have been Republican since I could first vote many many elections ago. I have support you, however if you band TicTok I will vote independent this coming election.
At an International Space University  alumni conference webinar, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine is asked about Trump‚Äôs NASA tweet earlier this week. ‚ÄúWe are getting it going again,‚Äù he says of NASA, adding that agency was ‚Äúdemoralized‚Äù after Constellation was canceled.
Trump made masks a political thing. You get to own that.
Trump has the largest ego in the world
I feel exactly the same way about Trump himself.  Shame on everyone enabling this old, mentally handicapped man who just happens to be racist, and also just happens to have been elected President while losing the popular vote (and happens to have been unsuccessfully impeached).
You think it's a game to Fauci but not to Trump. This is what being in a cult looks like.
Pays Donald royalties for use of the Trump label.
Just saw two tiktok video's where the speakers both claimed Obama is behind the covid pandemic. He created and distributed it. My question is whether they are your everyday Trump idiots, or guys getting paid by Russia or China to spread stupid nonsense. Just curious.
I have been doing that, since the day he met Trump!
Donald Trump gives zero shits about the lower and middle class.
Trump will fire Barr sooner or later. Barr will say something he disagrees with, and they will both hold their ground.
It‚Äôs a toxic mix of low intelligence and cruel indifference to human suffering.  Being cognitively impaired does not, by itself, a Trump supporter make.  You have to be both ‚Äústupid‚Äù AND mean.  (Or a psychopath willing to exploit stupidity and meanness in others.)

Honestly, I feel the same way about Donald Trump.
Seriously: if there is a God that can be hurt by a living person, one of those living people is unquestionably Donald Trump.
I‚Äôd stand in line for days if I needed to to vote for Trump!
If Trump had any reason to KNOW that it was pronounced one way then we could cut him some slack. But we have no evidence of him pronouncing foreign words the way the foreigners do.
There must-needs be an audio Trump dictionary.
If you vote Democrats you hate yourself and your family heritage. There will be no more America. Stop hating Trump. WAKEUP!

Forsyth County, Georgia (an Atlanta exurb) had a big swing left in 2016, going from Romney+63 to Trump+47. Expect another enormous swing left this cycle. It‚Äôs changing more and more every day.

Trump doesn‚Äôt understand how pro-gun the radical left is
Trump does Executive orders that affect #TikTok, #WeChat, and Chinese pharmaceutical makers. #TikTok, #WeChat are security risks to your personal data.  You may want to stop using.
I'm guessing it has something to do with the "TikTok teens humiliate Trump in Tulsa" headlines. Because apparently a bunch of teens registered to go to inflate numbers and posted videos about it on TikTok.
Democrats‚Äô best area in TN-04 is Rutherford County, home to rapidly growing Murfreesboro. They‚Äôll likely narrow the gap a bit from 2018, but Trump‚Äôs 41% margin of victory in TN-04 last time means they have just about no prayer at cracking this nut.
After he gassed protesters so he could hold the Bible upside down and by the way... the leaders of the church were physically, forcibly  removed from the church. Trump paid for abortions for women he impregnated!
How much is this EO worth? Follow the money (and tickets to maga Tulsa rally by teenagers using TikTok). They played a prank on trump so now he‚Äôs at war with TikTok . Next round to the teenagers...

Donald trump failed to be a leader in so many ways.
I was in PA recently. I saw Trump signs too, mostly put up by those who may be turning their front lawns and properties into Trump shrines to give the impression that his support in PA is wider than polls show.  Trump‚Äôs support may be deep, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it is wide.

Good - I want Trump gone. That doesn't remove what Biden said. He thinks the black community isn't diverse and is a monolith in thought and action. It's an embarrassing thing to say for a 2020 candidate, along with his #BLM response being to increase police funding. What a joke.

Trump will obviously still win the state massively. But I think Hillary‚Äôs performance there was uniquely terrible, bordering on bottom-of-the-barrel.
I think there were a lot of people in Louisville and Lexington who voted Trump because they always voted R historically but will switch to D in large numbers. Big room for growth there. Plus, northern Kentucky will move left markedly as well (Cincinnati). Rurals Trump will crush.
Trump will win Kentucky by double digits but I can easily be convinced his margin there will be less than 20.

TALK ABOUT VACCINE BY NOVEMBER IS OUTRAGEOUS!   IT'S MORE THAN AN OUTRIGHT LIE, TRUMP IS USING THE DESPERATION OF THIS NATION CITIZENS AS A POLITICAL TOOL TO GAIN VOTES BY GIVING THEM FALSE HOPE!  BRIBERY!  A MORALLY CORRUPT POLITICAL LIE TO TURN AROUND A FAILING CAMPAIGN!
Yet, it‚Äôs ok for  to vote by mail. And it‚Äôs ok for  to vote 11 times by mail. Over half of Trump‚Äôs administration has voted in elections by mail in ballot. But, when people who are registered voters want to stay safe and vote, it‚Äôs a Democrat fraud!
This an absolutely crazy rant. Trump‚Äôs losing it. I hope he loses it completely and ends the living hell he‚Äôs been causing for Americans.
You need to lose power until after the election if you plan to vote for trump
How many time have we see u cry on TV because trump is destroying USA,  how many time have u complained about trump enablers  ? You're showing your true color
President Donald J Trump was correct and mail in ballots are disqualified !
Both my parents are conservatives (my dad is literally an NR subscriber), and my home precinct, town, and school district all voted for Bush/McCain/Romeny/Trump by like 30% apiece. I assure you, I grew up around conservatives too
Anyone voting for Trump is ignorant
Dems do not have full control. Republicans are not holding Trump accountable.
I keep having a nightmare that in a strange way that we could be greater as result of Trump. Just not the way he planned it. Plus tom Cruise is in it and we are filming Valkyrie 2.
I know there‚Äôs no bottom, and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll get worse. But for somebody with such a questionable relationship with the Bible to something like this. There are few things more gross.
Oh Joe, you forgot to say, ‚ÄòI won‚Äôt lie as much as Trump does‚Äô. I might vote for you but I won‚Äôt be thrilled to do so as I would with Bernie.
Trump is a terrible judge of who to hire and endorse.
Oh BTC, I fear that I will vote once more, not not for my choice but for the lesser of two evils. I wish I could trust Biden. I know I can‚Äôt trust Trump
They couldn‚Äôt bring back Jim Crow and McCarthyism so, Trump had to do.
Trump=POS, so tired of his opinions. Younger people with more wisdom than he can conceive of like AOC inspire my admiration says 73 year old supporter of AOC &amp; other progressives.
Trump whose mind is generally somewhat North of THIGH-land. POS in my opinion
Disappointed it wasn't finally putting Trump away
I‚Äôll wait while in a 24 hr line, in freezing cold temperatures being whipped and beaten while having to listen üëÇüèæ demonic music üé∂ to Vote üó≥ trump ass out of office.. it‚Äôs that bad.. there‚Äôs no situation that can be put forward for me not to vote his ass out. He gotta go! Period
I am ready to hear YOUR national strategy Herr Schumer, along with these very fine whiners chiming in...how about a national shutdown, (then Trump is a dictator), how about mandatory masking(Trump is taking away constitutional rights), more tests, let's test 350 million daily
The saying ‚ÄúGod, guns, and gays‚Äù represents what a lot of Trump supporters believe to be important issues.  It must seem insane in a non-crazy country like Sweden.
what a couple of feckless and degenerate pathologically lying, traitorous republican pieces of shit! #FuckTrump #FuckDucey #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
There's basically two possibilities - Trump is a pedo &amp; that's why he was hanging out with Epstein, or Trump hates pedos &amp; that's why the Epstein &amp; Ghislane arrests have happened on his watch. I don't blame anyone for picking one side over the other, the lies are thick as soup.
Those are photos of Trump with his  daughter.
This is being shared around a lot. This was her quote.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying who I‚Äôm voting for, but I‚Äôm not voting for Trump.‚Äù
DESPERATE  IS MAKING COVID VACCINE POLITICAL - LURING VOTERS WITH FALSE CLAIMS OF A COVID VACCINE BY NOV 3!  LIES BY AN IGNORANT QUACK WHO IGNORES SCIENCE &amp; HAWKS DANGEROUS &amp; UNPROVEN CURES.  LISTEN TO EXPERTS - EARLIEST IS NEXT YEAR.  TRUMP WILL IGNORE SAFETY FOR A VOTE.
very simply... #FuckTrump #FuckGOP #FuckNRA
I have a feeling they are connected and that investigating Trump lead them to the NRA and the "in" they needed to get the evidence for taking them down.
#joebiden through things like the crime bill and attempts to cut social security has had more agency in his 50 years then #trump ever could in two terms. As horrible as Trump's message is, he just doesn't think on the level of someone like #mikepence who is a true believer.
I think the issue is honestly deeper then that. I'm no fan of #trump since I'm  a progressive but the truth is that #joebiden is Not the lesser of two evils. Sure Trump is horrible but at the end of the day he's only a gradient of what we've been doing for decades with no mask
FOX IS COMPLETELY OVERBOARD ON BEING AGAINST CONSERVATIVES! SANDRA  IS ALWAYS BITCHING ABOUT TRUTHFUL STATEMENT MADE BY PRES TRUMP! SANDRA IS LIKE JUAN WILLIAMS, BIASED FOR DEMS AND USE THEIR POSITION TO BE POLITICALLY INCORRECT! NEVER HEARD SANDRA SAYS BAD ABOUT OBAMA
SANDRA IS COMPLETELY COMBATIVE ON ALL THINGS THAT PRES TRUMP SAYS! WASH POST JUST RETRACTED A FALSE STORY WITH AN APOLOGY? NO I DON'T THINK SO. PRES TRUMP FOLLOWS THE DOCTORS AND LORD FAUCI TO THE EXACT WORDS OF DOCTORS. TWITTER IS THE OFFICIAL AND WORK APPROVER?
Vote Trump out.
To all of you Second Amendment loyalists. Remember it was during the Trump Administration that the NRA was sued by the NY SAG. Your assault rifle buying and hoarding rights are next! Hooray!!!
Donald Trump Jr. takes on Twitter censorship, Biden campaign on 'Watters' World' |
Trump will cooperate if he thinks Ivanka is in trouble. The others could rot.
Literally cannot fathom how anyone could watch that trump axios interview and think he did even an ok job. What the actual fuck??
Regrettably, the GOP response might well be ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs not _our_ kid.‚Äù Trump &amp; the GOP feel there‚Äôs no sacrifice too great that *WE* can undertake, but seen from the WH &amp; DC, we‚Äôre abstractions, at best.
BIDEN IS AFRAID OF PRES TRUMP! HIS ONLY REASON FOR NOT DEBATING PRES TRUMP! AMERICAN PEOPLE DESIRE DEBATES.
GATES IS WORKING AND PAYING BIG MONEY TO FOX, CNN, ABC, CBS FOR HIS OWN PATENTS ON CORONA VIRUS! THERE IS A LOT OF MONEY SPENT BY GATES AND AGAINST HCQ! PRES TRUMP HAS BEST IDEAS TO KILL VIRUS AND BETTER HEALTH CARE THAN FAUCIE
You mean not like the strip mall doctor/voodoo priestess Trump is replacing Fauci with?
He's right in that a lot of people liked the Swan interview. But none of them are going to vote for Trump.
SANDRA OF FOX DAILY NEWS  IS AN OPERATIVE OF THE DEM SOCIALIST PARTY FOR BIDEN! SHE IS BIASED AGAINST PRES TRUMP AND AMERICA TO PROMOTE HER OWN VIEWS AGAINST PRES TRUMP AND SHOULD BE SUED AND FIRED! SHE IS NO GOOD FOR AMERICA IN SUPPORT OF MOBS! HER SUPPORT W/SICK TWITTER
Twitter temporarily banned Trump campaign from tweeting, claiming they shared a false video about COVID-19
There were 250 million eligible voters in the 2016 election. 29% voted for Clinton, 28% voted for Trump, 39% did not vote.
you constipated ass face your no better than hen Trump you keep blocking shit we need you dumb fuck this is your last term
I did, but poor reading comprehension led me to miss "...the election would be thrown to the U.S. House, where 26 states have a majority-GOP delegation. Meaning that Trump would get re-elected."   I stand corrected!
Because the investigation into Trump has nothing to do with the election, right?
That bird looks like Donald Trump when he wakes up every morning and forgets to put on his toupee.
Barr is writing a new memo criminally protecting Trump for whatever is coming.
Democrats and Republicans push back on Trump‚Äôs desire to deliver convention speech from White House - What about the Hatch Act? The WH is Federal NOT private property. IQ45 makes up his own rules since 1/20/2017
TRUMP IS A NATIONAL SECURITY NIGHTMARE!  THE LATEST BEING UNFOIUNDED STATEMENT THAT THE EXPLOSION IN LEBONON WAS A BOMB!  SUCH IGNORANCE FROM  HAS STRATEGIC SHORT &amp; LONG TERM NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON OUR INTELLIGENCE REPUTATION &amp; GLOBAL MILITARY/NATIONAL SECURITY RESPONSES
IS USING HIS OFFICE ILLEGALLY FOR POLITICAL GAIN.  HIS ACCUSATIONS OF MASSIVE FRAUD IN MAIL IN VOTING IS FALSE!   BUT SUDDENLY HE'S REVERSED HIS POSITION IN FL! ONE REASON ONLY = A STATE HE HAS TO WIN IN NOV!    MORE TRUMP LIES = MAIL IN VOTING IS ONLY GOOD IN GOP STATES!
IS ILLEGALLY USING HIS OFFICE FOR POLITICAL GAIN.    HE HAS AGREED TO PAY FULL COST OF NATIONAL GUARD FOR TX &amp; FL!  NO OTHER STATES ALTHOUGH THEIR GOVERNOR'S ASKED.   DISCRIMINATION!  IT'S ALL ABOUT TRUMP, NOT THE NATION.  TIME TO PUT OUT THE TRUMP TRASH AT WH.  VOTE BLUE!
Together we are strong! Let‚Äôs take our country back! There is one race! HUMAN RACEüôèüèΩ Let‚Äôs Vote In November and take back what the Devil stole from us. Together we stand and divided we fall.  Trump out and Biden in! God Bless the America üá∫üá∏
Trump‚Äôs America
So, Trump stole their playbook?
Can we start betting on what Trump might use as a distraction? What are the odds on an executive order that mandates deportation of dreamers for $20?
You'll have four more years to predict Trump won't be reelected.
The government basically admitted it but trump runs the government now so hes not gonna do anything about a conspiracy that got him elected
Maybe trump should ban tiktok bc how can I spend 2 hours straight on that app &amp; feel like I blinked
Right. they act like Trump should habe done a full background check on everybody before he spoke to them. Epstein ran in elite circles, so he was bound to meet Trump at some point.  They don't mention that Trump banned Epstein from Maralago when he found out what he was doing

Trump and his spinners are suddenly freaking out about Florida. Here‚Äôs why.
Our local Election Director detailed some of his individual concerns to me last week:
Val Demings: Remember Senate Republicans who dismissed Trump‚Äôs wrongdoing ‚Äî and show them the door
all you trump loving mfs im gonna ask you to do something for me today: go on netflix &amp; watch immigration nation. go see &amp; educate yourself on what your president has done &amp; lmk if you still support him.
Only if Trump arrests Deep State. Otherwise he IS Deep State.

Trump, in 'Fox &amp; Friends' interview, warns it could take years to get election results with mass-mailed ballots  #FoxNews
Hey, remember when Trump said "grab her by the pussy" and everybody was like "well that's it, pack it in, looks like four years of peace and prosperity are guaranteed now that the person who ought to be president shall certainly win." I'm very sorry but Axios is nothing
Don‚Äôt really need an inside source to know this. Trump is an open book and his public comments make it clear he‚Äôs in denial or delusion or otherwise completely out of touch with reality of what‚Äôs going on.
I distinctly remember Trump hiding in a bunker because of loud shouting. Kayleigh just because you see someone in the flesh does not mean they are there mentally. #TrumpIsNotWell #TrumpIsALaughingStock #TrumpMeltdown #TrumpVirus #PresidentSnowflake #AxiosInterview
That's the only thing you can count on Trump to do.
This mad me BIG MAD this morning, bad Trump
ISN'T SOME "LAW AND ORDER" LEADER!    HE'S TRYING TO MAKE VOTERS BELIEVE CHAOS, DISORDER &amp; CRIME IS ALL AROUND THEM   AND THAT ONLY HE CAN STOP IT!  THAT'S AN ILLOGICAL ARGUMENT THAT'S HARD TO MISS.    IF ONLY HE CAN STOP IT, TRUMP SHOULD HAVE DONE IT BY NOW.
&amp;  HAVE SUED NV OVER CHANGES TO VOTING - SENDING MAIL IN BALLOT TO ALL REGISTERED VOTERS.  TRUMP SAID IF THERE IS MAIL IN VOTING  WILL LOSE?  ONE HAS TO ASK WHY?  ANSWER IS EASY - MAIL IN VOTING INVALIDATES ALL  EFFORTS OF VOTER SUPPRESSION.    DESPERATE TRUMP.
HAS NOW CLAIMED THE EXPLOSION IN BEIRUT WAS AN ATTACK!  NO EVIDENCE.  JUST KNOW IT ALL TRUMP SPREADING UNFOUNDED LIES &amp; CONSPIRACY THEORIES.  TO WHAT END?  WHO KNOW, TRUMP PROBABLY HAS NO CLUE EITHER.  CLEARLY NO INTELLIGENT LEADERSHIP
TRUMP'S AXIOS INTERVIEW WAS PATHETIC!   WAS UNPREPARED, NARCISSISTIC, &amp; SHOWED HIS RAGING INCOMPETENCE REGARDING COVID 19.   NO EMPATHY OR CARING ABOUT COVID DEATHS - SAYING "IT IS WHAT IT IS"!  NO LEADERSHIP OR COMMITMENT TO THE NATION!  A DELUSIONAL INSECURE VANE LOSER!
LATEST INCOMPETENT IDEA: PROVIDE EVERY NURSING HOME WITH FAST COVID TESTING MACHINES.   PROBLEM IS THAT THEY WILL ONLY PROVIDE INITIAL ROUND OF TEST KITS.   COST &amp; AVAILABILITY OF TEST KITS IS NATIONAL PROBLEM.    TRUMP IS POSTER BOY FOR = TOO LITTLE TOO LATE.   DUMP TRUMP
‚ÄúCancel culture‚Äù is bipartisan and the right gleefully engages as welll. Kaepernick/Nike. Yeti coolers. (Dixie) Chicks represent that from both sides. And the greatest change on your agree stats is strong liberal. Are you saying that‚Äôs hidden support for Trump? It isn‚Äôt.
MORE IGNORANCE FROM   SUDDENLY HE APPROVES MAIL IN VOTING IN FL?   THE REASON: IF HE LOSES IN FL, HE LOSES NATION IN THE ELECTION.   DESPERATE ACTION OF A CORNERED DELUSIONAL MAD MAN!  HOW WE VOTE BELONGS TO THE STATES PER CONSTITUTION &amp; HAS BEEN SHOWN SAFE.  DUMP TRUMP!
I will vote Biden gladly to get Trump out of office, but yes I agree, we need better candidates.
It‚Äôs just unbelievable we have a ‚Äòpresident‚Äô who is suing states to stop mail-in voting. I‚Äôm begging. Please vote in November. I will belly-crawl over broken glass to vote.
Like Trump. Lol
Let me say it again. Trump ONLY cares about his reelection chances, not US citizens.   We are all beneath him, and our deaths do not matter.
LARGEST BLACK VOTE FOR PRES TRUMP IN HISTORY FOR 2020 ELECTION! REPUBULICANS WILL CONTROL HOUSE AND GAINS IN US SENATE!
GATES IS HEADING UP THE SCREWED UP CORONA VIRUS PLAN OF PRES TRUMP! HE IS DOING IT FOR HIS PATENTS ON DRUGS. MONEY
Drone strikes have gone up 500% under trump, which civilian life being taken off the list of priorities that obama put in place. Obama didnt drop more bombs than Bush or Trump, he was just transparent about it, whereas Trump and Bush classified the information.
So this is what sacrificing our children in the name of Trump looks like.
They're throwing everything, including the kitchen sink to throw this election somehow, someway back to Trump. Cant erase a 10 point deficit with just 1 trick up your sleeve I guess..

I don't think he cares about Trump's feelings.I think he cares about the feelings of the elite in the GOP and they care about Trump's feelings. If he wants to leave things to local jurisdictions why is he overruling one? Why did his statement explicitly mention Mont Co?
I am often surprised by the thing that lifts people out of the Trump cult. Maybe stuff like this does that for some. I just find it unbearable to watch personally.
2 died of Ebola: Obama should resign.  4 died in Benghazi: Hillary testified for 11 hours, held 33 hearings, and launched a multiyear probe.   158,180 died with Trump‚Äôs incompetence: They nominate him for another term.

Both trump and kanye thought black folks were dumb enough to fall for this.

Just spent the last 30 minutes listening to trump spout unintelligible bullshit on the HBO interview.  How do people think that‚Äôs how a leader should act?? I know children that compose themselves better
I don't think shock collars should be used on dogs. Cruel. worn by Trump, M√¨ller, Barr, Mitch and Jared, Ivanka and  Lindsey......the perfect fashion accessory! Goes with everything.
Call me wierd, but I think you are on to something. It would be great if the Joint Chiefs and a SWAT team removed Trump from office and put him in St. Elizabeth's hospital. It would be great but it won't happen because that would be sedition.
Imagine believing anything trump says to own the libs
So was Obama in on it? Is that why Obama never prosecuted Trump? Just trying to make sense of things over here.
I have heard Holocaust survivors and those who have lived through other modern autocratic regimes screaming the warnings about the similarities between Trump and Hitler. That is not being insensitive‚Äîit‚Äôs living up to the credo of ‚ÄúNever Again!‚Äù You need to get on board, now!
Republicans have provided Trump the means to destruct and dismantle America. They have made Trump‚Äôs extended stay in White House possible.
Now we're at the point where Trump supporters mostly fallen into a sunk cost fallacy cult...they've all put too much effort into supporting someone whose horribleness they can no longer ignore, so they embraced it and become their own worst possible person to match him.
Mail in voting is perfectly safe UNLESS TRUMP ORDERS HEAD OF USPS TO CORRUPT THE PROCESS!  1-SURVEIL TRUMP AND USPS SUPERVISOR 24/7 2-HOLD ANNONYMOUS INTERVIEWS WITH  POSTAL WORKERS TO ENSURE THEY ARE BEING DIRECTED TO DUMP MAIL IN VOTES OR TO DELAY MAIL BEING SENT &amp; RECEIVED
A quick glance at the original post and subsequent comments makes for unpleasant reading. Lots of disparaging of your dancing skills, attacks on your appearance, suppositions on your voting record and financial status.   Interestingly, not a one of them actually defended Trump.
The richest country in the world want pay $600.00 of unemployment benefits for the unemployed for 6 more months.. What a shame.. Blame the Republicans and Trump they did it.....

We will if necessary. We are finished with Trump. He knows it. Look out if he doesn‚Äôt act appropriately (for once) and Immediately leave.
Trump is a MURDERER.
It didn‚Äôt have to be massive loss and nationwide suffering here. Trump gave away, destroyed, kept, sold or neglected PPE that Obama put into storage. We can‚Äôt get any PPE that lets you test and trace. Finland is a great country. You are a model nation for the World. Happy 4 You!
"Liberalism" means only "The free movement of labor &amp; capital." Ideology of elites. People who use anything resembling a hammer or a sickle for their jobs are overwhelmingly Trump voters, cause a Wall/less immigration is in US proletarian interests, &amp; they don't care about LGBTQX
Wow! Trump won‚Äôt give them to us. Trump and his grown up kids and their spouses and children took a huge stash of PPE from us. They see test results instantly.  If you can get tested, you will wait 7 days for test results. Ppl HATE TRUMP.

16 MILLION AMERICANS ARE STILL UNEMPLOYED AND 157, 631 AMERICANS HAVE DIED DUE TO DONALD TRUMP‚ÄôS INCOMPETENCE OF THE CORONAVIRUS. RUSSIA PLACED A BOUNTY ON THE HEADS OF AMERICAN SOLDIERS AND YOU DID NOTHING. YOU ARE TRULY THE MOST INCOMPETENT PRESIDENT IN U.S. HISTORY.
This ‚Äúwar‚Äù is smart, honest people vs. stupid, corrupt people.  You can‚Äôt reason with Trump supporters. They see a man who cheats on his taxes and pays nothing, and they are the exact same type of people who would do the same thing. They lie. They cheat. Expect corruption.

The United States of America Won‚Äôt survive another 4 years of Donald Trump.
Independent here as well. It‚Äôs our current social fabric. Biden isn‚Äôt fixing it. Trump may continue to make it worse but let‚Äôs remember he is a product of this environment. One day I hope we realize there are more colors in the spectrum besides red and blue.
excellent point.  you have my sympathies. Trump is such a horrible individual, I think anyone who supports him should have to pay the price of giving up their citizenship because of your stupidity.
DONALD TRUMP ISN‚ÄôT WORTHY OF ANYONE‚ÄôS VOTE. DONALD TRUMP WILL BE ABSOLUTELY TROUNCED BY JOE BIDEN IN NOVEMBER.
Now do Trump gaffes!
My tRump-loving coworker is driving his family down to Florida from Md for a vacation. It doesn‚Äôt blow my mind at all.
This is not a headline that should exist, but we're stuck with President Trump for another few months.
Trump is Grasping at straws.  He sure has NOTHING here!  Biden is someone who actually attends church and is a devout Catholic. Totally weird. #distraction #VoterSuppression #AmericaOrTrump #coronavirus #Deaths160000 #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs strategy from here on out should be to shut the entire fuck up until November and let Trump continue digging his own grave. Maybe choosing a Black woman as a running mate who will snatch his caucasity-filled ass up when he starts to speak wrong will also help‚Äù üò∑üò∑ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
When they awake from their stupor, the loyal conservatives are going to have a serious post-Trump hangover
Biden vs. Trump?  My politics align more with Trump, but Trump is a divisive moron who routinely spouts utter garbage.  Why anyone votes for him, much less reveres him is something I'll never understand.
Hear Trump's response when asked what mistakes he's made  So the fool who told people in Michigan to go out and not to worry about masking, now blames the governors. I hope his flock sees this, especially those who lost someone. Shame! #TrumpIsStupid
The decline in average new cases in the summer's most affected states happens to coincide with the day Trump's HHS took over data handling from CDC.   Pretty sharp trendline for a 7-day average...we cooking the books now?

You mean TRUMP WILL BE DESTROYED.  YO-SEMITE.  What president doesn't know how to pronounce that???
OK now I KNOW Trump is getting desperate.  Attacking Biden (who is a very devout Catholic) saying he will ‚Äúhurt God‚Äù is ridiculously stupid. Another distraction away from the REAL threats which includes is active voter suppression by the GOP. Slowing the mail is highly suspect!
This is why Trump will be re-elected. We need to keep people like Leo out there all the time.

The ad you aired this evening (Biden)had the following idea behind it: Trump didn't just steal lives from us, he stole time we could have had with loved ones...time we can never get back. It's good ad. GenX and Millennials now have kids. They want a full family w/grandparents.
If she hadn't had blamed Trump for her depression, this would be the most honest issue I've heard mentioned by any Democrat this political season.

Donald Trump interviewing himself is glorious  via  He's such a tool.
We are a police state. So if the Dems win in Nov do you think Biden will send troops out to beat peaceful protesters to include women that oppose his will like Trump has?  Be honest.
I don't know if you are missing the point intentionally or you are a Trump supporter and blind to only his whims. Social Injustice is the issue. We don't want to see property destroyed. That is why we must all work together to push back the looters. You don't do that with threats
Muppets are more coherent than Trump is.
If the trumps say something is bad, you know it's only bad for them if you do it.  So do it.   #VoteByMail #VoteEarly #VoteHimOut #VoteBiden2020
A "win" only to the trump's, not to the People who have suffered under this administration as they have under no other.   Get your mail in ballots. Order an absentee ballot today if your State doesn't allow mail in voting. Use early voting if you have to vote in person.
&amp;   are just straight up lying to the People. They think that if they can force you to vote in person with a deadly virus that trump has failed to contain &amp; has by all counts just decided to let rampage, that you won't vote &amp; trump will win.
Sorry, but this sounds like the 2020 version of ‚Äú...but her emails...‚Äù. A vote any other way than Biden is a vote for Trump.

No no no no no.  That's nonsense.    Right about the time that the NBA and NHL were shutting down their seasons, most of the smart governors got on board.    There's a historical record for all to see.  About that same time Trump was telling us that the count would soon be zero.

This was a great country until tRump turned it into a shit hole.
Trump ALWAYS plays dirty.  He has no other strategy.
What do you think Trump follows?
Repubs are pro vote by mail. It‚Äôs just him. Alone on an island. Vote by mail likely helps repubs in many places but trump can‚Äôt relax. Also- he‚Äôs the prez, if it‚Äôs a true problem, fix it. Fixing it isn‚Äôt the point, theres nothing to fix. He just wants you to think he got robbed.
Wow - this really shows just how bad Trump's mind is!  While trying to rip on Biden, he comes out looking like the stupidest person on Earth.  There is no way he passed any cognitive test with flying colors....
4 more months of Trump should do it!

Why am I not surprised. Remember this on election day. I am so sick and tired of trump and Repubs. Time for them to go.
If this were true, shouldn't at least *one* person from the English-speaking world have agreed with you by now? Even Trump corrected himself. He didn't recognize the word written down and only after he heard himself realized what it was.  Name a dictionary. We'll all check.
Interesting theory.  Could you give an example of a billionaire who is like Trump? I struggle to think of one.
What GOP obscenely offered to states was 0 dollars for COVID -19 relief efforts their leader (‚ÄúI take no responsibility states should do it‚Äù Trump) &amp; GOP (Kudlow we have ‚Äúbooming‚Äù housing market despite McConnell letting lapse foreclosure on mortgages) was as little as possible.
GOP COULD trade ‚ÄúUNLIMITED‚Äù business lunch deductions in GOP COVID relief proposals or billions or hidden tax cuts to rich.  What GOP can‚Äôt trade is 0% in their proposals to reimburse states for COVID relief Trump ‚ÄúI take no responsibility‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt do for as little as possible.
You are aware establishment republicans ALSO do not like a Trump right?
Trump didn‚Äôt ‚Äúlet him out‚Äù he commuted the sentence which means conviction stands he just doesn‚Äôt do time

üëÜIt‚Äôs almost as though Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúfacilitating‚Äù COVID-19.  His ‚ÄúIt (COVID-19) is what it is‚Äù seeming surrender to virus only reinforces that impression while over optimistic hopes of vaccine (maybe) (conveniently) before November 3rd seems to me just as unrealistic and unhelpful.
More to point 1992 NRA political contributions bipartisan 60R 40D but 2016 99% NRA political $ went to Trump. Why use NRA money for targeted GOP politics instead of gun safety or almost anything else when NRA reportedly in financial difficulties? NRA members know or approve this?
Enough IS enough. What trump is doing with his secret federal forces isn't even legal. So for this and many other crimes and repeated failures we are voting OUT tRUMP, the  WORST PRESIDENT EVER. His defeat will be stunning and sure. Watch for  that!
Explain to me why Trump is not leading (I take no responsibility), following (shaking hands, refusing to wear masks, recommending less testing against best medical advice), or getting out of way (letting professionals give COVID-19 updates instead of ad lib solos) during pandemic
How sickening. A man's life destroyed over hedge clippers, and they refuse to review the sentencing. And yet look at what trump, a rich and privileged white man, can get away with.

Then we'd better hope Senate Republicans are voted out so that when he gets impeached right away the Senate won't keep him in office. But-- far better for everyone to vote him out and not just assime Biden will win or others will go vote trump out.
No doubt about it, everyone deserves better representation. That‚Äôs my point. But 95% of voters vote based on who they know and that‚Äôs it. There are countless videos of people being told ‚Äútrump did x‚Äù and it was really Obama, or Bush, etc and ppl believed it
It is indefensible, it‚Äôs also indefensible to put in a 77 year old man with a checkered past, signs of dementia and who‚Äôs teeth fall out when he talks. Biden is JUST as bad. But everybody‚Äôs defense of why we should elect him, is Trump ü§£

The irony is I never see people looking to quote trump for his sports views meanwhile I see people looking to lean on people like Shannon and LeBron for their political views.... that‚Äôs why athletes get the ‚Äústick to sports‚Äù
I expect that tRump will be indicted in January, February, March, April, May...
I fail when it comes to the GOP and Trump and I pray but I think God understands lol. #TrumpIsALaughingStock  #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace  #TrumpLiesAmericansDie  #BlueWave2020
If you want to live under tRump‚Äôs policies, you should move to Nazi Germany, oh wait, AntiFa kicked their butts already, sorry for your loss!
You keep saying tRump had a midnight ‚Äúrun‚Äù to Walter Reed when the man can barely walk!
I'm near Gettysburg pa and think my county voted 85% for Trump in 2016. It was either the largest or second largest percentage of trump voters per county in the whole country.  Everyone here was so proud it was nauseating.
This is for everyone celebrating their Birthdays in Isolation:  From my puppy heart I send you love and a song!  üé∂ Happy Birthday to You üé∂ üé∂ Stay safe from tRump Flu üé∂ üé∂ Happy Birthday dear Resistors üé∂ üé∂ Remember Vote Blue! üé∂
... ‚Äúis what it is.‚Äù Pure self serving personally &amp;/politically no more about 2A rights for Trump than it was for LaPierre. This would be a good time nationally (&amp;rationally) to review  what rabid 2A rights advocate SC justice Scalia said about 2A which is 2A ‚Äúnot unlimited‚Äù ...
... suggesting NRA move away from the law and move to Texas but instead stay where they are get &amp; constituted under different name with different directors that will follow the law. But as Trump says Trump‚Äôs no matter what support of NRA because they support him no matter what...
I think Liz and her cronies believe there are two different William Barrs, and the one who did that investigation is part of the deep state conspiracy to protect the Clintons and bring down Donald Trump.
No comment from Trump about illegalities committed by NRA board and it‚Äôs director. Why? I don‚Äôt know. What I know is NRA should be dissolved as a charity since it has not been lawfully in New York operating as a charity. This would have been a good time for Trump instead of ...
... illegally as personal slush fund as Trump did one of his charities. Trump has already decried amount of money NRA has already spent trying to defend the indefensible and suggesed the organization move to Texas because ... laws easier on using charity as personal slush fund?..
... at state houses of democratic governors just fine. But NRA not being dissolved for inconsistent politics or 2A positions but for violating financial rules of a nonprofit. Same thing Trump and kids got banned for = operating a charity but using it for a personal slush fund.
Capone convicted of income tax evasion not for having people killed or bribing elected officials. La Pierre like Capone not above the law. His like Capone‚Äôs charges civil not criminal actions nothing about 2016 99% of NRA polical contributions to Trump or undisclosed RU $ to NRA.
He directly said that if trump was a private citizen, he could charge him with obstruction of justice. The office is all that shielded him
Told you it wasn't about Trump.  now if you want him gone, VOTE.   period.
I got my application to mail in requesting absentee ballot YESTERDAY.   My state‚Äôs general election ballots have not been printed yet but I‚Äôm getting ready now. Trump‚Äôs deliberately slowing down  Postal Service. We‚Äôve seen because of COVID 200 voting places reduced to 1 in 1 city
Trump has openly blurted out (admitted?) if all citizens could vote by mail (or any other way minus deliberate voter suppression roadblocks or invalidation on technicalities making distinctions without a difference to throw out votes ) no Republican would ever be elected again.
Talking IRL about the supply line problems for PPE and disinfecting wipes and it hits me, AGAIN, how easily Trump could have secured a legitimate re-election and a place in the history books by just doing his actual job on one thing.
tRump‚Äôs recurring nightmare about his next meeting with Nancy Pelosi!
tRump‚Äôs fantasy of his next meeting with Nancy Pelosi.
Just when NRA would have had to divulge RU $ &amp; from whom GOP congress passed rule they didn‚Äôt have to. 1992 NRA political campaign contribution 60R-40D somewhat bipartisan but 2016 NRA political contributions all-in 99% to Trump/GOP even as RU helping Trump. Odds of coincidence?
Trump‚Äôs mistake sterotyping suburban white women as ‚Äúhousewives‚Äù thinking they‚Äôd buy his stereotyping of ‚ÄúTHEY‚Äù will be reflected in their votes against him Nov 3rd. His assumption caged kids unseen &amp; George Floyd calling ‚Äúmomma‚Äù unheard by white men would be by white women ...
So-called "Insiders" have been telling us for 4 years now that "Insert person of the week* is going to "get Trump" any day now, and it never happens. Just stop with this. Election soon, we are just going to have to Vote him out in such numbers that it can't be disputed.
Yeah..Twitter is going to implode when this "National Announcement" by Letitia James ends up being about a completely separate issue and having nothing to do directly with Trump. Newsflash: NOBODY IS COMING TO SAVE US. The only recourse is to VOTE, in overwhelming numbers.
We could simplify it even more for tRump, he could just write:  ‚ÄúI is FIRED.‚Äù  And sign it with a sharpie!
It is not 'completely irrelevant to the presidency." It would show that he has empathy and loyalty and can relate to others on a deeper level. That's clearly not trump. And if he did have a 'warm, genuine friendship,' he'd be crowing all over about it.

Exactly,   they never shutdown the country correctly!  Then tRump opened way too soon.  The virus is still killing us!  Now idiot wants all the kids back in school,   he's killing us!  And Moscow Mitch PUTIN'S Bitch sits back and let's this happen.
It‚Äôs really going to be up to the states how we vote. Trump is being stupid, as usual.
Biden wouldn't have kept financial assistance from these democratic cities.  But you did and really should be impeached for that behavior.   tRump is killing us! #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare  #ImpeachTrumpAgain
What do you think about Trump telling people to wear a mask now?  He in on the conspiracy as well?
New story on NPR: Twitter, Facebook Remove Trump Post Over False Claim About Children And COVID-19
It is up to the states.  Not Trump.
"Trump campaign ad against Joe Biden contains a number of doctored images, CNN and WaPo report"
Oof. Fuck trump, but this isn‚Äôt 3rd century Rome lmao
Just rename the prison library after tRump.
You do know many people were convicted and pleaded guilty to crimes related to this right? Like trump aides and allies. He directed people to illegally defy subpoenas. He did that because the documents were the written proof of what people testified to, and he knows he is guilty
He wasn‚Äôt charged with a crime because he abused his power so badly that no documents could be produced. He would just command the documents to not be given to the courts. Trump was impeached, you know that right?
Yeah Trump is a patron of truth a true saint lol
Many many people say this is funny.. Enjoy üòò
üòò I must go back to my business as much fun as this is..it‚Äôs a full time job to defend Trump and the pay is shite..enjoy
Trump killed his own economy not taking this seriously
People really out here supporting Trump...
The thing about this is that I'm not even 100% sure the DOJ is trying to protect anyone in particular here - they just want to preserve the Trump/GOP talking point that makes it sound like Flynn (and thus Trump) was being "spied on" in particular.
trump's decisions on coronavirus are completely unacceptable
TRUMP is the liar.
I voted trump. I thought we needed a change. We got one alright, a terrible change that has cost lives, incited violence, and destroyed a country. I feel that I must rectify this and hope that we can come back from this disastrous experience and maybe even grow.  #LincolnVoter
Donald, get ready!! America is throwing you out on the 3rd of November!!!
So forget the fact that multiple people have been indicted for true crimes!!!! Trump is trying to argue he shouldn‚Äôt have gotten caught lol
Just reported that children on their first day of school in Georgia are coming down with covid!! This is what everyone should fear! They don‚Äôt require kids have on masks! They only socia distance when able too!! This is irresponsible as can be. Trump is a horrible president
I doubt any other admin would have been so incompetent Trump has since lowered the bar on that shouldn‚Äôt matter who‚Äôs in office they need to be called out for their failures Trump has many..
This is why Trump suddenly put DeJoy in control last month. He's manipulating everything he can. This is also why we must not only vote by mail but vote EARLY. #vote üó≥ #votebymail üì¨#voteearly üó≥
Congratulations everybody tagging themselves as a #LincolnVoter. You are welcome to climb into the lifeboat with us but you will not be allowed to steer it back towards the iceberg.   Your party created Trump. Your "values" and policies led us here. Are you done with them yet?
And believing Trump isn‚Äôt üòÇ
At the the of the day, either way, I expect her to identify four more years of Trump as being less dangerous than a shooting match for the White House. If she thinks he will burn the country down to keep it... she will settle in for four more years of being principled opposition.
And if we don't hold an election... then her term is up and she isn't speaker of the house. She has no claim, any more than Trump does.
If Pelosi is speaker on January 21st, that means we held an election. Which means the president should be Biden, if Trump is ignoring its results. As an institutionalist, I think she would recognize a potentially possible but fake outcome (Trump winning) before taking it herself.
Trump "Will Go Away Like Things Go Away"
Trump can‚Äôt even pronounce Yosemite walk down a ramp or hold a bottle of water but do go on..
Sick of people like you who won‚Äôt accept the truth but think Donald Trump is an honest man..put your guitar down and do something constructive like educating yourself..
I am rewriting this headline- "Jill Biden predicts a complete and utter train wreak."
Only a matter of time before these kids are placed on respirators. I blame Trump and his supporters.
Why was it OK for Trump to tell Pence to give PPE to some states without them asking but make ____   ____s of other states beg for help?  Hint : answer below  Hint: 1st word ‚ÄúDemocratic‚Äù Hint : 2nd word ‚ÄúGovernors‚Äù Hint : sounds like ‚ÄúDemocratic Governors‚Äù getting shafted by DJT.
Trump‚Äôs STILL retweeting memes with Trump name every 4 years far into future insinuating not so subtly what he has said blatantantly out loud which is he deserves more than 2 terms and/or has right to postpone elections.   Doesn‚Äôt he realize he ‚Äúwill go away as things go away‚Äù?
Dear President Trump,  You care NFL players not mandated to be on field standing during anthem until 2009? You support ‚Äúpeople‚Äù you claim not ‚Äúhappy‚Äù w/K kneeling sending death threats to vet Nate Boyer standing next to K to respect his right to protest American flag represents?
God no! We've had more than enough of trump. He's on his way out.
I am thrilled any tim Nat. Prks. get anything. But I know great harm done by trump, too. For ex.: What about Bears Ears?
Funny republicans are alarmed over a Kobach victory but not over a Trump victory..Kobach is in the swamp he just wasn‚Äôt swampy enough for Donnie..
üëáI agree with this message. Trump brags of record high stock market kept artificially high by infusions of fed $ ( taxpayer $ ) to bail out failed stocks and investment instruments but begrudges $600 to taxpayers employed through no fault of their own.
We can't do much about reporters but we can choose what we amplify. I'm going to amplify a friend from Lebanon who asks that we don't amplify the conspiracy theories and the amateur forensic demolitions experts and Trump's chosen narrative, even to QT it to disagree with it.
Donald Trump says he doesn't know what Ghislaine Maxwell was in for, that the briefing on Russian bounties never crossed his desk, and he's pushing a story about Beirut that has no basis anywhere, no confirmation anywhere.  At what point do reporters stop amplifying him?
Yes,  because tRump is killing us in plain sight!
Trump is the master of the swamp Kris WOULD HAVE fit right in but shucks he lost AGAIN..
tRump is NOT doing everything that he can to help with covid19.  He's killing us!

Seriously, I mean we‚Äôve all figured out that Trump is a moron by now, it‚Äôs not like that is news
It's never going to happen with trump in charge.
I agree with you on that. I think of the  majority of trump supporters as similar to rugged individualists. But everything is all about them.
Ay Trump, what dat mouth do?
Joe Biden has already agreed on three debates and has been waiting on Trump to agree to... the one hiding and is a coward is Trump himself
What Trump is trying to say is they rigged the election in Florida so no matter what he will win.
And-- not all rednecks are magas agreeing with trump. I'm the lib of my family, most of whom are rednecks (sd with love!). They are NOT with trump for most part. So some of those may also move away.What exactly is  trying to communicate here üëáüèæ ? It sounds like Trump and the rest of the public don‚Äôt like the #fakenews.   People will be loving Trump when he gets the unemployed their $600 back. That‚Äôs probably why the press is really mad üíÅüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I try to be polite and diplomatic with everyone, including Trump supporters. But you just showed the whole word how ignorant you. This already exists under Obamacare!
wrath!! ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?!!!!!!!!!!!!! All I know is if my child was one of those soldiers..Trump would be dead by now! I'm not lying...I'd kill him!  Why isn't this getting more attention right now??!!!!  **************
So, two weeks ago..Pompeo spoke to his Russian counterpart about them paying to have US soldiers killed. Whatever you have heard about this being unsubstantiated is false! Pompeo even said he didn't want Trump to find out he had called because he didn't want to deal with Trump's
Trump is covering his a‚Äî and wants to be able to say that he didn‚Äôt have to confront Putin because Pompeo did so on his behalf?  But this belies Trump‚Äôs defense that the intel was questionable.
Because it‚Äôs 100% true. And it‚Äôs ALL DONALD TRUMP‚ÄôS FAULT üòàüòà
Trump Voters / Supporters - The Ugliest Scurge of Society! They voted for one thing only - Fascism / Racism! Do not entertain that FAKE economy talk from them! They are BatShit Deplorable Racists - Period! Those who standby silent are also abhorrent &amp; Complicit!
Trump is 50+% of what's wrong with America and said 50+% is the vile of the vile whom supports him, the Repugnant Republicans and all the Racist Deplorables in the Whole Wide World! In a semi-fair system, they wouldn't even qualify for a Dog Catcher Job!
This is actually a great reply in my opinion. It really highlights how much worse Trump is than Biden under an article that again highlights the horridness of Biden. Shows the critically ill state our country is in, and that's fascinating. This should be framed.

Which is already covered under Obama Care, what they keep trying to get rid of! Trump is just trying to save face as elections approach!
Can you believe that they are seeing Rice is a liar? Compared to who Donald Trump?
Ron Wright remains favored heading into 2020 without a doubt, but it‚Äôs not difficult to see him being booted out. If Biden wins or even narrowly loses Texas, this district could be in danger of flipping to Trump, in which case Wright would be in serious trouble.
When the Affordable Care Act was originally designed it required ALL insurance to cover everyone regardless of preexisting conditions. Ironically Trump, in attempting to dismantle "Obamacare" removed this requirement changing ACA into the useless mess it is.
They can‚Äôt get it done bc they are the DO NOTHING DEMOCRATS. Just watch, trump will have to sign an executive order bc the Dems can‚Äôt act fast enough.
Black voters will feel kicked in the face by that decision after driving Biden‚Äôs primary win. He‚Äôll still win a large percentage of the black vote, but turnout will be lower. Also, white voters still gonna vote trump 55/45
I agree on both counts. And may I add...what the fuck? Is Trump a fucking Captain Planet villain?
My husband is a manager for the Census. In my opinion, the employees are placed in a situation where it is impossible to get an accurate count in this condensed time frame. The Census Bureau is being held hostage to Trump‚Äôs politics and the whole country will suffer as a result.
Not from laziness but fear of getting sick and making their family sick especially if someone has an underlying condition. But don‚Äôt blame the cause.....Trump, blame someone else, anyone else. That‚Äôs the Trump way!

Move along. Nothing to see here. Just another Trump lie.
Let‚Äôs be clear: Americans care about enhanced unemployment, eviction moratorium, student loan deferment.   Trump just won the election, guess the VP bid isn‚Äôt as pretty anymore?
Welp, this tweet didn‚Äôt age well....  Trump held a news conference to announce that he‚Äôs getting rid of student loans, evictions, and extending $600 enhanced unemployment until the end of the year.   AND he took questions. Something his Dem opponent has proven he can‚Äôt do. üò¢
Trump just announced he would do this via executive order. Because democrats won‚Äôt do it.   This will win him the electing. Mark. My. Words.
Trump does not Belege in experts.
The US Census announced that it will halt all counting efforts for the 2020 census on Sept. 30, a month sooner than planned, drawing objections from civil rights groups and Democrats who say the Trump administration is trying to deliberately undercount poor people and immigrants.
An elderly Florida man arrested for drunk-driving a golf cart blamed his intoxication on watching President Trump give a coronavirus briefing. Cary DeVan, 82, told officers he ‚Äúgot really mad at what [Trump] said‚Äù and started drinking vodka.
Would have to be something like that bc Trump has no soul- sold it to ole Nick years ago.
Most of the media are worse that worthless. The are only good at serving as a megaphone for Trump. Little to no investigative reporting because they don‚Äôt want to lose ‚Äúaccess.‚Äù Problem is good reporters will have access because public will demand it.
Thank god we have Trump who can lift a glass and drink water, along with the ability to ace a 3rd grade pop quiz.
Trump Campaign Launches Bus Tours Through Swing States
People say Trump won‚Äôt be allowed to do that. Will people get the enhanced unemployment? Or will it take months of people fighting to stop it (just bc it‚Äôs trumps order)?

Trump is the most corrupt, self-serving individual ever to occupy the Presidency. He talks big, but delivers little, and while you are listening in awe to his lies, he picks your pocket.
Another Trump friend, too. Shocking.
Use of or installation of the app is already prohibited on Government devices. Restriction imposed be agency IT security. Happened way before Trump had even heard of TikTok. It may compromise user privacy, but that‚Äôs not really a Government concern unless banking is threatened.

Russia and other countries pay people to use social media accounts to aggravate divisions. It's called state-sponsored psyops. One of the groups they target, that has proven particularly susceptible because they'll believe anything that makes the left look bad, is the Trump cult.
Bullshit. Trump has no authority to ban TikTok. If I am wrong, please correct me, but I think Congress would have to pass a law to force ISPs to filter content and Apple an Google to remove it. There may be reasons to do so but Trump cannot do anything.
Awesome!  China will intervene to help Biden and Russia will help Trump.
Republicans want to hand out fast food coupons to people and call that relief and dems want to provide something serious and yet, its dems thats the problem? You toothless Trump supporting imbeciles I hope know this means you all arent getting a damn thing either right?
Talk about October surprises ‚Äî what about the big reveal of turning Rachel Maddow loose on what Deutsche Bank has on Trump.
If MS falls for that, they are as stupid as Trump. He cannot ban TikTok, nor can he force its sale. TikTok is a private entity used by private individuals. China and other totalitarian or corrupt states do shit like this but so far it is not done here.
But, but Trump remembered 5 words and it was so difficult and everyone was shocked he could do it. Keep believing all the bullshit he shoves down your throat.
the darker part is that they convinced people like you trump is not a problem.
I should add that he has no authority to either ban TikTok or force its sale, much less take a cut. He can ban the app from Government devices. This was done months ago by agency OCIOs without input from Trump.
Putin hates trump. Russians helped Steele on fake Dossier. President  Trump put too many sanctions on Russia. We are still waiting on US intelligence to say if Bounty on US Soldiers is true. Russians help their ally Syria, our enemy ! You‚Äôre Nuts ü•úü•ú&amp; Lie

No. Trump has set us back decades.
yeah I didn‚Äôt mean to shame anyone who wasn‚Äôt following him. but I remember seeing a facebook post that was like ‚Äúremove all these people from your friends list‚Äù and it linked to all your friends who liked or followed trump on fb...which is so stupid.
Except that every one of his statements is wrong. The Virus is not under control. We know what to do, but thanks to #OrangeusDumbasseous we are not doing it. As to exponential growth, predictions were made but ignored with Trump insisting that coronavirus will just ‚Äúdisappear.‚Äù
i find it very concerning that very few of my friends actually follow Trump on twitter.
Ha Ha. Guess Trump didn‚Äôt bother asking those countries. God he can make stuff up!
And that screed right there puts you squarely in the GOP/Trump cult. You're in a cult. I cannot stress this enough. You. Are. In. A. Cult.

At an International Space University  alumni conference webinar, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine is asked about Trump‚Äôs NASA tweet earlier this week. ‚ÄúWe are getting it going again,‚Äù he says of NASA, adding that agency was ‚Äúdemoralized‚Äù after Constellation was canceled.
Trump made masks a political thing. You get to own that.

You think it's a game to Fauci but not to Trump. This is what being in a cult looks like.
Pays Donald royalties for use of the Trump label.
this is true, but this is also a moment where  voices, including your own, need to disown Trump. If you continue to empower him via the 11th Commandment, he‚Äòll continue to abuse his power and destroy the once-honorable party you love. STAND UP! SPEAK OUT!
Just saw two tiktok video's where the speakers both claimed Obama is behind the covid pandemic. He created and distributed it. My question is whether they are your everyday Trump idiots, or guys getting paid by Russia or China to spread stupid nonsense. Just curious.
I have been doing that, since the day he met Trump!
Trump will fire Barr sooner or later. Barr will say something he disagrees with, and they will both hold their ground.

So you‚Äôre admitting Trump did an awesome job with black unemployment until COVID? Weird, democrats used to deny those statistics back then....
Key difference between Trump and Biden. Trump has some racist supporters. Biden legit thinks his people are superior to black people. This is one of MANY racist Freudian slips
At any point are we going to talk about whether this guy is an actual racist? Trump hasn‚Äôt been caught saying this much racist crap.

Pls stfu bro. You‚Äôre going to be the reason why trump wins bc your fans love to suck your cock and are going to Vote for you.

For the love of Mike! WH is worrying now about Trump looking corrupt? That's funny. GOP is insane if it nominates him again. Of course, Dems are giving someone the nomination because it is their turn, because that worked so well in 2016, 2004, 2000, 1984.
So you're voting for trump. Cool.
‚ÄúYeah, but he‚Äôs so much better than Trump. I want to see his policy page. I want to watch the debates.‚Äù - Everyone.. who decided they‚Äôre voting not Trump in 2020. It‚Äôs gross
Trump signs executive order to ban US transactions with owners of TikTok and WeChat in 45 days
Same reasons as in suburbs everywhere. Trump was a wake-up for lots of educated folks.
why? its legit observation. We've got Cubans Mexicans  Guatemalans Brazilians El Salvadorians etc. Most Blacks are dems but Hispanic com. is split.. My ex is Cuban and his circle in miami love trump. TRUMP IS A LIAR yet we should feel shame whenever Biden says something?? Fuckoff
Oh definitely. Trump will still win it.
Forsyth County, Georgia (an Atlanta exurb) had a big swing left in 2016, going from Romney+63 to Trump+47. Expect another enormous swing left this cycle. It‚Äôs changing more and more every day.
Trump has a way to stop world population growth...stop pregnancy testing.
Trump doesn‚Äôt understand how pro-gun the radical left is
Trump does Executive orders that affect #TikTok, #WeChat, and Chinese pharmaceutical makers. #TikTok, #WeChat are security risks to your personal data.  You may want to stop using.
I'm guessing it has something to do with the "TikTok teens humiliate Trump in Tulsa" headlines. Because apparently a bunch of teens registered to go to inflate numbers and posted videos about it on TikTok.
Sycophants die on hills to defend the stupidest Trump actions as some deep and insightful play that‚Äôs over everyone else‚Äôs realm of comprehension, because it‚Äôs so profound.
Democrats‚Äô best area in TN-04 is Rutherford County, home to rapidly growing Murfreesboro. They‚Äôll likely narrow the gap a bit from 2018, but Trump‚Äôs 41% margin of victory in TN-04 last time means they have just about no prayer at cracking this nut.
After he gassed protesters so he could hold the Bible upside down and by the way... the leaders of the church were physically, forcibly  removed from the church. Trump paid for abortions for women he impregnated!
How much is this EO worth? Follow the money (and tickets to maga Tulsa rally by teenagers using TikTok). They played a prank on trump so now he‚Äôs at war with TikTok . Next round to the teenagers...
(Without such a constitutional amendment, as we found out several years later, you can't do shit; another Trump appointee and individual contribution limits are probably toast too)

But kids are immune, Trump said.
No, the video is not from 2016. As someone else pointed out , they have Trump 2020 signs, plus that McDonald's had not been remodeled yet in 2016 (check older Street View imagery).
Biden can speak much better than You will any day in this life time. If you and your Wife thinks Yeum0 can talk you're right. A lot of hogwash.  That's all Trump talks. Lies and more lies.
No, Trump did not just ban TikTok. American companies like Microsoft still have 45 days to buy it. Trump just set a timer on such deals, which will already be hard to work out considering MS would only buy TikTok‚Äôs operations in 5 markets and split it from the rest of the world.
DONALD J. TRUMP
If polling shows it HURTS trump why are they continuing. I don‚Äôt depend on the govt to make my life better so I‚Äôm done with this conversation because it‚Äôs a waste of energy
Based on polling Kanye was taking votes away from Trump. If Kanye was not a threat then dems wouldn‚Äôt invest so much energy in discrediting him. If he‚Äôs not serious then your putting way more energy into that then focusing on why people DONT want to vote for Biden
Donald trump failed to be a leader in so many ways.
ya ever had a kid repeat everything you say?  it's like trump is one of those kids.  no matter what is said, he says the opposite.  it gets old real fast.
so what did he say?  trump will fire me?  took me two weeks to get a simple piece of mail.  this is outrageous, especially now that we have become so dependent on distancing and the mail is the only way to get essentials.
too late, that ship has sailed.  never trump but republican means enabler.  so  you are just as bad

They thought Trump would be the end of PC culture
Because teachers are so high paid they should risk their lives and leave their kids alone just so you can get rid of yours. Glad you‚Äôre not my mother.BTW, Trump would rather have a new FBI building than $$$ for school safety. Typically self serving.
I‚Äôd vote for Biden over Trump even if Biden were on life support.
Hell, Trump ain't getting into heaven.
They didn‚Äôt pay their fair share in Trump world
As a grandfather, nothing Trump says will deter me from protecting my grandkids.
They didn't think they needed a "stop Trump" think tank. The party thought there was no way he could win. It was a disastrous and deadly mistake, and voting for anyone but Biden in November would also be a disastrous mistake.

They are a joke. I know many women from their 20s to their 70s who will be voting for Trump. Some voted for him in 2016 but many didn‚Äôt and now will.
Trump will obviously still win the state massively. But I think Hillary‚Äôs performance there was uniquely terrible, bordering on bottom-of-the-barrel.
I think there were a lot of people in Louisville and Lexington who voted Trump because they always voted R historically but will switch to D in large numbers. Big room for growth there. Plus, northern Kentucky will move left markedly as well (Cincinnati). Rurals Trump will crush.
Trump will win Kentucky by double digits but I can easily be convinced his margin there will be less than 20.
If this is your position you deserve 4 more years of Trump.

Trump got this man out here looking like a fool
As it turns out, the system of checks and balances relies heavily on an adherence to to norms and basic respect for our institutions. Trump has never bothered with either and Republicans have abandoned any semblance of caring.
Hateful? That‚Äôs rich lol. Nah, just much more intelligent than you. Calling us hateful when Trump is literally on video mocking a disabled reporter and encouraging his supporters at his rallies to be violent and rough people up is just so so ironic lol.
I have very little empathy.  She only feels this way because she is personally threatened.  She seems to feel nothing for Trump‚Äôs racism &amp; racist policies, e.g., children in immigration cages &amp; torn from families, etc.  Cry me a river ............
Unfortunately, Trump can have both. Logical inconsistencies are not a thing for him.  One example : blaming Obama for allowing Russia ("tempted by our weakness") to seize the Crimea, yet undermining the sanctions Obama imposed.  Also, don't expect Trump to grasp the golden rule.
trump/GOP no interest in helping us  Dems: Passed $3.4 trillion bill for a 2nd direct deposit, billions for housing, food assistance  GOP: Proposed $1.1 trillion package with direct payment BUT no aid for housing,  food.  $200 a week for 2 months then only 70%  until January.

Repeat fear inducing comments frequently enough and the shock is that you will induce fear. Fear is the easiest thing to sell. Trump ran on fear, was elected on it, and remained in office because of it.

Who cares if you're black too? You contextualizing the discourse around his race, and the assertion that he *holds the wrong philosophy for his race* is the issue here. Again, political philosophy predates the Republican party, let alone Trump.

Trump and Biden aside entirely, just the lens with which he approached the entire conversation betrays that he's in fact a racist. Racism isn't just slurs and oppression, it's a worldview where everything is interpreted by race, which is the real and true issue.
Infuriated. I‚Äôve never seen a pretender for president or a contender try more pathetic and authoritarian moves to stay in office or gain office. With Trump‚Äôs corruption any law or statute that gets in the way is destroyed. You‚Äôd think he was avoiding jail or just insane.

I can't respond to this honestly... so I'll just say yes.
I dont put racism past anybody. In fact they are all racist. Trump systemic divides amongst social economic lines. Hes no leader. Takes credit for Obama work.... not economically responsible.. lies all the time. Just like his businesses.
Daily Crunch: Trump bans transactions with ByteDance and Tencent

Trump says he's planning executive order requiring insurers to cover pre-existing conditions, something already established in ObamaCare which he's trying to dismantle...
And many laws eliminating judges' discretion were designed to eliminate racial disparities in sentencing. Mandatory life for a third offense that wasn't even violent is crazy. Trump made a big step in the right direction on the Federal side but some of these states are awful.
Uhh because you sign a consent form when you sign up for these applications.. nobody is trying to silence Donald Trump, they are attempting to stop the spread of misinformation and hate. Not their fault everything he says falls under both categories
Something tells me the blonde would ditch her kids if Trump invited her backstage....
Trump is brutally honest. And correct. You are fakenews, Jim.
It is because of John Brennan knowledge of cyber capabilities that Donald Trump saw him as a threat to his communications with Russia.
2014 Poroshenko pleaded with the US for lethal weapons to protect against Russian aggression. The Obama administration refused. The Trump administration has approved the $39 million sale of defensive lethal weapons to Ukraine.
Definitely an uneducated Trump lover behind this account.

Very sad if Trump Campaign staff encouraged these members to attend..."Hury hurry DJT is going to make a speech in the Dining Room.."

Also, you *do* know that nowhere in the constitution does it say that 9 justices are the only way to do the Supreme Court.  You‚Äôre hard up for people to buy your ‚Äúcorrupt duopoly knows best‚Äù bullshit aren‚Äôt you?  Americans should vote third party &amp; repudiate shitty Trump + Biden.

This is already covered by Obamacare, which is the law of the land, and mandate insurance companies to do so.  Yet, Trump keeps wanting to get rid of Obamacare.  This is a pointless EO.

President Donald Trump on Friday said that he is ready to sign an executive order that will offer unemployment supplements, eviction protection, and a payroll tax holiday through the end of the year.
Just you wait for the rousing, melodic voice of Chuck Schumer to tell that the Democrats are willing to do even less than Trump to help people and help Republicans destroy the ACA in the process.
I guess I‚Äôm talking about public perception. They can also still call out Trump and Republicans for screwing over state/local governments. Feel 100% validated on UI, PECs. I don‚Äôt really care about the politicians, but rather public perception.
Essentially this means that Trump‚Äôs guy is assuming responsibility for any delays in the next 45 days.

If you were to compare the actions/rhetoric of Donald Trump to The Ten Commandments or The Seven Deadly Sins. You will find that his actions and rhetoric, rather presidency or personal, are more in tuned with the sins.

So, really, is this Trump trying to get Republicans to try and break rank over the payroll tax issue? Same goes for Dems since they got a bunch of what they wanted minus state/local coverage.
The public perception seems that Republicans only wanted $200/week. They lose liability protection, lose on $600/week so Republicans are going to have to go against Trump or say nothing, preexisting conditions is a Dem package, and others...
#trump needs to stop going after the #usps. Seriously stop making everything your puppet.
HERE U GO DOC:

I think saying that he broke the ‚Äúthou shall not kill‚Äù commandment is a bit of a stretch. Since we‚Äôre bringing religion into it, I think Christianity says God created the virus, so God killed those people, Trump just watched it happen.
Trump isn't fit to be head of a Pig Pin; why is he in Office? Most Vial Lier, Womanizer, Racist and Con Monster. Must people I know say; "give me five minutes in a locked room with him"; likewise AG Barr.  He isn't worth the coverage the Press and Media extend to him and the GOP!
If this is a political activity, the Trump campaign, not taxpayers, should pay for it.

Trump talks about certain things he will do. However, he can't do it with executive power only. He wants to exempt taxes. His wealthy corporate friends would love that. He is pushing for a hold on evictions but it takes Congress to bring it to law. Such a screwball.
How many more ads will #Facebook let Donald Trump run that are filled with false and vote-suppressing content? We can't wait to find out. Federal oversight bodies need to investigate ‚Äî and act.

Donald Trump turns news conferences into campaign rhetoric full of lies that are either read from a script, that become even bigger lies when he goes off script. All of which the public is sick and tired of hearing and refusing to entertain any further. Bring on the election.

I'm suspicious because the reports came just as Trump was doing something good: drawing down our troops in Afghanistan. The war machine had to find a reason to keep the gravy train running, even if it makes no logical sense to fund people already shooting at us for free.

I think the diff is that, broadly, rallies tend to be affirmative boosters (eg. pep rally, Trump rally) where protests advocate change. So the fact that so many "very fine people" hold rallies for the establishment tells one everything they need to know about that establishment.

Scary thought:  Trump is going hard on mail in voting because he plans to use it to cheat, and wants to make sure if he wins, no D can complain about mail in voting or, if he loses, makes it so he can question any results.   Either way, we should all ignore him.
They cannot even have a civil conversation about these things.  Their hatred of Trump is the sort of thing that propels despots into power.

Biden don‚Äôt need help from Chinese or the Persians Trump is going a good job making himself look bad his handling of the Covid19 crisis along turned people off not to mention the other things he done to piss people off since elected
I want Trump gone as much as the next guy, but could we focus on facts and not evidence-free fantasies?
Maybe Trump needs a walker for those ramps. Maybe he should use a straw when drinking from a glass of water. No real evidence Biden is deteriorating like Trump.
Come on, how many people were dumb enough to vote for Trump? Of course people will vote for Kanye!
Republicans never intend to do a deal. They want Trump to do an executive order so it can look like he saved the day.   Because only Trump and Trump alone can fix it. Get it?
Trump is a charlatan. His dad bought his way into Wharton &amp; he didn't even take his own SATs. His followers are poorer, less educated, and many have not left their home states. They see a 5x draft dodger as a patriot, a libertine as a God, a philanderer as a family man.
Twitter is gonna shrivel up and die like a night crawler baking in the sun  once Trump is gone.
The Trump family is a great example of what you get when status, influence, power and wealth are the only values one has; few of them ever learned how to love, self-actualize, and belong to something greater than themselves, and it shows in how empty their lives are.

Trump‚Äôs tiny little brain can‚Äôt pronounce common words in the English language. Yosemite. Thailand. He has trouble drinking a glass of water with one hand. He has trouble walking down a ramp. He is deteriorating fast.
I was die hard Bernie.  Gave him $1k in '16 before I could afford anything like that.  I am all in on Biden.  Not just b/c we must defeat Trump, b/c he's a genuinely good man.

No, they will have the option to open. Some, like the one attended by Trump‚Äôs son have already announced they will not be open
It‚Äôs better than doing nothing. People moan about everything Trump does because they hate him. If every country followed his lead it would send a clear message. The way CCP have acted towards HK is disgusting.
"UkraineGate" is really Trump's illegal attempt to extort Ukraine into fabricating derogatory information about Biden. Trump is a criminal. Biden is not.
AG James‚Äôs action against the NRA has nothing to do with 2A rights. Nobody is taking legally owned weapons. Trump alledging that our guns will be taken away is an outright lie! How did we get here? How did a bigoted imbecile get to the White House? He must be removed from office!
No I just said trump your messiah is not doing anything to help he's not "draining the swamp" he's not aresting Hillary but keep clinging on to false hope
Ok have fun getting tricked by trump even tho he's really not doing anything to help. You know he was involved with epstein right?
Iran is working to get Trump out too.
foolish. With reference to the fable of the frog, the water is almost at a full boil now and will be there if Trump wins. Yes, things are dark and desperate, and it could be disastrous to pretend otherwise.
by  that, even tho Trump is terrible, she may not vote for Biden if he picks the "wrong" VP candidate. Are you kidding me? We've long had an arrogant view that "it could never happen in the US" - authoritarianism could never displace democracy. That view is historically...
A follower mentioned that my tweets were getting increasingly "dark." It's true, and for good reason - the situation in this country grows increasingly desperate, and I am not talking about the pandemic. I am talking about the overt threat to the democracy posed by Trump and...
Biden is portrayed as a familiar face and reliable statesman in contrast with the volatile Trump. In reality, he promises to be the most liberal president in history, writes   It would depend on who he appoints to his cabinet to drive policy
Listen here fat! trump has said that unironically he is for the thing that is not the same thing with his own room before he ran out of the house and then noted that they were doing the job of those who are both permanently and mentally ill. -Biden word prediction
Trump is barely a Shirley Temple. He went to Wharton like I went to Buckingham Palace, as a tourist. If he's a billionaire it's because he's spent the last 3.5 years lining his pockets while looting the nation.  You don't have the sense God gave a sponge.

Pretty sure Trump is going to gain the black vote against a man who: Was part of the government that put large number of black ppl in jail for nonviolent crimes, who told black ppl they're arent black if they dont vote for him, and said black people dont have diverse thought.

"Most liberal president in history"? Come on, Bobby: define "liberal." And then tell us what's wrong with that. What you must really mean is "progressive." Certainly not "socialist": that title goes to Trump, who's added trillions in debt to pay for gov hand-out programs.

That‚Äôs different, and you know it.  There are different colored ribbons for different causes.  The Trump campaign is using neon pink to represent all women - not a cause, as if all women are the same, even as his campaign color is red, which he uses for all other purposes.
He's as bad as trump.

I remember the tail end of McCarthyism, and we never want to return there. But when Trump's gone there must be an investigation of how deeply Putin had his hooks into him and other members of the GOP. Trump et al have in fact sold us out to Russia, which seems a lot like treason.

Trump is a cosmopolitan. He went to Wharton, he‚Äôs a billionaire, he‚Äôs traveled around the world. HE SHOULD KNOW BETTER!!! SO SHOULD YOU!!! #Thighland
God bless Trump...
Not really. Because by then it will be common knowledge that Trump was part of an international crime syndicate that intended to rape, pillage, and ultimately destroy America, and that he was a literal sociopath. What they'll have a hard time with is that we all let this happen.

Look, Trump never should have politicized the drug like he did.  Can it treat Covid?  No.  Can it be used preemptively for Covid? Maybe, the studies are mixed. (FDA) Are there serious, sometimes debilitating and fatal side effects from the drug?  Yes, brutal in some cases.
Someone better find a good stash of quaaludes if I‚Äôm going to have to sit around and watch Biden and Trump stumble their way through a debate without a non-dementia patient on the stage.  And people wonder why I want  on that stage?
America is in a state of reckoning. The Trump era is the harvest of America's 401 years of wicked seeds sown against non-white people. America needs to repent and reconcile. White churches are the barometer for America's racism. 2 Chronicles 7:14; Luke 10:33
When Trump's stormtroopers come for your family, when Trump ignores the election results and stays in office, what will you do? Write a strongly-worded letter?  You liberals are pathetic. Disarm yourselves as the country becomes a police state? Disgusting.

I think all of this nonsense started only because Trump publicly said he admired Putin for being a "Russia first" type of leader. He could relate to that as he is definitely "America first" kind of leader.
Ahh, The Gateway Pundit.   When you want your news from a source more racist, unsubstantiated, fake, and unreliable than Breitbart, ONN, Trump, and MAD magazine put together.

None. And, just FYI, I am a Democrat who hates Trump and DeVos.

Who would be a better president and who do you prefer be elected in November?  Joe Biden or Donald Trump?
His positions on enforcing civil rights laws is enough. Trump has eviscerated the civil rights division and turn it toward legalizing discrimination by calling it religious practice. Another 4 years of Trump will set back Black people by 60 years.

CNN still has *news* headlines claiming Trump mocked a disabled reporter (falsely implying that critiquing his poor memory had anything to do with his disability), and asking "How many 'fine people' would march with Nazis" as if only Nazis opposed toppling confederate statues.
America a legacy of political atrocities against its own citizens. Trump &amp; the GOP: War defense gets 54% of every tax dollar.  Massive Increases in: Unemployment  Uninsured Health care  Evictions  Homelessness  Corporate greed  Lawlessness and corruption
Trump takes credit for help Black people by touting examples of government dependency. Giving HBCU tax dollars or establishing opportunity zones. They premise is that Black people cannot succeed without government help.

Trump isn't and never was a Republican. As it turns out he's a Dictating Fascists.
Trump's a master debater for sure.
Another hellish-looking photo.This  is what some parts of our inner-cities look like under trump. And before you say ‚Äú they‚Äôre run by ‚Äòdems‚Äô‚Äù, trump promised he would fix the inner cities. But everyone now sees he lies constantly and only makes things worse.
Trump is a bully.   The veil of him being religious is one of the most off-putting aspects to me.
This reminds me of when Jon declared the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings were going to prevent the Dems from taking the House in 2018.  Arizona is turning blue because fewer and fewer Arizonans identify with Trump and his pathetic enablers like Martha McSally and Jon Gabriel.

All of you are corrupt, biased, fake reporters. You speak to our President with no respect and your tone is way out of touch. You can't stand the fact that not everyone is a democrat and you will try to destroy Trump no matter what. But Trump is better than all of you.
We are on the same team homie. I‚Äôm just extra defensive over Biden as of late, I think he is a great human being and well respected across both parties. He is also moderate which could help bridge the gap between the divisiveness created by Trump.

Let's compare apples to apples.  Compare Sweden to the countries that border it where they took lockdowns seriously and paid their people to stay home.    Don't compare it to the US where NY screwed up and the Trump Administration never coordinated testing or tracing anywhere.
I don't know.  Why does Trump get at least one, sometimes multiple, rapid tests every day along with everyone that he interacts with?   It's almost like it's important to figure out who might be carrying a contagious virus that spreads while asymptomatic.
Because she's testifying and  is using it to posture for Trump
Trump is the one who chose not to follow up the lockdowns with meaningful coordinated testing and contact tracing.

Trump should be charged. After all, he is responsible for the deaths of 160,000 people.
Our Military is nothing but a "prop" for Trump. He wishes he could turn them against his political opponents. Lucky for us, our Military swears an oath to serve &amp;  protect the Constitution and not Donald Trump, a Putin wannabee!

Trump bombs every time.  You‚Äôre okay with that so why does it bother you with Biden?? Lol this video has nothing to do with Biden.  You people are so brainwashed.  You‚Äôll literally jump to the defense of this guy no matter what he does.  I‚Äôm a conservative, by the way.

Yeah I'm pretty much at this point as well. Although, I do want trump out of office, I'm not thrilled with the alternative
I didn't vote for Trump in 2016 I probably will this time around
Your overall point about how percentages can be distorted is well taken. But I think the overriding message of the video is how fucking moronic the President seems to be. It‚Äôs troubling the country doesn‚Äôt rise up and do everything we can do to get Trump out of office.
Donald Trump is black?
The Presidential debate will be Joe Biden, a man who may have lost some cognitive abilities vs. Donald Trump who barely had any to begin with.
I wonder if he's willing to wait until we prosecute his predecessor for his malfeasance and then we can get to Trump.
That‚Äôs because trump‚Äôs supporters are either racist or incredibly stupid.
Thank God Trump jumped into action. 2.5 million lives were projected to be lost. Trump saved some 2.3 million lives. He‚Äôs a true American Hero
The reason Trump detractors hold him in such disdain is that he‚Äôs an  idiot. How can anyone trust or follow Trump‚Äôs judgement when he can‚Äôt grasp the most basic of concepts ?
Ok, I disagree that Obama's handling of the swine flu was worse than Trump's handling of covid. There are about 160k reasons and growing to back that up. I also think Obama was more capable of communicating thoughts on a human level, and had better morals. Now you go dirf nerder.
Trump is a complete moron. How can Republicans mock Biden for his lack of cognitive skills when Trump can‚Äôt understand basic concepts?
So if Trump doesn't speak highly of John Lewis, he's a bad person. John Lewis loathed Trump, suddenly Trump is supposed to be concerned.
I watched the entire interview (regretfully) and I feel covered in trump slime.

Tucker Carlson supports Trump, at the same time he calls the black woman VP candidates unqualified. I'll say it again. Tucker Carlson is a Trump supporter. The most unqualified, unfit person to ever hold the office.

Trump has got to be the least self-aware person on earth. Does he not know how little he is regarded by people who know or have worked with him? It‚Äôs not hyperbole to say he‚Äôs a fucking imbecile.

If Trump had responded to COVID more effectively you might still have a job. But though we disagree politically I don‚Äôt want anyone to be unemployed. Hope you find something soon.
Interesting turn of events: 1. Gov enacts EO to allow cities/counties to make decisions about schools. 2. Montgomery County shuts down Barron Trump's school. 3. Gov "edits" EO so that private schools can do whatever the hell they want.
Trump supporters like to tout his progress on the economy but Obama inherited a near depression and turned the economy around making unemployment drop like a stone. Trump just didn‚Äôt mess it up.

Buck, I‚Äôm not enthusiastic at all about Biden. Blah. But I would sooner vote for a jar of roaches than Donald Trump. The absolute disdain and abhorrence people hold for Trump more than makes up for the lack of passion for Joe Biden.
It's like much of the problems with attention given to Trump events.  He is constantly lying but the fact checking isn't real-time and many people aren't getting the facts straightened out.
It still falls in line with the correlation of more money spent=more votes because Hillary did win the popular vote. Even in this rare instance in which the person actually elected didn‚Äôt spend the most, Trump still worked on behalf of his constituents, the billionaires
Here's the potential downside...  When our alliance with the Anti-Trump republicans ends, will we end up with a repeat of Jimmy Carter replacing Richard Nixon/Gerald Ford only to be followed up by Ronald Reagan?  I do worry about what could happen.

Turkey-US relations will hit rock bottom if Biden is elected.
Obama offered Hillary a key spot in his administration and their primary was certainly nastier than Biden and Sanders‚Äô. Sanders‚Äô decision to accept or decline is his own, but I hope Biden at least gives him the option if he wins.
If the Democrats don‚Äôt, though, Sanders could be more willing. This is probably his final term, and he would in all likelihood be spending his last four years in the minority‚Äîa very boring proposition. In that situation he‚Äôd be far more influential in Biden‚Äôs administration.
I was not a Bernie supporter in the primaries, but if Biden wins, Sanders deserves to be offered a meaningful role in his administration. Any win Biden has will be at least in part because Sanders has rallied his supporters‚Äîrather unwaveringly‚Äîbehind Biden.
I agree. Isn‚Äôt this the combo that Brooks is suggesting could come into being? Perhaps that‚Äôs a stretch for Brooks but not for Biden or Harris.

Agreed. Biden is establishment, not progressive. Despite wide support in the Democratic base, progressives have been locked out again.
The penultimate point is that Biden should not ignore the conduct of the bishops toward Catholic politicians on this issue. I believe, as one of these, that he has an affirmative duty to his fellows to explain one, that they are caught in bed with Trump (try to purge that image)

If the bishop does say something, Biden has the right to process because the case is public. Period.  Does any Catholic politician's opinion matter as to the ability of legislature, Congress or state to ban abortion or even enact an undue burden. No. Period.
There are a few questions to unpack. The first is whether any stray priest can create scandal by denying Biden Communion Canon Law is clear. No. HIs and only his Ordinary can direct that and he has not. It is in the Canon Law and Canon Law trumps Catechism period.

What you're calling lies are little more than hyperbole.   Biden flat out tells false stories with absolutely no basis in truth. Does anybody really believe the Corn Pop story?
People are more likely to comment if they have something negative to say. I wouldn't have chosen Harris over some other options but she's a solid choice. When Biden is president things will be better than they currently are under Trump, and that's all that matters
Biden/Harris isn‚Äôt radical left. They don‚Äôt favor The Green New Deal, they want to throw more money at police and Biden hasn‚Äôt committed to Medicare for All.

Actually, both Biden and Harris are middle of the road corporate Democrats who aren‚Äôt likely to do anything radical. They even favor throwing more money at police...like Republicans do.
Keen observers point out unusual elements of Biden‚Äôs Instagram post with Harris  #FoxNews
Joe Biden likely has early onset dementia, so Kamala Harris would be the actual President if they won.  Even Dems didn‚Äôt want her... that‚Äôs why she dropped out of the race with effectively zero percent support.
How crazy would it be if you were a cardboard cutout and you got front row seats to both the Yankees season opener and Biden's first campaign event
Why is everyone assuming the 2% will all vote for Biden otherwise? Kayne is right leaning so he may also damage Trump‚Ä¶ü§î

Vote for Biden.  They are not morally equivalent.
The reality is that  #JoeBiden will enable things to continue as they are, it will allow  most of the center-left not comfortable with #donaldtrump dog whistlening to go to sleep and for those same people to die anyways. In the long run a Biden victory means they die in vain.
Also, what your saying will occur under a #JoeBiden #POTUS as well.  Little about biden is on the left. In addition, he has every intention on filling his cabinate with #neoliberals that set the stage for 2008. He'll be just as inattentive. His messaging is just softer.
That's correct,  but here is the issue... They Don't  Agree. Lol. It doesn't matter if theyre  democrats or not. At best they are "socially liberal" and that's a super huge stretch for Biden considering his policies. They just have a softer message now so they can get elected.
Actually no but thinking about this in pure terms of trump v Biden is faulty logic. The Dems told us to go  Ourselves. Also it prevents them from self dealing which makes them less money. Rewarding them this year sends the message to keep screwing  progressives.

American politics are the most embarrassing thing about our country. The election is in 4 months and I don‚Äôt know what joe Biden or Donald trump supports. It is just a drama show watching the news about them bashing the other person.

If Biden wins the presidency, but Dems lose the Senate due to malfeasance, nothing will happen.  Trump is a hated enough figure that there will be riots if he wins with this situation, but no way it happens if John Coryn keeps his seat.

Democratic Presidential hopeful Joe Biden took an extreme left turn by picking Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) as his vice presidential running mate. Maybe Harris tells you that she is not a socialist, but her pedigree and her actions say different.

I think the ticket is hypocritical and it‚Äôs identity politics at its finest. I‚Äôd compare this to the same thing that the RNC and McCain did with the Alaskan Queen. Harris is supremely more qualified than Palin, but Biden tabbed her for her sex and race. In the post-BLM climate
All these memes about Pence and Harris having to debte; did we forget that eventually Trump and Biden are going to have to debate? I‚Äôm here for this dumpster fire.

And just in case you don't know where she stands on stuff, here's a handy primer. She's a bit left of center, but as we've seen with Biden, this administration is aware that its base is getting more and more progressive.
1) Did white Joe Biden tell a black American ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt black?‚Äù and support segregationist leaders like Kamala accused him of in the debates? 2) Did Kamala Harris throw black men into prison in California for crimes she knew they didn‚Äôt commit while raising taxes? #VoteTrump2020

All energy must now be directed toward POSITIVE; I'm happily following everyone working for Biden/Harris ticket. Also muting/blocking everyone (5 so far) who feels the need to snark or cut. 2016 should have taught you something. Live in the light or I'm switching you off.
White progressives hopping on here to complain about having to vote for Biden/Harris because it doesn‚Äôt align with your values/aspirations, don‚Äôt.  Welcome to voting as a Black person. We rarely get to vote aspirationally, we usually vote for our survival. Suck it up, vote.

I still think her 'Make Stanford Great Again' son is a bigger liability.  NO ONE cares about Benghazi except Republican lawmakers who are all convinced they can leverage it somehow.  But even Biden gets testy when they ask about his son, and he's a very experienced campaigner.
I just had a stress dream that I was Joe Biden, and I forgot to pick my VP, and now I'm scrambling.
Biden said he'd announce VP by Aug. 1. Missed that deadline. Then said it would come first week of August. Missed that deadline. Bad look to keep missing your own self-imposed deadlines.
Biden‚Äôs advocacy for mental health, esp in our schools, gives me a glimmer of hope.
I care more who the Veep is now. I know Obama did not announce Biden as his running mate till late August.

Oh c'mon, like Biden uses DPJ. I bet he's a Jetsuite X guy. Or Wheels Up, lol
Either or... Biden will have my vote regardless
Wholeheartedly agree. Biden won headlines and praise for that decision when he announced it in a debate in March, but now he's picking from a pool half the size of what it should be.
All of Biden's VP candidates have baggage, Klobuchar included. It's down to Harris and Rice. I'll be shocked if it's not Harris.
Nothing will change my mind about voting for Biden. ‚ù§Ô∏è

NO TO SUSAN RICE AND BIDEN! THE ODD COUPLE OF POLITICS. BOTH LIARS! BOTH CORRUPT. BENGHAZI IS FULLY REMEMBERED AND RICE'S CRAP WITH IT! BIDEN DOES NOT REMEMBER, BUT WE KNOW HE SUPPORTED OBY. SICK. ALL NO GOOD FOR AMERICA!
TO HELL WITH SUSAN RICE AND BIDEN! YES, BENGHAZI WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN! WE HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN YOUR LIES ABOUT PRES TRUMP AND INVESTIGATIONS OF GEN FLYNN AND THE IRAN MONEY AND CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY AND YOUR HATE OF AMERICA!
Where‚Äôs Hunter ? You ain‚Äôt black Biden is a bobble head that is a Trojan horse and empty vessel for Sanders and AOC and quid pro quo pelosi and Schumer and Robert Francis (beto) bozo Orourke !
Please when Biden says something stupid let it go let the focus be on how stupid he is but when you chime in now they‚Äôre all talking about you so just let it go when he says something stupid
You ain‚Äôt black Biden is a bobble head and Trojan horse and empty vessel for Sanders and AOC and quid pro quo pelosi and Schumer and Robert Francis (beto) bozo Orourke and rode a bike WITHOUT a helmet....
I don't care what her approval rating is she can't be VP , not this time.  Look I like her I think she has potential but we are not voting for Biden n will stay home if KH not VP. We put Biden where he is. He owe us
HER ONLY FOLLOWING IS CNN AND BIDEN
Gingrich: Biden embraces Chinese dictatorship |
so when Trump loses the election his cult can try to say that Biden is causing incredible tax hikes.
Biden went after Obama hard - part of the reason Biden was selected was to show Obama didn't hold grudges!  '08 was a long time ago, but it wasn't that long.
This is just the beginning of the unbelievable horse shit that Biden's VP is going to have to put up with.
You ain‚Äôt black Biden is a bobble head and a Trojan horse and an empty vessel for Sanders and AOC and quid pro quo pelosi and Schumer and Robert Francis (beto) bozo Orourke !
Xi of China loves you ain‚Äôt black Biden !
Correct and quid pro quo pelosi aounds a lot like you ain‚Äôt black Biden cmon man
Has anyone developed the You ain‚Äôt black Biden translation app yet ?
Leo Terrell a black civil rights attorney who is a demon rat üêÄ (Democrat) says that you ain‚Äôt black Biden is a racist !
You ain‚Äôt black Biden cmon man is a bobble head and Trojan horse and empty vessel for Sanders and Schumer and quid pro quo pelosi and Robert Francis (beto) bozo Orourke !
Russia is trying to ‚Äòdenigrate‚Äô Biden while China prefers ‚Äòunpredictable‚Äô Trump not be reelected, senior U.S. inte‚Ä¶
BIDEN DOES NOT GO TO CHURCH! HE IS IN BASEMENT!
How I read this:  Joe Biden 51% Donald Trump 40% also Donald Trump 9%  too close.
Kamala Harris is the most logical VP choice for Joe Biden. Susan Rice makes sense as part of the administration, just not as vice president.
PRES TRUMP IS DEFEATING THE FAR LEFT! HE HAS THE TOOLS WITHOUT TWITTER AND FACEBOOK! HIS RALLIES AND THE FLYING ROOSTER HAS THE DEMS ON THE RUN AND THEY ARE QUAKING IN THEIR BOOTS. BIDEN IS SO AFRAID THAT HE SPEAKS AGAINST BLACKS AND HISPANICS!
BIDEN WILL HAVE TO EXPAND BASEMENT TO LIVE IN AND BS IN WITH OBAMA AND RICE. IF HE CAN REMEMBER WHERE THE DOORS ARE.
Joe Biden hasn‚Äôt picked a VP yet because his aides have to continually talk him out of picking Sarah Palin.
Biden didn‚Äôt beat Harris, (fear of) Sanders did.‚ÄúWrong Trump‚Äù trending is disgusting. Imagine if someone said stuff like that about Beau Biden.
Big deal: Tucker Carlson mispronounced Kamala Harris' first name on his show on Tuesday 8/11.  Not a big deal: Here's Joe Biden mispronouncing Harris‚Äô first name in the same way on 8/12.
Taylor Swift, the artist that has made millions off of writing songs about her problems with men, endorses Joe Biden.   The irony is laughable.
I'll watch Biden's speech because of the potential for disaster, but that's it. I already know what the rest of them are going to say.
Everyone loves Pres Obama &amp; VP Biden
#Obamawasbetterateverything your jealousy is showing again. I love how Obama, Biden and Clinton live rent free in the empty space where your brain should be. #PresidentJoe #AmericaStrongerWithBiden
WHY IS JOE BIDEN AHEAD OF DONALD J.TRUMP IN EVERY POLL AROUND THE COUNTRY ?, IT CERTAINLY LOOKS LIKE PLENTY OF AMERICANS ARE QUITE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE BIDEN-HARRIS TICKET. DONALD J.TRUMP IS REALLY SOUNDING QUITE DESPERATE, HE KNOWS HIS TIME IS RUNNING OUT FAST.
Counsel to the democrats writing their platform, if they do write one, and I am not sure why they would, just don't give those wanting to attack Biden/Harris with advertising bait, to attack those two good leaders.
Oh, please Brad, Democrats value each other, especially Pres Obama &amp; VP Biden
Hopefully Durham will document how many criminals served under Obama and BIDEN. One down - Clinesmith - and lots more in line.
Who is this ‚Äúwe‚Äù  I‚Äôm voting Biden  so it‚Äôs not me The majority of the country want you gone and it‚Äôs not just China that wants Biden, the majority of the world wants Biden!!!
"The secret is keeping your eye on the big picture of incumbent strength and performance. And don't pay any attention to the polls, the pundits, the day-to-day ups and downs of the campaign. And that's what the keys gauge. The big picture."#BidenHarris2020
It's a brave new world, aren't we lucky.
You sure this is accurate.   Did you subtract out the mumbling nonsensical , rattling , ones including the sniffing and leg hair?  I think Biden is down around twenty....and of those, 5 he just took Trumps and reworded them
Old white people. My son who is 54, lives in TX, voted for Trump &amp; regrets it, he's voting for Biden, says the US will not progress until all old white people die off. I'm one of those OWP (who didn't vote for Trump) and I think he's right. White people fear people of color.

Screw the election. I say they have a trial by combat! tRump in one corner Biden in the other. In fact once we have candidates selected from primaries this is how it should be from now on.
Go Biden/Harris. America is waiting for you.
üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èKamala was my first choice in the primaries.  Biden's been my choice every time he ran for anything.  From the get-go I thought they'd make an excellent ticket!  Been calling for her to be his VP choice for months! #BidenHarris2020
Calling it right now. If Biden wins the election, he steps down in late 2021 citing health concerns, making Kamala Harris the first female president.
Only if the vote is ridiculously one sided in support of Biden/lHarris.  As Hans Solo warned the young man who had the force, and didn't yet know it, "don't get cocky."
"...Trump‚Äôs overtly racist appeals to ‚Äúsuburban housewives,‚Äù whom he believes can be scared into supporting him if he tells them often enough that Biden wants poor Blacks to move into their neighborhoods." #whitesuburbanMom here. You don't scare me, #Trump
Biden campaign sends scathing statement in response to Trump stoking false conspiracy theory
Really,  Biden yep.  But I don't think Senators have Secret Service protection?
46th President of the US, President Joe Biden; 47th President of the United States, President Kamala Harris.
ALL INTELLIGENT AMERICANS WILL BE VOTING FOR JOE BIDEN, ONLY UNEDUCATED INDIVIDUALS WILL VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP.
Mysoginist asshole üá∫üá≤
Who cares if HRC won the popular vote? That‚Äôs not how we elect presidents. Trump won 84 percent of the counties. That also doesn‚Äôt matter.   For Biden to win (and he‚Äôs probably going the popular vote by 10M but again, who cares?) he‚Äôs got to flip 3 or 4 states.
Biden doesn't take any questions at all...
Trump consistently takes questions from the media lol. If Biden wants to replace Trump don't you think he would at least act like a president?
You're right, the government has no authority to tell you how to breathe.   So why not try what Biden suggested and just be responsible.  Is that asking so much?
You sound like Biden. You ok?
You made a Terrible Statement today about Joe Biden! You should be fired!
Biden can‚Äôt tie his shoes, let alone leave his basement.
Joe Biden must release his complete health records. He also must take the same cognitive test the President Trump took. This is a minimum the American public should expect

Arbitrarily mandating mask wearing is not within the purview of the President. By what authority does the federal government mandate masks?  Those little cotton masks Biden wears do nothing. They barely keep out dust.
Sure, no one would have died if Biden had been in office, wearing his little cotton masks that he fingers all the time.  They're ineffective.  They are a placebo to make you feel good.

I can‚Äôt wait to see who is Biden‚Äôs AG.  Some heads are going to be rolling. Can‚Äôt wait for that piece of crap Barr to be out of a job and possibly behind bars.

Vice President Biden, I‚Äôm a 65 year old White girl, and I woke up feeling that way too!! #BidenHarris
So Biden admittedly picked the person for the 2nd highest position of power in the US based solely on their gender and race, for political gain, and we are supposed to trust his judgment and her qualifications?
Isn‚Äôt it cute how you are trying to spin the fact that there are so many talking points and valid claims as to why a Biden/Harris WH would be disastrous for out country specifically black and brown people. Just ask all those in CA.
"Trump inherited the longest economic expansion in history and then like everything else he inherited he ran it straight into the ground"
Choice of  shows  is a big man in contrast to the smallness and pettiness of   From and Fuller: The Biden-Harris Ticket, COVID Aid Packages, and Wall Street Influence in DC
Does anyone else dream about Obama and Biden walking into the Oval Office. Smacking trump on the head, they take off the sunglasses but leave face masks on and they tell Trump to LEAVE. The bosses are back!
I guess he is ignoring the fact that Obama - Biden inherited a 10%+ unemployment and dropped it to 4%.
The morning after the amazing night before. While the Biden/Harris ticket is amazing &amp; will charge up the base of those with hearts, empathy and the need for change. It is only a matter of time until the party of complicity with racism &amp; hate cut loose on their only target. VOTE!
Do you think the Biden camp would be smart to debate Trump and Pence.  Seems counterintuitive to me; Trump is such, that one can‚Äôt have an intelligent debate or conversation with him - Pence is little better.
Biden and Harris kicked ass and were smart, informed and articulate! üòÄüòÄ  The POS is still president and his on-camera ramblings are incoherent...ü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æ  Other than that nothing new...
I live next to a Trump supporter and will be acquiring many "Biden - Harris 2020" signs for my yard.
Yes, I am THRILLED that Biden picked Kamala Harris - he made the right choice to help unite American &amp; to defeat the Trump virus!  #BidenHarris
Fox Attacks Biden For Wanting To Raise Corporate Taxes  via
Biden launched his campaign on this lie....he said this is what made him want to run.  It's only gone downhill for him from that point.
Don't forget we have to have a drink at McGarvey's in Annapolis when Biden/Harris wins &amp; the Trump virus is over! ü§£üíô
She is smiling big now!  It has to be bc Biden picked Kamalaüíô
I am a former republican &amp; former trump supporter. I look back at who I used to be &amp; what I believed in in embarrassment &amp; shame.  I am proudly voting for Biden/Harris2020!  I would also like to thank  &amp;  for helping me become who I am todayüíôüíôüíôüåä
No lockdown no Biden.
This is coming from Joe "I wrote the Crime Bill" Biden.
Remember the timeline of all this though. In May Bernie was the front runner not Biden. Biden didn't get the lead until after the lockdown and all campaigns stopped. The media was the sole source of truth.
That should be a real treat. How much will Biden get from Ukraine this time?
It was so good to see you with Joe Biden. You delivered a great speech. Very powerful, very hopeful for pit and our children‚Äôs future.
Kamala Harris Is the Future, So Mike Pence May Well Be History
Vote all you want. The people have spoken. It‚Äôs Biden and Harris! A no brainer for those of us with a brain.
In a Biden world, Europe. Trump re-elected, SC.
I've helped numerous folk sun elections and none of them who followed my advise has ever lost. In the age of covid19 the strategies Biden should utilize are simple but they will be effective in reaching the people by over coming their fears
I've worked behind the scenes for decades and would have national name recognition but I turned down many request for interviews which I now regret. I could assist Biden in his efforts to become president of the United States.
This sounds like a Russian propaganda talking point, trying to paint Biden as frail and spook the Republican base into visualizing Kamala Harris as President.  As if that would be a bad thing. &gt; Fox News is State News &lt;
You didn‚Äôt hear? She talked Biden into supporting Medicare for All..
Right! And I hope both Biden and Kamala will remind American voters about it during this campaign.
I think that comment was addressed to those calling themselves leftists/progressives who are saying they won't vote for Biden in part because they think letting Trump make things worse for 4 more years will force the country to swing hard left in 2024. If we make it that long.
I bet he wasn‚Äôt happy with who and his VP will be facing during debates. Neither Trump nor Pence can handle the power and eloquence of Biden and Harris.
Your not pro-liife Mr Kasich if you support Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Your not conservative. Your a traitor, and you betray everyone who helped you get into Office.  Go home, and stay out of politics. Your making a fool out of yourself, and your betraying your country.
More Biden shade.
Joe Biden is a dog face pony soldier.
You are talking about a medical doctor.  There are doctorates offered in many different fields. And Jill Biden happens to have earned one, making her a doctor.
Biden is delivering an awesome speech. Very powerful, very eloquent, very promising and full of hope for a great future.
Steve just a friendly reminder Joe Biden is not a Baby Boomer. Keep up the good work!
She's not far left to the uninformed who will believe anything Wallace says. However, she is far left, as is Biden. There are no moderate Democrats anymore.
What?  Shocking.  Didn't he reverse everything Obama did?  Yep, he did.  And Yes, Biden will reverse everything Trump did to take this country off the rails.
I agree with that. Racism is stupid. But I don‚Äôt think Trump or Biden will/can do that. It‚Äôs going to take a lot more than a president. We need time, action and patience. But what do you mean by systemic?
China, Russia and Iran will be voting Biden. I‚Äôm voting #Trump2020   Fake driver's licenses flooding into US from China, other countries, US says    Explore the Fox News apps that are right for you at
You do realize how many innocent people kamala put in jail right? Biden/Harris get support to get back at trump. But y‚Äôall have done no research on what they actually stand for... Trump is no where close to perfect either. But make sure you know what you‚Äôre supporting.
I think that Biden was trying to convince Harris to join his ticket. Not the other way around.
I'm calling it now, on Biden's first day he steps down and Kamala becomes president
No KellyAnne no one is ruminating over Hilary except you and Trumpeters who can't seem to move out of 2016. It's 2020 and Biden/Harris will wipe the floor with Trump. Bye bye Trumpdom! Don't let the door kick you in the arse!
Don‚Äôt forget Reagan and Bush Sr. let the CIA flood American cities with cocaine in the 80‚Äôs. Pretty sure Biden and Kamala didn‚Äôt do that lol
Some white politicians actually care about black people, would you rather have another white Vice President? At least it‚Äôs some kind of progression, Kamala is like 4 different races. Much rather have her and Biden over Trump and Pence any day
DONALD TRUMP IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIED OF THE BIDEN-HARRIS TICKET.
I thought it might be a visual on the excitement of a Biden/Harris ticket.
Hey progressives: Your dude is telling you to vote for the Biden/Harris ticket. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚úÖ
Sorry honey. YOU are not a moderate if you are choosing Biden/Harris.  Biden is an empty suit being filled with extreme Left values.  If you love them so much, why not move into one of those lovely cities being plagued by rioters?  That‚Äôs the life you are choosing for your family
Where do you get the impression that Biden and Harris want to murder and incarcerate all black people? Thought that was Trump, Bush and Reagan?
you are a total disgrace.Other countries are laughing at you. Stop name calling, playing golf, bragging about yourself and take care of business. Want to talk about bankrupting casinos? Biden/Harris all the way! #WeHaveHerBack #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica
I haven‚Äôt been this excited since I voted for Obama/Biden, the first time around. I wish team Biden/Harris much success. You have a chance to make history. You can only go in one direction, and that‚Äôs up.  #WeHaveHerBack
Biden doesn't plan to run in 2024.
The biggest thing Biden has in his favor is that he is not Donald Trump.
Ohh sh you are in trouble now. I suspect you will begin to go lower than low at this point. I doubt team Biden and Harris will drop to your level so I will do the dirty work for them. #WeHaveHerBack
As the father of a strong African-American woman I am so excited in President Biden‚Äôs choice as a political partner. I wish the team of Biden and Harris much success. Go team Biden! #WeHaveHerBack
Dream Biden/Harris cabinet? AG:  SecretaryState:  SecretaryTreas:  SecretaryVet:    ATF:
Either she lied in the her view that she believed Biden's accusers or she's willing to set that view aside for her own personal gain.
At least under trump they ain‚Äôt start rolling back weed legalization. Biden and Harris will have niggas getting felonies for weed
Yeah bra I might not vote no cap. I‚Äôm not sold that Kampala and Biden are any better than orange this is fucking bullshit
Biden.... read the room
Anyone that enables fascism can fuck right off I don't care how much you CHUDs hate Biden from the other end of the spectrum. No tolerance for Trump supporters.
And thank God this new feature exist so I don't have to have make America great again morons and Biden supporters finding my presence just to spew BS at me
Because if we end up getting 4 more years of trump or if we get the first four years of Biden I hate to break it to you but we are all going to be screwed anyway that's the truth neither of these ass clowns don't care about you or this country's future
Why did they bother retracting this story in July?
If  really believes in Joe Biden and the potential of his campaign, she should resign her Senate seat before the election.   If she doesn‚Äôt, it‚Äôll tell us all we need to know about her confidence in Biden.
Biden / Harris stronger than petty pence and don, the president of and for CONS!
I know not what the days up to Nov. 3 hold for any of us, but I feel a sense of peace tonight hoping that with Pres. Biden &amp; VP Harris our democracy is going to be ok, not that the path of the next few days &amp; months will be easy, but that there is a path forward. We needed it. :)
"She was very very #nasty, to ‚Äî one of the reasons that surprised me, she was very ‚Äî she was probably nastier than even #Pocahontas to Joe #Biden. She was very disrespectful to Joe Biden, and it's hard to pick somebody that's that disrespectful." - #Trump
joe biden im literally so done with you
‚ÄúIf and when Biden decides to step aside‚Äù   Joe Biden is a trojan horse. Unbelievable.
Joe Biden has officially chosen Kamala Harris as his running mate in the 2020 Presidential Election
Biden are you absolutely lost your mind  with this pic.
Token woman of color so suburban neoliberals can say "see? Biden IS woke. Forget the crime bill and his own voting history as well as Kamala's history as a prosecutor, we got our token so if Orange Man wins again it's on those silly progressives! Anyway, back to brunch!"
Awesome! Go for it Biden-Harris.
Is it really just tokenism, celebration for no other reason than Biden/the DNC selecting a biracial woman to try and look woke? Or is it that the arguably the worst VP pick in response to the distaste with cops across the country is good because, BLM is just an "annoyance"?
Honest question, what about her is amazing? She's most well known for A) being at best an incompetent and at worst dirty DA/State GA covering and helping dirty cops/letting innocent people rot and B) saying she believes Biden's accusers and dropping out before the primaries began
And I‚Äôm not even sure a Biden Harris ticket will beat trump
Whats up with the Trumps donating to her campaign? I knew any Biden pick wouldn't be as progressive as I would like - but now I'm suspicious
Actually it's on the dems for propping up a racist+senile rapist who's platform is just "I'm not Trump but I'm also for every conservative position I can be while still being referred to as a lib" and adding the cop-enabling DA that said she believes Biden is a rapist AND racist
"The senator from California fulfills Biden's pledge to name a woman and responds to the expectation that he would pick the first woman of color ever to serve on a national ticket."  I'm very happy ‚ò∫Ô∏è with #KamalaHarris as #VPHarris
Saw this first thing when I opened my LinkedIn today.  I try to keep my politics off there, but it‚Äôs everywhere. #socialism #KamalaHarris #Biden #communism #whiteprivilege #joebiden #blacklivesmatter #blackexcellence #trump2020 #WalkAway
It‚Äôs going to be interesting to see when we are going to hear from Joe Biden again. Now that Officer  is getting all the attention, she is the de facto candidate #BidenHarris
She has the potential to have two terms separate from Biden. Say what?
I haven‚Äôt been this excited about a Presidential ticket since Obama/Biden 2012.
Congrats to the Biden campaign for the wise selection of Kamala Harris for VP. She is strong, committed, and ready to lead. #KamalaHarrisForVP
We don‚Äôt care what 45 does or says. We are forward thinking and will support Biden and Harris so diligently and with all our love for our country! üá∫üá∏ üåä üá∫üá∏ üåä üá∫üá∏
Val, you are a force to be reckoned with. I‚Äôm sure we will be seeing you in Biden‚Äôs Cabinet!
Me, too!  When Biden entered th race, Lily asked Michael who he thought would win the primary and who that person‚Äôs running mate would be.  Biden/Harris was his guess
Phony Kamala, is that all he's got. #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Cant wait for the Biden/Harris inauguration-Trumplethinskin wont be there though cause hes to immature to handle it, just like everything else.
Kamala Harris. Congrats. I just made a donation to Biden/Harris  Now let's go win this &amp; don't forget the kids (March for Our Lives)  They just won huge. People first over hate, guns &amp; greed. Step up folks we only have 91 days.
Donald Trump is no longer running against Joe Biden. He‚Äôs running against Kamala Harris.
So freakin happy right now!!!! Biden/Harris
No one cares. We're to busy congratulating Biden/Harris. Hes been upstaged as usual. #ByeDon2020 #anylivingthingotherthantrump #AmericaStrongerWithBiden
Couldn‚Äôt be happier with  choice!  is a strong, proven leader who will help our next President rebuild what Trump has destroyed.   Time to get to work and do everything humanly possible to elect the Biden-Harris ticket this November! #BidenHarris2020
The Biden campaign need to be giving max guidance at state level for the handling of postal voting.  People need to know how best to expedite successful ‚Äòmail in‚Äô ballots without the worry of US Postal Service ‚Äòissues‚Äô and the need to do this as soon as they may.
Kamala Harris selected by Joe Biden as vice-presidential running mate
You've been upstaged by Biden/Harris. Bye boy. #TrumpHasNoCredibility  #anylivingthingotherthantrump #AmericaStrongerWithBiden

Oh my god joe Biden went with the cop! X fucking DRemoval of anything in the post office is all PMG not POTUS sorry to burst your conspiracy bubble.   That‚Äôs right the postal union endorsed Biden, I wish my union would stop doing that üí© that‚Äôs not what I pay them for.
Lady G says what now?  How much you love Joe Biden?
Again pictures don‚Äôt prove anything. They had his grandchild in one video and it was at His fathers funeral and Biden was consoling him!!! Fucking moron trump supporters with their phony ass accusations yet they will overlook trumps horrible crimes and sexual assaults
Haha Biden will be in jail before the election
And she‚Äôll be lying all the way to November 3rd... Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate
If it weren‚Äôt so very sad it would be laughable... WATCH: Biden Repeatedly REFUSES To Answer Reporter‚Äôs Questions. Trump Shreds Him.
How do you go from calling Biden a racist to supporting him Kamala?   Kamala - ‚ÄúIT WAS A DEBATE IT WAS A DEBATE IT WAS A DEBATE!‚Äù   Yeah... we got that... but you called him racist   ‚ÄúIT WAS A DEBATE DEBATE DEBATE!‚Äù
Bullshit!!! If you knock Biden you are a trump supporter
This is something that Joe Biden could give to his Vice President and sit Bach and enjoy the show!
Their obfuscatory wording aside, "racists now less likely to vote for Biden" is a fine problem to have, as far as I'm concerned. The more clear it is that there's no potential benefit to chasing their votes, the better off the party and the rest of us will be.
There would have been millions die if we would have listened to Joe Biden. He would have let all flights come in from China.
Heard right wing radio speculating Biden may skip a Presidential debate painting alleged possibility as something really bad ignoring reality Trump skipped Primary debate 2016 for a veterans‚Äô fundraiser. Veterans ever get $? We know Trump used his charity as personal slush fund.
I think you mean Obama and Biden.
At least Biden can spell ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Biden is probably one of the most corrupt politicians in history. His family has become wealthy during his political career which has benefited only him.
Don‚Äôt accuse Biden of Cognitive decline Donnie watch your DVR and see for yourself how demented you sound..and ask your aides to stop lying to you..to give you the real briefings and documents instead of sugarcoating as to not hurt your feelings.. #MadGrandpa
Note ‚Äújobs created‚Äù Pence bragged were already existing jobs not jobs created with people put back to work by businesses as condition of their getting COVID-19 bailout as well as 1m+ added to unemployment rolls each week + Obama/Biden had longest stretch of job growth in history.
Herman Cain is dead b/c of attending a Trump rally and you are calling Biden/Harris nuts..tweeting from a deceased mans account however vile he was while living is disgusting..Shame on you
They never have reciepts. In this instance, it is a projection. This is what the so-called ‚ÄúProgressives‚Äù were hoping for when the thought Warren had a realistic chance if being the VP choice. That or using the 25th on Biden to force Warren to the Presidency.
Colin Powell endorses Biden - Harris
Wonder what 18-29 vs over 65 would say about enthusiasm for protesting. Both over 65s &amp; 18-29s now polling for Biden over Trump. Cynics might say Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúit is what it is‚Äù let them (old) caused 65+ shift but maybe they remember who they were in 1960s protesting for civil rights.
"Because Biden chose her as his running mate."
Sorry, I googled this &amp; this person actually seems to exist.  Can he really be bishop affiliated with Catholic Church &amp; be so disrespectful of another Catholic just because that Catholic (Biden) happens to not share his political views?  I guess so but why does church tolerate?
2020: Just Biden My Time  2020: Any Port In A Storm  2020: WELL, I GUESS  2020: The Garbage Will Do
Another sad day for the Democratic Party. We need lower taxes and less regulation to get more jobs.  The Biden/Harris ticket wants more taxes and more regulation.  They don't seem to care about the American worker or the families they support.
Donald is doing his damndest to discredit a great man like Biden because Sonald Trump doesn‚Äôt have shit to offer America after his destructive and ineffective leadership over the last 3 1/2 years in office. Don is a disgrace that needs to be thrown out! DUMP THE TURD NOVEMBER 3RD
Respectfully, my screen shows you ‚Äúfollowing‚Äù Bishop Thomas Tobin.  From what I‚Äôve read of you I‚Äôm surprised because he tweeted Biden/Harris ticket is first time in long time a Catholic hasn‚Äôt been on dem ticket.   Odd. Since Biden is Catholic.  Was this account hacked?
The Race For The White House is being run by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.  The Racist for the White House is what the Republicans do.

Harris isn‚Äôt perfect. Neither is Biden. No candidate is. Everyone has flaws. But, that doesn‚Äôt mean we shouldn‚Äôt fight like hell to get Biden/Harris elected
Any Klobuchar would have been an excellent choice! Joe Biden had an amazing pool of talent to choose from. I think Biden made the best choice, I‚Äôve like Kamala Harris from the start, but, there were truly no wrong answers on this one.
Should the Biden/Harris campaign play James Brown‚Äôs ‚ÄúMashed Potatoes, USA‚Äù to remind us of tRump‚Äôs daddy issues?

Tucker Carlson calls Biden-Harris the 'first entirely hollow presidential ticket in American history'   As much as Carlson has sold out America with his one-sided bias reporting, he really shouldn‚Äôt refer to anybody as ‚Äúhollow‚Äù. What a POS you are Tucker!!
I would have if I could have. But since Biden is just about to take over, I'll stay a while.
So I asked Joe Biden if he had and#y advice for me after they dragged me out of the Oval Office and I think he said ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt fro the Soap‚Äù! What do you think he meant?
Yeah, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are really "far left". Be honest: you guys had this tweet ready to go no matter who was picked. You got nothing. You're stuck backing the worst president in history, and you have nothing to offer the American people.
It makes them less bad than trump? What do you mean? Vote Biden, or get ready to deal with trump for 4 more years
Do you honestly think Biden is afraid to debate Trump üòÇ have you seen all of the dumb üí© Trump has said just in the last 24 hours..
And Biden isn't intimidated by it.   Trump's thin (orange) skin couldn't handle a valid criticism (or figure out how to grow from it).  Trump's comment speaks volumes to the difference in character between the two presidential candidates!
18-39 age group historically least likely to vote will win for Biden along with white suburban women who don‚Äôt like being misogynistically stereotyped as ‚Äúhousewives‚Äù by Trump any more than as racists not wanting low income housing. For 1st time more Americans under 39 than over.

I don't have a lot to say about the VP pick because there is no one he could have reasonably picked I wouldn't have liked better than I like Joe Biden.  My plans to vote for the Democratic candidate to unseat Donald Trump weren't going to change based on his pick.
It's also fully possible that Senator Harris will speak both in the designated VP nom spot *and* speak before Biden? She might want a chance to speak for herself and then bring it more towards unity and hyping up the candidate towards the end.

Great pic of you both. Congrats Kampala - I have to tell you I was hoping that VP Biden would pick you. Good Luck and I for sure will be voting for you.
I kinda expected Biden to shock the world and say he was going with his gut so choosing a woman nicknamed Mustang Sally or Rizzo from Grease as his VP.

Person needs to think of Biden as bus not candidate. If goal is get further left than Joe is going best to get on bus with Joe &amp; go as far left as Joe is going.  Why?  Because not going left not voting Joe allows Trump to take country and this person opposite way from their goal.
That ‚Äúnerdy ass‚Äù is a lawyer, and has more qualifications to speak on politics and laws than most people you probably site or follow.   Can‚Äôt call his followers braindead or ‚Äúwashed‚Äù when you‚Äôre ‚Äúridin with Biden‚Äù who‚Äôs campaign promises are ‚Äútrump, but ‚Äúbetter‚Äù‚Äù
In contrast, all of the women in consideration to be Biden's VP are capable, accomplished, intelligent women.  Sarah Palin is none of those things. This is why she no longer has a political career. Where does Sarah Palin go to recover her career? She doesn't.

I certainly will back your call for Biden to NOT use that type of rhetoric again.
Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris as running hate
So that video of Biden on Turkey going around was made in December‚Ä¶  At least we see it now. Any Turkish-American who would think about voting for Sleepy Joe better have second thoughts.
It‚Äôs sort of a Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs cat situation. Your tweets are both insignificant figments of the imagination or the sole reason why Biden won‚Äôt be president up until the precise moment someone is declared winner. Although if Trump finds a way to cancel the election, anything goes
Sigh, it was disgraceful rhetoric but it was also clearly a metaphor talking about an effect of bank deregulation.  I DO NOT defend Biden for that.  But nor is it something to hold an 8-yr grudge over.  You can't defend things Trump says every day that are more offensive

Turkey-US relations will hit rock bottom if Biden is elected.
Obama offered Hillary a key spot in his administration and their primary was certainly nastier than Biden and Sanders‚Äô. Sanders‚Äô decision to accept or decline is his own, but I hope Biden at least gives him the option if he wins.
If the Democrats don‚Äôt, though, Sanders could be more willing. This is probably his final term, and he would in all likelihood be spending his last four years in the minority‚Äîa very boring proposition. In that situation he‚Äôd be far more influential in Biden‚Äôs administration.
I was not a Bernie supporter in the primaries, but if Biden wins, Sanders deserves to be offered a meaningful role in his administration. Any win Biden has will be at least in part because Sanders has rallied his supporters‚Äîrather unwaveringly‚Äîbehind Biden.
I agree. Isn‚Äôt this the combo that Brooks is suggesting could come into being? Perhaps that‚Äôs a stretch for Brooks but not for Biden or Harris.

Agreed. Biden is establishment, not progressive. Despite wide support in the Democratic base, progressives have been locked out again.
The penultimate point is that Biden should not ignore the conduct of the bishops toward Catholic politicians on this issue. I believe, as one of these, that he has an affirmative duty to his fellows to explain one, that they are caught in bed with Trump (try to purge that image)
Marist (top rated pollster) has Biden up even more.
Aw! How much you deeply care about the wellbeing of Joe Biden really shows! üôÑ
If the bishop does say something, Biden has the right to process because the case is public. Period.  Does any Catholic politician's opinion matter as to the ability of legislature, Congress or state to ban abortion or even enact an undue burden. No. Period.
There are a few questions to unpack. The first is whether any stray priest can create scandal by denying Biden Communion Canon Law is clear. No. HIs and only his Ordinary can direct that and he has not. It is in the Canon Law and Canon Law trumps Catechism period.
I plan to vote for Biden to restore our Democracy.
How much you want to bet that Trump will declare victory in Election Night and claim all sorts of problems as the mail in votes shows that Biden wins. It will be important to fire up his base so he can make money from the MAGAs in the future.

Sean, the DEMs true plan stated in Lance Wallnau video. Biden is going to withdraw due to health just before debates, so staying in basement till then. Harris will become presidential nominee by default. Her plan is to revers all of Trumps actions to redeem Obama!!

If Biden/ Harris win they should do 2 things ASAP: 1) Fill all agency IG positions with new people and investigate all of Trump's cabinet leaders for crimes/violations. 2) Have the DOJ to investigate Kanye West, Kushner, etc. for voter/election fraud in every state West filed.

Harris just showed why Biden chose her as his running mate  A very good speech from Kamala Harris. The President Joe Biden With The Vice President is on their way to The White House.
When Biden told Kamala he was tapping her for V.P. Kamala responded: "o.k. but dont tell my husband."
People are more likely to comment if they have something negative to say. I wouldn't have chosen Harris over some other options but she's a solid choice. When Biden is president things will be better than they currently are under Trump, and that's all that matters
Joe Biden says he would prevented all this by consulting Anthony Fauci.  Wow... who would have thought of that?
Biden would blame America.
Biden/Harris isn‚Äôt radical left. They don‚Äôt favor The Green New Deal, they want to throw more money at police and Biden hasn‚Äôt committed to Medicare for All.
"On climate, Harris called for a carbon fee for polluters and helped introduce the Green New Deal to spend trillions to spur clean energy."  Biden-Harris: Higher taxes. Reduced standard of living.

I‚Äôm far from ok with what the Democrats want.  Biden is a socialist in a pact with Sanders now and Harris is even worse than Sanders. These people will destroy our country.
It is not his fault cos China purposely let that virus loose. Our economy WAS great. What Biden said he would do, Trump has already done. Trump did something historic which Muslims around the world owe a debt of gratitude 2 Trump. It will change the world for future generations.
My mother loved Fox News though. I have a picture of her as she died in 2014.  She loved Trump.  Now she wears her mask and would vote Biden.  Night Mom.
That is the dumbest statement. Russia or China does not want Trump to win. They will run all over weak ass Biden. Trump has just accomplished something no one else could ever do.  Muslims around the world owe a debt of gratitude to Trump. It is historic and change the world.
Biden should debate Trump and surprise him by inviting his dead brother.
Why have one? Because it will show how incompetent he is. They gave Obama on record stating to not let your guard down because Biden could fu#k things up. But i guess you did not read that because the crooked media will not print such juicy things. Dem party is deceitful.
Um..if the Democratic party believes in that, then he has 2 go with the party. If he doesn't go with the party, then he will lose a lot of women's votes which could cost him the election. Biden refuses 2 take questions. The party is keeping him away from answering questions. WHY?
You too Victor!! üç¶üç¶üç¶
Girl...what do U know. Besides if he says he is going 2 do it, then he has 2. The trouble with Biden is that he has no balls &amp; is easily influenced. He is a weak leader. 50 years &amp; he has done shit. His VP is the worse far-left person who believed Biden's sexual assault charges.

Biden cheats. He lies. He is corrupt. According to records, Biden was in that meeting with Obama to go after Flynn by falsifying the FISA warrant to spy on a duly elected President which is a treasonous act which blackens both Obama and Biden's integrity, yet you go after Trump.
President Trump has a lot of followers. He has a right 2 give his opinion. I have seen Harris already lying 2 the public. I have seen Biden lying 2 the people as well &amp; nothing is done. He lies. He plagiarizes. He stole  President Trump's platform. B
Let me just say that many people were very moved by Kamala Harris's speech when she appeared with Biden in Delaware. I found her engaging and sincere. Are candidates trying to get an academy award or are they running for office?
"China would prefer Joe Biden", said Nancy Pelosi. How ridiculous! Why should we care about what China prefers? One thing for sure is that America will become China's if Joe Biden is elected. He has no principle! He bows to evil &amp; lawless. That's predicable.

Black voters supported Obama in polls starting in summer of ‚Äò08. Obama was Biden with sticky Black voter support the whole time, not Harris.  She realized that, and that‚Äôs why she dropped out early.

So, Emanuel argues that Reagan pulled Democratic voters over because of cultural issues (in which he includes concern about crime, values). He feels the values argument can pull Biden-supporting Republicans back into the Democratic Party.
This entire thing started because of the top comment.  The one that argued that Joe Biden's and Donald Trump's platforms are 100% the same and there is no difference.  That argument is beyond stupid.

People will vote for Biden for strategic, tactical, or emotional reasons. The moderate conservatives will do it to reboot their party. Some ‚ÄúRepublicans‚Äù will vote for Biden because they feel bad about Trump and feel better about Grandpa Joe. /4
And the whole idea of ‚ÄúReagan Democrats‚Äù or ‚ÄúBiden Republicans‚Äù and either side keeping them ignores the fact that these people are swing voters who vote on style and feeling more than substance. (Thus, Clinton over Bush and Dole, W over Gore, Obama over McCain/Romney). /3
Like Biden did back in the 80s about his degrees and his class placement or about the 1994 crime bill?
So in other words, the headline should be ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs claim later irrefutably substantiated by the President.‚Äù

Biden is absolutely not a segregationist and has never been one.  Kamala has voted with bernie more than 90% of the time and are the three that proposed expanding ui to $2000 a month.  Is your argument that progressives should never attempt to gain control of the DA?
Honest question: Does this vote-suppression by Trump rise to the level of a prosecutable offense that can be pursued by Biden AG after the 1/20/2021 turnover? What sort of sentence would conviction bring?

"Harris was really as centrist as centrist gets. In many ways, she was the heir to the type of politics that Joe Biden had spent his career advocating for in the Democratic Party."

He'll bomb more countries like Obama, but he'll do it "humanely." Trump has dropped a lot more bombs and killed a lot more civilians in the countries where Obama started wars. So it is reasonable to believe Biden will be more interventionist but with tighter ROE. Still a net bad.

Obama and idiot Biden did nothing but help Iran enabling Iran to cause havoc and mayhem to other people. How could they have sided with Iran who claimed death to the Americans. A vote for Biden will throw this country in a world that we have fought against.
Biden once again lied. He has a bad habit of that thinking that Republicans will not check him on this unlike the Democratic people who blindly follow a man who continues to lie involving what Trump has accomplished.
This is the biggest thing yet very little was covered. This is historic. It will change the world for next generation. Biden claimed of having a hand in this but was accused that all Biden and Obama did was empower Iran and caused bad effects from doing this.

Trump needs OH+FL+ one of PA/MI/WI. Harris, been one of the loudest voices against fracking, might give Trump PA.   Biden's cognitive decline could lead to a massive KO in the debates. It's far from over - Trump needs a 4-5-point swing to tip over a bunch of states.
Biden told us who is and is not Black based on our vote, that we are a monolith and Clinton told us which Black leaders are acceptable.  They are now openly telling our community that they have no intention of addressing our specific needs.  The consequences are 90% of our vote
I am fine with Joe doing that, getting control of the entire government for two years and then letting actual governmental debate between the AOC/Sanders wing, the Biden wing and the Warrens in the middle.
Joe Biden‚Äôs entire strategy is ‚ÄúI will not actively try to nuke the country,‚Äù   This is literally all he has to sell to win.

That was an annoying thing to say, wasn't it? Smacks of privilege, but probably more just a basic lack of any sense of civic responsibility. And anyone who suggests that there is nothing to choose between Trump and Biden is suspect in my book.

If your best argument for why people should vote for Biden is some contrived analogy about being on a plane that only offers as the inflight meal shit or something slightly less disgusting and harmful than shit, I feel like you have already lost the plot
Biden is defo not running as an incumbent who turns 82 in Nov. 2024. At least, I have to think that‚Äôs the case.

You should turn out because you have a better chance at seeing policies you support enacted with Biden then you do trump.  And if you care about the environment, immigration, women's rights, LGBTQ rights, etc....one would vote Biden.

Because I believe Trump needs to go. Biden-Harris has my vote. And for the record people are excited about her color but more about what comes with the fight.
He most certainly inserted himself in the process to help create a tipping point in Biden‚Äôs favor against Bernie. This is well documented.
Joe Biden needs to get in that fancy car, drive down to DC, and hold a press conference demanding congress get back to work on the the post office, the eviction crisis, and the end of COVID relief.
Honest question, Phil.  If you all don't vote for Joe Biden, who are you voting for?
How are you feeling about the Biden-Harris ticket?
Are you drunk? Biden can't finish a full sentense... he wants to cut ss, he wrote the crime bill.. he is a racist... kamala is a dirty prosecutor... they are both against m4a in the middle of a pandemic... how in the world is that a good ticket?
I find it‚Äôs often most clarifying to go to the candidate‚Äôs own site and read the policy information. Biden‚Äôs climate policy is pretty detailed and kicks off with a $2 trillion investment for making the energy industry and auto industries carbon neutral using union labor.
It‚Äôs a counterfactual. Lieberman, who Gore almost put a heartbeat away from the presidency, might‚Äôve done the same or worse given his hawkishness in the Mid-East. Debating about what Gore might‚Äôve done is less important than talking about what Lierberman/Biden/Schumer/Pelosi did.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think he really cares about what a 30-something Pod Save America host thinks about him, and that honestly might be why he‚Äôs the nominee.‚Äù
How much did it cost to buy Biden‚Äôs VP Spot? About $3.5 million. The virtual fundraisers were the real beauty contest for the money hungry Bidens. And Kamala Harris won them in a swimsuit of money long before the official announcement was even made.

'He's not well': Republican insiders say Biden-Harris ticket will lead to president's self-destruction  #SmartNews
I do not think they would prosecute Obama and Biden but I think it will show that they were cheating all along when they accused Trump of cheating.
If that were the case, ALL Democrat leaders would not be elected. I have never seen such a devious, corrupt, cheating people in my life. The Russia probe, Ukraine, impeachment was a joke &amp; the people saw it. Obama &amp; Biden knew they were going 2 spy &amp; did nothing. You people R low
They‚Äôll be back to comfortable again &amp; disengaged.  I had 3 rules. No rigged primary, no Biden/Bloomberg, no cops.  Also, I‚Äôm in a +30D supermaj. state &amp;  lemme tell you we absolutely need a leftist third party, because the dirty money always finds its way to corrupt politicians.
My greatest hope for this country is that Biden will win in November and add Elizabeth Warren and Katie Porter to his cabinet. It will take strong female leaders to save this country and those 2 ladies are powerhouse fighters!!!
I was saying most of Biden‚Äôs base is middle-aged suburban white people who watch more Tonight Show than twitter feeds.  That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt believe they‚Äôd stay active. For many of them, their only discomfort re: our body politic is Trump (&amp; Mitch to a lesser extent).
I think Biden‚Äôs base ‚â† the base you‚Äôre speaking of.  And the parties are shifting again.
They literally don‚Äôt care that he won‚Äôt do shit to help them.  They just want Trump gone and to be able to go to brunch without thinking about Orange Man. Many of the ones who will vote for Biden are already comfortable.
I disagree that Trump is the cause of all our problems. I don‚Äôt want them to think that either, else if Biden wins, theyre gone. Unreachable, out to brunch.  Ousting Trump destroys the numbers you built to potentially not have another primary til 2032.  Learn from 2008 this time.
I mean, I think he‚Äôs running the political version of The Producers &amp; trying to tank this thing fwiw.  It‚Äôs very telling of the American people‚Äôs confidence in Biden &amp; Dems then that it‚Äôs now a toss-up in some of the newer polls in swing states.
Call it what it is. Diet Fascism.  Our fascist duopoly is almost old enough to drink, if it was ‚Äúborn‚Äù when fascism went mask-off in America (post-9/11)  Biden is going to enable some of the OTHER worst elements in our society. It‚Äôs not going to change, &amp; it‚Äôll likely get worse.
There‚Äôs no way Trump can EO healthcare rights as that‚Äôd face constitutional challenges.  Stop acting like Reaganomics hasn‚Äôt been in everyone‚Äôs playbook since the 70s, Biden especially so as he was historically one of the shittiest of the right wing Dems in the Senate.
Fascism = right wing form of government that seeks to merge corporate &amp; state interests  Biden might not call what he‚Äôs selling fascism. But that‚Äôs absolutely been his track record.  We got the movement in spite of our political figures.
How‚Äôd that work gaining power under the last neoliberal admin we had?  Oh yeah, we lost 1,000+ seats &amp; got Trump at the end of it all.  And Biden is a fascist too. We can argue on degree &amp; scale, but body of work speaks for itself.
Joe Biden's 94 Crime Bill was about showing that the Democrats could be as tough on crime as the Republicans. basically, "we can out-Republican y'all. we'll crack these niggas heads open better than you!"

Anyone saying they want ‚Äúto hold Biden to account‚Äù without making deals for votes with leftists in safe states to vote third party tactically is just trying to get someone to shut up.  How else do the Rs drag the Ds rightward every cycle? Having an ideologically congruent party.
In this alternate reality where someone thinks Biden us tweetie bird or Elmer Fudd
They both will.  The only way I‚Äôll be comfortable with Biden winning is if I know there‚Äôs going to be a leftist party that gets major status to be able to actually hold them to account.  I‚Äôve been in plenty of those rooms. They don‚Äôt listen to us unless their job‚Äôs on the line.
Notice how the Democrats don't bring up Obama and Biden and the h1N1 virus üòÇ
Ease the suffering.  That‚Äôs why I lean towards the harm reduction angle actually being to build leftist power no matter what this cycle &amp; hope you get lame duck Trump instead of Biden, where you know you won‚Äôt have a real primary if he wins until 2032 at the least (if they win).
i say all of this for a couple of reasons. one, i want to kick out any leg that Joe Biden tries to stand on. he can't stand on his abysmal record with the Black community, so he'll try to come around and say, "c'mon y'all know me! Obama's boy?!?!?"
TYSVM handsome! I‚Äôm always honored and grateful to be included! Close to 20k! Wish me luck!
Joe Biden would NEVER tell a Jewish man "if you're not voting for me over Trump, you ain't Jewish". Democrats reserve this kind of flippant arrogance for Black people alone (i have issues with capitalizing text on my phone so forgive me for not capitalizing the "B" in Black)
I talk to older organizers who say ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love Trump gone but I also don‚Äôt want to go back to having 2 people at our meetings who aren‚Äôt staff‚Äù.  You know I‚Äôm in MD if you flip through. This state will go 2:1 to Biden- but we still need 10m saying ‚Äúnot good enough‚Äù w/ votes.
SocialistMMA came out like a dick too, no doubt. But vaush's first point was to slowly say "if you're not voting for Biden, you're a fucking idiot." Which really makes one receptive to the follow ups...  I agree with Vaush's points, I dont have to agree with the execution.
Biden winning without guaranteeing 5%+ for an actual left party to actually hold them to account at the ballot box is a fool‚Äôs errand for the left.  I don‚Äôt trust them. I‚Äôve seen too much Dem corruption from the inside. It‚Äôs why so many of us are stepping up.
If you‚Äôre saying that telling you that I‚Äôm not voting for fascists means somehow I‚Äôm running counter to my values, news flash; that includes Biden because fascism (a right wing corporate/state merger of interests) literally is his policy AND HAS BEEN HIS ENTIRE CAREER.
I don‚Äôt think the latter is possible if you  vote for Biden tbh - 5% is more important than ever.  If the Dems win in Nov &amp; it‚Äôs not by a hair with a third party getting 5%+, they‚Äôll claim their ideas have a mandate.  In which case, no Dem primaries til 2032 in favor of Prez KH.

Guess if you actually wanted the left‚Äôs vote, you shouldn‚Äôt have broken my rule #1:  DON‚ÄôT RIG THE FUCKING PRIMARIES.  Everything else here is drivel. Ask Biden about how he‚Äôs enabled Trump‚Äôs agenda over a 40 year career and get back to me.

Biden/Harris One is senile, the other is a lunatic
To be fair, that wasnt his argument. Democratic voters seeing all the same issues (inequality, the drug war/PIC,  the MIC) persist under Biden would potentially move THEM towards socialism.   I think more people will move left regardless, due to **gestures vaguely at everything**

This country is going to poo. I don‚Äôt even want to say that bastards name in the White House. But he is an absolute disgrace. Sincerely a Republican voting for Biden/Harris.

Many are discouraged and feel voting is a waste of time. They think it‚Äôs fixed due to gerrymandering. Biden/Harris must emphasize the importance of voting and the fact that their votes really do matter.
Are people overlooking joe biden and kamala Harris‚Äôs imperfections and voting for them bc there is a black person on the ticket? I want to know.
In a nutshell, Dems in blue states are not happy about the Biden/Harris and are fed up with the looting, rioting, and lawlessness.

Ukraine is Biden's burden to prove innocence. I don't recall the detail that Trump did not violate anything.  He has lost millions of dollars in business ever since. Obama &amp; Clinton made millions of dollars since.
That adds to the election suspense. People will be jumping at the bit to tell their side of the story once Biden is elected.
I'm too stupid to look anything up so I'm gonna continue to shout into the void that is the morons I interact with that Biden is the worst thing ever.
I can't say what I want under Dem's cancel culture. I don't think Trump is collaborating with Putin at all. I firmly believe Biden will give our national interest to Xi. He can kneel to the mobs, he will also bow to Xi.
Biden chose a running mate only to fit the radical left political correct narrative. He picked Kamala for her RACE and GENDER, not for her character or resume. She has none. Identity politics is the CORE of Dem. Without it, Dem can't breathe. It's a divisive &amp; dangerous ideology.
why is the biden campaign not engaging with america's top hatters to come up with a truly inspirational hat? why have we completely ceded the hat game to trump?
Biden nor harris seem to want to take any questions from the press.         My first question to each of them would be, Joe how would you bring our jobs back from China. And harris are you sleeping with joe to be his running mate???
Biden repeatedly told leftists not to vote for him while the Democratic Party was mobilizing to destroy Sanders and write a platform that rejects the left agenda. Why don't you go lecture the Democratic Party and the Biden campaign about that instead of scolding leftists?

Since NEITHER of these bastards supports my agenda, why would I vote for them?  And since the very things Trump does were allowed to happen by Biden and his ilk, I‚Äôm very comfortable voting for 5% and an actual left party that supports my interests this time around.
To be honest. A vote for Biden will only embolden the crony establishment. You are better off voting for someone the establishment hates. If Trump wins, we could see a collapse of establishment. GOP is already transforming, Dems need to do the same. Pelosi will be gone.
Quick aside: John McCain is my favorite elected official of my lifetime. I revere him like I revere my grandfather. I still grieve their passings.  McCain knew that President Obama loved this country. He knew it of Obama‚Äôs VP, Joe Biden, firsthand through genuine friendship.
Wait, are you fuckers saying Biden is going to die?  What the hell
You support Trump and think Biden is the mentally incompetent one? Trump thinks the 1918 flu pandemic happened in 1917 and ended WW2. He can't ride a fucking bike or walk down a ramp. He's mentally and physically unsuitable to be president,  which is one reason he's so bad at it.
So at this point, it's the principle for me. I still want/need more info, but just know... even though I'm no KH stan, I do stand for black women. And my vote for her and Biden on Nov 3 is a direct smack back at everyone who doesn't.

If there‚Äôs a big R v D imbalance as polls indicate, and &gt;1% of mail ballots are rejected in normal years (disproportionately among D leaning groups), and delays in mail and aggressive challenges stop another 5-10%, that‚Äôs the ballgame in states under 5% margin for Biden at least.
So, regardless of your thoughts on Kamala Harris, have you stopped to think that maybe Biden KNEW he was going to have to make a chess move and that she is, indeed, the perfect candidate for the time? Lemme explain...

Putin must face consequences for targeting US troops. Donald and his republican accomplices have done nothing to protect them. American troops must be returned to the home of our US ally, Germany, and end Donald Trump‚Äôs asinine actions of a move to Poland, Vote Biden/Harris.
Tbc I'm referring to lefties that say they're pro-gun but still cheer for socdems like Bernie &amp; AOC who are vehemently anti-gun  I did give Hawkins a look but he is as bad as Biden  Also doesn't help every center-left to leftist gov't here or overseas has been super anti-gun
You are so right!! Got my Biden cap the other day and will proudly wear it in front of the egg heads!!
If the choice is so obvious and distinct why then can‚Äôt Joe Biden support ‚Äúextreme‚Äù policies like Medicare for all. Would that be the last straw that would make someone decide ‚Äúokay I‚Äôd rather eat glass‚Äù?  If so, the problem is much bigger than Trump.
The US postal service is not the only path to a Biden/Harris victory.
It's not either Trump's authoritarianism or socialism. Biden isn't pushing for public ownership of the means of production, or anything like it, and that's the definition of socialism.
Biden: Now what am i going to have for a snack later.  wait.. .where the fuck am i... oh dang, i scuffed my shoes
Oh, you mean The Veterans' Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act of 2014? &amp; the bipartisan FUTURE Act? Biden was in the room when they took down Bin Laden.

Is it or is it not the Trump Administration "leading" this country right now? She's trying to scare people, saying this is going to happen sometime in the future under the Biden Administration but it's happening now. So the people she's trying to scare, should be scared of Trump.
This is a ridiculous conspiracy theory. Oregon is going to Biden, mail or no mail. Mail volume is cratering because companies are reeling in ad budgets (direct mail ads are the biggest segment of mail) &amp; more people are paying bills online.

If that happens, let hope Ukraine will still nail Biden
Devil's advocate: is there an argument that in Trump's 2nd term with a Dem Congress and Senate, he would work with them? There was a brief thawing on infrastructure where he ignored the GOP. A Biden/Harris 1st term will not be bipartisan if Dems run the table.

1/ I am going to vote for Biden/Harris. You should too. They do not have all of my policy wishes, and after they are elected I will continue to push them to be more progressive. Some will say they will sit this out because they aren‚Äôt excited about Biden/Harris #Election2020
Vote Biden. This is not about loving Biden it‚Äôs about getting Trump out of office. Any vote other then Biden is for Trump. Biden has compassion and his VP will not be in the background. Trump is a danger to our future and present so it seems.
I think today I will post dumb shit on the internet  [Sits at kitchen table, opens laptop, logs on to Twitter, takes a long sip of coffee while staring out at the clear morning sky]  Ah, what a wonderful day to be a Biden supporter
Who wouldn't since Biden can't even string a sentence together and looks like he has early stages of Dementia
I spoke with  During her campaign, Kamala Harris called to ban #Fracking. We're hopeful her addition to the ticket will make a Biden Admin stronger than would otherwise be. And we'll work hard to make sure it happens.
Sanders favorability is high among Dems. Polls suggest voters thought Biden had a better shot at beating Trump. Again, that's what the Dem est. presented on the Monday before Super Tuesday. Twitter isnt RL. Only 7% use it, and a fraction of that is on political twitter.
She was picked because she's qualified! Biden promise to choose a woman because for too long highly qualified women have not had the opportunities afforded to men in our patriarchal society especially privileged white men.
If there‚Äôs as much of an imbalance between D and R voting by mail as polls have indicated, I don‚Äôt think people fully grasp how little of the mail in vote needs to be delayed into rejection to swing a close Biden state to a close Trump state.
We don‚Äôt know their plan....Harris and Biden not answering questions from reporters so far. They pop out and say ‚ÄúTrump is bad‚Äù and run back to their hiding places. If anybody is going to talk, for any length of time, it‚Äôs only gonna be Harris, Biden couldn‚Äôt hold it together.
It's about time. And hopefully more to come. We deserve better than the Obama/Biden cabal's effort to weaponize the State against political opponents.

Exactly- and just wait till after the election-  If we win- trump will go on a demolition rampage through government agencies  And if we lose? Or if he -WHEN he contests Biden win? I‚Äôm truly terrified
Id argue that refusing to peacefully transition power is probably one of major sticking points of a government falling into fascism and since biden didnt do that in 2016   I cant call him a facist.
By then I think they will have basically conceded the election and be working to sabotage the early days of the Biden admin. If they do happen to win, then it wont matter anyway.
And don't forget how racist Biden is too! They're really a pair, aren't they?
Im honestly confused with this argument.  One of the arguments made for bernie is that he would appeal to those disillusioned republican voters and that would carry him to victory and now when Biden is doing it somehow becomes a flaw?
You seemed to have skimmed over my specifications. Establishment dems are going further right- Biden is proof ie voting/bill history and how recently his stances ‚Äúchanged‚Äù (hard to believe bc it‚Äôs always an empty promise with others) voter dems are going further left

How hasn't Biden made outreach to the progressives?
it‚Äôll be interesting if biden/harris get elected because I feel like both progressives and conservatives will be attacking them, but for completely utterly different reasons.
questions like this make me think about how administrations shift rightward once elected and no one has held kamala or biden accountable up to this point  how has pushing ‚Äúprogressives‚Äù like mosby left worked so far?  but what do i know i don‚Äôt have any letters after my name

Now, who's the corrupt ones? Then you have Biden that has been blatantly racist and involved in obvious corruption with Ukraine, and Harris who has incarcerated more people for minor drug crimes than any prosecutor in the country. And laughed about if she ever smoked weed herself
Yo, where my ‚ÄúDems are just as bad / Hillary and Biden are warmongers‚Äù lefties at?
You do know what "accused" means, right? WTF are you talking about "programmed" to have common sense? And not use the ramblings of some hysterical internet troll as my "evidence"? You address Biden by talking about Trump. That's how desperate you are to make a point.
Latest says 4000 more just before the election (political pawns, great way to use troops) the remainder maybe in April. (possibly moved up to February if Trump loses (to deny biden the credit)
I saw it in real time so unfortunately no evidence. It was around this post with a selfie with Biden saying something like ‚Äúlove Biden!‚Äù And ended it with ‚ÄúAnd of course Bernie Sanders is nowhere to be seen!‚Äù But literally Bernie was campaigning in low income neighborhoods then
Queer Eye isn‚Äôt the same once I found out Karamo was a die hard Biden supporter for the last year and continuously bashed Bernie for not showing up to fundraising rallies
Bernie was turned against because of his followers when Biden/Harris supporters have been way worse. That was the ONLY reason everyone was so against him. You should maybe talk to Karamo about this too. He‚Äôs been bashing Bernie and praising Biden since before Super Tuesday
finish the job???  He hasn't started yet.... Biden 2020

Wow! The diversity pic trumped policy again. So much for policy or integrity. Biden wrote the Clinton Crime Bill that locked up milluons if non-violent drug offeners most of them Black men. Like my late crack addicted father.

Just watched  speaking, and saying that Joe Biden ‚Äúignored the doctors and scientists, and instead, made decisions based on politics.‚Äù I literally had to check my pulse to be certain I hadn‚Äôt entered some alternate universe!
So in a state where Trump was heading to 60-40 defeat, and 78% of his 40% votes in person and 28% of Biden‚Äôs 60%, Election Day results look like 65% Trump. Still 52% of the vote outstanding. But that 52% is 83% D. If These measures stop 1/4 of mail ballots, Dems don‚Äôt crack 50%.
Am I the only one who remembers how sure everyone was that Trump couldn‚Äôt possibly win in 2016?  Anyway, Dems in office don‚Äôt actually care. If Biden wins, great. If Biden loses, they get 4 more years of fantastic fundraising while pretending to maintain ‚ÄúThe Resistance.‚Äù

Just to be clear, Biden/Harris are so far stuck up inside Wall Street's rectum that I have very little hope that they will reduce fossil fuels to the extent we actually need to save our planet, but they believe in science, they just refuse to listen to it.

5 Takeaways From Kamala Harris‚Äôs First Full Day on the Biden Ticket - The New York Times
Hunter Biden
Seems like any rapper knowingly ratfucking the Biden/Harris ticket would really damage his brand. I guess stupid yeezus had 53 million reasons
Joe biden's a pedophile. If you're a fan you're a pedophile too.
Trump Encourages Racist Conspiracy Theory on Kamala Harris‚Äôs Eligibility to Be Vice President - The New York Times
It's that stupid argument that if you vote for Biden and replace him with trump the person after will be somehow worse than trump?
Hey what about not worry about what biden is doing and worry about the citizens of America cuz it looks like you're more worried about tiktok and playstore apps than your citizens you are ruining the future of this country we couldve been done with covid by now if u acted more
I wish that we didn't blind ourselves w/ the memories of the Obama era lead us to pushing #Biden to becoming the Democratic Nominee for President. I wish that we had a country who felt more confident for any woman, LGBTQIA+, #POC or black person to be our firm choice for the DNC.
Well, he was under oath, and it‚Äôs almost a statistical certainty that he lies less than his former boss?  Also I just like to point out that the dystopian future that is alluded to under a Biden administration by Trump is the one we‚Äôre living in right now while Trump is in power
Silly me! I thought you meant cigarette butts, having a smoke out for Biden.
If her campaign suggests how Biden‚Äôs campaign will be, then oh boy...is the DNC in trouble.
I also get my meds from the VA. if you're too incompetent to order your meds in advance. That's on you.  don't try to blame it on the post office or any so-called postal slow dow. I am sure you will be voting for Biden often and early.
I‚Äôm worried about the in-between time if Biden wins. 45 will be on a tear and his supporters will be off the hook. The safety of Biden and Harris will be critical.
Kamala Harris' Corruption EXPOSED  via  Kamala is a corrupt person who slept her way to the top, so she‚Äôs a perfect compliment to Joe Biden. Great choice leftists. I wonder how leftists in the church will defend her as VP
Harris bringing energy, dollars and more to Biden's campaign
He's doing a good job. I'd prefer to discuss his record and time in office along with Biden rather than use a deadly worldwide pandemic to score some political points.
You better know that China, Russia, Iran, North Korea and every other hostile regime are rooting for a Biden victory..  They know they will walk right over Biden.
Biden: I wanna smell you.                                       Harris: I want to be President
Hey Don great show tonight  üëç you don‚Äôt get a novel peace prize for poor leadership and not understanding the COVID-19 pandemic. Please come out and Vote Biden &amp; Harris in November.
Apparently Biden didn't see the April 23rd Coronavirus press conference. A lot of people didn't. I did.
why are the sexual assaults by joe biden dismissed by his supporters but sexual assaults by trump are not?
Harris is a political black move.  She is corrupt and dumb as a rock!   Virginia mayor urged to resign after making Aunt Jemima comment about Biden picking Harris
Butt-Head, you should this one out.  Both Joe Biden and her will bring back integrity to the White House.  Are you and your Dad going to denounce birther conspiracies about her that are floating around from the most extreme voices in right-wing circles?
Joe Biden is too much of a gentleman to say what needs to be said. I‚Äôm going to say it for him. acting president bunker don get off of social media or the internet or national news. You‚Äôre sister was right. You are a disgrace for you‚Äôre whole country
Maybe the debate between Biden and Trump could be more visual. Biden drinks water/ Trump drinks water/ Biden walks a ramp Trump same. Biden says Yosemite... Trump says well you get the picture.
Biden and Harris have theirs
Excellent ad. I'm sold! Whoever did this should work with Biden/Harris.
this is the clearest and best possible case for voting Trump.  If Biden wins there's no hope. There's not even the possibility of hope.
Herman Cain‚Äôs Twitter Account Attacks Joe Biden and Kamala Harris From Beyond the Grave
Trump's all like "Biden can't remember stuff!" like it's a negative this year, bro pass me a slice of that dementia so I can mind wipe the 2020 outta my brain
Soon to be appearing in a Trump anti-Biden attack promo...
Maybe they could be intercepted, marked for Biden/Harris and submitted for counting.
The this is our only option to remove Trump vs Biden is racist vs criminal justice hell Kamala is the super generic version of it all.
I would love to see Senator  in a cabinet position if Biden/Harris come to power. She should‚Äôve been the presidential nominee, but not all wishes come true. Lets empower her with a platform to implement #BigStructuralChanges
Pence: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not gonna let Joe Biden and Kamala Harris cut America‚Äôs meat.‚Äù Trump, Pence, McConnell are refusing to give Americans financial help so that they‚Äôre able to buy, much less, cut meat. There‚Äôs no Christianity there.
Oh I think he made perfectly clear what was ‚Äúin his heart.‚Äù He needs to go - along with the rest of old racist men who are desperately clinging to power. Time‚Äôs up. You‚Äôre disgusting and we‚Äôve had enough.
You talking about biden now...
We shall see. I actually support Trump policies in regards to the party platform. I don‚Äôt necessarily like the guy but the moves he has made in areas like Tax Cuts, 2nd Amendment, Israel, deregulation, and Supreme Court judges. I‚Äôm a fan. Biden not so much
Biden currently leads Trump by 25% in New York
I've gotten that twice in two days. Today it was for tweeting "do y0u pe0ple ever stop lying" in respose to  BS tweet.  I'm tempted to tweet some nasty attacks on "Trump," just to see what happens. And then try again, this time with "Biden."
Saw a girl tweet today she‚Äôd rather have Trump over Biden because she‚Äôs ‚Äúalready dealt with it once‚Äù and it ‚Äúbarely affected her the first time‚Äù. This mindset is quite literally ùô†ùôûùô°ùô°ùôûùô£ùôú ùô•ùôöùô§ùô•ùô°ùôö. Wake up #VoteBlue2020
just wrote a long ass crisis actor comment about not voting for Biden on fb on a post where someone i know was getting attacked for saying that *some* critique is important and i feel like that rant has let off some pressure so that‚Äôs nice lol
Number  Biden is not our President. It was not his job to protect us nor did he have any authority in the present administration.He wore a mask spoke out on what he could. With the power to unite the people Trump chooses to let the virus mow us downNo help,no empathy,just death.
Biden chose a running mate only to fit the radical left political correct narrative. He picked Kamala for her RACE and GENDER, not for her character or resume. She has none. Identity politics is the CORE of Dem. Without it, Dem can't breathe. It's a divisive &amp; dangerous ideology.
I‚Äôm tired of everything political I‚Äôm tired of Democrats I‚Äôm tired of Republicans I‚Äôm tired of Trump I‚Äôm tired of Biden I‚Äôm tired of Fox News and I‚Äôm really tired of CNN
does Joe Biden think aliens exist, real question
Ok Let's start with today's Middle East Peace Accords. Please don't give me that Biden BS of him and Obama laying the groundwork. I did not like Obama at all but would have given him credit for today's historical accords much like I gave him credit for taking the shot at Osama
The ways i couldn‚Äôt give less of a fuck if a leftist votes for biden or not because both perspectives are legitimate and i think it‚Äôs stupid and redundant to argue about üëÅ
If there is extra violence after Biden is elected it will be because Trump and Pence has egged their supporters on.
So this is a depressing thought: Looking back at 2016 on August 13 of that year,  election prediction of ‚ÄúWho will win the presidency?‚Äù had Hillary Clinton‚Äôs chance of winning at 87.8%‚Ä¶      Today, Biden is only at 72%‚Ä¶
I would be willing to bet that "most" female politicians don't bow down, just that most of the ones we see (ie. those who are elected) do because they are rewarded for it, and punished for not.   This piece really put that dichotomy in stark terms for me:
I'm definitely watching my boy Bernie and my girl AOC...pass on the rest...mayne Joe biden and see if he gafs or not
Joe Biden Dumb Ass Really Threw the Election away üòÇ

They won't hurt him. People understand MSM better now. And yes I want Trump to beat Biden.
My specific question was about the urgency though.. Because it was being framed that Biden wont do meaningful police or healthcare reform, which is of critical importance to millions.. This true, but neither will Trump, and voting green wont get those policies in either.

How Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris: A search that forged new stars, friends and rivalries

Hahahaha, okay. You've joined Gege abi. All I know is o don't like Biden
Huge WW admirer here but I sure wish you‚Äôd hold your fire on Biden until 11/4.  Hard to see a positive risk/benefit ratio for criticizing him now.
Lol back it up with a news source... I can when I say kamala is a dirty prosecutors and sell out like biden.
Do they think Biden will not seek a 2nd term, or that he will not  have/complete a 1st term?
only leftist white people say shit like "biden losing will be funny" or "it doesn't matter who wins" and think it'll all be the same  why? bc they don't have to worry about shit like whether or not their dad will get his green card pulled or not renewed.
We will react with our Vote in November Biden Harris all the way üëçüëçüëç
Precisely!  Just look at what former VP Biden has accomplished in his nearly 50 years in Congress.  He did so much, now he has to get to the White House to fix all of it.
I get the urgency, but isnt voting green also a long term play? Neither Biden nor Trump will pass M4A, so I dont really get that.  I'm not about vote shaming, Biden and Harris are corporatist shills. I just think they are more likely to bend to Justice Dems than Trump.
He is.   will never get over Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama.  He fears strong women (Hillary, Kamala, Nancy) and he‚Äôs a bigot (Obama, Harris, M. Waters).  He‚Äôs so afraid of Biden that he tried to bring in another country and is undermining our postal service.
It hurts that my parents actually like biden
Biden/Harris have already won the election on who can run the U.S.  They better start dealing with the cheating the GOP has set up and deal with it RIGHT NOW!!!
omfg looking at all the responses to this tweet and this is what I see:  1. Let's have 50 speakers 2. Let each person have at least 15 minutes 3. Dump everyone over 50 4. Make Biden commit to #M4AllNow or I'm not voting 5. Make Biden commit to #GreenNewDealNow or I'm not voting
Franklin Graham warns Biden-Harris ticket ‚Äòshould be a great concern to all Christians‚Äô Biden-Harris "are labeled as the most pro-abortion presidential ticket in the history of our nation."

The president has already passed a major test of intelect, --amazing the doctors!  He no longer has any need for intelligence related briefings.  Biden should get tested too!  No way he "aces it" like Trump did...Biden hafta go to summer school...

Election in a nut shell: A vote for Biden/Harris will just empower the crony establishment. A vote for Trump will destroy the establishment. This is last breathe of desperation. Even if you don't like Trump, might as well let the bull reign more!
Anthony Fauci is going to start speaking his mind more often. Trump can fire him; he will have a few months to rest before he goes to work for Biden-Harris
I am passionate about reporting and tired of the laziness I see in the trade. I‚Äôd be the same if it was Barack Obama, Joe Biden or anyone else up there fielding that type of remark.
Interesting. You rarely see HRW, ONU, even Bergoglio raising their voices against the atrocities committed by this narco Communist Regime. Why now? Too little too late. Now we have Biden promising the dictator Raul Castro all kinds of things. Bad news for the US.
Biden calls for nationwide mask mandate
First, the Biden/Harris platform offers me nothing and they can‚Äôt be bothered to seek my vote, so why should I bother? Second, if the corrupt corporate neolibs could offer JUST ONE progressive policy, I‚Äôd be Ok with them.
Biden himself promised to pick a female candidate for VP no matter what. So yes his decision was gender based. Kamala just alllowed Sleepy Joe to check another box
I hope Biden and Harris lose
That‚Äôs how Trump got in there in the first place oh wise one. People were voting against DC. Against the career politician. Not for Trump. All I‚Äôm saying is we need be better than Biden or Trump. Just my opinion. No need to get shitty about it. Not exactly mature.
#Biden #Harris. Let‚Äôs fucking do this!
same here...it's pretty incredible how many previous DEM supporters I know who have either left the DEM party or are just voting RED because they are sick of the liars.  Biden won't be around much longer, certainly not 4 years from now and people despise them both.
We knew Trump would do this. It was only a matter of time, and in this case it was the day after announcing that Kamala was Biden‚Äôs choice for VP. You know he was DYING to cast that disgusting doubt on her fitness for office-he he only totally unfit POTUS ever.
Kamala is 10x more competent than Biden and Trump combined.  I don‚Äôt understand all the animosity towards her as a former prosecutor when the opposition is a whiny man child
AFTER Biden wins the election.

First I want to thank you for scrolling through my tweets it shows you have some intelligence, and second it was the reason why Democrat‚Äôs picked her, because they wanted a black woman to be Biden‚Äôs running mate and that‚Äôs the only reason why she was picked.They think she‚Äôs black

And yet Biden clinched the nomination because of the support of Southern Black voters.   He's not without fault.  Not by a longshot.  But he's nowhere near as bad for the country as Trump.
Not just Pelosi.  &amp;  called Boomers "selfish" for voting for Biden.  Also suggested that the black people in SC who helped turn the tide for Biden were "centrists" who were too stupid to know what's good for them.
I absolutely can point to things to defend Biden on but both you and Johnny immediately dismiss them as "him lying about it".  But you do you.
Hopefully, you‚Äôre talking about Trump. I don‚Äôt have to agree with everything Biden stands for to vote for him. But Trump stands for everything I am against. That makes it simple and easy to decide.
Is she drunk? Zoe does she have JBS (Joe Biden Syndrome) ? Who voted for this loon? Time to eat some gormet ice cream!

#random They got close yesterday, but eventually either Biden or Kamala GOTTA say, "he's flailing... he doesn't know what to do, because usually at this point he just files for bankruptcy and walks away from the disaster he caused"
AZ Republicans are so angry with Trump they have formed a group to get Trump out. They are voting for Biden and ethics. They should get candidates who believe in ethics for all.
So you admit that there is a difference on healthcare between Trump and Biden?
Go on one of those neighborhood pages and announce you‚Äôd be taking ballots to wherever for Biden voters and pick out areas that are where you want to go.
Ooooohh. Revenge is a dish best served cold. Great fantasy. But Hillary would have to recuse herself as AG. With her skill set I think Biden will find a good vehicle for her talents.
What sort of bubble do you live in that you honestly believe the words you just typed?  You believe that Biden has advocated for dismantling the ACA?

Joe Biden led our foreign policy decisions for 48 years? Those were his decisions and his decisions alone? Are you high or did your dog tell to write this nonsense?
Fascism is a right wing merger of corporate and state interests by definition.  Biden is STILL a right winger who has an entire career of merging his donor‚Äôs interests with the business of running the country. Just because Trump is a corrupt fascist doesn‚Äôt mean Biden isn‚Äôt.
No lyin‚Äô Biden!
Biden, IF you can't express yourself in YOUR OWN WORDs then you are NOT fit to be POTUS!    Any JackA$$ can quote someone else.  It takes a REAL Statesman to put his thoughts in his OWN words!  That is ALL that is believable. GET IT???  When will we hear actual policy!

Obama/Biden MIddle East plan in shambles until Trump: Plan 1. Defeat ISIS, 2. Move US Embassy to Jerusalem, 3. end Iran deal, 4. 1,2&amp;3 established trust and strong leadership which led to the UAE-Israel deal, 5. Deal has set path for peace in Middle East.

Just in case potential Biden voters didn‚Äôt know consider what Trump hater Thomas Friedman said.  . Ed
This is a sign that the Middle East that wants peace prefers Trump over Biden as our President for the next 4 years. They don‚Äôt want a weak President whose policies in the past allowed the region to become even more unstable. Trump has made Europe safer.
That‚Äôs not where this is heading no, I just wanted to hear your thoughts. You dont think Biden would‚Äôve handled the coronavirus better than Trump has?

Dude, defend your reasoning. I told you exactly why I‚Äôm voting for Biden. Can you formulate an argument or are you just going to provide me with a link that tells someone else‚Äôs opinion?

What Biden/Harris aren‚Äôt saying is if it wasn‚Äôt for Trump‚Äôs quick actions back in Jan when Dems were busy trying to impeach him he stopped flights from China then Europe &amp; shutdown country for ~ 2 months;there could be 1.6M deaths not 0.16M deaths. He likely saved 1.2M Americans!

Biden/ Harris for the win! üôèüèΩ
I don‚Äôt think Biden/Harris will repeat same mistakes Clinton made. Now if your view was Bernie or bust, I see your point. But Bernie is now supporting Biden/ Harris. His wise supporters will too. Anyway, good chatting with you. Have a nice eve.
Black voters definitely afraid of Trump, with good reason. He is a White supremacist!  They were afraid Bernie couldn‚Äôt win, rightly or wrongly, so opted for safer choice. But BLM can push Biden just like Civil rights movement pushed LBJ. So hopefully BLM will continue to grow.
OMG he did NOT just say Biden was ignoring scientific evidence hahaha!! Hes doing same thing as before! What ever they  about him he turns it around and says the SAME thing about them lol God he's such a child!
It‚Äôs clear to me Biden knows he‚Äôs not up to the task. Pres.Trump has shown strength and patiently developed a path for this peace agreement and others may follow.The Middle East wants peace.
The issues will go unaddressed if people just elect Biden and go home!  But it takes more than that. Our history demonstrates it.
LBJ signed the civil rights and voting rights acts. Pushed them through the Congress. Nothing in his past suggested he would.  But the movement led by Dr. King forced him to move this country forward. That is the model we need to follow with Biden.
No serious activist can think the movement for racial justice will be advanced re-electing Trump. He considers BLM a hate group and will use power of government to crush it. Biden/ Harris, like LBJ many years ago, can be moved by the mass movement of the American people.
One final point on Kamala, Biden. What they do really will depend on how much pressure is brought to bear by BLM and others who need to vote, and then hold them accountable, stay in the streets, keep mobilizing.  Their past positions aren‚Äôt nearly as relevant as people think.
The minute Biden wins, TLP and others will roll out their "Democrats let this happen!" and "Why aren't Dems fixing things faster?" pro-Republican campaigns for the midterms and 2024. They will have had lots of practice honing their messages and targeting their audiences.

Not American politics - Republican politics. Don‚Äôt both sides this. And yet, you‚Äôre still not sure you‚Äôll vote for Biden knowing damn well that is the same as voting for Trump. You talk out both sides of your face. Just stop pretending.
Biden couldn‚Äôt have done this,by moving US Embassy to Jerusalem &amp; ending Iran deal Trump established a trusting relationship Obama/Biden could never imagine. Itallowed Israel&amp;UAE to enter this agreement &amp;eventual PalestinianState.Splitting Jerusalem would be like east-westBerlin.
OK forgot the fact that she is not black and is pretending to be black. She and Biden are responsible for putting the most black men and women in prison for the past 50 years and she declined to prosecute Steven Mnunchin. Plus don't forget Mitrice Richardson.
Who in their right minds would put Biden in the presidential seat over someone like Bernie Sanders? It's just strange. His faculties aren't even there.
This for any of you dipshits stupid enough to even consider voting for Kanye.   He and Trump are working together to take votes from Biden. Congrats on your vote for Donald Trump
i'm sure he'll be added to the list and if they ever hire someone to do that sort of thing, they'll look right into it. but right now they are all busy investigating biden's son, and his dog, and his bank teller, and his socks
Many reasons why I will gladly be voting for Biden ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è..getting Trump out of office is one of them and not voting at all won‚Äôt do that.

I saw you on WJ and we must be aware of "trolls" who vent right wing talking points against Biden-Harris. Black women are the backbone of this democracy from 1619-Present.
Bruhhhh the facts are its disturbing that we got a Deadman tweeting 2 we know Biden is the you say the right things and for the love of God don't say anything extra candidate fact is i will go with him over cheese puff face.
I hear she likes to lock up her political enemies. The American people should understand this Presidential election Kamala Harris against President Trump. She will use the 25th Amendment to remove Biden so she becomes President. Ed
Question, would Kamala Harris after Biden is elected President use the 25th amendment to have Biden removed so then she becomes President. The DOJ democrats considered using it against President Trump. Ed
Looks like Biden is working hard to me. Exactly the kind of leader we need. Not the train wreck we have now.

Trump Just Tweeted a Video on Biden's 'Racism Problem' That Is BRUTAL
I agree with you but it‚Äôs bigger than that. not voting for him is a vote for Trump and honestly it‚Äôs bigger than presidency, people like Betsy Devos over education need to be out and that can be done by getting Biden in office
All of a sudden, Puny Pence has a voice...scared?  From the very first day of this Administration, President Trump has set our Nation on a path to freedom and opportunity. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would set America on the path of SOCIALISM and DECLINE.  #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
I rather have Biden/Harris at the helm than Trump. Not dismissing either one of there discretions, im sure they‚Äôll dig up a ton of dirt on Harris in the weeks to come. Trumps needs to go. This country needs to make a turn around fast.

The campaign has begun. I know you wanted an African American VP but the Governor of Michigan might have one you more than one battleground states. Biden, like Obama, takes the safe route so I now feel more confident Trump will win. Ed
My question will Biden make it to Election Day? If not what happens next? Ed
how this Biden/Harris combo got me feelin
it's okay to acknowledge that the biden/harris ticket is better than the opposition. it's also okay to call the biden/harris ticket terrible due to the merits of the two candidates. and it still okay to vote for a less violent cop than the more violent and racist one.

President Trump rips Biden VP pick Kamala Harris
Well I tbink it was more the entire congress and city communities who pushed the bill. Biden‚Äôs name was just at the top. At the time it was a hugely popular idea none of us have really lived through 300 homicides a month being normal.
It‚Äôs the legislators we need to focus on to push a progressive agenda. If the laws we want are there, people like Biden and Harris will enforce those laws. But without those laws, there isn‚Äôt much they can do to push to the left.
Kamala Harris Is Biden‚Äôs Choice for Vice President
And I suppose the most radical BLM protesters in the street were not gonna vote anyway. Biden hoping to peel off moderate GOP soccer moms in Pa., Indiana, NC, Michigan, Wisconsin.
I don‚Äôt see why reporters feel the need to repeat Trumps non sensical talking points.  Biden/Harris vision of a diverse, inclusive America is diametrically opposes to Trump/Pence vision of white supremacy.  That is the main point to be made.
Y'all not going to sit here and act like Biden and Harris are the same as Trump and Pence. Do not allow your "wokeness" to reach new heights.
Really looking forward to people not liking Biden but only attacking Kamala Harris. You guys are the real MVP's.  Misogynistic Vicious  Patriarchy humpers  #BidenHarris2020
I‚Äôm gonna vote for Biden but i wish he just wouldn‚Äôt talk because i feel like everytime he opens his mouth he says something dumb

Watch SE Cupp's reaction to Biden's VP pick
I mean everyone is entitled to have their own opinion or views about the election candidates. But, I strongly think that Condoleezza Rice would have been the perfect candidate as the vice president. I really think Mr. Biden should have chosen Mrs. Rice. No other words. ü§êüò∑
I really don‚Äôt know how someone supporting Donald Trump, who retweets ‚Äúwhite power,‚Äù lied about Obama‚Äôs birth, defends confederate memorials, and is basically the candidate of white supremacy could criticize anything Joe Biden has said on race. You live in a different world.
Bringing the popcorn. Wish she could stand in for Biden during his debate too!
Same!! Am surprised at how I feel. Biden-Harris is a power team!
Perfect pick. The men who were raised by strong Black women are ready to work with you. We are one! Biden-Harris
You were my choice!  However now that VP Biden has made his choice I would love to see you Secretary of Department of State.

At this point I just don't care. If I remember to go to the polls in November, I'll vote for Biden I guess
If Biden wins the Marxists will take over.Neither Biden or Harris are strong, but they like each other. If the Marxists take over first thing is to erase history. So libraries better start now distributing all books,species DNA now electronic around the world hidden from them.

Do Trump supporters really want to talk about Biden‚Äôs cognitive abilities when Trump is an absolute imbecile?
But we already got a man with neurological issues in the white house. At least Biden on a good day is 100% better than Trump.
My wife said, "James, Joe Biden is going to select a Black woman. What if all of the vetting of the candidates is a smoke screen for someone he's already selected for the position:  MICHELLE OBAMA?"  Don't think that's the case, but . . . what if . . .
Exactly. I will not be happy if Biden doesn‚Äôt pick Senator Harris. Pissed in fact. But I‚Äôm voting for Biden because Trump needs to go.
Obama/Biden $80B green energy plan was a complete failure. Obama was a good talker but didn‚Äôt know how to follow through. Trump knows how to get things done. Ed

The Michigan poll seems off. If it's that close, not good news for Biden
Do U know how out of touch this sounds?  Black &amp; brown communities are being decimated by COVID &amp; its effects, e.g.15% unemployment. We're not looking to be excited by VP pick. We're not excited by Biden. We're voting for him anyway. For VP just do no harm
This year, Dems don't care about gaffes or enthusiasm. I'm a 68 yr old live long Dem. I'm not enthusiastic about Biden but Im volunteering for his campaign, I've donated money, and I will crawl over glass to vote for him. Everyone I know feels the same way.
The President is on the offensive, so don‚Äôt be surprised he rolls over Biden in the general election. I talk to people, most aren‚Äôt talking and likely scared. But in ballot will vote for a law and order America, a strong economy and a strong National Defense. Ed
I just volunteered for Biden campaign to make calls. Also signed up with Swing Left to help take bake the senate!! Let‚Äôs do this!!! ‚úä
Depends:  Biden wins: THANK GOD!! Respectability will be restored  Trump wins: Da f*ck??? That sob, mfer? ETC, ETC, ETC.
Okay, so she doesn‚Äôt like him, but unlike the other guys he knows how to get things done, people who stayed in stock market made a lot of money last month, and he‚Äôs one of the few President‚Äôs who knows how to run an economy. Biden gets confused when talking about numbers. Ed
A dozen women, mainly national activists, may not be representative of rank &amp; file blk women Dem voters. I'm a local activist, a black woman, a senior in maj/minority district. I want Biden to pick a black woman but most I know not demanding it.
The same people who think Republicans will come back to the table to cooperate with a Biden administration
U mean u want her to fo the opposite of what u are doin now? She Has, and she is doing nothing different than Biden. Misogynistic anytime
So what did your Obama/Biden administration do about it? Ed
Biden has already kneeled to the mob. Ed
Indeed but it‚Äôs just funny coming from the side that screams voter fraud when unless an election was within 10 votes it wouldn‚Äôt matter. Biden‚Äôs gonna win the pop vote trump prolly the electoral. Everyone just needa shut up.
I hope Biden/Trump get bit by one of these things
Where‚Äôs the intelligence for this? I‚Äôd think they would prefer a weak President like Biden so they could be more aggressive in Ukraine etc. Don‚Äôt forget Trump is the one who provided anti-tank missiles to Ukraine, while Obama/Biden were afraid to do so! Ed
Joe Biden cannot do math. Ed
In other words, "Pick me, pick me Mr. Biden sir, I want to be v.p."
In 3.5 years with all the democrats trying to stop President Trump achieved more than the 8 years of the Obama/Biden Presidency. Furthermore, Trump is the most prolife President we‚Äôve ever had while Obama/Biden were part of the culture of death St John Paul II talked about. Ed
You know, I didn‚Äôt wanna vote for Biden. But it ain‚Äôt gon be trump so  Basically what I‚Äôm saying is..  #Biden2020
I mean, I guess Biden is extra worried about dying in office (or at least people being worried he‚Äôll die in office), but like... that‚Äôs why you build a complete team of advisors!!!
My understanding is she was more or less knocked out because ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt have enough foreign policy experience,‚Äù but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs nearly the gotcha Biden seems to think it is
I genuinely can‚Äôt fathom why Stacey Abrams isn‚Äôt being named as one of Biden‚Äôs VP finalists, especially in a year when Georgia is possibly in play and has TWO competitive Senate elections.
obama and biden did it? has the right wing nutbag press gotten wind of this? next biden secret gay lover of obama. i can hear rush windbag chortling now
They will do literally anything to retain power. As Rachel said, we all better buckle up. I hope Biden and Democratic Party are ready.
