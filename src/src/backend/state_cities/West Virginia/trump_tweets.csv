Well he has adopted the populist economics,so that's progress. My feeling is that if the Populist Trump faction doesn't unite around 1 canidate,an establishment is who you're going to get and, deservedly so.
is the best thing for Conservatives. I recall wachting him on  when I was in high school (back when it was wachtable). He discouraged Trump from going to war w/Iran. He's a good upgrade from  who pushed for the Iraq War during the early Aughts.
I can think of no better a FU than for  to pick up the tab for states to mail ballots to voters that want to stay safe AND to rid ourselves of trump.
Okay, what's false about what he said. You people in the Mainstream Media are the scum of the earth. Trump was being honest and truthful. You Jim Acosta are about as scummy as they come.
Speaking of Thighland, just wait until Trump sees Niger on the teleprompter.    Had to share this with you. Cracked me up.  Compliments of Alex Cole.
go smoke outside that republican house that trump sign says it's ok to smoke outside that house on the sidewalk.
If the justice system works as it should, Trump should be tweeting from behind bars.  BTW, can you tweet from jail?  #TrumpIsALoser
States ask that Trump's district drawing order be stopped
Donald trump cannot even hold a Bible right side up and he is going to bash a practicing catholic and say he will take your religion away.  Mr. Fake President let‚Äôs talk about the donation Jeffrey Epstein made to your campaign.  Pedophilers forever
Those that aren't are intimidated by those that are. The Russian military intelligence agency GRU probably has a file on all of them and pays them regular visits to make sure everything is OK. Why else would the buy all of Trump's outrageous anti-American actions?
Trump is literally just throwing every key word he can think of our there in an attempt to attack Biden.  Trump is so dumb and, yet, his worshippers manage to be even dumber.  Fuck us, #amiright?
Trump stands on national TV and says Biden hates God! What kind of crap is that! Trump is making it really easy to vote and support Biden as a republican!
Trump is potus and I finally have offers from companies. No complaints from the shark tank over here
Is it a surprise that China (people of color) favors Biden and Russia (predominantly White) favors Trump? Their preferences merely align with the racial preferences of Americans.
Talks on a coronavirus relief package collapsed on Friday, and White House officials said they will recommend that President Trump move ahead without Congress to try to address unemployment benefits, eviction rules, and student loan relief.
Trump called Russian interference a hoax Then it was Ukraine, after that was Covid. Soon election interference again by Russia.  We all know the truth. #TrumpHoaxedAmerica #Dems4USA  Donald Trump‚Äôs Cries Of ‚ÄòHoax‚Äô Used Against Him In Stinging New Ad
5 years ago if you asked anyone about the USPS they'd say it sucks and it's terrible. Suddenly now that Trump's against it, it's the most well oiled machine ever.
Trump thinks handing billions to the top 1% is helping us somehow! Lol, or at least that's the scam! Keep saying it over and over! No matter what, admit nothing! We have citizens working 3 jobs and can't take a 3 day vacation! That's sick with politicians having 50k lunches
SDNY has those taxes and soon we will be hearing what charges our filed as a result! Of course Trump is going to cry &amp; whine about witch hunts &amp; evil twin brothers that's out to destroy him! This has been incredibly embarrassing having this imbecile as president.
as someone who used to support the GOP they are gonna have to find away to grow with a limited number of racist. I think after Trump's criminal career comes to light no one will want anything to do with Trump or the party that enabled him to give Russia the advantage!
the GOP used to stand for something. Of course very few was aware that 90% of the party was racist! When did bankruptcies &amp; sexual assault become positive factors when electing a president! No decent Republican would b caught dead with Trump &amp; Epstein on rape island!
are you a life long republican or did you only start voting republican when trump came around?
Pure Trump right here. Laughable.
gay guys don't like biden. indians don't like biden. seeing biden have to apologize to black community over insensitive comments. hispanics don't like biden. not being trump is his only advantage. i hate you south carolina.
you're at risk of losing my vote. I think you should Kamala Harris to ease nuclear state relations between India and the United States. If I vote for Trump it's cause I think group suicide is inevitable and I don't want Democrats to be blamed for it.
if i vote for trump it's cause i think group suicide is inevitable and i don't want my party to be blamed for it.
Judge rules E. Jean Carroll can continue to seek Trump's DNA in defamation suit - CNNPolitics  Trump is in trouble! #TrumpIsALoser
I might vote Trump that way when I meet God I can tell him it wasn't a Democrat that caused a nuclear war.
And the purpose of this is? So Trump can allow it to spread again &amp; say it‚Äôs bad again in other countries? Fits his narrative all too well. Too bad our travel is banned in most countries. I wouldn‚Äôt want us either:)))
If you think Trump is just going to cruise to a reelection, I think you are going to be as shocked as Karl Rove was in 2012 when Romney lost. I don‚Äôt hardly watch any MSM, but I get information from several sources.
In fact, HRC lost MI, WI, &amp; PA with a combined 0.76% total vote. Trump literally squeak out the window. And HRC was just so toxic. The election is up in the air, but Trump has an uphill battle. Biden is live in AZ, FL, GA, IO, NC &amp; SC. Hell, Trump has had to put money in TX!
we Americans know that the current president is an immoral racist with close ties to Russia who lies constantly!If the post Master really wants to risk breaking the law by helping Trump and Putin steal another election with misinformation&amp;computer hacking b ready to pay!
Personally I would rather a nuclear war happen under a President Trump than a President Biden.  I'm really thinking about this. Ultimately maybe I do hope I vote for the loser.
The governor's of each state are the ones keeping things shut down. If you would like trump to call an executive order to open all great! ...but then you will just complain he overstepped... So what exactly will you do different Biden??
Spent 10 minutes typing out a heated reply to my religious conservative uncle and it really got my blood boilin so now I‚Äôm sippin on some cool water tryna chill out but like FUCK TRUMP
Just like Trump's obsession with this guy. Everyday damn near Trump has to insult Obama!Obama didn't do anything. Hell I'm a moderate Republican,more of a McCain type &amp; Obama's biggest insult to Trump loyalist is,he was black.He gave millions health care, they hate him 4 that too
I know this election if he's down even 5pts in the polls and wins I'm headed to Washington with my traitor Trump sign and I'll stay there until this Russian TRAITOR leaves or kills us all. The racist don't care as long as he's a flaming racist! How screwed up!
no one can trust 1 word that falls out of this liars mouth! He DAMN SURE SHOULDN'T BE PRESIDENT! How in the hell is America gonna have a habitual liar running the top office! That doesn't even make sense! Russia had to hack Trump in, no way America voted him in

BREAKING.. Unemployment falls to 10.5% 1.8 million jobs added.  Thanks President Trump.
I have voted republican in the past, but not today. Trump is trying to be a dictator, and the republicans in the Senate are helping. Your dad was NOT OK with that !!
What rights are you gaining by voting for Trump ????
Chicken Joe.. Fred Fleitz: If Biden skips debates with Trump here's how our enemies will read it
Typical Trump Republicans. They think black voters are stupid!
Bureaucratic power #mupsc207
Trump is always ginning up the racism though. With ‚Äúchina virus‚Äú or ‚ÄúKung flu‚Äú or the Bubba Wallace situation. It‚Äôs dog whistle after dog whistle. He has dismantled DACA and the ACA portions which directly affects African-Americans.
On the announcement of running for presidency his line was that Mexicans were ‚Äúrapists.‚Äù He built the false equivalency of ‚Äúboth sides‚Äú on Charlottesville. He claimed a judge involved in his¬†Trump University court case was ruling against him because of the judge was Mexican.
Come on bro! This is not the war you want to fight with Donald Trump on the other side. Biden made a gaffe and immediately apologized. Trump on the other hand has trafficked in racism For decades. He was the original ‚Äúbirther‚Äú in chief. Hounding Obama for not being born here.
out of respect for india. i'll tell ya don't worry about them. them nasty ass trump voters gotta live with me. i promise ya they belong together with those they hate and here i am.
I finally realized that the cognitive test was what Trump was talking about when he said ‚Äúanybody that wants one can get one‚Äù!!!
Like Trump sat down and read a book! Give me a break! üòÇ
Instead of the constant Trump bashing, try naming the good things the Dems have done for this country... Oh wait, you can't... They're trying to destroy it.
What‚Äôs that got to do with our country being in shambles because of Trump. Pretty sure the Democrats have this election. House, senate and presidency. It will take all three to get things back in order. Even his own is turned against him.
I love this Trump has done more against the 2nd Amendment than President Obama ever did, yet he's claiming to be pro-gun. Hell, her famously said take the guns first, worry about due process later.
I‚Äôve tried so many times to talk to my parents but they mainline Fox News and I can‚Äôt get through to them. The last time I tried my dad screamed I was a dirty socialist who wanted to kill babies. We have barely spoken since. It‚Äôs sad. I‚Äôve basically lost my parents to Trump/Fox
Trump executive order puts pressure on Microsoft to move quickly to acquire TikTok‚Äôs U.S. operations  via    Is this legal? Can Trump do this? I have no idea.
Joe Biden made some very inappropriate and racist comments. His apology isn‚Äôt an apology but an attempt to say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not what I meant‚Äù when he clearly said what he denies saying. Joe Biden and Donald Trump. These are the people we have to choose from.
OMG!!!!!!...‚Ä¶Have you people lost your flipping minds???????..... A vote for any Democrat right now is totally unamerican!..... Go down the list and vote all Republican!... Let's get these moronic Democrats out of the house!!!!!!! Trump 20/20!!!
Well let's see if Joe Biden would have been president he would have let all Chinese come into the United States! Instead of shutting the border like Trump did! So I would say right now we would probably have about 2 million dead! Thank God for Trump!
Did u know that ppl r suing the NRA to try to STOP them from helping  win again 2020. If ur a NRA best step to get Trump reelected. Btw, the NRA help set some gun laws for Americans to be able to protect themselves.
But it‚Äôs still in Trump‚Äôs America so it‚Äôs bad. Also why are we playing sports in 2020 when so much can go wrong. And football is the betterest anyways. And liberals will probably shut it down. I think I covered it all....
as a devoted REPUBLICAN I'm completely sickened at what the leaders have led this party into. This is why you designate leaders! To watch for trouble, they should have steered the party away from Trump. Made him run as an independent! The racist jumped on board &amp; it was over
Liberals are absolute morons nowadays! Maybe when they stay out of the White House for 20 years they will get the 1972 McGovern idea! In other words get rid of the 1969 hippies in your damn party if you ever want the White House again! Trump wins by over 100 electoral votes!
of course 90% of Republicans were perpetrating, we aren't racist and we damn sure don't molest women! Nor do we lie constantly! We also care more about the Constitution than to let Russia, our greatest enemy come in and lie to our citizens!No way! Traitors of Trump do it all
how smart does 1 have to be to know that Trump of all people was a loser! How did the 4 bankruptcies not clue u in! Or the fact that he'd spent a decade laundering money with Russia! This is all right there, coffee table reading. Thanks for destroying my party morons!
UPDATE: What began as an opportunity to welcome President Donald Trump to his state ended with a surprise COVID-19 result for Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine on Thursday.
What is this poll you're speaking of? I'd like to take a look at it... Is it the poll you made up in your mind because you're in denial that the Dems tried to keep slavery and prove every day they're the racist ones? OR do you just suffer from Trump derangement syndrome?
Trump has bungled the response to Covid-19 that over 4.85M cases have been confirmed and 159K deaths reported has decimated the family unit. Seniors are the most vulnerable. Everything Trump touches dies. #ETTD #TrumpKillsSeniors #Dems4USA

This suit isn‚Äôt going to take away the 2A. Stop spreading lies. You are just trying to whip up Trump‚Äôs base who are too dumb to realize NRA is not the 2A. Not trying to disrespect, but Trump does like the uneducated
So you think Trump is immortal?
Imagine if Trump had said that.
Trump hurts himself, every time he tweets or opens his mouth !! How can any sane person still support his hate ????
She was elected by the people... Trump is only I office because of Russia and the EC ! What is wrong with YOU people ?????
Is that why Trump fired his campaign manager because everything is going so well? If you think you wins in a landslide I advise you to go put money on him because the betting odds have him as a pretty substantial underdog. Woman. Man. Person. Camera. TV.
If trump said this Liberals would lose their minds, but since it‚Äôs joe Biden they don‚Äôt care
There is no vaccine or bill or amount of ice cream or even donuts that would persuade me to vote for Trump.
What will markets do if Trump wins election night but Biden wins weeks later via mail in ballots?
We need to sound the alarm: Trump could refuse to accept defeat. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm joining #ProtectTheResults:
They‚Äôre coming after Trump....the damn dirty dogs will stop at nothing...
It‚Äôs a plan that‚Äôs working and very dangerous for America. We can‚Äôt have a leader that refuses to be available to express his ideas about what he wants or intends to change that betters our lives . You can dislike Trump but don‚Äôt do something that destroys us .
At least that would stop the virus. Obviously Trump doesn‚Äôt WANT to stop the virus!  Putin probably ordered him to kill off as many of us as possible to make us vulnerable so Putin could take over the US!
The Russian connection was proven to be a lie , Muller should had found the truth not just charge  team for made up charges , to get them to roll on Trump , they had nothing to tell them , because no Russia thing happened, that was a set up !!
Sooooo much proof has come out that Obama was behind the spying on Trump and how Clinton and her people had total immunity while they arrested so many of   team on made up dumb ass charges !!
Based on this small poll, Biden voters should stop expecting people to collapse under their "Never Trump" pressure and just vote green or write in Sanders. 'Incremental' change is better than Trump isn't it?
"Vote for Biden because he isn't Trump" is not going to win my vote. Biden and his campaign have to do better.
Trump didn‚Äôt write that! Ha! I read his tweets &amp; there scattershot like Steve‚Äôs. Maybe Stephen Miller? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Regardless, I don‚Äôt know why they hate Comey so much; his opening the FBI investigation on HRC 11D before the election b/c her aide was Weiner‚Äôs wife was a HRC killshot.
Is he on a different planet than Mary Trump #TrumpIsAnIdiot  #MaryTrumpBook
Woohoo!  I would just like for him to quit lying... All the time... Is that so hard?  #TrumpIsALoser
Yep and Mr. Perfect (no not Trump) lol
The only way America can be great again. Mr. Trump is for America to be good again under God the heavenly father up above.
how sick can you be too help a known racist continue to put a foot on the back of all black people's necks! Ur not only a traitor to ur country ur a traitor to ur own race pal! U need a straight jacket, not an election bid. We all know what ur up to Trump Jr
Don't worry, help is on the way...  But I feel you. I'm in a tRump heavy area, too...  #NoComradesUnder1k
there's no way u have 30mil followers either! Just like ur daddy traitor Trump.. Buying those fake followers. The day u set out to help Russia and traitor Trump u've became an enemy as far as any decent American is concerned! Your disgusting, find a good therapist!
He stated that it was because his passport had expired. Trump then remembered his needed renewed so he could travel to Mar-a-Lago
I had that thought today as we tapped our brakes to save a squirrel. IF Trump drives, would he expend that minimal amount of effort to save a small creature of God‚Äôs creation? I don‚Äôt think so.
Neither Biden nor Trump are gonna win a medal in the speech Olympics, but at least Joe can blame a terrible stutter for his foibles. What‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs excuse?
You do realize Biden‚Äôs been through multiple debates and given myriad interviews. Right? And how are you gonna talk about Biden‚Äôs competence when Trump sounds like he‚Äôs in late stage dementia. He pronounced Yosemite as Yo Semite üòÜ You‚Äôre in a bubble.
BTW: Good luck with California voting Trump! üòÇ
Yard signs are your metric? Ever consider ppl like myself in red/purple states wouldn‚Äôt dare post a Biden yard sign or put on a bumper sticker for fear of retribution? Trump voters are flipping out in Target over wearing a mask. I don‚Äôt need my house egged or tires slashed.
Biden isn‚Äôt my favorite but he‚Äôs at least competent &amp; will surround himself with people who will know what they‚Äôre doing unlike Jared Kushner in every spot just b/c he‚Äôs his son-in-law. Biden wrote an Op-Ed in the NYT in Jan of its danger. Trump was golfing for 3 weeks in March!
traitor Trump needs to be investigated thoroughly! 9
Many of the riots were by anarchists who just wanna see things burn and ANTIFA who are not Dem‚Äôs and hate Biden. The virus was bungled by Trump. He said it was a hoax, then it was just 15 ppl who had it and it‚Äôd be 0 soon, that it‚Äôd just ‚Äúgo away‚Äù w/out a vaccine. He DQd himself.
Exactly! Traitor Trump needs prison time for any crimes he may have committed such as money laundering, tax or bank fraud.
I'm glad Neil wouldn't allow Trump to degrade his music. I have a lot of respect for Neil young! He's awesome!
I knew Neil was one of the good guys. Trump is disgusting. After the Hollywood tape came out and I listened as Trump bragged about sexually violating someone's daughter I knew he'd never have my vote. I can't believe he was elected.We've lowered the Bar so much!
Donald Trump
Let it go Bro. Trump isn‚Äôt anti-Semite. Like him or not that just doesn‚Äôt fly.
Take a break from Trump and report real news&gt; Why won't Biden take a cognitive test? See? I did your job for you
king sumo giveaways are trump giveaways. the absolute worst. the democratic party should be all over that shady shit like donkey kong. terrorism funding and everything else in there. bad stuff.
ya no doubt. they don't let me comment or post or anything else. instagram hates democrats just like fb. but that's alright we gonna take all that back.  Instagram Algorithm Favored Posts About Trump
This is just an excuse to avoid speaking in front of people and to ultimately not have to face  because Trump is going to eat Biden alive in the same way a pig is devoured in a tank of piranhas!  #KAG2020TrumpLandslideVictory
However, even just looking at the U.S., Trump's supporters are mostly rural voters. When considering the electorate and voter disenfranchisement, there's only really a *silenced* majority, and they oppose these white fascists as well as the global majority that speak it loud.
That's actually probably more accurate. The majority of the world isn't made up of entitled white Trump supporters.
and in the disgusting off chance that trump wins this election takes back the house and keeps the senate now remember the most likely person to attack your precious fossil fuel infrastructure in the united states is a green party member.
Disaster. üò†Trump will win again.
Dana my dude, you are too intelligent to be voting for Donald fucking Trump. This is a guy who couldn‚Äôt even pronounce Yosemite. The Jonathan Swan HBO interview alone should disqualify him.
i told joe biden my generation will be authoritarians. i told that to donald trump to. hey you guys i'm 40 years younger than you. obviously you're not from my generation. DUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Because there‚Äôs a Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, thankfully. Trump wants to be a dictator, so he hates that, but it‚Äôs traumatizing to people who are abducted by people working for OUR government.
now remember trump misplaces words.   censures self on purpose.  trump said what. what exactly did trump say.  trump said nuke a hurricane. he meant a volcano.
Results? Not Trump
what's up racist. You should really drop the Republican title. When u under cover racist slithered outta ur closet to support Trump u became loyalist! Not only have u helped Trump &amp; Putin to destroy the party but ur HELPING Trump betray America!Everything will come out
how long are we gonna let these criminals make millions off the US government.120 million dollars last quarter for Jared and the traitor Trump kiddo gang! We already know Jared&amp;Trump will break the law to get what they want.Can't wait until these crooks meet Justice
u haven't even tried to help people of color though have you traitor Trump.U are such a traitor!I swear I think the CIA and FBI should completely go over the White House with a fine tooth comb after u leave. You've probably installed bugs all over the White House
Why can‚Äôt Trump answer the questions he‚Äôs asked?
Sorry to tell you Bob but our country is already dead thanks to people like you that worship Trump
Thanks to Trump ignoring it.
He's trying to help Trump.
If Barr or Trump was involved, do you think Maxwell would be sitting in a jail cell right now?  Funny the prosecutor was fired and the new one Barr appointed, soon after the arrest was made!
I hope when Biden wins he puts mr kirschner in charge of the Trump administration crimes against the people

I think you‚Äôre worried . All the bull you‚Äôve posted and Trump is still losing. Oh, has he figured out who ‚Äúbombed‚Äù Libya today? He‚Äôs such a joke.
Houses are for sale all over zillow use to show the pre foreclosure list but the master's commissioners list which shows houses going on auction soon is getting longer. trump must stopped zillow showing pre foreclosures cause he only wants rich people to get discounts.

Trump May Give Convention Speech from White House  They can't do that can they?
American people are bracing for ___ and you Democrats have been trying to remove Trump from day one. It's not going to happen  so if you don't like it leave it.Or better yet accept the fact that Trump is your President and elections have conquinces.
It‚Äôs breathtaking what they did!  President Trump knows something??
Super ironic seeing Trump push for school reopenings because of inequality concerns. The ironic thing is that they're acting as if this only exists in remote learning, when it exists everywhere. These same people say to people in poverty "should've just graduated high school".
Trump's enthusiasm gap argument is him having 10% support, but very ~loyal~ supporting and thinking that's a big win
Trump talking about terrorist attack people be asking Governor Beshear to activate national guard to protect fossil fuel infrastructure and Trump is pulling people off the street. I don't approve of either one of them. Maybe Beshear get a primary in 2023.

Trump is clueless. #TrumpIsALoser
It‚Äôs in the numbers from the government Bob. You might want to look them up . The governor that Trump is over. They still have to record numbers even when he has killed our country.
Maybe Trump should just stay away from interviews and inspect his bunker again.
You‚Äôre still lying Bob. You did learn something from Trump. LOL
How many times has Trump said he‚Äôs gonna replace Obamacare? Just adding to his 20000 + lies.
No actually if you would do your research everybody is losing because of Trump
Making fun of the handicapped. Just another service offered by trump supporters.

maybe absent mindfulness is mark zuckerberg greed mitch mcconnell racism donald trump
Trump is a big picture guy. Not like, ideas, but like, giant ass charts.
So, go ahead and vote for your candidate. Many of us simply will not support what he represents, just as we won't support Trump.  We will not fall in line, and we will not settle. So, keep whining and gas-lighting. It won't make a difference to us.
Not even worth discussing: 1. Biden didn't run in 2016. 2. We don't have time travel. That kind of argument is useless to make, because we simply do not and cannot know how he would have responded. Biden and the DNC are just as corrupt as Trump and the Repubs. Both are equal shit
Both parties are sin. Kentucky sent a governor to India to plead for investment in Kentucky while India thirsts and starves to death. Trump went and begged for assistance to reelection through aluminum tariffs. I beg you India rise up have compassion and tell them how you feel
Trump will not steal the election this UNHOLY MAN. McConnell is the greed, Trump is the racism, who is the absent minded one? I can not figure out the 3rd leg of this demonic trinity.
Bullshit. There is NO better choice when you're talking Biden and Trump.  By voting for either, you're wasting your vote. NEITHER party will EVER change, and voting for their candidates only empowers them to continue ignoring you.
You're right, it won't make a difference.  We KNOW Trump is a piece of crap.  But, so is Biden. Some of us actually pay attention to politicians. If people think he cares about us rather than his own interests, then he has them fooled just as much as Obama did.
If you voted for Trump and you are not rich or some level of racist, you need to take a long look in the mirror.
Pandering to the big corporations and banks that backed him, all the while charming the public into thinking he actually gave a shit and worked for them?  He wasn't nearly as bad as Trump, but let's not glorify someone who doesn't deserve it.
People: don‚Äôt bring politics into sports.  Trump: Brings sports into politics.

Come on Donald Trump! Tell me how schools can open up and meet social distancing guidelines? A school is big enough to handle 30 students per class, all rooms are at capacity. How are those schools gonna meet guidelines. There's a lot of schools in that position around the US.
Oh, he will still be president. Not from delaying the election or pulling some sneaky shit after the election...   simply won't win the election. I hate Trump as much as anyone, but that is the sad reality. Biden simply does NOT have the support he needs.
I didn't say I wasn't voting. I'm just not voting for Biden or Trump.  Again, with the insults. Insults make for the most compelling arguments. Wins people over every single time, what with the "maturity" it takes to dole them out.
No way Biden debates Trump. I hope he does, it would be hilarious to see Trump shred him... Not gonna happen though. The puppet master pulling Bidens strings will make sure of that.
The should consider a presidential golf course instead of a library when Trump leaves office.

Words really can't describe how awful Trump truly is but this Op-ed comes close. #TrumpIsALoser
Let's all agree on one thing - Trump is a liar. He will lie about anything. He has been lying about healthcare for over 3 years. He has no plan. The #GOP have no plan. We must stop believing any that Trump says.  #TrumpIsALoser
Even as I joke, I would never want people to think, for a split second, I support trump (not capitalizing the name on purpose bc he doesn‚Äôt deserve it).
Ah, another vote-shamer. When  loses, it will be his failure, not mine.   I will not support a candidate whose policies and character I oppose.  So, no vote for Biden OR Trump for me.  Its time we stand up for our principles instead of supporting our corrupt duopoly.

Some dude just told me Democrat‚Äôs are trying to make trump look bad. BUBBY WE AINT GOTTA DO SHIT HE MAKES HIMSELF LOOK BAD AND STUPID AND RACIST AND HOMOPHOBIC *honorable mentiom he is also a rapist
i think a lot of the reason even though i'm pretty much a socialist i can appeal to trump democrats is cause i'm not concerned about roles and if necessary i can be an antagonist. i'm the bad guy.
is going to destroy  Biden has been in DC for nearly 50 yrs &amp; has nothing but failure upon failure to show for it + a history of racism he cannot run away from! Couple that with the fact that he has abt 3 brain cells. GOOD LUCK!

Under Biden as VP ..Isis was on TV all the time , Benghazi happened, Obamacare no one picked up phone, economy no where near as good as under Trump..what is it you want to do again Biden?
No.  I won't fall in line.  I won't settle.  I will not support corruption.  I will not vote for either Biden or Trump.  IF Biden were elected (which he won't win), he would not work toward ANY policy that I support. He's already said he won't.  Nothing will fundamentally change.
I used to love your show ‚ÄúLove Connection‚Äù.  Then u became a trump fan...ugh!
Neither Biden nor Trump have policies that I agree with. If you think Biden is for climate change, LGBTQ rights, etc, then you haven't been paying attention to his record or what he has said this cycle. He is just as corrupt and self-interested as Trump.
They‚Äôre betting on whoever they choose for his VP to step up early in the term to become president. So the election will be Trump vs Biden‚Äôs VP.

I saw Asa Hutchinson though criticizing Trump for saying there could an election postponement. So you're already making a difference.
Why is this so hard to understand? Neither Biden nor Trump has my support. When Biden loses, it will be because HE failed to earn enough support to win.   I will not support him because he is just as corrupt as Trump. I am standing for my principles,  just as so many others are.
Oh, I'm voting, just not for Biden or Trump.   As far as privilege,  that argument is fucking stupid. You know nothing about me to make that judgement.  Perhaps if Biden were a better candidate who supported policies I agree with, he might have a chance. His loss, his failure.
i found 3 people wanted an amy mcgrath sign.  i did a cursory drive around the community and found only 1 trump sign and 1 byedon sign.   make of it what ya will. no mcconnell signs.  mitch where's your signs?
This whole "privilege" accusation for standing up for my principles and not voting for Biden or Trump has went from annoying to infuriating.  I can't help if  is a shit candidate only interested in himself and his corp backers.  I won't settle. I won't fall in line.
Again, no, we fucking hate Trump, too. We're simply standing up for our principles and not supporting yet another corrupt corporate bootlicker.  Why is that so hard to understand?
One of the most radical ideas I‚Äôve ever heard. What happened to good tax policy?

Very little that can be done ATP.  Congress can hold hearings but have no power to prosecute. They send their findings to the Senate who then squashes it. AG Barr isn‚Äôt going to act and of course Trump isn‚Äôt. He can only be held accountable once we remove these crooks.

New Disclosures Confirm: Trump Himself Was Target of Obama Administration‚Äôs Russia Probe | National Review
You people, as in Trump ass-kissers. I'm trying to figure out how you can use Twitter, all the while being too inept to literally look up the very specific situation you're referring to.  So... what? Is your social worker reading this for you and responding for you? Is that it?
I can dig that. Without republicans Biden and Trump in the mix, who we voting for?
I understand your frustration. America will be the template for all other countries and know, Trump IS assisting ALL countries in the cabal cleanup. Just stay strong, we are all in the same battle, but NEVER be disempowered, that's what THEY thrive on. Much love to you! :)
You mean the TRUMP VIRUS #trumpvirus
Breaking my Kayne rule here: Does anyone else think team trump is 100% funding and propping up his presidential thing?
President Trump started closing the borders on Jan 6th, I personally believe it eas due to money, my sister had a friend who stood in line 4.5 hrs didn't get tested gave no info, got a letter saying she was positive. I believe it's the testing.
It's okay to admit we got scammed in 2016. Lots of people bought a crappy Trump steak.  Just don't buy a second one.
This is what happens when the goal is to win at all costs. It‚Äôs a problem not just with Trump, but his with followers.
Trump KILLED Herman Cain
delivered Boehner &amp; Ryan as speakers, barley less anti-Trump than Nancy Pelosi. If a candidate is getting actual support from them, they‚Äôre probably in the ‚Äúonly slightly less evil than the Dem‚Äù category - committed to support ‚ÄúMain St‚Äù (liberal) speaker over Jim Jordan.
‚Å¶ So what are the odds you, me, and thousands of others are the ‚Äú1 of 15‚Äù Trump Patriots they selected? ü§î

Yeah ok Trump.  Everyone lies but you right?  Give it a rest.   We all know you now and know that your a liar.  Nothing you can say will save you.
The Maryland county where Barron Trump attends school has ordered private schools to stay closed
So irrational that Trump‚Äôs kid will not attend school
Barron Trump‚Äôs school will not have in-person classss  The Maryland private school that Barron Trump attends will not be permitted to open for in-person classes until at least October under a countywide mandate ordering private schools to remain closed

A non-vote is a Trump vote  If you‚Äôre not voting against Trump you‚Äôre voting for Trump  Voters who don‚Äôt like either candidate can‚Äôt have it both ways  As Granmie says, ‚Äúüí©, or get off the pot‚Äù
This is true. 'Nobody likes me,' Trump complains, as even his allies fade
This is nothing new. Analyst: Trump and AG gave us 'dangerous misinformation'
Don't fall into whataboutism! Don't counter the Bill Clinton issues with Donald Trump! It only makes you look like you're defending him!
Just to clarify, you do not have to say that Donald Trump is a pedo while calling out Bill Clinton. You can call them out separately. Just like we were allowed to do before Bill was exposed. Don't try to fall into the whataboutism trap that conservatives try to set.
Probably a C130 they train the pilots here in Charleston WV.when the gulf war started the ground shook. They flew over in waves would be 40 or 50 transporting equipment. My ceiling has cracks from it!
‚ÄúI do not support Donald Trump, but...‚Äù
When the virus experts should have only one motive/agenda and that‚Äôs the safety of the people. That‚Äôs most definitely not the case here. P.S. I‚Äôm def not a Trump supporter (although Biden would be even worse).
Yes I'm pissed because I've seen more money raised for someone's sick dog. WTH PPL?  #RIPBernellTrammell and üñïüèº BLM for literally not caring about his life just because he supported Trump. You make me sick!!!!
I should NOT have to keep retweeting this but here I am &amp; where the hell are you all?   BERNELL TRAMMELL'S LIFE MATTERED!   If you don't have 5 bucks to help honor a man who was murdered for supporting Trump then I'm hanging with the wrong crowd.  I have personally verified this!
Lol farmers hate them.
If they like you or if you feed them they will bring you what you think you like.
Hate crows! Never had anything stole that I know of but they are harbingers of death or really bad stuff. Had crows on the porch the day before and day my mom died and had one outside the booth taunting me the day I had my stroke! Not joking.
He voted to impeach.  He is no supporter of trump   Get your facts straight.
Donald Trump can date Chris Brown üòÇ that would be hilarious, they "belong" together
It doesn‚Äôt take a ‚ÄúNoble‚Äù Prize winner to know why Fauci has high approval ratings-while Trump doesn‚Äôt-Fauci tells the truth, Trump lies.
Little Trump talkin‚Äô like Big Trump.
FYI These 2 GoFundMes are working in conjunction to make sure this country remembers and honors Burnell Trammell even when #BlackLivesMatter refuses to acknowledge him because he supported Trump. I'd like to see  Or  help!
He not only supported President Trump, he supported #BlackLivesMatter Who has refused to help with anything related to Mr. Trammell because he supported Trump.  He was murdered 4 it  Conservatives take up death of Black man in Milwaukee who supported Trump
‚ÄúActually it wasn‚Äôt for raping but hitting on girls and Trump was one of the few famous names willing to help local law enforcement with the investigation into Epstein.  Do some research Skippy.‚Äù  Sounds like you made an assumption there.
I will testify under oath right now that I have never seen Trump on pedo island either.
You can't be fucking serious....
First, give me a break. Trump made it clear he wanted 5 innocent black guys executed before they were exonerated from their crimes, and even then he didn't take his bullshit back.  If you are against BLM, and you support the police during this time, then you support the killing.
Normally when you have a caddie, you are walking the course.  To have a caddie when you also have a cart - unusual.  Maybe Trump needs someone to tell him on all 18 holes what great golfer he is (despite his cheating and rule ignoring).
So therefore it was a lie from the original poster that Trump is blocking putting up Obama‚Äôs portrait! #CriticalThinking
0.0006% fraud rate over last 20 years worth of mail in votes. I wonder what the fraud rate is on electronic voting machines- bet it‚Äôs wayyyyyy more! And that‚Äôs why trump doesn‚Äôt want it to happen despite mailing in own voteü§£
Lawmakers participating in rare weekend talks on a huge coronavirus relief measure reported progress on Saturday.
That‚Äôs what trump has done since elected and you have beaten him up every step of the way
Trump and Navarro have blood on their hands As does Kushner
Racist rapist Bigot narcissistic Nazi was ashamed to join the presidents club at John Lewis funeral. He couldn‚Äôt look at the eyes of all 3 past two term presidents as Trump was certain he is a humiliating single term president, worse off than James Buchanan.
Also, I would about bet I‚Äôm OLDER than you. Quit tryna minimalise me as something Im not because I won‚Äôt conform to your shitty ideals that led to Donald Trump becoming president
And a new FBI Headquarters  building  across  street from Trump's hotel.
You seem to forget how we got Donald Trump- it‚Äôs because of 8 yrs of failed neoliberal policies of Obama/Biden. And your solution is to make Biden president?? Your just begging for us to have Tom Cotton as president in 2024 or 2028, a smarter more competent trump. Your sick af!

Better yet Why should Biden debate Trump?
President Donald Trump said he will take action as soon as Saturday to ban TikTok, a popular Chinese-owned video app that has been a source of national security and censorship concerns.
I don't think it's partisan to acknowledge any of this. Ps. Jeffress has the paradigm wrong. If you want to support Trump, fine, affirm whatever it is you see in him &amp; exhort him earnestly to Kingdom values. Challenge him! He never does that.
I know who we are talking about. They were going there for at least 12 years. And trump banned Epstein over a real estate deal, not being creepy.   And Epstein recruited a worker at the club. You are telling me they didn‚Äôt know what he was doing? Bullshit.
Trump is totally obsessed with Obama
Had pho for lunch yesterday and the lil Vietnamese waiter had on a Louis belt, Burberry polo, and a Trump 2020 mask and I‚Äôm still shook...
It would be nice if Trump would just walk and disappear into that cornfield just past the outfield (like his coronavirus).
Right, I‚Äôm not saying Trump did a great job at all lol. But hasn‚Äôt the death rate gone down since the summer?
*Trump‚Äôs re-election strategy*
In the racist rapist bigot narcissistic Nazi rallies you hear that the white voters are so petrified of non-whites getting any political power, they are willing to vote Trump and die of Trump Virus rather than live equally among black and brown citizens.
Louis DeJoy in cahoots with Trump and the GOP to steal the election        Time to investigate is before the election
This is how Trump will steal the election

No bigger of a threat than our own government honestly lmao. Trump just jelly he ain‚Äôt the only ones spying on American citizens. If he was serious about China, he would stop Walmart from selling nothing but Chinese goods.
not to get political or anything but trump a bitch
If Trump was such a great businessman, he woulda had the foresight to see how harmful COVID would be for economy and took measures to stop it. Instead, the trust fund baby, who was inherited 1/2 billion dollars, tanked it. Instead of daddy bailing him out this time, taxpayers are

You are right, we need real leadership. Since your a Republican, be a Patriot and announce that your running against Trump as a Republican since your politics are in alignment, &amp; support Bernie Sanders taking over the Democratic Party as he‚Äôs the only true democrat in the party?
Not real sure about color, but all true Americans with common sense that I know love Trump

Sad that you have sold your sole to Trump.  You know what they say about karma......,,,
Oh my god. He probably had no clue what Epstein did or didn‚Äôt have. Better to get out in front than to be behind.   And I don‚Äôt think trump raped any girls (women, today different story), but I think he knew and at best turned a blind eye.
He‚Äôd been going to maralago for at least twelve years before trump banned him. And most people think he banned him because he fucked him on a real estate deal or because of the investigation. Not because trump cared about girls getting raped.
Trump is so nefarious and dishonest that he thinks everyone just has to be like him,  if anyone is going to be dishonest in this election it will be Trump and the republicans and I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll make it look like something went wrong so he can stay longer
If you listen to racist rapist narcissistic Nazi dear leader, you will die horribly with putrid Covid ball of pus like rapid American dogs, case in point, pet negro of trump, Herman Cain.
Whatever!  Trump Virus
Hell, I never said Trump raped any girls. I don‚Äôt think he did. I just said recruitment happened at maralago, so there was a connection, in response to someone saying there wasn‚Äôt.

This is Lopez Obrador, Mexico‚Äôs president, not Joe Biden. Try again.
Do people know how there are other things on the internet than Twitter? Like I‚Äôm not saying I am thrilled about Biden being the candidate, but he has policy plans on his website. Disagree with them, but they are there.
I won't lie we got little bit of a dust problem right now but as more Democrats take office, soon Biden, Amy in the Senate, West Virginia's senate race will grow fiercely competitive relatively soon, Owensby will replace Massie &amp; across river if not now 2 years. U can't beat me.
So if CNN is fake news like you said  That mean the news about china that want Biden is Fake News.
Biden can barely form sentences. He has dementia on top of his natural propensity to say wildly racist shit his entire career. There‚Äôs no way they can put him on an unscripted show to talk to someone.
Stop telling those lies, Lauren. Kamala and Biden will be knocking on your door asking for your guns. Better hide em
Dudes still wanna vote for Ye. Biden wasn't wrong.
Jealous that Biden is winning?
Joe Biden aint doing ahit for America
Even counting mail in votes, Biden will lose.   Why does everyone think he'll win? Fuck the polls (not reliable and biased for over a decade now), pay attention to what ppl are actually saying. Biden doesn't have enough support.   #NeverBidenNeverTrump  #EvictCongress
Now that media is disparaging individuals they ignored. I‚Äôm not sure Biden can beat Trump for this very reason. There are people who felt ignored for years and are now feeling like a President cares about them so they‚Äôll vote for him regardless of what he does.
Biden and Kammy did
Haha Tammy Bruce...Biden pushing masks, idk til when...November 4th
I‚Äôm so sick of people saying this. You do realize the Democrats created the kkk and Biden in the biggest perv on earth and don‚Äôt get the started on the clintons. You need to do some research my dear. You making very uneducated statements.
You just made derogatory comments about a woman who named as the VP by Mr. Biden!! You're POS!!
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
idk i 100% get that there are many people--undocumented immigrants and their loved ones for example--who have no reason to hope this will be better for them and that's real and despicable. but we can organize against *that* under biden instead of begging to be allowed to vote lol
the biden/harris ticket is about keeping everyone who voted reluctantly against hillary the first time to stay home because these dems aren't as scary. they dont give a fuck about leftists but we still need them to do anything other than get snatched by feds for the next 4 years
honestly at this point i would be happy with a biden presidency that leads to literally anything positive actually getting done even if it's small. like do y'all remember what a functioning federal govt looks like?? cuz thanks to mitch mcconnell i literally don't
I‚Äôm voting for Biden/ Harris and I‚Äôm so excited - I wish the election was today !
One thing about Biden that owns is him declining to be on Jon Save America
"they should reevaluate the importance they place on superficial factors. what you want from an analyst is accuracy and understanding, not some hot take about how a backbench congressman reminds them of a young Jack Kennedy."
I've seen so many people in my little corner of Ohio (mostly centrists, moderate Republicans, and pretty much every riding with Biden Dem) have been calling for DeWine 2024  Certainly not an opinion I hold but looking at the other possible Republicans running, I hope he runs.
Just imagine being on the Biden secret service detail , he swims in his pool nude, they had to remove female staff !
Biden has no idea what‚Äôs even going on in the world today, his mind is stuck in his kkk past ! He believes he is better than you and us and that‚Äôs the definition of a racist !
Not jealous are we? Biden-Harris are winners.
How can Joe Biden be ahead on a fox polls on the coronavirus?  He‚Äôs done nothing, at all!
We should have bets on how many times Biden will garble it a day.  (If the #FakeNewsMedia shows it.) #VoteRedToSaveAmerica

YES Biden and Harris are not great at all but they are ABSOLUTELY better than the assholes in the white house now and they only way to remove those assholes now is to replace them
If you‚Äôre able to vote but deliberately sit this election out because you don‚Äôt personally like Biden and Kamala instead of voting for them to get trump out of office you‚Äôre dead to me js
Voting for anyone but Biden/Harris is unequivocally a vote for Trump/Pence.   That said, trump is going to win and cripple democracy and once that happens shits going to get super sideways.   The pendulum always swings back harder.
Biden should‚Äôve stocked up for hunter before he breeds again
What a fuck show. I can‚Äôt wait until all this is over. If it‚Äôs ever over. I feel like if either side wins just gonna be pissing and moaning for 4 more years. Ps I hate all 4 we have to choose from. I‚Äôm only voting Biden to see if anything goes back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù
Biden and Harris CANNOT beat Trump in a fair and square election....I am just gonna depend on God to sort it out......none of them neither D or R can ruin what God ordains.....but I can laugh at them as they try.....
I love how Biden made the CJ system worse with the Crime Bill. Fuck criminals.  I love how he has no sympathy for young people. Fuck young people.  I love how he'll make sure NOTHING fundamentally changes and corporations keep fucking people. Fuck people.
Going fun watch Kentucky go crazy when Biden and Harris wins. And Amy beats mitch
Biden seems to be doing he own work though. That‚Äôs what I got from that üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Trump‚Äôs buddies, DeWine (OH) &amp; Justice (WV) are forcing masks. So please explain using this argument??? I wouldn‚Äôt vote for Biden/Harris because of many socialist policies. But right now, apparently everyone needs to read the Constitution - R‚Äôs and D‚Äôs!
She‚Äôs amazing...she ask real questions, unlike the softball ones Biden gets...a d he gets them ahead of time so they can put the answer in the teleprompter
I mean the Biden thing is obvious but look at how many people on both sides vote 100% for partisanship or state partisanship as their reasoning.

She's only paying lip service in an attempt to sway progressives.   However, she's full of shit. Like Biden, there is absolutely NO WAY she'd actually do it. Look at her past actions, listen to what she's said before...now she's suddenly changes her tune? Bullshit.
Really? The Biden campaign needs to demand that Cheeto provide his tax returns, ALL of them.
She doesn't actually bring in ANY new voter support for Biden. Biden's base was already clamoring for Harris...no one outside of his base gives a shit about Harris.
She is NOT left of Biden. They are the same.
And really theoretically at this point, come on bet on yourself take a chance, Democrats are going to have unified control of the Democrats. Part of Joe Biden's plan is to help update homes for energy efficiency. Buy the house now and Democrats help ya upgrade it next year.
I‚Äôm pro Biden and Harris, but even I‚Äôm going to call BS on an 8 year old saying that. üòÇ
is corrupt. Beholden only to himself and his corp backers.  Author and supporter of legislation that is destructive to the people, like the Crime Bill and the ACA.   is just a boot-licking est Dem, just like Biden. Just as destructive and dangerous.
Did anyone see/hear that Biden is having a hard time pouncing Kamala.  Lol. Can't blame him though.  Lots of people have that problem.  #VoteRedToSaveAmerica
Really, Ryan, shut up. Are you TRYING to convince people not to vote for Biden? Do you WANT trump to win? No? Then shut up. Get on board with our candidate and say something positive. #BidenWarren2020 #BidenHarris #AmericaStrongerWithBiden
Agree, perhaps Harris helped Biden step back and think about some previous votes or stands no longer acceptable by the awakened left. Biden has proven he is a better man than Trump continuously.

That is the question. I seriously doubt that anyone voting for Joe Biden word instead boat for Kanye. However, in a race with only two options, millennials that might have held their for Joe Biden might instead vote Kanye . This + Russia + USPS + other dirty tricks add up.

Riddle me this: if Biden is so bad for Black America, why did he carry the Black vote in so many states?
It‚Äôs also funny that when Biden chose his vp every completely forgot how Congress and the senate screwed over the American people I‚Äôm happy about the pick but news should be holding them accountable until they get something done
The only VP candidate I was even remotely "excited" about was Stacy Abrams. I'm still not "excited" about any Biden ticket. However, Biden could have picked Bobo The Clown as his VP and I would happily vote for him. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I would still take the Biden/Harris ticket over anything the other side has put out in the last 4 presidential elections. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
The impact is me now not voting for Biden or Trump.
As a registered Republican, I genuinely am pleased with Biden‚Äôs pick. Kamala is rocksolid, smart, and tenacious. I am certainly not 100% aligned to that ticket, but it sure is hell beats another four years of Trump.
Joe Biden Picks #KamalaHarris As His Running Mate
Kamala Harris is going to jump turnout substantially in Indianapolis and so when Biden did the perfect answer of picking Harris - Biden ensured that the #bidenharris2020 ticket will win in Indiana also.
Listen... I was down with ya until you made that statement about Biden... Shame.
I said Biden/Harris is the worst presidential ticket ever.. but really anybody Biden chose would have still made it the worst ever.  Biden is the worst presidential candidate I‚Äôve seen so far as an American voter.
If for some reason   is the reason you won't vote for Biden - #WTF is wrong with you?  Like, if you were not going to vote for #Trump before - but Harris is your issue does that mean you prefer Trump to Harris?  Pence to Harris?  Like, What? ü§Ø #Vote2020
I'll break ya damn legs personally if y'all vote Biden ü§£ but move at ya own risk lmao
No, not really. She's caved to the establishment to much, sold out, etc. She doesn't have the fortitude to stand for the principles she SAYS she stands for.  How long would it take to cave and kiss pres Biden's ass?  #NeverBidenNeverTrump
I love you, George, but this kind of comment really makes me want to make a rude gesture in your direction.  Biden is atrocious, and so is Harris.  #NeverBidenNeverTrump
Electing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in November would be a grave mistake for this Nation with irreversible consequences. They will raise taxes, cut police funding, kill energy jobs, open our borders, and appease socialist dictators.
Wow, there's that vote shaming bullshit that's so effective.  You even took the time to make the same post on several of my comments. Nice.  Biden's loss will be HIS failure, not mine or people like me standing for our principles.   #NeverBidenNeverTrump

Biden and Harris both support taxpayer-funded abortion. I don't care if you hate Trump, are a life-long Democrat, pro-union, whatever - IF YOU CALL YOURSELF A CHRISTIAN, YOU CANNOT VOTE FOR THIS TICKET!
Because of Mitch McConnell's dilly dallying Joe Biden will be the next President of the United States. The last victim of the Grim Reaper from Kentucky could well be Donald Trump himself. McConnell must pay the ultimate price &amp; have his legacy destroyed as a back stabber known.
I'll back Biden as democratic candidate, but if I had my choice, Kamala Harris would have been at the top of the ticket, not VP. She could tear Cheeto AND Pence apart in a debate without breaking a sweat.
"BUT TRUMP" is a bullshit argument, and a sad one.  We need to stand for our principles NOW. Voting for either only shows it's ok for them to shaft us more.  Biden is JUST as corrupt and atrocious as Trump. #NeverBidenNeverTrump
I do own my choices, since you don't seem to pay attention.  You Biden supporters are simply caustic bastards who apparently can't understand we are sick of the corruption from Dems and Repubs and refuse to support them.   I'm sure when Biden loses you'll blame progressives again
But see, I personally don't agree with you on Trump, but I don't disagree with you on Biden. I know we have to have 1 or the other, but as an independent, I can't fully support either.   As for you personally, you're one I can disagree with, but turn around and have a beer with.
Like typically you want a VP from a swing state, who isn't expected, who pulls a demographic you struggle with. Kamala doesn't do that for Biden.
She's kinda disliked by the left and right and only speaks to a specific breed of libs that Biden already secured the vote of. I just don't think it was a strategic move Biden will gain anything from, not that he will lose much.
Y‚Äôall... I‚Äôm legitimately afraid that tr*mp is going to win this election like people are going to refuse to vote for Biden esp now that he‚Äôs chosen Kamala because of the shitty things they‚Äôve both done but trump supporters actually will vote enough for him to win
Biden has owned this news cycle.
Uncle Joe shouldn't debate Trump either. Trump is comfortable in front of a mic. Joe is prone to stick his foot in his mouth. We, progressives, can't have that. There is no advantage to Biden debating Trump. #TrumpIsALoser
When Biden and Harris are far left and Kyle is a liberal   Republican logic is fun
Ordered my Biden/Harris swag today. We need some Doug and Jill swag too! And stickers of your pets - that‚Äôs not a weird request, right? ü§£
So wait, they are both saying Joe Biden is a Trojan Horse for Leftists while touting how Leftists think he and Harris are too centrist?  What kind of messaging is this?
Since Biden said that anarchists should be imprisoned I'm honestly disappointed I haven't seen any Tankies4Biden yet....
When will you? Everybody wants to talk about Biden being in cognitive decline when Trump is talking about curing COVID-19 with Lysol or UV light. Claiming the WW2 ended in 2017 because of a flu. Imagine if Biden said these things.
how are you calling Joe Biden racist with Trump has done nothing but make racist comments throughout his career and you call Biden a liar when Trump is the liar in chief. 22k + documented. I can produce receipts. ‚ÄúLook at my African-American!‚Äú How bout the CP5 Leo?
Today is a good day for our nation.  Biden/Harris will spend years fixing the problems from the tRump era.  But we will have their back.  AMERICA  STRONG and moving forward once again.!
It‚Äôs a binary choice. Trump or Biden. It goes far beyond the ACA. We cannot take another Kavanagh or Alito on SCOTUS. Recognizing climate change. Not calling BLM terrorists. Combating C19. Roe. Not isolating allies &amp; befriending dictators. All major issues Biden is better on.
Neither of them is my first choice, but I‚Äôm fairly content with small change at then national level. If you can‚Äôt see that the Biden ticket is an improvement from the Trump ticket, we aren‚Äôt seeing the same things. Vote in more progressive candidates on the local &amp; state levels
I‚Äôd rather have Biden/Harris in office than Trump/Pence. I still want to defund the police. I‚Äôd also like to not wake up every day afraid that our planet will suddenly collapse &amp; someone will say ‚Äúhaha gotcha!‚Äù bc I‚Äôve been in hell along which is what Trump presidency feels like
Is that you? üëÜüëÜüëÜ  The snark is just perfect. The fact that you are sitting on the sidelines yet cannot help throwing shade at the Dems because they don‚Äôt fit your ideological purity test sad. Remember Tulsi Gabbard, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders endorsed Joe Biden. üñïüèºüñïüèº
I don‚Äôt like Kamala but she‚Äôs better than Pence just like how I‚Äôm not too keen on Biden but he‚Äôs better than Trump
So Fake President blows up and is a little bitch over the fact Kamala Harris was made Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate.  Really ?  You don‚Äôt even have the Republicans supporting your Nazi Ass any more.
History does repeat itself, unfortunately, and people never learn from it.  The polls have been untrustworthy for a long time...Biden will not win this election, and the Dems will scream out progressives are to blame...again.   #NeverBidenNeverTrump
She's just another corp politician just like Biden. A sellout to corporate interests and only interested in their pocketbooks and hers.   Once again, the Dem party has made an egregious mistake and will lose the election.   #NeverBidenNeverTrump
I can't see Biden winning, anyway. He simply doesn't have the support and the "polls" have been eschewed as fuck for a long time, now.
The idea of 4 more years of Trump is atrocious, but the thought of Biden is equally shitty.  No unfollowing from me, my friend. Some of us actually don't react like a dickhead...lol  #NeverBidenNeverTrump  #NoComradesUnder1k
One thing about Biden, he won‚Äôt remember what Kamala said to him or about him
The fact you said "over Trump"  means you aren't actually talking about progress. Trump has to go. We all agree, that doesn't mean whatever Biden drags in is good lmao.
Kamala Harris, Biden's V.P. Pick, Is First Woman of Color on Major Party Ticket   Nice! Excellent choice!
People would have been saying the exact same thing about a very centrist Gov. Ralph Northam of VA at one time. His platform was much more milquetoast than Biden‚Äôs. However, with a liberal state house and senate, Northam has made VA one of the most liberal states in the union.
You know nothing of my socioeconomic status or the privilege I have. But if you are the type to stay home and not vote for Joe Biden because you are bitter that he‚Äôs not as liberal as you want, that is a privileged position. If he‚Äôs good enough for Bernie he‚Äôs good enough for me.
And hopefully we get a lot more social justice-esque progressives unseating these relics of the house and senate and they can‚Äôt put pressure on Biden (should he win) to move on the issue.
Oh, I 100 agree with you. We do need universal healthcare. It‚Äôs embarrassing that we don‚Äôt have it. But the ACA is a remarkable upgrade to the system we had before dealing with insurance companies alone. We have a better chance of getting there with Biden/Harris than Trump.
He's so jealous of Kamala n Biden!! #BlueWavesaComing
That‚Äôs not to say that we cannot build up on it. But you are much more likely to build upon the ACA with Joe Biden and a Democratic House and Senate with a progressive supreme court justice then you are with Trump‚Äôs FU Policy.
That is to say nothing of putting Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court and will be preparing to put more Kavanaughs on it. He has thrown napalm on the USPS. Voters have been disenfranchised. Biden wasn‚Äôt even in my top 10, but him and Trump are apples to hand grenades.
Yes I can.  Biden is part of the problem. We need to #DrawTheLine and stand for our principles.   #IWillNotFallInLine #NeverBidenNeverTrump
Me sitting in my car listening to lofi hip hop beats and tweeting about American politics with a half eaten Marcos pizza in my passenger seat:  fuck Biden
i like Kamala fine but my biggest fear is that this will BOTH 1) alienate a block of energized voters (blm protesters) AND 2) make voting FOR biden against Trump less paletable to the center-right (bc of her more explicit progressive policy platform and racism and misogyny)
Start dropping hints of major corruption scandal against Biden..then tweet about the coming announcement every day till election day
I‚Äôll believe it when I see it.  I‚Äôm not saying Biden won‚Äôt win, but I felt better about Clinton this time four years ago.  I‚Äôm still not entirely sure polls factor in people who usually never vote but voted for Trump in 2016
If you say defund the police and ACAB and then turn right around and vote for Biden/Harris you‚Äôre a joke. This whole election is a joke. The only way out of this is
"I've decided that Kamala Harris is the best person to help me take this fight to Donald Trump and Mike Pence and then to lead this nation starting in January 2021.‚Äù -Joe Biden   Kamala Harris is smart, capable and‚Ä¶
I‚Äôm actually thankful how many deep sighs the Biden campaign makes us have because it makes us mindful of our breathing and that‚Äôs healthy?
Biden choosing Kamala is dirt in the grave of legalized weed
I'll give Biden this, Kamala was probably a better choice than John Delaney!   Half of you might not know who that is üòâ
Wth? Biden who is clearly racist. Just listen to what he's said.. picks Harris as his VP! Playing the race card for black votes. What I can't understand is why it doesn't infuriate the black community? A white man using a black woman to advance hisself?
What the hell?? We have Biden who is clearly racist. Just listen to what he's said. He picks Harris as his VP! Playing the race card for black votes. What I can't understand is why it doesn't infuriate the black community? A white man using a black woman to get what he wants?

Under the Kamala-Biden regime there will be 3 types of prisons, those dedicated to criminals, those dedicated to blacks, and those dedicated to anarchists. Don't like it, leave.
Btw, this Dem Biden/Harris supporter has his guns loaded...
Was genius because no one in the radical left is voting for Biden, and it will turn off independents

I'm very pleased with Joe Biden's pick for a running mate. Kamala Harris is an intelligent and qualified candidate. #BidenHarris2020

If Biden didn‚Äôt pick Harris I would have been concerned, logical choice
I am gonna get a shirt too I am so much more excited about Joe Biden now. I just LOVE Kamala Harris so much!!!!!!! Cheers! BYE CON DON!
Biden/Harris may be the worst presidential ticket of all time. üòÇ

Biden/Harris for the win! Kamala Harris will mop the floor with Trump and Pence. #VPPick

I hope it's Harris for Biden's VP.
What a idiot worst president in history well maybe he would if he cheated him like he is trying to do with Biden
Same here. I liked Tammy for multiple reasons.   1. She‚Äôs young and if Biden is planning to be ‚ÄúThe Bridge‚Äú she would be perfect.  2. She‚Äôs got an unbelievable story that would resonate w/ which she represents.    3. Military. The contrast. She lost limbs serving. Trump dodged x5
oh his slide will start back up they just had a big infection party in my region.  i watch them ambulances drive by every night. i say byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
‚ÄúThe only way to prevent this scenario, is to deliver an election night lead to Biden. This means voting in person. No, not everyone will be able to do that. But if you plan to vote against Trump and can take appropriate precautions,
i just read on politicalwire they might ask if you can if you're brave if you believe it necessary to get in line to vote and not do mail in. to make sure biden wins on election night. i'm gonna do it. i hate the idea of getting the vid or possibly spreading it to someone myself.
I will be glad about whoever Biden picks at the nominee. I read a really articulate article as to why maybe Kamala Harris wouldn't want to be vice president. I just couldn't stand people attacking her, I support whoever it is, but seriously don't continue to be mean to Kamala.
Hmm China would prefer Joe Biden....of course they do!
Electing Biden only strengthens the corruption.
If Biden is a true, practicing Catholic, he must go to confession every few hours for promotion of abortion, lying, stealing, cheating, plagiarism, and so on and so forth. #whatacrock #BidenDementia
You did a fantastic job. I'm so sorry you and your husband and family are going through this. Just saw a Biden ad on Fox where a woman blamed President Trump for the loss of her family member.  Made me mad. You didn't place blame. You just want to be counted.
Mayor Pete would make an excellent chief of staff. Biden could take him under his wing.
And now listen to any sentence that Joe Biden has said recently and tell me how you think he could possibly debate Trump. The left really has no grasp on reality whatsoever.
Potus is a rock star, he comes right back out and gets the job done....could you imagine Biden, he would be whining in the corner.....wondering why he was being punished lol

i'll just let it be known in 2024 if kamala harris decided to primary joe biden i would support that. it would be so amazing and good for the world to have kamala harris in the white house. i believe india would be more receptive to a united states led by kamala harris.
i thought about that as well. biden may not pick kamala harris and maybe that's for the better anyways. being a senator puts her before an international audience. i may have switched back to the future is better off with kamala harris as america's senator.

Needs to work on its power scaling.  One minute Biden is weak and fragile then suddenly he‚Äôs challenging God.  Totally unbelievable.
New York (CNN)A bug in Instagram's algorithm systemically shielded Donald Trump from negative hashtags without doing the same for rival Joe Biden, the company confirmed.  ik it's true because in 2015 and 2016 i was prohibited from sending messages to friends/family on fb myself.
i still can't post on instagram &amp; facebook is just as bad.  think of all the family's who used the im service as a way of communicating. couple years it could stop even messaging each other. people would have died from this. it's very serious. diabetics
‚ÄúSleepy Joe Biden is in his basement to hide how frail and weak he is. He‚Äôs afraid to debate me because of his cognitive decline.‚Äù  ‚ÄúAlso Joe Biden will personally kill God in hand-to-hand combat.‚Äù
Kamala Harris support, encouragement, and push for a Biden presidency leads me to vote for Biden.
Biden could choose a flaming piece of crap and I‚Äôd still vote for him.  ‚ù§Ô∏è

This is in response to two recent letters to the editor in your paper. Apparently some people are still suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome or they are uninformed, misinformed or ignorant.
Look I don't like Trump but this man Biden don't even know what planet he's on
It‚Äôs good to know that Biden is in the hands of Wall Street. A moment of truth for the
So many rumors going around so many people in my town are being targeted by them Russian robots that I heard Joe Biden talking about. Spreading rumors and lies. It's just a bunch of imbred hick cousin fkrs.
I keep telling people that Owensby is gonna win as well between Yarmuth, Amy, Biden, Hicks and possibly even Swearengin in West Virginia that's a lot of good association. I honestly can not believe how Democrat it has become.  Which, it's hard and everything when they cut and cut
What do you propose once your in office? How will four years of Joe Biden bring us back from the brink? What are your big ideas?
6 years ago  Only if Biden had the opportunity to do anythi... oh wait
Well yeah they're pro-Biden right now though. They're supporting Biden and the Dems still don't see it as enough. I'm essentially saying the DNC is not giving a pass to a group just because they don't follow Liberal Orthodoxy
Eh I mean it wasn't really the network but plenty of people there were pro Biden. I don't watch much but the Twitter discourse is pretty pro Biden.   I just think it's fishy that a network that seemed at least mildly sympathetic to Biden is banned. Very fishy.
Wow. After all the Biden simping they still got denied. Rip.
Must be a Joe Biden Rally
this imbecile is saying Democrats are cheating,that the election can't be trusted, that Biden HATES god! Really! it's incredible.I'm not even interested in politics, only since traitor Trump got elected&amp;I can tell you what's going to happen!Racist can't have a leading party!
Isn't Biden too old to be a coach?
I agree Trump is trying to prevent our votes, I will crawl through a moat  of crocodiles, filled with broken glass,amidst swarming rabid bats to vote for Biden.
Joe Biden is a racist? Ok üëå Fucking unbelievable how you can get in slow this man‚Äôs heart and tell people what he believes. Reps. James Clyburn endorsed him over everyone else as did John Lewis who known him for 40 years, but they are too slow to notice his racism. GTFO.
Trump is a horrible human that only cares about himself and his salesman DNA makes you believe he's in it for you. Biden is way over the hill.
Trump is literally just throwing every key word he can think of our there in an attempt to attack Biden.  Trump is so dumb and, yet, his worshippers manage to be even dumber.  Fuck us, #amiright?
Trump stands on national TV and says Biden hates God! What kind of crap is that! Trump is making it really easy to vote and support Biden as a republican!
Is it a surprise that China (people of color) favors Biden and Russia (predominantly White) favors Trump? Their preferences merely align with the racial preferences of Americans.So it‚Äôs racist to say Obama‚Äôs policies were a fucking disaster? Get outta here lol. It‚Äôs ironic af your ‚Äúpulling it for Biden‚Äù aka racial jungle aka Anita Hill aka crime bill aka friends with segregationists   Your disdain for trump blinds you when it comes to Bidens 30 yr record
I will give you that Biden will be better than trump. But it‚Äôs nowhere near enough for it to be meaningfully different for people who have no money
It‚Äôs not disinformation that Biden has been heavily funded by fossil fuels most of his political career. Your blinded by your hatred of trump, that your turning into republicans and don‚Äôt even  know it
Joe Biden is king Fracker and heavily funded by fossill fuel industry. It‚Äôs cute that you think Joe Biden is gonna solve global warming lol
Today's reason I'm PUMPED to vote for Biden is because he'll reverse the public charge rule that Trump loves. This is a horrendous policy (essentially a wealth test) that prevents immigrants from becoming citizens just because they use SNAP or Medicaid.
And really, he‚Äôs proven himself. He isn‚Äôt a politician unlike Biden and crew and he loves America. Hillary loved Hillary. She wanted the glory nothing more... most of us....üòÇüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ good one
Biden stated some time ago that Trump will be "escorted" out by the military.  AKA: Dragged out kicking and screaming by the Marines.  Go ahead, Stephen Miller, interfere, make their day!
How about the postal union that endorsed Biden handling millions of ballots without bipartisan supervision?
When did Biden serve in the military?
So Biden is being used by his party? And he doesn‚Äôt care? Not much of a leader

how the fuck is Biden becoming President going to somehow disqualify AOC from running should she choose to do so? You know she‚Äôs insanely popular and that‚Äôs why she‚Äôs speaking at the convention as a FIRST TERM RERESENTATIVE, right?
I mean, yeah it is. But we got fucking close with Bernie, and the leftist movement in America is growing every day. If AOC or Nina Turner throws their hat in the ring, I‚Äôm pretty confident we could get them over the finish line, ya know, unless Biden becomes president.
It‚Äôs not to own the libs, it‚Äôs to give the left a chance at winning. So if Biden wins we‚Äôll get four years of him, four years of Kamala (imagine the smears against anyone who dares primary her) AND THEN most likely 4-8 years of a republican bc that‚Äôs just how this works.
Lmao now it‚Äôs my turn to ask if you‚Äôre arguing in bad faith. Are we really gonna ignore polling stations being closed bc they were ‚Äúunderstaffed‚Äù, 8 hour lines to vote, the suspicious vote counting app in Iowa, coordinated negative media coverage, and the simultaneous Biden...
3. I accept that four years of Trump is worse than four years of Biden however four years of Trump is not worse than perpetual neoliberalism therefore voting for Biden is about the worst thing a leftist could do (besides voting for Trump).
1. You‚Äôre mistaking me calling you an idiot for my reasoning to not vote for Biden, but I‚Äôll break that down too. The democrats will be as corporatist as they are able to and still win elections, that‚Äôs where the money is. The only thing they need from us is votes.
My not serious but kinda serious prediction:   After failed Biden presidency, we will get President Cotton in 2024 (or 28). Donald Trump, barely alive, will become an honorary member of le resistance democrats for his tweets insulting Cotton.

The idea that the DNC will capitulate to the left if we pledge them our votes but will move right if we don‚Äôt vote is the most bassackwards reasoning I‚Äôve ever heard. Biden is not a leftwing candidate, we know what his policies are, if neoliberalism is shown to be a winning...

This is what Vote Blue No Matter Who gets ya....if Biden wins, his incrementaism will give us Tom Cotton in 2024
He has to go. One more reason to vote for Biden
I honestly can't imagine anyone being as bad as Trump. Biden's campaign has also been shifting left little by little, when historically dem campaigns tend to drift toward the center. I think he sees an opportunity to make some bold policy on climate, healthcare, etc.
Joe Biden is a hardcore republican while Harris is center-right Republican.  No progressive agenda coming out of this admin and that‚Äôs straight from Biden‚Äôs mouth ‚Äúthings won‚Äôt fundamentally change‚Äù he told his 100 billionaire donors
Pushing Biden/Harris means progressives get shit on for 8 More years. Nah, I‚Äôd rather see the party burnt to the ground. Losing 1000 seats under Obama shoulda done away with liberalism
Simple as this...my life is no better nor no worse under Trump than it was under Obama. Obama/Biden 8 years of failed neoliberalism created the conditions that made Donald Trump possible. If Obama‚Äôs 8 years were so great, we wouldn‚Äôt have trump. Going back to Biden is doom
It helps me...the Democratic Party can‚Äôt be reformed. 2-3 progressive wins every cycle, we mite get there by 3000...many of us don‚Äôt have time to wait...we been trying y‚Äôalls way for like 30 yrs and look where that‚Äôs got us. Only hope is Biden drops dead before November

If Biden gets elected I‚Äôll bet you $1.00 that the Dems will at some point during his term say Biden is not mentally fit to be president and Harris becomes the first female president in history. This has to be their play,right?
Will you apologize to joe Biden for pushing the phony rape smear you and other dumdumleftists like the guy you quote tweeted pushed?

It was a debut of the duo Democrats believe can win back the White House ‚Äî and they think Sen. Kamala Harris gives Joe Biden just what he needs to ensure that.
Joe Biden is pulling the reverse Obama with Kamala. Obama picked Biden as VP to get the white racists on board. Now the white racist wants that favor returned by picking a black woman because, in Joe‚Äôs mind, all blacks will vote for a black woman on ticket. It‚Äôs tokenism
I‚Äôve got friends mad at my anti-Biden stance. To them I say that I‚Äôm pulling for Paula Jean Swearengin to take the WV Senate race and have a monthly donation set up with her campaign, and you should too.
Good luck to you Biden people. I hope the strategy of wooing suburban republicans works out, I really do.  I‚Äôd like to say I‚Äôm going to get blitzed every night for the next four years, but I‚Äôm losing my health insurance in two months, and your boy doesn‚Äôt give a fuck.
All I‚Äôm saying is that it‚Äôs hypocritical to vote for Biden if you have an issue with sexual predators being elected into office
Ummm you and Ryan grim are absolutely shameless. Both of you pushed the Biden smear. Disgusting and embarrassing.

Kamala Harris was on record last year saying she believed all of Biden‚Äôs victims. Politics are crooked
Joe Biden said he would defund the police. We can start there.

It‚Äôs Biden-Harris Day.  ‚ÄúThis is a moment to celebrate. It‚Äôs a moment for young women and young men to be able to see that any door is open to them. And I want to congratulate Senator Harris and VP Biden for this historic choice.‚Äù  eloquent thoughts on
was the best choice. Here's why Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris as his VP
can handle it! Kamala Harris' balancing act
I cannot help but see my immigrant parents' faces and the world they created for me in America out of nothing.  Grateful to them.  Grateful to Joe Biden for his choice.  After almost 4 years of shameful policies and ugly rhetoric about immigrants, I feel more hopeful today.  2/2
Chomsky‚Äôs take on voting for Joe Biden is exactly right. But let‚Äôs not kid ourselves, a Biden-Harris admin will do everything it can to placate and snuff out the activist energy that keeps primarying their friends. Must stay vigilant
Wut? Cenk you know better than this. Just because the voters wanted Biden doesn‚Äôt mean they didn‚Äôt want Kamala as VP.
That‚Äôs part of it. But if we‚Äôre being totally honest, it‚Äôs because Bernie‚Äôs team was so unbelievably incompetent. He raises sooooo much money and still got that ass whooped. Biden‚Äôs team were supergeniuses compared to Bernies lol
God I hope someone puts these "donations" (from him &amp; Ivanka) to Harris AND Biden in tv/media ads ASAP. It's one thing to have "given" to a former GOP candidate. But to have "given" to THE TWO you're now running opposite against - just PRICELESS!lol!
That kind of idiocy is what Trump takes advantage of by screaming that Biden is going to take God and religion away.
They're not even hiding it folks. The Radical DNC has no intention of letting him stay in office should he win. I said it earlier &amp; I'll say it again, they didn't pick Biden because he's the best they picked him because he's the weakest &amp; easiest to replace! #VoteDemsOut
So you finally admit that Biden is not fit for the job and Harris who polled at 2% wasn‚Äôt wanted for the job so democrats and #FakeNews are trying to install her as President!
If Biden/Harris is the best we can come up with to oppose Trump, we fucking deserve Donald Trump

When they stack the deck, one way to send a message is not to vote for their shit candidates. Look who they‚Äôve run ‚Äî Gore, Kerry, Hillary, Biden
When Joe Biden is asked why he chose Kamala Harris I bet his answer will be because Kamala is appealing to the Latino &amp; Indigenous voters in America. You know because she's part Jamaican &amp; Indian.  I'm telling you he has NO CLUE!  #BidenHarrisDisaster

Voting green. I will disparage Biden and Harris because they are just as detrimental to the working class, for which I am a part of, as Trump is. (See greatest transfer of wealth from bottom to the top under Biden/Obama)
I was going to write in Bernie Sanders in November, but his shilling for billionaire bought Biden/Kamala has pushed me away. I will absolutely 100% be voting for Howie Hawkins  because he‚Äôs never raped and offers medicate for all + green new deal. Eat my ass democrats
Because Biden has a stutter and t-Rump is stoopid?
I agree. I‚Äôm saying between trump and Biden, I legit believe with Trump we‚Äôre gonna be dealing with this shit another two years.
*sigh* Obama built the cages, and Biden has spent his career trying to gut social security. Also let‚Äôs not pretend that Biden doesn‚Äôt say something racist every other interview.
Because they went to joe Biden to beat trump, that‚Äôs obvious. As for your latter question, ask me in 4 years. After AOC has more experience and I‚Äôve seen how Kamala runs the country from behind the scenes.
Kamala Harris is now conveniently embracing the #YouAintBlack &amp; #YouAintDiverse Joe Biden but those of us with our own brains remember when she tore him up for all the "Racist Policies" he helped create over his 47 year political Career.  #PhonyKamala
They‚Äôre not in the majority. Maybe in the party apparatus they are, but not the average voter. Most voters voted for Biden because he is a great matchup for Trump. And it‚Äôs my guess black voters knew he‚Äôd pick Kamala Harris.
Karen Bass wasn‚Äôt vetted as well. And as I‚Äôve posited from even several months ago...it was always gonna be Kamala, from the moment she dropped out. (Although I was one of few who already knew Biden was gonna win the nom by that point)
Please explain to me what kinda change I‚Äôm getting that will positively affect my life under Biden? Voting for billionaires doesn‚Äôt help the working class no matter which party is in charge.
Yes. Kamala is far more well known than tim kaine. Kamala helps him and if Biden wins I‚Äôll be proven right and Kyle will take another L since at this point he‚Äôs obviously rooting for Trump to beat Biden.

I agree Biden is easier to be manipulated. BUT who is he being manipulated by? Bernie Sanders? Nope. 103 billionaires who despise the working class? OF COURSE! If Joe Biden has any intentions of going left, he would have picked a progressive as VP instead of Copmala
You all seriously going to ignore the fact that Kamala Harris thinks Joe Biden is a rapey groper?
Biden's VP Pick: What Republicans have to say about Kamala Harris
I don‚Äôt know anyone personally whose lives are financially better off under Obama/Biden than trump. Personally, is the same and is gonna be the same until we guillotine the billionaire bribe takers within the party

I‚Äôm walking the walk with my vote. Fuck Biden. Fuck Copmala, FUCK Trump. btw, if I had unionization for Walmart in my Bio, I‚Äôd be fired tomorrow. I have to work at Walmart cuz bill Clinton shipped all the jobs overseas. Fuck the billionaire loving democrats bro
Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) said she believes and respects the women who have come forward alleging that former Vice President Joe Biden touched them without their consent.
This reads like someone making fun of people voting for Biden.
They aren‚Äôt gonna improve under 4 years of trump just as they aren‚Äôt under 8 years of Biden/Harris. In fact, 8 years of Biden/Harris will SLOW progress for poor people. Must destroy the party so the working class can take it back over. That‚Äôs what I vote for.
YES!! She will be a great VP and a great ally for Mr. Biden AND the Country! November 3rd...Please hurry and get here so we can end our country's worst nightmare!!
Planet was just as fucked under Frackin‚Äô Joe, min wage never raised under Biden/Obama, Biden/Obama started the kids in cages and exploded mass deportation. Love how y‚Äôall just forget his record because orange man bad
I do think Joe Biden is a better representative and leader. I dont agree with all his policy but I think he's a safer choice to return us to some level of normalcy. Trump is too hated man. People will always rebel against him
The DNC rigged the primary- that‚Äôs why Bernie lost. I‚Äôm not voting for corrupt republicans who pose as democrats sorry. My life ain‚Äôt changing for the better under a Biden presidency. 2008-16  compared to 2016-20 is the proof
I voted for Biden in the primary. I also knew from the jump he was gonna pick Kamala. And Yang endorsed Biden.
I was really hoping Joe Biden would die before he picked a VP. There REALLY is no God
Now do the reactions from poor people who won‚Äôt see a bit of change wether it‚Äôs trump or Biden. Pretty sure we outnumber rich people and celebs
Trump/Biden- no healthcare, no raising of minimum wage, no UBI, no green new deal, no marijuana legalization, etc...For poor people, Biden and Trump ARE THE SAME.

What‚Äôs at stake? Biden is only SLIGHTLY better than Trump. But when you make less than 75k a year, there‚Äôs literally no difference. Biden is OWNED by billionaires so thinking Biden gonna do what‚Äôs in MY best interest is delusional. Biden is a republican- no thanks
* 8million x worse for everyone but esp anyone who isn‚Äôt rich, white, straight, cis, disabled, christian... I could go on &amp; on. It really doesn‚Äôt matter what we think of this pick. Now isn‚Äôt the time to shit all over her. This is the ticket &amp; Biden winning is just too important.
Joe Biden is not just building a bridge to the future.  He just built a super highway.

In terms of potential VP, I think ppl get too hopeful that she could persuade Biden on enough of her positions that those positions would become the official WH stance. I don't think that's incredibly likely, and as VP she won't be in a position to publicly push further left.

We aren‚Äôt Bernie fans you moron. We are a fan of working class policies. If we were ‚Äúfans‚Äù, Biden would be getting more than the 5% of Bernies grassroots donors since Bernie has endorsed HIS friend. Not our friend, but HIS.
You are totally right.  has been the #libertarian party for nearly 2 months and the democrats still don't have an officially nominated candidate. Jo should probably take Biden's spot. It is too late for him to join. #LetHerSpeak
