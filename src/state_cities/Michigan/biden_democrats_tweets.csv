Hell, we aren’t safe in Trump’s America either. I’ll take my chances with Biden.
Joy I’m loving the idea of President Pelosi if Donald mess up the election. I think he would rather Biden win. 🤣🤣
Frump is a sorry excuse for a Commander in Chief! We need Joe Biden to lead our Country back to prosperity. 🇺🇲👍🏾🌊🌊
I’m getting so many texts from both parties (which is what happens when you’ve voted Republican AND Democrat over the course of nearly 20 some years). I wish “please stop texting me” worked. Trump’s party is very demanding via text. Biden’s side is more pleading, but polite.
Biden is a way better person than tRump will ever be so get over it. He’s a born looser!!!
A lot of Biden’s allies seem intent on making an anti-Trump election into a validation of what the left base wants, which Biden has smartly shied away from. The question will be whether Trump continues blundering around so it doesn’t matter or not.
No, it's just leaked to get your exact reaction. Let's just be cool and wait for the decision. Obama didn't choose Biden until mid-August.
It’s going to be Nikki Haley. Trump’s campaign is circling the bowl and he’ll figure that selecting a woman of color will neutralize Biden’s advantage with women and minorities. Trump doesn’t need Pence, anyway. Trump already has the racist religious bigot vote locked up.
Ironically texting everyone 👍after Biden on that livestream has inevitably led to just doing it
Check Biden’s website for detailed proposals. Have you heard any plans from Agent Orange about what he plans to do with his second term?
What are the chances that  squeals on #NobodyLikesTrump before dersh gets sent to jail and subsequently Epsteined?
Yeah, probably after Biden picks his VP but before the conventions (or when the conventions would have happened and whatever they're doing now)
They just figured out that saying Biden was the president of antifa wasn’t gonna do it
Biden might actually win.
Sorry. I guess I'm just used to people slamming Biden being Trump supporters. I can't defend everything Biden says, but right now, he's the lesser of two evils.
Nonsense. Biden wins it’s over.
To those who keep bringing up Biden's gaffes as a defense: Joe could say he comes from the planet Blobbo where the currency is peeled grapes and everyone rides around on space capybaras and I'll STILL vote for him. Just like you'll defend whatever batshit insane thing Trump says.
So when I see an ad that says you're doing a good job I should think about the lower drug prices we'll get under President Joe Biden? Sure thing!
What's sad is that people support Trump at all. Say what you want about Biden, Trump is 100x worse.
Bernie is actually on record saying that “if Joe Biden wins the election, he will be the most progressive president we’ve ever had”.
Sorry, but Trump has to go. Historically I'm a 3rd party voter, but not this time. I cannot stand by and watch my country get destroyed at such a ridiculously rapid pace. When Biden get's in, we can work together to pressure him for change. Trump pays attention to nobody.
2/3 Obama Biden Holder spied on the Press; has to apologize to Germany/Merkel - MSM had Obama Biden adm spying throughout 8 yrs - O/B historical view is a PATTERN OF SPYING and violating The Constitution + working to overthrow Israeli PM
why is anyone surprised that Obama Biden spied in an Oppo party and Presidency of  - their entire 8 years was shown to be at its core spying eg c Clapper lied to America via Congress re Spying on All Americans; AP, Rosen/family; Congressional Committees; Merkel1/3
Stop being dramatic, every single poll I've seen shows a majority of Bernie supporters voting for Biden.
Many people did what you propose in 2016, look at what we got. Now is not the time to waste a vote on someone who can’t possibly win. This really is a 2 man race. We need our country to heal. While Biden may not be perfect, he’ll at least respect the constitution.
Less than 100 days to vote for Joe Biden #WeWillVote
No worries. I will drop my vote by mail ballot off at my local clerk’s drop box to make sure my vote for Biden is counted.
I can see this coming Nov 4th!  Trump declares he is still acting president forcing his rule even  after losing to Biden.   Trump will declare Biden’s presidency as illegitimate and urge new elections!!! Country will fray at the seams.  Who agrees?
And Biden didn’t?
Swing state no more, Michigan is voting for Joe Biden! Ride the blue wave home.🌊🌊🌊🇺🇲✊🏾💪🏾🙏🏾
There's a better than 50-50 chance that Biden is just a delayed Democratic version of HW.
I hate to break it to you all, but if a white dude would seal the deal for Biden, he'd be picking the white dude. The VP pick is solely a pick for political purposes with the secondary that they might be president someday, though based on history, they probably won't.
The best part about the speculation about Biden’s VP deliberation is the near anger from liberal commentators that Biden actually intends to be president rather than an empty vessel that gives a leg up for 2024 to one of his challengers
It’s annoying because it’s going to be portrayed by our presentist media (with a handful of presentist historians) as being true when it’s pretty much the opposite. It isn’t a man vs woman thing. This pretty much defines the VP. It’s just liberals wish Biden wasn’t the nominee.
Would love to read an interview with a voter who's still sitting on the fence at this point and hinging his or her vote on Biden's VP pick.
Proud Detroit Suburbanite for Biden. Also, not afraid of low-income housing destroying my “American Dream” #SuburbsForBiden #detroitwillbreathe #detroitworksharder
Watching television in #Michigan just got a whole lot better
No it's the Democrats whose base is dwindling. Democrats see all of this senseless violence on TV and are afraid of it. If Biden somehow cheats his way into the White House the police will be eliminated, taxes will rise and unemployment will skyrocket.
It's funny how you Democrats never talk about Biden and what he plans to do. I guess he hasn't been told yet by the DNC?
Elizabeth Warren attacked Biden over his politics as well but I don’t see people yelling about how she’s too ambitious and will only use him to become president. Why is that, exactly? Did she do it the right way or something?
For the record, Elizabeth Warren directly attacked Biden about his politics but I don’t see a bunch of his allies saying she’s potentially going to backstab him  It’s almost like a bunch of white people are mad about a black woman who doesn’t just settle for being the help
It was a bill Obama and Biden had in place that Trump ended and has resurfaced. I agree with the latter.   Just providing context.
They take him around like they just picked him up from the COVID senior citizen home #Biden #elderlycare #Pedowood #election
Last I checked, Obama and Biden bombed seven countries, invaded Libya illegally and furthered wars in many places. It’s time to bring everyone home and end the incessant wars. The 90s called. They want your unnecessary fear of the Russian boogeyman back.
Don’t stop for one minute. Work for Biden like he is 10 points down. We have to bury the orange menace.
Way more Biden ads over the last week in MI. When you take 45 plus days to address an emergency (dam breaks), you’re going to lose support. I bang remember the last time I saw a trump lawn sign unlike Biden signs on every other block.
Biden's sitting there like "what a fool! Everyone knows you can't actively undermine the poor. You have to do it with euphemisms by attacking charity over unrelated culture war issues and banning charter schools/school choice"  Trump: "What do you guys think of debtor's prisons?
Trump holds another ego filled, rant, spewing his normal dangerous, emotional BS &amp; propaganda so the big crybaby can make himself out to be the “poor, weak, pathetic victim”.  Incompetency &amp; denial at the highest level during a pandemic.America deserves so much better. Vote Biden
In trump’s America. But he’s going to project it onto VP Joe Biden, who hasn’t held office in four years.
Biden most likely does have some type of disorder. I wish I could prove to you how wrong you are about Trump, though. Smart people shouldn't need to brag about "acing" a cognitive test. You're confusing his political instincts with business instincts, which are also terrible.
This is a perfect example of biased mainstream media. They tell you who to vote for when it comes to public office. Donald Trump, Joe Biden, AND Jo Jorgensen are running for President. Jorgensen is the BEST candidate BY FAR, but CNN disagrees. #JoJorgensen2020 #VoteLibertarian
Next year, when the Biden Administration is in place and the GOP no longer controls the Senate, there need to be explicit laws put in place criminalizing the exact conduct of this travesty of an Administration from start to finish so this never happens again.
Sounds like you want Biden?
Ask Gates Biden wrong on every foreign issue
...Hmmm... does have the capability of knowing when he's not wanted...m
And Joe Biden's VP pick is... Raj Bhakta?!
The fake quote from Biden is such a perfect example of how the media thinks West Wing is real life.
Honestly immunity from religion isn’t bad.
I don't think this will be true. No one is going to want to be opposed by the president from their party in a primary. Biden probably won't play as much in the primaries, though.
Video: Frank Luntz Urges Joe Biden to Pick Karen Bass as Running Mate   Luntz bias is pathetic
I wish that BLM and Biden would condemn their folks' violent means to make us less racist. The IRA renounced violent means to achieve unity on this day in 2005.
Which we will do when we vote your dangerous &amp; deadly ass out and vote for Biden in November(by absentee ballot, returned by hand to county office).
Sometimes I don't even know. With any luck, Biden is a stop gap... but... you're right, the potential is there for something awful.
If we can't pressure Biden and the DNC to support m4a now, when they need our votes, why would anyone believe we can pressure them after the election, when they don't need our votes?
What an angry, uptight person you must be. You couldn't be happy with all the great things he has done in just barely 4 years? Best president we have been lucky enough to get. Just watch our great country  crumble underneath a socialist president if we are cursed with Biden.
Wall St knows Trump is a loser like everybody else so they are supporting Biden cause he is smart and cares about this country.
Biden is not special your right but unfortunately he’s what this country needs right now for 1 term to get us out of the pandemic, get us out of the recession (which him and Obama did before), and get everything back to normal. Theirs bigger things in the US than conspiracy today
Dear don, this is happening in trump’s America. VP Biden hasn’t held office in almost 4 years. Are you sure you passed that cognitive test   ?
You can do that by getting out of office and let Biden take over...your trash as a president...let’s fix the economy together starting with you retiring to mar-I-lago Florida and letting  take over come on make America great again #TrumpIsALoser
Joe Biden is not special but he’s more special than trump..did you see any campaign commercials he is still talking shit to trump. Clearly trump is exposing himself the world already in a bad way. Trump has shown his own racism to the world and shown he don’t care about Americans
I've learned a spell that will help defeat Trump Biden will win, make Don look like a chump So gather 'round and listen real close... Azarath, Metrion, Zinthos
I just find it interesting how Non black leftist are so selective when discussing“problematic” scholars,oh and sense y’all seem very dedicated to making it seem like Dr Davis got on live tv and professed her love for Biden here’s what she 𝘼𝘾𝙏𝙐𝘼𝙇𝙇𝙔  said.
There is an irony to this - can you imagine being working on his campaign and hearing him say that? Wish I were there to see their faces. I wold not put it on my resume. Worked on Biden Campaign- the nurse breathed into it trying to make it live!
Romney gained huge ground, Biden saved the campaign, Trump absolutely sealed the deal with lots of voters in the Midwest
You Know...I wish Michelle Obama would run w/Biden..She would Bring ppl out &amp; they will be lined up to vote like they are buying concert tickets. Susan Rice has many yrs of experience also. She will help Joe enormously!!
Where is  and the millions he promised to give to get Biden elected?
Come on! DO NOT LET TRUMP WIN! If you were for Bernie, you should be for Biden!
Biden should only agree to debate him 60 days after Trump makes a full public disclosure of his taxes.
There are some things I disagree with but I can’t in good conscience vote for trump or Biden ,
Today,  announced his agenda for women. I'm pretty excited about it, and you can see my full thoughts below.   Check out his agenda here:
China, Iran and other despots need Biden. American and the rest of the free world need  Southfield, Michigan needs #Trump2020
They’re treating it like a game show, which I’d expect from trump. Biden is better than that
Never heard of that and any info I’ve found on it doesn’t imply it is. Now go call Harris a cop elsewhere, because I’m sure you’re part of that camp.  After leftists felt themselves calling AA voters in the south who voted for Biden dumb and low info y’all have no moral ground
I love that you consider Biden the radical left. 😂😂😂
Media will not call out Biden on any of his or his campaign or surrogates lies. That gives him quite an advantage!!
The reason she’s being targeted is because she’s a strong black woman who isn’t kowtowing to anyone. Elizabeth Warren went for Biden’s jugular too but I don’t see a bunch of white people wanting her launched into the sun
Almost 14 months later and y’all weak asses still can’t get over this. And why doesn’t Elizabeth Warren get this same heat for her criticisms of Biden?
Ah yes, lets suppress the voters who actually support Biden. Do you even hear yourself?
Attacking Biden on foreign policy would involve Trump having a consistent, semi-coherent foreign policy.
Agreed but who will help us the most right now? That answer is Biden plus he is only good for 1 term....economy wise we’re fucked, healthcare wise fucked, covid wise fucked, education wise Betsy Devos (really fucked), 😂🤦🏾‍♂️😂 black owned business (we went from 1.1 Million to 647K)
I cannot fathom how anyone can't see that Biden is a Trojan Horse. If he won he would not be  running the Presidency.
Every time I see a Biden commercial I throw up in my mouth a lil bit
Vision:  Biden choose Michael Obama.  If they win, doubtful, Biden becomes diagnosed with Dementia.  Michael becomes President.  Chooses Hilary as Vice.  There goes the neighbourhood.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Pence is an obedient lapdog. And just use it to position himself in 2024, against Pres. Biden and/or whomever may take the baton.
"Retired" politicians younger than Trump and Biden is one of my favorite games. In addition to the obvious George W. Bush and Barack Obama, you have Quayle, Gore, Dean, Braun, Engler, Whitman.
Ms. Rice, I expect to see you in the White House as the VP having a discussion with President Biden.
She's not going to be the nominee after posting this super unflattering picture of Joe Biden.
our pundit, and many of Biden’s campaign strategists, will have a difficult time conceiving that religious identity has the potential to trump racial identity if the former is perceived to be under threat. Campaigns lose when they miss movement. That’s Biden’s biggest liability
Won't he be dragged out by the same secret service that was tasked with keeping him safe because that same secret service will now be tasked with keeping Biden safe?
U r really going to callout Biden 4a verbal error Mr. “I draw on maps 2 cover my ignorance” &amp;don’t care if people lose their lives or jobs. I have 2 cover up my stupidity&amp;blame others every time I’m an idiot. Mr. Don’t Wear Mask because liberals r only doing it 2 make me look bad
Biden has Wall St. and the corporations. It's kind of in insulting for him ask for our money. I have vote for him but he can fuck right off if he thinks I'm gonna finance centrism.
I said it’s unlikely he’ll win, if he does, it’ll be because they did, I think. Biden has been pretty awful on religious freedom from govt interference. I’m sure Trump will hammer him on it the way he hammered Hillary on trade.
But he didn’t say that  He said he wants to beat Biden off, which...I mean I guess some people are into old squinty eyed white guys? 🤔
Biden and Trump seem to have major differences in how they conceive religious liberty. Biden sees it as a security issue, Trump sees it as a freedom of conscience issue. That’s the kind of difference that can drive votes
Remember when Kampala called Joe Biden racist? Weird how that doesn’t matter now that she has a chance at VP?
3/3  Durham must interview Obama Biden Rice Yates Comey Brennan Clapper Strozk Page and why is Wray still not being transparent w docs -he needs to be Replaced    GOP needs to stand w our Pres

JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Is this woman on crack? Joe Biden is hardly a racist.  #MSNBC
Agreed! We have to work as though Biden is behind. Never make assumptions!
Agreed! Voters who want health care should vote for Joe Biden!
I think you have a cute nose team biden
Bernie beat Hillary in Michigan in 2016 head to head. Biden beat Bernie in every single county in Michigan in 2020. He is far more popular here than Hillary ever was.  And this is coming from someone who voted for Bernie this year.
You have been watching the videos and they are such peaceful people, burning, looting, destroying property. People injured, weapons brandished- either you are delusional like Biden or simply evil.
2/2 Maria bring bk Lindsay he talks a good game, but very little movement on Obamagate - he promised and is not delivering - Rubio took over other Chair and has done nothing  should be livid at Wray who is still withholding docs and AG saying Obama Biden won't be looked at

Yes, very good Ad. Vote for Joe Biden!
Somebody please! Trying to troll Biden and ain’t even legit!
I'm voting BLUE Chaz. No doubt about it. In fact tomorrow I'm going to fill out my absentee ballot for August 4th. And drop it off or mail it. I haven't decided which one will piss off Trump the most. Voting absentee mailing it in. But anyhow GO BIDEN GO BLUE.
Biden will crime less
The Liberty Daily – The Conservative Alternative to the Drudge Report  share Tweet w AG Barr- Durham Must go where facts evidence leads - this means he must interview everyone at that meeting Yates Obama Biden Comey etc -this was a Coup 1/2
I will never forget my favorite President, The amazing, smart, empathetic, hard working, strong, healthy, fit Obama. That is why I am voting for his right hand man Biden in November.
he should of voted for biden.
Watch “Joe Biden Calls Trump The ‘First’ Racist President” on YouTube It’s either dementia or stupidity. Maybe both 🤷🏾‍♂️
I was sickened to read that the Michigan Police Officers Union is endorsing Trump. This means you endorse police brutality, white supremism, racism, misogyny and treason. You also lied about Biden and Obama in the press article, welcome military equipment. Extremely disappointed.
Biden will be too busy cleaning up the idiot’s mess.
Ironically, you just described Hunter Biden perfectly!
Who, Trump? Please don't say Biden touches kids inappropriately?! 😰😡
Common Mark. This is the result of Democrats trying to create mayhem. It's life imitating art. Same plot Senator Palpatine used to usurp the power to become Emperor. This time his name isn't Palpatine... It's Biden
Susan Rice, Perhaps An Unlikely Contender, Lands On Biden's VP Shortlist
I was attempting to explain why only 68% of college students are voting Biden, and Bernie supporters that refuse to vote Biden certainly would explain it.

It would be strategic if Biden released his VP pick during the RNC so the major networks had something else to cover.
At a time with COVID-19, every American needs health care and health insurance! Trump has tried to take away all the health insurance gains from Affordable Care Act. Vote Biden!
You are missing the point of the video, rather than critique Biden. Just saying.
You are so delusional. This is what is happening right now under dictator Trump! Don't twist it and say this is what would happen under Biden or anyone else.40,000 #WarrenDemocrats raised 1.5 million for Joe Biden today.
I’m getting so many texts from both parties (which is what happens when you’ve voted Republican AND Democrat over the course of nearly 20 some years). I wish “please stop texting me” worked. Trump’s party is very demanding via text. Biden’s side is more pleading, but polite.
Yes yes Biden equals socialism and communism poverty and violence and terrorism
Joe Biden says that we have a "crimate clises".  I think he's right...
Not true because Trump will be out of office. The truth is Trump is the reason for the protests. Biden will speak to the concerns of the people not send in troops to dominate like we're communist China.
Another Biden nut case!
Donald Trump’s October surprise is going to be a deep fake of Joe Biden saying something horrific and there’s just nothing we can do about it
Our country currently faces many challenges.  Joe Biden is not the answer to any of them.
Joe Biden says that we have a "crimate clises".  I think he's right...
Biden wrote the tough on crime bill which created the mass incarceration situation. He also wrote the Patriot act. The war on drugs, as well as the drastic reduction in rights over the past 20 years, is a direct result of his legislature.
A little off topic I believe the trump rally’s Biden rally’s need to end along with protesting it’s just to dangerous with the pandemic going on to be doing that stuff trumps rally over a dozen people had tested positive
Tim.   Biden doesn’t know what his policies are yet.  He doesn’t have to do any thinking.  Whatever the corporate interests tell him to do he will.  Sad this man is the better of 2 options.  If these candidates were goods sold at market the companies would go bankrupt
Biden might actually win.
After 4 years of Biden’s tax cut republicans will want to end that. How do they convince voters a tax cut for them is a bad thing.  Who of you reading this couldn’t use 7500 a year fed tax cut?  How many middle class gop voters you know will vote 7509 away from themselves?
Folks.  I have been extremely critical of Biden for months.  I will not disrespect this page or it’s mission.  I have an Idea that would almost assure Democrats control all 3 branches of government for 50 years.  I want to try it out on this page to see what your think
Joe Biden say that we have a "crimate clises".  I think he's right...

And I don’t want to shame anybody but seriously you are telling everybody vote and you go into this whole but this is as good as we are going to get we shouldn’t question or demand more we just got to suck it up and vote for Biden because we got to take out Trump. 🙄No wonder
I mean this whole settling for less shit isn’t going to cut it everybody should be demanding that Biden and his team do better do something more beyond just giving us a story or a vague speech.
I have a serious question so say Biden wins and Trump/his team is out what comes next so far what i hear is very vague. Okay you are going build back better so how are the Dems going to take back the house from the Republicants. Cause so far Joe isn’t for progressive policies
President Biden I don’t expect you’d have time anyway since you’ll be busy cleaning up the ENORMOUS mess the current idiot &amp; his minions have made!! Love you Sir!! We the People are here with you, standing by you, &amp; supporting you through &amp; through because we know you will do IT!
Joe Biden say that we have a "crimate clises".  I think he's right...
But Biden is definitely the lesser of the 2 evils and we have to pick one if we pick none we risk trump winnin
Yep! It’s exhausting just saying anything positive about Biden or anyone else outside of the GOP hate machine. Good luck and have fun. #VoteByMail #Vote #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #LoveIsEssential #Peace #KindnessMatters
I admit Obama care needed reforming as it wasn’t fair for certain individuals but Obama saved the country most Americans aren’t educated enough but research quantum easing Biden is the lesser of the 2 evils he’s the best hope we can have believe me I much rather feel the bern
I mean yes the dnc fucked him over but Obama personally called and asked Bernie to drop out cause we need to unite against a common cause and if you listen to any of bernies words at any rally’s he started with each rally it’s not about me winning or Biden it’s about taking down
Some PAC is running an ad about Biden 40yrs ago talking about his education. Not a good road for Bonespurs. Since Biden may not have been accurate but he didn’t buy his way into school
As Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden continues to gain support, wealthy taxpayers should consider taking advantage of the current estate and gift tax exemptions before it’s too late. Learn more:  #TaxAdvisors
where is Biden’s test results?
Too late to find a better candidate so you rather the suffering continue with trump? With this belief you might as well change your bio to “I’ll be supporting trump cause im sure as hell not supporting Biden”
You’re not a democrat if you vote for trump if you do and think your a democrat you’re not educated trump is too far right to have any democratic beliefs Biden is a moderate democrat in the middle which means he will have republicans and democrats on his side good luck
Im voting for Biden I refuse to let my children suffer with Donald trump as president. Global warming isn’t a myth people are all over the streets of Michigan holding help me signs with their kids 5 6 years old no help from the president only tax cuts its time to end this shit
I wanted Bernie so bad I went to all his rally’s when I heard Obama asked Bernie to step down I was so mad but now it’s time to put others before myself we can’t allow trump to win and not voting for Biden will pave the way for Donald trump
The people who don’t vote for Biden will condemn many others to death suffering standing on corners begging for food and shelter cause trump and republicans wanna cut their income if you aren’t gonna vote for yourself think of those suffering biden wasn’t my first pick either
Biden is like we need to grow and open the country well then if he believes that why is he against pushing and fighting for basic fucking needs like housing, healthcare, canceling student loans, etc etc?
I'm going to level with you in this. Biden was not my 1st, 2nd, or even 4th choice, but he's the nominee. I will not only HAPPILY and ENTHUSIASTICALLY vote for Biden, but I will continue to share and donate and do whatever I can to help ensure he is elected
Joe Biden is not the answer to any of the problems that we as a country face today.
This shit is just sad this lady obviously has issues and is all over the place I noticed that on her IG.  This is why It was crazy seeing people canceling Buttar without hearing out the whole story all while Khive and Biden supporters who talked so much
I actually think he's got a point abt hidden voters:  lots of Trump cultists might want to answer Biden in polls to skew data, others know that they're racist and are ashamed to admit it with acknowledging their admiration of DT
#Biden is not capable to be President and that is extremely scary.  We don’t need a puppet as a leader but someone who can implement their own ideas.
Absolutely correct. Biden nerds to hammer 🔨 that home. We've either lost a Family member  or we know someone who's died. This isn't a joke. This guy is still golfing it off, as if it will go away. Sick!
Should say ‘Dems self destruct’. Biden allies move to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president
Joe Biden says we're having a "crimate clises".  I think he's right...
Sep 15 - on the first presidential debate Trump will completely destroy Biden  Oct - Democrats will release some Nasty video from Trump's past  Poll numbers will show landslide victory for Biden  Nov 3 - Trump will win all the battleground States&amp; we will see a meltdown on TV😉🤞🏼
The argument against Harris is that she was a terrible primary candidate, did no homework on health care, CA is not a swing state and Senate Democrats have been absolutely useless in pandemic.  Biden needs a virus fighter like Whitmer of MI.
That is exactly why Biden was a Corporate puppet for 50 years.  He sucks at many things but grass routes fund raising is top of the list. He does and votes exactly how the corporate puppet masters order him to. Then they pay his re-election bills for screwing the working class.
Joe Biden has his work cut out for him in 2021
Biden will undo this on day one.
All he needs is a harmonica
According to #Democrat  women can not succeed unless he is elected President   #tcot #gop #migop
That Instagram account for Biden I have a feeling is run by Warren people.
Are people supposed to ignore that Biden is doing very little to earn their vote are they supposed to ignore thar the party just voted down on progressive policies like M4A, legalizing marijuana and against Palestine. I mean seriously do they think people are this naive?
Settle for Biden is a joke. Gtfoh. The instagram is ridiculous who is this made for how does this make Biden appealing knowing that he won’t even support progressive policies.
LOL. No Biden will not do that.  Please don’t tell me that you think your supporters are so stupid as to believe these lies. How disrespectful you are. What they should believe is: #TrumpDeathCount150000 #TrumpPandemicFailure
Why use photoshopped pictures of Joe Biden being a creep when there's already a bunch of actual pictures/videos of him being a creep?
Wow they are really desperate to get people to vote for Biden knowing he is a fucking disaster.
Biden is in no way a fucking leftist you fucking clown.
Have you heard Biden speak ?
If your a Biden supporter your a  pedophile.
Bernie really should stop defending the party after all the shit they did to him and honestly fuck Biden Obama and the DNC for ruining this election.
He is all talk. Biden’s basement buddy
How come no presidential candidate offers a solution to reduce our addiction to cars? Biden's proposed support for EVs sounds enviro-friendly, but doesn't deal with traffic congestion or pedestrian/bicycle safety. Trump wants us all driving Buicks from the 50s.

Biden ads say he's going to "Restore the middle class" but, seriously, what does that even mean? It's just as nonsensical as "Make America great again." So much meaningless rhetoric, yet people eat it up like free shrimp during happy hour.
This is such nonsense. Today, Warren Democratics have been sharing a link for a fundraiser happening Friday to support Joe Biden. Of course we’re going to vote for Joe, he’s adopted half of Warren’s plans.
Look around you. There's nothing Biden can do yet
Biden and the Dems have a plan to set us back instead of moving forward and actually doing something for this planet and its people.
Thanks. I'm with you. I'd hoped for someone else but it's the hand we're dealt. We can deal with 4 years of Biden but we won't survive 4 more years of this.
Let's get this straight. I'm not in love with Biden any more than I was with Hillary but I would literally vote for a block of cheese before I would EVER vote for Trump and not voting is not an option. Even if trump were a good president(he's not), he's exhausting.
As far as sleepy joe Biden goes I would start mentioning how anyone can vote for a guy who last minutes his VP. Very unprofessional and is not very presidential at all. Ask him what his plan besides plagiarizing yours on what he would do to contain the China vir.
Is Biden going to pick #HeelsUpHarris for his flunkie?
I’m not a fan of ACA. Highest priced to consumer plan on earth. We also pay more for prescriptions than any other country.  I could go on and on all night but you this is true. Nobody on earth has a valid argument against these facts. Biden is a pimp
They are supposed to be Corporate assholes on the right. The reason I’m voting for them is we nominated a corporate owned puppet too.  Trump may destroy Wall Street and Big Banking. He might end the ACA money grab.  Biden will do exactly what the puppeteers order him to.
You should have called and I could have driven with my new Biden Bumper sticker.
Here’s the thing. If Trump wins in November I’ll be bereft because I apparently don’t understand my fellow Americans. Again. But I’ll accept it. If Biden wins and Trump refuses to leave office, I’ll probably lose my mind. And move to France. If they’ll take me.
I really like Duckworth. I feel like Rice, like it or not, will have the stupid unmasking baggage.  I’m a bit more excited for who Biden’s AG will be. They’ll be busy day 1.
I'm not a big fan of Donald Trump as President...but I do know this...the answer to any problem we are facing as a country is not Joe Biden.
According to Joe Biden we have a "crimate clises".  I think he's right...
Kind of like Joe Biden telling that black guy that he's not really black.  Welcome to Woke America 2020 where things only make sense if you smoke enough crack.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot  IT IS TIME TO FLUSH THE TURD #TrumpMustGo #FlushTheTurdNov3rd
UNBELIEVABLE isn't it. Besides Repunlican questions did Barr ever anwser a dem ? They cut him short. This was about Trump, almost like a campaign rally for Biden
Corporate interests own the DNC and their worthless Centrist candidates.  Biden voted against me and the working class for 40 years. My entire ballot here in Michigan will be straight GOP.  How in the hell did you fools nominate a Republican?
Biden yellingat
after the events of the past week or so I'm grateful that Biden gave me his blessings to vote for someone else
I am. Full ballot. Michigan a swing state. Straight Red until the DNC is dead.  Biden is a worthless corporate owned puppet.
Because I like Trump more than Biden.  Trump may actually be helpful in destroying the Corporate constructed sham of a Banking and Stock Market.  Imagine if he burned that crap to the ground?  No republicans would be elected for a decade.  Biden is worthless.
TRUMP IA SOCIOPATH BIDEN IS NOT
I’m not a democrat. I am an independent.  I vote for who I like better.  Honestly I hate both of these worthless fools. But we had a chance for change but we nominated a Republican.  Trump 2020 sucks but so does Biden 2020.
I guess if Biden started calling Covid a hoax I might just let the chips fall where they may, but I probably wouldn’t vote, I don’t think I could vote for Trump.
Trump does not support Medicare for all. Biden does not support Medicare for all.  I hate both of them. Coin flip. Brb..... tails.  Trump 2020. And they spend 100s of millions on tv commercials?
is barely 4 years in politics and get to blamed for all American problems accumulated in half century. Joe Biden is half century in politics and only get to blamed why he’s not defeating  #TheGreatAwakeningWorldwide
Well thanks for supporting Biden. We need to take this country back. Get things settled down. Clear out the Senate... Then start working on universal health insurance/care. Get Covid-19 under control. Start holding business and citizens accountable. Rebuild public education.
Joe Biden is as far left as Calvin Coolidge.Stop panicking and take your  good for you.
Wall St knows Trump is a loser like everybody else so they are supporting Biden cause he is smart and cares about this country.
It’s astonishing that his supporters don’t see that.   Like when the Trump campaign runs video of riots and looting in the streets and claims that this will be Biden’s America when the video is literally of Trump’s America!  What is wrong with these people?!
Michigan Voter for Biden.  #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica  #Biden2020
You can’t be this ignorant.  Unpopular or popular doesn’t matter when the PAC money is used to buy and maintain ownership of politicians.  Pac money pays Biden like politicians to vote the corporate way no matter how popular anything is.
True Christians are Pro-Life!! So disappointed you’re voting for a senile pro-choice candidate-Biden😖. Rethink your liberal views. I started to respect you and now I don’t!
All I want for Christmas is a Biden WIN !!
Well if Biden becomes president remember you said "No thank you!" Pack up and move!! Just remember you are a puppet too then!!
You have it right Charlie! That’s why I’m voting For Donald Trump and I have loads of people gathering together on voting for him!We can’t take 4 years of Joe Biden!
Fair enough. I’m at the end of my rope with these worthless centrists. Biden is trump on Ritalin.  Trump is spastic probably on drugs. Either way he is a much better candidate than Joe.  Trump could do real permanent damage to Wall Street and Banking industry.
Me?  I don’t think Biden is a Corporate Owned worthless centrists his voting record proves it. Go ahead and google it.  Or just remain clueless. Either way, I don’t care.
To give Oboma little boys and Biden little girls with clean hair to smell and touch.
Well said.  Biden has to end Bush tax cuts. That will eliminate corporate funding for many democrats. Mid term will be a blood bath.  Progressives ain’t giving him a dime. Boomers are dropping like flys. Biden won’t accomplish shit. GOP will rule for a decade after this mistake
The good news is I can vote against every democrat on my ballot and if enough folks follow my lead..... I can Hillary this Biden nomination and it won’t cost me a dime.
Because Citizens United which worthless Biden voted for states Corporations are people. They can donate any amount to any PAC. Corporate interests own 99 percent of politicians, every Newspaper, News station, lobbyist, and “ ALEC”.  I don’t have 90 million in checking to compete.
Joe biden even said we will have to remove trump by force.
F giving money to Corporate Joe Biden. I’ll give her $100.00.
Biden can even finish a coherent sentence. How is he going to run the country? How many years has he been in office, and what has he done for minorities? The first black president had done less than the current president for black people. Sounds like a no brainer.
What they need to do to Replace Biden with Bernie.
Like I said Bernie did a mistake dropping out. Biden played everybody with this task force shit it was mostly for show in order to get Bernie supporters to vote for him. Biden is garbage and so is the DNC.
And like the Republican party the    does not care about the people of this country. This is why I will not be voting for neither party in November just voting in August locally but fuck Biden and the DNC.
Integralists for Biden, explain??
Harris was totally unprepared for her primary run. She never figured out a position on health care.  As a Senate Democrat, she has been useless in the pandemic. Biden needs a virus fighter like Whitmer of Michigan.
If you were voting for Joe Biden’s policies you are a Republican. I realize that is unnecessary and rude. I apologize. You can’t possibly be at fault that Joe Biden voted for and with the GOP for 40 fucking years. No your fault. Your a follower. Right off the political cliff
By voting for Biden this coming November 👏👏👏
Big whip. Biden’s corporate owned ads is trying to get in the will
Not to me.  People die everyday. Hope your alright but I ain’t voting for Biden.
Ma’am. I wish you the absolute best life has to offer.  I’ve moved on from even considering voting for Biden.  Seriously though. Take care of your son and yourself. God bless
I hope V P Biden tears it down when he becomes president.
Narrowing the field to black women democrats is typical Biden bull.
He’s a RINO if he supports Biden
I do apologize about 3 responses. Soc security is the only thing I would vote to protect that we have now. Biden voted to cut it not once but twice.   No way I would ever vote Biden.
Gimme a break. Anyone can retrace what happened and come with an “I woulda” plan. What did Biden actually say, as steps were being taken?  Based on that, your Monday morning quarterbacking wouldn’t look too good.
The phrase “Healthcare available to everyone “. Is a typical GOP or corporate response. It means it’s available to anyone who can afford it.  If you vote Biden you are voting for a Republican.  Wow would you look at that?  We’re both voting Republican in our own way. 👍🏻
I’m voting trump. It’s a more effective 🖕🏻to the DNC it’s Centrists.  Biden is worst nomination since Hillary. Yet another worthless Corporate owned puppet.
Not uneducated nor am I manipulated by CNN. Americans know this election is all about socialism vs capitalism !  Joe Biden is a democratic  puppet suffering from dementia!
The good news is this. Trump will probably collapse the entire corrupt corporate owned financial system. Stock market too. I believe trump could screw up everything the GOP with Biden spent 40-50 years creating.  Biden wins..... who cares the misery will continue. Trump is a F up
MSNBC and CNN like to keep senior citizens money coming in.  If the seniors knew we won’t vote for Biden or any democrat without Medicare for all they might demand it. Since every senior in the country is already on it.
I’ll never vote for a centrist.  This is a pickle we are in here.  I no longer give a shit who the president is if we nominate republicans like Biden.  Tough tough spot.
No thank you to Biden. And every democrat on my ballot.
I’d be more worried that progressives believe you and Biden are just about as far right as Saager is.  Biden is a nasty Republican. Check out his voting record.  Biden is so shitty I’m voting GOP for the first time in my life. Eligible to vote since 88. Biden sucks
If trump is re-elected I hope the first change we see is no more centrist nominations.  If you nominate a Corporate owned puppet aka Republican in drag like Biden you can’t expect a rational person to vote for him.
I hope but nothing happened to little Bush and Cheney or the assholes that crashed the economy in 08 so I'm very skeptical. I don't see Biden going down that road. He's gonna try to "UNITE" the country. Good luck with that.
Biden = sexual harassment pander 😆😆😆
Poll: Anxiety props up Biden, Trump voters fervent
Very important program from Mark Levin about Left/Biden politics for Suburbs. Everybody should educate themselves about plans of the Left to change the American Life, which we do NOT want. Please watch, VERY IMPORTANT, but they won't tell you!
We all watched it live, we know he lied. We’re more worried about when(but really if) there will be consequences.  If the answer is Jan. 2021 under the Biden administration, whoa boy are Republicans in for a doozy.
Yeah, no Biden or Trump signs on my lawn but don’t get it twisted, I’ll be voting blue down the ticket.
George this guy in pic is someone you could follow to understand what you and others who want progressives to vote Biden are up against.  Ryan is plainly stating where I and many others are coming from.  Between Biden and Trump is see two idiots I don’t want as prez
Page 4.  With Corporate interest, Wall Street, and Banking industry turns their back on Biden who is paying for his re-election in 2024?   This nominee is doomed to fail. Corporate puppets can’t go against corporate interests.  Not enough citizens are excited about him
Page 3. Stock market goes down as profits shrink on stock market as a direct result of ending tax cuts.  Now Wall Street turns back on Biden.  Business owners will lay off workers too to try and back into a profit. Continued
Let’s say Biden wins.  Bush tax cut would sensibly be first change he would make.  Once that happens Corporate Interests turn their back on him. Why? They pay more taxes if he ends bush tax cuts. Pretty easy so far.  Continued
Yeah it’s always some excuse or distraction to keep bending us over for the corporate fucking we have been taking since the 70s.  I’m all for protesting.  Let’s not forget Obama and Biden has the first cages for immigrants.  Might be civil war 2 in the near future.  Continued
We nominated a Republican. Biden is to far right to earn my vote. Since there is only 2 candidates with a chance, I’m voting to cause a Biden loss.  Sucks I know. But the nominee sucks.
Because I’ve voted straight blue from 88-16 and the results are revolting.  We pay highest healthcare costs in the world. We pay astronomical prescription drug costs. We are ripped off by every industry because corporate owned politicians like Biden vote across the aisle with gop
I truly believe trump could burn down Wall Street and the banking industry if he has another 4 years.  Biden does as Corporate interests tell him. Trump does whatever he feels like that moment.  Kind of like giving a todddler a loaded gun. Continued
Trump is not taking this job seriously. He is just coasting through this like High School.  Biden has been blowing the 1 percent or corporate interests for 4-5 decades.  Biden couldn’t raise 1 million dollars from grass routes. Nobody likes him except fossils.  Continued.
This is true.  Earlier in this thread I mentioned I’m voting for our funtioning moron of a President instead of Biden.  Biden is a filthy Republican who I can’t vote for.  Many Republicans are voting for Biden. Why do you think many Republicans are not happy with trump?
We know now that Biden is a clown figure without an ability to think for himself. He represents Socialist Left Party that we shouldn't call "Democrat" any more!!!!!
Our nominee Biden is Corporate Owned and can not under any circumstance Be trusted to side with the working class
Page 2.  Biden voted against me for 40 years siding with Republicans over the working class. Bernie fought for people his entire career.   Biden to me and many is a Republican.  You should not expect my vote on Nov 3rd.
It shouldn’t make me emotional when a conservative comes out in support of Biden, but this is how far Republicans have fallen.  There’s a grim fate for those in the GOP who went all in for their power grab.
Every time I see a Biden commercial I throw up in my mouth a lil bit
Vision:  Biden choose Michael Obama.  If they win, doubtful, Biden becomes diagnosed with Dementia.  Michael becomes President.  Chooses Hilary as Vice.  There goes the neighbourhood.
YESSSSSSS Mr. President Joseph R. Biden 100 more days until you’re elected finally &amp; we’ll be able to breathe a sigh of relief than we’ll just have to pray that time flies until your inauguration!!! #BlueWave2020TakeOver #Biden2020Landslide 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊
Then why not spy on Biden's campaign. Oh, I forgot. He's barricaded in his Bunker Basement. Wonder if Archie is there with him?
Can’t wait to hear Biden say:  “TEAR DOWN THAT WALL”
Tucker Carlson is warning America that if Joe Biden wins Donald Trump's America will no longer exist.
For your information Biden voted for and with Republicans for more than 40 years. Biden sucks. Biden wants to cut Soc Sec. Biden sucks. Biden is a Corporate Owned Puppet. Biden sucks. I ain’t voting for Biden. Biden sucks.
Ms. Rice, I expect to see you in the White House as the VP having a discussion with President Biden.
realDonaldTrump: There is NO WAY a place like Pennsylvania can vote for the Radical Left and their puppet, Joe Biden, when they are against fracking, steel production, and just about everything else that Pennsylvania stands for. Likewise, Texas, and many other states!!!
I’d be scared too if you lose the Senate and White House prison lurks for trump.  But I agree with you Joe Biden is a fucking Republican. I can’t vote for him.
I don’t like Joe Biden. I am not voting for Joe Biden.  I see polls that say Biden is way ahead. Ok. That’s fine. I don’t care who wins.  God damn are there a lot of trump tards who comment on Biden’s tweets.  If Twitter was an indicator Biden would have no chance. Hate is deep
Trump sucks. So does Biden. Not voting for Biden. Complete waste of time
What have the Democrats done.There backing Biden who has got lost in his basement.Theres almost four years wasted on this clown in the White House. I’m not voting this time.Trump has destroyed this country.The Coronavirus,lost jobs.He has done nothing but lied
He's lost Florida. He's completely f*cked😁👏🏿👏🏽👏🏻 #FloridaPoll "(CNN)Poll of the week: A new CNN/SSRS poll finds that former Vice President Joe Biden leads in the state of Florida by a 51% to 46% margin over President Donald Trump among registered voters."
Prediction. Biden ends  Bush tax cuts. Corporate interests cut off a Biden and lay off workers. Biden can’t raise grassroots money Biden loses in 2024 after accomplishing nothing from 2020-2024.
Lol 😂😂😂😂. Biden is the most disloyal pos democrat I have ever seen.  He is so bad I left the party. Vote against the working class for 40 years is loyal. Wanting to cut social security is loyal.  Maybe he is loyal and we are all in the wrong party.
I’m not voting for Biden.  I don’t think a vast majority is voting for Biden. You might be right. I predict extremely low turn out because Biden is a Republican
The polls assume progressives are voting Biden.  I’m not. We shall see
Biden has a 40 year voting record every Republican is envious of.  Biden is a Corporate owned pimp
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Its everywhere google biden saying they will remove trump by force because he wont accept a biden win. Pelosi has said it many have said it
Twitter and Facebook become targets in Trump and Biden ads
Biden has Wall St. and the corporations. It's kind of in insulting for him ask for our money. I have vote for him but he can fuck right off if he thinks I'm gonna finance centrism.
Who said I was a Trump follwerer? Umm last I looked this is global.  I will not vote for Joe but if there was a great independent out there I would vote. I voted for Obama in the last election. Biden will be a puppet. Back to the real issue. This has been all about money. Watch.
Agreed! We have to work as though Biden is behind. Never make assumptions!
Agreed! Voters who want health care should vote for Joe Biden!
realDonaldTrump: The Trump Campaign has more ENTHUSIASM, according to many, than any campaign in the history of our great Country - Even more than 2016. Biden has NONE! The Silent Majority will speak on NOVEMBER THIRD!!! Fake Suppression Polls &amp; Fake News will not save the R…
realDonaldTrump: Crazy Nancy Pelosi said I made a mistake when I banned people from infected China from entering the U.S. in January. Tens of thousands of lives were saved, as she danced in the Streets of Chinatown (SF) in late February. Biden agreed with her, but soon admit…
realDonaldTrump: This week you had Joe Biden call Arizona a CITY. Nothing matters with him, however, because the Opposition Party (Lamestream Media) covers everything up - especially the corruption. The Obama/Biden Administration is the most corrupt in history. They even spi…
Biden is a Republican. You nominate a Republican then don’t be mad when I vote for the GOP
No way in hell I vote Biden
As long as Biden loses its all I care about.
Copy and paste this text and tweet it:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Copy and paste this text and tweet it:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Yup. The thing with Biden is that Biden has had no plan to move to the left the only reason he did the whole Bernie task force was basically to get voters and for show.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
449 comments 3 were either pro Biden or Centrist Karen’s melting down worried we won’t vote for Corporate Joe
Hey. Whatever works.  All I know is Joe Biden isn't the answer to any question whatsoever.
Me too. He is everything I want in a president.  My hatred for Biden, the DNC, and every worthless centrist can’t possibly be measured. I’ll never vote for a non progressive democrat for life. F Biden
Pg 2.  Since then ( about 56-60 years ) corporate interests have given trillions of dollars to elect who they wanted in office. These hand picked politicians like Joe Biden have been puppets on strings passing corporate friendly laws. Continued
Yes, very good Ad. Vote for Joe Biden!
I'm voting BLUE Chaz. No doubt about it. In fact tomorrow I'm going to fill out my absentee ballot for August 4th. And drop it off or mail it. I haven't decided which one will piss off Trump the most. Voting absentee mailing it in. But anyhow GO BIDEN GO BLUE.
Dignity. Truth. Respect. Honor. Biden.  What are your five words today?   #MasksIn5Words  #SaturdayMotivation  #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare  #personmanwomancameratv  #TrumpIsUnwell
Someone should tell Joe Biden that. Because I was quoting him. Here's the link.
Because! If you don't vote for Biden! YOU AIN'T BLACK! Right?
“Joe Biden supports closed borders” I just cackled
When Biden wins in November I'll be as happy as the men on Maury when they find out that they are not the father.
Joe Biden is 77 ,but on November 3rd he will be 46.
Biden also didn't sexually assault his daughter, Ivanka. "If she weren't my daughter, I'd be dating her". Who's the pedophile again?
It's not Biden accused by 25 women of sexual assault. It's not Biden that would walk in the dressing room at the Miss Teen America pageants. It's not Biden that was best buds with Jeffrey Epstein. It's not Biden that had Russian hookers give him a golden shower.
Seeing Obama/biden selling out to China...wanting America to b a socialist 3rd world shit hole...demoncrats calling feds protecting federal buildings  from anarchists (not peaceful protestors) "storm troopers" ? ..now...that's sad...I'm sure u agree
Because folks like idiot corporate owned Biden voted for Citizens United resulting in corporate interests own our politicians at the federal and state levels and the media.
Serious question:  will Christians somehow be banned from worshipping if Biden wins?  How do you factor religious liberty in here?
Can Martha fucking Ford sell the lions. Why the hell is joe Biden’s illiterate sister running an NFL team. Assembly lines don’t translate to football.
This is why this country is stuck we could do better but nope they gave us Biden vs Trump. What a fucking nightmare.
Honestly The whole Biden/Obama team up is such bullshit makes me so fucking angry because we should be moving forward but nope we got to go back to the Obama years instead of moving forward and this is who they want me to vote for absolutely fucking not.
Is Obama his fucking adviser what is this shit why is Biden so desperate to go back to how shit was during the Obama years how the fuck is that progress Obama promised a lot and could not get a lot of shit passed cause the Republicans stood in the way and because Obama did not
please put us back in stage 3 before we all die. Oh. And join biden in the white house this november. #PLEASESAVEUSWHITMER
who is this clueless loser Mo?  Watching him is like listening to the Counterfeit News Network.  Nothing but lies and fake news.  A vote for Biden is for the end of our country.
An easy choice to make.
#DHS Also just legally put in writing, they lied re: NY Immigrant transit. This admin is NOT to be trusted with a shoe👟, let alone an entire human being😡😤.
We MUST keep track of them. Look at all the #KidsInCages they have lost😤. Or offended upon while being dragged maliciously away, or in supposed #FederalCustody.
When do Republicans stop relying on being gaslit?  Seriously, his suggestion to convince someone to vote for Biden is to make them afraid of someone else. That’s all Republicans have anymore.
Get ready to continue dealing with protests.Biden may not be the greatest.But Trump is a racist.compulsive liar.What has he done for you donut eating  support his sorry ass
That is because Creepy, Sleepy Joe Biden can’t pass the test and you need to worry about yourself. Stay away, enjoy the time you have left as a free person. Oh and  beat you silly in 2016.
She was a lot of people's first choice. But everyone correctly assumed people were too scared to put a woman at the top of the ticket, so they wasted their primary vote by using it AGAINST Sanders or AGAINST Biden, because ultimately we're all AGAINST Trump.  And so it goes
Telling rich donors nothing will fundamentally change. #JoeBidenJob
What is this how the fuck does this make Biden appealing?
I've seen more Biden signs in Rochester Hills. Not many trump signs at all. But drove through Macomb County the other day and there are still a lot of  yard signs, flags, and big billboard-style trump signs everywhere. Needed a shower after I got home!
It’s so weird all the criticisms laid at Biden seem to mostly ring true for Trump and his ilk. Could it be projection? 😉
Because the black presidents agenda was to instill total racial divide and destruction!! Oblunder and Biden racist worthless administration!
Biden will cancel.  You watch..there will be an elaborate excuse from the lying dems
They're accusing the wrong person. Sounds like Obama and Biden instigate and propagated destruction with no apologies
No it would be Biden’s America! The guy is a complete nut case! As for setting up Booths up for for for Democrats they cheat! And people are walking away like flys from the Democrats! I sure don’t want to raise my children in a socialist state or Country!
Biden can’t put two sentences together!
Biden should be in prision along with Obama!
Biden has slipped. Ok he's almost 80. You'll slip, I'll slip, we'll all slip. Mango Mussolini hasn't slipped, he's always been a fraud and a basket case. My dog ( an Aussie) is way more intelligent and more COGNITIVE. Maybe I'll have her primary your dear leader.
I choose to avoid anything commenting on Biden's mental state as much of it is just mean-spirited. There are 40+ years of documented politicial baggage showing why he should not be president.
You are more likely to hear Biden is having orgies in the White House than he does anything a progressive would appreciate.  It isn’t going to happen.  Vote 3rd party or if your an asshole like me vote trump. Biden voted with Republicans religiously since the 70s
Hell no. F Biden. Never Biden. You want me to vote for a Corporate owned pimp that voted against the middle class for 40 years.  I am voting straight red the entire ballot in response to nominating a worthless corporate owned centrist.
Your vote counts too.  Did you really vote for Biden?  No need to answer none of my business. God bless
There is no democracy now. This is an oligarchy.  F Centrists.  Every time you nominate one most of us vote Red.  Dukakis, Kerry, Gore, Clinton all worthless corporate owned centrists.  They all remind me of worthless Biden.  You might win this year. Hillary was sure of it 😂
Huh I believe every Democrat is voting for Biden.  If not he really really is the shittiest nominee ever.  Independents don’t like him at all in numbers. Most Republicans hate him. That I don’t understand. If I just saw Biden’s voting record I’d bet the farm he was a Republican.
Shit like this...... 84 year old woman cleaning up used rubbers and filthy toilets in a roadside shithouse is why I can’t vote for worthless Biden.  In 34 years that could be me.
I respect her a hell of a lot more than Biden or Trump.
Biden's showing signs of dementia? Have ya listened to your dear leaders nonsensical, argel bargel, word salads. Yea, nothing says mental acuity like talking about ingesting Lysol or sticking an infrared light up your ass but you stick with that. Ya no his dad died of Alzheimer's
Dream on. Biden may end up with 400 of those stupid electoral college votes especially with Obama campaigning for him.
I couldn't care less if Biden takes a nap for 4 years. At least he'll put competent people in his administration. He won't put "Joe the plumber" as his secretary of defense or "light fingers Louie" as his Attorney General.
China refuses to leave their embassy in Huston TX This is a declaration of war. If you think they want  to remain President you're poorly mistaken. China hates us &amp; wants to rule aka kill us. China paid Hunter Biden millions from after  threatened them
The blue wave died. Biden is not worth voting for. His nomination is more revolting than idiots presidency.  We had a chance to make real change and the corporate interests gave us Biden.  I’m all 4 watching trump ruin Wall Street.
...nominating part of the RNC will BE in Charlotte. He's running against VP Biden --- but a major opponent of his is the Coronavirus which is bad now - in large part due to his inept handling of it all.
President-To-Be Biden, you earned my vote! Go Phillies! As long as they finish ahead of the Mets!!!
1) “Presidential”? So,like a movie POTUS and lies more eloquently?? 2) Trump has listened to science. The science evolved and changed. Fauci, same. Biden may consult scientists. Too bad he wouldn’t understand and would forget what they said 10 mins later.
OMG the Obama Biden stream. Oh my. Oh my.
I'll vote Biden over SpongeBlob. It's the only responsible thing to do. We only gotta put up with Biden for 4 years. How long has SpongeBlob been presidunce? Seems like 40 years.
This is Trump's sick but weak attempt to convince people that this is what life would be like under Biden so of course his koolaide drinking followers buy right into it
A vote for Biden,is a vote for your children.
realDonaldTrump: Obama, who wouldn’t even endorse Biden until everyone else was out of the primaries (and even then waited a long time!), is now making a commercial of support. Remember, I wouldn’t even be here if it weren’t for them. I wouldn’t be President. They did a terr…
You obviously don't get it. You can say whatever you want about Biden, he is still the better man.  is a lying, cheating, racist, narcissistic psychopath. He's committed two impeachable offenses JUST THIS WEEK. There is no bottom to how low he will go.
Yeah when push comes to shove, no generals are gonna be like, hmm I could just keep being a general under Joe Biden but I think I'll do treason to keep the fat baby around
Like when the House certifies that Joe Biden won the election, who actually stops Joe Biden from becoming president?
The only Trump paths to victory that I hear anymore are one of the following:  What if Joe Biden does something really dumb? What if the polls are all lies? What if Trump rigs/cancels the election?
I think every democrat is voting for Biden.  An Independent like myself am not voting for Biden.  I guess once those who temporarily registered as Democrats to vote for Bernie are counted then we will know.  Many are not voting at all. No one worth voting for.
For 40 fucking years your hero voted against the working class.  Forty fucking years.  Citizens United thank Biden. He is corporate owned pimp.  This entire comment is true.  Biden isn’t worth a squirt of piss to me.  They are both terrible.
Biden can’t think for himself so whom are you voting for you don’t know?
Only because he has Dementia and you won’t know who running the country Biden don’t know where he at half the time. And all the satanic rituals that Hollywood does and your following that. Human trafficking,drug trafficking and your following Hollywood.
Ghislaine is going to implicate,the Biden’s.
Make no mistake, "liberals" who think protestors need to go home now are just scared of the fact that the poor and marginalized might continue to have power and make demands even when Biden is president.
Why continue to lie about Biden? Trump &amp; supporters are scared. They can’t promote themselves because the truth is that bad.
Biden is a sick 'genius' who should NEVER be a president!
Worse. Unlike Obama in 2008, Biden is a 40+ year Washington insider.  He may say this, but he'll do that.
At a time with COVID-19, every American needs health care and health insurance! Trump has tried to take away all the health insurance gains from Affordable Care Act. Vote Biden!
You are missing the point of the video, rather than critique Biden. Just saying.
Donated ! Can’t wait to put a Bizon and Biden lawn sign up! Let’s get real representation for Michigan’s 10th District so Kim can also be #thatwomanfrommichigan 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻 #WomenGetThingsDone
The only thing  has that  doesn't have is dementia. Biden's the best democrats can Do? No wonder they keep sleepy Joe in a bunker. It's not to save Biden from the #ChinaVirus it's to keep us from seeing how bad  mind really is. He's dems puppetIf the US elects Joe Biden American citizens should brush up on the Chinese language because that’s what we’ll be speaking and also Asian botany because apparently the Chinese communists plan on using the U. S. as a greenhouse.  via
I hope Biden doesn't listen to his certain allies. Picking Kamala would be a slam dunk for him, don't mess this up Joe I pray 🙏
Supercut Shows Fox Personalities Saying Trump Will Never Do Something. He Just Did.
That's funny. You're a real hoot. However, I believe Joe Biden was vice president when Barack Obama pulled us out of the great recession.
I'm ashamed to say I live in Michigan.  The biggest problem Trump has in Michigan is that he tells the truth about the black messiah (Obama).  People don't like Biden, they just don't like the fact that Obama sucked and Trump keeps saying it.
Biden will win, I think by a large margin.
Yeah I can’t imagine him showing up for Biden’s inauguration. He’ll have some excuse. I just want his margin of defeat to be so large that he can’t lie to himself about it. He’ll lie to everyone else for sure. But I just want him to have to admit to himself that he lost.
so are you gonna cheerlead and knock doors and advocate publicly for biden?
Neil Cavuto is a Biden loving scum sucking bag of shit.  He doesn't have a very high rated show and really should go to CNN, where he would be a good fit with Don Lemon or Chris Cuomo.
You wanna vote for Biden cause he’s not Trump? Fine.  But I never thought I’d see Palestinians and Arabs cheerlead for a guy who openly and proudly says “I am a Zionist.”  It’s shameful. #Palestine #FreePalestine
Trump offers many statements that are phony but current economic disruptions are not the result of one person. This derailment included the near entirety of both parties wounding the economy and abandoning the public. #US #CARES #Democrats #Republicans
Wut? Don’t think they want to raise that topic. “‘But as Bill Clinton once told me, the number one cause of Alzheimer’s is ambition,’ he added, while noting he’s in favor of Demings.”
Another idea since we are just floating them:  The US Military puts your fucking ass against a wall and installs Pence until he wins in his own right or Biden takes over?
Absolutely better off with Biden. Fuck Trump!
That’s funny I thought Biden was the moderate choice and people are voting for him because he won’t do to us what Trump has done
Democracy means you can vote and have someone to vote for you on bills. opposite of a democracy is dictatorship or monarchy  Socialism is a theory that the community owns everything.  Biden never said anything about Socialism or Removing democracy. He said “Democratic socialism.”
Automatic loss for Biden in Michigan
Congrats to the people of Georgia for joining Arizona &amp; N.Carolina in polling Joe Biden ahead of the screwball! Next on the list the state of Texas where Biden is creeping closer everyday!
Had this occurred under Obama/Biden it would have been handled swiftly and correctly.....it NEVER would have been called a hoax
I live in Michigan and I'm voting for Biden.
I think people are more worried about Trump getting another 4 years then the fact that Biden is moderate or subpar
If you think joe Biden is left wing you’re smoking crack

Watching Vice President Biden speak is as boring as watching Governor Cuomo speak. It’s true Governor Cuomo has a firmer grasp on his faculties but they run neck and neck in terms of personality.
Shouldn’t the Biden Campaign have announced his Presidential running mate already? #HidinBiden
Former Sanders campaign co-chair Nina Turner compares voting for Biden to eating 'bowl of sh--'   No wonder ⁦ said you would have to hold your nose to vote for Joe!! #BasementBiden
If Joe Biden gets a traffic ticket on the way to his inauguration, the wacko right will go ballistic. There will be multiple investigations.
“Conservatives, Republicans and independents can legitimately reject Trump, however unhappy they are with Biden. Far better to face the perils of opposition than to risk irreversibly tarnishing the philosophy of conservatism and its party with Trump’s brand.” 😂
Don’t think the polls are wrong. The votes are NOT in GOP favor, regardless of the Biden Condition. Too many fractionalized action paths with no identifiable successes. Be gracious in your loss! You did some great things, just didn’t sell them well!
But I would have been dismissive of him. He lost. Same if Biden today does it. I’d hate it, but move on. I personally find it highly suspect of a president even entertains the idea of denying election results.
Hey Sean I would like to see you say something about Biden refusing to have a interview with Chuck walace. Biden election committee said no to interview. OK then how is the American people gonna trust biden when his own elect committe  don't trust him. That's bad
Under Joe Biden, we will not have huge gains, but we will also not have historically large drops.  We will return to the market as it was under Obama or even Clinton. Steady, small daily increases that denote a healthy growing economy. This is a market where money can be made.
We all know that Biden will continue to allow corporations to run the show. Remember “Nothing will fundamentally change”
In Michigan there are no bashful Trump supporters like the Republicans like to think. They're a bunch of Trump flag waving morons! But it's nowhere near the support he had last year. This is a hard working union state that made a big mistake it will correct this year. BIDEN 2020!
The race was so close last time, any small breeze could push it one way or the other. Knowing Tlaib and her district, she's making a big mistake not going for the Biden wave.
What makes you think that Biden wouldn’t concede? Hillary is one person. You might be right, but I wouldn’t use the actions of one person to decide how another might act.
If Trump refuses to accept the results of the election and tries to stay in office, he’d be acting like a dictator. Be very afraid of anyone who does not respect election results. (And yes, I know that goes both ways. If Trump is voted in, I’ll respect that, and I’d hope Biden
LeBron James is another idiot talking about slavery when China has slaves that are arabic making Nike shoes which LeBron buys but don't say anything about slavery there,another idiot who probably will vote for dumb mental loss biden who thinks Arizona is a city
Counting those chickens... “A dark horse candidate who aces her oral exam with the nominee could end up as the finalist — and considering Biden’s commanding status in the race, as well as his age — the most likely person in America to be the 47th president.”
Vote Trump not dumb biden and dumber Val. They believe in screwing the American people,dems are a
Val demoing and Joe Biden are idiots,I didn't know Joe Biden had extra room in his basement for Val Deming. These damn democrats have there head so far up each others ass it's pittiful.. If people like freedom in this country they need to vote TRUMP
Biden LOVES women too. If you know what I mean 😉. He isn’t so innocent himeself.
Because Biden LOVES women. If you know what I mean 😉
Isnt it nice to see Arizona &amp; N.Carolina now have Biden leading in the new polls? At the rate Trump is losing states he could be left with only Urah &amp; Wyoming lmfao.
Thank you N.Carolina and Arizona the 2 newest states on the Biden train, toot toot!
Keep blaming it on the media, the left and Biden but this is all on YOUR watch dumbass!
I'm curious whether Biden showed remorse for going after Obama in '08.
There will be NO debates! Not even electronically from separate locations. Biden can’t talk for that long.
I will never watch sports again now that the players take a knee at anthem time, there low life Americans like biden,pelosi, shumar. This is America you stupid f%$KS you stand with hand on heart during anthem. Didn't your parents teach you anything.
BMI IS ALSO A RACIST TERROISTS GROUP ALONG WITH AN TIFA THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT LIFE AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THEY JUST WANT TO CAUSE TROUBLE,THE COUNTRY NEEDS TO BRING BACK LINCHING FOR TERROIST AND THOSE WHO COMMIT TREASON LIKE CLINTONS,OBAMA,BIDEN AND PELOSI.
Oh, c'mon. A monkey would be better than what we have now. I think we will be just fine with Mr. Biden. So do not worry about us. Just start packing your shit to get out of town on January 21, 2121.
In November it will come down to freedom or communism not Trump or Biden or left or right. The November election will be the moment when us Americans will choose the country we want to live in.
Uphill battle big time, nobody is excited about Biden.
If Biden every put a twitter out that he really text and put it out it would be so fucking funny. Biden is just a propped up puppet. Fuck the DNC.
Bought off bullshit, rigged primary’s. I think you might be right Biden was dead and the DNC  wants somebody, and wants somebody who can ad-lib and not people think what a brain lost dick.
If you’re ignorant enough to think that Joe Biden is a “leftist,” please DM me for bridge-buying opportunities.
Now Tucker Carlson is campaigning for Joe Biden!  The rats are jumping off the sinking ship!
Rice is best choice for her strengths and credentials. She is needed to repair our international relationships. Her experience as National Security Advisor is absolutely needed. This also gives her an existing relationship with Joe Biden, allowing her to hit the ground running.

JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU...AGAIN!
Well I have to agree there. As much as I think Bernie was a bit much he has substance.  Biden? 🤔
His last words were Vote Biden!
Trump should spy on Biden. Black lives matter. Biden put all blacks in jail band wanted segregation.  Blm
Why did he say Biden ? he not even the current United States Champion
The thing conservatives don't get is "but Biden" is not an own or a gotcha. We do not fuck with that old bitch.
DO NOT VOTE FOR KANYE. ANY VOTE NOT FOR BIDEN IS FOR TRUMP.
He keeps pushing the same lies, fake it to you make it. Exactly the way Roy Cohn taught him. Just like its Bidens fault what's going on in the streets now, bull fucking shit who's in charge right now not Joe Biden it's the dumb fucked up 🍊 in the oval office!
Well, actually, better the teacher's union than a rich girl who never saw a public school she wanted to succeed. Another reason to Vote Biden November 3rd.
In case you did not notice I could care less about Trump or Biden , they are nearly the same, I care about justice and law and neither side appears very interested in it.
Donald Trump's campaign team trying to convince the world that Biden is some sort of lefty, Antifa, Marxist is one of the dumbest fucking campaign strategies I've ever seen.

Trouble for Biden: Comms Aide Has Long History of Sexist Tweets
This a really good interview. Trump is just kind of a regular guy who gets painted as some evil monster in the MSM. I'm not some huge Trump guy, but if you asked me to pick between Biden &amp; Trump, it would be a no brainer to me. I would choose Trump 100%
Joe Biden is a pedophile and barely has an idea who he or others are around him.  He should help you bigly like his last 40 years in government.
essentially just Reported if Joe Biden is elected-former President Obama will be the President. I don’t think America can handle basic training again, man.
America believes in honesty and integrity. Those are attributes you and your grifter family know nothing about. But in November when the Dems take over the majority and Biden kicks your ass out of the WH, we can rename the forts, get rid of the statues &amp; fumigate the WH
Whatever you do in the privacy of a voting booth is your business.   But you can’t publicly advocate for #Palestine and Joe Biden at the same time.
Sorry dude..I know...man it sux, I can’t wait for President Biden
The Chinese were lulled by  the worlds liberals. Lliberals work by lying and you are supposed to accept it. It’s enough already. We are not going to accept it any longer. You’re lying Antifa BLM China. If Joe Biden wins China will be back on top. If not they must stop lying.
someone tell Biden to keep his mouth shut on new ideas to speak about and let him just coast to the presidency. Please don’t get Hillary’s foot in mouth disease we can’t afford it
Looking forward to your retirement. If Chris Wallace interviews Biden, the former vice president may give you gaffes for sound bites. What he will not do is lie. That's good enough for me.
The only thing that's being proven to me, why Biden is so far ahead in the polls, is that there are a lot of very, very stupid people in this country.
Biden Ad just aired during baseball he's Winning
If Biden takes Florida
I will never be on Biden’s side. EVER
Biden wouldn’t because he is dumb.
Biden's a puppet for the deep state. Trump2020 save us from those criminals.
Hey Sean the BLM supporters are buttholes,Joe Biden,Nancy Pelosi and shumar are all in the basement under the desk.there idiots peroid. I am a true believer in the 2nd amendment. All legal Americans need to arm there selves to protect home and family.
The only things  does is to try to further his election chances. And he will still lose to Biden because Biden is the better man.
It’s literally Trumps America today, how do people tolerate just blaming it on Biden. Trump could stop this all rn.
Whatever it takes to wake up with a President Joe Biden, Teddy. Whatever it takes.  Thankfully, you've tied yourself to tRumpster and will never see the inside of the WH  except as a guest.
Anyone else notice that Biden is ahead in ALL the polls. Trump isn't leading in any.  ROFLMAO.
Did I miss something? Biden is president right now?damn right! biden!!
Because you will never be President and I love Trumps honest and blunt tweets so piss off.  Biden for prison 2020
Why is YouTube feeding me news about Trump when I’m searching for videos about Biden? Doesn’t that make it seem like they’re pushing a political agenda?
All you people excusing this, imagine it's your daughter they're talking about.  It's disgusting.
Trump campaign temporarily halts TV advertising in Michigan, but plans to outspend Biden 4-1
Yeah and a vote for Biden is a vote for his VP because if he wins he will be lucky to last a full year
No Trump cut a deal to get out of it Now he exposed it That's y he wants to delay the election He not scared of losing to Biden He's playing his role to find children many who r ADOS lineage I've been on this story since 2013
Your comment has nothing to do with the tweet you're responding to, or the one it's responding to. You just seem obsessed with Trump, and any criticism of him must be met with an attack on his enemies- in this case, Joe Biden and black people.
I just feel like Biden election ads should just be images of the federal stormtroopers arresting American citizens and throwing them in unmarked vans, then cut to him saying - that will never happen while I am President.  Hard to top that as a statement.
How you figure? There's STILL gonna be a Dem candidate in Nov. if Biden drops out. Ideally, it would be the candidate in 2nd place (&amp; note: he would win with high numbers). But we know how the DNC works... it would be a right wing dem by their choice. So it would change nothing.
he’s right!  Joe Biden!!!
Joe Biden will restore unity and dignity to the collapse of the empire
There are zero circumstances under which Biden, or any Democratic leaders, would be inclined to agree - half inclined or otherwise. Zero.
You think Joe Biden is going to "restore rule of law"?

Not going that far, but will be voting for Biden.
I'll admit I was a little relieved after 2016 when I saw that the 3rd party vote in my state would not have changed who won  But the Reid thing really gives me pause on Biden, super bummed that that the Dems reacted so similarly to the way the Republicans dealt with kavanaugh
Definitely.   I went third-party last time, but it's very different this time around.  But I wouldn't judge those who couldn't put their name next to Biden.   I guess anyway you go I can understand your reasonings..
Question to All Democratic Biden Followers? If Joe Biden knew How To Fix America Why Didn’t He Tell Obama???
Stop shaming people for considering third party candidates.  That's not how freedom works.  It's not a vote for Biden. It's not a vote for Trump.  That's not how voting works.  Do your research. Select the best candidate. Leave other people alone. And then vote.
Biden pushed for gay marriage. I really don’t care to fight with someone I’d rather have a conversation with
I shouldn't be surprised a conservative PAC is running commercials calling Joe Biden untrustworthy when the current conservative president is doing the shadiest and most untrustworthy shit imaginable...
not like it would be the first time Biden collapsed as the actual voting approached  I still expect him to win though
If Joe Biden isn't willing to compromise, then voters shouldn't be expected to.
Check out the date in the screenshot below, 2009, when Barrack Obama and Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi were running things.

‘Your Daddy is a traitor’: Ex-tea party lawmaker Joe Walsh slams Don Jr’s attempt to mock Joe Biden
You really want to spin every Not Voting for Biden take as a vote for trump, don't you? For many there's no difference between Trump and Biden, so if they were the only choices, why would voting fucking matter anyway? Biden doesn't support M4A during a pandemic. Fuck him.
Here's something of substance: rich democrat leaders making Biden the nominee will remain rich whether he wins or not. They don't care about those less fortunate then them, they'll never go against the interests of their corporate donors. So, yeah. Vote against the oligarchy.
this is from this hysterically pathetic Biden support site apparently run by former Bernie and Warren people, btw
this is what a Biden lead attempt to return to the Obama era has to look like, empty, vaguely aspirational statements terrifyingly out of touch with political and material reality, anyone who invests a shred of hope in this is just asking to get hurt

Bernie and Biden are both communists. Or at the very least they're sold out and beholden to communists.
Bastiat was never Bernie, not even Warren. Destiny said he might have voted Bernie, but actively argued against him. Iri turned to biden after super Tuesday with no concessions and actively dragged people for not jumping ship as soon as things got convenient.
Well, when their positions switch to being and fighting against left wing policy and praising the gospel of a decidedly right wing biden rather than trying hold HIS feet to the fire, then yes, I consider them center right democrats.
like, whatever, even if it's just a "pre-writeup" mistake, this happened during the primaries too where Biden "won" races where there'd been no voting yet, and that it shows everyone behind the scenes knows the script. whatever uncertainty remains is confined to a narrow margin
This guy is the reason we now have Biden.
Here. Learn something. And try vetting quotes before you use them.
1:13 through 1:31 pretty much describes why Biden is gonna lose.
I think people read too much into my rhetoric. Never said I'm not voting for biden and never advocated not. Just understand why people are frustrated and remain on the fence. Also understand why people wouldn't want to work with the people who call them bigots for not...
And that's my point. That's what keeps happening. I once again had to debunk the harassing Bernie bro myth for umpteenth time. I know for a fact I'm not alone in this. It's cyclical and seems to coincide with the dnc or biden making shitty decisions. It's ridiculous.
It seems to be more of a response to mass criticism of the dnc, democratic party, or biden who all seem hell bent on giving people a reason to not vote for him.
Why are we back to biden discourse? Is it because the dnc shit the bed on releasing a platform that spoke to the plurality of voters again and people feel like this is a good time to quell any descent by moralizing your vote?  Yes. Yes it is.
It appears to be our bad that no one learned a damned thing from 2016. Someone being bad isn't enough for some people. Some people see it as a false choice because biden isn't offering them much to hope for.
Are you referring to the concentration camps Obama and Biden built!?!?!?
Those of you worried about how strong Biden is or isn't, try to remember that he's experienced, compassionate, as honest as any politician can be, and willing to accept help and advice.  Even an imperfect Biden beats a lying, corrupt, con man. #Biden2020
Biden announces running mate and:
Not even saying I wouldn't vote for biden, but saying he needs to give us a reason to show up is just silly.
While hiding evidence of his own racist police station and then dropped out and endorsed biden, despite having more delegates a rat. The gay stuff, I don't agree with at all, but to call that on par with the amount of people attempting to drag me and others for...
Actually it was. Every post I still make where I criticize biden or the democrats is still met with some version of "you're going to let Trump win." so pardon me if I rightfully called the guy who claimed victory in a state he didn't win and claimed black lives matter...
And just when Barr is going to have a chance to talk...FOX NEWS SWITCHES TO BIDEN.

I think Oprah will replace Biden when he is forced out at the Convention or steps down shortly after
Despite Trump's goading, Biden steers clear of 'law and order' debate:  via
You obviously view this (Biden in the White House) as something desirable. Biden was the second worse candidate the DNC put up. You were the worst. Hate and will not vote for Conservadems.
Biden is hiding from the debates. His pals at the big universities (which accept Chinese money) are running defense for him.
Biden is hiding from the debates. His pals at the big universities (which accept Chinese money) are running defense for him.
Bastiat would literally tell you he's not really left wing, but a "centrist," which is right of center on a generic political compass. Half the left isn't ready to let Trump win. They're just looking for a reason to vote FOR biden rather than AGAINST Trump.
People leveraging their votes against biden to get better legislation. When I asked him if it was ever about the policy, he never answered and later blocked me for rightly calling lctrfan a crypto fascist.

When will Joe Biden face a critical question from the MSM?
"Mike Huckabee: Joe Biden avoids interviews because ‘he says something utterly ridiculous’ every time".  Seems pretty presidential, by current standards.
Would Biden be given the questions ahead of the debate?
Ahh but it does promote the cause..if the cause is the destruction of America.   Take a good look at Portland folks..this is the left...these are Biden supporters.  Vote red...vote straight red...for every single got damn election..the right ain’t perfect.but they ain’t crazy 😳
I don't think Facebook is a threat and Biden shouldn't agree to this idea. FB allows for freedom of expression. I closed my account in 2016 but used FB for several years. I don't like FB but Biden can't support this characterization.
DNC: "Shit. Biden's actually ahead of Trump! We need to do something!"  Also DNC: "I know what we can do!!!!"
Anyone who cares about the climate must vote for Joe Biden | Opinion
Hopefully President Biden will tear all that shit down
It'll be fun seeing President Biden having him removed
You are correct. This is all for politics by white liberals. No social cause and the news is fake also. Will stop reporting On The fake virus is Biden was to win.
Those same people will still exist, regardless of who is in the Oval Office. Things will not be better under Biden either.  Honestly? I wish  or  were running. Or  We need people of reason and real morality representing us.  #GodHelpUs
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Obama was the asshole that brought us Biden. Don't celebrate him.
"Republican presidential nominee Tom Cotton slams president Biden on continued economic decline 'We had excellent growth under Donald Trump until the pandemic, which was out of his control, it's time to get things back on track'"
She moved to more progressive policy, but ran on not being Trump. It happened. Think about why you don't remember that. Biden is winning now because of the state of things. He has to seal the deal by running on policy. Policy that is popular around the country.
I do. The policies are moving in the right direction and I look forward to pushing biden more. But, he's not running on the policy, so unless you're a political junkie like me, you have no idea. He's running on "returning the soul" and not on what he's going to do.
i fucking hate kanye. i dont care what any of yall have to say and “wanting to see the best in him” is dumb because he’s done nothing but praise trump and now hes “running” for president just to take votes away from biden
he is so disgusting.  i had a major, and when i was i physical therapy, had to learn how to walk, they gave me a cog test.  it tests small nuances in your brain memory, logic etc.  the words were not related.  he is such a smuck.  vote Biden.
Said no one. Trump has 96% republican support. Biden has the bot vote down tho.
He got criminal justice reform done, funded HBCUs, had the barest job market for African Americans and is now protecting them from white democrat voters who are rioting. Biden voted in crime bill in the 90s and molests black children who he thinks are dumb.
I discovered  while investigating the ff article. It rates news sources for 'factuality' and bias. Great tool for seeking the truth.  Biden’s campaign is ‘suppressing the Hispanic vote’ in Florida, an internal letter claims
extremely excited for these people to explain why it's not only okay but actually very good when this stuff gets worse under Biden
Someone should do a write-up with some suggestions about how the Biden Administration will wokely justify a foreign invasion, and which opinion-column slobs will immediately support it

Yes, I’m on the ballot in Utah. Looking for a running mate in Colorado—already paid the filing fee. Challenging Biden for the Dem nomination as an Independent.
fake news, they count BLM donations as Biden donations
Question: When I vote for Green Party in November, if Biden wins the election, will my vote be considered a vote for Biden or will it still be a vote for Trump?  Curious at how this vote-shaming thing works in case I need to use it in the future.
I mean you was cutting it to Trump as if Joe Biden don't do anything different for Black People Democrats Republicans different Jersey same team both of them are two different sizes of white supremacy
Sweetie both parties are white supremacist Neither party is going to do a damn thing for Black People You bring up reparations and Joe Biden's bitch ass Stars dancing
Not a fan of trump or Biden but I bet harambe will have gotten more votes in 2016 than Kanye will in November
I have a joke about biden, but I don't think it will get the job done.
Can you explain your reasoning? Biden's not in charge of anything, so I don't understand why school closure would be a negative for him.  Trump is in charge of the pandemic response. This is his baby.
PPP loans wen to small business also. Lots of them. That is a fact. Your are a bad liar. If he was dancing to dem tunes you’d be wanting him to do your wife right now. He not voting Biden so he ain’t black give white libs ability to be openly racist now. 😂
Biden is a tainted candidate from a tainted party.🇺🇸👎🏾
Joe Biden is a tainted candidate from a tainted party.🇺🇸👎🏾 #Biden2020
there's a difference between biden telling people not to turn up and trump just being shit
Saw you on “ReidOut” You’re right Biden  needs to “show up” on daily briefings for the next 100 days. It could change the narrative. I hope he takes your advice. We’re all in this together thanks for speaking out. Your words resonated. #Focused
8 of those 11 years were Obama and Biden’s.. didn’t do shit then, won’t do it now..we need more manufacturing jobs that pay. Real wages and don’t send them overseas
I have a Joe Biden joke but you just wouldn’t understand it..
No. As a compromise, Biden will tweet less.
yes when Biden is president
Surely your not talking about our President, Biden, Pelosi, Schumer....Now they are all EVIL!!!!
I would think it would be the other way around. More Biden signs than Trump. “ Go Figure “!
You missed the part where biden was the main cause of the war on drugs and mass incarceration for black people. He didnt want to be in a "jungle". Also, that was your boy Obama that signed the NDAA into law in 2013 allowing federal agents to literally abduct anybody.
Just to be clear, I am not FOR Biden...I’m just strongly AGAINST Trump. Don’t get it twisted. #againsttrump #DumpTrump2020
You're being told what to wear and not wear. You're being told where to go and where not to go. You're being told who can work and cannot work. I hope everyone has enjoyed this little socialism experiment because if Biden gets elected this will be our country from here on out.
Yikes. All these people blaming some dude in government for 3 years when Biden has 5 decades under his belt and only the 94 crime bill to show for it. 🙄 Protip research the 94 crime bill. Also did people forget Obama is the dude that made it possible for him send the fed police?
I hear Iraq is full of Joe Biden's compassion and empathy these days
how did the government handle Occupy, Ferguson, and Standing Rock during the "Obama-Biden" administration?
With Biden...youbetcha.
Critical support to Comrade Biden in his war against the suburbs (?)
Right? Every response he had was either "theres no proof/that was easy to fake" or "but Biden also...".
Oh I'm not disagreeing Biden is a shitshow. And you wanting to date your cousin is different from a sexual attraction to your own daughter. Both are problematic, though.
Biden is our President von Hindenburg yeah
95yo WWII vet: "When I was a paratrooper jumping over the Rhine River into Germany...I knew the Commander-in-Chief was standing with us...Sadly, with the knowledge that Russia can kill American troops with impunity, today’s soldiers cannot say the same."
No way BIDEN could do it
But just to be clear, you're still saying that all the women who have made sexual assault allegations against Joe Biden are liars, right?
Nobody voting for BIDEN  Nobody  #ImVoting4BidenBecause
No.  It won't.  Both sides LOVE to try  to get their voters to fear the "other side" because then you can be as corrupt and shitty as you want, and they'll still vote for you.  Dems do it too, or we wouldn't have Biden.  #BothPartiesSuck  #VoteThirdParty
Nope. Same question to you but about Obama, Biden, Clinton...basically anyone you don't personally know who you don't agree with.
*Takes a video of Trump’s America* this is Joe Biden’s America
Remember when Obama the Kenyan used to go off script?? 😂 Iiiiii, if if if if, iiiii okey doke folks! 😂 he was coke junky mess.  is a very stable genius. Now how about your candidate Biden? He wears a mask so they can dub in his voice 😂
If we would have a leader like Biden China would have sent millions of infected to us. I bet you called him racist for shutting down air travel to China! 😂 what ever the news feeds it sheeps.
Obama tho? Biden tho? 8 years bro?
You you answer a question with a question? Seems all you are trying to do is misdirect the conversation away from the fact that Biden is in decline.These guys think Joe Biden isn't competent enough to be president
Unfortunately these are our only viable choices.   Regardless, neither will be in office for more than 4 years.   Someone with Biden’s experience is needed to Jean up trumps mess, then let’s work to get someone younger.
Ya, she claimed to know him personally, too. As she did with Joe Biden &amp; said he gave his personal cell phone number! 🤣
They don’t want a recession you idiot!  That hurts everyone except the rich!   Trump and his mishandling of covid has caused this recession.   Obama and Biden fixed the economic collapse from bush and now trump has ruined it again.   He is incompetent and failed this country!
Biden is a bad candidate...but if this pro life, pro gun, pro free market constitutional conservative can plug his nose and vote to save our republic from Trump, so can every liberal. Dems better SHOW UP to vote, or you can bet I will never waste my vote again.
I predicted this is how it would end up 2 years ago and is why I am glad I supported and campaigned for  The Sanders campaign got absolutely nothing out of the Biden campaign besides a lot of tears and broken hearts. This #SettleForBiden sheep-dogging is pathetic!🤬
Whoopsies.  Joe Biden Criticized Trump’s Handling Of PPP Loans As His Son-In-Law Benefited From the Program | The Daily Caller
Biden’s pick for VP is... the dang Minions!?!
It would be great if Joe Biden wins bigly on Nov 3rd with the in person voting and then watch trump beg to have the “mail in” ballots counted. And then just watch a slow motion landslide!! Is anyone willing to vote in person to get this done? 864511032020 🌊🇺🇸❤️✊🏿✊🏾✊🏽✊🏼✊🏻
Does Biden know he's running for President yet?
Moms for Biden? Dear God! Guess they like the idea of a strange creapy old guy groping their little gils and them,even with the camera rolling. Strange bunch they are!
Whatever it takes.  I’m good with. It will take a while to fumigate.   Hope they start packing the tacky decor they have.  Biden then immediately needs a ceremony putting up Obama’s picture.
Well you do know that Biden is not the current President right. We know that because Biden would have done something in the first 70 days when COVID-19 hit. So why is it up to Biden to go out &amp; take a chance on catching #TrumpsVirus When Biden get's into office it will be better!
false
She’ll fit right into Joe Biden’s “who am I and why am I here” administration.
Look at Obama and Biden’s record!   He inherited a horrible economy from bush and turned it around.   Now another republican has screwed not all up again.   Time for a Democrat to fix it again!    Look at the past presidents.   Dems fix it repubs tank it!
Chip in to elect Joe Biden
Trump campaign temporarily halts TV advertising in Michigan, but plans to outspend Biden 4-1
Like Biden and Obama?
The Greatest Dealmaker in History is a total fraud. Jared thought unleashing the pandemic on Blue States was a good strategy Ivanka poses with a can of beans Jr used $75,000 taxpayer money to shoot sheep  Time to kick them out and replace with Joe and Jill Biden  #ONEV1
That’s why Joe Biden hired 600 lawyers, wasn’t it?
Biden thought he was at the beach
I love how dems let city’s get destroyed and blame trump. Biden doesn’t support 🏳️‍🌈 and people aren’t black enough but it’s trumps fault for racism and hate. Gtfoh
Biden better worry about if he’s even Real. The vaccine is a joke for a joke pandemic.
Biden is a token
Do you mean “legally” stop Trump from stealing the election?  All options should be on the table since The Donald will declare a Biden victory illegal.
If you're going to treat us like the Republicans are treating us, you can watch support for Biden evaporate. I didn't donate what little money I have just to elect a Trump Clone. No more donations from me until you change your platform.
The Background Influences of GPB Capital Holdings: Hunter Biden, a Jeffrey Epstein Associate, a Biotech Company, and a Russian Mob Connection.
So Pelosi becomes President per the Constitution and Trump can go pick weeds in the parking lot while she schedules a do-over if it needs to be done. Or Biden takes over. In no way does this work.
What does it matter? What does it matter if it's Biden or a wooden Indian? The oligarchy rules, not our elected (ha ha) leaders.
So the  is getting more help from Russia. Nice that the  is funded &amp; paid for by Putin. The  are nothing but TRAITOR'S!    I guess they figure Russia helped in 2016 so they might as well help in 2020!
Obama and Biden handed trump the record high stock market and record low unemployment!   Check the facts!   Obama felt with viruses too but he listened to the experts and did the right thing.   trump created the problems here and still refuses to try to fix it.   He’s incompetent
If you vote for Biden America will look like Trump’s America not the best message
trump skated along on the work Obama and Biden did.  What has he done to react and correct the problem? Tell Americans to buckle down and fight this virus together to help the economy?  Nope! He had time to prepare prepare but called it a hoax.   He’s incompetent and ignorant!
I think she means so Biden can put a replacement for her on the SC, not a Con.
I don’t know one mom that is going to vote for Trump. They are all voting for Biden. And here in Grand Rapids Michigan, I don’t know one teacher that wants to teach in three weeks or one parent that wants to send her children to school in three weeks.
What Biden does right - is always get it wrong.   #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica
Or, we should just have Trump and Biden stop campaigning and spend the rest of the time hearing what 3rd Party and Independent candidates have to say.
If this election is done honestly, it’s not going to be close. There’s not one person that is excited to vote for Joe Biden. Everyone who does vote for him will have this uncomfortable feeling. The guy is cenile.
I actually believe that if Joe Biden wins the Presidency and dotard declares it illegitimate I believe the entire Govt will obey the new President and drag dotard &amp; his toadies out GLADLY, including military and Secret Service #thebeat
Biden is better than trump in every  way!  trump has destroyed the economy, has millions unemployed, has killed 150,000+ and still hasn’t acted to correct any of it.  He’s a disgrace and a total and complete moron!! Also, 20,000 lies in less than 4 years and is Putin’s puppet!
I think that they are setting Michelle up for the old bait and switch with Biden, I think He will drop out for medical reasons and she will step in to 'save' the election. This will happen at the last possible moment and the Media will glorify her and this move . I hope I'm wrong
Anyone want to bet Biden never debates TRUMP on stage ?
Biden during the debates if he manages to wiggle his way out of them.Gasping for air and thoughts that aren't related to smelling girls hair.
Inserted a pic of Biden? Who's reaching now?
If Biden picks that black widow and wins the election ,he won't last 10 months and she will be in Power. And THEN she will bring the horror show to America and reign down terror from coast to coast .
What about Quid pro Joe Biden being under investigation by Ukrainian officials. That's going to bite him for sure.Trumps going to est Bidens lunch if Biden ever debates TRUMP. Biden will wiggle his way out of it so how..mark my words..it will happen.
I noticed Twitter pulled all the less flattering gif's of Biden down..wonder why.
From 6 yrs ago with makeup. Show me a pic of a Biden rally with more than 100 people.
He already passed it 😂 where you been? Biden refuses to take take the cognitive test and is hiding in his basement
It’s not Biden or Obama’s responsibility to do wither of those things.   They had been out of office for over 3 years.    trump is the one responsible!  All of this happened in his presidency.   He called it a hoax and made a virus political, not them! #TrumpVirusDeathToll150K
We all need to prepare ourselves for after the results. Because they will announce Biden as POTUS fraudulently! Biden is worse candidate than Hillary and TRUMP has amazingly more support than last time. It may result in a uprising! Which my cause bloodshed..hopefully not.
I don’t need to even watch. Trump can pass cognitive tests. Biden cannot. No debate. And for you to vote despite knowing that shows you do not have the ability to put your personal opinion of trump aside
Here’s a link for Biden’s coherent speeches. Enjoy peasant.
If Biden wins in November, watch the NYT do a fast about face in January and start crowing about how the danger is behind us now
Trump is the joke?? Biden can’t even speak a real sentence. You’re dismissed, child
Do 5 fucking seconds of research. Biden put forward the US crime bill which has played a role in the protests of today. He can't finish a sentence. He didn't support gay marriage until 2012, he told wall Street donors that "nothing will fundamentally change." We need real change!
What hate? Look at Biden’s racist quotes that never gain traction from the media ...  trump done way more for black communities thru employment than Biden has ever done
Seeing Trump shaking hands with incoming President Biden? Priceless. #WeWillVote
Why When  Makes Any Sence He Says He'll Do Whatever Trumps Doing to Unravel The F-Ups  Caused  Bidens A Fake! And Under Investigation In Ukraine  Biden/Obama Stole American TaxPayer Money And Ukrainian TaxPayer Money To Enrich The Rich  1 Billion Missing
Hello #Biden delegates, I am once agin urging you to pledge to vote against a party platform that doesn’t include medicare for all. Party platforms aren’t binding, but now is the time to fight for what’s right.
Moscow Mitch doesn't want to protect the workers.  Ted Cruz thinks $600 a week is too much money.  Joe Biden and the Democrats will protect the American worker and get them paid a living wage  #ONEV1
Yeah let's let her control the server for email election cuz we know that Hillary is so trust worthy. May as well just announce Biden President today if we allow that
He can't blame this on Obama or Biden. But I wouldn't be surprised if he tried.
Let's get one thing clear, I'm not voting FOR Biden in November, I'm voting AGAINST Trump, because he says shit like this that scares the hell out of me. He
Joe Biden and DNC: I want Joe Biden &amp; DNC to support &amp; enact Medicare for All - Sign the Petition!  via
No Deal. Go directly to jail and do not collect $200
Only would consider supporting this delay idea with 3 simple mandatory requirements: (1)  resigns; (2)  installed as VP; (3) immediately resigns upon Biden becoming #VP.
Weird new world, seeing Joe Biden interview pop up on What Up Moms youtube.
Not so sure about that. Biden is losing the middle fast. You seem worried and triggered again. Enjoy your day. 🤣
Maybe not but he WILL be escorted out when Biden is sworn in.  All power transfers and there are measures in place to assure that.  Trump will then be trespassing if he refuses to leave the WH. He'll be forcibly removed at that point.
That’s the only way Joe Biden hopes to win. But there is nothing impossible for God...
Biden is under investigation in Ukraine...... Where is Hunter ?
I’m realy tired of this bullshit claim that hydroxychloroquine hasn‘t been proven effective five against the virus! It’s all a scam to keep us in fear until after the elections are over (and they hope, a Biden win)  What happened to Our body, our choice?
Trump supporters be like, “Lolol, Joe Biden doesn’t know what room he’s in!” Gonna really bum you out then that Trump is so incredibly incompetent, he’s gonna lose to a guy who doesn’t know what room he’s in.
Someone at work just said they imagine Joe Biden's hair smells like an abandoned camper, and I can't stop laughing.
The Republicans and Fox treat the virus like a joke  that's why we need a Blue Wave and Joe Biden in charge  #ONEV1
BREAKING NEWS: Joe Biden picks Aunt Jemima to be his running mate.............#VoteRED2020RemoveEveryDemocrat
I can’t wait to see your face when Biden wins the election. Trump can’t even fill a small broke down arena, he certainly won’t secure enough votes to win the election. Perhaps he has a chance, but not with how he’s handled COVID. Sad day for the republicans.
Biden would be licking the shit out of her.  That is funny
This was so enjoyable to watch. I’m so sick of the double standard of today’s so-called press. BTW have you seen the softball press questions given to Joe Biden?
Trump vs. Biden: Where they stand on health, economy, more
I’m a delivery driver in W MI since C-19 started.. I see hundreds of #Trump2020 signs/flags everyday.. Only 2 Biden signs in months.. Greetings
Biden literally didn’t know where he was during a public address today 😂 Hillary - now Biden 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂
you can say whatever you want about biden, i’m sure i feel the same way and have thought the same things. the DNC makes me want to boil over. In the end though, there’s just too much to lose
Angela Davis considers biden the candidate more effectively pressured by the left - this is true. It’s easier to mobilize the left under a continuing (even worsening) neoliberalism than fascism
busted my ass for bernie in feb/march and after losing michigan told myself i wasn’t voting biden.   I’ve changed my position, and you should consider doing so too if you haven’t already
I have two issues when I hear "This will be the most important election in American history." 1: The DNC gave us a piece of shit that is just a bit shinier than Trump &amp; calls him watermelon sugar &amp; 2: Biden is going to do one iota better than Trump. Maybe two iotas, we will see.
You are so off on this buddy!  You can thank the #DemsAreDestroyingAmerica #GeorgeSoros for paying for all these idiots to do this!  TRUMP HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS!  BIDEN HAS EVERYTHINGTO DO WITH THIS! and it is about NOV!
Hoping Biden doesn't pick Whitmer as I'd like to see her stay Michigan's Governor for at least 2 more years thru this virus.
Since when does anyone vote based on the VP?  If one truly believes having Harris or any other Biden pick as a VP is WORSE than having trump as president then they aren't a dem and they sure as heck ain't progressive.
Is somebody actually talking in his ear or is Biden hearing voices? I’m serious
My friends son is taking part in a social experiment. He has to wear a Biden 2020 t shirt for 2 weeks and see how people react. So far he's been spit on, punched, and had a bottle thrown at him! I'm curious what will happen when he goes outside.
The Dems are just sweating about the #Durham report! I can’t wait hear this, it’s like Christmas. I bet the Obamas and Biden’s are sweating through their undies !
Excellent! Hopefully he has given up on winning Michigan!
Just went on a walk around my neighborhood and noticed that there was still a Bernie sign in every third yard or window (an occasional Warren sign too).  To this day, I have yet to see a Biden yard sign anywhere
I agree that Biden could end up being worse... but we KNOW what Trump is doing, and how far he wants to go. I'd rather take a risk on someone who MIGHT care enough about his image to at least not be as bad as Trump would definitely be.
I'm not voting for Biden to materially help anything. I'm voting for him to not genocide brown people in cages, or send federal stormtroopers into our cities, and so on.  This isn't about making change, it's about minimizing the damage that gets done while we fight for change.
No, voting won't bring real change, at least not in the current system... but it can be a way to keep people as safe as possible while we ALSO work to make real changes. Biden won't bring any real systemic change, but he will at least do less harm than Trump. That's not nothing.
Biden is shit, but Trump is far worse, and while I'd much rather send a message to the Democrats that they need to move left or keep losing, the damage caused by another four years of Trump is a greater harm than that caused by giving in to the Democrats' manipulation.
when I think of presidential nominee joe biden, I think of lang syne (old)
biking around my city, I still see literally dozens of Bernie yard signs but not a single Biden sign. wonder if this means anything
Taking a wild guess in saying that Biden asked Reagan’s family for permission, something Trump never did &amp; tried to profit off of.
I’ll be doing exactly this out in my street for days after Biden wins!
I disagree with that assessment of Biden.
Y’all might not know this, but the current presidential nominee was also a Vice President. His name is Joe Biden. Was he also too ambitious, or is that something we only say about women??
yeah. Khive was getting too riled up over this.
Joe Biden = a fighting chance against global warming. That's the tweet.
So...I was told to ignore what Donald Trump had to say about women a few years ago.  But, he's running ads in Michigan showing what Joe Biden said in...1987.  The mental gymnastics it takes to be a partisan is incredible.  I'm willing to say they both suck.  #Trump #DonaldTrump
Trumps comments about the low income housing, just made me pick up the phone &amp; donate more money to Joe Biden!!!
The election is going to be crazy I believe. Biden will be announced POTUS fraudulently and the mail in ballots will take forever and cost too much so they will say theres going to be a better way next election. Biden is worse than Hillary was and TRUMP has more supporters.
I do hope Biden wins, Dems take the Senate, and we all breathe a little easier after the inauguration. However, if the Dems think all they have to do is appear to be nice ... well, no. They’re dead wrong. The big machine is the problem.
Trump is good for America. Biden would be a disaster.
All I really learned from this story is that at least five people don't want Harris to be vice president, and that at least three of them donated money to Biden. I'm guessing you could make that same Claim about literally everyone who is being considered.
I think Harris isn't the best choice anyway.  I think the battle in the swing states is closer than we've been led to believe and a radical leftist from California will not help Biden in those states, regardless of her color.
People are cautious because she went pitbull on Biden. Biden needs a pitbull on his side. He needs to stick to the empathy card and let Harris fuck people up for a living.
Chris Wallace has the most journalistic integrity on that network. If he can take the sitting President to task, Biden shouldn't be worried about any slanted questions.
I'm sure when Biden takes over every last one will be removed. I bet right now he is already working on &amp; has contacted all the people he wants.
You mean like you do whatever Papa Putin wants?    FYI, think you are way off on VP Biden, he is his own man who knows how to create a good consensus &amp; compromise in government. He will heal the nation
Stacey Abrams touts Biden plan to support minority-owned businesses with Michigan entrepreneurs
Voting based on race is not in anyone's best interest.  If I vote Biden because he's as pasty faced as they come, I'm voting higher taxes, fewer Constitutionally protected rights, and less justice for Americans.  That doesn't seem like a good idea.
Bull it will never happen! He’s done more for this country than the last ten Presidents! Vote for Biden vote for communism and a nursing home resident! Vote for Biden is a vote for crooked Hillary and our country turning into the Deep States agenda. WAKE UP
They had 8 years of Obama/Biden which gave us DJT!!
I think we just found Biden's VP.
Not a terrible question. Should we ask the same question about Mr. Biden? Seems more than fair to a reasonable person.
Joe Biden says he'll announce vice president pick in first week of August
Sad thought I just had, Joe Biden couldn't even make this walk in any sort of reasonable pace without help, and that's now. What's Joe going to look like in 2-3 yrs?
So is the DNC's and Joe Biden's platform for the 2020 election "At least we're not Trump"?  Because with all the progressive policies the DNC is against that their constituents are in support of, it sure as fuck feels that way.
Michigan Threatens to Slip From Trump as He Goes Quiet on Airwaves - The New York Times
The Democratic Party doesn’t listen to its more progressive leaning voters; it only nominated Joe Biden to win some moderate votes. Moreover, the party is evolving and unless they can convert moderates, they will begin to lose votes to people that don’t identify as socialist.
I swear to fuck if Biden picks Kamala as his VP I'm going Green.
Oh yeah Hillary. Obama and Biden did such a great job in 2009 with the Swine Flu and you did such a great job with Benghazi. Get real. Nobody is buying your BS.
Remember the first Men In Black? The little alien inside the human shell?  Biden's little guy is from Uranus.
Biden day? Looks like Joe and his staffer.
God, you are just so childish and unintelligent.  I cannot WAIT for President Biden.  At least he can communicate and has empathy.  Something you will never have.
"She will vote for Biden in Michigan – another key swing state Trump narrowly won in 2016 – and harbors hopes of one day running for elected office."  More losses for Trump amongst his 2016 base and in the swing states and more gains for Biden  #ONEV1
Joe who? You're surely not talking about Creepy Joe Biden?
Yeah, but Biden and the Democrats never do what they promise at election time. They don't have to. Fools, like we used to be, vote them back in anyway. They don't even try. Bernie would have, and still does.
Pure evil is neoliberal Democrats promising to improve things but never following through because they serve the oligarchy, not us. And Biden is one of the worst at that.
Biden is the antithesis to Bernie. He is all that's bad in politics. So never.
The part where Biden is much better.
She already gave up &amp; endorses leg-hair biden
‘Do not hold grudges’ against Kamala Harris: Biden speech notes caught on camera
I'm an amalgamation of every emotion. Once Biden is sworn in and Donald's treason team are in prison, then I will level out.
This makes me happy 😊  I don't even care if its wrong!
My money’s on Connie. Biden will spin the shit outta it.
Biden is a corrupt, dementia riddled, pedo, who will allow Antifa to burn down any semblance of justice.
Joe Biden shared this post earlier, do I look like I know what I'm talking about?:
This man is the absolute lowest of low. I mean Schumer is on a pedestal compared to Nadler. Is there no level credibility or decency anymore - Nadler, Biden, Pelosi, Schumer are all examples of why there should be single term limits.
I'm volunteering for Joe Biden on the Vote Joe App. It only takes a few minutes–check it out!
Oh hell no lol voting for Biden is like shooting yourself in the foot.
Oh look!   is running Russian Active Measures on Biden.   What a surprise.   Chris is a Russian Asset
Biden is announcing his running mate next week I can’t breathe
Well I guess seeing how old Joe Biden isn't a hunched over old geezer I can vote for door #1.
No it would hurt the Democrats. People would really start to see how crazy they really are. How they want the country to be in unrest. They think by doing this they can send in Joe Biden and think people will say( Oh that you Slow Joe). He will not help our country at all.
Its always someone else's fault when you tRump's break the rules. And the only 1 taking away people's voices is your daddy. Please know we will remember on November 3rd when we vote for Joe Biden.
I don't care who Biden picks for VP. They are all good choices. I'm voting blue down the line.
Robert Mueller and Joe Biden have a lot in common. They are both past their intellectual prime and easily manipulated by aggressive ideologues on their team. #JoeBiden2020
Did you hear the clapping after Joe Biden’s softball press conference that left everyone dumber. It’s hilarious! Tells the whole story.
Biden Just said he hasnt been tested So wouldn't thatbe a pretty good  indication that COVID-19 isnt that infectious? I mean hes been hiden biden. He says the name of reporter scans his sheet for what his answer to the question.  Biden is a joke!
They shouldn't be able to reclaim their time this is nothing but a witch hunt.  This is insane.  Covid is under control, Now you have idiot Biden! Touting #s that would have saved lives!? Are you EFFING kidding me.  Let's talk ab oi it #KillerCuomo #Killeand the 1000s he killed
I thought there was no way they don’t replace Biden, like you. But he says Biden is it!
Do you watch the dilley show? He made a really good argument that Biden is their candidate because it’s too late for them to switch. He said they would have done it a long time ago.
I think the reason Obama has been seen constantly with Biden this past week is because in the next couple of weeks, Biden will announce his running mate.  Michelle Obama
Can anyone make sense of what joe Biden was just saying?? I can’t! 😳
Um hum. And it's going to get worse.  Good. Nothing but disaster will wake people up. Trump has made good progress toward disaster, and Biden won't help a thing.
Why is fox entertaining Biden questions from hand picked reporters of the house circus with Barr?
Joe Biden is A  Globalist And His Regulation And Taxes will Destroy America!!!!
Why When Biden Says Anything That makes Sence  Trumps Already Doing It!
Ok so I just flipped over to Fox to see what they were saying about the hearing &amp; they are showing Biden talking to reporters after his conference. Did Fox not show the Barr hearing today at all? Just wondering if they were trying to hide it from their base?
Despite disagreeing with #Biden on everything from guns to taxes to abortion, he has my vote.   We won't have a USA if we don't eliminate Trumpism from our republic.  Unlike the Trump cult, I know my vote's flawed, but Joe has 0 ability to invoke violence by tweet. #Biden2020
hey CNN, I love &amp; support Joe Biden, but, I have been enjoying watching Barr get ate alive in this hearing! Please turn it back to the hearing! Wth???
Now on a break and blow hard Biden is saying nothing

Oh, I blocked him a while ago.  I'm all for green party but it's either Biden or Trump.  If we get Biden, then possibly in 4 more years we can vote for the green party. But if we get Dumpy, we won't get that option.

I'm just glad we have VP Biden running for the DEMS or I might have had to vote for Kanye because I could never vote for Trump
Biden delegates: I‘m making a desperate plea. PLEASE sign the letter pledging to vote nay to a party platform that doesnt include Medicare for all. The Democratic Party needs to stand for and defend everyone, and during covid that is especially apparent. We need bold legislation.
Obama announced Biden on Aug 23, 2008 and Hillary announced Kaine on Jul 22, 2016.   I think we are all desperate to hurry up, get this election over with, and get the orange menace out of office.   Be patient.
Biden has been a public servant for his entire career.  Why on earth would you think he'd "turn into an asshole?"
What makes ppl so sure Biden gon save America ??
Hear me out... What if, instead of an election between Trump and Biden, we held a nationally televised, to-the-death cage match. Then, the winner gets a life sentence for murder and we all elect someone who's not completely insane.
The “Vote Biden or Trump will win” mentality is only helping them block others from debating!! #NotAWastedVote #LetHerSpeak
Do you actually think "The Left" has a candidate? The election is the middle vs. the right. The middle is bringing the left along. If Biden can fill a cabinet without selecting people who plead guilty to federal crimes he has my vote.
Joe Biden is so powerful that even when he's sleepy he can still destroy suburbs and burn cities to the ground 😂
Thank God you'll be gone soon! This won't happen on Biden's watch, you can be assured of that! When we get rid of you, we'll get rid of all the violent protestors.
Wish Biden could have in person rallies just so we could use the “LOCK HIM UP” cheers!
Did you feel that way when Obama and Biden were in office for 8 years before trump?   I was never worried one day with them in charge.   It will be nice to go back to sanity, competence, and “boring”.
You keep pushing this narrative that Joe Biden will destroy America, that he'll allow China to run all over the US, that there will be riots etc. This is your Presidency, this is happening now. This is what you are doing! #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
To vote for Biden is to give in to the terrorists causing all this unrest! That is simply stupid! Trump is uncovering the evil and they don't like it! #Trump2Q2Q
Joe Biden should choose Condoleezza Rice as his VP.
the only person from Biden’s campaign taking,  is his wife . #whereisjoe
You assume an honorable man like Joe Biden has the slightest care what a pissant like you has to say about anything. You disappearing from public view will be just one more benefit of your daddy losing in November.
We will see what he can do after November. Guess we just gotta ride it out. He won't risk Biden getting in office over a building. Or even officers lives.
We will, November 3rd when we vote for Joe Biden.
If I was the President, I would have a hard time not laughing at biden the entire debate.
All of you suburban residents across all of this great country need to familiarize yourselves with AFFH. It will transform your lives in unbelievable awful ways. Please watch Life,Liberty and Levin episode of 7/26/20. Biden is for this travesty.
It's not extreme. Why won't you people get that. So many countries have a single payer system, the only reason this hasn't passed is because corporations run this government. And that won't change under Joe Biden. His health care plan will leave millions uninsured. That's wrong!
And all my friends say we have to vote Biden because it’s the right choice?
If Biden won't debate Trump then there is no vote and Trump remains president
Biden is a chicken shit and won't debate Trump  No debate .... No vote.... And Trump remains president
Then why did you immediately back Biden and not Bernie?
The same people who tweet for biden...
Biden being weird towards kids.... all of this is bad! Ffs do you hear yourself? Take the red pill bud (I’m not asking you to smoke trumps pole, I’m just asking you to wake tf up) 🤦‍♀️
Scratch and sniff “Biden 2020” bumper stickers would kill this cycle.
● End violence against women. ​Biden will work to end violence against women, continuing his leadership on this issue since he authored the Violence Against Women Act in 1994.
● Help women navigate work and families. ​Biden will expand access to affordable child care and care for older Americans and people with disabilities, and provide paid leave and other important workplace benefits and protections.
● Expand access to health care and tackle health inequities. ​Biden will expand access to high-quality, affordable health care for all women.
● Improve economic security. ​Biden will start by fighting for equal pay, investing in women-owned small businesses, expanding access to education and training, and strengthening pay and benefits in careers disproportionately filled by women.
Biden will never have a chance without a debate,’live interviews and appearances. If they think he can win without showing his face and hiding him in a basement, they’ve lost their mind!
You saw the footage of Biden smelling children, right? Come on Chris, this country is weak because we are divided. 😐
I know they’re not going to let Biden debate, but I wish they would. That would be the best tv of the century. Hilarious! Can you imagine! Every second would be recorded by millions!

Biden has already won the election fraudulently. Counting all the mail in ballots will take forever and cost too much so Biden will be announced POTUS and theres going to be a better way to count votes next election.This may lead to a uprising which bloodshed. Possibly TRUMP 2020
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Good - don’t be a hypocrite like Pelosi, Nadler, Schumer, Biden, Obama and the rest of them.
They will announce Biden as POTUS and theres going to be a uprising and blood might be spilled. Its going to be crazy !
Biden has already won the election fraudulently..mail in ballots will take forever and cost too much and they will say theres going to be a better way next election. Biden is worse candidate than Hillary was. TRUMP has more supporters than last time.
Strangely, instead of taking credit for gains by women in education during Obama’s tenure (even if Obama did nothing to achieve this), Biden pretends as if nothing good happened for women during the Obama years...why?
Who will be Biden's pick for VP?
LOL. Dem Party Porn. Why is no one asking what Biden will do when he loses?
They are undersampling Rs. There was a pushback tweet from someone about the number of Rs who voted in 2016 and 2018. It was well over 30%. Trump has a near perfect approval rating with Rs, so these numbers are pretty much impossible. It would mean Biden taking ALL indies. LOL.
This crap isn’t being written by Biden, and this will come ou time!   couldn’t write a children’s book, let alone any legislation. His team is trying to hide him in the basement.
LoL, why isn’t Biden discussing this ? You people suck and you’re hiding Joe in the fucking basement . He’s not fit to serve,  should be coming completely ashamed or herself for letting this to continue. She will reap the rewards when this all comes out. Can’t hide it!
The specifics of population in Michigan that is more interesting to me are Sanders-Biden primary voters.
Biden's VP shortlist comes up short #SmartNews
Biden has already won fraudulently. Mail in ballots will take forever and cost too much to count. So they will announce Biden as POTUS. Biden is a worst candidate than Hillary and TRUMP has more supporters than ever.This will cause a uprising and blood might be spilled.
This Short Video Exposes Everything That Is Wrong With Biden's Green New Deal
Allow me to clutch my metaphorical pearls about the (presidential) ambitions of a strong Black woman. 🙄  ⁦ for VP!
Lets start a pool to see who gets indicted first . Hillary is probably a front runner , Obama is slippery so he may be back in the pack ,Peter s. and Paige will sing to stay free longer . so Biden is a fall guy . he wouldn't know it anyway. just give him a TV playin sesame street
You won't see Biden supporters in a boat rally, the fires are to hard to start on the lakes and rivers . !😄
We all want Biden to win.  FYI
That’s BS ... you people are pathetic!  Trump is doing exactly what he promised he would do... Draining the swamp! Obama, Biden, Clinton, Pelosi and the list goes on... They are the beginning of the end of the Deep State Cabal!  Research!
I don't want to live like a prepper, but logically, if Biden wins, there is truthfully no explanation other than fraud. If Trump wins, the meltdown will make 2016 look like a 5yr olds playdate.
Hey bumb ass, we saw what 8 years with Biden was and we welcome that back again.   Once again it will take a Democrat to come in and repair the damage from a republican.   Bush destroyed the economy and so has trump.   Biden did it before, he will do it again!
I haven’t seen a Biden sign any place? Are we even sure he will be on the ticket?
In Grand Haven I see tons of Trump flags on boats but no Biden flags 😆🤣
You better watch Mark Levin on Fox. If you live in the suburbs , the Dems have a big change planned for your neighborhood If Biden wins. Obama started it in Westchester,   NY. It’s called AFFH. LOOK IT UP!!!#Biden/Obama #corruption #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica
And when will we hear from Biden on Twitter and not his handlers?
The idea that funny Twitter handles and memes were ever going to be a significant factor in beating Trump is just ridiculous ... I honestly hope that if Biden wins he'll get sustained pressure from the Left, but it's going to take a lot more than social media shitposting.
Put the gummie bears down and back away from the sand box Joe Biden
Why would Biden go on Fox News. He does not hang with right wing Networks that are run by misogynistic white nationalists.
biden Will Never Be President
One less thing of Trumps that Biden will have to tear down! 👍
- enjoy your polls. However, one thing I haven't seen is a focus on the economy. The polls I have seen show that Trump leads Biden in this area. What makes anyone think this won't be the primary reason to vote for Trump, even if the other issues are at the forefront?
Biden is such a joke. Scripted video messages, teleprompter speeches, no press interviews or questions because he will screw himself over with gaffes or not get the radical left agenda right. This is your candidate?! He’s a freakin puppet!! What a joke.
I love that I haven’t seen Biden in the news and yet he’s still ahead in the polls lol the man has to literally just not die
Oohhh yes I’m ready!! Trump 2020 🇺🇸 If Biden wins Wowzers I’m scared 😦 people are off their rockers like he is!
I'm voting for Biden no matter who it is
Everybody talking about Covid-19, unemployment and bounties on US troops.  Let's not forget the tax cuts for the richest Americans, cutting food stamps during a pandemic, lying about Ukraine, golfing and saying things like "we shouldn't have courts."  Republicans out!  Biden 2020
It's gonna hit the fan whether or not Trump wins. If Biden wins, millions of legal gun owning Americans will rise up to defend Lady Liberty from the communists seeking to violate Her! At that moment, it's best that   "stand down" and let Americans clean house.
#YangGang your passion is needed once more. We are the wave that can still come crashing down. We will force the conversation about UBI, but right now we need UNITY.   candidates are running as dems Give them a fighting chance when they get elected and vote Biden.
I have a joke about Biden but I forgot it
If I was never going to vote for Biden in the first place how does my vote for Ye take away votes from Biden🤔
They got y'all trynna to make people vote for Biden out of fear. Tell me that's not facist
The Democratic party gave the election to Trump the moment they made Biden their candidate.  Congrats, yall gave up a sure thing in back to back elections
I think Joe Biden can chew gum and walk, so special prosecutor assignment, right after the inaugural luncheon, then work on the economy. But he MUST prosecute these crimes.
I have an idea. Lets get a candidate that people are actually excited about. I know many people that will vote for Biden, but I can't think of anyone I know that WANTS to vote for him.
Actually fox news is helping the left, changing voters to vote for Biden,  fox news is hilarious, we turn it into a drinking game lol
🤔🤪🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I've Never Met Anyone that's Voting Biden
I wish all 660 of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Dear Stephen, when this happens just remember they are watching fox "news" and have been brainwashed into thinking Covid-19 is hoax perpetrated by Biden and the Dems to make trump look bad. As if he isn't doing a great job all by himself.
Can Biden add something to his platform to get Fox off the airwaves and/or prosecute the Murdochs for all this crap?
Joe Biden’s latest add says he’ll clean up drinking water, funny how he easily could have helped Flint and didn’t but okay wait till you’re president to fix it that makes sense #shady
For me its 4 years for Biden. And then its #YangGang 2024
It’s “the real Donald Trump “ or the “senile Marxist Joe Biden”.  Not much of a choice.
Chances are good that Biden would become incapacitated during his first term. Is she really what you want running our country? This is for keeps folks - if you guess wrong you may not get another chance. You could wake up during your lifetime to a world with no USA. Then what?

Who's the dumbass that invited John Kasich to speak for Biden at the Democratic Convention?
From what I’ve learned on Twitter recently I think it has something to do with George Floyd being like Jesus 🤷🏻‍♂️ Kanye beating off Biden probably didn’t help either 🤷🏻‍♂️
Kanye is not running for president he’s just taking the black votes from Biden
Holy s*hit. Read the comments on this tweet by #Biden. The people voting for him want a $25/hr minimum wage, with no thought as to how businesses could afford to pay it. All they do is want everything given to them. Pathetic.
So the Obama/Biden policies then?  The trump policies did nothing but hand out tax breaks to the donor-class &amp; offer smash-and-grab bailouts to companies that moved jobs out of the US, regardless of the dog and pony show the admin tried to put on.
Ye&gt; Biden  But it’s still #maga
See how he said he can beat Biden instead of saying beat both Biden and Trump. Don’t fall for the bullshit.
If you like I will post receipts (videos &amp; quotes) to back up everything I said if you are as poorly educated as I suspect on Biden's history?
I've been counting signs also, no Biden signs to be found. So much for the polls. Just a welder in Michigan.
The Trump virus? Jesus Chris. Nixon, Clinton, Bush 1&amp;2, still weird flex but you do you. Are you voting for creepy Biden because of his politics or because he’s the only other option?
Joe Biden thinks unelected federal government bureaucrats, not elected municipal bureaucrats, should determine what kind of housing gets built. And a lot of taxpayers aren't happy about it.
He’s not wrong. You wanna see real dictatorship? Vote for joe Biden and watch what happens. Prison systems suck because of Biden

I have asked so many what biden has done for them and not one can answer. He has held an office for 40 years and still I can't think of one honest thing he has done. Ask you friend what Bernie has done for him
There’s a whole genre of conservative tweet right now where they show something terrible happening right now in Trump’s America and say “This is what Biden’s America will be like” and how do you even tie your shoes with that level of cognitive dissonance?
I've been trying to pick a fight with one of these biden lovers for over a month feel proud they are calling you names 😊😊
Tell me what biden has done for you? You like the riots? They are dem  run you know. You want high taxes or how bout we all just give our money to the government so we can get an allowance like children.  You don't like Trump but I bet you can't tell me why biden is great.
Every vote for someone not named Biden is a vote for Donald Trump.
Trumps the man!  I pray for our country he beats Biden the puppet and Shiny face Pelosi

#ICYMI: Radio host  goes off on Biden after calling Trump 'first' racist #POTUS
I know the #fakepresident is sinking fast in recent polls, but I can see the #Trump flags &amp; yard signs in West Michigan are far outnumbering Biden signs.  This area is quite conservative, but we all need to invest effort in our future.
but biden isnt ofc because thats who you support ah yes
Biden isn't popular because of something he did, he's popular in spite of trump.
#ICYMI: A new Fox News Poll released Thursday shows Joe Biden tops President Trump in key battleground states of Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania. More:
“If you’re having trouble figuring out if you can vote for me, you ain’t Catholic.” - Joe Biden
You should wait and see what this world will do when we have Joe Biden try to fix a terrible economy hit by this pandemic! I want u to think...Donald trump has successfully shown the world how to be financially stable! Before Obama I never even heard of Biden.
Biden said he lost a nit. Has no Idea when it happened. He does not remember when he was neutered.
People are asking, what are you all going to do with your efforts after Biden is elected?

I believe you. If we make it to election day,  great.. You will be president elect Biden. But between 3 November and 20 January, that is when it all hits the fan. tRump will burn this country to the ground. If not the world.   Do you have a plan for that?.

Biden is Dead Man Walking when the debates start.
I thought the same thing when you guys nominated Biden. “Really??”
"Joe Biden's VP to interview her husband..."  You heard it here first.
"What I think would pose a real problem is massive voter suppression. Literally preventing people from voting or their votes from being counted is the greatest threat to Biden, and to our democracy."  yep.
We have em already pelosi,biden etc.
Just wait until they start in on Biden if he's elected.
You just don't want him to debate period. Yoy know he couldnt even form a sentence!! What the hell has he ever done for you? I ask all you biden lovers that question and still nobody has a comeback for it. "Help us Joe, help us become socialists!!"
Sorry bud but there won’t be a country if Biden wins this election.

Nope. I have traveled all over the world. I have  learned to  recognize the truth. I think Biden will only be a puppet.  He isn't what we need. Its you that appears to be "brain washed" You need to look at the big picture. You rights are slipping away. You are handing them over.
20 January.. president Biden in the white house.
Damn Pence finally said something I agree with and that is the reason I'm voting for Joe Biden.
That’s right, we’ve taken control of VP Joe Biden. Once he’s in office, those of us in the radical left-wing mob are going to help him #MakeAmericaAntiFascistAntiRacist

At what point does this become a political donation to Biden?  I have seen multiple promoted tweets from the wapo, all glowing for joe.
I don't understand though. If that's the case, then why is biden's team allowing harris these events lately? Just saying...
Let’s go on the offense and talk about Donald Trump and all the good he’s done. Joe Biden is getting way to much hype and he doesn’t even have to talk!! Don’t you see what’s going on?
Joe Biden wants to become like Russia.
Not true! Bush destroyed the economy and caused high unemployment.   Biden and Obama turned that around resulting in record high stock market and record low unemployment, now because of trumps incompetence we have record high unemployment and a struggling economy.
I give this a 55% chance of occurring (aka, 55% chance Biden wins). It's always closer than anyone expects.

Very pleased to see that Biden is already anticipating these scenarios. That's leadership - seeing a threat on the horizon and doing the hard work to prevent it.

That's only four words! Anyone can remember four! I'll bet you or Joe Biden couldn't get five!
God save America from Biden
I believe Biden did a press conference saying all the things he would do. Funny thing is Trump has already done those things. And he wouldn’t take any questions. He had to rush to another event. Pretty sad events. 10 press journalists that aren’t allowed to ask questions.
And I agree Biden should be on TV every day and be the President. Many Americans are scared enraged feel hopeless and disillusioned with this country. #TheReidOut
I think Biden could do a remote debate and just have someone feed him answers via teleprompter (which the audience would not see). He might be able to pull that off.
I live in West Michigan. It's very much Republican territory. As a former Republican myself, I don't say that as a negative thing.  But this I can tell you: Trump will NOT perform well in many areas and former third party voters are jumping to Biden in droves.
I'm scared that we are going to keep telling people Biden is winning and people wont show up to vote. Just like 2016.
"Heres the deal..what is your name and why is it racism if its fucking true idiot or not a bad man and you give an excuse for that matter and you can do something about yourself or not just to make it through your own time to get it done!!!" Joe Biden 2020 #aintblack
I’ve never seen a Biden 2020 flag on a boat either!
Joe Biden, Obama and the DNC have always tried to neuter or destroy the progressive movement because it is counter to the interests to the corporations and oligarchs they serve. Ordinary people don't matter to them except as votes during election season.

Who is Biden?
Joe Biden has been a solid racist for so long that he does not even realize he is being a racist when he speaks , It is just second nature to him and he is oblivious to it. The media wants him to win so they will have news to exploit on a daily basis .
TRUMP 2020...BIDEN IS A COMMUNIST... HE WORKS FOR CHINA
Also, if you attention, you’re  welcome 🌻  While you’re processing, make sure you’re taking care of getting an absentee ballot so when you put your big boy pants on 😉 you can go vote for #BIden 🦋
I’m slow to process too when things don’t go my way, Sean. Take your time.....  Meanwhile, many #Resisters realize that the first step toward having an America to improve means getting #Biden elected.  The details can be sorted when the fire is out!!
This is now of how Quid pro Joe Biden is thinking everyday.
What flavor is the Biden cake?
This is literally trump’s America.     Yes, it is a very scary place, that’s why we he needs to go!   With Biden, no raging pandemic due to incompetence, no militarized secret police violating Americana constitutional rights, no traitor ok with bounties on American soldiers.
If President Biden's job isnt the toughest of any president at any time, I sure dont know whose would have been worse. The guy will have the pandemic of Wilson, the unemployment of Hoover, the economic problems of Obama, and the worst toxic partisanship ever.   All on Day One.
The problem with Donald Trump saying that riots and protests will be the new norm in Biden's America is that riots and protests are already becoming the norm in Trump's America.
It’s called No questions  ! TelePrompTer Joe Biden...... I can’t function without my wife typing for me!Donald Trump’s October surprise is going to be a deep fake of Joe Biden saying something horrific and there’s just nothing we can do about it
Tim.   Biden doesn’t know what his policies are yet.  He doesn’t have to do any thinking.  Whatever the corporate interests tell him to do he will.  Sad this man is the better of 2 options.  If these candidates were goods sold at market the companies would go bankrupt
He’s had enough time in politics to get things fixed. He’s failed. Move along Hiden Biden
And I don’t want to shame anybody but seriously you are telling everybody vote and you go into this whole but this is as good as we are going to get we shouldn’t question or demand more we just got to suck it up and vote for Biden because we got to take out Trump. 🙄No wonder
I mean this whole settling for less shit isn’t going to cut it everybody should be demanding that Biden and his team do better do something more beyond just giving us a story or a vague speech.
“With his dying breath he said, tell Obama to use my funeral for Biden’s campaign! Biden for president”🙄
I have a serious question so say Biden wins and Trump/his team is out what comes next so far what i hear is very vague. Okay you are going build back better so how are the Dems going to take back the house from the Republicants. Cause so far Joe isn’t for progressive policies
Biden doesn’t have dementia. Nor syphilis
Nobody noticed this but me I swear.. Joe Biden might have been right! 😆
I NEVER thought I'd say this but. Joe Biden was RIGHT!!!  😅😂😆  #YouAintBlack #blackface #ObaMAGAate #KAG2020 #JoeBidenIsARacist #ObamaWasBetterAtEverything Including Blackface!
Nah...he was allowed to say yes or no,they only gave him yes or no questions and refused to allow him to bullshit. Get used to it,after Biden wins there's going to be a whole bunch more questions...
Biden is like we need to grow and open the country well then if he believes that why is he against pushing and fighting for basic fucking needs like housing, healthcare, canceling student loans, etc etc?
Which, btw, is why it’s critical that Biden, if elected, doesn’t back slide into the neo-liberalism that’s defined the last 40 years of the Dem Party — its the only way to inoculate us from the threat posed by the coming generation of less managerially incompetent mini-Trumps.
This shit is just sad this lady obviously has issues and is all over the place I noticed that on her IG.  This is why It was crazy seeing people canceling Buttar without hearing out the whole story all while Khive and Biden supporters who talked so much
When you do voting to that extent, you're gonna find more leftists, you're gonna find more Biden, SO I SAY TO MY PEOPLE "SLOW THE MAILING DOWN PLEASE!"
Rioters and Looters for Biden.
Can you picture Joe Biden doing the state of the union address? 😂
News Flash!!!!!! More people are following Trump than Biden.
Follow along..... If hydroxichloroquin treats corona there’s no panic. If there’s no panic Americans go back to normal life. If Americans go back to normal life no mail in ballots. If there’s no mail in ballots Dems can’t cheat. If Dems can’t cheat Trump will crush Biden.  Simple
I can't even believe I am engaging you. Biden can complete sentences far better than your man can, put them side by side and watch. Pedophile background? Sthu. That is a lie.  Goodbye  back into your conspiracy theory room.
That Instagram account for Biden I have a feeling is run by Warren people.
Are people supposed to ignore that Biden is doing very little to earn their vote are they supposed to ignore thar the party just voted down on progressive policies like M4A, legalizing marijuana and against Palestine. I mean seriously do they think people are this naive?
Settle for Biden is a joke. Gtfoh. The instagram is ridiculous who is this made for how does this make Biden appealing knowing that he won’t even support progressive policies.
No Biden will look foolish.
President Trump comes up with these nicknames for his opponents. Sleepy Joe Biden, Crooked Hillary Clinton ,lying Ted Cruz. What does he call himself?Dandy Don?
Wow they are really desperate to get people to vote for Biden knowing he is a fucking disaster.
Biden is in no way a fucking leftist you fucking clown.
Have you heard Biden speak ?
Bernie really should stop defending the party after all the shit they did to him and honestly fuck Biden Obama and the DNC for ruining this election.
We have to fight up till election day like Biden is 20 points behind. Complacency is what cost Clinton the last election. Let's not repeat history. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
Joe Biden is about as radical as white bread.
Joe Biden is about as radical as unflavoured,oatmeal.
Joe Biden is about as radical,as vanilla ice cream.
Also, much respect for you and your beliefs . I also noticed the above comment and that you follow DJT but not Biden. Just curious as to why.
Biden and the Dems have a plan to set us back instead of moving forward and actually doing something for this planet and its people.
Nadler is a complete baffoon. Law and order, Dems don't want it and are willing to let law abiding citizens suffer just to get rid of Trump, enjoy your shitty utopia if Biden gets in, you'll regret it about 2 years in...
Not my reasons but, I guess it’s his reason and unless Biden wins, it’s still a free country!
UNBELIEVABLE isn't it. Besides Repunlican questions did Barr ever anwser a dem ? They cut him short. This was about Trump, almost like a campaign rally for Biden
Corporate interests own the DNC and their worthless Centrist candidates.  Biden voted against me and the working class for 40 years. My entire ballot here in Michigan will be straight GOP.  How in the hell did you fools nominate a Republican?
I am. Full ballot. Michigan a swing state. Straight Red until the DNC is dead.  Biden is a worthless corporate owned puppet.
Because I like Trump more than Biden.  Trump may actually be helpful in destroying the Corporate constructed sham of a Banking and Stock Market.  Imagine if he burned that crap to the ground?  No republicans would be elected for a decade.  Biden is worthless.
I’m not a democrat. I am an independent.  I vote for who I like better.  Honestly I hate both of these worthless fools. But we had a chance for change but we nominated a Republican.  Trump 2020 sucks but so does Biden 2020.
I guess if Biden started calling Covid a hoax I might just let the chips fall where they may, but I probably wouldn’t vote, I don’t think I could vote for Trump.
Trump does not support Medicare for all. Biden does not support Medicare for all.  I hate both of them. Coin flip. Brb..... tails.  Trump 2020. And they spend 100s of millions on tv commercials?
Sounds like real bullets will have to do. Joe Biden’s idea for police reform was to shoot for the legs right?
Joe Biden is as far left as Calvin Coolidge.Stop panicking and take your  good for you.
Well if Biden becomes president remember you said "No thank you!" Pack up and move!! Just remember you are a puppet too then!!
Biden is the Houston Astros of politics, he can only hit when he knows which pitch is coming next and they haven’t found a way to extort Chris Wallace into letting Biden’s team provide the questions for another fake interview.
Biden wouldn’t do your interview unless he’s allowed to provide you with the questions. He can’t hit the curve and the only way he can get to first base is if he gets hit by a pitch.
Joe biden even said we will have to remove trump by force.
Biden can even finish a coherent sentence. How is he going to run the country? How many years has he been in office, and what has he done for minorities? The first black president had done less than the current president for black people. Sounds like a no brainer.
What they need to do to Replace Biden with Bernie.
Like I said Bernie did a mistake dropping out. Biden played everybody with this task force shit it was mostly for show in order to get Bernie supporters to vote for him. Biden is garbage and so is the DNC.
And like the Republican party the    does not care about the people of this country. This is why I will not be voting for neither party in November just voting in August locally but fuck Biden and the DNC.
1000 people die a day in the US from Covid 19. 1660 a day from Cancer, 2353 a day from Heart Disease. Last winter 24,000-62,000 died in the US from the flu. Every 4 minutes someone in the US dies of a stroke. These numbers don’t scare me. Joe Biden in the White House does.
Because it’s not helpful and shows little of the reality of our political landscape. Biden will spend 4 years restoring calm and training his replacement. The VP choice is extremely important this time.
If you were voting for Joe Biden’s policies you are a Republican. I realize that is unnecessary and rude. I apologize. You can’t possibly be at fault that Joe Biden voted for and with the GOP for 40 fucking years. No your fault. Your a follower. Right off the political cliff
Big whip. Biden’s corporate owned ads is trying to get in the will
Not to me.  People die everyday. Hope your alright but I ain’t voting for Biden.
Ma’am. I wish you the absolute best life has to offer.  I’ve moved on from even considering voting for Biden.  Seriously though. Take care of your son and yourself. God bless
I do apologize about 3 responses. Soc security is the only thing I would vote to protect that we have now. Biden voted to cut it not once but twice.   No way I would ever vote Biden.
The phrase “Healthcare available to everyone “. Is a typical GOP or corporate response. It means it’s available to anyone who can afford it.  If you vote Biden you are voting for a Republican.  Wow would you look at that?  We’re both voting Republican in our own way. 👍🏻
I’m voting trump. It’s a more effective 🖕🏻to the DNC it’s Centrists.  Biden is worst nomination since Hillary. Yet another worthless Corporate owned puppet.
The good news is this. Trump will probably collapse the entire corrupt corporate owned financial system. Stock market too. I believe trump could screw up everything the GOP with Biden spent 40-50 years creating.  Biden wins..... who cares the misery will continue. Trump is a F up
MSNBC and CNN like to keep senior citizens money coming in.  If the seniors knew we won’t vote for Biden or any democrat without Medicare for all they might demand it. Since every senior in the country is already on it.
I’ll never vote for a centrist.  This is a pickle we are in here.  I no longer give a shit who the president is if we nominate republicans like Biden.  Tough tough spot.
No thank you to Biden. And every democrat on my ballot.
I’d be more worried that progressives believe you and Biden are just about as far right as Saager is.  Biden is a nasty Republican. Check out his voting record.  Biden is so shitty I’m voting GOP for the first time in my life. Eligible to vote since 88. Biden sucks
If trump is re-elected I hope the first change we see is no more centrist nominations.  If you nominate a Corporate owned puppet aka Republican in drag like Biden you can’t expect a rational person to vote for him.
Biden = sexual harassment pander 😆😆😆
George this guy in pic is someone you could follow to understand what you and others who want progressives to vote Biden are up against.  Ryan is plainly stating where I and many others are coming from.  Between Biden and Trump is see two idiots I don’t want as prez
Page 4.  With Corporate interest, Wall Street, and Banking industry turns their back on Biden who is paying for his re-election in 2024?   This nominee is doomed to fail. Corporate puppets can’t go against corporate interests.  Not enough citizens are excited about him
Page 3. Stock market goes down as profits shrink on stock market as a direct result of ending tax cuts.  Now Wall Street turns back on Biden.  Business owners will lay off workers too to try and back into a profit. Continued
Let’s say Biden wins.  Bush tax cut would sensibly be first change he would make.  Once that happens Corporate Interests turn their back on him. Why? They pay more taxes if he ends bush tax cuts. Pretty easy so far.  Continued
Yeah it’s always some excuse or distraction to keep bending us over for the corporate fucking we have been taking since the 70s.  I’m all for protesting.  Let’s not forget Obama and Biden has the first cages for immigrants.  Might be civil war 2 in the near future.  Continued
We nominated a Republican. Biden is to far right to earn my vote. Since there is only 2 candidates with a chance, I’m voting to cause a Biden loss.  Sucks I know. But the nominee sucks.
Because I’ve voted straight blue from 88-16 and the results are revolting.  We pay highest healthcare costs in the world. We pay astronomical prescription drug costs. We are ripped off by every industry because corporate owned politicians like Biden vote across the aisle with gop
I truly believe trump could burn down Wall Street and the banking industry if he has another 4 years.  Biden does as Corporate interests tell him. Trump does whatever he feels like that moment.  Kind of like giving a todddler a loaded gun. Continued
Trump is not taking this job seriously. He is just coasting through this like High School.  Biden has been blowing the 1 percent or corporate interests for 4-5 decades.  Biden couldn’t raise 1 million dollars from grass routes. Nobody likes him except fossils.  Continued.
Another custom design. This one for supporters of the Blue Wave movement. Vote Blue No Matter Who Wave T-Shirt  #BlueWave2020 #BlueWave #biden #vote
This is true.  Earlier in this thread I mentioned I’m voting for our funtioning moron of a President instead of Biden.  Biden is a filthy Republican who I can’t vote for.  Many Republicans are voting for Biden. Why do you think many Republicans are not happy with trump?
Our nominee Biden is Corporate Owned and can not under any circumstance Be trusted to side with the working class
Page 2.  Biden voted against me for 40 years siding with Republicans over the working class. Bernie fought for people his entire career.   Biden to me and many is a Republican.  You should not expect my vote on Nov 3rd.
You need to put Joe Biden's head on the guy who released the eagle...with a November 4th date!
I think you mean Joe Biden has never quit profiting off Americans.... Trump is the only one fighting for Americans...
What a wuss.  I bet Biden takes that down 1st thing.  What scares me is we get to see all these things happening and our hands are tied.
This confuses and upsets me every day. We don't need to follow that idiot to see his tweets. Why give him the satisfaction of following? Not following Biden kills me!!

Weekend at Bernies Biden edition
He's lost Florida. He's completely f*cked😁👏🏿👏🏽👏🏻 #FloridaPoll "(CNN)Poll of the week: A new CNN/SSRS poll finds that former Vice President Joe Biden leads in the state of Florida by a 51% to 46% margin over President Donald Trump among registered voters."
Its everywhere google biden saying they will remove trump by force because he wont accept a biden win. Pelosi has said it many have said it
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Yup. The thing with Biden is that Biden has had no plan to move to the left the only reason he did the whole Bernie task force was basically to get voters and for show.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
We need real American-bull dog journalists working for us instead against us. How do we get some freedom loving patriots in front row seats at these WH press briefings and in the faces of Pelosi/Biden/Schiff &amp; co. that will ask real questions that actually pressure them to help?
When Biden wins in November I'll be as happy as the men on Maury when they find out that they are not the father.
Joe Biden is 77 ,but on November 3rd he will be 46.
If it comes out from the pentagon we just found proof of aliens / off world vehicles in  Antarctica... would trust Deep State Biden the basement puppet or PRESIDENT DONALD J TRUMP to disclose what’s really going on?   Not even close!!! 🧨💥  🇺🇸👽TRUMP 2020!👽🇺🇸
Of course you are! How else are you gonna convince us there’s a big second wave that will keep our economy closed, keep Biden hidden in the basement, stop Trump from campaigning, and use mail in voting to cheat your way into whatever job you traded your integrity away for? LOSER!
I'm so tired of hearing about what the F Obama and Biden did.  Please focus on the important stuff.  Maybe you should focus on being a great President maybe people would take you more seriously.
This is why this country is stuck we could do better but nope they gave us Biden vs Trump. What a fucking nightmare.
Honestly The whole Biden/Obama team up is such bullshit makes me so fucking angry because we should be moving forward but nope we got to go back to the Obama years instead of moving forward and this is who they want me to vote for absolutely fucking not.
Is Obama his fucking adviser what is this shit why is Biden so desperate to go back to how shit was during the Obama years how the fuck is that progress Obama promised a lot and could not get a lot of shit passed cause the Republicans stood in the way and because Obama did not
please put us back in stage 3 before we all die. Oh. And join biden in the white house this november. #PLEASESAVEUSWHITMER
Joe Biden’s platform: I can say racist things and get away with it. I can assault Tara Reade and get away with it. I can be losing my mental capacities but it does not matter. I have the media in my back pocket.
#DHS Also just legally put in writing, they lied re: NY Immigrant transit. This admin is NOT to be trusted with a shoe👟, let alone an entire human being😡😤.
We MUST keep track of them. Look at all the #KidsInCages they have lost😤. Or offended upon while being dragged maliciously away, or in supposed #FederalCustody.
Telling rich donors nothing will fundamentally change. #JoeBidenJob
What is this how the fuck does this make Biden appealing?
The blue wave died. Biden is not worth voting for. His nomination is more revolting than idiots presidency.  We had a chance to make real change and the corporate interests gave us Biden.  I’m all 4 watching trump ruin Wall Street.
Atka passed the mental acuity test ⁦ took. We have found Biden’s running mate. ⁦
Biden training our furture
A vote for Biden,is a vote for your children.
I think every democrat is voting for Biden.  An Independent like myself am not voting for Biden.  I guess once those who temporarily registered as Democrats to vote for Bernie are counted then we will know.  Many are not voting at all. No one worth voting for.
For 40 fucking years your hero voted against the working class.  Forty fucking years.  Citizens United thank Biden. He is corporate owned pimp.  This entire comment is true.  Biden isn’t worth a squirt of piss to me.  They are both terrible.
Ghislaine is going to implicate,the Biden’s.
Joe Biden in one of his Ads says “Keep your Distance”. Does this mean stay in your basement? 🙄
Joe Biden = Socialism.  Donald Trump = Free Economic Society Choose wisely! Trump 2020 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸Ya, she claimed to know him personally, too. As she did with Joe Biden &amp; said he gave his personal cell phone number! 🤣
How are we being dishonest that fact we are calling out a corporate politician and are mad about it.This is disgusting how you guys are treating us and you realize u need us  to elect  Biden in November. I’m going to not vote if I being treated this way by both parties.
I predicted this is how it would end up 2 years ago and is why I am glad I supported and campaigned for  The Sanders campaign got absolutely nothing out of the Biden campaign besides a lot of tears and broken hearts. This #SettleForBiden sheep-dogging is pathetic!🤬
Whoopsies.  Joe Biden Criticized Trump’s Handling Of PPP Loans As His Son-In-Law Benefited From the Program | The Daily Caller
Does Biden know he's running for President yet?
Moms for Biden? Dear God! Guess they like the idea of a strange creapy old guy groping their little gils and them,even with the camera rolling. Strange bunch they are!
Whatever it takes.  I’m good with. It will take a while to fumigate.   Hope they start packing the tacky decor they have.  Biden then immediately needs a ceremony putting up Obama’s picture.
Well you do know that Biden is not the current President right. We know that because Biden would have done something in the first 70 days when COVID-19 hit. So why is it up to Biden to go out &amp; take a chance on catching #TrumpsVirus When Biden get's into office it will be better!
She’ll fit right into Joe Biden’s “who am I and why am I here” administration.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden
Biden thought he was at the beach
I love how dems let city’s get destroyed and blame trump. Biden doesn’t support 🏳️‍🌈 and people aren’t black enough but it’s trumps fault for racism and hate. Gtfoh
Biden better worry about if he’s even Real. The vaccine is a joke for a joke pandemic.
Biden is a token
The Background Influences of GPB Capital Holdings: Hunter Biden, a Jeffrey Epstein Associate, a Biotech Company, and a Russian Mob Connection.
So Pelosi becomes President per the Constitution and Trump can go pick weeds in the parking lot while she schedules a do-over if it needs to be done. Or Biden takes over. In no way does this work.
What does it matter? What does it matter if it's Biden or a wooden Indian? The oligarchy rules, not our elected (ha ha) leaders.
So the  is getting more help from Russia. Nice that the  is funded &amp; paid for by Putin. The  are nothing but TRAITOR'S!    I guess they figure Russia helped in 2016 so they might as well help in 2020!
I think she means so Biden can put a replacement for her on the SC, not a Con.
If this election is done honestly, it’s not going to be close. There’s not one person that is excited to vote for Joe Biden. Everyone who does vote for him will have this uncomfortable feeling. The guy is cenile.
I think that they are setting Michelle up for the old bait and switch with Biden, I think He will drop out for medical reasons and she will step in to 'save' the election. This will happen at the last possible moment and the Media will glorify her and this move . I hope I'm wrong
Anyone want to bet Biden never debates TRUMP on stage ?
Biden during the debates if he manages to wiggle his way out of them.Gasping for air and thoughts that aren't related to smelling girls hair.
Inserted a pic of Biden? Who's reaching now?
If Biden picks that black widow and wins the election ,he won't last 10 months and she will be in Power. And THEN she will bring the horror show to America and reign down terror from coast to coast .
What about Quid pro Joe Biden being under investigation by Ukrainian officials. That's going to bite him for sure.Trumps going to est Bidens lunch if Biden ever debates TRUMP. Biden will wiggle his way out of it so how..mark my words..it will happen.
I noticed Twitter pulled all the less flattering gif's of Biden down..wonder why.
From 6 yrs ago with makeup. Show me a pic of a Biden rally with more than 100 people.
We all need to prepare ourselves for after the results. Because they will announce Biden as POTUS fraudulently! Biden is worse candidate than Hillary and TRUMP has amazingly more support than last time. It may result in a uprising! Which my cause bloodshed..hopefully not.
Do 5 fucking seconds of research. Biden put forward the US crime bill which has played a role in the protests of today. He can't finish a sentence. He didn't support gay marriage until 2012, he told wall Street donors that "nothing will fundamentally change." We need real change!
Seeing Trump shaking hands with incoming President Biden? Priceless. #WeWillVote
Why When  Makes Any Sence He Says He'll Do Whatever Trumps Doing to Unravel The F-Ups  Caused  Bidens A Fake! And Under Investigation In Ukraine  Biden/Obama Stole American TaxPayer Money And Ukrainian TaxPayer Money To Enrich The Rich  1 Billion Missing
Yeah let's let her control the server for email election cuz we know that Hillary is so trust worthy. May as well just announce Biden President today if we allow that
He can't blame this on Obama or Biden. But I wouldn't be surprised if he tried.
Let's get one thing clear, I'm not voting FOR Biden in November, I'm voting AGAINST Trump, because he says shit like this that scares the hell out of me. He
Only would consider supporting this delay idea with 3 simple mandatory requirements: (1)  resigns; (2)  installed as VP; (3) immediately resigns upon Biden becoming #VP.
Maybe not but he WILL be escorted out when Biden is sworn in.  All power transfers and there are measures in place to assure that.  Trump will then be trespassing if he refuses to leave the WH. He'll be forcibly removed at that point.
That’s the only way Joe Biden hopes to win. But there is nothing impossible for God...
Biden is under investigation in Ukraine...... Where is Hunter ?
I’m realy tired of this bullshit claim that hydroxychloroquine hasn‘t been proven effective five against the virus! It’s all a scam to keep us in fear until after the elections are over (and they hope, a Biden win)  What happened to Our body, our choice?
BREAKING NEWS: Joe Biden picks Aunt Jemima to be his running mate.............#VoteRED2020RemoveEveryDemocrat
Biden would be licking the shit out of her.  That is funny
You are so off on this buddy!  You can thank the #DemsAreDestroyingAmerica #GeorgeSoros for paying for all these idiots to do this!  TRUMP HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS!  BIDEN HAS EVERYTHINGTO DO WITH THIS! and it is about NOV!
Since when does anyone vote based on the VP?  If one truly believes having Harris or any other Biden pick as a VP is WORSE than having trump as president then they aren't a dem and they sure as heck ain't progressive.
Is somebody actually talking in his ear or is Biden hearing voices? I’m serious
My friends son is taking part in a social experiment. He has to wear a Biden 2020 t shirt for 2 weeks and see how people react. So far he's been spit on, punched, and had a bottle thrown at him! I'm curious what will happen when he goes outside.
Taking a wild guess in saying that Biden asked Reagan’s family for permission, something Trump never did &amp; tried to profit off of.
I’ll be doing exactly this out in my street for days after Biden wins!
Trumps comments about the low income housing, just made me pick up the phone &amp; donate more money to Joe Biden!!!
The election is going to be crazy I believe. Biden will be announced POTUS fraudulently and the mail in ballots will take forever and cost too much so they will say theres going to be a better way next election. Biden is worse than Hillary was and TRUMP has more supporters.
I'm sure when Biden takes over every last one will be removed. I bet right now he is already working on &amp; has contacted all the people he wants.
Voting based on race is not in anyone's best interest.  If I vote Biden because he's as pasty faced as they come, I'm voting higher taxes, fewer Constitutionally protected rights, and less justice for Americans.  That doesn't seem like a good idea.
They had 8 years of Obama/Biden which gave us DJT!!
I think we just found Biden's VP.
Sad thought I just had, Joe Biden couldn't even make this walk in any sort of reasonable pace without help, and that's now. What's Joe going to look like in 2-3 yrs?
So is the DNC's and Joe Biden's platform for the 2020 election "At least we're not Trump"?  Because with all the progressive policies the DNC is against that their constituents are in support of, it sure as fuck feels that way.
Remember the first Men In Black? The little alien inside the human shell?  Biden's little guy is from Uranus.
God, you are just so childish and unintelligent.  I cannot WAIT for President Biden.  At least he can communicate and has empathy.  Something you will never have.
Joe who? You're surely not talking about Creepy Joe Biden?
Yeah, but Biden and the Democrats never do what they promise at election time. They don't have to. Fools, like we used to be, vote them back in anyway. They don't even try. Bernie would have, and still does.
Pure evil is neoliberal Democrats promising to improve things but never following through because they serve the oligarchy, not us. And Biden is one of the worst at that.
Biden is the antithesis to Bernie. He is all that's bad in politics. So never.
The part where Biden is much better.
She already gave up &amp; endorses leg-hair biden
I'm an amalgamation of every emotion. Once Biden is sworn in and Donald's treason team are in prison, then I will level out.
My money’s on Connie. Biden will spin the shit outta it.
Biden is a corrupt, dementia riddled, pedo, who will allow Antifa to burn down any semblance of justice.
Joe Biden shared this post earlier, do I look like I know what I'm talking about?:
This man is the absolute lowest of low. I mean Schumer is on a pedestal compared to Nadler. Is there no level credibility or decency anymore - Nadler, Biden, Pelosi, Schumer are all examples of why there should be single term limits.
Oh hell no lol voting for Biden is like shooting yourself in the foot.
I don't care who Biden picks for VP. They are all good choices. I'm voting blue down the line.
Robert Mueller and Joe Biden have a lot in common. They are both past their intellectual prime and easily manipulated by aggressive ideologues on their team. #JoeBiden2020
Did you hear the clapping after Joe Biden’s softball press conference that left everyone dumber. It’s hilarious! Tells the whole story.
Biden Just said he hasnt been tested So wouldn't thatbe a pretty good  indication that COVID-19 isnt that infectious? I mean hes been hiden biden. He says the name of reporter scans his sheet for what his answer to the question.  Biden is a joke!
They shouldn't be able to reclaim their time this is nothing but a witch hunt.  This is insane.  Covid is under control, Now you have idiot Biden! Touting #s that would have saved lives!? Are you EFFING kidding me.  Let's talk ab oi it #KillerCuomo #Killeand the 1000s he killed
I thought there was no way they don’t replace Biden, like you. But he says Biden is it!
Do you watch the dilley show? He made a really good argument that Biden is their candidate because it’s too late for them to switch. He said they would have done it a long time ago.
Can anyone make sense of what joe Biden was just saying?? I can’t! 😳
Um hum. And it's going to get worse.  Good. Nothing but disaster will wake people up. Trump has made good progress toward disaster, and Biden won't help a thing.
Why is fox entertaining Biden questions from hand picked reporters of the house circus with Barr?
Joe Biden is A  Globalist And His Regulation And Taxes will Destroy America!!!!
Why When Biden Says Anything That makes Sence  Trumps Already Doing It!
Ok so I just flipped over to Fox to see what they were saying about the hearing &amp; they are showing Biden talking to reporters after his conference. Did Fox not show the Barr hearing today at all? Just wondering if they were trying to hide it from their base?
hey CNN, I love &amp; support Joe Biden, but, I have been enjoying watching Barr get ate alive in this hearing! Please turn it back to the hearing! Wth???
Now on a break and blow hard Biden is saying nothing
Oh, I blocked him a while ago.  I'm all for green party but it's either Biden or Trump.  If we get Biden, then possibly in 4 more years we can vote for the green party. But if we get Dumpy, we won't get that option.
Obama announced Biden on Aug 23, 2008 and Hillary announced Kaine on Jul 22, 2016.   I think we are all desperate to hurry up, get this election over with, and get the orange menace out of office.   Be patient.
Biden has been a public servant for his entire career.  Why on earth would you think he'd "turn into an asshole?"
You keep pushing this narrative that Joe Biden will destroy America, that he'll allow China to run all over the US, that there will be riots etc. This is your Presidency, this is happening now. This is what you are doing! #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
To vote for Biden is to give in to the terrorists causing all this unrest! That is simply stupid! Trump is uncovering the evil and they don't like it! #Trump2Q2Q
You assume an honorable man like Joe Biden has the slightest care what a pissant like you has to say about anything. You disappearing from public view will be just one more benefit of your daddy losing in November.
We will see what he can do after November. Guess we just gotta ride it out. He won't risk Biden getting in office over a building. Or even officers lives.
If I was the President, I would have a hard time not laughing at biden the entire debate.
#RashidaTlaib on Why She Won't Endorse ⁦ I don’t know much about her but she is right!!
All of you suburban residents across all of this great country need to familiarize yourselves with AFFH. It will transform your lives in unbelievable awful ways. Please watch Life,Liberty and Levin episode of 7/26/20. Biden is for this travesty.
It's not extreme. Why won't you people get that. So many countries have a single payer system, the only reason this hasn't passed is because corporations run this government. And that won't change under Joe Biden. His health care plan will leave millions uninsured. That's wrong!
If Biden won't debate Trump then there is no vote and Trump remains president
Biden is a chicken shit and won't debate Trump  No debate .... No vote.... And Trump remains president
The same people who tweet for biden...
Biden being weird towards kids.... all of this is bad! Ffs do you hear yourself? Take the red pill bud (I’m not asking you to smoke trumps pole, I’m just asking you to wake tf up) 🤦‍♀️
You saw the footage of Biden smelling children, right? Come on Chris, this country is weak because we are divided. 😐
I know they’re not going to let Biden debate, but I wish they would. That would be the best tv of the century. Hilarious! Can you imagine! Every second would be recorded by millions!
Biden has already won the election fraudulently. Counting all the mail in ballots will take forever and cost too much so Biden will be announced POTUS and theres going to be a better way to count votes next election.This may lead to a uprising which bloodshed. Possibly TRUMP 2020
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Good - don’t be a hypocrite like Pelosi, Nadler, Schumer, Biden, Obama and the rest of them.
They will announce Biden as POTUS and theres going to be a uprising and blood might be spilled. Its going to be crazy !
Biden has already won the election fraudulently..mail in ballots will take forever and cost too much and they will say theres going to be a better way next election. Biden is worse candidate than Hillary was. TRUMP has more supporters than last time.
Strangely, instead of taking credit for gains by women in education during Obama’s tenure (even if Obama did nothing to achieve this), Biden pretends as if nothing good happened for women during the Obama years...why?
LOL. Dem Party Porn. Why is no one asking what Biden will do when he loses?
They are undersampling Rs. There was a pushback tweet from someone about the number of Rs who voted in 2016 and 2018. It was well over 30%. Trump has a near perfect approval rating with Rs, so these numbers are pretty much impossible. It would mean Biden taking ALL indies. LOL.
Biden's VP shortlist comes up short #SmartNews
Biden has already won fraudulently. Mail in ballots will take forever and cost too much to count. So they will announce Biden as POTUS. Biden is a worst candidate than Hillary and TRUMP has more supporters than ever.This will cause a uprising and blood might be spilled.
This Short Video Exposes Everything That Is Wrong With Biden's Green New Deal
Lets start a pool to see who gets indicted first . Hillary is probably a front runner , Obama is slippery so he may be back in the pack ,Peter s. and Paige will sing to stay free longer . so Biden is a fall guy . he wouldn't know it anyway. just give him a TV playin sesame street
You won't see Biden supporters in a boat rally, the fires are to hard to start on the lakes and rivers . !😄
We all want Biden to win.  FYI
That’s BS ... you people are pathetic!  Trump is doing exactly what he promised he would do... Draining the swamp! Obama, Biden, Clinton, Pelosi and the list goes on... They are the beginning of the end of the Deep State Cabal!  Research!
I don't want to live like a prepper, but logically, if Biden wins, there is truthfully no explanation other than fraud. If Trump wins, the meltdown will make 2016 look like a 5yr olds playdate.
I haven’t seen a Biden sign any place? Are we even sure he will be on the ticket?
You better watch Mark Levin on Fox. If you live in the suburbs , the Dems have a big change planned for your neighborhood If Biden wins. Obama started it in Westchester,   NY. It’s called AFFH. LOOK IT UP!!!#Biden/Obama #corruption #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica
Put the gummie bears down and back away from the sand box Joe Biden
biden Will Never Be President
One less thing of Trumps that Biden will have to tear down! 👍
- enjoy your polls. However, one thing I haven't seen is a focus on the economy. The polls I have seen show that Trump leads Biden in this area. What makes anyone think this won't be the primary reason to vote for Trump, even if the other issues are at the forefront?
Oohhh yes I’m ready!! Trump 2020 🇺🇸 If Biden wins Wowzers I’m scared 😦 people are off their rockers like he is!
Everybody talking about Covid-19, unemployment and bounties on US troops.  Let's not forget the tax cuts for the richest Americans, cutting food stamps during a pandemic, lying about Ukraine, golfing and saying things like "we shouldn't have courts."  Republicans out!  Biden 2020
I have a joke about Biden but I forgot it
🤔🤪🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I've Never Met Anyone that's Voting Biden
Dear Stephen, when this happens just remember they are watching fox "news" and have been brainwashed into thinking Covid-19 is hoax perpetrated by Biden and the Dems to make trump look bad. As if he isn't doing a great job all by himself.
Chances are good that Biden would become incapacitated during his first term. Is she really what you want running our country? This is for keeps folks - if you guess wrong you may not get another chance. You could wake up during your lifetime to a world with no USA. Then what?

JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Its not fear mongering it is facts. And Biden and Obama's economy was awful. Unemployment through the roof. Not to mention that health care plan. I guess we are just not going to agree. lol And that's okay. See you at the polls in November. I wish you the best.Cheers!FOX news,no.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
So, by your logic, voting for anyone other than Trump is effectively voting for Biden. Are you for real? 😂 For the record, I will never vote for Biden or for Trump. If the DNC wanted my vote, then it would offer me something and have not rigged the primary for Creepy Joe.
Kanye is not running for president he’s just taking the black votes from Biden
Holy s*hit. Read the comments on this tweet by #Biden. The people voting for him want a $25/hr minimum wage, with no thought as to how businesses could afford to pay it. All they do is want everything given to them. Pathetic.
Ye&gt; Biden  But it’s still #maga
If you like I will post receipts (videos &amp; quotes) to back up everything I said if you are as poorly educated as I suspect on Biden's history?
I've been counting signs also, no Biden signs to be found. So much for the polls. Just a welder in Michigan.
The Trump virus? Jesus Chris. Nixon, Clinton, Bush 1&amp;2, still weird flex but you do you. Are you voting for creepy Biden because of his politics or because he’s the only other option?
Joe Biden thinks unelected federal government bureaucrats, not elected municipal bureaucrats, should determine what kind of housing gets built. And a lot of taxpayers aren't happy about it.

I have asked so many what biden has done for them and not one can answer. He has held an office for 40 years and still I can't think of one honest thing he has done. Ask you friend what Bernie has done for him
I've been trying to pick a fight with one of these biden lovers for over a month feel proud they are calling you names 😊😊
Tell me what biden has done for you? You like the riots? They are dem  run you know. You want high taxes or how bout we all just give our money to the government so we can get an allowance like children.  You don't like Trump but I bet you can't tell me why biden is great.
Every vote for someone not named Biden is a vote for Donald Trump.
The house will undo your ban and Biden will undo everything else.
but biden isnt ofc because thats who you support ah yes
Biden isn't popular because of something he did, he's popular in spite of trump.
You should wait and see what this world will do when we have Joe Biden try to fix a terrible economy hit by this pandemic! I want u to think...Donald trump has successfully shown the world how to be financially stable! Before Obama I never even heard of Biden.
Biden said he lost a nit. Has no Idea when it happened. He does not remember when he was neutered.
People are asking, what are you all going to do with your efforts after Biden is elected?
Yeah, we know. Biden sucks
Obama/Biden   TPP  Remember?       We Would Have Never Have Had Clean Gas!!
I believe you. If we make it to election day,  great.. You will be president elect Biden. But between 3 November and 20 January, that is when it all hits the fan. tRump will burn this country to the ground. If not the world.   Do you have a plan for that?.
#Obama #Biden Time to pay the piper #WorstPresidentEver
Biden is Dead Man Walking when the debates start.
We have em already pelosi,biden etc.
You just don't want him to debate period. Yoy know he couldnt even form a sentence!! What the hell has he ever done for you? I ask all you biden lovers that question and still nobody has a comeback for it. "Help us Joe, help us become socialists!!"
Here's a Joe Biden Rally....
Nope. I have traveled all over the world. I have  learned to  recognize the truth. I think Biden will only be a puppet.  He isn't what we need. Its you that appears to be "brain washed" You need to look at the big picture. You rights are slipping away. You are handing them over.
20 January.. president Biden in the white house.
The end is on November 4th if Biden wins. Then it’s over.
Biden supporters
Let’s go on the offense and talk about Donald Trump and all the good he’s done. Joe Biden is getting way to much hype and he doesn’t even have to talk!! Don’t you see what’s going on?

Have you already decided what you're going to think about it?  Me personally, I can't wait for Biden's inauguration.
The thing about this weird little fruitcake is he’s like Biden - been around forever running this agency and not one person has ever heard of him. What if he’s completely full of crap and a whack job?  We’ve put all this trust into someone who was modestly vetted 25 years ago.
I heard Joe Biden wants to setup a homeless camp in your suburban backyard....don’t let him do it!
SERIOISLY BACK OFF MY PRESIDENT AND GO SPEND YOUR TROLL MONEY FROM BIDEN... I GUESS THAT'S YOUR EBT CARD.... I'M ALSO GUESSING YOU SPENT YOUR STIMULUS MONEY FROM MY PRESIDENT.

I hope Biden doesn't listen to his certain allies. Picking Kamala would be a slam dunk for him, don't mess this up Joe I pray 🙏
No corruption to report about Biden.
I'm ashamed to say I live in Michigan.  The biggest problem Trump has in Michigan is that he tells the truth about the black messiah (Obama).  People don't like Biden, they just don't like the fact that Obama sucked and Trump keeps saying it.
Biden will win, I think by a large margin.
Neil Cavuto is a Biden loving scum sucking bag of shit.  He doesn't have a very high rated show and really should go to CNN, where he would be a good fit with Don Lemon or Chris Cuomo.
Wut? Don’t think they want to raise that topic. “‘But as Bill Clinton once told me, the number one cause of Alzheimer’s is ambition,’ he added, while noting he’s in favor of Demings.”
Absolutely better off with Biden. Fuck Trump!
Democracy means you can vote and have someone to vote for you on bills. opposite of a democracy is dictatorship or monarchy  Socialism is a theory that the community owns everything.  Biden never said anything about Socialism or Removing democracy. He said “Democratic socialism.”
Automatic loss for Biden in Michigan
Except Biden when he writes it on his little notepad. 😆
Congrats to the people of Georgia for joining Arizona &amp; N.Carolina in polling Joe Biden ahead of the screwball! Next on the list the state of Texas where Biden is creeping closer everyday!

I'm terrified of what he'll do before the swearing in of Biden NEXT YEAR!!!!
Don’t think the polls are wrong. The votes are NOT in GOP favor, regardless of the Biden Condition. Too many fractionalized action paths with no identifiable successes. Be gracious in your loss! You did some great things, just didn’t sell them well!
Hey Sean I would like to see you say something about Biden refusing to have a interview with Chuck walace. Biden election committee said no to interview. OK then how is the American people gonna trust biden when his own elect committe  don't trust him. That's bad
Under Joe Biden, we will not have huge gains, but we will also not have historically large drops.  We will return to the market as it was under Obama or even Clinton. Steady, small daily increases that denote a healthy growing economy. This is a market where money can be made.
We all know that Biden will continue to allow corporations to run the show. Remember “Nothing will fundamentally change”
In Michigan there are no bashful Trump supporters like the Republicans like to think. They're a bunch of Trump flag waving morons! But it's nowhere near the support he had last year. This is a hard working union state that made a big mistake it will correct this year. BIDEN 2020!
Women who are housewives are very lucky. During the Obama Biden era, I was too broke to be home with my babies. A luxury I would have treasured. Under President Trump, I was able to be home with my 1st grandbaby tho. Thank God for that.❤️
LeBron James is another idiot talking about slavery when China has slaves that are arabic making Nike shoes which LeBron buys but don't say anything about slavery there,another idiot who probably will vote for dumb mental loss biden who thinks Arizona is a city
Counting those chickens... “A dark horse candidate who aces her oral exam with the nominee could end up as the finalist — and considering Biden’s commanding status in the race, as well as his age — the most likely person in America to be the 47th president.”
Vote Trump not dumb biden and dumber Val. They believe in screwing the American people,dems are a
Val demoing and Joe Biden are idiots,I didn't know Joe Biden had extra room in his basement for Val Deming. These damn democrats have there head so far up each others ass it's pittiful.. If people like freedom in this country they need to vote TRUMP
Isnt it nice to see Arizona &amp; N.Carolina now have Biden leading in the new polls? At the rate Trump is losing states he could be left with only Urah &amp; Wyoming lmfao.
Thank you N.Carolina and Arizona the 2 newest states on the Biden train, toot toot!
Keep blaming it on the media, the left and Biden but this is all on YOUR watch dumbass!
There will be NO debates! Not even electronically from separate locations. Biden can’t talk for that long.
I will never watch sports again now that the players take a knee at anthem time, there low life Americans like biden,pelosi, shumar. This is America you stupid f%$KS you stand with hand on heart during anthem. Didn't your parents teach you anything.

In November it will come down to freedom or communism not Trump or Biden or left or right. The November election will be the moment when us Americans will choose the country we want to live in.
Uphill battle big time, nobody is excited about Biden.
If Biden every put a twitter out that he really text and put it out it would be so fucking funny. Biden is just a propped up puppet. Fuck the DNC.
Bought off bullshit, rigged primary’s. I think you might be right Biden was dead and the DNC  wants somebody, and wants somebody who can ad-lib and not people think what a brain lost dick.
Well, THERE's a good reason to vote for a man with advanced dementia who supports Socialism. I knew there had to be a valid reason to  support Biden. Those 40 yrs weren't enough for him.  Give him 44, and just wait to see all he will accomplish!
Now Tucker Carlson is campaigning for Joe Biden!  The rats are jumping off the sinking ship!
Rice is best choice for her strengths and credentials. She is needed to repair our international relationships. Her experience as National Security Advisor is absolutely needed. This also gives her an existing relationship with Joe Biden, allowing her to hit the ground running.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Well I have to agree there. As much as I think Bernie was a bit much he has substance.  Biden? 🤔
His last words were Vote Biden!
Trump should spy on Biden. Black lives matter. Biden put all blacks in jail band wanted segregation.  Blm
The thing conservatives don't get is "but Biden" is not an own or a gotcha. We do not fuck with that old bitch.
DO NOT VOTE FOR KANYE. ANY VOTE NOT FOR BIDEN IS FOR TRUMP.
He keeps pushing the same lies, fake it to you make it. Exactly the way Roy Cohn taught him. Just like its Bidens fault what's going on in the streets now, bull fucking shit who's in charge right now not Joe Biden it's the dumb fucked up 🍊 in the oval office!
Donald Trump's campaign team trying to convince the world that Biden is some sort of lefty, Antifa, Marxist is one of the dumbest fucking campaign strategies I've ever seen.
Biden ad during the #DetroitRoots game, he's winning
This a really good interview. Trump is just kind of a regular guy who gets painted as some evil monster in the MSM. I'm not some huge Trump guy, but if you asked me to pick between Biden &amp; Trump, it would be a no brainer to me. I would choose Trump 100%
Joe Biden is a pedophile and barely has an idea who he or others are around him.  He should help you bigly like his last 40 years in government.
America believes in honesty and integrity. Those are attributes you and your grifter family know nothing about. But in November when the Dems take over the majority and Biden kicks your ass out of the WH, we can rename the forts, get rid of the statues &amp; fumigate the WH
The only thing that's being proven to me, why Biden is so far ahead in the polls, is that there are a lot of very, very stupid people in this country.
Biden Ad just aired during baseball he's Winning

Hey Sean the BLM supporters are buttholes,Joe Biden,Nancy Pelosi and shumar are all in the basement under the desk.there idiots peroid. I am a true believer in the 2nd amendment. All legal Americans need to arm there selves to protect home and family.
The only things  does is to try to further his election chances. And he will still lose to Biden because Biden is the better man.Jesus, the #2020Election is going to be a nightmare. And, #Trump2020 will win huge. Lost mail, confusion, etc., all breaks for Trump's advantage. Polling suggests Trump voters will vote in person, Biden voters will mail in.

"Biden... long meaty answers" No hon those are words salads.

Ok, then help trump win! Biden will do what is right during this pandemic. He is an exemplary role model. Your divisiveness gives you away
Counted 7 Trump signs on M-32, between East Jordan and Gaylord. That’s just a 30 mile stretch.   0 Biden signs.   I am aware that’s it’s a sparsely populated, rural area ... but still.
YOU KNOW PERSONALLY this to be TRUE?Our President has the the LOVE and RESPECT from our soldiers. He’s given more to THEM than BIDEN/Obama did! He’s made the MILITARY WHOLE AGAIN. The OBAMA ERA RAPED our military. He wouldn’t even SALUTE them. He didn’t RESPECT our MILITARY.

Exactly what I was saying in July and now the chickens have come to roost. Due to the artificial barriers, there was a MSM blackout on Bernie, Antifa is propagandized as terrorists, BLM are criminals and Biden has called for the arrest of anarchists.
I have my own opinions on Biden and Trump, but the amount of people sharing information that’s not even close to true, and others believing it is mind blowing. Both parties are absolute jokes. THIS is America.

Mark my words: Biden included the statement that he was “pressured to pick a woman of color” for his VP because he is, in fact, picking a white woman. But he wanted to show his consideration.
Trump isn’t running against Biden.  He’s running against voter fraud and all of Silicon Valley   Don’t worry in the end Trump wins because God wins.   This election is good vs evil  Vote like your life depends on it Because it does

So if McCarthy were a Democrat then he wouldn't really have meant Communists, he just meant communists. And if  Biden had said arsonists and women, he would really only meant the crazy, manipulators or Karens. What he meant to say is as bad as what he said. F off w/ that schitt.

Can they not just shut the f*** up with this stupid logic, for fck’s sake. Let’s say Biden loses, Oompa Loompa stays on. If the supposed blue wave happens, Dems controlling the senate AND the house will effectively castrate trump and vice versa. That’s only 4 years of gridlock.
Okay Politico! 🙄 I’m just going to wait for Biden’s announcement. Thanks though.
My 63 yrs on earth I haven’t experience a bad President as bad as you. Once you are voted out come November, Biden will “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN “. So until then do your job until you’re voted out in November.
Just a thought. What would happen if Joe Biden were to die suddenly for whatever reason before the election? Would the election be delayed? How long do you think the chaos would last if this happened?
I’m sure you need a mental branch to cling on to, but looking at Joe Biden’s whole career… He’s not it. There really is no hope in this situation. We’re all gonna have to be in the streets. Don’t lie to yourself and think that Joe Biden is going to help us.

Checkmate. The escalating police violence and inactivity of govt demonstrate the urgency of protestors' demands. They have no impetus to elect Biden. If Dem voters want an election, they need to pressure Biden, Dems, and local govt to defund police or kiss elections good-bye.
I can’t wait to Biden says “tear down that wall”.
We don’t need a president that relies on a teleprompter or rehearsed speech. BIDEN is now a VICTIM OF ELDER ABUSE. The DNC needs to draft someone from the floor of the convention. Without a teleprompter or memorized speech you get this.

How much better do u think it’s gonna get with him gone. If Biden thinks he has the black vote, we will be taken advantage of.  Now is the time to say, talk to me or I’m out.  It’s now or never.  No plan for me no vote for me.

I got a text from an long-time (20+ years) friend that kinda-sorta pissed me off. They wrote:  "My [relative]'s enthusiasm for Biden bothers me. Yeah, I'll be glad to be rid of Trump. But I'm not going to [be] proud of America or anything for electing the slightly less sexist...

I'm voting for Joe Biden because my 6 year old daughter deserves better. #Biden2020 💙
Fiscally speaking, large swaths of his supporters had their jobs shipped out, essentially, left to rot in more rural areas, along with massive wage stagnation, he is correct. That’s why so many are shifting back to Biden, who will very likely continue the low-wage crush.
Just to clarify...it won’t be Biden up against Trump. Perhaps I’m way off on my guesses.  Perhaps I’m not. Whatever the case it won’t be Biden.
#MAJOR: Poll - 70% of voters choose Trump over Biden on the issue of fighting crime
He's throwing out the first Bitch at Yankee Stadium  He's going to complain that the ball is too large for his hands and the glove keeps falling off.  Then he'll say it's Biden's fault.
New poll shows Floridians oppose the Jax convention and Biden is thumping him in Fla.
I'm assuming he means "The first blatantly racist modern president." As in the first one in the last several decades after we learned racism is shitty. Biden is good at delivering speeches other people write for him but not so great at improv.
So why did you take $200K to campaign for Fred Upton, a GOP rep who was a leader in the fight to defund Obamacare?
Because Biden is everything Trump pretends to be, for all the wrong reasons that those people love
Jill  Biden  was  our 2nd lady  for  8 yrs-Make her first lady-She is actually  educated-Smart &amp; experienced -Nothing like the fake unlady MELANIA " She is a DISGRACE  to  all  our  previous  real  1st  LADIES and be glad  he learned to  put clothes  on  for  this  job
How long has biden been in politics? How long has trump? Ya...orange man bad though right?
It happens all the time. They are only fiscally conservative when Democrats want to spend money on average people or when there is a Democrat as president. If Biden wins... suddenly they will be fiscally conservative again and care about the deficit (they created).

The China Communist Party (CCP) Announces It is Behind Sleepy Joe Biden for President - Is Likely Doing All They Can to Stop Trump
Thanks for confirming that Joe Biden is also a statist authoritarian who would continue the practice of violently quelling peaceful protest through gestapo tactics. I hope you will join me, comrade, in dismantling the capitalist state of the USA to birth a new communist utopia.
#REMINDER: Resgister to #VoteRed in November. The radical left wants to push America towards socialism. We CANNOT let that happen! Help President Trump secure a victory against Joe Biden, November 3rd! #Vote
Biden wont pick a black vp running mate. The Democrats have used the black voter block, for what their worth to the Dems, to create race riots aimed really at harming President Trump's presidency and re-election.
The President is exposing America's system of government and that's what the Cancel Culture is all about and initial meaning  Draining the Swam... Biden thinks we're going back to the pre-covid19 era to circumvent the Southern Strategic Formula
#Breaking: Debates! Just not TRUMP Vs. BIDEN  (Oct. 7) Vice Presidential debate organized by Commission on Presidential Debates, has put together all general election debates since 1988 - Debate will feature Trump's VP Mike Pence and the not yet announced VP pick of nominee Biden
Only trump supporters would call this “joe Biden’s America” when it is quite litterally just a video of what’s BEEN happening under trump for the past months
📰 #Election2020: Joe Biden not taking questions from reporters, won't debate Trump: "A safe spaces campaign"Real talk.  Dems and KKK vs USA 1870/1871, GOP protected the Black Vote. While Dems produced KKK, JIMCrowlaws, voted against civil rights, Biden co-signed the 90 crime bill, Sente Bird was KKK and dem in congress till early 2000's, BLM donates 100 to Dems
So you think Racist Biden win, you smoking crack. Unless Democrats are overthrowing the government
Obama/Biden’s FBI spied on a political opponent AND covered-up a Pedophile ring!!! Let that sink in 👍
He is not interested in any facts. Truth has never been a Stalinist objective. He is just as corrupt as Obama, Biden and the recently deceased Lewis.
Biden’s FBI knew this shit was going on 🤷🏻‍♂️
In case you’re wondering about Biden’s notes for his news conference captured in this AP photograph: ‘Do not hold grudges’ against Kamala Harris | GOPUSA
As a Michigander iam terrorified if biden become president becuase he be figure head for a couple months til they remove him for dementia and stick kamela Harris as president and nancy move up to VP. Aoc become speaker of house. And we on freight train to socialism.
lol you’re voting for Biden ... just stop
Biden? What
Biden is trying to avoid debates 😂😂😂
“If you don’t vote for me you ain’t black”-Joe Biden  “They city of Arizona”-biden
So again.  If you liked Wallace’s interview, why doesn’t Biden take the invite? This is his chance to move to the center 🤷🏻‍♂️
And Biden is?  Biden can barely put two sentences together!  Why do you think they don’t want him to debate?
Copy and paste this text and tweet it:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
You know it’s not going to work and now you seem kinda desperate. I’ll do my Biden duty but I’m not gonna like it.
well, in all honestly, when the personalities in question are walking lampoons of politicians, it makes it pretty tough to satirize. Funny how you have not mentioned Biden's evident mental incapacity on the ACS - too close to home?
Yours was the most corrupt, incompetent and divisive administration in history. Biden was part of it!!
What's this "We" shit Kemosabe? I'd vote for her in a heart beat! How's that fake ass "Republicans for Biden" working out? "We" all know it's a lie.
JOE CHINA BIDEN REALLY
I bet Biden won’t even show up 😂😂😂
What “reprocussions” would a Liberal if they openly express their support for the Democrat Party or Joe Biden? 🤔
We did when we got rid of obama/ Biden administration . the left (democrats) is the most racist group in history
, Biden is mental midget and going to get ate up in thw debates unless he to scared to show uphUnTeR BiDeN who?
Yeah I get that too.  Im either a Russian bot or a trump supporter. Who knew?  Biden absolutely sucks.
40,000 #WarrenDemocrats raised 1.5 million for Joe Biden today.
I’m getting so many texts from both parties (which is what happens when you’ve voted Republican AND Democrat over the course of nearly 20 some years). I wish “please stop texting me” worked. Trump’s party is very demanding via text. Biden’s side is more pleading, but polite.
Biden is a way better person than tRump will ever be so get over it. He’s a born looser!!!
Joe Biden says that we have a "crimate clises".  I think he's right...
A lot of Biden’s allies seem intent on making an anti-Trump election into a validation of what the left base wants, which Biden has smartly shied away from. The question will be whether Trump continues blundering around so it doesn’t matter or not.
Not true because Trump will be out of office. The truth is Trump is the reason for the protests. Biden will speak to the concerns of the people not send in troops to dominate like we're communist China.
Another Biden nut case!
Donald Trump’s October surprise is going to be a deep fake of Joe Biden saying something horrific and there’s just nothing we can do about it
Our country currently faces many challenges.  Joe Biden is not the answer to any of them.
Ironically texting everyone 👍after Biden on that livestream has inevitably led to just doing it
What are the chances that  squeals on #NobodyLikesTrump before dersh gets sent to jail and subsequently Epsteined?
Joe Biden says that we have a "crimate clises".  I think he's right...
Biden wrote the tough on crime bill which created the mass incarceration situation. He also wrote the Patriot act. The war on drugs, as well as the drastic reduction in rights over the past 20 years, is a direct result of his legislature.
A little off topic I believe the trump rally’s Biden rally’s need to end along with protesting it’s just to dangerous with the pandemic going on to be doing that stuff trumps rally over a dozen people had tested positive
Yeah, probably after Biden picks his VP but before the conventions (or when the conventions would have happened and whatever they're doing now)
Tim.   Biden doesn’t know what his policies are yet.  He doesn’t have to do any thinking.  Whatever the corporate interests tell him to do he will.  Sad this man is the better of 2 options.  If these candidates were goods sold at market the companies would go bankrupt
He’s had enough time in politics to get things fixed. He’s failed. Move along Hiden Biden
Biden might actually win.
After 4 years of Biden’s tax cut republicans will want to end that. How do they convince voters a tax cut for them is a bad thing.  Who of you reading this couldn’t use 7500 a year fed tax cut?  How many middle class gop voters you know will vote 7509 away from themselves?
Folks.  I have been extremely critical of Biden for months.  I will not disrespect this page or it’s mission.  I have an Idea that would almost assure Democrats control all 3 branches of government for 50 years.  I want to try it out on this page to see what your think
Joe Biden say that we have a "crimate clises".  I think he's right...
46th President Joseph R Biden  Nov. 3rd can’t come fast enough!!! Your inauguration is where America will finally get a full nights sleep again!!! #Biden2020 #BlueWave2020TakeOver #BidenPledgesAllegianceToUS #BidenLandslide2020 Love You Sir!! 🙏🏼🙏🏼♥️♥️
And I don’t want to shame anybody but seriously you are telling everybody vote and you go into this whole but this is as good as we are going to get we shouldn’t question or demand more we just got to suck it up and vote for Biden because we got to take out Trump. 🙄No wonder
I mean this whole settling for less shit isn’t going to cut it everybody should be demanding that Biden and his team do better do something more beyond just giving us a story or a vague speech.
“With his dying breath he said, tell Obama to use my funeral for Biden’s campaign! Biden for president”🙄
I have a serious question so say Biden wins and Trump/his team is out what comes next so far what i hear is very vague. Okay you are going build back better so how are the Dems going to take back the house from the Republicants. Cause so far Joe isn’t for progressive policies
Biden doesn’t have dementia. Nor syphilis
President Biden I don’t expect you’d have time anyway since you’ll be busy cleaning up the ENORMOUS mess the current idiot &amp; his minions have made!! Love you Sir!! We the People are here with you, standing by you, &amp; supporting you through &amp; through because we know you will do IT!
Nobody noticed this but me I swear.. Joe Biden might have been right! 😆
I NEVER thought I'd say this but. Joe Biden was RIGHT!!!  😅😂😆  #YouAintBlack #blackface #ObaMAGAate #KAG2020 #JoeBidenIsARacist #ObamaWasBetterAtEverything Including Blackface!
Joe Biden say that we have a "crimate clises".  I think he's right...
Bernie is actually on record saying that “if Joe Biden wins the election, he will be the most progressive president we’ve ever had”.
But Biden is definitely the lesser of the 2 evils and we have to pick one if we pick none we risk trump winnin
Yep! It’s exhausting just saying anything positive about Biden or anyone else outside of the GOP hate machine. Good luck and have fun. #VoteByMail #Vote #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #LoveIsEssential #Peace #KindnessMatters
I admit Obama care needed reforming as it wasn’t fair for certain individuals but Obama saved the country most Americans aren’t educated enough but research quantum easing Biden is the lesser of the 2 evils he’s the best hope we can have believe me I much rather feel the bern
I mean yes the dnc fucked him over but Obama personally called and asked Bernie to drop out cause we need to unite against a common cause and if you listen to any of bernies words at any rally’s he started with each rally it’s not about me winning or Biden it’s about taking down
Sorry, but Trump has to go. Historically I'm a 3rd party voter, but not this time. I cannot stand by and watch my country get destroyed at such a ridiculously rapid pace. When Biden get's in, we can work together to pressure him for change. Trump pays attention to nobody.
Some PAC is running an ad about Biden 40yrs ago talking about his education. Not a good road for Bonespurs. Since Biden may not have been accurate but he didn’t buy his way into school
Nah...he was allowed to say yes or no,they only gave him yes or no questions and refused to allow him to bullshit. Get used to it,after Biden wins there's going to be a whole bunch more questions...
Too late to find a better candidate so you rather the suffering continue with trump? With this belief you might as well change your bio to “I’ll be supporting trump cause im sure as hell not supporting Biden”
You’re not a democrat if you vote for trump if you do and think your a democrat you’re not educated trump is too far right to have any democratic beliefs Biden is a moderate democrat in the middle which means he will have republicans and democrats on his side good luck
Im voting for Biden I refuse to let my children suffer with Donald trump as president. Global warming isn’t a myth people are all over the streets of Michigan holding help me signs with their kids 5 6 years old no help from the president only tax cuts its time to end this shit
I wanted Bernie so bad I went to all his rally’s when I heard Obama asked Bernie to step down I was so mad but now it’s time to put others before myself we can’t allow trump to win and not voting for Biden will pave the way for Donald trump
The people who don’t vote for Biden will condemn many others to death suffering standing on corners begging for food and shelter cause trump and republicans wanna cut their income if you aren’t gonna vote for yourself think of those suffering biden wasn’t my first pick either
2/3 Obama Biden Holder spied on the Press; has to apologize to Germany/Merkel - MSM had Obama Biden adm spying throughout 8 yrs - O/B historical view is a PATTERN OF SPYING and violating The Constitution + working to overthrow Israeli PM
why is anyone surprised that Obama Biden spied in an Oppo party and Presidency of  - their entire 8 years was shown to be at its core spying eg c Clapper lied to America via Congress re Spying on All Americans; AP, Rosen/family; Congressional Committees; Merkel1/3
Biden is like we need to grow and open the country well then if he believes that why is he against pushing and fighting for basic fucking needs like housing, healthcare, canceling student loans, etc etc?
Stop being dramatic, every single poll I've seen shows a majority of Bernie supporters voting for Biden.
I'm going to level with you in this. Biden was not my 1st, 2nd, or even 4th choice, but he's the nominee. I will not only HAPPILY and ENTHUSIASTICALLY vote for Biden, but I will continue to share and donate and do whatever I can to help ensure he is elected
Less than 100 days to vote for Joe Biden #WeWillVote
Joe Biden is not the answer to any of the problems that we as a country face today.
This shit is just sad this lady obviously has issues and is all over the place I noticed that on her IG.  This is why It was crazy seeing people canceling Buttar without hearing out the whole story all while Khive and Biden supporters who talked so much
Absolutely correct. Biden nerds to hammer 🔨 that home. We've either lost a Family member  or we know someone who's died. This isn't a joke. This guy is still golfing it off, as if it will go away. Sick!
Should say ‘Dems self destruct’. Biden allies move to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president
There's a better than 50-50 chance that Biden is just a delayed Democratic version of HW.
I hate to break it to you all, but if a white dude would seal the deal for Biden, he'd be picking the white dude. The VP pick is solely a pick for political purposes with the secondary that they might be president someday, though based on history, they probably won't.
The best part about the speculation about Biden’s VP deliberation is the near anger from liberal commentators that Biden actually intends to be president rather than an empty vessel that gives a leg up for 2024 to one of his challengers
It’s annoying because it’s going to be portrayed by our presentist media (with a handful of presentist historians) as being true when it’s pretty much the opposite. It isn’t a man vs woman thing. This pretty much defines the VP. It’s just liberals wish Biden wasn’t the nominee.
Joe Biden says we're having a "crimate clises".  I think he's right...
When you do voting to that extent, you're gonna find more leftists, you're gonna find more Biden, SO I SAY TO MY PEOPLE "SLOW THE MAILING DOWN PLEASE!"
That is exactly why Biden was a Corporate puppet for 50 years.  He sucks at many things but grass routes fund raising is top of the list. He does and votes exactly how the corporate puppet masters order him to. Then they pay his re-election bills for screwing the working class.
Rioters and Looters for Biden.
Joe Biden has his work cut out for him in 2021
Can you picture Joe Biden doing the state of the union address? 😂
News Flash!!!!!! More people are following Trump than Biden.
Proud Detroit Suburbanite for Biden. Also, not afraid of low-income housing destroying my “American Dream” #SuburbsForBiden #detroitwillbreathe #detroitworksharder
Follow along..... If hydroxichloroquin treats corona there’s no panic. If there’s no panic Americans go back to normal life. If Americans go back to normal life no mail in ballots. If there’s no mail in ballots Dems can’t cheat. If Dems can’t cheat Trump will crush Biden.  Simple
According to #Democrat  women can not succeed unless he is elected President   #tcot #gop #migop
I can't even believe I am engaging you. Biden can complete sentences far better than your man can, put them side by side and watch. Pedophile background? Sthu. That is a lie.  Goodbye  back into your conspiracy theory room.
It was a bill Obama and Biden had in place that Trump ended and has resurfaced. I agree with the latter.   Just providing context.
That Instagram account for Biden I have a feeling is run by Warren people.
Are people supposed to ignore that Biden is doing very little to earn their vote are they supposed to ignore thar the party just voted down on progressive policies like M4A, legalizing marijuana and against Palestine. I mean seriously do they think people are this naive?
Settle for Biden is a joke. Gtfoh. The instagram is ridiculous who is this made for how does this make Biden appealing knowing that he won’t even support progressive policies.
No Biden will look foolish.
Last I checked, Obama and Biden bombed seven countries, invaded Libya illegally and furthered wars in many places. It’s time to bring everyone home and end the incessant wars. The 90s called. They want your unnecessary fear of the Russian boogeyman back.
Why use photoshopped pictures of Joe Biden being a creep when there's already a bunch of actual pictures/videos of him being a creep?
President Trump comes up with these nicknames for his opponents. Sleepy Joe Biden, Crooked Hillary Clinton ,lying Ted Cruz. What does he call himself?Dandy Don?
Wow they are really desperate to get people to vote for Biden knowing he is a fucking disaster.
Way more Biden ads over the last week in MI. When you take 45 plus days to address an emergency (dam breaks), you’re going to lose support. I bang remember the last time I saw a trump lawn sign unlike Biden signs on every other block.
Biden is in no way a fucking leftist you fucking clown.
Have you heard Biden speak ?
If your a Biden supporter your a  pedophile.
Bernie really should stop defending the party after all the shit they did to him and honestly fuck Biden Obama and the DNC for ruining this election.
He is all talk. Biden’s basement buddy
Biden's sitting there like "what a fool! Everyone knows you can't actively undermine the poor. You have to do it with euphemisms by attacking charity over unrelated culture war issues and banning charter schools/school choice"  Trump: "What do you guys think of debtor's prisons?
We have to fight up till election day like Biden is 20 points behind. Complacency is what cost Clinton the last election. Let's not repeat history. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
Joe Biden says that we have a "crimate clises".  I think he's right...
Joe Biden says we have a "crimate clises".  I think he's right...
Joe Biden says that we have a "crimate clises".  I think he's right...
The country currently faces many problems...and Joe Biden isn't the answer to any of them.
Joe Biden is about as radical as white bread.
Joe Biden is about as radical as unflavoured,oatmeal.
Joe Biden is about as radical,as vanilla ice cream.
Ha!  Those are Joe Biden rallies going on in Portland, OR and Seattle!  I didn't know that!
Trump holds another ego filled, rant, spewing his normal dangerous, emotional BS &amp; propaganda so the big crybaby can make himself out to be the “poor, weak, pathetic victim”.  Incompetency &amp; denial at the highest level during a pandemic.America deserves so much better. Vote Biden
In trump’s America. But he’s going to project it onto VP Joe Biden, who hasn’t held office in four years.
Also, much respect for you and your beliefs . I also noticed the above comment and that you follow DJT but not Biden. Just curious as to why.
Biden ads say he's going to "Restore the middle class" but, seriously, what does that even mean? It's just as nonsensical as "Make America great again." So much meaningless rhetoric, yet people eat it up like free shrimp during happy hour.
This is such nonsense. Today, Warren Democratics have been sharing a link for a fundraiser happening Friday to support Joe Biden. Of course we’re going to vote for Joe, he’s adopted half of Warren’s plans.
Look around you. There's nothing Biden can do yet
Biden and the Dems have a plan to set us back instead of moving forward and actually doing something for this planet and its people.
Thanks. I'm with you. I'd hoped for someone else but it's the hand we're dealt. We can deal with 4 years of Biden but we won't survive 4 more years of this.
Let's get this straight. I'm not in love with Biden any more than I was with Hillary but I would literally vote for a block of cheese before I would EVER vote for Trump and not voting is not an option. Even if trump were a good president(he's not), he's exhausting.
As far as sleepy joe Biden goes I would start mentioning how anyone can vote for a guy who last minutes his VP. Very unprofessional and is not very presidential at all. Ask him what his plan besides plagiarizing yours on what he would do to contain the China vir.
Sounds like you want Biden?
I’m not a fan of ACA. Highest priced to consumer plan on earth. We also pay more for prescriptions than any other country.  I could go on and on all night but you this is true. Nobody on earth has a valid argument against these facts. Biden is a pimp
They are supposed to be Corporate assholes on the right. The reason I’m voting for them is we nominated a corporate owned puppet too.  Trump may destroy Wall Street and Big Banking. He might end the ACA money grab.  Biden will do exactly what the puppeteers order him to.
Nadler is a complete baffoon. Law and order, Dems don't want it and are willing to let law abiding citizens suffer just to get rid of Trump, enjoy your shitty utopia if Biden gets in, you'll regret it about 2 years in...
Ask Gates Biden wrong on every foreign issue
I really like Duckworth. I feel like Rice, like it or not, will have the stupid unmasking baggage.  I’m a bit more excited for who Biden’s AG will be. They’ll be busy day 1.
...Hmmm... does have the capability of knowing when he's not wanted...m
Not my reasons but, I guess it’s his reason and unless Biden wins, it’s still a free country!
And Joe Biden's VP pick is... Raj Bhakta?!
The fake quote from Biden is such a perfect example of how the media thinks West Wing is real life.
I'm not a big fan of Donald Trump as President...but I do know this...the answer to any problem we are facing as a country is not Joe Biden.
According to Joe Biden we have a "crimate clises".  I think he's right...
Honestly immunity from religion isn’t bad.
Kind of like Joe Biden telling that black guy that he's not really black.  Welcome to Woke America 2020 where things only make sense if you smoke enough crack.
I don't think this will be true. No one is going to want to be opposed by the president from their party in a primary. Biden probably won't play as much in the primaries, though.
UNBELIEVABLE isn't it. Besides Repunlican questions did Barr ever anwser a dem ? They cut him short. This was about Trump, almost like a campaign rally for Biden
Corporate interests own the DNC and their worthless Centrist candidates.  Biden voted against me and the working class for 40 years. My entire ballot here in Michigan will be straight GOP.  How in the hell did you fools nominate a Republican?
I am. Full ballot. Michigan a swing state. Straight Red until the DNC is dead.  Biden is a worthless corporate owned puppet.
Because I like Trump more than Biden.  Trump may actually be helpful in destroying the Corporate constructed sham of a Banking and Stock Market.  Imagine if he burned that crap to the ground?  No republicans would be elected for a decade.  Biden is worthless.
Video: Frank Luntz Urges Joe Biden to Pick Karen Bass as Running Mate   Luntz bias is pathetic
TRUMP IA SOCIOPATH BIDEN IS NOT
I’m not a democrat. I am an independent.  I vote for who I like better.  Honestly I hate both of these worthless fools. But we had a chance for change but we nominated a Republican.  Trump 2020 sucks but so does Biden 2020.
I guess if Biden started calling Covid a hoax I might just let the chips fall where they may, but I probably wouldn’t vote, I don’t think I could vote for Trump.
Trump does not support Medicare for all. Biden does not support Medicare for all.  I hate both of them. Coin flip. Brb..... tails.  Trump 2020. And they spend 100s of millions on tv commercials?
Which we will do when we vote your dangerous &amp; deadly ass out and vote for Biden in November(by absentee ballot, returned by hand to county office).
Sounds like real bullets will have to do. Joe Biden’s idea for police reform was to shoot for the legs right?
Joe Biden is as far left as Calvin Coolidge.Stop panicking and take your  good for you.
Wall St knows Trump is a loser like everybody else so they are supporting Biden cause he is smart and cares about this country.
It’s astonishing that his supporters don’t see that.   Like when the Trump campaign runs video of riots and looting in the streets and claims that this will be Biden’s America when the video is literally of Trump’s America!  What is wrong with these people?!
Dear don, this is happening in trump’s America. VP Biden hasn’t held office in almost 4 years. Are you sure you passed that cognitive test   ?
You can’t be this ignorant.  Unpopular or popular doesn’t matter when the PAC money is used to buy and maintain ownership of politicians.  Pac money pays Biden like politicians to vote the corporate way no matter how popular anything is.
All I want for Christmas is a Biden WIN !!
Well if Biden becomes president remember you said "No thank you!" Pack up and move!! Just remember you are a puppet too then!!
You have it right Charlie! That’s why I’m voting For Donald Trump and I have loads of people gathering together on voting for him!We can’t take 4 years of Joe Biden!
There is an irony to this - can you imagine being working on his campaign and hearing him say that? Wish I were there to see their faces. I wold not put it on my resume. Worked on Biden Campaign- the nurse breathed into it trying to make it live!
Romney gained huge ground, Biden saved the campaign, Trump absolutely sealed the deal with lots of voters in the Midwest
Biden is the Houston Astros of politics, he can only hit when he knows which pitch is coming next and they haven’t found a way to extort Chris Wallace into letting Biden’s team provide the questions for another fake interview.
Fair enough. I’m at the end of my rope with these worthless centrists. Biden is trump on Ritalin.  Trump is spastic probably on drugs. Either way he is a much better candidate than Joe.  Trump could do real permanent damage to Wall Street and Banking industry.
Biden wouldn’t do your interview unless he’s allowed to provide you with the questions. He can’t hit the curve and the only way he can get to first base is if he gets hit by a pitch.
Me?  I don’t think Biden is a Corporate Owned worthless centrists his voting record proves it. Go ahead and google it.  Or just remain clueless. Either way, I don’t care.
Well said.  Biden has to end Bush tax cuts. That will eliminate corporate funding for many democrats. Mid term will be a blood bath.  Progressives ain’t giving him a dime. Boomers are dropping like flys. Biden won’t accomplish shit. GOP will rule for a decade after this mistake
The good news is I can vote against every democrat on my ballot and if enough folks follow my lead..... I can Hillary this Biden nomination and it won’t cost me a dime.
Because Citizens United which worthless Biden voted for states Corporations are people. They can donate any amount to any PAC. Corporate interests own 99 percent of politicians, every Newspaper, News station, lobbyist, and “ ALEC”.  I don’t have 90 million in checking to compete.
Joe biden even said we will have to remove trump by force.
F giving money to Corporate Joe Biden. I’ll give her $100.00.
Come on! DO NOT LET TRUMP WIN! If you were for Bernie, you should be for Biden!
Biden can even finish a coherent sentence. How is he going to run the country? How many years has he been in office, and what has he done for minorities? The first black president had done less than the current president for black people. Sounds like a no brainer.
What they need to do to Replace Biden with Bernie.
Like I said Bernie did a mistake dropping out. Biden played everybody with this task force shit it was mostly for show in order to get Bernie supporters to vote for him. Biden is garbage and so is the DNC.
And like the Republican party the    does not care about the people of this country. This is why I will not be voting for neither party in November just voting in August locally but fuck Biden and the DNC.
1000 people die a day in the US from Covid 19. 1660 a day from Cancer, 2353 a day from Heart Disease. Last winter 24,000-62,000 died in the US from the flu. Every 4 minutes someone in the US dies of a stroke. These numbers don’t scare me. Joe Biden in the White House does.
Because it’s not helpful and shows little of the reality of our political landscape. Biden will spend 4 years restoring calm and training his replacement. The VP choice is extremely important this time.
There are some things I disagree with but I can’t in good conscience vote for trump or Biden ,
If you were voting for Joe Biden’s policies you are a Republican. I realize that is unnecessary and rude. I apologize. You can’t possibly be at fault that Joe Biden voted for and with the GOP for 40 fucking years. No your fault. Your a follower. Right off the political cliff
By voting for Biden this coming November 👏👏👏
Big whip. Biden’s corporate owned ads is trying to get in the will
Not to me.  People die everyday. Hope your alright but I ain’t voting for Biden.
Ma’am. I wish you the absolute best life has to offer.  I’ve moved on from even considering voting for Biden.  Seriously though. Take care of your son and yourself. God bless
I hope V P Biden tears it down when he becomes president.
I do apologize about 3 responses. Soc security is the only thing I would vote to protect that we have now. Biden voted to cut it not once but twice.   No way I would ever vote Biden.
Gimme a break. Anyone can retrace what happened and come with an “I woulda” plan. What did Biden actually say, as steps were being taken?  Based on that, your Monday morning quarterbacking wouldn’t look too good.
The phrase “Healthcare available to everyone “. Is a typical GOP or corporate response. It means it’s available to anyone who can afford it.  If you vote Biden you are voting for a Republican.  Wow would you look at that?  We’re both voting Republican in our own way. 👍🏻
I’m voting trump. It’s a more effective 🖕🏻to the DNC it’s Centrists.  Biden is worst nomination since Hillary. Yet another worthless Corporate owned puppet.
Not uneducated nor am I manipulated by CNN. Americans know this election is all about socialism vs capitalism !  Joe Biden is a democratic  puppet suffering from dementia!
The good news is this. Trump will probably collapse the entire corrupt corporate owned financial system. Stock market too. I believe trump could screw up everything the GOP with Biden spent 40-50 years creating.  Biden wins..... who cares the misery will continue. Trump is a F up
MSNBC and CNN like to keep senior citizens money coming in.  If the seniors knew we won’t vote for Biden or any democrat without Medicare for all they might demand it. Since every senior in the country is already on it.
I’ll never vote for a centrist.  This is a pickle we are in here.  I no longer give a shit who the president is if we nominate republicans like Biden.  Tough tough spot.
No thank you to Biden. And every democrat on my ballot.
I’d be more worried that progressives believe you and Biden are just about as far right as Saager is.  Biden is a nasty Republican. Check out his voting record.  Biden is so shitty I’m voting GOP for the first time in my life. Eligible to vote since 88. Biden sucks
If trump is re-elected I hope the first change we see is no more centrist nominations.  If you nominate a Corporate owned puppet aka Republican in drag like Biden you can’t expect a rational person to vote for him.
I hope but nothing happened to little Bush and Cheney or the assholes that crashed the economy in 08 so I'm very skeptical. I don't see Biden going down that road. He's gonna try to "UNITE" the country. Good luck with that.
Biden = sexual harassment pander 😆😆😆
Very important program from Mark Levin about Left/Biden politics for Suburbs. Everybody should educate themselves about plans of the Left to change the American Life, which we do NOT want. Please watch, VERY IMPORTANT, but they won't tell you!
We all watched it live, we know he lied. We’re more worried about when(but really if) there will be consequences.  If the answer is Jan. 2021 under the Biden administration, whoa boy are Republicans in for a doozy.
They’re treating it like a game show, which I’d expect from trump. Biden is better than that
Yeah, no Biden or Trump signs on my lawn but don’t get it twisted, I’ll be voting blue down the ticket.
I love that you consider Biden the radical left. 😂😂😂
George this guy in pic is someone you could follow to understand what you and others who want progressives to vote Biden are up against.  Ryan is plainly stating where I and many others are coming from.  Between Biden and Trump is see two idiots I don’t want as prez
Page 4.  With Corporate interest, Wall Street, and Banking industry turns their back on Biden who is paying for his re-election in 2024?   This nominee is doomed to fail. Corporate puppets can’t go against corporate interests.  Not enough citizens are excited about him
Page 3. Stock market goes down as profits shrink on stock market as a direct result of ending tax cuts.  Now Wall Street turns back on Biden.  Business owners will lay off workers too to try and back into a profit. Continued
Let’s say Biden wins.  Bush tax cut would sensibly be first change he would make.  Once that happens Corporate Interests turn their back on him. Why? They pay more taxes if he ends bush tax cuts. Pretty easy so far.  Continued
Yeah it’s always some excuse or distraction to keep bending us over for the corporate fucking we have been taking since the 70s.  I’m all for protesting.  Let’s not forget Obama and Biden has the first cages for immigrants.  Might be civil war 2 in the near future.  Continued
We nominated a Republican. Biden is to far right to earn my vote. Since there is only 2 candidates with a chance, I’m voting to cause a Biden loss.  Sucks I know. But the nominee sucks.
Because I’ve voted straight blue from 88-16 and the results are revolting.  We pay highest healthcare costs in the world. We pay astronomical prescription drug costs. We are ripped off by every industry because corporate owned politicians like Biden vote across the aisle with gop
I truly believe trump could burn down Wall Street and the banking industry if he has another 4 years.  Biden does as Corporate interests tell him. Trump does whatever he feels like that moment.  Kind of like giving a todddler a loaded gun. Continued
Trump is not taking this job seriously. He is just coasting through this like High School.  Biden has been blowing the 1 percent or corporate interests for 4-5 decades.  Biden couldn’t raise 1 million dollars from grass routes. Nobody likes him except fossils.  Continued.
Another custom design. This one for supporters of the Blue Wave movement. Vote Blue No Matter Who Wave T-Shirt  #BlueWave2020 #BlueWave #biden #vote
This is true.  Earlier in this thread I mentioned I’m voting for our funtioning moron of a President instead of Biden.  Biden is a filthy Republican who I can’t vote for.  Many Republicans are voting for Biden. Why do you think many Republicans are not happy with trump?
We know now that Biden is a clown figure without an ability to think for himself. He represents Socialist Left Party that we shouldn't call "Democrat" any more!!!!!
Ah yes, lets suppress the voters who actually support Biden. Do you even hear yourself?
Our nominee Biden is Corporate Owned and can not under any circumstance Be trusted to side with the working class
Page 2.  Biden voted against me for 40 years siding with Republicans over the working class. Bernie fought for people his entire career.   Biden to me and many is a Republican.  You should not expect my vote on Nov 3rd.
You need to put Joe Biden's head on the guy who released the eagle...with a November 4th date!
Attacking Biden on foreign policy would involve Trump having a consistent, semi-coherent foreign policy.
I think you mean Joe Biden has never quit profiting off Americans.... Trump is the only one fighting for Americans...
It shouldn’t make me emotional when a conservative comes out in support of Biden, but this is how far Republicans have fallen.  There’s a grim fate for those in the GOP who went all in for their power grab.
What a wuss.  I bet Biden takes that down 1st thing.  What scares me is we get to see all these things happening and our hands are tied.
This confuses and upsets me every day. We don't need to follow that idiot to see his tweets. Why give him the satisfaction of following? Not following Biden kills me!!
I cannot fathom how anyone can't see that Biden is a Trojan Horse. If he won he would not be  running the Presidency.
Every time I see a Biden commercial I throw up in my mouth a lil bit
Vision:  Biden choose Michael Obama.  If they win, doubtful, Biden becomes diagnosed with Dementia.  Michael becomes President.  Chooses Hilary as Vice.  There goes the neighbourhood.
YESSSSSSS Mr. President Joseph R. Biden 100 more days until you’re elected finally &amp; we’ll be able to breathe a sigh of relief than we’ll just have to pray that time flies until your inauguration!!! #BlueWave2020TakeOver #Biden2020Landslide 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊
Then why not spy on Biden's campaign. Oh, I forgot. He's barricaded in his Bunker Basement. Wonder if Archie is there with him?
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.

Tucker Carlson is warning America that if Joe Biden wins Donald Trump's America will no longer exist.
"Retired" politicians younger than Trump and Biden is one of my favorite games. In addition to the obvious George W. Bush and Barack Obama, you have Quayle, Gore, Dean, Braun, Engler, Whitman.
Weekend at Bernies Biden edition
For your information Biden voted for and with Republicans for more than 40 years. Biden sucks. Biden wants to cut Soc Sec. Biden sucks. Biden is a Corporate Owned Puppet. Biden sucks. I ain’t voting for Biden. Biden sucks.
Ms. Rice, I expect to see you in the White House as the VP having a discussion with President Biden.
She's not going to be the nominee after posting this super unflattering picture of Joe Biden.
I’d be scared too if you lose the Senate and White House prison lurks for trump.  But I agree with you Joe Biden is a fucking Republican. I can’t vote for him.
I don’t like Joe Biden. I am not voting for Joe Biden.  I see polls that say Biden is way ahead. Ok. That’s fine. I don’t care who wins.  God damn are there a lot of trump tards who comment on Biden’s tweets.  If Twitter was an indicator Biden would have no chance. Hate is deep
Trump sucks. So does Biden. Not voting for Biden. Complete waste of time
What have the Democrats done.There backing Biden who has got lost in his basement.Theres almost four years wasted on this clown in the White House. I’m not voting this time.Trump has destroyed this country.The Coronavirus,lost jobs.He has done nothing but lied
He's lost Florida. He's completely f*cked😁👏🏿👏🏽👏🏻 #FloridaPoll "(CNN)Poll of the week: A new CNN/SSRS poll finds that former Vice President Joe Biden leads in the state of Florida by a 51% to 46% margin over President Donald Trump among registered voters."
Prediction. Biden ends  Bush tax cuts. Corporate interests cut off a Biden and lay off workers. Biden can’t raise grassroots money Biden loses in 2024 after accomplishing nothing from 2020-2024.
Lol 😂😂😂😂. Biden is the most disloyal pos democrat I have ever seen.  He is so bad I left the party. Vote against the working class for 40 years is loyal. Wanting to cut social security is loyal.  Maybe he is loyal and we are all in the wrong party.
I’m not voting for Biden.  I don’t think a vast majority is voting for Biden. You might be right. I predict extremely low turn out because Biden is a Republican
The polls assume progressives are voting Biden.  I’m not. We shall see
Biden has a 40 year voting record every Republican is envious of.  Biden is a Corporate owned pimp
Its everywhere google biden saying they will remove trump by force because he wont accept a biden win. Pelosi has said it many have said it
our pundit, and many of Biden’s campaign strategists, will have a difficult time conceiving that religious identity has the potential to trump racial identity if the former is perceived to be under threat. Campaigns lose when they miss movement. That’s Biden’s biggest liability
Won't he be dragged out by the same secret service that was tasked with keeping him safe because that same secret service will now be tasked with keeping Biden safe?
U r really going to callout Biden 4a verbal error Mr. “I draw on maps 2 cover my ignorance” &amp;don’t care if people lose their lives or jobs. I have 2 cover up my stupidity&amp;blame others every time I’m an idiot. Mr. Don’t Wear Mask because liberals r only doing it 2 make me look bad
Biden has Wall St. and the corporations. It's kind of in insulting for him ask for our money. I have vote for him but he can fuck right off if he thinks I'm gonna finance centrism.
I said it’s unlikely he’ll win, if he does, it’ll be because they did, I think. Biden has been pretty awful on religious freedom from govt interference. I’m sure Trump will hammer him on it the way he hammered Hillary on trade.
Who said I was a Trump follwerer? Umm last I looked this is global.  I will not vote for Joe but if there was a great independent out there I would vote. I voted for Obama in the last election. Biden will be a puppet. Back to the real issue. This has been all about money. Watch.
Biden and Trump seem to have major differences in how they conceive religious liberty. Biden sees it as a security issue, Trump sees it as a freedom of conscience issue. That’s the kind of difference that can drive votes
3/3  Durham must interview Obama Biden Rice Yates Comey Brennan Clapper Strozk Page and why is Wray still not being transparent w docs -he needs to be Replaced    GOP needs to stand w our Pres
2/3 next subject  Lindsay made a lot of commitments re ObamaGate and  has been MIA -just like most  - Obama Biden admin spied on an oppo campaign tired to weaken and take down a duly elected Pres -  has been silent Pathetic
Is this woman on crack? Joe Biden is hardly a racist.  #MSNBC
Agreed! We have to work as though Biden is behind. Never make assumptions!
Agreed! Voters who want health care should vote for Joe Biden!
I think you have a cute nose team biden
Biden is a Republican. You nominate a Republican then don’t be mad when I vote for the GOP
No way in hell I vote Biden
As long as Biden loses its all I care about.
Bernie beat Hillary in Michigan in 2016 head to head. Biden beat Bernie in every single county in Michigan in 2020. He is far more popular here than Hillary ever was.  And this is coming from someone who voted for Bernie this year.
You have been watching the videos and they are such peaceful people, burning, looting, destroying property. People injured, weapons brandished- either you are delusional like Biden or simply evil.
Copy and paste this text and tweet it:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
2/2 Maria bring bk Lindsay he talks a good game, but very little movement on Obamagate - he promised and is not delivering - Rubio took over other Chair and has done nothing  should be livid at Wray who is still withholding docs and AG saying Obama Biden won't be looked at
What?! Judge Jeanine is doing a campaign ad for the Biden campaign, also?! Oh, wait. This wasn’t intended to be an ad for  it just came out that way because #Impeached45 is such a complete disaster!! #Veterans #Resist #Resistance #VeteransAgainstTrump
Copy and paste this text and tweet it:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Yup. The thing with Biden is that Biden has had no plan to move to the left the only reason he did the whole Bernie task force was basically to get voters and for show.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
449 comments 3 were either pro Biden or Centrist Karen’s melting down worried we won’t vote for Corporate Joe
Hey. Whatever works.  All I know is Joe Biden isn't the answer to any question whatsoever.
Me too. He is everything I want in a president.  My hatred for Biden, the DNC, and every worthless centrist can’t possibly be measured. I’ll never vote for a non progressive democrat for life. F Biden
Pg 2.  Since then ( about 56-60 years ) corporate interests have given trillions of dollars to elect who they wanted in office. These hand picked politicians like Joe Biden have been puppets on strings passing corporate friendly laws. Continued
Yes, very good Ad. Vote for Joe Biden!
We need real American-bull dog journalists working for us instead against us. How do we get some freedom loving patriots in front row seats at these WH press briefings and in the faces of Pelosi/Biden/Schiff &amp; co. that will ask real questions that actually pressure them to help?
I'm voting BLUE Chaz. No doubt about it. In fact tomorrow I'm going to fill out my absentee ballot for August 4th. And drop it off or mail it. I haven't decided which one will piss off Trump the most. Voting absentee mailing it in. But anyhow GO BIDEN GO BLUE.
Someone should tell Joe Biden that. Because I was quoting him. Here's the link.
Because! If you don't vote for Biden! YOU AIN'T BLACK! Right?
The Liberty Daily – The Conservative Alternative to the Drudge Report  share Tweet w AG Barr- Durham Must go where facts evidence leads - this means he must interview everyone at that meeting Yates Obama Biden Comey etc -this was a Coup 1/2
“Joe Biden supports closed borders” I just cackled
I will never forget my favorite President, The amazing, smart, empathetic, hard working, strong, healthy, fit Obama. That is why I am voting for his right hand man Biden in November.
When Biden wins in November I'll be as happy as the men on Maury when they find out that they are not the father.
Joe Biden is 77 ,but on November 3rd he will be 46.
If it comes out from the pentagon we just found proof of aliens / off world vehicles in  Antarctica... would trust Deep State Biden the basement puppet or PRESIDENT DONALD J TRUMP to disclose what’s really going on?   Not even close!!! 🧨💥  🇺🇸👽TRUMP 2020!👽🇺🇸
Of course you are! How else are you gonna convince us there’s a big second wave that will keep our economy closed, keep Biden hidden in the basement, stop Trump from campaigning, and use mail in voting to cheat your way into whatever job you traded your integrity away for? LOSER!
Biden also didn't sexually assault his daughter, Ivanka. "If she weren't my daughter, I'd be dating her". Who's the pedophile again?
It's not Biden accused by 25 women of sexual assault. It's not Biden that would walk in the dressing room at the Miss Teen America pageants. It's not Biden that was best buds with Jeffrey Epstein. It's not Biden that had Russian hookers give him a golden shower.
Seeing Obama/biden selling out to China...wanting America to b a socialist 3rd world shit hole...demoncrats calling feds protecting federal buildings  from anarchists (not peaceful protestors) "storm troopers" ? ..now...that's sad...I'm sure u agree
Because folks like idiot corporate owned Biden voted for Citizens United resulting in corporate interests own our politicians at the federal and state levels and the media.
Biden will be too busy cleaning up the idiot’s mess.
I'm so tired of hearing about what the F Obama and Biden did.  Please focus on the important stuff.  Maybe you should focus on being a great President maybe people would take you more seriously.
Ironically, you just described Hunter Biden perfectly!
Can Martha fucking Ford sell the lions. Why the hell is joe Biden’s illiterate sister running an NFL team. Assembly lines don’t translate to football.
This is why this country is stuck we could do better but nope they gave us Biden vs Trump. What a fucking nightmare.
Honestly The whole Biden/Obama team up is such bullshit makes me so fucking angry because we should be moving forward but nope we got to go back to the Obama years instead of moving forward and this is who they want me to vote for absolutely fucking not.
Is Obama his fucking adviser what is this shit why is Biden so desperate to go back to how shit was during the Obama years how the fuck is that progress Obama promised a lot and could not get a lot of shit passed cause the Republicans stood in the way and because Obama did not
please put us back in stage 3 before we all die. Oh. And join biden in the white house this november. #PLEASESAVEUSWHITMER
Joe Biden’s platform: I can say racist things and get away with it. I can assault Tara Reade and get away with it. I can be losing my mental capacities but it does not matter. I have the media in my back pocket.
who is this clueless loser Mo?  Watching him is like listening to the Counterfeit News Network.  Nothing but lies and fake news.  A vote for Biden is for the end of our country.
An easy choice to make.
#DHS Also just legally put in writing, they lied re: NY Immigrant transit. This admin is NOT to be trusted with a shoe👟, let alone an entire human being😡😤.
We MUST keep track of them. Look at all the #KidsInCages they have lost😤. Or offended upon while being dragged maliciously away, or in supposed #FederalCustody.
When do Republicans stop relying on being gaslit?  Seriously, his suggestion to convince someone to vote for Biden is to make them afraid of someone else. That’s all Republicans have anymore.
Get ready to continue dealing with protests.Biden may not be the greatest.But Trump is a racist.compulsive liar.What has he done for you donut eating  support his sorry ass
Who, Trump? Please don't say Biden touches kids inappropriately?! 😰😡
She was a lot of people's first choice. But everyone correctly assumed people were too scared to put a woman at the top of the ticket, so they wasted their primary vote by using it AGAINST Sanders or AGAINST Biden, because ultimately we're all AGAINST Trump.  And so it goes
Telling rich donors nothing will fundamentally change. #JoeBidenJob
What is this how the fuck does this make Biden appealing?
It’s so weird all the criticisms laid at Biden seem to mostly ring true for Trump and his ilk. Could it be projection? 😉
Susan Rice, Perhaps An Unlikely Contender, Lands On Biden's VP Shortlist
They're accusing the wrong person. Sounds like Obama and Biden instigate and propagated destruction with no apologies
No it would be Biden’s America! The guy is a complete nut case! As for setting up Booths up for for for Democrats they cheat! And people are walking away like flys from the Democrats! I sure don’t want to raise my children in a socialist state or Country!
Biden can’t put two sentences together!
Biden should be in prision along with Obama!
Biden has slipped. Ok he's almost 80. You'll slip, I'll slip, we'll all slip. Mango Mussolini hasn't slipped, he's always been a fraud and a basket case. My dog ( an Aussie) is way more intelligent and more COGNITIVE. Maybe I'll have her primary your dear leader.
I choose to avoid anything commenting on Biden's mental state as much of it is just mean-spirited. There are 40+ years of documented politicial baggage showing why he should not be president.
You are more likely to hear Biden is having orgies in the White House than he does anything a progressive would appreciate.  It isn’t going to happen.  Vote 3rd party or if your an asshole like me vote trump. Biden voted with Republicans religiously since the 70s
Hell no. F Biden. Never Biden. You want me to vote for a Corporate owned pimp that voted against the middle class for 40 years.  I am voting straight red the entire ballot in response to nominating a worthless corporate owned centrist.
Your vote counts too.  Did you really vote for Biden?  No need to answer none of my business. God bless
There is no democracy now. This is an oligarchy.  F Centrists.  Every time you nominate one most of us vote Red.  Dukakis, Kerry, Gore, Clinton all worthless corporate owned centrists.  They all remind me of worthless Biden.  You might win this year. Hillary was sure of it 😂
Huh I believe every Democrat is voting for Biden.  If not he really really is the shittiest nominee ever.  Independents don’t like him at all in numbers. Most Republicans hate him. That I don’t understand. If I just saw Biden’s voting record I’d bet the farm he was a Republican.And you took a big shit right on the casket... campaigning for Biden at a funeral... a new low even for you
"What is he going to do between the time he loses and Biden is sworn in?" You must be thinking of  and
Its never going to stop spreading.  WTF.  How long until you let us free?  Oh I just heard, if Biden wins the very next day.
If Biden wins that report and any possible indictments are GONE
What a pathetic man. How did people ever vote for him. Vote Biden for an ethical, competent man who is aware of the world even if it Isn’t handed to him in his desk. Trumps desk is always empty.
Serious question. Do you think if you feel safe ,voting at the polls would be best because the vote is counted in real time and Biden can crush Trump early but if we have mail in voting, results take longer to come in and it may be contested. Any thoughts? Thank you
Serious Question: What does a Biden Cabinet look like? Will Sanders, Warren, Clinton(?) fit in there?
If you think they will vote for Biden, I think you need to think again.
💯 We need to embrace anyone who will not support Trump and the GOP. We all make mistakes. Voting for Biden is all that matters as we try to save our Democracy. That’s the tweet.
Stop disappointing me Biden! No one could be worse than Trump but I need to think you will not just reinstitute the old white guy club! Please  You have my vote but step up your game.
Biden shows responsibility for his health and his loved ones health by not showing up to a large debate and associating with someone known to be near Covid-positive people at various times.
Biden: “Truth over Facts”! 🙄. Here’s the truth!!!
Without his handlers screening questions!! Holy Moly!! Biden would be a train wreck!!! 😂🤣
Tweeted after he saw Biden tweet
Exactly I agree, I’m apart of the minority also because I don’t believe the stupid left bullshit that they keep cooking up. It’s always lies,Lies and more lies that they keep trying to say they are innocent when they aren’t! Obama, Hillary, Joe Biden, Pelosi, All of them! Corrupt
Biden is a demented fool that’s why he didn’t get to talk much he’ll get confused and say even more stupid stuff like closing the borders during corona is racist🤪🤭
Biden has been offending people of all races for decades. He and his family members have been on the take for just as long. Glad you woke up Leo. Hope you bring along many others who have been taken for granted by the democrats for so very long.
The unnecessary deaths and the destruction of our economy is on Donald Trump and his disastrous response to the Coronavirus . Vote Biden.Well, Biden's stated point-blank that it WILL be a woman, so they're just gonna have to deal with that regardless.  As for her "not being black enough"...Obama had a white mother and is relatively light-skinned, so that makes zero sense to me...but I'm a white dude, so (shrug)...
You have the older people even more worried. Stop worrying about Trump like a 9th grade cheerleader.. He's the President. You and Biden better worry bout if you have jobs after this year. The way it looks a 10 year old could do it better than you.
"Terrified" of Biden's massive draw...
More lies.
Also, the best way for Harris *to* position herself for another run at POTUS would be to DO EVERYTHING SHE CAN TO ENSURE BIDEN'S AGENDA IS SUCCESSFUL.  Undermining him behind the scenes isn't gonna make her look good, it'll just make it more likely that a Republican wins in 2024.
I’m attending Joe Biden for President’s event, “Racial Equity Roundtable with Ashley Biden and Michigan Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II” – sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
⁦ Shit, is this right?  That Biden will likely end up enjoined from any attempt to grant new DACA applications?
I feel better about both of those and if Biden is doing well he could expand in those areas.
There is really no choice, I will be voting for Biden. I can’t handle another 4 years of Trump!
This echoes Biden levels of racism. Likening poor people to non-whites. Race was not relevant here until you brought it up.
it's interesting watching the Biden campaign attempt to court the suburban 'middle class' (small business bourgeois)  at the same time that there's this culture war going in which we're supposed to believe that white ppl in the middle of the country are all irredeemable racists
Does that mean we should accept 26K dying/yr? Of course not. That's why the House passed ACA 2.0. That's why Biden's plan would be ACA 2.0 + a robust PO. Maybe it'll get through, maybe not. Hopefully we can cut it down to, say, 10K/yr over the next four years.
You haven’t read Biden’s plan, nor have you read the ACA 2.0 bill just passed by the House, have you?
They don’t want a hearing they want a linching mob. That is a dictatorship or communism, we tell you what it is you don’t have a say in anything we are the dukes and dutches. A view of the inside of the World Order, if Biden becomes president.
It’s a joke same o same o deny deny deny. Spend the time trying to get news topics to take away the importance of the Attorney General, if not make him a puppet. So you can say Trump is bad, not that Biden is good. Also tie down the economy to hurt the outcome of the election. BP
And here’s Biden’s plan:
1. “Democrat Party” is a right-wing phrasing. I didn’t know whether it was deliberate or not. 2. I’ve written extensively about the Medicare for America bill pushed by Beto and the plan proposed by Kamala. And Biden’s plan may not be 100% universal but it’s very close.
Except NONE of the Dems were ever proposing the status quo and Biden’s plan is pretty damned good:
THIS IS MY FAVORITE SONG!
Joe Biden was a U.S. Senator for 36 years and the Vice-President for 8. I guarantee you his political skin is thick enough not to risk the most important election in our lifetimes over some heated words a year ago.
This whole thing is stupid. Obama picked Biden as his running mate even after the “articulate/clean African American candidate” incident.   I don’t know if he’ll pick Harris but if he doesn’t it’s not gonna be because he felt slighted by the busing exchange.
At least I'm not naive enough to think that Joe Biden a stone-cold criminal would be a good president especially after Hillary Clinton and even worse criminal beat him out in the 2016 Democratic primary.
Joe Biden's speech right now about his platform is so excellent.  Clear and coherent.  And the subject Build Back Better plan is even better.
If Biden wants to gain a share of the senior vote held by Trump. Expand Medicaid and Medicare benefits. Expand social security benefits and reduce co-pays and deductibles and premiums. Lower drug costs. Add dental. Eyeglass. Hearing aids. Phase it in if necessary.
I like her cause I feel she will be out with Biden in one term.
Biden is puppets of Left and he is surrounded by people like Shakir, country is going through so much and his first priority is open ban on Muslim country doesn’t think about people in USA
Biden will never choose Kamala Harris, she is Indian origin, Biden advisor Fiaz from Pakistan will never allow Indian person to be Vice President
Not racest President Trump simple saying how need make sure Native american are Native Americans good example take look at Elizabeth Warren said she was Native american she lie how about Biden Obama 👇👇👇Democrats party now 🤯🤯🤯
He is also a criminal and Joe Biden will be arrested on November 4th along with this criminal son.
I’m rooting for Kamala, but would be ok with pretty much whoever Biden picks. Having said that, this was a stupid and insulting thing for Dodd to say. His job, as I understand it is simply to review potential running mates and give his advice to Biden, not to shoot his mouth off.
Jeezus.  Joe Biden is going to have so much cleaning up to do IMMEDIATELY.  I hope he's keeping a list (a very long list).
Joe Biden might be ahead by 10 in a game of Pinochle, but he certainly is not ahead by anything in the polls, he is hardly recognized around the country as any type of Challenger at all. I mean who are we actually trying to kid?
Joe Biden is going to jail on November 4th, he has a criminal and committed treason by hooking his son up with Ukraine and China. Those poles are fake, Trump is going to crush Joe Biden just like he crushed Hillary Clinton.
Yes, on November 4th Joe Biden should be arrested. He will not be protected anymore while pretending to be running for President like he is now.  What a complete disgrace that guy is.
That's good, but really who else were they going to endorse? Trump is by far and away the Clear Choice to be the President for the next four years, I mean who are we kidding? Biden is a criminal and the 241,000 police officers should arrest Joe Biden. How does that sound?
I already mentioned earlier a couple times today,, but I really think that Trump is probably most likely going to win all 50 states this year. I just got that gut feeling that Biden is going to get decimated in the election beyond belief.
Faiz Shakir, Bernie advisor, make him lost primary now advisor of Bernie, He his advising every thing wrong to poor Biden, he is not able to figure it out how bad he his at least will be good for Trump
50% of Strong Liberals Support Firing Trump Donors; 36% of Strong Conservatives Support Firing Biden Donors
No, that is actually Joe Biden when he hooked his son uo with China and Ukraine,,, that is totally Criminal.
Ladies and gentlemen the next President and First Lady of the United States, Joe &amp; Jill Biden
We are waiting we want answers and we want Justice Joe Biden Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton belongs in prison they are criminals and we the American people are very upset about the activity that they were doing while in charge of our country. We want Justice now,,!!!Trump 2020.
Poll: Anxiety props up Biden, Trump voters fervent
Because he's Joe Biden, and that's literally what he does? Why are you surprised?
Sterling Heights, Warren, Clinton Twp, Roseville are all diversifying.   Of course Macomb is not Oakland County but it’s not Monroe either.   Macomb is densely populated suburb.   Even a small win by Biden would be a huge swing in 2020.   Suburban women will boost Biden.
Macomb County is still a suburban county with is diversifying.   The key to Macomb is and always has been suburban women and that's why Biden will win Macomb County
The GOP did find an extremely strong candidate for this race.   Biden is likely to win this seat so there would need to be more than a few ticket splitters.   It's possible.
Will do future president Biden! Thank you for the Tweet regarding our current one. I refuse to verbally say the Sociopaths name. It was the first tweet on his page for about 30 minutes. You have Michigan, all us educated housewives in the suburbs, and us Black Lives Matter folks.
Still in his basement? Biden campaign declines interview, one week after Chris Wallace's Trump sitdown
Hummm Sarah banks just saying if I had to chose a sin for a sinner her she Black young and looking at her movies she Gay/lesbians friendly her movies are XXX no biden not Xander cage the other XXX no biden not alchole the other XXX damn it biden not 30 she dose porn OK Damn😅🤣😂
Twitter and Facebook become targets in Trump and Biden ads
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.   DONALD TRUMP IS LIEING TO YOU AGAIN.
"Joe Biden believes African Americans can be stepped over, walked on ..."  How about kneeling on?
"Joe Biden believes Africsn Americans
That Biden design is really cool. Whoever designed that sign must be really cool😉
Loved the most recent episode and very much believe these officers illegally kidnapping people should be prosecuted but is it really a good idea to force Biden to take a position on issues like this that can be twisted in Trump ads?  Don't want him to commit to no.
Charlamagne Tha God says Biden should 'shut the eff up forever' after calling Trump 'first' racist POTUS
#DementiaJoe ‘Rambling episodes of incoherence’ Howie Carr: Joe Biden says … well, we don’t really know – Boston Herald
Last year... Here's every word of Joe Biden's most rambling answer.
Dear Joe hope you heard what Michael Moore sais “Biden needs to start acting presidential now hold morning brienfing every morning and tell the public what he would do now, and then every night a fireside chat. Every day from now until November \!
Good morning Miss Janice 😊🤗
I won't sleep well until January 20, 2021, with Joe Biden having been sworn in as President and the GOP no longer controlling the Senate...and even then I'll know the work has just begun.
I bet Biden is already developing a program.
Should the only Biden ad just have Trump saying: "Slow the testing down, please"?
And won’t take a single reporter’s question to boot... Karl Rove: Joe Biden's lackadaisical coronavirus, climate and economic ideas
Civil rights attorney blasts Biden for 'insulting' African Americans: 'I'm Black and I'm not voting for him'
Hallelujah! Charlamagne Tha God says Biden should 'shut the eff up forever' after calling Trump 'first' racist POTUS
In case you haven't noticed, Donald Trump bears zero resemblance to any other President in the history of the country.  So Joe Biden promises not to shoot anyone in the face, then tried to do so but shot them in the leg instead, you'd rate that "Promise Kept"? Is that it?
Tramp offered to take a test with Biden. Let’s have psychiatrist evaluate both of them and release the results. He asked for it.
Katy. Love you. Let’s have Trump and Biden be examined by psychiatrist and tested but the results probably be released.Trump said he and Biden should take a test.
Hi Nicolle. Let’s take up Trump and have both he and Biden examined by psychiatrist and tested. Results will be distributed to the public.
Joe Lieberman stood up and tried to block Joe Biden from becoming Vice President.     His own son has repudiated his healthcare position publicly in order to win a Democratic Senatorial race in a red state.   Lieberman left the Democratic Party a long time ago.
Show you don't care about the little children I see you fondling them on TV Joe Biden how are we gonna trust you will our children we will we will be snatched out of your way and you would have your will be done not gods
Yes. As I note in my deep dive, I'm actually a little puzzled by Biden's "Medicare 60+ buy-in" addition, since it seems to be *in addition to* his Public Option (which basically means those 60-64 could choose between an employer plan, ACA plan, Medicare *or* his new PO).Jim Jordan Asks Google if They Are Actively Helping Joe Biden Win the Election - Google CEO Sundar Pichai Doesn't Say "No"!

Joel Pollak: Google 'Completely Killed any Stories About Joe Biden from Breitbart' on Its Search
No room for traitors in exchange of releasing terrorists!!! You know, some Libs I’ve debated on here have even acknowledged that this wasn’t the best move in the Biden/Obama era, kind of like Trump bombing Syria or John McCain POW comments. Not the best move (Cont)
So, again, how do you feel about Obama/Biden trading 5 terrorist officers for an Army Deserter who left his post and weapon? 🤔
This is what they don’t understand. I’m certain Trump did TWO interviews with a mainstream outlet already!! Where’s Biden? He needs to now go behind enemy lines, unless he’s a chickenshit
So you’re comparing an opinion person like Maddow to a news person like Wallace?   That’s like saying Biden should be interviewed by Hannity or Tucker 😂😂😂
Then why are you scared of him interviewing Biden?  Do you just want him to answer softball questions? 🤔
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
This is a Trump campaign ad. Joe Biden needs to appoint a press secretary and they need to start do a daily briefing. Like an actual briefing with facts and useful information.
This is the “great” America that you created in 3 short years, donnie  It didn’t happen on Obama’s watch and will clearly have to be reconciled on Biden’s. You, on the other hand, walk around making messes for others to clean up...in Nov, we’ll say it loud!
I'm assuming he means "The first blatantly racist modern president." As in the first one in the last several decades after we learned racism is shitty. Biden is good at delivering speeches other people write for him but not so great at improv.
The China Communist Party (CCP) Announces It is Behind Sleepy Joe Biden for President - Is Likely Doing All They Can to Stop TrumpI'm not familiar with the Biden comment you reference, but since charter schools are public schools, all of which are funded almost entirely by state and local funds, why would charter schools disappear?
Born &amp; raised in #PA, MA from   professor at #PSU for 30 yrs &amp; Ed Rendell long rubbed me the wrong...It's shut-up time...Give #Biden the space he needs &amp; deserves...He's not the candidate of the Dem pros nor should his VP be
Thread by  When Biden promised 4.5 months ago to pick a woman as his running mate, it felt like a consolation prize for people wd for a woman president. But the process of making good on his promise has gone from exciting to insulting. (1/x)…
1) She should be removed from any VP lists, short or otherwise, pronto  2) Chris Dodd should be told by the Biden campaign to have a Coke &amp; a smile, and shut the f up.
Agree...Will white Dem pros stop mansplaining what's best for Biden to do I'm not listening Let Biden make his choice &amp; then full steam ahead against #TrumpPence I won't be surprised if Biden picks a fighter...smart, experienced &amp; articulate
I get you want more... right now we have bleach drinking guy or Biden...that's the race
The sad thing is she is there doubt she votes for Biden doubt she voted for Clinton she is a person determined to destroy the democrat party
Clyburn is about the collect on his "chip" when Biden names either Harris or Rice as the nominee. If he wants an African American woman on SCOTUS, then Rice will be the VP nominee while Harris takes the court position. But first, let's not put the cart before the horse. Vote!
Biden aides be like "Kamala good" "Kamala bad" but Biden just be like
If Biden is actually listening to the likes of Rendell and Dodd, he will lose. I trust these are the same party leaders that recommended Tim Kaine (a bland, uninspired choice), that probably nailed the loss of the election last time.
Biden by 4 points
I really want Florida to be in Biden's column bc it counts its votes so fast, I want a clear result in election day atleast from one swing state
How wonderful to see the graphic on your show of ALL those women who are qualified to be Joe Biden’s VP!!!!
Bass's issues with Cuban voters go well beyond the bizarre statement she made about "El Comandante." She worked as a literal organizer for the pro-Castro Venceremos Brigade at one point.   Biden would be effectively ceding Florida to Trump if he picks Bass. Idiotic.
next up: Washed Up (I mean, Out) writes Biden’s campaign song
"If" -- we know what Biden said; you're just lying about it.  Do you lie like this in court or in front of a judge, or do you save that for Twitter?
I’ve been feeling pretty good about Joe Biden’s chances in November and now I’m having a sinking feeling that we’re fucked. We shouldn’t have to, but we need to normalize dropping off your absentee ballots at the clerks office.
Lmao no fan of Kamala but it’s lunacy to expect any Biden VP to result in antitrust suits against tech companies. Weird flex.
Trump campaign temporarily halts TV advertising in Michigan, but plans to outspend Biden 4-1
his campaign didn't put it out, but it's by far the strongest argument biden has.
And we also know that Biden is the 'pretty boy' face that the machine has placed on it's masthead for this election. When that face is essentially a cadaver, you're a very ugly machine.
Biden ain’t got ass compared to Zuck tho.
So what is our government doing about this. Doesn’t someone have the ability to have him removed before Biden is in office?
Great WAPO piece on each state’s past and present electricity generation sources, clean (low carbon) and dirty (fossil fuel). US is now at 38% clean headed to 100% by 2035 if Biden is elected.
Why take a picture? So you can claim voter fraud when Biden loses?
Same. And everyone I know has had this same experience. But Biden Boomers with their pensions, social security, and Medicare don't give a shit about us.
Yes! Memes are the things that’s going to win this for Joe Biden.
This election is too important to bet it on America’s limited ability to grok statistics.
#medtwitter we need a pithy compelling # to rally for #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica #Biden We’ve seen effect of current administration on the biggest #publichealth crisis of our lifetimes. We need to #GetOutTheVote to protect America’s health.
No, we do not want what we've got !! That's why we are voting for Joe Biden. Trump has trashed the US abd hopefully,  Biden will get us back on track.
Nobody cares, a critical election is coming. We need to focus on whether Trump is going to get another four years or Biden.
I'm not thrilled w/ #JoeBiden, but we really can't take another 4 years of #Trump! #Biden is endorsed by Planned Parenthood &amp; Clean Water Action. #Thirdparty candidates cant win. In '92, #RossPerot got 18.9% of the popular #vote, but got 0 electoral votes. Please vote this Nov!!!
That should unnerve him sufficiently. Let Biden know, and convince him it’s not malarkey, it’s cruelty.
Unless the Senate Ds decide to go outside the Senate, which there's no rule against their doing.  They could name Biden.  Or whoever they wanted.  Not that it's actually going to happen this way. (2/2)
Democrats have no plans to cheat at this election, unlike trump who has spent millions posting fake news stories on Facebook about Biden, or how he worked with Russia last election, or how he tried to get Ukraine to spread lies about Biden. Stop spreading lies Liz.
When this is the worst thing you have on Biden, you all are screwed.
There is only one presidential candidate on the ballot who can compose coherent sentences and is oriented x 3. And she's not  Biden or Trump.
Is Devin waiting for the big reveal?  Right before the election like Comey did with Hilary?  Some fell for it once, but not again.  I will vote for Biden despite any information received by any foreign or domestic source.
Biden is going to win BIG TIME
Yes voting for Biden!
I’m Joe Biden and I forgot this message.
Also I feel like if we get a margin from Oakland and Washtenaw, we’ll get a good indication of how close the race is   For example, if Biden is winning Oakland by 18–20% it’s more or less over for Trump
Hahahaha. By ramble and incoherence in today’s press conference, Trump has no clue what is up. Looks like he’s high. Watch Biden’s recent appearances. He is on the ball. Not the doctores clips you saw on OAN or wtf-ever.
He is really not well. Looking forward to President Biden and a coherent press conference that isn't filled with lies, exaggerations, self-congratulations, etc. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
There are good arguments against Harris as veep. None of these are among them. Whoever Biden picks should immediately begin campaigning to become his replacement on the 2024 ticket. That’s exactly why his choice is so important.
Why do i have a feeling we will be seeing a lot of this tweet on Nov. 4 if the results are clearly in Biden's favor and Trump suddenly gets every-vote-must-be-counted religion?
How long until Trump floats arresting Joe Biden?
Joe used to be quite articulate - but progressives wouldn't like what he said.  Joe today looks out of it, confused - but progressives will like the content.  Why? Progressive political operatives are manipulating an older Joe Biden.
Have you seen NLRG and Biden in the same room
He's putting the boot into BLM and rad progressives for the Biden campaign. This is centrist electioneering.
Because he's been formally instructed to degrade and denigrate the progressive wing of the party, and radical progressives, and BLM as a Biden campaign tactic.  It's shameless.
Seeing broad support from cops away from Biden and towards "Cops for Trump" deeply saddens and concerns me. There are serious issues with policing in this country, and yet we can't have a serious conversation.
That’s all the cognitive testing I need from Biden.
So #HermanCain has died from #COVID19  anyone on the Right paying Fucking attention now? Its real not a #hoax you keep going down this path Biden is a Shoe in to win. You all be dead. Trump is killing his base but keep following the #OrangeMessiah
Unlike Black Friday, This Is Something I'd Wait In Line For ALL NIGHT! #Biden #Biden2020 #FlushTheTurdNov3rd #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
I Mean This Is As Delusional As It Gets! 🤦‍♂️ #Biden #Biden2020 #FlushTheTurdNov3rd #VoteBlue #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
When I was younger I was excited to be able to vote in a presidential election, this election I think I’d rather die in a fire than have to pick between Donald Trump and Joe Biden
If Trump Wins, Biden and the Democrats are going to claim that Trump cheated and start another investigation... if Biden wins, Trump is going to claim that the Democrats cheated. Then he’s probably going to reject the election results and find a way to stay president 😭
We all need to work together to dismantle systemic racial injustice: “No community should be poisoned, no community should be disproportionally exposed, no community should be subject to things that make us die”
Unless there is a miracle, things won’t start getting better until after Biden is sworn in.
No longer true - the Trump ad criticising Biden's education is airing in the Detroit market at least 5 times a day.
I don't think this is crazy. I think this is intentional manipulation. He knows he's in cuffs the second Joe Biden takes his hand off the Bible.
“Biden chose to taint the President essentially with a charge of treason.”  TREASON  Oh, and the bit about how Trump can’t possibly be hindering the USPS.  This didn’t age well,   Not well at all. You are part of the problem.
via ⁦ This is what totalitarianism and the crumbling of democracy looks like. America is not an exception. Wake the F up America
If Biden ran in 2016 instead of Hillary bernie would have never ran because joe biden is bernies good friend. young people wouldn’t have broke away from Obama and the democrats. Therefore they’re torturing us. They’re the parents we are the kids. #werefucked
y’all better vote blue in the upcoming election that means vote BIDEN
Federal planWTF the states are all different.Why am I wasting my time on U?I just canbelieve what a asinine question. Vote for Biden he IS AS MUCH OF AN IDIOT AS U,voting 4 someone with dementia. 4 more yrs.of Obama worst 8 yrs ever U want socialism you’ll get it hope u have $$
YO! If it really IS Kamala though...
Here we see Biden being led about like a invalid. No masks to be seen.
Oh yeah Trump is the one you have to worry about🙄
Lmao, Biden has ran for president in three different decades, I probably wouldn’t say that if Joe was my candidate.
Nobody would ever accuse a man of being "too ambitious,  and that he'd only focus on becoming president if he becomes VP"
We'll keep working to make sure, but yeah. He's dead here. #Michigan
Well, being a rational human being, you see it in a non-political way.  It's Biden or Trump and pretending it's otherwise is seeking to end America as we know it.  Politicians aren't known to be the smartest people unfortunately.
Biden, the least effective candidate. Great going,
If we do it right (which after we’ve seen how Trump has handled COVID I don’t think he can do anything right) I think all of the issues you listed could be improved or solved as part of another New Deal level economic investment. And I think Biden can do it right.
I can see where you’re coming from. I know a lot of people don’t like Biden’s policies but I am excited about increased manufacturing in the USA primarily bc I believe it will lead to job creation and increased minimum wage and improved immigration policy. It’s all connected.
HUGE! Major 2020 Poll Should Have Joe Biden Absolutely TERRIFIED
Idk I feel like most people don't see (rightly so) Biden as a person thats going to shake things up. This is just from my convos with millennials and family boomers, he's more of a status quo kind of guy
Biden's climate plan includes Cash for Clunkers to speed electric-car adoption:
There’s a lot that can change in the next 100 days but Biden is leading by 8-12 points   Like Obama won Indiana very narrowly just like trump did by 10,000 votes and then Romney won it by like 10 in 2012
I know a person who literally made thousands of calls on the Bernie Dialer in 2016.  I’m an introvert who hates talking on the phone, and **I** called for Bernie.  Biden generates as much enthusiasm as a dead fish 🐟💀
At some point, you do need to pick a side, because people's lives are at stake. You may not like Biden, but Trump is the antithesis of the message of Jesus. Voting for Trump is incompatible with Christianity.
A lot of democrat operatives said that Michelle And Barack Obama will provide the needed energy that will influence young voters to vote for biden. This is their strategy lol
Joe Biden and many of Dems are the criminals.
Biden will have about 150 immediate stop gap measures to put in place the moment he takes office! That's only to stop the bleeding!
Biden is evil.
August is close bringing us one step closer to #flippinthemitten for Joe Biden. Register to vote and please join us to phonebank.
There are many reasons to join Team Biden...but having  on the nationwide zoom call is probably the most important one
Biden Agenda for Racial Equity would be much better
I would vote for a thousand Kanye West’s before voting for one Joe Biden.   Nothing Joe Biden has ever created us a fraction as good as “Graduation.”
YESSS basickaly too joe biden feels like he’s the exciting progressive candidate l. No way he wants kanaka who will take his thunder away haha. Why u think biden almost picked boring klobuchar lol
starts out making sense, which is disorienting tbh, but then  "Armed mobs of Joe Biden voters torched buildings, smashed cars, attacked police officers. They rioted."  Bill Hicks --he must be taking the drugs that make eggs look like your brain.  #PortlandProtest
Isn't that...kind of what we would want? I don't see Biden being a two-termer...
A hypothetical Biden administration will be just as stymied as the Obama administrations unless McConnell and all the rest of the GOP senate are voted out or die of COVID.   Vote. Help your friends request absentee ballots.
If that's a key task, there's not much of a reason to elect Biden.  The Park Police are a tiny problem relative to everything else.
Rashida tlaib is the tough people we need. I love that she doesn’t go along with Biden and Clinton
Now would be a perfect time for Joe Biden to have 1 of those speeches that says “"I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me...””
Stacey Abrams touts Biden plan to support minority-owned businesses with Michigan entrepreneurs
It’s so hard Beth that’s what I tell my family. My family believes the democrats will save them. They believe Russia gate. And they believe biden will fix everyone. It’s so hard convincing boomer parents they’re getting screwed
The only reason to vote Biden is to end the Trump shit show? Got anything else?
Bernie said he will support the democratic nominee Biden supports the DNC platform so by default bernie has to support it. Bernie is trapped
Think Biden picks Warren with an eye toward shoring up Nevada and Midwest.
Unfucking believable! Bothered? You talk about lower income individuals like they are some sort of thing and inconvenience. I cannot wait until November 3rd! 👋 #Biden #Biden2020 #FlushTheTurdNov3rd #FlushTheTurdNovemberThird #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
Newsom's new $3.7M mansion gifted to the governor under questionable cir...  via  wow cannot even walk the talk maybe more corrupt the Biden must run in Democratic genes / Party
I feel bad that this country is going to hurt from you voting for Biden out of respect for your feelings rather than facts. That’s why you say you “was a republican” you decided to go with your feelings and be selfish.
I swear trump voters critics Trump way more than Obama/Biden voters at this point
Yeah. I don't think Biden means an auto-loss in 2024. I choose to hope that some VRA renewal and other actions plus continued demographic moves (Texas) can get Harris over the line against Hawley/Cotton.
I've give this to Joe Biden, he's never several shades of skin color different from his nose to his hairline.
I think Biden might resign mid-2023 to give her the incumbency advantage.  He didn't want this shit. He wanted to retire and hang out with Dr. Jill.
This makes a lot of sense, but I'd focus the spending on winning the State House and hope that trickles up to Biden. Not the other way around.
No joke. Biden can’t cover up his very frequent disorientation: to person, PLACE and time!
Biden’s running mate is irrelevant to the August primary ... 🤔
I’ll say it now. President Biden, tear down this wall.
Biden has a perspective on parenting relatively few men of his generation do.   That may explain why he's gotten behind an ambitious child care plan that, whatever its policy particulars, makes action more likely.
Welcome to the internet. I’ve had people from all over the world tell me that I have to vote for Joe Biden, I think they’re liberal babies, but I would never be lame enough to call it foreign interference.
I see ingolfs point but I also see that Biden is from the brand that would routinely institutionalize their “crazy wives” back in the day to allow themselves to continue affairs, debotchery and what not.  Money is a thing but getting rid of “problems” is also a thing. 🤔🤔🤔
Little Jerry Nadler and his band of idiots didn’t focus on Covid instead wasted time on impeachment for WHAT? He meant to throw BIDEN AND HUNTER in jail but his pee brain got confused. Waste of time as Senate said FU, he should have paid attention to covid instead of his circus
Full list of President Trumps Accomplishments       May take you a couple days to finish. Then check out everything of Obama GONE. His legacy will be Durham Obama people thrown in jail. Let’s hope BIDEN or Susan Rice isn’t 1 of them if she is VP choice
The primaries offer a little insight into the general where Bernie was able to win Michigan with out state whites the dislike for Clinton was obvious Biden carried every county in Michigan and wiped him out different feeling this time around
I’m a voter. Pretty sure my opinion is all that matters in regard to my vote. It’s misguided to promote Joe Biden as a candidate for president in regard to my vote
The ads here in Michigan are mostly about Biden’s mind slipping. I don’t think that’s news to anybody. He needs to drive home how much taxes would increase under Biden.
Maybe they’re a bot trying to mess with us. I doubt Biden would pick his VP based on a threat
It's very ironic that she's not supporting Biden, considering she represents  a superdelegate who casted her vote for Clinton back in 2016 even though Sanders gained more votes in Michigan
Apparently I was working on a map actually (I think it was the Biden 9.5-point county win map I scrapped because I hate Virginia's counties)
But what about the words from Biden's announcement? Do you think those are placeholders?
Lmao if Biden actually announced its Kamala on August 1st
Biden Says Vice Presidential Nominee to Be Picked Next Week  #SmartNews
I disagree. They are not citizens . I feel like if I vote for Biden I am voting for you and I do not like your values. I do not want to save everyone. I wish you would leave! I scream every time I see you openyour liberal progressive mouth. It makes me not want to vote for Biden.
Good grief; who are you going to support besides Biden? SE Michigan is going to him with or without you.
Biden rolls out plan to combat racial inequity in economy - The Hill
Good stuff  Pam👍, really tough seeing Rice get it.  Biden’s age/health, very important vote. Have a great day!!😉
Found this on Facebook by "What's Wrong With Donald J. Trump" 🙌 #Election2020 #Debates2020 #2020Elections #politics #elections #Trump #Biden
Maybe the New Conservative branch of the GOP, (non-Reagan Republicans) should change their name. They could be the  "Fascidickists", "Gonardians", "Penistocracy" or how about "Conspiranauts", "Anoncraticsquez"? OR maybe they should just burn in... hello Biden!
This is reassuring, but Biden is going to win NY easily even if zero 2016 Trump voters flip. Can we get similar stories from MI, PA, WI, FL, AZ, and NC?
This is priceless. The last 3 seconds should be in every Biden ad from now until 11/3.
Would be interesting to see in person early vote stays up too (Dems usual strength) or if Dems are cannibalizing that with vote-by-mail
I'm all for ignoring the polls. But it's not possible.   I'm all for ignoring the media. But it's impossible.
One big reason 2016 feels a lot like 2020 is there has been no discussion about the press' role in 2016 and what's going to happen when, say, Barr or the DOJ announces an investigation or an indictment of a Biden -- or, even, of Obama.   Don't think it's coming?
Wake me up when Joe Biden kills 200,000 Americans
Good piece, makes the hopeful case for progressives: That Biden, like the Democratic Party, is moving away from the 80s-90s mindset.
Question: is Team Biden applying any significant effort and resources to “win back the olds?” (Full disclosure: I’m an “old”) Or is this largely rhetorical? Because as long as REAL resources are going to be plowed into base voters, he can smile and wave to “the olds” daily.
Should not have picked Joe Biden if you thought this was true. What a horrid mistake
Not illegal, what’s illegal is the lies about Joe Biden in your stupid campaign commercials. Straight up lies. You’ll never change.
Biden won Tlaib’s district by 20 points in March. (Tlaib, incidentally, won it by one point.)  Yet she’s claiming she won’t endorse Biden because her constituents don’t want her to?   If you’re willing to sacrifice our nation’s future because you hate Joe Biden, just say it.
Joe Biden and Michelle Obama
Well, we know BIDEN listens to his daily briefing. So he’s a lot more up I. Current events than your golfing excise for a President dad.
They know this person will be President,they really don’t have a good candidate. Too bad Warren didn’t choose African A. as in her DNA rather than Indian she would b perfect Just ask her. She should repeat her DNA test.Joe Biden is not fit for office hiding him won’t change that.
Maine I think, I didn’t expect Cunningham to run so far ahead of Biden but that looks consistent in polls (don’t know it it’ll hold up to this extent)
I am not thrilled with Joe Biden, but we really cannot take another 4 years of Trump! We need some of the below policies. Please vote this November!!!
I think those numbers are pretty good since she has to go up against Duggan and all his allies. Yes, Biden is very popular in her district and endorsing him isn’t controversial but she has a right to not endorse him if she believe that he won’t be a good president.
Because she has incumbency advantage and it's not a crowded race, yes. And still, those aren't fantastic polling numbers for an incumbent, esp. considering undecideds. The point is that Biden is popular in her district, so endorsing him wouldn't be all that controversial
Here’s a thought: that’s the most Hillary campaign thing Biden could possibly do.
Just set up two chairs six feet apart at Biden’s assisted living facility.
You were trying to insinuate that Biden is more likable in her district by stating he won by 20 points and she only won by 1. Then I pointed out her recent poll numbers which includes a 70% favorable rating. Hence me saying do a little fact finding.
We people are the only ones with sense.   Not about to let the crazy AF radical left run anything with Biden as some titular head.
TX 17 has a small portion and its largely uncompetitive unless a massive Biden landslide
Follow the actions not the words. The DNC and Joe Biden are not for the people. Lower the age of Medicare eligibility to zero. Keep your existing insurance if you want but a viable option for everyone else.
The  is openly supporting Talib. Will be awkward when they also support Biden
The Democrat party is keeping Joe Biden in hiding until election day so he won't have to debate Trump ever! What BS 💩
#TrumpleThinSkin #lyingTrump  I know the best words too! November 3rd, Biden, adios tang
Hey! #lyingTrump want to #MAGA2020 Vote Biden
Right, the unknown Biden    🙄
He’s trying to insinuate that Tlaib is in trouble this year. Yes, Biden won her district overwhelmingly, but Tlaib will do the same.
I hope everyone realizes that we need to vote overwhelmingly for Biden to try to offset any Russian interference. He is pushing so hard to have Republicans vote by mail, something’s up. Vote by mail if possible and send it in weeks before the election.
Moderates can and should call attention to the obvious hypocrisy of castigating Biden for the same votes that their newfound hero Ed Markey has taken — NAFTA, crime bill, Iraq War, etc.
WEDNESDAY: The good people of  and  will be hosting an online roundtable discussion with three wonderful foreign policy experts! Tune in to hear about Joe Biden's plan to elevate diplomacy and restore American global leadership.
They lost me when they promoted the phony rape thing trying to get Biden to drop out
Big mistake. She won’t endorse the Dem nominee Biden. I hope she loses and will donate to her
There's no way in hell Joe Biden can turn this all around in 4 years. First, he'll have to deal with the absolute massacre that the flu and COVID-19 are going commit over the winter. Then he can maybe start fixing the economy, but not if the Democrats don't have the Senate.
Depends. If Biden loses in November it might.
Biden's "ready on day one" basically limits the field to female Senators and big-state Governors, and there are quite a few of those, but not "tons".  If you include Representatives and Mayors, you might as well also include CEOs and reality show hosts.
This piece by  treats US leadership and prestige as if they are goals in and of themselves--and must in a Biden presidency be restored. That thinking no longer works. [Thread] 1/
There is a lot of talk about Biden bringing in some Rs for his cabinet to heal our nation. I can see Hogan being one of them.
Also, here’s an article about Biden’s stutter.
So I wonder who gave the word for ling term "optics"? Make it LOOK like we are confident of living here for 4 more years (or 28).  Certainly couldn't mean "It needs fixing so I'll get a jump on it for the Biden admin!" Hope she remembers to keep her clothes on, (pickers).
One of the things scary about candidate Biden. Not only the policies he's advocated over the years but likely to put around him folks that have been equally as wrong if not even more so.
He is literally telling us no medicare for all. So no Biden! Easy concepts
Hey birther lady, I hope you invite the Biden's to offer suggestions because they are the one's who will need to use the rose garden.
Sure. But Biden boxed himself in on purpose. Human nature for his underlings to wish he hadn't.
More like when he tries to cancel the election.   He can't refuse to leave office because it's the Secret Service's job to move him out and [Biden] in.   The government would have to coup itself for that to happen.
Poll on swing states: Biden likely to win more moderates in Wisconsin by showing the benefits and humanity of immigrants, appealing to American values. Trump might improve chances in Pennsylvania by hammering on "illegal" immigration as he has for years.
Misogyny will prevent us from ever having a woman president. The Real Reason Biden Is Ahead of Trump? He’s a Man
Virginia Beach, VA (1964)  And these might be a bit of a reach for Biden, but not out of the realm of possibility considering they’re suburban counties trending blue:  Delaware, OH (1916) Hamilton, IN (1912)
A nice view, for sure. Unfortunately, we are much more suburban and racing to protect our windows, so no relaxing yet. Still voting for Biden, of course, but just in case.
Vote for Joe Biden
So  wants #Trump to lose but refuses to endorse  I tried hard to get her to explain that.
NO ONE should vote for Lumm in the Democratic primary — she’s a Republican!  She never endorsed Obama, has not endorsed Biden, has not spoken out against Trump.  Lumm is a Republican!  Vote for Linh Song, an honest Democrat and a committed worker for social justice.  #A2Council
Who the hell is still thinking of voting for Trump?  I am happy that Biden is ahead, but if we had a country of sane people, this would be a much wider gap!!!!
Enthusiasm, or just rampant mental illness &amp; smirking greed? No one wants more posturing &amp; Putin-pandering from the ugly orange fraud in the White House. Build Back Better with Joe Biden! He cares about all people &amp; restoring confidence in America.
Can't wait to cast my ballot to vote you OUT!  President Biden &amp; the Dems will get to work pronto on cleaning up the Red Mess. You can continue golfing until it's time to go to prison.
That’s even better than saying Mr President, tear down that wall right after Joe Biden’s inauguration.
if i said Boe Jiden do u think the secret service would know i was talking abt joe biden
Anybody but Biden. Unless Obama is going to be McCain.
Actually several major polls found, on average,  80%+ of Trump supporters refused 2 wear masks (a few months ago). The other category was typically, Democrats. They were below 20% refusal. More recent polls show Biden supporters REFUSAL 2 wear masks at below 8%. Trump at 76%+
I think u don’t get the picture. Est. Repubs are working with anti-trump repubs. They know joe biden will show them mercy if the resistance liberals come to power. Then the classsic repub and dem establisments will be United again. That’s how else get fucked.
Biden isn’t against fracking. I wish he was, but he’s not. He’s also not anti-steel.
Markey’s transformation from anonymous backbencher to icon of the left is so bizarre to me. Markey voted for the crime bill, NAFTA, and the Iraq War — the same things they love to castigate Biden for.
I thought you were just saying Biden had gotten too tough on crime in the past??? Which way is it??
To paraphrase Reagan, Mr. Biden, tear down this wall!
It’s 2020 and Trump has set us back so far that Biden has to campaign on clean water.
I thought the interview was done ok but not good enough you could have pointed out more lies and inconsistencies without a lot of effort If I was Biden I would not agree to anyone that works for Repurt  Murdoch
Yeah, we’ll see how that goes. If it doesn’t go dramatically left I can’t vote for Biden
I would like to tell to President Biden as soon as he is finished swearing in, Mr. President, tear down that wall!
Chris Wallace says Biden campaign turned down request for interview
The best candidate they could come up with is Joe Biden...Joe Biden folks.
I Am Pretty Sure Someone Knows His Days Are Numbered! 🤣 #Biden #Biden2020 #FlushTheTurdNovember3rd #FlushTheTurdNovemberThird #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
1- true 2- the narrative people misunderstand is that he isn’t saying, “Riots= Biden’s America,” he’s saying, “these rioters will be in charge in Biden’s America.”
Also I’m not opposed to Kasich endorsing Biden it just shouldn’t happen at the convention.
The point is that the Democratic base's mind is made up. Therefore Biden doesn't stand to lose support from the base, yet could *potentially* stand to gain by having a Republican make the case against Trump, the Republican nominee.
Biden isn't the president yet. He's not supposed to be overseeing any protests.
Biden doesn't need to do ego rallies. He has millions supporting hom.
I’m sure Trump didn’t agree to Chris’ first request. Give it some time. Biden and Wallace will face off
Just 100 Days Until November 3rd! 🔵 #Biden #Biden2020 #FlushTheTurdNovember3rd #FlushTheTurdNovemberThird #VoteBlue #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
I’m an educated suburban working woman and think you’re spreading more scare tactics that are not in Biden’s plan. We see the destruction trump has caused this country &amp; don’t want more.  Trump’s promises have made gains for wealthy friends, not average Americans
Biden did. Look it up
Joe Biden isn't a traitor and a felon. He is also not a failed businessman several dozen times over. Stick your boats where the sun don't shine.
Leave no doubt.   Fellow students, join us - for our future:
Even when Biden wins it's going to take a long time to come back from this. I will breathe a sigh of relief though. I've been holding my breath for what seems like 4 years.
really wish every news site wouldnt post "BIDEN BEATING TRUMP IN 3 KEY STATES" poll data DAILY. Thats how u breed complacency come Nov 3rd
Obama/Biden accomplishments: 1.Created more jobs than Trump ever will 2. Had a better economy than Trump ever will. 3. Never lost 10 million jobs in one month, unlike Trump 4. Saved the economy while defeating H1N1, Trump tanked the economy while losing 150k+ Americans
We have a neighbor fight on the next street. Big Trump sign goes up in the one yard and the neighbor across the street put a “F*** Trump” sign in the window and a “Ridin with Biden” sign out front. It’s very controversial. But never boring!
Well, you're good. It's the rest of the people who are about to hear Biden has a 9999% chance of winning I worry about.
My Joe Biden campaign song, 42 recordings so far! Still need singers from Delaware, Hawaii, Indiana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Oklahoma, &amp; Wyoming. If you know someone from one of these states, please ask them to volunteer. A great statement with all 50 states. cdunitz
Cancel the models. This election is too important to bet it on America’s limited ability to grok statistics.
Yep.  I'm gonna make home-made Biden signs: - Won't make you drink bleach;  - can READ and SPELL; - only plays golf once/week. - doesn't kiss Putin's butt
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Similar situation in Ohio  44% coronavirus approve in OH 46% vote share in GE matchup vs Biden
Pretty amazing how correlated Trump's vote share in a lot of these polls are similar/the same to the amount that approve of his response to the coronavirus.  42% coronavirus approve in MI in this poll 42% vote share in GE matchup vs Biden
So nobody paid attention to the time stamps then? Biden wrote "enough" in May, so he's psychic? He was answering tweets that wouldn't be made til July? lol
Could things get any worse? I fear that between now and election day they can! We Need Biden more than ever. Dump the Trump in 2020!!!
Biden actually met with protesters, is not in his basement, but why do research if we can just borrow dishonest narratives, Spiegel style.
This is hilarious &amp; effective. Trump will dominate 60+ white America.   I maxed out   Trump isn't going to lose Taxes or Ohio. Michigan, our state, is running $.75 - $.25 in favor of Biden. Which is about the same as Verlander at home against the
Biden’s campaign is ‘suppressing the Hispanic vote’ in Florida, an internal letter claims
😂 I dont like Joe Biden but you are insane
8 years goes by w Biden. He leaves office. We get another republican. Then what? Just vote centrist again in 8 years? This is the cycle of no end
I don't think people realize the implications of anything pro-dictator in South Florida  I went to school and am neighbors with a lot of these folks  It'll be game over real quick if Biden picks Karen Bass as cool as she seems
normally i would so but nope, cubans and venezuelans are definitely attainable for biden but they take pride in their historical experiences
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
So do the democrats. But Trump is different. Why do you think the global corporations picked Biden and BLM?
I know the detail. I know the history and politics of the NDAA. It’s a looney overlapping program that we don’t need with a budget better spent elsewhere. Trump could have vetoed the bill. Biden needs to kill it. On Twitter I get to express my opinion.
Biden is an idiot. He is for killing babies, started the law that put many black Americans in prison until Trump stopped it. The violence is in Democratic states that refused help and now crying for help. Do your research.
#LincolnProject are RINOs that like their pipeline of cheap labor and their deals with China. So yeah, Biden all the way!
I agree the average American would pass a basic cognitive test. We both know Joe Biden would not.
You have lgbt and women's rights in your bio and you still look forward to Biden? And we wonder why most people can't tell a difference between a Democrat and a republican.
i’m glad Biden’s VP will be a woman, but i really hope the first woman to be a U.S. president is *elected* president
This Trump Ad Shows Fire and Looting With The Pitch "You Won't Be Safe In Biden's American" Shows ACTUAL Footage of Trump's America! 🤨 #Biden #Biden2020 #TrumpFailedAmerica #VoteBlue #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
Liberals always rely on conservatives to be their daddy figure and save them. Why do u think resistance liberals praise obama bush cuomo, and Biden
Climate PODCAST of the week:  Biden’s climate &amp; justice action plan gets stronger , Facebook fact checking still weak, big old-energy corruption in OH &amp; IL (bet there is more).
So many sad choices when you're tied to the trump train.
STOP IT. Please for the love of god do more research. Biden is not a last resort. No amount of hate for trump should warrant putting this scum into office. Third party isn’t a wasted vote. #JoJorgensen2020 CAN be elected if people stop believing it’s a wasted vote.
Cornyn: You have no idea what Biden will do and your lies won’t make it so!!
You think Biden is “who I wish?” I just don’t have my head buried in the sand pretending our system isn’t catered to 2 and only 2 parties. When you vote 3rd party it means YOU are OKAY with the chance that either of the major party candidates could win. Including Trump.
We've never had an election with a president who is willing to do anything he can to keep his office (and avoid indictment) and an Attorney General who has made it clear he's going to help him do it.  In the middle of a pandemic.
The worse Trump can make the next couple months, the more fodder for 'Biden's America' ads. That's a campaign strategy?
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
What Biden’s presidency means for the US-Iran Cold War
Harry Reid is another establisment back and tool. How could u endorse joe Biden even after another presidential candidate win your home state by a landslide.
That’s terrifying, and plausible. It’s nice to look at happy polls, but I’m worried about a repeat of 2016. I almost wish we did not know that Biden is ahead so our focus isn’t lost.
Don’t think Biden can debate.
The Obama/Biden administration turned our failing econony around, created millions of jobs and trump inherited that. Biden's strong accomplishments speak for themselves
Fascinating perspective from ⁦  The woman Biden should pick to lead us to calmer days
Biden would embarrass himself for sure. Would love to see it.
Maybe when Biden is President we can talk about Hanging Chad.
Joe Biden campaign song. Virtual singers still needed from Arkansas, Delaware, D.C., Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming. Contact me at cdunitz
Joe Biden should pledge to take Trump's lease from him.
If Biden wins he damn well should make sure no future president can use agencies to abuse Americans, asylum seekers, immigrants in the same way again, even if it means losing some control of his own.  If we get out of this, we need to make sure it damn well doesn't happen again.
It just makes me sadder than ever this is occurring under trump. I wish it were January and Biden was in office
She's actually showing how awful things are under trump's rule. I cant wait til January when we have President Biden.
lefties wanting to wait before more evidence comes out about Shahid Buttar after doing the exact opposite when it concerned Tara Reade and Joe Biden 👁️👄👁️
So does that mean Biden could also name you the next Secretary of Education?!?!? Asking for a friend, friend = US educators everywhere!!!!
Biden now has the immunity in 2020 that trump had in 2016. Trump has also turned into Hillary politically while joe biden benefits from the Trump immunity.
2016=&gt; Trump =2020 Joe Biden 2020=&gt; Trump =2016 hillary   2016 Trump= no political baggage but personal baggage. People Dnc personally  2020 Trump politics and personal baggage 2020 joe political baggage but ppl dnc about the personal baggage
The people who supported Dubya are not my political allies. They make a decent YouTube ad, but three minutes after Biden wins they will start making ads against him using the same techniques.
Yeah, but you’re going to vote for all the other Republicans on the down ballot that have enabled a president like him and would obstruct no partisan change with Biden, so I guess good for you.
...we can only hope! I would love to see it! 51% of our voters automatically voted for Biden, because Biden, sees women as equals.
Maybe she wanted to handle her own business.
That led to this.....
What is your problem with AOC? This is like telling people how and when to protest. She is a grown up and can make her own decisions. Ease up on the AOC hate
Some interesting screens on here  1) Biden does solid in rural Iowa 2) Unsurprisingly a lot of DE donations 3) Scranton area seems good for Biden 4) NV donors love Trumplying about what a Biden Presidency would be like with law enforcement behind him! It’s another signal to police to attack peaceful protesters and “not be so nice” to them. He’s a domestic terrorist. He wants everyone attacking each other. He’s the devil!
Joe Biden asked to comment:  "2020 could have been A LOT worse."
Same as Joe Biden's.
Too bad . Biden will still be president.
I wonder if Biden has selected his VP and is just waiting to next week to announce his choice , or if he's still undecided? He needs to pick who HE wants and not let anyone pressure him.
Former Vice President Joe Biden has won the general election endorsement of the Michigan People's Campaign, a progressive group that backed Bernie Sanders in the primary:
Trump’s absence in the summer comes as a series of polls show Biden leading in Michigan. Trump's organizers in told me this doesn't mean they are pulling out. In fact, they're making big investments in the ground operation.
I’m a mom, and I’m for Biden. Go away
Trump’s absence in the summer comes as a series of polls show Biden leading in Michigan. The Trump campaign reportedly canceled its national ad program in order to review its messaging strategy.  However, Trump reserved $11.4M in TV ads from September through Nov. 3.
Presidential campaigns and PACs supporting them spent $52M to reserve television ads in Michigan, according to data shared by    Trump and Biden already spent more on TV ads in Michigan than the candidates in 2016.
. says  will make significant investments to make affordable housing more available for Black Americans. Gilchrist said Biden's plan will benefit people in Detroit, Benton Harbor and "people of color across the state of Michigan."
You can make fun of mentally challenged people all you want but a lot of people are voting for Biden only because trump is such a huge threat to democracy.
Maybe your husband has contracted to same Virus attitude that I have?  I'd rather die of COVID-19 than watch the Biden-Obama Cult and their "Squad-infested" #NewLeft take control of our National Security, including Internal Security.  Sad but true 4 me; had enough B💩
The more closely Biden’s record is examined, the more ‘problematic’ it becomes for the Dem machine 🧐🐲🧐
The more closely Biden’s record is examined, the more ‘problematic’ it becomes for the Dem machine 🧐🐲🧐
You perfectly described trump there. Whereas Biden’s donors tell him what to believe not people on the left. Biden is going to be another standard corporate democrat just like Obama and Hillary.
Well 1. Biden isn’t a boomer. He’s older.  And 2. I edit. Say anything political. I have an example of someone near Biden’s age that also figured it out.
Trump figured it out and he’s not as smart as Biden. I’m sure he will be fine.
All jokes aside, this is one of the things about a Joe Biden presidency that I am actually excited about
I love that all these Republication PAC commercials are really just projection.  They're like "Hey, Joe Biden lied once, 30 years ago. He _exaggerated_. Clearly not presidential material."  Meanwhile  on twitter yelling about mescaline and healing crystals.
Yall keep talking about Biden in the basement like we forgot #BunkerBabyTrump hid then lied about it.
It’s cute you think Biden is a leftist. I pegged him more as a moderate Republican myself. Especially how he agrees with a majority of Trump’s policies.
My goal is to remove Trump's 1000 judges via constitutional amendment. And of course many other elements as you are aware.   will still continue under Biden. My worry is that momentum will slow. Not that there's any now. More people are becoming ready, though.
In the first six months of the Biden Administration.
Kamala/Biden is a Republican ticket. That is two Republicans on a ticket.  Seeing what Dems have done since 2008 has made me realize that America has two factions of a fundamentally conservative party.  GOP are right-wing reactionary. Dems are centrist/conservative.
96 days. Fight like Biden is behind. Crush Trump. Humiliate Trump. #EvictTrump
Yes, but  is in the top ten for worst Governors. Trump signs in Michigan outnumber Biden 8-1 state wide. She a 1 term Governor, voted in only because legalization of Marijuana was on the ballot, so she was voted in by pot heads!  We know they won't vote the next round.
We are starting to see who will be advising  due to his current status. Obama will be in the background trying to reinstall all his job killing policies. If Biden wins, I'm going to laugh at all of you who voted for him as you lose your jobs. Trump 2020!
Not sure if this is a subtweet of the other thread going on, but regardless, who is claiming that Biden's plan does not include the substantive influence of GND?  I think we can celebrate the clear influence of GND without saying that Biden's plan = GND in its totality
If we're looking not at the GND resolution, but the broader discourse and academic work that has developed around the GND, one could identify other missing links from Biden's plan too. I limited my list here to the reso
If you're voting for Joe Biden because you do not like President Donald J. Trump, then that is like eating a dog turd because you do not like broccoli!   is nothing more than a puppet hiding in his basement doing a few cameos every now and then. He is a left wing puppet!

This raises the question -- can we describe generic green stimulus with EJ principles as "the start of a Green New Deal?" I see pros and cons to this approach.  But where we def agree is that the GND shouldn't be defined down to something equivalent to the Biden plan.
Why are you so desperate to excuse T’s rhetoric, and why do you think “Biden supporters” are the issue?
The fact that I just saw a woman say she hopes Biden doesn’t pick Warren for VP because she’s “too shrill” absolutely blows my mind. Have you MET her? The internalized misogyny is strong here, friends....
Gov. Whitmer is not on this list of 10 women.
This is about where I think it is. I don't think Biden has leads upwards of 8-10 points like some polls.
Please join Spartans for Biden on August 8th as we host  and  for a discussion of the 2020 election! We look forward to seeing you there!

Gosh? Obama? Hilary? Biden? Comey?
Man...if Joe Biden have a black woman running mate he def getting my vote lol
He can resign right after Obama, Biden, the Clinton’s and all the other pedophiles are in jail or executed
Tucker is simply magnificent.
While I don’t disagree, this makes me nostalgic for the Biden/Palin debate of 2008.
If it takes years to pull them out, Biden can reverse this dumbass decision as soon as he takes office.
Hmmmmm I must have missed when Biden became president...... during the riots and crime, who is the president? Who is sending these mercenaries into the cities uninvited?? Oh!! Daddy trump!!
I think Biden has a BLIND Twin Brother.  I think that I saw him on Columbo. 🙄

I'm sorry what? He had these notes scribbled down? He couldn't have remembered that he had "great respect" for Senator Harris?
Our government is a plutocracy  The cold reality is the Blue Team is not much different than the Red Team when you peal back the veneer  A Biden administration will do little to help the working class, look at Virginia for the blueprint of how the Democrats will run the country
Or for Biden to have some small gaffe that supposed "independents" or "undecideds" will use as cover to vote for Trump.  Anyone that claims to be undecided at this point actually supports Trump and just doesn't want to admit it.
“The clearest reason why the president is reeling in Michigan is because of his failed coronavirus response,” said Garlin Gilchrist, the state’s Democratic lieutenant governor.
Trump has pulled advertising out of Michigan as it trends Dem
Same. And earlier today when Biden said he believes in science, a sliver of hope. How comforting would it have been if we only had a leader who believed in it.

Doesn't Rub my Legs Biden know that Key West NAS was warned that they'd be Gone, Flooded Over more than 10 years ago?  Now it 70 years from now?  Give back the $Million Al. 🙄
Everyone stop calling them "centrist" Dems.  They are *conservative* Dems. Trump has made them move to the right.  #ConservativeDems are going to make Biden lose in November.
Joe Biden might have won by supporting M4A. It would have solidified the Bernie base without losing a single conservative Dem.  Joe Biden may well lose because he rejected M4A. It's a terrible look for conservative Dems to compromise with the GOP voter base rather than Berners!
You know as well as everyone else knows. Biden is worthless. A lifetime in congress and accomplished zip. So vote for Biden but when Trump is re-elected stay the hell out of the way if all your gonna do is cry, or find some common ground and accomplish something.
The Biden campaign's strategy seems to be "Let Trump talk." And why not? Biden's up in the polls assuming you believe them after 2016.
Well you see, the Mueller report is gospel to them. Doesn’t matter what these declassified documents tell us. If Obama and Biden say something is so, then who are we to question it?
Vice President  understands that millions of Americans rely on Planned Parenthood for reproductive health care. He stands with Planned Parenthood patients and will fight to ensure you can access the care you need a deserve.

None really that close. They're more Biden and BLM in the hood but yeah..
I've seen it.  The Biden campaign needs to find it and use it in an ad.
I like how you did this: Show Biden’s polling. We already know Trump has set fire to his re-election campaign with his race baiting and failure to fight against the coronavirus. #JoeBidenForPresident2020

Perhaps the more important question is "would you reconsider your vote for Biden if the candidate picked a VP of X ideology?"
Joe Biden knows he's screwed at any Debate with Trump. He's also hiding in hopes people won't get to see him.

My father brought up who Biden should select as his running mate, and I found myself saying that I don’t know who the VP pick should be because I don’t understand people who might not avail themselves of the chance to vote out T-rump any better than I do those who’d vote for him.
Biden and Dems Are Set to Abolish the Suburbs
Sounds like Tucker supports Biden.
I read many on the Left loving how Wallace kept hammering away at the President last week with valid questions. As well he should. But where is the former Veep? Time to become available and hit the hot seat with Wallace. Who’s very fair. But unrelenting.
Lets make it easy on them with an overwhelming victory for Biden.
Is anyone else thinking that the DNC is going to have Biden....... Get the Killary treatment?
You already know they going to blame him when Biden loses to Trump
It will probably be your wife on the ballot. Since even you can see Biden is losing it. He will have a medical condition and drop out of the race. The Dems will pick who ever they want to run.
Started out with a  BIDEN sign in my yard . Will be passing the word on twitter...if I can get even one undecided person to vote Biden then it's worth it.   Donating all I can. And then voting to fire trump and his cronies.
This is interesting.   Significantly more people said they are voting for President Trump because they like him compared to the number of Biden-backers who said they will vote for him because they don’t like Trump.
100 days left. Fight every one of them like Biden is running behind. Grind Trumpism into dust.
Talking about Biden?
Observing the text messaging strategies between the Biden and Trump campaigns seems to say a lot about the differences in their target audiences and what they value
Nice to see joe Biden adopting the positions Bernie has held for a long time. We need Medicare for all.
Redistribution of wealth, now Biden wants redistribution of suburban property! #Trump2020 #BlackVoicesforTrump #LeadRight #staywoke #StopTheMadness
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
The people that vote for Kanye were never gonna vote for Biden to begin with. They’re the same people who wrote in Harambe 4 years ago.   If Biden loses blame the Democratic Party, not Kanye.
Aren't these the Replacement Statues that the Clinton👉Obama👉Biden Cults are destroying daily
You’ll “beat off” Biden 🤔
I did see a tweet from Joe Biden where he supported $15 hour minimum wage
My money has gone to   and local progressive races. Biden can have my vote but he won’t get my money. The DNC is hoping hate for Trump will be greater than MAGA supporters love of Trump, and that’s a risky gamble.
Let’s just eliminate the National Anthem if it’s so offensive..... these anti-Americans will have to find something else to kneel to.... like Joe Biden....
Thank you for listening to Bernie, Joe Biden comms team.
Biden will likely thank everyone for coming to his first day back in the Senate. 😂
I think Obama &amp; Biden are setting up a Prison Gang for themselves, Eric! 😁 Barry said he's going 2 Reassemble the Conspirators who criminally attempted to Overthrow the President of the United States?  I'M the One who's a little slow? 😏
Reply to all surveys, donate to Biden, speak the truth to others.
Because she would be elected AFTER  Biden's term is up , right ?  Hopefully , the other possibility isn't strong.
The economy will boom if Biden is elected, he has already help lead the country out of a Republican recession of immense impact. American will know that their work is real and so is their pay. Not like the phony setup the R’s are selling. Illusionist.
Sorry but here in Michigan I think I have seen two Biden signs if that...Trump signs are everywhere!
This guy is going to WONDER why Biden is going to lose.  How about you stop yapping and just admit Biden isn't well-liked but you're going to vote for him anyway?  And you have to *hope* that Trump's people don't pull more voter suppression.  Too bad u didn't care in the primary!
*Those* are *not* the facts.  Voter suppression via closed polling places is a fact.  Hillary getting a debate Q from Donna - and also billions in free air time - is a fact.  Media manipulating for Biden after SC and 2 candidates dropping out in 24 hours -  is a fact.
Bernie was always going to be the perfect candidate. In 2016, and again today.  In a moment of Black Lives Matter - Joe Biden is a guy who eulogized a segregationist.  When M4A is more needed than ever - Biden threatened to veto if he got it.  Biden is a conservative.
Judging from their twitter, voting for biden...
If I had to describe how this strain got me feeling with a politican, I'd say Joe Biden. Cause I don't remember a goddamn thing and smell toast.   No wait, Toaster Studdell  Me when I realized I have a whole box:   (This song)
Treason ‼️ Comey, Clapper, Brennan, Strzok and Page (and others...) all with Obama and Biden’s direction and support 🐲🐲🐲
As long as people don’t forget that just about every poll out there said Clinton would win in 2016. Until she didn’t. Polls are basically half-assed guesses at best. Campaign and vote like the polls say Biden is down 20.
"I'd like to show you a video of Trump's America to show you why you don't want.... uhhh... errrr.. Biden's America?".  😂😂😂
Democrats are so dumb, that's why they keep voting Democrat. The all watch CNN who reported and earthquake in Brazil, They rreported 1 Brazilian died and all the Democrrats thought that was a lot of people. Just like Joe Biden, by his numbers we all died from Covid-19. Trump 2020

No shit?  The Trump campaign is a cesspool of mismanagement, nepotism, grift, and idiocy
Mr. Good deserves to Joe Biden in the White House.
I can’t wait to vote for joe Biden. Pass it on.

Biden Calls For End To Waiting Lists For Medicaid Waivers - Disability Scoop
I had thought any reversal of a lead like Biden's, at this stage, would be unprecedented.  I was wrong.  Look at Dukakis.
"Mocking and Making Fun of Joe Biden" or "Warning the Nation of Catastrophe" if Biden is elected L &amp; G's?
If you're voting for Joe Biden because you don't like President Trump, then that's like eating a dog turd because you don't like broccoli.

Speaking just for me. I don’t want to be a Democrat. I will vote for Biden and other Ds this year. Accept the alliance. Your can have your party.
Medicines Sir, contrary to Obama World where we keep our OWN Dr's and Medications in our Dreams?  Biden World will keep Mfg of our Medicines Offshore, won't it Mr President?  Will we have a Funeral for Thanksgiving, Christmas and Hanukkah like we needed in 2019?
cut malarkey into pieces  joe biden last resort  legislation  no pee tapes  dont give a fuck, got our supreme court seatings
“Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has "caved in to the ‘defund the police’ movement."  #LeadRight #TVMI20
Biden's clearly ahead with under 45 and 65+ in Michigan. That's a good combo.
Here's the full story and the piece that aired last night.  3/3
As the veepstakes' list shortens -- with Sen. Duckworth rumored to be on it -- she says she is Team Biden all the way and will do whatever she can to help him win in November.   WATCH ⤵️
[ THREAD ]  Yesterday I spoke with  after a virtual event for Team Biden.   We spoke about a few topics, including criminal justice reform.   “I certainly would never personally use the slogan ‘defund the police’," she told me.   MORE ⤵️
Really hope we stand up and not let Biden be president. If not America is over
Very funny. Maybe you can work on getting Biden out of his basement for a fire drill.
Biden is gaining with young white voters. If he held his current position with white voters (near parity), Democrats could diminish Republican geographic advantages in the Electoral College, Senate, &amp; HouseChef Blaser....if you need to blame Trump for this so you can sleep better at night, then that's your issue.  But to blame one person for every Covid death in the country is nothing short of foolish.  Biden or anyone else wouldn't have done any better either.
I guess it’s time for the polls to flip Trumps turn to fundraise then the polls will flip back and Biden can make $$$
Quel Surprise.  Trump distorts????  AP FACT CHECK: Trump distorts Biden's position on fracking
No corruption to report about Biden.
let’s just get it straight, i’m mexican, i will always respect the flag, if you kneel during the national anthem you’re disrespectful. black lives matter and so does everyone’s lives but the blm “movement” has become a joke. biden is retarded asf, last of all. kanye 2020
Hey. Don't be supporting dopey Joe Biden. You seem not to realize that the majority of your followers are Trump supporters.
Are you serious? I know #covid19 is contagious but I guess so is the Trump family stupidity. 100% of parents want there kids in school just not at all costs. 2nd so Joe Biden's opinion should not influence parents but your opinion should? That's spectacular ignorance &amp; hypocrisy.
It doesn't matter constitutionally. His current term ends on January 20th. In contesting the election, he risks that a timely decision will not be made. That puts him out on Jan.20. Not Biden or Trump, it will be #PresidentPelosi
I talked to a customer today, and they were hardcore Biden fans. They were talking trash about the wall being built. I told them that the wall protects a lot of children being human trafficked. They told me so what?! That’s not the worst problem our country faced.. it’s trump 😂
And  I am hoping Biden &amp; Harris will be in :-) ♥
I think you need to #1 take a look around, YOU ARE NOT DOING YOUR JOB. You can't assess anyone else, you cannot even do YOUR JOB! You cannot even manage a crisis SO BIDEN has to do it for you!
You bet, "make American great again" because it was great until you got in the White House, now we have a mess and Biden WILL make it GREAT ♥
As the Biden Campaign launches “Moms For Biden” tonight it’s important to remember his radical agenda:  ➡️ Higher taxes ➡️ Defunding the police ➡️ Government takeover of healthcare  ➡️ Job-killing Green New Deal  Biden’s destructive policies are completely out of touch with moms!

Stacey Abrams touts Biden plan to support minority-owned businesses with Michigan entrepreneurs
Yeah. How out of touch is Biden now GOP? Biden was right!!!
No need to worry sweetie, it won't be a close election. 3% means nothing when Biden is getting 90% of the votes.
He’s shook. That’s why he’s talking about mail in voting. They know that’s Biden’s only chance of winning.
That’s some funny shit... vote for Biden. Dying! 😂😂😂😂😂
Biden, without a doubt.
hey Biden, operation warp speed, sounds like a plan. This contradicts your assertion that there is no plan to distribute the vaccine when it is available. ( 7/29/20 speech )
Funny how the truth can be revealed inadvertently.
Same, and team Biden is for some reason texting me asking why I won’t vote Joe. I have no problem having a grown up discussion about policy or lack there of but don’t voter shame us and tell us to fall in line, that will not work.
#LincolnProject  I agree w John that  ads arent buying influence w Biden. In part because ideologically the minds behind the group &amp; Biden arent vastly different. Second they have a real stake in this... 1/
BIDEN WILL BE HAPPY THERE
Biden is Discusting!👿
BIDEN AND CHINA ARE BUTT BUDDIES
Yeah he’s an idiot, we know. However pushing Biden on your viewers really doesn’t seem right and shaming for deciding to not to vote Biden is also down right wrong in addition to being highly non productive.
The only way Biden and the Communist Democrats are going to win is if they cheat YUGELY!  This has to be prevented!
Biden will have donkeys pulling cars by next year if he is elect our good union friends will help him get elected and will put the auto companies out of work
Except Biden when he writes it on his little notepad. 😆
Trump is the one using DHS as his own personal police force INSIDE THE COUNTRY on American Citizens, jackass.  Also, yes, Biden did write the crime bill. He regrets it.  Though what party is supported by the KKK, Nazis, and White Supremacists in this country? OH RIGHT. GOP.
Yeah! I like how he's telling everyone to wear masks in the video below, but do you see him or any of staff wearing masks? 🤔
Weekend at Biden’s
What's going on in Democratic cities and states is what America can expect in a Biden run America. Because this madness will spread if you Dems win in America. Then in that scenario it would be Biden's America ,only America will be lost if Biden wins.That's why we must vote Trump
He's also working with Bernie to move his platform left. And people can change. I'm not the person I was back in 1996. Or the person I was 10 years ago.  Biden wasn't my first pick, but four more years of Trump and we won't have a country. I'd like to be alive in four years.
Biden commented after Trump used tear gas that using federal police was only going to cause more fear and division and that wasn't the way to go. I think he's going to have people who will not allow the use of federal cops as Gestapo. And I don't think Biden would.
Biden's out and about. He spent a lot of time talking to area leaders during the protests, and LISTENING to them. He's giving speeches in different areas. He was just at the Capital, paying his respects to John Lewis. Pay attention.
Yeah, of course the GOP and Trump increased our debt/spending. I assume you are voting for Biden. Correct me if I am wrong, but Biden would only increase the debt even more.
As all offenses &amp; scandal in the 45 era unpunished &amp; normalized. If Biden wins all the oversight &amp; investigations that weren't conducted will either go w/o consquence by the next admin up tradition. Or the  will piss &amp; moan about time &amp; taxpayers $ being wasted on the past.
I  don’t think it was a accident I think they put it out to feel people out I bet they Biden campaign asked them to there’s no way they would burn a “exclusive “ with a mistake it goes through to many people to be a mistake
Bush, Biden they’re all cut from the same cloth
This was all about Biden. They are doing the talking for him because of his mental state. Falls into the delusional do nothing Democrats agenda!
It’s not false. Why is everyone in the media scared to admit this works? Are you all in with the democrats to help get Biden elected!!! Nvm. We all know that answer!
Biden has been in DC since he was 29. And he's going to be an "agent of change". #ClownWorld #WalkAway #MAGA2020
VP for 8 year left the country in a mess then Trump cleaned up their mess SUV driving America,  now  Biden wants to come back and rebuild the middle class...ROFLMAO what back to the left with 3 flat tired YUGO
Hiding Biden going to rebuild the middle class....ROFLMAO
I'm buying Joe Biden at 1¢
you are super drinking the kool-aid, I'm not trump fan, but if you think Biden is your savior... oh shit man.  I feel really sorry for you.
Biden appears to have notes and a list of reporters who are asking the questions. Could they be canned, I wonder.
Keep fantasizing in your tiny bubble. Get an appointment with a psychiatrist for November 4th. Sounds like you’ll need it after Trump destroys Bumbling Biden in the election
Sorry I don’t play republican ping pong, I asked a simple question and you won’t answer it because you can’t refute it. But I will say this, in 40yrs of Joe Biden’s career he hasn’t caused the kind of Damage that trump has pulled off in 4 short yrs.
Trump loves to brag about how many more followers he has than joe Biden. Without realizing that people only follow him to see what insane things he may say next. It is easy to track though without following as she said.
#unfollowdonaldtrump he loves having more followers than  Unfollow trump and start to follow Biden!! #TrumpleThinSkin #TrumpIsACrybaby #Biden2020 #TrumpVirus
I like him in general. I believe Obama to have been one of the best presidents. He chose Biden to run the country, why wouldn't we?
I'm terrified of what he'll do before the swearing in of Biden NEXT YEAR!!!!
Biden's campaign bans TikTok from employees mobile devices #tiktok
I’m voting for Biden and whoever his running mate is. (My personal choice is Tammy Duckworth)
I received a message from Eric TRUMP, he says BIDEN is being finance with DARK MONEY.
you're right... but Biden is who the democrats chose... so you're stuck with him.
I like Rashida, but her not endorsing Biden is bullshit. She needs to stop playing games.
Justice is coming on Jan 29, 2020. They will arrest you right after Joe Biden is sworn in. For crimes and treason against the citizens of the Imited Stars of America. Don’t feel lonely, your whole team will be arrested too.
Women who are housewives are very lucky. During the Obama Biden era, I was too broke to be home with my babies. A luxury I would have treasured. Under President Trump, I was able to be home with my 1st grandbaby tho. Thank God for that.❤️
....  what ...  I mean last night I read some smug, self-entitled shit from Bernie supporters saying Biden didn't deserve their vote because he hadn't earned it; and they wouldn't bother to give it to them; but this?  This fucking is bonkers.
While I admire Val Demings, I don't think she has the experience to be President should something happen to Biden.
Trump has exposed the #CCP and #ChinaJoe brings home the bacon to the tune of $1.5B. Obama/Biden was 8 years of China gaining at the expense of AMERICA.
Biden flat out said he would veto Medicare for All.
Fox News Poll Pennsylvania Biden 50%  Trump 38% People hate your guts and are just sick of the non-stop bullshit.
Should we que up some Biden videos then? I’ll wait
He just used footage from things occurring during Trump’s presidency to show what Joe Biden’s would look like, lol. This is the world right now, and right now Trump is prez, so if those images scare you......
Fox News Polls State   Biden    Trump Pa         50%      39% Minn     51%       38% Mich     49%      40% Qiunipiac poll Florida  51%       38% He doesn’t have a prayer lady.
You mean safe for cheating Democrats. That's why you all want to vote by mail. You all are afraid to lose by voting in person.Your dementia Joe Biden is a loser. And what happened to diversity. You all wound up with a old white guy anyway. Vote Trump,Same America, Stop Socialism
Yea, your a regular William F Buckley alright. You’re just a trump supporter with a bunch of nonsense talking points on the Rolodex in your head. By the way GOP internal polling has Biden winning Texas. You 38%’s are in for a world of reality come Nov.
You either want to live in America or in Venezuela. Choose Biden and you end up with Venezuela in America. Vote Trump 2020 and America will remain America. Otherwise wake up to a world where every aspect of your life is directed by your government.
I agree with what you stand for. But not your perjorative directed at the President. You certainly don't want dopey Biden in &amp; socialism garbage. Worship Lilith the Queen of Demons and you will feel empowered. That is all. Have a nice day.
is the radical far Right and, for the sake of what we have left of a democracy, must not be reelected. Vote Biden/Blue on November 3rd
Biden will be a honest, compassionate President for ALL of America!!! Your self serving , GRIFTING, CORRUPT father that cares about himself.   He could care less about the public.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
That's promising but not exactly true.  If Biden wins, Trump's version of America will simply slither into the shadows.
Let me get this straight we will be Nazis if Biden becomes President, I think she might be wrong on that score she is the one that is the Nazi and Trump is our President and has over 145,000 people who have died during this pandemic failed to act.
People do and still support trump, even though it's against their best interests. Unless we all vote for Biden he will win. This is the choice we have as citizens of the USA. Its Trump or Biden.
I keep telling everyone trump will win this election if everyone doesn't vote for Biden. We have to vote for the only candidate available to beat him.
Any vote that is not for Biden is a waste!
I can agree with all of that completely. Joe Biden is just so bad to me as well, I’m gonna have a hard time filling out that ballot.
Two reasons cited by the largest police union in MI for backing Trump: Biden wants to defund police. Not true. The President lets them buy surplus Military equipment. That’s just fucking great!!! What about our Country?
No Nancy you and chuck take the award of biggest failure along with Obama and Biden. Resign now
Biden's First-Day-In-Office Plan Is A Betrayal Of Working-Class Americans
Who is the president? Biden or Trump?
You have this Conservatives support. I'm  on your side 24/7. You are busy fighting the cultural wars and radical feminism on YouTube. And for that I applaud you. Glad that you think that Biden is a jerk. He's senile and should've been retired.

Yep. But then Biden has said a lot of things that the MSM doesn't report or "remember" (just like Biden)... 🤣
Florida JUL 16-20, 2020 Quinnipiac University 924RV Biden 51% Trump 38% Trump will not flip One State and all Joe needs is Florida and Michigan to get 277 electoral votes. This election will be a Humiliating disaster for the Republicans.
Yep, taking my chances survivin’ and ridin’ with Biden here in the burbs of the Mitten.
Am I the only one that gets super uncomfortable watching Biden talk? I have to turn away.  It’s sad.
It would be nice if there was a little less Trump and a bit more Biden so we could learn about Bidens Economic Plan.
lft Biden boys only
Kamala Harris has already proven to be a hypocrite when it comes to Joe Biden’s past racism and her own support of the horrendous criminal justice system in the U.S.. This hypocrisy when it comes to sexism should come at no surprise.
So Trump protecting federal property is the same thing as Biden enforcing a mask mandate? You sound very Jennifer Rubin-esque so far today.
Yes Biden has Alzheimer’sI guess it’s time for the polls to flip Trumps turn to fundraise then the polls will flip back and Biden can make $$$
No corruption to report about Biden.

That's funny. You're a real hoot. However, I believe Joe Biden was vice president when Barack Obama pulled us out of the great recession.
Hey. Don't be supporting dopey Joe Biden. You seem not to realize that the majority of your followers are Trump supporters.
It doesn't matter constitutionally. His current term ends on January 20th. In contesting the election, he risks that a timely decision will not be made. That puts him out on Jan.20. Not Biden or Trump, it will be #PresidentPelosi
Yeah I can’t imagine him showing up for Biden’s inauguration. He’ll have some excuse. I just want his margin of defeat to be so large that he can’t lie to himself about it. He’ll lie to everyone else for sure. But I just want him to have to admit to himself that he lost.
I talked to a customer today, and they were hardcore Biden fans. They were talking trash about the wall being built. I told them that the wall protects a lot of children being human trafficked. They told me so what?! That’s not the worst problem our country faced.. it’s trump 😂

so are you gonna cheerlead and knock doors and advocate publicly for biden?
No need to worry sweetie, it won't be a close election. 3% means nothing when Biden is getting 90% of the votes.
He’s shook. That’s why he’s talking about mail in voting. They know that’s Biden’s only chance of winning.
You wanna vote for Biden cause he’s not Trump? Fine.  But I never thought I’d see Palestinians and Arabs cheerlead for a guy who openly and proudly says “I am a Zionist.”  It’s shameful. #Palestine #FreePalestine
That’s some funny shit... vote for Biden. Dying! 😂😂😂😂😂
Trump offers many statements that are phony but current economic disruptions are not the result of one person. This derailment included the near entirety of both parties wounding the economy and abandoning the public. #US #CARES #Democrats #Republicans

Had this occurred under Obama/Biden it would have been handled swiftly and correctly.....it NEVER would have been called a hoax
I live in Michigan and I'm voting for Biden.

I think people are more worried about Trump getting another 4 years then the fact that Biden is moderate or subpar
If you think joe Biden is left wing you’re smoking crack

Wouldn’t it be something if Hillary Scholten succeeded Justin Amash in #MI03, and Biden appointed Amash as US Attorney for Michigan’s Western District?

I like Rashida, but her not endorsing Biden is bullshit. She needs to stop playing games.
But I would have been dismissive of him. He lost. Same if Biden today does it. I’d hate it, but move on. I personally find it highly suspect of a president even entertains the idea of denying election results.
The race was so close last time, any small breeze could push it one way or the other. Knowing Tlaib and her district, she's making a big mistake not going for the Biden wave.
Women who are housewives are very lucky. During the Obama Biden era, I was too broke to be home with my babies. A luxury I would have treasured. Under President Trump, I was able to be home with my 1st grandbaby tho. Thank God for that.❤️
What makes you think that Biden wouldn’t concede? Hillary is one person. You might be right, but I wouldn’t use the actions of one person to decide how another might act.
If Trump refuses to accept the results of the election and tries to stay in office, he’d be acting like a dictator. Be very afraid of anyone who does not respect election results. (And yes, I know that goes both ways. If Trump is voted in, I’ll respect that, and I’d hope Biden
Biden LOVES women too. If you know what I mean 😉. He isn’t so innocent himeself.
Because Biden LOVES women. If you know what I mean 😉
....  what ...  I mean last night I read some smug, self-entitled shit from Bernie supporters saying Biden didn't deserve their vote because he hadn't earned it; and they wouldn't bother to give it to them; but this?  This fucking is bonkers.
Oh, c'mon. A monkey would be better than what we have now. I think we will be just fine with Mr. Biden. So do not worry about us. Just start packing your shit to get out of town on January 21, 2121.
Trump has exposed the #CCP and #ChinaJoe brings home the bacon to the tune of $1.5B. Obama/Biden was 8 years of China gaining at the expense of AMERICA.
Should we que up some Biden videos then? I’ll wait
He just used footage from things occurring during Trump’s presidency to show what Joe Biden’s would look like, lol. This is the world right now, and right now Trump is prez, so if those images scare you......
You mean safe for cheating Democrats. That's why you all want to vote by mail. You all are afraid to lose by voting in person.Your dementia Joe Biden is a loser. And what happened to diversity. You all wound up with a old white guy anyway. Vote Trump,Same America, Stop Socialism
You either want to live in America or in Venezuela. Choose Biden and you end up with Venezuela in America. Vote Trump 2020 and America will remain America. Otherwise wake up to a world where every aspect of your life is directed by your government.
I agree with what you stand for. But not your perjorative directed at the President. You certainly don't want dopey Biden in &amp; socialism garbage. Worship Lilith the Queen of Demons and you will feel empowered. That is all. Have a nice day.
Biden and Antifa , Democratic ticket for 2020
Biden will be a honest, compassionate President for ALL of America!!! Your self serving , GRIFTING, CORRUPT father that cares about himself.   He could care less about the public.
You fixation on Obama/Biden is almost endearing. But it really is a sign of demential.
People do and still support trump, even though it's against their best interests. Unless we all vote for Biden he will win. This is the choice we have as citizens of the USA. Its Trump or Biden.
I keep telling everyone trump will win this election if everyone doesn't vote for Biden. We have to vote for the only candidate available to beat him.
I can agree with all of that completely. Joe Biden is just so bad to me as well, I’m gonna have a hard time filling out that ballot.
Well, actually, better the teacher's union than a rich girl who never saw a public school she wanted to succeed. Another reason to Vote Biden November 3rd.
In case you did not notice I could care less about Trump or Biden , they are nearly the same, I care about justice and law and neither side appears very interested in it.
No Nancy you and chuck take the award of biggest failure along with Obama and Biden. Resign now
Whatever you do in the privacy of a voting booth is your business.   But you can’t publicly advocate for #Palestine and Joe Biden at the same time.
someone tell Biden to keep his mouth shut on new ideas to speak about and let him just coast to the presidency. Please don’t get Hillary’s foot in mouth disease we can’t afford it
Looking forward to your retirement. If Chris Wallace interviews Biden, the former vice president may give you gaffes for sound bites. What he will not do is lie. That's good enough for me.
Who is the president? Biden or Trump?
You have this Conservatives support. I'm  on your side 24/7. You are busy fighting the cultural wars and radical feminism on YouTube. And for that I applaud you. Glad that you think that Biden is a jerk. He's senile and should've been retired.
Trump blasts Obama over ad featuring sit-down with Biden
Biden son took 1.5 billion from China but earlier black mailed the Ukraine into firing of an investigator  in exchange for with  holding aid to the Ukraine then later bragged about the firing on documented video

I will never be on Biden’s side. EVER
Biden wouldn’t because he is dumb.
Am I the only one that gets super uncomfortable watching Biden talk? I have to turn away.  It’s sad.
It would be nice if there was a little less Trump and a bit more Biden so we could learn about Bidens Economic Plan.
lft Biden boys only
It’s literally Trumps America today, how do people tolerate just blaming it on Biden. Trump could stop this all rn.
Whatever it takes to wake up with a President Joe Biden, Teddy. Whatever it takes.  Thankfully, you've tied yourself to tRumpster and will never see the inside of the WH  except as a guest.
Yes Biden has Alzheimer’sIf there is no election,  then the presidency will be open and the Speaker of the House becomes the president. There is no requirement the speaker be a member of the House. The dems could chose Biden.
Frump is a sorry excuse for a Commander in Chief! We need Joe Biden to lead our Country back to prosperity. 🇺🇲👍🏾🌊🌊
Anyone fooled by #traitor tot is seriously delusional!  This is #TrumpsAmerica   Not Biden’s. You are a byproduct of your damaged fathers need to win at all costs. I read the book.
In 2009 the unemployment rate was 9.9%.  In 2016 it was 4.7%, a reduction of over 50%.  During the last 3 years of Obama / Biden the US economy added more jobs than the first 3 years of Trump (even before the virus).
I have faith in the men and women of our military.  And I think it might be the Secret Service who would drag Trump out of the WH, part of their job in protecting Pres Biden.
Biden quote:  ““Mark my words I think he [Trump] is gonna try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can’t be held.”  Turley, you are an embarrassment.
Please let’s hope she does, it might be a faster exit for both Biden and her.
It will be ready for Biden.
Biden Is Right. Pay for Home Health Workers Is Paltry.
Do you usually demean African American female doctors? Or is this just you following Biden's lead?
Swing state no more, Michigan is voting for Joe Biden! Ride the blue wave home.🌊🌊🌊🇺🇲✊🏾💪🏾🙏🏾
“The former vice president went on to condemn police officers who have been on duty during the protests, saying it is unacceptable “for our police — sworn to protect and serve all people — to escalate tensions or resort to excessive violence.”
Watching television in #Michigan just got a whole lot better
The only way Biden and the Communist Democrats are going to win is if they cheat YUGELY!  This has to be prevented!
No it's the Democrats whose base is dwindling. Democrats see all of this senseless violence on TV and are afraid of it. If Biden somehow cheats his way into the White House the police will be eliminated, taxes will rise and unemployment will skyrocket.
It's funny how you Democrats never talk about Biden and what he plans to do. I guess he hasn't been told yet by the DNC?
team biden + kerry = 💙
Duct tape her mouth and Heels Up Harris couldn't get a job as a Walmart doorgreater!
I am a Biden supporter I’ll follow you
Yeah! I like how he's telling everyone to wear masks in the video below, but do you see him or any of staff wearing masks? 🤔
Can you link something from Biden laying this out?  Quite sure he’s said on the record he will not end fracking.
Every time Joe Biden takes his mask off, he looks like a dotering old fool!!!
What would be a bigger slap in the face to Bernie supporters and progressives: Biden tapping as his VP a "tough-on-crime" former DA in Harris or a hawkish "humanitarian interventionist" in Rice?

Joe Biden slams President Trump’s coronavirus response | WNT  via
Biden says he'll name a running mate next week - Axios
This one will likely endure. There is a real connection between Joe Biden and Susan Rice that is rooted in their service together in the Obama Administration as VP and National Security Advisor, respectively. This should not be dismissed.
We have to do two things. First we must get 45 out for good, then we have to create a new left wing people’s party. The DNC beltway folks want, like  Biden, for everything to stay pretty much the same.
Yes indeed.  Vote Biden.
He can do it closer to the debates or after if he needs the attention back on him but would be silly to do that interview just because the president did when you’re in the position Biden is in this race. He should still be out there doing press but this one can wait.
What benefit does Biden have to doing that interview right now?
Biden: “I’m about thing that helps our great country of Canada be good.  Looting and rioting is a privilege and should not be stopped by the evil white people of our great country of Uganda.  Ask not what your country can do for you, but what flavor Skittles are the best.”
She became the National Security Advisor as a consolation prize. Amb. Rice is 55, SUPER-SMART AND POISED! Everything about her is impressive! She meets the "Ready to be President" on Day 1 better than anyone else under consideration, and personal relationship matters to Joe Biden
Unlike popular opinion, I believe the inside track goes to Susan Rice. African-American, great foreign policy experience and she has a strong personal relationship with Joe Biden. Downside: Repubs will scream "Benghazi" which is how they blocked her from being Secretary of State.
She is a solid Congresswoman from California, who doesn't have a national profile and would have a steep learning curve. She is 65 and doesn't meet the criteria of a bridge to the next generation. Biden is likely looking at three women: Susan Rice, Kamala Harris, Tammy Duckworth.
This VP choice may be one of the most consequential ever. Not just for the current election, but will be most likely Dem candidate in 2024. Also, likely Biden will not finish first term. So this pick may choose the next president.
VP Biden is following a wise, old political maxim:    When your opponent is destroying himself, don’t interrupt.  stay safe
If it’s in the platform Biden will just ignore it. Candidates usually do ignore the platform.
This is such ridiculous fear mongering.  In Biden’s America my ass.  In trump’s America that lady would be dead from coronavirus because he hasn’t done anything about it, sorry he has - He’s done everything to make it worse than it ever had to be.
NO, that's not why. We all know the real reason why.
Biden leads in Michigan and Trump has one-point edge in Ohio  Blah, blah, freaking blah blah blah. Is everyone's memory as short as my ex's dick? Didn't we go through this the whole year of 2016? All that counts is happens on Nov 3.
So, the Biden campaign should not be complacent.  Still, Trump will not have the economy or a Reagan to lean on.  A “no new tax” pledge in the face of soaring deficits (and following a huge tax cut for the wealthy) may not appeal.  Smearing VP Biden will be all he has.
You already sent this tweet, do you have dementia like Biden?
“In the past week... [Trump] has accused Obama of treason, called his own niece a criminal, &amp; asserted that Biden wants to abolish — deep breath — the police, Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement, bail system, the 2nd amendment, &amp; intriguingly, the suburbs.”
I’m voting for Joe Biden for president because I am a woman, a member of the LGBTQ+ community, the daughter of two immigrants. I’m voting for him because I want bold, progressive action on climate change.
You know, the S&amp;P 500 rose 13.8% per annum while Biden was VP.  Just sayin’.  stay safe
Remember when Kampala called Joe Biden racist? Weird how that doesn’t matter now that she has a chance at VP?
The far left vote is not what’s going to win Biden the WH in swing states.  It’s going to be moderate independents and moderate R’s fed up with Trump.
I'll be making phone calls for Senator Gary Peters and our next President Joe Biden this afternoon.   #100DaysToGo #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #VoteJoeBiden2020
I will be a good American and supporter of the Constitution and vote for Biden despite the fact that I do not support his policies and question his abilities now.
True or false Biden should campaign like they do exist.  For the record think that was extremely detailed and helpful in learning about it.
Foreign policy was the biggest failure of Obama’s presidency.  Why would you want to draw attention to that in your campaign if you’re Biden.  Not only should he steer clear of Rice as his VP he should steer clear of others that served as part of the Obama foreign policy team.
Anyone they chose will have flaws, the only argument Trump has is that Biden is anti police and he’s law and order which is why Trumps goons are instigating shit across the country.  If your running mate is a former Chief of Police that cuts the legs out from Trumps main attack.
I would not for Biden if you paid me. You don’t actually believe this do you. A front? Most of us don’t fly banners because we don’t want our house burned down by the left. Come Nov you will see.  Biden. Bahahaha
Any vote that is not for Biden is a waste!

A reminder of Joe Biden’s beliefs before he began down the present path of not being able to remember the state he was in or office he was running for
Hilarious that the right-wing crazies are trying to get mileage of this clip to use against Biden. Googled everywhere; only the right-wing "news affiliates"never show more than this 22 sec clip. It's obvious he's talking about his surgery recovery &amp; u can't do this now due to CV
Biden's First-Day-In-Office Plan Is A Betrayal Of Working-Class Americans
You haven’t witnessed the things Trump has done. We’d rather have Sleepy Biden, instead of another horrible 4 years with Trump
January 20. If Trump is still there he will be a trespasser in the White House... Biden will be in control of the military. Trump will leave the White House one way or the other.
Yep. But then Biden has said a lot of things that the MSM doesn't report or "remember" (just like Biden)... 🤣
Like even if Joe Biden is more broadly likeable and humble (fucking lol) than AOC that doesn't negate the fact that his policies fucking suck, how is Sean being annoyed at AOC more of a problem for the left than that
Yep, taking my chances survivin’ and ridin’ with Biden here in the burbs of the Mitten.
I saw a Biden lawn sign today in Novi, Michigan, probably by someone who works in a memory care facility.
If Biden wins FL Trump’s path to re-election is vanishingly slim.  Trump would have to carry every swing state he won in 2016.  That includes MI, WI, PA, AZ.  Biden is ahead in the polls in all four.  stay safe
I hear you. The Q people miss how the swamp covers anyone of power in these times, bipartisan child molesters or blackmailed on video. We have to free ourselves. Heck, Trump would vax us to death w/military force! What are these pro-MATAs thinking?! Tho he's better than Biden.
You are absolutely making it up about anyone from the Biden campaign contacting you. Like you would have any reservation about outing someone by name.
Did Biden accidentally a good persuasion here? Everyone is attacking "first" and as a result their brains are accepting the "racist" part?
ME AT WORK TODAY PROBABLY: CAN I COUNT ON YOU TO VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN THIS NOVEMBER AND ALSO PURCHASE TAYLOR SWIFT’S NEW ALBUM TONIGHT?
It’s clearly an incorrect statement by VP Biden.  But note how everyone is focused on the “FIRST racist President” part.
Biden says Trump is first racist U.S. president  Except for the OTHER 12 Presidents THAT OWNED SLAVES: Washington, Jefferson,  Madison,  Monroe, Jackson, Van Buren,  Harrison, Tyler, Polk, Taylor, Andrew Johnson, and Grant! Facts are such pesky bastards.Joe Biden doesn't know what day of the week it is
The average voter is not gonna vote for Biden because his VP is smart about money or “wall street fears her.” The average voter couldn’t give a fraction of a fuck about Wall Street.
strongly disagree. As Trump continues to fumble the ball, Biden should maintain a defensive posture. Announcing a team gives Trump counterplay: characterizing the team as socialist, left leaning, etc. The election is a referendum on Trump so let it be that.
Where is this information coming from? Not Biden! Trump had the spotlight, making one bad decision after another, the media was waiting on anything negative from democrats to take it away. The people making these statements should know better and know how the media operates.
Right. She knows, Biden knows and we know.  It's like Christmas for little kids... they intellectually know Santa is coming but they are super duper nervous all of Christmas Eve.
Yeah, when this thing is over the movie scene is gonna be LIT. There’ll be almost too many highly anticipated movies all coming in a short time frame.
It was supposed to be released 6/26/20.  But due to the pandemic the studio delayed it to next summer. Now scheduled for release 7/2/21.
Biden / Harris is horrible. All we'll hear for the next 3 months is how she locked black people up, blah blah
Again let's be clear if Biden was in this video below partying with Jeffery Epstein it would be plastered on Fox news everyday.  Of course because it's the Dear leader, we hear the sounds of silence!
I can see how strategy of changing VP announcement timing keeps process and media influence in Biden’s hands. Meanwhile, the not so smart mitchy-boy &amp; putin-puppet will be beside themselves.
Who cares this year?   Biden sucks. #NeverBiden
I don't expect enough close states for it to matter. Biden is blowing Trump out. So states like Texas and North Carolina may take a few days to call, but it will just be about margin at that juncture. Biden will be well over 270 EVs.
All true. So let’s get rid of Biden. #NeverBiden

Speak for yourself. I took a carload of my daughter’s friends to the polls to vote for Biden and I’m not over 45. Most of my neighbors are under 45 and all supported Biden in the primary. He handily won Detroit; both younger and older Black voters. Bernie’s rally at my daughter’s

Well, all I said was that you were whining. And you were. It's called criticism. Obviously,  you can't take any. So man up and vote red, stay home, vote Biden. It's your decision.  You may want to work on your writing skills.  Frankly,  you are the one that appears "ignorant ".
Here’s the full report. Biden handily won the precincts w/ high Cuban populations
Then vote Biden and quit whining
Posting a tweet from a random twitter user and a unsourced poll is not proof. Biden won every single county in Florida. Bernard was barely viable.
Who is denying that Clyburn helped Biden? Literally everyone saw it and acknowledges it.
Since when is ambition bad!!  You need someone with guts to do and say the things that need to be said while backing them up with facts.  Biden/Harris 2020
That’s insane. The female VP, under Biden, SHOULD be our 2024 president. It NEEDS to happen.
Also, so what???  We need people to rub people the wrong way at times. Not doing that gets us no where. The key is to know when to do it.  Biden/Harris 2020.
I've been over with this Bachelor-ized Veep-stakes.  I think we have enough things in 2020 stressing us out.  Biden doing this long, long, vicious process has me pretty disgusted.  Still voting Biden, but this is pissing me off at this point.
Pretty sure Melania is voting for Biden
How many do you think would be dead if Biden was President? (Keep in mind Biden would NEVER have banned travel as quickly as Trump did....Trump’s ban needed to be more, FAR MORE STRINGENT, but it still saved countless lives without any doubt).
Biden is the most inept, corrupt and racist candidate ever   Being a victim of dementia doesn't help his case either   He belongs into a nursing home not into the White House
Going from Clinton +1.5 to Biden +10 seems pretty good for Ds
Biden’s VP pick will be another scapegoat to blame after they lose so they can blame the weak candidates instead of their weak ass party.
it’s fuck Trump and Biden forever 🖤
Hard to think if Trump loses the election, he will actually be unconstrained ( which he actually is now) to say whatever he wants. He will dominate the media and social media directly challenging every Biden decision. The birther thing was child's play compared to what's coming
Definitely! She already displayed it in that infamous debate with Biden!
White people realize that the 2 most powerful positions on earth are going to be held by black people before white women. Elizabeth Warren is to old we need a VP in their 50's or below, because Biden is only doing 1 term. Then we'll have a all black President &amp; VP.

All the attacks happening in real time. You seem to be so focused on “ew Biden” that you’re allowing an admitted racist, sexist, misogynist to blind you to just how terrible he is. And, frankly, such blind following obedience will continue to lead this country to hell
Joe Biden’s actions go against Community Standards!
I know this is going to sound politically immature, but I don’t really care if Trump delays the election.🤷🏾‍♀️  That is how much I can’t stand Joe Biden. #NeverBiden
Right, if Bass is VP then and Biden wins, then somebody like Whitmer or Harris are just going to destroy her in 2024 if Biden doesn't run. Problem is that there are a lot of people who will want to be in that position and it will get messy.
Harris and Duckworth are "do no harm" candidates. The rest have baggage and Bass really brings little to the table and does some harm. Bass maybe won't outshine Biden as much, but seeing as Biden has run a cautious campaign so far with success, I don't see how he strays.
you couldn’t come up with a better candidate than BIDEN.   Great guy. But 77. Seems like he can’t handle the stress. In hiding. Will he do that when a crisis hits this country.  Conflict with other countries. I take my chances with crazy trump.  At least I see him
Aunt Jimimi would have been the best V.P. pick for China Biden but the bernie bros and girls cancelled her🥰
Not for me lmao. I think people aren’t going to make the decision again to not vote. People may not like Biden, but know he is the lesser of the two evils.
That makes it worse we supposed to matter more to each other but I guess that old saying is true that if you ain't voting for Joe Biden then You ain't black LOL. My reading comprehension is great I'm just terrible at not engaging with people who are yoga instructors. ✌🏿
You’re in a red state Biden doesn’t need. 🤷🏾‍♀️
How come your:    “I don’t care what side of aisle you’re on comments”   Only ever glorify the Left side ....   it’s disingenuous ...   Just like you; hashtag Biden me too.   #metoo
Hoping that grassroots enthusiasm for #WarrenForVP might make it happen...  But also not wanting to give Biden money just so he can pick someone else...
Only way I’d ever vote for Biden
Joe Biden’s background isn’t squeaky clean but look at the alternative.
🤦‍♂️ The whole “Biden has dimentia” thing is a baseless lie spread by the trump administration with no evidence to back it up. Biden even went to the doctor and got his brain checked. Surprise surprise he doesn’t have dementia. Trump however (according to psychologists-
Ok then why don’t you support Bernie Sanders who wants free healthcare for all? Or even Biden who wants to expand apon Obamacare to make it more affordable?
I don’t believe Joe Biden won the nomination fairly
Absolutely not true. No one votes for the VP unless their feelings are still hurt over Bernie. FFS, this is about getting trump out. Vote for Biden, get over yourself w idea VP counts.
Who the fuck cares? Vote for Biden. If you don’t, you’re really just a chaos agent.
Seriously? You’re sowing division. Grow up and vote for Biden.
No pics of Biden with WOMEN--just Fake No-News! But HUNDREDS of pics abound of Sugar- DaddyTrump SHITFACED on ALCOHOL &amp; leering at every PORN star &amp; PROSTITUTE. And u MUST have 4gotten about that filmed "Girls Just Barely-14" ORGY that Trump bud Jeff Epstein had. There's Trump...
Yes...but to be fair, you also cost lives when you told people to vote during the pandemic and, like Trump, you also don't have a plan to get everyone universal healthcare; in fact, you said you'd veto it---&gt;
No corruption to report about Biden.
go away! why are we hearing from you? oh I know because Joe Biden can’t make a sentence .. #Obamacare
I can answer that.  Joe Biden is going to do the exact same thing every Democrat does during times of crisis: Absolutely nothing useful.
I mean the Iraq war and war on drugs killed more than 150k people so I don't know if Biden is the best comparison here?
ICYMI: “Serious-minded people recognize this is not a serious-minded White House and not a capable president"

this is the problem with liberals. they think trump is the only problem. even worse, they think voting for biden is the ultimate solution. 🤢
He left out interveiw's &amp; Press Conference's,we thought ObamaGate was the BIGGEST HOAX!, NOPE!, punting Joe Biden ALL the way to the WH IS!, imagine if he did WIN!, The ONLY Pres to NOT have a SINGLE! HARD! interview!,PEOPLE are OKAY with him NOT having a HARD interview!, #SCARY
Nice try Devin Nunes, you scumbag!
Joe Biden said  You Wont Have To Worry About My Tweets!  You know Why?!...  Because he will be TOO BUSY FIXING ALL THE DAMAGE Trump created!!!  HARD WORK &amp; HEAVY LIFTING AHEAD.
The clip is of him using an iPhone X. I’ve seen it. So that’s a lie. And besides all old people struggle with new technology. The lie that Biden has dementia is a baseless lie not backed up by one fact created by Donald trump. So maybe do some research before you blindly believe-
Democrats lost this election when they nominated Biden and you know it.
That's funny. You're a real hoot. However, I believe Joe Biden was vice president when Barack Obama pulled us out of the great recession.
You should be worrying about trump’s dementia. The lie that jo Biden had dementia is just that. A lie. He has been proven not to have dimentia. But trump is still running smear ads against him and laying nonstop. And you’re buying it. Honestly stop being such a 🐑.
Actually he didn't. He said NOTHING about the Bro Behavior until AFTER he CONCEDED the nomination to Biden. #toolittletoolate #nocreditgiven
Hey. Don't be supporting dopey Joe Biden. You seem not to realize that the majority of your followers are Trump supporters.
My long time democrat family members who hate Trump are actually voting Trump as they all feel there are no conservatives in the Democratic Party ....5 family members turned off by democrats and NONE of them believe Joe Biden is a leader but a puppet for sinister reasons
Kool,  no one needs to Vote Biden look at that lead he's got.     Biden will be the next Hillery Clinton  only look better with a sharper Mind  Bidens mind is like butter knife
Why does this Obama have way darker skin than the one in the first video endorsing Biden your skin pigment doesn’t change that fast #CGI

I remember when Biden Bros attacked the union of culinary workers and weaponized them 2 cheat workers out of better conditions.   The most corrupt anti workers cheered.  I remember.
Fair; I disagree with how Biden put himself in a box like that, he should have never said that, but that's here no there, it's done. You can't please everyone that's impossible to do, these decisions are set up for criticism by somebody, so just pick the best qualified "person!"
we need “moms for biden” and “R moms against trump” campaigns ASAP ‼️‼️‼️       ‼️‼️‼️
No he isn’t
My guess is the company has a zero tolerance policy stating masks must be plain w/ no writings/symbolism/flags  If u allow the US flag u have to allow BLM, confederate flag, swastika, Trump, Biden, Drew &amp; Mike Pod, Walter the boof announcer, Luke Newacki, Death Wish Coffee masks
You were that hot guy running for president from Washington State, amirite?   And you were big on the environment?   I wish you were the nominee.  Sorry, but I am not voting for that creepy, pedo perv, that wrote the crime bill Joe Biden. He is corrupt too. #NeverBiden

This election is bigger than your pride and ego. It’s about choosing the best candidate to move your agenda forward. Right now we have two choices. Neither one is perfect; but as you can see from his platform Biden is MUCH better than Trump to get more of what you want.
I thought we were behind Biden now. We should be. I will never understand how Republicans do so well to fall in line, but Democrats struggle. Trump called the wife of Ted Cruz ugly and dogged his Daddy...Cruz is in line. My candidate was Warren...now I’m RIDIN WITH BIDEN!!
I took a ride to upper mi  guess what?  NO BIDEN SIGNS..... TRUMP SIGNS EVERYWHERE!!!! WE WIN
You must not read her timeline. Clearly she hates Biden more
President Trump def. has to shock the world again and beat crazy joe biden.  i think this race will come down to the wire again.  covid-19 def. is the biggest issue going into this election no doubt.
"biden is further left than any democratic president in history"  i just burst out in laughter
Funny the Democratsand Biden they play down the pandemic.  So that’s a long shot blaming him.  Trump said to wear something over your face.  Even a scarf and thay was before CDC announced. Cdc said 200k Americans will die.  That’s was their best case. Nancy was in China town
You actually think the puppetman Biden could have a complete coherent thought, on what or how anything must be done to move the ball forward? It’s not really a question, we all know the answer. He can’t tell the difference between his wife and sister for gods sake!
Biden’s VP
CNBC is not bias... you are laughable Mr. Puppetman Biden. You are not even the puppeteer, you ARE the puppet.... WE SEE YOU OBAMA. You will never rest easy now that truth of your administration is emerging Judicial Watch.....anyone?
He didn't feel this way before running for President. Black people would still be screwed because of what Biden wanted in 1977. Will you leave your little children alone with Biden Alyssa.
Good thing Biden didn't get his way in 1977 then huh
I never once said the “black vote” is a monolith. I live in Los Angeles where it’s obviously MUCH different than in the south. Still doesn’t change the fact that the majority of black voters in this country voted for Biden and that’s why he’s the nominee.
both are terrible. although one would certainly be better than the other. to me what matters most is the people they choose to be apart of the administration. trump has shown that his admin is full of blubbering idiots. I think biden would bring a good admin similar to obamas
Read Biden’s platform or don’t. Vote for Biden or don’t. Your rigged conspiracy narrative won’t change a thing. I’m just sorry that I’m the “posturing” idiot for correctly pointing out that Biden is the nominee cause he had more black voter support than everyone else
Biden is running on the most progressive platform of any major party’s nominee in US history, at the very least since LBJ. He’s worked with Bernie and has adopted many progressive plans. Your frustration w/how the primary turned out doesn’t make a word of what I’m saying untrue
Imagine if Biden hadn’t shown up today. He would’ve been “old and sick and unfit to lead.” Meanwhile when people were bringing up Bernie’s age and health issues for MONTHS, we were laughed at and dismissed. Wake me up when Bernie is held to the same standard as everyone else
So do I. Biden and Kamala are a...
Yes. You’re right. “Biden is the nominee become of black voters” is not true at all. It’s total bullshit. Bernie is king of everything, the whole thing is rigged. The Dem eStabLishMent hacked and rigged EVERYTHING. You win.
High(er) than that boob biden in likely to get elected
Remember when Bernie was old and had heart issues and was running for President and his supporters kept saying how none of that would affect his ability to lead? Same people who went after “old man with dementia” Joe Biden for not leaving his basement.
Lin-Manuel Miranda Endorses Joe Biden: “Our Democracy Is At Stake” - Deadline  via
But God damn it if he picks Kamala as VP I am going to have the hardest time voting Biden.   Please don't make me wanna kill myself after voting. Thx.
Look, I decided awhile ago that I'll (begrudgingly) be voting Biden this fall because of how bad Trump has handled the BLM movement and COVID-19.
GW Bush was hands down the dumbest president in my lifetime... but Biden is taking it to a whole new level as a candidate.
If you’re asking would I vote for Biden the answer is yes...
Maybe he got it from cuomo while he was out yelling at people.  He wasn’t really locked in his basement, only Biden was.
I saw one today...something about how many degrees Biden has and receiving half a scholarship supposedly in his own voice but it didn’t sound like him. 🤷‍♀️
Yeah I can’t imagine him showing up for Biden’s inauguration. He’ll have some excuse. I just want his margin of defeat to be so large that he can’t lie to himself about it. He’ll lie to everyone else for sure. But I just want him to have to admit to himself that he lost.
....CHUMP?! ALL Democrats? Pretty SURE of the voting electorate, eh SPORT?! I'm guessing that u haven't VOTED too often. Ever hear of EXPERIENCE? It's ONE of a thousand things WRONG with Trump--who had none. Biden has MORE than anyone. ELECTABILITY. Biden HAS it! Not Bernie.
Based on the Fox talking heads and the Twitter Trumpers tonight, I’d say it was a pretty good day for Biden.
Cmon, ⁦⁦ Make them put their names on this crap or hit delete. Journalism 101  “We'll be back on the air shortly, even more forcefully exposing Joe Biden as a puppet of the radical left-wing," a senior campaign official told CNN.”
If trump wrong with his calculations to make himself look good.  It’s the same thing Biden said trump should stop flights from China and overreacting. Now Biden said he didn’t say that. I remember loud and clear. Trump wall vs Joe Biden telling trump not to put band on travel.
Biden said he has his final four down to four women of color. I don't think he would include Elizabeth Warren in that inclusion.
Take it easy there, Nervous Ned! U been on a long acid-trip the last 5 months? The Covid Kid lay u up in a hospital somewhere without TV, radio, Internet or Print news?! Biden has slowly been rising in the polls 2 stake a double-digits lead over the ONLY person whose out of it..
Hard to FUCKING believe! Believe me: after Trump's done FUCKING UP AMERICA with this HIGHWAY ROBBERY SHIT, Biden--should HE lose--WILL ABSOLUTELY appeal the results. And WIN! Bcuz Trump will HAVE 2 CHEAT 2 come out ahead on Election Day.
The congressional black caucus delivered the nomination to Biden. I think he should pick Susan Rice. Governor Whitmer needs to stay in Michigan right now
He was there in the 60s and his supporters act like thats enough. They also attacked John Lewis for endorsing Hillary and Biden. Know who else was there in the 60s?? Mitch McConnell. Does he get a medal too? If Bernie was the hero he claims to be, he would’ve been there today
TRUMP666 SUGGESTION on a delay for the 2020 Presidential Election is so you AMERICA..
They don't care.....I've seen Biden voters argue against nearly every one of those things. The fact is that most Democrats are actually Republicans and don't seem to realize it.
I’m a Black Mother. My mother is a Black Mother. We are both voting for Biden. So is my daughter ✊🏾
Our youth are a tiny tiny part of our electorate and Most of our kids will be voting for Biden where it matters. Biden won our district by over 20 here in Michigan. He won Black voters under 50 by a lot
I already love PRESIDENT BIDEN 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
How would everyone feel about a Biden/Whitmer ticket?
trump and biden are literal bums im SICK
"[Biden had a] leading role in the Obama administration's 2011 efforts to slash the deficit by...cuts to Medicare and Social Security."
"Joe Biden Tried to Cut Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare for 40 Years....Biden was once a New Deal Democrat. Then he “evolved” and starting backing decades of Republican plans to cut Medicare and Social Security."
Biden is devolving into a memory care unit poster boy
I’ve said this in another tweet.  I believe it’s Amendment 20 that says if there’s no election, the day the president was to take over, the Speaker of the House is temp. President. So Republicans, would you rather have Biden or Pelosi???
Yeah right!  "Joe Biden Tried to Cut Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare for 40 Years....Joe Biden was once a New Deal Democrat. Then he “evolved” and starting backing decades of Republican plans to cut Medicare and Social Security."
No one should believe you, Joe---&gt;
All Trump's doing is EXTENDING the PAIN &amp; MISERY of losing 2 Biden. He will try something--&amp; it will FAIL. He will try ANOTHER--FAIL. Another--FAIL. FAIL. FAIL. FAIL. FAIL. His attempts at staying in power will fail more than his Business ventures. FAILURE'S even more certain...
}I heard vice President Biden say when he become president I guess folks can say what they want to say yep cuz I'm gone do that anyway you can count on me^
Trump is the best president we’ve ever had and ever will have. The Biden followers are just too stupid to know it.
Also, read Amendment 20, I think it is.  If there is no election, the speaker of the house takes over on the date the president should have taken office.  So my new question to Trumpsters is would you rather take a chance losing to Biden or have Pelosi?
Oh, so like I said, there is no difference huh?  In fact, I’d say that Biden is far worse and much more dangerous than Trump.  Might as well keep the Zionists, racist, rapist conservative we have.
I don’t care... 🤷🏾‍♀️  Like Joe Biden is going to be any better.
Ya know how Presidential candidates on the campaign trail used to kiss babies? Biden could shake my baby and I'd still vote for him #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
How about when KKK member senator Robert Byrd's was eulogized by Joe Biden, Joe Biden praised the ex Grand Wizard of the KKK,he actually called him BOSS!,if you support Joe Biden!, you support a RACIST!
And the narrative continues!! The Cabal wants Prez Trump out so bad that they have this weasel say statement. If you believe this idiocy,  then put a mask and GOGGLES on you idiot and vote leftist, I mean biden or who ever the running mate is, because biden is failing quickly!

I sure miss Obama: “If we want our children to grow up in a democracy — not just with elections, but a true democracy, a representative democracy, a bighearted, tolerant, vibrant, inclusive America — then we’re going to have to be more like John [Lewis].”
It’s gonna be something like “the rules are so unfair to me”.  The smart play for Joe would be to agree to any rule with the exception of “only Trump can attend and answer questions”.  If Biden does that Trump will keep moving the goalposts in his effort to validate backing out.
Biden at 49/50% in all three states. Y’all running outta stuff to talk about.
Random thoughts on Biden's pick for VP, does it really even matter as long as they're competent?  The longer they wait the less time fascidemic45 and the Qnuts have to spread outlandish conspiracy nonsense.   Conservatives have abandoned the lunacy. All they have left is nutjobs.
That is real, isn't it.  "Settle for Biden".  Someone got paid for that.
Conspiracies aren’t facts. Biden is the nominee because of southern black voters. Period. Have you even read his platform?
Really hoped we’d get Bernie Sanders this time a round but Joe Biden gon have to do
I will take Biden's problems and his picks any day compared to what we're experiencing right now. Real talk. This country is not in a good place right now and it is getting worse every day in my opinion.
I think the debates will seal things. I just don't think Biden can keep up with Trump on stage. Gonna cast a pretty strong contrast
NATO is an alliance  Germany nor any member country owe dues or fealty to 45  Pulling troops further from their defensive positions only emboldens Russia to further land grabs like Crimea, Georgia and Transinistra. Along with their ongoing efforts to erode democracy.  Vote Biden
THANK YOU! As soon as John Roberts swears in Biden, Trump is done. Let him chain himself to his desk and get dragged out kicking and screaming. Who exactly does he think he’s hurting?

Seriously, French Republicans don’t even go anywhere cutting universal healthcare or elderly pension (social security), there are about blaiming everything on immigrants while enriching themselves. Still assholes, but better than Biden.
Even if it was true, thats really not saying much. But it sucks that he has to sell Biden to his base because of the urgent necessity to remove The Orange One. The DNC put us here.

Future history classes are going to try and pretend that all of these protests were about Trump, and we were all longing for the leadership of a calm and sensible Joe Biden.
Wonder if it’s still “clever” if President Biden tweets, “I’m doing such a great job, I think I’ll stay for another 8 years.” Will it just be a chuckle for everyone of would Republicans freak the F out.
Obviously he's changed his mind. Maybe Joe Biden is listening.
I didnt think so until reading this.
You can be someone who won't vote for either Trum or Biden, and still be very concerned about Trump's threats to cancel the election. It is still important to vote, especially in the downballot local elections.
so are you gonna cheerlead and knock doors and advocate publicly for biden?
Or how much Biden touches and talks about children and how he likes them jumping on his lap. ON VIDEO!
Cheaper then Biden corruption
Don't worry. In 6 months, we have a chance 2 have a REAL U.S. Gov't CURE ALL OUR ILLS in a NEW POTUS--Joe Biden &amp; his tremendous staff.
And I don't know if you haven't figured it out yet but your God Obama turned a funeral into a Biden rally. And yet you still blame everything on Trump. You're a joke.
why the hell not!  i don't feel the mail-in-voting will be fair for President Trump.  dems  will basically stop and nothing to get biden in office like terrorizing are cities, killing policemen etc.   i think people need to think of the alt. of Trump, biden and the soc. dems.
All urban areas need to ensure proper training, irrefutable counts &amp; rolls. The trump campaign will try to eliniminate &amp; intimidate areas with large minority centers such as Detroit, Philadelphia, Milwaukee, Miami, &amp; Cleveland in battleground states. Biden needs observers.

You wanna vote for Biden cause he’s not Trump? Fine.  But I never thought I’d see Palestinians and Arabs cheerlead for a guy who openly and proudly says “I am a Zionist.”  It’s shameful. #Palestine #FreePalestine
I got a strong feeling Joe Biden is going to pick Kamala Harris as his VP...
I hope he picks Susan Rice because she'd be ready on day one if GOD forbid something happens to President Biden.
You seriously have issues if you believe Biden has any chance...  his first debate is going to be amusing.
Trump runs like a business man and has been very successful. Put your TDS aside. It would be nice if the Dems had a candidate. He has cognitive issue and it’s truly sad. Trump is just a New Yorker that says what he thinks. I do feel bad what they are doing to Biden
Real question: do you think Biden is at all capable for any office?
We can get Joe Biden elected if we can have a perceived crisis until November 3rd  Some businesses will close and some people will lose their jobs, but many people feel Joe Biden is worth it
The more that the public perceives a crisis, the more likely they are to vote for change.  The longer Governor Whitmer can extend the "crisis", the better Joe Biden's chances are November 3rd
Might things become just a little too obvious when Biden gets 19,000,000,000 votes?

Trump offers many statements that are phony but current economic disruptions are not the result of one person. This derailment included the near entirety of both parties wounding the economy and abandoning the public. #US #CARES #Democrats #Republicans
That’s exactly what you want. Blame trump from virus and losing job. And get Biden in office.  Win Win for the liberal media
so we can vote for a lying-liberal who will bail-out wall street, not fight to insure everybody in the land, &amp; bomb 4 more countries than we already were? ehh , no , not for Gary Peters &amp; Joe O'Biden-Bama, the "Other Biden" Democrat  vote for independent parties cuz D &amp; R soldout
NOTHING will stop me from casting my Vote for Joe Biden
Corporate press promotes Susan Rice as #Biden running mate  The former Obama national security advisor is identified with illegal wars, drone missile assassinations and an aggressive posture towards both Russia and China #NeverBiden #socilaism2020
Nobody, and I mean nobody of sane mind, actually believes Trump is trailing Biden (who can’t form a sentence).   What’s Interesting here is  can’t even say  but rather refers to him as “opponent”  That’s embarrassing on so many levels.
"Joe Biden Is No Friend of Public Education"
Biden will likely do what Obama did---fill his cabinet with people who paid for his campaign, letting Wall St manage the economy &amp; insurance lobbyists organize healthcare--&gt;
You’re still scared of running against Biden. You’re not confident in your record as president. Your approval numbers will go up if you resign.
Read the article please, it talks about Trump's lies. We all know Trump the idiot is a compulsive liar. What is less understood, it seems, is that Biden is also a liar and not to be trusted---the policies he's pretending to support now run counter to his decades-long record.
Absolutely--&gt;  "The following is a sampling of some—certainly not all—of Biden’s lies in a variety of areas."
Endorse Biden or your words are empty
What authority does Biden have to do anything right now? These people are the dumbest.
How mad y’all gone be when y’all find out Biden picked Whitney as his running mate? I’m going to be pissed’t

There are major differences between Tara R. Story and Elisabeth C. Tara has contemporary witnesses to whom she told her story. And Biden himself has shown a pattern of unwanted touching.
I'd be wearing a Biden 2020 shirt. The company I work for sent a company  email  telling everyone to watch Fox for their unbias Covid info. I responded with the respect for Chris Wallace but after that Fox was rated very low and listed the news organizations rated much higher.
Turns out Biden was a prophet.  And if his prophecy coming true surprises you then you haven’t been paying attention the past 4 years.  That Trump was going to float this at some point was a very easy sure money bet.
Ms. Rice, what Americans really want to know is if Biden sniffed you or your mom in the coffin.  We know he didn't sniff the flowers.

I was responding to what you sent about Vice President Joe Biden. The poverty discussion was in a different tweet. The war on poverty also hit a major snag when Richard Nixon shuttered the Office of Economic opportunity was dismantled by Nixon and Eliminated by Regan.
Everyone has a different perspective. I've experienced the opposite. Berners have been the worst 🤷🏼‍♀️ KHive is loyal to the Democratic nominee whereas a lot of Berners/Warrenites refuse to vote for Biden if they don't get what they want.
I understand Biden's statement likely stems from ignorance. But hopefully you can see that for us actual Anarchist, the danger when both major US political parties are demonizing and threatening  state violence against us doesn't diminish simply because the intent is ill-informed
Franklin &amp; Marshall have the PA generic ballot at D+4 with Biden +9, something we've seen before here with Biden outrunning the generic ballot.
And Biden will be president you know the one who was racist all his life because you aint black if you vote for trump... oh wait you only talk about what the Republicans are doing. You're no hero just another pawn. If you condemned everyone equally then I'd be more supportive.
Joe Biden might not be perfect but wouldn’t it be cool to have a president that atleast addresses the oppression rather than tweeting “LAW AND ORDER!!!” Every 24 hours.  Idk maybe I’m wrong and each are equally effective.
Imagine being so brain dead that you think that Biden would be as bad as Trump.
Analysts imo are way low in their estimates of $VIRT Volatility is only going to increase after Biden picks his VP and election comes closer.   The 3rd Q could be bigger for the company
I hope Biden makes you his running mate, but if that doesn't happen, he'll surely make you A.G. in which case I hope you throw  and Bill Barr in a federal prison where they both belong!
No way Biden is winning without Michelle Obama as VP. Biden is being guided around by a NURSE. He is so deep in a mental illness, it’s sad that the Democrats allow this to happen.
But why did Bernie bail? And then ask us to support Biden? Almost seems like he’s not to be trusted. 🤔
Wut? Don’t think they want to raise that topic. “‘But as Bill Clinton once told me, the number one cause of Alzheimer’s is ambition,’ he added, while noting he’s in favor of Demings.”
Both options are terrible. I'm a Conservative and I've never voted for a Democrat. I'll take 4 years of Biden over more 4 years of Trump.
So if trump gets re-elected due to Universal Mail-In Voting is that considered a fraudulent election or is it only if Biden wins?Yeah I get that too.  Im either a Russian bot or a trump supporter. Who knew?  Biden absolutely sucks.
40,000 #WarrenDemocrats raised 1.5 million for Joe Biden today.
I’m getting so many texts from both parties (which is what happens when you’ve voted Republican AND Democrat over the course of nearly 20 some years). I wish “please stop texting me” worked. Trump’s party is very demanding via text. Biden’s side is more pleading, but polite.
Yes yes Biden equals socialism and communism poverty and violence and terrorism
Not true because Trump will be out of office. The truth is Trump is the reason for the protests. Biden will speak to the concerns of the people not send in troops to dominate like we're communist China.
Well, Biden's stated point-blank that it WILL be a woman, so they're just gonna have to deal with that regardless.  As for her "not being black enough"...Obama had a white mother and is relatively light-skinned, so that makes zero sense to me...but I'm a white dude, so (shrug)...
Another Biden nut case!
It’s going to be Nikki Haley. Trump’s campaign is circling the bowl and he’ll figure that selecting a woman of color will neutralize Biden’s advantage with women and minorities. Trump doesn’t need Pence, anyway. Trump already has the racist religious bigot vote locked up.
Check Biden’s website for detailed proposals. Have you heard any plans from Agent Orange about what he plans to do with his second term?
Biden wrote the tough on crime bill which created the mass incarceration situation. He also wrote the Patriot act. The war on drugs, as well as the drastic reduction in rights over the past 20 years, is a direct result of his legislature.
A little off topic I believe the trump rally’s Biden rally’s need to end along with protesting it’s just to dangerous with the pandemic going on to be doing that stuff trumps rally over a dozen people had tested positive
Trump may have a leg drop but he can complete sentences.  Biden in one rally last year forgot what office he was running for.  He shows signs of dementia he’s almost 80.
Biden might actually win.
Biden versus Trump. Some speculate that the future of the republic hinges on the outcome of the next election. But for smart investors it doesn't really matter who wins.
After 4 years of Biden’s tax cut republicans will want to end that. How do they convince voters a tax cut for them is a bad thing.  Who of you reading this couldn’t use 7500 a year fed tax cut?  How many middle class gop voters you know will vote 7509 away from themselves?
Folks.  I have been extremely critical of Biden for months.  I will not disrespect this page or it’s mission.  I have an Idea that would almost assure Democrats control all 3 branches of government for 50 years.  I want to try it out on this page to see what your think

But Biden is definitely the lesser of the 2 evils and we have to pick one if we pick none we risk trump winnin
I admit Obama care needed reforming as it wasn’t fair for certain individuals but Obama saved the country most Americans aren’t educated enough but research quantum easing Biden is the lesser of the 2 evils he’s the best hope we can have believe me I much rather feel the bern
I mean yes the dnc fucked him over but Obama personally called and asked Bernie to drop out cause we need to unite against a common cause and if you listen to any of bernies words at any rally’s he started with each rally it’s not about me winning or Biden it’s about taking down

Too late to find a better candidate so you rather the suffering continue with trump? With this belief you might as well change your bio to “I’ll be supporting trump cause im sure as hell not supporting Biden”
You’re not a democrat if you vote for trump if you do and think your a democrat you’re not educated trump is too far right to have any democratic beliefs Biden is a moderate democrat in the middle which means he will have republicans and democrats on his side good luck
Im voting for Biden I refuse to let my children suffer with Donald trump as president. Global warming isn’t a myth people are all over the streets of Michigan holding help me signs with their kids 5 6 years old no help from the president only tax cuts its time to end this shit
I wanted Bernie so bad I went to all his rally’s when I heard Obama asked Bernie to step down I was so mad but now it’s time to put others before myself we can’t allow trump to win and not voting for Biden will pave the way for Donald trump
The people who don’t vote for Biden will condemn many others to death suffering standing on corners begging for food and shelter cause trump and republicans wanna cut their income if you aren’t gonna vote for yourself think of those suffering biden wasn’t my first pick either
More lies.
I can see this coming Nov 4th!  Trump declares he is still acting president forcing his rule even  after losing to Biden.   Trump will declare Biden’s presidency as illegitimate and urge new elections!!! Country will fray at the seams.  Who agrees?
Sep 15 - on the first presidential debate Trump will completely destroy Biden  Oct - Democrats will release some Nasty video from Trump's past  Poll numbers will show landslide victory for Biden  Nov 3 - Trump will win all the battleground States&amp; we will see a meltdown on TV😉🤞🏼
The argument against Harris is that she was a terrible primary candidate, did no homework on health care, CA is not a swing state and Senate Democrats have been absolutely useless in pandemic.  Biden needs a virus fighter like Whitmer of MI.
Would love to read an interview with a voter who's still sitting on the fence at this point and hinging his or her vote on Biden's VP pick.
That is exactly why Biden was a Corporate puppet for 50 years.  He sucks at many things but grass routes fund raising is top of the list. He does and votes exactly how the corporate puppet masters order him to. Then they pay his re-election bills for screwing the working class.
Joe Biden has his work cut out for him in 2021
Biden will undo this on day one.
Also, the best way for Harris *to* position herself for another run at POTUS would be to DO EVERYTHING SHE CAN TO ENSURE BIDEN'S AGENDA IS SUCCESSFUL.  Undermining him behind the scenes isn't gonna make her look good, it'll just make it more likely that a Republican wins in 2024.
All he needs is a harmonica
They take him around like they just picked him up from the COVID senior citizen home #Biden #elderlycare #Pedowood #election
LOL. No Biden will not do that.  Please don’t tell me that you think your supporters are so stupid as to believe these lies. How disrespectful you are. What they should believe is: #TrumpDeathCount150000 #TrumpPandemicFailure
Don’t stop for one minute. Work for Biden like he is 10 points down. We have to bury the orange menace.
This echoes Biden levels of racism. Likening poor people to non-whites. Race was not relevant here until you brought it up.
How come no presidential candidate offers a solution to reduce our addiction to cars? Biden's proposed support for EVs sounds enviro-friendly, but doesn't deal with traffic congestion or pedestrian/bicycle safety. Trump wants us all driving Buicks from the 50s.
Does that mean we should accept 26K dying/yr? Of course not. That's why the House passed ACA 2.0. That's why Biden's plan would be ACA 2.0 + a robust PO. Maybe it'll get through, maybe not. Hopefully we can cut it down to, say, 10K/yr over the next four years.
I think it’ll be Kamala Harris or Susan Rice. Who do you think it will be? “Biden says he will pick running mate by end of next week” #vppick #vp #JoeBiden #Biden2020
You haven’t read Biden’s plan, nor have you read the ACA 2.0 bill just passed by the House, have you?
They don’t want a hearing they want a linching mob. That is a dictatorship or communism, we tell you what it is you don’t have a say in anything we are the dukes and dutches. A view of the inside of the World Order, if Biden becomes president.
It’s a joke same o same o deny deny deny. Spend the time trying to get news topics to take away the importance of the Attorney General, if not make him a puppet. So you can say Trump is bad, not that Biden is good. Also tie down the economy to hurt the outcome of the election. BP
And here’s Biden’s plan:
1. “Democrat Party” is a right-wing phrasing. I didn’t know whether it was deliberate or not. 2. I’ve written extensively about the Medicare for America bill pushed by Beto and the plan proposed by Kamala. And Biden’s plan may not be 100% universal but it’s very close.
Except NONE of the Dems were ever proposing the status quo and Biden’s plan is pretty damned good:
This is such nonsense. Today, Warren Democratics have been sharing a link for a fundraiser happening Friday to support Joe Biden. Of course we’re going to vote for Joe, he’s adopted half of Warren’s plans.
Joe Biden was a U.S. Senator for 36 years and the Vice-President for 8. I guarantee you his political skin is thick enough not to risk the most important election in our lifetimes over some heated words a year ago.
This whole thing is stupid. Obama picked Biden as his running mate even after the “articulate/clean African American candidate” incident.   I don’t know if he’ll pick Harris but if he doesn’t it’s not gonna be because he felt slighted by the busing exchange.
Is Biden going to pick #HeelsUpHarris for his flunkie?
I’m not a fan of ACA. Highest priced to consumer plan on earth. We also pay more for prescriptions than any other country.  I could go on and on all night but you this is true. Nobody on earth has a valid argument against these facts. Biden is a pimp
They are supposed to be Corporate assholes on the right. The reason I’m voting for them is we nominated a corporate owned puppet too.  Trump may destroy Wall Street and Big Banking. He might end the ACA money grab.  Biden will do exactly what the puppeteers order him to.
You should have called and I could have driven with my new Biden Bumper sticker.
Here’s the thing. If Trump wins in November I’ll be bereft because I apparently don’t understand my fellow Americans. Again. But I’ll accept it. If Biden wins and Trump refuses to leave office, I’ll probably lose my mind. And move to France. If they’ll take me.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot  IT IS TIME TO FLUSH THE TURD #TrumpMustGo #FlushTheTurdNov3rd
If Biden wants to gain a share of the senior vote held by Trump. Expand Medicaid and Medicare benefits. Expand social security benefits and reduce co-pays and deductibles and premiums. Lower drug costs. Add dental. Eyeglass. Hearing aids. Phase it in if necessary.
Biden yellingat
after the events of the past week or so I'm grateful that Biden gave me his blessings to vote for someone else
TRUMP IA SOCIOPATH BIDEN IS NOT
is barely 4 years in politics and get to blamed for all American problems accumulated in half century. Joe Biden is half century in politics and only get to blamed why he’s not defeating  #TheGreatAwakeningWorldwide
Well thanks for supporting Biden. We need to take this country back. Get things settled down. Clear out the Senate... Then start working on universal health insurance/care. Get Covid-19 under control. Start holding business and citizens accountable. Rebuild public education.
Biden is puppets of Left and he is surrounded by people like Shakir, country is going through so much and his first priority is open ban on Muslim country doesn’t think about people in USA
Biden will never choose Kamala Harris, she is Indian origin, Biden advisor Fiaz from Pakistan will never allow Indian person to be Vice President
What an angry, uptight person you must be. You couldn't be happy with all the great things he has done in just barely 4 years? Best president we have been lucky enough to get. Just watch our great country  crumble underneath a socialist president if we are cursed with Biden.
Michigan Voter for Biden.  #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica  #Biden2020
You can’t be this ignorant.  Unpopular or popular doesn’t matter when the PAC money is used to buy and maintain ownership of politicians.  Pac money pays Biden like politicians to vote the corporate way no matter how popular anything is.
True Christians are Pro-Life!! So disappointed you’re voting for a senile pro-choice candidate-Biden😖. Rethink your liberal views. I started to respect you and now I don’t!
All I want for Christmas is a Biden WIN !!
You have it right Charlie! That’s why I’m voting For Donald Trump and I have loads of people gathering together on voting for him!We can’t take 4 years of Joe Biden!
Not racest President Trump simple saying how need make sure Native american are Native Americans good example take look at Elizabeth Warren said she was Native american she lie how about Biden Obama 👇👇👇Democrats party now 🤯🤯🤯
I’m rooting for Kamala, but would be ok with pretty much whoever Biden picks. Having said that, this was a stupid and insulting thing for Dodd to say. His job, as I understand it is simply to review potential running mates and give his advice to Biden, not to shoot his mouth off.
Fair enough. I’m at the end of my rope with these worthless centrists. Biden is trump on Ritalin.  Trump is spastic probably on drugs. Either way he is a much better candidate than Joe.  Trump could do real permanent damage to Wall Street and Banking industry.
Faiz Shakir, Bernie advisor, make him lost primary now advisor of Bernie, He his advising every thing wrong to poor Biden, he is not able to figure it out how bad he his at least will be good for Trump
Me?  I don’t think Biden is a Corporate Owned worthless centrists his voting record proves it. Go ahead and google it.  Or just remain clueless. Either way, I don’t care.
To give Oboma little boys and Biden little girls with clean hair to smell and touch.
Well said.  Biden has to end Bush tax cuts. That will eliminate corporate funding for many democrats. Mid term will be a blood bath.  Progressives ain’t giving him a dime. Boomers are dropping like flys. Biden won’t accomplish shit. GOP will rule for a decade after this mistake
The good news is I can vote against every democrat on my ballot and if enough folks follow my lead..... I can Hillary this Biden nomination and it won’t cost me a dime.
Because Citizens United which worthless Biden voted for states Corporations are people. They can donate any amount to any PAC. Corporate interests own 99 percent of politicians, every Newspaper, News station, lobbyist, and “ ALEC”.  I don’t have 90 million in checking to compete.
F giving money to Corporate Joe Biden. I’ll give her $100.00.
Where is  and the millions he promised to give to get Biden elected?
Integralists for Biden, explain??
50% of Strong Liberals Support Firing Trump Donors; 36% of Strong Conservatives Support Firing Biden Donors
Harris was totally unprepared for her primary run. She never figured out a position on health care.  As a Senate Democrat, she has been useless in the pandemic. Biden needs a virus fighter like Whitmer of Michigan.
Biden should only agree to debate him 60 days after Trump makes a full public disclosure of his taxes.
By voting for Biden this coming November 👏👏👏
Today,  announced his agenda for women. I'm pretty excited about it, and you can see my full thoughts below.   Check out his agenda here:
Gimme a break. Anyone can retrace what happened and come with an “I woulda” plan. What did Biden actually say, as steps were being taken?  Based on that, your Monday morning quarterbacking wouldn’t look too good.
Very important program from Mark Levin about Left/Biden politics for Suburbs. Everybody should educate themselves about plans of the Left to change the American Life, which we do NOT want. Please watch, VERY IMPORTANT, but they won't tell you!
Media will not call out Biden on any of his or his campaign or surrogates lies. That gives him quite an advantage!!
We know now that Biden is a clown figure without an ability to think for himself. He represents Socialist Left Party that we shouldn't call "Democrat" any more!!!!!
Will do future president Biden! Thank you for the Tweet regarding our current one. I refuse to verbally say the Sociopaths name. It was the first tweet on his page for about 30 minutes. You have Michigan, all us educated housewives in the suburbs, and us Black Lives Matter folks.
Still in his basement? Biden campaign declines interview, one week after Chris Wallace's Trump sitdown
Every time I see a Biden commercial I throw up in my mouth a lil bit
YESSSSSSS Mr. President Joseph R. Biden 100 more days until you’re elected finally &amp; we’ll be able to breathe a sigh of relief than we’ll just have to pray that time flies until your inauguration!!! #BlueWave2020TakeOver #Biden2020Landslide 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊
Can’t wait to hear Biden say:  “TEAR DOWN THAT WALL”
Tucker Carlson is warning America that if Joe Biden wins Donald Trump's America will no longer exist.
For your information Biden voted for and with Republicans for more than 40 years. Biden sucks. Biden wants to cut Soc Sec. Biden sucks. Biden is a Corporate Owned Puppet. Biden sucks. I ain’t voting for Biden. Biden sucks.
Ms. Rice, I expect to see you in the White House as the VP having a discussion with President Biden.
realDonaldTrump: There is NO WAY a place like Pennsylvania can vote for the Radical Left and their puppet, Joe Biden, when they are against fracking, steel production, and just about everything else that Pennsylvania stands for. Likewise, Texas, and many other states!!!
I’d be scared too if you lose the Senate and White House prison lurks for trump.  But I agree with you Joe Biden is a fucking Republican. I can’t vote for him.
I don’t like Joe Biden. I am not voting for Joe Biden.  I see polls that say Biden is way ahead. Ok. That’s fine. I don’t care who wins.  God damn are there a lot of trump tards who comment on Biden’s tweets.  If Twitter was an indicator Biden would have no chance. Hate is deep
Trump sucks. So does Biden. Not voting for Biden. Complete waste of time
What have the Democrats done.There backing Biden who has got lost in his basement.Theres almost four years wasted on this clown in the White House. I’m not voting this time.Trump has destroyed this country.The Coronavirus,lost jobs.He has done nothing but lied
Prediction. Biden ends  Bush tax cuts. Corporate interests cut off a Biden and lay off workers. Biden can’t raise grassroots money Biden loses in 2024 after accomplishing nothing from 2020-2024.
Lol 😂😂😂😂. Biden is the most disloyal pos democrat I have ever seen.  He is so bad I left the party. Vote against the working class for 40 years is loyal. Wanting to cut social security is loyal.  Maybe he is loyal and we are all in the wrong party.
I’m not voting for Biden.  I don’t think a vast majority is voting for Biden. You might be right. I predict extremely low turn out because Biden is a Republican
The polls assume progressives are voting Biden.  I’m not. We shall see
Biden has a 40 year voting record every Republican is envious of.  Biden is a Corporate owned pimp
Hummm Sarah banks just saying if I had to chose a sin for a sinner her she Black young and looking at her movies she Gay/lesbians friendly her movies are XXX no biden not Xander cage the other XXX no biden not alchole the other XXX damn it biden not 30 she dose porn OK Damn😅🤣😂
Biden has Wall St. and the corporations. It's kind of in insulting for him ask for our money. I have vote for him but he can fuck right off if he thinks I'm gonna finance centrism.
Who said I was a Trump follwerer? Umm last I looked this is global.  I will not vote for Joe but if there was a great independent out there I would vote. I voted for Obama in the last election. Biden will be a puppet. Back to the real issue. This has been all about money. Watch.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
realDonaldTrump: The Trump Campaign has more ENTHUSIASM, according to many, than any campaign in the history of our great Country - Even more than 2016. Biden has NONE! The Silent Majority will speak on NOVEMBER THIRD!!! Fake Suppression Polls &amp; Fake News will not save the R…

449 comments 3 were either pro Biden or Centrist Karen’s melting down worried we won’t vote for Corporate Joe
Me too. He is everything I want in a president.  My hatred for Biden, the DNC, and every worthless centrist can’t possibly be measured. I’ll never vote for a non progressive democrat for life. F Biden
Pg 2.  Since then ( about 56-60 years ) corporate interests have given trillions of dollars to elect who they wanted in office. These hand picked politicians like Joe Biden have been puppets on strings passing corporate friendly laws. Continued
Dignity. Truth. Respect. Honor. Biden.  What are your five words today?   #MasksIn5Words  #SaturdayMotivation  #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare  #personmanwomancameratv  #TrumpIsUnwell
Biden will crime less
Because folks like idiot corporate owned Biden voted for Citizens United resulting in corporate interests own our politicians at the federal and state levels and the media.
I was sickened to read that the Michigan Police Officers Union is endorsing Trump. This means you endorse police brutality, white supremism, racism, misogyny and treason. You also lied about Biden and Obama in the press article, welcome military equipment. Extremely disappointed.
So am I.  Even more, I am looking forward to kicking out the Trump Criminal Enterprise from the White House and see decency resorted with President Joe Biden.  #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020
who is this clueless loser Mo?  Watching him is like listening to the Counterfeit News Network.  Nothing but lies and fake news.  A vote for Biden is for the end of our country.
An easy choice to make.
Charlamagne Tha God says Biden should 'shut the eff up forever' after calling Trump 'first' racist POTUS
Get ready to continue dealing with protests.Biden may not be the greatest.But Trump is a racist.compulsive liar.What has he done for you donut eating  support his sorry ass
#DementiaJoe ‘Rambling episodes of incoherence’ Howie Carr: Joe Biden says … well, we don’t really know – Boston Herald
Last year... Here's every word of Joe Biden's most rambling answer.
She was a lot of people's first choice. But everyone correctly assumed people were too scared to put a woman at the top of the ticket, so they wasted their primary vote by using it AGAINST Sanders or AGAINST Biden, because ultimately we're all AGAINST Trump.  And so it goes
Dear Joe hope you heard what Michael Moore sais “Biden needs to start acting presidential now hold morning brienfing every morning and tell the public what he would do now, and then every night a fireside chat. Every day from now until November \!
I've seen more Biden signs in Rochester Hills. Not many trump signs at all. But drove through Macomb County the other day and there are still a lot of  yard signs, flags, and big billboard-style trump signs everywhere. Needed a shower after I got home!
Because the black presidents agenda was to instill total racial divide and destruction!! Oblunder and Biden racist worthless administration!
Biden will cancel.  You watch..there will be an elaborate excuse from the lying dems
No it would be Biden’s America! The guy is a complete nut case! As for setting up Booths up for for for Democrats they cheat! And people are walking away like flys from the Democrats! I sure don’t want to raise my children in a socialist state or Country!
I won't sleep well until January 20, 2021, with Joe Biden having been sworn in as President and the GOP no longer controlling the Senate...and even then I'll know the work has just begun.
Biden can’t put two sentences together!
Biden should be in prision along with Obama!
You are more likely to hear Biden is having orgies in the White House than he does anything a progressive would appreciate.  It isn’t going to happen.  Vote 3rd party or if your an asshole like me vote trump. Biden voted with Republicans religiously since the 70s
Hell no. F Biden. Never Biden. You want me to vote for a Corporate owned pimp that voted against the middle class for 40 years.  I am voting straight red the entire ballot in response to nominating a worthless corporate owned centrist.
Your vote counts too.  Did you really vote for Biden?  No need to answer none of my business. God bless
There is no democracy now. This is an oligarchy.  F Centrists.  Every time you nominate one most of us vote Red.  Dukakis, Kerry, Gore, Clinton all worthless corporate owned centrists.  They all remind me of worthless Biden.  You might win this year. Hillary was sure of it 😂
Huh I believe every Democrat is voting for Biden.  If not he really really is the shittiest nominee ever.  Independents don’t like him at all in numbers. Most Republicans hate him. That I don’t understand. If I just saw Biden’s voting record I’d bet the farm he was a Republican.
Shit like this...... 84 year old woman cleaning up used rubbers and filthy toilets in a roadside shithouse is why I can’t vote for worthless Biden.  In 34 years that could be me.
I respect her a hell of a lot more than Biden or Trump.
Should the only Biden ad just have Trump saying: "Slow the testing down, please"?
And won’t take a single reporter’s question to boot... Karl Rove: Joe Biden's lackadaisical coronavirus, climate and economic ideas
Civil rights attorney blasts Biden for 'insulting' African Americans: 'I'm Black and I'm not voting for him'
Hallelujah! Charlamagne Tha God says Biden should 'shut the eff up forever' after calling Trump 'first' racist POTUS
China refuses to leave their embassy in Huston TX This is a declaration of war. If you think they want  to remain President you're poorly mistaken. China hates us &amp; wants to rule aka kill us. China paid Hunter Biden millions from after  threatened them
...nominating part of the RNC will BE in Charlotte. He's running against VP Biden --- but a major opponent of his is the Coronavirus which is bad now - in large part due to his inept handling of it all.
President-To-Be Biden, you earned my vote! Go Phillies! As long as they finish ahead of the Mets!!!
In case you haven't noticed, Donald Trump bears zero resemblance to any other President in the history of the country.  So Joe Biden promises not to shoot anyone in the face, then tried to do so but shot them in the leg instead, you'd rate that "Promise Kept"? Is that it?
Tramp offered to take a test with Biden. Let’s have psychiatrist evaluate both of them and release the results. He asked for it.
Katy. Love you. Let’s have Trump and Biden be examined by psychiatrist and tested but the results probably be released.Trump said he and Biden should take a test.
Hi Nicolle. Let’s take up Trump and have both he and Biden examined by psychiatrist and tested. Results will be distributed to the public.
Yes. As I note in my deep dive, I'm actually a little puzzled by Biden's "Medicare 60+ buy-in" addition, since it seems to be *in addition to* his Public Option (which basically means those 60-64 could choose between an employer plan, ACA plan, Medicare *or* his new PO).
1) “Presidential”? So,like a movie POTUS and lies more eloquently?? 2) Trump has listened to science. The science evolved and changed. Fauci, same. Biden may consult scientists. Too bad he wouldn’t understand and would forget what they said 10 mins later.
OMG the Obama Biden stream. Oh my. Oh my.
This is Trump's sick but weak attempt to convince people that this is what life would be like under Biden so of course his koolaide drinking followers buy right into it
realDonaldTrump: Obama, who wouldn’t even endorse Biden until everyone else was out of the primaries (and even then waited a long time!), is now making a commercial of support. Remember, I wouldn’t even be here if it weren’t for them. I wouldn’t be President. They did a terr…
You obviously don't get it. You can say whatever you want about Biden, he is still the better man.  is a lying, cheating, racist, narcissistic psychopath. He's committed two impeachable offenses JUST THIS WEEK. There is no bottom to how low he will go.
Why continue to lie about Biden? Trump &amp; supporters are scared. They can’t promote themselves because the truth is that bad.
Biden is a sick 'genius' who should NEVER be a president!
You are missing the point of the video, rather than critique Biden. Just saying.
The only thing  has that  doesn't have is dementia. Biden's the best democrats can Do? No wonder they keep sleepy Joe in a bunker. It's not to save Biden from the #ChinaVirus it's to keep us from seeing how bad  mind really is. He's dems puppethUnTeR BiDeN who?
Hell, we aren’t safe in Trump’s America either. I’ll take my chances with Biden.
Joy I’m loving the idea of President Pelosi if Donald mess up the election. I think he would rather Biden win. 🤣🤣
Frump is a sorry excuse for a Commander in Chief! We need Joe Biden to lead our Country back to prosperity. 🇺🇲👍🏾🌊🌊
I’m getting so many texts from both parties (which is what happens when you’ve voted Republican AND Democrat over the course of nearly 20 some years). I wish “please stop texting me” worked. Trump’s party is very demanding via text. Biden’s side is more pleading, but polite.
Biden is a way better person than tRump will ever be so get over it. He’s a born looser!!!
Joe Biden says that we have a "crimate clises".  I think he's right...
A lot of Biden’s allies seem intent on making an anti-Trump election into a validation of what the left base wants, which Biden has smartly shied away from. The question will be whether Trump continues blundering around so it doesn’t matter or not.
No, it's just leaked to get your exact reaction. Let's just be cool and wait for the decision. Obama didn't choose Biden until mid-August.
Our country currently faces many challenges.  Joe Biden is not the answer to any of them.
It’s going to be Nikki Haley. Trump’s campaign is circling the bowl and he’ll figure that selecting a woman of color will neutralize Biden’s advantage with women and minorities. Trump doesn’t need Pence, anyway. Trump already has the racist religious bigot vote locked up.
Ironically texting everyone 👍after Biden on that livestream has inevitably led to just doing it
Check Biden’s website for detailed proposals. Have you heard any plans from Agent Orange about what he plans to do with his second term?
What are the chances that  squeals on #NobodyLikesTrump before dersh gets sent to jail and subsequently Epsteined?
Joe Biden says that we have a "crimate clises".  I think he's right...
Yeah, probably after Biden picks his VP but before the conventions (or when the conventions would have happened and whatever they're doing now)
They just figured out that saying Biden was the president of antifa wasn’t gonna do it
Biden might actually win.
Sorry. I guess I'm just used to people slamming Biden being Trump supporters. I can't defend everything Biden says, but right now, he's the lesser of two evils.
Nonsense. Biden wins it’s over.
To those who keep bringing up Biden's gaffes as a defense: Joe could say he comes from the planet Blobbo where the currency is peeled grapes and everyone rides around on space capybaras and I'll STILL vote for him. Just like you'll defend whatever batshit insane thing Trump says.
Joe Biden say that we have a "crimate clises".  I think he's right...
So when I see an ad that says you're doing a good job I should think about the lower drug prices we'll get under President Joe Biden? Sure thing!
What's sad is that people support Trump at all. Say what you want about Biden, Trump is 100x worse.
Joe Biden say that we have a "crimate clises".  I think he's right...
Bernie is actually on record saying that “if Joe Biden wins the election, he will be the most progressive president we’ve ever had”.
Yep! It’s exhausting just saying anything positive about Biden or anyone else outside of the GOP hate machine. Good luck and have fun. #VoteByMail #Vote #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #LoveIsEssential #Peace #KindnessMatters
Sorry, but Trump has to go. Historically I'm a 3rd party voter, but not this time. I cannot stand by and watch my country get destroyed at such a ridiculously rapid pace. When Biden get's in, we can work together to pressure him for change. Trump pays attention to nobody.
2/3 Obama Biden Holder spied on the Press; has to apologize to Germany/Merkel - MSM had Obama Biden adm spying throughout 8 yrs - O/B historical view is a PATTERN OF SPYING and violating The Constitution + working to overthrow Israeli PM
why is anyone surprised that Obama Biden spied in an Oppo party and Presidency of  - their entire 8 years was shown to be at its core spying eg c Clapper lied to America via Congress re Spying on All Americans; AP, Rosen/family; Congressional Committees; Merkel1/3
Stop being dramatic, every single poll I've seen shows a majority of Bernie supporters voting for Biden.
I'm going to level with you in this. Biden was not my 1st, 2nd, or even 4th choice, but he's the nominee. I will not only HAPPILY and ENTHUSIASTICALLY vote for Biden, but I will continue to share and donate and do whatever I can to help ensure he is elected
Many people did what you propose in 2016, look at what we got. Now is not the time to waste a vote on someone who can’t possibly win. This really is a 2 man race. We need our country to heal. While Biden may not be perfect, he’ll at least respect the constitution.
Less than 100 days to vote for Joe Biden #WeWillVote
Joe Biden is not the answer to any of the problems that we as a country face today.
No worries. I will drop my vote by mail ballot off at my local clerk’s drop box to make sure my vote for Biden is counted.
I can see this coming Nov 4th!  Trump declares he is still acting president forcing his rule even  after losing to Biden.   Trump will declare Biden’s presidency as illegitimate and urge new elections!!! Country will fray at the seams.  Who agrees?
And Biden didn’t?
Absolutely correct. Biden nerds to hammer 🔨 that home. We've either lost a Family member  or we know someone who's died. This isn't a joke. This guy is still golfing it off, as if it will go away. Sick!
Swing state no more, Michigan is voting for Joe Biden! Ride the blue wave home.🌊🌊🌊🇺🇲✊🏾💪🏾🙏🏾
Should say ‘Dems self destruct’. Biden allies move to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president
There's a better than 50-50 chance that Biden is just a delayed Democratic version of HW.
I hate to break it to you all, but if a white dude would seal the deal for Biden, he'd be picking the white dude. The VP pick is solely a pick for political purposes with the secondary that they might be president someday, though based on history, they probably won't.
The best part about the speculation about Biden’s VP deliberation is the near anger from liberal commentators that Biden actually intends to be president rather than an empty vessel that gives a leg up for 2024 to one of his challengers
It’s annoying because it’s going to be portrayed by our presentist media (with a handful of presentist historians) as being true when it’s pretty much the opposite. It isn’t a man vs woman thing. This pretty much defines the VP. It’s just liberals wish Biden wasn’t the nominee.
Joe Biden says we're having a "crimate clises".  I think he's right...
Would love to read an interview with a voter who's still sitting on the fence at this point and hinging his or her vote on Biden's VP pick.
Proud Detroit Suburbanite for Biden. Also, not afraid of low-income housing destroying my “American Dream” #SuburbsForBiden #detroitwillbreathe #detroitworksharder
No it's the Democrats whose base is dwindling. Democrats see all of this senseless violence on TV and are afraid of it. If Biden somehow cheats his way into the White House the police will be eliminated, taxes will rise and unemployment will skyrocket.
It's funny how you Democrats never talk about Biden and what he plans to do. I guess he hasn't been told yet by the DNC?
According to #Democrat  women can not succeed unless he is elected President   #tcot #gop #migop
Elizabeth Warren attacked Biden over his politics as well but I don’t see people yelling about how she’s too ambitious and will only use him to become president. Why is that, exactly? Did she do it the right way or something?
For the record, Elizabeth Warren directly attacked Biden about his politics but I don’t see a bunch of his allies saying she’s potentially going to backstab him  It’s almost like a bunch of white people are mad about a black woman who doesn’t just settle for being the help
It was a bill Obama and Biden had in place that Trump ended and has resurfaced. I agree with the latter.   Just providing context.
They take him around like they just picked him up from the COVID senior citizen home #Biden #elderlycare #Pedowood #election
Last I checked, Obama and Biden bombed seven countries, invaded Libya illegally and furthered wars in many places. It’s time to bring everyone home and end the incessant wars. The 90s called. They want your unnecessary fear of the Russian boogeyman back.
Why use photoshopped pictures of Joe Biden being a creep when there's already a bunch of actual pictures/videos of him being a creep?
Don’t stop for one minute. Work for Biden like he is 10 points down. We have to bury the orange menace.
Way more Biden ads over the last week in MI. When you take 45 plus days to address an emergency (dam breaks), you’re going to lose support. I bang remember the last time I saw a trump lawn sign unlike Biden signs on every other block.
If your a Biden supporter your a  pedophile.
He is all talk. Biden’s basement buddy
Biden's sitting there like "what a fool! Everyone knows you can't actively undermine the poor. You have to do it with euphemisms by attacking charity over unrelated culture war issues and banning charter schools/school choice"  Trump: "What do you guys think of debtor's prisons?
Joe Biden says that we have a "crimate clises".  I think he's right...

The country currently faces many problems...and Joe Biden isn't the answer to any of them.
Ha!  Those are Joe Biden rallies going on in Portland, OR and Seattle!  I didn't know that!
Trump holds another ego filled, rant, spewing his normal dangerous, emotional BS &amp; propaganda so the big crybaby can make himself out to be the “poor, weak, pathetic victim”.  Incompetency &amp; denial at the highest level during a pandemic.America deserves so much better. Vote Biden
In trump’s America. But he’s going to project it onto VP Joe Biden, who hasn’t held office in four years.
Biden ads say he's going to "Restore the middle class" but, seriously, what does that even mean? It's just as nonsensical as "Make America great again." So much meaningless rhetoric, yet people eat it up like free shrimp during happy hour.
Look around you. There's nothing Biden can do yet
Biden most likely does have some type of disorder. I wish I could prove to you how wrong you are about Trump, though. Smart people shouldn't need to brag about "acing" a cognitive test. You're confusing his political instincts with business instincts, which are also terrible.
Thanks. I'm with you. I'd hoped for someone else but it's the hand we're dealt. We can deal with 4 years of Biden but we won't survive 4 more years of this.
Let's get this straight. I'm not in love with Biden any more than I was with Hillary but I would literally vote for a block of cheese before I would EVER vote for Trump and not voting is not an option. Even if trump were a good president(he's not), he's exhausting.
This is a perfect example of biased mainstream media. They tell you who to vote for when it comes to public office. Donald Trump, Joe Biden, AND Jo Jorgensen are running for President. Jorgensen is the BEST candidate BY FAR, but CNN disagrees. #JoJorgensen2020 #VoteLibertarian
Next year, when the Biden Administration is in place and the GOP no longer controls the Senate, there need to be explicit laws put in place criminalizing the exact conduct of this travesty of an Administration from start to finish so this never happens again.
Sounds like you want Biden?
Ask Gates Biden wrong on every foreign issue
I really like Duckworth. I feel like Rice, like it or not, will have the stupid unmasking baggage.  I’m a bit more excited for who Biden’s AG will be. They’ll be busy day 1.

And Joe Biden's VP pick is... Raj Bhakta?!
The fake quote from Biden is such a perfect example of how the media thinks West Wing is real life.
I'm not a big fan of Donald Trump as President...but I do know this...the answer to any problem we are facing as a country is not Joe Biden.
According to Joe Biden we have a "crimate clises".  I think he's right...
Honestly immunity from religion isn’t bad.
Kind of like Joe Biden telling that black guy that he's not really black.  Welcome to Woke America 2020 where things only make sense if you smoke enough crack.
I don't think this will be true. No one is going to want to be opposed by the president from their party in a primary. Biden probably won't play as much in the primaries, though.
Video: Frank Luntz Urges Joe Biden to Pick Karen Bass as Running Mate   Luntz bias is pathetic
I wish that BLM and Biden would condemn their folks' violent means to make us less racist. The IRA renounced violent means to achieve unity on this day in 2005.
Which we will do when we vote your dangerous &amp; deadly ass out and vote for Biden in November(by absentee ballot, returned by hand to county office).
Sometimes I don't even know. With any luck, Biden is a stop gap... but... you're right, the potential is there for something awful.
If we can't pressure Biden and the DNC to support m4a now, when they need our votes, why would anyone believe we can pressure them after the election, when they don't need our votes?
What an angry, uptight person you must be. You couldn't be happy with all the great things he has done in just barely 4 years? Best president we have been lucky enough to get. Just watch our great country  crumble underneath a socialist president if we are cursed with Biden.
Wall St knows Trump is a loser like everybody else so they are supporting Biden cause he is smart and cares about this country.
It’s astonishing that his supporters don’t see that.   Like when the Trump campaign runs video of riots and looting in the streets and claims that this will be Biden’s America when the video is literally of Trump’s America!  What is wrong with these people?!
Biden is not special your right but unfortunately he’s what this country needs right now for 1 term to get us out of the pandemic, get us out of the recession (which him and Obama did before), and get everything back to normal. Theirs bigger things in the US than conspiracy today
Dear don, this is happening in trump’s America. VP Biden hasn’t held office in almost 4 years. Are you sure you passed that cognitive test   ?
You can do that by getting out of office and let Biden take over...your trash as a president...let’s fix the economy together starting with you retiring to mar-I-lago Florida and letting  take over come on make America great again #TrumpIsALoser
Joe Biden is not special but he’s more special than trump..did you see any campaign commercials he is still talking shit to trump. Clearly trump is exposing himself the world already in a bad way. Trump has shown his own racism to the world and shown he don’t care about Americans
I've learned a spell that will help defeat Trump Biden will win, make Don look like a chump So gather 'round and listen real close... Azarath, Metrion, Zinthos
I just find it interesting how Non black leftist are so selective when discussing“problematic” scholars,oh and sense y’all seem very dedicated to making it seem like Dr Davis got on live tv and professed her love for Biden here’s what she 𝘼𝘾𝙏𝙐𝘼𝙇𝙇𝙔  said.
There is an irony to this - can you imagine being working on his campaign and hearing him say that? Wish I were there to see their faces. I wold not put it on my resume. Worked on Biden Campaign- the nurse breathed into it trying to make it live!
Romney gained huge ground, Biden saved the campaign, Trump absolutely sealed the deal with lots of voters in the Midwest
You Know...I wish Michelle Obama would run w/Biden..She would Bring ppl out &amp; they will be lined up to vote like they are buying concert tickets. Susan Rice has many yrs of experience also. She will help Joe enormously!!
Where is  and the millions he promised to give to get Biden elected?
Come on! DO NOT LET TRUMP WIN! If you were for Bernie, you should be for Biden!
Biden should only agree to debate him 60 days after Trump makes a full public disclosure of his taxes.
There are some things I disagree with but I can’t in good conscience vote for trump or Biden ,
I hope V P Biden tears it down when he becomes president.
Today,  announced his agenda for women. I'm pretty excited about it, and you can see my full thoughts below.   Check out his agenda here:
Not uneducated nor am I manipulated by CNN. Americans know this election is all about socialism vs capitalism !  Joe Biden is a democratic  puppet suffering from dementia!
I hope but nothing happened to little Bush and Cheney or the assholes that crashed the economy in 08 so I'm very skeptical. I don't see Biden going down that road. He's gonna try to "UNITE" the country. Good luck with that.
China, Iran and other despots need Biden. American and the rest of the free world need  Southfield, Michigan needs #Trump2020
We all watched it live, we know he lied. We’re more worried about when(but really if) there will be consequences.  If the answer is Jan. 2021 under the Biden administration, whoa boy are Republicans in for a doozy.
They’re treating it like a game show, which I’d expect from trump. Biden is better than that
Never heard of that and any info I’ve found on it doesn’t imply it is. Now go call Harris a cop elsewhere, because I’m sure you’re part of that camp.  After leftists felt themselves calling AA voters in the south who voted for Biden dumb and low info y’all have no moral ground
Yeah, no Biden or Trump signs on my lawn but don’t get it twisted, I’ll be voting blue down the ticket.
I love that you consider Biden the radical left. 😂😂😂
Media will not call out Biden on any of his or his campaign or surrogates lies. That gives him quite an advantage!!
The reason she’s being targeted is because she’s a strong black woman who isn’t kowtowing to anyone. Elizabeth Warren went for Biden’s jugular too but I don’t see a bunch of white people wanting her launched into the sun
Almost 14 months later and y’all weak asses still can’t get over this. And why doesn’t Elizabeth Warren get this same heat for her criticisms of Biden?
Ah yes, lets suppress the voters who actually support Biden. Do you even hear yourself?
Attacking Biden on foreign policy would involve Trump having a consistent, semi-coherent foreign policy.
It shouldn’t make me emotional when a conservative comes out in support of Biden, but this is how far Republicans have fallen.  There’s a grim fate for those in the GOP who went all in for their power grab.
Agreed but who will help us the most right now? That answer is Biden plus he is only good for 1 term....economy wise we’re fucked, healthcare wise fucked, covid wise fucked, education wise Betsy Devos (really fucked), 😂🤦🏾‍♂️😂 black owned business (we went from 1.1 Million to 647K)
I cannot fathom how anyone can't see that Biden is a Trojan Horse. If he won he would not be  running the Presidency.
Every time I see a Biden commercial I throw up in my mouth a lil bit
Vision:  Biden choose Michael Obama.  If they win, doubtful, Biden becomes diagnosed with Dementia.  Michael becomes President.  Chooses Hilary as Vice.  There goes the neighbourhood.
Then why not spy on Biden's campaign. Oh, I forgot. He's barricaded in his Bunker Basement. Wonder if Archie is there with him?
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Pence is an obedient lapdog. And just use it to position himself in 2024, against Pres. Biden and/or whomever may take the baton.
"Retired" politicians younger than Trump and Biden is one of my favorite games. In addition to the obvious George W. Bush and Barack Obama, you have Quayle, Gore, Dean, Braun, Engler, Whitman.
Ms. Rice, I expect to see you in the White House as the VP having a discussion with President Biden.
She's not going to be the nominee after posting this super unflattering picture of Joe Biden.
our pundit, and many of Biden’s campaign strategists, will have a difficult time conceiving that religious identity has the potential to trump racial identity if the former is perceived to be under threat. Campaigns lose when they miss movement. That’s Biden’s biggest liability
Won't he be dragged out by the same secret service that was tasked with keeping him safe because that same secret service will now be tasked with keeping Biden safe?
U r really going to callout Biden 4a verbal error Mr. “I draw on maps 2 cover my ignorance” &amp;don’t care if people lose their lives or jobs. I have 2 cover up my stupidity&amp;blame others every time I’m an idiot. Mr. Don’t Wear Mask because liberals r only doing it 2 make me look bad
Biden has Wall St. and the corporations. It's kind of in insulting for him ask for our money. I have vote for him but he can fuck right off if he thinks I'm gonna finance centrism.
I said it’s unlikely he’ll win, if he does, it’ll be because they did, I think. Biden has been pretty awful on religious freedom from govt interference. I’m sure Trump will hammer him on it the way he hammered Hillary on trade.
But he didn’t say that  He said he wants to beat Biden off, which...I mean I guess some people are into old squinty eyed white guys? 🤔
Biden and Trump seem to have major differences in how they conceive religious liberty. Biden sees it as a security issue, Trump sees it as a freedom of conscience issue. That’s the kind of difference that can drive votes
Remember when Kampala called Joe Biden racist? Weird how that doesn’t matter now that she has a chance at VP?
3/3  Durham must interview Obama Biden Rice Yates Comey Brennan Clapper Strozk Page and why is Wray still not being transparent w docs -he needs to be Replaced    GOP needs to stand w our Pres
2/3 next subject  Lindsay made a lot of commitments re ObamaGate and  has been MIA -just like most  - Obama Biden admin spied on an oppo campaign tired to weaken and take down a duly elected Pres -  has been silent Pathetic
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Is this woman on crack? Joe Biden is hardly a racist.  #MSNBC
Agreed! We have to work as though Biden is behind. Never make assumptions!
Agreed! Voters who want health care should vote for Joe Biden!
I think you have a cute nose team biden
Bernie beat Hillary in Michigan in 2016 head to head. Biden beat Bernie in every single county in Michigan in 2020. He is far more popular here than Hillary ever was.  And this is coming from someone who voted for Bernie this year.
You have been watching the videos and they are such peaceful people, burning, looting, destroying property. People injured, weapons brandished- either you are delusional like Biden or simply evil.
2/2 Maria bring bk Lindsay he talks a good game, but very little movement on Obamagate - he promised and is not delivering - Rubio took over other Chair and has done nothing  should be livid at Wray who is still withholding docs and AG saying Obama Biden won't be looked at
What?! Judge Jeanine is doing a campaign ad for the Biden campaign, also?! Oh, wait. This wasn’t intended to be an ad for  it just came out that way because #Impeached45 is such a complete disaster!! #Veterans #Resist #Resistance #VeteransAgainstTrump
Watch “Biden &amp; Obama Have Infuriating Health Care Discussion” on YouTube
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare  #VoteForOurLives
Hey. Whatever works.  All I know is Joe Biden isn't the answer to any question whatsoever.
Yes, very good Ad. Vote for Joe Biden!
Somebody please! Trying to troll Biden and ain’t even legit!
I'm voting BLUE Chaz. No doubt about it. In fact tomorrow I'm going to fill out my absentee ballot for August 4th. And drop it off or mail it. I haven't decided which one will piss off Trump the most. Voting absentee mailing it in. But anyhow GO BIDEN GO BLUE.
Biden will crime less
The Liberty Daily – The Conservative Alternative to the Drudge Report  share Tweet w AG Barr- Durham Must go where facts evidence leads - this means he must interview everyone at that meeting Yates Obama Biden Comey etc -this was a Coup 1/2
“Joe Biden supports closed borders” I just cackled
I will never forget my favorite President, The amazing, smart, empathetic, hard working, strong, healthy, fit Obama. That is why I am voting for his right hand man Biden in November.
he should of voted for biden.
Biden also didn't sexually assault his daughter, Ivanka. "If she weren't my daughter, I'd be dating her". Who's the pedophile again?
It's not Biden accused by 25 women of sexual assault. It's not Biden that would walk in the dressing room at the Miss Teen America pageants. It's not Biden that was best buds with Jeffrey Epstein. It's not Biden that had Russian hookers give him a golden shower.
Seeing Obama/biden selling out to China...wanting America to b a socialist 3rd world shit hole...demoncrats calling feds protecting federal buildings  from anarchists (not peaceful protestors) "storm troopers" ? ..now...that's sad...I'm sure u agree
Watch “Joe Biden Calls Trump The ‘First’ Racist President” on YouTube It’s either dementia or stupidity. Maybe both 🤷🏾‍♂️
I was sickened to read that the Michigan Police Officers Union is endorsing Trump. This means you endorse police brutality, white supremism, racism, misogyny and treason. You also lied about Biden and Obama in the press article, welcome military equipment. Extremely disappointed.
Biden will be too busy cleaning up the idiot’s mess.
Ironically, you just described Hunter Biden perfectly!
Can Martha fucking Ford sell the lions. Why the hell is joe Biden’s illiterate sister running an NFL team. Assembly lines don’t translate to football.
When do Republicans stop relying on being gaslit?  Seriously, his suggestion to convince someone to vote for Biden is to make them afraid of someone else. That’s all Republicans have anymore.
Who, Trump? Please don't say Biden touches kids inappropriately?! 😰😡
It’s so weird all the criticisms laid at Biden seem to mostly ring true for Trump and his ilk. Could it be projection? 😉
Common Mark. This is the result of Democrats trying to create mayhem. It's life imitating art. Same plot Senator Palpatine used to usurp the power to become Emperor. This time his name isn't Palpatine... It's Biden
Susan Rice, Perhaps An Unlikely Contender, Lands On Biden's VP Shortlist
They're accusing the wrong person. Sounds like Obama and Biden instigate and propagated destruction with no apologies
Biden has slipped. Ok he's almost 80. You'll slip, I'll slip, we'll all slip. Mango Mussolini hasn't slipped, he's always been a fraud and a basket case. My dog ( an Aussie) is way more intelligent and more COGNITIVE. Maybe I'll have her primary your dear leader.
I choose to avoid anything commenting on Biden's mental state as much of it is just mean-spirited. There are 40+ years of documented politicial baggage showing why he should not be president.
I was attempting to explain why only 68% of college students are voting Biden, and Bernie supporters that refuse to vote Biden certainly would explain it.
Biden's showing signs of dementia? Have ya listened to your dear leaders nonsensical, argel bargel, word salads. Yea, nothing says mental acuity like talking about ingesting Lysol or sticking an infrared light up your ass but you stick with that. Ya no his dad died of Alzheimer's
Tucker Carlson suggests that COVID-19 lockdowns were part of a plot to help the Biden campaign | Media Matters for AmericaTucker Carlson suggests that COVID-19 lockdowns were part of a plot to help the Biden campaign 🤦🏾‍♂️
Dream on. Biden may end up with 400 of those stupid electoral college votes especially with Obama campaigning for him.
I couldn't care less if Biden takes a nap for 4 years. At least he'll put competent people in his administration. He won't put "Joe the plumber" as his secretary of defense or "light fingers Louie" as his Attorney General.
Cognitive Test. Trump. Biden. Campaign. Flashpoint. -&gt; 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
OMG the Obama Biden stream. Oh my. Oh my.
I'll vote Biden over SpongeBlob. It's the only responsible thing to do. We only gotta put up with Biden for 4 years. How long has SpongeBlob been presidunce? Seems like 40 years.
Yeah when push comes to shove, no generals are gonna be like, hmm I could just keep being a general under Joe Biden but I think I'll do treason to keep the fat baby around
Like when the House certifies that Joe Biden won the election, who actually stops Joe Biden from becoming president?
The only Trump paths to victory that I hear anymore are one of the following:  What if Joe Biden does something really dumb? What if the polls are all lies? What if Trump rigs/cancels the election?
😂Narcissistic projection ! President Trump Talks About Cognitive Test Again, Says Joe Biden Should ...  via
Biden can’t think for himself so whom are you voting for you don’t know?Chef Blaser....if you need to blame Trump for this so you can sleep better at night, then that's your issue.  But to blame one person for every Covid death in the country is nothing short of foolish.  Biden or anyone else wouldn't have done any better either.
I guess it’s time for the polls to flip Trumps turn to fundraise then the polls will flip back and Biden can make $$$
mail-in voting &amp; absentee voting are the same. Quit trying to put fear/hate into this country. We're not safe in a Trump America. This country right now is filled with hate &amp; violence because of you. Stop trying to say it's going to happen when Biden is president
Quel Surprise.  Trump distorts????  AP FACT CHECK: Trump distorts Biden's position on fracking
No corruption to report about Biden.
let’s just get it straight, i’m mexican, i will always respect the flag, if you kneel during the national anthem you’re disrespectful. black lives matter and so does everyone’s lives but the blm “movement” has become a joke. biden is retarded asf, last of all. kanye 2020
go home Donnie nobody wants you here. We'll even let you take your picture with you. You can hang it next to that Time Magazine and think of better days. Biden 2020
absentee ballots and mail-in ballots are exactly the same. Quit lying to the American people and tell them they're not. Even when there was a big uproar over Bush &amp; Gore it got settled. You're the one who's going to create havoc even if it's a mandate. Biden 2020
Hey. Don't be supporting dopey Joe Biden. You seem not to realize that the majority of your followers are Trump supporters.
Are you serious? I know #covid19 is contagious but I guess so is the Trump family stupidity. 100% of parents want there kids in school just not at all costs. 2nd so Joe Biden's opinion should not influence parents but your opinion should? That's spectacular ignorance &amp; hypocrisy.
It doesn't matter constitutionally. His current term ends on January 20th. In contesting the election, he risks that a timely decision will not be made. That puts him out on Jan.20. Not Biden or Trump, it will be #PresidentPelosi
I talked to a customer today, and they were hardcore Biden fans. They were talking trash about the wall being built. I told them that the wall protects a lot of children being human trafficked. They told me so what?! That’s not the worst problem our country faced.. it’s trump 😂
And  I am hoping Biden &amp; Harris will be in :-) ♥
I think you need to #1 take a look around, YOU ARE NOT DOING YOUR JOB. You can't assess anyone else, you cannot even do YOUR JOB! You cannot even manage a crisis SO BIDEN has to do it for you!
You bet, "make American great again" because it was great until you got in the White House, now we have a mess and Biden WILL make it GREAT ♥
As the Biden Campaign launches “Moms For Biden” tonight it’s important to remember his radical agenda:  ➡️ Higher taxes ➡️ Defunding the police ➡️ Government takeover of healthcare  ➡️ Job-killing Green New Deal  Biden’s destructive policies are completely out of touch with moms!

Stacey Abrams moderates Biden for President roundtable with Michiganders
Stacey Abrams touts Biden plan to support minority-owned businesses with Michigan entrepreneurs
Yeah. How out of touch is Biden now GOP? Biden was right!!!
No need to worry sweetie, it won't be a close election. 3% means nothing when Biden is getting 90% of the votes.
He’s shook. That’s why he’s talking about mail in voting. They know that’s Biden’s only chance of winning.
That’s some funny shit... vote for Biden. Dying! 😂😂😂😂😂
Biden, without a doubt.
hey Biden, operation warp speed, sounds like a plan. This contradicts your assertion that there is no plan to distribute the vaccine when it is available. ( 7/29/20 speech )
Funny how the truth can be revealed inadvertently.
Same, and team Biden is for some reason texting me asking why I won’t vote Joe. I have no problem having a grown up discussion about policy or lack there of but don’t voter shame us and tell us to fall in line, that will not work.
#LincolnProject  I agree w John that  ads arent buying influence w Biden. In part because ideologically the minds behind the group &amp; Biden arent vastly different. Second they have a real stake in this... 1/
BIDEN WILL BE HAPPY THERE
Biden is Discusting!👿
BIDEN AND CHINA ARE BUTT BUDDIES
Yeah he’s an idiot, we know. However pushing Biden on your viewers really doesn’t seem right and shaming for deciding to not to vote Biden is also down right wrong in addition to being highly non productive.
Biden will have donkeys pulling cars by next year if he is elect our good union friends will help him get elected and will put the auto companies out of work
What were sick and tired of is you. Day-in and day-out non-stop. Your mouth and your finger from tweeting. I'm over it Biden 2020
Trump is the one using DHS as his own personal police force INSIDE THE COUNTRY on American Citizens, jackass.  Also, yes, Biden did write the crime bill. He regrets it.  Though what party is supported by the KKK, Nazis, and White Supremacists in this country? OH RIGHT. GOP.
Huh? I'm not pushing deep state. I'm pushing that neither Biden nor Trump is the answer to our countries problems and voting for one just because you hate the other is a bad choice
Curious as to what you think happens when Biden takes office. Please tell me more
Weekend at Biden’s
What's going on in Democratic cities and states is what America can expect in a Biden run America. Because this madness will spread if you Dems win in America. Then in that scenario it would be Biden's America ,only America will be lost if Biden wins.That's why we must vote Trump
He's also working with Bernie to move his platform left. And people can change. I'm not the person I was back in 1996. Or the person I was 10 years ago.  Biden wasn't my first pick, but four more years of Trump and we won't have a country. I'd like to be alive in four years.
Biden commented after Trump used tear gas that using federal police was only going to cause more fear and division and that wasn't the way to go. I think he's going to have people who will not allow the use of federal cops as Gestapo. And I don't think Biden would.
Biden's out and about. He spent a lot of time talking to area leaders during the protests, and LISTENING to them. He's giving speeches in different areas. He was just at the Capital, paying his respects to John Lewis. Pay attention.
Yeah, of course the GOP and Trump increased our debt/spending. I assume you are voting for Biden. Correct me if I am wrong, but Biden would only increase the debt even more.
As all offenses &amp; scandal in the 45 era unpunished &amp; normalized. If Biden wins all the oversight &amp; investigations that weren't conducted will either go w/o consquence by the next admin up tradition. Or the  will piss &amp; moan about time &amp; taxpayers $ being wasted on the past.
It is not that they cant find them, there are a few good candidates that would win in a walk on the left. We are stuck with Biden because they can control him and continue with their agenda.
I  don’t think it was a accident I think they put it out to feel people out I bet they Biden campaign asked them to there’s no way they would burn a “exclusive “ with a mistake it goes through to many people to be a mistake
Bush, Biden they’re all cut from the same cloth
This was all about Biden. They are doing the talking for him because of his mental state. Falls into the delusional do nothing Democrats agenda!
It’s not false. Why is everyone in the media scared to admit this works? Are you all in with the democrats to help get Biden elected!!! Nvm. We all know that answer!
Biden has been in DC since he was 29. And he's going to be an "agent of change". #ClownWorld #WalkAway #MAGA2020
VP for 8 year left the country in a mess then Trump cleaned up their mess SUV driving America,  now  Biden wants to come back and rebuild the middle class...ROFLMAO what back to the left with 3 flat tired YUGO
Hiding Biden going to rebuild the middle class....ROFLMAO
They think of Biden and they think: "oh shit". #Biden4prison
I'm buying Joe Biden at 1¢
you are super drinking the kool-aid, I'm not trump fan, but if you think Biden is your savior... oh shit man.  I feel really sorry for you.
Biden appears to have notes and a list of reporters who are asking the questions. Could they be canned, I wonder.
Keep fantasizing in your tiny bubble. Get an appointment with a psychiatrist for November 4th. Sounds like you’ll need it after Trump destroys Bumbling Biden in the election
Sorry I don’t play republican ping pong, I asked a simple question and you won’t answer it because you can’t refute it. But I will say this, in 40yrs of Joe Biden’s career he hasn’t caused the kind of Damage that trump has pulled off in 4 short yrs.
Trump loves to brag about how many more followers he has than joe Biden. Without realizing that people only follow him to see what insane things he may say next. It is easy to track though without following as she said.
#unfollowdonaldtrump he loves having more followers than  Unfollow trump and start to follow Biden!! #TrumpleThinSkin #TrumpIsACrybaby #Biden2020 #TrumpVirus
I like him in general. I believe Obama to have been one of the best presidents. He chose Biden to run the country, why wouldn't we?
I'm terrified of what he'll do before the swearing in of Biden NEXT YEAR!!!!
Biden's campaign bans TikTok from employees mobile devices #tiktok
I’m voting for Biden and whoever his running mate is. (My personal choice is Tammy Duckworth)
I received a message from Eric TRUMP, he says BIDEN is being finance with DARK MONEY.
you're right... but Biden is who the democrats chose... so you're stuck with him.
I like Rashida, but her not endorsing Biden is bullshit. She needs to stop playing games.
Justice is coming on Jan 29, 2020. They will arrest you right after Joe Biden is sworn in. For crimes and treason against the citizens of the Imited Stars of America. Don’t feel lonely, your whole team will be arrested too.
....  what ...  I mean last night I read some smug, self-entitled shit from Bernie supporters saying Biden didn't deserve their vote because he hadn't earned it; and they wouldn't bother to give it to them; but this?  This fucking is bonkers.
While I admire Val Demings, I don't think she has the experience to be President should something happen to Biden.
Trump has exposed the #CCP and #ChinaJoe brings home the bacon to the tune of $1.5B. Obama/Biden was 8 years of China gaining at the expense of AMERICA.

Yea, your a regular William F Buckley alright. You’re just a trump supporter with a bunch of nonsense talking points on the Rolodex in your head. By the way GOP internal polling has Biden winning Texas. You 38%’s are in for a world of reality come Nov.
You either want to live in America or in Venezuela. Choose Biden and you end up with Venezuela in America. Vote Trump 2020 and America will remain America. Otherwise wake up to a world where every aspect of your life is directed by your government.
I agree with what you stand for. But not your perjorative directed at the President. You certainly don't want dopey Biden in &amp; socialism garbage. Worship Lilith the Queen of Demons and you will feel empowered. That is all. Have a nice day.
is the radical far Right and, for the sake of what we have left of a democracy, must not be reelected. Vote Biden/Blue on November 3rd
Biden will be a honest, compassionate President for ALL of America!!! Your self serving , GRIFTING, CORRUPT father that cares about himself.   He could care less about the public.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
That's promising but not exactly true.  If Biden wins, Trump's version of America will simply slither into the shadows.
Let me get this straight we will be Nazis if Biden becomes President, I think she might be wrong on that score she is the one that is the Nazi and Trump is our President and has over 145,000 people who have died during this pandemic failed to act.
People do and still support trump, even though it's against their best interests. Unless we all vote for Biden he will win. This is the choice we have as citizens of the USA. Its Trump or Biden.
I keep telling everyone trump will win this election if everyone doesn't vote for Biden. We have to vote for the only candidate available to beat him.
I can agree with all of that completely. Joe Biden is just so bad to me as well, I’m gonna have a hard time filling out that ballot.
#risingqs Will Republican senators, aware their Senate majority may be toast in a Biden landslide, try to push the President out of the White House and off Twitter? Will Trump resign in time for the Republicans to prevent a one-party government? What does Trump want to disappear?
Two reasons cited by the largest police union in MI for backing Trump: Biden wants to defund police. Not true. The President lets them buy surplus Military equipment. That’s just fucking great!!! What about our Country?
No Nancy you and chuck take the award of biggest failure along with Obama and Biden. Resign now
Who cares it's the same s*** everyday more lies more hatred more finger-pointing and blaming the other guy. More bullying  more whining about how bad you've been treated. And how terrible Joe Biden is. Amore singing your own praise even though you haven't done a damn thing
You’re on same meds as Biden
Who is the president? Biden or Trump?
You have this Conservatives support. I'm  on your side 24/7. You are busy fighting the cultural wars and radical feminism on YouTube. And for that I applaud you. Glad that you think that Biden is a jerk. He's senile and should've been retired.

Am I the only one that gets super uncomfortable watching Biden talk? I have to turn away.  It’s sad.
It would be nice if there was a little less Trump and a bit more Biden so we could learn about Bidens Economic Plan.
lft Biden boys only
Kamala Harris has already proven to be a hypocrite when it comes to Joe Biden’s past racism and her own support of the horrendous criminal justice system in the U.S.. This hypocrisy when it comes to sexism should come at no surprise.
Why don't you handled the health crisis and pandemics as fast as you handle this. No one wants you in their cities that's what the National Guard is for. You do everything you can to create havoc in this country and nothing to unite us. Can't wait for you to go away. Biden 2020.
So Trump protecting federal property is the same thing as Biden enforcing a mask mandate? You sound very Jennifer Rubin-esque so far today.
Yes Biden has Alzheimer’slying about what a Biden Presidency would be like with law enforcement behind him! It’s another signal to police to attack peaceful protesters and “not be so nice” to them. He’s a domestic terrorist. He wants everyone attacking each other. He’s the devil!
Joe Biden asked to comment:  "2020 could have been A LOT worse."
Same as Joe Biden's.
Former Vice President Joe Biden has won the general election endorsement of the Michigan People's Campaign, a progressive group that backed Bernie Sanders in the primary:
Trump’s absence in the summer comes as a series of polls show Biden leading in Michigan. Trump's organizers in told me this doesn't mean they are pulling out. In fact, they're making big investments in the ground operation.
I’m a mom, and I’m for Biden. Go away
Trump’s absence in the summer comes as a series of polls show Biden leading in Michigan. The Trump campaign reportedly canceled its national ad program in order to review its messaging strategy.  However, Trump reserved $11.4M in TV ads from September through Nov. 3.
Presidential campaigns and PACs supporting them spent $52M to reserve television ads in Michigan, according to data shared by    Trump and Biden already spent more on TV ads in Michigan than the candidates in 2016.

You can make fun of mentally challenged people all you want but a lot of people are voting for Biden only because trump is such a huge threat to democracy.
Maybe your husband has contracted to same Virus attitude that I have?  I'd rather die of COVID-19 than watch the Biden-Obama Cult and their "Squad-infested" #NewLeft take control of our National Security, including Internal Security.  Sad but true 4 me; had enough B💩
The more closely Biden’s record is examined, the more ‘problematic’ it becomes for the Dem machine 🧐🐲🧐

You perfectly described trump there. Whereas Biden’s donors tell him what to believe not people on the left. Biden is going to be another standard corporate democrat just like Obama and Hillary.
Well 1. Biden isn’t a boomer. He’s older.  And 2. I edit. Say anything political. I have an example of someone near Biden’s age that also figured it out.
Trump figured it out and he’s not as smart as Biden. I’m sure he will be fine.
All jokes aside, this is one of the things about a Joe Biden presidency that I am actually excited about
I love that all these Republication PAC commercials are really just projection.  They're like "Hey, Joe Biden lied once, 30 years ago. He _exaggerated_. Clearly not presidential material."  Meanwhile  on twitter yelling about mescaline and healing crystals.
Yall keep talking about Biden in the basement like we forgot #BunkerBabyTrump hid then lied about it.
It’s cute you think Biden is a leftist. I pegged him more as a moderate Republican myself. Especially how he agrees with a majority of Trump’s policies.
My goal is to remove Trump's 1000 judges via constitutional amendment. And of course many other elements as you are aware.   will still continue under Biden. My worry is that momentum will slow. Not that there's any now. More people are becoming ready, though.
In the first six months of the Biden Administration.
Kamala/Biden is a Republican ticket. That is two Republicans on a ticket.  Seeing what Dems have done since 2008 has made me realize that America has two factions of a fundamentally conservative party.  GOP are right-wing reactionary. Dems are centrist/conservative.
96 days. Fight like Biden is behind. Crush Trump. Humiliate Trump. #EvictTrump
Yes, but  is in the top ten for worst Governors. Trump signs in Michigan outnumber Biden 8-1 state wide. She a 1 term Governor, voted in only because legalization of Marijuana was on the ballot, so she was voted in by pot heads!  We know they won't vote the next round.
We are starting to see who will be advising  due to his current status. Obama will be in the background trying to reinstall all his job killing policies. If Biden wins, I'm going to laugh at all of you who voted for him as you lose your jobs. Trump 2020!
Not sure if this is a subtweet of the other thread going on, but regardless, who is claiming that Biden's plan does not include the substantive influence of GND?  I think we can celebrate the clear influence of GND without saying that Biden's plan = GND in its totality
If we're looking not at the GND resolution, but the broader discourse and academic work that has developed around the GND, one could identify other missing links from Biden's plan too. I limited my list here to the reso
If you're voting for Joe Biden because you do not like President Donald J. Trump, then that is like eating a dog turd because you do not like broccoli!   is nothing more than a puppet hiding in his basement doing a few cameos every now and then. He is a left wing puppet!

This raises the question -- can we describe generic green stimulus with EJ principles as "the start of a Green New Deal?" I see pros and cons to this approach.  But where we def agree is that the GND shouldn't be defined down to something equivalent to the Biden plan.
Why are you so desperate to excuse T’s rhetoric, and why do you think “Biden supporters” are the issue?
The fact that I just saw a woman say she hopes Biden doesn’t pick Warren for VP because she’s “too shrill” absolutely blows my mind. Have you MET her? The internalized misogyny is strong here, friends....
Gov. Whitmer is not on this list of 10 women.
This is about where I think it is. I don't think Biden has leads upwards of 8-10 points like some polls.
Please join Spartans for Biden on August 8th as we host  and  for a discussion of the 2020 election! We look forward to seeing you there!

Gosh? Obama? Hilary? Biden? Comey?
Man...if Joe Biden have a black woman running mate he def getting my vote lol
He can resign right after Obama, Biden, the Clinton’s and all the other pedophiles are in jail or executed
Tucker is simply magnificent.
While I don’t disagree, this makes me nostalgic for the Biden/Palin debate of 2008.
If it takes years to pull them out, Biden can reverse this dumbass decision as soon as he takes office.
Hmmmmm I must have missed when Biden became president...... during the riots and crime, who is the president? Who is sending these mercenaries into the cities uninvited?? Oh!! Daddy trump!!
I think Biden has a BLIND Twin Brother.  I think that I saw him on Columbo. 🙄

Ah yes, a vice president whose goal is to eventually become president themselves.  Sounds kind of like... *checks notes* Joe Biden. #2020Election
Sounds like theater—Harris is Biden’s natural successor (not a compliment)
Exactly, Biden will pick a wise choice he does not wan't a lap dog either but an asset in the White House.

Here's the  +  story today on the Trump campaign going quiet on the airwaves in the state:

Our government is a plutocracy  The cold reality is the Blue Team is not much different than the Red Team when you peal back the veneer  A Biden administration will do little to help the working class, look at Virginia for the blueprint of how the Democrats will run the country
Or for Biden to have some small gaffe that supposed "independents" or "undecideds" will use as cover to vote for Trump.  Anyone that claims to be undecided at this point actually supports Trump and just doesn't want to admit it.
“The clearest reason why the president is reeling in Michigan is because of his failed coronavirus response,” said Garlin Gilchrist, the state’s Democratic lieutenant governor.

Same. And earlier today when Biden said he believes in science, a sliver of hope. How comforting would it have been if we only had a leader who believed in it.
Now is not the time to chose a Vice Presidental candidate simply to make history. Considering Biden's age his choice is not just ornamental. We need someone who is knowledgeable in foreign policy and homeland disparities and not a symbol. It just seems prudent at this time
Again this year the American voters are stuck between dangerous and lest dangerous. Trump must be removed to preserve the foundation of Democracy and restore the faith of our allies in us. Biden's choice of a running mate will decide our future &amp; I am very concerned.
Biden’s green plan should have competition clause that encourages and promotes competition for electric battery development and car to prevent market monopoly. And allocate money for publicly operated charging station for all electric cars.

Just listened to an NPR reporter say “as the Trump Administration has used the Goya fallout to organize around Latinx voters, the Biden campaign has used the fallout from Covid to connect with the community” and that’s really this election in a nutshell.
I'm voting for Trump.  Not because Biden is that bad.  But because Trump is THAT good!! #MAGA #Trump2020 🇺🇸
It's hard to imagine anything having a worse outcome than a binary choice between Trump and Biden, and this way we all get to eat ice cream.

Everyone stop calling them "centrist" Dems.  They are *conservative* Dems. Trump has made them move to the right.  #ConservativeDems are going to make Biden lose in November.
Joe Biden might have won by supporting M4A. It would have solidified the Bernie base without losing a single conservative Dem.  Joe Biden may well lose because he rejected M4A. It's a terrible look for conservative Dems to compromise with the GOP voter base rather than Berners!
You know as well as everyone else knows. Biden is worthless. A lifetime in congress and accomplished zip. So vote for Biden but when Trump is re-elected stay the hell out of the way if all your gonna do is cry, or find some common ground and accomplish something.
The Biden campaign's strategy seems to be "Let Trump talk." And why not? Biden's up in the polls assuming you believe them after 2016.
Well you see, the Mueller report is gospel to them. Doesn’t matter what these declassified documents tell us. If Obama and Biden say something is so, then who are we to question it?

My father brought up who Biden should select as his running mate, and I found myself saying that I don’t know who the VP pick should be because I don’t understand people who might not avail themselves of the chance to vote out T-rump any better than I do those who’d vote for him.

At this point the MiniTru has enough newspeak experience to spin this word salad into any definition you can imagine.   I will guarantee you that somewhere out there is an NPC who both identifies as a 'Fascist Societarian Leftist' and is voting for Biden.

My money has gone to   and local progressive races. Biden can have my vote but he won’t get my money. The DNC is hoping hate for Trump will be greater than MAGA supporters love of Trump, and that’s a risky gamble.

Sorry but here in Michigan I think I have seen two Biden signs if that...Trump signs are everywhere!
This guy is going to WONDER why Biden is going to lose.  How about you stop yapping and just admit Biden isn't well-liked but you're going to vote for him anyway?  And you have to *hope* that Trump's people don't pull more voter suppression.  Too bad u didn't care in the primary!
*Those* are *not* the facts.  Voter suppression via closed polling places is a fact.  Hillary getting a debate Q from Donna - and also billions in free air time - is a fact.  Media manipulating for Biden after SC and 2 candidates dropping out in 24 hours -  is a fact.
Bernie was always going to be the perfect candidate. In 2016, and again today.  In a moment of Black Lives Matter - Joe Biden is a guy who eulogized a segregationist.  When M4A is more needed than ever - Biden threatened to veto if he got it.  Biden is a conservative.

On the campaign trail, Bill Clinton cited Pres Bush’s broken “Read my lips: No new taxes” promise from 4yrs earlier, helping Clinton win the 1992 election.  It was a clear, straightforward, effective message.  Biden should simply ask:  Is America greater than it was 4yrs ago?

Biden will say occasional stupid stuff.  He has done this his entire career.  The big difference: he will usually quickly admit his mistakes and learn from them.
Is he actually trying to imply that Obama secretly does not support Joe Biden?
Joe Biden will “be able to reassemble the kind of government that cares about people and brings people together.”  That’s exactly what this election is about.
Lol no one is going to vote for Biden. He will have a “medical condition “ and drop out the race.
I don’t know what Biden could do that’s worse for our democracy than sending federal troops to arrest protesters. Biden is terrible but trump is more of an existential threat to our democracy and that is my reasoning. Could we get a worse trump in 2024, maybe.
I misinterpreted this tweet; the photo is from when President Obama and Vice President Biden were still in office. Thanks for the correction,

The Biden bot is glitching again.
Do you agree that it is ok to criticize Biden. I’m not sure which side you’re falling on here.
I know, people expecting us to pretend that a candidate is great when they’re not. Trump is the more immediate threat and that’s why I’m voting for Biden.
I’ll vote for Biden but I’m not going to tell people how great he is because I don’t think he is. It’s not enough for us to vote for Biden apparently, they also expect us to evangelize for him. The reason I give for voting for Biden is that trump is a more immediate threat.

I mean this whole settling for less shit isn’t going to cut it everybody should be demanding that Biden and his team do better do something more beyond just giving us a story or a vague speech.
“With his dying breath he said, tell Obama to use my funeral for Biden’s campaign! Biden for president”🙄

I NEVER thought I'd say this but. Joe Biden was RIGHT!!!  😅😂😆  #YouAintBlack #blackface #ObaMAGAate #KAG2020 #JoeBidenIsARacist #ObamaWasBetterAtEverything Including Blackface!
Joe Biden say that we have a "crimate clises".  I think he's right...
Nah...he was allowed to say yes or no,they only gave him yes or no questions and refused to allow him to bullshit. Get used to it,after Biden wins there's going to be a whole bunch more questions...
Biden is like we need to grow and open the country well then if he believes that why is he against pushing and fighting for basic fucking needs like housing, healthcare, canceling student loans, etc etc?
I'm going to level with you in this. Biden was not my 1st, 2nd, or even 4th choice, but he's the nominee. I will not only HAPPILY and ENTHUSIASTICALLY vote for Biden, but I will continue to share and donate and do whatever I can to help ensure he is elected
Joe Biden is not the answer to any of the problems that we as a country face today.
This shit is just sad this lady obviously has issues and is all over the place I noticed that on her IG.  This is why It was crazy seeing people canceling Buttar without hearing out the whole story all while Khive and Biden supporters who talked so much
Absolutely correct. Biden nerds to hammer 🔨 that home. We've either lost a Family member  or we know someone who's died. This isn't a joke. This guy is still golfing it off, as if it will go away. Sick!
Joe Biden says we're having a "crimate clises".  I think he's right...
When you do voting to that extent, you're gonna find more leftists, you're gonna find more Biden, SO I SAY TO MY PEOPLE "SLOW THE MAILING DOWN PLEASE!"
Rioters and Looters for Biden.
Can you picture Joe Biden doing the state of the union address? 😂
News Flash!!!!!! More people are following Trump than Biden.
Follow along..... If hydroxichloroquin treats corona there’s no panic. If there’s no panic Americans go back to normal life. If Americans go back to normal life no mail in ballots. If there’s no mail in ballots Dems can’t cheat. If Dems can’t cheat Trump will crush Biden.  Simple
According to #Democrat  women can not succeed unless he is elected President   #tcot #gop #migop
I can't even believe I am engaging you. Biden can complete sentences far better than your man can, put them side by side and watch. Pedophile background? Sthu. That is a lie.  Goodbye  back into your conspiracy theory room.
That Instagram account for Biden I have a feeling is run by Warren people.
Are people supposed to ignore that Biden is doing very little to earn their vote are they supposed to ignore thar the party just voted down on progressive policies like M4A, legalizing marijuana and against Palestine. I mean seriously do they think people are this naive?
Settle for Biden is a joke. Gtfoh. The instagram is ridiculous who is this made for how does this make Biden appealing knowing that he won’t even support progressive policies.
No Biden will look foolish.
Why use photoshopped pictures of Joe Biden being a creep when there's already a bunch of actual pictures/videos of him being a creep?
President Trump comes up with these nicknames for his opponents. Sleepy Joe Biden, Crooked Hillary Clinton ,lying Ted Cruz. What does he call himself?Dandy Don?
Wow they are really desperate to get people to vote for Biden knowing he is a fucking disaster.
Biden is in no way a fucking leftist you fucking clown.
If your a Biden supporter your a  pedophile.
Bernie really should stop defending the party after all the shit they did to him and honestly fuck Biden Obama and the DNC for ruining this election.
He is all talk. Biden’s basement buddy
We have to fight up till election day like Biden is 20 points behind. Complacency is what cost Clinton the last election. Let's not repeat history. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica

Joe Biden says that we have a "crimate clises".  I think he's right...
The country currently faces many problems...and Joe Biden isn't the answer to any of them.
Joe Biden is about as radical as white bread.
Joe Biden is about as radical as unflavoured,oatmeal.
Joe Biden is about as radical,as vanilla ice cream.
Ha!  Those are Joe Biden rallies going on in Portland, OR and Seattle!  I didn't know that!
Also, much respect for you and your beliefs . I also noticed the above comment and that you follow DJT but not Biden. Just curious as to why.
Biden ads say he's going to "Restore the middle class" but, seriously, what does that even mean? It's just as nonsensical as "Make America great again." So much meaningless rhetoric, yet people eat it up like free shrimp during happy hour.
Look around you. There's nothing Biden can do yet
Biden and the Dems have a plan to set us back instead of moving forward and actually doing something for this planet and its people.
Thanks. I'm with you. I'd hoped for someone else but it's the hand we're dealt. We can deal with 4 years of Biden but we won't survive 4 more years of this.
Let's get this straight. I'm not in love with Biden any more than I was with Hillary but I would literally vote for a block of cheese before I would EVER vote for Trump and not voting is not an option. Even if trump were a good president(he's not), he's exhausting.
Nadler is a complete baffoon. Law and order, Dems don't want it and are willing to let law abiding citizens suffer just to get rid of Trump, enjoy your shitty utopia if Biden gets in, you'll regret it about 2 years in...
I really like Duckworth. I feel like Rice, like it or not, will have the stupid unmasking baggage.  I’m a bit more excited for who Biden’s AG will be. They’ll be busy day 1.
Not my reasons but, I guess it’s his reason and unless Biden wins, it’s still a free country!
I'm not a big fan of Donald Trump as President...but I do know this...the answer to any problem we are facing as a country is not Joe Biden.
According to Joe Biden we have a "crimate clises".  I think he's right...
Kind of like Joe Biden telling that black guy that he's not really black.  Welcome to Woke America 2020 where things only make sense if you smoke enough crack.
UNBELIEVABLE isn't it. Besides Repunlican questions did Barr ever anwser a dem ? They cut him short. This was about Trump, almost like a campaign rally for Biden
I guess if Biden started calling Covid a hoax I might just let the chips fall where they may, but I probably wouldn’t vote, I don’t think I could vote for Trump.
Sounds like real bullets will have to do. Joe Biden’s idea for police reform was to shoot for the legs right?
Joe Biden is as far left as Calvin Coolidge.Stop panicking and take your  good for you.
It’s astonishing that his supporters don’t see that.   Like when the Trump campaign runs video of riots and looting in the streets and claims that this will be Biden’s America when the video is literally of Trump’s America!  What is wrong with these people?!
Well if Biden becomes president remember you said "No thank you!" Pack up and move!! Just remember you are a puppet too then!!
Biden is the Houston Astros of politics, he can only hit when he knows which pitch is coming next and they haven’t found a way to extort Chris Wallace into letting Biden’s team provide the questions for another fake interview.
Biden wouldn’t do your interview unless he’s allowed to provide you with the questions. He can’t hit the curve and the only way he can get to first base is if he gets hit by a pitch.
Joe biden even said we will have to remove trump by force.
Biden can even finish a coherent sentence. How is he going to run the country? How many years has he been in office, and what has he done for minorities? The first black president had done less than the current president for black people. Sounds like a no brainer.
What they need to do to Replace Biden with Bernie.
Like I said Bernie did a mistake dropping out. Biden played everybody with this task force shit it was mostly for show in order to get Bernie supporters to vote for him. Biden is garbage and so is the DNC.
And like the Republican party the    does not care about the people of this country. This is why I will not be voting for neither party in November just voting in August locally but fuck Biden and the DNC.
1000 people die a day in the US from Covid 19. 1660 a day from Cancer, 2353 a day from Heart Disease. Last winter 24,000-62,000 died in the US from the flu. Every 4 minutes someone in the US dies of a stroke. These numbers don’t scare me. Joe Biden in the White House does.
Because it’s not helpful and shows little of the reality of our political landscape. Biden will spend 4 years restoring calm and training his replacement. The VP choice is extremely important this time.
I hope V P Biden tears it down when he becomes president.
Not uneducated nor am I manipulated by CNN. Americans know this election is all about socialism vs capitalism !  Joe Biden is a democratic  puppet suffering from dementia!
I hope but nothing happened to little Bush and Cheney or the assholes that crashed the economy in 08 so I'm very skeptical. I don't see Biden going down that road. He's gonna try to "UNITE" the country. Good luck with that.
We all watched it live, we know he lied. We’re more worried about when(but really if) there will be consequences.  If the answer is Jan. 2021 under the Biden administration, whoa boy are Republicans in for a doozy.
Yeah, no Biden or Trump signs on my lawn but don’t get it twisted, I’ll be voting blue down the ticket.
Another custom design. This one for supporters of the Blue Wave movement. Vote Blue No Matter Who Wave T-Shirt  #BlueWave2020 #BlueWave #biden #vote
You need to put Joe Biden's head on the guy who released the eagle...with a November 4th date!
I think you mean Joe Biden has never quit profiting off Americans.... Trump is the only one fighting for Americans...
It shouldn’t make me emotional when a conservative comes out in support of Biden, but this is how far Republicans have fallen.  There’s a grim fate for those in the GOP who went all in for their power grab.
What a wuss.  I bet Biden takes that down 1st thing.  What scares me is we get to see all these things happening and our hands are tied.
This confuses and upsets me every day. We don't need to follow that idiot to see his tweets. Why give him the satisfaction of following? Not following Biden kills me!!
Then why not spy on Biden's campaign. Oh, I forgot. He's barricaded in his Bunker Basement. Wonder if Archie is there with him?
"This Short Video Exposes Everything That Is Wrong With Biden's Green New Deal"  #news #feedly

Stay away from Biden, it's obviously catchy
Weekend at Bernies Biden edition
He's lost Florida. He's completely f*cked😁👏🏿👏🏽👏🏻 #FloridaPoll "(CNN)Poll of the week: A new CNN/SSRS poll finds that former Vice President Joe Biden leads in the state of Florida by a 51% to 46% margin over President Donald Trump among registered voters."
Its everywhere google biden saying they will remove trump by force because he wont accept a biden win. Pelosi has said it many have said it
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Yup. The thing with Biden is that Biden has had no plan to move to the left the only reason he did the whole Bernie task force was basically to get voters and for show.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Hey. Whatever works.  All I know is Joe Biden isn't the answer to any question whatsoever.
We need real American-bull dog journalists working for us instead against us. How do we get some freedom loving patriots in front row seats at these WH press briefings and in the faces of Pelosi/Biden/Schiff &amp; co. that will ask real questions that actually pressure them to help?
“Joe Biden supports closed borders” I just cackled
If it comes out from the pentagon we just found proof of aliens / off world vehicles in  Antarctica... would trust Deep State Biden the basement puppet or PRESIDENT DONALD J TRUMP to disclose what’s really going on?   Not even close!!! 🧨💥  🇺🇸👽TRUMP 2020!👽🇺🇸
Of course you are! How else are you gonna convince us there’s a big second wave that will keep our economy closed, keep Biden hidden in the basement, stop Trump from campaigning, and use mail in voting to cheat your way into whatever job you traded your integrity away for? LOSER!
Biden also didn't sexually assault his daughter, Ivanka. "If she weren't my daughter, I'd be dating her". Who's the pedophile again?
It's not Biden accused by 25 women of sexual assault. It's not Biden that would walk in the dressing room at the Miss Teen America pageants. It's not Biden that was best buds with Jeffrey Epstein. It's not Biden that had Russian hookers give him a golden shower.
Seeing Obama/biden selling out to China...wanting America to b a socialist 3rd world shit hole...demoncrats calling feds protecting federal buildings  from anarchists (not peaceful protestors) "storm troopers" ? ..now...that's sad...I'm sure u agree
I'm so tired of hearing about what the F Obama and Biden did.  Please focus on the important stuff.  Maybe you should focus on being a great President maybe people would take you more seriously.
Can Martha fucking Ford sell the lions. Why the hell is joe Biden’s illiterate sister running an NFL team. Assembly lines don’t translate to football.
This is why this country is stuck we could do better but nope they gave us Biden vs Trump. What a fucking nightmare.
Honestly The whole Biden/Obama team up is such bullshit makes me so fucking angry because we should be moving forward but nope we got to go back to the Obama years instead of moving forward and this is who they want me to vote for absolutely fucking not.
Is Obama his fucking adviser what is this shit why is Biden so desperate to go back to how shit was during the Obama years how the fuck is that progress Obama promised a lot and could not get a lot of shit passed cause the Republicans stood in the way and because Obama did not
Joe Biden’s platform: I can say racist things and get away with it. I can assault Tara Reade and get away with it. I can be losing my mental capacities but it does not matter. I have the media in my back pocket.
#DHS Also just legally put in writing, they lied re: NY Immigrant transit. This admin is NOT to be trusted with a shoe👟, let alone an entire human being😡😤.
We MUST keep track of them. Look at all the #KidsInCages they have lost😤. Or offended upon while being dragged maliciously away, or in supposed #FederalCustody.
When do Republicans stop relying on being gaslit?  Seriously, his suggestion to convince someone to vote for Biden is to make them afraid of someone else. That’s all Republicans have anymore.
Telling rich donors nothing will fundamentally change. #JoeBidenJob
What is this how the fuck does this make Biden appealing?
It’s so weird all the criticisms laid at Biden seem to mostly ring true for Trump and his ilk. Could it be projection? 😉
They're accusing the wrong person. Sounds like Obama and Biden instigate and propagated destruction with no apologies
Biden has slipped. Ok he's almost 80. You'll slip, I'll slip, we'll all slip. Mango Mussolini hasn't slipped, he's always been a fraud and a basket case. My dog ( an Aussie) is way more intelligent and more COGNITIVE. Maybe I'll have her primary your dear leader.
I choose to avoid anything commenting on Biden's mental state as much of it is just mean-spirited. There are 40+ years of documented politicial baggage showing why he should not be president.
Biden's showing signs of dementia? Have ya listened to your dear leaders nonsensical, argel bargel, word salads. Yea, nothing says mental acuity like talking about ingesting Lysol or sticking an infrared light up your ass but you stick with that. Ya no his dad died of Alzheimer's
Dream on. Biden may end up with 400 of those stupid electoral college votes especially with Obama campaigning for him.
I couldn't care less if Biden takes a nap for 4 years. At least he'll put competent people in his administration. He won't put "Joe the plumber" as his secretary of defense or "light fingers Louie" as his Attorney General.
Atka passed the mental acuity test ⁦ took. We have found Biden’s running mate. ⁦
Biden training our furture
I'll vote Biden over SpongeBlob. It's the only responsible thing to do. We only gotta put up with Biden for 4 years. How long has SpongeBlob been presidunce? Seems like 40 years.
A vote for Biden,is a vote for your children.
Yeah when push comes to shove, no generals are gonna be like, hmm I could just keep being a general under Joe Biden but I think I'll do treason to keep the fat baby around
Like when the House certifies that Joe Biden won the election, who actually stops Joe Biden from becoming president?
The only Trump paths to victory that I hear anymore are one of the following:  What if Joe Biden does something really dumb? What if the polls are all lies? What if Trump rigs/cancels the election?
Biden can’t think for himself so whom are you voting for you don’t know?
Only because he has Dementia and you won’t know who running the country Biden don’t know where he at half the time. And all the satanic rituals that Hollywood does and your following that. Human trafficking,drug trafficking and your following Hollywood.
Ghislaine is going to implicate,the Biden’s.
Make no mistake, "liberals" who think protestors need to go home now are just scared of the fact that the poor and marginalized might continue to have power and make demands even when Biden is president.
Joe Biden in one of his Ads says “Keep your Distance”. Does this mean stay in your basement? 🙄
Worse. Unlike Obama in 2008, Biden is a 40+ year Washington insider.  He may say this, but he'll do that.
Joe Biden = Socialism.  Donald Trump = Free Economic Society Choose wisely! Trump 2020 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸If there is no election,  then the presidency will be open and the Speaker of the House becomes the president. There is no requirement the speaker be a member of the House. The dems could chose Biden.
Anyone fooled by #traitor tot is seriously delusional!  This is #TrumpsAmerica   Not Biden’s. You are a byproduct of your damaged fathers need to win at all costs. I read the book.
Patience my friend.  When Biden's VP candidate is ready to assume control next January all this will evaporate.
In 2009 the unemployment rate was 9.9%.  In 2016 it was 4.7%, a reduction of over 50%.  During the last 3 years of Obama / Biden the US economy added more jobs than the first 3 years of Trump (even before the virus).
I have faith in the men and women of our military.  And I think it might be the Secret Service who would drag Trump out of the WH, part of their job in protecting Pres Biden.
Biden quote:  ““Mark my words I think he [Trump] is gonna try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can’t be held.”  Turley, you are an embarrassment.
Biden could not recite a policy off a cue card.
Please let’s hope she does, it might be a faster exit for both Biden and her.
It will be ready for Biden.
Biden Is Right. Pay for Home Health Workers Is Paltry.
VP PICK DOES NOT MATTER AS OLD JOE IS  IN DEEP TROUBLE AS DIMINISHED MENTAL AQUITY EVIDENT. YIKES 😬
Do you usually demean African American female doctors? Or is this just you following Biden's lead?
“The former vice president went on to condemn police officers who have been on duty during the protests, saying it is unacceptable “for our police — sworn to protect and serve all people — to escalate tensions or resort to excessive violence.”
Our Democratic Value - empathy - we care for each other.  Joe Biden cares for his family and for ours. That's what we need from a President during this crisis. #JoeBiden2020
The only way Biden and the Communist Democrats are going to win is if they cheat YUGELY!  This has to be prevented!

Yeah! I like how he's telling everyone to wear masks in the video below, but do you see him or any of staff wearing masks? 🤔
Can you link something from Biden laying this out?  Quite sure he’s said on the record he will not end fracking.
Every time Joe Biden takes his mask off, he looks like a dotering old fool!!!
We need  as President to rebuild our economy better than it was before.  We need good jobs with living wages, healthcare for all and strong public schools.  President Joe Biden will deliver for America because he cares. #JoeBiden2020
Joe Biden slams President Trump’s coronavirus response | WNT  via
First Trump-Biden debate shifts to Cleveland after Notre Dame backs out
This one will likely endure. There is a real connection between Joe Biden and Susan Rice that is rooted in their service together in the Obama Administration as VP and National Security Advisor, respectively. This should not be dismissed.
We have to do two things. First we must get 45 out for good, then we have to create a new left wing people’s party. The DNC beltway folks want, like  Biden, for everything to stay pretty much the same.
Yes indeed.  Vote Biden.
He can do it closer to the debates or after if he needs the attention back on him but would be silly to do that interview just because the president did when you’re in the position Biden is in this race. He should still be out there doing press but this one can wait.
What benefit does Biden have to doing that interview right now?
POLLS?? JUST ASK BENGHAZI HILLARY LOL  THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR YOUR SINCERE COMPASSION AND STRONG POSITIVE LEADERSHIP 🙏
How long y’all think it takes Biden’s people to make a commercial?  Dude misspeaks 3 out of 5 words.
Biden: “I’m about thing that helps our great country of Canada be good.  Looting and rioting is a privilege and should not be stopped by the evil white people of our great country of Uganda.  Ask not what your country can do for you, but what flavor Skittles are the best.”
Joe Biden is the President we need. #VoteJoeBiden2020
She became the National Security Advisor as a consolation prize. Amb. Rice is 55, SUPER-SMART AND POISED! Everything about her is impressive! She meets the "Ready to be President" on Day 1 better than anyone else under consideration, and personal relationship matters to Joe Biden
Unlike popular opinion, I believe the inside track goes to Susan Rice. African-American, great foreign policy experience and she has a strong personal relationship with Joe Biden. Downside: Repubs will scream "Benghazi" which is how they blocked her from being Secretary of State.
She is a solid Congresswoman from California, who doesn't have a national profile and would have a steep learning curve. She is 65 and doesn't meet the criteria of a bridge to the next generation. Biden is likely looking at three women: Susan Rice, Kamala Harris, Tammy Duckworth.
This virus is tough, but we will fight this together and emerge strong.  Joe Biden is the President we need. #VoteJoeBiden2020
VP Biden is following a wise, old political maxim:    When your opponent is destroying himself, don’t interrupt.  stay safe
Ask him everyday else he might forget.. ole senile fart that Biden is
Oh.. don’t forget u DID interview Trump at factory tour? Biden has refused your interview?
White Flight From Trump? What a Decisive Biden Win Could Look Like
If it’s in the platform Biden will just ignore it. Candidates usually do ignore the platform.
And things will get infinitely worse if Biden wins.  The Dem party's power depends on sustaining an economic dependency by a majority of the voters. They have already bolstered this support among African Americans by destroying their local economies with these COVID shutdowns.
This is such ridiculous fear mongering.  In Biden’s America my ass.  In trump’s America that lady would be dead from coronavirus because he hasn’t done anything about it, sorry he has - He’s done everything to make it worse than it ever had to be.
BIASED CNN POLLS?? JUST ASK BENGHAZI HILLARY LOL  TRUMP ROCKS AMERICA FIRST THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT 🙏   News: Biden tops Trump in CNN polls for Michigan, Florida, Arizona
NO, that's not why. We all know the real reason why.
Biden leads in Michigan and Trump has one-point edge in Ohio  Blah, blah, freaking blah blah blah. Is everyone's memory as short as my ex's dick? Didn't we go through this the whole year of 2016? All that counts is happens on Nov 3.
So, the Biden campaign should not be complacent.  Still, Trump will not have the economy or a Reagan to lean on.  A “no new tax” pledge in the face of soaring deficits (and following a huge tax cut for the wealthy) may not appeal.  Smearing VP Biden will be all he has.
You already sent this tweet, do you have dementia like Biden?
“In the past week... [Trump] has accused Obama of treason, called his own niece a criminal, &amp; asserted that Biden wants to abolish — deep breath — the police, Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement, bail system, the 2nd amendment, &amp; intriguingly, the suburbs.”
I’m voting for Joe Biden for president because I am a woman, a member of the LGBTQ+ community, the daughter of two immigrants. I’m voting for him because I want bold, progressive action on climate change.
You know, the S&amp;P 500 rose 13.8% per annum while Biden was VP.  Just sayin’.  stay safe

I will be a good American and supporter of the Constitution and vote for Biden despite the fact that I do not support his policies and question his abilities now.
Joe Biden’s potential running mates, in their own words
True or false Biden should campaign like they do exist.  For the record think that was extremely detailed and helpful in learning about it.
Foreign policy was the biggest failure of Obama’s presidency.  Why would you want to draw attention to that in your campaign if you’re Biden.  Not only should he steer clear of Rice as his VP he should steer clear of others that served as part of the Obama foreign policy team.
Anyone they chose will have flaws, the only argument Trump has is that Biden is anti police and he’s law and order which is why Trumps goons are instigating shit across the country.  If your running mate is a former Chief of Police that cuts the legs out from Trumps main attack.
I would not for Biden if you paid me. You don’t actually believe this do you. A front? Most of us don’t fly banners because we don’t want our house burned down by the left. Come Nov you will see.  Biden. Bahahaha
Any vote that is not for Biden is a waste!

Yep, taking my chances survivin’ and ridin’ with Biden here in the burbs of the Mitten.
I saw a Biden lawn sign today in Novi, Michigan, probably by someone who works in a memory care facility.
I don’t think Trump is trampling over our constitution. He has appointed strong constitutional judges and supports our rights to bear arms. Biden would shred the constitution. He’s openly anti 2A.
If Biden wins FL Trump’s path to re-election is vanishingly slim.  Trump would have to carry every swing state he won in 2016.  That includes MI, WI, PA, AZ.  Biden is ahead in the polls in all four.  stay safe
If you’re talking about the oath to protect and defend the constitution of the USA, I never forgot it. I’m sure you’re asking me this because I’m voting for Trump over Biden. Easy choice for me.
I hear you. The Q people miss how the swamp covers anyone of power in these times, bipartisan child molesters or blackmailed on video. We have to free ourselves. Heck, Trump would vax us to death w/military force! What are these pro-MATAs thinking?! Tho he's better than Biden.
You are absolutely making it up about anyone from the Biden campaign contacting you. Like you would have any reservation about outing someone by name.
Did Biden accidentally a good persuasion here? Everyone is attacking "first" and as a result their brains are accepting the "racist" part?
ME AT WORK TODAY PROBABLY: CAN I COUNT ON YOU TO VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN THIS NOVEMBER AND ALSO PURCHASE TAYLOR SWIFT’S NEW ALBUM TONIGHT?
It’s clearly an incorrect statement by VP Biden.  But note how everyone is focused on the “FIRST racist President” part.
Biden says Trump is first racist U.S. president  Except for the OTHER 12 Presidents THAT OWNED SLAVES: Washington, Jefferson,  Madison,  Monroe, Jackson, Van Buren,  Harrison, Tyler, Polk, Taylor, Andrew Johnson, and Grant! Facts are such pesky bastards.Yes yes Biden equals socialism and communism poverty and violence and terrorism
Another Biden nut case!
Trump may have a leg drop but he can complete sentences.  Biden in one rally last year forgot what office he was running for.  He shows signs of dementia he’s almost 80.
Biden versus Trump. Some speculate that the future of the republic hinges on the outcome of the next election. But for smart investors it doesn't really matter who wins.

The argument against Harris is that she was a terrible primary candidate, did no homework on health care, CA is not a swing state and Senate Democrats have been absolutely useless in pandemic.  Biden needs a virus fighter like Whitmer of MI.
Biden will undo this on day one.
I’m attending Joe Biden for President’s event, “Racial Equity Roundtable with Ashley Biden and Michigan Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II” – sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
All he needs is a harmonica
⁦ Shit, is this right?  That Biden will likely end up enjoined from any attempt to grant new DACA applications?
LOL. No Biden will not do that.  Please don’t tell me that you think your supporters are so stupid as to believe these lies. How disrespectful you are. What they should believe is: #TrumpDeathCount150000 #TrumpPandemicFailure
There is really no choice, I will be voting for Biden. I can’t handle another 4 years of Trump!
How come no presidential candidate offers a solution to reduce our addiction to cars? Biden's proposed support for EVs sounds enviro-friendly, but doesn't deal with traffic congestion or pedestrian/bicycle safety. Trump wants us all driving Buicks from the 50s.
Biden is Deep State in disguise
I think it’ll be Kamala Harris or Susan Rice. Who do you think it will be? “Biden says he will pick running mate by end of next week” #vppick #vp #JoeBiden #Biden2020
Is Biden going to pick #HeelsUpHarris for his flunkie?
You should have called and I could have driven with my new Biden Bumper sticker.
Here’s the thing. If Trump wins in November I’ll be bereft because I apparently don’t understand my fellow Americans. Again. But I’ll accept it. If Biden wins and Trump refuses to leave office, I’ll probably lose my mind. And move to France. If they’ll take me.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot  IT IS TIME TO FLUSH THE TURD #TrumpMustGo #FlushTheTurdNov3rd
Joe Biden's speech right now about his platform is so excellent.  Clear and coherent.  And the subject Build Back Better plan is even better.
Biden yellingat
after the events of the past week or so I'm grateful that Biden gave me his blessings to vote for someone else
is barely 4 years in politics and get to blamed for all American problems accumulated in half century. Joe Biden is half century in politics and only get to blamed why he’s not defeating  #TheGreatAwakeningWorldwide
Well thanks for supporting Biden. We need to take this country back. Get things settled down. Clear out the Senate... Then start working on universal health insurance/care. Get Covid-19 under control. Start holding business and citizens accountable. Rebuild public education.
Michigan Voter for Biden.  #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica  #Biden2020
True Christians are Pro-Life!! So disappointed you’re voting for a senile pro-choice candidate-Biden😖. Rethink your liberal views. I started to respect you and now I don’t!
All I want for Christmas is a Biden WIN !!
You have it right Charlie! That’s why I’m voting For Donald Trump and I have loads of people gathering together on voting for him!We can’t take 4 years of Joe Biden!
Jeezus.  Joe Biden is going to have so much cleaning up to do IMMEDIATELY.  I hope he's keeping a list (a very long list).
To give Oboma little boys and Biden little girls with clean hair to smell and touch.
Integralists for Biden, explain??
Harris was totally unprepared for her primary run. She never figured out a position on health care.  As a Senate Democrat, she has been useless in the pandemic. Biden needs a virus fighter like Whitmer of Michigan.
Ladies and gentlemen the next President and First Lady of the United States, Joe &amp; Jill Biden
Narrowing the field to black women democrats is typical Biden bull.
He’s a RINO if he supports Biden
Because he's Joe Biden, and that's literally what he does? Why are you surprised?
Can’t wait to hear Biden say:  “TEAR DOWN THAT WALL”
Tucker Carlson is warning America that if Joe Biden wins Donald Trump's America will no longer exist.
realDonaldTrump: There is NO WAY a place like Pennsylvania can vote for the Radical Left and their puppet, Joe Biden, when they are against fracking, steel production, and just about everything else that Pennsylvania stands for. Likewise, Texas, and many other states!!!
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
realDonaldTrump: The Trump Campaign has more ENTHUSIASM, according to many, than any campaign in the history of our great Country - Even more than 2016. Biden has NONE! The Silent Majority will speak on NOVEMBER THIRD!!! Fake Suppression Polls &amp; Fake News will not save the R…

Dignity. Truth. Respect. Honor. Biden.  What are your five words today?   #MasksIn5Words  #SaturdayMotivation  #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare  #personmanwomancameratv  #TrumpIsUnwell
So am I.  Even more, I am looking forward to kicking out the Trump Criminal Enterprise from the White House and see decency resorted with President Joe Biden.  #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020
who is this clueless loser Mo?  Watching him is like listening to the Counterfeit News Network.  Nothing but lies and fake news.  A vote for Biden is for the end of our country.
Loved the most recent episode and very much believe these officers illegally kidnapping people should be prosecuted but is it really a good idea to force Biden to take a position on issues like this that can be twisted in Trump ads?  Don't want him to commit to no.
That is because Creepy, Sleepy Joe Biden can’t pass the test and you need to worry about yourself. Stay away, enjoy the time you have left as a free person. Oh and  beat you silly in 2016.
I've seen more Biden signs in Rochester Hills. Not many trump signs at all. But drove through Macomb County the other day and there are still a lot of  yard signs, flags, and big billboard-style trump signs everywhere. Needed a shower after I got home!
Good morning Miss Janice 😊🤗
Because the black presidents agenda was to instill total racial divide and destruction!! Oblunder and Biden racist worthless administration!
Biden will cancel.  You watch..there will be an elaborate excuse from the lying dems
No it would be Biden’s America! The guy is a complete nut case! As for setting up Booths up for for for Democrats they cheat! And people are walking away like flys from the Democrats! I sure don’t want to raise my children in a socialist state or Country!
Biden can’t put two sentences together!
Biden should be in prision along with Obama!
I bet Biden is already developing a program.
China refuses to leave their embassy in Huston TX This is a declaration of war. If you think they want  to remain President you're poorly mistaken. China hates us &amp; wants to rule aka kill us. China paid Hunter Biden millions from after  threatened them
...nominating part of the RNC will BE in Charlotte. He's running against VP Biden --- but a major opponent of his is the Coronavirus which is bad now - in large part due to his inept handling of it all.
President-To-Be Biden, you earned my vote! Go Phillies! As long as they finish ahead of the Mets!!!
This is Trump's sick but weak attempt to convince people that this is what life would be like under Biden so of course his koolaide drinking followers buy right into it
realDonaldTrump: Obama, who wouldn’t even endorse Biden until everyone else was out of the primaries (and even then waited a long time!), is now making a commercial of support. Remember, I wouldn’t even be here if it weren’t for them. I wouldn’t be President. They did a terr…
You obviously don't get it. You can say whatever you want about Biden, he is still the better man.  is a lying, cheating, racist, narcissistic psychopath. He's committed two impeachable offenses JUST THIS WEEK. There is no bottom to how low he will go.
Why continue to lie about Biden? Trump &amp; supporters are scared. They can’t promote themselves because the truth is that bad.
Donated ! Can’t wait to put a Bizon and Biden lawn sign up! Let’s get real representation for Michigan’s 10th District so Kim can also be #thatwomanfrommichigan 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻 #WomenGetThingsDone
The only thing  has that  doesn't have is dementia. Biden's the best democrats can Do? No wonder they keep sleepy Joe in a bunker. It's not to save Biden from the #ChinaVirus it's to keep us from seeing how bad  mind really is. He's dems puppetThese guys think Joe Biden isn't competent enough to be president
Unfortunately these are our only viable choices.   Regardless, neither will be in office for more than 4 years.   Someone with Biden’s experience is needed to Jean up trumps mess, then let’s work to get someone younger.
Ya, she claimed to know him personally, too. As she did with Joe Biden &amp; said he gave his personal cell phone number! 🤣
They don’t want a recession you idiot!  That hurts everyone except the rich!   Trump and his mishandling of covid has caused this recession.   Obama and Biden fixed the economic collapse from bush and now trump has ruined it again.   He is incompetent and failed this country!
Biden is a bad candidate...but if this pro life, pro gun, pro free market constitutional conservative can plug his nose and vote to save our republic from Trump, so can every liberal. Dems better SHOW UP to vote, or you can bet I will never waste my vote again.
I predicted this is how it would end up 2 years ago and is why I am glad I supported and campaigned for  The Sanders campaign got absolutely nothing out of the Biden campaign besides a lot of tears and broken hearts. This #SettleForBiden sheep-dogging is pathetic!🤬
Whoopsies.  Joe Biden Criticized Trump’s Handling Of PPP Loans As His Son-In-Law Benefited From the Program | The Daily Caller
Biden’s pick for VP is... the dang Minions!?!
It would be great if Joe Biden wins bigly on Nov 3rd with the in person voting and then watch trump beg to have the “mail in” ballots counted. And then just watch a slow motion landslide!! Is anyone willing to vote in person to get this done? 864511032020 🌊🇺🇸❤️✊🏿✊🏾✊🏽✊🏼✊🏻
Does Biden know he's running for President yet?
Moms for Biden? Dear God! Guess they like the idea of a strange creapy old guy groping their little gils and them,even with the camera rolling. Strange bunch they are!
Whatever it takes.  I’m good with. It will take a while to fumigate.   Hope they start packing the tacky decor they have.  Biden then immediately needs a ceremony putting up Obama’s picture.
Well you do know that Biden is not the current President right. We know that because Biden would have done something in the first 70 days when COVID-19 hit. So why is it up to Biden to go out &amp; take a chance on catching #TrumpsVirus When Biden get's into office it will be better!
false
She’ll fit right into Joe Biden’s “who am I and why am I here” administration.
Look at Obama and Biden’s record!   He inherited a horrible economy from bush and turned it around.   Now another republican has screwed not all up again.   Time for a Democrat to fix it again!    Look at the past presidents.   Dems fix it repubs tank it!
Chip in to elect Joe Biden
Trump campaign temporarily halts TV advertising in Michigan, but plans to outspend Biden 4-1
Like Biden and Obama?
The Greatest Dealmaker in History is a total fraud. Jared thought unleashing the pandemic on Blue States was a good strategy Ivanka poses with a can of beans Jr used $75,000 taxpayer money to shoot sheep  Time to kick them out and replace with Joe and Jill Biden  #ONEV1
That’s why Joe Biden hired 600 lawyers, wasn’t it?
Biden thought he was at the beach
I love how dems let city’s get destroyed and blame trump. Biden doesn’t support 🏳️‍🌈 and people aren’t black enough but it’s trumps fault for racism and hate. Gtfoh
Biden better worry about if he’s even Real. The vaccine is a joke for a joke pandemic.
Biden is a token
Do you mean “legally” stop Trump from stealing the election?  All options should be on the table since The Donald will declare a Biden victory illegal.
If you're going to treat us like the Republicans are treating us, you can watch support for Biden evaporate. I didn't donate what little money I have just to elect a Trump Clone. No more donations from me until you change your platform.
The Background Influences of GPB Capital Holdings: Hunter Biden, a Jeffrey Epstein Associate, a Biotech Company, and a Russian Mob Connection.
So Pelosi becomes President per the Constitution and Trump can go pick weeds in the parking lot while she schedules a do-over if it needs to be done. Or Biden takes over. In no way does this work.
What does it matter? What does it matter if it's Biden or a wooden Indian? The oligarchy rules, not our elected (ha ha) leaders.
So the  is getting more help from Russia. Nice that the  is funded &amp; paid for by Putin. The  are nothing but TRAITOR'S!    I guess they figure Russia helped in 2016 so they might as well help in 2020!
Obama and Biden handed trump the record high stock market and record low unemployment!   Check the facts!   Obama felt with viruses too but he listened to the experts and did the right thing.   trump created the problems here and still refuses to try to fix it.   He’s incompetent
If you vote for Biden America will look like Trump’s America not the best message
trump skated along on the work Obama and Biden did.  What has he done to react and correct the problem? Tell Americans to buckle down and fight this virus together to help the economy?  Nope! He had time to prepare prepare but called it a hoax.   He’s incompetent and ignorant!
I think she means so Biden can put a replacement for her on the SC, not a Con.
I don’t know one mom that is going to vote for Trump. They are all voting for Biden. And here in Grand Rapids Michigan, I don’t know one teacher that wants to teach in three weeks or one parent that wants to send her children to school in three weeks.
What Biden does right - is always get it wrong.   #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica
Or, we should just have Trump and Biden stop campaigning and spend the rest of the time hearing what 3rd Party and Independent candidates have to say.
If this election is done honestly, it’s not going to be close. There’s not one person that is excited to vote for Joe Biden. Everyone who does vote for him will have this uncomfortable feeling. The guy is cenile.
I actually believe that if Joe Biden wins the Presidency and dotard declares it illegitimate I believe the entire Govt will obey the new President and drag dotard &amp; his toadies out GLADLY, including military and Secret Service #thebeat
Biden is better than trump in every  way!  trump has destroyed the economy, has millions unemployed, has killed 150,000+ and still hasn’t acted to correct any of it.  He’s a disgrace and a total and complete moron!! Also, 20,000 lies in less than 4 years and is Putin’s puppet!
I think that they are setting Michelle up for the old bait and switch with Biden, I think He will drop out for medical reasons and she will step in to 'save' the election. This will happen at the last possible moment and the Media will glorify her and this move . I hope I'm wrong
Anyone want to bet Biden never debates TRUMP on stage ?
Biden during the debates if he manages to wiggle his way out of them.Gasping for air and thoughts that aren't related to smelling girls hair.
Inserted a pic of Biden? Who's reaching now?
If Biden picks that black widow and wins the election ,he won't last 10 months and she will be in Power. And THEN she will bring the horror show to America and reign down terror from coast to coast .
What about Quid pro Joe Biden being under investigation by Ukrainian officials. That's going to bite him for sure.Trumps going to est Bidens lunch if Biden ever debates TRUMP. Biden will wiggle his way out of it so how..mark my words..it will happen.
I noticed Twitter pulled all the less flattering gif's of Biden down..wonder why.
From 6 yrs ago with makeup. Show me a pic of a Biden rally with more than 100 people.
He already passed it 😂 where you been? Biden refuses to take take the cognitive test and is hiding in his basement
It’s not Biden or Obama’s responsibility to do wither of those things.   They had been out of office for over 3 years.    trump is the one responsible!  All of this happened in his presidency.   He called it a hoax and made a virus political, not them! #TrumpVirusDeathToll150K
We all need to prepare ourselves for after the results. Because they will announce Biden as POTUS fraudulently! Biden is worse candidate than Hillary and TRUMP has amazingly more support than last time. It may result in a uprising! Which my cause bloodshed..hopefully not.
I don’t need to even watch. Trump can pass cognitive tests. Biden cannot. No debate. And for you to vote despite knowing that shows you do not have the ability to put your personal opinion of trump aside
Here’s a link for Biden’s coherent speeches. Enjoy peasant.
If Biden wins in November, watch the NYT do a fast about face in January and start crowing about how the danger is behind us now
Trump is the joke?? Biden can’t even speak a real sentence. You’re dismissed, child
Do 5 fucking seconds of research. Biden put forward the US crime bill which has played a role in the protests of today. He can't finish a sentence. He didn't support gay marriage until 2012, he told wall Street donors that "nothing will fundamentally change." We need real change!
What hate? Look at Biden’s racist quotes that never gain traction from the media ...  trump done way more for black communities thru employment than Biden has ever done
Why When  Makes Any Sence He Says He'll Do Whatever Trumps Doing to Unravel The F-Ups  Caused  Bidens A Fake! And Under Investigation In Ukraine  Biden/Obama Stole American TaxPayer Money And Ukrainian TaxPayer Money To Enrich The Rich  1 Billion Missing
Hello #Biden delegates, I am once agin urging you to pledge to vote against a party platform that doesn’t include medicare for all. Party platforms aren’t binding, but now is the time to fight for what’s right.
Moscow Mitch doesn't want to protect the workers.  Ted Cruz thinks $600 a week is too much money.  Joe Biden and the Democrats will protect the American worker and get them paid a living wage  #ONEV1
Yeah let's let her control the server for email election cuz we know that Hillary is so trust worthy. May as well just announce Biden President today if we allow that
He can't blame this on Obama or Biden. But I wouldn't be surprised if he tried.
Let's get one thing clear, I'm not voting FOR Biden in November, I'm voting AGAINST Trump, because he says shit like this that scares the hell out of me. He
Joe Biden and DNC: I want Joe Biden &amp; DNC to support &amp; enact Medicare for All - Sign the Petition!  via
No Deal. Go directly to jail and do not collect $200
Only would consider supporting this delay idea with 3 simple mandatory requirements: (1)  resigns; (2)  installed as VP; (3) immediately resigns upon Biden becoming #VP.
Weird new world, seeing Joe Biden interview pop up on What Up Moms youtube.
Not so sure about that. Biden is losing the middle fast. You seem worried and triggered again. Enjoy your day. 🤣
Maybe not but he WILL be escorted out when Biden is sworn in.  All power transfers and there are measures in place to assure that.  Trump will then be trespassing if he refuses to leave the WH. He'll be forcibly removed at that point.
That’s the only way Joe Biden hopes to win. But there is nothing impossible for God...
Biden is under investigation in Ukraine...... Where is Hunter ?
I’m realy tired of this bullshit claim that hydroxychloroquine hasn‘t been proven effective five against the virus! It’s all a scam to keep us in fear until after the elections are over (and they hope, a Biden win)  What happened to Our body, our choice?
Trump supporters be like, “Lolol, Joe Biden doesn’t know what room he’s in!” Gonna really bum you out then that Trump is so incredibly incompetent, he’s gonna lose to a guy who doesn’t know what room he’s in.
Someone at work just said they imagine Joe Biden's hair smells like an abandoned camper, and I can't stop laughing.
The Republicans and Fox treat the virus like a joke  that's why we need a Blue Wave and Joe Biden in charge  #ONEV1
BREAKING NEWS: Joe Biden picks Aunt Jemima to be his running mate.............#VoteRED2020RemoveEveryDemocrat
I can’t wait to see your face when Biden wins the election. Trump can’t even fill a small broke down arena, he certainly won’t secure enough votes to win the election. Perhaps he has a chance, but not with how he’s handled COVID. Sad day for the republicans.
Biden would be licking the shit out of her.  That is funny
This was so enjoyable to watch. I’m so sick of the double standard of today’s so-called press. BTW have you seen the softball press questions given to Joe Biden?
Trump vs. Biden: Where they stand on health, economy, more
I’m a delivery driver in W MI since C-19 started.. I see hundreds of #Trump2020 signs/flags everyday.. Only 2 Biden signs in months.. Greetings
Biden literally didn’t know where he was during a public address today 😂 Hillary - now Biden 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂
you can say whatever you want about biden, i’m sure i feel the same way and have thought the same things. the DNC makes me want to boil over. In the end though, there’s just too much to lose
Angela Davis considers biden the candidate more effectively pressured by the left - this is true. It’s easier to mobilize the left under a continuing (even worsening) neoliberalism than fascism
busted my ass for bernie in feb/march and after losing michigan told myself i wasn’t voting biden.   I’ve changed my position, and you should consider doing so too if you haven’t already
I have two issues when I hear "This will be the most important election in American history." 1: The DNC gave us a piece of shit that is just a bit shinier than Trump &amp; calls him watermelon sugar &amp; 2: Biden is going to do one iota better than Trump. Maybe two iotas, we will see.
You are so off on this buddy!  You can thank the #DemsAreDestroyingAmerica #GeorgeSoros for paying for all these idiots to do this!  TRUMP HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS!  BIDEN HAS EVERYTHINGTO DO WITH THIS! and it is about NOV!
Hoping Biden doesn't pick Whitmer as I'd like to see her stay Michigan's Governor for at least 2 more years thru this virus.
Since when does anyone vote based on the VP?  If one truly believes having Harris or any other Biden pick as a VP is WORSE than having trump as president then they aren't a dem and they sure as heck ain't progressive.
Is somebody actually talking in his ear or is Biden hearing voices? I’m serious
My friends son is taking part in a social experiment. He has to wear a Biden 2020 t shirt for 2 weeks and see how people react. So far he's been spit on, punched, and had a bottle thrown at him! I'm curious what will happen when he goes outside.
The Dems are just sweating about the #Durham report! I can’t wait hear this, it’s like Christmas. I bet the Obamas and Biden’s are sweating through their undies !
Excellent! Hopefully he has given up on winning Michigan!
Just went on a walk around my neighborhood and noticed that there was still a Bernie sign in every third yard or window (an occasional Warren sign too).  To this day, I have yet to see a Biden yard sign anywhere
I agree that Biden could end up being worse... but we KNOW what Trump is doing, and how far he wants to go. I'd rather take a risk on someone who MIGHT care enough about his image to at least not be as bad as Trump would definitely be.
I'm not voting for Biden to materially help anything. I'm voting for him to not genocide brown people in cages, or send federal stormtroopers into our cities, and so on.  This isn't about making change, it's about minimizing the damage that gets done while we fight for change.
No, voting won't bring real change, at least not in the current system... but it can be a way to keep people as safe as possible while we ALSO work to make real changes. Biden won't bring any real systemic change, but he will at least do less harm than Trump. That's not nothing.
Biden is shit, but Trump is far worse, and while I'd much rather send a message to the Democrats that they need to move left or keep losing, the damage caused by another four years of Trump is a greater harm than that caused by giving in to the Democrats' manipulation.
when I think of presidential nominee joe biden, I think of lang syne (old)
biking around my city, I still see literally dozens of Bernie yard signs but not a single Biden sign. wonder if this means anything
Taking a wild guess in saying that Biden asked Reagan’s family for permission, something Trump never did &amp; tried to profit off of.
I’ll be doing exactly this out in my street for days after Biden wins!
I disagree with that assessment of Biden.
Y’all might not know this, but the current presidential nominee was also a Vice President. His name is Joe Biden. Was he also too ambitious, or is that something we only say about women??
yeah. Khive was getting too riled up over this.
Joe Biden = a fighting chance against global warming. That's the tweet.
So...I was told to ignore what Donald Trump had to say about women a few years ago.  But, he's running ads in Michigan showing what Joe Biden said in...1987.  The mental gymnastics it takes to be a partisan is incredible.  I'm willing to say they both suck.  #Trump #DonaldTrump
Trumps comments about the low income housing, just made me pick up the phone &amp; donate more money to Joe Biden!!!
The election is going to be crazy I believe. Biden will be announced POTUS fraudulently and the mail in ballots will take forever and cost too much so they will say theres going to be a better way next election. Biden is worse than Hillary was and TRUMP has more supporters.
I do hope Biden wins, Dems take the Senate, and we all breathe a little easier after the inauguration. However, if the Dems think all they have to do is appear to be nice ... well, no. They’re dead wrong. The big machine is the problem.
Trump is good for America. Biden would be a disaster.
All I really learned from this story is that at least five people don't want Harris to be vice president, and that at least three of them donated money to Biden. I'm guessing you could make that same Claim about literally everyone who is being considered.
I think Harris isn't the best choice anyway.  I think the battle in the swing states is closer than we've been led to believe and a radical leftist from California will not help Biden in those states, regardless of her color.
People are cautious because she went pitbull on Biden. Biden needs a pitbull on his side. He needs to stick to the empathy card and let Harris fuck people up for a living.
Chris Wallace has the most journalistic integrity on that network. If he can take the sitting President to task, Biden shouldn't be worried about any slanted questions.
I'm sure when Biden takes over every last one will be removed. I bet right now he is already working on &amp; has contacted all the people he wants.
You mean like you do whatever Papa Putin wants?    FYI, think you are way off on VP Biden, he is his own man who knows how to create a good consensus &amp; compromise in government. He will heal the nation
Stacey Abrams touts Biden plan to support minority-owned businesses with Michigan entrepreneurs
Voting based on race is not in anyone's best interest.  If I vote Biden because he's as pasty faced as they come, I'm voting higher taxes, fewer Constitutionally protected rights, and less justice for Americans.  That doesn't seem like a good idea.
Bull it will never happen! He’s done more for this country than the last ten Presidents! Vote for Biden vote for communism and a nursing home resident! Vote for Biden is a vote for crooked Hillary and our country turning into the Deep States agenda. WAKE UP
They had 8 years of Obama/Biden which gave us DJT!!
I think we just found Biden's VP.
Not a terrible question. Should we ask the same question about Mr. Biden? Seems more than fair to a reasonable person.
Joe Biden says he'll announce vice president pick in first week of August
Sad thought I just had, Joe Biden couldn't even make this walk in any sort of reasonable pace without help, and that's now. What's Joe going to look like in 2-3 yrs?
So is the DNC's and Joe Biden's platform for the 2020 election "At least we're not Trump"?  Because with all the progressive policies the DNC is against that their constituents are in support of, it sure as fuck feels that way.
Michigan Threatens to Slip From Trump as He Goes Quiet on Airwaves - The New York Times
The Democratic Party doesn’t listen to its more progressive leaning voters; it only nominated Joe Biden to win some moderate votes. Moreover, the party is evolving and unless they can convert moderates, they will begin to lose votes to people that don’t identify as socialist.
I swear to fuck if Biden picks Kamala as his VP I'm going Green.
Oh yeah Hillary. Obama and Biden did such a great job in 2009 with the Swine Flu and you did such a great job with Benghazi. Get real. Nobody is buying your BS.
Remember the first Men In Black? The little alien inside the human shell?  Biden's little guy is from Uranus.
Biden day? Looks like Joe and his staffer.
God, you are just so childish and unintelligent.  I cannot WAIT for President Biden.  At least he can communicate and has empathy.  Something you will never have.
"She will vote for Biden in Michigan – another key swing state Trump narrowly won in 2016 – and harbors hopes of one day running for elected office."  More losses for Trump amongst his 2016 base and in the swing states and more gains for Biden  #ONEV1
Joe who? You're surely not talking about Creepy Joe Biden?
Yeah, but Biden and the Democrats never do what they promise at election time. They don't have to. Fools, like we used to be, vote them back in anyway. They don't even try. Bernie would have, and still does.
Pure evil is neoliberal Democrats promising to improve things but never following through because they serve the oligarchy, not us. And Biden is one of the worst at that.
Biden is the antithesis to Bernie. He is all that's bad in politics. So never.
The part where Biden is much better.
She already gave up &amp; endorses leg-hair biden
‘Do not hold grudges’ against Kamala Harris: Biden speech notes caught on camera
I'm an amalgamation of every emotion. Once Biden is sworn in and Donald's treason team are in prison, then I will level out.
This makes me happy 😊  I don't even care if its wrong!
My money’s on Connie. Biden will spin the shit outta it.
Biden is a corrupt, dementia riddled, pedo, who will allow Antifa to burn down any semblance of justice.
Joe Biden shared this post earlier, do I look like I know what I'm talking about?:
This man is the absolute lowest of low. I mean Schumer is on a pedestal compared to Nadler. Is there no level credibility or decency anymore - Nadler, Biden, Pelosi, Schumer are all examples of why there should be single term limits.
I'm volunteering for Joe Biden on the Vote Joe App. It only takes a few minutes–check it out!
Oh hell no lol voting for Biden is like shooting yourself in the foot.
Oh look!   is running Russian Active Measures on Biden.   What a surprise.   Chris is a Russian Asset
Biden is announcing his running mate next week I can’t breathe
Well I guess seeing how old Joe Biden isn't a hunched over old geezer I can vote for door #1.
Its always someone else's fault when you tRump's break the rules. And the only 1 taking away people's voices is your daddy. Please know we will remember on November 3rd when we vote for Joe Biden.
I don't care who Biden picks for VP. They are all good choices. I'm voting blue down the line.
Robert Mueller and Joe Biden have a lot in common. They are both past their intellectual prime and easily manipulated by aggressive ideologues on their team. #JoeBiden2020
Did you hear the clapping after Joe Biden’s softball press conference that left everyone dumber. It’s hilarious! Tells the whole story.
Biden Just said he hasnt been tested So wouldn't thatbe a pretty good  indication that COVID-19 isnt that infectious? I mean hes been hiden biden. He says the name of reporter scans his sheet for what his answer to the question.  Biden is a joke!
They shouldn't be able to reclaim their time this is nothing but a witch hunt.  This is insane.  Covid is under control, Now you have idiot Biden! Touting #s that would have saved lives!? Are you EFFING kidding me.  Let's talk ab oi it #KillerCuomo #Killeand the 1000s he killed
I thought there was no way they don’t replace Biden, like you. But he says Biden is it!
Do you watch the dilley show? He made a really good argument that Biden is their candidate because it’s too late for them to switch. He said they would have done it a long time ago.
I think the reason Obama has been seen constantly with Biden this past week is because in the next couple of weeks, Biden will announce his running mate.  Michelle Obama
Can anyone make sense of what joe Biden was just saying?? I can’t! 😳
Um hum. And it's going to get worse.  Good. Nothing but disaster will wake people up. Trump has made good progress toward disaster, and Biden won't help a thing.
Why is fox entertaining Biden questions from hand picked reporters of the house circus with Barr?
Joe Biden is A  Globalist And His Regulation And Taxes will Destroy America!!!!
Why When Biden Says Anything That makes Sence  Trumps Already Doing It!
Ok so I just flipped over to Fox to see what they were saying about the hearing &amp; they are showing Biden talking to reporters after his conference. Did Fox not show the Barr hearing today at all? Just wondering if they were trying to hide it from their base?
Despite disagreeing with #Biden on everything from guns to taxes to abortion, he has my vote.   We won't have a USA if we don't eliminate Trumpism from our republic.  Unlike the Trump cult, I know my vote's flawed, but Joe has 0 ability to invoke violence by tweet. #Biden2020
hey CNN, I love &amp; support Joe Biden, but, I have been enjoying watching Barr get ate alive in this hearing! Please turn it back to the hearing! Wth???
Now on a break and blow hard Biden is saying nothing

Oh, I blocked him a while ago.  I'm all for green party but it's either Biden or Trump.  If we get Biden, then possibly in 4 more years we can vote for the green party. But if we get Dumpy, we won't get that option.

Dump Chris Dodd! If you choose him over Kamala Harris, there will be no Biden vote from me. I'll vote for every other office, and leave that blank. We'll replace Trump through a Democratic Senate, if you choose people like Dodd over Harris. We know how awful Trump is. Be better.

I'm just glad we have VP Biden running for the DEMS or I might have had to vote for Kanye because I could never vote for Trump
Biden delegates: I‘m making a desperate plea. PLEASE sign the letter pledging to vote nay to a party platform that doesnt include Medicare for all. The Democratic Party needs to stand for and defend everyone, and during covid that is especially apparent. We need bold legislation.
Obama announced Biden on Aug 23, 2008 and Hillary announced Kaine on Jul 22, 2016.   I think we are all desperate to hurry up, get this election over with, and get the orange menace out of office.   Be patient.
Biden has been a public servant for his entire career.  Why on earth would you think he'd "turn into an asshole?"
What makes ppl so sure Biden gon save America ??
Hear me out... What if, instead of an election between Trump and Biden, we held a nationally televised, to-the-death cage match. Then, the winner gets a life sentence for murder and we all elect someone who's not completely insane.
The “Vote Biden or Trump will win” mentality is only helping them block others from debating!! #NotAWastedVote #LetHerSpeak
Do you actually think "The Left" has a candidate? The election is the middle vs. the right. The middle is bringing the left along. If Biden can fill a cabinet without selecting people who plead guilty to federal crimes he has my vote.
Joe Biden is so powerful that even when he's sleepy he can still destroy suburbs and burn cities to the ground 😂
Thank God you'll be gone soon! This won't happen on Biden's watch, you can be assured of that! When we get rid of you, we'll get rid of all the violent protestors.
Wish Biden could have in person rallies just so we could use the “LOCK HIM UP” cheers!
Did you feel that way when Obama and Biden were in office for 8 years before trump?   I was never worried one day with them in charge.   It will be nice to go back to sanity, competence, and “boring”.
You keep pushing this narrative that Joe Biden will destroy America, that he'll allow China to run all over the US, that there will be riots etc. This is your Presidency, this is happening now. This is what you are doing! #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
To vote for Biden is to give in to the terrorists causing all this unrest! That is simply stupid! Trump is uncovering the evil and they don't like it! #Trump2Q2Q
Joe Biden should choose Condoleezza Rice as his VP.
the only person from Biden’s campaign taking,  is his wife . #whereisjoe
You assume an honorable man like Joe Biden has the slightest care what a pissant like you has to say about anything. You disappearing from public view will be just one more benefit of your daddy losing in November.
We will see what he can do after November. Guess we just gotta ride it out. He won't risk Biden getting in office over a building. Or even officers lives.
We will, November 3rd when we vote for Joe Biden.
If I was the President, I would have a hard time not laughing at biden the entire debate.
All of you suburban residents across all of this great country need to familiarize yourselves with AFFH. It will transform your lives in unbelievable awful ways. Please watch Life,Liberty and Levin episode of 7/26/20. Biden is for this travesty.
It's not extreme. Why won't you people get that. So many countries have a single payer system, the only reason this hasn't passed is because corporations run this government. And that won't change under Joe Biden. His health care plan will leave millions uninsured. That's wrong!
And all my friends say we have to vote Biden because it’s the right choice?
If Biden won't debate Trump then there is no vote and Trump remains president
Biden is a chicken shit and won't debate Trump  No debate .... No vote.... And Trump remains president
Then why did you immediately back Biden and not Bernie?
The same people who tweet for biden...
Biden being weird towards kids.... all of this is bad! Ffs do you hear yourself? Take the red pill bud (I’m not asking you to smoke trumps pole, I’m just asking you to wake tf up) 🤦‍♀️
Scratch and sniff “Biden 2020” bumper stickers would kill this cycle.
● End violence against women. ​Biden will work to end violence against women, continuing his leadership on this issue since he authored the Violence Against Women Act in 1994.
● Help women navigate work and families. ​Biden will expand access to affordable child care and care for older Americans and people with disabilities, and provide paid leave and other important workplace benefits and protections.
● Expand access to health care and tackle health inequities. ​Biden will expand access to high-quality, affordable health care for all women.
● Improve economic security. ​Biden will start by fighting for equal pay, investing in women-owned small businesses, expanding access to education and training, and strengthening pay and benefits in careers disproportionately filled by women.
Biden will never have a chance without a debate,’live interviews and appearances. If they think he can win without showing his face and hiding him in a basement, they’ve lost their mind!
You saw the footage of Biden smelling children, right? Come on Chris, this country is weak because we are divided. 😐
I know they’re not going to let Biden debate, but I wish they would. That would be the best tv of the century. Hilarious! Can you imagine! Every second would be recorded by millions!

Biden has already won the election fraudulently. Counting all the mail in ballots will take forever and cost too much so Biden will be announced POTUS and theres going to be a better way to count votes next election.This may lead to a uprising which bloodshed. Possibly TRUMP 2020
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.A reminder that a vote for Biden is a vote for Trump. A vote for Trump is a vote for a third party. A vote for a third party is a vote for lasagna. Not voting is having a yard sale. Fishing is putting in a cement driveway.
Joe Biden is the shitty half of the Obama administration.  He better not screw this VP pick up
Trump campaign temporarily halts TV advertising in Michigan, but plans to outspend Biden 4-1
1) Tulsi endorsed Biden, too.   2) Bernie has absolutely not donated “all of his campaign to the DNC.” He’s using it to help elect down ballot progressives like Jamaal Bowman.   3) Tulsi doesn’t have very much money to donate, even if she were so inclined.
No, it doesn't. But I am not a partisan who is completely blind to the world around me.  The second Trump wins, the likelihood of World War 3 starting with China is high.  They already own Biden.🤷‍♂️
I have a neighbor who has one that says something like I'm down with Biden

If Biden is less evil now, it's only because he forgot what he was doing.  Donald Trump is the best president this country has had in my lifetime, I won't see his like again. They could have run someone good and still would have lost.🤷‍♂️
Biden could pick Jesus Christ and would still lose, due to his incompetence.
If VP Biden isn't getting tongue-tied saying "build back better" out loud I am impressed.
By ELECTING JOE BIDEN!
Fuck you  on censoring my picture because it shows the depravity of your boy,  and his fixation on his own daughter. But yet, a friend of mine posts so called “suggestive” pics of Biden and you do NOTHING!
Well, now the smear on  by Trump and his supporters is to hint that Biden is a pedophile. Do they really want to go there? 🤨
What are you talking about???  Biden +12 in Michigan  Have you seen the latest polling??
When you tweet stuff, you look like a moran when you aren't honest.  I stopped at the first one due to the BS  Just to be clear, Biden has not been on a killing baby spry &amp; Trump has not been out, like some kind of Marvel Super Hereo, saving babies  NO MORE BS --- GET A BRAIN!!
Are you CRAZY!! This country will be doomed if sloppy joe  Biden is president.
I drove thru the backroads of Pennsylvania only seen one Biden sign.  A trump sign every 3rd house.
Somebody please tell Biden when his VP selection has been made

What should Joe Biden use as his campaign song??  My first thought is All Fired Up by Pat Benetar. 😊  #Biden2020
Either you're a Kanye voter or you do not understand the question you asked me.  There is no honest reading of the facts that does not show Trump as the best of the three major candidates. Spoiler: Biden isn't second.😁
It depends on what you mean by alternative. President Trump is far superior to Joe Biden in his prime, much less the corpse that they are driving around the campaign Trail.🤷‍♂️
Still doubt Biden will budge on issues Sanders would fight for.  Not convinced he will fight for M4A, Debt-Free College, ending the wars, legalizing marijuana, or a Green New Deal - which are all priorities of "far left".   He's a neo-Lib that cucks to corporations like Clinton.
Nah, I'm just not up to goofy hour, where COVID-19 is called a Hoax, or some crazy conspiracy is repeated from QAnon where Biden wasn't born in the US, or is an Martian, or something
Trump has a campaign ad already claiming Biden will defund the police. So yes, he’s starting now with it.
Wow, just saw Trumps campaign ad here in Michigan. Trying to use scare tactics that Biden is going to defund police. 🙄 Anyone who falls for that line of bs, needs to not vote. 🤦‍♀️
1. Tbf kale wasn't as widely known in the 80s as it became in my teen years. It came from Cale.  2. Fuck Joe Biden, check my Twitter Banner.
You think Biden is going to pick Sanders as a VP? Or am I misreading your comment?
If you think Biden is a socialist, you're going to be as disappointed as I am. He's as right-wing as a Dem can get.
Dems had a rockstar in Andrew Yang &amp; blew it.  Homeboy was crowd surfing &amp; dropping F-bombs!  Anyway,  Biden being a puppet of the "far left" is a stretch... If the far left were really in control, don't you think we'd have a more progressive nominee than War Criminal Biden?
Today in Closing Remarks, Steve gets real and tells us straight up that we are in a fight. He reflects on the exchange of words between Biden and Trump.
If the results are obviously fraudulent, what rational candidate should accept them? Has anyone asked Joe Biden if he'll notice if he loses?😁
Yep, they’re getting desperate. Now they’re trying to frame Biden.  and  what are you doing about this? It’s so obvious what he’s doing. It’s called ELECTION TAMPERING. And some of us are already aware of China and Saudi Arabia helping Russia interfere.🤨You are a full blown idiot. Biden sucks. He is owed by the oligarchy and if you support him, you support hurting working class and poor people. Pull your head out of your ass, you stupid clown. #NeverBiden
Joe Biden doesn't know what day of the week it is
hUnTeR BiDeN who?
The average voter is not gonna vote for Biden because his VP is smart about money or “wall street fears her.” The average voter couldn’t give a fraction of a fuck about Wall Street.
strongly disagree. As Trump continues to fumble the ball, Biden should maintain a defensive posture. Announcing a team gives Trump counterplay: characterizing the team as socialist, left leaning, etc. The election is a referendum on Trump so let it be that.
Not to mention. He’s running against Biden right now. I’d get that dementia checked out again, if I were him.
Are you suggesting you’re running against Obama? It’s Biden. I know dementia is setting in.
Where is this information coming from? Not Biden! Trump had the spotlight, making one bad decision after another, the media was waiting on anything negative from democrats to take it away. The people making these statements should know better and know how the media operates.
Right. She knows, Biden knows and we know.  It's like Christmas for little kids... they intellectually know Santa is coming but they are super duper nervous all of Christmas Eve.
Yeah, when this thing is over the movie scene is gonna be LIT. There’ll be almost too many highly anticipated movies all coming in a short time frame.
Hell, we aren’t safe in Trump’s America either. I’ll take my chances with Biden.
It was supposed to be released 6/26/20.  But due to the pandemic the studio delayed it to next summer. Now scheduled for release 7/2/21.
Biden / Harris is horrible. All we'll hear for the next 3 months is how she locked black people up, blah blah
Again let's be clear if Biden was in this video below partying with Jeffery Epstein it would be plastered on Fox news everyday.  Of course because it's the Dear leader, we hear the sounds of silence!
Joy I’m loving the idea of President Pelosi if Donald mess up the election. I think he would rather Biden win. 🤣🤣
I can see how strategy of changing VP announcement timing keeps process and media influence in Biden’s hands. Meanwhile, the not so smart mitchy-boy &amp; putin-puppet will be beside themselves.
Frump is a sorry excuse for a Commander in Chief! We need Joe Biden to lead our Country back to prosperity. 🇺🇲👍🏾🌊🌊
Who cares this year?   Biden sucks. #NeverBiden
Yes it seems like last ditch efforts to derail her which means Biden has let it be known she’s the one.
I don't expect enough close states for it to matter. Biden is blowing Trump out. So states like Texas and North Carolina may take a few days to call, but it will just be about margin at that juncture. Biden will be well over 270 EVs.
All true. So let’s get rid of Biden. #NeverBiden
Biden slams Trump, McConnell for 'political games' with further coronavirus aid
I’m getting so many texts from both parties (which is what happens when you’ve voted Republican AND Democrat over the course of nearly 20 some years). I wish “please stop texting me” worked. Trump’s party is very demanding via text. Biden’s side is more pleading, but polite.
I guess it’s time for the polls to flip Trumps turn to fundraise then the polls will flip back and Biden can make $$$
Who cares? Biden wrote the crime bill. Not voting for him. #NeverBiden   Biden is a ....

Speak for yourself. I took a carload of my daughter’s friends to the polls to vote for Biden and I’m not over 45. Most of my neighbors are under 45 and all supported Biden in the primary. He handily won Detroit; both younger and older Black voters. Bernie’s rally at my daughter’s

Well, all I said was that you were whining. And you were. It's called criticism. Obviously,  you can't take any. So man up and vote red, stay home, vote Biden. It's your decision.  You may want to work on your writing skills.  Frankly,  you are the one that appears "ignorant ".
Here’s the full report. Biden handily won the precincts w/ high Cuban populations
Joe Biden says that we have a "crimate clises".  I think he's right...
A lot of Biden’s allies seem intent on making an anti-Trump election into a validation of what the left base wants, which Biden has smartly shied away from. The question will be whether Trump continues blundering around so it doesn’t matter or not.
Then vote Biden and quit whining
Posting a tweet from a random twitter user and a unsourced poll is not proof. Biden won every single county in Florida. Bernard was barely viable.
Who is denying that Clyburn helped Biden? Literally everyone saw it and acknowledges it.
Since when is ambition bad!!  You need someone with guts to do and say the things that need to be said while backing them up with facts.  Biden/Harris 2020
That’s insane. The female VP, under Biden, SHOULD be our 2024 president. It NEEDS to happen.
Also, so what???  We need people to rub people the wrong way at times. Not doing that gets us no where. The key is to know when to do it.  Biden/Harris 2020.
I've been over with this Bachelor-ized Veep-stakes.  I think we have enough things in 2020 stressing us out.  Biden doing this long, long, vicious process has me pretty disgusted.  Still voting Biden, but this is pissing me off at this point.
No, it's just leaked to get your exact reaction. Let's just be cool and wait for the decision. Obama didn't choose Biden until mid-August.
Pretty sure Melania is voting for Biden
How many do you think would be dead if Biden was President? (Keep in mind Biden would NEVER have banned travel as quickly as Trump did....Trump’s ban needed to be more, FAR MORE STRINGENT, but it still saved countless lives without any doubt).
Biden is the most inept, corrupt and racist candidate ever   Being a victim of dementia doesn't help his case either   He belongs into a nursing home not into the White House
Going from Clinton +1.5 to Biden +10 seems pretty good for Ds
Biden’s VP pick will be another scapegoat to blame after they lose so they can blame the weak candidates instead of their weak ass party.
it’s fuck Trump and Biden forever 🖤
Hard to think if Trump loses the election, he will actually be unconstrained ( which he actually is now) to say whatever he wants. He will dominate the media and social media directly challenging every Biden decision. The birther thing was child's play compared to what's coming
Levin: 60 Million Americans Got Swine Flu, Obama and Biden Stopped Testing
Definitely! She already displayed it in that infamous debate with Biden!
White people realize that the 2 most powerful positions on earth are going to be held by black people before white women. Elizabeth Warren is to old we need a VP in their 50's or below, because Biden is only doing 1 term. Then we'll have a all black President &amp; VP.

If you grew up in the Soviet Union,surely you would see what the left is doing more so parallels the Marxism that you fled from. It's not Trump that's trying to force socialist policies on the country. It's the losers on the left like Biden,Sanders,Pelosi,AOC,etc. that are.
What happened to Stacey Abrams will happen to Joe Biden.
Anyway, I believe that VP Biden has already chosen a Black woman to be his VP and she already knows. We'll find out right before the convention. But that's just my speculation. I wish her lots of luck and love. I'm rooting for her success.
All the attacks happening in real time. You seem to be so focused on “ew Biden” that you’re allowing an admitted racist, sexist, misogynist to blind you to just how terrible he is. And, frankly, such blind following obedience will continue to lead this country to hell

I hope Biden doesn't listen to his certain allies. Picking Kamala would be a slam dunk for him, don't mess this up Joe I pray 🙏
Right, if Bass is VP then and Biden wins, then somebody like Whitmer or Harris are just going to destroy her in 2024 if Biden doesn't run. Problem is that there are a lot of people who will want to be in that position and it will get messy.
Harris and Duckworth are "do no harm" candidates. The rest have baggage and Bass really brings little to the table and does some harm. Bass maybe won't outshine Biden as much, but seeing as Biden has run a cautious campaign so far with success, I don't see how he strays.
Ironically texting everyone 👍after Biden on that livestream has inevitably led to just doing it
you couldn’t come up with a better candidate than BIDEN.   Great guy. But 77. Seems like he can’t handle the stress. In hiding. Will he do that when a crisis hits this country.  Conflict with other countries. I take my chances with crazy trump.  At least I see him
Aunt Jimimi would have been the best V.P. pick for China Biden but the bernie bros and girls cancelled her🥰
Not for me lmao. I think people aren’t going to make the decision again to not vote. People may not like Biden, but know he is the lesser of the two evils.
That makes it worse we supposed to matter more to each other but I guess that old saying is true that if you ain't voting for Joe Biden then You ain't black LOL. My reading comprehension is great I'm just terrible at not engaging with people who are yoga instructors. ✌🏿

Only way I’d ever vote for Biden
Joe Biden’s background isn’t squeaky clean but look at the alternative.
🤦‍♂️ The whole “Biden has dimentia” thing is a baseless lie spread by the trump administration with no evidence to back it up. Biden even went to the doctor and got his brain checked. Surprise surprise he doesn’t have dementia. Trump however (according to psychologists-
Ok then why don’t you support Bernie Sanders who wants free healthcare for all? Or even Biden who wants to expand apon Obamacare to make it more affordable?
I don’t believe Joe Biden won the nomination fairly
Absolutely not true. No one votes for the VP unless their feelings are still hurt over Bernie. FFS, this is about getting trump out. Vote for Biden, get over yourself w idea VP counts.
Who the fuck cares? Vote for Biden. If you don’t, you’re really just a chaos agent.
Seriously? You’re sowing division. Grow up and vote for Biden.

They just figured out that saying Biden was the president of antifa wasn’t gonna do it
The clip is of him using an iPhone X. I’ve seen it. So that’s a lie. And besides all old people struggle with new technology. The lie that Biden has dementia is a baseless lie not backed up by one fact created by Donald trump. So maybe do some research before you blindly believe-
Democrats lost this election when they nominated Biden and you know it.
That's funny. You're a real hoot. However, I believe Joe Biden was vice president when Barack Obama pulled us out of the great recession.
You should be worrying about trump’s dementia. The lie that jo Biden had dementia is just that. A lie. He has been proven not to have dimentia. But trump is still running smear ads against him and laying nonstop. And you’re buying it. Honestly stop being such a 🐑.
Actually he didn't. He said NOTHING about the Bro Behavior until AFTER he CONCEDED the nomination to Biden. #toolittletoolate #nocreditgiven
Hey. Don't be supporting dopey Joe Biden. You seem not to realize that the majority of your followers are Trump supporters.

Fair; I disagree with how Biden put himself in a box like that, he should have never said that, but that's here no there, it's done. You can't please everyone that's impossible to do, these decisions are set up for criticism by somebody, so just pick the best qualified "person!"

we need “moms for biden” and “R moms against trump” campaigns ASAP ‼️‼️‼️       ‼️‼️‼️
No he isn’t
My guess is the company has a zero tolerance policy stating masks must be plain w/ no writings/symbolism/flags  If u allow the US flag u have to allow BLM, confederate flag, swastika, Trump, Biden, Drew &amp; Mike Pod, Walter the boof announcer, Luke Newacki, Death Wish Coffee masks
You were that hot guy running for president from Washington State, amirite?   And you were big on the environment?   I wish you were the nominee.  Sorry, but I am not voting for that creepy, pedo perv, that wrote the crime bill Joe Biden. He is corrupt too. #NeverBiden
Sorry. I guess I'm just used to people slamming Biden being Trump supporters. I can't defend everything Biden says, but right now, he's the lesser of two evils.
Biden has previously said Whitmer was on the short list for potential vice presidential picks.
“I will rebuild this economy and mEeT tHis cRimiT cLiSis” - Joe Biden the Plagarizing Retard Puppet Sock running for President
This election is bigger than your pride and ego. It’s about choosing the best candidate to move your agenda forward. Right now we have two choices. Neither one is perfect; but as you can see from his platform Biden is MUCH better than Trump to get more of what you want.
I thought we were behind Biden now. We should be. I will never understand how Republicans do so well to fall in line, but Democrats struggle. Trump called the wife of Ted Cruz ugly and dogged his Daddy...Cruz is in line. My candidate was Warren...now I’m RIDIN WITH BIDEN!!
It doesn't matter constitutionally. His current term ends on January 20th. In contesting the election, he risks that a timely decision will not be made. That puts him out on Jan.20. Not Biden or Trump, it will be #PresidentPelosi
I took a ride to upper mi  guess what?  NO BIDEN SIGNS..... TRUMP SIGNS EVERYWHERE!!!! WE WIN
You must not read her timeline. Clearly she hates Biden more
President Trump def. has to shock the world again and beat crazy joe biden.  i think this race will come down to the wire again.  covid-19 def. is the biggest issue going into this election no doubt.
"biden is further left than any democratic president in history"  i just burst out in laughter
Funny the Democratsand Biden they play down the pandemic.  So that’s a long shot blaming him.  Trump said to wear something over your face.  Even a scarf and thay was before CDC announced. Cdc said 200k Americans will die.  That’s was their best case. Nancy was in China town
I'm ashamed to say I live in Michigan.  The biggest problem Trump has in Michigan is that he tells the truth about the black messiah (Obama).  People don't like Biden, they just don't like the fact that Obama sucked and Trump keeps saying it.
You actually think the puppetman Biden could have a complete coherent thought, on what or how anything must be done to move the ball forward? It’s not really a question, we all know the answer. He can’t tell the difference between his wife and sister for gods sake!
Biden’s VP
CNBC is not bias... you are laughable Mr. Puppetman Biden. You are not even the puppeteer, you ARE the puppet.... WE SEE YOU OBAMA. You will never rest easy now that truth of your administration is emerging Judicial Watch.....anyone?
He didn't feel this way before running for President. Black people would still be screwed because of what Biden wanted in 1977. Will you leave your little children alone with Biden Alyssa.
Good thing Biden didn't get his way in 1977 then huh
I never once said the “black vote” is a monolith. I live in Los Angeles where it’s obviously MUCH different than in the south. Still doesn’t change the fact that the majority of black voters in this country voted for Biden and that’s why he’s the nominee.
both are terrible. although one would certainly be better than the other. to me what matters most is the people they choose to be apart of the administration. trump has shown that his admin is full of blubbering idiots. I think biden would bring a good admin similar to obamas
Read Biden’s platform or don’t. Vote for Biden or don’t. Your rigged conspiracy narrative won’t change a thing. I’m just sorry that I’m the “posturing” idiot for correctly pointing out that Biden is the nominee cause he had more black voter support than everyone else
Biden is running on the most progressive platform of any major party’s nominee in US history, at the very least since LBJ. He’s worked with Bernie and has adopted many progressive plans. Your frustration w/how the primary turned out doesn’t make a word of what I’m saying untrue
Nonsense. Biden wins it’s over.
Imagine if Biden hadn’t shown up today. He would’ve been “old and sick and unfit to lead.” Meanwhile when people were bringing up Bernie’s age and health issues for MONTHS, we were laughed at and dismissed. Wake me up when Bernie is held to the same standard as everyone else
Such a better option than Biden tbh, DNC needs to take note.
So do I. Biden and Kamala are a...
Yeah, both Cornyn and Trump are hilarious. A laugh a minute. They'll both be crying in November, learning the names of MJ Hegar and Joe Biden.
Yes. You’re right. “Biden is the nominee become of black voters” is not true at all. It’s total bullshit. Bernie is king of everything, the whole thing is rigged. The Dem eStabLishMent hacked and rigged EVERYTHING. You win.
High(er) than that boob biden in likely to get elected
Biden isn't gettin in.
To those who keep bringing up Biden's gaffes as a defense: Joe could say he comes from the planet Blobbo where the currency is peeled grapes and everyone rides around on space capybaras and I'll STILL vote for him. Just like you'll defend whatever batshit insane thing Trump says.
Remember when Bernie was old and had heart issues and was running for President and his supporters kept saying how none of that would affect his ability to lead? Same people who went after “old man with dementia” Joe Biden for not leaving his basement.

But God damn it if he picks Kamala as VP I am going to have the hardest time voting Biden.   Please don't make me wanna kill myself after voting. Thx.
Look, I decided awhile ago that I'll (begrudgingly) be voting Biden this fall because of how bad Trump has handled the BLM movement and COVID-19.
Joe Biden say that we have a "crimate clises".  I think he's right...
VP Mike Pence, while perched atop a pile of 150,000+ dead Americans: “You won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America.”   Fixed it.
GW Bush was hands down the dumbest president in my lifetime... but Biden is taking it to a whole new level as a candidate.
If you’re asking would I vote for Biden the answer is yes...
Maybe he got it from cuomo while he was out yelling at people.  He wasn’t really locked in his basement, only Biden was.
Biden will win, I think by a large margin.
I saw one today...something about how many degrees Biden has and receiving half a scholarship supposedly in his own voice but it didn’t sound like him. 🤷‍♀️
So when I see an ad that says you're doing a good job I should think about the lower drug prices we'll get under President Joe Biden? Sure thing!
Yeah I can’t imagine him showing up for Biden’s inauguration. He’ll have some excuse. I just want his margin of defeat to be so large that he can’t lie to himself about it. He’ll lie to everyone else for sure. But I just want him to have to admit to himself that he lost.
....CHUMP?! ALL Democrats? Pretty SURE of the voting electorate, eh SPORT?! I'm guessing that u haven't VOTED too often. Ever hear of EXPERIENCE? It's ONE of a thousand things WRONG with Trump--who had none. Biden has MORE than anyone. ELECTABILITY. Biden HAS it! Not Bernie.
Biden does not support Medicare for all. At least, do your research.
Based on the Fox talking heads and the Twitter Trumpers tonight, I’d say it was a pretty good day for Biden.
Cmon, ⁦⁦ Make them put their names on this crap or hit delete. Journalism 101  “We'll be back on the air shortly, even more forcefully exposing Joe Biden as a puppet of the radical left-wing," a senior campaign official told CNN.”
If trump wrong with his calculations to make himself look good.  It’s the same thing Biden said trump should stop flights from China and overreacting. Now Biden said he didn’t say that. I remember loud and clear. Trump wall vs Joe Biden telling trump not to put band on travel.
Biden said he has his final four down to four women of color. I don't think he would include Elizabeth Warren in that inclusion.
Take it easy there, Nervous Ned! U been on a long acid-trip the last 5 months? The Covid Kid lay u up in a hospital somewhere without TV, radio, Internet or Print news?! Biden has slowly been rising in the polls 2 stake a double-digits lead over the ONLY person whose out of it..
And I don’t want to shame anybody but seriously you are telling everybody vote and you go into this whole but this is as good as we are going to get we shouldn’t question or demand more we just got to suck it up and vote for Biden because we got to take out Trump. 🙄No wonder
I mean this whole settling for less shit isn’t going to cut it everybody should be demanding that Biden and his team do better do something more beyond just giving us a story or a vague speech.
“With his dying breath he said, tell Obama to use my funeral for Biden’s campaign! Biden for president”🙄
Hard to FUCKING believe! Believe me: after Trump's done FUCKING UP AMERICA with this HIGHWAY ROBBERY SHIT, Biden--should HE lose--WILL ABSOLUTELY appeal the results. And WIN! Bcuz Trump will HAVE 2 CHEAT 2 come out ahead on Election Day.
I have a serious question so say Biden wins and Trump/his team is out what comes next so far what i hear is very vague. Okay you are going build back better so how are the Dems going to take back the house from the Republicants. Cause so far Joe isn’t for progressive policies
The congressional black caucus delivered the nomination to Biden. I think he should pick Susan Rice. Governor Whitmer needs to stay in Michigan right now
He was there in the 60s and his supporters act like thats enough. They also attacked John Lewis for endorsing Hillary and Biden. Know who else was there in the 60s?? Mitch McConnell. Does he get a medal too? If Bernie was the hero he claims to be, he would’ve been there today
TRUMP666 SUGGESTION on a delay for the 2020 Presidential Election is so you AMERICA..
They don't care.....I've seen Biden voters argue against nearly every one of those things. The fact is that most Democrats are actually Republicans and don't seem to realize it.
I’m a Black Mother. My mother is a Black Mother. We are both voting for Biden. So is my daughter ✊🏾
Our youth are a tiny tiny part of our electorate and Most of our kids will be voting for Biden where it matters. Biden won our district by over 20 here in Michigan. He won Black voters under 50 by a lot
I already love PRESIDENT BIDEN 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
How would everyone feel about a Biden/Whitmer ticket?
trump and biden are literal bums im SICK
"[Biden had a] leading role in the Obama administration's 2011 efforts to slash the deficit by...cuts to Medicare and Social Security."
"Joe Biden Tried to Cut Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare for 40 Years....Biden was once a New Deal Democrat. Then he “evolved” and starting backing decades of Republican plans to cut Medicare and Social Security."
Biden is devolving into a memory care unit poster boy
I’ve said this in another tweet.  I believe it’s Amendment 20 that says if there’s no election, the day the president was to take over, the Speaker of the House is temp. President. So Republicans, would you rather have Biden or Pelosi???
Yeah right!  "Joe Biden Tried to Cut Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare for 40 Years....Joe Biden was once a New Deal Democrat. Then he “evolved” and starting backing decades of Republican plans to cut Medicare and Social Security."
No one should believe you, Joe---&gt;
All Trump's doing is EXTENDING the PAIN &amp; MISERY of losing 2 Biden. He will try something--&amp; it will FAIL. He will try ANOTHER--FAIL. Another--FAIL. FAIL. FAIL. FAIL. FAIL. His attempts at staying in power will fail more than his Business ventures. FAILURE'S even more certain...
Biden doesn’t have dementia. Nor syphilis
}I heard vice President Biden say when he become president I guess folks can say what they want to say yep cuz I'm gone do that anyway you can count on me^
Trump is the best president we’ve ever had and ever will have. The Biden followers are just too stupid to know it.
Also, read Amendment 20, I think it is.  If there is no election, the speaker of the house takes over on the date the president should have taken office.  So my new question to Trumpsters is would you rather take a chance losing to Biden or have Pelosi?
Oh, so like I said, there is no difference huh?  In fact, I’d say that Biden is far worse and much more dangerous than Trump.  Might as well keep the Zionists, racist, rapist conservative we have.
I talked to a customer today, and they were hardcore Biden fans. They were talking trash about the wall being built. I told them that the wall protects a lot of children being human trafficked. They told me so what?! That’s not the worst problem our country faced.. it’s trump 😂
I don’t care... 🤷🏾‍♀️  Like Joe Biden is going to be any better.
Joe Biden’s got time travel! Oh no!
Ya know how Presidential candidates on the campaign trail used to kiss babies? Biden could shake my baby and I'd still vote for him #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
How about when KKK member senator Robert Byrd's was eulogized by Joe Biden, Joe Biden praised the ex Grand Wizard of the KKK,he actually called him BOSS!,if you support Joe Biden!, you support a RACIST!
And the narrative continues!! The Cabal wants Prez Trump out so bad that they have this weasel say statement. If you believe this idiocy,  then put a mask and GOGGLES on you idiot and vote leftist, I mean biden or who ever the running mate is, because biden is failing quickly!
And  I am hoping Biden &amp; Harris will be in :-) ♥
I think you need to #1 take a look around, YOU ARE NOT DOING YOUR JOB. You can't assess anyone else, you cannot even do YOUR JOB! You cannot even manage a crisis SO BIDEN has to do it for you!

You bet, "make American great again" because it was great until you got in the White House, now we have a mess and Biden WILL make it GREAT ♥
I sure miss Obama: “If we want our children to grow up in a democracy — not just with elections, but a true democracy, a representative democracy, a bighearted, tolerant, vibrant, inclusive America — then we’re going to have to be more like John [Lewis].”
It’s gonna be something like “the rules are so unfair to me”.  The smart play for Joe would be to agree to any rule with the exception of “only Trump can attend and answer questions”.  If Biden does that Trump will keep moving the goalposts in his effort to validate backing out.
Biden at 49/50% in all three states. Y’all running outta stuff to talk about.
Random thoughts on Biden's pick for VP, does it really even matter as long as they're competent?  The longer they wait the less time fascidemic45 and the Qnuts have to spread outlandish conspiracy nonsense.   Conservatives have abandoned the lunacy. All they have left is nutjobs.
That is real, isn't it.  "Settle for Biden".  Someone got paid for that.
Conspiracies aren’t facts. Biden is the nominee because of southern black voters. Period. Have you even read his platform?
Really hoped we’d get Bernie Sanders this time a round but Joe Biden gon have to do
I will take Biden's problems and his picks any day compared to what we're experiencing right now. Real talk. This country is not in a good place right now and it is getting worse every day in my opinion.
I think the debates will seal things. I just don't think Biden can keep up with Trump on stage. Gonna cast a pretty strong contrast
Nobody noticed this but me I swear.. Joe Biden might have been right! 😆
NATO is an alliance  Germany nor any member country owe dues or fealty to 45  Pulling troops further from their defensive positions only emboldens Russia to further land grabs like Crimea, Georgia and Transinistra. Along with their ongoing efforts to erode democracy.  Vote Biden
As the Biden Campaign launches “Moms For Biden” tonight it’s important to remember his radical agenda:  ➡️ Higher taxes ➡️ Defunding the police ➡️ Government takeover of healthcare  ➡️ Job-killing Green New Deal  Biden’s destructive policies are completely out of touch with moms!
I NEVER thought I'd say this but. Joe Biden was RIGHT!!!  😅😂😆  #YouAintBlack #blackface #ObaMAGAate #KAG2020 #JoeBidenIsARacist #ObamaWasBetterAtEverything Including Blackface!

What's sad is that people support Trump at all. Say what you want about Biden, Trump is 100x worse.
Joe Biden say that we have a "crimate clises".  I think he's right...
Seriously, French Republicans don’t even go anywhere cutting universal healthcare or elderly pension (social security), there are about blaiming everything on immigrants while enriching themselves. Still assholes, but better than Biden.
Even if it was true, thats really not saying much. But it sucks that he has to sell Biden to his base because of the urgent necessity to remove The Orange One. The DNC put us here.

Bernie is actually on record saying that “if Joe Biden wins the election, he will be the most progressive president we’ve ever had”.
Future history classes are going to try and pretend that all of these protests were about Trump, and we were all longing for the leadership of a calm and sensible Joe Biden.
Wonder if it’s still “clever” if President Biden tweets, “I’m doing such a great job, I think I’ll stay for another 8 years.” Will it just be a chuckle for everyone of would Republicans freak the F out.
Obviously he's changed his mind. Maybe Joe Biden is listening.
I didnt think so until reading this.
Yep! It’s exhausting just saying anything positive about Biden or anyone else outside of the GOP hate machine. Good luck and have fun. #VoteByMail #Vote #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #LoveIsEssential #Peace #KindnessMatters
You can be someone who won't vote for either Trum or Biden, and still be very concerned about Trump's threats to cancel the election. It is still important to vote, especially in the downballot local elections.
so are you gonna cheerlead and knock doors and advocate publicly for biden?
Sorry, but Trump has to go. Historically I'm a 3rd party voter, but not this time. I cannot stand by and watch my country get destroyed at such a ridiculously rapid pace. When Biden get's in, we can work together to pressure him for change. Trump pays attention to nobody.
Or how much Biden touches and talks about children and how he likes them jumping on his lap. ON VIDEO!
Cheaper then Biden corruption
Don't worry. In 6 months, we have a chance 2 have a REAL U.S. Gov't CURE ALL OUR ILLS in a NEW POTUS--Joe Biden &amp; his tremendous staff.
And I don't know if you haven't figured it out yet but your God Obama turned a funeral into a Biden rally. And yet you still blame everything on Trump. You're a joke.
No need to worry sweetie, it won't be a close election. 3% means nothing when Biden is getting 90% of the votes.
why the hell not!  i don't feel the mail-in-voting will be fair for President Trump.  dems  will basically stop and nothing to get biden in office like terrorizing are cities, killing policemen etc.   i think people need to think of the alt. of Trump, biden and the soc. dems.
All urban areas need to ensure proper training, irrefutable counts &amp; rolls. The trump campaign will try to eliniminate &amp; intimidate areas with large minority centers such as Detroit, Philadelphia, Milwaukee, Miami, &amp; Cleveland in battleground states. Biden needs observers.

I got a strong feeling Joe Biden is going to pick Kamala Harris as his VP...
I hope he picks Susan Rice because she'd be ready on day one if GOD forbid something happens to President Biden.
That’s some funny shit... vote for Biden. Dying! 😂😂😂😂😂
You seriously have issues if you believe Biden has any chance...  his first debate is going to be amusing.
Trump runs like a business man and has been very successful. Put your TDS aside. It would be nice if the Dems had a candidate. He has cognitive issue and it’s truly sad. Trump is just a New Yorker that says what he thinks. I do feel bad what they are doing to Biden
Nah...he was allowed to say yes or no,they only gave him yes or no questions and refused to allow him to bullshit. Get used to it,after Biden wins there's going to be a whole bunch more questions...
Real question: do you think Biden is at all capable for any office?
We can get Joe Biden elected if we can have a perceived crisis until November 3rd  Some businesses will close and some people will lose their jobs, but many people feel Joe Biden is worth it
The more that the public perceives a crisis, the more likely they are to vote for change.  The longer Governor Whitmer can extend the "crisis", the better Joe Biden's chances are November 3rd
Might things become just a little too obvious when Biden gets 19,000,000,000 votes?

That’s exactly what you want. Blame trump from virus and losing job. And get Biden in office.  Win Win for the liberal media

Nobody, and I mean nobody of sane mind, actually believes Trump is trailing Biden (who can’t form a sentence).   What’s Interesting here is  can’t even say  but rather refers to him as “opponent”  That’s embarrassing on so many levels.
"Joe Biden Is No Friend of Public Education"
2/3 Obama Biden Holder spied on the Press; has to apologize to Germany/Merkel - MSM had Obama Biden adm spying throughout 8 yrs - O/B historical view is a PATTERN OF SPYING and violating The Constitution + working to overthrow Israeli PM
why is anyone surprised that Obama Biden spied in an Oppo party and Presidency of  - their entire 8 years was shown to be at its core spying eg c Clapper lied to America via Congress re Spying on All Americans; AP, Rosen/family; Congressional Committees; Merkel1/3
Biden will likely do what Obama did---fill his cabinet with people who paid for his campaign, letting Wall St manage the economy &amp; insurance lobbyists organize healthcare--&gt;
You’re still scared of running against Biden. You’re not confident in your record as president. Your approval numbers will go up if you resign.
Read the article please, it talks about Trump's lies. We all know Trump the idiot is a compulsive liar. What is less understood, it seems, is that Biden is also a liar and not to be trusted---the policies he's pretending to support now run counter to his decades-long record.
Biden is like we need to grow and open the country well then if he believes that why is he against pushing and fighting for basic fucking needs like housing, healthcare, canceling student loans, etc etc?
Stop being dramatic, every single poll I've seen shows a majority of Bernie supporters voting for Biden.
Absolutely--&gt;  "The following is a sampling of some—certainly not all—of Biden’s lies in a variety of areas."
Which, btw, is why it’s critical that Biden, if elected, doesn’t back slide into the neo-liberalism that’s defined the last 40 years of the Dem Party — its the only way to inoculate us from the threat posed by the coming generation of less managerially incompetent mini-Trumps.
Endorse Biden or your words are empty
What authority does Biden have to do anything right now? These people are the dumbest.
I'm going to level with you in this. Biden was not my 1st, 2nd, or even 4th choice, but he's the nominee. I will not only HAPPILY and ENTHUSIASTICALLY vote for Biden, but I will continue to share and donate and do whatever I can to help ensure he is elected
How mad y’all gone be when y’all find out Biden picked Whitney as his running mate? I’m going to be pissed’t
Many people did what you propose in 2016, look at what we got. Now is not the time to waste a vote on someone who can’t possibly win. This really is a 2 man race. We need our country to heal. While Biden may not be perfect, he’ll at least respect the constitution.

I'd be wearing a Biden 2020 shirt. The company I work for sent a company  email  telling everyone to watch Fox for their unbias Covid info. I responded with the respect for Chris Wallace but after that Fox was rated very low and listed the news organizations rated much higher.
hey Biden, operation warp speed, sounds like a plan. This contradicts your assertion that there is no plan to distribute the vaccine when it is available. ( 7/29/20 speech )
Joe Biden is not the answer to any of the problems that we as a country face today.
This shit is just sad this lady obviously has issues and is all over the place I noticed that on her IG.  This is why It was crazy seeing people canceling Buttar without hearing out the whole story all while Khive and Biden supporters who talked so much
Turns out Biden was a prophet.  And if his prophecy coming true surprises you then you haven’t been paying attention the past 4 years.  That Trump was going to float this at some point was a very easy sure money bet.
Joe Biden should be saying, "Let's build an America where professional athletes don't feel the need to kneel when the national anthem is played." #blacklivesmatter
Ms. Rice, what Americans really want to know is if Biden sniffed you or your mom in the coffin.  We know he didn't sniff the flowers.

I was responding to what you sent about Vice President Joe Biden. The poverty discussion was in a different tweet. The war on poverty also hit a major snag when Richard Nixon shuttered the Office of Economic opportunity was dismantled by Nixon and Eliminated by Regan.
Everyone has a different perspective. I've experienced the opposite. Berners have been the worst 🤷🏼‍♀️ KHive is loyal to the Democratic nominee whereas a lot of Berners/Warrenites refuse to vote for Biden if they don't get what they want.
I understand Biden's statement likely stems from ignorance. But hopefully you can see that for us actual Anarchist, the danger when both major US political parties are demonizing and threatening  state violence against us doesn't diminish simply because the intent is ill-informed
Franklin &amp; Marshall have the PA generic ballot at D+4 with Biden +9, something we've seen before here with Biden outrunning the generic ballot.
And Biden will be president you know the one who was racist all his life because you aint black if you vote for trump... oh wait you only talk about what the Republicans are doing. You're no hero just another pawn. If you condemned everyone equally then I'd be more supportive.
Joe Biden might not be perfect but wouldn’t it be cool to have a president that atleast addresses the oppression rather than tweeting “LAW AND ORDER!!!” Every 24 hours.  Idk maybe I’m wrong and each are equally effective.
Imagine being so brain dead that you think that Biden would be as bad as Trump.
Analysts imo are way low in their estimates of $VIRT Volatility is only going to increase after Biden picks his VP and election comes closer.   The 3rd Q could be bigger for the company
Biden will just continue current policy, but that is benign neglect leading to Israel slowly twisting in the wind
I hope Biden makes you his running mate, but if that doesn't happen, he'll surely make you A.G. in which case I hope you throw  and Bill Barr in a federal prison where they both belong!
No way Biden is winning without Michelle Obama as VP. Biden is being guided around by a NURSE. He is so deep in a mental illness, it’s sad that the Democrats allow this to happen.
No worries. I will drop my vote by mail ballot off at my local clerk’s drop box to make sure my vote for Biden is counted.
But why did Bernie bail? And then ask us to support Biden? Almost seems like he’s not to be trusted. 🤔
Wut? Don’t think they want to raise that topic. “‘But as Bill Clinton once told me, the number one cause of Alzheimer’s is ambition,’ he added, while noting he’s in favor of Demings.”
Nikki sure does not pussyfoot around when she compares her Trump to Biden.
Both options are terrible. I'm a Conservative and I've never voted for a Democrat. I'll take 4 years of Biden over more 4 years of Trump.
So if trump gets re-elected due to Universal Mail-In Voting is that considered a fraudulent election or is it only if Biden wins?
Another idea since we are just floating them:  The US Military puts your fucking ass against a wall and installs Pence until he wins in his own right or Biden takes over?
If mail in voting is ripe for foreign influence I am surprised that you are not all for it.  the russian vote is your only hope of beating BIDEN 2020
What I don't understand is: if you can TEXT 1 for American Idol, why can't you just TEXT 2 for Joe Biden?  Results instantly.  Every registered voter with a cellphone gets a text message:  REPLY 1 for the Republican  REPLY 2 for the Democrat REPLY 420 for Green Party 🤣
NYTimes
And Biden didn’t?
Done #DemExit. Last time I ever vote for a Democrat. Fvck    JDs, fvck dat b*tch Biden. You hoes got maybe 5 weak progressives in a sea of moderate, corporate Republicans. Good luck fighting the "real" Republicans but idgaf 🖕🏾😡🖕🏾
Who is saying this - because it’s not Biden. This is a full on weekend at Bernie’s.
Trump vs. Biden: Where they stand on health, economy, more
Former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign has vetted Gov. Gretchen Whitmer as a potential Democratic vice presidential running mate, two well-known Michigan Democrats said Wednesday.
I can't be the only one to NEVER believe these tweets.  I have seen Joe Biden speak and these are not his thoughts.  What will a Joe Biden Puppet Presidency look like?  Will Bernie and AOC control?  Who will be in charge while Joe is in his continuous sleep?
Joe Biden will appreciate that.
This guy who is Google's CEO looks like a Chinese Muslim! Big Tech wants Biden in the outhouse so they can take total control of our lives through the Dimwit party. Vote Trump to save America!
Biden announces plans to boost black and Latino finances
Absolutely better off with Biden. Fuck Trump!
I totally agree! I mean I’m in California but I still vote in Michigan. Most of my friends who vote here tho are still voting for Biden even tho they don’t *technically* need to if they really don’t like him
We’ve talked a lot about it too. She trusts my insights and opinions and actually seems more excited about Biden
My roommate is 40 and never goes on Twitter. Haha I’m guessing with her, it’s more about the superdelegates. She’s fine with Biden now tho. She just wants Trump gone
What? Are the polls not leaning Biden's way???
Seems like Dodd has the problem. Isn’t this the third time Biden has run for President? I would hope any of these women would have ambition. They’re all capable to be president. They all will have folks that will try and stop them solely because of their gender.
Absolutely correct. Biden nerds to hammer 🔨 that home. We've either lost a Family member  or we know someone who's died. This isn't a joke. This guy is still golfing it off, as if it will go away. Sick!
I don’t care about what the polls say, most in the USA are not crazy enough to vote for Biden and totally destroy American.
I’m in Detroit and you best believe I’ll be dragging everyone I can to the polls to vote for Biden. I had a car load during the primaries
Swing state no more, Michigan is voting for Joe Biden! Ride the blue wave home.🌊🌊🌊🇺🇲✊🏾💪🏾🙏🏾
Rashida Tlaib is not officially endorsing Biden but she will still work like hell to make sure he wins Michigan!!  Biden won Tlaib’s district by 20 pts. I think he’s good without her endorsement. We know how she’s voting. Condolences to the 🌹 who thought she was going Green
Bernie has more money than Biden does 🙄and didn’t Kara Eastman claim the reason she lost was Bc she got no help from the DSCC 🤷🏾‍♀️
That’s funny I thought Biden was the moderate choice and people are voting for him because he won’t do to us what Trump has done
I can’t.   Biden sucks.
Should say ‘Dems self destruct’. Biden allies move to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president
It’s beyond insane to me how many American voters STILL don’t understand that nominees are voted on, not appointed. The DNC didn’t choose Biden. The eStabLishMent didn’t choose Biden. Voters chose Biden. Is the riGgEd shit just a weird coping mechanism?
biden is hiding period.  doesn't matter whom he names as VP he still has dementia period.  i can't believe the dems still want biden as their candidate.  The VP pick by biden def. could be president before biden first term if he gets in.
the green new deal is both economically sound and literally necessary to avert catastrophe.  the iran deal is a mutual deal between two consenting nation states. biden isn't obama and has frequently expressed regret for the wars specifically happening during the obama admin
Biden sucks.
GND lgbt rights tpp iran deal scaling back wars union empowerment actual monetary policy etc etc all things under biden  since you're a libertarian you should read up on market externalities
Cue the dead from looting, burning and devastation from Kaepernick supporters in BLM and the tens of thousands of Corona Virus dead as a result of Fauci's poor advice to Trump.  Cue the ignorant comments from Biden supporters.
There's a better than 50-50 chance that Biden is just a delayed Democratic version of HW.
I hate to break it to you all, but if a white dude would seal the deal for Biden, he'd be picking the white dude. The VP pick is solely a pick for political purposes with the secondary that they might be president someday, though based on history, they probably won't.
The best part about the speculation about Biden’s VP deliberation is the near anger from liberal commentators that Biden actually intends to be president rather than an empty vessel that gives a leg up for 2024 to one of his challengers
Some Biden allies wage a shadow campaign to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president
It’s annoying because it’s going to be portrayed by our presentist media (with a handful of presentist historians) as being true when it’s pretty much the opposite. It isn’t a man vs woman thing. This pretty much defines the VP. It’s just liberals wish Biden wasn’t the nominee.

Biden supporters hate Jesus too.   Only Bernie supporters have the real message of Jesus.   #NeverBiden   Biden &amp; the Democrats wont even vote to give kids Medicare4All due to their greed.
Democracy means you can vote and have someone to vote for you on bills. opposite of a democracy is dictatorship or monarchy  Socialism is a theory that the community owns everything.  Biden never said anything about Socialism or Removing democracy. He said “Democratic socialism.”
Biden voters 💁🏽‍♀️
#MutualAid every Wednesday from FNC. This is who Biden wants the cops to attack.
Would you bet $1000 that Joe Biden will be President by this time next year?
Still trying to stay in the spot light. Can you imagine Biden giving this crazy lady a spot in the Whitehouse
Biden is already fighting an uphill battle and can’t afford not to make the best choice. Sometimes things are obvious for a reason and she’s obviously it.
When you do voting to that extent, you're gonna find more leftists, you're gonna find more Biden, SO I SAY TO MY PEOPLE "SLOW THE MAILING DOWN PLEASE!"
It was widely known that Biden would not run for President immediately after Obama. This is not sexism it’s ageism if anything.
Obama and Biden built those cages. Obama also signed the NDAA which is what Trumps feds are using to kidnap and indefinitely detain protesters.
Hell yes, I’m voting for #Biden
No. And I convinced one low hanging fruit Trump voter to vote for Biden.
Mind rephrasing this lmfao. It dosen't communicate whether you're supporting biden or not
When are you going to counter these DemocRAT  bullshit ADDS TO Elect Joe Biden
You're all sheep. Next time Biden does a virtual rally, compare his viewers to Biden.
Biden’s not the left dipshit.
The black vote was going to Biden because black voters want to win and overall Biden was the best choice for that while balancing him as a non-threat to their interests. Those voters (and Jim Clyburn) want to keep their future place at the table. Harris fulfills that.
Looking at it words can be misleading then you have facts which is east to find Only thing for certain Biden can't do what Hillary Couldn't and #TrumpBeatsBidenAss
Thanks, T! 👊🏽🥃
At this point, Biden could shoot me and as long as it wasn't a mortal wound I'd still vote for him. Just to be safe before he shoots me I'm going to mail in my vote for Biden.
Rioters and Looters for Biden.
Can you picture Joe Biden doing the state of the union address? 😂
For the record, I don't care who "ugh, fine" Biden chooses for VP, and I certainly don't think Kamala will be plotting to, I don't know, murder him? or whatever this story is implying, but fuck offfff with this misogynistic "too ambitious" bs
It’s not about people deciding between Biden and Trump. It’s about people deciding whether voting is too much of a hassle. The right Vp pick could motivate some voters who might otherwise be too busy that day.
Biden has spent the better part of his career with his eye on the Oval Office. So, ambition is good for Biden but bad for Harris? Do these folks take one cube of sugar or two with their stereotyping/marginalization of women and women of color? The agentic penalties are real.
I'm gonna vote for Joe Biden. And he better fucking pardon Pete Rose
Why was she the only doctor single out. She black and she let you know CNN is fake! Do now they attack her but not the white doctors. Biden call a black woman crazy. He the one RACIST not Trump.
News Flash!!!!!! More people are following Trump than Biden.
Proud Detroit Suburbanite for Biden. Also, not afraid of low-income housing destroying my “American Dream” #SuburbsForBiden #detroitwillbreathe #detroitworksharder
I recommend we vote Green. We need to show the Democrats we are not their pawns for votes. If Trump wins again, fine, Trump makes white people get up and fight, Joe Biden makes them all go back to brunch. 🤷🏾‍♀️
Don't pretend that you care about science, Joe. After all, you helped Obama give us the biggest oil boom in 43 years despite having a climate crisis....and you also did this--&gt;  "Joe Biden’s Campaign Claimed It Was Safe to Vote During the Pandemic."
Right! Now all the doctors spoke why is the black woman the only one the media is attacking! Because CNN, ABC, MSNBC and Biden are RACIST! Blacks are on yo him now in November Millions of blacks will vote for Trump! Trump 2020
Both you &amp; Trump are awful--&gt;  "Biden kicked off his...campaign by attending a big-dollar fundraiser with a major health insurance CEO....With their shared lies, Biden, Trump, and McConnell are operating directly out of the insurance industry’s playbook."
Like Trump, you are destructive--&gt;  "Against CDC guidelines and health experts’ urgings, the DNC and Joe Biden’s campaign urged Americans to vote earlier this month — undoubtedly spreading coronavirus further."
You don’t know a thing about Black voters &amp; u obviously missed the polls where over 3500 of us were polled. Kamala was at the top. Our turnout wins Michigan ( Detroit &amp; Flint) and Wisconsin for Biden ( Milwaukee). It’s why 45 is scared of Kamala getting picked. ✌🏾
How so? Biden's against universal single-payer healthcare, he wrote the Crime Bill and The Patriot Act which have facilitated the police militarization &amp; brutality situation we have going on....Like Trump, Biden has a career of legislating in a destructive, right-wing way.
100% of Michigan residents know the masks are dumb, but 50% continue to play the game because they think it will help Joe Biden get elected.
Follow along..... If hydroxichloroquin treats corona there’s no panic. If there’s no panic Americans go back to normal life. If Americans go back to normal life no mail in ballots. If there’s no mail in ballots Dems can’t cheat. If Dems can’t cheat Trump will crush Biden.  Simple
And Biden's better?
Biden is going to beat you and you’re scared.
Yea like voting for a baby murderer in Chief like China Biden!
No it's the Democrats whose base is dwindling. Democrats see all of this senseless violence on TV and are afraid of it. If Biden somehow cheats his way into the White House the police will be eliminated, taxes will rise and unemployment will skyrocket.
Jesus fucking christ! No I don’t think sexual assault is fucking funny! It fucking pissed me off people are passing around a meme with three sexual assault predators and Joe Biden in it!
It's funny how you Democrats never talk about Biden and what he plans to do. I guess he hasn't been told yet by the DNC?
We need a man like Joe Biden who would’ve just shit right there in his diapers.
Biden will have donkeys pulling cars by next year if he is elect our good union friends will help him get elected and will put the auto companies out of work
Joe Biden’s personal notes were captured in a photograph Tuesday, revealing talking points about Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), a leading contender to be the former vice president’s running mate.
Wait, did Biden say that or are you assuming because....old?
Come join us for a roundtable on racial equity with Lt. Gov Garlin Gilchrist and Ashley Biden!
D have promise so much and I like how Nancy said about monuments falling. “Ppl will do what ppl do”.  So if they want to destroy my White blessed mother Statue in backyard that’s fine.  Come in my house and take my cross and destroy that.  Biden will listen to her and the Country
This election is another joke of an election. Don’t risk your life for these two clowns, Trump or Biden.

Biden is a joke. #NeverBiden
What if the only time you knew or could see Trump IN JAIL was for 24 hr period IMMEDIATELY AFTER Pres. Biden was Sworn In? Trump cuffed on the podium, marched to a car, searched, stripped, fingerprinted, orange jumpsuit, &amp; mugshot, and freed next day-  Then I can die a HAPPY MAN!

This isnt by the biden campaign this is a group from Warren's and Bernies campaign group. Literally misinterpreted.
I don’t think Biden has 8 years in him to do POTUS job.
Andrew Yang wanted to give us $1000/month forever and here we are begging for a second round of $1200 stim checks and Biden prob can't even remember what he had for dinner yesterday smh lol how we make all the wrong decisions

Michigan Threatens to Slip From Trump as He Goes Quiet on Airwaves
It's not surprising given Biden's history of legislating against civil rights &amp; how he now says he'll give police $300 million.    btw: why the heck does Biden look orange here? Is it just my screen, or has Biden taken a page from Trump's book when it comes to his appearance?
#SleepyJoe Biden is ahead in the polls like the #PortlandRiots are "peaceful protests."  Neither is believable.
President Biden will reverse it.
I want 8 years of President Biden!!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸   Should Biden win, why do some assume he'll only serve one term?
The Dems fucked up not using the slogan “Biden: My time”.
Elizabeth Warren attacked Biden over his politics as well but I don’t see people yelling about how she’s too ambitious and will only use him to become president. Why is that, exactly? Did she do it the right way or something?
Biden choosing Harris as his VP is a slam dunk so I hope very much the leak is true!
the difference is, Biden has evolved.   Trump has not only not evolved, he has gotten worse.
Anyways glad Trump has pulled out, Biden needs to advertise as much as possible until Michigan has been won. The sooner it is the sooner we are rid of the Antichrist.
I can't even believe I am engaging you. Biden can complete sentences far better than your man can, put them side by side and watch. Pedophile background? Sthu. That is a lie.  Goodbye  back into your conspiracy theory room.
I think most Americans see a China Biden in the White House would be devastating! All the media and big tech is out to destroy Trump and America. We must not let Biden anywhere near the WH!
For the record, Elizabeth Warren directly attacked Biden about his politics but I don’t see a bunch of his allies saying she’s potentially going to backstab him  It’s almost like a bunch of white people are mad about a black woman who doesn’t just settle for being the help
My opinions: Harris- don’t care for her record as a prosecutor, and her attacks at Biden during primary Rice- Biden likes working with her and she’s not busy Warren- most ready to become President if something happens to Joe (god forbid), would be tough to replace in Congress
Trump is the one using DHS as his own personal police force INSIDE THE COUNTRY on American Citizens, jackass.  Also, yes, Biden did write the crime bill. He regrets it.  Though what party is supported by the KKK, Nazis, and White Supremacists in this country? OH RIGHT. GOP.
The Biden administration will reverse this hopefully
It was a bill Obama and Biden had in place that Trump ended and has resurfaced. I agree with the latter.   Just providing context.
Great job! Joe Biden will never win Texas.

Are people supposed to ignore that Biden is doing very little to earn their vote are they supposed to ignore thar the party just voted down on progressive policies like M4A, legalizing marijuana and against Palestine. I mean seriously do they think people are this naive?
Isn’t this what Joe Biden did?  “Some also argue that she's too ambitious and that she will be solely focused on eventually becoming president.”... and Hillary Clinton? And George Bush... and a lot of VPs?
Is Biden blind?
This matches what I have been seeing on TV here-- lots of Biden ads, no Trump ads.

You can't fall on the fact that Biden will win no matter who he picks. This will be very crucial to the election. Nothing against Obama but I thought McCain would have made a great president. Until Palin completely deflated his campaign.

Last I checked, Obama and Biden bombed seven countries, invaded Libya illegally and furthered wars in many places. It’s time to bring everyone home and end the incessant wars. The 90s called. They want your unnecessary fear of the Russian boogeyman back.
Wow they're so great on civil rights that's why Biden won't do anything about policing and Dem mayors keep using chemical weapons on their citizens,, wait
Why use photoshopped pictures of Joe Biden being a creep when there's already a bunch of actual pictures/videos of him being a creep?
America the greedy. “Help someone else out that is less fortunate than me... hell no. I am an American!”  Seth voted for crappy Joe Biden which I refuse to vote for. Seth is out of touch &amp; one of the evils that hurts poor &amp; working class Americans as he points &amp; says Trump bad.
Had this occurred under Obama/Biden it would have been handled swiftly and correctly.....it NEVER would have been called a hoax
It's turning into "Weekend at Bernies" Is he alive or are they just propping him up til the election. Shame on you Jill Biden!

If your a Biden supporter your a  pedophile.
I completely understand people not liking President Trump. What I do not understand, is how people do think Joe Biden, a 77 year old man with dementia, can run the United States. I honestly feel bad. He is being used as a puppet and will be fully exposed during the debates. 💔💔
Gabbard and yang were far less likely to win then sanders. Just becauee you would have voted for those two doesn't mean the dems should have installed them. They also shouldn't have installed Biden. They should let their base choose the nom without dnc pulling strings.
Bernie really should stop defending the party after all the shit they did to him and honestly fuck Biden Obama and the DNC for ruining this election.
He is all talk. Biden’s basement buddy
This! Biden recognizes his VP choice needs to A) Be a highly capable replacement should he pass in office B) Be fiercely loyal ally &amp; effective “bull dog” against Trump/ Pence &amp; C) Be a future Center-Left Prez Candidate/ Dem Leader in 2024/ 2028. Only Harris meets all 3 criteria!
Biden's sitting there like "what a fool! Everyone knows you can't actively undermine the poor. You have to do it with euphemisms by attacking charity over unrelated culture war issues and banning charter schools/school choice"  Trump: "What do you guys think of debtor's prisons?
Just like Trump &amp; the Republicans, Democrats do not care about citizens &amp; their health--&gt;   Like Trump, Biden is against Medicare For All, both are against defunding police, &amp; against ending illegal wars--so neither has my vote.
Biden is gonna lose again, the pick of #KamalaHarris will prove disastrous to the #Dems, at least #HillaryClinton will go down as the worst politician of all time for setting this losing ticket up.
Well, apparently even with 88% of Democratic voters wanting and needing Medicare For All, you won't give us that--right, Joe?
Um, still vote for Biden?
Everyone’s tired of the bullshit that’s why and Biden is a threat to our country
We have to fight up till election day like Biden is 20 points behind. Complacency is what cost Clinton the last election. Let's not repeat history. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
Better than voting Green and re-electing Trump.    I’m truly sorry Bernie bailed on your bunch (and then asked you to support Biden) but this goes beyond your hurt feelings at this point.   Anyway, see you in November! Hope you didn’t help #HamberderHitler stay in power!

1. You need to pay attention to what biden says and the type of people he surrounds himself with.  2. If you paid attention to biden's career you'd know he's has a lot of blood on his hands. 3. If my vote held so much power, then I should have been taken seriously from the start.

Biden and Trump are not concerned with this violence, they're calling on law enforcement to attack street medics instead.

You sure post a lot of stuff about why Trump won't win in November. I don't see similar stuff about Biden from you  though.
I think people are more worried about Trump getting another 4 years then the fact that Biden is moderate or subpar
Still ahead of Biden!
As States Take Pandemic Lead, Biden Is Said To Weigh At Least 2 Governors For VP
And what am I supposed to listen to? Joe Biden's expertise on what makes someone "black"? Ilhan Omar's blatant anti-semitism? AOCs logic for kicking jobs out of NY? So far, all they've promised is to raise taxes, open the borders, and bend over for China, just like Obama did.
Hold on hold on. “Reporters” didn’t follow up on russian bounties on our military but are all over Biden’s notes. What the actual F**k. “Reporters” are more of a problem than tRump is. Jesus C.
Biden supports and pushes diabolical lgbt.  One of the sins that cry out to God for vengeance... He also supports abortion.
If you think joe Biden is left wing you’re smoking crack
biden was instrumental in creating the war on drugs, mass incarceration, endless wars &amp; the patriot act . . . so idk why you think you're going to get anything different under him
I want Kamala, but idk who would be a better AG. Biden will figure it out.
Ummm. Biden is a bad candidate. Trump is a good candidate that the rich elite hate. You know. The same elite that spew nonsense all over tv everyday while supporting war and sending jobs to China. Ya those people made you think Trump was bad. But he actually isn't bad at all.
Joe Biden is an enormous wooden horse on wheels. Pass it around.
The RUDE,DISRESPECTFUL Dem asset's!,Masquerading as as WH correspondents, DON'T deserve ONE question,let ALONE the TWO or THREE they DEMAND!,LOU DOBBS interveiw's Joe Biden or NO MORE interviews/Press Conference's, atleast answer why he unmasked Gen Flynn?, WHY suggest Logan ACT?
To be fair, I think Biden is a good candidate for MI and he could help a lot downballot.
With less than three months before the election, he must be stopped from creating a nightmare for Biden in Europe. As always, he is following Putin’s orders.
He's also working with Bernie to move his platform left. And people can change. I'm not the person I was back in 1996. Or the person I was 10 years ago.  Biden wasn't my first pick, but four more years of Trump and we won't have a country. I'd like to be alive in four years.
Biden commented after Trump used tear gas that using federal police was only going to cause more fear and division and that wasn't the way to go. I think he's going to have people who will not allow the use of federal cops as Gestapo. And I don't think Biden would.
So I guess he'll start on his moat next, in preparation of staying in the White House when he loses to VP Biden on Nov. 3rd. Child-like imagination really can carry-over into adulthood.
Yes, radical left Joe Biden is exerting his influence to oppose legalized marijuana in the year 2020 and Medicare For All in the party's platform. What?  No serious voter will be moved by this argument.  It's as if nobody on the Trump campaign knows how to read a poll.
Trump holds another ego filled, rant, spewing his normal dangerous, emotional BS &amp; propaganda so the big crybaby can make himself out to be the “poor, weak, pathetic victim”.  Incompetency &amp; denial at the highest level during a pandemic.America deserves so much better. Vote Biden
In trump’s America. But he’s going to project it onto VP Joe Biden, who hasn’t held office in four years.
Why is Trump struggling here in Michigan?  has your answer: “The clearest reason why the president is reeling in Michigan is because of his failed coronavirus response,” said Garlin Gilchrist, the state’s Democratic lieutenant governor.
Claiming "fake news" is the Right's way of saying "I don't accept that," or "you can't say that because it doesn't fit with what I believe."  That concept needs to be buried with the election of Biden.  #86451132020
Biden's out and about. He spent a lot of time talking to area leaders during the protests, and LISTENING to them. He's giving speeches in different areas. He was just at the Capital, paying his respects to John Lewis. Pay attention.
Yeah, of course the GOP and Trump increased our debt/spending. I assume you are voting for Biden. Correct me if I am wrong, but Biden would only increase the debt even more.
Yes Metro Detroit here. Seen many Biden ads no Trump’s.
Trump conceding Michigan? Biden's currently +8 in Michigan on RealClearPolitics.
Joe Biden is a white supremacist &amp; voting for him makes you one, too
The ONLY thing Biden has going for him is that he is opposition to Trump lol. I feel sad for him (not really)
USA.  Needs Michelle Obama as your next president. Biden is certainly not who you want as president, but he will be better than the current one.
Also, much respect for you and your beliefs . I also noticed the above comment and that you follow DJT but not Biden. Just curious as to why.
WTF!!!! "extraordinary turmoil that a Joe #Biden win would bring on"   The country is literally tearing itself apart all because of trump.  Vote for sanity  BIDEN 2020
Covfefe. “Person...man...woman...tv...asshole.” Yeah,  is really the stable genius we’ve been told he is LOL and you’re worried about Biden? Gimme a break least favorite son.
Brujo told you a few months ago that Biden/Harris would be the ticket for Dem's. Let's celebrate this Thanksgiving for the end of the bitterness and prayers for our still Prez Trump. My screeeath..!
Biden ads say he's going to "Restore the middle class" but, seriously, what does that even mean? It's just as nonsensical as "Make America great again." So much meaningless rhetoric, yet people eat it up like free shrimp during happy hour.
you are missing the point the current fear in America is the result of trump being president.  Biden will bring America together and calm the trump manufactured chaos down
“Hi, I’m Joe Biden &amp; Help Me Defeat Joe Biden!!”
Jamaal just endorsed Biden &amp; Missouri isn’t NY son. Not one person has beaten a CBC member this cycle. Not one. In fact now a CBC member, Gregory Meeks, will get Engel’s old gavel. The CBC will have even more power.
Says the racist spreading conspiracy theories about Black Women getting paid to tweet
Yep I’ve had her blocked for months
Biden Slips Up, Says Americans Can Handle ‘Eight Years Of Donald Trump’  via
There’s a reason why he specifically asked for our support and there’s a reason he chose her to appear at his rally in Detroit. She got more love than he did. My city is crucial to winning Michigan. Biden can’t win cities like mine w/o us, and he knows that.
I love how they’re labeling it as “Joe Biden’s America” when it’s literally footage from his America 🤦🏻‍♂️
Women and see how far you get. There are not enough of you that vote Democratic and given Biden is polling beneath HRC w/ Black voters y’all can not afford to lose Kamala’s supporters. Over 3500 Black Women were polled by Essence &amp; Kamala was right at the top.
You don’t speak for Black Women and u need to take a seat with your racist tone. Kamala was polling right under Biden w/ Black Women so no, you can’t win w/o us. Especially not in states like Michigan where our Black caucus initially endorsed her. Keep disrespecting Black
"In this perilous moment, no one else can speak more eloquently from the lived experience of battling racism and sexism, and of working to uphold the fragile promises of our democracy."
..."left wing" party and Joe Biden stand for the establishment and serve only to continue disenfranchising non-white citizens for cannabis charges. Nobody should have to go to jail for a plant that humanity has used for thousands of years. Im sick of the illusion of being...
Look around you. There's nothing Biden can do yet
No one thought Biden was for Single Payer, it was widely known he was the build on ACA  guy
unironically should be the Biden campaign's tagline
I  don’t think it was a accident I think they put it out to feel people out I bet they Biden campaign asked them to there’s no way they would burn a “exclusive “ with a mistake it goes through to many people to be a mistake
Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden says VP pick coming soon, talks Detroit protests
😂😂😂😂😂 I'm not sure what cult you're referring to or you are just making us stupid ass assumption. I do recall Joe Biden in the era of mass incarceration, under the Obama Administration had the most mass shootings of all the presidents starting back from Lyndon Johnson
Biden most likely does have some type of disorder. I wish I could prove to you how wrong you are about Trump, though. Smart people shouldn't need to brag about "acing" a cognitive test. You're confusing his political instincts with business instincts, which are also terrible.
Biden and the Dems have a plan to set us back instead of moving forward and actually doing something for this planet and its people.
Rashida Taliban. She directly told people not to vote for Biden, and to keep asking him "Where's Hunter?"  (Suggesting Hunter Biden is involved in something crooked)
Thanks. I'm with you. I'd hoped for someone else but it's the hand we're dealt. We can deal with 4 years of Biden but we won't survive 4 more years of this.
'Do not hold grudges': Biden's notes reveal several talking points about Kamala Harris
An  photographer captured a pic of Joe Biden’s notes with “KAMALA HARRIS” written at the top, followed by notes like “do not hold grudges,” “talented,” “great respect for her.”  At the bottom it says “VP - highly qualified and diverse group.”An  photographer captured a pic
Wouldn’t it be something if Hillary Scholten succeeded Justin Amash in #MI03, and Biden appointed Amash as US Attorney for Michigan’s Western District?
The presumptive Democratic nominee for president Joe Biden sat down for a one-on-one interview with Local 4 on Tuesday to discuss a variety of topics.
I think the pic that leaked all but confirmed Kamala Harris being Biden’s running mate.
Let's get this straight. I'm not in love with Biden any more than I was with Hillary but I would literally vote for a block of cheese before I would EVER vote for Trump and not voting is not an option. Even if trump were a good president(he's not), he's exhausting.
Joe Biden is on  right now!!!
This is a perfect example of biased mainstream media. They tell you who to vote for when it comes to public office. Donald Trump, Joe Biden, AND Jo Jorgensen are running for President. Jorgensen is the BEST candidate BY FAR, but CNN disagrees. #JoJorgensen2020 #VoteLibertarian
Don't start telling me what to do already Biden!
Watch  broadcast: Rioting is the new peaceful protest. Joe Biden to pick VP next week.
That pretty much sums up Biden. 🤷🏾‍♀️  #NeverBiden
Unfortunately, it is more about voting President Dick Head out, than it is voting Biden in. Bottom line, Biden at least gives us somewhat of reset for this country and we can move forward from there.
We cannot let Joe Biden win. #NeverBiden   These centristholes will fight Trump, but not Biden. We can’t let them go back to brunch.   #VoteGreenOrGold  #NeverBidenNeverTrump
Next year, when the Biden Administration is in place and the GOP no longer controls the Senate, there need to be explicit laws put in place criminalizing the exact conduct of this travesty of an Administration from start to finish so this never happens again.
Sounds like you want Biden?
Kudos to the Biden campaign for the courage to take on your left flank. It will be remembered by those swing voters who wanted to make sure you didnt go over the edge
I hope Biden picks you as VP!!  I love you!!!
Nadler needs to pull his head out of his ass Antifa is nothing but criminals that are ignorant.Nadler is under Joe Biden desk slurping
Biden unveils plan for 'racial economic equality;' says VP pick coming next week
I am the Grapes of Wrath. We need to break shit, smash it. Rip this place to shreds and start over. Trump and Biden have now declared war on a common enemy, going against EVERYTHING America used to stand for. Being an Anarchist is not a crime. We're doomed.
Hey Sean Nader and Jim Jordan are both ass holes who have there head up Biden ass sniffing for glory
No need to apologize. I'm an apostle of free speech. Biden's not the firing kind. That's the other fogey.
You are an extreme leftwing demoncrate that will be brought to justice along with all your leftwing buddies, Soros, Obama, the Clinton’s, Biden, Mueller, and many many more. WE THE PEOPLE ARE WATCHING YOU AND ARE DEVISING A VERY MEASURED REACTION TO YOUR EXTREME LEFTWING IDEALS!
I think Biden is more like 85-90% shot right now.
I would feel ok if Biden’s VP ran the presidency like Dick Cheney did but like... for good. Instead of evil.
It wasn't "normal don't care", Biden/Obama were actively, knowingly destructive. They strengthened ICE &amp; expanded its actions, they enacted "Operation Border Guardian" against asylum seekers. I will not vote for people who treat other people this way--&gt;
This was all about Biden. They are doing the talking for him because of his mental state. Falls into the delusional do nothing Democrats agenda!
Did anyone see trump commercial about Mighty Joe Biden and the police not answering the phone and then his face in flames that says it all nothing but the devil he's the prince of darkness arch enemy hell born demonic savage vicious uncontrollable just a beast Biden will win VOTE
Because Biden's healthcare plan leaves 10 MILLION un-insured (and millions more under-insured and unable to go to the doctor due to costly bills) that means we'll continue to see tens of thousands of U.S. citizens die from lack of care.
Also: by being against a universal single-payer healthcare system, Biden is ensuring that more Americans die due to lack of healthcare---&gt;
Like so many other issues, Biden is a destructive Republican on the issue of immigration.
Behind every Biden supporter is an adult living in his mommy's basement.
Biden does not care about immigrants &amp; he doesn't care if Trump wins--&gt;  "Joe Biden told an attendee at a South Carolina town hall Thursday evening, "You should vote for Trump," after being criticized for deportations during the Obama administration."
Biden helped Obama deport more immigrants than any other presidential administration in history then handed that destructive infrastructure over to an idiotic racist. Why are we to believe Biden cares about immigrants now suddenly?
Biden Releases Racial Equity Plan, Omits Reparations- Is that all u got to offer Joe?⁦ ⁦ ⁦ ⁦ ⁦ ⁦ ⁦ ⁦
"Biden says he plans to deal with the US health care crisis by passing a public health insurance option. But his campaign is being funded by the same health companies that killed it when he was vice president."
What are these things that are going to be 'won' with a Biden victory?  All the things that we have been fighting for do not existent in Biden's platform.
I am not an Anarchist. It is not a crime to be one, I'm just not. Joe Biden wants to lock up people that differ from him politically, just like Trump. This is what the Dems are? Fuck American politics. Fuck Biden, Trump, the DNC, GOP and frankly anyone that's okay with this.
➡️Your job is not safe with Joe Biden. ➡️Your family is not safe with Joe Biden. ➡️Our American way of life is not safe with Joe Biden... ...because through his openly radial left wing socialist policies, he’s waging war on all three!
Well let's see who Biden picks to be VP, please be Hillary, before making any decisions.   #WhyIDontLikeTrump
Joe Biden is calling for the arrest of Anarchists now. Let it sink in. Whether you agree with any political ideology or not ain't the point, this is expressly forbidden in the U.S. and should disqualify anyone. Joe's a joke and a fucking enemy of the people. Just like Trump.
U mean who will hillary pick to do her bidding while they plan to have joe dubbed mentally ill which was their plan from jump and that’s why she tweeted man woman camera tv out that’s the Montreal Alzheimer’s test she signaled and low and behold hiden biden shows up fx
I would love to be there in January when Biden has it taken down
Im in her district. You don’t speak for us. I’m supporting Brenda. BTW, Biden won our district by over 20 points so she’s going against what we voted for
What? Sorry, not a troll. I am a pissed off former Democrat that watched Obama Biden do nothing for Flint you bish! #NeverBiden 🖕🏽
The main problem is that if the Dem establishment knows that they can win with right wing candidates, they'll only run right wing candidates. So, a vote for Biden/Harris is a vote against the Dems becoming a true left wing or even center left party  Also, not even my third choice
Dude I almost made a Biden in my pants today
As he took questions from reporters on Tuesday, Biden held notes that were captured by an AP photographer. Kamala Harris’ name was at the top, followed by five talking points. Among them:   Do not hold grudges. Campaigned with me &amp; Jill. Talented.
I refuse to vote for my own suffering. biden has told us he won't even attempt to change things for the better.  For me personally, voting for biden is like knowing I'm a serial killer's next target and still handing him a gun to shoot me in the fucking face with .
Biden’s staff must delete TikTok from their personal and work phones
Trump campaign preempts Biden speech, attacking former VP's 'racial history'

There's a bet going on...who do you think Biden will choose as his VP running mate? What's your wager 👀

To win, Biden has to show that he isn’t a hostage of the disorderly far left. He needs to denounce rioting, writes   via
It’s not false. Why is everyone in the media scared to admit this works? Are you all in with the democrats to help get Biden elected!!! Nvm. We all know that answer!
Nadler is a complete baffoon. Law and order, Dems don't want it and are willing to let law abiding citizens suffer just to get rid of Trump, enjoy your shitty utopia if Biden gets in, you'll regret it about 2 years in...
I will vote for Joe Biden if his running mate is a squirrel. I’ll still be disappointed as hell tho if he doesn’t choose Kamala
He could choose my potted pot pot plant and I would still vote for Biden. Pot smokers unite against tRump.
‘She had no remorse’: Why Kamala Harris isn't a lock for VP  via
Not flexing. Focused on one thing only; beating Trump Nov 3. Biden will win by building a broad coalition of independents and disenfranchised republicans which is precisely who this statement reaches out to. I know because I’m one of them. Wait til Nov 4 for these takes
You grow up, bish. Biden sucks. Not voting for him, the guy who wrote the crime bill? No way in hell!!! #NeverBiden
AND why are they so very nice to Biden...
Sadly I feel like I can’t fly my flag but if Biden OR a empty can of Goya beans gets elected potus in November, I’m going to fly American flags on every corner of my house AND put up a flag pole just to make the point!!! #AmericaOrTrump

Lol, you think that's being told to fuck off? You just can't handle being told the truth. If Progressives think Trump is better than Biden and need convincing, they aren't actually Progressives, and they don't actually care about policy like you claimed.
Biden did what?
Biden sucks. #NeverBiden
Biden has been in DC since he was 29. And he's going to be an "agent of change". #ClownWorld #WalkAway #MAGA2020

I am voting Green. Joe Biden is just as bad as Trump. #NeverBidenNeverTrump Joe Biden is not progressive.
I would like the the Trump to compare gas prices during his tenure compared to Obama/biden seems like lower prices for some families thats huge.
