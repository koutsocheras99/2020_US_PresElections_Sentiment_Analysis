100% . On Nov 3rd, we will end the trump plague
United States v. Donald Trump by  is the definitive inside account of what happened with the impeachment and sham trial of the worst president in U.S. history. A great read!
Ah yes, all the men I know are telling an anime trump bot to grow up. I’m sure your message will get across and Trump_owo will change their ways.
Hell, YES! I am ready to vote! Don’t think Trump realizes that without CIVID there’d be many more of us out there protesting his lack of leadership.
Donald Trump should resign (pass it on) #TrumpFailsAmerica #TrumpResignNow
To be clear: it’s now the TRUMP ECONOMY &amp; TRUMP VIRUS. — TRUMP ECONOMY = 32 million unemployed; 15+ million to lose  assistance;  51% of households w/ lower income; 33% drop in GDP. — TRUMP PANDEMIC = 152,000 Covid deaths; 72,000 new cases; 4.5 million cases total.—NEVER FORGET.
Lock-up Flynn’s lying, treasonous ass. — “U.S. Appeals Court Will Reconsider Dismissal of Case Against Former Trump Security Adviser Flynn” (Wall Street Journal)
SINCE TRUMP ONLY LIKES TO SPEAK IN SUPERLATIVES — THE GREATEST DEPRESSION
For once in my lifetime......... “McConnell and other top Republican officials rebuff Trump suggestion to delay the Nov. 3 election” (The Washington Post)
This was always going to be the end result of a Donald trump presidency and every republican say by and let this happen.
I’m not gonna bother arguing. I implore you; however, to look at the policy between Biden and Trump when it comes to race. You’ll see which one has a stronger anti-racist mindset. Look at what they say policy-wise, disregard your bias, then say who’s racist.
Hey Trump Virus supporters, howda ya like them apples? Trump’s really run the economy into the ditch this time! — “Dow drops 400 points amid record GDP decline, tech shares fall” (CNBC)
I’m waiting for a full season of episodes on  of Trump’s criminality. #TrumpIsACriminal #TrumpTheBiggestConManOfAllTime
DONALD TRUMP’S ECONOMY — US GDP shrank 32.9% last quarter. Workers &amp; businesses “walloped.” That’s the largest quarterly plunge since the 1929 Great Depression. — SO HOW ARE WE LIKING THE TRUMP VIRUS ECONOMY NOW?
Plus, he’s just a famous face that died from it. How many other Trump rally-goers have also died, or will die, that did not wear masks or socially distance? He didn’t have to die. Trump is responsible.
Donald Trump should resign! Plus, what she said!!! 👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻
THE TRUMP VIRUS ECONOMY — 32 million American families unemployed: 17 million=state unemployment; 15 million=pandemic unemployment which expires Saturday. US Census Bureau reports 51.1% of American households have lost employment income. TRUMP’S ECONOMY.
And how many BILLIONS have they gotten from Trump you wind bag!  How about you tell us what the drug companies have spent of their own money vs what they got from the gov't for COVID only!
Trump trolling the liberals and their media propaganda hacks is awesome. The meltdown will be spectacular.  Just sit back and watch.  😂😂😂
When will GOP Members of Congress finally have the guts to step up on behalf of Americans? Trump is an out of control dictator!
Trump trolling the left and MSM is awesome.  The foolish left and their propaganda leftist media hacks fall for it every single time.  Watching the meltdown will be spectacular 😂😂😂

The Trump grift goes on....
Trump returns to old ways, pushes unproven coronavirus treatment
It’s like he read Mary Trump’s book and wants to show everyone how spot-on she is🤪
Trump Axios interview’s absolutely outrageous. The whole world knows about Putin’s plot to kill our troops. We’re expected to believe Trump didn’t know/wasn’t briefed? For God’s sake, what’s Putin have on Trump: Pictures w/ Russian hookers? A loan coming due? Trump Hotel rights?
I know makes you wonder about his judgment and logic! Oh sure this lady believes in demons and night time sex with demons and Trump thinks she’s an important voice to talk about the virus! What a no minded 💩😡
Absolutely right. Trump said in interview that Russia’s plot to assassinate American troops “Was not brought to my desk“ by staff. That’s absolute bullshit—a boldface lie. Attacks on troops in combat zones are always escalated to the president. TRUMP DOESN’T CARE ABOUT AMERICA.
TRUMP MUST GO!
The Cong. Gohmert news keeps getting worse. 1) He never informed staff he had the Trump Virus; they learned about it from news reports. 2) Gohmert sleeps in his office; so he’ll continue exposing people during his 14 day quarantine. WHAT A SELFISH, DISGUSTING PIG—GOHMERT MUST GO
Another win for president Trump.
And it's reality. Do your research. The first day that Trump announced taking over the Virus cases the CDC admitted to faking covid deaths. Including car crashes, strokes ect. Also my buddy is a nurse who was literally in charge of counting cases in ND and says its all BS.
Trump virus is your undoing
He’s an absolutely selfish prick. He could care less if he gives somebody else the Trump Virus. Wondering if Gohmert can be defeated? Janet?
People condemned  when she called half of  supporters "deplorables", While Trump accuses his opponents of hating America.  Send Trump his eviction notice on November 3, 2020.  #DumpTrump
My takeaway is questioning why the owner possesses a bust of Trump on the toilet. 😶
Agree! But will add that Gohmert and Trump are running neck-&amp;-neck for the biggest dip shits in the world.
Didn’t Trump have a school? How did that go?
If for no other reason, you’d think Trump would deal with the Trump Virus to save his almighty “economy.” The Fed Reserve just said: “The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on employment.... &amp; poses considerable risks to the economic outlook.”
They don't want to defund the police they want to abolish them so they can create an inquisition of their new communist state.
Trump needs to activate the military and use lethal force against Antifa. They are trying to destroy our country to install communism and they are using BLM to do it.
I’ll trust sources like Harvard, Oxford, the CDC, the WHO, Licensed doctors, certified clinics, and common sense over this obviously bias hackery.    Masks work. Even trump and top level republicans (Mitch McConnell) said masks were “patriotic”.
Is almost 5 trillion and only going up! He blames everyone but his horrible reaction to Covid! The States doing the worst our all run by Republican governors! That have been loyal to Trump! That’s what I see! I go by my eyes and ears! Not what comes out of Trumps mouth!
I can’t stand the way Trump talks everyone’s terrible! The people curing trouble are not anybody but white supremacy and neo-nazis that Trump has put out there to make protesters look bad! He is playing games with our lives and our livelihood for 3 1/2 yrs now! Our country’s debt
Watching cartoons is a much better use of your time at this point. Trump, Barr, et al, are fencing a hell of a reckoning this year and they know it. The childish antics, looting of the US Treasury, will ramp up until the Biden Administration, D majority Senate takes over in Jan.
What a whack job this doctor is — pure voodoo medicine. Alien sperm: must say I didn’t see that one coming. Next thing we know Trump will claim that a sorcerer waving a dead chicken over a virus patient is an even better way to cure the Trump virus.
#Polling Here is a note from a polling group: "The Trafalgar group weights its polls to account for “social desirability bias,” or the so-called shy Trump voters who are embarrassed to tell pollsters that they support the president."  - So that can be accounted for in a poll????

Old Trump wine in not very old Trump bottles in Trump v. Vance. And of course a delaying tactic on the grand jury subpoena.
So, William Barr, are you going to show up this time? Here's some more questions from yours truly and  Tomorrow 10 AM. Bright eyed and bushy tailed.  Trump's no-show Attorney General Barr must testify to Congress—or resign
So, why doesn't  a/k/a Loophole Man want Manhattan D.A Cyrus Vance -- or Congress or the American people -- to see those tax returns? His tax "avoision" game has been going on for decades and he doesn't want us to know about it.
Tax "avoision" is a term American academics threw around a lot in the 1990s to discuss marginally legal/illegal behavior, but it has been used in academic publications since 1979, and by Fred and Donald Trump's family before that.  What's the remedy for "avoision"?  Jail.

We debating a question we had not previously contemplated. Is Trump even smart enough to lie?
Let’s straighten out your delusion. The swamp was the Mitch McConnell Paul Ryan swamp. That changed when Ryan lost/left and Trump appeared. Trump swilled Bill Barr in and created the cesspool!! We now really need to drain the cesspool!!! You’ve been schooled!!
And how do you think it could be prevented? Americans actually social distancing? Trump has nothing to do with that. He closed the US while Fauci said "it's safe to keep open" oh, and 22% of our deaths are from one state.
Except this likely wouldn’t happen to Biden if he became president, since he already has policy which would directly help these communities. Part of the reason these happened in the first place was due to trump not addressing key racial issues (ex: disproportionat covid deaths)
No wonder he won’t share his tax returns. Here’s Trump taxes 101 using a term coined back in the 1970’s....
He demanded "presidential immunity." The prosecutor said no. I filed an amicus brief with  against "presidential immunity." The Supreme Court gave him no immunity.  still won't comply. No man is above the law. He must go.

Anyone believing indictments are coming down regarding either Trump’s Ukrainian scandal or origins of the Russian investigation are living in a fool’s paradise.  Mueller has confirmed that there was Russian interference which helped Trump and hurt Clinton.
Trump is so easy to read.
Nevertheless, use of the Logan Act was totally appropriate.  Flynn convinced Kislyak not to retaliate against Obama’s sanctions, promising the sanctions would be removed once Obama was out of office. Trump actually tried to do this his first week in office - but he was stopped.
Trump is currently insulated from prosecution by virtue of being “president,” i.e., you can’t indict a sitting president.  Once he’s removed from office, the SDNY will be ready and waiting to act on charges referred to it by the Mueller investigation.
Mueller found other contacts with Russia, such as the sharing of polling data about Midwestern states where Trump later won upset victories, conversations with the Russian ambassador to influence Russia’s response to sanctions /1
Mueller also wrote that the “investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit from information stolen and released through Russian efforts.”
Mueller spent almost 200 pages describing numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump Campaign. He found that a Russian entity carried out a social media campaign favoring Trump and disparagng Clinton and that Russia hacked the DNC and released stolen documents.
October surprise won’t be kind to Traitor Trump. Just like every month so far this year.

"The Senate must be prepared to go to the mat to enforce any subpoenas it issues, or the impeachment process itself will serve to weaken congressional authority ..."    issued no subpoenas, called no witnesses. U.S. v. Trump by   Ditch Mitch!
Sure, that may be a reason; however, you can not deny the fact that Trump’s leadership exacerbated the problem. He loves the fight, and he has tries to trade blows with people that are rightfully upset at a system that wronged them. There are multiple factors to this.
In the second half of this book we discuss why extreme narcissist  is a danger to our Republic as long as he is in the White House. In the first half of the book we discuss what it is about ourselves that put him there in the first place.

"By sending articles of impeachment to the Senate without having countered the president’s interference with House proceedings, Democratic leaders lost an opportunity."   The House didn't get all the evidence, then they reduced the charges!
I am assuming Trump invited himself to throw out the first pitch and the Yankees said no fucking way.
and  are the last holdouts on Trump undergoing a presidential pivot. My guess is they have the stories written and on file. Waiting.
The House reduced the charges! This and other fascinating revelations in a new book by  I had the pleasure of reading an advance copy over the weekend. Available Tuesday!  Democrats narrowed Trump impeachment articles from 10 to 2, book claims
“We are witnessing a crisis of democracy that is perfectly acceptable to a significant portion of the population — as long as it hurts their enemies.”
“...advisers began presenting Trump with maps and data showing spikes in coronavirus cases among ‘our people’ in Republican states, a senior administration official said. This new approach seemed to resonate, as he hewed closely to pre-scripted remarks in...briefings last week”.

The #MeToo movement’s goal was to take women’s complaints seriously.  No one said that women are to be believed no matter what. Trump has over two dozen women who’ve complained for decades about his sexual assaults, and yet his base pretends they don’t exist.
He can talk the talk but not walk the walk.  How was Trump Modeling Agency not an exercise in human slavery?  Recruit young foreigners without work papers, have them lie to officials, stuff them in vermin-infested apartments, charge them exhorbitant rent?

One important difference between Trump's debt figures and Obama's is that Trump has added a massive amount of debt while the US economy has been strong, whereas Obama took over during the depths of the financial crisis. TRUMP PROMISED TO ELIMINATE THE DEBT IN 8 YEARS.
“Obama’s multitrillion-dollar spend-and-borrow policies ...”  Obama added $9 trillion over 8 years when the economy he was handed was careening into a Major Depression.  Trump has added $6.5 trillion to the debt, in spite of being handed a stable economy and full employment.

Also shows why Trump is sending federal officers to Michigan. He wants to drive fear and division. But we’re gonna divide Trump from the White House instead, preferably by force when the Secret Service throws his ass out.
#EveryoneHatesTrumpsFuckingGuts with all my fucking guts do I despise fucking trump.
Fake president fake tears. Give us a break trump.
The Trump grift goes on....
Awww it’s so cute how they complain about being disliked...just like they’re Fuhrer Trump.
Where does tRump find these moron?
tRump is a traitor!
Seattle police union leader hits back after mayor claims Trump using feds as 'dry run for martial law'
And his personal doctor will be the woman from Houston who impressed tRump even though he doesn’t know her.
My takeaway is questioning why the owner possesses a bust of Trump on the toilet. 😶
They don't want to defund the police they want to abolish them so they can create an inquisition of their new communist state.
Trump needs to activate the military and use lethal force against Antifa. They are trying to destroy our country to install communism and they are using BLM to do it.
tRump is the delinquent
The elderly Trump’s dementia is acting up again
Is almost 5 trillion and only going up! He blames everyone but his horrible reaction to Covid! The States doing the worst our all run by Republican governors! That have been loyal to Trump! That’s what I see! I go by my eyes and ears! Not what comes out of Trumps mouth!
I can’t stand the way Trump talks everyone’s terrible! The people curing trouble are not anybody but white supremacy and neo-nazis that Trump has put out there to make protesters look bad! He is playing games with our lives and our livelihood for 3 1/2 yrs now! Our country’s debt
Trump family endorses Covid doctor who believes in alien DNA, demon sperm, Hydroxychloroquine - NZ Herald
#Polling Here is a note from a polling group: "The Trafalgar group weights its polls to account for “social desirability bias,” or the so-called shy Trump voters who are embarrassed to tell pollsters that they support the president."  - So that can be accounted for in a poll????
What’s much richer is you supporting a sick bastard and traitor like Barr who is as corrupt as IMPOTUS by association and his silence as well as yours regarding our troops that Putin put bounties on, DRAFT DODGING TRAITOR trump does NOTHING! Firing squad for all u traitors!
White supremacists try to incite violence, which explains why Trump sends Fed forces to Portland.
#Covid19 Trump says, "Nobody likes me." -- the first utterance in months that is the truth.

President Donald Trump reportedly owns a stake in a company that produces hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malaria drug he has repeatedly touted as a coronavirus treatment even though his experts say there’s no strong evidence it works.

I can’t even express my disdain of the current political culture of the US. Half of the right has abandoned their conservative principles to suck up to/defend Trump (who is a populist, not a conservative). Meanwhile the left is going further and further left, &amp; has a mindset 1/
Trump deploy the military to end Antifa they want to install communism.
No women I know are "for Trump". Nada. Not a single one. A couple women friends voted for him in 2016 but won't make that mistake again.
Well she definitely defends and lies for Trump like she’s paid by him.
tRump’s partner in crime temporarily stumped. This was not a trick question.
So is the elderly Trump’s dementia acting up again today?
Me: I've been so busy today, I wonder what's going on in the world :::opens Twitter::: Trump: 👇🏾
👆This tweet right here is a sign of  disconnection from reality. A common illness amongst the body of Trump supporters. If a friend or loved one suffers from dfr please be help them find the help they need. Resources are.........I'll get back to you.
No "if" about it, President Trump WILL WIN! You on the other hand will never keep your word on anything.
Todd - Rundgren - Tin Foil Hat (feat. Donald Fagen) [Official Video]   This song is amazing, it sounds just like vintage #SteelyDan #YachtRock. Trump made 70s soft rock great again, I’ll give him credit for that much.
Trump is living in a world where he believes he is a god and everyone should follow him.  He prays in the weak minded similar to the way a cult leader go about growing his congregation. Unfortunately everyone in the cult dies in the end.
A lot of high up Dems have big money and ties to big pharma companies, so they’re invested for the vaccine to come out and generate millions/billions of $. The solution of HCQ would halt this. Also Trump said it would work, so naturally they oppose it
LOL - so you are dismissing the very recent poll that said Trump was 13 down in MN? Keep trying.
#CD1 Quote from Hagedorn: “This is the Armageddon of all elections. Unfortunately, if we lose, I think we lose the country as the Founding Fathers envisioned it. We can’t lose. We must win.” -- So the Founding Fathers would approve of your mentor, Donald Trump? Really?
I’m not a fan of Trump Jr. either, but this censorship is wrong.
My sister lost her teaching job when they cut the special education programs.  I blame a lot of our collective ignorance on Regan. His mental health reforms made crime and homelessness worse. He tried to destroy labor unions. He ignored the AIDS crisis. Kind of like Trump &amp; covid
Mini-Trump talks about “my body my choice” and then immediately calls for an end to abortion. Being a hypocrite used to immediately be understood as being wrong. Now GOP morons like this wear hypocrisy as a badge of honor.
Nixon era was rough. Regan era we lost jobs &amp; almost lost our home. Trump era is like hell on earth.
Trump family products are made in China!
Following up on my previous tweet, everyone read the responses in this thread. HCQ seems like it was immediately cancelled by Dems merely bc Trump suggested it and well, of course, “Orange man bad”. Stop being sheep
As long as Joe doesn’t pick someone with the last name Trump, I’m in. Not questioning it, just getting my butt to the voting booth on Election Day.
#Unity Trump says he won't be paying is respects to John Lewis. Biden did. That tells you all you need to know about who will unite this country.
Only positive things said about Trump should be able to trend.
Don’t you think they will continue after trump wins again ?
Let’s straighten out your delusion. The swamp was the Mitch McConnell Paul Ryan swamp. That changed when Ryan lost/left and Trump appeared. Trump swilled Bill Barr in and created the cesspool!! We now really need to drain the cesspool!!! You’ve been schooled!!
That was posted by Mary Anne Trump, she is freaking hilarious! And spot on!
I’m a Democrat so I always vote for the Democratic candidate. But of course trump is the worst president ever which makes any decision pretty easy.
Been debunked by progressives and they hate trump more than you do.
That's just it...you can not...I'm willing to bet within about a week they will be reporting there numbers are below say 6k and how it's a miracle turnaround due to Trump....
#Covid19 Trump may have passed the cognitive test but he still remains hopelessly stupid.
Trump wasn’t defeated in 2016, as much as I wish he was. Get your sentence structure right if you hope to influence people.
And tRump lives in a fantasy world
Daily reminder: Yes, you are in charge of your own health. But that opinion does not trump medical research. unless you have a vast understanding of interpreting statistics &amp; medical jargon &amp; how the body works. So it’s easier if you just listen to the professionals around you.

“...advisers began presenting Trump with maps and data showing spikes in coronavirus cases among ‘our people’ in Republican states, a senior administration official said. This new approach seemed to resonate, as he hewed closely to pre-scripted remarks in...briefings last week”.
Joe! Kesha Bottoms! Is a strong women! I love her and a lot of people I been talking to love her! She’s my choice for VP just saying! I know it’s your choice! Which I’ll respect totally! I love the way she speaks! She’ll go up against Trump! She does now! Soon to know! Who?
There is no official confirmation of this damage happened in Texas due to the hurricane. Suspect this is an old video resurfacing from an incident in California .
I know trump. He has already started his move 3 months ago on mail in ballots. I thought we were safe by sending our votes by mail, but I knew he'd pull some shit.
It is from Mary Anne Trump's Facebook page.
Excuse me, but didn't tRump tell Xi re-education camps "are the right thing to do".
How many ways does the universe have to tell you? There is evil and its here in trump.
can’t wait for Trump to be indicted for extortion of Ukraine. Do the secret service have to stand in Trumps cell with him, or do they stand outside? Rangers Lead The Way!
Be careful they left have already started murdering people who support Trump.
The Republicans in the Senate had an opportunity to remove Trump from office and chose not to do that. Everyone of them has blood on their hands.
The biggest problem is that the Republican Party(by blindly supporting trump) has lost their support of the military. That is the reason you fear absentee ballots
Really? Have you drunk some different Kool Aid? Your party has been pushing mail in voting within the party for years. Just because Trump says its a fraud means nothing. He lies every single day.
Blaming the protests on trump...... good luck with life
You mean the Trump Virus
This is how the liberals work. It’s okay to murder black men, if they don’t have their “I hate America “ agenda. Why doesn’t this black life matter? 👇👇👇👇👇👇👇.
Fellow Americans, it is literally happening right now. #IMPOTUS Trump has actually turned our country into a George Orwell novel. 😬 If we somehow get to November still alive, #VoteForOurLives #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
The Nazi party was a fascist organization. Which trump is defiantly emulating with his foreign relations, domestic policies, and his attacks on media. Use words you actually understand in your tweets.
Bwahahaha!!! These liberal idiots think Carlin was talking about Trump when he was talking about ALL politicians. Even the warmongering vultures they worship so much.  Don’t bastardize Carlin. He hated all of them.
Quick signature: Tell the Trump administration and Congress to protect the CDC and fund testing and contact tracing!
My husband's a custom cabinet builder/woodworker. He spends everyday talking real loud and clear to all the tradesmen he works with(whether they want to listen or not) about Trump's mishandling of literally everything and why the country needs Biden. He knows we need their votes.
So Trump is fine with Russia “Influencing” the election?  Sounds like some traitorous BS coming from
This EO is useless. Once again showing that Trump is incapable of making a deal with Congress or pharmaceutical industry.   He doesn’t care about lower drug prices. He won’t actually put up a fight with Big Pharma. He’ll just sign a piece of paper and pretend it’s a win.   #Fraud
Trump needs to take a seat.
But lot of them blacks that vote for YE are probably gonna vote Trump!! 😂 it might hurt Trump more than Biden.. JS
Waking up to the Trump outrage of the day. Trump gestapo attacking moms, vets &amp; peaceful protesters. 146,463 Americans dead from presidential incompetence. Nazis in Minnesota. Crickets on the Russian bounties for killing US service people. The country divided. #100DaysToBiden
I hear Susan is concerned about Trump's use of government forces against peaceful demonstrators.
Reagan Foundation asks Trump campaign, RNC to stop using former president's name to raise money
Trump didn’t do shit for diabetics. Sure it’s a step in the right direction... but it generally only helps like 3% of us. Not worth the hype it’s getting lol  still can’t afford my insulin ✨ #Americaisntgreat
Glad to see that President Trump will be sending federal agents to Seattle to restore law and order after a so-called "peaceful protest" has turned into another riot. We need criminals to held accountable for their actions.
Of course the guy is wearing a Trump shirt lol. I hope someone walked up to them a yelled in there face. 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
So now instead of reporting to the public as to the rising of Covid the CDC will have to report to the Trump administration!! My patience.. God only you!! The country needs you Lord!! Please help us!!
Just another Case of Trumpism! She said it herself! I’m so tired of the cult mentality that’s come out of Trump supporters! Fox News is also part of the problem! There bringing this kind of crazy’s out of the woodwork like cockroaches!
What is amazing about this photo is that Brett Favre is actually OLDER than Donald Trump and he looks like he is 30 years younger. SAD.
Anything to get trump out!!!!! Go early catch a plane, go to Georgia and stand with them who are intimidated not to vote.
I have a Devon Nunes joke, but DONALD TRUMP NUDE PICS!

We have Trump/Republican death panels in Texas now! Unbelievable!!!!
The civil war has been started by the left because she lost. 3.5 years of a temper tantrum! Don’t blame your horrific behavior on Trump.
American Catastrophe Through German Eyes
might want to get started on that Health Care Bill too with the Senate since the clock’s ticking on that promised deadline from Trump. 8/2 tick tock.
I always find it amusing that ppl on the left read headlines like this that obviously are, ya know.. good for everyone, and allow their blind hatred for Trump to conjure up and dish out a stupid ass tweet like this. It could say “Trump cured cancer” and you’d say “ImPeAcH HiM”
One case of Covid came from China!  The rest are from presidential incompetence. You and Trump are endangering my Korean adopted nieces by racially profiling.
It would be one of the quickest bills ever signed into law since neither the House or Senate has voted on it yet. It’s almost like a Bill doesn’t exist...except in Trump’s cognitively impaired head.
Apparently a lot of people have thought differently for a pretty long time.  But I did make it a point not to get "Fuck You" tattooed on my forehead. But Trump wasn't president then. 😹  The oldest tattooed human skin was found on Ötzi the Iceman, dated between 3370 &amp; 3100 BC.
an entirely separate situation. So no, the analogy is not only not apt, it's eniterly irrelevant. Killing a bear does not mean he has the nut sack to stand up to Moscow Mitch or the Repulican majority.  Afain, I am anti-Trump, but killing a bear has NOTHING to do with his....
Are you saying that the past four years there have been no children in cages? If there have been, is it enough for Trump to pass the blame to someone else, rather than act on it? It is my recollection that he said separating the children from their parents would be a deterrent.
Sure because even though she expects Trump to lose it could set her up well for 24.
So Ted if he contributed to Trump this would be fine. I know of no legal barrier for this gentleman making a personal contribution.
...it could have been controlled sooner.  Nobody is saying Trump created a virus and unleashed it, but every other country has been able to control it, or at least slow it down severely.  140k people DEAD unconscionable.
Remember death panels? tRump's incompetence has lead to this.
I think that Trump should escort him in the building and shake hands with the kids as they enter.
LOL she actually said Selfless when referring to Trump. OMG I literally can’t stop laughing.   Gotta give up on Politics and get this crazy lady into a writer’s room instead.   Selfless...I’m dying over here 🤣🤣
How f***** stupid do you have to be? Powers are separated from federal to state government. That’s all happening bc the state leadership (All Democrats, crazy isn’t it?) allowed it to happen. Saying trump caused that just shows how intellectually challenged you are
are you aware of the legislation signed by W Bush in 2007,  ?  Presidential Directive 51.  Correct me if I’m wrong- but if enacted- Trump WON’T have to leave the White House until “the crisis” is over?  Allowing Pelosi and companies worst fears to be realized.
Remember death panels. Thanks to tRump's stupidity they are real now.
The elderly Trump’s dementia is acting up again
I say open schools 🏫 and if teachers 👩‍🏫 will not go back to work. Hire better ones! Trump 2020🇺🇸📣❤️💙❤️🧢
I’m not sure  wants to talk about failure while endorsing Trump.
Trump demands you send your kids back to reopened schools but not Baron. Reminder that Trump doesn’t care about the health and well being of any child. He wants your children to die just so he can reopen the economy and take another victory lap.   #TrumpKillsChildren
Has anyone ever seen a photo of Trump playing with his kids or grandkids?   Except Ivanka?
I see you are talking about Trump again...totally agree.
Glad to see there are smart people in the world the realize Trump had nothing to do with the economy! Obama worked his ass off to undo the mess the Republicans put us in under the bush administration! And know Trump has distort us will be in the most debt ever in history 5 trill.
While I agree for the most part, Trump has set a new precedent for vile, awful, and 💩 as a politician. We as citizens deserve &amp; demand better out of the Oval Office!
Trump also removed George W and Bill fun fact
Trumps America is the right America where law and order are still important. The Democrats have no power left than to help cause chaos in inner cities, Funded anarchy. Your risking a civil war with an elected Biden. Trump is the anti establishment and the dems dont like it boohoo
Will the Yankees take a knee on the day trump throws out the 1st pitch?
Until they get fired by Trump
It’s wild that Republicans whipped themselves into hysteria saying President Obama was going to create death panels and use federal police to violate Constitutional rights, but when it’s *actually happening* under Trump, they’ve got nothing.
Is he showcasing the last remaining trump supporters with that chart?
trump just thanked “Mario” Rivera for attending his presser today
All these stimulus packages and heavy spending by the trump administration is going to cause long lasting problems to the economy well after he leave office.
Does that mean I am black if I vote for Trump?
Yeah but it gonna take him the first 2 years to clean up all of trump's shit.
Trump is so anxious to magnify his law and order schtick, that in a campaign ad he used six year old video from Ukraine as evidence of American unrest. You’re a loser, Cadet Bonespurs!
Trump failed miserably at coronavirus; with election looming, he has now decided to put on a big show that he’s the “law and order” president:by sending out his jackbooted secret police, trying to stir up the protesters (who have a Constitutional right to peacefully protest).
Oh, you mean the current america under Donald Trump?
Trump Will Eventually Disappear
I can’t believe all these Trump ads that are like, “this is what Biden’s America would look like”, while showing very real footage from Trump’s America. What is the game there? Does Trump think the rest of us have dementia too? People buy this shit??
Recently watched failed reality TV show host donald trump, former head of failed Trump steaks, trying to justify his sudden love of the USA, who last night was bragging about taking a cognitive screening. Love watching pathetic Trump squirm!
It sounds like projection to me.  Like when they confidently predicted that Trump wouldn't concede the election when he lost, followed by him winning, Hillary's delayed concession speech, then "NOT MY PRESIDENT!"  If he loses, no way he's staying.  That's just not happening.
Right, like Trump actually listens to his advisors!
Y’all are literally taking headlines out of the Trump administration and substituting Biden for Trump.  You’re so bad at this.
It numbs my mind that some people are just realizing that Trump is batshit insane, a terrible person and horrible president. What did it take to realize that? Sending facist troops into cities? Trying to gut the ACA in the middle of a pandemic?  Come on. Wake up. Pay attention.
Trump never said that idiot! Read the transcript of the call!
Donald Trumps son didn’t take millions of dollars from crooked Iranian co. Joe Bidens son did! No did Trump pay  tax $ to Iran to drop investigations into his son. Trump son also did not take 1 1/2 billion in investment money from a bank owned by the Chinese communist party. Fact
“School Choice” apparently doesn’t including choosing not to send kids back into the COVIDE minefield of classrooms though.   Trump wants to see your children die
But medical and public health experts stress that the cognitive exam is not what Trump seems to think it is — an indicator of IQ or a cudgel to be wielded against a political opponent like a debate challenge. Experts say the president’s fixation on the (1/2)
Reading trump gives me a headache 🤕. Well it’s good to know the president doesn’t have late stage Alzheimers and that he’s only really stupid.
He said something really stupid and flase and then discusses something that is true but has been said before by far more qualified black candidates and they said it better too. Stop acting like he’s a genius. This is the same guy who was wearing a Maga hat hanging with Trump
he says, “HT didn’t free slave”(not true). The 2nd comment he had he has a pointbut it’s nothing anyone running for office hasn’t said before especially for a candidate who is black but was accused of being a “cop” while Kanye went around wearing a Maga cap and hanging with Trump
hmmm, i might have? but don't recall it.  There's one where it shows an old lady trying to call 911 as somebody breaks in, but due to defunding, nobody there to answer, so guy breaks in and attacks grandma. "I'm Trump and I approve purple monkey dishwasher"
Trump will probably respond by sending more officers or Military.
Looks like Trump's America to me.
Please..... I can't stand Trump another minute.
You know that bastard TRUMP gave her a couple million for her trouble.
you’re going to be held accountable for these actions after we vote Trump out. You will be in the history books for this. Resign and save your reputation! Rangers Lead The Way!!!!
Donald trump nifht has well he speaking Chinese - the actions don’t match the rhetoric. This is true for most politicians, some journalists and the media they represent.  This paradigm will end soon enough, hopefully real soon
It's already too late. She's done too much damage green lighting everything Trump wanted.
Why is Trump bragging about contributing to the lynching, murdering and oppression of Black Americans?
It already is because this is Trump’s work in progress  Literally, what stupid MFer thought this would be a good idea for a tweet?
Trump probably gave her a couple million for her trouble
So testing and tracing works for the White House, but not for Americans since Trump wants to gut funding.    defend your hypocrisy or STFU
But in actuality, it is Trump's America. This shit has never happened at this level in my 42 years until Trump. Madness.

Trump, the gift who keeps on giving.
Trump's motto, "If you can't beat em, gas em".
It truly is on GOP at this point. They could have removed Trump at any time. Trump is a child with a dangerous weapon in his hands and Republicans are the negligent parents letting him harm others.
Almost every other country had actual leadership and it's under control. We had Trump and the difference is very disturbing.
The wall of moms shouldnt have been in the fucking street when they knew what was coming. Trump has stated this will not stand. Democrats in these cities have failed their citizens. They have burned, pilliaged, and defaced these cities for weeks. They are anarchists not angels!
It's about time! These so called protesters are nothing but anti american thugs who have caused fires, vandalism, and attempted anarchy. They have thwarted the message of police reform after George Floyd and are spitting on his memory. Trump is doing the job Democrats wont.
Any job Trump hands out at this point is “seasonal”.
...Trump is now deploying secret police to cities—whose residents largely oppose him—to kidnap people people who’ve taken to the streets to demonstrate against racism.
Also, Trump said masks are patriotic! Which side are you on?
Classy as always from a Trump supporter.BREAKING NEWS....Barron Trump DNA testing shows he isn't orange, but is Green.  Evidence of Alien DNA....Donald you should seek child support from the little green man
Here you Ginger, same with my brother, a Dr. Who wore same PPE for 15 hours because they had none and Trump said there weren't any shortages   My heart goes out to you and your family truly.
Please enlighten Meghan to the fact that the conservatives she once knew, are no more! Trump's senators, administration, and many state governors are in his pocket. They follow a Blind leader!
So everybody go on vacation in November and vote by Absentee instead.  Trump would then blame that and claim fraud...guy does everything to bail him and his friends out just not the American people
BREAKING NEWS....DNA Testing of Barron Trump shows that his skin tone isn't Orange, but Green....Alien DNA discovered, proving Trump wasn't the father.
Trump again makes himself bigger than the law by threatening to delay the election...which he doesn't have the power to do.  But when you pardon your criminal friends it's understandable why he thinks he can
Trump Fears #TheButtercreamDream

Im voting for Trump. Haaaahaaa
You dont even know where youre at.  Scared to debate Trump, what kind of leader is afraid to debate. Lol. Hahahahahahaha
You had my vote until I saw your negative Ilhan-bashing ads.  I do not want a nasty-Trump-like person leading my district.  Minneapolis is better than that - Minnesota is NICE. My vote goes to Ilhan. (So does my husbands). #MeanPeopleSuck
And THAT ladies and gentlemen should be at least 33% of the reason you’re NOT going to vote for this shitshow called Trump on 11/3! #JoeBidenForPresident2020
Let's talk about Trump's call to suspend the elections....  via
I actually don’t mind Donald Trump my tweeds I just think he is divisive as all get out and doesn’t have a lot of wisdom
Donald Trump hasn’t had a hard day in his life. He has always had money and a supporting cast. Why would people not see that? I think trumpers do see something in him that they can relate to. The fearlessness, the ability to do what one wants. They like freedom and guns.
This might be a controversial take but I think that a lot of trumper are smarter or have more wisdom than Donald Trump who they believe in. Think about that for a second.
Brutal but fair.  #COVID19 #Trump
I didn't screen cap but the Q's were CD5, likely vote screen, Trump 1-10, Biden 1-10, who you voted for in 2016, demo questions. No messaging.
I don't think Trump realizes the sky is blue and his days in office are numbered.
Your Friday Briefing
Stringing together two related, coherent thoughts is really asking a lot of Donald Trump.
Wait!  They went home?  How is Donnie going to be able to sign the health care bill he promised would happen in two weeks?  I'm crushed that Trump lied to us.  Shocked.  I'm so shocked.
Did you not say MONTHS AGO....testing needs to be done anyone who wants it can get it, it will be easy and accessible.  THEN WHY DO YOU GET TESTED EVERY DAY with SAME DAY RESULTS and we wait 14 days or more?  You said you'd have a plan. YET you've NEVER disclosed one. TRUMP=LIAR
I wish you people would spend even 10% of the energy you use to get worked up about Trump on critically reviewing Walz. I’d take 5%.
Trump unmasked
Trump’s Tulsa rally has its first confirmed kill. 😡🤬  Herman Cain attended. Got Covid and has died. #TrumpKilledHermanCain
What a joke. "The hard left is angry". Everyone who isn't a white supremacist, racist, doesn't want to die of COVID-19, cares about other people, wants equal rights for all, wants healthcare for all and much more is angry with republicans. You're over.
Trump caused me to drive into the pool.
Wow Liz, just starting to like you then you have to make a comment about Democrats.  Republicans cheat too....just like tRump did in the last election.  Clean up your own effing house before you start knocking on someone else's door!
I’d say delay on the basis that I want to be more sure the outcome isn’t manipulated because I think Trump will win again
I had cataract surgery today, 122/68 - which surprised me a lot. Because the news is horrible with record setting COVID deaths every day and more to come. Maybe it's the prospect of a huge loss for Trump in just over three months that calms me.
Tried to feel sorry for a second, but what a fucking dumbass to go to that Trump rally, let alone not wear a mask. Oh AND he beat stage 4 cancer?!? Sheesh. The stupidity.
Yeah, he left that part out, didn't he? As always. His Tulsa embarrassment is what caused this. There'll be more, though they won't get this kind of attention. Trump is a walking death sentence if you're anywhere near what he is doing. Literally.
Yikes 😬  But he can't do that though too, congress should and will definitely not do this.  But in other context, Trump will throw anything as a curveball for this election. Like possibly not wanting to accept if he loses.  So get out there, and vote for Biden. Please.
THIS is the reason behind Trump's tweet about delaying the election. His only reason for being is the "great" economy. He'd need to delay the election for years for that to help him because this will be a slow recovery. He's desperate and losing.
God is love? Thats a pretty big accusation to accuse trump of his death. You couldn't keep politics out of it, could you? You are awesome and I am sure your god approves
I won't celebrate this, who would? But, I do want to note that no one is immune to this disease despite the never ending efforts of Trump to pretend it is not laying waste to America. The nation is in grave danger. Reopening schools would make it worse.
You mean like your FAKE words how We've got the virus under control"?  Trump you're so mixed up in the head it's scary to think you're the President....I'll never vote for you unless it's putting you in JAIL or an INSANE ASYLUM because either works for the WORLD
If you’re expecting one, you don’t know Trump very well.
Cause the stuff that Donald trump is doing is very supportive for the economy and the unemployment rates were at their all time low.(COVID messed it all up but we r starting to get back on track) he just does a lot of good stuff but the media doesn’t care about it for some reason
So in other words, trump is a failure
(Run campaign like Trump Org. So sue me!)   Trump campaign reaches $2 million in unpaid security bills just as Mike Pence rallies with cops
When Trump realizes this is not North Korea and he can’t delay the election he drops out. You read it here first.
Herman Cain said Corona was a hoax and he went to a trump rally and didn’t wear a mask at alll ..... 3 weeks later he is dead 😬
Garbage like this is why Trump will be re-elected.
This is my Election Day countdown poster. Each day Trump drives a dump truck one step closer to the trash heap. I feel validated :)
You said no chinese products.         and still you cheer.
Well what do you think will happen when DEMS refuse to open their states? Don’t blame Trump. States that are open are doing great.
Trump did something nice for Putin against the best interests of American security? This is my shocked face.  😒
Epstein and his pimp pop up all over the place with Trump; remember, this is your guy, this is your hero. Surrounds himself with criminals and sketchy characters, runs for President, fools everyone... and you’re still buying his shit.
Donald Trump just needs to go.  Dude needs to obey some rules of the United States.  I know it is hard for him.  But you can't be there longer than 4 years my dude.
What kind of reasoning is this if trump postpone the November elections millions of Americans will descend on dc
If Trump wasn’t involved in any of this, why would he ever be seen with these horrific people? He just wished Ghisele “well”? Think he may be compensating much now?? You’re delusional.
No, Trump cannot delay the election.  Sheesh.
But Trump wants to cancel the election on 03 Nov
Secret service already has a plan to forcibly remove trump on January 21st 2021. Following the constitution he will be removed no matter what
Lol, Trump is a genius, he just doesn't lose!
Facts are facts, 1st time in history we had that long of steady economy growth without a recession. Its was many years long after the last GOP economy failure of Bush. Keep in mind trump exploited the deficit long before his damage from failure to take the virus serious.
This tweet is on par with "Trump is Thanos" in its utter lack of comprehension of pop culture (in this case, football.) Minnesota loved Herschel Walker? Hey Vikings fans, can I get a fact check?
There’s still time for Trump to drop out and avoid his ultimate fear in life of officially being labeled a loser in the annals of history.
Trump has finally done something no other president has ever done.  No one has seen numbers like this. The best ever.  I know this isn't totally his fault, but can't resist using his own type words back at him.
Or, Trump is pure evil, and you’re being fooled. The devil is tricky, if you are centered in the light, put some shades on, you’re sun blind.
The chilling thing about Seattle and Portland is not Pres Trump but the mayors &amp; governors who allow these protests to get out of hand. Seattle Mayor didn’t do a damn thing until they went for her home!  she still hasn’t said anything about the young black man killed by CHOP!
This will continue if Trump stays in position and uses stupid Pompeo, Navarro ...
I’ve seen several ways to countdown to Election Day. My choice is Trump driving the dump truck with McConnell, Limmer, and Gazelka closer and closer to the trash heap each day :) #BlueWave2020 #TakeOutTheTrash #MNDFL #DumpTrump2020
They aren’t voting Republican, they’re voting Trump. Pathetic
Cause there’s no proof?  Cause Donald Trump gave China the green light to open concentration camps? Cause it sure seems funny the trademarks his family gets from China? I gotta wonder how much more in the pocket can he be.   You also didn’t deny our president is a puppet.
Donald Trump is in the pocket of Russian interests. It’s why he’s too cowardly to release his tax returns, it’s why he is obsequious to Vladimir Putin. It’s why he publicly obstructed the investigation into his conduct. It’s why the good parts of the report are redacted.
Maybe you missed this, Barack Obama hasn’t been President for nearly 4 years, and after 12 hours of grilling, a level of investigation no one in the Trump administration has submitted to, House Republicans could not identify any wrong doing by Hillary Clinton.
Bad spelling by Trump. Maybe because he's illiterate.
As they have every right to. But, again, you have simply contrived this attitude that the states didn’t want the federal governments help, that there is some strategy, and that Donald Trump is anything more than an insult to our republican.
Many in Trump's cult have

You think trump pays his kids 170 million. That is senator money not west wing money
Troops being sent to Cleveland, Milwaukee &amp; Detroit.  Maybe I missed the news about those cities being ripped to shreds.  Trump will be inciting riots, not quashing them.  wtf can we do?
Did you say that in 2016? Are you sure he is losing? Many dems will secretly vote for trump when they are in the booth. They are afraid of burning, looting, assaulting and killing. Your side ignores it. You all blew it with your hatred.
As soon as trump is gone, he will become an even bigger security risk to the US, if that’s even possible. We need someone to keep an eye on him, unless the dept of corrections does the job.

Why did you wait until you are losing? More phony Trump beliefs
You'll get your place in the history books, Mr. Trump, but you'll be spinning in your grave. I like fixating on that.
Whoa another LOOK WHAT IM DOING ...yet you didn't for 3 and a half years....buying votes...Trump....lol...you're as predictable as you're needing to put on your rug
Sure there Trump Towers....they won't be hurt by low income housing being built because they already are low income housing ...so building more won't hurt their neighborhoods since they are already that
Why Trump never brings up the death and families that are affected EVERY DAY.....because he knows he's responsible.  Now he supports a doctor claiming Alien DNA and Celebrity Dream Impregnation, yeah he's living in Reality almost as much of a Republican voting just for a party
can’t stand strong women like Merkel. She dissed trump and he is pissed, plus his boss Putin told him to do that so he has to comply.
We've seen Quid Pro Joe in action in the Ukraine, how is Trump corrupt?
Trump Did Not Ask Putin About Russia's Bounties on U.S. Troops
No. I'll wait until there is a CDC, under someone other than Trump, approved vaccine. I wouldn't take anything from Putin, doesn't matter what it is.
Trump is Racist. Not even pretending he’s not at this point.
Can tRump be any more obvious? Should this discusting racist be elected for another 4 years, i am outta here!
Today I came to terms I’ll probably never see my dads side of the family ever again. They all racists and trump supporters. Wild as hell
Despicable Donald isn't even trying to disguise his racism anymore. This tweet should be heavily featured in  ads the rest of the campaign. This is low even for Trump.
You are an idiot. If given a fair shake at the bank for financing. There are plenty of brown people that that can easily afford nice homes. What they are paying today in rent many times exceeds mortgage costs. Trump &amp; his dad played the same BS with renting and were convicted
No shit! Wow is that federal or state cuz trump can pardon fed but not state right?
I don't think Neil needs worry about distracting Trump, all he does is tweet and I fully support Neil's comments on the few things Trump has focused on recently particularly the trampling of the First Amendment and his unwanted storm trooper incursions.
Biden has to do an outstanding job of fixing all that Trump broke because the mid terms are often hard on the new president's party, so the focus has to shift immediately for the DNC and all progressives after 1/21 to the 2022 elections. Great candidates, great policies.
And all Trump is tweeting about is how much money he is giving states he won in 2016. Not a peep about the real issues facing America caused by his utter incompetence and indifference.
I'm with them for now, but not with money, I don't want my money used against Democrats once Trump and his kind are excised from that party. I think the sorting will begin in 2022 when many more republican senators are running than Democrats. That's an important election too.
Not if your cause is to promote violence to justify sending in illegal unidentified "troops". Trump is really good at staging his narrative. It's all fascist showmanship.
Gullibility is not for me even if it comes from a pretty face. It’s akin to all the shit that Trump doles out on daily basis and then say one sane thing and US media go nuts with plaudits that he start looking presidential. Hamza is what he claim he is so I believe him - a bigot
I heard tRump also recommends multi purpose bleach: for  -inject it for covid -washing your privates upon waking to wash away demon semen
We're around, but American women want Beta males. Trump has the right idea.
Odd. How I'd characterize Barr's testimony yesterday. So much he was "unaware" of in a job he has to be aware of everything. Aware enough to fire prosecutors looking into Trump, interfere in cases, but not of real threats, like on  He lies.
OMG... Trump supposedly doesn't drink, but he always sounds drunk.
The fact that, after everything (corruption, convictions, impeachment, over 4 million covid cases, From Russia with Love, blatant nepotism, etc) Trump still has a chance speaks volumes for the both sides are equal narrative and right wing media.
"If I were to vote again for Donald Trump in 2020, it would be just as much a failure as an American, but also a failure as a human being.”

Fake account, just like tRump is fake pres.
Maybe that poll is an outlier, but in most other states that Morning Consult polled Trump was doing worse.  Biden up 7 in WI for example.
According to the latest Morning Consult poll, Biden is up 3 in MN. Would be wild (and on brand for 2020) if Trump won MN but lost the election.
We all are morally required to resist racism and hate anyone of his sheep driving around with the trump 2020 racism signs
Trump abruptly ends briefing after being pressed over retweeting misinformation - CNNPolitics. What a puss.
Dr. Stella Immanuel the celebrity dreaming impregnating Dr.  Trump "I'm a big fan of hydroxychloroquine, I thought she was impressive, but I know nothing about her." You thought she was impressive cause she agrees with you. Where's your medical credentials Trump?
Got her medical degree on Jupiter? Or from Trump university?
Trump said he didn't know anything about the Dr (Stella Immanuel) he just liked what she said about hydroxychloroquine. Exactly, makes him look right.  FDA, CDC, NIH, Unniv. of MN, all said it doesn't work, but he'd would Wrong.  EGO..let's believe the Witch Dr.
Trumps female doctor he believes and takes advice on about hydroxychloroquine has said  women can get pregnant by witches in their dreams by astral sex.  Dr. Stella Immanuel...she's a FRAUD.  Doesn't want to believe Dr. Fauci...because he contradicts Dr. Trump.
Trump is a puke
Funny how Repubs - You agree when Trump supported masks, followed him -weren't needed, followed - said they were followed - when not You're NOT a registered economy member, but are a registered Republican clearly it's party not dumb Trump. You're the dumb one

This man is arrogant and condescending! He is racists and corrupt as his boss/client trump! The Nazi mafia is running our country!  Barr clashes with Democrats over policing and Roger Stone sentencing
It is the former.  One of the few times tRump drew Barr's rancor (publicly stated that tRump was making his job as AG, impossible to do) was born out of a tRump tweet. Of course he reads tRump's tweets.
Does it actually surprise anyone that Trump's campaign is STILL playing fast and loose with campaign finance rules? This is his pattern, he did it in 2016, he's still at it. Going to be hard too spend that money from jail.
But he did tell ABC in an interview that trump's tweets make his job Impossible Which is it?
Yep its too bad the trump administration let in over 430K chinese + 40K Americans to fly into the USA Countless from and Europe unchecked About 1300 flights, many of which landed within NY The infections were imported to them and by large numbers. But yes, lets blame Gov Cuomo 🙄
No. Just no. Trump cancelled those programs, redirected the funds. Obviously they are not needed or he wouldn't have done so. No free pass on thwarting the will of Congress in previously passed appropriations. This bill is for COVID funding only.

One person who might actually dumber than tRump.
So, like, anyone 67 years and older gets a free pass on crimes?  Where the fu did this douche bag get his law license?  tRump has literally placed the dumbest people in his administration.  He should be dis"Barr"ed!
Right! Europe did NOT do what trump here has done They attacked the virus, hence the reason Americans are barred to travel to over 150 counties on this globe Other counties did what was needed to be done to minimize and stop/slow the infections Not here in the good ol USA
His most bird-brained tweet yet. What an achievement, like no one would believe, many people say. Trump wants to make comments he doesn't like illegal. This is NOT a communist country, Donnie. You are not a dictator, no matter how much you act like one.
31,000 plus cases in children under 18, with zero idea of what the long term effects of this virus might be on the very young. Still, Trump and his party are pushing to reopen schools and infect more children, teachers and their communities. Insanity.
I am happy with Waltz compared to many other governors. With that said. I think all of the governors and the Trump administration completely failed at protecting people living in long-term care or assisted living facilities; including our veterans.
Trump campaign e-mail: "Please contribute ANY AMOUNT by 11:59 PM TONIGHT... your gift will instantly be 500%-MATCHED."  Matched by whom?  Would love to see proof of this match. Well worth someone able to look into it.
I could but better not support Trump
Trump is destroying the relationship with China but their vaccines are going ahead with big progress, can we get their vaccine if theirs come out earlier?!
your a disgrace, you should'nt be trusted with children's safety.  Even suggesting children don't catch/transmit COVID is a flat out LIE.  Your not a doctor with the CDC...you aren't listening to Dr.s...unless Trump is now a Dr.  Your a shame to educational health
OMG, so a Trump supporter who knows Bible verses. Does the President?  Let me guess he's being taught one for a press conference today.    I suggest domething from Genesis and the Serpent.  He'll probably want to reference himself as great as GOD though since Lincolns  been used.
Remember yesterday when the Trump campaign said the President was going to change his tone and limit his tweeting in order to improve his poll numbers..?
LMAO....really....you have more strings than a quarter....and your cheaper.  Boy Trump must have given you something to overlook his flaws....so called Christian
No mystery. We are going off the petro dollar. Trump controls the FED and they can’t use futures (paper contracts) to hold it down anymore.

Trump's management team knows that everyone knows Trump is a racist. Faking giving respect to Congressman John Lewis wouldn't fool any potential voters, and would only serve to get people talking about how much of a racist he is.

Well, for me, I began to see it much more when President Obama was first inaugurated. I knew we were racist but what came from under the rocks then disgusted me. Trump has only made it worse by making it okay to be a complete ass in public all the time.

He was acquitted and I'll ask you, what has #HidinBiden accomplished in 45 years of spending my tax money? He won't be elected by being too frightened to debate Trump.
Me neither. Nikki Haley has been particularly obsequious in the last week or so, I can easily see Trump thinking he'll win back all the women by putting her on his losing ticket. The man's desperate, as he should be given just 32% approve of his performance.
This article is devastating. But truth sometimes hurts. Trump has done more harm to our international standing and relationships than anyone expected. That can be repaired, and will, but it may well, as the story points out, take more than two elections.
The next will be Navarro.  Pompeo wears a mask to sleep, so he will be the last one before Trump
Trump is a racist
He'll be too busy? Doing more of nothing? All the man does is tweet and get tested for the virus? There'll be no later in this season and he won't be around for any others. He couldn't get the ball to the plate anyway unless he rolled it like a putt.
Is Trump, Inc, solvent? Yes or No
I feel the same. I don't wish ill on anyone but I can't find it in me to have empathy for Trump. I just can't.
Not on ANY day. The man is a born liar, equal, almost to Trump himself. He's cooking the books and STILL his state is on fire.
You know, Trump keeps rolling the dice, I don't care how often he's tested, his arrogance is going to catch up to him one of these days. He's in a very high risk group too. When it does, I will send him thoughts. Dark thoughts.

They are panicking because Trump through the DOD secured the computer voting machines. Now they can’t rig those so have to find another way. It’s so easy to see the playbook. I think even CA could go RED once voter fraud is eliminated
Politifact is twisting itself into a pretzel. Last week, they said Trump kept his promise to protect SS because even tho he proposed cuts, Congress didn't make them. Now, he *kinda saved* the coal industry despite widespread bankruptcies, declining tonnage and fewer jobs.
If you vote your conscience, Trump may be voted out of office in 99 days and only president for another 177 days. But who’s counting...
Well, he "claims" he had no idea what Trump was up to and wouldn't have done it if he'd known. May be true. Trump's not really a sharing kind of guy. The chairman of the joint chiefs is not the person Trump would be concerned with anyway. The others, yes. Plus the Secret Service.

I agree. It has to hit “their people” hard, which means a rich and/or powerful ally of trump.
I'm convinced Trump supporters are like cornered animals now. They know they're in trouble, but they're going to fight to the death to not be wrong, and the only way for that to happen now is for him to be re-elected. They have nothing else.
Driving around rural areas lately has made one thing abundantly clear: This election is not over. No matter how badly Trump fucks up, people will vote for him.

Given, a divided government is better than trump having full control. Sure nothings getting passed but if he had a trifecta the situation in Minneapolis would have reflected the LA riots in regards to the federal response. Living 90 miles from there it would have gone badly

I'm starting to get a bit scared about the election again. Trump's recent big moves seem to suggest he's listening to his advisors for once, but I'm certain it is just a ruse until the election. Please let everyone see through it...
President Donald Trump will hold a news conference to deliver remarks and sign executive orders on lowering drug prices at 2 p.m. CDT Friday, July 24, at the White House.
A #MLB test from  that shows you can't separate politics from sport:
Oh come on man. Trump doesn’t come down to white castle and harass you at your job.
Thank you. Trump read that and agrees with the message. Doesn't have a clue what it means.
Your government, including your President, have disagreed with you. Even Trump himself has acknowledged that Russia attempted, and to a disputed degree, were successful in influencing the 2016 election.

AOC has to toughen up. In life, people don’t always treat you well. Who hasn’t been called names in their life? Doesn’t she call Trump names? This is not about all women and all men. This is between her and Yoho. FOR CHRIST’S SAKE, WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC!!.
Why couldnt trump take advice from lula instead of bolsonaro?
No. I dislike Trump very much.
Isn’t kneeling supposed to be about police brutality, not Trump? Do you want to confuse the message?
No.  Its cuz you are angry cuz trump is your president
Why you attacking me calling me names? Oh you must be the tolerant one. TRUMP 2020
When did the protests start?   What was Trump polling at then? What is he polling at now?   Anyone who argues that the protests are helping Trump needs to prove it. These aren’t brand new protests that started yesterday.
Millions? Feel free to share facts. Not made up stories... Why hasn’t the all powerful Trump brought charges? He said he’d lock up Hilary. He said he was law and order. How’s that working out?
15 when sandy hook happened  17 when ferguson happened  18 when baltimore happened  19 when donald trump was elected and Philando castille was killed 80 miles from where i live  Going up 90 miles to lake street less than 10 days after George floyd was killed to protest at 23
How about Trump? Bounties from Russia? 140,000+ dead from COVID-19, impeachment, cover-ups; I could go on but only have so many characters.

President Donald Trump will hold a news conference to discuss a strategy to reopen the nation's schools
Trump getting into local zoning and N/YIMBY arguments (something I did NOT see coming) is going to highlight the institutional racism of federal housing policy to a LOT more people than it’s going to convince to support him.
Your prods are besides my point. These are the guys that built the modern GOP that laid the ground for Trump. They want to make Bush and Reagan types the norm again, but their presidencies were built on the same racism, classism, and extraction that Trump merely exemplifies.
Landmark conservation bill passes House, headed to Trump to become law

These are Democrat run cities and states, they should be dealing with riots, also if you’re saying theses riots are only happening because Trump is president, then why were there plenty of riots while Obama was president?
I wonder if you could pass the cognitive test?  The one that starts, “what year is it? Who’s the president?”  Because you’re showing a video of 2020, and the president is Trump.   This is LITERALLY Trump’s America!

Opinion: Under President Trump, USDA hands families farm fresh food during pandemic
In 8 years Obama issued 276 Executive Orders. In 3 years Trump has issued 172.
Sounds like Trump is declaring war on our country! This must be stopped, come on Congress get on this! Enough is enough!
Who cares! I’m tired of trump getting free press and the press not holding his feet to the fire! The press tries at times, but he is using all of you like puppets! We know this is just a ploy for him to get more lies to his base and try to scare people with “alternative facts”
Can’t wait for Trump to turn our country into a police state controlled by the Feds!! Yeah, lets rock and roll.
There’s a commenter simultaneously mocking “the resistance” and also saying that tinpot dictators like Bolsonaro are more dangerous than Trump because we have democratic norms. The irony is lost on him.

It's not  like he ignored it for 3 months like Obama did I'm the oil spill in the Gulf Coast. When Trump declared the travel ban for China the Democrats called him racist and xenophobic. A few months later after the pandemic hit they say that he did not respond fast enough.
Trump shifts rhetoric as he urges mask-wearing, warns of worsening pandemicI agree, where I live I see nothing but trump flags, posters, decals, and signs. I think how ever they collect data they aren't collecting enough or are not sampling correctly.
Go Trump!
How many days can we go on being shocked, disgusted and horrified? Every day with Trump in it has been traumatizing. And every day, unbelievably, gets worse.
You need to poll more people than the Trump family.
They all lie with smug contempt. Everyone in the Trump Cult orbit curls their lip and lies in your face as if daring you to do something about it.
The site was down for awhile today, too, but this evening I spent the $14 (plus $2 to support organ donation) and ordered a new copy with my current address. Then I can go confirm voter registration and do my part to flip Trump the bird and Wisconsin to blue.
Dump trump
I am NOT despair trolling, the Federalist's #1 priority is stacking the courts. If they get a sense they can get one more seat before Trump is out, they will change their tune in a hurry.That's all. I just don't trust the Federalist Society. I will take any neg press for him tho.
Herman was shucky-duckied by a Trump Corona-rally is how I prefer to say it...
Prior to the Trump administration....
5. Herman Cain dies from Trump Corona-rally   6. Economy is in shambles  7. School year still f'ked  8. Obama still energizing, carried by FOX News  9.Ghislaine docs unsealing  10. Trump losing  What did I miss, now?
Donald Trump murdered Herman Caine. I don’t feel I’m being hyperbolic there.
Opinion | #Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That’s Unconstitutional. - ⁦
It IS officially the TRUMP-Virus, Herman got it at Trump's goddamn rally, let HIM take ownership over it... he has had PLENTY of time to contain it and implement testing and tracing, yet done NOTHING.
Barr's still gotta save his OWN ass!  He is now FULLY complicit. I don't think you will see him turning on Trump anytime soon unless it entails a cooperation agreement.
You just don't get it! This is 5-D chess, and Q will reveal all God's secrets very soon! Those who doubted Master King Trump will be cast into the lake of fire!
Herman Cain was diagnosed with Covid-19 not long after Trump’s Tulsa rally. Nobody denies that.  Ergo, there’s a significant chance he either caught it there, or WENT there already unknowingly infected, exposing others, all after repeatedly belittling the threat.  Neither is 👍🏻.
So Pence held a Cops for Trump coronavirus party on the day Herman Cain died of coronavirus he possibly caught at Trump’s Tulsa hatefest AND there were TWO traffic incidents involving the motorcade with officers injured in one of them?  Metaphor, omen or both?
Ivanka wanted to call the “First Ladies Office” the “First Families Office”.  Melanie refers to Ivanka as the “Princess”, and trump said; “I’m more sexually attracted to my daughter than I am to my wife”! What a wonderful family!
Trump told people not to wear masks at his Tulsa Rally. Herman Cain attended and didnt wear a mask. He has now sadly passed. Trump killed him.
Less than a year ago, the Never Trump movement had been left for dead. Now  and others toll Trump daily, and will probably throw the election to Biden. Not that Biden needed any help.
I think it’s presumed until President Trump decides to do some national contact tracing. He had symptoms within the normal time after attending this rally.   It’s also not good if he had it before Tulsa, as he would’ve then given it to tons of ppl cuz Trump.
Trump said he doesn't joke.
Jason, your endorsement race wasn’t a free and fair election. The MN GOP chair spoke at your announcement. That’s rigged. You couldn’t get the endorsement without cheating.   In 2018 you got crushed by Angie Craig. Minnesota voters are sick of you and Donald Trump. Please go away
Please tell me you're a Trump supporter.
Tell me you two are Trump supports.

And you can go to Target more often than 10 hours a year, and there are likely going to be more targets open in most cities than polling places if the primaries are anything to go by.  Tens of millions (about a quarter of the vote) use mail in ballots ever year, including Trump.

Trump’s crony is busy destroying the USPS as Republicans have tried to do for years. Betsy DeVos is busy destroying public education. It’s a goal she has shared with the Republican/Koch Brothers coalition for years.
Everytime he gets caught you say "he was just kidding", then Trump says "I never kid".
No need for SCOTUS to rule, and there is no basis for a challenge.   Pelosi becoming POTUS (in this scenario) also becomes Commander in Chief and head of the Executive Branch meaning the DoJ, FBI, US Marshals, and Secret Service. If they honor their oaths, Trump is gone.
WE will never forget that Trump caused this death.
This was my impression when the subject started coming up a couple years ago. There is a possibility or two beyond this scenario that could get us Trump again, but I don't forsee them happening.   Once again  comes through with the explanation we needed.
Doesn't matter what it means to them. In the situation  outlines, on 1/21/2021 Pelosi would become President (Acting?) and Commander in Chief.  I'm not naive about it, but I believe they will follow orders and honor their oaths better than Trump's lickspittles.
This is the key point and why it will not be effective, no tribal buy in: "It wasn't immediately clear how the task force offices will be staffed and the extent of the involvement of local tribal jurisdictions."
Gee, what happened today? Herman Caine died of COVID after attending Trump rally, GDP plunged by 32.9% (worst ever in 2nd quarter), and 154,000 dead from COVID and its rising. He needs the Portland distraction. #TrumpIsACompleteFailure

Please keep fighting for democracy!! I’m increasingly worried that Trump will refuse to leave if he loses. Regardless of party affiliation, this can’t be an option!
NO. Americans want you OUT so we can restore standing in world, begin to heal as a nation, and most importantly, FINALLY deal effectively with pandemic. Trump has brought this country to its knees in so many ways, on so many levels. Trump is a Russian asset. #NobodyLikesTrump

Tom Sega decided to cause an uproar and divide our community by giving a phony photo op to the Trump Administration. The very people who are doing everything they can to destroy wilderness and our global environment. Shame on him.
I doubt anyone is a zero. Rep. Ilhan Omar is really low at a 6.3. But she voted FOR the first coronavirus relief bill, like nearly everybody else did; it passed 363-40.  Also she and Trump both opposed a defense bill, certainly for different reasons.
Sending weapons to fight Russia's invasion of Afghanistan is not the same as sending out hits on American troops.  Trump says it is.
Oh, Trump is doing such a great job! NOT! He is a fascist and the "American experiment" is over if he is re-elected.
But we’re they all never Trumpers? Some actively supported him. They need to admit their complicity in the Trump presidency. Although I am grateful for them spending their bucks to take him down now.

Trump just grabs them by the pussy, so that’s different.
Anybody that would support Biden after all he has failed to do during his time in Washington has an intelligence problem. Where were all these great ideas that Biden has now when he was the VP? Sorry but you Trump haters are really brainwashed.

Well Becky, my friends in Texas who were all talking about a Corona virus "hoax" now all personally know someone who's lost a relative to it. That's hurting trump in Texas a lot, and it's not getting better.
Trump Princess helps slime and destroy the reputation of a 100 year old treasured business in Duluth. A Chilean billionaire gives her a house to live in. He needs a way for Antofagasta to destroy the Boundry Waters for a copper mine.
Texas. The trends put Texas into a 50/50 state by the election and every dollar Biden spends in Texas is $2 trump has to spend that he can't spend elsewhere. Right now trump is in full retreat and when the enemy is retreating, you don't dig in you attack.
When climate change destroys the whole damn ecosystem who is going to be buying your products then? The fascist Trump regime you support is doing all it can to make climate change worse. You have slimed the reputation of Duluth Pack and the City of Duluth.
I have loved Duluth Pack for years just like Tom Sega claims. But my long history of buying gifts there is ended. Sega chose to be a fascist collaborator with the Trump Administration. The same monsters who are doing all they can to destroy the environment for profit.
Tom Sega, hosting Ivanka Trump is absolutely a political statement and if you didn’t realize this well beforehand, you aren’t very bright politically. You’ve sacrificed the good will your business had for it, too.
Throw in golden shower and trump will be there.

Even Bernie is urging the nation to defeat Trump. Have you written off his advice?
Which is better than voting Trump, but doesn’t really answer the question, which as you’re aware: “Will you help defeat him?”  I get that the far left is discontent. But — and this applies to whomever — if you want a seat at the table, you need to help gain control of the table.
The RCP Average has Biden +9, even Rasmussen shows Biden +2, several polls show Biden leading most swing states and Trump vulnerable in unthinkable spots like Texas.  And I am being told (establishment) Democrats are the reason Trump will win re-election.
Remember all of the people that were offended when Duluth Pack made a conceal &amp; carry purse and boycotted their business? Same people that did that are the ones pissed off about Ivanka Trump.   But hey, they’re still operating just fine without them ☕️
Biden is appealing to anyone who will vote against Trump. Yes.  That does not equate to letting liberals drown. That meme is childish and not constructive.  Now answer MY question.

I remember early on your favorite person Nancy pelosi was promoting tourism to China town when Trump was trying to block flights from China coming here.
I voted for Reagan in 1984, my first ballot at age 18. I wouldn’t say he worked across the aisle and at 53 I wouldn’t even make the argument that he was particularly well-intentioned. But if Reagan Republicans are attracted to something about Biden over Trump, I’ll not complain.

Ivanka Trump visited Duluth Pack in Canal Park today alongside U.S. Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt and U.S. Representative Pete Stauber. They spoke to the press and then watched the CEO and owner of Duluth Pack sign Donald Trump’s Pledge to American Workers.
everyone is trying so hard to own trump in these replies...you will never make him feel shame, youre just wasting your energy
Today in Canal Park.
I never liked the dude for some reason and disliked him before tRump publicly. Something about him
I just saw a tik tok where a man explains why he hates Trump. It’s not because he is a racist, homophobic bigot. It’s because he made him feel hate towards people he loves... &amp; that hit me like a bullet. I’ve lost respect for so many people I love and that is truly heartbreaking.
Trump's imagination is that of a third grade child. I am surprised he hasn't suggested launching satellites with a giant rubber band (I don't think.)
Here’s a link to the story. Stay tuned for updates from  who caught Trump and Bernhardt at their second stop in Bloomington.

The main reason it is political is because it is an election year, Dems want to show Trump is stupid, Republicans blindly agree with Trump no matter what. If trump would have properly assessed and reacted right away, would be other way around. The 2 parties are nuts.
I was so glad to be at Politics and Prose day Obama family came to visit on Small Biz Saturday. And I greatly enjoyed screaming my fury at Ivanka Trump today! How humuliating for her, to have to enter through alley, and then try to avoid us by leaving by front entrance. Coward.

Also the arrogant byotch did not acknowledge the American workers outside of Duluth Pack. Ivanka Trump has no class. Everybody in the crowd was offended at her arrogance not even acknowledging Americans after her bullshit photo op.
Too bad you aren't showing the video of Ivanka Trump SCURRYING into the SUV parked in front of Duluth Pack with her entourage after this bullshit speech in Duluth, Minnesota. I am proud to say I gave her the middle finger.
Could someone in the media ask Ivanka Trump about her father being a predator, who's been accused by dozens of women and at least one child of rape?
Ivanka Trump wore power red suit to photo op in Duluth, at Duluth Pack. We greeted her w/ jeers and drumming, middle fingers. Ivanka now on her way to visit an org devoted to missing Indigeneous women/girls -- which offends me to no end, since Vanky's father is a predator.
Damn. All while the VA and Sec. Wilkie and Trump are hell bent on busting the VA union. Who have been advocating for PPE and safer working conditions since the start of the outbreak.
Lawn signs win elections people!!! I went down to Lake Superior the other day and I saw zero boats for Trump!! Not a single boat!!!
What a terrible call to host this photo op at your store. You’ve lost many costumers today, we will not forget that you stand on the side of greed. And yes, entertianing the Trump administration is political. Shame on you.
Melania Trump is like Marie Antoinette. Clueless -- until it will be too late.
Everything about this is suspicious..  What dirt does Trump/McConnell have on you senator?   Stay tuned folks...
And even if your worst fears about them are true, wouldn’t we rather have Trump, Fox and the Russians distracted by Project Lincoln than focused on attacking Joe Biden and the Democrats down-ticket?
The only corruption trump is you, and anything or anyone related to you or has a relationship with you.
They did the same thing with businesses that supported Trump when he came to town, and they’re all still operating 😂
The News Tribune, and probably other outlets, planned on asking Ivanka Trump about this during today's visit to Duluth Pack. But she left without taking questions.
I think it’s safe to assume the people that are boycotting Duluth Pack for having Ivanka Trump visit, don’t even shop there anyway.
We were stuck inside because of secret service but heard lots of protestors yelling when the front doors were opened for Ivanka Trump’s exit.  Overheard someone else in the store say: “That wasn’t very Minnesota nice, was it?”
They made a quality product, but if you support racists like the trump family you are racist, you are supporting the government kidnappings in Portland, you're supporting kids in cages at the border. I've endorsed them to friends and family in the past. Never again.
Trump also references the Great American Outdoors Act. Some locals have criticized Duluth Pack for hosting today’s visit given the Trump administration’s stance on mining in northeastern Minnesota.
Ivanka Trump said “this investment [in workers] is more important than ever” during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lauds  efforts to train their workers in a special craft.
WATCH LIVE: Ivanka Trump is in Duluth today to visit Duluth Pack for the signing of the pledge to America's workers--
New Jersey's governor had to sneak PPE in so FEMA didn't take their shipment.  Trump got states to compete for PPE then often took the winner's shipment. He probably sold it to other states.
Ivanka Trump and U.S. Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt just arrived at  Canal Park store, where the company is signing the president’s Pledge to American Workers, a commitment to worker education and training programs.
Ivanka Trump is in the building. Taking a tour of the  store.
This could get interesting. Water protectors and Black Lives Matter activists gathering now outside  to protest Ivanka Trump and DOI Secretary Bernhardt. All right outside our  office.
should reconsider doing business with  Hosting members of the trump admin does not show a commitment to the BWCA.
Let me guess, black roses? Melania Trump to Announce Plan to Revamp White House Rose Garden
There’s supposed to be a 60 day cap on temporary appointments but Trump has been notoriously flippant with these.
Think of how much vomit this baby can hold from everyone getting sick that you’re hosting Ivanka Trump. Really inspiring.
Since Trump never goes within six feet of an intelligence briefing, he’s probably still safe.
I’m afraid of catching the Trump Cult Virus by reading about these Looney-Tunes conspiracies. How else do people start believing that everything false is true?
Oh geez, Ivanka Trump to visit Duluth MN today, at Duluth Pack.  Not excited. In fact im disgusted that, that person will in the state period.
There was some speculation that medical records were being shared via the Michigan Spectrum Health Server. Not sure that makes sense to me. Michigan was one of his swing states. I will have to dig for threads.
Tim Murtaugh: Joe Biden a ‘Trojan Horse Candidate‘ for the Extreme Left  via
How can you support the BWCA and host members of the trump administration? Honest question.
So very disappointed. You have alienated 70% of your base. The other 30% are the people that buy your purses. I bet  is going to love hearing that you are having a Trump in your business and signing their agreement. Taking business elsewhere.
I asked my (trump-supporting) dad the same question today, mentioning trump's recent response of "We'll have to see."  Dad shoots back the interview question was clearly just to "gotcha" trump...?!?...and went on to say that he *has* to honor the results.  Yeah.Sure.Righto.😱
Trump uses mail in voting.
Many more were deleted. 'Rubbed me the wrong way' and 'knew something was off' based on that video? No mention of Trump otherwise, but this innocent video demanded they investigate the OP? Shove your virtue signalling.

Trump 2020
This is so Trump 2020
Biden doesnt have to acknowledge Trumps/Foxs "dares"...  He just needs to keep watching Trump talk! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
You’re right there my friend. Democrats have much to atone for also. But Trump? Can you imagine what Carlin would have said about him? OMG.
Maybe there is a Trumper who can recover from the Trump Virus. Mnuchin, Devos, Barr, Pence, Trump and all hs winged monkeys— they don’t give a damn about you. They don’t give a damn about the ones you love.
Thank you!  We all appreciate your hard work so much!  Trump MUST win for our country to remain as it is.
It is so beautiful there!  If trump wins I’m going to seriously try to immigrate to Canada.  Already in northern Minnesota, so it wouldn’t be too much of a shock to the system...
Every single one of these people would absolutely despise Trump and see him for the conman that he is.
i hate donald trump
is gaining lots of new customers if Twitter, Facebook, and Nextdoor sites are any indication. Ivanka Trump’s visit to Duluth tomorrow is a lesson on the consequences of business owners on the wrong side of history.
Ivanka has no qualifications to do anything. She's just the Trump Princess, with no function beyond photo op propaganda. Seems like an incredibly tone deaf move to associate your brand with her.
I don't like Stauber, and I admit I'm surprised that Duluth Pack backs a guy who is all in on polluting the BWCA with sulfide mining, but he's our congressman. But at this historical moment, to give a photo op to the Trump admin itself? Really?Too bad you don't care this much about Trump allowing Russia to put bounties on US troops.  You're a disgrace.
Wow, an absolute must read.  #ObamaWasBetterAtEverything   I Hope This Is Not Another Lie About the Republican Party
It felt as if Trump wasn't engaged in combating the virus from the start because early hot spots were in Democratic parts of the country.  To read in black and white that that's *exactly* how the White House treated its countrymen is beyond comprehension. Vote Blue Nov 3. 🌊
Trump signed the bills.
Trump.  Will never sabotage UPS or The post office. Both are unionized. That's a battle that Trump will definitely lose. Trump.  Is all talk! ROME IS BURNING!!
Trump.  Doesn't give a damn about the elderly, sick or anyone, not even Herman Cain. Trump.  Only cares about his image. There's no telling how many people have died attending Trump rallies! ROME IS BURNING!!
Trump better hope he doesn't win. If the democrats takeover the house and senate. He'll definitely be thrown out of office and prosecuted for crimes beyond his wildest dreams! Resign Trump before it's too late! ROME IS BURNING!!
Honestly pathetic with the way your party is trying to muddy the waters with baseless lies about voter fraud. You all know Trump is going to get embarrassed and have to have your excuses ready.
Con Man and the republican party. Trump.  Hates America! Our voting system isn't good enough for this elitist asshole! He's trying to destroy the one thing that make America a democracy and that's voting! Putin is his master!
This Trump 101, the media will try to corner every republican to defend his statement, and they will spend that air time trashing mail in voting.
Herman Cain.  Dead bc the Trump administration.  Irresponsibility to protect him from covid19! 155tho Americans dead bc of Trump Irresponsibility to protect them! Trump must testify and be held accountable!
Trump.  Is conning the American people with his voter fraud escape. The president of the United States is a fraud! He is extremely unfit to be president! He continually misleading the American people. He need to be brought up on charges now!
And we disagree because as much as we peacefully disagree, I will never be able to get you to admit to a fact because of your dislike of Obama and u won’t condemn Trump because of your support for him. My full point
It just really gets to me that if Obama or someone like that says something along these lines, it’s considered a blatant lie but if Trump says something like this he’s either baiting us or he doesn’t mean it. There’s always always a defense for him to say whatever he wants to
The same people screaming that a  Trump rally murdered Hermain Cain, would’ve been dead silent if he’d been peacefully protesting for weeks with thousands of others 💀
Per Thomas Friedman's article in the NY Times a few days ago, any possible debate should be contingent on the release of Trump's tax returns...
I constantly defend the media, but there need to be tough questions surrounding the corrupt and complicit Trump Admin
Listen all you math geniuses: Biden = Pro Democracy                Trump = Tyranny                                  In which America do you want live?
We need to replace these Republican Senators.  Without their complicity Trump would not have been able to pull off many of his stunts. A Biden victory will not bring about the change we need (immigration reform, justice reform, etc.) if McConnell is still Senate Leader.  🌊
Regis Left $20 Million to Trump Campaign:
Now you got Trump.  Republicans made the way for Trump, to takeover your party . Complaining about a great president. Get the republican party a monster president! Good luck praising that maniac . Trump!
Imagine going through an earthquake and then someone being like “no! Its a hoax! Dont hide under the table, run outside! Theyre trying to control us!” Thats how all the trump supporters sound.
What's The con now Don! You're trying to suppress the vote with walk in voting and mail in voting? Trump want to have it both ways. American people voting rights are in jeopardy in the hands of Trump. Like everything else! GOLF ANYONE!!
Garrett, you persisted in making Sen Tillis take a public stance on the Trump comments about delaying elections. Often Republicans want to hide behind, “The statement speaks for itself” or more cowardly “l haven’t read the comments.” Thank you for a job well done.
Trump is playing you, America. He knows his outrageous election comment will command the conversation when we should all be talking about the GDP taking a NOSEDIVE by 33%!!! Stop falling for his misdirection tactics! #USGDP
It will be a great embarrassment to the United States if Trump is re-elected!
Donald Trump got Herman Cain killed. Pass it on.
Why are you changing the subject we are discussing and doing “whataboutism”. The fact is, he was high risk, and, at the time, Trump was anti masks. Herman Cain would probably be alive today had he wore a mask.
I'm sorry for his family-They don't deserve this. BUT Cain attended Trump's stupid ass rally in Tulsa last month and was diagnosed with it a week later. I don't feel bad for people who associate themselves with others who claim it isn't a real problem, further spreading the virus
Imagine being a black multimillionaire who doesn’t need anything from Trump yet gives his life to attend a rally for that racist.
Donald Trump's Tulsa rally just literally killed Herman Cain.
Imagine being a black multimillionaire who doesn’t need anything from Trump yet gives his life to attend a rally for that racist.

Absolutely not; Trump has lead us into this unsafe environment and needs to live with the consequences.
It begins. BBC News - Donald Trump suggests delay to 2020 US presidential election
There it is. Trump calling for the election to be delayed. I'm surprised it took him this long.
Please stop President Trump, be a leader that we need.  Jesus loves you❣️
Ok America.  How many more people have to die, before Trump supporters realize that Trump is unfit to be president? ROME IS BURNING!!
There are people who so dislike liberals that they'll vote for any crazy fool (or any crazy cause) if it upsets us.  They just like to drive us nuts even if it's to their own detriment.  The more we dislike Trump, the more his followers are delighted by the effect he has on us.

Martial law in Portland, why? Who are these people Trump has hired to put the citizens of Portland under seize? Is Trump making a power grab to stop democratic cities from voting?  Portland need to figure it out what! Before Trump destroy their city.
This dude Trump. Is a JOKE! He doesn't give a shit about making American lives less stressful during these tough times. 155tho people will soon lose their lives, . Instead of meeting with hospital administrators,  Trump is meeting with oil CEOS. Selfish loser!
My god, where’s your outrage over Trump not addressing soldier bounties with Putin?
I honestly think we're legit looking at a situation where Trump wins narrowly but the GOP gets das boot from both chambers of Congress.  Biden and the DNC keep doing themselves no favors in a race where they literally just have to not be crooked/say dumb things but keep doin it.
America.The whole Trump presidency is bullshit! The country is becoming bullshit, bc of Trump! There's a deadly virus that killing us and all his fans can say, Trump 2020. They're so full of shit too! The whole country is in a depression and it's getting weaker not better!

Ya, cuz just by naming something “anti” but then doing the thing you say you’re against is still somehow...anti.   If trump named an organization anti-lawandorder but then went on to push laws and military order, he’d still be anti law and order right?  Makes total sense
Trump does nothing about it, because he doesn't want to offend his base.
100% spot on! The self-interest comparison is striking. Although, I think Trump has a LOT more self-dealing going on.
Gotta admit--Trump &amp; Company are masters at disinformation and deception. White supremacist incites riots, but #BLM gets blamed.
Antifa.  Isn't a terriost organization.. It's all a conspiracy to undermine peaceful protest. Barr and the Trump organization need to find the real group that committing these crimes and bring them to justice! ROME IS BURNING!!

Ask yourself why those that oppose Trump feel the need to cause destruction? The left is just a bunch of children throwing a hissy fit because they know they are going to lose again.
It is hilarious that Trump's $250 (potentially $500!) stake is scrutinized but the FDA fast tracking a $3000 drug while pumping the brakes on a $11 drug when both had positive and negative studies just flies under the radar.

Portland police and politicians. Are letting Trump get away with hurting and terrorizing the good people of Portland.  While the police and detectives should be investigating who the real agitators are. Trump.  Is using Antifa as cover, to use force against peaceful protesters!
Trump's thugs pelted this journalist with pepper balls which cracked the plastic in his gas mask and resulted in lacerations to his eye.  If this happened in another country, we'd be calling for sanctions against the regime in power.
Both presidential and senate races in AZ are quite close.  So easy for Trump/McSally to distort what is happening in the streets.  Hope Biden and Mark Kelly have a good message to turn AZ blue in November.

Plus, the timing was so obvious. Trump is predictable in a lot of ways - his egotistical lies being the main one.
Trump has refused to pay many cities that he has visited for the police protection the Secret Service asked them to provide.  Some of these visits were during the 2016 campaign; others during his tenure as POTUS.  The local taxpayers have been left picking up the tab.

Trump. Is the most protested American president in modern history! There's no way he can win re-election.

Listen to Ron.  A third-party vote is a vote for Trump.  If you feel strongly about a third-party issues (e.g., environment), or if you just aren't *enthusiastic* about the main candidates, spend the other days of the year promoting those causes.  On Election Day, vote Blue!

It wouldn't cost Trump an extra cent to listen to the scientists and experts.  But he won't do that.

Rice is qualified to be VP and to be Pres. After Trump+Pompeo, someone with foreign policy expertise will be crucial to re-build ties with our allies. That said, I don't know if she's the strongest campaigner for Joe, a key role for running mate. Lots of other roles for her, tho.
There's some fox new host that are a part of Trump secret police force in Portland.  Fox News.  Is fake news Trump.  Conspiracy is becoming an American reality!
Yes!  Issues are very important to the younger voters this time.  Even if they're 17 today, as long as they'll be 18+ by election day, they can register now.  They have a chance to oust Trump the very first time they vote!  Ask them to join Team Blue. 🌊😷

Trump.  Need to cancel his presidency immediately, since he want to belong in the culture club! Cancel Moscow Mitch McConnell too.

Trump. Another crime of the century. Is your lowlife administration. Are responsible for the most devastating plague to ever hit the shores of America.  150tho Americans and counting are dead! The Trump administration ignorance, will have a big price to pay in November!
Trump.  The political crime of the century.  Is when you and your federal lowlife soldiers gas women and children of Portland, Oregon. The Trump administration.

Um...more Americans have died under Trump on our soil then any point since the civil war. The riots and anger and protests are under Trump's america.   So Pence can GFHS.
Trying to buy more time  ? Are you scared #Trump ? Are you afraid  is gonna mop the floor with you on #Election2020 ? Sounds like someone is a wittle scared.
When did W become awesome?  That was beautiful. You may not love him, but contrast that with a President Trump who is routinely excluded from mourning leaders of any stripe.
All the more reason to not attend a rally? And to wear a mask? And to stay away fro Trump? Pendejo.
is a RACIST. 3/3
Pres. Trump has all his little puppets trained!
“Trump will do anything to get re-elected” is a kinder way of saying “Trump will do anything to avoid going to prison”  Once again, well done, Don! Thank you for all you’re doing.

I watched the Ingraham Angle on faux news tonight. She said drumpf is leading in most of the polls on important issues. She also said that when people are asked their opinions of trump they're afraid to say they support Trump. This is why he's behind. Pure bull crap

Yeah, failing upwards doesn’t obey logic or reason. Americans are born hedonists, and Trump and the Conservative echo chamber is an all-you-can-eat bullshit buffet. We’re great, everything we do is right, no shame, no self-awareness, just consumption beautiful consumption!
Please enlighten Meghan to the fact that the conservatives she once knew, are no more! Trump's senators, administration, and many state governors are in his pocket. They follow a Blind leader!
So Dershowitz is an actual child rapist and the Qanon fuckwits think Trump is trying to take down "child sex traffickers." I wonder how many of them will take down the real criminals in their savior's orbit.

I agree with you brother, on most issues.  And I was elated when Trump was elected.  But Jim Jordan tells us how evil Google is when he accepts campaign money from them?  And seriously.  Do you really expect Barr to do anything of real significance.  I don't.  And I'm not alone.
So everybody go on vacation in November and vote by Absentee instead.  Trump would then blame that and claim fraud...guy does everything to bail him and his friends out just not the American people

Right - I guess we're never going to escape that sort of reasoning. People can make any sort of argument and "support" it, and they can always find offense in another person.   But for those who seek truth and wisdom, we'll see a huge difference between Obama and Trump.
This is funny, and Stephen Root is great, but it mostly shows how stupid  is. Trumpers will never "wake up." They were never asleep. They voted #Trump for the #racism, the #WhiteSupremacy, and the Christian Terrorism. That's who they are.
It's a shame President Trump hasn't offered any leadership on this issue.

It’s because she is far left and has shown that she despises pragmatism and moderation in politics. I would say a good percentage of her most passionate supporters view someone like Amy Klobuchar and Joe Biden is worse than Donald Trump.

I think Trump worshippers need to get educated on COVID-19. If you were, Cain would still be alive.
You sure don't seem to mind  #Russian election interference. Seems Trump's on the phone with the  every other day.  What DO they have to talk about?  #PutinsPuppet
No, I don’t, because I was distracted by Trump wanting to delay the election.
TRUMP: I heard your attempt to create a bogus conspiracy around voter-mail in ballots. I will lay my life on the line to vote in-person &amp; drive you out. Also, planning that U, the GOP, FoxNews, &amp; boogaloo goons won’t accept results.
Trump again makes himself bigger than the law by threatening to delay the election...which he doesn't have the power to do.  But when you pardon your criminal friends it's understandable why he thinks he can
That’s unfortunate. I believe Atone is the right person at the right time. I view Rep. Omar as the left-wing version of Donald Trump.

So according to the constitution, if we don't have an election Nancy Pelosi becomes president on January 20?   Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That’s Unconstitutional.
Donald Trump has refusing to take any leadership. He won't give federal funding, he won't give guidance or guidelines, he won't do his job. The states are not equipped to handle a public health crisis like this, and Trump has doomed our education system.
We didn’t call the other countries shithole countries We didn’t want that raggedy ass fence We didn’t even want trump’s stupid ass. I’m not about to let the rest of the world disrespect and shit on me or feel less than because of this fucked up goberment.
You are correct that Trump and co. didn’t collude with Russia. Collusion means working together. Trump and co. knew Russian was interfering and did nothing to stop them but technically they didn’t work with them so it wasn’t collusion.
Do tell us what Trump said of Lewis's passing...
I wouldn't call the sheep around my house necessarily criminal unhinged Demoncrats "My words" but I can't say they are tolerant either. My dogs are excellent herders. No joke To answer your q I have only had to replace 1 Trump sign not bad. I bought 3. We'll see if I need more.

DON'T STOP AT POMPEO. HELL RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU CAN'T STAND trump? THE WHOLE trump ADMINISTRATION? , THE WHOLE GOP? THE DIRECTION THIS GREAT COUNTRY OF OURS IS  UNFORTUNATELY HEADING?
This is how liberals are defending their insane indifference to Trump’s authoritarianism today.  Right-wingers drawing a mine has to be more contemptible than those hanging on.  Nothing else works epistemologically.
Sure. Let's see what 4 more years of Trump looks like. Can't wait to see the country burn down honestly.
you very clearly don’t know what you are talking about. You are a puppet of Trump. You are so delusional I can’t believe it!👎🏻
Trump tries to con at every corner &amp; fucks it up a lot. As he tries to lay groundwork for a fraudulent election just wait until he has his minions cast bogus votes for Biden &amp; either they get caught in the process or forget to challenge those votes making the landslide larger.
Do you know what Steven Calabresi is a fascist too, he has supported Trump all along, too late to do the right thing now. ALL Republicans are tied to the mast and the rats will go down with the ship.  🐀 🚢 🌊

And he caught his death at a Trump rally. Wear a mask.
That’s not saying Trump has not used his pardon power for cronies, and also for others who were serving long sentences for lesser crimes. Y’all never talk about that. And I hate defending the man, but one-sided bias without acknowledging counter facts. Confirmation bias sucks.

Trump has done plenty to black Americans
"Until recently, I had taken as political hyperbole the Democrats' assertion that President Trump is a fascist. But this latest tweet is fascistic and is itself grounds for the president's immediate impeachment."
Let’s wait until Herman Cain’s funeral where Trump goes off in all kinds of crazy tangents. Oh wait. That’s silly. He won’t be speaking.
LOL, they can’t review “messaging strategy” because they can’t have a strategy at all, Trump is an impulsive man-child who can’t control himself, much less act according to a strategy. 🤣
meanwhile,,, in an effort to ‘stay informed’ I spend an hour every evening reading the same 2 articles called “What Trump said about masks today” and “Everyone wishes Facebook was gone”   going to be reconsidering some things

And Herman Cain signed a document saying “it’s okay for Donald Trump to transmit a deadly virus to me.” Don’t tell me this GOP isn’t a fucking cult.
lmao. I suppose you also support Trump, considering your right wing conspiracy theory rant. Ghislaine and Trump have hung out countless time, and he wishes her well. 👍
You don’t even have the option. Your tweet makes it sound like you could cancel the whole election and crown Trump king if you wanted to. But you can’t so don’t even talk about it—you created Trump, everything he says as does is your fault
No!  And an equally resolute No! to the vote-by-mail frauds who aren't satisfied with the staggering fraud in anonymous no-ID polling  you know, because dead dem voters can't show ID at polls in the United States of America (cheating, patronizing, dirty fraud dems)  Trump 2020

Trump is the only fraud and we’ll stop that on 11/3/2020 with an EPIC LANDSLIDE victory for Joe Biden!
Trump is sarcastic just like everyone else, look up hydroxychloroquine. It saves covid patients. Why can’t patients have the option to use it.
There is no damaging information and whatever they think they have is crumbs compared to Trump and the Republican party’s actions!  Joe Biden will be our next President and there’s nothing traitor Trump can do about that!
Trump is 100% aware of that but thanks for telling us what we already know. Democrats like to tell us they're gonna do all kids of crazy shit they will never do to get a reaction or votes. Guess what, he's playing your own game and whooping that ass!
Would you consider the Civil War unrest? How about WW2? We had elections during both of those. Would you like another civil war? That’s what would happen if trump tried this.
The ONLY reason It would be a battle is because the current president is a criminal and knows fully well the crimes and collusion that will come to light.  This has not happened before. This concern has not happened before.  It is only with Trump because he is fully corrupt.
You’re not pro-life. Not if you support Donald Trump. Nor are you a Christian. You’re a fake. Swirling in a swamp of hypocrisy.

I’ve grown bored of your bullshit now, though, so be sure to be appropriately shocked once all the corruption behind Trump is uncovered after he loses the election
Why are you talking about Trump’s election delay tweet instead of today’s disastrous GDP report? BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS.
He's a Trump toadie. Be very aware of him.
Trump's endorsement record is hilarious, tho.

Opinion: Trump's election tweet shows a frightened narcissist afraid of losing
"In Trump's economy we don't adapt, we sacrifice ourselves needlessly to someone who doesn't give a living shit about us."
There's no precedent in modern politics for the sort of election delay President Donald Trump suggesting in a series of tweets. Here's a closer look at the key questions.
I’d say, “How did you get Trump to come to John Lewis’s funeral?”
At least you know the shit show is over and aren’t even to try bullshiting for Trump.
Somewhere warm. You were invited to an orgy of all the presidents. They were all there. Washington. Lincoln. Obama and Trump.
Any election in which Trump loses will be viewed as crooked.
Donald Trump is saying that the first election under his watch will be “inaccurate and fraudulent.” He is also setting up the United State Postal Service to achieve the frauds if he does not win.
By that logic a vote not for trump is a vote for Biden.
#RealPresidentObama just makes them understand how truly awful Trump is.
Wait - are you saying that AG Barr doesn't know the Constitution enough to answer a **BASIC** question about if Impeached US Pres  can delay election date?  fuck him, fuck Trump &amp; fuck this

Trumps got it covered. Thats the best argument for Trump's wall I've heard yet! Good job!
"That said, the former Trump adviser heard an administration official had contacted an outside attorney to see whether Trump could halt the U.S. Postal Service from sending out mail-in ballots, citing attempted fraud or foreign interference."
I've been following you for a while, Rondell, and I just want to say: You're one of the people I'll certainly be listening to after all this Trump nightmare is over. You're talking about issues that go far deeper than Trump, and aren't predictable based on party. (John 3:8)
Im voting for Trump. Haaaahaaa
Well US intel briefed Trump on the bounties TWICE, even our allies were briefed, the frigging TALIBAN admitted it FCOL! They found the cashboxes in the field - that’s how this started! Also Trump’s lackey joint chiefs never denied it, only that they needed more “data.” #TRE45ON
Donald Trump has never known love.  Pass it on.
The problem with the strategy if the Trump 2020 candidate sucks.
Ok, the job situation was great, everyone had 2 or 3 jobs a piece, because they like to pay rent and eat at the same time.  Slave labor.  Trump promised the slaves good jobs.  I remember, coal and manufacturing, tech, China was going to suffer!  Good paying jobs, that was a lie.
Trump’s Twitter page is now a parody account.
Bottom line is this....if mail in voting is allowed Biden wins. If not, Trump wins. Wake up call to the 249 elected Republicans
Who needs Trump's voter suppression when democrats are doing plenty of it on their own by declaring the election to be rigged by Trump! Get your ballot early. Follow the instructions. Vote right away.

If you are a Trumpet you think all mail in voting is fraud except for Trump &amp; Kayleigh; if you are a rational person who can think independently &amp; objectively you realize there is probably a certain amount of fraudulent voting in both forms but not enough to decide an election.
That would be fantastic. If Trump screwed up the results and Nancy took over it would be the best justice.
Garry loves to keep bringing up "bleach" because it's the only battle he can win here, but apparently he finds this satisfactory.   The whole world heard it, we know what Trump said.
I didn’t realize Trump was in Minnesota 🤷🏼‍♂️
seems like this got very little attention so far today. maybe trump knew it was coming and floated out the impeachable tweet about delaying the election to divert attention.  i feel like every media outlet needs 50% more reporters.
Reading this makes me wonder if perhaps THIS is part of what Trump is trying to distract from today. Of course, there are so many things to choose from...
The first chapter of my book "MAGA Seduction: Resisting Trumpism and the Debasement of the Christian Conscience" is built around Trump's reading of that poem.   First chapter is online here:
Who ever thought Trump, the business genius, could evaporate trillions? Well, he started his career by burning Fred Trumps $400Mil. Then Trump took a huge leap, the likes of which no one had ever seen and burned up billions of Wall St money and now...POOF GOES THE TREASURY.
I was of the opinion that Trump was a worse person, but W’s actions had more actual real world negative consequences. Then 2020 happened. I now rank a Trump as 2nd worst president of all time.
Serious question for members of the GOP: who among you is hoping Trump will deliver your eulogy?
I think he knows. He is one of the people behind  which is a group of anti Trump Republicans.
If you claim you’ve been waiting four years to get rid of Donald Trump, you can fill out your absentee ballot and mail it back the day you get it.
What is your true opinion of President Trump's mention/suggestion of delaying election?
Even the  political leaders know:  #Trump's claims about the election being unsafe are LIES We had an election during a Civil War, so today is not a problem If you postpone the election, this country will explode.
The unwillingness of Trump to take accountability doesn’t surprise me, although I admit I yearn for a national leader that does.  But while I saw race &amp; income, age &amp; health status as targets, the reckless abandonment of essential workers appalls &amp; shocks me. 30/
The Trump Depression
Trump abandoned command &amp; climbed off the boat with the iceberg ahead. Governors with states in trouble reluctantly dealt with reality. And racism underlies our response at every turn. 26/
I wasn’t the only one.  saw what was happening in nursing homes too. And we talked about it here. 11/
In April before there was much data I worried about the impact on vulnerable communities &amp; that Trump was picking the economy over the health of marginalized communities.  I am sad to feel right. And it’s actually worse than I thought it would be.10/
It will be the last time I make the mistake thinking Trump might care enough about people dying to take any responsibility.  The stock market &amp; his polls dictate his interest level. 8/
If he’s re-elected, the vaccine will carry the Trump brand and be every bit as excellent as Trump wine, Trump steaks, and Trump University.

Evict Trump has been in my mind since November 8, 2016.
Here’s the breaking news for all those Trump loyalists: just for the sake of argument regardless of a delayed election or not, Trumps term ends on 1/20/21. Period. If for some bizarre reason Nov results are in doubt, Speaker of the House becomes POTUS.
$70M will 'disappear' enroute to  and   friends; $50 will disappear due to no oversight; $120M will never reach the victims...because it funded Trump's #racist wall;  $28M to services and benefits for  because, no one knows why...
And trump was going to give everyone jobs, jobs, jobs!  What kind of job was he thinking about?
It felt as if Trump wasn't engaged in combating the virus from the start because early hot spots were in Democratic parts of the country.  To read in black and white that that's *exactly* how the White House treated its countrymen is beyond comprehension. Vote Blue Nov 3. 🌊
No. That would be in correct. If that were the case Donald Trump would remain president. Come on man.

Immune systems didn’t exist before Donald Trump. Obama and Joe Biden  and the rest of the Deep State hid the discovery of immune systems, which humans had lived without for 5,400 years, since Adam, Eve and dinosaurs walked the Flat Earth.
When an issue like this pops up I reflect on all the conversations I had with friends from the West Coast a couple months ago. I kept telling them if Bernie is the candidate Trump will win Minnesota and Wisconsin. They universally acted like I was nuts. This vote isn’t surprising
Lindsey Graham is a tool, Trump's tool.

Well, okay, but as soon as you tweet something worrisome, I'm going to.... give you a pass.  The second time? Pass.  I'm just gonna give you a pass as many times have Republicans have given them to Trump.  But I'm not too worried you'll need them.
They should be able to sue Trump for his incompetence.

Dear future president. I am surprised at the large number of fellow Venezuelans supporting Trump, mainly in Florida. A declaration denouncing Maduro's dictatorship would be very helpful gaining the Hispanic vote in FL. Your presidency will bring democracy back to Vzla.
This last night so Trump &amp; GOP can recycle their 1968 "Law and Order" campaign
it's so weird what sets these psychos off. this is a guy that would love to personally waterboard the undocumented kids in cages on the border but Trump diarrheaing something out of his mouth right when he wakes up is the end

All this talk about Trump not leaving office...I don’t know. Feels like he would need to roll a natural 20, and then everybody else in the party would need to roll a critical failure for this to work out like he sees it.
If he wins, I off Twitter. The only reason I'm here is that Trump is here.
God Bless. You have no idea, since I discovered what Killary is &amp; did in Haiti &amp; other my heart burns for truth and justice. These rotten people. Thank GOD Trump won 2016. Best night of my life. And I had no idea what lie ahead that night. Spygate...Coup de tat..etc..FINALLY, now
Why don’t you find something that proves it’s not true mr troll, something from a reputable source not called #FauxNews or #Breitbarf🤮...even Trump’s own Joint Chiefs didn’t rule it out before Congress - they said they needed more data 😆. I watched that live, w/my own eyes bub.
He's gotten his money's worth of judges, and Trump is sinking like a  rock, so it's time to throw the useful idiot away.
Free from wearing a simple mask at a rally during a pandemic? Herman Cain died from following Trump's lead in ignoring the science. He did not die free, he died in vain.
5. Trump hates the USPS because it is loved by the country and has extremely strong unions.

I actually don’t mind Donald Trump my tweeds I just think he is divisive as all get out and doesn’t have a lot of wisdom
Trump avoided a national strategy for a state led strategy to own the libs.

You can blame Donald Trump and the Iranian military/U.S. military for that, it's not Riots fault.
It’s coming from Trump, so... certain lie.
Trump signed the bills.
Just remember the only reason we’re in the present situation is because Trump and Senate Republicans do not care whether any of us live or die.  Many factors came together to create this moment, but none of them would exist if not for this fact.
And here’s another one. Way down at the bottom.
Letter from Portland: Mom Is Pissed at Trump’s Secret Police  via
Trump wants to delay an election he pretty much knows he’s gonna lose because the Covid hoax of March is raging too much for Americans to safely vote ... but it’s perfectly fine to send my kids back into a Petri dish of disease in their school because that’s where they should be.
Lol, And I should believe some internet troll and Donald frigging Trump? No thanks I’ll take my chances with propublica npr and the free press.
The Federalist society just called for Trump's impeachment..🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

Trump cant close the P.O. but he can close mail centers, eliminate overtime being it A crawl &amp; thus keeping the mail from getting through, he'll stop at nothing to win
Trump is about to steal the election and destroy the US Postal Service.... this is your best tweet?
Well US intel briefed Trump on the bounties TWICE, even our allies were briefed, the frigging TALIBAN admitted it FCOL! They found the cashboxes in the field - that’s how this started! Also Trump’s lackey joint chiefs never denied it, only that they needed more “data.” #TRE45ON
Herman Cain should not have  attended the high risk rally in Tulsa period.  Very sad he lost his life over tRump’s recklessness  I heard he was in the hospital a couple weeks afterwards  I’m sure he regretted his decision  Sending 🙏 to the Cain Family
Donald Trump hasn’t had a hard day in his life. He has always had money and a supporting cast. Why would people not see that? I think trumpers do see something in him that they can relate to. The fearlessness, the ability to do what one wants. They like freedom and guns.
"I take no responsibility at all." #Trump  Trumpers are fine with that, because Trump is white, and they all voted for the #racism  #NobodyLikesMe
This is how Trump feels about his puppets.
This might be a controversial take but I think that a lot of trumper are smarter or have more wisdom than Donald Trump who they believe in. Think about that for a second.
I don't want to jinx us, but my hope is that #Trump loses on #Election2020, and after that, he basically ghosts America, just stops even pretending to do work, like a bratty teenager, all huffy that people didn't vote for him, he just stops talking to all of us.
You know it is bad when Trump makes Bush look like a genius.

This is a great argument against Trump’s nonsense.
ugh, the Biden team’s strategy of just staying on the sidelines and letting Trump destroy his own chances at re-election is almost certainly gonna work
A Trump supporter talking about politicians "not handling criticism"
This: polling is garbage but we’ll be inundated with it for the coming months. Notice how infrequently the enthusiasm gap is highlighted when they come out to support the narrative that Trump has already lost. And yes, you’ve seen this movie.
Trump: “Now all I need to do is find a few tall buildings with windows that open...”
When the President stepped in and told them to change their recommendations.  They used to be a trusted organization, but we can no longer trust what they say, as they've been turned into a political arm of Trump.
Dear Donald trump the world is under economic collapse the truth set the free and have it come upon our county for we are at warfare with the federation and its time to stop and have piece before its to late the world economic forum is the place of true news.

Too bad Steven will still probably vote for Trump in November. I don’t want to hear anything from him until he says #DumpTrump2020 and #Biden2020
I don't think you can clone A human as disgusting as Donald Trump.  The service reported a $4.5 billion loss for the quarter ending in March, before the full effects of the shutdown sank in
But if Putin hands him the election in the midst of all states using mail-in voting, and Trump wins, then it’s not rigged?
Trump knows he going to jail as soon as he loses in November and is no longer a setting President. But look since the postal service is slowing down why don't you just pardon yourself and sign it and mail it to your self. It should arrive after you lose🤣😂
We argue against false manipulations of the facts. Trump has failed miserably. This and many other things are attempts by him to save face. NO! He has to take the responsibility for his action and inactions.
If Trump had been pro-mask all along, his "friend" Herman Cain might still be alive. #CNN
No, it's exactly what it was—and if you want to insist that Trump merely "exposed" that nefarious side, you've already assumed that's the case.
YEAH, ITS ABOUT TIME THE DAMN PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR trump IN 2016 START SEEING REALITY AND WHAT A F#CKED UP JOB trump HAS DONE IN THE PAST 3 1/2 YRS.

Honestly pathetic with the way your party is trying to muddy the waters with baseless lies about voter fraud. You all know Trump is going to get embarrassed and have to have your excuses ready.
Brutal but fair.  #COVID19 #Trump
haaaaaa YES! And i've never wanted to be a minion :D
Random reminder: Minnesota allows early in-person voting. I'm not sure how it will work in COVID times, but in 2018 I was able to vote at city hall weeks before Election Day. If you're concerned Trump might fuck with the USPS to prevent mail-in ballots, it's worth a thought.
Throw in the rest of the corrupt Trump clan, including Jared and Yep.

Did you think Obama had too much power? Or any other President or just Trump?
Listening to Mr. Trump speak after today's memorial speeches by former Presidents Clinton, Bush, and Obama is actually depressing. It just makes me lose hope.
Because that mean admitting that the virus is not a hoax and refusing to wear a mask increases the chance that you catch it. Trump cult can’t possibly do that
Just wait.  September.
I've been saying that for over four years now. In 2016, the Trump campaign even met with Jesse's campaign manager et al to gain insight and advice.
Profile checks out, instantly see retweets of Trump and a dude saying Covid was engineered. Get some education past your 1980's high school degree, I beg of you.
How I feel after seeing the Trump presser.
I didn't screen cap but the Q's were CD5, likely vote screen, Trump 1-10, Biden 1-10, who you voted for in 2016, demo questions. No messaging.
But still claimed Biden’s claim that Trump would seek to delay the election was “without evidence.” So, at the time Biden made the prediction, he was wrong because it hadn’t happened yet?
Do you beat off to Trump's tweets?
Shorty ask me if I support trump.................... huh?
Trump pulling the “holding the elections will be too dangerous” card was far too predictable. We are witnessing a dictatorship.
The Commentary magazine take on Trump’s delay talk.  The Federalist society founder’s take on Trump’s delay talk.  The MSNBC take on Trump’s delay talk.  The Democratic elite’s take on Trump’s delay talk.  🤷🏻‍♂️
Do you beat off to Trump's tweets?
Its anazing biden willbe able to avoid debates with likely any consequenses. I dont know trump can win agaisnt somebody who will never ever be vetted or exposed.
I don't think Trump realizes the sky is blue and his days in office are numbered.
Donald Trump directly is responsible for the murder of Herman Cain pass it on
Why is  allowing Trump to spread misinformation about voting?
The same and often worse. He has polled like this for a year even when his approval was 51%. Not sure he lost any real support eith covid. It comes down the the like 10% undecideds as always. If they think a radical senile 78 year old is the future not much trump can do.
I got it. Trump is warning everyone that this “mail in” election is dangerous. Imagine if you will the winner on Election Day is over turned by late mail in ballots. It would be instant civil war. No elected officials would be safe. A nightmare!
I just heard this.. tRump wants to delay elections, But if he does speaker Pelosi becomes president on Jan 1 b/c  tRumps term ends on dec 31!!!! That's why the GOP vehemently oppose any postponement of the elections.
Co-founder of Federalist Society is calling for Trump’s impeachment!   For fascism!  Things are getting worse for Trump by the minute.

It was Obama who said Trump should stop complaining and get more votes. Election is not rigged.  Trump won the election, and of course, it was the crazy liberals complaining that Trump got more votes!  DNC rigged primary, Obama used Fed agencies to target conservatives. Rigged?
Trump genuinely doesn't care if people die, period, regardless of their political affiliation.

I see "he" and "lying" in the same sentence and assume you're talking about Trump. Is it this story? It's gotta upset him.
Your party's position - and silence - on Covid has been loud and clear since Trump first ignored repeated warnings from our experts, called it a hoax, failed to put together a strategy, repeatedly shifted the blame, and now whines that no one likes him. What are we missing here?
For a businessman, Trump is a pretty bad doctor...and pharmacist...and businessman.
• Since there is no legal way for Trump to unilaterally delay election, red states are simply counted as having 0 votes • Biden therefore wins by the largest landslide in US election history because no red states' votes were counted • Republicans dig their own graves I guess
Best case scenario that won't happen but would make me lol:  • Trump announces that he is delaying election • Blue states continue with election anyway as prescribed by federal law • Blue states overwhelmingly vote Biden • Red states follow Trump's orders and delay election
In 2016, the GOP saw this and still accepted Donald Trump as its leader. The fact that he is now mentally unraveling in the face of a crisis should not have been a shock to anyone. This is why the GOP, as an institution, no longer deserves support or power.
So, should Biden step on all this great news for Trump with VP pick tomorrow? Or let America stew in Trumps failures over the weekend and reveal it on Monday?
Was trump up or close?

Nice try - cutting out the headline which clearly Trump Virus deaths if NO CONTROL MEASURES were taken.  Doing better than nothing is about the only compliment that can be given to this failure of a President. It must suck to have to lie in order to say something good about Trump
I'll believe the GOP has found a red line they refuse to cross for Trump when a Republican Congressman introduces articles of impeachment in the House &amp; #MoscowMitch's Senate votes to remove him. Until then, their words are just wind, &amp; they own everything Trump says &amp; does.
STOP REPUBLICANS 'TRUMP' FROM BLOCKING THE VOTE! ALL REPUBLICANS ARE BOUND AND COMMITTED TO INSTITUTIONAL RACISM ...!
Perhaps that's because the entire conservative establishment has abandoned any pretense of having principles, and has just cravenly surrendered to Trump.  I'm just spitballing here.
Imagine the various documentaries years from now detailing the HORRORS that headlined the Trump Administration.....
Trump and his followers should come out in full force and vote on November 4th.

I have to vent.  Trump is giving a COVID briefing, expecting to hear about the plan going forward. Nothing!  He is attacking China again for the virus and talking about what a great job he’s done. How does this help?

Funny, I heard it was COVID-19 that he got at trump’s Tulsa superspreader
(2) with emoluments he has gone about using the office to try to enrich himself and adult kids since he was sworn in.
Trump knows he’s dead so he’s gonna beat on this “mail fraud” conspiracy to feed his ego an excuse for losing by an historic amount. Or, this could be his pretense for a coup.
At work, co-worker had a Trump speech playing at lunch. No one ever does that. Passive-aggressive to say the least. So I put on Mama Weer All Crazee Now by #Slade on over it. Not loud enough for anyone else, just to drown out President Dementia Test. Tanx for saving the day guys.

A Washington Post editorial comes within inches of calling Trump a "fascist", using "fascist" and "fascism" ten times in a single piece.  They're catching on.
It seems like all of Trump's "jokes" begin with the premise that he is above the law
trump is doing his deflection bullshit again.  "Defer the election!"  He's attacking voting rights, which, IMO, is a swipe at John Lewis.  And as always, he wants the news/talk to be about him.
Stringing together two related, coherent thoughts is really asking a lot of Donald Trump.
I wouldn't loan trump a nickel I didn't intend on losing. Give it to charity,
Trump is an actual moron... he doesn't understand absentee ballots ARE "vote by mail". You sign the ballot-put it in the envelope-drop in the mailbox. I repeat: Absentee ballot voting IS vote by mail. #TrumpIsAMoron

I can do this all day... Your Mom's and my Dad's Democratic party is dead. They have no platform except trump is bad and are doing damage to our countryvanf it's people for power...
His own ignorance was at fault too. He didn't have to listen to Trump. He could've worn a mask. He could've decided not to attend the rally. Actions have consequences.
I thought if the president did it, nothing was against the law. Wasn't that the whole defense strategy during Trump's impeachment?
Now Trump is saying "they're sending out hundreds of millions of mail-in ballots."
Wait!  They went home?  How is Donnie going to be able to sign the health care bill he promised would happen in two weeks?  I'm crushed that Trump lied to us.  Shocked.  I'm so shocked.

Trump sounds like he’s speaking with predictive text
No, he passed away from the Trump virus, which he caught at Trump's ego-fest. Even more than the other 150,000 deaths, this one is  Donald Trump's fault. Health officials warned that it was unsafe to hold that rally but Don needed to have idiots tell him he's great - so he did.
Steven Calabresi, co-founder of the Federalist Society which fed Trump a bunch of super-right-wing "judges", is now calling for Trump's removal, because he claims he did nazi this coming.
Evidently he contracted it at a Trump rally where few if any people were wearing masks, a rally that was wildly irresponsible to hold.
It has been long scrubbed online.  has a you tube. He made a video a month or so ago on John Trump &amp; Tesla. In that video he goes into Stephen Fauci, shows the old articles. He went to library looked up old school way. Real articles. Not too much out there even so.
Wonder if Trump campaign still has Cain's legal waiver from the super-spreader event.
Herman Cain passed away because he went to a Trump Rally in Tulsa and was a dope that didn’t want to wear a mask. Don’t be a dope, wear a mask. #DonaldTrumpKilledHermanCain

“Herman who? I met him once, twice maybe??? I barely knew him. He was a a big Trump guy. They say he came to my rally in Tulsa??? What rally? I didn’t have a rally. Nobody will let me rally because of the China virus hoax. Did you know I shut down our border with China?”
Donald Trump is painfully embarrassing to watch...
None.  I have researched our options as well as Europes options. Even the European countries are upset because Trump's actions threaten their security. Clearly they are fearful. If they panic so much over this amount, I believe we should exploit that fear for our gain.
Herman Cain Symbol of shame Died for Trump rather than in Jesus's name...  Sorry if some might find this offensive, but Mr. Cain wasn't a difference maker for others the way John Lewis was. And for those Trumpians who had hateful and ugly things to say about John Lewis, GFY
“It’s highly infectious” - Trump. So wear a damn mask!
Also, point to me where Trump made a "threat". He made a comment based on recent reports indicating how easy it would be to commit voter fraud with mail-in ballots or the number which would be lost.
The same people screaming that a  Trump rally murdered Hermain Cain, would’ve been dead silent if he’d been peacefully protesting for weeks with thousands of others 💀
It’s a shame you’re too damn blind and you can’t connect Trump to this. He don’t give a rats ass about anyone but himself. And I pray for Herman’s loved ones as they grieve
Was trump &amp; gop traitors attached to the rocket by chance?
Minnesota elections official calls Trump's threat to move election day 'dangerous', but 'empty'
Yes me too. You know it never use to me this way. They had debates, commercials and then you voted and it was over.  Now it is constant hate coming from both sides. Dems don't care about violence as along as it makes Trump look bad and then there is Trump and his character flaws.
You’re telling me Donald Trump and Joe Biden are the best we got to represent our country? Someone say sike right now
No. He didn't deserve to die gasping for air in an induced coma, but neither did any of the other nearly 150,000 Americans.  But only a tiny handful of Cult45 went on Fox Propaganda Network &amp; spouted to  millions of partisan morons the Trump-approved anti-science bullshit. T&amp;P

Trump didn't fail whatsoever. What did you want him to do, declare martial law, quarantine the entire country, and give everyone $100,000 stimulus check? And fueling racism? Are you insane? Do you not listen to mainstream media calling damn near everyone but black people racist?
Kind of like how he needed Congress to approve funds to build the wall? Trump does not believe in the Constitution or the independence of states or anything that limits his absolute power.
As long as they continue to a point conservative federal judges and the possibility remains of flipping two more seats on the Supreme Court to the conservative side  There is literally no bottom conservatives have with Trump
Feeling energized by a speech?  I was energized the moment I saw that Trump had won the election  Watching democracy get flushed down the toilet is motivation for me I don't need any speeches
I don't believe there is any value is watching Trump live on TV. His whole schtick is to com the viewer. Watching commentators pro and cons THEN viewing the footage gives me more insight.
Things Trump is trying to distract from: John Lewis' memorial service, Herman Cain's death (caused by the Tulsa rally), a 33% drop in the GDP, and the Trump campaign laundering millions. Still very terrifying that he wants to at least pretend he is willing to destroy democracy.
It doesn’t look like Clark is a Trump supporter

100% on target 🎯  Trump would play her like a fiddle

Don’t get too excited, not a single conservative educated on the Constitution thought for a second POTUS could or even would try to do it. Classic Trump tweeting b4 consulting. Prof. Calabresi isn’t voting for your socialist agenda either.
We have to stand up and make Donald Trump a one term president when voting starts give rides to people to go vote. Lets get rid of want to be dictator Trump.
As a member of Congress she's coming from a place of very high privilege knowing that even another four more years of Trump will only give her more 30-second sound bites to raise money off of to help solidify her career
I think some of the argument is they can be identified through other things. Much like we figured out Individual 1 was Trump, since the doc described that secret person as the one who won the 2016 presidency.
Like Trump’s 2016 Oval Office bid 🙄, you guys should be self funding
Wow. The hysteria is turning us into worse people than we were before tRump. If people want to risk their health or that of their families, that’s their business. Stay six feet away and be glad you’re not that dumb. #CalmDown #FFS
The world is saying wear a mask and that Trump is a fucking lunatic. That sum it up enough for you?
I’m not ruling that out - not at all - but we don’t know that with certainty. Trump is a narcissist. Narcissists have very fragile egos. They need to be constantly admired and ingratiated. That’s why he surrounds himself with scummy ‘yes-men’ who always tell him how great he is.
It really is remarkable how juxtaposing any human being with Trump elevates that person to god like status.
Trump is a full time mad man💯💯 You can never win it Never!!!!!!!😡😡😡😡😡😡
Of course it was a distraction and you fools in the media will run around chasing every place Trump throws the laser pointer  Why aren't you asking him what the hell about the bounties on American soldiers?

Know this: Trump, Barr and McConnell will do anything to win. Anything. Even when the election results are irrefutable, they will challenge them.   We will ultimately win but November will be uglier than anything we’ve seen these past 4 nightmarish years.   We must be ready.
Notice he only banned Chinese from entering, not sick Americans who were in China.  The virus does not know nationality. All Trump did was keep Chinese out, not the virus.  That’s xenophobia, NOT protection.  Then he had NO plan to stop community transmission.  Nice try.
What Trump is doing online today by suggesting 1) pushing back Election Day and 2) disparaging mail-in voting during the middle of a health crisis which has killed 150K+ Americans is a sign that he’s losing badly and probably won’t accept the results of the election, regardless.
If Trump loses, there won't be any rebuilding for a LONG time. Democrats are Communists. It'll be the last election where votes are actually counted. Notice how China doesn't hold elections? One party rule ad infinitum. The party picks it's leaders; like DNC will pick for Biden.
He was apparently fine with everything Trump did from grabbing women by the pussy, a disaster pandemic response, throwing kids in cages  who cares about this guy says he's not going to sway one Trump voter  Don't give him any oxygen
I hope Trump proposes the 999 plan in honor of Herman Caine.
"Trump is simply TOO STUPID to be President."
ya know what else is good to do? check your privilege. i can't believe actually said voting for biden is the same as voting for trump.  what the hell are you smoking?
BOTH THE TRUMP BOYS ARE MURDERS!! NOW THEY'RE KILLING ANIMALS THAT ARE GOING EXTINCT!! PIGS!! 🐷🐷💩💩
Did you not say MONTHS AGO....testing needs to be done anyone who wants it can get it, it will be easy and accessible.  THEN WHY DO YOU GET TESTED EVERY DAY with SAME DAY RESULTS and we wait 14 days or more?  You said you'd have a plan. YET you've NEVER disclosed one. TRUMP=LIAR
President  brought up the idea of postponing the general election in November. Does he have the power to do that?
Damn right. Reawgan was Trump 1.0, the historical whitewashing of his genocidal, racist, elitist legacy is sickening. Reagan was a goddamn monster.
If Biden wins the election can we also impeach Trump and evict him in November?
Trump is IN office and we DO have Mobs and he is so concerned about the vote that he will not stand up for Justice for America. Disgusting!!!
I am always and forever glad that I don't have kids, but never so much as during Donald Trump's catastrophic COVID-19 failures.
I wish you people would spend even 10% of the energy you use to get worked up about Trump on critically reviewing Walz. I’d take 5%.
Trump is IN office and we DO have Mobs and he is so concerned about the vote that he will not stand up for Justice for America. Disgusting!!!
Pompeo is afraid of Trump. Coward.

Oh, the Trumpsters just like to give credit to Trump for everything good, but pretend he has nothing to do with anything bad. They live in a dream world.
And when evangelicals surrounded Trump as being their leader God is unleashed a plague up on this world and the United States in particular is bearing a full-on hurricane level shitstorm from it
I agree with that. Trump will try to create chaos. Fortunately, there are some very smart Democrats who will stand in the way, and will be calming voices. It's hard to game it out now, but the important thing is that we must vote in overwhelming numbers.
I believe Trump died months ago. What we see is a barely functioning animatronic simulation. Explains the listing, the strange gait, the incoherence.
Many political scientists &amp; pundits trying to assure us that Trump can’t postpone the election, but the real story here is that he thinks he can &amp; wants to do it. That’s plenty significant in &amp; of itself. #WeWillVote
The statement was clearly grounded in a reading of Trump's character.
How much of a kickback is Trump getting?
I like our governor, but I agree with you on Traitor Trump. I can't stand him either.
I’m sure tRump is working furiously to get him released
Man, it only took most of the days tweets for you to get to this.  Bet Trump didn't even write it.
Any Democratic elected official; ANY DEMOCRAT...A N Y would be light years better than trump...a democrat on the city council of a town of 1000 people in rural Ohio would be better than trump.
Lol Trump always torpedoing his own administration.
Everyone looks absolutely miserable. Just like the whole USA having Trump as POTUS. Vote him out!
Trump is John Doe 1. #TrumpJohnDoe1
I don't think Trump killed him. I meant what I said. If I was in my 70's and knowingly risked infection, I think a Trump rally would be a great way to go!
He drank the Trump Kool-Aid and died. Should be a lesson for all of you.
I own mine. I say all the time I was Never Biden since the Thomas hearings. Even after all that, Biden is still better than Bernie or Trump.
But what if local and state officials decide they agree with Trump?
6+9+7 -5 (trump kids) is 17. Q is the 17th letter. Puzzle solved.
If there's one thing I learned during the Republican defense during Trump's impeachment hearings, it's that nothing the president does is illegal, so your entire list is moot.
Occasionally I remember that I was banned from the UMD fans Facebook group for objecting to the idea of the men's hockey team visiting the White House. I fucking love being right.  Also I was called "as bad as Trump" by a former friend during that time period.
Few people seem to appreciate that ballot counting is typically carried out county by county, state by state.  Think there are any county officials -- in Florida, say -- that will follow Trump's orders? There's not much you can do about it, either.
He ran in 2012, not 2016. And he died of COVID-19 which was from Trump’s vanity rally. Seems worth noting.
Trump came to MN and delayed the printing and release of Gov Ventura’s “Big Plan”. They were the big media story that day.
Is it easy going through this new life of yours without having to use your brain? It is apparent Trump tells you how to act and what to say.

Our old buddy Herman Cain succumbed to COVID-19 after attending the Trump rally in Tulsa that was a “Super Spreader” event. Norm would have played that tape we heard so often of Herman saying, “Blame yourself”.
The John Malkovich character and the Space force leader is Steve Carrell. Hahaha Trump made this one funny.

If Trump told the brutal truth about COVID your mentor might still be alive. The president killed your friend.
Trump unmasked
No i guess just basing it vs last election was all where trump was mostly up in rasmussen.  Its not important i just thought it was the most reliable poll of the big names
We need to replace these Republican Senators.  Without their complicity Trump would not have been able to pull off many of his stunts. A Biden victory will not bring about the change we need (immigration reform, justice reform, etc.) if McConnell is still Senate Leader.  🌊
And in the mean time, we need to vote by mail, before Trump can mess with it...
If Obama was the counterpart to Trump's racism like liberals claim, I'm eager to see how liberals reconcile that with Obama droning the shit out of brown kids in the Middle East and East/North Africa. Imperialism wasn't somehow better under Obama. #ObamaWasBetterAtEverything

Do you hear all those military people speaking out against Trump's call to delay the election? No? Huh.  Maybe it's time to stop supporting our troops.

My friend, pray for Trump. He's the least Christlike among us.
He went to a trump rally with no mask. He is an educated person. We did not fail him. We are failing as a country many... But he made his choices.
Trump is a lot of things. And clever isn't one of them..
and Cain lied about it.. "The media worked very hard to scare people out of attending the Trump campaign rally last Saturday night in Tulsa." "Yes, there were some empty seats in the nosebleed sections, but 16,000 people in the COVID-19 era is pretty impressive" -Herman Cain
Rest-assured. With Trump it's a certainty there won't be.
If u really believed anything like this why would u wait 4 months to implement this law?  Why don’t u stick to what you know which is declining help from trump then asking him for money to help rebuild the city u let burn down
No you know you will lose BIGLY and that is why you are trying to change the date.  And once you lose, you will be a pariah throughout the world, jeered and hated and unwelcome everywhere decent people go. Trump will be the name of shame in history books.
He was a serial-lying buffoon "The media worked very hard to scare people out of attending the Trump campaign rally last Saturday night in Tulsa." "Yes, there were some empty seats in the nosebleed sections, but 16,000 people in the COVID-19 era is pretty impressive" -Herman Cain

It was Trump doing what he always does  He shines a laser pointer and all of the fools in the media runs to cover it while not asking him the question, what about the f****** bounties on the heads of American troops
TECHNICALLY BECAUSE OF HIS GROSS INEPT INCOMPETENT MISHANDLING OF THE COVID19 CRISIS trump IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL 150000+ DEATHS
LDF Responds to President Trump’s Suggestion to Delay the 2020 Election -
Asked about President Trump’s suggestion that the November election be delayed, Walz says that’s “distracting us from what’s on Minnesotans’ minds” like reopening schools and growing the economy.
What The Trump medical administration did was politics to get leadership seats without the medical degrees and experience in the practice. The CDC had several different labs in the US. And strongly worked with WHO, and Trump removed WHO and has no idea what labs were CDC labs.

How about if the media starts focusing on bounties that are put on the heads of American troops rather than following Trump down every rabbit hole that he digs for them  Y'all let Trump play you like a fiddle and then whine because you're not taking seriously
Trump is going to attempt to turn the US military on the people, to claim that any dislo8to him is treason and that he has the right to occupy our cities and towns.  He is not above this.
The voters, the voters will stop him  But the media is going to have to get over their obsession with following Trump down every rabbit hole that he digs for them  Stay frosty and focused on the issues that truly will determine Trump's electoral future
That and his jealousy of the attention a dead man is getting! Trump wil never receive the respect and admiration John Lewis has earned and received and it eats at him!
Correct me if I’m wrong, but if somehow Trump succeeds at postponing the election, he has to leave office Jan 20th regardless &amp; Pelosi becomes POTUS, right? Like, if we still do the constitution and whatnot...of course if he postponed the election, the constitution is gone...
Let’s talk about this instead of Trump’s fantasy of delaying the election
Was it Trump's butthole?
For what? He hasn't broken any laws unlike Biden who did exactly what Trump was falsely accused of in the impeachment hoax.
Trump and the Republican Party have had more than 6 months now to get their s*** together so our schools can reopen properly and with adequate personal protection  Y'all have not taken this seriously and now expect everyone else to fall on swords to try to save you
Sounds like exactly what Trump did with Covid 🤔
I literally cannot imagine. What kind of self loathing makes you support Trump?
SHIT, ALL Y'ALL GONNA GET IS A "trump" after "trump" FROM  THAT WHY I BLOCKED IT.  WOULD NEVER ANSWER THE QUESTION I ASKED , EITHER IGNORING IT OR TALK ABOUT SOMETHING TOTALLY IRRELEVANT TO THE QUESTION I ASKED.
I propose we postpone the election until Trump's popularity numbers start moving in the positive direction, then he could be president forever.
That isnt a morale crusher.  I get far more worried seeing trump down 6 and 7 points is polls he is usually very close in. All i read about is everyone switching to trump yet the gap once again seems to be going the other way . Just baffling to me biden could be up in legit poll
Trump should have added "I'm reclaiming my time".😂
And at this point, Trump is trying to rig the election again, so the more of his voters drop from COVID, the better for our country. Terrible thing to think, sure, but true.
If new Trump postmaster is allowed to proceed with cuts, he's doing so SOLELY to help Trump win.  Sen Manchin (D-WV) noted the coronavirus relief package passed in March sought to avoid cuts like this, but USPS had not touched that funding.  #Corruption

I am certainly far less optimistic today then i was a week ago. The IBD poll is usually good for trump and he is losing ground and down in rasmussen approval again. Seems like he has hit a wall or ceiling. Starting to wonder if the covid headwinds are just to.much to overcome?
IF IT DOESN'T HAVE PICTURES TO HELP HIM UNDERSTAND, trump WON'T ATTEMPT TO READ SHIT TOO MUCH EFFORT.. HE IS THE LAZIEST GD MFin POOR EXCUSE FOR A HUMAN BEING I HAVE EVER SEEN. ANYTHING NEEDING ANY KIND OF A EFFORT trump PASSES TO  SOMEONE ELSE TO DO.

An authoritarian. Trump thinks it’s perfectly safe for kids to go to school and for us to have normal economic activity, but far too dangerous right now to have a democracy. See how this works everyone.
Yes it is a diversion Trump throws all this s*** against the wall as diversions and liberals pick it up and run with It freaking about the latest thing  Liberals need to remain focused on what will actually hurt Trump and none of this s*** will
We need some good news. Even normal trump friendly polls have not looked good thia week. Im getting worried
OK Gov Stitt, ALSO diagnosed with COVID. He sat in the same row as Herman Cain did at Trump rally in Tulsa.  If it's all just coincidental -- and if it's true that masks don't help -- it's odd there sure seems to be a whole lot of anti-mask Republicans being diagnosed with COVID.
U Forgot  Melania Nudes Trump Golden Shower Trump and Stormy Daniels And Trump Stealing From Children Charity
Exactly, but the problem is... this is their actual stance, and the Trumpers out there will support it, because they voted #Trump for the #racism.
Im not so sure anymore. Even trump friendly polls dont look that great now. Down 6 in ras. Down 7 in ibs. Down 7 in harris. Those were  always good polls for him. Kind of starting to expect a loss now but hope i am wrong.
Congress &amp; Trump admin need to pass immediate relief &amp; assistance to mitigate the economic impact of #COVID19. Expanded unemployment benefits have run out &amp; businesses don't have access to support &amp; funds they need to operate.
Come on Lindsey, America knows that Trump will take you out golfing in 2 weeks, show you those blackmail photos again and the following Monday you’ll be backing dear leader on the idea of election postponement! #LindseyGraham #GOPComplicitTraitors
I think the trump campaign has done a terrible job and im losing hope this week. Biden has skated for months and has not been vetted. No rallies at all. No real message. Covid has been a dream for biden and trump is letting them control the narrative . Time is ticking away fast
Getting rid of Trump and Pompeo?
Where in the Constitution does it say the President needs to follow the law? That sounds like a Trump tweet.
I feel horrible for the Cain family. And despite Trump's (staff) tweets, can anyone credibly say that Donald cared if Herman lived or died?  Nothing in Trump's past suggests that he does. I agree that we shouldn't stoop to T's inhumanity towards others, tho.
Psych ward? Free thinker? Hahahaha NOPE! What's crazier than believing every lie you are told by a NARCASSISSTIC SOCIOPATHIC conman who doesn't care about anyone but HIMSELF? It's like watching stupid sheep being led to SLAUGHTER or watching Darwinism in action! Now THAT'S crazy!
Anyway, I'm sorry Trump's inaction ruined your food eating.
Seeing Obama speak at John Lewis’ funeral on the day Trump is trying to cancel the election reminded me that the before times were so much better, and now I’m literally out of hope and want to cry all the time.
You keep saying these things, and they all relate to Trump. But you don't say "Trump." It's really weird.
I fervently wish Wilford Brimley would, by God, "get things done" as the Postmaster General...and scare the Bejesus out of the current Trump toady/lackey/shill..
She's yet another victim to "If you can't beat em, join em."  The Republicans no longer hold any moral or constitutional high ground so long as they continue to align with Trump.
The Great Trump Collapse will be known forever as the beginning of the end of America. Maybe it can evolve into something better someday, but for now America is just a cash printing press for billionaire kleptocrats.

No, Donald Trump knows the Democratics will lie and cheat to steal the election.There are already countless examples of your party suppressing the truth so Trump doesn't get credit. Your party has proven they'll let Americans die to hide the truth. We haven't forgotten Benghzai.
If you're a republican concerned about the damage trump has done to your party, if you're an independent or simply a person who loves your country more than your party, this should give you pause before you vote for trump.  #Florida #Texas #Georgia #Ohio

I’d say delay on the basis that I want to be more sure the outcome isn’t manipulated because I think Trump will win again

Yes but Trump refused for a long time. And it's not nearly in the numbers Germany has taken in, which has been reported in the millions. I'm not saying these countries shouldn't step up their military spending too. They should. But after the way Trump has treated his allies..
That number for Biden and Peters would  VERY good if it pans out like that in #MI02.  In 2016 went fot Trump by 17.5.  If Biden and Peters are within 2 points there...

Don’t think anyone wanted Trump at the funeral.
For all of the    Trump pinned his tweet that suggests he is going to "move the election", Pompeo defended it...he isn't "joking".
Yeah, he left that part out, didn't he? As always. His Tulsa embarrassment is what caused this. There'll be more, though they won't get this kind of attention. Trump is a walking death sentence if you're anywhere near what he is doing. Literally.
Gutless decision for the schools by #Minnesota. You just did the same thing that #Trump has been doing with #COVID__19 by passing the buck downward to each individual district. No cohesive leadership. At least that is how I am interpreting your “plan”.
Imagine defending trump to the point that you scream at your black daughter while she’s holding your black grandchild  saying he’s not racist that’s all the biased media. I’m so angry to the point that I don’t think we will be returning for daycare tomorrow.
I'm a Democrat and damn right I'd refuse it because it does not work no matter how much Trump thinks its a miracle drug.

Jimmy Carter couldn't be at the funeral for John Lewis because he's 95.  Trump couldn't because he's 5.
In the last 72 hours, the President shit tweets about being butt hurt over why his name is trending on Twitter, he threatens to delay the election, the GDP plunges by 33%  and Obama delivers a lights out Eulogy at John Lewis' funeral. Not a great few days for Donny Trump.
As John Lewis is laid to rest, Trump and his followers vow to take care of those pesky Northern agitators in Mississippi.
My favorite hypocrisy of the Trump era are the lefties who preach tolerance, love and acceptance but also have an entire political compass guided by their hate for Trump.
Yikes 😬  But he can't do that though too, congress should and will definitely not do this.  But in other context, Trump will throw anything as a curveball for this election. Like possibly not wanting to accept if he loses.  So get out there, and vote for Biden. Please.

You mean trump...China's economy is fine. We are the only country suffering like this
Liberals get mad at you for not criticizing Republicans enough but then get mad at you for criticizing President Bush. They really do have no ideology beyond "Trump is bad."
He was infected at a Trump rally by a virus Trump said was a Chinese hoax. His death was preventable.
Hell, even Trump’s propaganda mill saw it coming and spoke about it
He may be trying to gain their favor, but the generals are mostly in opposition to Trump. Nobody wants to work under a dictator. So, while they may act all peaches and cream with him, remember that he's still their boss; for now. You've never sucked up to a boss you hate?
What does Trump keep taking about plausma?
Plenty of people saw it coming
Trump has dictator envy..
I think you are the one that needs God pivoting that hard to make a perverse argument about why his death at his age is justified. He went to Trump's rally maskless (as all were encouraged to do), he had his photo op, was in the hospital 10 days later and dead 5 weeks later.
THIS is the reason behind Trump's tweet about delaying the election. His only reason for being is the "great" economy. He'd need to delay the election for years for that to help him because this will be a slow recovery. He's desperate and losing.
Trump plans to address United Nations General Assembly in person Unfortunately for them world leaders won't have the opportunity to laugh in the FACE of the #MoronInChief ⁦ this year, having to do it virtually instead! #TrumpIsAJOKE
God is love? Thats a pretty big accusation to accuse trump of his death. You couldn't keep politics out of it, could you? You are awesome and I am sure your god approves
Ask Trump about the Russian bounties and we will
What can be done if red state electors give their electoral votes to Trump even if Biden wins the state?
They won’t. The minute Trump is gone the GOP loses all the feral, left behind voters he drew out of the nooks and crannies of rural forgotten America with his racist campaign launch. The people who rarely see, much less personally know, any black or Hispanic people.
Of course nothing is beneath this insect named Trump. But he's not omnipotent. He cannot delay or cancel the elections.
To be clear: it’s now the TRUMP ECONOMY &amp; TRUMP VIRUS. — TRUMP ECONOMY = 32 million unemployed; 15+ million to lose  assistance;  51% of households w/ lower income; 33% drop in GDP. — TRUMP PANDEMIC = 152,000 Covid deaths; 72,000 new cases; 4.5 million cases total.—NEVER FORGET.
I love that Trump is just BEGGING to extend the election, it’s like when you haven’t started your project and you already know you’re absolutely fucked
I can see that as racist.  It screams white privilege.  Trump has been so disrespectful of Minneapolis, Portland and Seattle and all three are left wing stronghold.  So, Trump is just showing he is an asshole.
3 former Presidents attended the #JohnLewisHomegoing. Both Clinton and Obama (Nancy Pelosi, was also great) were fantastic. But my respect continues to grow for #GeorgeWBush Him being there is an example of respect and class that tRump should see.
Some people might say "Well Trump can't DO that! That's a Congressional function! The President has no..."  Poppycock, of course. Trump does half a dozen things every day that are illegal and unconstitutional, and the  simply enables him.
Trump knows he’s lost the support of the military
With 96 days left before the election, Trump is doing what we all knew he was going to try to do.  there will be no delay to the election, most Americans will risk dying to vote Trump out of the White House....
No fucking way will I vote by mail in, I trashed that app the day it arrived.  I am VOTING in PERSON.  I will wear whatever is requested of me to do so.  Mail in votes can be and will be tampered with and conveniently lost.  All so the dems can try and get the upperhand.  TRUMP
Trump can't postpone the election, and he can't cancel it. This isn't up to him. The date is set by Congress, and the House won't agree to change the date no matter what.  Trump's trying to distract from the Lewis funeral and the economic crash. Ignore his tantrum.
Readers Write: #IvankaTrump's visit to Minnesota showed #NativeAmerican women spurious support.
It doesn't have to be true, they just have to get enough of their followers to accept/believe that that's true, and they will willingly fight against the election.  These supposed "patriots" will denounce the most democratic process we still have if Trump wants them to.
Pretty telling that republicans will back every single thing Trump says except the idea that they might have to put up with him longer by postponing the election.
If I was battling cancer, I'd want my last big event to be a Trump rally. That's the difference with Conservatives. We believe in personal freedom. We don't need to be told what to do.
They always claim it is a "joke" and then Trump does it.  That is not an option anymore.  Trump said it. Everything he has done is leading to it.  Trump is an autocratic dictator, and he must be treated as such.
Trump should go to prison for mass murder. He isn't doing his job by protecting the American people. 🌊🌊🌊The northern snobs and liberal elites didn't bother trying to understand what Wallace was actually trying to say and RFK got assasinated, just like how the liberal elites don't bother understanding Trump and attack him nonstop and they basically "assassinated" Bernie from winning
A lot of the rich people who are allowed to control our country are the ones that are getting away with a lot of things because they can cover things up
Thank God for President Trump
What dress will Trump wear tomorrow?
If he did catch the virus at Trump’s rally, then yes. Trump definitely shares some of the blame for holding a rally like that in the middle of a pandemic. It was a dumb thing to do, and we all knew people would likely die from it.
if we can have an election in the middle of a civil war (1864) and the world war (1944) and a Cold War (1968) then we can have an election during a pandemic (covid-19) and a national cancer (tRump) (11/3/20)
Thank God for President Trump
Trump's Tulsa Death March took Herman Cain...
I'm saying, none of this shit would've happend if they let Bernie Sanders win in 2016. Pelosi and the Clintons rig elections at home and then spend 4 years blaming Russia and Trump for everything instead of helping actual people? 🤔
President Bernie Sanders! It's obvious DNC rigged 2016 Election because they wanted to make sure working-class people who work pay-check to pay-check lose health care and kicked out of their houses during a pandemic, so can blame it on Trump to try to create a Communist Uprising.
Voting by mail is good enough for him and most of the people in his administration, but when he is getting trounced in the polls it is suddenly a crisis requiring a delay? The only way he can be more openly fascist is to literally burn down the House.
Trump always has to start the day by stirring the pot and making political Twitter lose its shit
Why is it every time Trump says something people go nuts? Because he's exposing Big Pharma &amp; other special interests. Just like how Omar bringing down other special interests too. Funny how both are for ending war in Afghanistan, which was just tool of Military-Industrial Complex
“Delay the election” - Trump
Trump made his suggestion during a series of tweets in which he again protested proposals to allow mail-in voting, saying that system is too vulnerable to fraud.
I totally believe even though it’s fake that that’s the true way trump thinks

Trump made him do it
100% I agree with you we must fight for President Trump because he is always fighting for us the American people
Trump's  light are on, but nobody's home.
It turned ugly because trump responded  with violence in the beginning. Remember the  bible walk. Ivanka's lame brained idea. No words of compassion just that piss poor response.
Putin has the Golden Shower tapes. Starring Donald Trump.
Trump is on the slippery slope. His polls are in the low 30's &amp; high 20's. No President since Hoover has been despised so much.
Exactly...he was a black man that supported Donald Trump so Biden’s “you ain’t black” went into full effect!  Biden should be charged as an accomplice🤷🏻‍♀️
He’s talking about Biden trying to force a corrupt General Prosecutor out of the Ukrainian administration and leveraging aid money to do so, which happened, but it’s also far from illegal and nothing like what Trump did, so it doesn’t help his point at all.
Ah, but Donald "Take the guns first, go through due process second" Trump is the right guy for you.  Ok bud.
Trump OFTEN forgets his train of thought.
So far, every criticism the right has thrown at Biden is just projection. It's everything they love about Trump, just in a Democrat's body. That's what they don't like.
Trump brags about passing a basic cognitive test that anybody without dementia can pass.  And Trump can't speak very well either. His sentences drag on and on and go in 100 different directions, avoiding the questions completely.

Hard to imagine Trump openly supporting (via pitch) an organization that is actively allowing space for players to kneel and show solidarity.  Also, STOP CALLING IT THE CHINA VIRUS.  Whoops— did I hijack your tweet? You’re totally right, btw.
Trump will win by a landslide
Trump WON in 2016 and didn't even accept the results of the election.  Why should we expect him to this year?
Trump is the crime, trump is the violence, trump is the problem.

Let's remember that just because Biden is doing great in the polls does NOT automatically mean that he will win this Nov. We learned our lesson the hard way in 2016 when many of us got very complacent. If we want to insure a Biden victory, it's up to all of us to vote Trump out.
We have to vote for President Trump to save America
Trump is loved by all Americans we will win by a landslide and the polls are nothing but liars by the Democrats!! Just remember the pose that Hillary Clinton was going to win and she didn’t Trump won fair and square and he will again
My sister is very democrat, but she hates what she is seeing and hearing the left do. Their disgusting tactics are far beyond her personal beliefs. She will be voting for Trump in 20201

That’s exactly what we want! Trump’s reign of terror has to end.

They didn’t try to impeach Trump, they did impeach Trump. The kiss ass Senate failed to convict Trump.
They can pray all they want, if that’s true, but they can't make Trump be a good person or a decent president.

Trump told us himself. Said he was going to run the country like one of his businesses.

Trump has officially done more to recognize the death of Herman Cain, a serial sexual harassing pizza magnate and failed presidential candidate than John Lewis, a pioneer and icon of the civil rights movement and voting rights.
Tried to feel sorry for a second, but what a fucking dumbass to go to that Trump rally, let alone not wear a mask. Oh AND he beat stage 4 cancer?!? Sheesh. The stupidity.
Yeah, he left that part out, didn't he? As always. His Tulsa embarrassment is what caused this. There'll be more, though they won't get this kind of attention. Trump is a walking death sentence if you're anywhere near what he is doing. Literally.
THIS is the reason behind Trump's tweet about delaying the election. His only reason for being is the "great" economy. He'd need to delay the election for years for that to help him because this will be a slow recovery. He's desperate and losing.
God is love? Thats a pretty big accusation to accuse trump of his death. You couldn't keep politics out of it, could you? You are awesome and I am sure your god approves
I won't celebrate this, who would? But, I do want to note that no one is immune to this disease despite the never ending efforts of Trump to pretend it is not laying waste to America. The nation is in grave danger. Reopening schools would make it worse.

Not so dissimilar to what the administration did with the National Weather Service as soon as Trump took office. Because science keeps saying things that are politically inconvenient to fascists, these fascists have taken a cudgel to science.

Facts are facts, 1st time in history we had that long of steady economy growth without a recession. Its was many years long after the last GOP economy failure of Bush. Keep in mind trump exploited the deficit long before his damage from failure to take the virus serious.

'My blood boils': Trump's admission angers ex-GOP lawmaker
who the heck is painting his face? That has to be the worse makeup job ever A Trump U grad?
I would tag  but he is scared of trump. What gives? Putin get everything and more he could wish for. #TrumpIsATraitor
Trump would’ve beat biden if it wasnt for corona
There are 2 kinds of Trump voters: racist and those who don’t see his racism as a dealbreaker.
The only true statement tRump has made.  "Nobody likes him". #NobodyLikesTrump
After helping my father-in-law move lumber to the backyard I came inside and am now hearing the in-laws talk about their pro Trump BS  and bashing the Democrats. Oh joy. At least I'm drinking a beer so I've at least got that going for me.
Wrong it’s the Trump Virus you ass hole racist
Trump will keep Texas infected with COVID-19
No. I'll wait until there is a CDC, under someone other than Trump, approved vaccine. I wouldn't take anything from Putin, doesn't matter what it is.
Despicable Donald isn't even trying to disguise his racism anymore. This tweet should be heavily featured in  ads the rest of the campaign. This is low even for Trump.
You are an idiot. If given a fair shake at the bank for financing. There are plenty of brown people that that can easily afford nice homes. What they are paying today in rent many times exceeds mortgage costs. Trump &amp; his dad played the same BS with renting and were convicted
I don't think Neil needs worry about distracting Trump, all he does is tweet and I fully support Neil's comments on the few things Trump has focused on recently particularly the trampling of the First Amendment and his unwanted storm trooper incursions.
Biden has to do an outstanding job of fixing all that Trump broke because the mid terms are often hard on the new president's party, so the focus has to shift immediately for the DNC and all progressives after 1/21 to the 2022 elections. Great candidates, great policies.
And all Trump is tweeting about is how much money he is giving states he won in 2016. Not a peep about the real issues facing America caused by his utter incompetence and indifference.
And demons from having sex. trump???
If he did that, he wouldn't have photos for his ads touting "Biden's America". Stupid idiot doesn't even realize that this is actually Trump's America and we all know it!
I'm with them for now, but not with money, I don't want my money used against Democrats once Trump and his kind are excised from that party. I think the sorting will begin in 2022 when many more republican senators are running than Democrats. That's an important election too.

He is a trump wannabe
Nothing at all please advise trump that OBAMA is not running and either is Hillary
Has anyone seen Jim Jordan ask trump what about Russian bounties on our military???  Have any GOP asked
Odd. How I'd characterize Barr's testimony yesterday. So much he was "unaware" of in a job he has to be aware of everything. Aware enough to fire prosecutors looking into Trump, interfere in cases, but not of real threats, like on  He lies.
Newsweek has lost so much money and prestige that they are now resorting to reporting the truth! Scary!
But remember how much she didn’t like this and that? 😂😂😂. I think she loved this and that. She wants to be a trump girl.
"If I were to vote again for Donald Trump in 2020, it would be just as much a failure as an American, but also a failure as a human being.”
Jonathan Swan getting it done. Now explain to me how Trump still has supporters after listening to this disaster?
EXCLUSIVE: How Brett Kavanaugh tried to sidestep abortion and Trump financial docs cases. Behind closed doors, he looks to please dueling factions of the court as he seeks to move beyond the angry and defiant image he projected in 2018.
Yes Dem's hold the line Do NOT give that $2 Billion to protect trump hotel The FBI can build a new bigger and better main office for less elsewhere like they planned. Trump is only worried someone will turn the old building into a Hotel across the street from his #MoscowMitch
Trump Government have killed more Americans this year alone than 9-11
Biden and Trump
You can't make this sh$t up!..Trump followers are defending this wackadoodle "doctor" and her claims..I'm just baffled!
Or when Obama let the PPE stockpile run out to make Trump look bad 3 years later?
The size if a hippo.  Do trump and Barr eat together all day???
trump is obsessed with walls.
Yup - they’re called Trump Radio, Trump Radio Jr, and Pence Radio
So let me get this straight. The  has earmarked almost 2B in stimulus funds for a new FBI building to save Trump's hotel? And there isn't enough money to help unemployed Americans and hungry children? I am absolutely ashamed of our Congress!!.
One of many stories on this:
Wouldn’t it be fun to line up trump and his parasites, Barr, and the rest of the White House crew pay 100.00 to smack
We are waiting for November. Have no choice. trump will be trying all sorts of crap before the election. He will still be tweeting and talking. Usually says something incriminating. Today he was back about hydronchloride??  Wants people to use.  drs said do not listen to trump
We are waiting for November.  trump will be trying many things between now and the election. He will also say and do stupid things. I am optimistic but will not give up until November 4th
trump
I know.  There are slot of trump people agitating this whole situation.
Got her medical degree on Jupiter? Or from Trump university?
OMG.  just wait besides Fauci is a genius and trump be crazy. trump will say or do something stupid
These people don't even understand that Hitler's economic policies were more in-line with Trump's than the "Nazi Germany" they refer to. So, like, yeah, your boy in charge makes this similar to WW2 Germany. If the left was in charge it would be Stalinist Russia-esque.
One of few statements Americans can agree upon. Great  campaign ad Once again Trump's own words &amp; free
A trump clone
Trump is reading a speech he's given before
Wonder if Pence is on the ticket if Trump gets desperate
this should be removed. There are far more people running for POTUS than Biden and Trump.
trump is a fascist
Does it actually surprise anyone that Trump's campaign is STILL playing fast and loose with campaign finance rules? This is his pattern, he did it in 2016, he's still at it. Going to be hard too spend that money from jail.
trump was asked if he loses would he leave the White House and trump said “I will see”
trump??
But he did tell ABC in an interview that trump's tweets make his job Impossible Which is it?
Yep its too bad the trump administration let in over 430K chinese + 40K Americans to fly into the USA Countless from and Europe unchecked About 1300 flights, many of which landed within NY The infections were imported to them and by large numbers. But yes, lets blame Gov Cuomo 🙄
No. Just no. Trump cancelled those programs, redirected the funds. Obviously they are not needed or he wouldn't have done so. No free pass on thwarting the will of Congress in previously passed appropriations. This bill is for COVID funding only.
Did trump have a stroke???
Right! Europe did NOT do what trump here has done They attacked the virus, hence the reason Americans are barred to travel to over 150 counties on this globe Other counties did what was needed to be done to minimize and stop/slow the infections Not here in the good ol USA
His most bird-brained tweet yet. What an achievement, like no one would believe, many people say. Trump wants to make comments he doesn't like illegal. This is NOT a communist country, Donnie. You are not a dictator, no matter how much you act like one.
31,000 plus cases in children under 18, with zero idea of what the long term effects of this virus might be on the very young. Still, Trump and his party are pushing to reopen schools and infect more children, teachers and their communities. Insanity.
Trump has made all kinds of promises of better healthcare, pro-LGBT rights, what have you. It's just anyone who believed them had to be severally naive. The Dems are much more insidious.
It was great.  Still think barr and trump had something to do with Epstein’s death. barr was “barred” from seeing Epstein’s girlfriend who has lots of information
trump is broke and will continue to use whatever he can to make money
Best image ever are the giant trump balloons
trump is very fearful of all the people that are against him. Back to the bunkers !!  trumps wall fell over again.  I guess their quality control isn’t so great
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa....trump jr. gets 12 hours for spreading lies and I get 3 days for too many follows? what in the actual fuck twitter? #protecttherch
He’s on podcasts and other news shows he’s not allowed at briefings because trump feels that he’s being upstaged poor thing
I forgive one mistake...it would be telling if he would vote for Trump again in 2020. That would be a deal breaker
He has a baseball card now that’s selling out which is driving trump crazy too
You talking about when trump tried to bribe the Ukraine to find dirt on Joe Niden???
trump does not live a Christian life. He has broken almost all the Ten Commandments. Real Christians do not follow trump
Yes, Florida has been a beacon of strength and bold leadership in the Trump model!
Sux being embarrassed that the trump cult is as bad as trump himself? That's the strange feelings that should have started years ago..
"Trump is a fool, a liar, and a failure" Yep, that pretty much sums it up. #AmericaOrTrump  #TrumpVirus2020
The people who want to get rid of Trump want it so, so bad that they will let people die. They have silenced doctors like these, and bet your last dollar, they will go after these doctors.
Repubs are the party of adultry, theft, do nothing   Non Christian stupid jerks. They get paid for what. Hundreds of bills some bi partisan tha sit on #MoscowMitch s desk. He works for trump not the people of the USA
Well I do believe in my Savior and I do practice kindness, empathy, forgiveness, and my faith. trump does none of this. He is NOT a Christian. I am truthful not hypocritical. You are supporting a godless man
Barr is trying to conceal the erection he gets in Trump’s presence.
More like a PUTZ...... Trump calls MN response to protests 'laughingstock.' Walz responds, 'No one's laughing ... we're in pain.'  via
Well, for me, I began to see it much more when President Obama was first inaugurated. I knew we were racist but what came from under the rocks then disgusted me. Trump has only made it worse by making it okay to be a complete ass in public all the time.
I had to read your tweet a couple of times before I realized you meant that tRump is a coward.  That is what you are saying, right?
Just like Trump’s sheriff’s star!
Really? After the last two years, since Barr especially, you are surprised by republicans trying to intimidate people with threats? That is literally Trump’s entire business plan, his entire life. It’s completely in character, or lack of, for them.
Anxiously awaiting the inevitable palace intrigue story that Trump is angry at O’Brien for getting infected...
Melania Trump announces Rose Garden renovation   Like the Rose garden really needs updating she just needs to spend some more money
Melania Trump announces Rose Garden renovation
If you think Trump cares about saving lives or minimizing infections, you are again mistaken
Trump had more words of praise for a child sex trafficker than a civil rights icon.
It's really interesting when they get caught doing violent and destructive things these guys end up being white supremacist not the protesters. That's what happened in Minneapolis. Looks like another Trump stunt.
Just curious, before today how many times did anyone in the trump orbit mention missing and murdered Native Americans?
Not really a surprise, Trump loves insulting or slighting those who cannot respond.  Refusing to honor the death of a civil rights icon is a no brainer.
Me neither. Nikki Haley has been particularly obsequious in the last week or so, I can easily see Trump thinking he'll win back all the women by putting her on his losing ticket. The man's desperate, as he should be given just 32% approve of his performance.
Sad thing is....trump was the EVIL.
This article is devastating. But truth sometimes hurts. Trump has done more harm to our international standing and relationships than anyone expected. That can be repaired, and will, but it may well, as the story points out, take more than two elections.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
He'll be too busy? Doing more of nothing? All the man does is tweet and get tested for the virus? There'll be no later in this season and he won't be around for any others. He couldn't get the ball to the plate anyway unless he rolled it like a putt.
I feel the same. I don't wish ill on anyone but I can't find it in me to have empathy for Trump. I just can't.
Not on ANY day. The man is a born liar, equal, almost to Trump himself. He's cooking the books and STILL his state is on fire.
You know, Trump keeps rolling the dice, I don't care how often he's tested, his arrogance is going to catch up to him one of these days. He's in a very high risk group too. When it does, I will send him thoughts. Dark thoughts.
I do know. Quite a legacy, isn't it? I did enjoy the news that Reagan Foundation isn't happy with Trump using their name even. That's irony.
I would go out on a limb and say there are more silent Backstreet Boys fans than there are silent Trump fans.
It did that. He also began demonizing poor people, especially Black women with his fake "welfare queen" story. Though, even he would have been better than  on every day of the trump administration.
A Trump administration official triggering outbreaks in other countries would have been rejected as too on the nose in the screenplay draft.  Why aren't these people wearing masks?
The Trump Administration isn't even warning or quarantining its own people.  How can they expect to lead the country on this?
If you vote your conscience, Trump may be voted out of office in 99 days and only president for another 177 days. But who’s counting...
Well, he "claims" he had no idea what Trump was up to and wouldn't have done it if he'd known. May be true. Trump's not really a sharing kind of guy. The chairman of the joint chiefs is not the person Trump would be concerned with anyway. The others, yes. Plus the Secret Service.
He is not a dictator, king, the forefathers wrote that federal troops can only invade if the Governor of a state asks for help. trump is breaking the law
Oregon Ag must be a trump thug
Trump finally got his wall...
You can’t even say with a straight face that he’s not a racist, xenophobic, bigot.    So presumably you’re going with “I support Trump, but I don’t support his racist, xenophobic, bigoted policies”—which puts you in the “not a deal breaker” category.
Long as I've been alive been over five decades I have always wondered how the GOP gets us into debt wars etc and then blames it on the liberals?Gop led by trump pushing this country to the brink of total collapse.
Ask Trump if Covid-19 is a Hoax.
Let us not forget that Donald Trump seems to be OK with Russia putting bounties on US troops.
Howbout them perscription drugs? Trump did great. Howbout a little shoutout for your man President Trump. Haven't you been fighting for that very thing?
Trump's wall is falling apart
Bad news for you bro, if you support Trump, you’re either a racist or his racism isn’t a deal breaker for you.   I’m curious why you would support a man who’s openly racist, homophobic, bigoted &amp; fumbled Covid  so badly, we are the only 1st world country struggling to contain it
Which explains Haley’s extreme obsequiousness the past week. Pence goes down because Donnie takes no responsibility for anything ever. Won’t help because she’s proven herself to be as bad as Trump.
The Trump virus you mean? It’s got his name on it now because of all the nothing he’s done about it. So history will record.
President Trump has had almost all against him the swamp,major news,hollywood, numerous billionaire's, all he has is the heart of true Americans.
Ah, people. Please, protests must remain peaceful, anything less plays into Trump's hands. We have to be better than he and his party of storm troopers. This is not the time for violence. Protest, that's our right but don't give them reason to use force.
There is no Republican Party anymore, only Trump.
We already get the truth of whats going on in Portland. The people causing any problems are the right-wing nuts. This is how it is during the Trump administration.
Yes, have you seen a Trump rally? I've never seen anything more obnoxious in my life - beginning back in 2015, continuing to this day. These are truly horrid people. Lawless, though they are on about protecting the police, they are themselves lawless.
OMG trump does not live a Christian life,  trump has broken almost all the Ten Commandments. Real Christians do not follow trump
For those of you that don’t know what’s going on right now... Trump is implementing the executive order that got JFK assasinated and that’s why the shut downs have been extended. He’s doing this to defund the rothchilds wealth and tear apart the deep state. Invest in silver now.
Quick signature: Tell the Trump administration and Congress to protect the CDC and fund testing and contact tracing!
I find it interesting that you seem to oppose cancel culture on the left (which can certainly go too far), but have no words for the Right. Trump and his allies engage in it both rhetorically and in actual action all the time.

Kudlow is delusional just like trump he’s trying to keep the president placated and in a little bubble so he really doesn’t know what’s happening in the real world give us a break
Absolutely better to vote for trump
Facebook has far too much power — and uses it to let Donald Trump run lying ads so they can profit. It's time for federal regulators to investigate #Facebook and act.
This is Trump’s America.
They caved to trump because Redfield is afraid to lose his job
Nero fiddled while Rome burned. Trump plays golf and lets Putin fiddle with our democracy.
The entire Trump/GOP is so alarmingly incompetent it scares hell out of me.
That is quite true. He didn’t invent this party, he just caught an unexpected wave. This is the party that Paul Ryan, in the minority, was the brilliant budget master of during GWB’s time. Trump’s a late comer, these old white racists have been around a long time.
I moved here 3 years ago because I was done with Chicago but wanted to live somewhere progressive. Metro area yes. But love brought me to the northern burbs and I have 3 Trump flags in a3 block radius and screaming TRAITORS! every time I drive by is satisfying yet sad.
True. She said if Biden wins we’ll have socialism like the nazis. Who were fascists like Trump and his entire party and idiot followers like her. People really are that stupid. Plus racism.
Trump hates Law Enforcement, especially if law enforcement is coming after him and his stooges.Translation: Trump knows he’s gonna lose so wants to launder campaign coffers into his pockets
Boy you must be shaking in your boots just saying that so I am sure your going to be coming out with a bunch of tweets kissing Trump's ass in the next few days
“He’s not the sharpest knife in the drawer,” the president reportedly said in 2017, after the full extent of Don Jr.'s haphazardly arranged Trump Tower Moscow meeting came to light.
I didn't screen cap but the Q's were CD5, likely vote screen, Trump 1-10, Biden 1-10, who you voted for in 2016, demo questions. No messaging.
I don't think Trump realizes the sky is blue and his days in office are numbered.
This is nothing but more political theater. They'll abandon #trans rights *again* to gain something else in negotiations.  We see through your faux advocacy  Don't bother unless you'll put your foot down &amp; make this a deal-breaker.    #LGBTQ
Trump's motto should be... Make America White Again....   that's what he really means.  He's trying to stop the growth of people with brown, black, red,  and any other color. In 25 years whites will not be the minority and that burns his racist blood
Trump is blaming the democrats I’m amazed he believes what he is saying.  The democrats passed a bill back in May
What a joke. "The hard left is angry". Everyone who isn't a white supremacist, racist, doesn't want to die of COVID-19, cares about other people, wants equal rights for all, wants healthcare for all and much more is angry with republicans. You're over.
Trump doesn't want the election to happen, but he can't stop it. #WeWillVote
I had cataract surgery today, 122/68 - which surprised me a lot. Because the news is horrible with record setting COVID deaths every day and more to come. Maybe it's the prospect of a huge loss for Trump in just over three months that calms me.
Trump has officially done more to recognize the death of Herman Cain, a serial sexual harassing pizza magnate and failed presidential candidate than John Lewis, a pioneer and icon of the civil rights movement and voting rights.
Yeah, he left that part out, didn't he? As always. His Tulsa embarrassment is what caused this. There'll be more, though they won't get this kind of attention. Trump is a walking death sentence if you're anywhere near what he is doing. Literally.
No one has ever bankrupted Fascism better than Trump. By the time he's done with it the Supreme Court will have to declare it illegal.
THIS is the reason behind Trump's tweet about delaying the election. His only reason for being is the "great" economy. He'd need to delay the election for years for that to help him because this will be a slow recovery. He's desperate and losing.
God is love? Thats a pretty big accusation to accuse trump of his death. You couldn't keep politics out of it, could you? You are awesome and I am sure your god approves
I won't celebrate this, who would? But, I do want to note that no one is immune to this disease despite the never ending efforts of Trump to pretend it is not laying waste to America. The nation is in grave danger. Reopening schools would make it worse.
Trump doesn't Care about America.  Period.

Trump is terrified he'll lose the election so he doesn't want to have one.  Let's vote this jerk out of office   November 3rd.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Not so dissimilar to what the administration did with the National Weather Service as soon as Trump took office. Because science keeps saying things that are politically inconvenient to fascists, these fascists have taken a cudgel to science.
Never underestimate Trump’s ability to saw a tree limb off from underneath his supporters.
No, Trump cannot delay the election.  Sheesh.
Facts are facts, 1st time in history we had that long of steady economy growth without a recession. Its was many years long after the last GOP economy failure of Bush. Keep in mind trump exploited the deficit long before his damage from failure to take the virus serious.
This tweet is on par with "Trump is Thanos" in its utter lack of comprehension of pop culture (in this case, football.) Minnesota loved Herschel Walker? Hey Vikings fans, can I get a fact check?
Like touting US Covid death rates, Trump’s June economic touchdown dance has aged just as well...
Putin owns Trump
And yeah, I’m drunk rn, but I can’t be the only one who thinks that human lives are worth more than hating trump
Also are we just ignoring the fact that covid may have a cure just bc we don’t like trump? Bc that’s more fucked up than all the shit that trump has said
Bad spelling by Trump. Maybe because he's illiterate.
Trump continues to be Putin’s wet dream at every turn.
This guy is why we need Trump out!

Trump had more words of praise for a child sex trafficker than a civil rights icon.
It's really interesting when they get caught doing violent and destructive things these guys end up being white supremacist not the protesters. That's what happened in Minneapolis. Looks like another Trump stunt.
Not really a surprise, Trump loves insulting or slighting those who cannot respond.  Refusing to honor the death of a civil rights icon is a no brainer.
Me neither. Nikki Haley has been particularly obsequious in the last week or so, I can easily see Trump thinking he'll win back all the women by putting her on his losing ticket. The man's desperate, as he should be given just 32% approve of his performance.
Sad thing is....trump was the EVIL.
This article is devastating. But truth sometimes hurts. Trump has done more harm to our international standing and relationships than anyone expected. That can be repaired, and will, but it may well, as the story points out, take more than two elections.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
He'll be too busy? Doing more of nothing? All the man does is tweet and get tested for the virus? There'll be no later in this season and he won't be around for any others. He couldn't get the ball to the plate anyway unless he rolled it like a putt.
I feel the same. I don't wish ill on anyone but I can't find it in me to have empathy for Trump. I just can't.
Not on ANY day. The man is a born liar, equal, almost to Trump himself. He's cooking the books and STILL his state is on fire.
You know, Trump keeps rolling the dice, I don't care how often he's tested, his arrogance is going to catch up to him one of these days. He's in a very high risk group too. When it does, I will send him thoughts. Dark thoughts.
Ivanka Trump Set To Visit Minnesota Monday
I do know. Quite a legacy, isn't it? I did enjoy the news that Reagan Foundation isn't happy with Trump using their name even. That's irony.
I would go out on a limb and say there are more silent Backstreet Boys fans than there are silent Trump fans.
It did that. He also began demonizing poor people, especially Black women with his fake "welfare queen" story. Though, even he would have been better than  on every day of the trump administration.
A Trump administration official triggering outbreaks in other countries would have been rejected as too on the nose in the screenplay draft.  Why aren't these people wearing masks?
The Trump Administration isn't even warning or quarantining its own people.  How can they expect to lead the country on this?
Politifact is twisting itself into a pretzel. Last week, they said Trump kept his promise to protect SS because even tho he proposed cuts, Congress didn't make them. Now, he *kinda saved* the coal industry despite widespread bankruptcies, declining tonnage and fewer jobs.
Well, he "claims" he had no idea what Trump was up to and wouldn't have done it if he'd known. May be true. Trump's not really a sharing kind of guy. The chairman of the joint chiefs is not the person Trump would be concerned with anyway. The others, yes. Plus the Secret Service.
More #FoxNews #GOP propaganda by Christian Whiton who was a senior advisor in the Donald Trump and George W. Bush administrations. Written for #Trump to convince him there are still those hidden voters who just won’t admit they support Trump.
You can’t even say with a straight face that he’s not a racist, xenophobic, bigot.    So presumably you’re going with “I support Trump, but I don’t support his racist, xenophobic, bigoted policies”—which puts you in the “not a deal breaker” category.
Ask Trump if Covid-19 is a Hoax.
Let us not forget that Donald Trump seems to be OK with Russia putting bounties on US troops.
Bad news for you bro, if you support Trump, you’re either a racist or his racism isn’t a deal breaker for you.   I’m curious why you would support a man who’s openly racist, homophobic, bigoted &amp; fumbled Covid  so badly, we are the only 1st world country struggling to contain it
Which explains Haley’s extreme obsequiousness the past week. Pence goes down because Donnie takes no responsibility for anything ever. Won’t help because she’s proven herself to be as bad as Trump.
The Trump virus you mean? It’s got his name on it now because of all the nothing he’s done about it. So history will record.
Mr. Trump how much longer are we going to allow these spineless mayors of several cities to let these cities be destroyed and innocent citizens injured or killed. This is a sad time in America and someone has to step up and take care of business
Ah, people. Please, protests must remain peaceful, anything less plays into Trump's hands. We have to be better than he and his party of storm troopers. This is not the time for violence. Protest, that's our right but don't give them reason to use force.
There is no Republican Party anymore, only Trump.
We already get the truth of whats going on in Portland. The people causing any problems are the right-wing nuts. This is how it is during the Trump administration.
Yes, have you seen a Trump rally? I've never seen anything more obnoxious in my life - beginning back in 2015, continuing to this day. These are truly horrid people. Lawless, though they are on about protecting the police, they are themselves lawless.
For those of you that don’t know what’s going on right now... Trump is implementing the executive order that got JFK assasinated and that’s why the shut downs have been extended. He’s doing this to defund the rothchilds wealth and tear apart the deep state. Invest in silver now.
I find it interesting that you seem to oppose cancel culture on the left (which can certainly go too far), but have no words for the Right. Trump and his allies engage in it both rhetorically and in actual action all the time.
Trump Searching for a Cellmate in 2021.
This guy is a Latinos for trump guy we all know he never got beat as a kid and is probably a boot licker so let him have his fun guys
Since trump, we’re anything but civilized. I’ll keep fighting.
Kudlow is delusional just like trump he’s trying to keep the president placated and in a little bubble so he really doesn’t know what’s happening in the real world give us a break
Facebook has far too much power — and uses it to let Donald Trump run lying ads so they can profit. It's time for federal regulators to investigate #Facebook and act.
This is Trump’s America.
They caved to trump because Redfield is afraid to lose his job
The entire Trump/GOP is so alarmingly incompetent it scares hell out of me.
Hell yes I'm voting for Trump Democrats have to kill me for my vote oh that's right dead folks don't vote in this year's election surprise
That is quite true. He didn’t invent this party, he just caught an unexpected wave. This is the party that Paul Ryan, in the minority, was the brilliant budget master of during GWB’s time. Trump’s a late comer, these old white racists have been around a long time.
Not to mention fomenting armed conflict everywhere. The country is in shambles, and Trump is rubbing his little hands together in glee.
True. She said if Biden wins we’ll have socialism like the nazis. Who were fascists like Trump and his entire party and idiot followers like her. People really are that stupid. Plus racism.
Trump hates Law Enforcement, especially if law enforcement is coming after him and his stooges.
Trump throwing paper towels to the Puerto Rican Hurricane survivors. Very disrespectful.  Very disappointing.  Hmmmm...
Trump t shirt  .....shocking.
I am not an Obama fan but I would never use or condone such a despicable word. I didn’t like the Obama presidency but not because of his skin color. I thought he had bad policy but for the most part was a good man.   Concerned about his possible involvement on spying on Trump.
My whole family was tested for the tRump Virus on July 14th. It took 8 days for my results, 9 for my sons and the hubby still hasn't heard yet.  And even with insurance, we'll be out of pocket around $300.
I love how he’s got a trump shirt on too.  Trump and Nazi go hand in hand.  I’m not sure she even knows what’s up.
How in the fuck is this trump's fault.  Are you truly this srupid?
Donald Trump
I’m not voting for Biden or for Trump.  I’m writing in 🌸Tulsi Gabbard🌺, unless Jesse Ventura ends up on the ticket some how.
Can’t you see trump doing this too? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You know, I thought he was a buffoon and I really didn't like him at all. I still don't like a lot of what he did. But I saw Natalie Mains quoted (after all the trouble she got in with his cult) as saying she'd rather make out with him than meet Trump. I'm hetero but I agree. :^)
I absolutely believe this is true. Trump has been trying to do away with the USPS since he took office, he must have a financial interest in some other process, or just a strong desire to screw up mail in voting which he whines about continually. Mail IS slow since March.
is one of my heroes. Next to  and  my favorite  hosts too. She is completely on point in this short spot. America must be SO much better than this. It's a horror for women that can't be tolerated any longer
Pandering to the Super Religious Trump again?
Out of all things in the Trump book, this might be up there with the worst
If this doesn't capture the mood of the moment in the Trump administration, I don't know what does. They did the same to the CDC guidelines for reopening schools as  pointed out so well last night.
No one respects the troops like the Trump Administration!!!!
Trump so committed to grifting from his campaign, he’s letting down-ballot races go unfunded.
That’s our problem . We are willing to consider someone not qualified to be president as a potential candidate ? Did we not learn anything from trump? She needs a hell of a lot more experience before I’d consider her as a candidate . Not even as accomplished as the VP women
most cashiers are adults that can make the choice for themselves.  Children on the other hand, thats is the responsibility of the parents.  Again, No Trump cult rallies and no RNC plans as of now. Why? Risk vs Reward not worth illness &amp; loss of life maybe
Saw an ad on facebook the other day, was mostly Trump Complaining about the rioting. Seriously they are rioting because of your bad leadership. You have no right to complain.
Meanwhile the Republican trump cult feels its safer now not to have a split outdoor RNC venue   But, yes lets have 1000's of children gather indoors and think there will not be additional deaths. 🙄 Do as I say, not as I do
...said the world expert on making a fool out of oneself  . Trump Says Tear-Gassed Portland Mayor ‘Made A Fool Of Himself’
This picture tells you all you need to know about Donald Trump.
Amongst many other things Trump's bungled
What about how great of a life the American people had before Trump became President and what a nightmare it's been since he has been President
Sounds like a Trump truth teller another words making it up as he goes along
I really wanna know what kinda substance trump supporters are taking bc this shit MUST make you see an alternate reality 👁👄👁
If you believe that Trump has some swamp land he wants to sell you
I’m a donor from MN. Because #MoscowMitch is as much a threat to democracy as trump
Yet, you're humbler than Trump at his having remembered five very tough words, without warning, they tried to trick him but he didn't fall for it. I prefer your stellar performance!
For a second there I thought you were referring to Trump!
Then Trump never began the debate since he opened with slander from his first words. Not surprising given the lack of coherence to his thought process and having the attention span of a gnat.
I hope Kentucky voters, all republican voters, are taking note that it is their party ending their unemployment. The House passed the Heroes Act long ago, a great bill, THAT is what they should be doing. Trump's a fool. This delay will tank the economy.
What would be really fun would be if all the delegates, unmasked please, got together and didn't nominate him. Fridays are for pipe dreams.
An extreme example of an extreme man. He denies, as does Trump, that his own grandmother is a COVID death because of the timeline. When all know that the effects linger for months and are deadly in the elderly. May he rot for his complicity.
I REQUEST THAT YOU SECOND THE MOTION TO HAVE DEMOCRATS REMOVED FROM CONGRESS,    REP. LOUIE GOHMERT, MAKE THIS BALL ROLL EVEN AFTER TRUMP WINS, WE THE PEOPLE HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS CRAP.
Trump loves Russian Spies.
celebrate the traitors trump. #TRE45SON
Well, Romney thought Romney would win in 2012, so he's like 0-1 so far #2020election  Here’s Why Mitt Romney Thinks Donald Trump Will Win Reelection
A flood of dems will vote for trump secretly come election day. Most people are not ok with looting, burning, assaulting, and killing that the left has to offer. Go ahead and talk yourself into the myth that biden will win. Millions of dems will vote for trump. Secretly.
More and more dems are going to secretly vote for trump when they are in the voting booth. Most people are afraid of the looting, burning and killing that BLM and antifa is famous for.
Looks like Trump won’t be watching baseball....
I have seen this test administered and I’m sorry trump makes it seem like it’s a bad test.  I’m glad he knows where he lives.  What about those people who have forgotten.  Trump has no empathy for those with dementia or Alzheimer’s it’s sickening
Well congratulations your qualified to become President and medical degrees to cure the pandemic virus from Trump college as long as you keep the up the monthly payments
#ImVoting4BidenBecause Our Nation Security has been Threatened. Trump is a lapdog for Putin and Secret phone calls with Putin is a  National Security Threat. The US gets the phone call readouts from the KREMLIN.  WTF.
There are several member of the city council who actively support Antifa which is a terrorist group. So no, corruption is still well there .... don’t bring it back to Trump - he doesn’t have anything to do with the corrupt MN government.
When they tell me they will still vote for Trump, person, woman, man, camera, TV.
Putin like Oral favors from Trump. Hence trumps dirty knees.
How many kids did Trump meet when he was with Jeffrey Epstein?
Trump killed the Chinese AG market.  How is this good for our Farmers?
Trump and his BFF, Jeffery Epstein
We need to protect our elections from outside influences.  Trump asked Russia, China and Ukraine for help in the 2020 election.  Traitor.
This shit HOT and I love Donald Trump and his savageness fuck yall... but I still love and respect everyones opinionYes, really it’s a matter of who wins Wis, Fla, Penn, Mich and maybe a couple others. It was close last time with misogyny as a factor. Now that it’s a boring old white guy and Trump has had three years to show his total incompetence I have to think that’s enough to swing.
It was Obama's economy... but you break it, you buy it...  Trump now owns it.
Trump killed Herman Cain.
Yup. It won't keep Trump in office. It will motivate some of America's worst people.
Look I don't know if you know this but Donald Trump is a 33ﾟ Freemason and a Jesuit who has been knighted he has had ties with Israel for years he loves Israel more than America that's apparent he is on to of israel's coins wake up. Trump is one of them NOW research what I wrote
I have engaged in conversation with some of the 'allLivesMatter' crowd and have been told that Trump makes them feel special... That people are talking about everyone else but them... My response is... You do know you're white right?  Your level of privilege is extremely high!!!
They're literally the same thing. Also, Trump has no power to delay the election, it's hard-wired into the Constitution and run by the states. And if you think Trump doesn't know he's losing...he clearly knows he's losing.
Seems like the pedocrats are getting ready to start a war or remove trump before they lose their sham of an election this year. If they do lose with this much cheating I’ll be very impressed. Many already know they want war,it’s just they want their voters to do it. #DNCisCorrupt
So now the Acorn pimp-video kid is “making” videos of Trump saying terrible things in hopes that liberals will retweet, just so he can reveal that they are spreading fake news?  Wow...genius...🙄
The left was the party of tolerance at one point, now trump is a racist because he disagrees with their opinions. Party of hatred is the #dnc now. Lots of Latino and black white supremacists voting for #trump2020
They can never destroy trump, they have been hating on him before he even won and it only got worse in 2017. Anderson Cooper and Don’t Lemon have become the biggest hypocrites on the MSM
The Trump grift goes on....
Yesss.. President Trump had that show called the apprentice and in Freemasonry when you enter its the  apprentice stage and they wear a mask
Whether you like Trump or not, his policies at bringing pharmaceutical production back to the United States are something that should have strong bipartisan support.
They don't want to defund the police they want to abolish them so they can create an inquisition of their new communist state.
This must be the Trump fuck version. Mine involves a lot of Tequila, a little bit of lime
Trump needs to activate the military and use lethal force against Antifa. They are trying to destroy our country to install communism and they are using BLM to do it.
💯%!!! LOVE TRUMP! #VoteRedToSaveAmerica
Suburban racists don't like to believe that they're racists. They are, but they like to tell themselves they really aren't. Some will go with Trump, but a whole bunch will recoil.
The problem for Trump is that it's getting late early.
In all honesty, Trump's transparent racism will backfire in the suburbs. I'm not saying there isn't racism in the burbs, there absolutely is, but it isn't the kind of proud, KKK racism of our president. That's still considered gauche.
If schools can fire teachers for saying “Trump is president”, then yes.
To be fair, this isn't as ridiculous as it sounds. TikTok is basically a conduit straight to the CCP. Of course, I assume Trump is doing this to get kickbacks from the Chinese government.
Is almost 5 trillion and only going up! He blames everyone but his horrible reaction to Covid! The States doing the worst our all run by Republican governors! That have been loyal to Trump! That’s what I see! I go by my eyes and ears! Not what comes out of Trumps mouth!
I can’t stand the way Trump talks everyone’s terrible! The people curing trouble are not anybody but white supremacy and neo-nazis that Trump has put out there to make protesters look bad! He is playing games with our lives and our livelihood for 3 1/2 yrs now! Our country’s debt
#Polling Here is a note from a polling group: "The Trafalgar group weights its polls to account for “social desirability bias,” or the so-called shy Trump voters who are embarrassed to tell pollsters that they support the president."  - So that can be accounted for in a poll????
It's because Trump is racist.
Yea trump killed 150k people (that died of COVID and nothing else I’m sure),  New York didn’t kill half of them in LTC facilities either that was trump probably too. He didn’t ban infected China either, Biden did that. #Trump2020 #Hydroxychloroquine
White supremacists try to incite violence, which explains why Trump sends Fed forces to Portland.
#Covid19 Trump says, "Nobody likes me." -- the first utterance in months that is the truth.
Trump removal
Trump deploy the military to end Antifa they want to install communism.
HOW do you clean up a party led by Donald J Trump? It’s impossible. If they lose the White House, Senate and House they might change for the better.
Me: I've been so busy today, I wonder what's going on in the world :::opens Twitter::: Trump: 👇🏾
Bingo! My thoughts exactly. This is the best campaign gift Trump can get. Ammo everywhere on every issue, all on tape.
You're right, if there's one thing Trump respects it's the independence of agencies.
Wouldn't it be fun to name your cabinet nominees before the election? And wouldn't it be more fun to announce a few of those names each day of the Republican National Convention, thus stealing some of Trump's thunder?  We *are* in unusual times.
No "if" about it, President Trump WILL WIN! You on the other hand will never keep your word on anything.
M4A fans need to explain why having the American health care system under the complete control of Donald Trump would be a good thing.
That is not a normal gait. I don't think Trump necessarily has dementia (he's always been a fool) but there's clearly *something* going on medically.
LOL - so you are dismissing the very recent poll that said Trump was 13 down in MN? Keep trying.
#CD1 Quote from Hagedorn: “This is the Armageddon of all elections. Unfortunately, if we lose, I think we lose the country as the Founding Fathers envisioned it. We can’t lose. We must win.” -- So the Founding Fathers would approve of your mentor, Donald Trump? Really?
And I'm trying to convince Jared to make it unanimous. (Trump himself will have eaten his ballot by mistake.)
Exactly, no response to CNN being fake news, just a meme directed at the left with a few words changed to make it to the right kinda, and trump added in.  How original!
CNN: “Trump has states #Hydroxychloroquine is the cure for COVID the entire time as well as many doctors who have been silenced or killed. Time to say it isn’t true and tell you all to put masks on quickly now!” FTFY
America doesn’t need masks, we have a cure for COVID and have had it for over ten years #hydrochloroquineWorks 150,000 deaths prevented by Trump by suggesting this cure and closing off China. Let’s blame 2020 on trump tho not the rioters... 😂
One of the reasons "But what if Trump comes out with a vaccine on the November 1st?" falls flat is that nobody will believe him.
Durrr this is twumps amewica it’s all his fault Wahhhh.  I don’t see conservatives or trump himself rioting, just Ill informed children.
#Unity Trump says he won't be paying is respects to John Lewis. Biden did. That tells you all you need to know about who will unite this country.
Only positive things said about Trump should be able to trend.
Im sorry. I lost my father and grandmother both to cancer just before China sent this to us. I couldn’t imagine the stress of caring for someone that sick while this is going on. I am a trump supporter as well but wearing a mask seems like an easy step to move this forward.
Don’t you think they will continue after trump wins again ?
Don’t forget all the people he killed in nursing home and denying #Hydroxychloroquineworks the cure for COVID the ENTIRE time. Way to go MSM, allowed tons of people to die in another attempt to blame trump.
Been debunked by progressives and they hate trump more than you do.
#Covid19 Trump may have passed the cognitive test but he still remains hopelessly stupid.
Ivanka Trump Set To Visit Minnesota Monday
“We are witnessing a crisis of democracy that is perfectly acceptable to a significant portion of the population — as long as it hurts their enemies.” Trump’s Portland deployment reveals a crisis of the Republican Party - Vox
“We are witnessing a crisis of democracy that is perfectly acceptable to a significant portion of the population — as long as it hurts their enemies.”
“...advisers began presenting Trump with maps and data showing spikes in coronavirus cases among ‘our people’ in Republican states, a senior administration official said. This new approach seemed to resonate, as he hewed closely to pre-scripted remarks in...briefings last week”.
Joe! Kesha Bottoms! Is a strong women! I love her and a lot of people I been talking to love her! She’s my choice for VP just saying! I know it’s your choice! Which I’ll respect totally! I love the way she speaks! She’ll go up against Trump! She does now! Soon to know! Who?
If they wore BLM masks and said the opposite about trump it would be okay though right 😆
Because that worked out soooo well the other four times right? Can’t you idiots just get over the facts that we want trump and wait your turn like everyone else damn
can’t wait for Trump to be indicted for extortion of Ukraine. Do the secret service have to stand in Trumps cell with him, or do they stand outside? Rangers Lead The Way!
Be careful they left have already started murdering people who support Trump.
Really? Have you drunk some different Kool Aid? Your party has been pushing mail in voting within the party for years. Just because Trump says its a fraud means nothing. He lies every single day.
Fellow Americans, it is literally happening right now. #IMPOTUS Trump has actually turned our country into a George Orwell novel. 😬 If we somehow get to November still alive, #VoteForOurLives #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Plus if you keep your memories you could warn us about Trump.
Black Trump Supporter Shot And Killed In Milwaukee  RIP Bernie Trammell, a needless loss of another innocent life
Walz' emergency powers give him the authority to infringe on free speech. They allow him to break up assemblies of people.  We are allowing him dictatorial powers.  And the Dems complain about Trump.  ??
When Trump wanted to lead a national response, the Governors (including the Great and Powerful Walz) protested that he has no right to interfere with the States.
My husband's a custom cabinet builder/woodworker. He spends everyday talking real loud and clear to all the tradesmen he works with(whether they want to listen or not) about Trump's mishandling of literally everything and why the country needs Biden. He knows we need their votes.
Trump 2020
Of course the guy is wearing a Trump shirt lol. I hope someone walked up to them a yelled in there face. 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Biden lost my vote when he wrote the 1994 Crime bill, said “Poor kids are just as smart as white kids”, “You ain’t black if you vote Trump”, doesn’t want to end qualified immunity, wants to ban assault rifles, pedophile, racist. Damn do I need more?
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Who could have foreseen that Trump would screw all of his allies over?
Just another Case of Trumpism! She said it herself! I’m so tired of the cult mentality that’s come out of Trump supporters! Fox News is also part of the problem! There bringing this kind of crazy’s out of the woodwork like cockroaches!
What is amazing about this photo is that Brett Favre is actually OLDER than Donald Trump and he looks like he is 30 years younger. SAD.
I have a Devon Nunes joke, but DONALD TRUMP NUDE PICS!
We have Trump/Republican death panels in Texas now! Unbelievable!!!!
American Catastrophe Through German Eyes
“Trump is insane, he is going to get everyone sick having the convention”. “Trump is insane, he is costing us money not having the convention”. We get it, orange man bad. Been tuning you out since early 2017. No matter what he does it’s bad we get it k.
Protesting is about as American as you can get. We literally became our own country by fighting against an authoritarian ruler, like we are now. And that’s for both parties, not just Trump.
Are you saying that the past four years there have been no children in cages? If there have been, is it enough for Trump to pass the blame to someone else, rather than act on it? It is my recollection that he said separating the children from their parents would be a deterrent.
...it could have been controlled sooner.  Nobody is saying Trump created a virus and unleashed it, but every other country has been able to control it, or at least slow it down severely.  140k people DEAD unconscionable.
TRUMP 2020
Best part of this is clearly the note that "Also, Trump had been booed in public on multiple occasions before 2015."
I see you are talking about Trump again...totally agree.
Glad to see there are smart people in the world the realize Trump had nothing to do with the economy! Obama worked his ass off to undo the mess the Republicans put us in under the bush administration! And know Trump has distort us will be in the most debt ever in history 5 trill.
Blasting Trump is understandable and warranted.  Praising Biden is not.  He hasn’t even run a campaign, he’s totally invisible and when he actually does speak he sounds, frankly, senile.
The #ChinaVirus case out of Wuhan first of all,not trump.Second how does testing “Save Lives”? If testing were available earlier then more cases would have been announced earlier and much quicker.The testing is unreliable at best anyway. Try again Nancy,can’t blame trump for this
Trumps America is the right America where law and order are still important. The Democrats have no power left than to help cause chaos in inner cities, Funded anarchy. Your risking a civil war with an elected Biden. Trump is the anti establishment and the dems dont like it boohoo
It’s wild that Republicans whipped themselves into hysteria saying President Obama was going to create death panels and use federal police to violate Constitutional rights, but when it’s *actually happening* under Trump, they’ve got nothing.
Does that mean I am black if I vote for Trump?
Trump is so anxious to magnify his law and order schtick, that in a campaign ad he used six year old video from Ukraine as evidence of American unrest. You’re a loser, Cadet Bonespurs!
Trump failed miserably at coronavirus; with election looming, he has now decided to put on a big show that he’s the “law and order” president:by sending out his jackbooted secret police, trying to stir up the protesters (who have a Constitutional right to peacefully protest).
I can’t believe all these Trump ads that are like, “this is what Biden’s America would look like”, while showing very real footage from Trump’s America. What is the game there? Does Trump think the rest of us have dementia too? People buy this shit??
Y’all are literally taking headlines out of the Trump administration and substituting Biden for Trump.  You’re so bad at this.
Trump never said that idiot! Read the transcript of the call!
Donald Trumps son didn’t take millions of dollars from crooked Iranian co. Joe Bidens son did! No did Trump pay  tax $ to Iran to drop investigations into his son. Trump son also did not take 1 1/2 billion in investment money from a bank owned by the Chinese communist party. Fact
Well, he is a land developer. All he has to do is wait for the ice to melt, and BOOM! start digging for Trump Tower Greenland.
Yes it is scary!  Too bad it’s under Trump’s watch!!
U Q people are actually hilarious...Trump isnt going to save you ...  The right and left paradigm is a joke I am for neither side they are both not for the American people.. I really don't know why people get so hostile because I say my opinion it's pretty ridiculous
you’re going to be held accountable for these actions after we vote Trump out. You will be in the history books for this. Resign and save your reputation! Rangers Lead The Way!!!!
Trump may not be the most racist American president, but he is the most racist American president relative to the era in which he served.
Big...if true.  And smart of China to try to destabilize us and push Trump out.  Yuge backlash expected.
The wall of moms shouldnt have been in the fucking street when they knew what was coming. Trump has stated this will not stand. Democrats in these cities have failed their citizens. They have burned, pilliaged, and defaced these cities for weeks. They are anarchists not angels!
It's about time! These so called protesters are nothing but anti american thugs who have caused fires, vandalism, and attempted anarchy. They have thwarted the message of police reform after George Floyd and are spitting on his memory. Trump is doing the job Democrats wont.
Any job Trump hands out at this point is “seasonal”.
...Trump is now deploying secret police to cities—whose residents largely oppose him—to kidnap people people who’ve taken to the streets to demonstrate against racism.
#MaskUpMN #mnleg Remember the Trump cry "Liberate Minnesota"? And the MN GOP marched in lock step with that - deriding Gov. Walz for not opening fast enough. We could have been FL, AZ, or TX if he had listened to the GOP riffraff. But he didn't and we are the better for it.
#Covid19 Remember the Trump cry "Liberate Minnesota"? And the MN GOP marched in lock step with that - deriding Gov. Walz for not opening fast enough. We could have been FL, AZ, or TX if he had listened to the GOP riffraff. But he didn't and we are the better for it.
Question: who is dying because of the protesters?    Counter point:  130k dead folks; uncontrolled Covid; Trump golfing.
#Covid19 I don't understand why Walz's mandate is really such a big deal. Given the inaction of Trump admin and no Fed guidelines, it almost seems to be a given that we need masks to keep the virus, at least at bay.
They were actually right in their reporting. Roger Stone lied for Trump and obstructed for Trump. They were as guilty as you are gullible. Be better.
I mean, they impeached Trump.
Imagine if Trump shut down election till Rona is over &amp; all the riots stopped? I bet you it would be over pretty fast 💁🏼‍♀️
I'm sorry but the White House Press Corps is a HUGE FUCKING part of the problem. 1) Not one question about the Russian bounties 2) Not one question about the paramilitary forces in Portland 3) Nobody fucking followed up on Trump wishing a pedophile WELL????  Do your fucking job.
#TrumpPresser Rick Wilson: Trump’s COVID-19 briefing was a ‘success’ only because he ‘didn’t poop his diaper’
i hate donald trump
Incorrect Denise Wu. Lowest unemployment for blacks and Hispanics and the best economy EVER until China and DEM governors shut down America over the flu. Blame trump all you want though, China made and released the virus, but somehow trump should have stopped that right...
To close the country with a survival rate of over 99% does not constitute a pandemic this is utterly ridiculous and I thought trump had a mind of his own
So you're voting for Trump?
If I see one more person who complains that Trump is a racist which makes his followers racist, who then says they are going to vote for JOE BIDEN, I think I will need to delete my account. I can't anymoreI watched the Ingraham Angle on faux news tonight. She said drumpf is leading in most of the polls on important issues. She also said that when people are asked their opinions of trump they're afraid to say they support Trump. This is why he's behind. Pure bull crap
BIRX, NOW NO LONGER trumps EXPERT ON COVID19 IS CHANGING HER VIEWS. GOT TO COVER HER ASS KNOWING trump IS GOING DOWN
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO TAKE THE CHANCE TO  DIE IF trump ALLOWS MAIL IN VOTING
DON'T STOP AT POMPEO. HELL RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU CAN'T STAND trump? THE WHOLE trump ADMINISTRATION? , THE WHOLE GOP? THE DIRECTION THIS GREAT COUNTRY OF OURS IS  UNFORTUNATELY HEADING?
Sure. Let's see what 4 more years of Trump looks like. Can't wait to see the country burn down honestly.
IT'S QUITE OBVIOUS WHY trump HASN'T SAID A FRICKIN WORD ABOUT HIS GOOD BUDDY VLAD  PAYING TO HAVE AMERICANS KILLED. trump MAY UNFORTUNATELY BE POTUS, BUT HE IS ALSO UNFORTUNATELY PUTIN'S "BOY"
tRump is wrong for humans
The unwillingness of Trump to take accountability doesn’t surprise me, although I admit I yearn for a national leader that does.  But while I saw race &amp; income, age &amp; health status as targets, the reckless abandonment of essential workers appalls &amp; shocks me. 30/
Trump abandoned command &amp; climbed off the boat with the iceberg ahead. Governors with states in trouble reluctantly dealt with reality. And racism underlies our response at every turn. 26/
I wasn’t the only one.  saw what was happening in nursing homes too. And we talked about it here. 11/
In April before there was much data I worried about the impact on vulnerable communities &amp; that Trump was picking the economy over the health of marginalized communities.  I am sad to feel right. And it’s actually worse than I thought it would be.10/
It will be the last time I make the mistake thinking Trump might care enough about people dying to take any responsibility.  The stock market &amp; his polls dictate his interest level. 8/
Trump avoided a national strategy for a state led strategy to own the libs.
A Trump supporter talking about politicians "not handling criticism"
Waiting for the Counterrevolution
YEAH, ITS ABOUT TIME THE DAMN PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR trump IN 2016 START SEEING REALITY AND WHAT A F#CKED UP JOB trump HAS DONE IN THE PAST 3 1/2 YRS.
I just heard this.. tRump wants to delay elections, But if he does speaker Pelosi becomes president on Jan 1 b/c  tRumps term ends on dec 31!!!! That's why the GOP vehemently oppose any postponement of the elections.
THAT VAIN ARROGANT CONCEITED EGOTISTICAL trump IS,SO IN LOVE WITH THE POWER N ATTENTION HE NOW HAS THERE IS NO WAY IN HELL WIN LOSE OR DRAW HE VOLUNTARILY LEAVES OFFICE. WHY DO YOU THINK HE BUT UP A WALL? FORMED HIS OWN PRIVATE GESTAPO/SS ARMY? FOR PROTECTION.
Law &amp; Order: Special tRUMP Unit
WELL THAT LEAVES trump.OUT OF THE DISCUSSION
I’m sure tRump is working furiously to get him released
If u really believed anything like this why would u wait 4 months to implement this law?  Why don’t u stick to what you know which is declining help from trump then asking him for money to help rebuild the city u let burn down
AND THEY HAVE DeSANTIS TO THANK  FOR THISE DEATHS BECAUSE OF  HIS GROSS INEPT INCOMPETENT MISHANDLING OF THE COVID19 CRISIS JUST LIKE AMERICA HAS trump TO THANK FOR 1500000+DEATHS BECSYSE IF trumps PATHETIC N PITIFUL GROSS INEPT INCOMPETENT MISHANDLING OF THE COVID19 CRISIS
TECHNICALLY BECAUSE OF HIS GROSS INEPT INCOMPETENT MISHANDLING OF THE COVID19 CRISIS trump IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL 150000+ DEATHS
Sounds like exactly what Trump did with Covid 🤔
SHIT, ALL Y'ALL GONNA GET IS A "trump" after "trump" FROM  THAT WHY I BLOCKED IT.  WOULD NEVER ANSWER THE QUESTION I ASKED , EITHER IGNORING IT OR TALK ABOUT SOMETHING TOTALLY IRRELEVANT TO THE QUESTION I ASKED.
IF IT DOESN'T HAVE PICTURES TO HELP HIM UNDERSTAND, trump WON'T ATTEMPT TO READ SHIT TOO MUCH EFFORT.. HE IS THE LAZIEST GD MFin POOR EXCUSE FOR A HUMAN BEING I HAVE EVER SEEN. ANYTHING NEEDING ANY KIND OF A EFFORT trump PASSES TO  SOMEONE ELSE TO DO.
Where in the Constitution does it say the President needs to follow the law? That sounds like a Trump tweet.
ITS VERY DANGEROUS FOR A COUNTRY TO HAVE A EXTREMLY VAIN ARROGANT CONCEITED EGOTISTICAL POTUS WHO LOVES THE POWER N ATTENTION HE NOW HAS TO KNOW HE'S ABOUT TO LOSE IT. WIN LOSE OR DRAW trump IS NOT VOLUNTARILY GOING TOO  LEAVE.THE WALL N HIS OWN PRIVATE GESTAPO/SS ARMY PROVE THAT
Did anyone cover trump’s event? MSNBC didn’t even mention it. At one point I checked FOX at one point and they were on Obama.
Don’t think anyone wanted Trump at the funeral.
He may be trying to gain their favor, but the generals are mostly in opposition to Trump. Nobody wants to work under a dictator. So, while they may act all peaches and cream with him, remember that he's still their boss; for now. You've never sucked up to a boss you hate?
Trump knows he’s lost the support of the military
QUESTION TO ANY BRAIN DEAD IGNORANT GULLIBLE LAPDOG LACKEY GOP SUPPORTER OF trumps GROSS INEPT INCOMPETENT MISHANDLING OF THE COVID19 CRISIS. SAY YOU CATCH THE VIRUS, WHO WOULD YOU GO TOO, DR FAUCI A EXPERT? OR trump N HIS LATEST EXPERT WHO WILL BEAM YOU UP TO THE ALIENS?
If Trump did John Lewis's eulogy it would sound like this: why don't people love me as much as they love John Lewis?
trump for 2 MONTHS SAID:::  1-IT WAS A HOAX 2-NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT 3-ALL UNDER CONTROL 4-OVER BY SUMNER(WHICH 1, SUMNER OF 2023) 5-GROSS INEPT INCOMPETENT MISHANDLING OF THE COVID19 CRISIS  6-HASN'T DONE A DAMN THING ABOUT THE COVID19 CRISIS  7-REFUSES TO ACCEPT  RESPONSIBILITY
Trump is a very petty small man.
ALL YOU WILL GET BACK IS A "trump" WHICH IS PURE BULLSHIT IGNORING WHAT YOU ASKED OR TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING COMPLETLY IRRELEVANT TO THE QUESTION YOU ASKED.
According to  , it is safe for kids to go to school, but it is NOT safe for adults to vote at polling stations that are in schools and election should delayed. Wow! Trump is scared. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020
I'm sure Wisconsin's grade Senator Johnson will stand up to Trump on this issue
Don’t listen to what Trump says. He’s full of shit. He always will be. He can’t delay an election. Only congress can. Please register to vote at  and request a mail in ballot. Let’s put an end to this national nightmare and vote Trump and his goons out.
REASONS TO DELAY IF NOT CANCEL THE ELECTIONS? FAILED ECONOMY PATHETIC N PITIFUL GROSS INEPT INCOMPETENT MISHANDLING OF THE COVID19 CRISIS  150000 PLUS DEATHS BUT THE BIGGEST REASON IS trump IS SO DAMN VAIN ARROGANT EGOTISTICAL CONCEITED AND LOVES THE POWER N ATTENTION HE NOW HAS
trumps DECISION TO WITHDRAWL TROOPS FROM GERMANY  RIGHT AFTER HIS PRIVATE PHONE CALL WITH PUTIN. trumps ELECTION IN 2016 IS KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN ASSISTED UP PUTIN/RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE trump CONTINUES TO IGNORE PUTIN PAYING TO HAVE AMERICANS KILLED.  trump OUR POTUS IS PUTIN'S "BOY"
DAMN STRAIGHT, THAT VAIN ARROGANT CONCEITED EGOTISTICAL trump IS SO IN LOVE WITH ALL THE POWER N ATTENTION HE NOW HAS, WIN LOSE OR DRAW NO WAY IN HELL IS HE GIVING IT UP. WHY THE WALL AROUND THE LIE HOUSE, WHY HIS OWN PRIVATE GESTAPO/SS TROOPS? TO PROTECT N DEFEND HIM THATS WHY
Trump also can’t have it both ways. If he sends troops out but sits in DC &amp; minimizes things, people will listen to him not his staff.  Frankly we’ve been at this too long to have confidence he will sustain any effort here.
With the largest number of deaths in 2 months yesterday, Trump has his health care team on the road in battle ground states to wave the flag that Trump is on top of the crisis.
AFTER 7 MONTHS,150000+ DEATHS I REALLY DON'T THINK YOU NEED CAINS DEATH TO PROVE COVID19 IS REAL.   U NEED THE STUPID-A BRAIN DEAD NUMBNUTS IGNORANT GULLIBLE LAPDOG LACKEY GOP SUPPORTERS OF trump AND HIS GROSS INEPT INCOMPETENT MISHANDLING OF THE COVID19 CRISIS TO ADMIT THE TRUTH
Can't wait to see all of the Trump 2021 bumper stickers.
REMIND THAT TO THE REPUBLICAN/trump PARTY WHO ONLY OBEYS THE COMMANDS OF THE HIGH N MIGHTY ORANGE 1, F#CK THE PEOPLE THEY WERE ELECTED TO SERVE.
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF trump KILLING PEOPLE JUST TO MAKE HIS IMAGE LOOK BETTER.
ITS CALLED PULLING A,"trump" WHEN YOU ASK A QUESTION THEY DON'T WANT TO ANSWER.  THEY WILL EITHER IGNIRE IT, OR TAKJ ABOUT SONETHIBG COMPLETLE IRRELEVANT TO THE QUESTION YOU ASKED. I GET "trumps" DUMPED ON ME DAILY WHEN ASKING FOR A ANSWER TO MY QUESTION REGARDING trumps F#CK UPS

Holy shit. This dude was at a Trump rally a few days before catching it
Reminder: you didn’t stand up to trump when I mattered most and you’re partially responsible for everything that’s happened since. You had your chance to act and you failed
Serious question: how would one determine that Trump lost because of VBM?
Based on my timeline Trump is trying to change the election date and there was an Earthquake in SoCal
Trump shrank GDP by 32% and didn’t use the sacrifice to form a coherent or useful national response; perhaps Congress should move the election up?
I’ve never felt optimistic about the November election until today. However a call to delay is a sure sign the end of Trump is coming.
How long before Trump nominates the demon sex doctor to run the VA?
Completely unaware.  Living in her own little world...Trump's little sycophant.  #FirstLadyComesInLast
The purpose of the Census is to count people not voters. I suspect trump only considers republicans to be people. What a hateful creature he is.
Oh, no. I guess I’ll have to change to gin. Anyway gin and tonic is as effective as trump’s miraculous drug.
The contrasting world views of Donald Trump and Mike Pompeo via
Naughty naughty , potty mouth 😂😂😂 dumb dumb trump
Also shows why Trump is sending federal officers to Michigan. He wants to drive fear and division. But we’re gonna divide Trump from the White House instead, preferably by force when the Secret Service throws his ass out.
Trump is a fool or a pawn. Either way...not good.🤨
I don't believe him for a moment.  He's just another sycophant of Trump...and Trump is a master liar so this poor soul would do anything to please.  I also don't believe Trump took the drug at all.  #TrumpLiesAmericansDie
Awww it’s so cute how they complain about being disliked...just like they’re Fuhrer Trump.
Nobody could do a better job of making trump look incompetent than trump.

AND THAT GD MFin trump WAS NO WHERE TO BE SEEN AT EITHER LEWIS'S MEMORIAL SERVICE AND OR FUNERAL. REAL FRICKIN CLASSLESS ACT. AND THIS BASTARD IS POTUS? WHAT THE HELL S THE MATTER WITH YOU ANERICA?
Trump is saying the racist part loud. But he is appealing to the base motives that quietly continue to prevent the solutions we need to seriously confront our housing crisis.   Housing justice is racial justice.
I DEAL WITH TRUTH JUSTICE THE ANERICAN WAY. IT'S OBVIOUS YOU DEAL WITH  DECEIT. LIES THE,trump WAY SO I"M NOT  WASTING ANYMORE TIME WITH YOU. HIT THE ROAD JACK AND DON'T YOU COME BACK NO MORE NO MORE HIT THE ROAD JACK AND DON'T YOU COME BACK NO MORE.
All the people in Trump’s White House should put “seater of baseball fans” on their resumes as a cover during this period.
SHE IS BEING "BEAMED UP" TO MEET WITH HER ALIEN COUNTERPARTS TO DISCUSS THE COVID19 CRISIS.AND trump WANTS TO GO ALONG FOR THE RIDE
trump HAS BEEN IN OFFICE FOR OVER 3 1/2 YRS  AND EVERY ONE OF HIS ORDERS GIVEN HAS BEEN A REALLY F#CKED UP ONE.
TELL ME, WHO SAID HE WOULD:: RELEASE HIS TAX RECORDS? REPLACE OBAMACARE? ERASE THE NAT'L DEBT? ITS ALL A HOAX? NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT? ALL UNDER CONTROL? WHAT ORANGE LYING BASTARD SAID ALL THAT? I"M WAITING AND PLEASE DON'T PULL A "trump" ON ME. ANSWER THIS QUESTION.
TREASON CAN BE EXPLAINED IN ONE WORD, trump
And his personal doctor will be the woman from Houston who impressed tRump even though he doesn’t know her.
AMERICA, IF YOU WANT TO FIGHT THE COVID19 CRISIS,  IF YOU WANT TO MAKE SOCIAL SECURITY STRONGER,  IF YOU WANT TO RETURN AMERICA TO ITS RIGHTFUL PLACE IN THE WORLD.  IF YOU REALLY WANT TO MAGA  REMOVE trump NOW. DOB'T WAIT TILL JANUARY 2021,  REMOVE THE BASTARD NOW
trump IS JUST OBEYING WHAT PUTIN COMMANDED HIM TO DO  IN THAT PERSONNEL SECRET PHONE CALL THEY HAD.
AMERICA BETTER ENJOY YOUR CHILDREN NOW BECAUSE IF trump AND HIS BOYS N GIRLS GET THEIR WAY ALL OUR CHILDREN WILL BECOME GUINEA PIGS THIS COMING SCHOOL YEAR TO BOLSTER HIS IMAGE. WELL NOT ALL, trumps OWN CHILD WILL BE SAFE N SOUND IN THE LIE HOUSE GETTING TESTED HOURLY.

I can’t even express my disdain of the current political culture of the US. Half of the right has abandoned their conservative principles to suck up to/defend Trump (who is a populist, not a conservative). Meanwhile the left is going further and further left, &amp; has a mindset 1/

BREAKING: New study shows widespread ignored nursing home abuse. 295,000/week (20% of all residents) improperly received antipsychotic drugs.  Trump rolled back Obama era protections &amp; reduced fines by 22%. 10% of the worst abuses received no fine.

WHAT THE HELL DID YOU EXPECT FROM A MEMBER OF THE trump ADMINISTRATION? TRUTH N HONESTY?
Trump is living in a world where he believes he is a god and everyone should follow him.  He prays in the weak minded similar to the way a cult leader go about growing his congregation. Unfortunately everyone in the cult dies in the end.
Weird: "A rise in coronavirus-related deaths in a given community tends to reduce support for Republicans."
A lot of high up Dems have big money and ties to big pharma companies, so they’re invested for the vaccine to come out and generate millions/billions of $. The solution of HCQ would halt this. Also Trump said it would work, so naturally they oppose it
I’m not a fan of Trump Jr. either, but this censorship is wrong.
I’d question that poll honestly...
My sister lost her teaching job when they cut the special education programs.  I blame a lot of our collective ignorance on Regan. His mental health reforms made crime and homelessness worse. He tried to destroy labor unions. He ignored the AIDS crisis. Kind of like Trump &amp; covid
Mini-Trump talks about “my body my choice” and then immediately calls for an end to abortion. Being a hypocrite used to immediately be understood as being wrong. Now GOP morons like this wear hypocrisy as a badge of honor.
Nixon era was rough. Regan era we lost jobs &amp; almost lost our home. Trump era is like hell on earth.
Trump family products are made in China!
Following up on my previous tweet, everyone read the responses in this thread. HCQ seems like it was immediately cancelled by Dems merely bc Trump suggested it and well, of course, “Orange man bad”. Stop being sheep
As long as Joe doesn’t pick someone with the last name Trump, I’m in. Not questioning it, just getting my butt to the voting booth on Election Day.

No, we don’t want you to forget when Trump WAS impeached but not removed by the GOP-led Congress. Now he’s committed a bunch more impeachable offenses &amp; more than 150,000 Americans are dead.  Also, not forgotten is that student wrestlers were sexually abused and you did nothing.

Daily reminder: Yes, you are in charge of your own health. But that opinion does not trump medical research. unless you have a vast understanding of interpreting statistics &amp; medical jargon &amp; how the body works. So it’s easier if you just listen to the professionals around you.

Psalm 21:1-2 NLT PROOF OF FLAT EARTH. TRUMP WINS! GOD SAYS ITS GOOD. SATAN SAYS ITS BAD How the king rejoices in your strength, O Lord!  He shouts with joy because you give him victory. For you have given him his heart’s desire;  you have withheld nothing he requested. Interlude
Psalm 21:7-8 NLT PROOF OF FLAT EARTH.PRESIDENT TRUMP WIN! GOD SAYS MOON IS A LIGHT SATAN LIES. For the king trusts in the Lord. The unfailing love of the Most High will keep him from stumbling. You will capture all your enemies. Your strong right hand will seize all who hate you.
There is no official confirmation of this damage happened in Texas due to the hurricane. Suspect this is an old video resurfacing from an incident in California .
.Minnesotan also. Remember election night in 2016, when it looked like #Trump might carry the state? I thought I was in the Twilight Zone.trump is willing to put innocent children in jeopardy for an election. He's the devil.

SD congressional delegation says Election Day will remain Nov. 3, despite Trump tweet
Agreed!! Trump doesn’t. He told people to inject bleach and drink sunlight. He’s literally Michael Scott
None are wearing masks and they're barely standing 1ft from each other.   They can't criticize Trump for not doing it, when they aren't either.  Also, George W. Bush was an absolute failure as POTUS.
If Trump is re-elected it will be the best thing to happen to them
It’s terrible 4 Americans died in Benghazi . It is extremely hard to accept any of our Patriots die. I’m not screaming. At the beginning of the C19 outbreak 100 top medical experts predicted, if we do everything correctly, 120,000 could die. Todays Trump # 240k dead by November.
New IV Words – With everything going on, it’s easy to lose track of the colossal damage Trump is doing to environmental protections and the looming devastation of climate change. But we can’t. Read the post –
I'm taking bets on whether trump asks putin for asylum, or does he just barricade himself in the white house
ND has no problem with mail ins - Trump does, which means Chris does
For someone who is SO smart you get trolled a lot by Trump.  Your type take the bait every time. Follow the dot on the wall
Trump gone in November.
Talking rag time is what the old folks say about Trumps halting speech delivery. Repeating lies and half truths. Contrast that to Mr. Obama’s oratory today. There goes Trump giving medical advice that make Fauci’s butt pucker. He looks wasted, bleary eyed. The makeup is  better👏🏿
Trump never jokes. Ever.

The former GOP Candidate was diagnosed in early July, shortly after attending a campaign rally for President Trump.
The smell of fear coming from the Trump conservatives is sweet.
The Trump tweet about this is going to be insane AF
You're doing an incredible job. Keep holding Trump's feet to the fire.
I need to get off twitter for a while. I just finished watching the celebration of John Lewis's life and achievements. I don't want to pollute my soul with the idiotic, hateful, desperate ravings of donald trump or any of his followers.

I really wish there were more episodes of Fawlty Towers, I wish Trump wasn’t President more, but I still want this as one of my three wishes!
Remember how you said Trump would destroy America? Now Joe Biden’s supporters are doing it instead....just leave America now.
It's not!! You think i want to vote for biden? He's not even my 10th pick!! But he's still higher than trump! If we're forced to keep electing pedophiles, maybe we should at least have the decency to not give them two terms. Trump had his one. Let's get moving.
Trump alone is responsible for his death.

Trump raises possibility of delaying the election, but that power rests in Congress
Trump floats November election delay -  but he can’t do that
Blows my mind that ALL of the supposed "smart people" fall for Trump's game Every. Single. Time.   It should almost be a law of nature at this point
Violent communist burned down Portland and somehow Trump is guilty for trying to stop it.   So much fakenews.  Big media lies
He has a virulently fanatical following, and uses it. He also has a dangerous right wing flank of non-religious “Classical Liberals of the Enlightenment” (New Atheists). Whenever they start w the sentence “I’m no fan of Trump, but ... “, it ends w a trump-style smear of the Left
It’s coming to light that the TikTok gang who trolled Trump’s #TulsaRally by taking those seats and keeping them empty mostly likely saved lives.    has done more for  than  ever has. #tiktok #trump #tusla
I, like you, take no joy in this news. But I can’t help be see that his support of Trump actually got him killed. Not just going to a rally, but following Trump’s mindset that masks are a ploy.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
So you gonna change your handle to trump 2021 then? Should we go over all the countries where their despotic leaders delay elections? Not that trump even has the power to do it. Be honest. It's not electing a pedophile that upsets you. It's YOUR pedophile being voted out.
We could go with something subtle like fuck donald trump
Trump's tweet from this morning saying the election should be postponed. We could see this coming, or should have. He doesn't care about people's health or safety; he wants to be dictator. Patriots, we cannot allow  #FascistTrump to get away with this!
For once I agree with Trump.  The election will be filled with voter fraud.  Of course it will come from Trump's team, but still, he's right about there being voter fraud.
What do you think of this idea?
The story of the day is that the U.S. economy contracted by ONE THIRD last quarter because of Trump’s incompetence, but national political media are chasing their tails over his tweet about delaying the election. He knows how to game them, for sure.
I'm surrounded by a bunch of tRump supporters right now!
They fall into his trap Every Single Time. It's amazing. All of a sudden no one is talking about GDP any  longer, because tRuMp tWeEtEd
What’s your position on Trump’s plan to delay the election,     and  Do you stand with our democracy or with an infantile autocrat?  Please vote for Democrats on 3 November 2020—because our democracy depends on it.
Dive in head first and it's really disappointing. I don't really care if he likes trump or not but his singular focus on the Right is really boring
President Trump is suggesting delaying the 2020 election.
Dictator Trump thinks we shouldn't have an election. Surprise Surprise
Your vote communicates your values. A vote for  + his  is a vote against women, Black people, LGBTQ+ communities, Indigenous folks, immigrants + refugees, and the environment. This applies at the state level, too:  +  co-sign the Trump agenda.
You can think Trump's tweet was stupid AND not think that every low income person is a minority to gain the "muh racism" likes and r/t. But remember that all this faux outrage is mostly from people that hold their nose and quietly agree w/trump about this.
Comprehend, you could fill the Grand Canyon with what trump misses on that one word.
He’s hardly trying, name someone who wouldn’t. Mr. Magoo would make Trump look silly
Love your work President Trump
We don’t care about Canada. Keep to your own shitty politics. Looks like Trudeau isn’t any better than Trump

Someone tweeting about Trump's "low income" tweet while simultaneously living in some of the most racially and economically segregated neighborhoods in the country AND would fight tooth &amp; nail for the exact policy he is advocating is the worst kind of hypocrite.
I know way more than you will ever know about how this works.  Obama restricted business and Over regulated everything.   The reason we were thriving was President Trump removed several of the unnessary regs and lowered taxes.  That spurred our massive growth.
What happens to Trump if she is AG? That would be more fun.
You can think Trump's tweet was stupid AND not think that every low income person is a minority to gain the "muh racism" likes and r/t. But remember that all this faux outrage is mostly from people that hold their nose and quietly agree w/trump about this.

A lot of the same people that rail against the "cult of trump" unironically worship at the "cult of Reagan" and think that the latter is better for some reason. Cult of personality, while  an awesome song, is horrible for politicians both dead and alive,

The doctor featured in the video has made other troubling claims, including medicine is being made by using alien DNA and sex with “tormenting spirits” is responsible for gynecological problems.
Trump is trying to orchestrate protests in swing states, hoping they turn (or helping them become) violent, in order to be the "law and order" candidate. He knows protests make good TV for Fox News, etc. Cynical and dangerous.
When Trump tells you - and shows you - who he is, believe him.  He is a RACIST.  👇
Weak af 😂 all those comments were before it was shown China covered it up. O and trump is going to win again 😊 see ya in 2024!!

Watching  speak with detail about policies he'd like to implement. Couldn't help but think to myself that, other than "we're working on it" or "we've done the best job of _______", have I heard Trump talk with specifics or details about anything in the last four years.
I was interviewed for an article about my graduate program and they included my comment shitting on Trump and the republicans lmao

We talked with Erin Perrine, Director of Press Operations for the Trump Campaign, about how the media is misrepresenting President Trump...
They do this because they know that anyone with any leanings towards the dem party has no choice but to vote for them. Moderate republicans MIGHT vote trump because he's on their team. a demsoc or socdem won't.  "What are you going to do? Throw away your vote on a 3rd party?"

Imagine being the Dem operative that had to write the memo telling everyone that NOW we have to start back pedalling on the supporting riots stuff, because it benefits Trump.
You call 6400 deaths "a few blunders", you don't need to bring Trump into it to admit that is a POS move
Oh my. Trillions and trillions spent around US and you want to make this about Trump property.
Truly the stupidest thing Trump has convinced his supporters of is that the Democratic Party is “far left” when the majority of them is, at best, center right
Trump should make a commercial of him and Barr recreating that scene from the movie, with clips from the riots interspersed. 😂
Did Trump get a canoe?
Trump is forgetting his history. Way back to the Vietnam war, bone spurs days.He forgot, on the news was reports of war vets leading protests back then. Vets are a big part of the BLM protesters as well. Then as now our war vets are on the correct side. Patriots. Swore an oath.
Clinton or Biden? You can't be serious. I'm up for a debate. Trump has his faults but Joe is wearing diapers and Hilary is on my list of most despicable people ever born. What have they done in the 70 years they've been in office?

To see decency and respect is so important now.  It also reminds me of how completely disgusting, racist &amp; cowardly Trump is in contrast.  Any Trump supporter who supports him any more is also racist knowing TRUMP won't pay his respects to this great leader and icon. Infuriating.

Of course not, John Lewis is African American and a Democrat. Trump hates both.

Yeah, failing upwards doesn’t obey logic or reason. Americans are born hedonists, and Trump and the Conservative echo chamber is an all-you-can-eat bullshit buffet. We’re great, everything we do is right, no shame, no self-awareness, just consumption beautiful consumption!
So Dershowitz is an actual child rapist and the Qanon fuckwits think Trump is trying to take down "child sex traffickers." I wonder how many of them will take down the real criminals in their savior's orbit.

#Maddow #LastWord #Hannity #IngrahamAngle Simply &amp; factually put Trump killed Herman Cain because he wanted his fans to attend his rally so they could clap as he lied about #COVID__19 &amp; mock others who are suffering. That’s his thing. Getting his fans to laugh at the disabled.

I agree with you brother, on most issues.  And I was elated when Trump was elected.  But Jim Jordan tells us how evil Google is when he accepts campaign money from them?  And seriously.  Do you really expect Barr to do anything of real significance.  I don't.  And I'm not alone.

Trump is playing the news media as fools. It is so laughable.
Right - I guess we're never going to escape that sort of reasoning. People can make any sort of argument and "support" it, and they can always find offense in another person.   But for those who seek truth and wisdom, we'll see a huge difference between Obama and Trump.
This is funny, and Stephen Root is great, but it mostly shows how stupid  is. Trumpers will never "wake up." They were never asleep. They voted #Trump for the #racism, the #WhiteSupremacy, and the Christian Terrorism. That's who they are.
It's a shame President Trump hasn't offered any leadership on this issue.

It’s because she is far left and has shown that she despises pragmatism and moderation in politics. I would say a good percentage of her most passionate supporters view someone like Amy Klobuchar and Joe Biden is worse than Donald Trump.

You sure don't seem to mind  #Russian election interference. Seems Trump's on the phone with the  every other day.  What DO they have to talk about?  #PutinsPuppet
No, I don’t, because I was distracted by Trump wanting to delay the election.
TRUMP: I heard your attempt to create a bogus conspiracy around voter-mail in ballots. I will lay my life on the line to vote in-person &amp; drive you out. Also, planning that U, the GOP, FoxNews, &amp; boogaloo goons won’t accept results.
That’s unfortunate. I believe Atone is the right person at the right time. I view Rep. Omar as the left-wing version of Donald Trump.

So according to the constitution, if we don't have an election Nancy Pelosi becomes president on January 20?   Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That’s Unconstitutional.
Donald Trump has refusing to take any leadership. He won't give federal funding, he won't give guidance or guidelines, he won't do his job. The states are not equipped to handle a public health crisis like this, and Trump has doomed our education system.
We didn’t call the other countries shithole countries We didn’t want that raggedy ass fence We didn’t even want trump’s stupid ass. I’m not about to let the rest of the world disrespect and shit on me or feel less than because of this fucked up goberment.
You are correct that Trump and co. didn’t collude with Russia. Collusion means working together. Trump and co. knew Russian was interfering and did nothing to stop them but technically they didn’t work with them so it wasn’t collusion.
Do tell us what Trump said of Lewis's passing...
I wouldn't call the sheep around my house necessarily criminal unhinged Demoncrats "My words" but I can't say they are tolerant either. My dogs are excellent herders. No joke To answer your q I have only had to replace 1 Trump sign not bad. I bought 3. We'll see if I need more.
Unlike Trump floated the idea of selling the Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria- GTFO
Unlike Trump, I'm not a fucking idiot, so that's a big "nope" from me.
Trump was trolling the left!  Saying mail in voting will be ripe with fraud..so maybe delay the election??  Making liberals choose is Trump chess...
Is there a single scenario where Trump loses that he would accept?
DON'T STOP AT POMPEO. HELL RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU CAN'T STAND trump? THE WHOLE trump ADMINISTRATION? , THE WHOLE GOP? THE DIRECTION THIS GREAT COUNTRY OF OURS IS  UNFORTUNATELY HEADING?
This is how liberals are defending their insane indifference to Trump’s authoritarianism today.  Right-wingers drawing a mine has to be more contemptible than those hanging on.  Nothing else works epistemologically.
you very clearly don’t know what you are talking about. You are a puppet of Trump. You are so delusional I can’t believe it!👎🏻
Trump tries to con at every corner &amp; fucks it up a lot. As he tries to lay groundwork for a fraudulent election just wait until he has his minions cast bogus votes for Biden &amp; either they get caught in the process or forget to challenge those votes making the landslide larger.
Do you know what Steven Calabresi is a fascist too, he has supported Trump all along, too late to do the right thing now. ALL Republicans are tied to the mast and the rats will go down with the ship.  🐀 🚢 🌊
RIP to Herman Cain and the thousands that Trump killed because he tried to make wearing a mask a political issue.
"All of this comes from Trump’s weakness rather than strength. A sinking ship. The answer is to maintain the initiative rather than cower.....reporters should be giving GOPers their one chance to denounce  the President’s words. Tomorrow won't cut it.
pls call Cornyn out for lying for Trump. No Senator should accept, cover for or support a POTUS who has lied over 20,000 times to the American people.
clap back 💪
150k+ dead because of the FDA, CDC, Fauci and all politicians downplaying or stopping Hydroxychloroquine from being used en masse. Trump has supported it since first day he knew about it
I am from Indiana where I campaigned for Mike Pence’s 1990 congressional run, I voted for Trump in 2016.  I am completely disgusted by him &amp; his behavior. He is a disgrace to the office and to our country.  I will be voting Biden &amp; straight ticket Dem, the GOP is spineless.
And he caught his death at a Trump rally. Wear a mask.
That’s not saying Trump has not used his pardon power for cronies, and also for others who were serving long sentences for lesser crimes. Y’all never talk about that. And I hate defending the man, but one-sided bias without acknowledging counter facts. Confirmation bias sucks.
You should go for the gold!   I don't think Trump has had a path to reelection in the Midwest for some time now, but virus disaster on top of constitutional crisis on top of criminal conspiracy and collusion that has been his presidency...it's going to be a 🌊🌊🌊🌊
calling it "The Tremendous Depression" would be a nice way of honoring Trump
It’s true tho, he was at the rally and they weren’t wearing masks ... Also ... in the “even worse news for Trump” dept:

I hate Trump, &amp; I hate this video. Dying isn’t funny. My friend (44) was in &amp; out of the hospital from January-June, on oxygen &amp; ventilators. I wish she could have chosen to live or die. She would have chosen to live to be there for her kids, the youngest is 10.
Trump has done plenty to black Americans
"Until recently, I had taken as political hyperbole the Democrats' assertion that President Trump is a fascist. But this latest tweet is fascistic and is itself grounds for the president's immediate impeachment."
Let’s wait until Herman Cain’s funeral where Trump goes off in all kinds of crazy tangents. Oh wait. That’s silly. He won’t be speaking.
LOL, they can’t review “messaging strategy” because they can’t have a strategy at all, Trump is an impulsive man-child who can’t control himself, much less act according to a strategy. 🤣
meanwhile,,, in an effort to ‘stay informed’ I spend an hour every evening reading the same 2 articles called “What Trump said about masks today” and “Everyone wishes Facebook was gone”   going to be reconsidering some things
'Calling' BILL; Fake Trump
Just one look at Trump’s Tweets And I know it's gonna be A lovely day
And Herman Cain signed a document saying “it’s okay for Donald Trump to transmit a deadly virus to me.” Don’t tell me this GOP isn’t a fucking cult.
lmao. I suppose you also support Trump, considering your right wing conspiracy theory rant. Ghislaine and Trump have hung out countless time, and he wishes her well. 👍
You don’t even have the option. Your tweet makes it sound like you could cancel the whole election and crown Trump king if you wanted to. But you can’t so don’t even talk about it—you created Trump, everything he says as does is your fault
No!  And an equally resolute No! to the vote-by-mail frauds who aren't satisfied with the staggering fraud in anonymous no-ID polling  you know, because dead dem voters can't show ID at polls in the United States of America (cheating, patronizing, dirty fraud dems)  Trump 2020
Trump likes this kind of things ('Stuff' would be bad); me
Just about every Resistance type has been panicking about Trump doing this for three years, then he does it and they’re like
A horrifying story. The Russians did exactly this in the Crimea and then used them again in the Middle East. Georgia too. Trump’s response?  Take 12,000 more US troops out of Germany. Awesome.  I feel so much better.
Trump is the only fraud and we’ll stop that on 11/3/2020 with an EPIC LANDSLIDE victory for Joe Biden!
Trump is sarcastic just like everyone else, look up hydroxychloroquine. It saves covid patients. Why can’t patients have the option to use it.
There is no damaging information and whatever they think they have is crumbs compared to Trump and the Republican party’s actions!  Joe Biden will be our next President and there’s nothing traitor Trump can do about that!
Trump is 100% aware of that but thanks for telling us what we already know. Democrats like to tell us they're gonna do all kids of crazy shit they will never do to get a reaction or votes. Guess what, he's playing your own game and whooping that ass!
Would you consider the Civil War unrest? How about WW2? We had elections during both of those. Would you like another civil war? That’s what would happen if trump tried this.
The ONLY reason It would be a battle is because the current president is a criminal and knows fully well the crimes and collusion that will come to light.  This has not happened before. This concern has not happened before.  It is only with Trump because he is fully corrupt.
You’re not pro-life. Not if you support Donald Trump. Nor are you a Christian. You’re a fake. Swirling in a swamp of hypocrisy.
Maybe spend some time on the Trump Virus you stupid fat fvck 🖕🏼
He’s a loser and he will lose in November. The Trump presidency has been the most shameful period of time in our nation’s history.
I still love Trump....All of Trump; me
This is more important than any Trump tweet.
I’ve grown bored of your bullshit now, though, so be sure to be appropriately shocked once all the corruption behind Trump is uncovered after he loses the election
Why are you talking about Trump’s election delay tweet instead of today’s disastrous GDP report? BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS.
He's a Trump toadie. Be very aware of him.
Trump's endorsement record is hilarious, tho.
Also, Trump is not particularly popular with military brass. I don’t think they are inclined to support him.
Opinion: Trump's election tweet shows a frightened narcissist afraid of losing
"In Trump's economy we don't adapt, we sacrifice ourselves needlessly to someone who doesn't give a living shit about us."
There's no precedent in modern politics for the sort of election delay President Donald Trump suggesting in a series of tweets. Here's a closer look at the key questions.
At least you know the shit show is over and aren’t even to try bullshiting for Trump.
Somewhere warm. You were invited to an orgy of all the presidents. They were all there. Washington. Lincoln. Obama and Trump.
Any election in which Trump loses will be viewed as crooked.
Donald Trump is saying that the first election under his watch will be “inaccurate and fraudulent.” He is also setting up the United State Postal Service to achieve the frauds if he does not win.
By that logic a vote not for trump is a vote for Biden.
#RealPresidentObama just makes them understand how truly awful Trump is.
Wait - are you saying that AG Barr doesn't know the Constitution enough to answer a **BASIC** question about if Impeached US Pres  can delay election date?  fuck him, fuck Trump &amp; fuck this

"That said, the former Trump adviser heard an administration official had contacted an outside attorney to see whether Trump could halt the U.S. Postal Service from sending out mail-in ballots, citing attempted fraud or foreign interference."
I've been following you for a while, Rondell, and I just want to say: You're one of the people I'll certainly be listening to after all this Trump nightmare is over. You're talking about issues that go far deeper than Trump, and aren't predictable based on party. (John 3:8)

Donald Trump has never known love.  Pass it on.
The problem with the strategy if the Trump 2020 candidate sucks.
Ok, the job situation was great, everyone had 2 or 3 jobs a piece, because they like to pay rent and eat at the same time.  Slave labor.  Trump promised the slaves good jobs.  I remember, coal and manufacturing, tech, China was going to suffer!  Good paying jobs, that was a lie.
Trump’s Twitter page is now a parody account.
Bottom line is this....if mail in voting is allowed Biden wins. If not, Trump wins. Wake up call to the 249 elected Republicans
Who needs Trump's voter suppression when democrats are doing plenty of it on their own by declaring the election to be rigged by Trump! Get your ballot early. Follow the instructions. Vote right away.
“The U.S. Postal Service is experiencing days-long backlogs of mail across the country after a top Trump donor running the agency put in place new procedures described as cost-cutting efforts “

If you are a Trumpet you think all mail in voting is fraud except for Trump &amp; Kayleigh; if you are a rational person who can think independently &amp; objectively you realize there is probably a certain amount of fraudulent voting in both forms but not enough to decide an election.
That would be fantastic. If Trump screwed up the results and Nancy took over it would be the best justice.
Garry loves to keep bringing up "bleach" because it's the only battle he can win here, but apparently he finds this satisfactory.   The whole world heard it, we know what Trump said.
I didn’t realize Trump was in Minnesota 🤷🏼‍♂️
seems like this got very little attention so far today. maybe trump knew it was coming and floated out the impeachable tweet about delaying the election to divert attention.  i feel like every media outlet needs 50% more reporters.
Reading this makes me wonder if perhaps THIS is part of what Trump is trying to distract from today. Of course, there are so many things to choose from...
The first chapter of my book "MAGA Seduction: Resisting Trumpism and the Debasement of the Christian Conscience" is built around Trump's reading of that poem.   First chapter is online here:
Who ever thought Trump, the business genius, could evaporate trillions? Well, he started his career by burning Fred Trumps $400Mil. Then Trump took a huge leap, the likes of which no one had ever seen and burned up billions of Wall St money and now...POOF GOES THE TREASURY.
I was of the opinion that Trump was a worse person, but W’s actions had more actual real world negative consequences. Then 2020 happened. I now rank a Trump as 2nd worst president of all time.
Serious question for members of the GOP: who among you is hoping Trump will deliver your eulogy?
I think he knows. He is one of the people behind  which is a group of anti Trump Republicans.
If you claim you’ve been waiting four years to get rid of Donald Trump, you can fill out your absentee ballot and mail it back the day you get it.
What is your true opinion of President Trump's mention/suggestion of delaying election?
Even the  political leaders know:  #Trump's claims about the election being unsafe are LIES We had an election during a Civil War, so today is not a problem If you postpone the election, this country will explode.

If he’s re-elected, the vaccine will carry the Trump brand and be every bit as excellent as Trump wine, Trump steaks, and Trump University.

Evict Trump has been in my mind since November 8, 2016.
Here’s the breaking news for all those Trump loyalists: just for the sake of argument regardless of a delayed election or not, Trumps term ends on 1/20/21. Period. If for some bizarre reason Nov results are in doubt, Speaker of the House becomes POTUS.
$70M will 'disappear' enroute to  and   friends; $50 will disappear due to no oversight; $120M will never reach the victims...because it funded Trump's #racist wall;  $28M to services and benefits for  because, no one knows why...
And trump was going to give everyone jobs, jobs, jobs!  What kind of job was he thinking about?
No. That would be in correct. If that were the case Donald Trump would remain president. Come on man.
You know what’s kinda cute?  All these guys spewing hateful bile will be telling their kids/grandkids how they were humiliated by Trump.  They’re all St Peters, love him until you gotta hate him.    Lightweights, with no compass.

Immune systems didn’t exist before Donald Trump. Obama and Joe Biden  and the rest of the Deep State hid the discovery of immune systems, which humans had lived without for 5,400 years, since Adam, Eve and dinosaurs walked the Flat Earth.

You can blame Donald Trump and the Iranian military/U.S. military for that, it's not Riots fault.
Just remember the only reason we’re in the present situation is because Trump and Senate Republicans do not care whether any of us live or die.  Many factors came together to create this moment, but none of them would exist if not for this fact.

Hurry up and finish six of them before Trump declares them "illegal" too.
Anyway, about Trump's butthole. How did you order it done?
Our organization is running anti-Trump ads in rural newspapers. All contributions go to newspaper ads like these.
You cant stand with Trump and also stand with BLM..There is no middle as he's proven in the past he doesn't care. If you support him,like your stan account seems to do,then you are part of the problem. Next thing you are gonna pull out of your back pocket is All Lives Matter.
This is a great argument against Trump’s nonsense.
ugh, the Biden team’s strategy of just staying on the sidelines and letting Trump destroy his own chances at re-election is almost certainly gonna work
This: polling is garbage but we’ll be inundated with it for the coming months. Notice how infrequently the enthusiasm gap is highlighted when they come out to support the narrative that Trump has already lost. And yes, you’ve seen this movie.
Trump: “Now all I need to do is find a few tall buildings with windows that open...”
When the President stepped in and told them to change their recommendations.  They used to be a trusted organization, but we can no longer trust what they say, as they've been turned into a political arm of Trump.
Dear Donald trump the world is under economic collapse the truth set the free and have it come upon our county for we are at warfare with the federation and its time to stop and have piece before its to late the world economic forum is the place of true news.
Folks should come to terms with Orwell being vehemently opposed to everything Trump stands for before trotting out that quote
Too bad Steven will still probably vote for Trump in November. I don’t want to hear anything from him until he says #DumpTrump2020 and #Biden2020
I don't think you can clone A human as disgusting as Donald Trump.  The service reported a $4.5 billion loss for the quarter ending in March, before the full effects of the shutdown sank in
But if Putin hands him the election in the midst of all states using mail-in voting, and Trump wins, then it’s not rigged?
Trump knows he going to jail as soon as he loses in November and is no longer a setting President. But look since the postal service is slowing down why don't you just pardon yourself and sign it and mail it to your self. It should arrive after you lose🤣😂
We argue against false manipulations of the facts. Trump has failed miserably. This and many other things are attempts by him to save face. NO! He has to take the responsibility for his action and inactions.
If Trump had been pro-mask all along, his "friend" Herman Cain might still be alive. #CNN
No, it's exactly what it was—and if you want to insist that Trump merely "exposed" that nefarious side, you've already assumed that's the case.
Thanks for my laugh of the day. Priceless, and I must say trump would approve!!
YEAH, ITS ABOUT TIME THE DAMN PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR trump IN 2016 START SEEING REALITY AND WHAT A F#CKED UP JOB trump HAS DONE IN THE PAST 3 1/2 YRS.
Eric Trump the stupidest Trump
The POTUS is am imbecile...and he’s killing us   REPORTER: A week ago you said you're in the process of developing a coronavirus strategy that's very powerful. Where is it?  TRUMP: "Well, I think you're seeing it. And I think you still see it."
Brutal but fair.  #COVID19 #Trump
haaaaaa YES! And i've never wanted to be a minion :D
Random reminder: Minnesota allows early in-person voting. I'm not sure how it will work in COVID times, but in 2018 I was able to vote at city hall weeks before Election Day. If you're concerned Trump might fuck with the USPS to prevent mail-in ballots, it's worth a thought.
Throw in the rest of the corrupt Trump clan, including Jared and Yep.
trump can F_ _k  up a wet dream!
Did you think Obama had too much power? Or any other President or just Trump?
Listening to Mr. Trump speak after today's memorial speeches by former Presidents Clinton, Bush, and Obama is actually depressing. It just makes me lose hope.
Because that mean admitting that the virus is not a hoax and refusing to wear a mask increases the chance that you catch it. Trump cult can’t possibly do that
Just wait.  September.
I've been saying that for over four years now. In 2016, the Trump campaign even met with Jesse's campaign manager et al to gain insight and advice.
Profile checks out, instantly see retweets of Trump and a dude saying Covid was engineered. Get some education past your 1980's high school degree, I beg of you.
How I feel after seeing the Trump presser.
I didn't screen cap but the Q's were CD5, likely vote screen, Trump 1-10, Biden 1-10, who you voted for in 2016, demo questions. No messaging.
But still claimed Biden’s claim that Trump would seek to delay the election was “without evidence.” So, at the time Biden made the prediction, he was wrong because it hadn’t happened yet?
Do you beat off to Trump's tweets?
Shorty ask me if I support trump.................... huh?
Trump pulling the “holding the elections will be too dangerous” card was far too predictable. We are witnessing a dictatorship.
I love when you call trump three syllable names. Imbecile!
The Commentary magazine take on Trump’s delay talk.  The Federalist society founder’s take on Trump’s delay talk.  The MSNBC take on Trump’s delay talk.  The Democratic elite’s take on Trump’s delay talk.  🤷🏻‍♂️
Do you beat off to Trump's tweets?
Its anazing biden willbe able to avoid debates with likely any consequenses. I dont know trump can win agaisnt somebody who will never ever be vetted or exposed.
Donald Trump directly is responsible for the murder of Herman Cain pass it on
Why is  allowing Trump to spread misinformation about voting?
The same and often worse. He has polled like this for a year even when his approval was 51%. Not sure he lost any real support eith covid. It comes down the the like 10% undecideds as always. If they think a radical senile 78 year old is the future not much trump can do.
I got it. Trump is warning everyone that this “mail in” election is dangerous. Imagine if you will the winner on Election Day is over turned by late mail in ballots. It would be instant civil war. No elected officials would be safe. A nightmare!
I just heard this.. tRump wants to delay elections, But if he does speaker Pelosi becomes president on Jan 1 b/c  tRumps term ends on dec 31!!!! That's why the GOP vehemently oppose any postponement of the elections.
Co-founder of Federalist Society is calling for Trump’s impeachment!   For fascism!  Things are getting worse for Trump by the minute.
Better Dump Trump
It was Obama who said Trump should stop complaining and get more votes. Election is not rigged.  Trump won the election, and of course, it was the crazy liberals complaining that Trump got more votes!  DNC rigged primary, Obama used Fed agencies to target conservatives. Rigged?
Trump genuinely doesn't care if people die, period, regardless of their political affiliation.
i'm more excited about wearing goggles if it didn't make everyone look like minions . there is just no way to pull off this look :D
Donald Trump voted by mail in Florida, as an American people we can’t let him rig another election
It sure does - Trump 2020!
You seem covinced trump will lose. Is that correct?
Was a senior in college. Class, bar, tacos, beers, voted for the Body. Not pround in retrospect.   He was similar to trump though, in that they lack the self awareness to understand they were/are Fing up
The o my fraud is trump and his White House!!!
Herman Cain died due to the #trumpvirus that he got through appearing at an event for the President. Cain’s death is more on the hands of Donald Trump than anything else.
If there were any Americans left controlling the #RepublicanParty someone would pull Trump aside and tell him it is time to go...But #Republicans are what Republicans are...#UnfitForOffice
I see "he" and "lying" in the same sentence and assume you're talking about Trump. Is it this story? It's gotta upset him.
For a businessman, Trump is a pretty bad doctor...and pharmacist...and businessman.
• Since there is no legal way for Trump to unilaterally delay election, red states are simply counted as having 0 votes • Biden therefore wins by the largest landslide in US election history because no red states' votes were counted • Republicans dig their own graves I guess
Best case scenario that won't happen but would make me lol:  • Trump announces that he is delaying election • Blue states continue with election anyway as prescribed by federal law • Blue states overwhelmingly vote Biden • Red states follow Trump's orders and delay election
In 2016, the GOP saw this and still accepted Donald Trump as its leader. The fact that he is now mentally unraveling in the face of a crisis should not have been a shock to anyone. This is why the GOP, as an institution, no longer deserves support or power.
So, should Biden step on all this great news for Trump with VP pick tomorrow? Or let America stew in Trumps failures over the weekend and reveal it on Monday?
Was trump up or close?
You’re misunderstanding the kayfabe here— it’s only rigged if Trump loses
Nice try - cutting out the headline which clearly Trump Virus deaths if NO CONTROL MEASURES were taken.  Doing better than nothing is about the only compliment that can be given to this failure of a President. It must suck to have to lie in order to say something good about Trump
I'll believe the GOP has found a red line they refuse to cross for Trump when a Republican Congressman introduces articles of impeachment in the House &amp; #MoscowMitch's Senate votes to remove him. Until then, their words are just wind, &amp; they own everything Trump says &amp; does.
STOP REPUBLICANS 'TRUMP' FROM BLOCKING THE VOTE! ALL REPUBLICANS ARE BOUND AND COMMITTED TO INSTITUTIONAL RACISM ...!
Perhaps that's because the entire conservative establishment has abandoned any pretense of having principles, and has just cravenly surrendered to Trump.  I'm just spitballing here.
Imagine the various documentaries years from now detailing the HORRORS that headlined the Trump Administration.....
Trump and his followers should come out in full force and vote on November 4th.

I have to vent.  Trump is giving a COVID briefing, expecting to hear about the plan going forward. Nothing!  He is attacking China again for the virus and talking about what a great job he’s done. How does this help?
Dictator Trump....and Barr = Palpatine  #Fascism  #Fascist
I find all the Resistance people dismissing Trump’s election cancellation talk as an attempt at “distraction” quite interesting.
Funny, I heard it was COVID-19 that he got at trump’s Tulsa superspreader
(2) with emoluments he has gone about using the office to try to enrich himself and adult kids since he was sworn in.
Trump knows he’s dead so he’s gonna beat on this “mail fraud” conspiracy to feed his ego an excuse for losing by an historic amount. Or, this could be his pretense for a coup.
At work, co-worker had a Trump speech playing at lunch. No one ever does that. Passive-aggressive to say the least. So I put on Mama Weer All Crazee Now by #Slade on over it. Not loud enough for anyone else, just to drown out President Dementia Test. Tanx for saving the day guys.
For the Republican senators who said trump’s “delay the election” was a joke, this news conference proves he was serious. He should resign. #trumppresscpnference
THAT VAIN ARROGANT CONCEITED EGOTISTICAL trump IS,SO IN LOVE WITH THE POWER N ATTENTION HE NOW HAS THERE IS NO WAY IN HELL WIN LOSE OR DRAW HE VOLUNTARILY LEAVES OFFICE. WHY DO YOU THINK HE BUT UP A WALL? FORMED HIS OWN PRIVATE GESTAPO/SS ARMY? FOR PROTECTION.
Hi Tommy Boy, are you going to allow your buddy Trump to threaten America by delaying the election?
Trump is a horrible human being 😡🤬🤬🤬
It’s my job to educate a Qnut?  Treason is for Trump allowing a US enemy like Putin to pay cash to Taliban to encourage them to kill more of our soldiers. Bribery is forcing Zelensky to announce Biden investigations in exchange for weapons they badly need to fight Russia. And (1)
-33% economic growth ... is this "winning" in the trump household?
trump always manages to find the absolutely worst specimens of humanity.
GDP is at an historic low. US citizens are dying by the hundreds. Federal troops trampling states rights. This is Trump's America.

Nursing some serious mental/emotional whiplash from watching Walz‘ speech earlier and Trump’s now 🥴
And even more
A Washington Post editorial comes within inches of calling Trump a "fascist", using "fascist" and "fascism" ten times in a single piece.  They're catching on.
It seems like all of Trump's "jokes" begin with the premise that he is above the law
trump is doing his deflection bullshit again.  "Defer the election!"  He's attacking voting rights, which, IMO, is a swipe at John Lewis.  And as always, he wants the news/talk to be about him.
I wouldn't loan trump a nickel I didn't intend on losing. Give it to charity,
Trump is an actual moron... he doesn't understand absentee ballots ARE "vote by mail". You sign the ballot-put it in the envelope-drop in the mailbox. I repeat: Absentee ballot voting IS vote by mail. #TrumpIsAMoron
If Biden wins with mail-in voting that’s rigged? If Trump wins with mail-in voting it isn’t rigged?
Maybe do some work, Trump Admin. That's what people vote for.
Donald Trump should resign (pass it on) #TrumpFailsAmerica #TrumpResignNow
Mr. Trump please contact Minneapolis morning radiio   for a quick interview. Your bro   was on a few days ago. #tcnt
If Trump wins, then the en masse mail in voting wasn’t rigged?
Donald Trump is a moron.
“He should be removed unless he relents.”  That should tell you everything about Calabresi’s views. He gave Trump an out.   Don’t be surprised when you see more Rs try to buck Trump closer to the election. They’ve lost faith in him.   Might as well earn that cocktail invite!!
I can do this all day... Your Mom's and my Dad's Democratic party is dead. They have no platform except trump is bad and are doing damage to our countryvanf it's people for power...
His own ignorance was at fault too. He didn't have to listen to Trump. He could've worn a mask. He could've decided not to attend the rally. Actions have consequences.
I thought if the president did it, nothing was against the law. Wasn't that the whole defense strategy during Trump's impeachment?
Now Trump is saying "they're sending out hundreds of millions of mail-in ballots."
And peaceful protestors gassed, pepper sprayed &amp; forcibly pushed back for trump upside down photo op. in front a historical church wasn't?
Trump really doubling down on this delay idea, huh
Agreed! Steele, if he really wants to help, needs to get off his "Trump isn't consulting the right black leaders platform!"
A Republican Congressman Who Might Not Vote For Trump
So, Trump just suggested that if a school doesn't open this fall, parents should be able to take the associated funding to find an alternative. Let us count the flaws here...
Trump sounds like he’s speaking with predictive text
No, he passed away from the Trump virus, which he caught at Trump's ego-fest. Even more than the other 150,000 deaths, this one is  Donald Trump's fault. Health officials warned that it was unsafe to hold that rally but Don needed to have idiots tell him he's great - so he did.
Steven Calabresi, co-founder of the Federalist Society which fed Trump a bunch of super-right-wing "judges", is now calling for Trump's removal, because he claims he did nazi this coming.
Evidently he contracted it at a Trump rally where few if any people were wearing masks, a rally that was wildly irresponsible to hold.
It has been long scrubbed online.  has a you tube. He made a video a month or so ago on John Trump &amp; Tesla. In that video he goes into Stephen Fauci, shows the old articles. He went to library looked up old school way. Real articles. Not too much out there even so.
Wonder if Trump campaign still has Cain's legal waiver from the super-spreader event.
Herman Cain passed away because he went to a Trump Rally in Tulsa and was a dope that didn’t want to wear a mask. Don’t be a dope, wear a mask. #DonaldTrumpKilledHermanCain
WELL THAT LEAVES trump.OUT OF THE DISCUSSION
Bobby loves him some Trump.
Trump is a fascist. #TRE45ON
Being the Steno Pool for Trump's Twitter feed is not professional journalism.
What's your point? You're aware that countless members of the GOP, including Trump, Barr, McConnell, and on and on and on have voted by mail more than once, right?
"One of the most infectious diseases anyone has ever seen."  -Donald Trump July 30, 2020  "But I think it's fine to wear a mask, if it makes you feel comfortable."  -Donald Trump July 9, 2020  #Covid_19
It sounds like Trump is looking to set  as president. If a new president isn't elected, that's the conditional provision! 🤣
“Herman who? I met him once, twice maybe??? I barely knew him. He was a a big Trump guy. They say he came to my rally in Tulsa??? What rally? I didn’t have a rally. Nobody will let me rally because of the China virus hoax. Did you know I shut down our border with China?”
Donald Trump is painfully embarrassing to watch...
None.  I have researched our options as well as Europes options. Even the European countries are upset because Trump's actions threaten their security. Clearly they are fearful. If they panic so much over this amount, I believe we should exploit that fear for our gain.
Herman Cain Symbol of shame Died for Trump rather than in Jesus's name...  Sorry if some might find this offensive, but Mr. Cain wasn't a difference maker for others the way John Lewis was. And for those Trumpians who had hateful and ugly things to say about John Lewis, GFY
“It’s highly infectious” - Trump. So wear a damn mask!
Also, point to me where Trump made a "threat". He made a comment based on recent reports indicating how easy it would be to commit voter fraud with mail-in ballots or the number which would be lost.
It’s a shame you’re too damn blind and you can’t connect Trump to this. He don’t give a rats ass about anyone but himself. And I pray for Herman’s loved ones as they grieve
Was trump &amp; gop traitors attached to the rocket by chance?
Minnesota elections official calls Trump's threat to move election day 'dangerous', but 'empty'
Yes me too. You know it never use to me this way. They had debates, commercials and then you voted and it was over.  Now it is constant hate coming from both sides. Dems don't care about violence as along as it makes Trump look bad and then there is Trump and his character flaws.
You’re telling me Donald Trump and Joe Biden are the best we got to represent our country? Someone say sike right now
No. He didn't deserve to die gasping for air in an induced coma, but neither did any of the other nearly 150,000 Americans.  But only a tiny handful of Cult45 went on Fox Propaganda Network &amp; spouted to  millions of partisan morons the Trump-approved anti-science bullshit. T&amp;P
LIVE: President Donald Trump is addressing the nation from the White House.
Trump didn't fail whatsoever. What did you want him to do, declare martial law, quarantine the entire country, and give everyone $100,000 stimulus check? And fueling racism? Are you insane? Do you not listen to mainstream media calling damn near everyone but black people racist?
As long as they continue to a point conservative federal judges and the possibility remains of flipping two more seats on the Supreme Court to the conservative side  There is literally no bottom conservatives have with Trump
Feeling energized by a speech?  I was energized the moment I saw that Trump had won the election  Watching democracy get flushed down the toilet is motivation for me I don't need any speeches
I don't believe there is any value is watching Trump live on TV. His whole schtick is to com the viewer. Watching commentators pro and cons THEN viewing the footage gives me more insight.
Things Trump is trying to distract from: John Lewis' memorial service, Herman Cain's death (caused by the Tulsa rally), a 33% drop in the GDP, and the Trump campaign laundering millions. Still very terrifying that he wants to at least pretend he is willing to destroy democracy.
It doesn’t look like Clark is a Trump supporter
100% on target 🎯  Trump would play her like a fiddle
correct spelling is tRump
Don’t get too excited, not a single conservative educated on the Constitution thought for a second POTUS could or even would try to do it. Classic Trump tweeting b4 consulting. Prof. Calabresi isn’t voting for your socialist agenda either.
We have to stand up and make Donald Trump a one term president when voting starts give rides to people to go vote. Lets get rid of want to be dictator Trump.
As a member of Congress she's coming from a place of very high privilege knowing that even another four more years of Trump will only give her more 30-second sound bites to raise money off of to help solidify her career
I think some of the argument is they can be identified through other things. Much like we figured out Individual 1 was Trump, since the doc described that secret person as the one who won the 2016 presidency.
Like Trump’s 2016 Oval Office bid 🙄, you guys should be self funding
Wow. The hysteria is turning us into worse people than we were before tRump. If people want to risk their health or that of their families, that’s their business. Stay six feet away and be glad you’re not that dumb. #CalmDown #FFS
The world is saying wear a mask and that Trump is a fucking lunatic. That sum it up enough for you?
I’m not ruling that out - not at all - but we don’t know that with certainty. Trump is a narcissist. Narcissists have very fragile egos. They need to be constantly admired and ingratiated. That’s why he surrounds himself with scummy ‘yes-men’ who always tell him how great he is.
It really is remarkable how juxtaposing any human being with Trump elevates that person to god like status.
Trump is a full time mad man💯💯 You can never win it Never!!!!!!!😡😡😡😡😡😡
Of course it was a distraction and you fools in the media will run around chasing every place Trump throws the laser pointer  Why aren't you asking him what the hell about the bounties on American soldiers?
Bring it!!!!! U.S. Backs Down, Allowing Michael Cohen to Write Trump Tell-All Book
Know this: Trump, Barr and McConnell will do anything to win. Anything. Even when the election results are irrefutable, they will challenge them.   We will ultimately win but November will be uglier than anything we’ve seen these past 4 nightmarish years.   We must be ready.
Notice he only banned Chinese from entering, not sick Americans who were in China.  The virus does not know nationality. All Trump did was keep Chinese out, not the virus.  That’s xenophobia, NOT protection.  Then he had NO plan to stop community transmission.  Nice try.
What Trump is doing online today by suggesting 1) pushing back Election Day and 2) disparaging mail-in voting during the middle of a health crisis which has killed 150K+ Americans is a sign that he’s losing badly and probably won’t accept the results of the election, regardless.
If Trump loses, there won't be any rebuilding for a LONG time. Democrats are Communists. It'll be the last election where votes are actually counted. Notice how China doesn't hold elections? One party rule ad infinitum. The party picks it's leaders; like DNC will pick for Biden.
He was apparently fine with everything Trump did from grabbing women by the pussy, a disaster pandemic response, throwing kids in cages  who cares about this guy says he's not going to sway one Trump voter  Don't give him any oxygen
I hope Trump proposes the 999 plan in honor of Herman Caine.
"Trump is simply TOO STUPID to be President."
ya know what else is good to do? check your privilege. i can't believe actually said voting for biden is the same as voting for trump.  what the hell are you smoking?
BOTH THE TRUMP BOYS ARE MURDERS!! NOW THEY'RE KILLING ANIMALS THAT ARE GOING EXTINCT!! PIGS!! 🐷🐷💩💩
President  brought up the idea of postponing the general election in November. Does he have the power to do that?
Damn right. Reawgan was Trump 1.0, the historical whitewashing of his genocidal, racist, elitist legacy is sickening. Reagan was a goddamn monster.
If Biden wins the election can we also impeach Trump and evict him in November?
Trump is IN office and we DO have Mobs and he is so concerned about the vote that he will not stand up for Justice for America. Disgusting!!!
I am always and forever glad that I don't have kids, but never so much as during Donald Trump's catastrophic COVID-19 failures.
Trump is IN office and we DO have Mobs and he is so concerned about the vote that he will not stand up for Justice for America. Disgusting!!!
Pompeo is afraid of Trump. Coward.
The #TrumpVirus is the reason we need mail-in voting. 2016 is the most fraudulent election with massive Russian interference for Trump. #150KDead, #GolfbeforeEthics, #Golfbeforelives
Oh, the Trumpsters just like to give credit to Trump for everything good, but pretend he has nothing to do with anything bad. They live in a dream world.
And when evangelicals surrounded Trump as being their leader God is unleashed a plague up on this world and the United States in particular is bearing a full-on hurricane level shitstorm from it
I agree with that. Trump will try to create chaos. Fortunately, there are some very smart Democrats who will stand in the way, and will be calming voices. It's hard to game it out now, but the important thing is that we must vote in overwhelming numbers.
I believe Trump died months ago. What we see is a barely functioning animatronic simulation. Explains the listing, the strange gait, the incoherence.
Many political scientists &amp; pundits trying to assure us that Trump can’t postpone the election, but the real story here is that he thinks he can &amp; wants to do it. That’s plenty significant in &amp; of itself. #WeWillVote
The statement was clearly grounded in a reading of Trump's character.
How much of a kickback is Trump getting?
I like our governor, but I agree with you on Traitor Trump. I can't stand him either.
Man, it only took most of the days tweets for you to get to this.  Bet Trump didn't even write it.
Any Democratic elected official; ANY DEMOCRAT...A N Y would be light years better than trump...a democrat on the city council of a town of 1000 people in rural Ohio would be better than trump.
Lol Trump always torpedoing his own administration.
Trump is John Doe 1. #TrumpJohnDoe1
I don't think Trump killed him. I meant what I said. If I was in my 70's and knowingly risked infection, I think a Trump rally would be a great way to go!
He drank the Trump Kool-Aid and died. Should be a lesson for all of you.
I own mine. I say all the time I was Never Biden since the Thomas hearings. Even after all that, Biden is still better than Bernie or Trump.
But what if local and state officials decide they agree with Trump?
6+9+7 -5 (trump kids) is 17. Q is the 17th letter. Puzzle solved.
If there's one thing I learned during the Republican defense during Trump's impeachment hearings, it's that nothing the president does is illegal, so your entire list is moot.
Occasionally I remember that I was banned from the UMD fans Facebook group for objecting to the idea of the men's hockey team visiting the White House. I fucking love being right.  Also I was called "as bad as Trump" by a former friend during that time period.
Few people seem to appreciate that ballot counting is typically carried out county by county, state by state.  Think there are any county officials -- in Florida, say -- that will follow Trump's orders? There's not much you can do about it, either.
He ran in 2012, not 2016. And he died of COVID-19 which was from Trump’s vanity rally. Seems worth noting.
Is it easy going through this new life of yours without having to use your brain? It is apparent Trump tells you how to act and what to say.
The Kremlin will remember your password for a small donation to the Trump re-election campaign.
(But they secretly vote for Trump)
Interesting that the former Newt Gingrich aide twitter bot farmer is so invested in defeating a progressive Muslim woman in a safely democratic district where her opponent is being funded by large dollar Trump-backing and anti-union republicans. Seems to add up actually
Our old buddy Herman Cain succumbed to COVID-19 after attending the Trump rally in Tulsa that was a “Super Spreader” event. Norm would have played that tape we heard so often of Herman saying, “Blame yourself”.
The John Malkovich character and the Space force leader is Steve Carrell. Hahaha Trump made this one funny.
Gohmert: “I think my girlfriend got pregnant BECAUSE I wore a prophylactic. Just like my idol Trump, bareback is always the way to go!”
If Trump told the brutal truth about COVID your mentor might still be alive. The president killed your friend.
No i guess just basing it vs last election was all where trump was mostly up in rasmussen.  Its not important i just thought it was the most reliable poll of the big names
And in the mean time, we need to vote by mail, before Trump can mess with it...
If Obama was the counterpart to Trump's racism like liberals claim, I'm eager to see how liberals reconcile that with Obama droning the shit out of brown kids in the Middle East and East/North Africa. Imperialism wasn't somehow better under Obama. #ObamaWasBetterAtEverything
Conservative media is going wild politicizing the death of a black Trump supporter, so shove it.

Due to Trump’s mismanagement, guess what the new epicenter of the pandemic is
Correct. Because he was appointed by the Court, only Trump could remove him.
How about you give your opinion on his attempt to seed the ground to stop the election? You won’t. You and those like you are so far gone that there is literally nothing trump can say or do that would make you say anything about it.
Back from a social media hiatus and I must say that there is nothing I missed more than watching Trump hurt his election chances daily via TWITTER

My friend, pray for Trump. He's the least Christlike among us.
He went to a trump rally with no mask. He is an educated person. We did not fail him. We are failing as a country many... But he made his choices.
Trump is a lot of things. And clever isn't one of them..
and Cain lied about it.. "The media worked very hard to scare people out of attending the Trump campaign rally last Saturday night in Tulsa." "Yes, there were some empty seats in the nosebleed sections, but 16,000 people in the COVID-19 era is pretty impressive" -Herman Cain
Rest-assured. With Trump it's a certainty there won't be.
No you know you will lose BIGLY and that is why you are trying to change the date.  And once you lose, you will be a pariah throughout the world, jeered and hated and unwelcome everywhere decent people go. Trump will be the name of shame in history books.
He was a serial-lying buffoon "The media worked very hard to scare people out of attending the Trump campaign rally last Saturday night in Tulsa." "Yes, there were some empty seats in the nosebleed sections, but 16,000 people in the COVID-19 era is pretty impressive" -Herman Cain

It was Trump doing what he always does  He shines a laser pointer and all of the fools in the media runs to cover it while not asking him the question, what about the f****** bounties on the heads of American troops

LDF Responds to President Trump’s Suggestion to Delay the 2020 Election -
Asked about President Trump’s suggestion that the November election be delayed, Walz says that’s “distracting us from what’s on Minnesotans’ minds” like reopening schools and growing the economy.
What The Trump medical administration did was politics to get leadership seats without the medical degrees and experience in the practice. The CDC had several different labs in the US. And strongly worked with WHO, and Trump removed WHO and has no idea what labs were CDC labs.

Buzz off loser. 💩 #TrumpIsNotWell #TrumpFailsAmerica #TrumpThreatensAmerica #TrumpVirus #Trump #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #VoteJoeBidenToSaveAmerica
How about if the media starts focusing on bounties that are put on the heads of American troops rather than following Trump down every rabbit hole that he digs for them  Y'all let Trump play you like a fiddle and then whine because you're not taking seriously
Trump is going to attempt to turn the US military on the people, to claim that any dislo8to him is treason and that he has the right to occupy our cities and towns.  He is not above this.
The voters, the voters will stop him  But the media is going to have to get over their obsession with following Trump down every rabbit hole that he digs for them  Stay frosty and focused on the issues that truly will determine Trump's electoral future
That and his jealousy of the attention a dead man is getting! Trump wil never receive the respect and admiration John Lewis has earned and received and it eats at him!
Correct me if I’m wrong, but if somehow Trump succeeds at postponing the election, he has to leave office Jan 20th regardless &amp; Pelosi becomes POTUS, right? Like, if we still do the constitution and whatnot...of course if he postponed the election, the constitution is gone...
Let’s talk about this instead of Trump’s fantasy of delaying the election
Was it Trump's butthole?
For what? He hasn't broken any laws unlike Biden who did exactly what Trump was falsely accused of in the impeachment hoax.
Trump and the Republican Party have had more than 6 months now to get their s*** together so our schools can reopen properly and with adequate personal protection  Y'all have not taken this seriously and now expect everyone else to fall on swords to try to save you
I literally cannot imagine. What kind of self loathing makes you support Trump?
SHIT, ALL Y'ALL GONNA GET IS A "trump" after "trump" FROM  THAT WHY I BLOCKED IT.  WOULD NEVER ANSWER THE QUESTION I ASKED , EITHER IGNORING IT OR TALK ABOUT SOMETHING TOTALLY IRRELEVANT TO THE QUESTION I ASKED.
I propose we postpone the election until Trump's popularity numbers start moving in the positive direction, then he could be president forever.
That isnt a morale crusher.  I get far more worried seeing trump down 6 and 7 points is polls he is usually very close in. All i read about is everyone switching to trump yet the gap once again seems to be going the other way . Just baffling to me biden could be up in legit poll
Trump should have added "I'm reclaiming my time".😂
And at this point, Trump is trying to rig the election again, so the more of his voters drop from COVID, the better for our country. Terrible thing to think, sure, but true.
If new Trump postmaster is allowed to proceed with cuts, he's doing so SOLELY to help Trump win.  Sen Manchin (D-WV) noted the coronavirus relief package passed in March sought to avoid cuts like this, but USPS had not touched that funding.  #Corruption

An authoritarian. Trump thinks it’s perfectly safe for kids to go to school and for us to have normal economic activity, but far too dangerous right now to have a democracy. See how this works everyone.
Yes it is a diversion Trump throws all this s*** against the wall as diversions and liberals pick it up and run with It freaking about the latest thing  Liberals need to remain focused on what will actually hurt Trump and none of this s*** will
We need some good news. Even normal trump friendly polls have not looked good thia week. Im getting worried
OK Gov Stitt, ALSO diagnosed with COVID. He sat in the same row as Herman Cain did at Trump rally in Tulsa.  If it's all just coincidental -- and if it's true that masks don't help -- it's odd there sure seems to be a whole lot of anti-mask Republicans being diagnosed with COVID.

Im not so sure anymore. Even trump friendly polls dont look that great now. Down 6 in ras. Down 7 in ibs. Down 7 in harris. Those were  always good polls for him. Kind of starting to expect a loss now but hope i am wrong.

Getting rid of Trump and Pompeo?
I feel horrible for the Cain family. And despite Trump's (staff) tweets, can anyone credibly say that Donald cared if Herman lived or died?  Nothing in Trump's past suggests that he does. I agree that we shouldn't stoop to T's inhumanity towards others, tho.
Psych ward? Free thinker? Hahahaha NOPE! What's crazier than believing every lie you are told by a NARCASSISSTIC SOCIOPATHIC conman who doesn't care about anyone but HIMSELF? It's like watching stupid sheep being led to SLAUGHTER or watching Darwinism in action! Now THAT'S crazy!
Anyway, I'm sorry Trump's inaction ruined your food eating.
Seeing Obama speak at John Lewis’ funeral on the day Trump is trying to cancel the election reminded me that the before times were so much better, and now I’m literally out of hope and want to cry all the time.
You keep saying these things, and they all relate to Trump. But you don't say "Trump." It's really weird.

Hell, YES! I am ready to vote! Don’t think Trump realizes that without CIVID there’d be many more of us out there protesting his lack of leadership.
Donald Trump should resign (pass it on) #TrumpFailsAmerica #TrumpResignNow
Yes, really it’s a matter of who wins Wis, Fla, Penn, Mich and maybe a couple others. It was close last time with misogyny as a factor. Now that it’s a boring old white guy and Trump has had three years to show his total incompetence I have to think that’s enough to swing.
Where in the Constitution does it say the President needs to follow the law? That sounds like a Trump tweet.
This was always going to be the end result of a Donald trump presidency and every republican say by and let this happen.
I’m not gonna bother arguing. I implore you; however, to look at the policy between Biden and Trump when it comes to race. You’ll see which one has a stronger anti-racist mindset. Look at what they say policy-wise, disregard your bias, then say who’s racist.
Plus, he’s just a famous face that died from it. How many other Trump rally-goers have also died, or will die, that did not wear masks or socially distance? He didn’t have to die. Trump is responsible.
Donald Trump should resign! Plus, what she said!!! 👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻
Trump killed Herman Cain.
Yup. It won't keep Trump in office. It will motivate some of America's worst people.
Serious question: how would one determine that Trump lost because of VBM?
And how many BILLIONS have they gotten from Trump you wind bag!  How about you tell us what the drug companies have spent of their own money vs what they got from the gov't for COVID only!
Trump shrank GDP by 32% and didn’t use the sacrifice to form a coherent or useful national response; perhaps Congress should move the election up?
They're literally the same thing. Also, Trump has no power to delay the election, it's hard-wired into the Constitution and run by the states. And if you think Trump doesn't know he's losing...he clearly knows he's losing.

Trump needs to activate the military and use lethal force against Antifa. They are trying to destroy our country to install communism and they are using BLM to do it.
I’ll trust sources like Harvard, Oxford, the CDC, the WHO, Licensed doctors, certified clinics, and common sense over this obviously bias hackery.    Masks work. Even trump and top level republicans (Mitch McConnell) said masks were “patriotic”.
💯%!!! LOVE TRUMP! #VoteRedToSaveAmerica
Suburban racists don't like to believe that they're racists. They are, but they like to tell themselves they really aren't. Some will go with Trump, but a whole bunch will recoil.
The problem for Trump is that it's getting late early.
In all honesty, Trump's transparent racism will backfire in the suburbs. I'm not saying there isn't racism in the burbs, there absolutely is, but it isn't the kind of proud, KKK racism of our president. That's still considered gauche.
If schools can fire teachers for saying “Trump is president”, then yes.
To be fair, this isn't as ridiculous as it sounds. TikTok is basically a conduit straight to the CCP. Of course, I assume Trump is doing this to get kickbacks from the Chinese government.
Is almost 5 trillion and only going up! He blames everyone but his horrible reaction to Covid! The States doing the worst our all run by Republican governors! That have been loyal to Trump! That’s what I see! I go by my eyes and ears! Not what comes out of Trumps mouth!
I can’t stand the way Trump talks everyone’s terrible! The people curing trouble are not anybody but white supremacy and neo-nazis that Trump has put out there to make protesters look bad! He is playing games with our lives and our livelihood for 3 1/2 yrs now! Our country’s debt
Watching cartoons is a much better use of your time at this point. Trump, Barr, et al, are fencing a hell of a reckoning this year and they know it. The childish antics, looting of the US Treasury, will ramp up until the Biden Administration, D majority Senate takes over in Jan.
#Polling Here is a note from a polling group: "The Trafalgar group weights its polls to account for “social desirability bias,” or the so-called shy Trump voters who are embarrassed to tell pollsters that they support the president."  - So that can be accounted for in a poll????

CNN: “Trump has states #Hydroxychloroquine is the cure for COVID the entire time as well as many doctors who have been silenced or killed. Time to say it isn’t true and tell you all to put masks on quickly now!” FTFY
America doesn’t need masks, we have a cure for COVID and have had it for over ten years #hydrochloroquineWorks 150,000 deaths prevented by Trump by suggesting this cure and closing off China. Let’s blame 2020 on trump tho not the rioters... 😂
One of the reasons "But what if Trump comes out with a vaccine on the November 1st?" falls flat is that nobody will believe him.
Durrr this is twumps amewica it’s all his fault Wahhhh.  I don’t see conservatives or trump himself rioting, just Ill informed children.
#Unity Trump says he won't be paying is respects to John Lewis. Biden did. That tells you all you need to know about who will unite this country.
Only positive things said about Trump should be able to trend.
Im sorry. I lost my father and grandmother both to cancer just before China sent this to us. I couldn’t imagine the stress of caring for someone that sick while this is going on. I am a trump supporter as well but wearing a mask seems like an easy step to move this forward.
Don’t you think they will continue after trump wins again ?
Don’t forget all the people he killed in nursing home and denying #Hydroxychloroquineworks the cure for COVID the ENTIRE time. Way to go MSM, allowed tons of people to die in another attempt to blame trump.
Let’s straighten out your delusion. The swamp was the Mitch McConnell Paul Ryan swamp. That changed when Ryan lost/left and Trump appeared. Trump swilled Bill Barr in and created the cesspool!! We now really need to drain the cesspool!!! You’ve been schooled!!
And how do you think it could be prevented? Americans actually social distancing? Trump has nothing to do with that. He closed the US while Fauci said "it's safe to keep open" oh, and 22% of our deaths are from one state.
Except this likely wouldn’t happen to Biden if he became president, since he already has policy which would directly help these communities. Part of the reason these happened in the first place was due to trump not addressing key racial issues (ex: disproportionat covid deaths)

“We are witnessing a crisis of democracy that is perfectly acceptable to a significant portion of the population — as long as it hurts their enemies.” Trump’s Portland deployment reveals a crisis of the Republican Party - Vox
He has had something to do with the federal agents deployed there. After that developed, the protests became larger and more pronounced.   I ain’t saying democrat leadership is innocent. I’m saying trump didn’t help the situation
Sure, that may be a reason; however, you can not deny the fact that Trump’s leadership exacerbated the problem. He loves the fight, and he has tries to trade blows with people that are rightfully upset at a system that wronged them. There are multiple factors to this.
I'm with you.  No way I'm getting a Covid vaccine approved under Trump's FDA.
I am assuming Trump invited himself to throw out the first pitch and the Yankees said no fucking way.

I actually don’t mind Donald Trump my tweeds I just think he is divisive as all get out and doesn’t have a lot of wisdom
Donald Trump hasn’t had a hard day in his life. He has always had money and a supporting cast. Why would people not see that? I think trumpers do see something in him that they can relate to. The fearlessness, the ability to do what one wants. They like freedom and guns.
This might be a controversial take but I think that a lot of trumper are smarter or have more wisdom than Donald Trump who they believe in. Think about that for a second.
Your party's position - and silence - on Covid has been loud and clear since Trump first ignored repeated warnings from our experts, called it a hoax, failed to put together a strategy, repeatedly shifted the blame, and now whines that no one likes him. What are we missing here?
Your Friday Briefing
Stringing together two related, coherent thoughts is really asking a lot of Donald Trump.
Wait!  They went home?  How is Donnie going to be able to sign the health care bill he promised would happen in two weeks?  I'm crushed that Trump lied to us.  Shocked.  I'm so shocked.
Kind of like how he needed Congress to approve funds to build the wall? Trump does not believe in the Constitution or the independence of states or anything that limits his absolute power.
Did you not say MONTHS AGO....testing needs to be done anyone who wants it can get it, it will be easy and accessible.  THEN WHY DO YOU GET TESTED EVERY DAY with SAME DAY RESULTS and we wait 14 days or more?  You said you'd have a plan. YET you've NEVER disclosed one. TRUMP=LIAR
I wish you people would spend even 10% of the energy you use to get worked up about Trump on critically reviewing Walz. I’d take 5%.

Trump’s Tulsa rally has its first confirmed kill. 😡🤬  Herman Cain attended. Got Covid and has died. #TrumpKilledHermanCain
Trump caused me to drive into the pool.
Yikes 😬  But he can't do that though too, congress should and will definitely not do this.  But in other context, Trump will throw anything as a curveball for this election. Like possibly not wanting to accept if he loses.  So get out there, and vote for Biden. Please.
You mean like your FAKE words how We've got the virus under control"?  Trump you're so mixed up in the head it's scary to think you're the President....I'll never vote for you unless it's putting you in JAIL or an INSANE ASYLUM because either works for the WORLD
If you’re expecting one, you don’t know Trump very well.
Cause the stuff that Donald trump is doing is very supportive for the economy and the unemployment rates were at their all time low.(COVID messed it all up but we r starting to get back on track) he just does a lot of good stuff but the media doesn’t care about it for some reason

Does trump know that 1 of his cronies Herman Cain has died of the virus? He put him in charge of HHS at 1 time, so does he know him, does he barely know him, does he know him at all?
Garbage like this is why Trump will be re-elected.
This is my Election Day countdown poster. Each day Trump drives a dump truck one step closer to the trash heap. I feel validated :)
Well what do you think will happen when DEMS refuse to open their states? Don’t blame Trump. States that are open are doing great.

Trump is, by nature, an opposition candidate. I’m not sure he’s even capable of thinking or acting like a true leader.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Donald Trump just needs to go.  Dude needs to obey some rules of the United States.  I know it is hard for him.  But you can't be there longer than 4 years my dude.
But Trump wants to cancel the election on 03 Nov
Secret service already has a plan to forcibly remove trump on January 21st 2021. Following the constitution he will be removed no matter what
Funny how Delaying the Election is the only covid precaution Trump is interested in. 🤔 Values his presidency over the lives of all Americans. NO DELAY! #NoDelay End the Banana Republic.
Lol, Trump is a genius, he just doesn't lose!
There’s still time for Trump to drop out and avoid his ultimate fear in life of officially being labeled a loser in the annals of history.
Absolutely not!  #4NoTrump  BBC News - Trump calls for delay to 2020 US election
Trump has finally done something no other president has ever done.  No one has seen numbers like this. The best ever.  I know this isn't totally his fault, but can't resist using his own type words back at him.
I don’t foresee myself trusting a Trump-touted vaccine.  I’d rather stay in my house until 2021.
They literally will do ANYTHING to prevent Trump from being re-elected.  Of course it works-doctors everywhere continue to prescribe and it’s efficacy has been confirmed in a peer reviewed study.
The chilling thing about Seattle and Portland is not Pres Trump but the mayors &amp; governors who allow these protests to get out of hand. Seattle Mayor didn’t do a damn thing until they went for her home!  she still hasn’t said anything about the young black man killed by CHOP!
This will continue if Trump stays in position and uses stupid Pompeo, Navarro ...

Trump's decision to move troops from Germany slammed as 'a gift to Putin' - CNNPolitics. Fucking traitor!
You're right. Trump is such a cancer  he has to go. Harris is the logical choice. I feel she is the best person to put up in 2024. Honestly I can't see Biden going 2 terms. If he wins, he will be one of the OLDEST inaugurated Presidents ever.
You think trump pays his kids 170 million. That is senator money not west wing money
I hear that, I’m getting it from both boys in my life since suddenly my 14 year-old son, who was ready to move to Canada with me when Trump won, now thinks he’s the shit. I don’t think they even comprehend what the narcissistic bigot is doing to our country!!
Troops being sent to Cleveland, Milwaukee &amp; Detroit.  Maybe I missed the news about those cities being ripped to shreds.  Trump will be inciting riots, not quashing them.  wtf can we do?
I have received the registration forms to mail in my ballot, but I can’t do it. I will worry that somehow my vote against Trump won’t count: I will do something wrong, not mark something completely, it will get lost or show up too late...So in-person works for me!
As soon as trump is gone, he will become an even bigger security risk to the US, if that’s even possible. We need someone to keep an eye on him, unless the dept of corrections does the job.

If you vote for Trump, you are signaling that you are OK with racism.
Certainly hope everyone upset about Trump’s comments are willing to work for welcoming zoning practices moving forward. Neighborhoods — progress and conservative — have a poor track record of accepting different types of housing.
Why did you wait until you are losing? More phony Trump beliefs
Whoa another LOOK WHAT IM DOING ...yet you didn't for 3 and a half years....buying votes...Trump....lol...you're as predictable as you're needing to put on your rug
Sure there Trump Towers....they won't be hurt by low income housing being built because they already are low income housing ...so building more won't hurt their neighborhoods since they are already that
Why Trump never brings up the death and families that are affected EVERY DAY.....because he knows he's responsible.  Now he supports a doctor claiming Alien DNA and Celebrity Dream Impregnation, yeah he's living in Reality almost as much of a Republican voting just for a party
can’t stand strong women like Merkel. She dissed trump and he is pissed, plus his boss Putin told him to do that so he has to comply.
We've seen Quid Pro Joe in action in the Ukraine, how is Trump corrupt?
Trump Did Not Ask Putin About Russia's Bounties on U.S. Troops
Trump is Racist. Not even pretending he’s not at this point.
I especially hate how a trump forced all those elderly infected with Covid back into those LTCs
Can tRump be any more obvious? Should this discusting racist be elected for another 4 years, i am outta here!
Today I came to terms I’ll probably never see my dads side of the family ever again. They all racists and trump supporters. Wild as hell
The fact he still, after 4 years, wets his pants when he sees a picture of Trump. Marxists are the losers in life that need the rest of us to support them and he was counting on having his ass wiped by his liberal deities. Instead he now just cries himself to sleep.
I just have to say how much I appreciate your willingness to speak truth to power. Spot on... as now trump is pulling troops from Germany. A Putin bucket list item.
Are you serious? Now you are going to tell in the south that you have been actively supporting wearing masks? It wasn’t until the last few weeks those mandates started happening. In just happened in MN. And most areas were fairly onboard except trump districts
Trump has violated his oath of office so by your reasoning he should be removed.
No shit! Wow is that federal or state cuz trump can pardon fed but not state right?
Your daily reminder that if you vote for Donald Trump you are a racist.
Not if your cause is to promote violence to justify sending in illegal unidentified "troops". Trump is really good at staging his narrative. It's all fascist showmanship.
Gullibility is not for me even if it comes from a pretty face. It’s akin to all the shit that Trump doles out on daily basis and then say one sane thing and US media go nuts with plaudits that he start looking presidential. Hamza is what he claim he is so I believe him - a bigot
Bless you President Trump🙏

OMG... Trump supposedly doesn't drink, but he always sounds drunk.
The fact that, after everything (corruption, convictions, impeachment, over 4 million covid cases, From Russia with Love, blatant nepotism, etc) Trump still has a chance speaks volumes for the both sides are equal narrative and right wing media.
It’s always Opposite Day with this guy.   Translation: Trump. Trojan Horse. Russia.

Maybe that poll is an outlier, but in most other states that Morning Consult polled Trump was doing worse.  Biden up 7 in WI for example.
According to the latest Morning Consult poll, Biden is up 3 in MN. Would be wild (and on brand for 2020) if Trump won MN but lost the election.

Hey Kev, read the room. The idiots you need to be reminding about “notes” are all your fellow sheep making excuses for dementia Joe. They, just like you, also pissed their pants about Trump and his “notes.”
Dr. Stella Immanuel the celebrity dreaming impregnating Dr.  Trump "I'm a big fan of hydroxychloroquine, I thought she was impressive, but I know nothing about her." You thought she was impressive cause she agrees with you. Where's your medical credentials Trump?
Trump said he didn't know anything about the Dr (Stella Immanuel) he just liked what she said about hydroxychloroquine. Exactly, makes him look right.  FDA, CDC, NIH, Unniv. of MN, all said it doesn't work, but he'd would Wrong.  EGO..let's believe the Witch Dr.
Trumps female doctor he believes and takes advice on about hydroxychloroquine has said  women can get pregnant by witches in their dreams by astral sex.  Dr. Stella Immanuel...she's a FRAUD.  Doesn't want to believe Dr. Fauci...because he contradicts Dr. Trump.

It is the former.  One of the few times tRump drew Barr's rancor (publicly stated that tRump was making his job as AG, impossible to do) was born out of a tRump tweet. Of course he reads tRump's tweets.
How could anyone do a worse job than Trump. I’d vote for Jeff before Trump in a heartbeat.
I understand perfectly. Biden isn’t perfect. He wouldn’t be my first choice, but Trump is my last choice. In 45 years in politics Biden has done less harm than Trump has in his 3.5 years. Of course all lives matter.  Nobody is saying they don’t.

OMG, so a Trump supporter who knows Bible verses. Does the President?  Let me guess he's being taught one for a press conference today.    I suggest domething from Genesis and the Serpent.  He'll probably want to reference himself as great as GOD though since Lincolns  been used.
Remember yesterday when the Trump campaign said the President was going to change his tone and limit his tweeting in order to improve his poll numbers..?
LMAO....really....you have more strings than a quarter....and your cheaper.  Boy Trump must have given you something to overlook his flaws....so called Christian
Trump is a national security threat so by this logic he can intervene in any cases involving himself.
Purposely being ignorant isn’t a good look.
Watching the John Lewis tributes over the last few days I’ve heard over and over again these words “he was a good man”. And I realized how those words will never (in honesty) be uttered about Trump.
No mystery. We are going off the petro dollar. Trump controls the FED and they can’t use futures (paper contracts) to hold it down anymore.
Not too late if remove Trump now
Fauci works for NIH &amp; NIAID &amp; has since Reagan Admin. Why should or would he resign? We know what Trump is like. Fauci telling us isn't telling us squat. It's in our best interest for him to remain. We Don't want the narrative that Trump drove him out.
Trump's management team knows that everyone knows Trump is a racist. Faking giving respect to Congressman John Lewis wouldn't fool any potential voters, and would only serve to get people talking about how much of a racist he is.

I wish you people would spend even 10% of the energy you use to get worked up about Trump on critically reviewing Walz. I’d take 5%.

Trump’s Tulsa rally has its first confirmed kill. 😡🤬  Herman Cain attended. Got Covid and has died. #TrumpKilledHermanCain
Trump caused me to drive into the pool.
Wow Liz, just starting to like you then you have to make a comment about Democrats.  Republicans cheat too....just like tRump did in the last election.  Clean up your own effing house before you start knocking on someone else's door!
I’d say delay on the basis that I want to be more sure the outcome isn’t manipulated because I think Trump will win again
Yikes 😬  But he can't do that though too, congress should and will definitely not do this.  But in other context, Trump will throw anything as a curveball for this election. Like possibly not wanting to accept if he loses.  So get out there, and vote for Biden. Please.
You mean like your FAKE words how We've got the virus under control"?  Trump you're so mixed up in the head it's scary to think you're the President....I'll never vote for you unless it's putting you in JAIL or an INSANE ASYLUM because either works for the WORLD

Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
When Trump realizes this is not North Korea and he can’t delay the election he drops out. You read it here first.
Of course not, what an idiot that "President" Trump is.
Garbage like this is why Trump will be re-elected.

Well what do you think will happen when DEMS refuse to open their states? Don’t blame Trump. States that are open are doing great.

Donald Trump just needs to go.  Dude needs to obey some rules of the United States.  I know it is hard for him.  But you can't be there longer than 4 years my dude.
What kind of reasoning is this if trump postpone the November elections millions of Americans will descend on dc
Secret service already has a plan to forcibly remove trump on January 21st 2021. Following the constitution he will be removed no matter what
Lol, Trump is a genius, he just doesn't lose!
There’s still time for Trump to drop out and avoid his ultimate fear in life of officially being labeled a loser in the annals of history.
Trump has finally done something no other president has ever done.  No one has seen numbers like this. The best ever.  I know this isn't totally his fault, but can't resist using his own type words back at him.
I don’t foresee myself trusting a Trump-touted vaccine.  I’d rather stay in my house until 2021.
They literally will do ANYTHING to prevent Trump from being re-elected.  Of course it works-doctors everywhere continue to prescribe and it’s efficacy has been confirmed in a peer reviewed study.
The chilling thing about Seattle and Portland is not Pres Trump but the mayors &amp; governors who allow these protests to get out of hand. Seattle Mayor didn’t do a damn thing until they went for her home!  she still hasn’t said anything about the young black man killed by CHOP!
I’ve seen several ways to countdown to Election Day. My choice is Trump driving the dump truck with McConnell, Limmer, and Gazelka closer and closer to the trash heap each day :) #BlueWave2020 #TakeOutTheTrash #MNDFL #DumpTrump2020

I hear that, I’m getting it from both boys in my life since suddenly my 14 year-old son, who was ready to move to Canada with me when Trump won, now thinks he’s the shit. I don’t think they even comprehend what the narcissistic bigot is doing to our country!!
Troops being sent to Cleveland, Milwaukee &amp; Detroit.  Maybe I missed the news about those cities being ripped to shreds.  Trump will be inciting riots, not quashing them.  wtf can we do?
I have received the registration forms to mail in my ballot, but I can’t do it. I will worry that somehow my vote against Trump won’t count: I will do something wrong, not mark something completely, it will get lost or show up too late...So in-person works for me!
As soon as trump is gone, he will become an even bigger security risk to the US, if that’s even possible. We need someone to keep an eye on him, unless the dept of corrections does the job.

I just have to say how much I appreciate your willingness to speak truth to power. Spot on... as now trump is pulling troops from Germany. A Putin bucket list item.
Your daily reminder that if you vote for Donald Trump you are a racist.
Not if your cause is to promote violence to justify sending in illegal unidentified "troops". Trump is really good at staging his narrative. It's all fascist showmanship.
Gullibility is not for me even if it comes from a pretty face. It’s akin to all the shit that Trump doles out on daily basis and then say one sane thing and US media go nuts with plaudits that he start looking presidential. Hamza is what he claim he is so I believe him - a bigot
Bless you President Trump🙏
We're around, but American women want Beta males. Trump has the right idea.
I once pushed this hard on Rich Kinder, the blow-hard CEO of Enron at the time.  Much like this reporter, I was well prepared and did not get distracted by all the dust he tried to kick up into the air.  Kinder ended up screaming at me, his face beet-red. Trump got pretty close.
OMG... Trump supposedly doesn't drink, but he always sounds drunk.
The fact that, after everything (corruption, convictions, impeachment, over 4 million covid cases, From Russia with Love, blatant nepotism, etc) Trump still has a chance speaks volumes for the both sides are equal narrative and right wing media.

Dr. Stella Immanuel the celebrity dreaming impregnating Dr.  Trump "I'm a big fan of hydroxychloroquine, I thought she was impressive, but I know nothing about her." You thought she was impressive cause she agrees with you. Where's your medical credentials Trump?
Trump said he didn't know anything about the Dr (Stella Immanuel) he just liked what she said about hydroxychloroquine. Exactly, makes him look right.  FDA, CDC, NIH, Unniv. of MN, all said it doesn't work, but he'd would Wrong.  EGO..let's believe the Witch Dr.
Trumps female doctor he believes and takes advice on about hydroxychloroquine has said  women can get pregnant by witches in their dreams by astral sex.  Dr. Stella Immanuel...she's a FRAUD.  Doesn't want to believe Dr. Fauci...because he contradicts Dr. Trump.
Trump is a puke

your a disgrace, you should'nt be trusted with children's safety.  Even suggesting children don't catch/transmit COVID is a flat out LIE.  Your not a doctor with the CDC...you aren't listening to Dr.s...unless Trump is now a Dr.  Your a shame to educational health
OMG, so a Trump supporter who knows Bible verses. Does the President?  Let me guess he's being taught one for a press conference today.    I suggest domething from Genesis and the Serpent.  He'll probably want to reference himself as great as GOD though since Lincolns  been used.
Remember yesterday when the Trump campaign said the President was going to change his tone and limit his tweeting in order to improve his poll numbers..?

Yes, both sides have rude inconsiderate people. I would argue it's hard to find a Trump supporter that isn't, but not always the same the other way.  I'm just saying in no context is it ok to be a Nazi, and it's not justifiable.
I agree 100%.  Polling doesn't mean a thing in the Trump era...  "Oh, I'd never vote for Trump" and then in the privacy of the booth put the check next to Trump.
He's signing off. It's his resignation letter. The first part probably reads: "You all are idiots. I made a $hi+ load of money as president. I'm out." Good bless, President Trump

If we have to wear masks to protect every single solitary person from catching a very curable virus then we best make sure that there isn’t one single solitary instance of voter fraud!  Trump is correct but the Dems think “some” cheating is ok?  No.
Why would those people be so dumb?   So now the media and liberal left act like that’s how conservatives act?   Screw that.   Such crap.  I work with a lot of farmers in southern MN and I can tell you with about 99% certainty they will vote to re-elect Trump.

How about you give your opinion on his attempt to seed the ground to stop the election? You won’t. You and those like you are so far gone that there is literally nothing trump can say or do that would make you say anything about it.
This is how fucking incompetent Trump is. Even if there is no election his. Term. Still. Ends.  The only hard deadline spelled out in the Constitution is the end of a president’s term and a vice president’s term on January 20 of the year following a general election.
O MY GOD YOU ARE NUTS trump! LOL
If you happen to see the Trump tweet about delaying the election.  Report it.  Twitter has an option to report tweets that are harmful to the election and/or mean to suppress voting. ~my dope english teacher with a priv acct so i cant retweet from him directly.
tRump.
Sadly a lot of liberals I know think all the evil shit he does is a conspiracy theory and they all believe dr fraudchi and gates smh they don’t trust hydroxy and they blame trump when he sends in feds it’s insane how brainwashed people are it’s hard to even talk to them
I didn’t blame it on trump i blame it on someone who didn’t take the virus seriously and it cost him his life. Trump supporter or not.
Trump  John Lewis funereal is today why didn't you go?
trump is one sick  puppy!:
Trump wants to delay elections but open schools? How does that make sense?
No. No no no no. Goddammmit. This is so wrong, everything about this is wrong. DeJoy is Trump's lackey and they are running with Plan B.
96 days left. Trump wants to delay the election. Contact your representatives and senators and let them know this should NOT happen.
What the fellow from Utah fails to grasp is that the election would not be 'rolled out nationally' - each location would have their own local election. So if Utah can do it, any place can do it. And this article fails to mention the zinger - TRUMP VOTES BY MAIL! Safer that way.
Herman Cain, RIP. His death sits squarely on Trump’s shoulders.
And there it is. Dictator TRUMP. You are going down this November. I hope you have to be dragged out of office. 150,000 dead, millions unemployed, no consistent leadership, and an economy in the tank. How much more winning can we take? None under your watch hopefully.
This op ed by Stuart Stevens really hits home.
Trump your full of S*IT!
I can’t wait until Russia releases the audio tapes of the Trump meetings and phone calls. They have all their “confidential conversations” recorded.
This who were not going to support and then suddenly voted for Brett should bow their head in shame. They have perverted the rules in every case to allow Trump to have his way.
Bullshit. Trump puts Trump first. He does not give a rats ass about America or the people in our country. Big fat Narcissistic fascist Hitler wanna be pig. Worst POTUS ever!
Like Women for tRump, Handicap for tRump, Minorities for tRump etc...
And hasn't repented either. tRump quote, "I don't need to ask for forgiveness."
Everyday I am thankful that there is not a Trump property anywhere near my neighborhood.
It’s never ends with this guy #Trump.
I believe you trump.
Thank you trump I was afraid everyone was gonna be forced to get gates and fauchis vaccine I hope this also applies for kids so there not forced to get it either  to attend schools
Did she get that medical degree at Trump University I'm just asking
Your boy trump runs the Dems tho 😅
Barr is nothing but your dog Trump!
He's tRump's personal Lawyer, Period.
The Republicants are still spewing Russian propaganda about Pres Obama's"spying on tRump".
Nope. I already know what he's about, the fixer for tRump and G HW Bush in the past.
Well his lips are moving. That's a dead give away with tRump and the  #Cult45
Bye bye tRumpster. Hope you open your eyes and see that tRump is screwing you and our Country over before it's to late. You lost me at your name calling, that just proves you lost the debate.
No the Republicans are the mess!! The fact that they played a photoshopped, cherry picked shots from Jim Jordan, that is BEING used by the TRUMP CAMPAIGN!! Barr can't answer any questions straight!! These Republicans are not asking questions, they are just allowing Barr to talk..
If only Black People could be racist. This trump destruction Bullshit would END immediately!!!
F_ _k donald j trump!!!
If the combination of Donald Trump and Jason Lewis on the ticket doesn't sink the Republicans across-the-board in this state, I don't know what will.
I wish tRump would STHU about things he doesn't know about (pretty much everything). I have a hard time getting my script of Hydroxychloroquine and I'm one it works on and needs it.
Right, we'll see when the Dems sweep through the Senate , build our numbers in the house and kick tRump to the curb. That'll be you! 😭😭😭
I can’t help feeling like the White House is forever tainted by Trump and his disgusting group. Kinda it should be burned to the ground and rebuilt from scratch after they get out.  I know some firemen who’d be happy to do the job if hired.
Who cares what Canadians thing. Trump is planning a Christmas invasion and before the new year they will be known as East Alaska.
I thought that they never decided on DC, MD or VA. Thought that trump just pulled the plug one day on the search. Is he trying to buy the loyalty of the FBI now?
Thank you Ivanka Trump for coming to Minnesota to open an office for the Task Force on Missing &amp; Murdered American Indians.   This bold and necessary action taken by  is a tremendous step for our Tribal Nations.
Biden is going. Trump isn’t.
They have and they are working on it but the courts take time. A stand taken immediately to push back was the only obvious action, but once again nobody wants to stand up to Trump.
Everyday brings jarring words and images and events. Today, the juxtaposition was overwhelming. As John Lewis’ body lies in state at The Capitol with crowds lining up to pay their respects, Trump hides behind layers of walls around the White House.
trump is the one friend that makes up the rules of the game as they play
Yes, but that is not the point. The point is that when that happened that goon should have immediately been arrested by the state police for assault. What happened to the goon who did it?  Not one damn thing and people look helpless again in the face of Trump.
Yes he did. And right then and there the goon who did it should have been arrested for assault. You have to fight Trump aggressively.

We have seen what happened in Florida, Arizona and Texas when the governors of those states caved to Trump. It’ll be a million times worse when people’s children start dying or end up with permanent dusabilities.  Are we going to be that stupid with our children?  HELL NO!
People need to start standing up to Trump’s illegal secret police tactics.
We knew exactly what would happen if the states opened too soon. This is about our kids!  Do not let Trump’s re-election plans get your kid killed or disabled for life.  Then you get it and you might die.  Masks!  Shelter in place.

Trump’s all bravado’s from his little bunker in the White House. Let him come out and face these protestors toe to toe.  We’ll see how tough he is then. Honestly?  Obama would have done it, faced the crowd and helped diffuse the situation. Trump will never be that man.

He should’ve ordered the arrest of the goon who pepper sprayed him for assault.This is BULLSHIT!!! I can’t get past the feeling that if anyone ever really stepped up to stop Trump in a “no holds barred, full force of the law” that he would fold like a fucking house of cards.
Why, why have the people who are supposed to protect us from the likes of Trump done nothing?  Why are they so afraid of him?  Are they worried he’ll call them a “mean name” on Twitter?  People are DYING!  STEP IT THE HELL UP!
Never mind that, where'd he get his suit, the big and tall Men's store? We already know he's a moron because he works for tRump.
But the schools should open as kids don’t get sick or transmit the virus. WAKE THE FUCK UP!  Not only can your child get sick, they could die!  Do not sacrifice your child to Trump’s I’ll-conceived plans to get himself re-elected.

Interesting Trump doesn’t hadn’t ever had Covid19.  Fauci said masks not required there are deaths across the world, the virus came from C H I N A!  Follow the paper trail people!  The people wearing masks don’t even wear them correctly or wash them after every use, touch them to
Trump is nuts!
WE WONT BE SAFE WITH YOU IN CHARGE TRUMP!
Evenything Trump touches dies.  Heard that somewhere before.
Name the democrat/liberal reporter trump has done an interview with.
Hey Congressman Nadler— if the destruction, violence, and riots caused by Antifa are a myth why did  ask the federal government for $500M?
I'm doing mail in voting because my State knows what they're doing. Unlike you God tRump.
Hah! Now that the CDC has been completely politicized and neutered, you refer people to follow their Trump-approved "guidelines". I prefer government agencies that WEREN'T captured.
Yes. Extremely dangerous... the mad that’s being sent by trump and his cohorts is very loud and very damming. It’s truly a shame the lack of care for our children.
The point of peaceful protest is to show strength in numbers. It is not about going into the streets to fight Trump’s goons. If that’s why you are going you may end up with an arrest record, Covid-19 and thousands of dollars in fines. Think, plan to stay safe.
Why the hell do people not see it?  Trump’s lies are legendary and ridiculous. Still they believe him.
Me either. Trump is such a moron and he is so transparent.
I’m having a very hard time understanding why anyone in their right mind would ever believe a word out of Trump’s mouth. It takes fives minutes to fact check him to discover what a liar and horrible businessman he really is. It’s too hard for people to think and research
Epic fail on mask policy. Its so refreshing to know people disregard your illegal policy. Never Wear a mask! President Trump 2020.  You are a SHEEP Baahh. We will turn Minnesotas Red. Minnesota Burned on your watch    BYE!
I absolutely would not send him.  I think it would be reasonable to reassess the situation in December to determine if schools can be safely be opened in the spring. We’re no where near ready. I wouldn’t let my kid die for Trump
I’m not against you.  Not at all. I don’t want Trump to kill another person, and that is exactly what is happening.  Calm the emotions- they will get you nowhere. Calm, quiet, thoughtful planning instead of in insanity where anarchists can suddenly insert themselves into a mess.
They ARE, in fact, committing crimes.  We are all seeing it in real time.  Are you the solution?  If you die today in this, the perpetrators of these bad acts will not even remember your name or care. Think smart, not fast, and be smarter, much smarter, than Trump. It isn’t hard.
Republicans n Trump supporters please do not be worry about the president in this election. All we hv to do is go vote n encourage others to do the same. This country is tired of Democrats bad n scary policies and most of all Biden will not be president. Trump policies better.
I don’t consider it hiding. I consider it not playing right smack into Trump’s hands.  I can read him like a book.
I see it differently.  The idea of everyone walking away while these goons are there would keep someone else from getting killed. It’ll help with the virus.  I look at Trump and I know exactly what he wants - blood and gore on the news. I won’t budge an inch to give him that.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
What ever transpires is on trump's head and hands. Since he professes' ownership over all that is America!
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
There is almost a straight line from Regan (mostly Newt) to Palin to Trump. Regan at least had some governing experience before running for office.
Could you image De Blasio throwing the pitch. He would probably fall off the mound and hit himself in the head.   Trump threw a fastball perfectly.  Trump2020.
After those comments Trump might just get my vote.

What if Trump told Kanye to run, just so he would take away votes from Biden?
I truly get where you’re coming from, BUT here’s the thing tho, friends: Donald Trump makes life much, much harder for all of those identities listed below.   You cannot support those identities &amp; support Trump. By doing so, you’re showing where your priorities do &amp; don’t lie.
Trump was forced to do what the weak city mayor and governor wouldn’t do - restore order. Someone has to make tough decisions for the betterment of society.
Miller sold his soul when he went to work for tRump just like the rest of the slime.

#DUIMatt is as crooked tRump #CrimeSyndicate.
“Are the Russians bad”?   Trump has the speech patterns of a two-year-old.
Has Trump said in response “But we have a lot of people?”
Actually the courts have done a good job of shutting Trump down on a regular basis.  Of course, if only Congress would do what they are supposed to do. If they had just impeached him this might not be happening.
Yes.  The Trump administration has had several lawsuits filed against them over this (ACLU, House Democrats). What Trump is doing is illegal and may meet the definition of criminal behavior.  We’ll see.
Yep.  The women’s march the day after Trump went into office comes to mind. I’m just waiting to see if the courts are going to be able to stop this.
Outside of anecdotal headlines, and misrepresentation. Can you explain and cite legitimate statistics as to how de regulation is seen as “wrecking the economy”?   As for Deaths? I don’t believe Trump was putting covid patients in senior care centers.
I’m just sick of everything.  Sick of being confined to this house, sick of watching as thousands of people die, sick of hearing Trump’s lies, which grow more absurd by the day. I want to go outside and scream at the sky. Can’t. Cougar and bears everywhere the last few days.
Well,that's probably what Putin and he have been talking about. Today, earlier this week and last week!!I'm sure PUTIN'S giving TRUMP tips on how to take over the Country! What they didn't talk about??The bounty PUTIN PUT ON OUR SOLDIERS??ESPECIALLY, THE ONES WHO ALREADY DIED!!🇺🇲
And now this makes sense
Ha ha. You mean Trump has good days? He's not the brightest light bulb on the block. In fact, I think he burned out a long time ago.
Exactly. And yet, Trump continues to say this , knowing full well what a lie it is.
The following quote by Trump is a lie. The question about spying on his campaign was investigated and debunked.  There was no spying by these people on his campaign. #TrumpPlague
Trump has how many kids with how many women?
As Trump said, let the money follow the student. Otherwise you’ve removed all doubt that it’s about anything BUT the kids
There’s absolutely no doubt that the media is biased against Trump.
I plan on voting for Donald Trump in November. I will never ever vote for another Democrat again.
Trump’s failed law and order message doesn’t work in Minnesota. You can’t have law and order without justice.

Yeah I remember that meeting well. That's the one trump publicly chose Russian Intelligence over Our Own. Which under other Presidents was considered the Best in the World. Yet, under trump by trump second fiddle behind Putin's own!
Love TRUMP!!!!
Great decision. Really a no brainer. Fuck Trump. Protect against Covid-19.
We cannot expect trump to speak out on the abuse of a veteran when he won’t speak out on Russian bounties on Active Duty
Fitting that the energy company flew this gangster and his son to Trump's inauguration in their private jet.
My husband hears me swearing loudly and yelling "WHAT AN ASSHOLE!!"  Randy - "Trump's on again, isn't he?"  Me - "Yep."

😂😂😆😆 Trump does ONLY what is good for TRUMP!! He always pretends to make a buck!! This was only about using someone's money for his own profits!! HE'S A RACIST...FACT!! That's why they had to pay a hefty fine, because he refused to rent to blacks or minorities!!

Trump better hope he doesn't win. If the democrats takeover the house and senate. He'll definitely be thrown out of office and prosecuted for crimes beyond his wildest dreams! Resign Trump before it's too late! ROME IS BURNING!!
Honestly pathetic with the way your party is trying to muddy the waters with baseless lies about voter fraud. You all know Trump is going to get embarrassed and have to have your excuses ready.
Con Man and the republican party. Trump.  Hates America! Our voting system isn't good enough for this elitist asshole! He's trying to destroy the one thing that make America a democracy and that's voting! Putin is his master!
This Trump 101, the media will try to corner every republican to defend his statement, and they will spend that air time trashing mail in voting.
Herman Cain.  Dead bc the Trump administration.  Irresponsibility to protect him from covid19! 155tho Americans dead bc of Trump Irresponsibility to protect them! Trump must testify and be held accountable!
Trump.  Is conning the American people with his voter fraud escape. The president of the United States is a fraud! He is extremely unfit to be president! He continually misleading the American people. He need to be brought up on charges now!
Trump can actually talk? Ummm... okay. But how much of it is intelligent?
And we disagree because as much as we peacefully disagree, I will never be able to get you to admit to a fact because of your dislike of Obama and u won’t condemn Trump because of your support for him. My full point
It just really gets to me that if Obama or someone like that says something along these lines, it’s considered a blatant lie but if Trump says something like this he’s either baiting us or he doesn’t mean it. There’s always always a defense for him to say whatever he wants to
The same people screaming that a  Trump rally murdered Hermain Cain, would’ve been dead silent if he’d been peacefully protesting for weeks with thousands of others 💀
Per Thomas Friedman's article in the NY Times a few days ago, any possible debate should be contingent on the release of Trump's tax returns...
I constantly defend the media, but there need to be tough questions surrounding the corrupt and complicit Trump Admin
Everyone looks absolutely miserable. Just like the whole USA having Trump as POTUS. Vote him out!
Listen all you math geniuses: Biden = Pro Democracy                Trump = Tyranny                                  In which America do you want live?
We need to replace these Republican Senators.  Without their complicity Trump would not have been able to pull off many of his stunts. A Biden victory will not bring about the change we need (immigration reform, justice reform, etc.) if McConnell is still Senate Leader.  🌊
Trump trained.
Pretty telling that republicans will back every single thing Trump says except the idea that they might have to put up with him longer by postponing the election.
Now you got Trump.  Republicans made the way for Trump, to takeover your party . Complaining about a great president. Get the republican party a monster president! Good luck praising that maniac . Trump!
Imagine going through an earthquake and then someone being like “no! Its a hoax! Dont hide under the table, run outside! Theyre trying to control us!” Thats how all the trump supporters sound.
What's The con now Don! You're trying to suppress the vote with walk in voting and mail in voting? Trump want to have it both ways. American people voting rights are in jeopardy in the hands of Trump. Like everything else! GOLF ANYONE!!

Garrett, you persisted in making Sen Tillis take a public stance on the Trump comments about delaying elections. Often Republicans want to hide behind, “The statement speaks for itself” or more cowardly “l haven’t read the comments.” Thank you for a job well done.
Trump is playing you, America. He knows his outrageous election comment will command the conversation when we should all be talking about the GDP taking a NOSEDIVE by 33%!!! Stop falling for his misdirection tactics! #USGDP
It will be a great embarrassment to the United States if Trump is re-elected!
Donald Trump got Herman Cain killed. Pass it on.
Why are you changing the subject we are discussing and doing “whataboutism”. The fact is, he was high risk, and, at the time, Trump was anti masks. Herman Cain would probably be alive today had he wore a mask.
I'm sorry for his family-They don't deserve this. BUT Cain attended Trump's stupid ass rally in Tulsa last month and was diagnosed with it a week later. I don't feel bad for people who associate themselves with others who claim it isn't a real problem, further spreading the virus
Trump again leaning into fascism. There is no indication that voter fraud is prominent amongst mail in voting and his attempt to disassociate absentee voting from mail voting is beyond stupid. Absentee voting IS mail-in voting.
Imagine being a black multimillionaire who doesn’t need anything from Trump yet gives his life to attend a rally for that racist.
Donald Trump's Tulsa rally just literally killed Herman Cain.
Imagine being a black multimillionaire who doesn’t need anything from Trump yet gives his life to attend a rally for that racist.

Absolutely not; Trump has lead us into this unsafe environment and needs to live with the consequences.

Our bases in Germany serve as a good stop over from the Middle East. Medical facilities, etc. We have had a mutually beneficial relationship for years. Trump is threatened by Angela Merkle. Don't rush. Chances are good our next president will reverse this shot in the foot!
There it is. Trump calling for the election to be delayed. I'm surprised it took him this long.
Trump: Absentee Voting is good because that's what Trump does from his golf cart. Mail In Voting (same freaking thing) is bad because more people will vote and Trump will lose.   Far right nationalist racists become Fascists when they threaten our system of government.
Absolutely not!  #4NoTrump  BBC News - Trump calls for delay to 2020 US election
Please stop President Trump, be a leader that we need.  Jesus loves you❣️
Ok America.  How many more people have to die, before Trump supporters realize that Trump is unfit to be president? ROME IS BURNING!!
There are people who so dislike liberals that they'll vote for any crazy fool (or any crazy cause) if it upsets us.  They just like to drive us nuts even if it's to their own detriment.  The more we dislike Trump, the more his followers are delighted by the effect he has on us.

Certainly hope everyone upset about Trump’s comments are willing to work for welcoming zoning practices moving forward. Neighborhoods — progress and conservative — have a poor track record of accepting different types of housing.
News flash guy... Trump is destroying this country. Experiment failed, he has got to go.
And I was beginning to like Gov. Larry Hogan...  Opinion | Can’t disavow Trump for betraying America? You’re the problem.
Are you serious? Now you are going to tell in the south that you have been actively supporting wearing masks? It wasn’t until the last few weeks those mandates started happening. In just happened in MN. And most areas were fairly onboard except trump districts
Trump has violated his oath of office so by your reasoning he should be removed.
What a despicable person. Trump only cares about the rich.
Trump administration.  Is off the chain! They're the enemy of the United States! They're beyond the deep state.  They're the deep state. ROME IS BURNING!!

Martial law in Portland, why? Who are these people Trump has hired to put the citizens of Portland under seize? Is Trump making a power grab to stop democratic cities from voting?  Portland need to figure it out what! Before Trump destroy their city.
This dude Trump. Is a JOKE! He doesn't give a shit about making American lives less stressful during these tough times. 155tho people will soon lose their lives, . Instead of meeting with hospital administrators,  Trump is meeting with oil CEOS. Selfish loser!
My god, where’s your outrage over Trump not addressing soldier bounties with Putin?
Its not harder to propogate facts then parrot lies from corrupt politicians &amp; enablers Fact check -tumps trade policies continue seriously harm US ag. -the virus was coming from Europe so trump limited only some travel from China
I honestly think we're legit looking at a situation where Trump wins narrowly but the GOP gets das boot from both chambers of Congress.  Biden and the DNC keep doing themselves no favors in a race where they literally just have to not be crooked/say dumb things but keep doin it.
America.The whole Trump presidency is bullshit! The country is becoming bullshit, bc of Trump! There's a deadly virus that killing us and all his fans can say, Trump 2020. They're so full of shit too! The whole country is in a depression and it's getting weaker not better!
Like when the travel ban on China was enforced in February and every dem immediately called trump a racist.
Trump knows he's losing so building a case of incompetent to stand for trial.  There will be trials, right?
If trump had the opposite viewpoint on the virus u would be saying the opposite
Doctor retweeted by President Trump asks Dr. Fauci for urine sample, warns of having sex with demons
America.  Have a coward in the Whitehouse. Trump have the whole country in crisis over a group of people, that's armed with cellphones, bullhorns umbrellas, and anger . He calls them antifa terrorist. Trump.  Is afraid to deal with real terrorist, like the Talaban!
Resistance, Not Trump, Needs To Learn To Accept Election Results
Attorney General Barr. Got caught showing favoritism to Trump and Roger Stone. Barr must resign and Roger Stone must go to prison immediately! This is an outrage, the justice department have become the injustice department! ROME IS BURNING!!
Kaitlan Collins.  Got Trump to run out of his boring news conference.  Good for her. Trump doesn't want to answer the hard questions, he just want to express his propaganda and lies!
America.  It's time that we all ignore Donald Trump.  His news conferences aren't worthy of our time. His misinformation is all radical propaganda  and a desperate need for attention! ROME IS BURNING!!
Ya, cuz just by naming something “anti” but then doing the thing you say you’re against is still somehow...anti.   If trump named an organization anti-lawandorder but then went on to push laws and military order, he’d still be anti law and order right?  Makes total sense
What trump says about kneeling has no effect on black lives. What matters is the polices and shit he does which so far has helped black lives in terms of record low unemployment. Wanting cops to be held accountable is fine  but surely that isn’t worth burning cities down for.
Why is better donating to Biden then trump tho. How does donating millions of dollars to Biden’s campaign help black lives. Also most of the protestors are anti police. That doesn’t help black lives either. Remember before Covid black unemployment what about all time low...
Gotta admit--Trump &amp; Company are masters at disinformation and deception. White supremacist incites riots, but #BLM gets blamed.
How could anyone do a worse job than Trump. I’d vote for Jeff before Trump in a heartbeat.
Couldn't one of the networks offer Trump a new reality show in exchange for resigning as president?
I understand perfectly. Biden isn’t perfect. He wouldn’t be my first choice, but Trump is my last choice. In 45 years in politics Biden has done less harm than Trump has in his 3.5 years. Of course all lives matter.  Nobody is saying they don’t.
Antifa.  Isn't a terriost organization.. It's all a conspiracy to undermine peaceful protest. Barr and the Trump organization need to find the real group that committing these crimes and bring them to justice! ROME IS BURNING!!
The video's are current in TRUMP'S world.  This is his fault.
This lady things all the violence is a figment of your imagination and it’s just Trump casting a spell over you #BarrHearing #TCNT
He's been driving Uber in Denver, supporting Trump, and getting divorced from Yarmouth Meg.
Trump is a national security threat so by this logic he can intervene in any cases involving himself.
Watching the John Lewis tributes over the last few days I’ve heard over and over again these words “he was a good man”. And I realized how those words will never (in honesty) be uttered about Trump.
It is hilarious that Trump's $250 (potentially $500!) stake is scrutinized but the FDA fast tracking a $3000 drug while pumping the brakes on a $11 drug when both had positive and negative studies just flies under the radar.
#TrumpIsACrybaby OMG, tRump thinks - and tweets for the world to see - that it is illegal to make fun of him on Twitter #ThePresidentIsACrybaby
Does anyone still give a shit about Trump’s tax returns? Are Trump’s withheld tax returns the biggest concern liberals have about him?
Correction Chinese Virus. The Chinese who were not sharing info on the virus started this. WHO was complicit in it taking root worldwide. So buddy, Americans are grateful to our President for acting quickly. Unfortunately Trump had really bad advise from Fauci. Fauci virus?
Trump looks like a lardass. 🤮 and, what's up with his neck? 😳
Fauci works for NIH &amp; NIAID &amp; has since Reagan Admin. Why should or would he resign? We know what Trump is like. Fauci telling us isn't telling us squat. It's in our best interest for him to remain. We Don't want the narrative that Trump drove him out.
DONALD TRUMP WON'T BE TWEETING ANYTIME SOON!
Portland police and politicians. Are letting Trump get away with hurting and terrorizing the good people of Portland.  While the police and detectives should be investigating who the real agitators are. Trump.  Is using Antifa as cover, to use force against peaceful protesters!
Trump's thugs pelted this journalist with pepper balls which cracked the plastic in his gas mask and resulted in lacerations to his eye.  If this happened in another country, we'd be calling for sanctions against the regime in power.
Both presidential and senate races in AZ are quite close.  So easy for Trump/McSally to distort what is happening in the streets.  Hope Biden and Mark Kelly have a good message to turn AZ blue in November.
Playing golf with Brett Favre.  Is a lazy way for Trump to get the confidence and votes from the Wisconsin community!! ROME IS BURNING!!

You’re preaching to the choir here, Steve. I can’t imagine you working for Trump ever! You’re the real deal. Trump and his sycophants are not. Many are just plain psychos!
Plus, the timing was so obvious. Trump is predictable in a lot of ways - his egotistical lies being the main one.
I don't want to hear pro life come out of these people's mouths...ever. If they're for Trump, people's lives mean nothing.
Trump has refused to pay many cities that he has visited for the police protection the Secret Service asked them to provide.  Some of these visits were during the 2016 campaign; others during his tenure as POTUS.  The local taxpayers have been left picking up the tab.
I thought this was the “difficult” cognitive test for Trump.
THE TRUMP POLICE.  THIS IS THE WAY TRUMP WANT POLICE TO TREAT THE CITIZENS OF THE COUNTRY!!  ROME IS BURNING!!
Once again Trump is right... Let's see if you apologize to the man.
Funny, once again Trump was right. Seems to be right about a few things.
Duluth Pack welcomes Ivanka Trump — but not Facebook blowback

And now the CDC numbers are controlled by the Trump administration. Can’t see that going wrong or anything lol
Trump cannot even pretend to be presidential. I cannot wait to #DumpTrumpInNovember
Since when am I a trump supporter tho. Certainly like him more than Hillary or Biden but that’s not saying much. Also the “neo-nazi” allegation makes u look ignorant. Also ur feed says otherwise. All American stuff
The Republican supporters doesn't care what Trump and the Republicans leadership is doing to America.  They voted for all this mayhem. But if it was a Democrat administration. They wouldn't be so ignorant! America will never be great as long there's Hypocrisy and ignorance!
Trump. Is the most protested American president in modern history! There's no way he can win re-election.
Make sure your 18-22 yr old friends and relatives register and vote.  Remind them how proud they'll be in the future to know their first vote sent Trump packing.  PS--Anyone currently 17 can register now if he/she will be 18 by Nov 3.  🌊
You need Mary Trump's book to understand this one.  Seriously.  T personally likes this, so he cannot fathom that it's a bad idea.
Sure that’s not a Trump cognitive test question?
Whenever a crime family starts turning dirt for a "project",  note the location.   Good chance this is where bodies will be hidden.  With trump's race to defeat, witnesses to his crimes and corruption will start to disappear.   It's going to be a tough Fall for his WH enablers.

If you have a time voting bidding it's understandable. Not voting, or voting for trump is like voting against america. It has to end now. Like seriously, the first  get to vote by mail. Do it. Let's end this shit now.
Who would think violence in the streets would help the party in power? (think 1968)  You're right, though,   Everything is topsy-turvy in Trump world.  Gotta get the country turned right-side-up.  Biden 2020.
I completely second that. Sadly Biden won’t be any better but morally I cannot re-elect Trump
Ivanka Trump’s visit today is a stark reminder of the administration’s willingness to destroy the BWCA and wreak environmental and economic disaster on our state. MN, it’s up to us to protect our water, our land, our people and our economy from the threat of sulfide mining.
Let's keep an eye on exactly where he'll be and what he'll be doing on Aug. 15!
Wow!   Trump is DEFINITELY going to beat Dukakis now!
Goebbels Jr. has absolutely no experience,  which is par for the course with Trump. Put him in league with Eric Prince, and this won't end well. Our country is where it is because we have unqualified corrupt people in positions of authority.
Why won't he throw out the first pitch?  Seems obvious.... Donald Trump 'too busy' to throw first baseball pitch of his Presidency
Listen to Ron.  A third-party vote is a vote for Trump.  If you feel strongly about a third-party issues (e.g., environment), or if you just aren't *enthusiastic* about the main candidates, spend the other days of the year promoting those causes.  On Election Day, vote Blue!
Carlin didn’t love liberals but he hated conservatives far more. He would have especially hated Trump. I wish he were still alive so I could hear him rip Trump apart.
Trump voter. Just discounted Bob Villa who told him not to do it.
Brett Favre is now DEAD TO ME.... ☠️#4 ( and Trump is looking Large- stress eating !?)
hosting an administration responsible for historic degradation of environmental protections - including the BWCA - was not on my 2020 bingo card. Disappointed is an understatement. #byefelicia

TRUMP.  IS PRESIDING OVER THE COUNTRY LIKE A FUCKED UP HORROR FILM! HE HAS CAUSED MORE DEATHS THAN KING KONG!
It wouldn't cost Trump an extra cent to listen to the scientists and experts.  But he won't do that.
The reason why it so hard to get covid19 under control.  Is bc Trump administration. Is full of fox news assholes, all up in his administration . They're just as incompetent as Trump.

Lawsuit will be flying all over the place when this is over! And it's all captured on film! Trump must go!
There's 150THO dead Americans from the Trump virus, and Trump is spending his time happily on the golf course.  Trump is the anti- American President. GOLF ANYONE!!
Trump IS Reagan's legacy. I can and will blame the unabashed evil of the Republican party on Ronald fucking Reagan. Reagan killed entire communities. Trump is a pristine embodiment of that legacy.
If Kirk golfs with Trump, we riot.
Be sure to engage the 18-22 cohort.  Remind them they can help send Trump packing the very first time they vote!
Trump.  Is a goddamn liar. Sending mail ballots to dogs is a bigger lie that only  morons would believe. Trump.  Is a moron for saying it. Trump. Is a real fruitcake! This country is in real trouble with Trump as president!

Trump. Was given the presidency, the way he was given everything else in his life. Now that he have to earn the presidency, he does what he always do.  Fuck it up. Trump. Has never succeeded in anything that he had to earn himself! Republicans are following a loss cause in Trump
Lost respect for  I would be embarrassed to have my picture taken with Trump.
These ignorant police are attacking people holding cell phones.  Trump is showing a ridiculous force of strength. Trump. Will go down in history as the president that turned on the American people! ROME IS BURNING!!
Steven Mnuchin. Is a bank robber! He have given more money to his rich friends and himself than any monopoly man in American history! He's thinking more ways to distribute more money to himself! Americans  should be staying at home due to the Trump virus!
145tho Americans dead. Why is Trump still sitting in the oval office? Its not the Chinese virus.  It's the Trump virus! It's not black lives matters. It's Trump lives matters. All the problems Americans are facing, is all about Donald Trump! GOLF ANYONE!!
Republicans.  Like Trump. Have ruined America with their white nationalists ideas. Trump and the Republicans have become unhinged to all the problems in the country! ROME IS BURNING!!
I agree Sarah.  They remind me of the henchman that was chasing and shooting at DiCaprio when the Titanic  was sinking. I guess that makes Trump the captain.
Rice is qualified to be VP and to be Pres. After Trump+Pompeo, someone with foreign policy expertise will be crucial to re-build ties with our allies. That said, I don't know if she's the strongest campaigner for Joe, a key role for running mate. Lots of other roles for her, tho.
There's some fox new host that are a part of Trump secret police force in Portland.  Fox News.  Is fake news Trump.  Conspiracy is becoming an American reality!
Yes!  Issues are very important to the younger voters this time.  Even if they're 17 today, as long as they'll be 18+ by election day, they can register now.  They have a chance to oust Trump the very first time they vote!  Ask them to join Team Blue. 🌊😷

So long as you love killing babies and you agree global warming (and now President Trump!) is going to kill us all in a matter of months, you can get away with everything else.  Nothing else matters to the idiots on the left.

It must feel nice to go where you want, do what you want and live like you want . When the some people of this country, is worrying where they're going to live, eat, or sleep from day to day! Trump have the day off, to golf and make millions. Doesn't seem that Trump have worries!
What do you say to a family member who doesn’t like Trump and plans to not vote bc they know their state will never go Trump?
America.  Now that it took a pandemic for people to see how horrible the health care system is in this country, what are the republicans going to do about it! Trump.  Promised the best health care ever, but haven't done nothing. While covid19 takes it toll on the whole country!
With our Electoral College system, protest votes in purple states (MI, PA, WI, etc.) for a third party helped give Trump the edge. Use the other days of the year to battle for Green Party issues, better student loans, etc., but on Election Day, vote for the best candidate. 🌊
Trump.  Wanted a fight. He's surely is getting one with the people of Portland.  Trump have fuck with the wrong non violent  protesters. They're kicking Trump ass without weapons! Trump protesters could never do that!
Obama have nothing to do with Putin.  When will the Trump administration get that through their thick heads. Trump.  Blame Obama for everything.  Except for the economy that Trump use to brag about before covid19. Now that's in the dumps .It's Obama fault! Trump is stupid!

Did I let my road rage takeover when a guy with a Trump-Pence bumper sticker dangerously cut me off? No. Did I refrain from mouthing "fuck Trump" when I later passed him? Also no.
It would be a huge mistake for the Trump administration to send federal police to Chicago. It would be wise to let the protest stay peaceful as can be!! Federal agitators please stay away!
Another liar.  Trump loves liars.
Some fox news host might be apart of Trump secret police in Portland. Scandalous!!All the more reason to not attend a rally? And to wear a mask? And to stay away fro Trump? Pendejo.

You mean the lie that was ... the "Russia" Trump election accusations turned out to be garbage and a waste of our tax dollars for investigating untruths.. but you keep lying to yourself.. whatever makes you feel better. Smh... your hilarious!
Donald Trump has refusing to take any leadership. He won't give federal funding, he won't give guidance or guidelines, he won't do his job. The states are not equipped to handle a public health crisis like this, and Trump has doomed our education system.
We didn’t call the other countries shithole countries We didn’t want that raggedy ass fence We didn’t even want trump’s stupid ass. I’m not about to let the rest of the world disrespect and shit on me or feel less than because of this fucked up goberment.
Trump tries to con at every corner &amp; fucks it up a lot. As he tries to lay groundwork for a fraudulent election just wait until he has his minions cast bogus votes for Biden &amp; either they get caught in the process or forget to challenge those votes making the landslide larger.
pls call Cornyn out for lying for Trump. No Senator should accept, cover for or support a POTUS who has lied over 20,000 times to the American people.
That’s not saying Trump has not used his pardon power for cronies, and also for others who were serving long sentences for lesser crimes. Y’all never talk about that. And I hate defending the man, but one-sided bias without acknowledging counter facts. Confirmation bias sucks.
You should go for the gold!   I don't think Trump has had a path to reelection in the Midwest for some time now, but virus disaster on top of constitutional crisis on top of criminal conspiracy and collusion that has been his presidency...it's going to be a 🌊🌊🌊🌊

He's a Trump toadie. Be very aware of him.
Any election in which Trump loses will be viewed as crooked.
Donald Trump is saying that the first election under his watch will be “inaccurate and fraudulent.” He is also setting up the United State Postal Service to achieve the frauds if he does not win.
cause covid and trump have pushed every thing else out of our brains
Btw this was just TODAY ... the federalist society? Trump supporters are dropping like flies my man 😆... He’s a frigging traitor.
"That said, the former Trump adviser heard an administration official had contacted an outside attorney to see whether Trump could halt the U.S. Postal Service from sending out mail-in ballots, citing attempted fraud or foreign interference."
I've been following you for a while, Rondell, and I just want to say: You're one of the people I'll certainly be listening to after all this Trump nightmare is over. You're talking about issues that go far deeper than Trump, and aren't predictable based on party. (John 3:8)
Well US intel briefed Trump on the bounties TWICE, even our allies were briefed, the frigging TALIBAN admitted it FCOL! They found the cashboxes in the field - that’s how this started! Also Trump’s lackey joint chiefs never denied it, only that they needed more “data.” #TRE45ON

The first chapter of my book "MAGA Seduction: Resisting Trumpism and the Debasement of the Christian Conscience" is built around Trump's reading of that poem.   First chapter is online here:
Serious question for members of the GOP: who among you is hoping Trump will deliver your eulogy?
What is your true opinion of President Trump's mention/suggestion of delaying election?
Even the  political leaders know:  #Trump's claims about the election being unsafe are LIES We had an election during a Civil War, so today is not a problem If you postpone the election, this country will explode.
No. That would be in correct. If that were the case Donald Trump would remain president. Come on man.

No, it's exactly what it was—and if you want to insist that Trump merely "exposed" that nefarious side, you've already assumed that's the case.
trump can F_ _k  up a wet dream!
Listening to Mr. Trump speak after today's memorial speeches by former Presidents Clinton, Bush, and Obama is actually depressing. It just makes me lose hope.
I've been saying that for over four years now. In 2016, the Trump campaign even met with Jesse's campaign manager et al to gain insight and advice.
But still claimed Biden’s claim that Trump would seek to delay the election was “without evidence.” So, at the time Biden made the prediction, he was wrong because it hadn’t happened yet?

It sounds like Trump is looking to set  as president. If a new president isn't elected, that's the conditional provision! 🤣
None.  I have researched our options as well as Europes options. Even the European countries are upset because Trump's actions threaten their security. Clearly they are fearful. If they panic so much over this amount, I believe we should exploit that fear for our gain.
Herman Cain Symbol of shame Died for Trump rather than in Jesus's name...  Sorry if some might find this offensive, but Mr. Cain wasn't a difference maker for others the way John Lewis was. And for those Trumpians who had hateful and ugly things to say about John Lewis, GFY
Also, point to me where Trump made a "threat". He made a comment based on recent reports indicating how easy it would be to commit voter fraud with mail-in ballots or the number which would be lost.
Was trump &amp; gop traitors attached to the rocket by chance?
Yes me too. You know it never use to me this way. They had debates, commercials and then you voted and it was over.  Now it is constant hate coming from both sides. Dems don't care about violence as along as it makes Trump look bad and then there is Trump and his character flaws.
No. He didn't deserve to die gasping for air in an induced coma, but neither did any of the other nearly 150,000 Americans.  But only a tiny handful of Cult45 went on Fox Propaganda Network &amp; spouted to  millions of partisan morons the Trump-approved anti-science bullshit. T&amp;P

We have to stand up and make Donald Trump a one term president when voting starts give rides to people to go vote. Lets get rid of want to be dictator Trump.
As a member of Congress she's coming from a place of very high privilege knowing that even another four more years of Trump will only give her more 30-second sound bites to raise money off of to help solidify her career
Of course it was a distraction and you fools in the media will run around chasing every place Trump throws the laser pointer  Why aren't you asking him what the hell about the bounties on American soldiers?
Know this: Trump, Barr and McConnell will do anything to win. Anything. Even when the election results are irrefutable, they will challenge them.   We will ultimately win but November will be uglier than anything we’ve seen these past 4 nightmarish years.   We must be ready.
He was apparently fine with everything Trump did from grabbing women by the pussy, a disaster pandemic response, throwing kids in cages  who cares about this guy says he's not going to sway one Trump voter  Don't give him any oxygen
And when evangelicals surrounded Trump as being their leader God is unleashed a plague up on this world and the United States in particular is bearing a full-on hurricane level shitstorm from it
Many political scientists &amp; pundits trying to assure us that Trump can’t postpone the election, but the real story here is that he thinks he can &amp; wants to do it. That’s plenty significant in &amp; of itself. #WeWillVote
Any Democratic elected official; ANY DEMOCRAT...A N Y would be light years better than trump...a democrat on the city council of a town of 1000 people in rural Ohio would be better than trump.
He drank the Trump Kool-Aid and died. Should be a lesson for all of you.
But what if local and state officials decide they agree with Trump?
If there's one thing I learned during the Republican defense during Trump's impeachment hearings, it's that nothing the president does is illegal, so your entire list is moot.
Few people seem to appreciate that ballot counting is typically carried out county by county, state by state.  Think there are any county officials -- in Florida, say -- that will follow Trump's orders? There's not much you can do about it, either.
(But they secretly vote for Trump)
If Trump told the brutal truth about COVID your mentor might still be alive. The president killed your friend.
Trump is so scared of Biden he doesn't even want the election to happen.
How about you give your opinion on his attempt to seed the ground to stop the election? You won’t. You and those like you are so far gone that there is literally nothing trump can say or do that would make you say anything about it.
Do you hear all those military people speaking out against Trump's call to delay the election? No? Huh.  Maybe it's time to stop supporting our troops.
He went to a trump rally with no mask. He is an educated person. We did not fail him. We are failing as a country many... But he made his choices.
Trump is a lot of things. And clever isn't one of them..
Well, nobody I knew in Minnesota felt about Ventura the way everybody I know feels about Trump. Speak now
This is how fucking incompetent Trump is. Even if there is no election his. Term. Still. Ends.  The only hard deadline spelled out in the Constitution is the end of a president’s term and a vice president’s term on January 20 of the year following a general election.
O MY GOD YOU ARE NUTS trump! LOL
It was Trump doing what he always does  He shines a laser pointer and all of the fools in the media runs to cover it while not asking him the question, what about the f****** bounties on the heads of American troops
How about if the media starts focusing on bounties that are put on the heads of American troops rather than following Trump down every rabbit hole that he digs for them  Y'all let Trump play you like a fiddle and then whine because you're not taking seriously
The voters, the voters will stop him  But the media is going to have to get over their obsession with following Trump down every rabbit hole that he digs for them  Stay frosty and focused on the issues that truly will determine Trump's electoral future
Trump and the Republican Party have had more than 6 months now to get their s*** together so our schools can reopen properly and with adequate personal protection  Y'all have not taken this seriously and now expect everyone else to fall on swords to try to save you

No, Donald Trump knows the Democratics will lie and cheat to steal the election.There are already countless examples of your party suppressing the truth so Trump doesn't get credit. Your party has proven they'll let Americans die to hide the truth. We haven't forgotten Benghzai.
If you're a republican concerned about the damage trump has done to your party, if you're an independent or simply a person who loves your country more than your party, this should give you pause before you vote for trump.  #Florida #Texas #Georgia #Ohio
Walz: “Not all schools look the same, not all parts of the state look the same”. YOU FIGURED IT OUT!! And neither do all Minnesotans! Mask should be a choice! If this tyranny doesn’t make you want to vote for President Trump, what will?
Trump’s also detracting from today’s devastating economic news, over 150,000 American deaths and his falling poll numbers.
Yes but Trump refused for a long time. And it's not nearly in the numbers Germany has taken in, which has been reported in the millions. I'm not saying these countries shouldn't step up their military spending too. They should. But after the way Trump has treated his allies..

Sorry Mr. Trump, you need to take the final exam, even though you don't have a clue, didn't study all semester, &amp; constantly disrupted class by talking over everyone else. The 'my grandmother died' story will not work this time around.
I can HARDLY wait! #WeWillVote              and not for trump
You are wrong. You have been a bad boy since your 1st golf game with Trump. Bad Lindsey. #badboylindsey
Trump doesn’t joke. He is incapable of humor. He wasn’t joking about delaying the election. And it wasn’t a mere distraction either. If he could find a way, Trump wouldn’t just delay the election - he’d cancel it.
And it's suspected he contracted covid at the Oklahoma trump rally...  😷😷😷😷
Jackass, You and #Trump are going to lose BADLY.  The Constitution sets the rules for elections. You can't claim to support the Constitution while trying to undermine the Constitution at the same time.  We held an election during the Civil War. On 11/3/20, goodbye to both of you!
He speaks highly of a Doctor that believes other Doctors are treating people with alien DNA so they forget religion. That must be the treatment Trump has been getting and it's worked!!
#Trump knows that simply. exciting the always-Trumper base isn’t going to win a normal, uncontested election. But it will inflame passions so they respond to his inevitable claim that the vote against him was “rigged.” #MNDFL #MNGOP
Could anyone be further up Trump's ass than Cornyn?
Every Republican in the country should be condemning Donald Trump’s unlawful push to delay the election.   must immediately do so too. So far, he’s proven once again to fall in line with Trump’s dangerous tactics instead of standing up for the rights of Minnesotans.
i’m ~screaming~ FUCK DONALD TRUMP ‼️‼️
Trump is the master of gaslighting. It's a joke here, it's real there, and it's a fundraising tool over there.
HELL NO!!!! 🤬 #VoteTrumpToSaveAmerica #VoteForOurLives #VoteTrumpOut2020
Trump is deeply unwell. Only a sick, sick person would do this.
Sadly a lot of liberals I know think all the evil shit he does is a conspiracy theory and they all believe dr fraudchi and gates smh they don’t trust hydroxy and they blame trump when he sends in feds it’s insane how brainwashed people are it’s hard to even talk to them
SDNY Court bars Feds from using ‘Public Charge’ rule during the #pandemic, taking action where ⁦⁦ did not. Where it applies, this is a win for immigrants who need #SNAP , medical care and other benefits to stay healthy.
Nancy Pelosi is like a gremlin who will only emerge from her cave to help Trump pass his legislative agenda or to scold him for triviality. I will hereby refer to her and corporate Dems as #PettiFoggingEnablers
Its not like he cared about him...he was a means to an end. Everyone is disposable to #Trump
He can’t because then he’d have to acknowledge his culpability in Cain’s death due to Tulsa, and Trump can’t take responsibility for anything.  His malignant narcissism won’t let him.
Trump floats election ‘delay’ amid claims of voting fraud
If trump stays in power past January 20th with no elections I hope the whole country rides in washington with weapons in hand
Today we see a contrast of two presidents: Obama eulogizes civil rights icon Rep John Lewis while Trump cowers at the idea of being held accountable at the ballot box. The choice to defeat Trump and his politics of fear will be made by the people on Nov 3.
"He was admitted on July 1, two days after being diagnosed with COVID-19. Ten days before, Cain had attended a rally for President Donald Trump in Tulsa, OK".
. Herman Cain just died from bring At that stupid Trump rally you also attended! I am sorry for your loss but face it Trump is an idiot who is killing us #COVID19 #Gopmn #wcco
A great thread. And further evidence that in the "GOP", only  has the guts to push back on Trump's idiocy.
On her podcast she has said she presents worst-case scenarios.  But also consider that if Trump violates the Constitution, and the checks and balances in place refuse to enforce it (DOJ, Senate), does a Constitutional violation actually occur?
“Never in the history of the country, through wars, depressions and the Civil War, have we ever not had a federally scheduled election on time,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).  “We’ll find a way to do that again this Nov. 3.”
Hah, apparently  made a comment about my mom and blocked me because I said he was a regressive ghoul and now I’m getting waylaid by Trump cultists ... ahh life in 2020 😆.
33%!    This is catastrophic. With mask-hoax Trump in charge, it’s going to be a while till we can reverse this contraction. Probably January
I didn’t blame it on trump i blame it on someone who didn’t take the virus seriously and it cost him his life. Trump supporter or not.
There was plenty of evidence they rigged the primary in favor of Hillary. Don't need to be a rocket scientist to discover that. I may be an echo chamber I guess but Trump is a hell of a lot more right about how to do this election than Biden. Mail in voting would be a disaster.
remembering all the commentary about how "trump hasn't gotten away with anything yet, the election will prove if he got away with it"
That's giving them way too much credit and us regular folks zero personal agency. 3 mil more of us voted for HRC. She didn't visit 3 crucial swing states and what was it, 77K folks who Trump got excited, to win the electoral college.
exactly. And they would rather have Trump win then Bernie or Tulsi.
Trump Can’t Postpone The Election, But He Can Delegitimize The Results.
States run elections, and there aren't enough states in the Trump tank for his bullshit tweets to make a difference.
No it was not u obtuse troll our intell briefed trump on it TWICE, our allies were briefed! the frigging TALIBAN admitted it! They even found cashboxes in the field FCOL (how it started), &amp; trump’s joint chiefs never DENIED IT they said they needed “more data.”😆 so yep #TRE45ON
What the fuck is Trump's endgame?
I don't wish ill on anyone or rejoice in the suffering of others. However...   downplayed COVID and pushed an anti-mask agenda. He attended the Trump rally in Tulsa about2 weeks prior to his positive test. These were HIS decisions. Decisions have consequences.
Trump is a cornered, feral rat and the sewer water is rising.Wow, an absolute must read.  #ObamaWasBetterAtEverything   I Hope This Is Not Another Lie About the Republican Party
If Trump were shoveling real shit rather than metaphorical shit, he would be in much better physical condition. #4NoTrump
It felt as if Trump wasn't engaged in combating the virus from the start because early hot spots were in Democratic parts of the country.  To read in black and white that that's *exactly* how the White House treated its countrymen is beyond comprehension. Vote Blue Nov 3. 🌊
Trump signed the bills.
Honestly pathetic with the way your party is trying to muddy the waters with baseless lies about voter fraud. You all know Trump is going to get embarrassed and have to have your excuses ready.
Trump can actually talk? Ummm... okay. But how much of it is intelligent?
The same people screaming that a  Trump rally murdered Hermain Cain, would’ve been dead silent if he’d been peacefully protesting for weeks with thousands of others 💀
Kind of like how he needed Congress to approve funds to build the wall? Trump does not believe in the Constitution or the independence of states or anything that limits his absolute power.
Per Thomas Friedman's article in the NY Times a few days ago, any possible debate should be contingent on the release of Trump's tax returns...
Everyone looks absolutely miserable. Just like the whole USA having Trump as POTUS. Vote him out!
We need to replace these Republican Senators.  Without their complicity Trump would not have been able to pull off many of his stunts. A Biden victory will not bring about the change we need (immigration reform, justice reform, etc.) if McConnell is still Senate Leader.  🌊
Trump trained.
Pretty telling that republicans will back every single thing Trump says except the idea that they might have to put up with him longer by postponing the election.

Garrett, you persisted in making Sen Tillis take a public stance on the Trump comments about delaying elections. Often Republicans want to hide behind, “The statement speaks for itself” or more cowardly “l haven’t read the comments.” Thank you for a job well done.
Does trump know that 1 of his cronies Herman Cain has died of the virus? He put him in charge of HHS at 1 time, so does he know him, does he barely know him, does he know him at all?
Trump is playing you, America. He knows his outrageous election comment will command the conversation when we should all be talking about the GDP taking a NOSEDIVE by 33%!!! Stop falling for his misdirection tactics! #USGDP
It will be a great embarrassment to the United States if Trump is re-elected!
Why are you changing the subject we are discussing and doing “whataboutism”. The fact is, he was high risk, and, at the time, Trump was anti masks. Herman Cain would probably be alive today had he wore a mask.
Trump again leaning into fascism. There is no indication that voter fraud is prominent amongst mail in voting and his attempt to disassociate absentee voting from mail voting is beyond stupid. Absentee voting IS mail-in voting.
Imagine being a black multimillionaire who doesn’t need anything from Trump yet gives his life to attend a rally for that racist.
Donald Trump's Tulsa rally just literally killed Herman Cain.
Imagine being a black multimillionaire who doesn’t need anything from Trump yet gives his life to attend a rally for that racist.

Absolutely not; Trump has lead us into this unsafe environment and needs to live with the consequences.

Funny how Delaying the Election is the only covid precaution Trump is interested in. 🤔 Values his presidency over the lives of all Americans. NO DELAY! #NoDelay End the Banana Republic.
There it is. Trump calling for the election to be delayed. I'm surprised it took him this long.
Trump: Absentee Voting is good because that's what Trump does from his golf cart. Mail In Voting (same freaking thing) is bad because more people will vote and Trump will lose.   Far right nationalist racists become Fascists when they threaten our system of government.
Absolutely not!  #4NoTrump  BBC News - Trump calls for delay to 2020 US election
Please stop President Trump, be a leader that we need.  Jesus loves you❣️
There are people who so dislike liberals that they'll vote for any crazy fool (or any crazy cause) if it upsets us.  They just like to drive us nuts even if it's to their own detriment.  The more we dislike Trump, the more his followers are delighted by the effect he has on us.

You're right. Trump is such a cancer  he has to go. Harris is the logical choice. I feel she is the best person to put up in 2024. Honestly I can't see Biden going 2 terms. If he wins, he will be one of the OLDEST inaugurated Presidents ever.

And I was beginning to like Gov. Larry Hogan...  Opinion | Can’t disavow Trump for betraying America? You’re the problem.
The fact he still, after 4 years, wets his pants when he sees a picture of Trump. Marxists are the losers in life that need the rest of us to support them and he was counting on having his ass wiped by his liberal deities. Instead he now just cries himself to sleep.
Are you serious? Now you are going to tell in the south that you have been actively supporting wearing masks? It wasn’t until the last few weeks those mandates started happening. In just happened in MN. And most areas were fairly onboard except trump districts

Ya, cuz just by naming something “anti” but then doing the thing you say you’re against is still somehow...anti.   If trump named an organization anti-lawandorder but then went on to push laws and military order, he’d still be anti law and order right?  Makes total sense
What trump says about kneeling has no effect on black lives. What matters is the polices and shit he does which so far has helped black lives in terms of record low unemployment. Wanting cops to be held accountable is fine  but surely that isn’t worth burning cities down for.
Why is better donating to Biden then trump tho. How does donating millions of dollars to Biden’s campaign help black lives. Also most of the protestors are anti police. That doesn’t help black lives either. Remember before Covid black unemployment what about all time low...
Gotta admit--Trump &amp; Company are masters at disinformation and deception. White supremacist incites riots, but #BLM gets blamed.
How could anyone do a worse job than Trump. I’d vote for Jeff before Trump in a heartbeat.
Couldn't one of the networks offer Trump a new reality show in exchange for resigning as president?
I understand perfectly. Biden isn’t perfect. He wouldn’t be my first choice, but Trump is my last choice. In 45 years in politics Biden has done less harm than Trump has in his 3.5 years. Of course all lives matter.  Nobody is saying they don’t.

Purposely being ignorant isn’t a good look.
Watching the John Lewis tributes over the last few days I’ve heard over and over again these words “he was a good man”. And I realized how those words will never (in honesty) be uttered about Trump.
It is hilarious that Trump's $250 (potentially $500!) stake is scrutinized but the FDA fast tracking a $3000 drug while pumping the brakes on a $11 drug when both had positive and negative studies just flies under the radar.

Trump has refused to pay many cities that he has visited for the police protection the Secret Service asked them to provide.  Some of these visits were during the 2016 campaign; others during his tenure as POTUS.  The local taxpayers have been left picking up the tab.

So long as you love killing babies and you agree global warming (and now President Trump!) is going to kill us all in a matter of months, you can get away with everything else.  Nothing else matters to the idiots on the left.

Why Are Liz Cheney's Neocon Allies Pretending Her Problems Are About Trump?
Everything is zero-sum for Trump and his followers.  If a Latino gets a job, some white guy must have lost his.  The fact that the two people are in different states and different industries are just details DJT can't be bothered with.  Stop the blame game. Vote Blue.  🌊
I hope that one day when we get Trump out of office that we can also bring these people accountable and into court.
What do you say to a family member who doesn’t like Trump and plans to not vote bc they know their state will never go Trump?
With our Electoral College system, protest votes in purple states (MI, PA, WI, etc.) for a third party helped give Trump the edge. Use the other days of the year to battle for Green Party issues, better student loans, etc., but on Election Day, vote for the best candidate. 🌊
LOL. Trump will say it will be a "beautiful" plan. The best insurance anyone has ever seen and people will be begging to sign up!
The media needs to call Trump out about the cost of these trips.
Someone: *tweets that Donald Trump isn't that bad*  Donald Trump: Wow!!! This is the smartest person ever!!!
This is true. Most important for trump is to keep businesses going.  Obviously, he doesn’t trust experts or for that matter anyone. He’s had a revolving door since he took office. He does tend to see everything as a conspiracy theory against him. It’s election season.
Exactly. A vote for any other candidate other than Biden, is a vote for Trump.
Trump is just a wannabe Nazi American Catastrophe Through German Eyes
Did I let my road rage takeover when a guy with a Trump-Pence bumper sticker dangerously cut me off? No. Did I refrain from mouthing "fuck Trump" when I later passed him? Also no.
Another liar.  Trump loves liars.
Why in the world would she go down with a sinking ship? She would be better off waiting until 2024. Her full support of Trump is a bad look and America will not forget.
This entire thread should be in an ad responding to  “Proud of the selfless leadership he has shown...” Trump selfless?He is the most selfish man ever, if it doesn’t benefit him he doesn’t care.What has happened to  ???
Oh come on! Seriously? Trump acts like anything outside his minions, &amp; his base are not even citizens. Do you know why we despise you so much? It's because you've embraced lies over truth. Your self interests over our country. And you have aided in the deaths of over 145k ppl!
We all just figured it was Trump in a golf cart.
Encourage folks to get registered.  Include 18-22 year-olds in your efforts.  Remind them they can help oust Trump the first time they vote--something they'll remember forever.  🌊
Crazy what the Trump era can do to the mind.  We can't quite believe that an ostensibly quiet Friday night is a good thing.
Can you imagine the faux outrage had she replied in kind? Trump culture allows name calling, threats, bullying, &amp; vindictiveness.  All those bully boys are so happy to let their inner Ahole out of It's cage. None of these guys deserve re-election.
Hypocrisy at it's worse. Will media question Herr Trump about it?
We need to get that monster McConnell out along with the fascist Trump along with Lindsey Graham along with Jim Jordan along with Tom cotton and and and!
Eric Prince has his hands in this, for sure. All these Trump minions got to get their money's worth. Anyone who believes that these guys are just duty bound Americans needs to wise up. These are gunslingers for hire.
Even people w/o outrage at what's happening in Portland, should put their mercenary minds into action &amp; realize WE are paying for this Trump political stunt. WE are paying for a lot of these side show events. Add to that the lack of goon experience &amp; it's abominable &amp; dangerous.
And relationship will get worse.  Trump knows being tough on China brings him votes.
What the actual f... Honey - THIS is Trump’s America right now. With his lawless federal forces. #DumpTrump2020

You are not my “God” by any stretch and we don’t need you taking pot shots at  at this stage for whatever reason (bitter Bernie bro? don’t know your story or particularly care). Keeping Dems united to beat Trump must be the #1 priority.
😮 Even among Trump's closest supporters, never ever heard someone claim he was "selfless."
"When citizens do not know whether they are being intimidated by governmental or nongovernmental forces, the situation is rife for the kind of escalation that fascists liked."
They're definitely in the heart of Trump country. My dad used to live out there. Reminds me, I want to drive there this fall and see if all the farms have Trump signs out, like they did in 2016.
What do you think Trump was thinking!! Hmmm
Oh yeah. No doubt Trump has had teenagers set up for him to molest and rape. Someone has a recording, Maxwell, Putin who knows. But someone's got the goods on Trump.
I agree the system is in really bad shape- personally I prefer to vote more to the left. But I can’t just sit on my hands and do nothing about Trump.

It's 2022, Biden is president. Does something.  Pundits: Can you imagine if Trump had done that ... no one still would have held him accountable.
Trump thinks a war will cause folks to rally around him, and that then he’ll sail thru to victory.  He wants chaos and then can show how great he is at stamping it out. Any Democratic-led city is a potential backdrop for his reality show. Beware of any October surprise.
Who told Trump that a good way to get Hispanic votes is hold up a can of beans and promote a single hispanic food brand?? Who told him that??? And who is changing their mind because of that??????I watched the Ingraham Angle on faux news tonight. She said drumpf is leading in most of the polls on important issues. She also said that when people are asked their opinions of trump they're afraid to say they support Trump. This is why he's behind. Pure bull crap

tRump is wrong for humans
I’d say, “How did you get Trump to come to John Lewis’s funeral?”
The unwillingness of Trump to take accountability doesn’t surprise me, although I admit I yearn for a national leader that does.  But while I saw race &amp; income, age &amp; health status as targets, the reckless abandonment of essential workers appalls &amp; shocks me. 30/
Trump abandoned command &amp; climbed off the boat with the iceberg ahead. Governors with states in trouble reluctantly dealt with reality. And racism underlies our response at every turn. 26/
I wasn’t the only one.  saw what was happening in nursing homes too. And we talked about it here. 11/
In April before there was much data I worried about the impact on vulnerable communities &amp; that Trump was picking the economy over the health of marginalized communities.  I am sad to feel right. And it’s actually worse than I thought it would be.10/
It will be the last time I make the mistake thinking Trump might care enough about people dying to take any responsibility.  The stock market &amp; his polls dictate his interest level. 8/
Trump avoided a national strategy for a state led strategy to own the libs.
It’s coming from Trump, so... certain lie.
Waiting for the Counterrevolution
YEAH, ITS ABOUT TIME THE DAMN PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR trump IN 2016 START SEEING REALITY AND WHAT A F#CKED UP JOB trump HAS DONE IN THE PAST 3 1/2 YRS.
I just heard this.. tRump wants to delay elections, But if he does speaker Pelosi becomes president on Jan 1 b/c  tRumps term ends on dec 31!!!! That's why the GOP vehemently oppose any postponement of the elections.
So, do you think the first thing Trump has been asking his staff after these COVID briefings is “Do you think I sounded Presidential enough?”
THAT VAIN ARROGANT CONCEITED EGOTISTICAL trump IS,SO IN LOVE WITH THE POWER N ATTENTION HE NOW HAS THERE IS NO WAY IN HELL WIN LOSE OR DRAW HE VOLUNTARILY LEAVES OFFICE. WHY DO YOU THINK HE BUT UP A WALL? FORMED HIS OWN PRIVATE GESTAPO/SS ARMY? FOR PROTECTION.

Did anyone cover trump’s event? MSNBC didn’t even mention it. At one point I checked FOX at one point and they were on Obama.
Don’t think anyone wanted Trump at the funeral.
He may be trying to gain their favor, but the generals are mostly in opposition to Trump. Nobody wants to work under a dictator. So, while they may act all peaches and cream with him, remember that he's still their boss; for now. You've never sucked up to a boss you hate?

Trump is a very petty small man.
Nothing wrong with what’s she’s saying - getting rid of Trump will be a constitutional crisis and unless Republicans step in to get him out, it will get very ugly.
ALL YOU WILL GET BACK IS A "trump" WHICH IS PURE BULLSHIT IGNORING WHAT YOU ASKED OR TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING COMPLETLY IRRELEVANT TO THE QUESTION YOU ASKED.
This is so sad and Trump should be held responsible
I'm sure Wisconsin's grade Senator Johnson will stand up to Trump on this issue
Don’t listen to what Trump says. He’s full of shit. He always will be. He can’t delay an election. Only congress can. Please register to vote at  and request a mail in ballot. Let’s put an end to this national nightmare and vote Trump and his goons out.

Does trump know that 1 of his cronies Herman Cain has died of the virus? He put him in charge of HHS at 1 time, so does he know him, does he barely know him, does he know him at all?
Trump also can’t have it both ways. If he sends troops out but sits in DC &amp; minimizes things, people will listen to him not his staff.  Frankly we’ve been at this too long to have confidence he will sustain any effort here.
With the largest number of deaths in 2 months yesterday, Trump has his health care team on the road in battle ground states to wave the flag that Trump is on top of the crisis.
I got publicly wasted on Snapchat and had a few family members wonder why I was so against Trump. Oh, fun times.

Can't wait to see all of the Trump 2021 bumper stickers.
Dangerous attempt to subvert democracy. Trump cares more about himself than being accountable for his dismal performance. Setting up excuses for his loss would enable claim of right to refuse to leave office. Yet, altering the calendar for his reckoning won't alter the outcome.

Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Holy shit. This dude was at a Trump rally a few days before catching it
Reminder: you didn’t stand up to trump when I mattered most and you’re partially responsible for everything that’s happened since. You had your chance to act and you failed
Based on my timeline Trump is trying to change the election date and there was an Earthquake in SoCal
I’ve never felt optimistic about the November election until today. However a call to delay is a sure sign the end of Trump is coming.

You're right. Trump is such a cancer  he has to go. Harris is the logical choice. I feel she is the best person to put up in 2024. Honestly I can't see Biden going 2 terms. If he wins, he will be one of the OLDEST inaugurated Presidents ever.

So #Trump’s defense on wacko theories of one of “America’s Frontline Doctors” (none of whom are on the frontline as far as I know, mind u) is “I know nothing abt her”. POTUS is buying into opinions from doctors he “knows nothing about”. That’s where we are. #COVID19 #coronavirus
President Donald Trump reportedly owns a stake in a company that produces hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malaria drug he has repeatedly touted as a coronavirus treatment even though his experts say there’s no strong evidence it works.

BARR,LIKE trump, IS FULL OF SHIT  CANNOT STAND LISTENING TOO EITHER OF THEM. WHY DO MANY OF YOU STILL DEFEND  STILL SUPPORT THEM? THE MOST POWERFUL PERSON IN THIS COUNTRY HIS FULL OF SHIT? THE MOST POWERFUL PERSON IN LAW ENFORCEMENT IS FULL OF SHIT? THEIR SUPPORT IS FULL OF SHIT.
IT DOESN'T MATTER  trump WINS LOSE OR DRAWS,  HE AIN'T GONNA LEAVE THE LIE HOUSE. HE IS SO DAMN VAIN, ARROGANT, CONCEITED N EGOTISTICAL N SO IN LOVE WITH THE POWER N ATTENTION HE NOW HAS HE BUILDS A WALL AROUND THE LIE HOUSE N  FORMS HIS OWN PRIVATE GESTAPO/SS ARMY TO DEFEND HIM
HE JUST PULLED A "trump" ON YOU. WHEN HE CAN'T ANSWER YOUR QUESTION HE EITHER IGNORES YOU OR STARTS BULLSHITTING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.
trump ADMINISTRATION STILL REJECT THE AMERICAN CONSTITUTION N FOLLOW THE HIGH N MIGHTY ORANGE 1. WHY AMERICA ALLOWING THIS?  A SCAM OF A IMPEACHMENT COVER-UP? REFUSING NO WITNESSES NO EVIDENCE NO FACTS TO BE,ALLOWED?  SUPPRESSING COVID16 INFO ? USING ARMED TROOPS TO END PROTEST

Barr shows himself to be first and foremost a political operative blaming Obama and the CDC for Trump’s pandemic failure. Three plus years in and it is Obama’s fault. Too much golf and lack of leadership.
IF ANYONE DESERVED CATCHING VIRUS IT'S THAT DAMN INEPT INCOMPETENT DISGUSTING  DECEITFUL DESPICABLE REPUGNANT REPULSIVE VAIN ARROGANT EGOTISTICAL CONCEITED HABITUAL LYING MASTER MANIPULATOR CON-ARTIST FRAUD  trump FOR HIS GROSS INEPT INCOMPETENT MISHANDLING OF THE COVID19 CRISIS
WHAT THE HELL DID YOU EXPECT FROM A MEMBER OF THE trump ADMINISTRATION? TRUTH N HONESTY?
Weird: "A rise in coronavirus-related deaths in a given community tends to reduce support for Republicans."
A lot of high up Dems have big money and ties to big pharma companies, so they’re invested for the vaccine to come out and generate millions/billions of $. The solution of HCQ would halt this. Also Trump said it would work, so naturally they oppose it
I’m not a fan of Trump Jr. either, but this censorship is wrong.
I’d question that poll honestly...
My sister lost her teaching job when they cut the special education programs.  I blame a lot of our collective ignorance on Regan. His mental health reforms made crime and homelessness worse. He tried to destroy labor unions. He ignored the AIDS crisis. Kind of like Trump &amp; covid
Mini-Trump talks about “my body my choice” and then immediately calls for an end to abortion. Being a hypocrite used to immediately be understood as being wrong. Now GOP morons like this wear hypocrisy as a badge of honor.
Nixon era was rough. Regan era we lost jobs &amp; almost lost our home. Trump era is like hell on earth.I watched the Ingraham Angle on faux news tonight. She said drumpf is leading in most of the polls on important issues. She also said that when people are asked their opinions of trump they're afraid to say they support Trump. This is why he's behind. Pure bull crap

Trump Fears #TheButtercreamDream
My man  does a 2020 version of Billy Joel’s “We Didn’t Start the Fire” in the middle of his pontificating about our President (and still YOUR President) Donald J. Trump wanting to delay the election, and by Gods flat Earth he’s got an opinion! #GitOffHisProperty
Sure. Let's see what 4 more years of Trump looks like. Can't wait to see the country burn down honestly.

I’d say, “How did you get Trump to come to John Lewis’s funeral?”
You had my vote until I saw your negative Ilhan-bashing ads.  I do not want a nasty-Trump-like person leading my district.  Minneapolis is better than that - Minnesota is NICE. My vote goes to Ilhan. (So does my husbands). #MeanPeopleSuck
The unwillingness of Trump to take accountability doesn’t surprise me, although I admit I yearn for a national leader that does.  But while I saw race &amp; income, age &amp; health status as targets, the reckless abandonment of essential workers appalls &amp; shocks me. 30/
Trump abandoned command &amp; climbed off the boat with the iceberg ahead. Governors with states in trouble reluctantly dealt with reality. And racism underlies our response at every turn. 26/
I wasn’t the only one.  saw what was happening in nursing homes too. And we talked about it here. 11/
In April before there was much data I worried about the impact on vulnerable communities &amp; that Trump was picking the economy over the health of marginalized communities.  I am sad to feel right. And it’s actually worse than I thought it would be.10/
It will be the last time I make the mistake thinking Trump might care enough about people dying to take any responsibility.  The stock market &amp; his polls dictate his interest level. 8/
If Trump were shoveling real shit rather than metaphorical shit, he would be in much better physical condition. #4NoTrump
I actually don’t mind Donald Trump my tweeds I just think he is divisive as all get out and doesn’t have a lot of wisdom
It’s coming from Trump, so... certain lie.
Donald Trump hasn’t had a hard day in his life. He has always had money and a supporting cast. Why would people not see that? I think trumpers do see something in him that they can relate to. The fearlessness, the ability to do what one wants. They like freedom and guns.
This might be a controversial take but I think that a lot of trumper are smarter or have more wisdom than Donald Trump who they believe in. Think about that for a second.
Waiting for the Counterrevolution
Your party's position - and silence - on Covid has been loud and clear since Trump first ignored repeated warnings from our experts, called it a hoax, failed to put together a strategy, repeatedly shifted the blame, and now whines that no one likes him. What are we missing here?
So, do you think the first thing Trump has been asking his staff after these COVID briefings is “Do you think I sounded Presidential enough?”
Your Friday Briefing
Stringing together two related, coherent thoughts is really asking a lot of Donald Trump.
Wait!  They went home?  How is Donnie going to be able to sign the health care bill he promised would happen in two weeks?  I'm crushed that Trump lied to us.  Shocked.  I'm so shocked.
I wish you people would spend even 10% of the energy you use to get worked up about Trump on critically reviewing Walz. I’d take 5%.
Trump came to MN and delayed the printing and release of Gov Ventura’s “Big Plan”. They were the big media story that day.
Trump unmasked
Trump’s Tulsa rally has its first confirmed kill. 😡🤬  Herman Cain attended. Got Covid and has died. #TrumpKilledHermanCain
Sounds like exactly what Trump did with Covid 🤔
If Trump did John Lewis's eulogy it would sound like this: why don't people love me as much as they love John Lewis?
How about denouncing Trump’s unconstitutional attempt to delay the election?  Are you concerned or troubled?
Trump is a very petty small man.
If you’re expecting one, you don’t know Trump very well.
Nothing wrong with what’s she’s saying - getting rid of Trump will be a constitutional crisis and unless Republicans step in to get him out, it will get very ugly.
Cause the stuff that Donald trump is doing is very supportive for the economy and the unemployment rates were at their all time low.(COVID messed it all up but we r starting to get back on track) he just does a lot of good stuff but the media doesn’t care about it for some reason
(Run campaign like Trump Org. So sue me!)   Trump campaign reaches $2 million in unpaid security bills just as Mike Pence rallies with cops
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.

I'm sure Wisconsin's grade Senator Johnson will stand up to Trump on this issue
Of course not, what an idiot that "President" Trump is.
It’s coming down to this attitude all over the country. Trump is drawing them out into the sunlight
Does trump know that 1 of his cronies Herman Cain has died of the virus? He put him in charge of HHS at 1 time, so does he know him, does he barely know him, does he know him at all?
Trump also can’t have it both ways. If he sends troops out but sits in DC &amp; minimizes things, people will listen to him not his staff.  Frankly we’ve been at this too long to have confidence he will sustain any effort here.
With the largest number of deaths in 2 months yesterday, Trump has his health care team on the road in battle ground states to wave the flag that Trump is on top of the crisis.
I got publicly wasted on Snapchat and had a few family members wonder why I was so against Trump. Oh, fun times.
Can't wait to see all of the Trump 2021 bumper stickers.
Dangerous attempt to subvert democracy. Trump cares more about himself than being accountable for his dismal performance. Setting up excuses for his loss would enable claim of right to refuse to leave office. Yet, altering the calendar for his reckoning won't alter the outcome.
Listening to the hourly radio broadcasts of ABC, NPR, BBC, etc all made the connection to Trump’s tweet and timing of bad economic announcement about GDP and unemployment numbers. Yay radio journalism!
Already trying to blame Trump for Herman Cain’s death. No evidence he got it here but it doesn’t stop this hate filled SOB
Another example of empty, yet dangerous, rhetoric. For those that need to hear it: Trump does not have the authority to delay the election.   Don’t let his foolishness distract us. On November 3rd, we’re voting him out.
Trump did something nice for Putin against the best interests of American security? This is my shocked face.  😒
Trump is, by nature, an opposition candidate. I’m not sure he’s even capable of thinking or acting like a true leader.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Donald Trump just needs to go.  Dude needs to obey some rules of the United States.  I know it is hard for him.  But you can't be there longer than 4 years my dude.
But Trump wants to cancel the election on 03 Nov
I’ve never felt optimistic about the November election until today. However a call to delay is a sure sign the end of Trump is coming.
Absolutely not!  #4NoTrump  BBC News - Trump calls for delay to 2020 US election
Trump has finally done something no other president has ever done.  No one has seen numbers like this. The best ever.  I know this isn't totally his fault, but can't resist using his own type words back at him.
Completely unaware.  Living in her own little world...Trump's little sycophant.  #FirstLadyComesInLast
I don’t foresee myself trusting a Trump-touted vaccine.  I’d rather stay in my house until 2021.
They literally will do ANYTHING to prevent Trump from being re-elected.  Of course it works-doctors everywhere continue to prescribe and it’s efficacy has been confirmed in a peer reviewed study.

This will continue if Trump stays in position and uses stupid Pompeo, Navarro ...
Trump is a fool or a pawn. Either way...not good.🤨
Why would a Trump hot mic video have Project Veritas’s address on it? Critical thinking people. Use it.

You’d eat a shit sandwich if Trump told you to, and you’d ask for seconds. Bon appetit!
No write-ins, no third party... unfortunately, this has to be a vote AGAINST Trump, not a vote FOR Biden in order to achieve the goal.
The salary he donates back is nothing compared to the billions he is funneling into his companies. Open your eyes, asshole! Trump and his felonious family are robbing the country blind.
You're right. Trump is such a cancer  he has to go. Harris is the logical choice. I feel she is the best person to put up in 2024. Honestly I can't see Biden going 2 terms. If he wins, he will be one of the OLDEST inaugurated Presidents ever.
You think trump pays his kids 170 million. That is senator money not west wing money
I hear that, I’m getting it from both boys in my life since suddenly my 14 year-old son, who was ready to move to Canada with me when Trump won, now thinks he’s the shit. I don’t think they even comprehend what the narcissistic bigot is doing to our country!!
Troops being sent to Cleveland, Milwaukee &amp; Detroit.  Maybe I missed the news about those cities being ripped to shreds.  Trump will be inciting riots, not quashing them.  wtf can we do?
I have received the registration forms to mail in my ballot, but I can’t do it. I will worry that somehow my vote against Trump won’t count: I will do something wrong, not mark something completely, it will get lost or show up too late...So in-person works for me!
All the people in Trump’s White House should put “seater of baseball fans” on their resumes as a cover during this period.
If you vote for Trump, you are signaling that you are OK with racism.
Certainly hope everyone upset about Trump’s comments are willing to work for welcoming zoning practices moving forward. Neighborhoods — progress and conservative — have a poor track record of accepting different types of housing.
Trump Did Not Ask Putin About Russia's Bounties on U.S. Troops
Trump is Racist. Not even pretending he’s not at this point.
Can tRump be any more obvious? Should this discusting racist be elected for another 4 years, i am outta here!
Today I came to terms I’ll probably never see my dads side of the family ever again. They all racists and trump supporters. Wild as hell
One could argue that this is Obama's biggest blunder.  If he had gone with a young(er), more ambitious VP during his 2nd term, the whole Trump debacle could have been avoided.
I just have to say how much I appreciate your willingness to speak truth to power. Spot on... as now trump is pulling troops from Germany. A Putin bucket list item.
Are you serious? Now you are going to tell in the south that you have been actively supporting wearing masks? It wasn’t until the last few weeks those mandates started happening. In just happened in MN. And most areas were fairly onboard except trump districts
Trump has violated his oath of office so by your reasoning he should be removed.
No shit! Wow is that federal or state cuz trump can pardon fed but not state right?
Trump surrendered
Your daily reminder that if you vote for Donald Trump you are a racist.
Not if your cause is to promote violence to justify sending in illegal unidentified "troops". Trump is really good at staging his narrative. It's all fascist showmanship.

I once pushed this hard on Rich Kinder, the blow-hard CEO of Enron at the time.  Much like this reporter, I was well prepared and did not get distracted by all the dust he tried to kick up into the air.  Kinder ended up screaming at me, his face beet-red. Trump got pretty close.

Trump's crazy new favorite doctor Emmanuel has said in the past that children should be whipped. She also said that some of the government is run by reptilians. Is she talking about Mitch?
This new doctor that Donald Trump likes is a sorceress
If Trump knows what he is doing, he’ll put  on the COVID task force asap.  Also, maybe  Then have them stand in the background at briefings.
So #Trump’s defense on wacko theories of one of “America’s Frontline Doctors” (none of whom are on the frontline as far as I know, mind u) is “I know nothing abt her”. POTUS is buying into opinions from doctors he “knows nothing about”. That’s where we are. #COVID19 #coronavirus
Maybe that poll is an outlier, but in most other states that Morning Consult polled Trump was doing worse.  Biden up 7 in WI for example.
According to the latest Morning Consult poll, Biden is up 3 in MN. Would be wild (and on brand for 2020) if Trump won MN but lost the election.
Won’t stop Trump from retweeting them.

Please listen to Trump today so I don’t have too!
It is the former.  One of the few times tRump drew Barr's rancor (publicly stated that tRump was making his job as AG, impossible to do) was born out of a tRump tweet. Of course he reads tRump's tweets.
How could anyone do a worse job than Trump. I’d vote for Jeff before Trump in a heartbeat.
I understand perfectly. Biden isn’t perfect. He wouldn’t be my first choice, but Trump is my last choice. In 45 years in politics Biden has done less harm than Trump has in his 3.5 years. Of course all lives matter.  Nobody is saying they don’t.
Trump campaign e-mail: "Please contribute ANY AMOUNT by 11:59 PM TONIGHT... your gift will instantly be 500%-MATCHED."  Matched by whom?  Would love to see proof of this match. Well worth someone able to look into it.
Trump is destroying the relationship with China but their vaccines are going ahead with big progress, can we get their vaccine if theirs come out earlier?!
Weird: "A rise in coronavirus-related deaths in a given community tends to reduce support for Republicans."
Remember yesterday when the Trump campaign said the President was going to change his tone and limit his tweeting in order to improve his poll numbers..?
Trump is a national security threat so by this logic he can intervene in any cases involving himself.
Watching the John Lewis tributes over the last few days I’ve heard over and over again these words “he was a good man”. And I realized how those words will never (in honesty) be uttered about Trump.

#ThePresidentIsACrybaby and #TrumpleThinSkin became top Twitter trends after Trump complained about mean Twitter trends
Trump reportedly made unexpected first pitch announcement out of irritation with Fauci
The  would prove once more that they are trying to lose to Trump.
Fauci works for NIH &amp; NIAID &amp; has since Reagan Admin. Why should or would he resign? We know what Trump is like. Fauci telling us isn't telling us squat. It's in our best interest for him to remain. We Don't want the narrative that Trump drove him out.
Trump's management team knows that everyone knows Trump is a racist. Faking giving respect to Congressman John Lewis wouldn't fool any potential voters, and would only serve to get people talking about how much of a racist he is.

No, we don’t want you to forget when Trump WAS impeached but not removed by the GOP-led Congress. Now he’s committed a bunch more impeachable offenses &amp; more than 150,000 Americans are dead.  Also, not forgotten is that student wrestlers were sexually abused and you did nothing.
