hey what‚Äôs on the spineless Twits agenda today. Looking for some conspiracy to cook up info on Biden I‚Äôm sure. We are watching
As a republican who will not vote for Trump, all I ask of a Biden VP is that it be someone who can step in when he is forced leave office early for health reasons.
Nope, joe Biden will, if he somehow gets elected just watch the country burn slowly I guess and see what you have caused, all of this chaos going on in our country right now has been done by the radical left!
Joe Biden will destroy this country, he wants to defund the police and do many other things that will destroy our economy.
So energizing tonight to connect with Democrats from across Waukesha County. Thanks, Matt    Now everyone Volunteer to Get Joe Biden elected in November! #Crucial

You were dogging Biden during the entire primary debate. Now you are ok with it. Sounds about right.
Biden called this
Yea getting worried that Biden will kick your ass...yea almost 4 years of incompetence can be seen in this country is the way the COVID devastated us and the shape the economy is in.
Susan Rice is headed to jail.  Kamala threatened all Americans who supported Trump if Biden wins, plus her past is so filthy.
It is kind of like Politico announcing Kamala Harris as Biden's running mate 4 days early.
I‚Äôll have you know I live in Wisconsin. And I did not give Biden permission to use my jock strap.
The Biden‚Äôs pay their respects to Rep. John Lewis.  #RidinWithBiden #LoudlyAndProudlyRidinWithBiden #BLM #GoodTrouble #RIPRepJohnLewis
Maybe letting unhinged lefties riot every night for two months while the rest of the country gets arrested for opening up their businesses or fined for going to church or screamed at in public by some random lunatic for not wearing a mask isn‚Äôt the way you get Biden elected.
How can HRC, Rice, Biden and BO live with themselves for this???? HOW?
One more reason, if anyone possibly could need it, to get him out of office.  We need a leader like Biden who will restore peaceful sanity to our country #NoTroopsHere
They‚Äôll TOTALLY leave you alone if you elect Biden. They totally won‚Äôt destroy your life, up to and including executing you, if you fail to hold the proper opinions.
Thanks Mozzie! Fortunately I try to help bring awareness to real issues and don‚Äôt whine constantly on every single post of Trumps.Especially when he‚Äôs done far more in his time than you‚Äôre beloved dementia riddled, pedophile Biden in over 47 years. You‚Äôd let him touch your child?
It's true as well as the DNC and Biden Campaign.  These are the people behind all of this.
Sounds like CNN retoric.  I wonder if ethan or Joe biden ever had an original thought of thier own.  Every one quick to criticize, no one with a better solution.  Lefties...
‚ÄúBiden is leading in the polls.‚Äù
That's some four dimensional chess that I don't think Biden is capable of pulling off.
He is emerging as the new Rock Star of the Republican party.  We need it, if Biden would get elected, what is happening in Portland and Chicago is how every damn city will look like. Look at SF....an utter disgrace and all run by Dems.   Destroy should be the name of their party.
Considering the valid concerns around Joe Biden‚Äôs cognitive functioning, in light of the critical position he is seeking, is it wrong  to insist that he be administered a test of his cognitive ability?
Interesting how the Left never takes any responsibility.  Go live in Portland, get an early start on how it will feel living in America if Biden gets elected.  Enjoy!The most important thing to look for in a VP is someone ready to become the next president after Biden.
You described Biden perfectlyüëå
This is why I have said journalists and pundits need to shut up about who Biden will pick. You all have made it worse! You should be saying instead "we support Biden's pick whomever he decides on".
Whoa whoa whoa....Biden is considering a running mate who is ruling out a run for POTUS? Are you kidding?
Allies say Karen Bass's reputation as a bridge-builder would make her a strong partner to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
All lies and deceit. Biden changes his story at every turn to pander to whoever he thinks might be listening. The dems are nothing but garbage and should be thrown out.
Former Vice President Joe Biden now says he supports travel bans to contain the Chinese coronavirus after all ‚Äì after he previously called the China travel ban issued by President Donald Trump in late January ‚Äúxenophobia.‚Äù  THIS MAN WILL SAY ANYTHING AND LIES ABOUT EVERYTHING
So true. The most perfect examples are in office right now and they have to be voted out! Biden Pelosi Schumer Nadler are stealing directly from us, all of us. And lining their pockets with our hard earned money. How can some not see that!!
So.. my only (and I mean only) concern is that Biden would be a one term president and then she‚Äôd be one and that could have some effects on the future of the party. OTOH, she‚Äôd probably make some good trouble in the meantime.
I mean, Lewis absolutely loved the Clintons. Nobody is perfect. But he was pretty fucking close.   Also, yeah, Biden being kinda beliefless is why I want Warren as VP. She‚Äôd be the soul of the admin. That doesn‚Äôt appear likely at the time though.
We really don‚Äôt deserve John Lewis.   Post presidency Obama has annoyed the hell out of me but he effectively boxed Biden in on some pretty major stuff today so I have to STFU now.   Bill‚Äôs legacy becomes more and more fitting as time goes on.
I don‚Äôt watch much TV. Only stream what I like. But if I ever see another Biden ad I‚Äôm gonna puke. Shouldn‚Äôt pedo Joe be in prison, along with Hunter and the rest of the family? Why is he amongst us? Put him away!!  Embezzling money laundering old bastard is acting like he‚Äôs king
I respect Biden's choice for vp whomever it is! Please stop doing the polls and placing bets!
Where was Joe? Getting a haircut or something? Hidin‚Äô Biden!
One theory: he's kinda like Biden in that he moves to the center of the Democratic Party, which means moving left in the Trump era.
You know what's funny?  Biden said he'd try this back in April. CALLED IT.
Biden will nationalize zoning rules and eliminate local controls. How do people in local towns and villages feel about that?
Trump vs. Biden: Where they stand on health, economy,¬†more
PLEASE just stop the chatter about who Biden will pick for VP! He will choose the one he feels is best for his office, and we will be happy with who ever it is!
Lol. I first thought this was a Biden rally. Was dumbfounded how he got so many attendees. After all his record is like 6 isn‚Äôt it?
We all know Russia wants trump to win. So why not have the gang of 8 just agree that anything that comes out about Joe Biden is Russian propaganda and false? Easy fix!
We should all be worried about 2020 election and how Putin will help his buddy/stooge trump win! Putin does not want to see Biden win! What back channels will they use this time now that trump has more of his cronies in top political positions?
Biden vows to fight racial inequality with economic¬†agenda
Let's not get into choosing..let Biden pick and be happy with his choice!

I don‚Äôt have cable but I stream Philo. It is so full of Biden ads this weekend he should have to pay me. It shows him with great crowds as he‚Äôs running down steps in one. These had to have been photo shopped in or something. He couldn‚Äôt draw a crowd if he handed out $100‚Äôs
Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt get to pick his own socks and underwear, let alone VP. Hell, he doesn‚Äôt even decide what he‚Äôs going to ‚Äútry‚Äù to say ü§™
Americans have a choice between two old white guys. One with 8 proven successful WH years. A name associated with public/military service Biden n sons. Lying lazy, trump-coward, draftdodger, surrounded by Felons. Wisconsin Votes
Biden is for sure a Doobie Brothers fan.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
You are so right on that. It‚Äôs way past time for Biden to resign. And Pelosi Nadler Schumer. Take a hard look at these democrat accomplishments over the last 40 plus years. Nothing. Zero. Zilch. They truly need to slink away in the middle of the night. They hate Americans anyway
That‚Äôs good. You should put Biden‚Äôs name to that. He‚Äôs admitted it. Slick Willy says ‚Äú I did not have sex with that bitch wife of mine, Chelsea isn‚Äôt mine. Just look at her‚Äù. Or he says something like that. ü§£
This is why despite thinking Biden is a pathetic excuse for a candidate it‚Äôs not a particularly difficult decision to vote for him
Say what? Kids look up to pedo Joe? You‚Äôre one sick parent! You don‚Äôt have to worry. If somehow enough cheating is done to get Biden elected he will be replaced immediately. Can‚Äôt have a 40+ years of a do nothing that now has dementia and maybe Alzheimer‚Äôs as president.
President Obama n Biden had 8 very successful years after Another GOP recession. In less than 1 term t rump has turned USA into Russia or N. Korea. Store shelves are bare. Sheesh. Can‚Äôt find sharp cheddar cheese In Wisconsin!!! t rump failed to save us from #COVID„Éº19
I appreciate George's words in his video.  They were clarifying about how to go on in these trying times. At this time I hear Joe Biden and George W. Bush walking the same path for the good of the American people. This is the way it should be!  It brings to me  some hope.I‚Äôve been thinking about this, too. Is Biden‚Äôs best move to pick someone ‚Äúsafe,‚Äù or to go for a bulldog who can throw down? I don‚Äôt know the answer.
Every thing you've posted has been in support of him.  So I should assume otherwise? You assume I support Biden because I'm anti trump.
The worst asshole next door neighbor in the world just put up a trump sign. Same with a house two doors down. Time to get out my Biden and ‚Äúbye don‚Äù signs. I knew that asshole would be a trump supporter though. They‚Äôre prob long lost cousins.

Hogan stuck those words right up your ass. We know exactly what Biden meant.
Nope,  Centrist actually.  Never voted straight ticket.  And have voted republican both locally &amp; in national elections. But research is kinda my thing.  So I research candidate's before voting. As stated,  Biden wasn't my first pick.  But can't support trump, he's vile.
Good thing we haven‚Äôt had any ambitious VP candidates on the ticket like Al Gore, John Edwards, and oh yeah, Joe Biden.
It‚Äôs funny people think Biden is actually going to winüòÇüòÇüòÇ
He was a trump supporter. I‚Äôm from Milwaukee and he had a bunch of signs he made. The worse part of it is that he was threatened often and told a reporter a week earlier, they are going to kill me out here. and sure enough. Imagine if he was a biden supporter? CNN would be on it!
You gonna cry when Biden wins?
Honestly, Biden should just be POTUS for 2/3 years and then step down for health reasons, then we get a 10 year president.
Our awesome digital team has some great new tools out to get you excited to launch Biden to victory! Check it out!
Easily Biden. Trump never had to be around non-rich people, and he's too much of a coward to bash a rich kid.
How Biden's VP pick could tip the scales in Wisconsin
Who do you want to blame Biden but he isn‚Äôt president yet. I guess that only leaves trump and fellow republicans
You miss his point. If he was a biden supporter the coverage of his death would look completely different. What does his political view matter? A black man was murdered for nothing but because he doesn‚Äôt hold the left ideology his death is just another deplorable.
According to biden he‚Äôs not black. I guess black isn‚Äôt a color but rather a political view. Sex doesn‚Äôt determine your gender and now your skin color doesn‚Äôt determine your color.
November 2020 election is not about Joe Biden ,one of these women will be the next President of the United States if the voters vote for Biden....FACT

Joe Biden pedo ass thot he was doin sum w that commercial of him surrounded by blk folks and in blk spaces. STOP USING BLK PPL TO PROMOTE YALL USE US OUR CULTURE AND OUR BODIES ENUF. Literally all of the presidential candidates including kanye are sick .
Yeah 3rd party can‚Äôt gain enough traction yet. Biden needs to be a 4 year stop gap.
It literally makes me sick to my stomach. People need to be locked up including Obama, Clinton‚Äôs, Romney, Biden etc etc etc
When the announcement gets made, people will chill out. Folks who pout and stomp on their way out weren‚Äôt serious about Biden and the Dems anyway, just like the Bernie types who‚Äôve done the same. The heat now is generated by people thinking they can influence the decision.
In today's op-ed in ‚ÄúThe American Prospect,‚Äù James Roosevelt, Jr., and June Hopkins‚Äîgrandchildren of FDR + Eleanor Roosevelt and Harry Hopkins, who ran the WPA‚Äîurge Joe Biden to be even bolder than FDR:    The unemployed "want‚Ää, need‚Ää, and‚Ää deserve jobs."

I don‚Äôt disagree - if nothing else, let‚Äôs see if we survive this year‚Äôs election intact before we worry about the next one - but I think Biden has already said he wouldn‚Äôt run for a second term.
Biden is moderate and bows to corporations just like Trump. Biden definitely isn‚Äôt socialist lol

Nope, just making so little that if I didn't absolutely need healthcare I wouldn't get it. Yes, the ACA is better than without, but that doesn't make it good - that just makes it slightly less shit. Biden is condemning tens of thousands a year to death.

Maybe, but the downside is that Biden being in will also make a lot of libs go back to brunch and not paying attention, so in 2024 we get a competent fascist running from the right.
And you think Biden will put anyone good on SCOTUS? McConnell will tell him to appoint someone to the right of Hitler or there won't be a vote, and Biden will gladly find someone who fits that. His record on scotus justices is ATROCIOUS.
Literally no one can say that, because that's a stupid statement. I don't know if I'd survive 4 years of Biden, either. I'm trans and without healthcare I'll be dead, and neither of them are for the obvious system to get people like me healthcare.

Looking forward to reading your tweeted apology to Vice President Biden.
Gosh, I hope that means he'll stop the stupid ones in WI where they say Biden is for de-funding the police. They are almost laughable... "911 due to crime and funding we can't answer your call" Ignorant as f**k. Annoying when they play them back to back. Who falls for this?
Biden's entire platform is just pointing at Trump and saying "I won't do that"
Look around the country Ronna. This isn‚Äôt Biden‚Äôs mess. This all belongs to your dear racist leader.
Because that's what the Trump Administration has been from Day One. A hostile foreign incursion into our nation. President Elect Biden won't be taking over for an American President. He will be evicting an enemy asset from Barack Obama's chair.
So you're saying you're voting for Trump?! Because Biden can barely speak English. Never mind complete sentences.
I should of said if Biden was having a rally haha
He's just an angry liberal, if Herman Cain Died going to a democratic or Biden's rally, you would hear nothing from them and wouldnt blame Biden. Its funny how easy it is for them to blame the fault always on the same person. When this guy knows in reality it was Herman's choice

Joe Biden and Obama were the ones who started locking children up and cages and separating them from their parents. Trump is just following a continuation of Joe Biden's and Obama's policies. Look at Obama's, Bush's, Biden's and Trump's, policies there's not much difference.

You can‚Äôt delay voting you don‚Äôt have the power to do so. You want school to open in the fall and us to send our kids to school, but it‚Äôs unsafe to vote because of the pandemic. As a Dynamic/Progressive Conservative my vote is going to Joe Biden
Biden‚Äôs vice presidential pick will be nominated Aug. 19 and is scheduled to address the mainly virtual gathering.
I HIGHLY recommend that. Also, Biden is the one up for presidency. AOC also believes in legal marijuana and Biden does not. They all still have different views in some situations. Look at Biden, the person who‚Äôs up for election. If you‚Äôre just looking at Dems as a whole...
Guess you missed the part where they stated they would actively work against the GOP in Congress after Biden wins. üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Well, Joe Biden is actually all for law enforcement and wants to fund them more, you‚Äôre completely wrong about late term abortions and it‚Äôs extremely false, illegal immigration isn‚Äôt cool but we still treat them like human beings because they are.
It‚Äôs the problem with two party system. Voting for lesser two evils, plus party nomination is always rigged. Biden a fucking idiot. No one progressive enough. Bernie only person spent lifetime genuinely trying to help people. Ocasio-Cortez will be pres one day and i can‚Äôt wait

Biden, under Trump attack, casts himself as firm on China | TheHill
Funny, isn't it? How trolls like Mike Caputo, Sam Nunberg and Jerome Corsi could get on MSNBC any time, but Elizabeth Warren had to fight for air time? Biden makes a slip of the tongue and it's front page, ans no pool reporters ask Trump about bounties? Like that?
The Democrats would openly engage Bernie as the enemy if he runs as an Independent. They will not only NOT replace Biden with him but they'll calcify their stance against Bernie in the meantime. This strategy will not work because they're not super afraid to lose.

You have to imagine all 200 or so K-Hivers that helped her reach zero delegates in the primaries are conducting the Zoom circle jerk of a lifetime over the hints that their favorite Mnuchin freeing Cop is going to get a chance at VP and President once Biden dies in next 4 years
Yes, all in swing states. Funny how that works. I‚Äôm sure there will be lots of video for new ads about the dystopian world of the Biden Presidency, made from actual footage from the Trump Presidency.
Admirable person but VP candidate? No experience as an elected official? Limited administrative experience? Will she help win swing states? Definitely should have some major  role in Biden government

Arrived USA never had an octogenarian serving as President. Joe Biden will be an octogenarian in two years. Joe Biden has dementia or Alzheimer's it's one of the two. As a result his functional brain is 1/4 and size of normal.
Veru Old Joe Biden has no recollection of Tyler Reed and denies it on 100%. The reason for that is Joe Biden as either Dementia or Alzheimer's and he can't recall. Joe Biden's ability to recall has been severely hampered.  Biden's DOB 11/20/1942 Biden soon to be an octogenarian.

"Joe Biden's gonna lose" Theme Song  (NEW)
AIRHEAD JOE BIDEN says: "Make sure your Record Player is on at night".  That's DEMENTIA Joe for you. Joe can be the president of a Railroad. A model Railroad in his Delaware basement cellar. Name it The Delaware Biden DEMENTIA Express.
Puppet Joe Biden is a manipulated fool. Joe Biden's puppeteers have him under full control. If by chance Joe AIRHEAD Biden wins there will be no room for the VP. Joe Biden's puppeteers will not relinquish control to some dippy VP.  Joe Biden's puppeteers will control the USA.
And because then the world would have seen that he is a fat old man with movement issues. Too bad. That one photo op could have gotten Biden elected.
Maybe do some research on Joe Biden and rethink that statement. Don‚Äôt ‚ÄúHollywood‚Äù Joe Biden‚Äôs story.
Only the twisted foolish ignorant minds of the lefties blame an American for this virus. It happened in China and the Chinese Communist party is responsible only. Trump was criticized by Biden for his China travel blockade. But you shyster lefties don't care. Worse with Biden.
I'm to the point, and I really can't believe I"m saying this....but I want the cops to do nothing! In fact, in these Democratic cities, with their airhead leaders, I want them out of there!  Let the cities burn.  If Biden wins, it will all stop.  sad.   The Dems are crazy.
Most important? Yet your gonna vote for a person who helps China and molests people and kids on stage! Not to mention is showing clear signs of "dementia"! If everything is so bad, why vote for Biden who has been in politics forever yet nothing good has come of it! REELECTED T
I'm just gonna say this once: if Joe Biden doesn't address the 13th Amendment in his first 100 days, I'll chalk his presidency up to a failure.   This shouldn't be this hard.

Considering the valid concerns around Joe Biden‚Äôs cognitive functioning, in light of the critical position he is seeking, is it wrong  to insist that he be administered a test of his cognitive ability?
Joe Biden the scarecrow needs to have a brain.
Joe Biden's handlers control Biden. Biden is their puppet and they are the puppeteers. If Biden should happen to win those puppeteers won't want to relinquish that power of control over puppet Biden. That's why the VP will only stay a VP as long as possible. The Power is key.
Did airhead. Joe Biden has lost it. Joe Biden has dementia or Alzheimer's. Or combination of the two. Joe Biden always depends on teleprompters or a earphone in his ear with messages telling him what to say. Joe Biden is incapable of being president of anything. Joe is a has-been
Please note - what you have video of there, is Trumps America, right now.  Not some speculative work about Biden's potential future.  Trump is making this happen.
Biden has literal dementia and we‚Äôre talking about trumps mental state?

Maybe wishful thinking. Has anyone considered the speech Biden would give at inauguration? ‚ÄúOk America, first thing let‚Äôs stop being racist....like that guy.‚Äù I thought Obama calling out Bush in 2008 was uncomfortable. Trump probably won‚Äôt attend just for this reason. Yay?
"Doesn't want his job". Since there is almost zero chance Biden serves a second term shouldn't he be concerned with picking his successor?
Best move Biden could make is promise to not use Twitter. Let Press Secretary do their job and communicate to the country.

Hey Nate, does it seem like the Biden campaign is being smarter than the Clinton campaign was regarding these kinds of tactical moves? Seems that way to me
Lots of Obama-Trump voters in Youngstown and Toledo. Biden is probably already doing well with voters in the three Cs and this might be a test run to see if they can persuade enough voters in the mid sized cities to flip Ohio back

Just imagine what the media would do if the they caught the Trump Administration doing the same thing to the Biden campaign  today.
Joe Biden speaks the truth! My learned opinion that we should all ignore Trump's involvement in our health treatments. If everyone does not see by now that Trump cares less about human lives. No matter your skin color! Being caucasian will not save you!

Im torn. Part of me wants Trump to win to get back at those khivers for the way that they treated us on the left and the other part of me wants Biden to win to get back at those right wing nuts who claim he is a socialist just so they can suffer having a fake 'socialist' as prez.

If the electoral college decides Joe Biden is the winner and he is sworn in as president, then yes, the Secret Service would make Trump leave. Its what they‚Äôre assigned to do, and there really doesn‚Äôt seem to be any benefit for them to not follow the law on this.
Exactly why Joe Biden must be POTUS, Joe will organize US back to a livable nation. Trump's actually killing us, no jobs, no allies, no incomes, now his gestapo type troops are snatching people off the streets. Trump's plans to take control of US cities will not be tolerated.üá∫üá∏

Lol this is so pathetic.  Again, Clinton is not involved in this conversation. You have shown 0 proof that Biden is a pedophile.  Trump admitted it on TV. But keep beating that fake drum
If Joe Biden told everyone on national TV that he frequently met with a child sex trafficker and wished her well, then I'd probably be pretty alarmed

Donald Trump says Joe Biden wants to abolish the suburbs. But polls show a different truth: The suburbs want to abolish Donald Trump.  If current numbers hold, the Republican Party will suffer its worst defeat in the suburbs in decades

Never underestimate the shallow stupidity of youth:  "Among respondents under age 30, 44 percent said business leaders who donate to Donald Trump should be fired and 27 percent saying the same for execs who give to Joe Biden."
You know this is going to be a scary year Not scarier than you imagine But scarier than you can imagine  You may not Iike Biden, you don‚Äôt have to.  You do have to vote Blue from top to bottom to get rid of this cancer so we can heal!
Biden would do better.  He won‚Äôt repeat stuff to aboid answering questions
I was thinking about that today when I saw Biden and Obama‚Äôs video. I wondered if Obama would write a note for Biden when he steps into the White House....because you know Trump won‚Äôt write the traditional note to his successor. Biden will also be the one to hang Obama‚Äôs portrait
Oh I thought that was a poll with Biden leading üòÇüòÇüòÇ
At last! A new Minnesota poll. MN was close in 2016  ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs advantage ...comes mainly from women (+26 points), Whites with a college degree (+25), seniors (+18), and suburban voters (+12). Trump‚Äôs up by 4 points among men and by 2 points among Whites without a college degree.‚Äù
Obama/Biden got TWO TERMS! They brought us out of a global financial meltdown and delivered you a strong economy that you crashed with your incompetent handling of the global pandemic! After 6 months still no national plan to contain the pandemic!
It's a great day, let's just push him aside like the inconsequential creep here is and just proceed like Biden is already POTUS,  he can't stand being sidelined. #TrumpFailedAmerica
Wisconsin here, no tRump, but manny Biden 2020 in farm country.‚Äºüåäüåäüåä
I would vote for Biden if I had to walk on hot coals or crawl on broken glass!
What can you tell me that will help? I just can't get enthusiastic about Joe Biden s presidency.Originally I wanted a Biden/Bernie ticket. Knowing that that won‚Äôt happen I would prefer a Biden/Warren ticket.
Joe Biden is a sorry excuse for a man. He is hiding in his basement reading a few words his handlers let him and sending out what he is going to do that he has not done in 45 years. He is a fake and AOC is playing him like a drum.
Biden: elephant, rhino, girrrrayephaef!  You know, the thing!
Vote for Biden, or else, the left says.
Polls,  where if I would be asked,  I'd say Biden, but vote Trump, just so I could watch the reaction when Trump wins again.Only for Biden will I say yes
And what you guys are holding people in democrat run cities jobs hostage? Wont let them go back to work till they vote biden or vote you out. I cant wait till your party is only in history books.
It will take years Biden will stop it!
Politicians shouldnt be allowed to decide what you treat chinas bio weapon with. Niether should we be beholden to a politicised agency like the cdc to shutter a business. If they are dumb enough to support joe biden and the dems, i dont think they are capable of making decisions.
If trump has more enthusiasm and you claim Biden has none . Biden is the silent majority
I saw my first presidential commercial just Friday. I live in a very small town in Illinois. It was a Joe Biden ad  üôÇ
If Biden dies in office, VP choice is crucial.
I would not leave me child with joe biden.
I saw my first Presidential commercial last night. I live in a very small town in Illinois.  It was a Biden ad. And I LOVED it  #GoJoe2020
I wouldnt want to get it from that MAGAt. Wait for President Biden
Why? The problem is the President is a disaster and Joe Biden just needs to sit back eat some popcorn drink some soda and watch the President continue to implode and you know that's the truth!! #TrumpIsUnwell
Trump cannot be trusted with the lives or votes of American Muslims. Period.All Trump volunteers should go on the 'sly' and wear Biden buttons in groups standing in lines. Trump supporters in Biden clothing. False sense if security
I should of said if Biden was having a rally haha
He's just an angry liberal, if Herman Cain Died going to a democratic or Biden's rally, you would hear nothing from them and wouldnt blame Biden. Its funny how easy it is for them to blame the fault always on the same person. When this guy knows in reality it was Herman's choice
What!?   "Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???"  The binary choice of Biden &amp; Trump #fail   Give a third party a chance:  VOTE   on 3rd of November!
I've been talking to fellow Midwesterners about MN, and my theory is that the types of non-college whites Biden appeals to are the blue collar PA types, but MN non-college whites are the north woods type cut from a very different cloth, thus MN is coming back to the Midwest pack
Zogby Analytics - The Zogby Poll¬Æ: Horse race between Trump and Biden is closer than appears; Everything hinges on big turnout among younger voters for Biden; Trump crushing it with swing voters
Pentagon details plan to reduce forces in Germany ....VOTE BIDEN TO KEEP AMERICA SAFE!!!!
Ugh ugh ugh he doesn‚Äôt do himself any favors. ‚ÄòSupporting‚Äô biden is almost as draining as choosing college classes.
I thought Biden had the black vote sewed up
Given the circus lynching with Barr in the House, and the Biden's pre-fab "kindergarten" news conference today.....
Did you watch Biden's "news conference" today?    Pre-fab answers for pre-fab questions from pre-selected "reporters" Biden called on by name from a list he had.  This is a joke....right?
Psychopath  NEVER is accountable for anything bad. He blames others bc that‚Äôs what psychopaths do. He‚Äôll take credit for anything good, like OBAMA/BIDEN 75 months of job growth bc that‚Äôs what psychopaths do. TRUMP FAILED AMERICA!
Most of the people I work with and hang out with ‚Äúused‚Äù to be liberals.  Now they will be voting for Trump. They are nurses, doctors, and union workers. I also do not know one person who voted for Trump that is going to vote Biden.
Never will stand with Biden
Mother of 3 what? 3 failed attempts  to be a vet for biden, a blm guilter? An ANTIFA cook? These people lie faster then they think.
That‚Äôs if Biden comes out if his basement
He doesn‚Äôt have to do interviews on FOX. But he is running for president. If you opened your eyes and ears to questions asked to Trump and questions asked to Biden you would see the bias. Your TDS keeps you useful idiots to liberalism. Will he debate Trump? No.
They should start with the burning with the city hall and voting wards. Make it impossible to vote in November. At least three Electoral Votes Mr Biden would lose. by not being cast.
ü§¢ü§¢ If that happens, I may actually vote 3rd party or not at all. I can barely stomach voting for Biden, I can‚Äôt vote for her too.
Ironic how he tried to pressure me into making a ‚Äútimes up Biden‚Äù video. Like dude how about you start with yourself üò†
I think it would be better to have president Biden do the honors. Imo.
New poll. If you are voting for  follow Biden. Tell family &amp; friends.
Guess this means if  wins we can BELIEVE IN AMERICA AGAIN! Good job Tucker endorsing Biden!
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I'm a republican for years now and remember a time I had posters in the window, on the lawn. Now it could cause death. Biden  is leading Trump? I tell you this, it's  overwhelming white, black, color? People will vote Trump , the sleeping Giant  is awake&amp; waiting.RETWEET IF U üëç
Been a republican many years now and remember a time I had posters in the window, on the lawn. Now it could cause death . We are told Biden  is leading Trump. I tell you this, it's  overwhelming white, black, color? People will vote Trump , the sleeping Giant  is awake&amp; waiting.

Yeah. I don‚Äôt try to guilt trip people into voting for Biden because I would never ask a sexual assault survivor to vote for a rapist, no matter what their party affiliation is.
Joe ‚Äúdo nothing‚Äù Biden, also Joe ‚Äúthe pedophile, little-girl-sniffing, child-groper‚Äù ü§¢ü§Æ I‚Äôm disgusted that this is what the two party system has given us
Rachel: Trump threatens to veto an 86-14 bill in the Senate to fund the military that included removing Confederate generals names to military installations. Trump‚Äôs risks an override. The first of his presidency. And the latest poll of Florida reports Biden‚Äôs 13 point lead &gt; DJT
Biden is going to disallow enforcement of restrictive covenants!
This is everywhere, U.S.A., if Biden wins this fall.
Biden has literal dementia and we‚Äôre talking about trumps mental state?Could you imagine how the aging Joe Biden would handle it. Of course, the goal is not for Biden to sit four years. They will remove him and replace him with his VP as soon as it is convenient.
Right. And Joe Biden is no Hillary Clinton. He needs someone MORE dynamic and electorally accomplished.
I'm still convinced that Biden won because he was thought appeal to white people.
Are they (the Biden team) actively courting only women who they don't see as a threat to his authority?
Please explain to me why most of the women thought to be on Biden's short list for VP didn't run for president themselves. If the most important qualification is ready to be president on day one, why didn't they run themselves?
My mom asked me about her the other day. I said she's a congresswoman from California, she's the CBC chair and she's stated that she doesn't want to run for president. Mom said oh, VP probably isn't the right position for her, especially given Biden's age. üò¨
Friday Points to Ponder:  Who will Joe Biden's running mate be in the 2020 presidential campaign?
If you ever want to safely have sex with strangers again vote for Joe Biden, wear a mask and don't forget to use condoms.
This is exciting me more than any of Joe Biden's stances
A really good reason to vote for Joe Biden ‚Äî even if you know nothing about Joe Biden, even if you‚Äôre not a Biden supporter, is that HES NOT DONALD TRUMP! It‚Äôs truly beyond my comprehension how anyone could support President Trump for another term.
As bad as both candidates are an argument could be made that 4 more years of Trump would be better than 8 years of Biden.  We really need to defeat neoconservatism and neoliberalism as both are two heads on the same dragon.
Uh oh. Lawrence is asking Cory Booker about Joe Biden's notes on Kamala.
At this point it looks like the only hope we have is if the Green Party wins.   Both Biden and Trump promise total disaster.
SHHHH! Don't say that about our new masters or it's whatever the fuck the word "Gulag" is in Chinese for you! Biden gets elected and we'll have COVID re-education camps, FDR style. anti-maskers like us will be the new Japanese as we fall into a Civil War.
yes i WILL be making jokes about voting for Biden until further notice
Hey, Joe Biden, this is Twitter. And I was basically paraphrasing  so argue with him on the point, I have not tried it yet. But DO wear your 3% effective face panties. Meanwhile, Fauci has photos of him unmasking while not eating at a stadium.
I agree and disagree. Most of these Antifa-types say "liberals get the bullet too", are Bernie-bros, and don't care much for Biden except voting for him will oust Trump. A Biden win may actually cause them to cease since this whole thing is being funded by Soros anyway.
I'm going to be here for all the drama because I'll be pissed. I'm still going to vote for Biden and I might even volunteer but I'm not donating.
listen ladies we‚Äôre settling for Biden not for EVERY ain‚Äôt shit man!!!
‚ÄúTrump is racist, so voting for him makes you racist too.‚Äù I agree, but....how does that not also apply to  voting for Joe Biden??
Yeah but if we get a Biden we might not get a civil war, that‚Äôs BORING.
every day I become a little bit more sure that Biden is going to lose this election lmao
I guess we should be thankful for the violent BLM riots breaking masking/distancing rules which have essentially caused this true pandemic of world hunger in starving nations b/c rich white Karens have given into fear-based propaganda designed to ensure a Biden win via mail ins.
so we‚Äôre gonna vote for Biden and overthrow the two party system after that then?
BEATING BIDEN IS NOT THE GOAL
#TrumpLiesEverytimeHeSpeaks   JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Presidential candidates tend to pick VPs that are able to disappear into the background.  The exception was Bush/Cheney.  I think Harris is too strong a personality for Biden.  Same goes for Warren.  I say he picks Rice.
Oh really Joe Biden and Obama , were ready to sell America soul to CHINA
It will also counteract a female running mate that Biden might pick
SO what is the "Lincoln Project" anyway? Kill a Republican who lowered UI rates amongst all races, esp. blacks by more than it's been at in decades (until COVID Hoax and BLMers burning down black businesses), replace him with an actual bigot named Biden?
It's a PLACEBO b/c the lethality of the virus is a HOAX. They'll release all the vaxxes after they fraudulently elect Biden as Prez. I will NOT be getting one.
That must mean Biden wins. ü§¨
Or we can just all vote Biden in and you'll end the facade I presume. I'm actually contemplating it. I know we can't fight the system. Might as well join my comrades and live out the last of my years in comfortable complacence.
Biden is SO not one of their own LOL... I actually know some antifa ppl and they dislike Biden, as one might expect, they wanted Bernie. And Bernie's not even really one of them. Oddly enough, most of them are anti-semitic. LOL, can't make it up.
Today about George Floyd. But to ban about abortion and the babies the scumbag bastards kill on the streets. Don‚Äôt tell me you are a better person or Christian than us. We are ready to protect cops babies and President Trump not biden and Pelosi!
I want Biden to spoon me and smell my hair, but back when I was 12 yrs old. Ohhhh yeeeeeah. leg hairs.
Ummmm. This is happening NOW. Biden isn't president, last I looked. But let me guess, this isn't Trump's fault, but you'd be tripping over yourself to blame Obama were he president.
I watched CNN most of my life. And then Trump came into office. So I started flipping back and forth trying to get balance coverage between Fox and CNN. It's clear CNN is for Joe Biden Fox Donald Trump. Journalism was part of my major at the U of MN. Where is balanced coverage?
I know, it's so progressive, we'll have our 1st female POC prez with Biden playing the equivalent of the Queen of England, only gropier. His VP will be the 1st female VP to be raped by the sitting President! So exciting!!
I'm voting for Biden so I can watch him fail and maybe get impeached for sexual assault.
I'm voting Biden b/c I presume all the riots and COVID BS will magically disappear since it's all a paid for plot to destroy Trump. It was nice having someone whom the system hated so much, but I guess I'd rather just go to SLEEP with the rest of America too. #SleepyJoeBiden
OhGod.   I hope not.   Biden us s buffoon.BREAKING: The Biden campaign's search for a VP is over. Sources say Biden's choice for a running mate is your mom.
November 2020 election is not about Joe Biden ,one of these women will be the next President of the United States if the voters vote for Biden....FACT
hey what‚Äôs on the spineless Twits agenda today. Looking for some conspiracy to cook up info on Biden I‚Äôm sure. We are watching
As a republican who will not vote for Trump, all I ask of a Biden VP is that it be someone who can step in when he is forced leave office early for health reasons.
Me too! No seat taken from the house or senate, she knows international politics and security, has drive, passion, and kicks trump and pences ass. I think her or duckworth would be the best but I‚Äôm game for whoever Biden picks. Seriously I‚Äôd take a cat or a grilled cheese for him
I heard Chris Wallace being interviewed by some reporter talking about our president behind his back, criticizing him,HE is a back stabber Wallace he added his opinion and conjecture, now I‚Äôm waiting to see if can SOFTBALL Biden in an interview.

You were dogging Biden during the entire primary debate. Now you are ok with it. Sounds about right.
Biden called this
When does it come out?
When is supposed to be released today? Also someone do a welfare check on
Oh yeah I love her. Just wondering the percentage if we know it?
Do we know
So it really is something I hope will be considered. I want to find alternatives to fossil fuels since that will eventually be depleted, smart cars, putting back up the regulations, and Biden will do all of it ‚ô•Ô∏è
For every 100 nuclear power plant jobs, 66 more jobs are created in the local community. Nearly one in four nuclear workers are veterans.
Each nuclear power plant employs 500 to 1,000 workers. Building a nuclear power reactor employs up to 3,500 workers at peak construction. Nuclear worker salaries are 20 percent higher on average than those of other electricity generation sources.
I am so humbled that you replyed to me! I retweet practically everything you post. And I hope that in the future it‚Äôs something all people in a bipartisan way open up that idea. It would create energy production plants in practically any state no just in the south or west
Oh no absolutely not. It‚Äôs more of a potential long term goal. Definitely not during an election. But year 2 while working on climate change and the health of workers, and people wanting skilled jobs that pay more, to look at that more.
How to safely dispose of the nuclear waste. They recommend to use massive metal shed buried deep far underground that are sealed and then to put the barrels in it so as to keep the waste out of the environment and away from nefarious characters
The several disasters like Chernobyl and Japan happened to because of man made errors or natural disasters due to location. So it‚Äôs about place. Also it provides thousands of different skill level jobs. From manual labor to engineers, construction, and land workers to deal with
And do it in advance, we can prepare to transition workers so they will have job continuity.  It‚Äôs controversial but the best alternative for mass energy production is nuclear energy. The issue is it needs to be regulated extensively
1/ Also I have written research papers about fracking and the dangers of it to small communities. It causes issues with the land and water and most towns end up becoming ghost towns after a period of time. If we work to find alternatives
Susan Rice is headed to jail.  Kamala threatened all Americans who supported Trump if Biden wins, plus her past is so filthy.
I just saw you interviewing Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos Jim I think you have the Joe Biden syndrome,time you stepped down.
he just said if Biden is president there will be NO MORE COWS! Someone save
Joe Biden time traveler confirmed
It is kind of like Politico announcing Kamala Harris as Biden's running mate 4 days early.
I‚Äôll have you know I live in Wisconsin. And I did not give Biden permission to use my jock strap.
Strokes and heart attacks are down 40% and the doctors figure they‚Äôre calling it COVID-19 or like Joe Biden commented called it ‚Äú COVID 9 ‚Äú

Maybe letting unhinged lefties riot every night for two months while the rest of the country gets arrested for opening up their businesses or fined for going to church or screamed at in public by some random lunatic for not wearing a mask isn‚Äôt the way you get Biden elected.
How can HRC, Rice, Biden and BO live with themselves for this???? HOW?

JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I'm worried, as well about the young Berners who still refuse to vote because Bernie dropped out even though he's supporting Biden. I never felt that way at that age; I voted for my chosen party's candidate and that was it. For me, it was always better than voting republican.
#NOTHING Had Biden done anything in 8 years with Obuma he could have won the 2016 nomination instead of Hillary. And people think he can be president NOW??
If Biden gets inüëé
I love these documents! It‚Äôs like reading a history book in real time. I think I‚Äôm gonna create a google drive for all documents like these
Is there more like this?
‚ÄúBiden is leading in the polls.‚Äù
That's some four dimensional chess that I don't think Biden is capable of pulling off.
He is emerging as the new Rock Star of the Republican party.  We need it, if Biden would get elected, what is happening in Portland and Chicago is how every damn city will look like. Look at SF....an utter disgrace and all run by Dems.   Destroy should be the name of their party.
Why should anyone believe you? You made up stories about Joe Biden for your ridiculous ads before the orange toddler kicked you out. Show us proof.
Interesting how the Left never takes any responsibility.  Go live in Portland, get an early start on how it will feel living in America if Biden gets elected.  Enjoy!Love seeing leftist saying bLoCk mE iF u R vOtInG bIDeN! We are so much better with our version of vote shaming #leftunity
Ya the MSM pumped up Hilary‚Äôs lead, shocker The polls only had her up by 2 points where it mattered. Biden is currently blowing those numbers out of the water.
The only issue with Warren is that she will be considered by most as the real President.  Joe Biden simply isn‚Äôt Presidential material.  He never really was and his cognitive abilities are clearly declining.
I doubt Joe Biden is cognizantly capable of serving a full term, so really you‚Äôre voting for his VP tbh.
He wasn‚Äôt a Biden supporter so he wasn‚Äôt really black.
News flash, nut-job!  You‚Äôve ruined our country - nobody‚Äôs trying to get in!  Stop wasting all our money! #TrumpFailedAmerica #TrumpVirusDeathToll150K  #PortlandProtest #TrumpGestapo #BountyGateAintGoingAway #AlienDNA #RacistInChief #RapistInChief #Biden

Nothing but incredible lies in all of pervie Joe Biden‚Äôs commercials.  Hopefully people aren‚Äôt stupid enough to buy his BS.
Who moved the embassy? Biden had 8 years and didn't. Sad!
If it were Republicans wildly mendaciously claiming violent rioters were peaceful protestors, Twitter would be deleting them left and right  The 2020 election is rigged, has an asterisk on it before it‚Äôs even held. Biden admin will be üíØillegitimate.  Democracy dies in censorship
Biden is obviously a clairvoyant or just understands Trump better than you!
i'm increasingly convinced that for all the criticism he gets Zuck is the last, best, hope for this country.  Its been very heartening to see him stand up to the corporate boycott demanding her serve the biden campaign (like google &amp; twitter are doing)
Please let Biden win. Please let Biden win. Please let Biden win. Please let Biden win.  Please let Biden win. Please let Biden win.  #RepublicansForBiden #IndependentsForBiden #EveryoneForBiden #Biden2020

You‚Äôre the one in a ‚Äúdisastrous state of condition‚Äù!  ... what the hell does that even mean - it‚Äôs a ‚Äúdisastrous state‚Äù or ‚Äúdisastrous condition‚Äù.  Get a damn English tutor.  #TrumpVirus  #TrumpFailedAmerica #RepublicansAgainstTrump #Biden
Its real simple folks.   Everytime I think this guy isn't running against trump and Biden is it makes me sick to my stomach.
Blaming Biden for Trump‚Äôs mess??!
Again if you aren‚Äôt voting Biden I get it, but stop being fucking dishonest and saying he is the same as trump or will do nothing you‚Äôre acting like a fucking child and it‚Äôs pissing me off.  We are not only smarter, but we are better than that.  End rant
Who said we support Biden?
Biden announces plans to boost black and Latino finances #JoeBiden #JoeBidenForPresident2020
Where is the lie.  Howie has zero chance and it‚Äôs doubtful that a protest of the Dnc is gonna do much good.  So it becomes trump v Biden
Proud!  Looking forward to having President Biden and First Lady Biden in the White House!
My local (left-leaning) newspaper actually shared this... üòÅ
Trump says he won‚Äôt go and pay respects to John Lewis at Capitol
Trump should do a mock debate and give his real answers to questions and act out the fake Joe Biden answers.
Friend of mine had a decent drive up through Michigan the other day - said Trump signs everywhere! Nothing for Biden.  Even here in Wisconsin, no Biden signs yet. ü§∑
Major difference is Biden polling has been consistent since the Spring.  Key is getting voters out and voting.    Hate stray works that weren‚Äôt supposed to be in original tweet!
Trump‚Äôs cognitive skills are almost as bad as Biden‚Äôs.
True story: One of my volunteers in Wisconsin spoke to a nurse yesterday who is a former Republican and says she is voting for Biden because of Trump's handling of COVID-19. Thinking of her while reading this
Biden was referring to ALL women and ESPECIALLY ‚Äúwomen of color‚Äù (a racist phrase, btw).
To be fair, Biden already forgot!
Name one by trump and if we are comparing... Biden wins minute by minute. Grow up
Biden has been polling fairly consistent.  Seems to be an issue of a different tone.
I think she was beating Biden before SC
‚Å¶ here it is: Trump ad falsely suggests Biden supports defunding police - The Washington Post
i like her, but i like susan rice just as much. to me she would be the perfect fit to carry on the obama/biden legacy
Trump should have this elderly woman speak at his convention except she‚Äôs still probably a biden voter and deserves everything she gets
I wish all 123,400 of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
We really could‚Äôve been voting for Elizabeth Warren instead of Biden... never gonna forgive y‚Äôall for that
I don't care if you donate to Biden, just make sure you Bernie supporters vote for him.
Yeah, but it isn‚Äôt about having him lead the country, it is merely about not having Trump in the WH. Biden would just be a warm body occasionally mumbling into the camera while people behind the scene pull the strings. A lot of ppl are willing to risk that.
Although there is a LOT more enthusiasm around Biden this year then there was around Hillary, that could EASILY change come november.
We're probably going to have to agree to disagree on this one because I'm not seeing that on the left, at least not right now. It's possible we can get our act together for this election but it's a really hard sell because Biden isn't exactly...  a good candidate.
Joe Biden is a useful idiot we can possibly use to push more progressive ideals through.
I didn‚Äôt say it had NOTHING to do with Hillary.  She was certainly terrible.  However, that mistake isn‚Äôt being made this time.  Biden is a dud, but he isn‚Äôt toxic.  Yet the left attempting to demonize everyone who doesn‚Äôt bow at their altar may not be happy on November 4th.
the sad thing is if  is expecting that if  wins, he‚Äôll get his job back or some other respectable job.  he won‚Äôt of course. he‚Äôs far too much of a neocon for the marxists that will be running the show under biden. they dispose of him like a used condom
Would not say Obama was racist, however he perpetuated the system that favors the elites versus helping everyone else, bailing out Wall Street.  Biden is a Dixiecrat, I‚Äôm voting for him to get out trump as well, but hoooo boi is he awful
Curious on how you think Biden is fash?  I def agree he‚Äôs authoritarian but not sold on the fash bit
I like how you bring up Biden when I‚Äôm not a liberal/democrat.
The election is between Nationalist-Libertarianism of which Trump is a champion vs Bolshevist Globalism of which Biden is the accidental candidate.
LifePetitions - Petitions for a Culture of Life
There is the difference between mail-in voting and absentee voting. What is wrong with you? You and Joe Biden need to get with it. Why don't you go in the woods and stay there?
There is always time for fighting,  I am voting for Biden to get rid of trump, but don‚Äôt you fucking dare lie to me about his absolute garbage record and blatant sabatoge on the media to discredit the only good candidate we have had in forever
I don‚Äôt subscribe to IDPol I don‚Äôt fucking care what race/gender he picks.  I want a fucking progressive in the WHite house.  Biden is a neoliberal that has been on the wrong side of history his entire career
That‚Äôs why we vote out DT, but if you think Biden will be a good president you are sorely mistaken
Adorable you think Biden would listen to anyone but his lobbyists
That was still better than the previous program, ya we need something better I get it Biden most likely will try to expand it might get us a public option.  Not what we want but it‚Äôs way more than any republican plan
if he (biden) doesn‚Äôt remember it is it still rape?
these are clearly not America‚Äôs two greatest debaters but biden hasn‚Äôt shown any ability to answer any question that hasn‚Äôt been scripted (which I suppose the debates will likely be we know how it works). When you guys said ‚Äúanybody but trump‚Äù, you really meant it god bless you
ok. it‚Äôs so easy.  let‚Äôs see biden do it. make it a debate question.
Your Biden banners were  awesome.Yes, Make America Great Again, Vote Biden and get rid of the person who has single handedly destroyed our standing in the world...
You also told trump was not Obama and biden were not spying on him. How did that work out for you
What kind of dumbass question is this? Funny? Neither. It will be scary as hell if Biden wins.
What are talking about? Biden lives in his basement ü§£    Trump isn‚Äôt scared and that‚Äôs why you hate him. I‚Äôll bet Biden won‚Äôt even debate Trump; mark my words he‚Äôll use COVID-19 as an excuse!

Wait, what? Biden is for protecting our children and you say he‚Äôs wrong for mom‚Äôs?  I‚Äôve heard about covid brain after you recover from the disease but your head must be covered in fog. Your tweet made no sense.
I agree to the extent we are talking about people who pay close attention... but I don‚Äôt think most people pay much attention. So I doubt many will look closely at Biden‚Äôs record or plan.   I do think there‚Äôs more disfunction on the left now more than ever though.
They are enthused to vote against Trump. I‚Äôll admit, I don‚Äôt understand anyone who‚Äôd say they‚Äôre ‚Äúenthused‚Äù about a Biden presidency, that has looked closely at what that‚Äôd be.   And I don‚Äôt think it takes polls to see how this is going if you read enough diverse content.

BREAKING: Leak reveals Joe Biden's VP pick, Senator Kamala Harris
If Trump had called a black American crazy this tweet would be about a racist attack. Biden gets away with being a bigot.
You covered up Biden's racist attack on her.
Ok, riddle me this:  wtf is Biden or any of his useless centrist cohorts doing to help the suffering citizens they alledgedly represent?  They don‚Äôt give a $hit about us, they‚Äôre just hoping we all die off so they can avoid addressing any of the deep-seated problems we face.
You‚Äôd would win 50 states as the nominee and unify the country more than either Trump or Biden ever could.
I could see Nikki Haley running but no way Biden makes it to 2024. We‚Äôd probably end up with Haley plus whoever Biden‚Äôs VP pick (who he said will be a woman) is, so in that instance we‚Äôd be virtually guaranteed our first female President.
Joe Biden won his Senate race at age 29 and was inaugurated at age 30. You only have to meet the age requirement at the time of actually being sworn in.

My friend, I call him ‚ÄúTrucknuts‚Äù, He would say Joe, Jill, and Hunter Biden.  He‚Äôs an idiot but always on message.
Media asked Biden question, but wont asked him about spying on a political opponent. Media wont ask Hillary what message she sending to 11 yr old girls after being caught cheating.
A bit worried about Riden the Biden now?  You should be. Sniff, sniff.
Meanwhile obama/biden were spying on trump
Compare the differential treatment our media treats biden with compared to trump
So frustrating, because a lot of this is about establishing a paper trail of spending-phobia before Biden gets in, so you're not a hypocrite for undermining Biden's plans, you're just a "principled fiscal hawk" or whatever.
Especially a former prosecutor whose public reason after the fact for attacking Biden on segregation at the debate was "It's a debate! That's politics!" instead of "it's an actual problem we should address."

Correct me if I'm wrong.  It appears you're using actual footage of Trump's America...which IS happening...to tell me what WOULD happen under Biden...implying that this would be terrible...but yet, prevented under Trump...who, (just to review) it's now happening under...actually.
Are you on drugs? It's Trump doing this NOW. Why would this be Biden's America? Please explain yourself.Information I've shared is a result of research I've done,  and personal experiences with the educational system,  police &amp; protests in my city. Believe it or not,  before Obama,  voted for Bush.  Outside of first few posts where we've discussed Biden,  haven't pushed him
I‚Äôve been thinking about this, too. Is Biden‚Äôs best move to pick someone ‚Äúsafe,‚Äù or to go for a bulldog who can throw down? I don‚Äôt know the answer.
Every thing you've posted has been in support of him.  So I should assume otherwise? You assume I support Biden because I'm anti trump.

You miss his point. If he was a biden supporter the coverage of his death would look completely different. What does his political view matter? A black man was murdered for nothing but because he doesn‚Äôt hold the left ideology his death is just another deplorable.
According to biden he‚Äôs not black. I guess black isn‚Äôt a color but rather a political view. Sex doesn‚Äôt determine your gender and now your skin color doesn‚Äôt determine your color.

And you think Biden will put anyone good on SCOTUS? McConnell will tell him to appoint someone to the right of Hitler or there won't be a vote, and Biden will gladly find someone who fits that. His record on scotus justices is ATROCIOUS.
Literally no one can say that, because that's a stupid statement. I don't know if I'd survive 4 years of Biden, either. I'm trans and without healthcare I'll be dead, and neither of them are for the obvious system to get people like me healthcare.

(5) Clinton NEVER led in the "white voters with a college degree" demographic; Biden leads that demo by a whopping *21* points! It took the dopey Republican "base" vomiting up a toxic, repugnant racist piece of slime like Trump for the GOP to lose its rock-solid grip on that demo
oof. These numbers are way closer than I'd like to see. Biden's gotta do something to get people fired up. I'm in WI and all i get from him are youtube ads. And I get more from Trump
Joe Biden and Obama were the ones who started locking children up and cages and separating them from their parents. Trump is just following a continuation of Joe Biden's and Obama's policies. Look at Obama's, Bush's, Biden's and Trump's, policies there's not much difference.
If you resign now you wont have to witness a most humiliating election of 22% Trump 78% Biden.

It‚Äôs the problem with two party system. Voting for lesser two evils, plus party nomination is always rigged. Biden a fucking idiot. No one progressive enough. Bernie only person spent lifetime genuinely trying to help people. Ocasio-Cortez will be pres one day and i can‚Äôt wait

You miss his point. If he was a biden supporter the coverage of his death would look completely different. What does his political view matter? A black man was murdered for nothing but because he doesn‚Äôt hold the left ideology his death is just another deplorable.
According to biden he‚Äôs not black. I guess black isn‚Äôt a color but rather a political view. Sex doesn‚Äôt determine your gender and now your skin color doesn‚Äôt determine your color.

Maybe, but the downside is that Biden being in will also make a lot of libs go back to brunch and not paying attention, so in 2024 we get a competent fascist running from the right.
And you think Biden will put anyone good on SCOTUS? McConnell will tell him to appoint someone to the right of Hitler or there won't be a vote, and Biden will gladly find someone who fits that. His record on scotus justices is ATROCIOUS.
Literally no one can say that, because that's a stupid statement. I don't know if I'd survive 4 years of Biden, either. I'm trans and without healthcare I'll be dead, and neither of them are for the obvious system to get people like me healthcare.

Biden... only because that gets Trump out. I think in 4 more years we need a way stronger leader regardless of what side of the aisle.
Biden's more dangerous, I'm voting Green.
We are worse off Every. Single. Damn. Day.  is president. Trump‚Äôs egregious failures mean that, if we can‚Äôt arrest the spread of COVID-19 in the next 8-10 weeks, the country will be lost by Nov 3 &amp; Biden will inherit a country even more chaotic than it is today.
In his sleep, Biden can do more good than Trump at his best. At the very worst, Biden would do far less damage. You need to think about the scale of the destruction Trump has caused by his incompetence.
Once trump loses i hope Biden fires every single trump appointee at once. None of them can be trusted.

Joe Biden and Obama were the ones who started locking children up and cages and separating them from their parents. Trump is just following a continuation of Joe Biden's and Obama's policies. Look at Obama's, Bush's, Biden's and Trump's, policies there's not much difference.
If you resign now you wont have to witness a most humiliating election of 22% Trump 78% Biden.

It‚Äôs the problem with two party system. Voting for lesser two evils, plus party nomination is always rigged. Biden a fucking idiot. No one progressive enough. Bernie only person spent lifetime genuinely trying to help people. Ocasio-Cortez will be pres one day and i can‚Äôt wait
He would have to get the states to go along since elections are not federal. He might get some red states to do it, but that won't stop Biden from winning.

For every 100 nuclear power plant jobs, 66 more jobs are created in the local community. Nearly one in four nuclear workers are veterans.
Each nuclear power plant employs 500 to 1,000 workers. Building a nuclear power reactor employs up to 3,500 workers at peak construction. Nuclear worker salaries are 20 percent higher on average than those of other electricity generation sources.
I am so humbled that you replyed to me! I retweet practically everything you post. And I hope that in the future it‚Äôs something all people in a bipartisan way open up that idea. It would create energy production plants in practically any state no just in the south or west
Oh no absolutely not. It‚Äôs more of a potential long term goal. Definitely not during an election. But year 2 while working on climate change and the health of workers, and people wanting skilled jobs that pay more, to look at that more.
How to safely dispose of the nuclear waste. They recommend to use massive metal shed buried deep far underground that are sealed and then to put the barrels in it so as to keep the waste out of the environment and away from nefarious characters
The several disasters like Chernobyl and Japan happened to because of man made errors or natural disasters due to location. So it‚Äôs about place. Also it provides thousands of different skill level jobs. From manual labor to engineers, construction, and land workers to deal with
And do it in advance, we can prepare to transition workers so they will have job continuity.  It‚Äôs controversial but the best alternative for mass energy production is nuclear energy. The issue is it needs to be regulated extensively
1/ Also I have written research papers about fracking and the dangers of it to small communities. It causes issues with the land and water and most towns end up becoming ghost towns after a period of time. If we work to find alternatives

Admirable person but VP candidate? No experience as an elected official? Limited administrative experience? Will she help win swing states? Definitely should have some major  role in Biden government
Spread Portland &amp; Chicago far and wide, skyrocket our taxes, eliminate those pesky charter schools, taxpayer funded abortion for all, open borders w/social services...  Lots that Biden offers!
Maybe. But this also how the Dems got Biden. They had 10+ people running and Biden, somehow, pulled an inside straight. They managed to nominate someone older, whiter, and with more of a track record of saying bigoted things.

I've been talking to fellow Midwesterners about MN, and my theory is that the types of non-college whites Biden appeals to are the blue collar PA types, but MN non-college whites are the north woods type cut from a very different cloth, thus MN is coming back to the Midwest pack

I did not like her "assault" on Biden on the debate stage, thought it was a cheap shot, but I do like her and as Biden's notes indicate, her qualifications are excellent. If he kicked the bucket in the middle of his term, I could easily imagine a President Harris. In a heartbeat.

And the clip from 1987 of Biden berating a press member
Can pretty much guarantee the media does ZERO research on Chinese government spending money on Facebook ads for Biden
In Wisconsin this is just our way of saying, ‚ÄúFU Biden!‚Äù
Nazi America brought to you by the far left Dummycrats. It‚Äôs time for you mindless sheep know as Biden supporters to wake up.
Joe Biden VP Pick: The 13 Women in the Running - Sen. Tammy Baldwin makes this list
These are better numbers for Trump than most of what's coming out of the states polled, though the national number was 51-42 Biden, which is in line with the polling averages.
Isn‚Äôt it weird that Dems/Media never point out that Biden visits states Hillary won?
Joe Biden's presidential campaign told staff to remove TikTok from their work and personal devices due to security concerns, according to a source within the campaign.
There‚Äôs another one with an old women alone in her house on hold with the police while someone crowbars the door. Like this is straight up fear mongering. This whole ‚ÄúBiden wants America to fall into anarchy and crime‚Äù narrative is insane.
Has anyone seen the total fear propaganda anti-joe Biden ads on Hulu? A mother and child hiding under the bed trying to call 9-1-1 but being put on hold for 17 minutes while an ominous man walks into the doorway. Like what the fuck?
Conversely, Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton are the natural product of the Democratic party's evolution. Old, out of touch, feeling as though they deserve the throne even though they really haven't done much to deserve it. A touch of nepotism.
But vote biden cuz "the courts"

Supposedly Hillary had Wisconsin so locked down she didn't even come here so I am sure Biden will do way better
I'm not voting for Biden. Diana Prince, maybe. Haven't decided, but not Biden.
Idk who needs to hear this but not voting is a vote for Trump.  We can not fucking repeat 2016 again. You can‚Äôt look at what‚Äôs happening in Portland and with the rising covid cases and tell me that Biden isn‚Äôt the lesser of two evils.   Fucking request your absentee ballots.

True. But Trump hasn‚Äôt learned that America isn‚Äôt a business. It‚Äôs a country of real people. He care about P&amp;L only. He‚Äôs not &amp; has never been the right man to lead us. Biden is just a 4 year stop gap but tensions will decrease after he‚Äôs in office. Trump might lead us to war.

The fact that it's Biden or Trump is absolutely terrifying.

If Biden stays true to his word, we will again be the manufacturing capital of the world, the pioneer of engineering &amp; technology, &amp; the leading force to end the climate crisis and build an economy where health, wellness, &amp; dignity‚Äînot corporate profits‚Äîare at the heart.
Most importantly, Biden has finally understood the choice between economic growth and environmental protection is FALSE.   WE CAN HAVE A GREEN ECONOMY AND ECONOMIC GROWTH TOGETHER. üí∏‚öôÔ∏èüå≥  Investments in our people and our planet are investments in our future &amp; economy.
But Biden now understands that climate change is also a tremendous opportunity for growth. Through massive investments in clean energy, manufacturing, infrastructure, &amp; re-equipping America‚Äôs workers, we can fight the climate crisis while re-engineering the core of our economy.
But I promised not to give up, and instead would join a coalition of people to push Biden to understand the scope of our issues and to adopt commonsense, fiscally-responsible, &amp; worker-centered solutions to our issues.  I‚Äòm thrilled to admit we‚Äòve had a breakthrough.
Everyone who knows me knows I have issues with Joe Biden. I did not believe he understood the scale of the crises facing our nation‚Äîespecially the climate crisis‚Äîand that his solutions did not address the size and scope that America‚Äôs working families class needed.

Why would Bidens team decide to roll out economic plan TODAY? The networks will not leave the judiciary hearing, nor should they. Poor planning on their part. Biden won't get the credit deserved or attention.
I feel like people will say that Biden isn't getting anything done because he's going to have to spend his first two years dismantling everything. Reinstating DACA, resupplying hospitals, removing babies from prison, re-joining the UN/WHO...all that would still be amazing work.

Biden Details Proposal To Advance Racial Equity In America
It's long past time that we ensure all #Wisconsinites enjoy a fair return for their work. Joe Biden‚Äôs plan to address the racial inequalities in our society is essential, and is a huge step to ensure Black workers can prosper in our economy.
Opening a case file is not the same as a criminal investigation and does not mean Joe Biden is a suspect in Ukraine.
Prolly Biden‚Äôs best choice in my opinion. But if a Biden/Rice ticket were to win, it would make it harder for  to run in 2024 against both/Rice  top of ticket(assuming Biden might drop out to health). Perhaps that factors into Biden team‚Äôs decision, to block  in future.
It doesn‚Äôt but the pr for hired by the dnc hopes you are dumb enough to believe it. A vote for Biden is like announcing to the world that you are an idiot who doesn‚Äôt deserve nice things, same goes for a trump vote!
I keep hearing the same excuses why I have to vote for Biden. "Once Trump is out, we can focus on real change."   Liberals just want to go back to apathy. They refuse to realize, Biden will lead to another variation of rightwing authoritarianism. And next time, it won't be clown.
#Biden's economic plan includes ways to address racial #inequality...  "The plan largely repackages dozens of policies already proposed by the campaign that directly addresses #Black, #Hispanic, #AsianAmerican and #Native American communities. "...
See H1N1 response of Obama /Biden!
Psychopath  NEVER is accountable for anything bad. He blames others bc that‚Äôs what psychopaths do. He‚Äôll take credit for anything good, like OBAMA/BIDEN 75 months of job growth bc that‚Äôs what psychopaths do. TRUMP FAILED AMERICA!

That's why I'm saying, there are a lot of people who have rationalized their decision to vote for Biden, expecting to get a moderate. Which is farcical.
The funniest, scariest thing about bringing up ACA is that almost immediately after passing it, the far Left mobilized saying it was a half measure and Obama failed to deliver what they were asking for. So you know exactly what's around the corner w/ a Biden presidency. The fix.
Policies aside, 1990 Joe Biden, in a vacuum, would most likely be able to run an administration much better than Donald Trump.

Biden in the White House does not mean: -We will get laws that lift oppression -The supreme court will help people who need help -Social programs that actively reduce inequity will be implemented
Biden in the White House means: -We no longer have an outwardly (key word) fascist white supremacist in office that will embolden other fascist white supremacists -The president will make the work of activists slightly easier
Another reminder to really interrogate what you expect voting will accomplish.  Yes, getting Biden in the White House has some clear benefits. But if you think those benefits include "leadership that will make the world better on it's own," in any form, you may want to check that
Typical answer for someone that can't come up with a legitimate reason. Following that pos helps him. Biden only has 7m followers.

HAHAHAHAHAHA!!! Maybe Joe Biden will keep DOMINATING Donald Trump... #StupidTrumpVoters
Mother of 3 what? 3 failed attempts  to be a vet for biden, a blm guilter? An ANTIFA cook? These people lie faster then they think.
i admire the optimism......but face the facts yall biden clobbered her
Plans are not legislation - time will tell if he follows through on his promise. But on climate, Biden has listened and moved miles.

He was president for 3 years, you're not getting away with blaming Obama/Biden for trump's lack of preparedness. Trump is xenophobic, calling COVID "Kung Flu" as a scapegoat to hide the fact that he doesn't know how to fucking do anything.
How can HRC, Rice, Biden and BO live with themselves for this???? HOW?
We can't allow Biden anywhere near the White House. PERIOD. Dementia? Alzheimer's? Both? The man is not up for a job that requires you to be on your game every day, all day!! #VoteRedToSaveAmerica2020
Biden has Alzheimer's or Dementia, he shouldn't be allowed anywhere near the White House!
Biden shouldn't be allowed anywhere near the Whit House. He will press the nuke button, thinking it was a doorbell. He's got Alzheimer's, Dementia or both. It's elder abuse to put him on the campaign trail.
JOE BIDEN HAS ALZHEIMER'S, DEMENITA OR BOTH!!  None of the clips in this compilation are edited at all. Biden is NOT up for the Presidency, and I for one want him no where near the White House after watching this video!
BIDEN HAS ALZHEIMERS. PERIOD. Let's see him take a slew of question like Trump does daily. He can't and won't and his staff know it, so they have him HIDING. This is embarassing, and horrifying. All of these clips were NOT edited, at all!
Thought I'd share this with you! Anyone who thinks Biden doesn't have Dementia/Alzheimer's or both, is just lying. The man doesn't know what the hell is going on.
Who is more Evil?  Hitler: 6 million Jews shot and gassed  Margaret Sanger: 28 Million targeted Blacks and counting.   No one would vote for someone who supports Hitler, but yet, Joe Biden, "white old Democrat" supports Sanger
Huh. Interesting take considering you have insulted me from the get-go. Typicsl MAGAt &amp; bro behavior. Liberals are not the destroyers of this country....rather Liberals wish to fix the mess with a pragmatic approach. Bros are out there with fake propaganda trying to smear Biden.

"most likely person in America to be the 47th president"?!? there won't be a pandemic in 2024, and the Democratic party IS deeply fractured, it's ALL OUT civil war if Biden picks another neolib for VP,  or  are his best choices if Dems want to win in '22/'24
Biden can take it down...

In 100 days, amid deep partisan divides and surging #COVID19 cases, Trump and Biden will face off in the presidential election. DNC Chair  says the election actually starts much sooner, and that the Biden camp is focused on getting the word out about early voting.
Seems a bit  hypocritical of you, if you truely insist the claims are true against trump. Then by all means these must be true too
Fuck Joe Biden and the Democratic establishment. They're the reason why Trump is the president in the first damn place. I'm voting Green and vote shaming doesn't work on us.
typical neoliberal üí©, Trump was elected because of economic populism, enough voters bought his con over the Clinton/Obama con, would be a 50/50 race between Trump and Biden if there was no pandemic, Dems will lose '22 mids and '24 WH if Biden runs the standard neolib playbook

For heaven‚Äôs sake. One of the things about Biden that makes me feel most comfortable in voting for him is the extreme unlikeliness of him ever being a cult leader. That dynamic is just completely absent.

Yes! Rassmussen has the Latino likely vote high too. I can't see anyone w/a brain cell voting for Biden who clearly has Alzheimer's/Dementia or both. His handlers won't let him answer questions?! He said that nurses whispered in his ear, and breathed up his nose. WTF?! #MAGA2020

Am I the only one who has been thinking lately...  We should have fought harder for the Occupy Wall Street people when Obama and Biden were crushing them?
Joe Biden will be Joe Biden, we know what to expect he's a life long politician, what else does he know.  Do you believe a person that has been in politics their whole life really understands anything?
Platitudes based on nothing. The Obama/Biden admin bombed innocents authorized killing Americans. Biden has authored the racist crime bill and eulogized Strom Thurmond. Stop with the BS.
Nobody can tell me what they like about him without referencing D‚Äôs. ‚ÄúHer emails,‚Äù Clinton body count, pedophiles, Biden 47 years in office, blah blah blah. An incumbent should stand on their own.
When is Joe Biden going to announce his running mate aka senator Harris?
I would rather buy the book from your cousin (which I actually plan on doing) than read your gobbledygook. Let's get one thing straight: Biden is more composed in the head than you are.

People are voting for Biden because of decency. A Republican strategist said Biden will be elected and his policies can be addressed later. You can‚Äôt all of a sudden be decent.
They‚Äôll TOTALLY leave you alone if you elect Biden. They totally won‚Äôt destroy your life, up to and including executing you, if you fail to hold the proper opinions.
I truly beleive he can turn everything around after this virus, etc., if Biden gets in, we are only going 1 way...fast track to socialist, communist hell.
I couldn't disagree more. Hes a centrist. And if you listen to him enough you can tell hes leaning Trump. Hes definitely not voting Biden because of his senility.
I saw a ridiculous Trump ad that made the claim that Joe Biden supports defunding the police. The ad says to listen for yourself, and then it plays a 2 second sound byte that doesn‚Äôt sound like words and the voiceover starts talking about how awesome Trump is. Weak and half assed

Okay, but I'm confused. Are they saying that if I vote for Biden, regardless of who wins, I'm going to be living in Nazi America? What if I don't vote for Biden? Like, say I vote third-party, and Biden wins anyways, am I going to be living in Nazi America?
Your father would be the first in line to support Biden. He was a good man who put country before party. Why are you about this absolute nonsense???

Trump was elected (arguably) to shake up a complacent government &amp; ‚Äúdrain the swamp.‚Äù What we got was corruption, nepotism, collusion, &amp; a very different swamp...along with a bitter &amp; cognitively impaired POTUS. America‚Äôs founders never saw THIS coming!
Only 100 days till the election. That‚Äôs sort of terrifying. Also, can Biden announce his damn running mate already? Like come on.
Wait Biden worships a racist creep? Your chart doesn't match what I have seen Biden has promised climate action, and he has come out in support of a 15$/hour minimum wage. Howie Hawkins needs better campaign material that isn't factually wrong.

Social media has become the target of a dueling attack ad campaign being waged online by the sitting president and his election rival. They're shooting the messenger while giving it lots of money.
What more could he have done? He was damned if he did, damned if he didn't. Because people hate him for no real reason...nothing is good enough.  Yet 60 million were infected by H1N1 during Obama/ Biden. Staffer's said they were lucky H1N1 wasn't more deadly. Because they failed.
Biden is moving towards it
I'd say she has far more real solutions than Big Blue/Red. Biden's plan is a vague jumble of promises to dump money into programs created decades ago that have done very little in the way of closing racial divides. Dr. Jorgensen has a real plan on criminal justice reform 1/2
The major social media companies are navigating a political minefield as they try to minimize domestic misinformation and rein in foreign actors from manipulating their sites as they did in the last U.S. presidential election.

Democrats have escalated their rhetoric in what appears to be an attempt to silence our investigation.   As I‚Äòve said from the beginning, I‚Äòm simply attempting to find the truth.   What are they afraid I might find?
This hearing on AG Barr is a complete joke. The Democrats are just making themselves look unprofessional and scared shitless of Trump getting reelected in November. Their only play is keeping Biden in the basement and controlling the narrative through MSM. It's really sad.
Don't think if Biden gets in the protests will stop.  Until reform is enacted and the many individuals in positions of authority properly charged for the violation of their oaths of office and criminal acts the protests will not cease.
I gotta be completely honest, I do not trust Joe Biden to follow though with the plans he put forth if  isn‚Äôt VP  I just don‚Äôt believe he‚Äôll follow though

These attacks will not deter me; they only increase my curiosity. Our investigation will continue.
To clarify some points.   Sanders is currently the ranking member for the Dems on the Senate Budget Committee. With the Senate in Dem control, Sanders moves to chair.  Senate tie is broken by the President.  No way Biden vetoes an #M4A bill that makes it to his desk.
Here is how we implement a public single-payer system in today's political environment. A guide:  1) Democrats win control of the Senate &amp; Biden wins  2) Senate Budget Committee chair becomes Sanders - every budget bill goes through him 3) Pass #M4A through Congress, Biden signs
I used to think that Senate Republicans were tanking things because they know Trump is going to lose and they're getting ready to blame any post 2020 turmoil on Biden.  Now I think they're just soulless and dumb - a dangerous combination.
Congrats on your sobriety.  That is awesome.   A veteran who supports Biden?  Not so much.

Check out the recent virtual candidate debate!  We touched on climate change, Biden's economy plan,  new NAFTA, rural communities, agriculture, manufacturing, why I'll beat Grothman, healthcare, and more. You should definitely check this one out.
Am I off base by thinking this:  Senate Gippers know Trump is toast. They're willing to push the country off a cliff right now and then they're going to try to hang that around Biden's neck for the next four years.
Can‚Äôt wait for Biden and Trump to face off! Biden will be exposed! He can‚Äôt even read off a teleprompter.

I think it‚Äôs a good idea. Delay for safety. But his is a 4 year term and we should just let Biden have custody of the presidency until a safe election can take place.
Biden was no one's choice early. We're here now. I don't like the far-left because they act like kids. I have two, not trying to raise Becky and Brad, the Mayonnaise Twins. If you want to be taken seriously, be better.  Someone once said: Act your age, not your shoe size.

Yes we need a law and order president and we will get one in November when biden wins
By taking umbrage to Kamala Harris' comments and being on the search committee, Dodd is personalizing this. If Biden is truly his friend, Dodd can't help to see that one VP candidate gives him a clear advantage in November.
Just like his fake charties his fake university and all the many scams he has been involved with his whole life i know a crook when i see one and he is one. The only reason that he he is not in jail is because he is the prez but that will change when biden wins
In 20 there are so many great candidates that it‚Äôs no small wonder Bernie lost as much as he did. People chose Biden because they felt he was safe. Unimaginative, stale, and a bit of a groper, you can‚Äôt tell me any of the other dem candidates would poll worse against trump
The fact that Biden‚Äôs support comes from never trumpers and not Biden supporters very much does prove my point. Was it that difficult to understand what I was saying?
Wonder what this would have looked like with     or any one of the much better candidates than Biden. No offense Joe. But these polls kinda prove my point.
Wonder what would happen if Michelle Obama ran with Biden as Vice President right now?
Not I.  Biden is  a racist and is on record for segregation.
I understand the democrat party tried to split the country, Biden supported segregation, and the democrats started the KKK, fortunately the Republican Party has been the consistent party of character not skin color. Thankfully we have  who helped minorities more..

This is such a sexist headline and story all together. Too ambitious?????????????? So Joe Biden was VP and now he‚Äôs running for President...is he ‚Äútoo ambitious‚Äù???? Oh no, he‚Äôs not because he‚Äôs a white male. I‚Äôm so TIRED! üôÑü§™ü•¥ #BidenHarris2020 I‚Äôll take it!
He is neither stable nor trustworthy and hes not going to give mom's Medicare for all like Bernie would have. They are voting against their best interests. Biden is center-right and that's not debatable.
U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin isn‚Äôt saying what her chances are to be picked as presumptive presidential nominee Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate.
Are you assuming Biden wouldn't run again in 2024 if elected in 2020?
Biden will change all that. He should change all of Trump‚Äôs policies in one far reaching executive order
It wouldn't matter if Joe Biden picked Katt Williams, nothing could induce me to watch someone debate Mike Pence. Nothing, never. Nothing can make that fun to watch.
50/50 Biden surprises us and picks a white man
To be fair to Harris, whoever ends up Biden's running mate *should* be solely focused on becoming President because that shit could happen any day.
God, how I wish we could replace Biden with you...
America is a failed state. Trump will make it way worse. Biden will make it a bit worse.  We are fucked.
Funny how Biden was chosen "because he is electable" but most endorsements start with "I'm no fan of Biden but..." or "He wasn't my first choice but..."  Almost like the whole thing was organized by the corporate overlords of the DNC instead of being organic.  ü§îü§îü§î
Donald Trump literally condemned Nazis, White Supremacists, and the KKK. Like 'literal' things matter to dishonest Leftists. I seem to remember Biden literally saying he DOES support de-funding the police. Not that he knows what he's saying.
Seen Biden lately?
Instead of trying 2 add more Putin Special Sauce 2 UR Biden nothingburger, how about investigate Tinklefuhrer  ignoring Russian bounties on American troops? Is it bcz share Russian loan shark AWA penchant 4 self-serving treachery?  flip this slider.
Brief bit of anecdotal hope:  I ran an errend to Watertown WI today. Mid-sized town in a very conservative, rural area.  End of July '16, practically every other yard had a Trump/Pence sign.  Today, I saw one sign for Trump. Four for Biden. And six for our Dem house nominee.
Of course he is. He got the goods on Hunter Biden. He‚Äôs ready to funk up  with sewer gas üí®
Good. They should. Let them hire private security, and let the world see how little Democrats support the police officers that keep our streets safe (when allowed to do their jobs, anyway). Trump's ad is 100% right. You will NOT be safe in Joe Biden's America.
Joe Biden. The candidate that will be the EASIEST for insane, crazy, violent wannabe Communist dictators to walk all over. Nobody is buying this crap.
Because it‚Äôs clearly a video from many months ago when Biden was campaigning in Iowa... hence the ‚ÄúBiden Works for Iowa‚Äù signs.
Try harder "unless we do something about this (busing), my children are going to grow up in a jungle, the jungle being a racial jungle with tensions having built so high that it is going to explode at some point.‚Äù
"Accuse the other of that which...."  -Goebels  Voter fraud concerns, Biden corruption accusations, FBI,CIA, NSA all corrupt, ...   Trump personifies nazi propoganda tactics.
Jaysus Aitch! I agree that Senator Harris isn't the best choice, but "too ambitious"? My one complaint about Vice President Biden was that he wasn't ambitious enough. A VP who visibly who wants the top job is valuable, indeed vital if the president wins a 2nd term.
This is pretty much fully what Biden's campaign is running on.
Despite the intimation of Trump's "Break-In"ad, the vast majority of police interactions with the public comes not in showing up to 911 call, but for TRAFFIC violations.  That's Biden's point:  Cops SHOULD be re-focused on violent crimes, not traffic violations.
"Vote for Biden! America will still get worse, just not nearly as fast!"
The unfortunate reality of this largely quite effective big tech hearing is that any action will probably delayed until at least a Biden admin at which point Obama‚Äôs technophiles will exercise countervailing influence
We should expect either Pence or Biden‚Äôs running mate to be elected president in 2024.   That‚Äôs surprisingly unusual. Last VP to be elected president was GHW Bush in 1988.
Does there exist a map of communities joe Biden has physically gone and interacted within over the span of the last 3-6 months?
It is well established that Joe and Barack had a frosty relationship during the 2008 campaign. But Kamala had the nerve to confront him at a debate - and it‚Äôs game over for her?
I am old enough to remember this. Do you think Joe Biden ‚Äúshowed remorse‚Äù?
I hope anyone Biden chooses is focused on becoming president in four years. He's said he won't seek a second term, described himself as a transition leader, and it's traditionally what the VP does. What's the problem?
This is dripping in misogyny. Apparently Dodd confronted her about her criticism re: bussing we Biden and she said, "That's politics!" and laughed it off. If he takes offense to that, boy, I don't know...picking Dodd to lead the VP selection was a mistake by Biden IMHO.
Her plus/minus there leaves out 75% of respondents, though. There's a benefit in that it gives Team Biden a chance to define her for voters who could be persuaded, but it can be risky to choose somebody with such low name recognition as well.
My best guess for next steps: 1. Poland will get more US forces as Germamy presence continues to dwindle (End of 2020) 2. Biden takes over and keeps minimal german base, and instead pulls out the forces elsewhere that was done during Trump's tenure 3. More special forces presence
I mean if I were a Trump voter I'd be shy about it.  In context of MoE I realize that 2016 was not because of shy Trump voters but never hurts to have a good fear of them.  Might be shy Biden voters.  I live in one of most liberal cities in US and have only Biden sign I've seen.
Good news though all the people with experience in taking to the streets will be locked up under a Biden admin per his own words so when trump does refuse to concede there will be literally nobody but gormless liberals to get out there and stop him. Good luck fellas
Robert Kasten: Joe Biden is nothing but a political opportunist
Joe Biden is the epitome of an establishment politician. He aims to be all things to everyone.
Biden‚Äôs team still struggling to come up with a more coherent message than ‚ÄúAnything Trump does is bad, even if we support it.‚Äù
The less I talk to neoliberal dems, the more my instinct to vote Biden comes to the fore, but then I get in threads with you people and I want to write in Thomas Paine.  YOU are doing your cause harm with self righteous fear mongering BS.
Last poll that asked the question found that people who trust Biden over Trump on covid are voting Biden on a 96/2 margin. He can roll back Obama orders all day but his numbers won't budge until he can convince people he's handling the pandemic well, and he can't seem to do that.
Remember, anarchism is not synonymous with chaos. At its core, it's a proposal for a radically participatory form of social organization in which regular people have control over the different aspects of their daily lives. Also, Biden is terrible.
Do we know that for sure?  This could be like the moon landing and all just staged in a studio or even Biden's own basement.
Milwaukee is where Biden will be nominated in 3 weeks.
Folks, if you have the means (time, energy, motivation, funds, any of the above) please help get out the youth vote in Georgia! GA is within reach for Biden. Georgia Shift knows how to do this. Let‚Äôs help them.
The version of NOMINATE I plotted assumes a fixed position for each legislator. The Nokken-Poole measure, which allows for change over time, doesn't show Biden trending left except for his initial stint at VP.
Selecting a former cop for VP really would be canon for Biden, wouldn't it? It's too perfect.
I‚Äôve seen enough: Biden/Biden 2020.
A look at the ideological positions of potential running mates for Biden based on roll call voting records.*   Demmings, Duckworth, Lujan Grisham, &amp; Hassan are nicely aligned w Biden.   Bass &amp; Baldwin are somewhat left.   Harris &amp; Warren well to the left.
Biden can cement his legacy in the annals of American History. It's also the right thing to do. Win-win.
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this turned out to be fairly accurate in terms of final spread. If you figure 3% third party and extrapolate these numbers you get:  Biden 51.5 Idiot who likes witch doctors 45.5 Other 3
Hell Yes!  #BuildBetterBack #EOsHereHeComes #46Day1   If he gets a presidential Day 1, Biden has a nearly endless list of ways to spend it - The Washington Post
MT &amp; ME Senate seats in cheap markets where Biden is less likely to buy.
Yes.  It‚Äôs just that I had noticed there are some states where Trump is still winning seniors, so have been less confident that Biden‚Äôs natl edge w/all seniors is solid.  I do think it makes sense that seniors in hard-hit states like AZ &amp; FL are abandoning Trump.
I still can‚Äôt believe some of y‚Äôall chose Biden like we had Bernie who was the last hope for the DNC but instead was replaced with its downfall üíÄüíÄüíÄ
In general I agree, but think we'll see how much Biden really respected Yang vs just paid lip service based on what happens with a position in his administration.
In some areas Trump is credibly to the left of Biden on criminal justice reform. That's how bad he is on some issues. Just stop blowing smoke up the left's butts.  We're not going to buy it no matter how polyannish you choose to be.

Btw I am not liberal so don‚Äôt assume that... I do not believe Biden can do the job either.
And also the fault of Biden supporters who wasted their time fear mongering/vote shaming lefties who will probably vote Biden in the end instead of doing ANYTHING to inspire turnout amongst the nearly 1/2 of Americans who never vote.
No, that didn't happen in '16. More Sanders voters turned out for Hillary than Hillary voters turned out for Obama in '08.  What happened was Hillary didn't inspire anyone so a whole bunch of low-propensity voters didn't vote at all.  If Biden loses it is on him and the DNC.
Check out all the liberals in the replies blowing right past the point of the tweet and replying "calm down, when Biden said 'anarchists', he was just talking about violent criminals"
I agree when they go low we go high.  But I'm going to let Joe Biden and the Obamas go high.  You can't beat Trump by letting him dictate the narrative.  So I am totally fine with Project Lincoln dictating the narrative against Trump so that he can't.
Amen to this. It's insane to me that people might choose to not vote for Biden based on his VP pick. The comparative is Trump. *Anyone* Biden chooses creates a ticket &gt; Trump/Pence.
Who Biden picks as his #VP has been as divicive as Berners are-It‚Äôs absurd. We don‚Äôt have vetting Info or internal polling like he does-but we know best, right?  When I voted Biden, I said I trusted Biden-&amp; his decisions 4 this Country.  That means who he picks as his VP as well.
Not sure what to tell you if you think Biden hasn't proven he's better at "opening his mouth" than the bumbling idiot we have now. Like, the bar has never been lower.
Let's be honest for a second.  Getting Biden elected is possible, but frankly, despite everything, still wildly improbable. We are a stupid and racist nation, and we love our stupid racist leader.
Yeah. Exactly. I'm getting tired of all this whistling past the graveyard everyone is doing.  Getting Biden elected is possible, but frankly, despite everything, still wildly improbable. We are a stupid and racist nation, and we love our stupid racist leader.

Hahahahahaha, Ron Johnson is too busy doing Putin and Trump's oppo smearing. Finding out the "truth" about Hunter Biden is more impt than doing his day job, or helping the country through this huge crisis of his party's making.
Bwahahahahahahahahaha!!!  "And he is the most progressive candidate since FDR!!!"  Just embrace that Biden is a very conservative Dem and run on it instead of this gaslighting crap. At least I could respect that.
Just saw my first Biden yard sign. Only one in the neighborhood.
Fuck around and find out.  Stop pestering the left and phone bank after the fucking "moderate Republicans" that the Biden campaign is based upon.  It will increase his chance to win. You talking to leftists decreases his chances.   It's like voting for Trump.  #JustFacts
How do they have language from Biden's announcement?
I sometimes make peace with it but then shitlibs pull out the same old recycled corporate sponsored fear mongering arguments or "Joe is actually as progressive as FDR" gaslighting stuff and my peace with it evaporates.  Fuck Trump. Fuck Biden.  Can I vote for Portland?

Joe Biden has entered the chat
Thanks for NOTHING, Biden and the Democratic Party.
Bernie is...older than Biden
Biden is a lifelong austerity politician as proven by his words and actions throughout his career. He has fucking bragged over and over about the crime bill and trying to cut entitlements.   Your gaslighting don't play here.
Then you'd better start pushing Biden to adopt some better policy positions instead of wasting time trying to fear monger/vote shame me.  If you don't do that then you're essentially voting for Trump.
For context in 2016 RCP average was Trump by 11.7 and he won by 9. So if anything the polls undersold the D candidate by almost 3 points. If these polls are close to accurate Biden has a great chance to flip Texas.
Yes, which is PRECISELY why we need leaders pushing in that direction instead of leaders who say, "That's too expensive" or "That's impossible."  Biden actively wants to go in the wrong direction.
2016 Hiillary was up by just about as much the week leading up to the election as Biden is right now. What Biden needs is the people who just chose not to vote, to help him win.
Are there any plans for a non-black mask offering? I love my black biden mask but it isn't great in the summer heat...
Karen Bass may be the most wonderful person in the world.  The most important thing to me is which candidate will do the best job of making sure that Joe Biden takes the oath of office on Inauguration Day.
I'd say I'm surprised but I'm not.  It's been 2 years of this bullshit.  Also ready for Biden's eventual AG not going after any of these criminals
Not so clever use of the word "riots" instead of protests, and mind blowing idea that this is somehow "Biden's America" while under Trump's 4 year rule:
Vote for this woman. Her primary opponent would rather see Trump re-elected than endorse Biden
The election is between Trump and Biden and somehow Rashida Tlaib can't decide who to support. She's always been the worst member of the Squad but this is something else.

Spencer Black: Biden's climate plan is smart policy and smart politics
I boo Biden frequently.  He was about 4th from the bottom on my Dem ranking (Tulsi...).  In many ways this is a 2016 repeat.  Hillary got my vote bc any other vote would have been ludicrous.  Vote Joe!
Biden‚Äôs recently announced climate plan provides a compelling divergence from Trump‚Äôs record.
Massive declines in revenues will not be made up by the states. Even if they were inclined to in normal circumstances, which they aren't, state budgets are getting destroyed by the pandemic and there's no federal help forthcoming, even if Biden is elected and Dems take the senate
Great use of  data. No, they don't fact-check a random sample of claims, but with politician's who've been checked this often the records are revealing
You see this Biden ad?
I wish all of my friends and followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Susan Rice Wants to Run for Office. Will Her First Campaign Be for V.P.? - The New York Times
Biden is tight with police groups that strongly oppose legalization because "I smelled an odor of marijuana" is a secret passphrase that allows them to brutalize anyone they please without consequences and they don't want to lose that tool. That's all there is to it
Like Joe Biden, every last one of his potential VP picks embraces a radical abortion extremism that puts them far outside the American mainstream and squarely in opposition to the values of Catholic voters.
If you think this administration is making any concessions to the left, you're a mark. Biden can't even be dragged kicking and screaming into supporting the least controversial CJ reform out there
The DNC platform doesn't matter even a little bit but the fact that they voted against supporting cannibis legalization by a 2 to 1 margin is very revealing about Biden's commitment to CJ reform
Final one: the part that sets me off is the gaslighting. The people who pretend Biden is progressive instead of embracing that the conservative Dems won the primary.   "Who is Biden going to pick?"   Henry Wallace or Joe Lieberman? Give me a break.
I don't really see Biden as a "one off" thing. I see Biden as another result of systemic corruption of the DNC by corporate influence. If that isn't attacked it is never going to change. That includes attacking it right now. Perhaps especially right now.
Like Joe Biden, every last one of his potential VP picks embraces a radical abortion extremism that puts them far outside the American mainstream and squarely in opposition to the values of Catholic voters.
But in the end, what it comes down to is this: I'll probably vote Biden because of "Trump."  But I'm not surrendering influence by "I'll vote Biden no matter what" 4 months before the election. To get Biden to move left will take 99% pressure 99% of the time, including now.
IMO the direct action on the streets has done more for police reform than 40 years of neoliberalism. All I'm saying is it isn't fully black and white that voting Biden is 100% better than a protest vote and no one is doing a good job convincing me.
Courts do influence my thinking and we're not going to lose them, they ARE lost. We aren't getting them back until we get a reformer and a candidate who says it isn't just Trump, it is the GOP and their DECADES long abuses that's the problem. Biden is pointedly "it's just Trump."

Consider this: Trump's approval numbers and polling versus Biden dropped after the George Floyd protests, not the COVID crisis.  What if the backlash to the protests has already happened and it just happened to hurt Trump?
*If* Trump were trusted more than Biden on dealing with the protests, I think this would be a legitimate concern. But that's not the case.
I‚Äôd like to see Biden grabbing the reins of Leadership for the People here &amp; now. Old school type Campaign isn‚Äôt gonna cut it! Here &amp; Now is the Time. Make or Break
Progressives and moderates, remember: #StrongerTogether! We have a broad party, but we share the same ideals. The Joe Biden of today is more progressive than the Joe Biden of years past, and he'll be a great bridge from hard right to our future liberal democracy.
I don't think we would have had a chance to get there if Bernie was Pres, but he would have pushed in that direction. Biden actively OPPOSES going in that direction.  Which is why I start to muse about other strategic considerations and it stops being black and white.
Like how since Obama won in '12 we ended up getting Hillary in '16?  IMO the BIGGEST risk of a Biden Presidency is he makes a Cotton, Pompeo or Carlson win in '24 much more likely.
(It will be because you waste time on twitter running after lefty's who still might vote for him instead of phone banking in an attempt to get centrists and "moderate GOP'ers" to vote for Biden.)  (That is Biden's campaign premise, BTW, not to get socialists to vote for him.)
***sigh***  Don't you people ever have any other arguments? "Trump" and fear mongering just says, "I don't really have any positive arguments for him."  Instead of bugging me, how about bugging Biden to adopt a health care plan that is as at least as robust as Hillary's in '16?
He isn't an environmentalist. Sen. Merkley is an environmentalist. Biden just isn't interested in wanton destruction like the GOP and oil state Dems are. If we don't push him HARD to do better, like appointing Merkley to EPA, he won't.  The only power we have is what we demand.
Ronna,  BunkerBoy isn't referring to Joe Biden.
Such a tired argument when 1/2 of America won't vote.  I'm trying to get YOU to accept that Biden &amp; Dems aren't going to save America. WE have to. Contact Reps, Sens, DNC and Biden's campaign to support better policies. Giving them power w/o accountability means we get nothing.
Biden could do a lot less campaigning &amp; show more leadership in real time.  If now now when?
Then you rioted for a lie because it was Obama and Biden who put kids in cages way back in 2014 and you didn‚Äôt care.
I mean...I just don't get it.  Biden won as the anti-left candidate.   Yet ppl are running around trying to convince us that Biden is soooo progressive.  It is silly. Like Biden's own campaign, they should be chasing the middle, not chasing leftists.
Became serious discussions because they were grassroots driven by "not even a Dem." Then the establishment coalesced around Biden &amp; attacking Bernie's ideas &amp; those ideas were crushed.  M4A polls at something like 80% but the DNC committee voted 125 to 36 against it today.
I mean...I'll probably vote for Biden cause the cost is nothing.  But my energies are going into grassroots and direct action strategies rather than fighting for him. (As strange as it sounds, I'm really not convinced that outside of 2 years, Biden winning is a guaranteed plus.)
An honest response &amp; appreciate this far more than the "Biden is the most progressive since FDR" crap.  Just sayin'  Biden was the anti-left wing candidate and he won. Why all these people are trying to convince me he is a lefty after that is silly. Chase the moderates, not me.
What has moved left?  I mean...c'mon man. Hillary's HC plan lowered the age of medicare to 55. Biden sets it at 60.  At best Biden is at the same spot on the political spectrum as HC was. Reality is that he is to the right of HC in many, many areas.
But many of us won't make it easy as we try to apply pressure to get real policy concessions, NONE of which we've gotten yet.  (That there is the quiet part loud)  If it isn't clear even if I cast a vote for Biden that I fucking hate him and his politics then I will have failed.
Who knows. The reality is DNC &amp; Obama thumbing the scale for Biden through inside political moves placed their bet that they could afford to lose leftists and pick up more in the center &amp; center-right. Same approach as '16, but Trump is hated more now.  (con't)
Who cares who backed who in the primary? It is Biden &amp; empty suit neoliberal austerity politics w/ imperialistic foreign policy against corrupt clown fascism that is too inept to enact most of its agenda. &amp; winner is likely to lose seats in '22. There are dynamics involved.
The way I predicted this when the DNC had the gall to call me yesterday and ask me to fund Biden‚Äôs election ü§¢ ü§Æ
My hidden concern: neoliberal austerity, which has ALWAYS been Biden's guiding light, ends up being insufficient and unpopular.  In '22 they lose A LOT of seats then Dems get trounced in '24 by a Tom Cotton type. 4 more years of Trump isn't my nightmare. Tom Cotton is.
"Our decision, made on May 20, is by no means a reflection on whether then-Senator Biden sexually assaulted Ms. Reade," Wigdor said in a statement.
I get the arguments. And as I started with will probably vote Biden in the end.  But the "it's completely black and white" is, IMO, both naive, condescending and a surrender of influence. There can be strategy involved that goes beyond unqualified support for Biden or Trump.
IMO direct action in the streets has accomplished more towards getting actual police reform than we've seen in 40 years. W/o wresting control of institutions of power from corporations, which Biden has historically empowered, electoralism is next to worthless.   (con't)
Biden is polling at 50% or higher in a remarkable number of battleground states.  There are multiple Dem Senate challengers doing so, too.
Biden is driving to Philly. He loses the keys in Nevada. Tom Cotton finds them and takes the wheel. He drives through a few humane society buildings and trades it in for a tank. Drives over 10 million Muslims. &amp; then bypasses the ocean to drive straight into hell.
IMO they really don't care. IMO they really don't care if Biden wins. IMO they care about money and personal power within the structure they already exist in.
The "leftist cult" leaders have said "vote and support Biden."  ü§îü§îü§îü§îü§î  Maybe it is the "I'll vote for whomever you tell me to in the end without conditions" crowd that is acting more like a cult...  ü§îü§îü§îü§îü§î
Maybe.   Here's a concern that doesn't get addressed: Biden gets in and neoliberal austerity makes things worse. In '24, an effective (Carlson? Cotton? Bannon?) instead of inept fascist gets into office and we are MORE screwed than we would have been after 8 years of Trump.
Biden is NOT center left, he is center right. We have a bit of an opposition party to Trump but not to the corporatism that the GOP represents. Freaking Pelosi, Schumer and a ton of dems have voted for Trump's police state funding priorities over and over. &amp; that's only 1 failure
If you promise me the republic is over if I don't vote for Biden then that would seal the deal. Just cast your vote for Biden and your mix of Dem &amp; GOP faves down ballot.  Then get excited when your new hero Rick Wilson runs Tom Cotton's campaign in 2024.
Liz üêçüêçüêç Warren. If Trump drops out and Biden dies, then we could potentially have Elizabeth "The Snake" Warren versus Jake "The Snake" Ventura!!!  Nope. Nowhere close to forgetting that Joe Arpaio's SUPER PAC helped fund Liz's sabotage of progressives.
Bernie gets a huge lead, largely because of M4A. Then all the shitlib candidates press their faux "M4A" plans and attack Bernie's. Then Obama and the DNC thumb the scale. And then the DNC says "No M4A."  And they be like, "Biden is progressive. You can push him left."  FUCK!!!!!!
DON'T TELL THE LEFT TO VOTE FOR BIDEN. Don't EVER try to pass off BS that Biden is "the most progressive candidate since FDR and can be pushed left."  Only tell the left to vote against Trump. Right now I'm more "write in Thomas Paine" than I was 10 minutes ago.
I WANT Biden to win but I also want to tell the DNC and the corporate hacks that control the party to fuck off. There is NO WAY I am giving unwavering support to Biden, that's just a non-starter. Don't expect it from the left.  I'm just trying to give some more helpful approaches
No. I am saying don't even argue for Biden with people far to the left, it just pisses us off. Stick to arguing against Trump. And for the DACA people. Specifically for the DACA people because it is hard to unambiguously argue that Biden is better for any other group.
As in the tweet I followed with: argue for the marginalized. Don't argue for positives with Biden. I have NO HOPE for Biden. None. Zip. Zero. Things WILL continue to get worse w/ him, just not as fast. Guaranteed.  But he offers hope for the DACA person who Trump will kick out.
I said I might in the end, the best it's going to get unless you get Biden to fully endorse M4A, green deal, a HUGE tax on wealthy or dramatically cutting defense. Any one of those.  But fair warning: your words here hurt your cause w/ ppl like me. Find a new tactic.
I believe Trump‚Äôs accusers too. I‚Äôm a democrat, so I‚Äôm fighting for my party. It‚Äôs embarrassing that 36 prominent republicans called on trump to withdraw in 2016 and exactly 0 prominent democrats in office have called on Biden to withdraw. The hypocrisy is palpable.

A whole bunch of liberals are going to be really confused when protests don't stop if Biden wins.
Election season is quickly careening into a standoff where Donald Trump will inevitably ask Joe Biden to take a cognitive test and it will just be a god awful embarrassing spectacle
Probably due to the fact that trump has been enabling racists whereas Biden got to hide behind Obama ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø and a lot of people don‚Äôt really know about him. Idk I‚Äôm just talking
Shame on Newsweek. Their heading is misleading. She is backing Biden.
I really don't care. I really, really, really, really, really don't want to vote for Biden but might in the end because Trump and the GOP are fascist. He is NOT going to pick someone far enough to the left to move the needle for me, that is completely clear.
Yep- I think the Powers that be are open to Biden if he can hide their Corruption? All road lead to Russia?

It‚Äôs incredible we‚Äôre applauding Biden for the bear minimum because Trump is a dummy.

Biden can lose both of those States and Still Win.   If Biden wins 1 of them plus MI the paths for Trump is minimal  Suburban White Females in traditionally strong Red areas of Wisconsin is what will win WI for Biden. Trump has lost more than enough of them  Biden could win both
Again, I think you‚Äôre skipping a step and I think that it really is as simple as a yes or no question:  Do you want another four of Trump?   If you answer ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not as bad as Biden,‚Äù ok, cool. Then your answer is yes, you want another four of Trump.  I don‚Äôt.
Trump is a cancer. Biden is triage, to keep the country alive. It‚Äôs not the best answer, but it‚Äôll be enough to get us out of critical condition so that the country can go back in and figure the better fix.
So you‚Äôd rather have Trump? That‚Äôs the question.   I think Trump is a cancer. Biden is triage and there needs to be a more permanent solution, but Biden gets us out of the ICU, so to speak.
Chomsky claims this presidential election is the most important election in the history of the world because of climate change, but does Biden really have a plan for that or is this more of the same disaster electoralism that Chomsky loves so much?
Huh. Curious. I don‚Äôt love Biden, but I‚Äôll take a middle-left, milquetoast, largely inconsequential president over a chaotic, divisive alpha male right now.
Biden's VP's rise to prominence began with being named TIME Person of the Year 2006
I really wish Joe Biden would announce his VP pick. We need some oomph. Right now. Please. #Biden2020 #BidenVP #TrumpOut2020
Part of me, a larger and larger part, unfortunately, wants Joe Biden to burn that goddamn garden to the ground on Day One.
Biden‚Äôs a reset. We can‚Äôt figure out the next step in the midst of Trump. It‚Äôs too volatile to build a foundation upon. Biden will be pretty innocuous, but we‚Äôll be able to at least figure out what‚Äôs next in a little more stable footing.
Real talk Garcetti mayor of LA said on a livestream all the dem mayors were coordinating response. So all the police brutality has been a nationally coordinated choice and Biden on that same livestream could have said ‚Äúno more brutality‚Äù and they‚Äôd have to listen. He said nothing
Regardless of what question is asked first in debate # 1, Joe Biden needs to say ‚Äúgreat question but first I need to ask the Prez, why the hell did you refuse to attend services for my friend Congressman John Lewis. He was a man deserving respect and you couldn‚Äôt show up? Why?‚Äù
Joe Biden‚Äôs ‚ÄúAgenda for Women‚Äù is an all-out assault on Catholic values:  ‚ñ™Ô∏èUnlimited abortion with zero restrictions  ‚ñ™Ô∏èMore taxpayer $$$ for Planned Parenthood  ‚ñ™Ô∏èRenewing the attack against  the Little Sisters of the Poor.  Shameful.

Plot twist: Biden picks Amy anyways
I'm glad this person is voting for Biden this year. I'd really prefer, though, that folks like Abe reflect on why they voted for Republicans in all of those other elections when the GOP relied more on dogwhistles than outright racism and hatred.
lol. SHE IS NOT AN ASSULT VICTIM!!!  Why did she not name biden? Why?
The emphasis on senators with foreign policy chops in the above quote is also directly contrary to what Biden himself has said. Biden specifically said he's looking for someone that will *complement* him, not share exactly the same strengths and weaknesses.
lol. She is a DOCUMENTED liar &amp; a thIef. She has zero evidence to back up her claim &amp; wouldn‚Äôt even name Biden in her sham of a police report. Why?
After seeing this new huge wall #Trump is erecting around the White House, I had a campaign thought: maybe Joe Biden should pose in front of the White House, borrow a line from Reagan, "Mr. Trump, tear down this wall!"?
What impact do you think Biden era revelations abt Trump &amp; family‚Äôs financial deals w China could have?
Would not be surprised to see Biden pick NM Gov Michelle Lujan Grisham. A Latina w both DC &amp; exec experience w whom non-Hisp whites would be comfortable. Her husband's death is a point of commonality w Biden. Mgmt of virus in her state may decide.
Don't bother. I'm sure Jill Biden will redo it.
Biden is going to pick a black woman as his VP. Why is this still being debated?
Biden's staff knows an appearance would be a disaster. Dopey Joe is a figure-head.
So Biden really just isn‚Äôt going to debate Trump? He‚Äôs just gonna tweet ‚Äúwear a mask‚Äù and that‚Äôs his campaign? You‚Äôd think someone with so many years in political power would easily beat Trump in a debate, especially with everything he‚Äôs done
Still bragging about POTUS identifying an elephant?  And you want people to believe that Biden can't?  The gaslighting has stopped working.
I'm a Kennedy Democrat I voted for Reagan because he was a Kennedy Democrat and become Republican when the Democrats went away from the norm for a Democrat I voted for Bill Clinton as he was a Kennedy Democrat I voted for Obama as he fooled me Biden no way!

Yeah, saw that.  Unbelievable, huh?  "Under Biden we'll have men AND WOMEN tear gassing and beating moms with batons instead of just all men. Thank God and Queen Pelosi!!!"
You should. I should. EVERY American that believes in freedom should be out there tomorrow buying guns, buying ammo, buying range time, training, organizing with their friends and neighbors to protect communities that Democrats WILL NOT! You won't be safe in Joe Biden's America.
Dems in 2016: Clinton leads by 2 points. Gonna be a landslide!!  Dems in 2020: Biden leads by 10. Gonna be close.
Thinking the same thing! This should  go in a Biden Ad!! üëèüëèüëè
Last I checked, Obama and Biden were on the same side. But please, do go on...
Let's put it like this, if their was a choice between Biden and Romney, I'd say their is a 85% I'd pick Romney or if he was alive McCain. I see China as a real military threat we are not taking seriously enough, and tRump is getting played like a fiddle and it's going to cost us

Trying to save face when Biden creams you?  How sad!
Their whole M.O. is tearing down other politicians that don‚Äôt meet their pristine standards. Then they wonder why Democrats very quickly coalesced around Biden in order to stop Sanders.
For the record, if Biden did this I would consider it the second strongest argument (behind "Trump") for actually voting for Biden.

You are a unicorn, no matter how incompetently tRump stumbles you'll be there. Your mind is sealed shut and you melted the key, do you realize this isn't a sports team right? I am not a Biden fan, never was but it's a LOT better than the dumpster fire your getting high on.
Why a Biden Presidency Could Be Bullish for Stocks
How is that joe Biden‚Äôs America when it‚Äôs under your term‚ùì
All Biden has to do is just SIT BACK....and let TRUMP HANG HIMSELF!!!!  With EVERY INTERVIEW...EVERY PRESS CONFERENCE....and EVERY TWEET...Trump shows the American Public just HOW TRULY STUPID, OUT OF TOUCH, and MENTALLY UNSTABLE &amp; DETERIORATING HE IS!!! #WORST.PRESIDENT.EVER!!!!
Feeling this tweet is not going to age well. Going to be 2016 again. The on the fence voters don‚Äôt want the Democrats far left agenda &amp; would rather deal with the current dumpster fire we have in office. Do better than Biden because that‚Äôs the only way your going to win.
1) A public option is better than no public option.  2) the status quo is undeniably better than Trump  3) I literally sent you an article about how Biden now wants a more 'FDR' than 'status quo' president anyway.  I hope you think about what I've said but I have to go. Be well.
Any Trump loss is going to be ugly, especially if its close. Biden really needs to win in a blow out so the nonsense is kept to a minimum. I'm nervous for what all of this is going to look like.
Yes, Clinton was bad for black people. But between Biden and Trump, one is trying way to hard to attract black voters and the other is effortlessly attracting white supremacists. Which do you think is more likely to work against the systematic racism Clinton furthered?
Biden is showing willingness to change. Ik he's still not Bernie or Warren, but he knows what the people want and is listening. Ik it's no guarantee of an FDR-level presidency, but he knows that's what we're gonna need from a Biden presidency.
Ok but in not voting for Biden, you are not fighting against Trump - who is a heck of a lot worse.  While Biden isn't Mr. M4A or UBI, he also isn't Mr. "Good people on both sides".  The status quo is lame, but when white supremacists support a candidate, I oppose that candidate.
Ok but your "all or nothing" nonsense isn't getting anything done either.  Yes, the establishment is what got us here, but the establishment is candyland compared to fascism. Unfortunately, we need Biden when his opponent is Trump.
What's your plan then?  The way I see it, Biden is a step in the right direction at the best and the only viable alternative to fascism at the worst.  What is the reasoning that leads you to the conclusion that not voting is helping the US move toward policies like M4A or UBI?
Apples to oranges. Biden's wide lead in polls has been sustained longer than any other candidate's in history. Still, everyone must vote!  Blue Wave!
Biden can do both at the same time. His cabinet will be made up of experienced professionals  ready to go on Nov 4th.
Exactly. If you look at MA primary in 16 and 18. The towns Warren won most are white collar/academia Boston suburbs that voted for Hillary. Arlington, Belmont, Brookline, Cambridge. There are lots of Hillary-Warre voters in MA. Bernie lost more votes to Biden than to Warren.
Oh, yeah, that crazy Marxist/Leninist/Stalinist/Socialist/ Communist/Fascist/Typist/Florist/Manicurist/Deist/Atheist/ Monogamist/Anabaptist/Knickers-in-a-Twist Joe Biden!  Be afraaaaaaaaaaid, be very afraid!
Don't you dare pretend Biden's status as 'establishment' is equal to fascism either in general or in the eyes of Carlin. Yes, he called bullshit on everyone, but he also had the critical thinking skills to know that fascism is a hell of a lot worse than status quo.
why we not votinf for biden? he really that much worse then trump
CBS/YouGov has Biden+6 in Michigan
You bet! The narcissistic psychopath criminal now in theWH will be gone &amp; Joe Biden will bring an astute experienced, empathetic leader back in the WH.
Donate, support and vote for Biden!! Let's get our Country back on track. #Biden2020
We already know what George Carlin would say about all the GOP grifters who‚Äôve latched onto the Biden campaign: ‚ÄúThe word ‚Äòbipartisan‚Äô usually means some larger-than-usual deception is being carried out.‚Äù
Former guv and HHS Secretary and current UW System prez Tommy Thompson totally dodges  when she asks whether Biden or Trump will win Wisconsin in November, instead takes the opportunity to say UW campuses will be safe and open this fall.
keeps presenting  as worth a damn. Biden is a corporate whore, loves war, love healthcare for himself, loves expansive criminal code.  says this means Biden is a "moderate." Democrats are hopeless, dump them now.
I am just glad we are arguing about whether Biden‚Äôs chances are either 99% or 92%. I still have people telling me they think Trump voters just don‚Äôt participate in polls.

Trump released a scare ad. about 'Law &amp; Order' &amp; 'police defunding,' despite the fact that Biden opposes the idea as silly. Trump is trying to distract from the COVID-19 carnage. Biden ought to respond using these "mobile morgues' &amp; hundred + dead doctors &amp; nurses.

Biden voters! Am I right!
THIS JUST IN: Kanye West says he can beat off Joe Biden.  Awaiting word from Biden on whether he accepts the invitation.   Story at 10.
2020 Trump vs. Biden.  2020 would be a fucking fantastic year to just eliminate the office of the President.
Admittedly I don't follow Biden or what he is up to, but it is pretty shocking how thoroughly he seems to be kept hidden.   Too bad we couldn't have had a candidate who could lead instead of a placeholder. Especially in these times of crisis in so many areas.
Is Biden controlled by his donors or does he AGREE with their agenda? I‚Äôm beginning to think it‚Äôs the latter.
Happy to let the Wall Street donors send their money to Biden. Wait, that‚Äôs my money isn‚Äôt it?
For one, Joe Biden is committed to increasing public research spending which will ensure more public funding for curing cancer and heart disease. Google his cancer moonshot initiative, he‚Äôs very in tune with what our country needs to do to ensure we‚Äôre curing local diseases.
The way the election calculus works in our system is a non-affirmative vote for the candidate closest to what you want is a functional vote for the one furthest from you. There are no other outcomes in this election except Trump or Biden as the President next January.
And yet, Biden's strong polling numbers continues to hold.   P.S. There's no such thing as Antifa as an organized force. No protesters arrested at any protest in the country have the authorities been able to link to "Antifa." Not one. All claims to such ends have proven false.
Especially since Obama and Biden left him a plan on how to handle a pandemic!!
Watch the video with Kira where Joe Biden "closes the books" on the Tara Reade case.  What a joke!! More to come on this!!!!
Yeah...you post this ant Joe Biden talks about nurses blowing air in his nostrils to get him up.   BIZARRE!!
I have a joke about Biden, you know, the thing?
I advocate for Dopey Joe as Biden's name, but after a flurry of this crap above: The Hollow Man. This POS stands for nothing except loyalty to health insurance lobby and other corporate interests.
Obama intimated he would hold Bush, Cheney et al responsible for the war in Iraq, torture, etc. But once elected, he didn't. My fear is that Biden would retain a lot of Trump's policies and not hold him &amp; his minions responsible. Biden must pledge to hold them accountable.
I‚Äôm an election worker plus we have absentee voting in Wisconsin so I don‚Äôt have to wait in any lines.  But if I needed to, I would stand in line for however long it would take to cast my vote for Biden &amp; vote Trump out of office.  AND I‚Äôd bring snacks for everyone! üç™üçøü•®ü•§üíôüåä

It's a fledgling fascist state at this point. If trump and the Republicans win in November, it'll be full-blown fascism. Everyone vote for Biden in November. This is our last chance.
One of Biden's main strengths is he's not a clown. I could see Trump turning it over to a boring Republican who had a better chance of winning.
Fact you aired dirty laundry. Is either a stunt or you don't have the courage to approach Dave. Prove Dave wrong. Ask Biden about getting prosecutor fired or the $1.5 bil Hunter got from China . How Joe's never helped black communities in 50 years of politics. Dare you!
Biden well ahead in an important state
I adore her.  Always have.  My problem with her as VP is from day 1 everyone will be talking of her 2024 run.  Biden hasn‚Äôt decided if he will run a 2nd term but with her as VP it‚Äôs all people will talk about.  (And some of the Kamala Klub are almost as bad as Berners!)
Biden people texted me today and I told them they could go fuck themselves because we want medicare for all.
You're 100% correct. This is Democratic paid for rioters. Besides keeping kids at home trying to cripple the economy. The Democratic Marxist Socialist think by burning down cities is gonna help Joe Biden win. So you hit it right on the barrel.

I love my lady Elizabeth Warren and wish she‚Äôd gotten the nomination instead of Biden
Do you need Biden to insult your family in order for you to support him? Because I truly don't think he would do that.
I never said they weren‚Äôt neither did Big Cat. What he does say is that he should have been made aware. Interviewing Trump/Biden 4 months before an election is also a little different. It would be hard for any media company to turn that down. That‚Äôs not the issue though

Lmfao what are you even talking about at this point? This is an moldy old article from last year, not the "breaking news" video you posted from last month, and the facts are pretty thin... "sources say" it's Hunter Biden, and published on a trash site
If there's a partisan conspiracy theory about Biden to chase down Johnson can't move quickly enough, but if his constituents are suffering he's content to sit in his house with his $millions and tell them things aren't really that bad...
He'd be in jail stupid. But at this point I'd still endorse Biden if he shot me in the middle of 45th street
Biden will cut it.
Did you listen? He is more upset that as a pillar of barstool and probably the one who makes the company the most money that he wasn‚Äôt involved in the decision. As he says he may not have wanted to interview Trump/Biden but he wasn‚Äôt even given the chance to say his piece.

If you believe all three of these high profile anchors assaulted the same woman you‚Äôre a clueless sheep. She‚Äôs the ugliest lady on Fox for 1. 2. Did you say Biden was guilty too or did you deny it? Haven‚Äôt you learned to wait til the whole truth comes out? ü§°
Deferments and not dodging the draft. You get Biden, Clinton and Bush did the same thing right? Go back to your basement
Being a Vet doesn‚Äôt give you pass on your opinion. I‚Äôm a Marine, so what? You‚Äôre too stupid to understand the definition of draft dodge. He had 4 educational deferments, same as Clinton, Biden and Bush. His last deferment was for bone spurs, obviously accepted. Dodging is fleeing
But GOTV as if Biden is running even...
I do respect that Sudeikis at least had a consistent "take" on Biden, kinda like the Onion's choice to make him a Jim Anchower-esque burnout, but it never really felt connected to the real guy in the way that like, Ferrell's W, or Carvey's GW were IMHO
