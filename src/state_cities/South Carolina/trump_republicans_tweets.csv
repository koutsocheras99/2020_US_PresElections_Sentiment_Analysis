That was cool. But Barr is just criminal. He misleads and distracts as much as Trump. They truly are quite a pair.
Trump knew that there was a risk to not wearing the masks which is why he had them sign waivers.

Love Trump
Talk to em! Donald Trump wanna be a dictator so bad!
Trump keeps talking about rigged elections? Does this mean that every Republican who is elected, and I hope it's not many, were elected because the voting was rigged? Does that mean all winning Republicans didn't actually win as some that was done was illegal? I'm just not sure.
I think the days of anyone believing Trump are over.  He has lied so often and so many times that no one over the age of 5 or with normal mental capacity will believe him.

Maybe. But Jeb also had great name recognition. But the media also gave Trump a ton of air time, and I think that worked synergistically with folks on FB, to get them revved up. Half of FB now is political it seems. The media more broadly helped him a lot.

YES!  I'm so sorry to say this but I agree with you!  Barr and Trump are evil and will think of something to take down our Republic just as Putin has ordered his boy to do!
Trump has no place there.

FLASHBACK: Conservatives attacked Joe Biden for predicting Trump would try to delay the 2020 election
To some degree, yes. But we’re saying for ex if Trump basically didn’t make fun of mask wearing and/or downplay it, maybe just maybe we could lessen death? Maybe he intensifies a cultural issue that does result in more death than necessary.
I think he successfully deflected the GDP drop. Look what's trending the higher. Trump knows how to control the media and everybody falls for it. SAD !

Herman Cain dying of covid on the same day Trump obfuscates 150k US covid deaths by threatening to delay the election is a third-act showstopper in some future playwright's shitty Hamilton.
I agree. But Cain showed contributory negligence by attending. The level of stupid among trump's supporters is unfathomable.
George Bush is one of the worst presidents in American history and Bill Clinton is a notorious adulterer, but they still get love at events like this.  After his presidency ends, Trump will enjoy no such privilege. He will not be remembered fondly by history.

Fox News figures mocked the idea that Trump would try to delay the election. Trump just tweeted it.
Trump told reporters they did not discuss the Russian bounty scandal. Indeed, the pattern of Trump’s favoritism to Russia is so marked that CNN today ran a story listing “37 times Trump was soft on Russia.”
Speaking of embarrassment: Trump has spoken at least eight times with Putin since news from U.S. intelligence broke the story that Moscow offered bounties to Taliban-linked fighters to kill U.S. and allied troops in Afghanistan. Trump and Putin spoke most recently on Friday;

No. HE made a statement by going to a Trump Nazi rally without a mask, and encouraging other people to go without a mask.  That he caught corona and passed away is merely a natural consequence of his actions, and of the President’s.  EVERY COVID death is a policy failure.

Trump says we should delay the election because it’s not safe to vote but it’s safe for kids to return to school? I’m so confused.
Trump does whatever he wants whenever he wants and has no consequences. If he wants to dismantle the post office and delay the election he is going to do it.  We just have to figure out what we are going to do when that happens.
Wow.  Just WOW...🙏🏾💔🙏🏾  Prayers for the family of former Presidential Candidate  who just lost his life to #COVID19 after attending Trump’s Tulsa Rally a few weeks ago.😷
This is the perfect tweet Bernie Sanders!! I couldn't have said it better myself!! You should have printed it in all capital letters! Thanks for making my day!! Donald Trump thought his letter was perfect, I certainly hope he reads this one!!
The last thing you want to do is politize a death, but had Trump cancelled or had he not gone to the Tulsa rally he would still be alive.
What should trumps new name be ? What is the opposite of robin hood ?? Robin Hood stolen from the rich , gave to the poor .. trump steals from the poor, gives to the rich !
How hyperbolic is it to say Donald Trump killed Herman Cain
This is a completely irresponsible tweet by  which only includes the information that only Congress can change the date for the election for president down under the photo of Trump. You need to provide valid context to his statements,  Delete your tweet.

If Trump has to step down suddenly for, let's say, health reasons and Biden's up against  Pence + Nikki Haley campaigning on a post-Trump reset of traditional Republican values like family, faith and opportunity for all, what is the Democrat's message?  Seriously. What then?
Simply put, if Donald Trump was a Democrat President saying the same things they would all be Democrats. If he was a Libertarian President they would all be Libertarians. Trump is a populist, not really a GOP, and his policies are often the opposite of traditional GOP views

I mean it’s fine to express your opinion on Joe of course. But imho the more relevant realization is how does Joe compare to Trump, since one of those two are 99.99% likely to be the next Prez. And Trump is of course horrible. So Joe it is. I didn’t vote for Joe, but he’s fine:

He tied himself too closely to Trump. People flock from all over America to retire here or move here for work and low cost of living &amp; taxes. But they aren’t going to just buy any old BS the GOP leadership and Graham throw at us. They treat voters like they are stupid. No mire!

What happens if, or when, Trump and Barr don't agree with the Election? Trump brings his Stormtroopers to the White House, and elsewhere, with Barr sanctioning it's legality.  Is Biden willing to call in the military to take back our country? I know people don't believe this!
Sorry, but there are an awful lot of Republicans who think Barr is doing a great job just like Trump, McConnell, Jordan, Munchkin, etc. Their logic escapes me. I have never been that blind!
Trump is evil. However, people need to grasp the fact he is not alone. He has co-conspirators in everything he does. The Congress and the Cabinet are as guilty, if not more so, than he is. As long as they are in office, nothing but the Orange figurehead will change.

Yeah, by letter of the law Trump doesn’t have authority to delay the election, but since when has he let that prevent him from doing anything? I won’t relax until (if) he’s truly out of office.

Cain attended the Tulsa Trump rally where he most likely contracted corona. Wonder if Trump will even bother to acknowledge he knew him? :Herman Cain, 2012 GOP Presidential Candidate And Businessman, Dies At Age 74
Many asking why Trump’s face is so orange. Let’s answer a question with a question: What color is the sky in the calm before the storm? Exactly. ORANGE. A STORM IS COMING. Will we evacuate like sheep? Or stay and die? I’ve said too little. Follow the money. #HurricaneSeason
Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so  😳
Trump can go to hell 🙄 We aint delaying shit! Get yo ass on
Looks like a bunch of idiots celebrating the fact that trump is single handedly responsible for hermain cains death.
Is trump capable of that level of self-awareness?
A Trump supporter talking about other people’s souls.  Now that’s funny...
Let me the first to say.  Herman Cain died because Trump insisted on having a rally in Oklahoma.  Trump killed Herman Cain.
Everybody a hitta until it’s time to hit George Zimmerman or trump

If Trump tries to distrupt the election, isn’t that an impeachable offense as well?
Jon Binet Ramsey family was into the Pedophilia as rest of them ...therefore using own daughter to entertain friends...and Natalie Holloway is going to be young woman kidnapped to be sex slave that was rescued that Trump referenced...so two families sacrificed daughters to it
I just want to make sure: you're wishing death on people you don't know because we think it's uncouth you throw childish accusations at a professional who provides information about exploited people. Is that the gist of it?
Trump installed a new head of the post office who is intentionally slowing down mail delivery under the auspices of "cost savings." So maybe he could do the opposite, unless he's intentionally sabotaging mail in voting....
So a term ends on Jan 20, and with no result, House picks POTUS, Senate picks VPOTUS. Wouldn't it be the disfunction that our system has become to have Biden as POTUS and Trump as VPOTUS? I mean, 2021 might tell 2020 to hold its beer!

STOP LYING!  If it was REALLY about protecting federal buildings, then they would send people to guard the BUILDINGS instead of ATTACKING the protesters with tear gas, guns and batons. Trump wants to punish those that aren't his supporters.
Don’t Underestimate Trump’s Union Appeal
The only poll that counts is the one on election day. Polls can be skewed. Subjective. I suspect many Trump voters are keeping their cards close to their vests...
Trump is not trying to delay the election. He is laying the groundwork for Barr to be able to declare it fraudulent when too many people vote "absentee".

President Trump suggested delaying the 2020 election in a tweet Thursday morning.

The Trump Crater
Five months into this pandemic and it’s not safe to send children back to school. I am having to homeschool my child this year due to Trump’s catastrophic handling of Coronavirus. Moms for Biden sounds pretty damn good to me!
How many did Trump go with?
Who would you want as a leader in a COVID-19 pandemic?  Reagan - Yes G HW Bush - Yes Clinton - Yes  G W Bush - Yes Obama - Yes Trump - NO  It’s not about party. It’s about human decency.
Biggest jokes of 2020: it’s a tie! This tweet and Trump thinking he’s going to win the election. ✌🏻
why do we pretend that trump and biden are writing their own tweets
Walter Cronkite thought he trained you better!
Scientists said April was most likely when Jesus was born but I’d prefer January 25th because of the stolen Election Kathrine Harris, Jeb Bush did on Al Gore. Biden’s people will try via mail in ballots sent to peoples pets.   BEST reason, better chance to have a White Christmas!
This video is so amazing. The problem is Trump supporters are too stupid to grasp the satire.
You absolutely failed us.. you did absolutely nothing for black folks.. It was a lot of killings on your watch and you could've set the precedent by actually punishing cops.. You just as bad as Biden and Trump.. And to think I actually voted for you
There are witness statements saying that the call memo released was accurate and provided a full recounting of the conversation. And nothing about it was incriminating. Trump didn't ask for something to smear Biden with and he didn't condition aid on anything.
There are choices. Why do you think the Gospel is full of those like King (and almost Lewis) who died?  As Pope Francis says, being political means being a human. Donald Trump is contrary to everything that is of Jesus. He does not love the poor, the oppressed. Choices matter.
Donald Trump should resign.  Pass it on.
But after all this, Trump’s half baked distraction of a tweet on election postponement is what drove this Federalist guy to jump ship? What’s really going on?
trump and Dejoy may have shown their cards too soon.
And while citizens have varying levels of critical thought, the conservative pundits can and will use this as leverage against Biden and co if they can make it look like they’re winning him votes. The director of the “Republicans Against Trump” PAC admitted to this on interview.
Don't get me wrong i want to do that but i fear that Trump will be such a sack of shit that my vote will be "lost" in the mail and it wont get there until after the election. any other election without a wannabe dictator i would
I’m a mild-mannered middle-aged centrist. But I will be willing to fucking burn things if Trump tries to delay the election.
I’ll stand with Lewis over Trump every day, and twice on Sundays. But I wish you well in these troubling times.
It’s more that they can use these actions to enforce the myth of a moderate, sensible Republican, and then use that to normalize their awful policies. You can see it when the Never-Trump conservative ads tout Reagan and Bush as “real leaders.”
1989: Trump took out a full-page ad, arguing for the death penalty for a group of black men (The 'Central Park Five'), effectively putting a bounty on their heads, and plaguing them with a lifetime of death threats. He was sued by the Justice Department for discrimination.
1973: The Nixon administration sued Trump for refusing to rent to black people.  1980s: Trump's casinos were accused of hiding the black staff when Trump visited.
2020: Trump called black protesters "THUGS" just days after calling white protesters "very good people." Then he threatened to direct the military to shoot the black protestors in the street.”  But Yeah Keep being stupid
2019: Trump tweeted that four black and brown congresswomen should go back where they came from. Then attacked Elijah Cummings. Then Baltimore. Then Al Sharpton.
2017 (3): Trump said people from Haiti "all have AIDS" and people from Nigeria would never “go back to their huts” after seeing America.  2018 (1): Trump called Haiti and African countries shitholes.  2018 (2): Trump referenced the trail of tears to mock Elizabeth Warren.

2016 (1): Trump called for a Mexican judge to recuse himself based on nothing other than his race. Paul Ryan said this was “the textbook definition of a racist comment.”  2016 (2): Trump regularly retweeted material from white supremacists and neo-Nazis during his campaign.
015 (1): Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists" who are "bringing crime and drugs" to the U.S.  2015 (2): Trump called for "a ban on all Muslims entering the U.S."
2010: Trump argued in favor of segregating Muslims in Lower Manhattan.  2011: Birtherism. Trump alleged that Obama was Kenyan based on nothing but skin color. He never apologized nor renounced that claim.
2000: Trump ran a series of attack ads against Native American casinos alleging (with no proof) that they were guilty of crimes.  2004: Trump fired a black contestant from 'The Apprentice' for being over-educated.
1992: Trump's casino was fined $200,000 for transferring black dealers off certain tables to appease racist patrons.  1993: Trump said Native American casinos shouldn’t be allowed because “they don’t look like Indians to me.”
1989: Trump took out a full-page ad, arguing for the death penalty for a group of black men (The 'Central Park Five'), effectively putting a bounty on their heads, and plaguing them with a lifetime of death threats. He was sued by the Justice Department for discrimination.
And heres a list of how all the time you're idiot president was 1973: The Nixon administration sued Trump for refusing to rent to black people.  1980s: Trump's casinos were accused of hiding the black staff when Trump visited.
"If Trump did this...." ugh you wouldn't be tweeting this.
Seriously?  Maybe because Trump yesterday vowed to protect the suburbs from the poor, and Lewis spent his life working for them because he knew the ways of Jesus.
Daily Reminder: Trump called the Corona virus a Democrat hoax that would miraculously disappear.
We also had a full lockdown that was a total failure. Many EU countries and now China has a second wave. And spare me the Trump/bleach narrative. He said no such thing. He recommended nothing and asked about disinfectant treatment, aka UV light blood irradiation therapy.

This is why trump is spouting bs about delaying the election - to divert attention from his disastrous economy &amp; loss of American lives due to his horrific response to #COVID19.
Let me get this straight, was their mail in voting during these times or did the people have the fortitude to stand in line and do it like it was meant to be done? So get it right before you make stupid comments because you know damn well what Trump was referring to!!
This is one of two tweets  used to react to the president's idea this morning.

The Dem side had 4 years of obsessive effort to make Trump look illegitimate. Amazing how ineffective that effort was.  All of the international relations meddling..legislative acting like executive.  It is so beautiful to see Trump use DACA to meddle with legislative affairs.
I’m very sorry Herman Cain passed away, but I’m also intrigued if the Trump campaign bothered making him sign that waiver.  #HermanCain
Mail in voting is already threatening the legitimacy of the election. Trump might be pointing this out clumsily and even dangerously, but it is worth pointing out all the same.
But they love America and trump supporters

No, it isn't the catalyst, or we would be seeing far more excess deaths this year compared to previous years. It may be catalyst for already unhealthy people, but not most people. And Trump wasn't making a declaration, he was giving an optimistic outlook. No virus can go to zero.

Here is what President Donald Trump said about a “delay” to the Nov. 3 presidential election.
Don't see the debates being much of a decision factor. People who like to see Trump's baseless attacks will have already been in his camp. People who already excuse Biden's incoherent rambling won't be deterred by more of it.
That's fair, I guess. But there are airplanes that let people jump out of them with parachutes. I choose not to fly on one and jump out. If I did, and died, it's not necessarily the pilot's fault. I know the risk. I despise Trump but people aren't moths drawn to a flame.

So, Trump wants to open schools (and everything else) immediately, but delay elections until people can "securely and safely vote." As usual, he is predictable and his motives are transparent, but I really don't understand why 30% of Americans will stand by him no matter what.
But the fact that he’s willing to consider it should be incredibly alarming and a sign for everyone to be vigilant against all the other ways Donald Trump will try to cheat in this election.
Trump is f💩cking insane
You probably thought Obama was a great president. Well, he was in power during the WORST economy since the depression. Trump has overseen the greatest economic recovery in our history. Our economy will recover stronger than ever if he is re-elected. IF Biden wins, it’s the dumps!
President Trump suggests delaying 2020 election
I’d rather Biden spend today talking to families about the economy failing. That’s the story today that will actually move votes—not Trump’s tantrum.
Hey  , Just speak the truth: trump was wrong to amplify this doctor’s opinions.  Then there’s no struggle at all.  Easy.
Trump cannot cancel or postpone the November 3 general election by executive order, under the parameters of a national emergency or disaster declaration, or even if he declared martial law. Please Read The US Constitution!!!!!

Trump 2020
Liberal? I voted for Reagan twice, Bush (41) twice, Dole, Bush (43) twice and Kasich in the 2016 primary. In SC state races I voted for Haley, Graham and Scott in the past. I worked on Republican campaigns in Michigan. Hardly a Liberal voting record. I just despise Trump.I just joined Twitter cause trump on here
The GOP and Trump are committing full on public Class Warfare and NO ONE who should be stopping them is doing their jobs
YES TRUMP 2020!!
That “eulogy “ was an embarrassment!  Obama reminding us why Trump is President to start with!
can we maybe sic Carole Baskin on Trump? She knows how to make old, rich, white men vanish with no trace
I was never a fan of sitcoms so I got to skip that horror, but I remember the press around it  at least Trump isn't yelling TIGERBLOOD while high on coke at press conferences.  though that would make them far more amusing
man, Trump has made me hate the word Winning :(  most all positive adjectives actually.  now I have a sad
What I see is corruption and 3 men who look guilty as hell. 🤔 And thank God we have Trump!
he's run this country just as he's run his businesses.  We all WATCHED him bankrupt over and over and now we are trying to act surprised that he's done the same thing, in effect, to our country.  My Cat is more competent than trump.  Patti for president 2020

Yes. And if a person has had cancer they should have the sense to wear a mask or not go to a protest. That's common sense. So it was not Trump's fault when people make their own stupid decisions.
Trump keeping Birx and Fauci around is one of the only things he's done that might have damaged him with his base. This man was known for telling people "You're Fired" &amp; had no problem doing it even in his own presidential administration until coronavirus appeared, but not them?
in 95 we will vote trump and hopefully  out of office. You stand for nothing Henry, what will you fall for? #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #NoMoreTrump
trump retweeted white power than deleted is. go educate yourself
The U.S. government dropped its effort to silence Pres. Trump’s former personal lawyer on Thursday, saying it will no longer demand that Michael Cohen not speak with the media in the weeks before his book is released.
Wonder what this man is man is up to. Trust Trump to always upstage someone.  Just petty.
Honestly, every day since November 2016 I wake up in disbelief that Trump is literally the president. Listening to Obama at John Lewis’s funeral today just feels like going back in time. It’s so awful that it’s now, and he’s addressing everything that has come undone.
GWB has more bodies on him that Trump. He’s a legit war criminal.
I want the psychological damage that being called "Impostor President Trump" or "False President Trump" in documents and when addressing him to haunt him to an early grave.  This is my personal curse on him
she really was and she absolutely warned us. But our country and elections are controlled by petty men who are scared of strong women, so here we are.  Trump has killed far more than they say she did.
A world where George W. Bush went to jail for war crimes, rather than eulogizing a civil rights leader and being praised for being unlike Trump, would have been spared a Trump presidency. Bush is responsible for way more deaths than Trump. Not even close.
and they don't yell every thing they say either. And we all know Trump would have made anything he said not about Lewis. but somehow twist it to be self aggrandizing.
Don't you get it Mikel? Democrats are lying about rut virus and plan on cheating to get Trump out of office. Remember Trump is right, you are wrong.
This could be the nail in the coffin for Trump. One of your political supporters dies because he attended his rally. This is wild.
At the Trump rally
I was alarmed that Trump suggested delaying the election. But then Very Smart People told me he couldn’t actually do that and he was just preparing to not accept the results of the election. Thanks, I feel better now.
He's gaslighting everyone.  He's doesn't want people to vote. We all need to vote him out in November.  This is the stupidest conspiracy theory he can come up with.  Trump suggests DELAYING election over claim it will be 'fraudulent'  via
Get real people. Both asses are no good for America. Don’t act like removing Trump is the answer. Biden and Dems want to be Marxist and Socialist. That’s not good for us either. There MUST be a better way!

Trump hates the USA.
punish America for rejecting our control. Trump is awful and he NEEDS to go, but the people currently in office failed to do exactly what they're elected to do. Protect us. Instead one group made a token effort and slandered his name, knowing full well that it'd never get past

I mean, at this point most of us would vote for a cabbage instead of Trump, so these are both funny and more accurate than some would like.  The sheer number of 'famous' people who've said basically "joe wasn't my choice but I'm voting for him now" proves this
Love my President Trump. And you will win.😍🥰🥰🥰
The Trump administration is considering a plan that would allow states to require mandatory drug testing for some food stamp recipients.
Trump seems to be exclusively running a “Willie Horton”-style campaign at this point. Thankfully (hopefully?) the country isn’t the same in 2020 as it was in 1988. I don’t think anyone is buying.
Trump 2020😁
Science? Wasn’t it the left that called President Trump all kind of racist for stopping travel from China early on???
The teachers unions are going to drag school openings all the way to the election!! Trump is doing all he can legally to open schools
They undoubtedly are not listening to him anymore.   Trump slaps down claims federal agents are leaving Portland
I don't believe him!  Trump: I DIDN'T talk to Putin about paying Taliban to kill US troops
And let me remind you when Trump Closed the Borders Biden said it was Rasist and if he haven't done it more people would have cought the virus and died
The poison is all coming from the left and fake conservatives like Bill Krystal. Trump didn’t NEED to do this and did this for the country. Why can’t anyone get that?
No, it shouldn't have been, particularly since he had no real business in the fist place.  But, as we've seen, they sorta just threw it at everyone but those who really needed it and if fucker bought a Lamborghini, he fit that bill as much as Trump scum of a son in law's family
Trump can show you how it’s done

You have no ideal why you hate Trump, did you hate Obama?People make up stuff about him,but yet he always prevail,stop imagining things and get a grip on reality,hes going to win again,so grab your tissue now.
You hate President Trump why?You hate someone who rebukes baby murder,the LGBTQ, same sex marriage, transgenders,someone who loves America?Obviously you're a Democrat, or payed by Soros or someone else to attack him,it wont work.
and planned, I think, this power grab and outright greed, long before Trump got in to office. He's not a pawn, he's in it as deep as the rest of them,  but they put him in place knowing he would do exactly as he's done
is there something like this or a list with examples of the politicians that have made exorbitant profit off the Covid crisis?  It's very obvious the GOP and Trump have partly let it go this long for that very reason.
I give up trying to explain to people who choose to be willfully stupid about HCQ why they're being idiots.  You have stressed me to the point that I no longer care   Have fun with your mass suicide attempt in the Cult of Trump  Just stop trying to take the rest of us with you
So far , being the Worst at Coronavirus response, is the only thing Trump is good at.2020 The year of the murderous president.
President Trump,  Dont expect these evil doers to change. Just win us another term and then hit them hard, even harder than 2016. No holding back...tired of playing nicey nicey...and get rid of these evil Nazi clones Fauci &amp;  Birx.
What actually is this? And you guys are scared of a Biden America? THIS IS TRUMP’S AMERICA...
Plot twist; it's the anti-Trump reelection activists getting "kidnapped" outta the crowd by the leftists that are paying them🤔
Trump has already decided he doesn’t care how many die, school is going to open. So no scientific basis there.
Trump has killed so many Americans. Still there is a group of uneducated, uninformed lily white hillbillies in the US that think he’s Jesus Christ. You along w him can go straight to hell! After what I just watched!!!

I’m certain. Was there a bidding process for this. What is the agreement entail? How long will it take to retool existing factories or build new ones? What drugs? How will it impact current drug prices, that are already insane? What’s Trump’s cut?
They've also just stated in that one move that all the things we need them desperately to do, to make real change, will not happen and they have been paying lip service and feeding on our NEED to oust Trump to get them the election  It may backfire and that scares me
and months ago was disproved, in legitimate double-blind trials to have no real effect. But Trump and the GOP are desperate to pull his sheep back in line before Nov so it's time to spread misinformation again.  What horrifies me is how many of you all just accept his BS
The Trump administration will deny new applications for “Dreamer” immigrants and cut renewals to one year from two years, despite reversals in court that kept alive the Obama-era program to shield young people from deportation.
But not accepting new recipients since losing Supreme Court battle.    Trump's administration will allow DACA recipients to renew protection
#Twitter temporarily limits Trump Jr.’s account over COVID-19 video
3.5 years into this presidency and the Republicans are still complaining. You won!! The Obama and Hillary obsession is really sick. And a sign maybe Trump isn't getting the job done if you keep looking backwards.
I am not lying I have been in healthcare for years and have been taking care of Covid patients and know first hand how deadly the virus is! You are naive and trusting an administration that does not care about you as a person or your daughter! Trump only cares about re-election!
Because of Trump 😤
The US stands for United with a federal government that should have lead in a united way but Trump did NOT!!!!!
Fredrick Trump was a pimp.
I agree. But people who follow Trump will be in trouble if they do.
“America will develop a vaccine very soon, and we will defeat the virus in record time,” Trump said.
We are arguing in the replies to a clown who complains literally every morning about a man who has been out of office for 3.5 years. But I’m whining? Conservatism used to be about taking responsibility. No more. The party of Trump is grievance and blaming others. Pathetic.
Yeah disgusting see Trump and those thugs burn down the country.  Why can’t ppl see Those poor helpless children are building a better future. One without history without painful responsibility or requires people to speak in proper racist English. The Orangeman is delusional.
I wouldn't trust anything Trump says. Wouldn't take this drug either
Do you think he would have visited trump if he was living and trump had died? We both know the answer.
You replied to me, so I guess I’m kind of a big deal. Please tell me more about these new trump converts and I’ll tell you about my imaginary Canadian girlfriend.
You are literally using the term “Trump’s America” in your tweet so it is obviously working.
With in hours of Trump falsely saying it was a preventive (it's not, even if it helps once infected you don't need it at home)  MANY states found they ran out and some places are still low/out of it.  I am supposed to be taking it, but because of people like you, I can't

President Donald Trump on Monday welcomed a Marine veteran to the White House as he completed his 300-mile walk to the nation's capital to raise awareness about the problem of veteran suicide.
this is basically my canned answer but hear me out: even Walter Mondale still managed to get 35% of the vote  If the guy who only won one state can only manage 35% of the vote, Trump can manage 35% of the vote, because there are enough people in this country who lack perspective.
77% of Americans are sick and tired of living in Trump’s America!
How exactly is Trump killing Americans? It’s BLM and Antifa and gang members killing ppl (mostly black). Stop watching fake news and think for yourself.
The GOP has been failing, apart from Trump, since I before I came of voting age. I was a junior in high school in 2008 and the Obama Revolution was taking my college-town Pennsylvania high school by storm. The GOP set themselves up to fail and haven't mounted a good counter since
Just another statement of why you should vote for Trump 2020!
I'm going to vote for Trump. But after that, I'm not sure I'll ever support another GOP presidential candidate
Why you're gleefully saying that I'm not sure. The LP is the only party that wants you to be fully free, all of the time. Plus they don't want to run up trillions of dollars in debt. You might want to check out the platform and the candidate in '24.   I'm a Trump supporter, btw.
I am Trump 2020 in South Carolina and proud to do it😊
Pres. Trump will be in NC today to visit a company that is doing crucial work in the ongoing effort to develop a COVID-19 vaccine.

I can’t tell you what he didn’t do. The wall blew over, Portland is a war zone, Coronavirus has been ignored to the point that the country is dying. Russia is killing our soldiers, and fatass trump is playing golf.
It's about time someone on the Left says this. However you have to phrase it I guess. If this is really what Trump wanted, he would have gone in a month ago. But if this gets these stupid fuckers to stop burning shit down, it's worth it I guess.
I realize that it started in China, what I was saying that we did not have a complete lockdown of travelers coming from China or EU! Therefore the virus spread worldwide. Trump’s failure was that he didn’t have a national response, speaking with one voice not 50 state voices!
The virus that has infected the east coast and southern states came from EUROPE after it traveled there, no shut downs on European travelers or Americans coming from China, Japan or South Korea! So u keep singing the Trump talking points! They have no validity!
Trump is going headlong down the fascist rabbit hole! You need to get off Fox , OANN and QANON web sites! Investigate the basics of your beliefs!
I am a health care professional and understand more about the spread of viruses than u apparently do so who is your CCP boss? Trump propaganda sycophants?
Trump and Melania are not sending Barron back to face to face classes, nor is Ivanka sending her children back! So why should American moms send their children back before this virus is under control??? Trump does not give a shit about others children!
I would trust Dr. Fauci over trump any day ! Trump has compromised the CDC! The return to school requirements published by CDC after Trumps Administration wrote them are useless! Trump does not care about the children or if they take Covid home to their family!!!...
Not sure how Trump recovers himself on COVID w/o a mask mandate. A drug or vaccine isn’t coming that fast, even on accelerated timetables. The reason I bring up a mask mandate is, well, the 70%+ of the country that says we should have one.
What exactly do you want Trump to do?
Maybe. I don’t see a Propagande Due story plant helping Trump here, though.
Folks thought the same thing with Trump.
Not good. Q-Pac had Trump +3 in a poll that mostly took place in early July. Marist had a Clinton +7 but it used RV. Every LV poll in Florida in July showed some kind of Trump lead.
I really, really need y’all to understand something...   Voting for Kanye ensures another 4 years of Trump.

If you don't vote for President Trump then you are more stupid than we thought about you.  Vote for all republicans this year. Control the virus, get rid of democrats.
Is it just coincidence that Biden tells his staff not to trade right before Trump strikes this huge Kodak deal? Is there the possibility that Trump or his people profited greatly from this and Joe plans to use it against him?
Great.  I was in Dallas two weeks ago and saw 2 Biden yard signs in my mother’s neighborhood.  I saw 2 Trump signs, as well, but Dallas County has become blue since I left in 1994.  Need to turn it red this fall.   I also saw Hillary signs in the ultra wealthy Park Cities in 1996
Why doesn’t Trump get rid of Fauci?   Sure the media would howl like a pack of hyeanas but they have been doing that for 4 years anyway.  Maybe he wants the people to see the fraudster for who he is.  That’s all that makes sense to me given Fauci still has public support.

President Donald Trump's proposal to build a wall along the border was a major feature of his campaign and he has since attempted to have congress pay US$18 billion for its cost in the short term
Many citizens including Democrats and members of the Republican Party who do not support president Trump argue the necessity of border escalation
Fucking nonsense. Liberals tend to be champions of social safety nets, stimulus to citizens, healthcare, etc. Politics are ALWAYS about power (even for Republicans), but Liberals seek it to bring up the standard of living for EVERYONE. Trump &amp; his circus are definitely a problem.
I wish all 350,000 of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I followed you.
You rock Kayleigh!!!!!! Trump 2020!!!!!!
President Trump was being sarcastic idiots!!!!!!
Ageed 100%. Trump, Biden, it doesn't matter as long as you're a decent human being.    Aren't many of those anymore either....
Truth train. That's the only train I want to be on.  Trump don't care about us just like no other president has democrat or republican. Yall be so optimistic about the weirdest shit.
Trump is the greatest Villain of all time!
From now on I call it the Trump virus.
From now on I call it the Trump virus
I have shut my mouth way to long. I am sick of u damn liberals. I feel like y’all never had a parent growing up. Now that Trump is daddy and finally spanking ass y’all rebel. Don’t like it here in America fucken leave. TRUMP 2020 mother fucker!!
And it isn’t cancel culture. A country taking steps to evolve and change isn’t cancel culture. Cancel culture is millions of inbred fucks demanding a football player loose his career because he kneels during the national anthem. Mr. Trump should learn the difference.
Well it was voted on and passed by the house and senate, with a truly impressive veto-proof majority. So this tweet is meaningless perfunctory for his mindless worshipers to have something over which to sing his praises. He’s a literal fucking idiot lol.
Dude you literally just explained exactly what Obama did to the Trump campaign!!🤣🤣🤣  #trump2020
Both were bad.  We are still in Iraq and Roberts is still on the Supreme Court.   Need Trump to be reelected so we can replace a couple of more justices.  Granted Thomas and Alito may retire but there is no way Ginsburg lasts 4 more years.  Trump could get 3 more picks.
Not interested in your plan to make this a socialist country and shred the Bill of Rights.  I’m voting for President Trump.
So I guess Trump sending forces finally got you to acknowledge you have a problem?   You could have insisted on peaceful protests a month ago.  Why didn’t you?
I hope in 5 years when Trump is out of office that we finally learn who is on the Q team.  It will likely remain a secret but I know we all want to know who it is.
I don’t know about y’all but I instantly get mad anytime I’m behind a Trump supporter. Like just out and let’s fight
Don’t let Trump Steal the Election. Demand 100% voter ID and in person voting!!!!   😜
Trump: The Second Term
And what about Trump referring to it as the China Virus? We're just okay with that?
But this IS America under Donald Trump.
The libs are the masters of projection....so between riots and the China virus, the only ones actually trying to stop people from voting are the libs.....so they have to start claiming Trump is trying to stop people from voting. They have some gall.

The one you’re speaking of wasn’t swept under the rug. The attorney for that woman requested dna from Trump as recent as March 2020. I don’t believe her claims for a couple of reasons which I won’t say because I don’t victim shame. If he did rape her 25 years ago she was 50 yrs

If they don't want him to enact the INSURRECTION ACT OF 1807, take his help. The Democratic leaders don't want the conflicts to end. Their hope is if they win in Nov., they will recall their ANTIFA goons. Claim peace attained through their leadership, and Trump was incompetent.
They will believe it but "We" will vote President Trump back into office for another 4 years!!!
And what do you mean race baiting? You that seperation people are causing by saying there is white privilege when there isn’t? And what you’re seeing is in fact just bullshit people want to cause to encourage trump leaving the office?

Do your research. The pictures of trump with a little girl was his daughter. These evil people have fought tooth and nail the entire time he’s been in office to try to get him out. If you can’t see that I’m sorry for you. I’ll pray God gives you discernment soon we all need it.the military should have to pay for the funerals of all fallen members regardless of if it is a military or private funeral.

Will Trump start tweeting during   eulogy?
I will never understand how anyone can defend Trump. Never! It tells me all I need to know about them
You forget the numerous times EX-President Obama accused individuals of crimes when in fact they were innocent. He reacted too fast without facts. He was worse than Pres Trump.  Dems lies are true while Reps truths are lies. So sad
I see they wasted no time at all blaming Trump for Cain's death.

I live in Charleston, S.C, I just watched a commercial for Joe Biden and they played a video of President Ronald Reagan giving the are you better off than you were four years ago speech! POTUS Trump forbidden from using Reagan but left can? SHAMEFUL!

Wow...drinking the Trump juice. Trump is a racist, and at of the protesters that are destroying stuff happen to be white,  but I guess you missed that. I pray that we vote his dumbass out of office.
I wish trump would get Covid and suffer terribly. He deserves it.
I AM VERY RICH, i was cashing a TRUMP check
A racist leader like trump.
Hell is waiting on trump.
Sorry he doesn’t even respect his ass kissing GOP, he turns on them in a split second the minute he needs something they can’t give him. Makes one wonder if trump died tomorrow who would show up at his funeral. His own family probably wouldn’t even show up.
The same way the Republicans and other racist Americans spent 8 years trying not to accept that President Obama, a black man was POTUS. So, please spare us your ridiculous commentary. If Trump loses, you all will be nuts. So, FOHWTBS.
Dear black Republican Candidates...Obama is gone from the White House....and is not coming back.  Jobs, Infrastructure, Entrepreneurship, Trade Schools, strengthening public and charter schools and prison reform score points.  Trying to sound like Trump isn't enough.

Biden loves this, he's been playing typical liberal game.  Blame Trump for this unrest &amp; riots.  But all riots &amp; looting, destruction. Are with Liberal leaders of Governor's &amp; Mayor's. Nothing is going to happen until Trumps intervention.
Hey Joe, enjoy your false lead, because President Trump voters will come out of the woodwork when November gets here, and hopefully this will be your last failed attempt to become President. BTW, VP Pence will get 2 terms after President Trump! 😎

An unarmed Mr. Bernell Trammell was standing in front of his "Vote for Trump" display when someone shot him in the head and killed him. Because of this cowardly act, I'd love to think we've gained over 50,000 new trump voters!!! Thank you Mr. Trammell for your sacrifice!!!
Who cares if they spied on each other’s campaigns? This is clearly another Trump distraction and all news sources need to take the name “news” out of your names. You don’t cover news. News is supposed to be unbiased but it’s always one sided politics!
Mr. president. America knows what you have done in the past. We want to know what you plan to do with the future of America. We want to see the Trump administration's plan for ending the virus and getting America back to work. God bless
WAKE UP KIDDIES! THIS IS WHAT WE ARE UP AGAINST! PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO MURDER YOU BECAUSE YOU DON'T SUBSCRIBE TO THEIR BELIEF SYSTEM!!!
They want this, to blame President Trump.  American people know better.
The government has been taking away our right and deliberately harming the constitution way before Trump  was ever in politics.
Barr needs to be removed from his office. Why is he still allowed to continue breaking laws and covering up for trump. So damn corrupt. They belong in orange jumpsuits behind bars.

This gentleman was on Rachel Maddow’s show last night talking about this very thing. It was very interesting and dead on about trump’s destroying America.
What you mean the lies will end, the chaos would finally subside and trump can be charged with all the corruption and crimes he broke. Damn guess it’s a damn good thing I’m voting Blue down the ticket. Start packing trump your ass is going to prison.
The Black #MAGA grifters goal is not creating wealth or opportunities in the community they constantly bash, their ultimate goal is for Trump to retweet their post.  They act like it's a lifetime achievement award.
It’s a damn shame you aren’t as concerned by the injustices as you are by being a loud mouth ass like trump. Grow a pair of balls pussy boy. I see you still suck up to trump even after he attacked your wife and your father.
I’m educated too thanks. Go Trump!
President Trump has been attacked from day one and he is very defensive because of the way he's been treated. There are some things I would he wouldn't say but I fully understand that animosity over this long-time of contrariness
Our government would run much better with some sincerity. It just can't be possible that everything Trump does is wrong. What's on my mind the Democrats look ridiculous. Unfortunately the media seems to play along.
One of the main problems with the Democrats and the opposition use that they oppose everything can have no credibility in their arguments. They take some really silly positions just because it's contrary to what Trump says.

Notice the #MAGA grifters are NEVER summoned to the White House during the Presidents economic Summitt.  They criticize the Dems for bad policies but yet they don't make demands to the Trump Administration for ANY TANGIBLES for our community.
tRUMP won't hang it because it is a CONSTANT reminder of his inability to be even a decent person, let alone being so unpopular.
She wasn't dreadful as a Governor, but with all things Trump touches, they die and wither
Oh dream on, you’re spreading horrible lies just like trump. trump is the only madness America is dealing with. He’s the reason so many Americans are dying, he’s got blood on his hands because he did fucking nothing in the beginning.
Bet you he won’t lie like trump did. Voting for Biden and Jaime Harrison and Joe Cunningham. I use to have respect for you but now you’re just another trump suck up. Thank God I never voted for you.

This is Trump's America, not Biden's. Biden believes of the people, by the people, and for the people. The people are supposed to be in charge of the government, not the government in charge of the people. That's called democracy, Dumpling Donny.

I think there is this fear of being put in the history books as an enabler for Trump's fascism if Biden loses. He has seen the news for the last four years that has blamed him, and if it happens again, whether deserved or not, he's internalized it.
Trump closing the gap. Wait till the live debates start and it’s over.
NASCAR you are America promote The GOP and President Trump. Bump the Democrats aside and put the Liberal agenda in the pits!

Rest easy, he’s not the antichrist.  Just your run of the mill, morally bankrupt, would be dictator.  The antichrist will set about making peace, deceiving the nations of the world, before being revealed for what he is.  Trump only deceives the ignorant.
He just proved that he isn't doing his job to help protect Americans but is doing his job to protect trump.
Flynn is guilty. Trump fired him too.. everyone forgot that ????
The attack by the Obama administration on the Trump campaign and then the Trump transition team is one of the biggest and most dangerous scandals in our history. And it is definitely the most covered-up scandal as the media are just the propaganda arm of the Democratic party.
Thank you. On a smaller scale Aran and Iraq fought each other for years (Border wars). Russia Daily shells their former satellite nations. We really have tried to keep the peace. The sooner Trump sends these Socia-Commun- Islamists packing the better.

I sincerely hope that after Rep. Lewis is laid to rest that  comes out with an unequivocal and scorching retort to Trump floating the delay of the November election. Trump must go!
He can’t do this and it should only be talked about or reported on in this way . Congress sets the date of elections and Trump’s term end Jan. 20, 2021. Period! He must go!

Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan #sickmayor is saying President Trump  is using his riot control measures as a political ploy. What does she think she is doing? This is about all human lives and this BS has to stop.
Walks like a duck, quacks like a duck. He's a Democrat based on his actions. Hasn't stated if he will vote for Trump yet, either.
Trump administration took action yesterday to follow-up on his Executive Order from May. Good step in the right direction, IMO.
Another violation of the first amendment! Loved seeing that Trump administration is questioning whether Rule 230 of the CDA still applies to these platforms. Keep fighting and spreading truth.
The extremely obvious difference between Biden and Trump's mental acuity is impossible to deny. Keep in mind that due to Donald Trump's brother dying from alcoholism he vowed to never drink or smoke. Looks to me like clean living pays off later in life.
Just saw this inquiry sent to the FCC about Rule 230 of CDA.
When voting straight party ticket on November 3, the ballot should have three choices: Democrat, Republican, trumplican. trump knew which party he could take over. Which party he would be able to play on their weaknesses.
You would think they would only go so far, but no now they're literally risking they're lives in order to prop up Trump's words

Oh Barbara how I miss your interviews
We already see this whole Presidentcy the same way. If trump... yeah literally ANYONE
why does every trump supporter type the same way on twitter?? I’m half convinced they’re this collective hive mind  moreover why do they feel the need to preach their love for trump in anyone’s face like he’s the second coming of christ? hello?????
If Joe Biden becomes the President of the US, will he be a better replacement for Trump?  #trumptrain #potus #makeamericagreatagain  Get Rizzle at

This was part of the Clinton Cabal's anti-Trump dis-information. Killary started that "what if he doesn't leave?" BS. She began circulating among her minions again recently. They are still under her spell, apparently, unthinking morons.
Denise, I think  has it right. Trump never said inject. He did say "injest" like inhale or ventilate with disinfectant, or maybe UV light.
This woman believes gynecological problems can be caused by demon sperm. She is a Trump hydroxychloroquine "doctor."
She’s never been elected to public office. That was a talking point used against Donald Trump. How is that countered?

This drug works... Twitter deletes video promoted by Trump on hydroxychloroquine use for coronavirus
Also listen to Trump's interviews on the radio with Howard Stern.
As usual, follow the money. Remdesivir doses are very expensive. Hydroxychloroquine and Zithromax are both very cheap. #FireFauci he's conflicted and part of anti-Trump manipulation of data to keep us locked down, IMO.

More true than ever. The Dems are launching everything they have to finish Soros' attack on our republic. Trump is only avenue to fight back and keep our country non-Socialist, IMO.
I think Trump initiated the feud. But honestly, Lewis was an example of the need for term limits, IMO.

No Democrat has won the white vote since 64%. I remember too well 2016. I don’t care what polls say 100 days out. The media will help Trump to make this closer. I mean look at the coverage of another mentally ill man running, Kanye like he’s viable.
Y’all listening to John Meacham and Michael Steele Democrats? Fear and Smear works.These protests that devolve at night,white protestors taunting police, that stupid “defund the police” slogan all play into Trump’s hand. Democrats have not won white vote since 64. Remember that!

Get your head out of Donald Trump’s ample ass. Almost 150,000 Americans dead and his ass golfing . I haven’t like Brett Farve since he spent money from the charity in Mississippi and got caught.
Dear Lord I hope so. Trump’s version of America is a perversion
Narrative changing from COVID-19 to violent crime just like Trump wanted. Stop playing into his hands. People lighting shit on fire don’t give a damn about BLM . Get rid of their asses!
writes well with absurd premises to create his false narrative. No, Trump didn't aggressively invade these cities experiencing rioting and death. This is not an attempt to impose martial law. Dem mayors and police officials are allowing, even encouraging violence.
Same here in the U.S. Dem governors keeping lock downs in place to hurt Donald Trump's re-election chances. Meanwhile, we have a ventriloquist's dummy of a candidate in #DementiaJoe. Emergency is over. Time to reach herd immunity to get back to work and school!
Are y’all going to answer the lies of Trump about Joe or simply keep going after Trump?
so you’re not going to focus on the fact that the increase in crime in under Trump or that it’s a lie that Jor Biden is for defunding the police? Seriously ? Thought you were a “journalist!”
Drop the pretense and just vote for Trump. If you don’t vote for Biden, you are voting for Trump, period!
Still awaiting further details on the outspoken Black Trump supporter in Milwaukee that was also killed. Too bad it's so hard to buy more ammunition these days...

The election is about being suckered thru Joe Biden unsus. Or president Trump.
I know a bunch of them and some who are lying about not doing it again. We can’t survive another Trump term.
Welp Eddie Glaude coming up. Much as I love Ali, I gotta go. Not listening to a man that left the presidential ballot blank knowing who and what Trump was in 2016 lamenting whats he’s doing in 2020. GTFOH

Donald J. Trump:  It's too dangerous for a one time convention, but by all means send YOUR family to a "convention" that meets eight hours a day five days a week.
I believe Trump and his team chose Chicago to get footage of his GI Joe toys beating black people and Albuquerque to get footage of them beating brown people.  This wasn’t implicit. They must have said it out loud to each other.
Thanks to all for the concerned texts and DMs 45 sending his goons to ABQ. I’ve heard from folks back home. Yes, they’re worried. Yes, they’re mad. Yes, they know they’ve been nominated to be props in Trump’s campaign ads.

Correct. Biden represents Sanders/AOC's socialist government. This is an absurd argument to choose Joe. Trump is the only choice to preserve our constitutional republic and restore our economy from the COVID manipulation by Dems. #DementiaBiden's VP "pick" will make this clearer.
Biden only wants to continue what Obama signed into action. Ben Carson has delayed implementing the 2015 changes.
No this is not the caravans! What Trump is doing is real. Trump is a clear and present danger to our Democracy. Been saying this for years and NOW y’all believe. That fence around the White House is to keep power! He will try to rig this election.

Don’t think for a second they care. It’s election year, otherwise Trump would’ve gave it all a swift veto and “kiss my ass”.
Quite obvious it has been exaggerated to take down Trump. Look at how aligned ALL the MSM (and Fox) are with respect to fomenting the panic by reporting cases, not deaths. #VoteRedToSaveAmerica2020
Mika doesn't even ask a follow-up question about "fumigation" or Trump not leaving after the election. That not leaving thing was made up by the Clinton Cabal and  is dragging that ragged concept out again. Sadly we have no term limits when mental capacity declines.

Trump being a petty narcissist doesn’t bother me. It’s not ideal, but I can get behind his policies, way more so than I could the dems. Also, The media is entrenched in every part of our daily lives. Believing otherwise is a disservice to yourself  and the power of their reach.
Trump is flawed, this is for sure and says/does plenty I disagree with. However, rewarding MSM for their outright lies &amp; manipulations can not be tolerated. I’m as middle of the road as they come, but to see the way the MSM has abused their power has only made me back Trump more.

The thing that is really sad here, is that she had a stellar chance and a fabulous career. She did everything right and then she did everything wrong. It is really a very sad story. She can thank Trump. But at the end of the day, she is totally responsible for her actions.
Nikki, I don’t think you can pull this back. Ever. But if you don’t try now, you will never have a chance. Trump is going down. Biden is going to win. And you are going to be history. And every one is going to remember your unconscionable fealty. Not very smart.
Trump sucks.
People even bringing Trump into sports and situations he has nothing to do with.
NO: Dems ARE destroying our economy in an effort to both make Trump go away and get total $$ and Power over the subjects
Joe---like all politicians, you find fault with everything Trump does.  But, like all politicians, you never say what you would do right now and moving forward to fix what you perceive to be wrong.  So, quit complaining unless you are prepared to do something about it.
As the media focuses on Trump's silly comments on his cognitive test, what is happening at USPS is not getting enough attention. And it's really important for small businesses, seniors, and voters.

Time the voted differently. Trump did not do any of this in three years. And yes I expect BLM to use the billion plus dollars they have collected in donations to help people. Instead they use the money to support the same democrats that got you where you are today
Donald Trump isn't a doctor or medical expert. He landed 2 people in the hospital for touting that Hydroxychloroquine cures the virus. He doesn't know shit.
When asked if he spoke to Trump regarding upcoming election and sending "troops" Barr refused to discuss his conversations with the president but then Barr said he would decide which cities. Unless I missed something doesn't this mean he did discuss with Trump?
And just like that Mary Trump dumped by the media and democrats.
Even if he does lose, I imagine they (the hardest of the hardcore Trumpers) will deny it. He’ll start his own TV network to the right of OAN which will be a mixture of conspiracy theory craziness and Home Shopping Network selling all manner of Trump branded crap made in China.
Donald Trump is not a leader,he doesn't no how to lead,leaders tell the truth.

Since trump is getting upset with trending on twitter just go for it resistors

If wearing mask is so great then we should never have shut down our country. Fauci told President Trump they didn't work. Fauci said staying home would contain the Virus. Now it's masks they're saying is slowing down the spread. Which is it people?
Trump has bots...lots and lots of bots. Plus there is the significantly large group of folks who follow him to get the jump on making fun of him.
Anyone who even momentarily thinks  is the idiot in this scenario has not witnessed Mr. Schmidt's verbal thrashings of Trump. Trump is without the mental acuity to even respond. Trump will always be the idiot when a grown-up is in the room.
The same way the Republicans and other racist Americans spent 8 years trying not to accept that President Obama, a black man was POTUS. So, please spare us your ridiculous commentary. If Trump loses, you all will be nuts. So, FOHWTBS.
It would be glorious.  Sadly...Trump will never agree to a true debate.

One day (hopefully soon) when trump is a former president, it will be interesting to see how he handles events when all the living former presidents are gathered. Will he have the nerve to attend?
Democrats with their green energy deals killed coal. Trump brought it back of course they love Trump. Democrats never create they only destroy because their socialist who want to rule everyone’s life.
The real question is can Trump run again if he’s defeated in November. Scholars say yes, he could and become elected again. God forbid.
They still have not figured the genius of Trump! 😂
The only bad thing about it is Trump put one of his sycophants in charge of the post office to deliberately try to delay mail in the hopes of disqualifying ballots.
i feel like trump smells like mothballs and axe body spray
Doubt it due to protocol for a dead former President even though it’s tRump
Spoiler: I LOVE Trump is sadly not an option.   #MAGA2020
trump was about to say “I want to stand with my head high...” as the newly elected president. but went off on a tangent. he is absolutely paving the way to declare the election a “hoax” if he is not re-elected.
Trump claiming he’s gone into the election booth for years. He wants us all to compromise our health knowing he’ll be defeated otherwise. Moron.
Trump is the goddamned virus.
Trump: you’ll be waiting around for years to count mail in ballots. Riiiiiiiiggghhhhhttt....moron.
I read a Brookings piece yesterday on how Trump is already a lame duck. I wouldn't be surprised, amidst all of the insanity of the times, if Section 4 of the 25th Amendment is invoked as an effort by the GOP to stanch the party bleeding down-ticket before November.
Far more we’ll spent than military, trump business bailouts, and money to publicly traded companies who pay not even 1 percent in taxes.   I will be taxed on this assistance, and I’m willing to pay it.  What good is our government, if they can’t help and protect its citizens?
Yeah, by letter of the law Trump doesn’t have authority to delay the election, but since when has he let that prevent him from doing anything? I won’t relax until (if) he’s truly out of office.
does trump have a bunch of holes in his face or is that just my tv's pixilation

Not 100%, especially after Trump wants to delay the election now. I will say that the voting system needs a serious overhaul. It has too many holes in it that makes it a potential problem for fraud.

I was disappointed in Obama's eulogy which veered from the intent of a eulogy. The Dem political talking points sullied the former president's Lewis oratory in his 41-minute speech. Perhaps Obama was unable to resist taking shots at Trump and Repubs. It seemed unseemly to me.
Such a “Drama Queen” or “Drama King”! The majority of the citizens of the USA have totally have had enough of Trump!!! All of us are continuing with our regular General election. Trump doesn’t have the authority to alter the election date. He is so pathetic. Shows he’s unprepared

Then they’d demand an election, which may be after January 20. At noon on that day, his powers dissolve and the Speaker of the House becomes President; probably Pelosi. Trump could fight it, but that means hundreds of thousands of civil servants forsaking their oaths. I doubt it
Hey!...DoD doesn’t operate that way...these moves have been on the books a long time...even before Trump.

He confessed to a felony because he knew he was guilty of even more serious offenses.  The case wouldn't have been dropped if Barr wasn't Trump's personal fixer.  Can't wait until it's all made public on you Senator.

Trump saying he is considering moving the election date would be a tiny hill for Republicans to stand on and say they disagree  The same Republicans that scream "constitution" about gun rights should be yelling the same since it says Congress decides when we vote  Fucking cowards
That will never happen. Republicans are Trump - for life.
The GOP is a coalition. Every party is. Realistically, not everyone in the coalition will be a Trump loyalist and you can’t expect them to.   The success of the GOP has been credited to our big tent qualities and shedding that will mean electoral ruin.

President Trump asked Americans to hold up Frederick Douglass, among other heroes, during his July 3rd speech at Mount Rushmore. Given his 2017 reception of the "sons of bitches" that chose to kneel during the National Anthem, I immediately thought of Douglass' own words.

Far more we’ll spent than military, trump business bailouts, and money to publicly traded companies who pay not even 1 percent in taxes.   I will be taxed on this assistance, and I’m willing to pay it.  What good is our government, if they can’t help and protect its citizens?
Yeah, by letter of the law Trump doesn’t have authority to delay the election, but since when has he let that prevent him from doing anything? I won’t relax until (if) he’s truly out of office.

I was disappointed in Obama's eulogy which veered from the intent of a eulogy. The Dem political talking points sullied the former president's Lewis oratory in his 41-minute speech. Perhaps Obama was unable to resist taking shots at Trump and Repubs. It seemed unseemly to me.

Trump saying he is considering moving the election date would be a tiny hill for Republicans to stand on and say they disagree  The same Republicans that scream "constitution" about gun rights should be yelling the same since it says Congress decides when we vote  Fucking cowards
That will never happen. Republicans are Trump - for life.
The GOP is a coalition. Every party is. Realistically, not everyone in the coalition will be a Trump loyalist and you can’t expect them to.   The success of the GOP has been credited to our big tent qualities and shedding that will mean electoral ruin.

Nope! I voted from abroad for many years while living in the UK. Vote by post is good enough for our military and citizens abroad - it is also a solid option now! BBC News - Trump calls for delay to 2020 US election
President Trump just floated the idea of delaying the election.
President Trump suggests delaying the election.
Thanks Mad King Trump   ...you plan is almost complete. Implode the 🇺🇸 from inside out and hand over to Putin
Trump needs to put Dr. Stella in charge of the FDA and move the headquarters to Area 51.
Who cares about Syria while Trump is destroying America!
It's those voices in his head again...someone, please tranquilize Mad King Trump!
Best Trump impression ever!
Even with demonstrations, deaths, incompetence, and corruption, the #1 story trump's absolute submission to putin's master plan of deconstructing NATO as a market and defense force. The most successful post World War II alliance is being dismantled because Putin directed trump.
Yes- Why is the Trump controlled FDA blocking this? Trump needs to fire Hahn and put Dr. Stella Immanuel and Dr. Peter Navarro in charge of the FDA. It’s all under his control.
We get it...Mad King Trump following orders from Master Putin. #TraitorTrump #TrumpThreatensAmerica
This is a red state, a bunch of trump worshippers. The Karens’ are like roaches here, falling out of the walls around this place.
Tell Trump, Barr, et al.
It’s poorly made and cheaply made by a building full of child slavery in China. Besides that he’s too damn obese for that too small of a cheap poorly made jacket. That ladies and gentlemen is a morbidly obese trump.
Twitter had suspended DonJr. over a CV video, Twitter defended their decision to block &amp; restrict tweets even from our President!(Unreal) Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called for the genocide of Israelis, that passes for “Commentary” Trump’s tweets “Inspire Harm”😡
Trump’s pee pee look like a shriveled carrot
Trump 2020
Quote from the Traitor in the White House.   "Trump also cited previous U.S.   “Well we supplied weapons when they were fighting Russia too. You know, when they were fighting with the Taliban in Afghanistan,” Trump said. “I’m just saying we did that too.”
Apparently you're not seeing America from the deckplate...and haven't for a very, very, very looooong time.   I am anti-Trump...he is destroying this country. However, Biden and the rest of the Neoliberal establishment Democrats brought us here, to this very point in time.
