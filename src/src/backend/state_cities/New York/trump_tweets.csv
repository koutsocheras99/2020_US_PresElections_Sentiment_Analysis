Another failure by trump. At a time the world must unite his lack of leadership creates enmity with the closest allies of Americans. Exclusive: Germany and France quit WHO reform talks amid tension with Washington - sources - Reuters
Unfortunately this is the truth due to the current administration. We have total incompetence running rampant in the WH. And everyone in the Republican Party kowtows to Trump, especially Moscow Mitch. Purely to further their own political agenda.
Nothing funnier than watching the bots behave exactly how you'd expect them to and read "China and Iran pushing for Biden's election and Russia pushing for Trump's election" as "BOMBSHELL NEWS proof Russia wants Trump to win reelection omg his followers don't even care wtf"

Either Donald Trump lacks a basic knowledge of what is appropriate Presidential behavior or he is just plain malicious  As POTUS, you don't use the WH for a political rally  As POTUS you don't use a support group at a golf resort you own at an official press conference

That was already a thing that Trump stopped, and he's claiming nobody had ever done it before, but President Obama HAD already done it.  This is pathetic to pretend this is any kind of an accomplishment for Trump.
Let's not delude ourselves here : The GOP is sabotaging negotiations so Trump can play Santa Claus and claim credit for Covid relief. Just as he put his signature on the stimulus checks, he will allow his Party to plant him on Third Base and then Tweet about how he hit a triple.
Jim remember you are not suppose to call out the bullshit trump spreads. You should be just saying how great he is just like  at the Trump News Network!!

It's never a good week with Trump.
Trump finally seems to have a plan to replace Obamacare.  He'll call it the "Affordable Care Act" and have it include protections for preexisting conditions.  He draws a lot of the inspiration for it from his wife Melania's speech from the 2008 Republican National Convention.

Yeah, that's why you and Nancy "Ice Cream" Pelosi turned down President Trump's offer to temporarily extend the $600 a week unemployment benefit. Because you "care about Americans". You only care about your liberal agenda which is Anti American.

You just pulled a Trump. You passed the buck to schools, didn‚Äôt adjust guidelines (even added testing component!), &amp; provided no addt‚Äôl funding. Now if schools don‚Äôt fully open, teacher unions will be blamed. Spineless.
Remember the infamous Hollywood Access Tape in which Donald Trump said: "And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the pussy."  During campaign, that same DJT "star," paid hush money to 2 women &amp; now alleges Biden will "hurt God" Really?

Projection to English translation: Trump is a fraud. Daddy bought his seat at Wharton, he‚Äôs bankrupt 6 times, he‚Äôs travels to only his properties. His critics are more intelligent, moral, &amp; honest. No wonder he seems like such a pariah. They view him for who he is #Thighland

So the food critic says it‚Äôs bad when Trump thinks kids can go back to school, but 1 week later you suck Cuomos dick when he says it‚Äôs ok. I live in NY, unlike you, and am good with my kids going back, but I do not respect Cuomo and his handling of the situation.
You are mistaken. I knew a Wharton classmate of his. He stated that Trump was just as much of a buffoon then as he is now. He only passed on Daddy‚Äôs money, not on his own merits.

Hyperbole aside, compared to in-person voting, there are scores of opportunities for people/groups to commit voter fraud through the mail-in system. Trump‚Äôs use of the USPS for check distribution - a system comparably less susceptible to fraud - is a clumsy comparison.
There is no one reason Trump won, and it's obvious that a decrease in black voter turnout coupled with an increase in white voter support in key swing states together were too much for Clinton to overcome.
The first known case in the US was January 15th...before Trump did a thing...not his fault...but, he's spent the past 7 months downplaying the severity of this, and spreading lies, despite repeated warnings and factual data and recommendations from the world's top health experts.

Oh, really? You recognize Trump as a permanent threat to our democratic institutions and as a result you're "very seriously considering voting for Biden"? Then by all means, he should tailor every decision to your individual preferences and also explain them in the ways you like.
But don't worry! She's "very seriously considering" a vote for Biden. A second Trump term may damage our democratic institutions beyond compare, so the alternative is vaguely on the table for S.E. Cupp. By all means, then, Biden should make every decision with her in mind.

TRUMP HAS A SECRET POLICE FORCE #GOPHypocrisy
American. Which is why trump wants to divide us. White supremacists can only include people who view themselves as white supremacists. "The Blacks," means all black people are the same group with the same ideas and lives. Trump uses "the blacks," to craft a descriptive.

Donald Trump isn't trying to WIN the black vote, he's trying to SUPPRESS it. Many black voters stayed home in 2016 (for myriad reasons), which redounded directly to Trump's benefit - had the black turnout been the same as '08 or '12, Clinton likely would have won.
And how many would have been saved if we had this simple mandate since February?  Instead Trump flipped it into a political issue  - only 'snowflake' Dems wear masks etccc
This one wasn‚Äôt written by me! But the few articles I‚Äôve written covering Trump when it‚Äôs related specifically to gaming things have required some delicacy, I‚Äôll say.

Trump isn't going to get the Hispanic support that DeSantis got and he isn't going to get the I-4 corridor. I'd say Trump has about a 25% shot in FL he's the underdog
1.2% is not a large gap and enthusiasm in 2020 is tied bc Democrats are VERY enthusiastic about voting Trump out of office. In every Presidential election since 2004 FL has been 3-3.5% more R leaning than the nation. If Biden wins the popular vote by 4+ he wins Florida
Ignorant Americans in the Trump cult represent the worse of America
It still hurts
I have 2 questions: 1. Who is John Lewis going to vote for this November ? 2. WHEN President Trump wins in November, on what charges will the the Democrats try to impeach him the 2nd time ?
She‚Äôs probably not that smart, but is smart enough to know that Trump supporters are really dumb.
FL leans far more Republican in midterm elections than it does in Presidential elections bc the statewide GOP is more popular with Hispanic voters than the nationwide GOP is. Trump is not going to get 44% of the hispanic vote the way DeSantis did.
The worst part about me is that I‚Äôm an never Trump R. Who would be open to voting D if they gave me a candidate worth voting for lolololol
Yeah. If Trump had done his job and acted on the CDC recommendations at the beginning, instead of denying there was a problem, she probably would have had fast and accurate testing.
But  even if I said, "The white people," I included people. Trump removes our humanity by calling us "The Blacks." Just say black people. Black American's. Or African American's. But he won't because he wants to divide the nation on race.

I would stay through the night to vote against trump, with a mini fridge and a space heater. Yes I would
No one expects a magical wand wave. (Although Trump did say HE thought it would just go away)  There are many many people trying desperately to make him follow the better plans that are being shouted at him.  He is ignoring the problem.
You‚Äôre pivoting. Max‚Äôs assertion that Trump‚Äôs use of the USPS to deliver checks proves he trusts them to deliver votes is a fallacy. If a check doesn‚Äôt arrive, you cut and send another. What happens when your vote it lost?
There were several sworn witness statements corroborating her allegations...funny how so many people have been lying about what a disgusting human being Trump is for the past 50 years...
Trump doesn't care and if he did, he's too stupid to know that.
Trump was credibly accused of raping a 13 year old, with his pal Jeff Epstein...the case was about to be brought to court, when she suddenly decided to drop it...the week before the 2016 Presidential election...she's repeatedly said both Trump and Epstein threatened her life...
You‚Äôd think that Trump would spend these precious weekends in strategy meetings with his campaign team, but no. He‚Äôs mailing it in.
That will be the reason to discredit it. They need something easy - "What does he know?" Much like defending Trump's lies with "all politician's lie."
You think Trump is an embarrassment...have look at Biden???

Last year I saw the ‚ÄúTrump Train‚Äù which is nothing more than a decorated semi. It was broken down on the side of the NYS Thruway right near the PA border. It made my day.
The CDC has recommended masks for 126 days. Trump has only wore a mask once. Half his supporters don‚Äôt believe in the virus and think it‚Äôs the ‚Äúdeep state‚Äù so blame cuomo while his state is getting less than 500 cases a day.
BLM and The PEACEFUL PROTESTERS are really just a mob of THUGS who can not stand on their, and needtht gang mentality to thrive. And the LIBTARDS promote this practice. Until the Left can get some balls &amp; deal with this problem our only hope is Trump and a Strong Right
I knew I'd get this response, but Biden's faculties aren't even the point here. Trump's voters look at him as their avatar, a representation of themselves. Insulting his intelligence is insulting theirs, and it's terrible praxis.
Oh, look... Joe Biden crumbled under a false accusation by Trump and rushed to have a response written in defense of his ‚Äúfaith‚Äù. None of this shit should fucking matter in 2020. We shouldn‚Äôt even have religion anymore, but rubes keep it around. It should NEVER be in politics!
The Trump admins CDC made those guidelines that cuomo and Murphy followed. Turning off power and water is only for people who break the law. Now let‚Äôs look at the GOP, Kemp has his cases rising the fastest in the country, he has no plan, no testing strategy...

It's actually an interesting article. Is it a real strategy by Trump or just campaigning? Will pharmaceutical companies actually look to make a deal? Obviously something needs to be done but if Trump has a plan here no one seems to understand it.
That's a lie. There are lies, damned lies, and Donald Trump.
Pretty sure Joe could handle that, no problem. Trump would just keep spouting gibberish, as always.
And why would trump listen to Navarro over Fauci and Birx? He's an economist. Why would he listen to him over the WHO? Over the CDC?  I'm baffled at your line of thinking. Sadly, you're not alone.
Because it goes directly to the charities he‚Äôs implemented. As opposed to Trump and the Trump family, who host charity fundraisers and pocket the money.
You cherry pick 2 countries. They did well, yes. I guess being small land peninsulas with tight borders is good for a global pandemic. How about the other 200+ countries? Trump control those too? Like he controls the 50 states?  No one knew how bad it was. That's revisionist BS.
Great, and then Trump can turn around and ask Biden if he can define them.   This Democratic intellectual elitism has GOT. TO. STOP.
I would like to see Jonathan Swan use the same approach with Biden as he did with Trump. A handful, you can‚Äôt be serious. He has decades of saying racist statements.
Key word there, coherent.  Trump saying incomplete sentences of nonsense and 'it is because I say it is' doesn't count as a coherent argument.
There was a parade a few weeks ago too.  Hundreds of boats out on the water.  The great people of grand island love Trump, and I told Melania. These are great, great people

It kinda doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs bullshit. The fact that Trump is even engaging on COVID and *acts* like it‚Äôs a serious issue should improve his approval ratings on the issue by net 5-10%. The bar is really that low.

Show me one!!! Just one cause trump just bought 8 tons of merchandise from China for his resorts so my question is who is supporting China ? #TrumpFailedAmerica #TrumpHasNoPlan #Trump2020 #TrumpVirus2020
No, tRump called himself a war president. If he believes we‚Äôre in a war against the virus, then the national response is his job. States don‚Äôt have the resources to do it alone. Otherwise, why have a president at all? He serves no purpose.
I can't believe our two (most likely) choices for president are Donald Trump and Joe Biden.
‚ÄúThe Milnes now fly a Mexican flag (next to the Saltire, the Scottish flag) outside their home, within view of the Trump clubhouse.‚Äù
Trump 2020
You do know that every country that had a successful response to the virus had a coordinated national response. Only tRump can use the law to order companies to make PPE, but he said "I take no responsibility". He‚Äôs useless.
While American politicians are attacking Xi jinping for trying to dictatorship the Chinese people forever, in fact, Trump is also thinking the same way and fantasizing about ruling the United States until he dies.
I dunno man, Tiktok kids trolling Trump and stealing hashtags from white supremacists are awesome. Frankly, there needs to be a max age to stop all the "share if you love Jesus" spam, fake news disinformation, and boomer memes from flying around out here.

For the Trump supporters out there who might not be very intelligent; protections for pre-existing conditions are part of Obamacare a.k.a. the affordable care act!
So that means that my latino vote will not count. Or I have to vote for Trump so it can count. Because trust me we are a lot of Latinos ese.and our vote is very important to the American people and the new President being elected. üò∑‚úå

Listen up WHITE WOMEN come in close: Ain't nothing Trump can do to save the day we wouldn't have this day if it wasn't for him stop waiting for black women to swoop in a save you save yourselves by voting all this incompetence out Trump and all the other mother suckers got to go
When I kept seeing posts about Whitmer, I got pissed. Then  got a grip and reminded myself that I am voting for the president, not the VP. However, if he picks a white woman, my vote will need to be translated as "against trump," rather than "for Biden."
LMAOO you care about that but support trump who‚Äôs objectified women multiple times on tape you just hate BW

Mine did not actually. I am paying 300 dollars less now. Yes the ACA doesn't and was not designed to cover everyone. It was just in the end Obama caving in to insurance companies. But the pre-existing provision is already in the law that Trump's trying to get rid of
Obama hurt the working people &amp; senior citizens. You like him bcz he gave money to the banks &amp; Carlos Slim of Mexico(Safelink) They in turn hurt small businesses &amp; individuals by eliminating lines of credit &amp; interest.The stock market was flat for 10 years until Trump came in.

That‚Äôs 77 days of Trump unhinged &amp; unfettered. He‚Äôll do all but invite Putin to the Oval Office to run the country.  Trump‚Äôs mental illness, mental decline, drug addiction, fear and desperation doesn‚Äôt take any dastardly option off the table.  Emergency removal will be required.

Why would the msm report the declining cases when they are actively collaborating with the Biden campaign to take Trump out? Beside Fox news, CNN &amp; MSNBC did not carry the press briefing live because they want to nitpick for talking points to benefit Biden.
Just like Mary Trump said, he does this, calls people his killers and gets them feeling like him...
Biden Is slipping? As far as I'm concerned Trump has crashed already not as a man more like a coward that he is, blaming Xi, he and anybody else who is not hiding behind a tree for his own failures.

Snickers asks me every Morning if Trump is still President. Every day I tell him  Yes, but not for long. Then he starts purring.
We can have no dreaming idea of the breadth and depth of Trump's dirty dealing when he is  such a, in your face, thieving criminal on paper. His arrogance and ego + his "under the table, off the books" scumbagery would be truly incomprehensible  by any metric.
100% my hypothetical teen is not socializing in person or babysitting in a pandemic probably anywhere &amp; especially not in a Trump house when Trump is preaching dangerous antiscience.  There is no presumption of safety at all in that scenario.Because Trump is the racist gaffe machine on a perpetual apology tour for his irresponsible remarks about black voters.üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
And you still don't have a stimulus package for the American people. We just want what is fair. We don't want extra military spending to replace what trump stole for his wall, or a new FBI building or to remodel the white house.

Shocking that some geo-political goings on do not include Trump or the US. So arrogant.

Trump is a desperate character.
Pls show me the tape from Fox News that corrected Trump when he falsely stated for 8 yrs. that Pres. Obama was not a citizen and had a fake birth certificate. The MSM constantly called him out on that fake news he was spreading. I ask who was spreading &amp; corrected the fake news?
Trump is banning Tik Tok through executive order? Can he do that?

3. On any of these issues? Isn‚Äôt it relevant that Donald Trump is a race baiter, and that his rhetoric is both dangerous and deceitful? Not once, not once in this episode did Donald Trump‚Äôs bigoted behavior or his lies come up.
2. Or his general incompetence. You simply let them present Donald Trump as a reasonable president, with viewpoints that are outside of the mainstream an unpopular. Donald Trump is much more of a menace than that, and you know it. Why in the world didn‚Äôt you challenge your guests
1. I am a progressive fan of yours. I find your commentary to be reasoned, compassionate, and thoughtful. I thought today‚Äôs episode of the argument was terribly irresponsible. Not once did you ask about Trump‚Äôs racist rhetoric, his misogyny....

Classic Trump. A racist alarmist. As Mary Trump chronicled in her book, Donald Trump has always been someone who has no shame for his deviant behavior, usually to cause harm to others, to soothe his own pain

How is this Trump‚Äôs fault? He left it to governors to decide how to run their states. It was each state‚Äôs choice to shut down (or not) and to keep shutdown going. Federalism supports the decision to leave it to states, plus the national uproar if he made decisions nationally

Are you asking whether there'd be a big mobilization against a policy if said policy weren't promoted by the federal government, thus making it more likely to happen? You know Trump isn't some random pundit, he's the President, his words lead to actions.

Obama did warn everyone that Trump was completely unfit to be President... Maybe that's why he also had a Pandemic response team right in the White House... That Trump dismantled!
True... But it is also true to say that Trump rarely does interviews unless with a friendly fox host. Only reason he's out there more now is because he thinks he actually smart &amp; wants to reach their viewers due to upcoming election. (Not working out so great for him)üòÇ

As it becomes clear Trump is trying to sabotage the US Postal Service to interfere with mail-in voting, perhaps we should be urging people in areas with huge voting lines to vote early in-person (many places with mail in voting also have early voting).
Funny how a statement ending in a question mark infuriates the anti trump folks. It‚Äôs rhetorical.
Not at all. Long overdue. Trump is a walking financial crime...
Why? He‚Äôs not going to win in Virginia or Maryland. Is this just so Trump can see these ads?

They have absolutely NO room to even whisper the word BENGAZI... Ever again... Besides it will give us all the more reason to get to the bottom of WHY Trump hasn't said hmmm 2 PUTIN on bounty on our Soldiers heads. Must not get swept under the rug need hearings now!
Well, if getting rid of Trump isn't enough to make them "feel good" about their vote, then they are hopeless.
Of course, who's to say that the Republicans will nominate a "sane" one if 4 years? I fully expect them to find another Trump like figure next time.

I called this earlier to my wife. Best way to avoid Trump, a positive test result!
What does Pittsburgh have to do with anything. What promise was made and how was it kept ? Whirlpool has been in Ohio like forever. You did nothing. Let's talk about Carrier in Indiana.
It is fluster to make it look like he is tough on China when he has already received preferential treatment for his personal business. Trump wants to charge a fee for the transaction too.  Trump is also looking the other way with the genocide going on with the Ughers.
The positive test came hours before he was supposed to greet President Donald Trump in Cleveland.
If Biden wins in November I have some advice for antifa, blm activist and rioters across the country. Trump supporters will be out there looking for you. When they find you it won‚Äôt be pretty
This is the first time I've been to a campground and can unequivocally say, I won't be coming back. Talk about east bumble fuck Trump town. Wow. Confederate flags everywhere. We do not belong here. ü§Æü§Æ
Trump NEVER acts pious. He's clearly utterly uninformed about any and every religious or spiritual tradition or practice or literature.
sad to hear lindsey graham is struggling in his reelection campaign, the senator who said this:  ‚ÄúWe have to reject this demagoguery, and if we don‚Äôt reject Donald Trump, we‚Äôve lost the moral authority ‚Ä¶ to govern this great nation.‚Äù  ... right before backing trump for 4 yrs.
Trump isn't flush enough to pay. He needs another 4 years to get out of debt
If his master, DJ Trump says it's the truth, then gosh darn it, it's the truth
I think you can say Romney and some others but I am not going to say Trump has been treated unfairly
I don‚Äôt understand how Trump‚Äôs favor ability can increase after all his failures.
Trump is a #Biblicalidiot
Nobody is responsible, not Cuomo (I really do not like him), not Trump, not anyone but China. They all treated the unknown the best they could. Zero deaths are all that would of been acceptable.
After trump taxes released.  Fox news and gop.  He has the most beautiful complex debt.  The conflicts of kings.  There is an aura of magnificence surrounding his lack of money and owing it to world class criminals.  It makes him a bad ass.
Vote for some write in is a vote for Bunkerbaby Trump
I‚Äôve never heard anyone but a Trump pronounce it Thighland.
Still don‚Äôt believe that the MSM is corrupt... Trump‚Äôs pronunciation of the word ‚ÄúThailand‚Äù is getting more coverage than Biden basically saying Black people share a brain...
I heard the PERFECT word that describes president Trump the other day by   The word is ‚Äústress resistant‚Äù the man never gets stressed, he just simply performs.
The MAGAs only believe in one fact checker and that‚Äôs trump
Dude.... trump said it both ways. EVEN if it was thigh-land, he still said it tie-land the second time. So pick which way is right and wrong and he still got it wrong once.
Coronavirus aid talks at risk of collapse; Trump, McConnell huddle
The governors are responsible? Trump failed to get the PPE that the Obama administration told him three years ago that we needed. He told us we had nothing to worry about. He advocated for people to ‚Äútake back their states‚Äù
Mr trump, I know this is hard to accept, but we impeached you because we don't want you leading us.  You will not win anything because we don't want you.
Ok.  I'm a moderate Dem, and don't think of myself as being all that different than a moderate GOP, so I guess that's why we see things differently.  But I would have gladly voted for Warren, Yang or Bernie - multiple times if it were legal - to get rid of Trump.
BIDENS POLICIES along with the segregationists he so happily worked with along with corporate Dems policies LED to TRUMP . IF things don‚Äôt drastically CHANGE ASAP  a bunch of trump wanna bes could control Congress in 2years let alone someone worse than TRUMP will win in 4years

Does anyone with half a brain really think crazy joe will be the candidate. He was told not to go to Milwaukee because the real candidate will come off the floor. It‚Äôs a head fake so trump campaigns against joe. I‚Äôm from the future. Trust me
I wonder what the parents of kids who have died thought about kids being virtually immune from covid by trump? Can't imagine the added pain put on them.
I‚Äôve tried many a time to imagine Trump transitioning power over to Biden, like doing the presidential thing and sitting down with him to go over things‚Äî- I can‚Äôt do it. I can‚Äôt picture it.
Trump can't even form full sentences. Now that is a problem!
is better then anyone Trump wants.

You say Trump is racist but Biden constantly says racist things &amp; has throughout his career legislatively harmed Blacks. Like the 94 crime bill. Biden says all the things unsolicited that folks imagine Trump would say
We were talking about Biden‚Äôs comments on the merit of Biden. The fact that you felt the need to inject Trump into it is interesting to say the least. Trump has his issues, but that doesn‚Äôt make Joe‚Äôs unsolicited comments any less weird
Joe Biden has no policies yet. Only tRUMP does and they aren't working.
So this huge increase happened under tRUMP ?
What exactly does what Biden said have to do with Trump? Even if Trump was unwell that doesn‚Äôt make the crazy things Biden says about Blacks less crazy
I think he &amp; his group will publicly say they‚Äôll debate &amp; then at the last minute make some crazy demand that the GOP will reject then he can blame Trump. Then the media will say  Trump didn‚Äôt really want to debate
in my mind, trump boasting that he passed a cognitive test means he actually failed
What is tRUMP DOING ABOUT IT.
The media did their job. What‚Äôs funny is that Biden says unsolicited all the things the media imagines Trump says.
Agreed. The states we live in (CA, NY) are Biden's anyway. Trump has to win TX, OH, PA, NC, AZ, and possibly one of WI or MN to win the election.
Voting For Trump Is Going To FEEL GOOD, 2020 Might Surprise EVERYONE
Back when Pres. Trump (your Pres.) Shut everything down, everyone agreed. When he tried to stop people from coming here, he was anti-immagration.  He did put Covid patients in nursing homes.   He's tried to help in every way possible.
I understand your point, but I'm not comfortable with Trump. The Democratic establishment is also inept and problematic. I'm not voting for the lesser of two evils, and haven't done so in a Presidential election since 1988. The power of the vote is a romantic anachronism.
Non profit nra provides a lavish lifestyle for its executives.  Trump self deals campaign donations to his organization.  Why does poor gop underwrite these criminal organizations when they are just pocketing the money?

NRA, Trump respond to NY AG lawsuit seeking to shut down gun rights group
Am I the only one who thinks this whole lawsuit against the NRA is a boon to Trump? It seems like he‚Äôs getting the culture war set piece that his campaign has been craving. It would be one thing if people were being charged with crimes, but absent that, why not wait 3 months?
Trump is flailing more and more as the pavement he is hurtling toward draws closer.
Then his dad either bribed or threatened to kill a few who lied about his going to college the four times Trump was drafted and got off on a bogus student deferment. The 5th time Trump was drafted he failed his psyche exam &amp; was section 8 or mentally ill.
Trump was kicked out of second grade on day one and spent the whole of second grade until the end of 12th grade in a juvenile detention center for rich kids of criminal organizations we call 'military academies' where Trump learned to salute.
INot really. Look at the history of the AD at Baylor or Freeze's scandals....then add Falwell's history and the Trump support is just the cherry on the shit sundae.
RUSH: The Facebook people judging Trump's tweets worked for Hillary's campaign. The Twitter clown judging Trump's campaign worked for Kamala Harris.

3.5 years and all the Trump enemies are free yet his friends are in jail. Maybe just maybe all your conspiracies are bullshit.
It's much more likely that a number of states will see significant increases in cases and deaths due to reckless school and university openings. Also, I seriously doubt Trump gets credit for a vaccine. An unfortunate byproduct of so much disinformation.

RUSH: This was a huge letdown for the Drive-By Media. They were convinced that she was gonna announce some case against Trump.

How can you continue to support the Antichrist, Trump and him money laundering for the Kremlin since Trump Tower was built in the 1970s? How can you continue to discount the facts of the matter by clinging to the fatally flawed FALSE assumption we hate Trump, when we pity him ...
Antichrist Trump was never a lawful or legitimate Presidential candidate. You unplug from mainstream media which is run by level-headed MODERATES and instead get your fake news from Fox News and social media nut jobs, who in turn best serve the Kremlin - that could be a problem..
There is tons and tons of hard evidence of Trump Tower being used for money laundering operations for the Kremlin since it was built in the 1970s. But if you do not allow such evidence to be presented, then it might as well not exist. During the Election 2016 campaign as well ...

Trump has normalized name calling.  It's scary how much a leader's nature filters down to the general public.  I think that's why Nassim Taleb does so much labeling of people with a derogatory nickname, for example.  Trump has changed the rules, and everybody else is adapting.

Donald Trump is doing everything to steal this election again.
In 1973 Trump was sued for violating the Fair Housing Act. They discriminated against Black applicants by coding their applications with a "C" for colored. The Civil Rights division of HUD prosecuted them. The Trump's settled out of court for a very large sum. He's at it again
you must think Americans are stupid. Everybody knows its Obama care Trump is trying to take credits for. Its already in the ACA. Nothing new.
Speaking of housing discrimination.  The Trump  family was sued for coding applications with a "C" for colored. These applications were thrown in the trash. The Trumps made billions off their low income apartments. The US Department of Housing and Urban Development prosecuted.
They're both racists but Biden's racism has done a whole lot more damage than Trump's.
The difference between the two is real. The media shows you people dying under Trump but not the ones that have died under Biden. And we all know if you don't see it, it doesn't exist.

Please remember Joe is gaga, makes unfortunate slips, does not mean it. But anybody has to be better than trump.
Hey, republican enablers of Trump, you  offered $200 only $5 per hour craziness, it‚Äôs lower than minimum wages. The voters know your craziness and the election is the reckoning. Trump and Republicans  responsible for 160,000 dead, 4 million infected and debt 10 trillion more.
It wasn't a mistake, just a Freudian slip.  tRump loves Thigh land. Especially 13 years old thigh lands.
...for who?
Hey, republican enablers of Donald Trump, pass the stimulus of $600 or more to help the American taxpayers. Stop pussyfooting around $600 only $8.57 per hour and lower than the minimum wages. working means kill the virus and not Americans, so we can go back to work.
I swear if Trump showed up at a press conference with his underpants outside his trousers, the Dinesh S'Souza's of this world would have to rush into the nearest mens room to make the switch, and then he'd still have to insist that this was the way he always wore his skivvies.
What's the plan? Kanye run and then drop out to throw his support to tRump? Almost all of America's mentally ill will vote for tRump or Kanye regardless. tRump is just splitting that vote now...shouldn't affect Biden negatively in any way imo
That would have been a smarter play for Trump: "open up the 'Great Firewall' to US social media companies or else!" If he'd used that approach we'd have a more open Internet as a whole.
at least Trump writes his own crazy tweets during his morning shits. Biden said what he meant and some 23 year old translated the explanation on Twitter. Don‚Äôt fall for it.
So if trump bans TikTok unless it is sold in The U.S., how does that affect the Caribbean?

Trump says he is banning Tiktok and WeChat from the US in 45 days if they are not sold to a US company.... Because he says they are spreading incorrect info about the Corona virus... This must be against some international law.
He used to be balanced. I don't disagree with everything Trump says so I don't expect him to go against him all the time. Lindsay has to at least be able to call him out. Lindsay is a senior man, he does not have to debase himself to feed Trump's ego.
President Trump signs executive order to bring drug manufacturing back to US soil  - Old Harbour News  via
As Mary Trump's book explains, Donald Trump sees making an apology is a sign of weakness. I am reminded that Trump said that he "has never asked God for forgiveness".
He backs everything Trump says right or wrong... He used to be the conscience of the Republican party, he's just a yes man now. He has no principle on which he stands, it's only what Trump is on. It's his right to do that but I don't trust anything that comes out of his mouth.
Why is it Ms Camerota Biden gets a pass for every racist comment which have been so many but Trump? Admit it Biden is a racist say it
From what I know Trump wants Microsoft to buy TikTok and cut off Chinese data streaming, keep the data inside the US or something, with the Tencent ban as an incentive
Furthermore, EYE am not saying Biden is the saving grace but unfortunately this is a circumstance where it is the lesser of two evils. We know Kanye won‚Äôt win so when you vote for him, the vote still goes to Trump. I implore you to do further research on what the effects are of

Classic Trump. A racist alarmist. As Mary Trump chronicled in her book, Donald Trump has always been someone who has no shame for his deviant behavior, usually to cause harm to others, to soothe his own pain

Trump has dementia, but the guy who won‚Äôt leave his basement for months, needs his arm held as he walks, can‚Äôt form a coherent thought in any interview with any source or network, and legit rambles and stutters more than a dying car doesn‚Äôt have it? Good to know.

That's because before his bogus  Presidency, Trump never picked up a bible to read it...
You keep dreaming.... we will re_elect Trump for 4 more years whether you like or not !!!
It‚Äôs because they enacted social distancing, quarantined and made sure people used masks and proper hygiene. They blocked traveling to and from infected areas. It has nothing to do with HCQ...perhaps they were injecting disinfectant into their bodies like Trump suggested
Trump doesn't have an original thought in her pinky finger...
I don‚Äôt disagree with you for a second.  That‚Äôs why the executive order. Trump can‚Äôt trust the RINO‚Äôs. Republicans and Democrats promised moving the embassy in Israel to Jerusalem for 40+years. Politicians make promises every few years and but keeping promises...not so much

Skipping the Debates would be a disservice to the American People.  Voting with a lack of knowledge &amp; understanding leads to the USA‚Äôs demise.  I withheld my vote in 2016 because Clinton &amp; Trump couldn‚Äôt convince me to support them.  Trump is my guy in 2020. Knowledge is Power.

Obama inherited a $1.4 trillion deficit and lowered it to $587 billion in 2016. Trump then raised it to $1 billion before Covid. Our deficit this year could be $6 trillion

Many says we can‚Äôt let possible deaths tank the economy. A COVID infection doesn‚Äôt have to lead to death but it could lead to financial ruin. Trump wants to end the ACA. Even w/ Cadillac US health insurance willthe sick can go  bankrupt

Oh so there are 4.96 million Covid cases in the US minus 90...thanks for the clarification...remember when Trump said there were six and would be down to zero shortly?
P.S didn‚Äôt know Trump gave your family the virus just by virtue of being your president I mean both my parents had it and it was milder than the common cold , nyc here tested and confirmed positive, personally I kept testing negative even after being close to them.
And today would have been a good day for Donald Trump to release his tax returns as  would say, and probably did say today
Well Trump can leave in a huff.  In fact he should leave in a minute and a huff!

Watch out for trump blaming China for fraudulent mail in ballots that he mentioned a few months back because it is obvious this a  false narrative he‚Äôs going to use if he loses. I really don‚Äôt trust the DNI on some of this because his guy Radcliffe is there.

This so far from being the truth... Trump should have stop it at the boarder.... But he failed and many died... That's the truth.

Why does one need to publicly love Jesus? Biden regularly attends Mass near his home. When was the last time Trump voluntarily went to church, except for a photo op. Even he didn‚Äôt go inside, or even bring his own Bible. (BTW, ‚Äòpastor‚Äô, what about poor Falwell, Jr. Too bad!)

But when Donald trump bragged to grabbing women by the pussy what did you tweet?
They don't.  The electoral system is designed to balance the voices of the small states with those of the big ones.  It's always possible that a Democrat could win the Electoral vote but lose the popular vote.  In the cases of W. and Trump, many liberals blame the Greens.

Let's be honest, Trump's appeal has nothing to do with his supposed Christianity. He's not even good at faking it. Anyone with half a brain and even minimal knowledge of the New Testament knows that everything about him is in direct contraction with Christianity.

USA TODAY: GOP senators tiptoe around Trump as political dangers grow
Last week, President Trump posted a tweet suggesting delaying the general election, citing mail-in ballots to be an ineffective and ‚Äúfraudulent‚Äù method. The President does not have the authority to delay any elections in the nation, as they are already set by the Constitution.
I‚Äôve yet to read a tweet so pathetic, so lacking in anything resembling truth and most importantly coming from inside the rectum of Trump himself.
Snickers asks me every Morning if Trump is still President. Every day I tell him  Yes, but not for long. Then he starts purring.
We can have no dreaming idea of the breadth and depth of Trump's dirty dealing when he is  such a, in your face, thieving criminal on paper. His arrogance and ego + his "under the table, off the books" scumbagery would be truly incomprehensible  by any metric.
100% my hypothetical teen is not socializing in person or babysitting in a pandemic probably anywhere &amp; especially not in a Trump house when Trump is preaching dangerous antiscience.  There is no presumption of safety at all in that scenario.
Trump along with frontline workers have acesss to the rapid test. Why isn‚Äôt he making it accessible for all if he‚Äôs for ALL people. Understand my logic. Instead of flaunting around a malaria drug that again my doctors don‚Äôt have access too. Ty for your concern ü§î

Both Trump and Biden have no desire to end poverty, which kills so many
I can go on if you‚Äôd like. Trump and Biden are both evil politicians with little care for the deaths their policies caused or will cause. And that has been a consistent trait of every single US president.
This is environmental destruction on a sociopathic level. Hundreds of years old Seguro Cacti (and the ecosystem that lives in and around those Cacti) destroyed for Trump's wall, just devastating.

Wow...your ignorance is astonishing. More jobs created under Obama in last three years than Trump first 3 years. Obama inherited a $1.4 trillion deficit and cut it by 2/3. Trump raised deficit by over 50%. Stock market did better in Obama‚Äôs first 3 years than Trumps.

Carmen this is already in place under Obama‚Äôs policy. Trump has been trying to take it away for the last three years.  Does it just sound better to you with Trump‚Äôs name on it? Your president as you say. The guy claiming credit for something he did not do?
Gail the people already have this under Obama‚Äôs policy. Trump has been trying to take it away for the last three years.  Does it just sound better to you with Trump‚Äôs name on it?
Trump replaces Obamacare with the Affordable Care Act. üôÑ
So... trump is replacing Obamacare with Obamacare...?üôÑ
Trump's golf club press conference was a social distancing disaster ‚Äî until the tweet-shaming began - #DumpTrumpDayNov3
It‚Äôs because they enacted social distancing, quarantined and made sure people used masks and proper hygiene. They blocked traveling to and from infected areas. It has nothing to do with HCQ...perhaps they were injecting disinfectant into their bodies like Trump suggested
I don‚Äôt disagree with you for a second.  That‚Äôs why the executive order. Trump can‚Äôt trust the RINO‚Äôs. Republicans and Democrats promised moving the embassy in Israel to Jerusalem for 40+years. Politicians make promises every few years and but keeping promises...not so much
Trump is the fake news
Here we go again - RUSSIA!!!!
He‚Äôs the one who said that Trump is the healthiest person in the history of our universe and could live 100 more years and only weighed 230
Why are u attacking democrats? This helps Trump.
Who put their money on Biden and Trump being challenged by a rabid libertarian?
The majority of Biden supporters will never know about this or any of the great things Trump has done. Please, some genius figure out how to get this stuff out there!

Trump increased the deficit by over 50% and achieved only 2.3% GDP growth
Even Trump would agee that he got that mostly right.
Chris Cuomo killing it now! Fuck Trump!!!
Trump supporters like me will love it, Biden supporters will never see it.

Obama inherited a $1.4 trillion deficit and lowered it to $587 billion in 2016. Trump then raised it to $1 billion before Covid. Our deficit this year could be $6 trillion
I know what the difference is. Obama lowered the deficit by 2/3 and Trump increased the deficit by 50%
The scene that is at Trump's country club is just unbelievable and unbelievably disturbing and disgusting
no Trump interruption please.
#OrangeusDumbasseous  Trump doesn't understand Trump, he is beyond salvation even to himself.
5 million positive cases. Where is the National Testing Strategy? Oh yeah, Trump wants to slow down testing because it makes him look bad. It‚Äôs all about Trump and not the safety of Americans
Hahaha...those posts are funny...Donald Trump will add more debt in 4 years than Obama did in 8 and Trump never got to 3% growth...Obama lowered the deficit by 2/3 but Trump increased the deficit by 50%..Obama had better job numbers and better stock market. You lose
Call me a skeptic, but in 2016 I predicted: "We WON'T get that border wall until THEY need it to keep US from ESCAPING." I was being facetious but now its 2020 and I got commie *traveling papers*  ...in the USA. üíÄüá∫üá∏üíÄ#IronCurtainüíÄüá∫üá∏üíÄ I no longer support the Trump Wall.
Trump's latest commercial says Biden will raise taxes, take your guns &amp; give your jobs to illegal immigrants. He is betting that a simple message will work with voters who are not focused on foreign policy. Why can't the Democrats come up with 3 simple points?
Trump is the most corrupt President we have ever had. His own community voted 8 to 1 for his opponent...because we know who he is.
Oh so there are 4.96 million Covid cases in the US minus 90...thanks for the clarification...remember when Trump said there were six and would be down to zero shortly?
Trump didn‚Äôt have a 3% year either. He lowered taxes, increased the deficit to $1 trillion and only achieved a 2.3% GDP growth. He promised 4,5 or 6% GDP growth by 2019. What a failure
That‚Äôs moronic. You don‚Äôt know what your talking about. If you want to talk percentages, Ronald Reagan and GWB increased the debt more than Obama. Oh and Trump will increase debt in 4 years more than Obama did in 8 years. Obama increased debt by 74% while Reagan 186% GWB 101%
Vote for Trump? For GOP for 24 years? And now telling Dems how to vote? Your right. I don‚Äôt have to buy it
She was able to shutter the Trump Foundation due to self dealing and Fraud. My money is on her.
Yet you give Trump a pass. 2000 people dying per day in the US...over 160,000....
This is not your country. This country belongs to us Trump voters you are not one of us. Go back home
Proves how little you know. Obama inheritors a $1.4 trillion deficit and left Trump with a $666 billion deficit (for tax year 2017 - Obama‚Äôs budget) Trump has raised it to $1 trillion. So Obama cut it by more then half and Trump raised it by more than 50%...Facts
Maybe Trump will pardon him
Trump has 9 out of the biggest 10 market declines ever...it‚Äôs just a fact
Oh,  there‚Äôs Wharton and then there‚Äôs Wharton. Seems like you‚Äôre overstating  academic credentials:
Opinion | We are only beginning to suffer the consequences of Trump‚Äôs failures
Why it was cringeworthy is beyond me. It was factual. Yesterday Trump said the children are 'immune' from the virus, and expect a vaccine on Election Day.
Based upon about 10 different witnesses and if Trump was innocent why didn‚Äôt he allow witnesses to testify? Like John Bolton? Everyone knows what he did and if you think for one second he didn‚Äôt withhold aid for dirt on Biden you are a lot dumber than I thought.
Still right. He was impeached and he should of been removed from office. There was no Hoax. Trump withheld aid to Ukraine in exchange for dirt on his opponent. Fact
We will never get that with Trump!!
How devastating for Wharton.  Imagine being burden with the stigma of aiding in the (mis)education of Donald J Trump.  Its campus buildings must tremble in shame each time he ("mis") utters a word or (mis) writes a sentence.
There, easily fixed it - Donald Trump is the biggest political crime and scandal in American history. Hopefully, for the good of our Country, his end is coming soon!
Trump shall win and you will have all the lovely shoes and expensive one you want my darling
Also look forward to the fact that we are voting for Trump in this country and you don't have a chance
Yes it does you may as well be a democrat‚ÄºÔ∏èBiden is incapable of running this country. Trump has gotten more done in 3 years then any other Presidential did or could. You may not like him but he has done what is right for this country‚ÄºÔ∏è
This has to stop‚ÄºÔ∏èBLM has nothing to do with helping Blacks. We all know it. They are a cover for a much more devious &amp; destructive plan to destroy President Trump by destroying cities and help Democrats win In Nov. We have to end this or there will not be freedom to vote.üòìüôèüèªüá∫üá∏
TRUMP 2020!!!
Our proud impeached hoaxer-in-chief,  Donald J Trump. #TrumpHoaxedAmerica
Where is  He said he would spend millions to see Trump out of office.
There is a lot more dirt to learn from Deutsche Bank. Most of the money was flowing via this bank from Russia to Trump, his family and some republicans. I‚Äôll bet a mill on it, maybe 2
Why on earth would you want to publicize video proof of the stupidity of Trump‚Äôs supporters?  Crowded indoor space, not a mask in sight.
Another trouble for Trump....
Trump has done a great job himself ruining the economy
How naive I am, always figured they'd wait for the transition to go full Arthur Andersen with Trump regime public records. Thought til then they'd merely continue illegally classifying stuff to hide waste, fraud, abuse and stonewalling investigators.
My favorite thing in the world is when people are like ‚ÄúBiden is just as bad as Trump, you shouldn‚Äôt vote for Biden either‚Äù. Okay so who should I vote for? Lol someone has to win and I‚Äôd prefer the one who doesn‚Äôt tweet as much.
Trump has no integrity, no honor, no respect, no dignity, no empathy, no compassion, no honesty and only cares about himself. Has never done anything for anyone his whole life. You are easily scammed by a two bit con man.
Lotta ppl w/ expressed reservations about the covid vaccine describe themselves as up to date on other vaccines, &amp; pro-science. They said under Biden, they'll get it. But under Trump, they won't bc he can't be trusted to administer it properly. Getting rid of him= all we can do.
Wow...your ignorance is astonishing. More jobs created under Obama in last three years than Trump first 3 years. Obama inherited a $1.4 trillion deficit and cut it by 2/3. Trump raised deficit by over 50%. Stock market did better in Obama‚Äôs first 3 years than Trumps.
Thank you üëë
US crude oil production under Obama was up 77% - crude oil imports declined over 60% under Obama...but give credit to Trump instead....I heard it was Trump that killed Bin Laden...as long as you are giving Trunp credit for everything Obama did....
Obama brought down the unemployment rate for blacks much more than Trump did
As if Trump is conservative...what about $1 trillion deficit and increasing spending exponentially is conservative? What about massive bailouts and massive stimulus is conservative? Let‚Äôs just give billions to wealthy people with no strings and hope they do the right thing..
That‚Äôs hilarious...as if Trump started at 20% and brought it down to 5%...the trend has not changed under Trump. Would have been there anyway. You can‚Äôt give all the credit to Trump but go ahead and be ignorant
Trump is on vacation...again
You missed the clarification. What did Trump mean when he said Biden would kill god?
How about the 2000 people that died yesterday from Covid? Do they get counted? Let‚Äôs ask Trump...oh, sorry he‚Äôs on vacation, having the time of his life...
Yes the test Trump is touting
50%/50%? Interesting. Trump wins. #Trump2020LandslideVictory
Trump doesn‚Äôt think. Period.
But Trump instead steals from charities
Trump trying to steal another election...already engaged Wikileaks to hack DNC last election and already withheld aid to Ukraine to dig up dirt on current opponent. Most corrupt President ever
You may wanna shut your mouth about Biden's minor flubs compared to your dude. Biden knows AZ is a state, Trump is incompetent about virtually every aspect of governance. Unless there's a grift involving his family businesses, of course.

twit suicide: on one hand Id never been called a (homosexual) so much in my life as the short period of time I played League of Legends ‚Äî on the other Trump put an executive order out against Tencent while the KKK still just exist?? the enemy of my enemy is still a gd turd
You are completely full of shit by criticizing his book deal. There is zero wrong with it. The Obamas give a lot to charity and are still pushing for a progressive tax system where the wealthy pay their fair share. People like Trump pay under 15% in tax.
That‚Äôs ridiculous. Random House is the largest publisher and there is no publishing rights to common core. Why are you so dishonest. It‚Äôs Trump that is the slime ball. He even had his ambassador speak to Great Britain about moving the British Open to his property. TRUE SLIMEBALL
Isn't Sue Trump the name of one of his illegitimate children?
Surely you don‚Äôt believe that Trump follows the path of Jesus?
That‚Äôs a Trump rump!
I get it! You must be a trump supporter. I‚Äôm sure my BLM support and the fact I hunt shitty racists hiding behind fake profiles online upsets you. Do you have a sock account too?
Trump‚Äôs message:   ‚Äúmasks are not my thing. I will wear it when I think it is appropriate.  What people hear:   ‚ÄúI can do what I want and nobody can ever make me wear a mask.‚Äù  This video captures the consequences of Trump‚Äôs message.
So is your current President. We are watching the U.S. wreckage from overseas, but please tell me how your economy is "the best it has ever been in the history of humanity" and how Trump has been "the best leader in the history of humanity" because you aren't brainwashed at all.
Don't sympathize with him. He knows Trump pronounced it incorrectly and he still defends him, because he thinks Trump is god.
They genuinely believe at this point that Trump is their lord and savior.
Trump has been taking 1 that is rapid from what I saw on here of course that‚Äôs for him . It‚Äôs really sad cause if they have schools and business‚Äôs testing we could get handle on all of this
As someone who has worked in pharmaceutical advertising for over a decade, I feel pretty safe in saying there will NOT be a vaccine before election day!!!! Trump is a lying idiot!!!

Democrats had plans back in May to address expiring unemployment.  YOU waited till the week of expiration to start debating a plan with MUCH LESS help for Americans but billions for Trump's NEW FBI bldg, West Wing Renovation and MORE MILITARY $$.  #GTFOH #GOPBetrayedAmerica
Greatest Economy? 2% GDP growth? That‚Äôs great? $1 trillion deficit? Also great? Stock Market performed better under Obama and more jobs were created last 3 years of Obama than first 3 years of Trump. Greatest Ever? Yes, you are stupid!
Rachel, your religious beliefs are your own and can‚Äôt be used to dictate how other people live their lives.  But by all means, live your life as you see fit. As for trump, his father kept him out of Vietnam. Made up a diagnosis of ‚Äúbone spurs of his feet ‚Äú, while other kids died
In the last 3 weeks Brianna has had on Trump Campaign Team members Tim Murtaugh, Hogan Gidley and Mercedes Schlapp. In each case, Brianna has handed them their asses. In an ever so polite way.  Brianna is awesome. #TeamBrianna
I watch Golden Girls as I'm going to bed. They were always the television equivalent of comfort food for me, but since Trump was installed, they are my lullaby. I have every season. They were the greatest.  And if they were still on the air, they'd rag so hard on #DerangedDonald.
Why am I feeling that this is just like 2016, when nobody thought Hillary could lose to Trump? Don't count your üê•s  b4 they hatch. #WorkHard4BlueWave
ACTUAL TRUMP CHINA "DEAL"
So you're saying trump hasn't done shit then? Because, you know, he's been "president" for 4 yrs.
Hey Trump:  YOU‚ÄôRE FIRED.
There‚Äôs no deal of any substance coming. Republicans are running from a losing trump ticket and trying to appeal to their base. Their base didn‚Äôt get $600/week. Game over.
But you would let Trump destroy it
Trump has had his hand on the curtain since after he was elected.  When he pulls the curtain back, you‚Äôre gonna hear some serious crying.  They have thrown everything they have at him and he comes up clean.  The same can‚Äôt be said for them.  They‚Äôre in trouble and they know it.
trump isn't the problem america is and it's time people (americans!!!) understood this on a large scale
I see you're super biased, but if you actually want trump to win, denying the reality that Biden has a lot of support isn't going to help.
Biden‚Äôs people pivoting the ‚Äúhe‚Äôs against God‚Äù Trump ramble into ‚Äúwow, so Trump hates Catholics?‚Äù is unusually clever and sneaky for a Dem general campaign, which actually makes me feel better about our chances.
Trump. Doesn‚Äôt. Give. A. Fuck.
I bet Trump will do his usual weekend of golf.  Who cares how many are dying?

That‚Äôs ridiculous. Yes the Clinton Foundation is operating and saving lives. The Trump Foundation was forced to shut down and pay $2 million for fraud and self dealing. Yes integrity is a trait a President should have.

Trump now taking questions, first about the Capitol Hill negotiations and the legality of his EOs. ‚ÄúEverything you do you get sued,‚Äù he replied.
Trump says a majority of Americans support him.
Trump talking about how ‚Äúsuburbs‚Äù would be ‚Äúa disaster‚Äù if Democrats were in charge.
Trump now rambling about drug companies. Says he will sign another executive order about lowering prices.
Trump says he will sign an executive action to require health insurance companies to cover preexisting conditions despite the fact that that doesn‚Äôt seem to gel with, uh... the Constitution.
Trump again ranting about testing. Lies and says we have more cases because we do more testing. That is only part of why our numbers are so high. It is also because the virus is more widespread here. We have covered this so many flipping times.
As I said earlier hopefully with Trump doing Unemployment extension, eviction moratorium and payroll tax cuts himself, these shitheads in congress can now agree on the stimulus checks they already agree on.

TRUMP PRESS CONFERENCE, a thread:
US intel: Russia acting against Biden; China opposes Trump
Isn't that Trump? No, probably not, it's a boar.
Chuck, you know if Trump does an executive order and gives people extended benefits or money. He will earn votes!
Do it and put your face on Trump‚Äôs lmao
Black people like all people vote for people the believe will help them. That's why only 5 percent of blacks are currently voting for Trump.
And now kids are getting and infecting staff. Another great pass to Trump by Fox News.
When's the Turnip going to tell the Russians to cease and desist offering bounties on  American soldiers? What a weakling. If we actually had a war, Trump would probably be found hiding under his golf cart, with Lindsey Graham.
I really wish Trump would stop this letting Americans die while he plays golf.
You used to be a decent senator.  What did Trump pay you to turn your back on this country? It has to be more than a few visits to Trum properties to play golf. Trump putts while the country dies.
What Bullshit! If Republicans cared one iota about this country and it's people, we would be printing checks and testing all Americans.All Trump cares about is grabbing female parts.

Glad you understand that our economy is broken under the Turnip's watch. And that Trump is totally incapable of understanding the problem or fixing it.

Forget Biden, right now we are NOT safe in Donald Trump's America. 160,000 dead and counting. And he shows NO compassion for any of them. He never mentions them, even when pressed, just that he claims to have done more testing than any other country. What an ass. Good riddance.

Well, it's without my vote. I can overlook a lot of things, but not blatant racism. I was really trying because I hate Trump, but at this point, I'm sitting this out. Biden should step down before the nomination and save us from this nightmarish situation.
Trump has played 2.6 times more golf than Obama in his first 2 years and 91 days and has cost the tax payer an estimated $74 million more than Obama.
Trump you are the best
No, it won't. None of my black friends really care what he said. Trump attacking BLM like they are a terrorist group is what they are concerned with. They don't speak for the entire black community, but I am sure polling and vote results will show they're right
And yet both AOC and that young child know more about the environment than Donald Trump
Dude, seriously? With all the racist shit Trump has said you think this will hurt Biden? No. It will not.

Show the entire clip instead of a sound byte. I didn't judge Trump based on a sound clip from the Axios interview, I watched the entire interview and came to the concluding he's an incompetent idiot and borderline traitor. He literally defended Russia arming the Taliban
Bidens going to just fine with the black community! Trump however doesn't give a shit about people of color.  He's a racist!
Hillary Clinton was cleared of all wrongdoing!! Why don't you focus on the shithole our country has become under Trump!
Turns out, being against racism is not only racist in itself as I've found out recently, but here, clearly helping Trump. I honestly don't understand contemporary political discourse. Sadly the most coherent argument boils down to "no, your guy is senile...".

You seem out of touch with reality. Dems passed their bill a month ago, and were ready to work with Trump. But Senate didn't do shit and with time growing short are in a panic. Such poor leadership in the Senate. You must be getting too old Mitch. Need a nap?
I mean, both are true. Were kind of in a no-win situation of the goal is having a mentally sharp non-senile president. Argue any other point you want but its pretty clear both Trump and Biden are in advancing mental decline.
Trump is the President that you find at a five-and-dime store.
Equally as sad the universe allowed stupid to put Trump in office.
Trump denying involvement in the Kodak deal means two things: 1) he was definitely involved, and 2) it was definitely illegal.
To be fair, HEROES Act sounds better than the actual substance of the bill which is "here's a couple of bucks. I know it won't do much for you, but also were bailing out lobbyists and debt collectors. Also fuck you, because Trump is worse so we don't have to try"
Wonder if he'll blame Captain America for Trump getting elected?
My dream timeline is that he gets blown out in the election and immediately gets hammered for dozens of different crimes by the New York DA.   Nixon was pardoned. I don‚Äôt foresee trump getting a pardon.   If he lives out his days penniless in jail... #justice
You know you can't believe figures coming out of the campaign. Lying is not limited to the Trump. His handlers are good at it too.

If Obama came out &amp; talked about thousands of Americans dying by saying ‚Äúit is what it is‚Äù, he would have been crucified. I just don‚Äôt get why it‚Äôs become acceptable for Trump to just say and do things that other presidents, Republican or democratic, would have been destroyed for

I'm not defending Trump. What I'm defending is clear propaganda from unnamed intelligence officials who would love nothing more than another major war and the Dems to hand it over to them as well as give yet another excuse to stay in the middle east with baseless conspiracies.
One correction.  Trump doesn't just watch TV and whine.  He also golfs.
The whole Russian bounty thing hasnt been substantiated and Generals on the ground in Afghanistan have said that there isnt any link theyve found between deaths and bounties. Im not a Trump guy, but I care about facts and as it stands that just a currently baseless accusation.

Why would the msm report the declining cases when they are actively collaborating with the Biden campaign to take Trump out? Beside Fox news, CNN &amp; MSNBC did not carry the press briefing live because they want to nitpick for talking points to benefit Biden.
Just like Mary Trump said, he does this, calls people his killers and gets them feeling like him...
Biden Is slipping? As far as I'm concerned Trump has crashed already not as a man more like a coward that he is, blaming Xi, he and anybody else who is not hiding behind a tree for his own failures.
Trump is a racist president that belongs in prison.    #VoteOutRacism
This is electoral fraud,using Kanye‚Äôs mental illness to take away votes from Biden. After this is all set and done, Trump will be in prison.

I didn‚Äôt vote for Trump but it doesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt give him some credit. He‚Äôs done some things wrong but so has every other president. The one thing trump has done is shown the USA that we need to kick out the older politicians and bring fresh blood in
Trump supporters like me will love it, Biden supporters will never see it.
But sadly Trump falls for it. If he were to stay quiet and just do his job he would get so much done. These politicians with 30yrs in office don‚Äôt like him because he‚Äôs ruining there cash. Both dems and Republicans. That‚Äôs why they hate  cause she‚Äôs not going with the old way

Pro Wrestling is dead and what took it‚Äôs place is unwatchable Sports Entertainment. There is no intention of obtaining a new audience. It‚Äôs like Trump, it panders only to it‚Äôs base, and no matter how stupid and offensive it gets, the base sticks with it and wants more.

Closing the boarders to folks from infected nations was step one. Trump stopped there then he and his advisors looked for ways to both monetize the response and punish blue leaning states. He played favorites &amp; US citizens died /2

He WENT to Wharton. He is a fraud, an imbecile. He should go live in Thighland with Alice in Wonderland. He should not be ‚Äúleading‚Äù this country. trump is a charlatan and a fraud.  He is not an erudite, well educated person. He is a disgrace to this country!
Watch out for trump blaming China for fraudulent mail in ballots that he mentioned a few months back because it is obvious this a  false narrative he‚Äôs going to use if he loses. I really don‚Äôt trust the DNI on some of this because his guy Radcliffe is there.

This so far from being the truth... Trump should have stop it at the boarder.... But he failed and many died... That's the truth.

But when Donald trump bragged to grabbing women by the pussy what did you tweet?
They don't.  The electoral system is designed to balance the voices of the small states with those of the big ones.  It's always possible that a Democrat could win the Electoral vote but lose the popular vote.  In the cases of W. and Trump, many liberals blame the Greens.
This kind of abuse comes from the top down. If they had or could get a warrant they would have lawfully entered. The Trump Fed are being emulated

Let's be honest, Trump's appeal has nothing to do with his supposed Christianity. He's not even good at faking it. Anyone with half a brain and even minimal knowledge of the New Testament knows that everything about him is in direct contraction with Christianity.

Both Trump and Biden have no desire to end poverty, which kills so many
I can go on if you‚Äôd like. Trump and Biden are both evil politicians with little care for the deaths their policies caused or will cause. And that has been a consistent trait of every single US president.

1)Biden and Obama dropped more bombs than any other president and killed countless lives. They started war with 6 countries and aided Isis. Trump hasn't started a war and has told Saudi and Israel that we wont be their protectors.

Don't think for a minute, the People are just going to forgive and forget when this is all over, as you whine that you were just following trump's orders and were along for the ride. The People will have you pay the piper first.

"Mr. Barr did not emerge in order to serve this one particular leader. On the contrary, Mr. Trump serves a movement that will cynically praise the Constitution in order to destroy it, and of which Mr. Barr has made himself a hero."
Wow, the number of respondents who feel #dumbass has changed in 4 yrs from some sort of leader to incompetent. He hasn't changed at all, he's always been incompetent.
not to speak for  , but I would safely say any post trump investigation would follow any lead that it's given in the course of an investigation.

That is part of the reality, but you‚Äôre not going to change it by throwing in a spoiler third-party challenge. Elect local candidates, state, and build up the party. Then the nominee will have a legitimate chance to be viable. This year, a third-party vote will help Trump.
Under Trump we need a new word for corruption that is this widespread, deep and brazen. I guess that might be tyranny and rising fascism.

tRump‚Äôs designated African American‚Äôs wearing a mask.  The rest should be too.
The only person to ever claim Trump graduated at the top of his class was Trump. He subsequently removed any possible access to all of his academic records. What does that tell you?
And uranium is for building nuclear bombs for tRump‚Äôs buddies in Iran and North Korean to enrich their nuclear ‚ò¢Ô∏è proliferation!   And then there are the current US uranium mines that corporations have NOT cleaned up!
Emoloyees and their families, stage props for the tRump rally.
Fucking hell Trump and his minions are filth. All of them.
My God.  Trying to argue with Catholics who are voting for Trump because the feel he is ‚ÄúPro-Life‚Äù is EXHAUSTING.  The denial is so incredibly deep.  Trump is not pro-life. He dangles that in front of you like a bauble - while he murders people every other way!  Don‚Äôt be fooled.
Trump is anything but cosmopolitan. A person is considered cosmopolitan who ‚Äútravels the world free of prejudices and with an open mind.‚Äù  Antonyms include: unsophisticated, provincial, noncomprehensive, insular, incomprehensive, hick, poky, pokey, and parochial.
1st amendment will be banned by tRump next
Yup. I'm preparing to leave society as much as possible and enjoy the shit show of Socialism. USA is lost. Justice will never happen. It's been a stall to 2020 and remove Trump by any means possible. Then it will be the removal of rights as fast as possible for the New America.
What kind of a "peaceful protest" was Trump withing 50 yards of; without his goons shooting people with rubber bullets and tear gassing them?
Of course they did.  "Dozens of guests at President #Trump's private club in #Bedminster, #NJ., huddled together in a ballroom to watch his Friday evening news conference, apparently flouting the state's #coronavirus restrictions."
I urge everyone to see Trump's lie that 1000s of cultists are passing on as fact not knowing Trump is in court trying to end ACA that is the law protecting pre-existing conditions - Nail this idiot with fact.
glad to see Trump chose such a consummate professional.  Never heard of you - did you sneak into the WH from some institution or just win liar of the year contest to get the job?
Not surprisingly you skipped past the white supremacist , KKK members and neo-nazis supporting Trump.
tRump needs his narcissistic FIX
YA STILL BE OK PLUS YA SPENT MY LAST LIFE IN THE MILATARY US ARMY COVERT MILATARY AND YOU HARDLY EVEN NEW YOU DID NOT KNOW COLONEL CALI BE OK HIT TRUMP MY LAI MASSACRE AND DR FUICI DONT F..CKING CARE AND THAT IS EXZACTLY WHAT MY GOVERMENTS WANT AND EXSPECT PLUS F..CK YOU PEOPLE‚ò†Ô∏è
YOU have been lying about Obamacare that is  what protects pre-existing conditions and Trump is in court to rip up all of the ACA including pre-existing condition protection and Medicaid expansions - ALL OF IT.    Trump is trying to be Obama and you are a LIAR.
Trump 2020. #TrumpTrain
Exactly my thought. This is just Trump with his I can do what to want shit. He‚Äôs delusional.
If Booker and Kamala never ran far left, I would have considered them. I didn‚Äôt  care about age. I needed a moderate to get Trump out.
Hilarious. Now guess, how many idiots do not know that Obamacare did this and Trump is in court to erase every last element of Obamacare (ACA)? Sick to death of lying vipers.
NOT Major, morons - Obamacare (ACA already does this and Trump is in court right now trying to get it erased as well as Medicaid expansions, keeping kids on parents' insurance into early adulthood and the ACA marketplace.   Don't be an idiot. GET FACTS.
Absolutely. Hope much are they enriching themselves at our expense. To allow a lunatic like Trump free rein  is unconscionable.
The Dems now have to convince the American people that what Trump did was bad.
you also fail to see that this cuts off funding for trump. period. this is indeed major.
Minuchin was a corrupt SOB of the mortgage scam so Trump thought he'd be a great Sec of Treasury.  This is what happens when corruption starts at the top.
Don‚Äôt vote for Trump.
Trump has run America into the ground, we have no allies. We are a laughing stock or a dangerous loose cannon because of this asshole. GET UP STAND UP !!!
So What Does Trump Have Against TikTok?
Bunker Boy is an F-in LIAR !!!! Vial, disgrace, has broken every constitutional law there is and HE IS NOT STOPPING. I am GOING TO SUE DONALD TRUMP !!! anyone care to make it a class action ?
Didn't the Republicans have a conniption about Obama's executive orders?  How is it okay for Trump to govern by fiat?  (Besides, existing condition coverage is already the law under the ACA.) All smoke and mirrors with this guy.
What the heck???    #Zuckerberg is afraid of #Trump.
Trump Campaign Slammed for Running Ad Using Doctored Photo of Joe Biden  via
No one will die because of this video (or at least, not many), but ‚Äúconservative free speech‚Äù like Trump‚Äôs lies about the pandemic does lead to people dying unnecessarily.
Also - the thing about being a ‚Äúgrave‚Äù sinner is admitting to your sins and wanting and seeking forgiveness.  Has Trump ever done this?
Trump shows us who he is every day. You don‚Äôt have to look in his ‚Äúheart‚Äù His insults. How he treats people - especially his wives.  When someone shows you who they are Believe them.
Trump canceled sanctions on Sultan, did not pick up the phone to prevent him in his first attempt to invade with the Turkish fleet in Greek waters, only Merkel called him and prevented him, the Sultan thinks he can do whatever he wants with the blessings of Trump
Ok I'm not sure why this Gauls me but it does. It's what Reagan and bush March to. Not a scumbag like trump.
Voting for someone who has empathy for his fellow man and is not a sociopath is Catholic - and human.  How can you even think that Trump has humanities best interest at heart??  He did not even have his wives‚Äô (all three of them) best interest at heart.
JUST IN: NY leads coalition asking that Trump's district drawing order be stopped
Trump Supporters ew
should refuse to give up NYers taxes to the Federal Government until NYers get Coronavirus relief $$ as well. Trump is only giving Florida &amp; Texas money because he's afraid  will turn them BLUE... Stand up for us NYers
Good Lord Patty - Trump loves himself (and Ivanka) - that‚Äôs it. If he loved America - he would have served in the Vietnam War instead of claiming bunions. #Sheesh #TrumpCult
That‚Äôs absolute BS I am not a 1 issue voter If you vote Trump - you vote to take away healthcare. You vote for more people to die from Covid because someone is more interested in golfing than coming up with a plan. More people will die from these things than die from abortions.
I've seen Trump and Kayleigh McEnaney do just that. Why is it always projection with these people?
It's not that good. Good for the 1% and stockholders. The stock market is NOT the economy. GDP has not been stellar under Trump, under 3 mostly.
It‚Äôs amazing how dedicated Trump‚Äòa followers think he‚Äôs god like. What have we done to create Americans who worship madness.
Yes, Trump and his syncophants have made it 90 political and 10 Virus by minimalizing the truth, the facts. They continue to not help us get out of this by not passing the comprehensive bill drafted back 3 months ago by the house. They actually don‚Äôt seem to give a damn.
The best leadership we got with this Trump Virus.
Maybe Chump sycophants who don't know what a passport is pronounce it "Yo-rup" but I can quite confidently say I have NEVER heard ANYONE pronounce it that way and I HAVE relatives who are Trump sycophants. Way to re-write the narrative but it won't work. #TrumpIsAnIdiot
Whereas Trump‚Äôs active rolling back of Obama‚Äôs environmental regulations is destroying the quality of our air and water. But, hey, his friends in industry can get richer with no consequences. #RepublicansAreDestroyingAmerica
So trump doesn't want to help blue states. Where does he think all the money comes from that goes to red states?

Trump had a 28.6% chance of winning on Election Day and a 32% chance according to the 538 and Economist forecasts. That's low, but that doesn't mean the model was wrong
Please no one vote for Kanye West.. It will be a wasted vote. The man needs psychological care and i hope he gets it. If you don't like Trump or Biden just don't vote. Don't throw away your vote on Kanye. Take this election like your life depends on it. It does !

Trump has never been tough on anything or anyone - he always gets someone else to do his dirty work and always knows what is done.
Those were thanks to Bush recession trigger. Trump's is late in his term. Ain't no question but he owns it
Except there is a lot Trump cannot do by executive action and his fcking payroll tax deduction is BS.
Trump's bootlickers are proliferating his fantasy.  It's a shambles.
True, but I have to wonder  - If Kardashians are so powerful what the hell are they doing letting Trump people push him into the role of Jill Stein and eventually get plowed under with blame?
Trump: 'Unless the Dems help me unload this Hydroxychloroquine stash I have, that's going to be another sticking point'
Trump: 'You'll see, this weekend something tremendous will happen, believe me'
Trump only interested in getting his cut of the Tik Toc sale. Oh, and getting sales of Hydroxychloroquine moving so he can unload his stash at a profit.
The Trump re-election GOP is going to try to befuddle the nation and their already befuddled cultists will be glad to help.
Imagine that OANN is a bunch of fcking LIARS pushing the Putin agenda.  And Trump invites them into pressors daily.
Donald trump is the anti christ
Or how hard the self-righteous fall.   Trump evangelists are rarely Christian.

‚ÄúLeaning on the former vice president‚Äôs moderate credentials might be a smart tactic...But it also underscores President Donald Trump's national struggle to portray Biden as too liberal.‚Äù
Trump and MBA should never be used in the same paragraph.

This cannot be serious.  Daddy and corrupt Russians gave Trump his money.  He's the most uninformed person ever to inhabit the WH and that's saying something.  He's not hard to understand. He's disgusting.
Crazy fake lawyer threatening a young minimum wage worker.  Did she graduate from Trump U Law School?  Arrest her for pretending to be from the federal gov‚Äôt.

Really rich considering Biden is a practicing Catholic, Trump practices the Great Church of the 19th Hole.

This is what Trump and the GOP want. They want minorities displaced, and they want it to be harder for them to vote this November. This is a feature, not a bug. This is white supremacy.
Well, there's that, then.
Hey, how about telling Trump to concentrate on saving lives before you or he or anyone worries about the economy? I hear no plans about that.
So why does Russia want Trump to win?
Trump bans dealings with Chinese owners of TikTok, WeChat
He left already so did Congress. They all understand they have to come back.
It‚Äôs Matthews who‚Äôs the problem. He thinks Trump will look like some big guy doing an executive order. McConnell wants credit for getting a bill passed.  He‚Äôs not the impediment. Everyone left yesterday by the way.

Trump is a moron. He was handed life on a silver platter. Lied to avoid serving his country. Paid for an education... literally. Failed business... multiple bankruptcies. Rode life on his Fathers name. Had another Nation help elect him. Failed the American people. #TrumpIsALoser
I believe his old demons were too much for him and I believe he has mental issues, and I feel bad for him, but the dude could have exited the Trump support in a much different way without insulting #WalkAway and many other Trump voters like he did before.
This dude got scared and ran. His will to fight against the same leftists who bashed LGBT trump voters was weak. I don't care if he switches sides. That's all on him. What he needs to do is fess up that he was weak and its easier to submit to the lies and be blissfully ignorant.
trump is literally trying to become a dictator so yeah

Trump is and has been a  Pariah with the "Cosmopolitan" crowd the well educated and in polite society.  He's a garish orange clown... a buffoon...a laughing stock
No I mean when Trump said there were ‚Äúvery fine people‚Äù on both sides at a white supremacist march in Charlottesville.  Or   Trump refused to disavow David Duke and the KKK four times in one interview.
Military people travel around the world. Just saying. Let's say all the above were true, and the point is to make Trump seem too sophisticated for mere mortals to process. The fact is he can't even read from a teleprompter or speak coherently. It doesn't jibe with the hype.
"We don‚Äôt know...what Trump will do. But we do know he won‚Äôt respect any legal or ethical limits."  He won't work to undermine this election. He's actively doing it.

I couldn‚Äôt even bring myself to read it. I‚Äôm too fed up with these dithering losers who don‚Äôt seem to really grasp what four more years of Donald Trump would mean for the United States.
Agreed. Instead of finding a candidate that‚Äôs really good they are just banking on people hating trump so much they vote against him. They thought the same thing in 2016 and it really hurt them.

Yeah, trump posted all responsibility down to the governors because he prayed covid would go away and it didn‚Äôt. That inept clown has an IQ of 20 and is indefensible at this point.
After it was reported that Trump had Cohen pay pollsters to fix polls, it just solidified to me that they are garbage.  I would also not put it passed the right, to respond wrong so to give Democrats a false sense of security.

Is Biden anyone's pick for president? The dude is suffering from dementia or something. No one wants to vote for him anymore than they do Trump, and I'm not talking about the TDS loonies.
He‚Äôs been diagnosed with a stuttering disorder. When I hear trump, I just hear hate and evil, I see a divider of people. When I hear Biden speak, granted he makes some mistakes in his speech, but I don‚Äôt feel he‚Äôs being malicious, I don‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs trying to divide.

Just stop talking. You're going to blow this election. Shut up, stop with the gaffes, say what you're told to say, and beat Trump. It shouldn't even be close, but every time you speak, you put us at risk of another 4 years of Trump. Stop it.

The gap in unemployment rates between Black Americans and white Americans is the largest it has been in five years, according to data recently released by the Labor Department. Presidential candidates are trying to address the disparity.
Remember Biden's Crime Bill? Right. This is what people said about Trump before he won the Presidency:
Another Trump failure exposed.
Yes, Epstein's island is scary as fuck.  Biden owns land on an Island next to his.  What do you think good luck means?  We are in the storm.  Did you see Trump talk yesterday about we might not see him for awhile.
No one is trying to silence Trump. However, Trump was trying to silence protesters in Portland.
What weird alternative reality are we in. Everything they say Trump is, Biden is on tape being. Yet that's who they've put up for election.

you think there isn't an impending electronics import ban from China ratting around in Trump's brain? if  is smart he'll already be spinning up manufacturing in a country that isn't china.
I have an addendum to this. To save America's democracy, Trump has to go.
My wife was born and raised in London, England, and when she heard Trump say "Thighland" she nearly fell on the floor laughing.  Wasn't your college nickname "Distort D'Newsa"?  Good thing that has changed!

Oh shut up. A vote for Trump is a vote for death. We know what side you‚Äôre on.
I going to say something that's clearly lost of you: the reason Trump gets mocked is because of the manner he mock others for their gaffes. You attempt to rationalize those errors just highlight trump's issues and hypocrisy.
Trump has to regularly take cognitive assessment tests, then brags about doctors telling him he did perfectly, which they tell everyone who takes those tests regardless of how they did. Trump is so demented he shits his diapers and belongs in a nursing home.

Someone please ask trump this question. Do it as a multiple choice. He will get it wrong and then trump and dinesh will tell you it really came from Australia.

Sadly, this is correct. even more, it also confirms what was said in a conversation here on twitter last night:  that most of you never trumpers are pretty much going to revert once trump is ousted.
you answered your own question. those who truly understands the stakes knows that a third party vote is nothing more than a vote for trump. don't be fooled by the "but it about my vote to choose." argument they'll use.
God is SALIVATING for Trump's judgement day
Honestly I just want him to say "why would you tell people that I want to hurt God when I'm a devout churchgoer". I want someone, ANYONE, to make trump accountable LIVE for his vile, unsubstantiated rhetoric. I think that's fair and reasonable.
Twitter and Facebook remove Trump post saying kids are 'almost immune' to coronavirus
Exactly. Donald Trump has sure been acting un-American and yet Brigitte and her worshippers are just turning a blind eye to Donald Trump and think of him like he‚Äôs the supreme leader of the US who should be praised.
Shares of Tencent plunge after Trump's executive order on #TikTok and WeChat
2. Some people are already seeing student loans disappear. Trump is then returning us to a currency and digital system backed by gold which we have a lot of. The next couple months will be hard because of making sure all the kinks are worked out with the QFS
What's extra cool about this is that her opponent was a bogstandard Trump-lite chud that Democratic leadership insist are the "realistic" candidates for general elections.   We define reality with our choices.
President Trump on Thursday invoked his emergency economic powers to impose broad sanctions against TikTok, a move that steps up pressure on the Chinese-owned app to sell its U.S. assets to an American company.

Commission rejects Trump request on debate schedule change
Mr Trump, you should be ashamed of yourself to caution US citizens when traveling to Greece when you have 160K deaths in your watch. Shame on you
Look who is talking. The US State Department recommends more caution when traveling to Greece when the number of deaths is 160K. Shame on you Trump

This is misogyny 101. Talk down to a woman who is 100x stronger and smarter then Trump will ever be.  is the future!
Idiot haters can't even figure out. Let's see.. if Biden won't do interviews now and is too afraid to speak then either lets move them up or add more. But thinking is not an option for Trump haters.
Well that is what Trump haters do..
What a SURPRISE said no one ever. Twitter Staffer Who Announced Trump Censorship Used to Work for Kamala Harris...
Trump issued an executive order effectively banning TikTok if it doesn‚Äôt sell in the next 45 days  ŒºŒ≠œÉœâ
He has also gained support by cops and their families. I have seen liberals saying they will be voting for Trump. It also means EMT's, correction officers,  firefighters and medical staff that work close with them. That is a large group.
Do you have anything? Trump has dated a black woman so how racist can he be?
I guarantee trump calling it "thigh land" is because thats what he jokingly calls it with his pedo buddies when they go get some ladyboys.
This isn't her real account. Look for the one marked Mary L Trump - with a blue check mark. I think this is just a fan.

We knew before. Did you read Bolton‚Äôs book?  Bolton is also all about himself. That‚Äôs how he joined the Trump Administration.

Trump is a little piss boy
Just think, Trump has done more to block Tik Tok than: - contain the covid-19 virus - protects our soldiers from bounties placed by Russia. - help out small business &amp; the unemployed. - protect our elections from foreign interference. - formulate a working health care plan. #WTF
You know, I get why you would think about the VP pick as being a factor, but with every closing day trump moves one step closer to full on permanent dictator.  If you are unwilling to remove the cancer, then you are as ineffective as the GOP who enables him. and you criticize.
that's the argument you present?  the trump,"it is what it." comment? pathetic, and spoken as a trumpist. ("but i'm an independent" you'll claim... bullcrap.)  the fact that trump, hoarded the stockpile, failed to recommend (and ofter contracted) a mandate didn't factor in, huh?
This is dead on accurate. It's clear that they're going to revert after the election. that's they're going to call out for fake conservatism, testing to see how short everyone's memories are.  but sadly, this is a all hands on deck matter, we need their help to remove trump.

Curious to watch how pro Trump teachers behave.
he does not wanna get into specifics, well i doubt trump ever read the bible but he and the bible have at least that much in common.
then we can't worry about them, because they're blind to see facts anyways. this only means we need to step up.  but this is huge, no doubt about, and major blow to trump and putin.

And Trump, as you must surely know, personally kisses all of God‚Äôs booboos.
all this does is fall  into trump's narrative of what causes mail fraud. this needs to be nipped so he can't use it as an excuse.
That would be more convincing bullshit if you hadn't just spent four years making believe that Trump has ever taken money from Russia so he's unfit to speak to the American people.
Google and Facebook do the same thing. When is Trump banning them? üëÄ
I go on vacation to Phuket Thailand. (Read it out loud Trump).
Gang, I got nothin' tonight.  I'm worn out, and discouraged, and tired to the bone of #Covid19 and #Trump and no-good-option #SchoolReopening plans.    I'm 53, and I want a hug from my mom.  I'm tired of being upbeat and positive to bolster my sons.  Tomorrow is another day.
There's no shame. I believe Trump is an existential threat to people in the working class, but I want to see as many third party votes as possible as well.
So is #Trump the fake mom?
sad thing is, its not one man it's a foreign controlled network that created a party that took over a legit party and got trump in. Nixon may have survived if he had his own TV network. The medium is the message and trump controls the medium. #TrumpSucceedsByFailing

Just stumbled into this again before bed.  Here's a critique of the article worth mentioning. Sorry it's late by Twitter standards
16 days ago Trump said he was going to present a healthcare bill in 2 weeks.  Nothing Trump says means anything.  If someone can't see that by now, they probably NEVER will.
Make the Buffalo Sabres relevant again!
Trump might just as well issue an executive order repealing the law of gravity and run on everyone being able to float to work.  He has the same amount of power to do that as he does this...
So, I've got Sept 23 as the date #Trump says #Biden will outlaw puppies if elected. Anybody else want in on this? #tcog
trump was reading a teleprompter and said thighland and then corrected himself
Imagine being so desperately obsequious that you insist in the face of all evidence to the contrary that Trump‚Äîwho even corrects himself in the video‚Äîwas correct in pronouncing it ‚ÄúThighland‚Äù. I‚Äôve had friends from all over the English speaking world and no one says ‚ÄúThighland‚Äù.

Trump targets Canada, reimposing tariffs on aluminum
I agree Your father deserves our respect. Trump deserves nothing. I bet your Dad would support his friend Joe.
TikTok likely needed action against them but just remember that Trump acted faster against that than he did against COVID-19.
Personally, I'm stronger on my amendments . . .  For non-Americanists, maybe 8? Thinking about bad Trump cabinet officials is helpful.

not just trump, but the majority of the GOP as well. once the money trail gets exposed, everything will be exposed. everything.
Trump supporters should be mad that they were used.
then don't. If you really can't decide between trump and biden and the VP is the make or break, then no one needs you. Racist or not racist. really that is the choice. If the VP makes a difference then we know where your thoughts really lay.
Trump is worse.

Donald Trump doesn't have an ounce of Christian values in his entire body. Just look back at his entire life and what he has done. Why evangelicals support this man is beyond my comprehension.
This here is the exact problem. That said, Trump's rise has correlated with increase in race based violence. He has to go
These two groups don't really overlap. People who like Trump do so because he reinforces their white identity politics. People on the left who don't like Biden do so because he's too much like Trump. Some of them will vote for him anyway, but almost none will vote Trump.

If this is true, then you shouldn‚Äôt be supporting Trump.
So does alcohol and sex and fear and nicotine..... And trump lol
Personally, I think liberals (and anti-Trump people generally) and the media learned the lesson of 2016 too well, and have forgotten how close the election was. Small shifts in turnout can have huge impacts on the electoral map.

Yeah, not really disputing it, but thread is hilarious anyway ‚Äî to me, this election has become about corruption (and, frankly, exhaustion with Trump). I can imagine that others are likely the same, and therefore, higher turnout amongst those who want to defeat him.

That was signed into law by President Obama more than 10 years ago. It‚Äôs called Obamacare. When is the new comprehensive healthcare plan going to be revealed? Trump said it would be signed on August 2. #ObamacareProtectsPreExistingConditions

Even in the face of death, the Buffalo News must slight Trump, his family, and his name. Why? Because he dared challenge the establishment. 3 years in office vs Biden‚Äôs nearly 50 years in office, and the Buffalo News expects you to believe Trump is the problem. Don‚Äôt fall for it
So I am on the record...this election is not about Trump or Biden...or Pence or Harris..as they want your emotions to drive your vote...It‚Äòs about Prosperity, Freedom and respect  VS. Socialism, enslavement to government and the collapse of country. Vote for either, not a person.
Americans have heard this Russian disinformation for months and Biden is still up by double digits.  Delete your account.
Yes, it is.  Tornados and wildfires are a natural part of the ecosystem. Wildfires can be beneficial!  But what isn't good is the rate and intensity it's happening. But that doesn't take away from this being a beautiful atmospheric phenomena. Also, Biden's plan sucks!
You know Biden will be arrested before November 3rd right?
Johannes Leak cartoon highlighted Joe Biden‚Äôs ‚Äòoffensive language‚Äô | Sky News Australia
Delegate count already is overwhelmingly in favor of Biden / Harris.
I have thought about opening a Biden one right next to it but I'm a broke ass bitch  üòÇ
Oh for chrissake.... Just Google Ukraine.... Hunter Biden.... C'mon Man..... Kamala Harris being black.... Good grief ...if you had a real candidate l might listen. But you DONT. You....as in You ...would rather shit be burned down and looted . Good riddance Jimmy.
I‚Äôm mostly of the opinion Trump is only marginally worse than Biden but this is some evil villain shit
Next Trump will invite her to the debates - assuming he actually does any with Biden.    üôÑ
Broadly speaking, Biden‚Äôs executive actions and appointments will be less right wing than Trump‚Äôs. Period. That ought to be enough on its own, but more importantly, leftists might stop arguing about whether liberalism is preferable to fascism long enough to accomplish something.
I‚Äôm going to tell you why I missed you this morning ü§®. I‚Äôm still feeling some type of way about the ticket. I feel Warren was played by Biden &amp; wasted our time. I‚Äôm voting the ticket but I‚Äôm disappointed how Warren is treated &amp; AOC. I wasn‚Äôt in the mood to hear about ticketüò•
When Biden is president, he will answer questions
‚ÄúThank you Billie Eyelash and John Celebrity!‚Äù - Joe Biden
I don‚Äôt actually disagree with any of that, other than that it‚Äôs being used to defend not voting for Biden. You don‚Äôt have to have faith in liberals to see the political benefit to a democrat administration right now, unless you‚Äôre an accelerationist or something.
Or I don‚Äôt know, just for shits and giggles picking the most qualified person for the job regardless of what genitals they have or skin color they have. You know, for a goof.  like Biden should have done.  #rationalthinking
I just hope Biden doesn't say "let's let the country heal" and doesn't have them investigated.
If Biden wins, get ready for Trump to punish America
LMFAO.... Biden can't even form a coherent sentence ....at least Trump knows finances and has a set of balls to run the country and not sell it off to "others"
Biden/Harris win after a battle royal and the forcible removal of Trump.
you are a fool.trump has done more in less than 4 years than biden and bubba s girl have done in 60.wake  up
Oh she loves Biden
We should have been in the streets from the minute he was installed as President-this is just like Belarus,it‚Äôs a fucking hostile takeover of Democracy
What's the explanation thenm? Do you genuinely believe your vote won't be counted? Do you genuinely believe that there's no benefit to a Biden presidency as compared to a Trump presidency? Is voting that much of a drain on your time? Or do you just feel good about saying that?
So you're voting Biden?
Let‚Äôs agree to disagree. If Biden gets elected our way of life is over (my opinion of course). You win. If he gets elected remember this exchange.
meaning that if you're a leftist and trying to make a virtue of not voting for Biden, you're an idiot.
Biden voters seem nice.
I‚Äôll bet anything the corona virus will all depend on who wins in November. Biden wins, it‚Äôs gone. Trump wins, it comes back and economy shuts down again
Did I ever say I stay inside????? Let me guess ..you support Trump...his constant incorrect comments about Biden...some of us are trying to follow the damn guidelines!
Gotta be close to the size of the Biden boat parade!?!?
Biden across the board
FLASHBACK: The Obama-Biden Administration Removed Thousands of USPS Collection Boxes
You watch the press at the end of a Biden presser it's like they're solemnly leaving a funeral. You watch them at the end of a Trump presser it's, screeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
Lmao at "brainwashing" .... Biden can't speak a fluid fucking sentence and you know it. I'm not brainwashing anybody... It's clear as day. Good grief.
Shed all the light you want.  The choice is simple: Biden or Trump.  What‚Äôs worse, a VP too tough on crime, or four more years of what we‚Äôve seen for the last four?
I can't wait to cast my vote in November for Biden/Harris!!!!!
Obama-Biden removed over 12,000 boxes over five years, according to the USPS-IG.   Do a little research before you make yourself look silly.
Seeking to amplify his law-and-order message, President Donald Trump on Friday told hundreds of New York Police Department officers that ‚Äúno one will be safe in Biden‚Äôs America‚Äù if the former Democratic vice president defeats him in November.
Not surprised!!! Maybe be a winner for once #trump2020 but you like to take from hard working people so Biden fits you
trumps inept sit tight.. some1 should handle this clown regardless of biden. we dont need biden whatsoever thats fs
Hope that‚Äôs in addition to the 36% who now approve Trump? So, that‚Äôs 72% that won‚Äôt be voting for Biden/Harris! I like that math! ü§£‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏
And ole Biden is a wizard of words. But his followers are all soooo smart. Lmao. Go back to hating America. Have a great day.
One. Three anti-Trump signs. One Biden sign.
It‚Äôs a fucking binary choice now.  It‚Äôs not the primaries.  You either vote for Biden or you vote for Trump/don‚Äôt vote.  You‚Äôre not going to magically elect some third person that‚Äôs a perfecf reflection of liberal ideals.  Grow up.
if it were Tulsi, Yang or even Klobs then id watch the qberts cry, but its fukin BIDEN so stop it
WRONG, admit that youre wrong. Trump is holding the handbrake around turns biden wont. He will stage his own death or be taken out by pelosi goons. so stfu. trump won because hes NOT pelosi/hillary- biden shit himself worse than bernie&amp; it's only August
that doesn't mean biden is some type of answer. eff that donkey dildo. We can #Boycott2020 and then force trump tfoh, trust me. electing biden not only allows trump to skate, but also threatens to continue this situation for 8 more years rather than 4
k well.. WE DON'T NEED BIDEN OR HIS UGLY STRAY TRAMP TO REMOVE TRUMP
If Biden wins, arrest them all. The charge: treason (tampering with our election to aid and abet Russian President Putin).
That time when Barack Obama and Joe Biden removed thousands of mail collection boxes to suppress the vote in 2020.
Fact checking Trump in Canada. Reality check: A look at Trump‚Äôs recent claims on Biden-Harris, U.S. economy - National |
Biden's policies are identical to Trump's lmfao. The "lesser evil" in this case is NOT less evil in any qualitative way. Voting for either of these assholes is clownery of the highest order. Once you unlearn electoralism, you can learn how real political change is made.
This will predictably blow up in their faces and perhaps put Montana, Kansas, Alaska, and Maine district 2 in play for Biden. GOP Senate candidates in those states must be apoplectic.
Fox news is as believable as it is unbiased. I believe Obama probably doesn't think much of the clown-in-chief's ability to be president. The choice is clear. Biden for president if you want America to live through COVID. #FakeNews #MAGA #FoxNews
But it was Biden who told them to remove him or he‚Äôd withhold funding.
C'mon... You know that answer. It's ALWAYS deflection. Joe Biden isn't a Racist either. That's next in the playbook.
Just thinking that there should be a place in Biden's administration for Lt.Col. Vindeman and Captain Brett Crozier.
5 high speed mail sorting machines were removed from the main post office in Buffalo NY it's obvious why. Trump could care less for the needy, their mail, meds, doesn't care about the aged or poor. But he'll build a vanity wall on taxpayers $s, but not aid the USPS. VOTE 4 BIDEN!
Bahahahahahaha! I‚Äôd vote for Daffy Duck before I‚Äôd vote for mentally incompetent Biden
Don't expect trends in #election #polls we're seeing nationally to produce quite the same results this November in #WNY: Seven local counties are a traditional Republican stronghold.  READ MORE:   #COVID19 #politics #Biden #Trump #Buffalo #NewYork
I've been a full time UberEats driver since the pandemic started. I drive through the side streets of every neighborhood in Greater Buffalo 9 hours a day. In all that time I've seen a total of 3 Biden signs.
Vice President Biden has a normal relationship with the press. You are defective .
Joe Biden hairy legs
If that was gonna happen then the people on the left would be embracing Biden. They aren‚Äôt man. Bernie has been attempting to pull votes that way under the guise of pushing Biden left. Unsuccessfully. Biden‚Äôs been right of center most of his career till Obama. Promise
Every will liberal in America flip out and demand to speak to a manger because like Briahna Joy Grey will say "Biden wont improve healthcare" and meanwhile Scotland has been throwing up and in in the high 90s since forever
"His teeth were like Chiclets all over the stage " Stephen Colbert says about Joe Biden and I did a political cartoon of Joe Biden on stage knowing that there's a bomb in his teeth that Michelle Obama had a button for...  #qanon
Wym when you say radical leftist? The left does not want Biden as their candidate. The Democratic Party does. The actual people on the ‚Äòradical‚Äô left wanted Bernie. The left and the Dems are not the same man. Biden isn‚Äôt controlled by anyone but the insurance corps backing him
Biden is going to hand hillary the reins. thats how trump won in 16. At least we know what we got. Biden is a pushover and we would be stuck with potentially 8 years of hillary/hallibrton war pigs. Frost is right, trump made a bit of peace in the mideast.
Even if their own Democrats in the primary gave her 2% and now she's going to be vice president come on man ad Joe Biden would say
Obama was elected Prez not only because he was a young, historically charismatic candidate that promoted new, hopeful ideas, but because he also had an AMAZING ground game that mobilized thousands upon thousands of volunteers nationwide. Biden has literally none of the above.
Yes, this is one million percent it. Sadly, for too many Biden supporters, their main method of winning this election is browbeating voters instead of realizing that they haven't reckoned with the fact that base-building/campaigning happens through difficult, prolonged efforts.
Biden does not want to defund the police. This is false. He just took a cop as his VP. Think about it
It's also pretty tone deaf when white Biden/Dem supporters are yelling at other whites to vote lesser evil to help marginalized ppl, when statistically it's the marg'd ppl who aren't voting (because they're the ones who are keenly aware of how little changes from these elections)
QUEEN ANGELA DAVIS herself has repeatedly endorsed Kamala Harris for VP &amp; said she‚Äôd support her in a presidential bid. That means we‚Äôre voting for Joe Biden in Nov  Quit listening to that bummy nigga down the block telling you she the police. Seek knowledge from those who know
‚ÄúNo OnE cOuLd HaVe kNoWn‚Äú except for Biden and people who don‚Äôt work at FactCheck.
You really think Mr. "They're gonna put ya'll back in chains" Biden is a safe bet for uniting the parties?
Khizr Khan: 'Trump may damage American democracy permanently'  #subscriptions #feedly
It doesn‚Äôt stop with Biden; our movement isn‚Äôt even close to coming to fruition with him in office. I would love to see an explanation as to why he is a fascist, but my argument is that while I do not endorse everything he stands for, it‚Äôs crucial to work to elect him.
It‚Äôs time for the Country to heal. Time for law and Order. Time to criminally charge the lawless radical Democrats Obama, Biden, Clinton, Pelosi, Schumer, Comey, and all others involved in Obamacare. There actions harmed American lives!
Another indictment of the outrageous Obama-Biden-Kerry Billion $ gift to the Iran dictators.
They should have sealed indictments ready in January and, assuming he is invited, serve supeana at Biden inauguration and arrest him there. Frog walk him in front of country.
Biden/Harris win but Trump and his minions never stop with nonsense and we deal with this for the rest of our lives.
What's with your posts about our children? Speaking of ripped apart...oh um yeah I think you know what I'm talking about. The only thing I'm scared about is mine living in a future robbed of their freedoms. Open your blinders. Oh, and Biden may be dead before Donald.
Duh no it does not no different than Trump having Russianin the WH right after firing Comey day he got rid of the‚Äù Russian Problem ‚Äú what are you insinuating? Obama and Biden had a scandle free 8 years trump never had 8 daysüò°You should be censored as a agent of Russia with lies
Joe Biden will get busy on trump during the debatesü§™We have not forgotten the2016 Stalking on stage and his redicious answers like trumps givesbully name calling Moderates must control him
By then end of this post office thing, it will have backfired so badly on Trump that it may put Montana, Alaska, Kansas and Maine-2 in play for Biden.
Things I won‚Äôt do this fall vote for Biden and Harris run out of soap tp hand sanitizer and rice. Nor will I fall blindly off a cliff with the rest of the American Sheeple
Trump is for not holding abusive cops responsible for those abuses. And that's why the Police Union is supporting Trump---they're afraid Biden/Harris make it easier to sue cops for the abuses they commit while on the job.
Reminders here that, however ham-handed Biden is on race &amp; gender, however uninspiring his policies, however batty he may be, he's a wonderfully caring person -- between that &amp; just knowing how tf the gvt works, we'll be ok if we can get him into office:
We can't let these two anywhere near the White House just take a look at the Democratic cities now you really want that for our country as Biden says come on man
Probably. Everyone Biden and Trump supporters alike should be glad Trump is doing this
It seems like the USPS union is trying to influence and election. They openly endorsed Joe Biden. How can they be trusted with mail in ballots????
So if not voting for Biden is a vote for Trump, and not voting for Trump is a vote for Biden... They cancel each other out!
Hey of course they will, Biden will take their power away, trump will give them more power.  Don‚Äôt everyone understand yet, this mainly about power. When u have it, u will do anything not to lose it, no matter the facts.
Chinese State Media Applauds Kamala Harris: She ‚ÄòPunished Criminals Ruthlessly‚Äô  ALL PROPAGANDA, WAS RIGHT WHERE CHINA'S WANTS ARE FOR THIS ELECTION. BIDEN IN CHINA'S POCKET!
I've been told time and time again that if I withhold my vote from Biden, I am using my white privilege/voting for Trump/hurting marginalized people.  From now on, I will direct all such people to this amazing thread by an elected official of color explaining why that's garbage.
So she either 1) throws frivolous allegations of racism at white males, 2) truly believes Joe Biden is a racist, or 3) both. What a joke Kamala is
Jill Biden put your husband in a home before he embarrasses himself on the national stage Have mercy on him
On the Millennial/Gen Z border, supported Kamala in the primaries fully on board with Biden/Harris 2020
Trump gets endorsement of NYC police union, warns 'no one will be safe in Biden's America'
She was Obama‚Äôs pick, Biden‚Äôs price for his endorsement.
The Biden-Harris ticket won't win over progressives.  The Independent Women's Forum represents dying Reagan Republicanism.
Harris/Biden gets in they have carte blanche
I read late last night that after the election &amp; "God" willing Biden wins, there will be new and additional laws, amendments to cover the shit that's currently taking place so it never happens again. Democracies have taken for granted fascist dictatorships can't happen. They are.
So what‚Äôs your take on the Teacher‚Äôs union endorsing Biden?
Is Joe Biden is not competent for office?
Biden can‚Äôt and America knows it.
Dems like to say that you are what you identify as. Kamala says she's black. (We all know she "ain't black"). "If you don't know whether to vote for me or Trump, YOU ain't black"-Joe Biden. KH is voting for Biden so she MUST BE "Black".  Dems are sooooo weird!
It‚Äôs also reassuring to note that the postal union is backing Biden/Harris.
Vote for Biden. The country can‚Äôt handle four more years of his ineptitude.
Trump inherited the slowest economic recovery in history. He created more jobs in the last three months than Obama/Biden did in 8 years.
Or the Post Office endorsing Biden.
Just because I support Trump over Biden doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with everything he says or does. I understand why people don‚Äôt like him, and I don‚Äôt like some of the stuff he does too, but I just can‚Äôt do Biden dawg
The thing I like the least about Biden is his repeated insistence that post-Trump, the GOP will simply go back to being a normal political party. That‚Äôs magical thinking. The remaining ones will get more radical &amp; conspiratorial.
Joe Biden is a running a campaign enterprise seeking election for President of the United States of America. You are running a criminal enterprise, the likes of which rival the Gambino Crime Family.
Fuck all of them ! I‚Äôll drop my ballot off at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave . right at Donnie‚Äôs doorstep üòÇ. Or I‚Äôll just text him saying I vote Biden . He texts his messages to the world that way so he should accept a text vote reply .
Biden is a Catholic In Name Only as is Pelosi. Biden has recently "reverted" to Islam.
Biden has "reverted", as the Muslims say, to Islam. Biden is NOT a Catholic.
Definitely not inaccurate.  An interesting distinction in that some BLM supporters don't support Biden/Harris inherently with cognitive dissonance, rather it's a means to an end (Trump). While Gadsden example typ isn't supporting police as a means to a loosely related goal.

BIDEN / HARRIS  2020 :  "COP a FILL"
I think it has something to do with the fact that you are an outrageously large failure of a President - and Joe Biden isn‚Äôt - you are the one the press should be asking questions... sorry it hurt your feelings ‚ùÑÔ∏è
Either way on January 20, 2021 you‚Äôre out of there and Biden will be installed as president
Biden is such a fraud Wont take questions They are hiding him until the elections and the in the bag press/media is party to their deception
How could anyone with a brain listen to the windbag Hillary Clinton She still hasn‚Äôt gotten over her loss Why would anyone give this gasbag the time of day Do you really want the same old corrupt 40 yr politicians who have become wealthy ripping Americans off What has Biden done
He was so corrupt for years that US never threatened to cut off funding to Ukraine UNTIL he started poking around VP Biden sons company he ‚Äúworked‚Äù for. And you see no coincidence in this? US didn‚Äôt want him removed until Barisma investigation.  Also, it was 100% a quid-pro-quo!
I thought Joe Biden said if he gets elected he will have Dr Fauci as his advisor and follow the science Dr Fauci just said ‚Äúhe sees no problem with voting in person at the polls ‚Äú Joe already is lying to you
Of course they endorse Trump. He‚Äôs the ‚Äòlaw and order‚Äô President. It‚Äôs not right, but hopefully it won‚Äôt hurt Biden. #VoteHimOut #VoteBidenHarris2020
Once you get out of the Conservative news bubble? Maybe that because the Liberal news bubble won‚Äôt legitimately cover it. They came into it saying the Bidens did nothing wrong. W/Trump they came into it w/narrative trying to find evidence to fit that but not w/Biden &amp; Ukraine
Constitution be Damned: Biden Announces Ineligible, Dual-Citizen, Sen. Kamala Harris as his Running Mate - The Post &amp; Email
We must focus on the real issues at hand - like whether Joe Biden is advocating for sharia law, which now must be the first thing that comes to mind when someone mentions your name.
Everyone knows that if,(god help us all) Biden wins, he will be gone by June. People are voting for the suddenly black woman.
Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report  #FoxNews
Do you actually think Pelosi Schumer act in the best interest of Americans? Do you think the FBI CIA DOD act in one the best interest of Americans? Does Biden act in our best interest  when he get sweet deals from China &amp; Ukraine for Hunter? We‚Äôve been sold out for decades.
Nope, that's Biden
I don't see Biden's picture on it ü§î
POSTAL UNION ENDORSES BIDEN WHILE TRUMP ATTACKS USPS
Then why are you so against Biden? It‚Äôs one or the other. Pick one to vote for, use your right as an American citizen and help choose who to bitch &amp; moan about the next 4 years. If you don‚Äôt vote you don‚Äôt have the right.
There‚Äôs your Biden supporters right there...and Trump supporters are deplorable! Smh
Lemme get this straight:  The FBI did this in 2017, after Trump was already in office, but the right wing conspiracy nuts are frothing at the mouth to tie him to Obama and Biden, who were no longer in office?
Worth retweeting my own tweet based on the dumbass crap I‚Äôve seen on Twitter today. GFY and admit you‚Äôre a Dem. Neoliberal = Dem. Bush Alum 4 Biden = Dem. stop pretending.
of harm reduction of another four years of Trump. Without question the Patriot Act infringes on the rights of Americans to this day, but to equate Biden to Trump as a fascist is an extremely dangerous tactic.
There you go again talking out of your mouth from both sides whatever suits you that day is how you speak first Biden was a horrible person now he's the best thing since sliced bread you're nothing but a joke
The argument isn‚Äôt coming from the standpoint of ‚ÄúBiden can do no wrong‚Äù it‚Äôs that a vote for Biden would be a vote against Trump‚Äôs blatant fascistic tendencies‚Äîfederal police black bagging people off the street in Portland, tear gassing peaceful protesters in DC‚Äîin the hopes...
You had 8 years to take care of that problem &amp; what did the Obama / Biden ticket do for Social Security?
And this folks is your average Biden supporter
Why are postal workers helping? Their union endorsed joe biden! Where are your balls postal worker union? We are allowing the orangutan and his minions to steal the presidential election! WAKE UP!!!!!!
My Family has served in the Military my Brother served in the Navy for 8 years so shut it #VoteTrump2020 Biden is a joke!
It's only safe and secure when you have to request one, Biden tweeter feed filler person.
How about this show me ONE thing that proves Trumps a pedophile like Biden just one legitimate thing
That‚Äôs too bad.  Sorry they endorsed Biden but not surprised
Wake up ? Biden has not done anything in 40 yrs in Gvmt except to steal millions from Ukraine ! What about the Water Island he owns in the Bahamas ! There is so much to say ...Biden isn‚Äôt going to be President! You‚Äôre too dumb to know any if that . You better wake up !
A sobering takeaway from my cold call conversation with Team Biden: I was expecting pushback when I said Biden‚Äôs a corrupt, imperialist war monger who doesn‚Äôt care if every person gets healthcare. Instead I got acknowledgement that I‚Äôm right. But vote anyways? Such a low bar
That's weird, I don't see Holly S. in this clip, I see Joe Biden.
I drove from my home south of Buffalo to Pittsburgh and back today. A 6 hour trip. I saw dozens of Trump flags and stickers, but only ONE Biden bumper sticker. And it was on a car with Ontario, Canada plates üòÇ Hey...wait, foreign interference????? MULLER!!!
Yeaaa wasent talking about an underage girl there smart one, but Biden on the other hand... are u legally blind? Must be or your iq is 10
Agree... Drove PA to Cumberland MD yesterday ...TONS of Trump/Pence. Then today to Mount Union...same story. Only l saw ZERO Biden.
You and I both know Biden and every other Democrat would bring that up 24/7
That‚Äôs comparing apples to oranges. Emails weren‚Äôt given to  Trump they were released to the public via Wikileaks. So what if China hacks Trump and gets his tax returns and it shows, it doesn‚Äôt, that he‚Äôs in debt to Russia are you saying Biden won‚Äôt EVER discuss it?
Kind of like Wall Street lapping praise one Kamala and Biden. Wells Fargo heads ect
I‚Äôm sick over this as I don‚Äôt vote FOR people I vote AGAINST. I only voted Hillary in 2016 as I KNEW Trump was a piece of shit when I was 17 ! I don‚Äôt care for Biden but it‚Äôs either him or Trump . Fuck both of them overall üò°
What is the Biden/Harris plan for a sound future for the USPS and it‚Äôs 600,000 employees (including about 100,000 military veterans)?
Oh god! I think she‚Äôll be sworn in by 2022. No way Biden survives a full term
He‚Äôs done . I don‚Äôt like ANY politicians . Left wing or right wing it‚Äôs all the same bird . A true hippie/boomer doesn‚Äôt support the system . It‚Äôs not who I vote for it‚Äôs who I vote against . Same in 2016 . Voted for HRC as I did NOT want Trump . Biden should‚Äôve entered then .
If you can convince 10 of your friends to show up for a local race they may actually feel some stake in they will probably throw a vote to Biden anyway without you having to convince them to show up for him.
Tara Reide accused Biden of rape
Read a great article that  was sharing a while back that said if you‚Äôre in the ‚Äúnot pleased about Biden but hope he wins‚Äù crowd you should get people fired up about local races.
Facts are straight. She said ‚Äúbelieve all women‚Äù, Biden was accused of rape.
Yeah absolutely no way anybody watches the debates and comes out voting Biden. As someone in the middle who voted Jill Stein in 2016, I realized everything I heard about Trump was a straight up lie. I guarantee I'm not the only one who woke up to the bs since the last election
I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs why Biden is piling over him
If you won't let me be your Biden, then let me be your favorite president #Trump #water

If I had ever used Photoshop before I would Photoshop Joe Biden into a Black Flag t-shirt
The biggest difference between the Presidential Race in 2020 and that of 2016 is that this time your going to get your orange butt handed to you. I predict next year this time you will be in jail. Biden/ Harris 2020!!!!!! Riding with Biden!!!!!!
You Liberals are stupid! Seeing how you all have no problem with what Clinton did paying Uk/Russian spies for Trump dossier I was asking if it‚Äôs ok for Trump to do the same with Ukraine spies for a Biden dossier. Try following along better before you chime in.
Biden And Obama Might Be In Hot Water ‚Äì New Evidence Places Them In The Room During Flynn Discussion
Yes there‚Äôs a difference, one campaign was a active participant in election interference and one was non-active. So you‚Äôre telling me that you‚Äôd be ok with Trump paying Ukrainian spies for dirt on Biden?
"When I argued that we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security as well! I meant Medicare/Medicaid. I meant veterans benefits. I meant every single solitary thing, in the gov't. I not only tried it once. I tried it twice. I tried a 3rd time &amp; a 4th time." Joe Biden

Something ‚Äòstrange and disturbing‚Äô came from Biden, Kamala Harris appearance   | Sky News Australia
Oh, I will crawl through broken glass to vote for Biden/Harris
I think Biden‚Äôs has a lot more potential voters that don‚Äôt work and lack transportation to vote.
The Republicans have tried for forty years to destroy the central government. With Trump, they have succeeded. Now we're a planetary embarrassment and a nearly complete failure as a nation. I just sent $100 to Biden/Harris. Hope it works.
I can't help but feel like there is a slight power struggle between the Obamas, and the Clintons. In that scenario, it's obvious Biden is more in the Obama camp
If you vote for Trump now, you will cement a dictatorship. At least with Biden you can try again in four years.
Not a surprise at who's leading in the state, but this pegs Biden at about the same as Obama and Clinton got there the last 3 elections, with 12% still up for grabs. It's likely he will end up getting the largest share of the vote in CA since FDR got 67% in 1936.
Fuck that worthless Biden.
I‚Äôm on your side Adam,and I just know that both Biden and Kamala will be ready for this fall Presidental race this fall. I like Kamala,she‚Äôs all heart!!
He couldn‚Äôt even win her own State in a primary so she dropped out did you forget her primary numbers give me a break she‚Äôs locked up more Black people than Joe Biden from her policies
Do you want me to send you a picture of my Biden sign when it gets delivered? It might be a couple weeks because the current asshole in the white house is fucking with the USPS but it'll get here
I may not be big on politics,I think that it‚Äôs a great thing that Biden has chosen Kamala!! I totally agree with you Adam! You said it right! Priorities are a must l!! Kamala is perfect for  Biden. Trump doesn‚Äôt have a chance!?
In picking Harris, Biden makes history and plays it safe
Infuriating that you would really,truly peddle this nonsensical bullshit knowing goddamned well this is your dictator trumps mess...This is exactly what he has done and why we're still in this predicament. Last I checked Biden doesn't have authority to do anything.... YET
A pandemic is all the more reason for helping workers make ends meet. Clyburn acts like only Whites are working and will benefit from the payroll tax cut. He is the one Biden will put back in chains while most Blacks finally get off the Democrat Plantation.

Trump can't go down a ramp, can't make coherent sentences, can't close his umbrella, can't hold his glass with one hand, can't go upstairs without assistance sometimes, etc. Considering he's also basically the same age as Biden, you're wrong. Also none of us nominated Hilary sooo
wait if they're well informed, doesn't that mean they know why they're voting for Biden? instead of being a braindead Trump supporter?
Another swing and a miss for the Biden campaign as everyone was asking for Cardi B to sign WAP
No, but you'd need to be a racist to even point that out, because it's obvious. And I'm a creep? How? There's literally dozens of videos of Biden making women and little girls uncomfortable, maybe I'm just a creep because unlike you I have enough of a conscience for honesty.
Denying that would be the delusional thing. Or maybe you haven't heard that speech Biden gave where he did a freudian slip about how black kids were just as smart as white kids? Or the one where he talks about how he likes kids on his lap to pull on his hairy legs?
Rich I hope you guys get your way at this point I don‚Äôt give a fuck!!! I just hope who Ever are president is he does a good job for America. Biden or Trump. So put that in your pipe and smoke it.

This piece is tone deaf. She is a first term congresswoman who actively campaigned against, and still overtly disdains the nominee overwhelmingly chosen by democratic voters. She has said her and Biden shouldn't be in the same party. I am pissed she even has a 60 second spot.
i dont care about mail sorting machines and removing mail boxes. to be honest, i dont care about biden or trump, they're both idiots. im just saying, stop acting like the USPS is some sort of pinnacle of efficiency lmao

I mean, Trump has come very close to inciting violence upon members of the press. Biden has declined to answer shouted questions. It is evil to conflate the two, and Frank should show some shame.
Trump didn't say money per month, the Dems did though. If they are holding it up it's because they want more money for the people.
Are you serious? We‚Äôve had a fake republic for decades. These people don‚Äôt work for us,  they work all work for themselves. Biden‚Äôs been wrong on every important foreign policy decision or opinion for decades. He‚Äôs a corrupt buffoon.

Biden and Kamala were by far the two least popular among the voters during the primaries. But most popular among big money. And that doesn‚Äôt make a single lib question how they got these two? Good grief
He's worried he'll loose to Biden
I'm assuming your saying the same thing about biden according to Sen Harris right?
I will say. Literally every candidate has flaws. Biden nor Harris were my first choices but I'll be damned if I let that be what keeps Trump in office. Right now it's anyone but Trump. In 2024, then we can really try to nail down candidates (and hopefully not have just 2 parties)
Anything to get Biden/Harris in office!
The WH reporters should be asking the harder questions of trump and holding him accountable that is thier job. Biden is irrelevant for that setting. They are another check in the system. I feel they are hard enough but chanel and crew are the weakest!
What?! You know the reason you don‚Äôt see many Biden signs? Because Trumpers are crazy. I know plenty of people that have them, but they‚Äôre waiting until closer to election time to put them out because they don‚Äôt want them stolen or worse.
No you have to be... don‚Äôt you understand that if you disapprove of Biden or think he is a creepy and failed centrist who has done far more harm than good in his political career, you then must love Trump?!

The idea is that Biden is entitled to votes, and anyone who votes 3rd party instead is somehow denying him something that's rightfully his and therefore helping Trump. I don't think 3rd party voting makes strategic sense, but the "helping Trump" argument is obviously false.

She is a phony, she's not black. I thought she was the first Indian Senator? But now she the black VP candidate, how does that work. She believes Joe Biden sexually harassed 3 women but now not so much? And that's just the tip of the iceberg.
Exactly.  I have been asked why I support Biden bc of what he has done over 48 years; OMG if I got judged by my choices and mistakes even 10 years ago I would be upset. People change with experience and age!
There was really no way Biden could announce a VP without:  -Old wounds being re-opened for Sanders supporters -Those wounds being exacerbated by every fucking lib yelling YOU DAMN BERNIE BROS BETTER FUCKING FALL IN LINE

Wrong. Biden needed to build a broader coalition and move his platform toward the middle.  Instead he pandered to the far left and didn‚Äôt build shit.  Already has California and already has ‚Äúthe black vote‚Äù so while I love Kamala as a politician, there were better choices.
I think something is getting lost in this because everyone is paying attention to Biden screwing up ho's...i mean her name. He says "thats why I wanted to be last in the room when he made the decision"....what? Who made the decision??
And you know what‚Äôs sad? I think Covid helped. I also think it hurt Biden to pick Kamala over Warren, only because with Warren he can appeal to younger Dems with her and older Dems with himself.

Are you kidding? Vote Biden. Unless you want Trump back.
CY Vance will get him first.  The for the ultimate irony Biden should name Hillary AG and let her have a go at him.  However, I think he will nominate Hillary to the Supreme Court.
When Biden becauses president, it will not be a time to relax. We need to press him on the issues like we would do with anyone in power in order to achieve equality. #BLM

Yup, the correct strategy to win the election against Donald Trump is to rabidly attack anyone in a blue state that will vote 75% democrat that doesn‚Äôt worship Biden
This is completely fictional. Biden‚Äôs plan does not guarantee every American healthcare AT ALL. There is literally nothing that supports your claim

U being mislead, absentee voting is much different, it's not the same system and nobody parading for joe biden, doing anything for jim crow joe, keep letting  mislead u. Check out the communications act of 1934.

The issue is, will she actually stand her ground, have strong convictions, be able to make her stated progressive policies be things the Biden campaign adopts, so that they can become reality? That's the reassurance progressives are looking for.   And we have not bn getting that
Not according to studies that show tens of millions will not have healthcare because they can‚Äôt afford it under Biden‚Äôs plan
Americans were literally just polled and 70% of them support it, with around 80% of Democrats. Its not a prop, we want people to be able to survive. We want Biden to support a policy that a majority of the American people support and will save countless lives.
So many potential actions are inhibited by Democrats saying we don‚Äôt want to open that Pandora‚Äôs box.  It is possible that Barr will indict Obama, or Biden, or others in his administration. If he Opens the box then it must be no holds barred

He's in CA. The way the electoral college works. There's no way his vote to nominate Bernie affects the general vote for Biden in CA in November.   I'm in a similar situation cause I live in NY. Im gon write in Bernie but in NY that still means Biden will win NY

I'm typically  not, but this is serious shit going on with the USPS.  I've been expecting for the last two years that Trump would do anything to rig the election and will refuse to accept the outcome if it shows a Biden-Harris win.  Plus he has Barr in his corner.

Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi.  Hear this loud and clear.  Just because the Dems have an outstanding ticket they will have zero chance of being elected.  Once Trump gets done with obstructing the vote the tally will be Trump 99%, Biden 1%.  Just like Saddam used to do.

OK. Let the racism begin: KH is indeed eligible under Article 1, Section 2 of the Constitution. Then the 13th Amendment regards citizenship. There's no question Harris is eligible. Do you think that Biden and his trillions of lawyers would put her forth if that weren't the case?
Further: if there are any surviving Biden-Clinton-Obama cracks, the fastest way to knit them shut is by quoting a Russian intel operation.

If voting for Biden were the same as voting for Trump, Republicans wouldn't be going out of their way, illegally, to prevent people from voting for Biden.
I was 40 in '94. I can attest to what the climate was like, what white people like me feared, how the rhetoric ran. Biden was kinda mainstream in that. That however, doesn't mean that it was good, wise, or somehow not racist.

I happen to agree with you about Biden, I've been saying the same thing this whole time. You're not the first person to think he's not the candidate, or will be on election day. Great job! ‚ù§
Joe Biden is calling for a nationwide mask mandate, citing health experts' predictions that it could save 40,000 lives over the next three months.
Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks  #FoxNews  SO WHY ONLY NEXT 3 MONTHS??? I'LL TELL YA, BECAUSE IT IS ABOUT ELECTIONS, NOT A VIRUS!
Hey Trump  Biden is a much better man than you.  He doesn't hold grudges, he doesn't lie, he tells it like it is  and  he picked the right person for the job,   go play a couple rounds of golf then go relax in your bunker.   America Will be Great Again BIDEN/ HARRIS 2020
Joe Biden Has Picked Kamala Harris as His Running Mate!
Kamala Harris will be waging her vice-presidential campaign within a culture that is happy to allow women their place‚Äîas long as they know their place.  writes:
How Kamala Harris as VP Can Be a Win for Progressives
Trump will not debate Biden!
Seems nice to have a guy speaking who doesn‚Äôt sniff and snort and loose his place! #Joe Biden
As Kamala Harris speaks with Joe Biden for the first time as running mates be sure to check out election coverage from  via
Nothing's going to help you in november lol, biden and trump are literally the same candidate  Stop bending over for a duopoly that's intent on repeatedly fucking you
Hope they prevail but Biden/Harris 2020 is not the forward-looking progressivism that is required to meet the moment. Their message to the working-class is ' sure we wont give you economic justice but wont tell you to inject yourself with disinfectant either'. Feckless leadership
Biden + Harris: so appealing to progressives!
You can watch live!  Biden is expected to make his first public appearance with Senator Kamala Harris, his running mate, at 3:50 p.m.!
Keep in mind that once Biden resigns Kamala will get to pick her own VP, and who do you think that's going to be? #kamaladidntkillherself
If anything happened to President Biden, I‚Äôd be perfectly content with President-elect Harris taking over, knowing the nation was still in intelligent, sane, and safe hands. And that, to me, is another reason why she‚Äôs a great pick for VP.
Something WILL happen to Biden‚Äî-guaranteed-declared incompetent or whatever
We cannot provide the DT administration fuel to get him elected again. Take these two, Biden and Harris, for now.
I was looking forward to her in the primaries tear into Biden‚Äôs 40 years of nonsense and she really only called him a racist.  VP debates are minimally important.
How is it that people are cheering for Joe the Molester Biden and Kamala incarcerate black people Harris !! It‚Äôs like these people will never wake up !! Trump 2020 üá∫üá∏
No her mom is Indian her dad is light skinned Jamaican -black she has maybe 5% black If that but show is claiming to ‚Äúidentify as black‚Äù as she incarcerated more black people in her career than Biden
Yes she‚Äôs incarcerated more black people than maybe even Joe Biden himself
"hey Lois I'm gonna say the n word nyeahahhahaa" "But üÖ±Ô∏èeetahhhhh if you say the n word too much they'll make you the democratic candidate for president", Cut away to Joe Biden in his 'Vette going 70 through a school zone telling those n word kids to get out of his goshdamn way
I don‚Äôt get this dynamic.  She way underperformed in the primaries.  I kept waiting for her to get after it but she stalled and stalled.  I don‚Äôt give the 2% polling much reverence but I can only point to the lack of enthusiasm for Biden here.  I do think she‚Äôs a good choice.
If it‚Äôs irrelevant, why are so many so eager to watch her debate Pence, but have yet to mention their enthusiasm for Biden to debate Trump?
The Senate is America‚Äôs Most Structurally Racist Institution
Its certainly not because she has any qualifications.   Maybe she is good on her knees and Biden liked it.
Kamala literally called Biden a rapist (which he is).
I saw the word Alzheimer's in the trending tab below a Biden topic for like a tenth of a second before the site refreshed and it was gone.   I'm not crazy.
Now that Biden has announced his VP, I‚Äôve realized the idea of a president is dumb af. Like why do do we waste so much energy just for some equally dumb and fucked up person to lead us?
Seriously? Do people honestly think Biden doesn't have an entire leg in the fucking nursing home already? He should legally be allowed to run for president. This entire election is a fucking circus. Biden wins, leaves office, Kamala steps in, chooses new VP, steps down. Hillary.
For every one of us annoying lefties grousing about the Biden/Harris ticket, there's someone else excitedly sharing the deepfake with their faces over Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion in WAP
If I lived in a swing state I'd be voting for Trump just to watch Biden fail, but since I live in NY which he'll have in the bag no matter what i'll probably be voting green.
No. Maybe if Biden had picked Karen I would have, but not now. You're a despicable human being Bernie Sanders, and you never believed a damn thing that came out of your mouth.
Doesn't sound at all like Biden at all good try tho, shows just how low you can go but I still think you haven't hit rock bottom yet your hair is still glued to your head
It means they have nothing but complete faith that Biden is capable to handle the job for a few hours.
So Biden is so incompetent that he let the mob chose his VP,  and then it actually ending up mattering more than the man, himself .. running for President.
Didn't Kamala call Biden out for his multiple sexual accusations?
Didn‚Äôt she call Biden a ‚Äúracist‚Äù? And how many black men do you think she put in prison for weed charges? And why isn‚Äôt Biden debating Trump?
Wasn‚Äôt Biden that picked her.
What a terrible choice for Biden and the Democrats!
Harris is also infinitely better than Biden
Learn how to f'ing talk  and you have the nerve to talk about Biden your worse than he ever was
I cannot even believe people are happy about the Biden and Blow duo smh
It's cool seeing women of color being super excited about Biden picking Harris as VP. But...  Isn't she involved with the police?! A cop VP is not something we need during this time while we're trying to defund/remove the police.

Catholics critical of Biden need to stfu and see the monster that helps. Besides, Catholics only pro life so their priests have a larger victim pool to abuse.

REMEMBER: Just couple days ago this pathetic Senator and Donald Trump's lapdog said "Biden prob will help Donald Trump get re elected"! He's doing all this bunch of garbage to help Donald Trump and punish  There's NOTHING to see here. What a pathetic LOSER!
Nope.  Kamala called out Biden's blatant racist policies during the debates, and then bowed down and licked the master's boots for a seat at the plantation table. She  contradicted BLM'S entire message and showed them it was ok to stay on the Dem plantation.
Lol thinking that these people are Biden supporters is hilarious. Obviously the Right is absolutely confounded by leftists. Too funny
She said she was going to vote for Biden and suddenly people expect her to be thrilled about doing so üôÑ
I only have a few over 100 followers, but I'm as ardent a Biden/Harris supporter as those with thousands. Only death will stop me from voting for them and every other Democrat on the ticket to rid this country of these shameful unamerican grifters.

Opinion | How Joe Biden's campaign manager changed his course - The Washington Post
Luckily, absentees, even this year, usually track very well with the in person vote. Bottom line: Biden needs to rack up huge in person election night numbers, then the absentees should follow along...
Is that Biden?
China is the worlds worst problem They do what ever they want with the environment! Joe Biden will help China continue to do what ever they want China owns Joe Biden and especially his son Hunter Biden!
Too bad that won‚Äôt cover the proposed cuts to the National Park Service in your 2021 budget plan. Thankfully Biden will make sure that never happens. Keep your pittance.

Truth is; if you or I had an uncle that acted half as bad as Trump, we'd either have him committed or take him out behind the shed and beat the shit of him. If it makes you feel better I'm not lookin real forward to b Biden being President. But it will be calmer and quieter.
Not to mention his impeachment for his roll in withholding funds unless Ukranians investigated Biden. Not a Biden supporter, but unfortunately he is the lesser of 2 evils. We can go on forever about this. Probably get no where.
The guy I replied to literally made up comments based on his opinion and not fact. Harris and Biden have both lied, do you call out their lies?  Wow.
if you think Biden is bad then  I've got some REALLY terrible news about who's President now. You better sit down in fact.
must offer  a high ranking position in his Administration. This woman is extraordinary. We need Elizabeth Warren in Biden Administration esp in Treasury Department. #BidenAdministration
Drove by an elderly dude (at least 70yo) walking in the middle of the street wearing a disposable mask with "BIDEN" written across it in black sharpie. Seems rather on brand for Albany

Does Biden/Harris and every other politician regret their lies?  Probably not.    Do you call out their lies as you just did Trump's? Probably not.
I find it funny how Bernie doesn't call out Biden's racist behavior and policies. Kamala did tho during the debate,let, and then bowed down to lick his boots for a seat at the plantation table.  Dems are such frauds.
That would be racist Biden
Me:  Biden‚Äôs policies killed my ex. I live in NY. I‚Äôm not giving him a meaningless vote.   Libs:  lol ok u know ur at fault if trump wins  Can you people not? Figure out how the electoral college works and stop minimizing people‚Äôs trauma. You gonna shame Tara Reade? He raped her.

I totally agree, but is it worse to have the Biden/Harris ticket accused of being afraid to debate? I don‚Äôt know the answer.

No he doesn‚Äôt. Their choice is Biden/Harris or a guy who cheats on his wife with porn stars and bursts into dressing rooms while teenage girls are changing
Vote for Biden or they'll be forced to become MAGA against their will.
I see very little value in Biden or Harris agreeing to debate. Trump and Pence will use debates as free airtime to spew their usual lies, and baseless attacks and distractions. Think how furious Trump would be to be deprived of a big stage to lie and distract.

Right now by just hating on Biden and Kamala we‚Äôre screwing ourself with swing voters and giving the rebulicans fodder for their news cycles.
We have to hold Biden and Kamala responsible for their fucked stances but bringing it up now distracts from the main goal, getting trump out. The goal is to get them elected then make a lot of noise about their past to make sure their future policies are what we want.
Not even a great metaphor because Biden is not chicken. Biden is a ball of lard. The choices are ball of lard or steaming dog shit with razor blades. Ball of lard is edible and the obvs choice, but sure af ain't appetizing or even healthy.

He knew when the Mueller report dropped he would just claim exoneration regardless of what the report said. Same thing on Nov 4. He will declare victory even if Biden wins by a landslide. Barr helped coverup the Mueller report, &amp; he'll help Trump overturn the will of the people.
Don't you dare give any credibility to the BS Biden and Harris are spitting out about going to bat for the little guy. Both are as slippery as they come.
I'll stand maskless and naked to cast my vote for Biden.
He's lost the respect of many by flip-flopping between candidates. The goal right now is getting trump out of the WH. Any/all complaining/whining/anger/frustration shld b directed  him not Biden or Harris. Without control of the WH and Senate we r in for 4 more yrs of hell.
It's hard to imagine that any man's family would be OK with someone doing this after a loved one's death

Hot take: Fascism is worse than neoliberalism. The two aren't comparable in the scope of harm they do.  Side note: Stop saying Biden is just as bad as Trump. You look stupid.
One of the things I think he is underestimating is how much people want to get rid of him.  I would stand on a bed of glass in 120¬∞ heat for 8wks just to cast a vote for Biden.  I‚Äôm not the only one in my circle.  People will vote however they have to to get rid of him.
Look folks, Biden and Harris are bad news, individually and together. But you can vote for the party that will be vulnerable, you can vote for the entrenched party to stay entrenched, or you can get out there and actually start killing every fascist in the country.

Understood. The problem is that under Obama/Biden abortions decreased to a rate lower than when Roe was decided, and Trump hasn't abolished Roe. So, rhetoric aside, Trump allows piles of dead babies, too. Is that really better?
Do not vote for Joe Biden. Progressives will get absolutely nothing.

Wow. You deflect from the media and Biden flat out lying? That's hilarious.
No one fears the racist Biden and the woman who traded sex for positions in state government.  The left already stated they didn't want Harris that's why she dropped out.  Nice try though. You should live in reality.
I have felt really torn since the 1st word of Kamala Harris as Biden‚Äôs running mate. On one hand as an Indian Man it‚Äôs amazing to see her come so far for us and for women; but on the other, it‚Äôs hard to feel she is little more than a piece on the Progressiveness checklist to him.
Biden and the media got caught lying, but sure deflect from it.
I'm no fan of Biden, but Biden never suggested we try Clorox. as for dem govs.  There's plenty of blame to go around. Nursing homes were given advance notice. everyone fucked up. No one was prepared for what happened. Those Govs should have monitored that situation better.
Nice try.  Make sure you hold Biden accountable for all his racist comments. I totally don't believe he's not a full blown racist.

Biden shouldn‚Äôt debate Trump. Trump will just lie and try to distract and smear. Biden should demand Trump release all his tax returns and financial documents as a condition of a debate. Then there would be NO debate.
What do you all think of Joemala?   I feel like the Biden/Harris ticket needs a celebrity nickname..#Joemala
WATCH: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris make their first appearance together since she was named as his running mate.
Would you be okay with Democrats lying, cheating and stealing an election?  Would you enjoy a Democrat President bullying anyone who disagrees with him/her?  Luckily, you don't have to worry about that happening. Biden-Harris want to unify the Country not sow hate.
Running an hour late isn‚Äôt the best first impression for the new Biden/Harris ticket.

Some insights on the Kamala Harris VP pick and what it could mean for #energy policy in a Biden administration from
Exactly! And a centrist Dem president will have to be more responsive to public pressure, because they'll be facing it from both sides. I don't support Biden, but he'll support what I DO support long before Trump will. If not, we get rid of him, but Trump is burrowing in.
I see so many people talkin about the problems with Biden/Harris.... okay.... but lets focus
Meanwhile we worry that if Biden is elected, ONLY the things Trump has done will be reversed. We need #Progress vs back to "normal"
Me &amp; my family shook hands with Vice Pres Biden after mass at a lovely Catholic Church while vacationing on Seabrook Island, SC several years ago. He graciously spoke with many parishioners before joining Jill who was patiently waiting in the car.  I have the photograph as proof.
Bishop falsely claims Joe Biden is not a Catholic ‚Äî and it doesn‚Äôt go well for him
She's so frigging smart that she called out Biden's racist polices and now is a leader on his racist plantation. Talk about hypocrisy.  Yeah she's smart alright.  LMFAO
Bwahahaha.  This is dumb. Her leadership? You mean the leadership where she calls out Biden's racist policies and then bows down and licks the boots of Biden the plantation owner in exchange for a seat at the table. Leftist hypocrisy writes itself. FOH.  LMFAO.
Totally. I was hoping for Kamala, but willing to vote for Biden no matter who he picked! We need that orange blob out of office!
This is just further proof liberalism is a mental disorder. Tears of joy for a VP pick who is nasty, traded sex for work, and then after calling out Biden's racist polices, bows down and licks the boots of the racist master. You wasted those tears of joy.
We don't have to engage in fantasy to support the Biden-Harris ticket.  Let's just do it because it's so much better than the ugly alternative.
If you have issues with Biden &amp;/or Harris, please vote to save our country
You are an amazing and talented person and public servant, one deserving to be in the mix of possible VP picks, deserving, too, of being selected. I don‚Äôt envy VP Biden‚Äôs having to make that decision. I can‚Äôt wait for your next chapter.
Yeah because wanting healthcare for all, corporate accountability and a truly clean environment is self-centered. Just admit that Biden isn't going to do what's in the best interests of this country.
Do..  People realize that anything Biden/Harris will do will not be as bad as another four years of Trump/Pence?  It, actually, may be better!  Weird thought, I know.
And recall, from Obama and Biden in Aug 08: "We send our congratulations to Governor Sarah Palin and her family on her designation as the republican nominee for vice president. It is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics." Nothing from DJT.

Certainly there's enough super PAC money left for this campaign? Are the billionaires going to pay their fair share? Well, not in NY of course, but to help their defender Joe Biden surely they will.
One of the biggest and best things Biden can do as president is simply apppoint qualified people of integrity who are committed to the mission of their departments. Trump appointed people intent on dismantling their departments to enrich themselves and their donors.
You forgot that Democrats want to burn down the country, you will be  unsafe if Biden wins, and democrats are trying to cancel American history. Fox News literally repeats these points every 5 minutes.
What? Obviously, you only went 1 later deep: it was Yangs fault that it was Bernies fault that Biden/Harris lost.
It's made specifically for blue checks to avoid having to deal with criticism. Notice they rolled it out the day Biden announced Copmala as his VP choice
If Trump stays in, we can't touch him for AT LEAST four years. If we put Biden in, Trump can face civil justice, &amp; Biden goes under the lens for everything he does, we spend 4-8 years rolling back Trump's agenda while the current batch of Progressives prepare for 2024/28.
Biden is bad news on a whole list of fronts. But a few things make him "touchable". The big one is that he doesn't have the GOP protecting him. When he breaks laws, he'll have the Centrists on his side, and the Right and Left both hounding him. He is impeachable. Trump is not.
Even if you feel this way, consider, who is more vulnerable to civil oversight while in office? It's not Trump. The GOP/Right will destroy everything to protect his evil, but if/when Biden messes up, we can reach out and "Whoah there Joe... You wanna get impeached maybe?"
Abolish the electoral college so every vote is equal and then we can have a real conversation, but until that moment my vote in the deeply blue state of New York doesn't matter. I will not be voting for the guy who killed my girlfriend. An actual bag of shit? Yes. Joe Biden? No.
I'm Palestinian, I have issues with almost every US politician dehumanizing the shit out of my people (Biden and Harris included). But all of these takes that ignore Harris' consistently progressive record as AG to call her a cop as a "gotcha" are just trolly.
Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and their fellow Democrats¬†are fighting hard for vote-by-mail, but they can't do it alone. With the most important election of our lifetimes less than 100 days away, we need to show that vote-by-mail has the overwhelming support of the American people.
Be Carefull Minnesota this is What She Brings! Biden embraces them, Quotes the Quran Does that surprise anyone! Muslim Emoms call for Mosques üïå to be used as command posts. Govrnment hiding behind religious freedom! Wait.....
I've heard many, many people who say they're down with Trump and will vote for Biden ‚Äî or anything that has a heart beat.
I think she just got a few good zingers in on Biden in the debates
So you are not really for Biden and Harris you are against Trump but do not fool yourself that either of them has changed in anyway Sleepy Joe is corrupt and Kamala is plain nasty
How Biden chose Harris: Inside his search for a running mate

There are only a few states where Lefties can afford to not vote for Biden like CA, NY and a few New England states.  Everyone else has got to stampede the polls for Biden b/c anything less than a solid win will enable Trump to declare the results invalid.
Trump may try to outflank Biden on marijuana legalization by attacking Harris‚Äô record of prosecuting marijuana possession and Biden‚Äôs opposition of legalization. Hopefully Biden realizes this and the obvious political upside of being on the right side of a 60/40 issue.

I think you're right but maybe one thing that bugs people is the possibility that she might be perceived as actually progressive on criminal justice. No one is fooled when Biden or Klobuchar pretends to be progressive but it feels like Harris might pull it off.
The 'Trump is the worst ever' argument still doesn't save you from making a racist remark and calling someone you don't know Uncle Tom. Sorry to break it to you, but Biden is the (arguable) palatable version of Trump. He's not as blatantly racist, but still so. You've been had.

Discussion tonight- anyone that is against Biden/Harris ticket would ever be pleased. Far left would only be happy if it was Bernie &amp; someone more to the left. Center right - if you are against this ticket you‚Äôre just looking to vote Trump anyhow.
Didn't she also believe Biden's accuser?
Spot the difference. Anyways chile vote for Biden.
you and your little dog Pence say "We won't be safe in Biden's America?" You've killed 163,000 with your bungling, our streets are on fire, and there is no end in sight under your lack of leadership and you want us to fear Biden? You need a new cognitive test.
Look I don't like Harris, and Im not a huge fan of Biden. But right now I would elect a Republican who is capable of leading over Trump. If we can get the house to be more progressive, then the Senate. We can move on to the president. Right now we need leadership in any form.
Just a great choice for American culture - Biden / Harris - have the same values of a majority of Americans. A powerful ticket and hopes to bring other Democrats into office. Time to turn the white nationalists aside.
As they say - picking your running mate is the first major decision a person running for president. And Biden picked a great running mate. Charadmatic - tough - will be able to stand against the ‚Äú bully‚Äù.
Wow big selection move by Biden üëå this election year goin be history and huge I see
It's just Biden-Harris. Sen. Harris is not married to anyone named Cobb.   But if you are linking  to Biden and Harris, you are doing her a favor, Americans hate Putin-Trump.
A good move for Biden IMO would be to announce some cabinet picks before the election. Just saying hey remember this person you supported yeah they gonna run the monies now ok bye
It's been about five hours since Kamala Harris was announced as Biden's VP pick and the white supremacists are already out in full force questioning her African descent as a person of Jamaican heritage. They're as predictable and transparent and as they are ignorant and pathetic.
WOWWWWWW what a fucking pathetic loser.
That‚Äôs why he picked her. She‚Äôs real tough on crime. Biden/Kamala are going to be the Reagan/bush of the 2020s
Right now our country is sooooo far 2 the right that swinging the pendulum waaaay over 2 the left isnt the answer. Biden/Harris will bring things back 2 middle ground &amp; then go from there. Middle ground is what we need right now. Theres 2 much damage 2 repair b4 moving forward.
Also if she‚Äôs such a tool of the radical left, why was there so much distance between her and Sanders/Warren on the debate stage?   They‚Äôre trying the socialist boogeyman attack AGAIN (first Biden, now Harris) in a race where both are actually pretty moderate.
Kamala deserves benefit of the doubt on her DA/AG record given the hurdles to get where she did. Also overpolicing -traffic ticket revenue model, racist drug war/mass jailing, unconsented surveillance state- legit top issue. Reconciling revolves around Biden. That‚Äôs troubling
I support a revolution not a political party. Bernie may not have won his Battle but we are winning the war for Congress &amp; the Senate so far, by voting for grass roots Progressives which I do! Not by participating in a glorified  opinion poll between TRUMP &amp; BIDEN. What a joke!!

I‚Äôm simply playing the hand I was dealt.  Donald Trump has done nothing but hurt ME his entire time in office.  He fucked me on my taxes after his tax plan took effect, his inaction with this pandemic nearly ruined my business before it got off the ground.  Biden isn‚Äôt my #1 but
Biden can accomplish more than you if he rode a tricycle.
FYI: The key facts in this thread are all confirmed in the great new book by Biden‚Äôs former stenographer, Mike McCormick ‚ÄúJoe Biden Unauthorized‚Äù:
Just a friendly reminder joe attempted to defund SS 4 times while in office. What Trump said and what Biden actually did is a big difference. So there is that. But , as you said a big demographic 18-24 as you are on record of saying it stupid. They may not realize it.
I believe I have seen her endorsing candidates. Is that ok?  I‚Äôm sure if the PBA endorsed Biden she would have applauded them. She has only one vision, her own. No deviation.  Democracy only on her terms.
Tweets seen today: I don't care if Trump got caught in a Motel 6 with hookers and blow...  I don't care if the ticket is Biden/Hitler. ..  But sure, remind me again how voting a third party is wasting my vote.
Is there anything that give you concern about using the USPS?   Honestly I am torn on #MailInVoting. I have grave concerns about the union backing Biden and saying (rightfully) it's survival is at stake. Not sure we have the infrastructure. 1 of 2
Trump. You are in big trouble. Biden's strategy  is working. You want to control the process, but you can not. So, as Mary Trump explained in her book, you will stoop as low as you need to, in order to stop anyone and anything. She said that you have no ability to show empathy.
The fact that hysterical Trump-hater Colbert used this very justifiable line of questioning on Kamala Harris last night is a major, major deal. The Dems need to get a clear explanation out of her over her attacks on Biden or this only gets worse
5/ ... These are all things Biden can‚Äôt do or wouldn‚Äôt even think to talk about while he plays ‚Äúsmall ball‚Äù scolding is about masks. If Biden wants to make himself more persuasive, he could finally speak out against ANTIFA violence &amp; all the rioting... but he won‚Äôt...

On November 3,2020 remember Obama administration spied on President Trump. Democrats and fake news media lied about Russiangate. Biden will never debate President Trump. Kamala lied about Kavanaugh. Kamala is not black. Pedophiles were protected by democrats and fake news media.

Trump, have you forgotten? When you ignorantly call Joe Biden condescending names, don't forget about the fitting names given for you. Joe has too much class, so I will stand in for him. Dumb Trump Donald Duck Frompy Trump. Pick one.
So you are saying as Vice President of the United States there was no action Biden and Obama could‚Äôve taken for 8 years as the post office lost billions? The highest offices in our government were helpless even with a democrat legislative majority? Please stop.
When was BIDEN VP again? How does this change what I said. They still lost close to 100 billion in his 8 years. Even if you take off the pension cost from last year the post office lost 3.8 billion. Supply link for your claim please.
Already they are trying to deny, deny ! Schiff &amp; Biden wouldn't even be talking about the investigation if there was nothing there ! I guess they "as usual" must try to take the focus off themselves &amp; put on Trump ! Biden did some bad things &amp; he will never be POTUS !
I just realized I can mute certain words on Twitter and my life immediately improved.  Muted words: Biden Kamala Trump Democrat Republican  üòéüòéüòé
Only now the dems are interested. 8 years Biden was VP they lost close too 100 billion. I am ok with mail in ballots. What is not ok is that there is no structure or system out in place for the number of ballots they will get. The USPS is NOT part of our democracy.

It would be accurate if Biden had shown even remote interest in what the left actually wants. If instead ignoring the majority of AMERICANS let alone Dems he supported M4A. He has come out agains the very foundations the true left stands for.
Stunning how for the 8 years when BIDEN was VP the post office lost close to 100 billion and not one democrat himself included cared. Now they claim it is needed for our democracy? Since when? Wasn‚Äôt created for that and can‚Äôt be broken up at any time.
So is it about medicine or Democracy? Did the usps get more important for some reason this year then the 8 it lost close to 100 billion when BIDEN was VP?
It wouldn‚Äôt be cancelled if   Biden was already in charge .  Soon though this dangerous Conservative experiment will be over #BidenHarris2020
What great "leader" do you know that has to force his or her flowers to do something? A mandate isn't leadership.   Everyone should wear masks. A leader would convince them to wear masks. Neither #biden nor #trump is a leader in that sense

Biden is uninspiring.  His campaign is built on fear and not hope.  His saving grace is that his administration is not trying to undermine the social safety nets and basic systems that keep the country functional
If you want to tear the country down, Trump is your guy.  Just know that you might not be where you want to be on the other side of it.  If you think the country is salvageable, Biden‚Äôs your guy.  But he is in no way a revolutionary.
Biden could easily be framed as a Republican based on his record.  But Trump is not even a Republican.  Trump‚Äôs whole playbook is deregulation with a head start for his circle so they can cash in.

Still think Dems have tricks up their sleeves. Biden off the ticket for medical reasons, mail-in voting fraud, worse case scenario involving attempts on life and limb God forbid, the Dems are desperate.  But i think POTUS knows all of this and yes, it should be a landslide.
I think you have to connect with what they care about first. That‚Äôs subjective and personal. I find pointing out that Biden is a creeper who smells little girls and says the craziest crap is something many agree with.
And, what have You done for the US: Implated hatred, divided us,  lied about the virus resulting in 165,000+ dead Americans!  Stop praising others &amp; FOCUS your last 80+ days left! Beacuse Biden/Is next to fix the damage you have CAUSED OUR Naation and the Wolrd!
I wonder if #biden chose #KamalaHarris  because she smelled the best when he sniffed her. Although Harris may be too old for his tastes
Was this the mantra during the 8 years Obama - Biden were in office as they lost close to 100 billion? Or is it the mantra now that you want something from them?
Of course it was. Anything positive you can relate to the Obama Biden admin anything gnegatuve trump just didn‚Äôt listen.

Biden &amp; running mate Kamala Harris made their debut together yesterday as the presumptive Dem ticket in this year‚Äôs presidential election.  Meanwhile, Trump attacked Harris as ‚Äúnasty,‚Äù a term he commonly uses against women. #HofstraExperts can discuss:
Joe Biden just declared Comma ala Harris black so is ok now
We're did Biden serve.  ü§î
I will be nervous election day.  I say to myself. No one I know turned on Trump. I don't no a soul who likes Biden. I know people who hate Trump still love Obama but nobody i know say the like Biden
Kamala and Biden? Finna represent me?! Fuck it I might need some of Kanye‚Äôs 2020 vision
With you Judge Pirro either Florida or New York.  Vote Trump he‚Äôs no Chump .  We don‚Äôt need hidden Biden.
Yeah but other things in the world matter besides just Donald bad. Meidas, Lincoln Project, etc do not care &amp; focus only on Donald bad as shown in this tweet. Unfortunately and begrudgingly I‚Äôll be voting for Biden. Nothing to do with the stupid nonstop ads Meidas or Lincoln make
I‚Äôm worried that Trumpsters are now intentionally undermining these polls, so as to give the impression that turnout for Biden supporters is not as critical as it is. Eye on the prize!
Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris are going to give us all the hope we desperately need right now, Lea Thompson.
They‚Äôll do anything to discredit Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris from winning in the election, Lea Thompson. Thankfully, we‚Äôre not falling for it.
Problem is Biden‚Äôs gonna be under indictment by then so......
Biden is not running for President , Watch the Dem's pull a last minute Switch to Hillary and Big Mike LMFAO Hard up , washed up and Going Down.The Demoncrat party will be abolished 4ever.

I am so proud of your Kamala. You will be an amazing VP. Let's make this country not just great again as POTUS says but make this Country better. #Biden/Harris 2020
Yesterday was a day for democrat lies. Schumer said Pres Trump would defund Social Security, kamala said Biden and Obama had best economy and Trump destroyed it and Biden said President Trump praised the white supremists groups all lies. Vote Republican MAGA TRUMP 2020
It blows his mind because he cannot fathom taking criticism and growing from it. Biden embraced Harris because she challenged him and he said he needed to be challenged on race.  Trump would have blacklisted anyone for much less.
Is This the Face You Made When You Heard the Kamala News?

In Trump hysterical Obama was the pattern Of corruption he Comey Brennan Clapper Yates Struk Paige are the ones who are corrupt oh did I forget creepy Joe Biden who was the disgusting person of corruption
The #CharlottesvilleHoax is like every historical slander against my people. This is ‚ÄúProtocols of the Elders of Zion‚Äù/‚ÄúChrist-killer‚Äù level slander. This isn‚Äôt something we should even let kids play around with, but now we‚Äôre letting Biden make it the cornerstone of his campaign
Biden/Harris.. you know it
I just dont know. The fact she degraded Biden only a few months ago &amp; now praises him &amp; his accomplishments is very telling. I want change however, common sense says there is something very wrong with this picture. I love u today even though yesterday u were the anti christ? ü§î

And your response to that is to fret of the leftist take over here? So a Biden/Harris ticket has got you considering Trump, a man who denies the science on COVID-19 and who has empowered both white nationalists and evangelical fundamentalists? Like take a breath, bro. 2/2
What the hell are you going on about? The left got rebuked this past election, with Bernie accepting defeat and now no Warren vice presidency. You got Joe Biden, a longtime Democratic elite, and Kamala Harris, a former DA who got rejected by leftists as being too much a cop. 1/2
I said ‚Äúpart of‚Äù because it is. Biden is complicit in both
Surely Biden didn‚Äôt vote for it. And if he did, surely the administration he was a part of ended those wars
Fast forward to 2022 everything has continued to get worse and the only one left to blame is Joe Biden
Biden‚Äôs FP is part of why the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are old enough to enlist to fight in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars

Ok cool. Joe Biden and mainstream Democrats are also right of the fucking Tories
Are you excited about Biden‚ÄìHarris?
Joe Biden is a centrist
Women‚Äôs rights or race issues. What exactly about Biden makes you think anything but status quo is gonna happen
Poor campaigning and centrists consolidating around Biden
Let‚Äôs be abundantly clear. The list of positives of president Biden begins and ends with not Trump
This being Biden
It‚Äôd be great if Biden was. But with his record, diet republican is likely the best case scenario
do you think Biden will ever post another tweet that doesn‚Äôt mention Kamala and how incredible she is? It‚Äôs already so stale
Judge please start hammering Mr.Biden‚Äôs stamina !!!!!
Saying both sides are evil and having concerns with each isn‚Äôt promoting a third party. I will vote blue to vote fascism out, I just won‚Äôt be happy at all about it. Doesn‚Äôt mean there aren‚Äôt legit criticisms to be made for Biden/Harris and all neoliberals.
Biden is a racist but thats ok they will let him slide ! He' &amp; Kamela are a joke !

Anyone that willingly says they are for Biden is obviously insane.
She &amp; Joe Biden are going to DESTROY Adolf Trump &amp; Mike Pence, Scott Dworkin! I can already see Biden &amp; Harris in the White House now!
Trump is probably hiding in his bunker to get away from Kamala Harris on account that he fears her greatly, Scott Dworkin! She &amp; Biden are going to nail Trump &amp; Pence to the wall when the debates arrive!
Tears are running down my eyes as I listen to Biden speak. It gives me hope to hear a man of integrity, speaking of the atrocities of the Trump presidency and how he and Kamala will restore the nation's soul. A joy to see a light glimmer  after years of darkness.

This is how bankrupt the #democrats are. "We don't think #bidem will finish a term but we didn't want to vote for his VP during the primaries."
Trump is so meanspirited. Mary Trump chronicled in her book that Trump lies at-will. She says that Donald feels entitled to lie with no conscience of who is  insulted. People who have good sense have to know that Trump is mentally ill to say that Biden is " against God"
Sure that‚Äôs possible, but I am not convinced Biden has.

I was, and am, a big Sanders/Warren supporter. Biden &amp; Harris aren't my dream ticket. It doesn't matter. Trump is a Fascist narcissistic ignoramus who has already run roughshod over our democratic republic. We do not have the luxury of sitting this one out. I mean, really!.....

Sure I get your point of people‚Äôs beliefs evolving and shifting. Problem is those laws along with others created the criminal justice system we have today. Likewise, Biden‚Äôs remarks are still racially charged, so it‚Äôs hard to see that he has evolved in his belief system today.
I believe you mean Biden is racist, Trump never said anything remotely close to what Biden has said...
It's amazing to me how much "steam" this narrative is getting. Not to mention how transparent what's going on here is. My guess is anyone backing Kanye wasn't voting Biden no matter what.
PLEASE don‚Äôt vote 4 Biden n Harris
What racist mantra? You realize the Biden actual words right! You realize his running mate called him a racist. But yes it‚Äôs my mantra. Ignore his history. Please tell me what your racist Trump did to the  black community?
Powerful, disturbing piece by Mr Kellyanne Conway:  I believe Joe Biden is sleepy &amp; weak. I believe Biden could hurt God &amp; the Bible.

I see very little value in Biden or Harris agreeing to debate. Trump and Pence will use debates as free airtime to spew their usual lies, and baseless attacks and distractions. Think how furious Trump would be to be deprived of a big stage to lie and distract.
Warning: the corrupt Attorney General Bill Barr likely plans to get false charges filed against Biden, Obama, or other Democrats before the election. This will be a garbage political stunt to aid Trump‚Äôs election prospects. #ImpeachBarr

Biden shouldn‚Äôt debate Trump. Trump will just lie and try to distract and smear. Biden should demand Trump release all his tax returns and financial documents as a condition of a debate. Then there would be NO debate.
Would you be okay with Democrats lying, cheating and stealing an election?  Would you enjoy a Democrat President bullying anyone who disagrees with him/her?  Luckily, you don't have to worry about that happening. Biden-Harris want to unify the Country not sow hate.

One of the biggest and best things Biden can do as president is simply apppoint qualified people of integrity who are committed to the mission of their departments. Trump appointed people intent on dismantling their departments to enrich themselves and their donors.

Just a great choice for American culture - Biden / Harris - have the same values of a majority of Americans. A powerful ticket and hopes to bring other Democrats into office. Time to turn the white nationalists aside.
As they say - picking your running mate is the first major decision a person running for president. And Biden picked a great running mate. Charadmatic - tough - will be able to stand against the ‚Äú bully‚Äù.
It's just Biden-Harris. Sen. Harris is not married to anyone named Cobb.   But if you are linking  to Biden and Harris, you are doing her a favor, Americans hate Putin-Trump.
Right now our country is sooooo far 2 the right that swinging the pendulum waaaay over 2 the left isnt the answer. Biden/Harris will bring things back 2 middle ground &amp; then go from there. Middle ground is what we need right now. Theres 2 much damage 2 repair b4 moving forward.
I support a revolution not a political party. Bernie may not have won his Battle but we are winning the war for Congress &amp; the Senate so far, by voting for grass roots Progressives which I do! Not by participating in a glorified  opinion poll between TRUMP &amp; BIDEN. What a joke!!
Could you please remind me of that time when #Biden got excommunicated?
Congratulations! Can‚Äôt wait to see the outcome of your leadership together with Biden!

Yeah right.  Joe would NOT have banned China from coming in to the USA. Millions dead under Joe Biden!
Well, in all honesty, many on the right were apoplectic whenever Obama made verbal gaffes, so, it‚Äôs gonna happen.  They do it with Biden all the time, but Biden is far more deserving of derision for SOME of his gaffes because they are MAJOR mistakes.
Hey did you even know the Federal usda gave out even More food stamp benefits since March 2020.   Go research it.    Starving? Come on man as joe Biden would say!

Obama knew, Clinton knew, Biden knew.
Great!! Bernie is the leader of a political revelution not a corrupt party like Biden, Trump, Clinton or Pelosi. In ten years these young progressives will take the parties over. Now it's just a waiting game and father time will do what voters have not been able too. TIC TOC!!

Oh if he's in danger, I don't want to see him get hurt... so I'll vote for Biden.
Guess what America? New York is open and nobody is going to restaurants,  or any other place where it is crowded! What do think the effects of that over the next 3 years is? By the time Biden takes over his main job will be to shorting food line times!
The fact that the sturgis rally was allowed means there is no hope that federal leadership can contain the virus! The United states is in for a long protracted period of death and economic catastrophe! By the time Biden assumes office it will be horrific!
If I had my way, Stacey Abrams would be VP choice and Kamila Harris would be AG.  But I will fully support whoever Joe Biden chooses.
Don't recall Obama having deal w/this crap. At time ran for Presidency lacked years of foreign relations&amp;experience,so he chose Biden for his skills.Should choose whom he's able to work well w/&amp; govern with. When trying to make color of skin a demand makes those seem racist.
Joe Biden could nominate a moldy ham sandwich, and it would be a significant improvement over anyone in the current administration.
Down an incredibly steep ramp, and then he will run. If we can get Joe Biden to hang out with Tony Hawk, it might make for some interesting Trump footage later.
The Fact China ‚ÄúPrefers‚Äù Biden and Pelosi Prefers China tells You ALL You need to know . This is Exposing Them. ALL OF THEM. Think about what they are indorseing. They are making it Easy.....

Like Biden‚Äôs head, this is empty. Just boilerplate nonsense. The undeniable fact is the economy under  was the best anyone alive had ever seen.  At this point  is lucky if can operate a light switch.
It amazes me how real the outside world looks(seeing that Trump constantly implies Biden is in his basement all the time). I'd love to see Trump get some real exercise &amp; attempt to even balance himself on a bicycle... That be a real treat, almost another Trumpgait.
Ya see if the Blacks don't vote for Biden then the idea is Trump will win. . . .
Just imagine if, in September, the DNC announces that Biden can‚Äôt continue and uses their power to appoint someone else. It‚Äôs not hard to picture. I think it‚Äôs why this VEEP choice is so drawn out.
Not even then, the few days before second Super Tuesday when Sanders` campaign was urging people to stay home to help quell the spread of the pandemic and the DNC and Biden's campaign were all "no, no, vote, LOL what a bunch of panicmongers". Literally kill us rather than lose.I do expect a Biden/Harris adminstration to actually look to get work done. Joe has always been a compromiser in legislation historically (some were bad compromises), but I think he could make it work.
Exactly like I said they have secret cult meetings we can't all be apart of and that's rule number one no matter what never admit anything Trump does wrong üòÇü§£ is Biden a great candidate no but anyone better than him

Biden's a scumbag. 50 yrs in politics &amp; has done more harm than anything. Do your own research &amp; by the way Karris said she believed all the women who accused Biden of sexual misconduct &amp; rape
No comment about Trump letting his teenage  daughter sit on his lap ü§îfor once wanna see a Trump supporter admit fault with him and don't deflect saying what other people did I could say Biden has done  inappropriate looking  things but y'all are incapable when it comes to trump

Joe Biden is a corrupt politician who cares more about the pharmaceutical &amp; health insurance industries than he does about the health of the most vulnerable Americans because he doesn't support Medicare for all during the middle of the COVID-19 Coronavirus pandemic.
Saw someone wearing a "Biden 2020" mask today... They do exist.
He's a little boy dressed up in a man's suit. He's assuming they keep the house. After what people have witnessed from far left- spying, phony investigations, a phony impeachment to cover up Biden's corruption in Ukraine. they may lose NY, California &amp; other states.
I choose to be apolitical on this blog other than really being against social justice warrior culture. But to be clear I‚Äôm left leaning and was a Bernie guy but have no love for the dems or repubs. I‚Äôm not sure if I can support Biden. Sure as help don‚Äôt 4 Trump.
Maybe he didn't know, what idiot asked him that "gotcha question" ? Ask Biden if he really raped Tara Reade? That's if he ever takes questions, can remember with his dementia or  yells at you. Come on man?
That's because they were involved. Remember DNC &amp; Hillary paid for what led to spying on her political opponent. Obama, Biden, Comey, Brennan, Rice, Clapper, Intel, FBI CIA were involved.
Shahid wasn't accused of rape, and you're literally saying what you're projecting at me. That only Bidens was a smear because you like Biden and hate Shahid. Is it fun looking as braindead as you do? Because you're good at that, at least.

BIDEN would listen to briefings,absorb the material,respect science. Seriously,Trump needs pictures drawn,needs it condensed to 2 -3 pages. Biden would not be calling Hannity, Dobbs for bedtime chats, would not look for praise from Fox daily..ü§îüòé
In the 2020 general election for President I am voting for the Libertarian candidate. If I was in a swing state, I would vote for Joe Biden. I prefer Joe Biden over Trump just so we have my bias out in the open.
For instance if this Joe Biden versus Mitt Romney or John Kasich we could have this discussion regarding corruption and the White House. That‚Äôs just how I view it. Trump has changed the game about how we normally discuss things and look at elections.
M4A, Biden is off in a far away land, this place has not reached the level of communication needed to hear about such a plan. So...no, he said no.
My prediction (save this tweet) is that Biden/Harris win, House stays D, Senate stays R, but majority shrinks slightly.
The Republicans were in charge of both the house and the senate up until 2018 and now you decide it‚Äôs time to investigate Biden. Funny coincidence isn‚Äôt?
Wouldn‚Äôt it be great if the moderator in the debate grew a pair and asked Biden if he was in the room when unmasking was discussed   If he tells the truth he‚Äôs screwed, if he lies he‚Äôs screwed. Drop the mic
So if Biden accepts nomination and then quits is Harris the nominee. Can she even be president
Like how you people harass the woman Joe Biden raped?
Anyone else find it oddly hypocritical that some of those on the ‚Äúreligious right‚Äù were able to (through the grace of God) forgive Trump for the grab em by the p*,paying off of porn stars,cheating on wives yet are now clutching their pearls that Biden ‚Äúsniffed a child‚Äôs hair‚Äù? ü§î
The one good thing that came out of the incompetent Obama/Biden regime was the it gave trump a vivid blueprint of what he had to fix. He has fixed most of it and if given 4 more years the restoration of America‚Äôs greatness will be complete. Biden would be a backslide
My city isn‚Äôt burning, Konservative Karen. You see all those awful scenes of lawlessness in the trump ads saying you won‚Äôt be safe in joe Biden‚Äôs America? They were filmed in Donald Trumps America.
I don‚Äôt think evil leaders throughout history took many questions from their media. If Biden can‚Äôt tell us what he stands for, he better sit his ass down and start collecting his government pension.  Isn‚Äôt a democracy where we can listen to both sides and then go pull the lever?
I think Kamala over estimates people‚Äôs anger over Biden‚Äôs choosing her because of her gender and her race. She‚Äôs not the first and she won‚Äôt be the last. Yet, she still pushes that agenda.
Pushing voters left means nothing. Voters aren't in power and very clearly bend extremely easily considering you're all voting for a conservative like Biden. That whole point is absolute nonsense.
Read, watch, listen. This is what your asking for with a vote for Biden/Harris. None of our rights are safe. So why are journalists so comfortable with communism? They must be, they don‚Äôt ask any real questions of ether of them! Not allowed to, that‚Äôs why!
Voters moving left means absolutely nothing when they'll vote for blatant conservatives like Biden anyway.

If Biden doesn't win in November, there will be no more elections in America.  Trump is using the Putin playbook to achieve a dictatorship.  He has already circumvented the US Constitution a 1,000 times!  This will be America if TRUMP wins:  Oh wait, it already is!
You mean like how Biden wants unarmed protesters murdered by cops, people with political ideologies he doesn't like put in prison, and his VP wants all trans people dead? Fuck off lib. The only people who play this like a game are you people, disregarding all lives but your own.
Here is a responsible critical take that I have been sending to friends.
Who will Kamala pick as her Vice President after they have Creepy Joe committed?
I don't know if it's drugs or what, but Biden has deteriorated badly in the last few years.
I was just listening to Shapiro.  He was reading a statement from Biden claiming credit for the peace deal that Kushner just finished brokering between Israel and the UAE.   I wonder if Creepy Joe is so far gone mentally that he actually believes that.
Sadly, Biden is probably a little disappointed they didn‚Äôt endorse him
If Biden accepts nomination and then becomes incapacitated would Harris be candidate. If not who would be the candidate. Don‚Äôt tell me pelosi

#2of#2 they could even think about winning anything.  What's Biden doing beside hiding in his hole.  When he's out he won't answer questions or he says the same thing over and over. What a waste of time he is. His choice of VP is going to save him? How will he cure the virus??
There are multiple low life people in this country.  Who could blame President Trump for the corona virus. Are we talking about the Democrats?  Who else?Tthey are doing everything to make him look bad because of the vote for Biden which is the only way  #1 0f #2

The priority right now has to be a fair election. If that means using FedEx or UPS or private citizens to get ballots in then that is what we have to do. Biden can fund and save the USPS once he's elected.
Biden is an angry man. He &amp; Harris read from a script, she's going to be easy to take apart. Biden well, what the socialist marxists are doing is close to elder abuse. They made deals after Bloomberg did damage for all to drop out, let Biden take control &amp; Sanders fell for it.
Most of all, she's bringing positive energy backed up by BRAINS and DETERMINATION!  She will be an amazing VP and the number one adviser to President Biden.

Biden/Harris are not technically moderate, they are just establishment modern day democrats and going up against Bernie Sanders and the left wing progressives will make you seem moderate.
Let's talk about the Biden Harris campaign and what it means for us....  via
Just adding that Biden is a  alumni.
Biden does support social security expansion, so they are in lock step on this as well.
The only 2 things her sponsored/co-sponsored bills show is she might be a little left of Biden on the environment and expansion of social security. Other than that he Senate record would suggest they had similar goals to what Biden had discussed in the primary.
The proper way to frame this is ‚ÄúJoe Biden calls for every governor to issue statewide mask mandate.‚Äù It‚Äôs technically not a national mandate. A national mandate would be the federal government mandating something.
‚ÄúEvery single American should be wearing a mask when they‚Äôre outside for the next three months, at a minimum. Every governor should mandate ‚Äî every governor should mandate mandatory mask wearing,‚Äù Biden said.
It‚Äôs amazing how everyone including news media has seemed to misconstrue Biden‚Äôs mask comments. He used the word ‚Äúshould‚Äù and said governors should institute a mask mandate in their states. He did not say I‚Äôd institute a national mask mandate. He‚Äôs going to need to clarify this.
Joe Biden refused to comment when asked in undoing that policy btw. And now since then has picked a highly transphobic VP. They both want us to die. Biden and Trump. Welcome to America.
Do we really want Biden and Clinton and Harris in the White House this is it people do or die time.
Kamala is part Indian and I guess they think the Biden/Harris ticket is in favor of forcing people to be vegetarian?  Racist thinking strikes again
Yeah no one would have died if we had Biden in the White House!
OMG.. LMAO..The orld has been laughing at America since you took office..how about you debate VP Harris as well as President Biden..we need a really good laugh!! Don't bther to call VP Harris names..shes a helluva smarter than you!!
The thing that stands out for me about this ticket is these 2 candidates exuded more warmth &amp; humanity on Day 1 of campaigning together than Trump &amp; Pence have exhibited in their entire careers. These are qualities we have sorely missed since Obama-Biden. #BuildBackBetter
So if Biden wins and subsequently becomes incapacitated Harris would not be eligible to be president. That means that depending on who wins the house the president would be pelosi or McCarthy.  Omg
Harris has a net-positive favorability rating. Not sure what that means, but I know it‚Äôs good news! #BidenHarris2020
Was waiting for him to say, "Just try to beat my meat, Kamala &amp; Biden. Just try."
Yes Sandra I sure can but seeing how you subscribe to the mind numbing ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs done nothing in over 40 years‚Äù blind followers club, it‚Äôs a waste of time and effort. Feel free to do a google search though. Stay away from Fox and Breitbart. They‚Äôre leading to your mental decline.
Question... if groups are trying to defund the police and Biden calls for a mandatory mask wearing who‚Äôs going to enforce the violators?  Will the mask violators get an appearance ticket and be  let go like the burglars, looters and assaulters?
She‚Äôs a hypocrite just like Biden and the rest of the Washington politicians.
The Biden Trump matchup isn't even that close. Trump most definitely outranges Biden's shitty aerials. The only good thing Biden has is his dumb ass up B that's only good out of shield. FAKE NEWS

There is too much time left,a d he can do so much more damage. Biden is going to spend a lot of time undoing trump's messes.
Governors have the legal ability to do so depending on the powers granted to them by their legislative bodies and in their respective constitution. The constitution does not inhibit states from doing so. Biden issuing a mandate would be a different, but that‚Äôs not what he said.
I am pretty sure Biden was for this for a long time but he knew announcing it would further Trumps anti mask reactions.  Still Someone needs to lead now.  And its Joe Biden.
She said - "This was not a search for the truth. Instead, this was about politics &amp; raw power to push through an unfit nominee." So she was angry allegations against Kavanaugh not investigated further because "about politics", but zero interest in similar against Biden? Politics!
Best possible solution that I see given our current situation? Vote Biden then fill the house with actual leftists and progressives.start thinking long term, we messed that up in 2016.

Ah yes, the elusive white moderate vote.  Kind of crazy to me that they think there are any Trump voters left who would consider switching over to Biden at this point because Bloomberg/Kasich endorsed him. If they could be convinced, they're already convinced.
Maybe I don't get this, but I see Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, AOC, and recently Andrew Yang has been added. All are big progressive voices.  I don't think anyone believes that a Biden presidency will be a terribly progressive one, but there are certainly progressives there.

Well, it's possible he wins, but the chances are equally good Biden destroys him en route to 400+ EVs. He hasn't made any headway with the demographics he lost in 2018. Just more of the same from 2016, where he just BARELY WON an EC victory but still lost the popular vote by 2M.
I think you have what it takes to be our president some day! Biden-Harris 2020!!!
Joe Biden is the liar that's why his past election runs for President -he withdrew Just because he has a "D" after his name doesn't make him a good man. Watch-You may see some familiar faces. He lied and called himself dumb
and Van Jones agrees. You are a white man playing racial politics when it doesn't affect you at all. It's a word we hear from liberals every election. Biden has done nothing in 50 yrs of politics to help Black Community
Nothing racist. But Biden has....multiple times and he did work with KKK member ex Democrat Sen Byrd to stop busing &amp; wrote 1994 Crimes Bill that incarcerated Black Community in masses. President Trump First step Act, 2nd Chances, Funded Black colleges, Opportunity Zones-read up!

They wouldn't have to do anything to Sanders, since the youth vote made it abundantly clear, AGAIN, that they will not show up to vote for their livelihood. We get Biden because middle-age and older are the ones that actually participate.
These idiots think American people are stupid. In one sentence she says it's the President's fault for not handling economy (which HE built not Obama) than admits it's a pandemic. Is she suggesting the President keep the economy open so people die? Biden wanted to. Doubletalk
Ah yes, the Biden strategy. "You ain't black" if you don't agree with me.
YES!!! If Biden's policies would have adverse effects on Americans, then they should be asked about it. Otherwise, what's the point of even asking?
I tried explaining that Trump inherited a good economy from Obama/Biden to a Republican relative and he refused to believe it. He believed the economy was bad and suddenly became good in 2016.  Newsflash: Economic policy generally takes 1-2 YEARS to affect the economy measurably.
I think Biden and Harris looked and spoke strong. But I got too admit I would love to see Kamala Harris debate Trump cause I think she would rip him a new ass hole on the debate stage.
Republicans simultaneously give Trump credit for the economy he inherited from Obama/Biden while absolving him of all responsibility for the cratering due to his utter failure of a COVID response.
I hope that it teaches little girls to educate themselves and learn a skill that employers need. And not to rely on affirmative action like Harris had to rely on. The DNC made it publicly clear that Biden was to pick a "black female". No other qualifications were necessary.
yep. people bickering over whether Biden is "progressive enough" while Trump is dismantling democracy.  We can quibble about whether we need a public option or M4A AFTER the existential threat has been dealt with
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris just delivered two slam dunk speeches!!!  I am so inspired, so motivated, so in love with the dream of saving America from the evil of Trumpism.  Both Joe &amp; Kamala spoke to America in ways we haven't heard in YEARS!  Positive energy!  Human compassion!
I am excited to see and hear from next the President of the United States of America Joe Biden and our next Vice President Kamala Harris. They have given hope for are country to take us back to being the leader of the world again.  Please VOTE
Nobody will answer my question. If Biden accepts the nomination and drops out before the election, will Harris be the candidate
LOL just saw you lie to americans while Biden was playing Black music, pathetic. Anything to pander to Black Americans. Americans witnessed you did &amp; what Democrats are doing forcing hurt, riots, w/holding $$$, deliberate closedowns of states, nursing home deaths due to liberals
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris introduce their presidential ticket in Delaware
This should be the Biden/Harri campaign song!
Great to see the Governor of Georgia will be on the Biden/Harris/Abrams ticket!
And they will probably cut away for Biden‚Äôs Q and A
Donald Trump is the most selfish American politician in recent memory. But listening to these Biden/Harris remarks, it's really a salve for the country that the ticket actually cares about Americans. #BidenHarris2020
You realize Biden already had the minority vote...
I had tears when Biden said, "Possibilities! "
Damn. Biden might as well be talking about Trump's mom up there. Sheesh.
This is actually a pretty good speech from Biden. He‚Äôs really rehashing a lot of Trumps issues as a President and lack of leadership on those issues.
is joe biden perfect? no. does he make mistakes? yes.   but...  joe biden wants and tries to be a good person. donald trump doesn't care.  joe biden wants to do what's best for america. donald trump doesn't care.  and that's all you need to know about this election. go vote.
I cannot see where they say Biden is in the lead and trip is behind its impossible
There's also this belief that you have to love EVERYTHING about a politician/party. Not true at all. I have plenty of issues with Dems, Biden, Kamala, Cuomo here in NY, Obama, whoever.  But at the end of the day, those people are lightyears closer to my values than anyone in GOP.
WATCH: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris plan to make their campaign debut around 4:30 p.m. #LocalSYR #SYR
Incremental changes to the right? Because that's where Biden has went since starting this. Besides, even if there were actual incremental changes happening, people are fucking dying. We don't have time to wait, fuck off.
Pelosi TORPEDOS Biden With This SLIP
Sending all our love from our home. God bless Biden and Harris! Together we will overcome! Thank you for restoring hope in our nation. ‚ù§Ô∏èüéäü•≥ü•∞üëèüá∫üá∏
I can‚Äôt wait to address you by that ‚Äúother title‚Äù Dr. Biden! üòéüòéüôè
Lmao yeah and Biden and his intelligence amd we know how Harris got her start.
I'm sure there's not a single person on the internet that gives a flying fuck about my hot take on the Democratic Presidential slate, so I'm only going to say this once:  Please vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in 2020.
People be like ‚ÄúBiden isn‚Äôt my first choice‚Äù ok but is Trump?????
so so wise. so right about everything.  i guess i could never vote for racist biden who selected a Black woman as his running mate, and Harris who agreed to be running mate of a racist. shall i vote for non-racist trump and pence, or not vote? i've heard not voting is best.
"Trump is flat out saying that Joe Biden is going to put a black guy in charge of housing who will move a bunch of low income people of color into your white suburban neighborhood, so look out! This is just pathetically racist."
My vote isn‚Äôt decisive. I could vote 3rd Party in NYS. However, if I were in a swing state I would have voted Clinton in 2016 and I would vote Biden. I‚Äôm not a fan of Biden‚Äôs strong left turn, but I think Trump is dangerous to societal norms and international relations.
Quite apart from anything else, has it not occurred to him that Biden was the only Catholic on the ticket in 2008 and 2012?
gonna be so funny to see trump lose not just to anyone but to such a terrible candidate as biden. total repudiation üòÇ
True. But in the case of Biden and Harris, they are definitely progressive. Not left-wing, certainly, but left-wing doesn't own the label progressive.
I don't know who needs to hear this, but just because someone doesn't espouse all of the things you do doesn't make them a neoliberal.  And yes, I'm talking about Biden and Harris.
The #NexstarElex producers deserve a shoutout for updating their PowerPoint in the last 20 hours with a photo of Biden with Harris.
We also knew this of joe Biden. Only those who have a myopic view of the world‚Äîonly those who believe that beating 45 will end our ills‚Äîare naive enough to rejoice over this ticket.
Fuck voting. Get out on the streets, fight back against this busted ass system like so many other people are doing right now. In this duopoly we'll always be left with a decision between two piles of trash. We need to cripple the system itself, Biden and Trump are just symptoms.
We all need to vote. Don't fall into the trap of comparing the ticket against your dream duo and getting discouraged; it's not productive. Imagine how much better your life will be with Trump gone, get excited, and vote. When Biden wins, advocate for the policies you support.
Hey straw man... the only problem I have is with hypocrites. No person who claims to be Christian or follower of God can justify their support of Trump, the antithesis of Christian ideals. I see you can judge Joe Biden, but can‚Äôt reconcile your support of Trump.
Agreed! Plus, God for bid something happens to Biden she is completely unqualified to hold the position of presidency.
Ok Johnny Boy. I‚Äôll take Biden‚Äôs religious beliefs over your candidate Devious Donny.
Biden ain‚Äôt it man fuck it Ima vote Ye üòÇ

Senator Harris is the most qualified &amp; most dynamic choice Biden could have made!  She's smart, tough, &amp; confident.  She's worthy of being next in line to be President.  She's a voice that America needs in the White House!  She is a champion for woman's rights, people of color.
You are just full of crap! Joe Biden helped to eliminate the bankruptcy protection for student loans. Joe Biden was against Medicare for all before you were. Joe Biden is a puppet of the pharmaceutical industry determined to keep the price of life-saving drugs out of reach.
Can anyone tell me if Biden drops out after his nomination,will Harris be the presidential candidate
Nate Silver said if today was Election Day he‚Äôd have a 93% chance. (Biden). Damn I wish it was today.
Welcome to 2020 where you‚Äôre not Black if you‚Äôre thinking about voting for Joe Biden, but you are Black if you‚Äôre Shaun King or Kamala Harris... ü§î
Dude...she‚Äôs a United States Senator. If Biden loses in November, guess what? She‚Äôd still be a United States Senator. Oh, I get it, you have no idea what the word ‚Äúdestroyed‚Äù means. Why didn‚Äôt you just say so?
5 Takeaways On The New Biden-Harris Presidential Ticket
Biden‚Äôs about banning weapons. That‚Äôs an increasingly unpopular position lately. Any VP pick would have had problems with different groups of the electorate. Regardless of the choice Trump has always had a shot. I don‚Äôt believe any VP choice would sway good or bad significantly.
I shouldn't be shocked that the people who voted Biden in the primaries think Harris is progressive but it still hurts in my soul
I can't really survive either, considering the medical policy Trump put in place against trans people, that Biden intends on keeping and doubled down on a highly transphobic VP, but you libs don't really seem to care about which marginalized people Biden harms.
"We need change"  And yet you're supporting Biden who will do absolutely nothing different.
Joe Biden has been pretty clear on approach and big goal posts. Democrats and most of the Left is unified around platform in pre- and at- DNC Convention discussions.  What we can accomplish is set by blue seat count strength in the U.S. House and U.S. Senate.  Heavy lift ahead.
CNY Democrats React to Biden Harris Ticket
It‚Äôs crazy. Nothing they‚Äôre complaining about applies to Biden. It‚Äôs like we didn‚Äôt just have a primary where Biden took on and roundly defeated the left wing of the party. If folks want to vote for Trump, just vote for Trump. Stop with the ‚Äúlook what you made me do‚Äù bullshit.
all my homies hate biden/harris but all my homies still voting biden/harris bc all my homies get it
All the potential running mates had baggage of some kind or another. She fits in with the moderate ideas that Biden has, but also might be a progressive voice in his ear on some issues. Probably the best choice at the end of the day. She can go toe to toe with Pence.
Vote for Biden-Harris.
Please wake me when these Trump supporters stop commenting on Biden‚Äôs religion. #HypocriticalAssholes
I think Kamala Harris is a fine pick. A solid pick but I just don‚Äôt see the Biden ticket having enough muster to out fox Trump/Putin
Text TRUMP to 88022! I stand with
Kamala Harris said she believed Joe Biden‚Äôs assault accusers &amp; said during debates that Joe Biden was in favor of segregation. The fact that she is now his running mate, would not make sense in any world until you remember that Dems have no principles except acquisition of power
I think Biden will bring back the Obama team. Valerie J, Yates, Susan Rice, Samantha Power etc. He trusts them the most.
One of the best things about Biden picking Kampala Harris is that Orange contributed to her campaign.
Most young Democrats are highly skeptical of Harris due to her record and many say ‚ÄúSettle for Biden‚Äù so I think they took this advice a while ago.
Republicans are running to BIDEN to save AMERICA from Trump!
Check out the work my friends  &amp; Rachel Landsberg are doing at  They are specifically focusing on state house races between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia to win back this ground.  And don't discount the silent Biden supporters!
Seriously don't think that Joe Biden will continue to attack Kamala Harris now that he has selected her as his VP; that's one less; it's a start; lmao
Let me help you replace Joe Biden with Donald J Trump. Now you have it right.
Keep parroting those fake Trump talking points. Biden has never said that.
Elizabeth Warren is the biggest loser of Joe Biden picking Kamala Harris as his VP candidate. If Elizabeth Warren had supported Bernie Sanders in 2016 or 2020 she might had become Bernie Sanders Vice-President. As a result of attacking Bernie Sanders she now has nothing.
Part of me really wishes that Trump had decided to register dem bc it‚Äôd be interesting to see if everyone on the left would maintain their ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt matter who it is, just vote him out‚Äù mentality just like they‚Äôre saying for Biden/Harris.. ü§îüßê
Flashbacks to Kamala Harris‚Äô wacky policies and behavior...Harris would be the President-in-Waiting in a Biden White House, and contrary to the NY Times, she‚Äôs no ‚Äúpragmatic moderate‚Äù
He will try to make it as trashy as he can. Biden and Harris have so much class he won't be able to touch them. I'm feeling hopeful again, and it feels so good.
How about turning the TV off and focus on this #trumpvirus that has killed 165,000 Americans. Why are you watching Bill Maher ? I expect Biden/Harris will come out of the gate with a plan to fight this virus. You've had 5 months and you're on Twitter talking about Bill Maher. Sad
i really can‚Äôt believe we‚Äôve been screaming defund the police for months and biden was really like:   ‚Äúhold my drink‚Äù
165,000 Americans have died because of your inaction and you're concerned about how Bill Maher looks?  I want Biden/Harris who will focus on the #trumpdemic !
Lessons on God from a self described antitheist? That makes an "interesting" take. Biden claiming to be Catholic but devolving to now support abortion on demand is also a rejection of any ethical view of fetal development science, particularly as pregnancy moves beyond 5 months.
Ordered my Biden Harris 2020 Yard sign to add to my Dana Balter for congress yard sign and my "we believe" sign from signs of justice. Fuck every last Republican in this country.
That number of deaths due to lack of access to healthcare isn't going down under Biden, so definitely wrong there.
Trump already stripped away trans peoples rights, and Biden plans on keeping that policy in place and picked a heavily transphobic VP. You people clearly support us dying from bigoted policies, then have the audacity to insult people who stand up against that. Fuck you.
All women, black, white, brown, Asian, African-American, Indian, American Indian...ALL of us will vote for Biden/Harris! Every BLM supporter.. TRUMP is in deep shit trouble!!
In Kamala Harris, a Choice at Once Safe and Energizing - The New York Times
Biden most likely had little input in the choice.
ALL cops are still bastards and now we get to VOTE for one to take over as president when Biden croaks.
I have a question. If Biden is nominated and steps down before election, will Harris be presidential candidate?  Also if Biden wins, what happens to her senate seat?  Thanks

After yesterday.  Biden nailing the door shut.  Our traitor in chief will promptly make a call to Putin for reassurance.
Good for Biden! He's the ultimate wingman. Now how are the right-wingers going to spin this so it's a bad thing? Trump could never, ever in a million years be anyone's wingman because he's a sociopath.
Your phone didn't pass the Biden sniff test!! üòâ
So excited to see Biden's cabinet and who leads up our government.  The way it should be.
At least Biden has absolutely no shot against Trump in the upcoming election. I personally despise Trump, but his insults are funny. We just can't let this country go to loser, freeloader socialists.
Biden drives a corvette, trump a golf cart.  For all you manly men trump supporters.
If you think I hate the VP pick, you should hear what I have to say about Biden himself. If you wanna support fascism because it's from the blue party, then you can fuck right off.NBA says photographer, Bill Baptist who posted offensive meme about Democratic candidate for Vice President, Kamala Harris gets fired   | it‚Äôs what he deserves.
Negros are the biggest suckers.  Incarcerator Biden picks a black woman and we are all in. We are fooled too easily.  If you want to prove your worth, don't vote and show what your absence means.  Stop begging to integrate. Learn to separate.
Trump was endorsed by the NYPD because they support systemic racism!  Biden was endorsed by the USPS because they are being killed.
That's just rubbish. The 2-party system exists because you've been fed the LIE that 3rd parties aren't viable. I'm willing to bet that if Bernie had the gumption to accept the Green's nomination when they'd offered him, he'd be polling higher than both Biden and Trump right now.
Trump on Friday told hundreds of NYPD officers that ‚Äúno one will be safe in Biden‚Äôs America.‚Äù

Calling Biden racist and showenist and than become his VP. HYPOCRITE..
Guarantee you that you‚Äôre not winning votes for Biden/Harris by discouraging criticism or policing tone. The fact is that people are capable of disliking Biden and/or Harris while still voting for them, as a means of harm reduction. You getting indignant is only driving a wedge.
I‚Äôm simply playing the hand I was dealt.  Donald Trump has done nothing but hurt ME his entire time in office.  He fucked me on my taxes after his tax plan took effect, his inaction with this pandemic nearly ruined my business before it got off the ground.  Biden isn‚Äôt my #1 but
Biden can accomplish more than you if he rode a tricycle.
Wrong. I'm willing to bet anyone that there'll be a new war front if Biden gets in.
Trump. You are in big trouble. Biden's strategy  is working. You want to control the process, but you can not. So, as Mary Trump explained in her book, you will stoop as low as you need to, in order to stop anyone and anything. She said that you have no ability to show empathy.

Hey, continue of Trump idiotic claims of Biden destroying the country. Anybody in this fool cabinet tell him  America  is in the shit-hole. This treator is acting like He does not understand that America is in the shithole gutter. Please, reports ask tuff questions no soft balls.
If Trump DOES cheat again this year, Scott Dworkin, Madam Speaker Nancy Pelosi should disqualify that Nazi &amp; put Biden &amp; Harris in the White House automatically. And THAT is something which she CAN do, as she has that power!
I'll say it now, Mrs. Krassenstein: 'President Joe Biden'!
Yiu shoild ve i the Runing after Mr Biden yes
Hey, Trump saying Biden is going to destroy the country. This country destroyed already, what else Trump don‚Äôt understand 168,000 dead, 5 millions infected 10 trillion increases national debt, 50 millions unemployed. What this incompetence idiot want  total annihilation?
Wow, you people are pathetic! You all hang on every word waiting for him to misspeak.  I‚Äôm sure none of you ever have.  Go get a life, please! Oh and just like no reporters corrected Biden when he said 120 million people died from Covid.  And for Joe the list goes on and on!
I will slide down a razor blade into a pool of alcohol to vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
THE REAL REASON WHY JOE BIDEN PICKED KAMALA HARRIS FOR HIS RUNNING MATE
No mail vote.we shopping at Costco, we can vote in person...You just looking for away to still elections. You know Biden has lost his mind...
What about cutting the cheese? Will they let Biden and Kamala cut the cheese? Perhaps at the debate?
You will see Biden (he probably submitted when VP) and I have no issues with everyone in congress as well
And the fact that this woman is getting support seemingly solely off her being black woman and having Jamaican heritage.....Y'all just want her to make history and nothing else. Biden definitely chose her so that he can get the black vote.
Trump doesn't care about restoring the black community and neither does Biden. We have to do it ourselves.
How about the endless number of videos with Biden inappropriately touching and whispering in little girls ears? If Trump did that he would be shot
Hey, Texas people , you all crazy, still giving Trump 46 percent against Biden. Texas is in a mess, lining up for food bank,  death rate is spiking, unemployment increasing. What is Trump doing to safeguard the texan? COVID-19 is wiping out the state, you want to elect this fool.
Hillary wanted 55. They're are bills floating around the House right now with it at 50, but in the middle of a pandemic Biden's decides that not enough people are dying unnecessarily.
Here's the thing though...Biden and Harris will continue to give away the store.
Trump, have you forgotten? When you ignorantly call Joe Biden condescending names, don't forget about the fitting names given for you. Joe has too much class, so I will stand in for him. Dumb Trump Donald Duck Frompy Trump. Pick one.
Already they are trying to deny, deny ! Schiff &amp; Biden wouldn't even be talking about the investigation if there was nothing there ! I guess they "as usual" must try to take the focus off themselves &amp; put on Trump ! Biden did some bad things &amp; he will never be POTUS !
What should Biden‚Äôs campaign slogan be? #YIAYrev
"Fox News medical contributor " Oxymoron or just moronic?  THIS right here claiming no science behind mask mandate.  Playing Russian Roulette.
If you look at Biden's record and says that any shunning of him is a "purity test", you need develop a purity test of your own. ASAP!
What theory?  My response was to the strategy of making demands of Biden AFTER he's been elected. That's a fool's errand.  I agree the Dems are OK losing. They've beaten who they wanted to beat &amp; are making it crystal clear that they're not interested in anything progressive.
Politics  of division and taxing will hurt our communities. Together with innovative approaches that give people choice that stimulate rather then stagnate our local economy we can all unite. Say no to tax and divide politics #congress #NY04 #douglastuman
Mother says she‚Äôs not gonna let Joe Biden cut his meat. She likes to cut it into little bite-sized pieces so he doesn‚Äôt choke

After the election people are gonna find out their favorite white person that was anti Biden / Harris were really secret Republicans.
So Maga people think Biden and Harris let criminals out of prison.   Woke BLM folk think Biden and Harris lock up too many people.  This is so crazy I‚Äôm definitely not arguing with anybody who says do your research

How about Biden??? He‚Äôs been there for 40 years
Biden is uninspiring.  His campaign is built on fear and not hope.  His saving grace is that his administration is not trying to undermine the social safety nets and basic systems that keep the country functional
If you want to tear the country down, Trump is your guy.  Just know that you might not be where you want to be on the other side of it.  If you think the country is salvageable, Biden‚Äôs your guy.  But he is in no way a revolutionary.
Biden could easily be framed as a Republican based on his record.  But Trump is not even a Republican.  Trump‚Äôs whole playbook is deregulation with a head start for his circle so they can cash in.
Joe Biden Chooses Kamala Harris As His Running Mate And Hillary Clinton Cries Into Her Cornflakes
Big Pharma funds Trump too. The estab Dems and Repubs work for the same masters. That's why they have no issues with Trump's policies; just the way he executes them. Biden's positions are well documented. Trump's still have the space to pull a surprise from his hat.
But he hasn't said he would &amp; that's in keeping with his long political history. So there'd be reason to be skeptical if he'd come out for it. But u have to face reality. Biden &amp; the Dems leadership are in the pocket of Big Pharma &amp; 1000s will continue to die each yr as a result.
A lot of people who're taking money from Big Pharma, including Biden, are against M4A. The majority of the people who live in the country are FOR it. There's no middle ground to universal healthcare. Would you like to be one of those who get left out of that "middle ground"?
She's right. You think Biden and the establishment Dems disagree with Trump's policies; they don't. They disagree with how he goes about executing them. That's all. Biden himself has said nothing will fundamentally change. If Trump's been so terrible, why no fundamental change?

Yo me wa hear a Joe Biden Dub
Can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm defending this jerk and I‚Äôll probably get heat for it but he‚Äôs right.   Biden was against the raid for many reasons, one of which was they weren‚Äôt 100 percent sure he was there.   However, Once Obama made the decision to go, Joe was 100 percent behind him.
Here is one with a quick answer: Trump or Biden?
That's a LAUGH! Joe Biden will ANNIHILATE Trump...and the man can do it in his sleep!
And, what have You done for the US: Implated hatred, divided us,  lied about the virus resulting in 165,000+ dead Americans!  Stop praising others &amp; FOCUS your last 80+ days left! Beacuse Biden/Is next to fix the damage you have CAUSED OUR Naation and the Wolrd!
Biden must be pressured to use the climate crisis to heal our economic woes. Environmentalists are increasingly maneuvering to make sure that the advisers in a potential Biden Administration understand both the peril and the promise of the moment: we either go big or we go under.
Although I have made myself minimise the Kamla criticism on my TL. I spent no time on Biden or the rest ('cept to kiki at CIgay) and don't feel good about piling on the mixed woman like she's the worst. She's not the worst. Important to keep pressure on others as well.
...In this regard I think Trump has started his political campaign smartly. It's almost as if saying Biden selecting a Black/Asian American isn't because he care...but because he wants to win and in light of the BLM Movement she was the "obvious" choice.
...thenones who feel like no matter what they wont win who will truly help Biden. This election will not be won on policies. But by fear and hope simultaneously I think. The candidates just need to know how and who to make afraid and who to give hope....
And I say if he is willing because he seems to have a littlw complex where he isn't as careful with his words and over compensates when trying to explain them. With that said Trump already has his supporters and so does Biden. Its the ppl in the middle ground who feel hopless...
Could you please let Marie know that its not up to Joe Biden !! Is she serious saying Joe wants a mandate on wearing masks but he's going to leave it up to each state ? Really, I guess he thinks he's the President now ?
Oh I see Biden wanna make this shit about black folk. Make a change or shut tf up
Here I start this off it‚Äôs day one of #biden/Harris not taking questions from the press

Amen. I love Joe Biden too though. He and Kamala Harris give me hope. Thank God.
Ok. So you vote for the Biden Ticket. He wins. Now there are people who think you can push them further left. How do you propose we do that? The easy answer is protest and petition. At least to me, that is where the current system does it‚Äôs best work.
Biden &amp; running mate Kamala Harris made their debut together yesterday as the presumptive Dem ticket in this year‚Äôs presidential election.  Meanwhile, Trump attacked Harris as ‚Äúnasty,‚Äù a term he commonly uses against women. #HofstraExperts can discuss:
With you Judge Pirro either Florida or New York.  Vote Trump he‚Äôs no Chump .  We don‚Äôt need hidden Biden.
Shit, sorry Mr. Biden sir
I bet they'd have given her more time had she'd said she wasn't going to vote for Biden without M4A or the GND being a part of the platform.
Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris are going to give us all the hope we desperately need right now, Lea Thompson.
They‚Äôll do anything to discredit Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris from winning in the election, Lea Thompson. Thankfully, we‚Äôre not falling for it.
Problem is Biden‚Äôs gonna be under indictment by then so......
I actually agree with biden being more racist, but hes willing to compromise that to pander to those races, so he might be a bit more susceptible to pressure
Biden is not running for President , Watch the Dem's pull a last minute Switch to Hillary and Big Mike LMFAO Hard up , washed up and Going Down.The Demoncrat party will be abolished 4ever.

Biden never said anything racist. He‚Äôs said some ignorant things but that doesn‚Äôt make u racist. I just don‚Äôt know what planet y‚Äôall be on thinking the last 4 yrs is anything close to Obama/ Biden or anybody. Americans are spoiled.
If u think Biden is as bad as Trump, u r truly lost. That‚Äôs just an idiotic statement.

THAT'S NOT TRUE! The task forces proved to be nothing more than the charade that they really were. Look what JUST happened with the party platform. Where are the left-leaning policies? Hillary had not left policies than Biden. Obama never switched right until he was in office.
What has Biden done to indicate that he's changed? What's he doing to indicate that he's going to change? We're in the middle if a pandemic for heaven sakes, if he's not going to come out for M4A now, when? Stop deluding urself. With Trump's unpredictability, he just might do it.
Americans are so funny. I‚Äôve seen so many think pieces regarding the lack of options for president but just last year y‚Äôall were saying anyone is better than Trump? Now they pretty much don‚Äôt mind Trump if it means not voting in Biden and Kamla ? Interesting.
The optics aren‚Äôt the same. Kamala can be next to any man as long as it‚Äôs a man she is next to. Her only requirement is to be next to one of any race. Tbh her and Biden look like Husband and wife running for office.
Good luck to the Biden &amp; Harris ticket.  I'm a disgruntled Republican. They definitely get my vote!
It IS about what they do and EVERYTHING Biden's done so far tells you that he's NOT moving left of where he is right now. Why'd he change AFTER he's been in office? What's the "progress" being made?   Yes I can prove it - Obama/Biden 2008-2016.   How's advocating for M4A a...1/2
Todays press conference of Joe Biden and Kemala Harris was refreshing and superbly handled. Trump your scare tactic s mean words and worrisome tone tells us everything. You are the one running scared. She is going to be a great VP.
A lot of folks are very supportive of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. I hope the voting numbers showcase the same energy. The entire world is ready to be done with that orange man
In Trump hysterical Obama was the pattern Of corruption he Comey Brennan Clapper Yates Struk Paige are the ones who are corrupt oh did I forget creepy Joe Biden who was the disgusting person of corruption
You guys are going to lose big time with that "far-left" bullshit. Everybody knows neither Biden nor Kamala is far-left. Ah mean their actual records are enough to turn people off without you making stuff up. #Silly

New post (Jamaicans joyful as Biden picks Kamala Harris for VP) has been published on Yaadroc News -
What?! The DEMOCRATS are the ones who've been demonizing the idea of universal healthcare. Hillary said it wouldn't happen under her watch! Biden said even if it passed Congress, he'd VETO it! You're taking comfort in EMPTY words of politicians who are trying to stay relevant.
And your response to that is to fret of the leftist take over here? So a Biden/Harris ticket has got you considering Trump, a man who denies the science on COVID-19 and who has empowered both white nationalists and evangelical fundamentalists? Like take a breath, bro. 2/2
What the hell are you going on about? The left got rebuked this past election, with Bernie accepting defeat and now no Warren vice presidency. You got Joe Biden, a longtime Democratic elite, and Kamala Harris, a former DA who got rejected by leftists as being too much a cop. 1/2

Trump is so meanspirited. Mary Trump chronicled in her book that Trump lies at-will. She says that Donald feels entitled to lie with no conscience of who is  insulted. People who have good sense have to know that Trump is mentally ill to say that Biden is " against God"

trump is like a cornered rat...his camp is more afraid of Biden than Biden‚Äôs camp is of them. #BelieveMe
Sure I get your point of people‚Äôs beliefs evolving and shifting. Problem is those laws along with others created the criminal justice system we have today. Likewise, Biden‚Äôs remarks are still racially charged, so it‚Äôs hard to see that he has evolved in his belief system today.
All these black folks on a whole take down agenda of Biden and Harris. Just say y‚Äôall gonna vote Tr*mp in and go. Nuff ah unu rate Tr*mp and cah say it wid unu chest.
It's amazing to me how much "steam" this narrative is getting. Not to mention how transparent what's going on here is. My guess is anyone backing Kanye wasn't voting Biden no matter what.

yeah i totally agree with that. biden/harris isn‚Äôt good and it‚Äôs fucking depressing that this is where electoral politics gets us
okay i mean. four more years of trump would be a lot worse for a lot more people, my only hope with biden is that pressure from dems further to the left and maybe a halfway decent cabinet can actually get us somewhere

It's defeatist to say that "voting won't be enough to change everything and thata life". Wait are you saying that voting for Biden is that important now?
Because one of them (Joe Biden) authored the crime bill that put young black men in jail while the other (Kamala Harris) carried out the law to the later by jailing young black men even for smoking marijuana while she was bragging about smoking it herself.

I had to just say something, because of Biden and the Democrats,  I no longer support Democrats,  that being said, yes Trump can be all that is bad, said bout him. But to blame New Yorks situations,  CUOMO, DEBLASIO IS WHERE YOU PUT THEM BLAME. THEY HAVE COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED

If Democrats don't have control of Congress how on earth do you think these socialist agendas are going to pass? For Biden to promise something he can't deliver he would be a bigger liar than Trump.
Biden is better than this guy? well, that's probably his only positive point

Only thing I‚Äôll say about this tweet is you can definitely say Biden is creepy. That‚Äôs established. The rest I‚Äôll agree on to this point.
No, she‚Äôs definitely wrong. New York and California are not voting for the monster. In fact he‚Äôs losing to Biden in every swing state except one where he‚Äôs tied. So it appears that you are the ‚Äúbat-shit-crazy‚Äù ones.
FYI, if Joe Biden becomes president he shouldn't have absolute unilateral power to launch nuclear weapons either.  A lot of shit that is obviously messed up about the presidency right now will still be messed up with a different president, even if it's not as obvious.

This is what it will look like when we all celebrate the defeat of Donald Trump and the election of Joe Biden!
Vote for Biden and if you regret it do it after he wins. Like you did with tRump. Seriously  the way things are, all the BS tRump says  and the mess we‚Äôre in why are you not sure what to do? Do you think tRump is gonna change? He‚Äôs not Fares.

A *possibility* is that they have decided to toss in any chance of an electoral win &amp; plan to saddle the Biden admin. with chaos &amp; obstructionism. Kind of 2009 on steroids. Others among em want a straight up stolen election or civil war-the more panic &amp; demoralization,the better.
YUP, they literally were doing this for ego and appearances.  Biden even said it on the congressional floor that they WERENT doing it because of it being a decent human thing it was to change the narrative of Dems being softüòíüôÑ

Yup, the correct strategy to win the election against Donald Trump is to rabidly attack anyone in a blue state that will vote 75% democrat that doesn‚Äôt worship Biden
This is completely fictional. Biden‚Äôs plan does not guarantee every American healthcare AT ALL. There is literally nothing that supports your claim

U being mislead, absentee voting is much different, it's not the same system and nobody parading for joe biden, doing anything for jim crow joe, keep letting  mislead u. Check out the communications act of 1934.
We have conflicting data
The issue is, will she actually stand her ground, have strong convictions, be able to make her stated progressive policies be things the Biden campaign adopts, so that they can become reality? That's the reassurance progressives are looking for.   And we have not bn getting that
Not according to studies that show tens of millions will not have healthcare because they can‚Äôt afford it under Biden‚Äôs plan
Americans were literally just polled and 70% of them support it, with around 80% of Democrats. Its not a prop, we want people to be able to survive. We want Biden to support a policy that a majority of the American people support and will save countless lives.
So many potential actions are inhibited by Democrats saying we don‚Äôt want to open that Pandora‚Äôs box.  It is possible that Barr will indict Obama, or Biden, or others in his administration. If he Opens the box then it must be no holds barred

OK. Let the racism begin: KH is indeed eligible under Article 1, Section 2 of the Constitution. Then the 13th Amendment regards citizenship. There's no question Harris is eligible. Do you think that Biden and his trillions of lawyers would put her forth if that weren't the case?

I was 40 in '94. I can attest to what the climate was like, what white people like me feared, how the rhetoric ran. Biden was kinda mainstream in that. That however, doesn't mean that it was good, wise, or somehow not racist.

Kamala Harris explains her leadership style (it's a strategy Bill Gates uses, too.) (via

Correct me if I'm wrong but Biden was notoriously one of the poorest Senators when he was a Senator.
Up until now I have been pleasantly surprised with Biden‚Äôs campaign, but the DNC speaker lineup is disapointing. If Biden wants to send a message about promoting unity then the speakers at the DNC should include more speakers who truly represent all parts of the party.
His dementia sometimes forces some honesty. Most democrats DO believe that all blacks think the same and that any that don't vote democrat are not really black. This SHOULD offend every black person, but, sadly, there was some truth to what Biden said about them politically.
I don't know how we have Biden on a ticket knowing what he's done! Actually, I do know!
Will this get all the white Etsy women to vote for Biden instead?

Hopefully at least 90% of those 630,000 USPS employees are registered to vote and will vote for Biden.

the first Black and South Asian American woman to run on a major political party's presidential ticket. Harris was raised by her Indian mother. CNN's Vedika Sud speaks to her extended family in India on how her Indian roots shaped her political views.
I think Biden sniffed her out so we are all good
Kamala and Biden accounts are tweeting ten tweets an hour.  I can't keep up.  Where is everybody on their threads?   They've seemingly hired a social media team, theyre trying to preempt a social media opposition campaign to control the narrative.  We cant let that happen.
Report this Trump Supporter immediately! He will regret his decision voting for Trump. Vote for Biden this November. #BidenHarris2020 #DumpTrump
Honestly more people needed to know about  . Because this trump / Biden era is sad.
Definitely! And watch and see how they criticize President Biden and Vice President Harris every single day. (You see what I did there? Pres. Biden and VP Harris!!! It sounds wonderful and Peaceful).
Here we go folks! Ready for the birther conspiracies? Knew this was coming on the day Biden announced she was his VP pick. Trump does re-cycle... üôÑ
then one cannot in good conscience vote for Trump or Biden
Well, they can't go with the "Biden hates cops" route üòÇ
I also hate her for making me want to defend Biden campaign staff
He wants to have those press conferences every day and now that Biden has announced his VP it gives Trump something to turn his attention to. He needs to be challenged every damn day and he needs to not get away with his nonsense. Enough is enough.
So explain how Reparations went from virtual obscurity to part of the national debate, precipitating a congressional hearing and forcing the candidates to produce (albeit inadequate) BLK exonomic agendas... INCLUDING Biden.  No PACs.  No lobbyists.  How?
‚Å¶ reaction to  ‚Å¶ saying that Biden‚Äôs odds are same as Hillary‚Äôs on election night is my 2020 #spiritAnimal
- is it not blatent racism for someone to discriminate in saying they wont even interview any males or asians or male whites or hispanics to be Vice President as Joe Biden just did? Would Violate Title VII if any other employer did so. Are you going to call out Biden?
I meant to say; I‚Äôm pretty SURE... President Biden...
Thought you were running against Biden
Stare down Biden like an episode of DBZ
Seriously-your nominee Biden just openly discriminated against millions of Americans in making it clear he would only consider a woman &amp; then lean toward African American women-not Asian, Hispanic or any males,even if more qualified.That is the very definition of racism-Title VII
I saw how the DNC and the media played thier dirty tricks to give us Biden. I watched every single debate. I watched all the analysis. I saw the framing of questions and the manufacturing of consent. Everyone should be concerned.
Maybe the unemployed cops will volunteer to go out and enforce the mask mandate. I hope Biden doesn't see this, he make it part of his plan
Who needs an investigation to uncover this - Biden just openly  discriminated against the very same people in deciding on who to consider for his VP nominee. Blatent race (and gender) discrimination which would be a slam dunk law suit if it was for any other govt position
Ain't nobody said, let's get Biden/Harris in office and call it a day. From day one, we keep fucking working and pushing. And if a less shitty cabinet can save some lives, then bet I'm picking them over the current one purposely screwing over &amp; killing thousands on their watch.
No leverage?  Blk voters have immense leverage and there is already a critical mass of BLK ppl that oppose this ticket.  Biden needs Obama numbers, nearly unanimous support to win.  He hasn't got that and he needs it. Thats partly why he chose Harris.  Thats the leverage.
Are we talking about Trump or Biden?
He‚Äôll be 75 years old in 2024 (younger than Biden is now but I think voters are going to be over Boomers/senescence in the next cycle).  Also voted with most of the other Big 10 presidents to postpone football, how‚Äôs that going to play in the GOP primary (only half joking).
The first one is so way off. Of course he knowingly said false things...every single day. He is the most dishonest President in history and it‚Äôs not even close. If Biden became President would the stock market crash? No. Was the unemployment rate under Obama 42% when was 5%? No
Enjoy the cartoons, particularly the one from the buffalo news. (Prince's "Baby, I'm a Star" fits the VP selection.) #KamalaHarrisVP
A vote for Trump sounds like a vote for Trump.  Until Biden puts a real economic agenda, up to and including Reparations on the table, the overwhelming blk support needed to win is void.  Harris being a BLK woman is irrelevant. Her VP aspirations are not Reparations.
Biden your FIRED
Biden DPIKE ST THE HEAD OF KKK FUNERAL TRUMP FIDNT YOU IDIOT. Democrats voted to keep slavery Republicans VOTED TO END IT. SMARTEN UP AOC.
Our economy is the worst it has been since 1930 because of trump. Joe Biden wants to restore the economy and bring jobs the thousands who are unemployed bc there was no federal response to covid 19. Nice try though. Just throwing shit now to see where it hits.

‚ÄòSit down‚Äô: Trump buried in mockery and scorn for claiming Biden ‚Äòno longer worthy of the Black Vote‚Äô -
Biden is a puppet. I like the guy, but the DNC is engaging in jeriatric abuse. They are not against guns, as long as they‚Äôre being used to enforce their laws.  The DNC is absolutely against the 2nd amendment, I‚Äôm not sure how that can be argued.
She may be qualified but for the unity of America I really want Biden to pick an African American
And you‚Äôll vote for a guy who openly mocked a disabled reporter on live tv. And where did I say I was a fan of Biden? Sit down fool ü•¥
U.S. Intelligence: GOP Is Accepting Russian Help for Trump
Here's the other hard-left, extreme  quotes the media are BURYING
Russia-Obsessed networks completely downplay intel report showing Iran also wants Biden to win 2020 election
Biden has beliefs, morals, and ethics both as a person as well as a politician, Trump has none #VoteBlueNoMatterWho
The people are asking to hear my voice For the country is facing a difficult choice And if you were to ask me who I'd promote Biden has my vote
What are your feelings on Biden and Biden alone? Not Biden bc you hate President Trump but just Biden as a candidate? Just curious honestly.
I believe that Kanyes run would give disaffected #Republicans a safe place to put their vote if they can't bring themselves to vote for #Biden, thereby causing #Dolt45* to be more hurt than Biden.  #RepugnantCONS &amp; #Donorrhea have been wrong on ALL  predictions, nothings changed!
Kanye "I almost killed my child" "A million dollars for anyone who has a baby" "Harriet Tubman didn't free any slaves" West is going to "meet" with  about "post-covid curriculum"...  üçøüçøüçøüçø Don't touch my supply!yeah i totally agree with that. biden/harris isn‚Äôt good and it‚Äôs fucking depressing that this is where electoral politics gets us
okay i mean. four more years of trump would be a lot worse for a lot more people, my only hope with biden is that pressure from dems further to the left and maybe a halfway decent cabinet can actually get us somewhere

Trump Ads Attack Biden Through Deceptive Editing and Hyperbole
We need daily perp walks starting with Obama and Biden
The Affordable Care Act provides subsidies of 75% on Premiums to policies purchased, expanded Medicaid to cover an additional25 million low income earners, and if Joe Biden wins will provide a Public Option to allow people to purchase Government backed Heath Coverage.
He should do the same thing with the RNC so Biden doesn‚Äôt copy him!ü§®üò°üá∫üá∏
And racism won‚Äôt be close to solved because Biden doesn‚Äôt wanna defund the police, legalize marijuana, give everyone health care, implement universal base income
Always remember that if Biden/Harris do win, we still haven‚Äôt. Racism won‚Äôt be solved just because we have a Black/Asian lady as our VP
Biden would be welcomed to deliver a speech in both his and Trump‚Äôs hometowns.  Trump can‚Äôt say the same.
The same Biden who was part of the Obama administration which saw the drone bombings of 7 Arab countries and arming and funding the Islamic State in Syria in 2012 using the CIA.
Hmm...  Barack Obama reportedly undercuts Biden's 2020 White House run
Yeah they need to be asking Biden Questions real questions. A lot of people are going to be in for a rude awakening if he wins . Biden will ruin this country by taxing it after it's already fragile from corona virus.

Opinion | How Jennifer O‚ÄôMalley Dillon transformed Joe Biden‚Äôs campaign
Why is Harris a phony because she critiqued Biden in the debate, but Lindsey Graham not, even though he viciciously attacked Trump in the debates?
The United States Postal Workers Union endorsed Biden/Harris today; the New York City Police Union endorsed trumpski/not-worth-a-pence. That's all I need to know. 86 45 11/3
She is pro union. Only the union that represent the liberal left . The nurses union support Biden . Why can‚Äôt the Police Union support Trump . You guys are communists.
No, she‚Äôs definitely wrong. New York and California are not voting for the monster. In fact he‚Äôs losing to Biden in every swing state except one where he‚Äôs tied. So it appears that you are the ‚Äúbat-shit-crazy‚Äù ones.
10987654321- What about when Joe Biden, 13 years old kid, joined the boyscouts and was offered a knife?
Hay Biden, you like science? Watch this one, more pure science to follow!
And some white people pretend that they are your friend, like Joe Biden.
Biden, only people with TDS would ever vote for this idiot &amp; crook
So the  will fire a freelance photographer for posting an offensive meme about Biden/Harris, but still won‚Äôt do shit about China and their crimes against humanity.
Who would score higher on a cognitive test....Mueller or Biden.   Kamala is to Biden as  Weissmann was to Mueller. The puppet and the puppet master.  is an American hero
How confident would you feel about ingesting a pill if I gave you 100 pills and I told you that 27 of them could kill you?  The latest from  says there is a 27% chance that Trump could be re-elected.  We must work for Biden/Harris as if we could die
I thought he might wait for the chance that Biden wins.  The clock would be his friend. The DC courts tend to lean heavy to the left. His lawyers are getting pressure not to disclose info in open court. That is why Trump never pardoned Flynn. They want the FBI garbage in the open
Vote Biden, and then push him like hell to do more of what you want. That might work on Biden. Clearly doesn't work on Trump who just doubles down on what you don't like.
Doesn‚Äôt matter. Massive showing of green is just symbolic at this point. At least Biden/Harris will respond to political pressure unlike trump. The populace won‚Äôt go back to the sleepy days of Obama. B/H isn‚Äôt the worst thing if we keep applying pressure and electing progressives
Biden voters will fight harder for their right to vote for a rapist than they will for basic human rights.
And we begin... racist tarks from scared white men...
I don't know how we have Biden on a ticket knowing what he's done! Actually, I do know!
If this is actually how coherent joe Biden is, then I want him pushing for the debates
I think Biden sniffed her out so we are all good
I never received 20% of my earnings taxed, and $6000 more in deductions while Obama and Biden were in an office. You tell lies. If you don‚Äôt believe me, I can let you talk to my tax consultant. I‚Äôm an independent contractor.
Maybe the unemployed cops will volunteer to go out and enforce the mask mandate. I hope Biden doesn't see this, he make it part of his plan
The first one is so way off. Of course he knowingly said false things...every single day. He is the most dishonest President in history and it‚Äôs not even close. If Biden became President would the stock market crash? No. Was the unemployment rate under Obama 42% when was 5%? No
But we not excluding other celebs. We just focusing on Trump n Biden rn cause the evidence against them is insane.
and he's not involved in golden showers...score one for Biden
Biden will kill god
They're still pissed that Bernie got crushed. Trashing Kamala is just an excuse. They weren't going to vote for Biden anyway.

It's probably the right move until Biden/Harris fix this COVID-19 mess! This lard-ass clown won't provide the leadership! Onward!
So... are we still not talking about the "immigrant" kids that came up missing in the middle of a sex trade or Trump Biden Maxwell &amp; Epstein or Trumps rape cases or Flints dirty water or how corona still has less than 1% death rate?
#KamalaHarris says Trump economic policies ran the country into the ground. Complete lie. Trumps policies delivered far more especially to underprivileged and minorities than the anemic Obama/Biden policies of 8 yrs.
i too am not the biggest fan of biden but like he‚Äôs all we got so let‚Äôs hold him accountable and let em know that he needs to be b e t t e r
hi maybe instead of hating on biden ad miss kamala we can push them, FORCE THEM to be better for this country. they will win simply by being the lesser of two evils so we might as well let em know that they ain‚Äôt getting off easy!
Are you voting for Biden for any other reason than ‚ÄúI wanna get X out of office‚Äù? Of course you don‚Äôt because Biden doesn‚Äôt stand for anything. It‚Äôs just the same neoliberal policies that got Trump elected in the first place. We need to have better candidates come 2024

Joe Biden looking about ready to walk thru walls while saying "boo".
Ironic given Biden‚Äôs record
1. Biden will likely have his share of gaffes. 2. Trump said that about Biden to misdirect from his own "dementia" &amp; often accuses others of his own stuff (i.e. corruption and lies). 3. As they say in boxing, styles make fights. She had skills in the primary debates.
I live in the suburbs. I'm a wife. I'm white. I'm voting for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. There are a lot of other people like me doing the same thing. Why? Because this is 2020, not 1957.
Biden could do that, you could never, and on the other hand, you are demonstrating that Biden is for the real people and you are part of the so called elite.

This is all BS. I guarantee racist MAGATs will call Kamala the N word a zillion times between now and the end of her 2nd term with President Biden.
Why would she do one and not Joe Biden?
Biden paints stark contrast with Trump at first campaign event with Harris  via  Awesome team! Bring law and order back.
.  inherited the biggest economic expansion from Obama and Biden and he ran it into the ground, just like he did with every business he inherited from his wealthy dad. #BidenHarris2020 #BidenHarris2020Landslide
This is seriously the only argument they have.   What are Biden's policies? I bet you don't know.
Biden just gave the best speech of his career. People are so busy projecting Trump's mental flaws onto  that they forgot he's sharp and eloquent, especially by comparison.
Biden and Harris would do as much gun control as possible while starting a race war. A continued Trump presidency gives Americans more time to stack ammo and food, but still ends up in the same mess.
I knew this would happen when Biden didn‚Äôt pick you for VP
i just read somewhere that joe biden has dementia LMAOOO on top of all the other bullshit how u gon vote for somebody who can‚Äôt remember shit
Just tell her Warren should be the next Senate Majority Leader to enact the legislative reforms the Biden Harris team are going to run on. It's arguably a more important role than VP.
I‚Äôm 99% sure this tweet was written some times ago, with blanks where the name appears...Biden announces...fill in blanks...tweet away.
You‚Äôre exactly right ‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt black if you vote for trump‚Äù -Biden ü§°
No need to debate with an idiot criminal. Biden should refuse any debate. We will still vote for him
He‚Äôs under the misapprehension that Harris was added to appeal to African Americans, she‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt.  Her appeal is to women in the suburbs.  Biden himself, with full throated work from the Obamas and Bill Clinton, already does and will continue to appeal to African Americans.
Thank God, that Cardinal Joe Tobin is around.  Don't need this idiot up in Providence preaching against Biden while supporting Trump.
Who‚Äôs gonna vote for West? Trumpists are so stupid and confuse that they will vote for him thinking that it is Trump‚Äôs instruction. West will only take Trump‚Äôs votes not Biden‚Äôs.
Nope. Because if you don‚Äôt vote for Biden, you ai black
Literally nothing you post will make me think your father is a better suited president than Biden. Just stop, it‚Äôs hypocritical
Its almost repetitive now. A Biden ticket, a Trump ticket....anyone ticket, no matter the party will never abandon or neglect the Israeli Lobby. Ever. It will never happen. Yet people will still believe that voting is going to make significant changes.
Biden was a cop?
At least Kamala didn't need to sell her soul, like you did for Dear Leader. I saw your soul leave your eyes on the Swamp when your bill didn't pass. Both Biden &amp; Harris are as anti corruption as u once pretended to be.
Regardless of his choice, Biden is still senile and feeble.
Trump's story could happen anywhere in the world. Inherit a ton of money, use chummy connections with the rich and powerful, spin a web of lies, corruption, TV, and demagoguery to seize power.  But the Biden-Harris ticket is the living embodiment of the American Dream.  #VOTE
Joe biden will take social security away.
remember when trump said to Chris Wallace on national television that Biden wanted to defund the police? lol
She will be in the middle, where the majority of Americans are found. And even if not she and Biden will restore our our reputation in the world. #BidenHarris2020
That's it! The alternative to Biden/Harris is not a perfect president/VP slate you agree with 100%. The alternative is four more years of Trump et al.
Joe Biden is Catholic.  Maybe instead of showing your bias and clowning yourself with ignorant tweets, you could use that phone you're holding to do some basic research, Bishop.
Odd...the AP has never pointed out that Joe Biden has ‚Äúbeen criticized for racist comments‚Äù!
One of my favorite things about Harris &amp; Biden is their ability for jubilance &amp; humor. I'm excited for laughter again when we're laughing with them, not at them.  #RidenWithBidenAndHarris2020
The microphone is on the bottom, which is facing away from him!  So if you hold your iPhone the same way Biden does...that makes you just as senile as he is.

I agree, this isn‚Äôt a celebration of a victory at all. I would rather have anyone right now in the office than this current administration. Biden and Harris isn‚Äôt even a great choice, but what is our best chance? You think writing the name of your candidate would make a change?

I kinda have an inkling how the Q thing and the Gates vax will play out. Trump will win though. I'm not bothering to assess many Biden scenarios.
So agree with this.  The fact that we have a Black woman on the ticket is epic and picked by an old white man nonetheless!  Go Biden/Harris
She locked up more black men than anyone other than Biden
Why praise a black women who put more black people in jail than anyone other than Biden?
Seriously? You're gonna call Biden racist? We have the grand wizard of blatant, violent racism defiling the Oval office, and you're trying to call Biden racist? Seriously, what is wrong with this picture??? üôÑ
If Biden wanted a black woman, he should‚Äôve chosen Nina Turner
A chronology of the Kamala Harris as VP announcement on my feed today: YAY! YAY! YAY!--Ugh, what an awful choice--remember what she said about Biden at the debates?--sexually repugnant memes--She's going to run the show, not Biden--she's mean.   And it's not even been a full day.
Joe Biden working with Kamala shows that he can compromise, forgive and build a better company.
She specifically said ‚ÄúVice President Biden, I do not believe you are a racist‚Äù.
If Trump wins, the right keeps "trusting the plan." If  Biden wins the country is definitely worse off, but at least our side will KNOW nobody's coming to save them.
Congratulation Senator K Harris on your selection as Biden VP . I am extremely happy  and excited about our future with you in office. Our real work stars now , we will succeed,  united‚Ä¶
yeah that would be ideal. She's on record calling biden a segregationist and saying she believes his sexual assault accusers and still got picked so I don't think she feels terribly beholden to the public.
wrt supporting the green new deal and spearheading covid relief stimulus. She's definitely trying to have a better record but the main concern is once she has power there's little faith she + biden will change much fundamentally. Harris doesn't make it much worse, it just sucks
I‚Äôm sad that in what feels like a sea of progressivism in the Democratic Party, centrists are always the lifeboat everyone thinks will get elected. Happy to vote for Biden/Harris, but damn are they really the leftist counterpart to Trump?
Trump says Kamala Harris 'nasty' and 'disrespectful' to Joe Biden, surprised by VP pick  via  that means Pence will be eviscerated by her
Agreed! And, I'm registered Republican! Biden/Harris #1! It should be a landslide! I hope tRump &amp; the GOP are under it too! Stay hydrated!
and the voters didn‚Äôt pick biden at polls, the democratic party did it with backroom deals and media manipulation. the game is rigged
Im pretty sure Joe Biden just shit on my neighbors lawn.

She‚Äôs your next president if Biden wins. Won‚Äôt take them long to 25th amendment us! This country is doomed!!!

What is truly amazing is that you continue to push the Russian narrative!  It is now evident there was no collusion between Trump &amp; Russia! For the record, I am not protecting Trump; I am pissed off by what Comey, Clapper, Brennan, et al did; and I believe Obama &amp; Biden knew!

didnt say im not voting. said im not votin 4 a party that doesnt speak 4 me. you say its not guilting but sayin that it means u know what intentions your actions have. and OMG r u makin calls 4 biden? Every sec u spend NOT making calls for biden you are making calls for trump!!!!
no. we already hate biden and nothing you will say will change that. so no. biden is a rapist and a racist and lines his pockets with corporate cash
It‚Äôs really just the same words but written with a lot of w‚Äôs, it‚Äôs just really not funny man. I can laugh at Biden jokes but this ain‚Äôt it

Keep in mind - nobody under 22 voted in 2016, and that age group heavily favors Biden. See my point?
Who cares ? It will be a woman and one with dark colored skin . Great qualifications for searching for a Vice President who will eventually be president because Biden already has signs of dementia .
These idiots don‚Äôt realize that they are running an ad for Joe Biden‚Äôs positive agenda for America.  And BTW - Trump‚Äôs abject failure on coronavirus will cost us more in ONE year than Biden‚Äôs policies will over ten years.
‚ÄúHow could she be tough and a mother, they wondered, not seeing the obvious: Mothers are tougher than anyone. Fearing white male backlash, they tried to control her bouncy Queens persona.‚Äùnever is joe biden 77

Just a friendly reminder joe attempted to defund SS 4 times while in office. What Trump said and what Biden actually did is a big difference. So there is that. But , as you said a big demographic 18-24 as you are on record of saying it stupid. They may not realize it.
I believe I have seen her endorsing candidates. Is that ok?  I‚Äôm sure if the PBA endorsed Biden she would have applauded them. She has only one vision, her own. No deviation.  Democracy only on her terms.
Tweets seen today: I don't care if Trump got caught in a Motel 6 with hookers and blow...  I don't care if the ticket is Biden/Hitler. ..  But sure, remind me again how voting a third party is wasting my vote.
Is there anything that give you concern about using the USPS?   Honestly I am torn on #MailInVoting. I have grave concerns about the union backing Biden and saying (rightfully) it's survival is at stake. Not sure we have the infrastructure. 1 of 2
According to Biden and Harris, Americans have no rights, only those which they, the govt, decide we are allowed to have. I can only imagine what they would do to the First &amp;second amendments. It‚Äôs unbelievable he would say that, but he and Obama said we had no right to refuse ACA
I do think Biden has to do more interviews though.  They don‚Äôt need to be press conferences or even weekly but he does have to show he can be asked questions and respond.  I am confident he can, and will show why he is the choice over trump
The fact that hysterical Trump-hater Colbert used this very justifiable line of questioning on Kamala Harris last night is a major, major deal. The Dems need to get a clear explanation out of her over her attacks on Biden or this only gets worse
5/ ... These are all things Biden can‚Äôt do or wouldn‚Äôt even think to talk about while he plays ‚Äúsmall ball‚Äù scolding is about masks. If Biden wants to make himself more persuasive, he could finally speak out against ANTIFA violence &amp; all the rioting... but he won‚Äôt...
3/ Similarly, oppo research/attack ads on Biden aren‚Äôt working when almost every Dem voter or likely Dem is too Trump-obsessed to remember even Biden‚Äôs recent mistakes.  has taught us about how big the memory hole is for the anti-Trump team when it comes to Biden...
80 days until President Biden!
I‚Äôm a member of the APWU, and I DO NOT endorse Joe Biden!
Yiu shoild ve i the Runing after Mr Biden yes
It‚Äôs August 15 2020 and Biden is going to be the first candidate running for President that will never be questioned at a debate and the fake news media protects him. Vote Republican MAGA Trump 2020 President Trump has answered questions for almos 4 years now. Red landslide
Fake news media supports Biden not having a Presidential debate. Biden and Harris never are questioned about their racist remarks and lies about President Trump. Don‚Äôt worry Jim we know you are bought and paid for.
Wow, you people are pathetic! You all hang on every word waiting for him to misspeak.  I‚Äôm sure none of you ever have.  Go get a life, please! Oh and just like no reporters corrected Biden when he said 120 million people died from Covid.  And for Joe the list goes on and on!
Trevor Noah Made the Best Biden-Harris Jokes on Late Night This Week
So should we not be dedicated to pulling Biden as far left as possible once he‚Äôs there
Damn not really dedicated to this Biden thing are ya
THE REAL REASON WHY JOE BIDEN PICKED KAMALA HARRIS FOR HIS RUNNING MATE
On November 3,2020 remember Obama administration spied on President Trump. Democrats and fake news media lied about Russiangate. Biden will never debate President Trump. Kamala lied about Kavanaugh. Kamala is not black. Pedophiles were protected by democrats and fake news media.
Would continuing to bitch about progressives or phone banking for Biden further your cause
No mail vote.we shopping at Costco, we can vote in person...You just looking for away to still elections. You know Biden has lost his mind...
Remember Mr Biden,we talked about this many times before,just like yesterday,and the day before. Absentee vote,is not the same as mail in voting. Just like legal immigrants are not the same as illegal immigrants. Remember??
What about cutting the cheese? Will they let Biden and Kamala cut the cheese? Perhaps at the debate?
Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report
How about the endless number of videos with Biden inappropriately touching and whispering in little girls ears? If Trump did that he would be shot
Its crazy, a week ago I was actually looking forward to seeing Trump lose, not because of any love for Biden just because seeing Trump lose would be cool but after seeing dems be so self congratulatory for picking Harris for VP I‚Äôm lowkey back to rooting against them
He can't even serve one term!!! He is so controlled by the socialist party!!! and Karmala  only had 3% when she ran for president!! Plus most Americans don't like socialism and don't like that fact that both Biden and Karmala did not say one word on the lawlessness and anarchy!!
No prob just need a Trump/Biden/Sanders/yang/Harris tribunal
So you are saying as Vice President of the United States there was no action Biden and Obama could‚Äôve taken for 8 years as the post office lost billions? The highest offices in our government were helpless even with a democrat legislative majority? Please stop.
When was BIDEN VP again? How does this change what I said. They still lost close to 100 billion in his 8 years. Even if you take off the pension cost from last year the post office lost 3.8 billion. Supply link for your claim please.
Already they are trying to deny, deny ! Schiff &amp; Biden wouldn't even be talking about the investigation if there was nothing there ! I guess they "as usual" must try to take the focus off themselves &amp; put on Trump ! Biden did some bad things &amp; he will never be POTUS !
I just realized I can mute certain words on Twitter and my life immediately improved.  Muted words: Biden Kamala Trump Democrat Republican  üòéüòéüòé
Wow that means a lotüòù she's an ex cop that put in jail more black Americans 12 times more than whites she also said that she believes Biden's accusers but did nothing!!
Only now the dems are interested. 8 years Biden was VP they lost close too 100 billion. I am ok with mail in ballots. What is not ok is that there is no structure or system out in place for the number of ballots they will get. The USPS is NOT part of our democracy.
How long before Hunter Biden and Kamala hook up.
"Fox News medical contributor " Oxymoron or just moronic?  THIS right here claiming no science behind mask mandate.  Playing Russian Roulette.
Politics  of division and taxing will hurt our communities. Together with innovative approaches that give people choice that stimulate rather then stagnate our local economy we can all unite. Say no to tax and divide politics #congress #NY04 #douglastuman
Mother says she‚Äôs not gonna let Joe Biden cut his meat. She likes to cut it into little bite-sized pieces so he doesn‚Äôt choke
I also never said I wasn‚Äôt voting for Biden...
It would be accurate if Biden had shown even remote interest in what the left actually wants. If instead ignoring the majority of AMERICANS let alone Dems he supported M4A. He has come out agains the very foundations the true left stands for.
Harris is now the VP candidate and is now open for her flip flopping-! Her weak 3% presidential run as prosecutor she locked up black Americans 12 times more than others  and the fact that she said that she believed Biden's accusers!! üí• mail in voting is plagued with fraud!!üòù
Stunning how for the 8 years when BIDEN was VP the post office lost close to 100 billion and not one democrat himself included cared. Now they claim it is needed for our democracy? Since when? Wasn‚Äôt created for that and can‚Äôt be broken up at any time.
So is it about medicine or Democracy? Did the usps get more important for some reason this year then the 8 it lost close to 100 billion when BIDEN was VP?
What great "leader" do you know that has to force his or her flowers to do something? A mandate isn't leadership.   Everyone should wear masks. A leader would convince them to wear masks. Neither #biden nor #trump is a leader in that sense
How about Biden??? He‚Äôs been there for 40 years
Biden is uninspiring.  His campaign is built on fear and not hope.  His saving grace is that his administration is not trying to undermine the social safety nets and basic systems that keep the country functional
If you want to tear the country down, Trump is your guy.  Just know that you might not be where you want to be on the other side of it.  If you think the country is salvageable, Biden‚Äôs your guy.  But he is in no way a revolutionary.
Biden could easily be framed as a Republican based on his record.  But Trump is not even a Republican.  Trump‚Äôs whole playbook is deregulation with a head start for his circle so they can cash in.
Biden won‚Äôt even take questions and Trump gets this kind of disrespect !!
If it is the last breath I have in my body, I will be voting for Biden/Harris on November 3rd. I have a back problem &amp; can‚Äôt stand for more than 5 - 10 minutes. I WILL STAND, KNEEL, CRAWL OR WHATEVER on November 3rd. Hopefully the rest of my NY family will do the same.
Catholics take note about this promise from Mr. Biden.
üí•Most Americans all ready know the crimes of the Obama Biden administration!,üòù
And, what have You done for the US: Implated hatred, divided us,  lied about the virus resulting in 165,000+ dead Americans!  Stop praising others &amp; FOCUS your last 80+ days left! Beacuse Biden/Is next to fix the damage you have CAUSED OUR Naation and the Wolrd!
I wonder if #biden chose #KamalaHarris  because she smelled the best when he sniffed her. Although Harris may be too old for his tastes
Was this the mantra during the 8 years Obama - Biden were in office as they lost close to 100 billion? Or is it the mantra now that you want something from them?
Of course it was. Anything positive you can relate to the Obama Biden admin anything gnegatuve trump just didn‚Äôt listen.
Could you please let Marie know that its not up to Joe Biden !! Is she serious saying Joe wants a mandate on wearing masks but he's going to leave it up to each state ? Really, I guess he thinks he's the President now ?
All the times Kamala Harris criticized Joe Biden during the Democratic primary
Can you elaborate on what Obama and his VP Biden did to save the usps as it lost billions 8 years while they where in office with a high loss of over 13 billion? Now it‚Äôs an issue?

Yeah but other things in the world matter besides just Donald bad. Meidas, Lincoln Project, etc do not care &amp; focus only on Donald bad as shown in this tweet. Unfortunately and begrudgingly I‚Äôll be voting for Biden. Nothing to do with the stupid nonstop ads Meidas or Lincoln make
I‚Äôm worried that Trumpsters are now intentionally undermining these polls, so as to give the impression that turnout for Biden supporters is not as critical as it is. Eye on the prize!
Problem is Biden‚Äôs gonna be under indictment by then so......

Biden/Harris.. you know it

It‚Äôd be great if Biden was. But with his record, diet republican is likely the best case scenario
do you think Biden will ever post another tweet that doesn‚Äôt mention Kamala and how incredible she is? It‚Äôs already so stale
Judge please start hammering Mr.Biden‚Äôs stamina !!!!!
Saying both sides are evil and having concerns with each isn‚Äôt promoting a third party. I will vote blue to vote fascism out, I just won‚Äôt be happy at all about it. Doesn‚Äôt mean there aren‚Äôt legit criticisms to be made for Biden/Harris and all neoliberals.
Biden is a racist but thats ok they will let him slide ! He' &amp; Kamela are a joke !

I was, and am, a big Sanders/Warren supporter. Biden &amp; Harris aren't my dream ticket. It doesn't matter. Trump is a Fascist narcissistic ignoramus who has already run roughshod over our democratic republic. We do not have the luxury of sitting this one out. I mean, really!.....
A Catholic that supports abortion is not a Catholic they are not even Christian hence Joe Biden. #JoeBiden #JoeBiden2020
Sure I get your point of people‚Äôs beliefs evolving and shifting. Problem is those laws along with others created the criminal justice system we have today. Likewise, Biden‚Äôs remarks are still racially charged, so it‚Äôs hard to see that he has evolved in his belief system today.
It's amazing to me how much "steam" this narrative is getting. Not to mention how transparent what's going on here is. My guess is anyone backing Kanye wasn't voting Biden no matter what.
PLEASE don‚Äôt vote 4 Biden n Harris
What racist mantra? You realize the Biden actual words right! You realize his running mate called him a racist. But yes it‚Äôs my mantra. Ignore his history. Please tell me what your racist Trump did to the  black community?
Maybe if Biden and his team are concerned about Stein voters they should consider a few substantive policy concessions that would get them on board

Trump supporters have been scoffing at Biden for months, but Joe doesn‚Äôt spike the kind of anger &amp; dislike that Hillary or even Obama did. That‚Äôs exactly what Kamala ‚Äúbrings‚Äù to the table. This move is actually doing more to fire up Trump‚Äôs base than anything else

You should have to earn the people‚Äôs votes, not be shamed into voting for you. We must beat 45, but as soon as Biden wins, the protests must start DAY 1!! I‚Äôm seeing people ‚Äúcelebrating‚Äù this ticket. They better be willing to vocally criticize them and demand for more out of them

Ok then. Guess you win. Policy doesn‚Äôt matter to anyone anymore. I hope you‚Äôre not a protestor &amp; don‚Äôt know any because under a Biden-Harris presidency they would be seeing the same resistance as they have under 45. But Biden will... tweet less?
Right and my point is because 45 is abhorrent and incompetent or whatever disparaging word you would like to use... it doesn‚Äôt make Biden a good candidate. It doesn‚Äôt mean Biden-Harris will change anything.
Oh snap!!! You got him!!! Nice job man! Biden would spell Booker‚Äôs name right the first time! Best POTUS nominee ever!
How many people do you reckon would be dead with Biden as president during this global pandemic?
What in the world are we expecting to change if Biden takes over? Less tweets? More ‚Äúprofessionalism‚Äù? Nothing of substance that will help disenfranchised people. No M4A means the last four months under Biden would‚Äôve looked similar to 45‚Äôs rule.
biden is senile, they know it, and they wont let him debate.

Probably without mention of the 167,000 dead Americans, or the post office, but with fake info news about Ms. Harris and Mr. Biden,.
They don't care. They just want to hear that the guy is gonna make things better and Biden lies but they dont care. That is ok by them bc they are used to lying. The guys there for a lifetime are the biggest crooks. They dont want to make a country just steal from it.
You told the people of #NY22 you wouldn‚Äôt support Pelosi, but by voting for Biden instead of her opponent, Pelosi needed one less vote to win. That means voting for Biden had the same impact on the outcome as if you voted for her. That‚Äôs BS.
I did extensive research on Malcolm X for a class last year. He was pretty clear that he despised people like Biden for their lack of honesty. There's not any way of reinterpreting it. He didn't die with this position, but it was a large part of his Black Nationalist Ideology.
The mental gymnastics are impressive here. Truly Olympic level. 86% of Dem voters and nearly 70% overall support Medicare for All. Biden said he would veto it. What left coalition is he part of when he can't even take what can only be described as a mainstream position like M4A?
Major US postal workers union endorses Biden for president
The fact remains that Biden is and has always been a corrupt neoliberal. The best possible case you can make for him is that while he is ultimately not the preferred option and is largely bough and paid for by the oligarchs, hes more prone to public pressure than Trump would be.
Man you people really are delusional. Im not trying to be rude, but if you think Biden is some kind of covert lefty who is just trying to 3D chess his way into a real progressive future, were not living in the same reality.
Honestly, it depends on how hard right Biden pivots. If he, like im guessing he will, pivots to basically Bush Era conservative and continues to attack the left, my vote is going elsewhere if I even vote at all.
#SaveTheUSPS Protect mail-in ballots against those bent on sabotaging the elections!
Aren't there laws against this? If he goes ahead and dies this, we should hold a rally in Washington, DC that same day for Biden.
If Kamala Harris is suddenly so bloody wonderful- why didn't the DNC nominate her for their POTUS choice? IMO- they need White male Biden as the placeholder, to then enact the 23rd Amendment. If not that- then Biden will at most be a puppet of the Squad, BLM, and Pelosi-types.
It‚Äôs astounding. Biden has always been a buffoon.
We know that Biden wouldn‚Äôt have imposed the China Travel Ban on Jan 31st.  How many lives would he have lost if he were President?
Old Blooper Biden-
I have literally been on a Zoom call, a Google Meet or WebEx meeting since 11:00 this morning. Just ended a 2 1/2 hour meeting. I've got a half-hour break until my next one (a training for the Biden/Harris campaign!).  #WFH #ScreenLife #2D #ZoomFatigue
Now they are all for Biden.
You're just scared shitless aren't you. Biden now leading Wisconsin by 12 points. The Turnip needs a new war room team cuz you're going down the drain.
He is movable" how pathetic, don't be fooled Biden is an empty vessel
It's fantastic news that Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris! They will be an awesome team!
People who settle for biden, that's great do you. But don't you think for one minute you're doing the noble thing. Just because he wears a blue tie and has a D next to his name doesnt make him any better than tRump

Cmon Chris. Inly the Republicans are corrupt and the dems are left wing despite all global markers putting them center right and wall street likes biden cause they want a tax increase...jeez. isnt that obvious? Here's a link that doesnt answer a simple question..
Oh the retweet as if you've done anything more than mental gymnastics for why wall street prefers biden. It could have to do with him saying "nothing would fundamentally change" for them if he was president. Yea. Its about wanting their taxes raised.
People keep saying that but never point to specific policies that actually make that point valid. Its just a media talking point, bud. Wall Street is ecstatic about a Biden Harris ticket. I dont recall them being excited when it looked like Bernie was going to take it
What issues that poll above 50% in the Democratic Party voter polls does Biden support? Please, I'll wait..
Progressives don't bathe in superpac and wall street cash. Thats literally the bare minimum. And there's GND, M4A, cancelling student debt, tuition free higher education and trades. None supported by Biden. You can keep the word liberal but stay away from progressive.
should decline and state specifically why. This is a slap in the face to the people who have backed Biden despite all of their objections. And were supposed to be excited in November that Biden has an open ear?
I bet Kasich will get enough time to whitewash his anti union pro forced birth record in support of Biden...
Ha, ha, ha, ha, keep trying trumpy, but it aib't going to work. Not just dems but Republican women and men are going to vote for Biden to end your tenure.  You can try every gimmick but it just makes it worst. You have become a loser.
Every American who plans on continuing to support Trump should watch this repeatedly every time he tries to scare us about what the country would look like under a Biden/Harris administration. This is what the country looks like NOW. Scared yet? #NothingHasChanged #FireTrump

Who is Kamala Harris? A look at Joe Biden's vice presidential running mate
Biden is the Trump of 2020 when it comes to the opposition preferring to run against them. Better hope they were also wrong about being able to beat him unlike the DNC with Hillary.
maybe it wasnt a good idea to allow war criminals into the "resistance" and Dems are morons for praising him and the rest in the first place. Not to meniton, what he's saying is correct. They much preferred Biden with how weak he is. I bet a good deal of these guy turn before Nov
Kamala attempting to incarcerate poor people for truancy violations while allowing Steve Mnuchin off without even a fine for ripping off the entire state of ca. Biden's support and complicity in the Iraq war? Biden's bankruptcy bill that screwed a generation of students?
Do we have to discuss Kamala withholding evidence that would have exonerated a death row inmate. Or Biden writing the Crime Bill and Patriot act? His recent comments about black ppl? His response to BLM being inflate police budgets? His support of the Hyde Amdnt until last year?
I don't want to debate you. I don't actually care what you think at all because i'm not interested in navel gazing. Biden supports keeping MJ an illegal substance and puffing police budgets so all of your speculation is meaningless.
Apathy is going to lose Dems the election quicker than anything else. Democrats need to push a better platform People don't vote against things they vote for things. If enough peopel aren't convinced their lives are going to improve with Biden they wont show up. Votes are earned.
OK- Hannity just asked/remarked "how fast he (Trump) had a reply Tweet for the Biden-Harris news", and did he know ahead of time? Trump laughed, paused, said "we have some good people here". Just like Biden I highly doubt that 1/2 of Trump's Tweets are actually his. Others
‚ÄúShe basically called him [Joe Biden] a racist,‚Äù Trump on Kamala Harris.
Who are they appealing to with this pick? People who were already going to vote? This is a clear signal to the left that Biden doesn't give a damn about appealing to them. And it's a cynical use of "Diversity" to deflect criticism by using a WOC as a shield.
Get the excuses ready. When Biden/Harris lose, it will be because the US is misogynistic. We just simply aren't progressive enough as a country  to handle a woman VP. #BidenHarris #BidenVP
This is why Biden picked her. Biden hasn't changed from his old racist ways. He's using a black woman as a shield to deflect criticisms of him under the banner of racism and sexism. You cannot be against the guy who wrote the crime bill and argued for the war on drugs.
At least Biden can read. El Trumpo screws up every script he reads.
....this is why Biden picked Harris....I was wondering who was going to be the first to call someone sexist....good for you...
Well then you need to get on the phone bank for Biden. Every call you dont make for Biden is a call for Trump.
Please. Tell me what substantive ways that Biden presodenct would improve on Trumps current trajectory.... he wrote the crime bill and the patriot act supported the Iraq war supported the coup in Venezuela told his wall street buddies nothing would change...go on...
Larry, trump with destroy Biden in the battle debates. Election is a month away and haven‚Äôt had one debate. He‚Äôs duckikg trump
7000 tweeters agree with me that Dana Perino helped out Jill Biden with her interview but ignores our fantastic First Lady.  Dana.. You better shape up!
During the Democratic debates Harris called Biden  basically a Racist and now he is wonderful.  She wants to be President and hopes that Biden is put in a rest home as soon as possible!
Nobody expected Bernie to be picked. Nice strawman. People were looking for some idea that Biden was willing to hear us out and hes priven over and over he won't. He could have picked Barbara Lee and people wouldn't have turned on her. This just makes less lefties likely to vote.
If Biden wins, make him Secretary of Education and that‚Äôs a hell of a cabinet to get a term started.
Do you really think "crime bill" Biden would hand his legacy over to a black woman? He'll fight until his hands won't push his wheelchair. He's using Kamala to be able to accuse people of sexism and racism. Hes an opportunist. His world diversity is a tactic not means of progress
Is Donna Brazile going to leak the debate questions to Biden and Harris just like she did for Hillary and got caught. She cannot be trusted on FOX!
"Biden is going to be the most progressive president since FDR"  Watch how hard right this guy moves once the nomination happens. This guy is going to make Bush look like a flower child.  Apathy wins for me this time. Im out.
Joe Biden is responsible for the 94 crime bill that put a whole lotta Black folks in prison. But he chooses Harris and it‚Äôs alllll ok üôÑ Foolish.

"‚ÄúI think she remains a low-risk pick for him,‚Äù said one source who speaks to Biden. ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt have a lot of baggage""  She tried to imprison poor sick people for truancy violations and let one of the largest white collar criminals in history off without so much as a fine....
Biden did say his job was to make sure the Mayor Petes are the future of the Democratic Party..I though that just meant kneecapping the left, but I guess it was literal too.
Trump doesn't know shit. He confuses the second world war with the 1917 pandemic. So stupid. And still never mentions the more than 165,000 dead Americans as if they never existed. The Turnip is losing  and trying to bad mouth Biden won't work. Dumping Trump is all that matters.

Hey New Zealand. How about you take Biden and Trump and We'll take her. I know neither of them are worth the shirt she's wearing, but were desperate and our choices suck. We either get neoliberalism or straight up fascism...
That explains why Jeremy Scahill, Aron Mate and Matt Taibbi are all on there. They all were instrumental in pointing out how Russiagate was an unfounded conspiracy. Other than that, they've also taken the Chomsky tact of "vote Biden and put on the vest after Trump is out". Jesus.
that vote has stipulations. If we allow Biden to continue on the neoliberal track of the last 40 years the next Trump isn't likely to be as incompetent. You lying about him supporting GND or M4A and people not getting it is going to disillusion people and make the case harder
People don't vote because they don't see enough of a difference and avoiding Biden's flaws and not pushing him before and after the election is going to send him in on a mandate he is currently on which is maintaining the status quo. Vote for him, sure. But make sure he knows
Man, this person decides who is progressive like Biden decides who is black....
You literally lied about Biden's aspirations in office as if he was in favor of policies he's clearly on the record to not being. And his medicare "concession" was less than what Hillary offered in 2016. You're being dishonest. Hence K
Biden is compromised on China. voted for Biden for Speaker. Biden and Brindisi are scrambling to cover up their Pro-Chinese Communist Party support.
That was not a reply to you. Piss off. And, Biden wrote the Patriot Act which largely justifies sending government thugs into cities. And Biden will not go for any of that. He's expressed his firm oppostion to both, specifically saying he would veto M4A. you're lying.
Can someone explain to me what these people are for if Noam Chomski is on the list of "bad lefties" hes literally out telling people to suck it up and vote for Biden even though he's shit. Its like they're not even happy with that if it doesn't come with blind allegiance...FOH...
If we don't get change, we're asking for another Trump in four years. And the next Trump might not be so incompetent. Honestly, my vote depends on the futility of the next four years. If I think that things will get better and Biden will move, I will vote. If not, I stay home.
The "process" resulted in Joe Biden being the nominee. To hell with the process. People are done sitting around waiting for elected leaders to do the right thing. Removing Trump is meaningless if people's lives don't improve in the process.
What you Trumpies keep harping on about Biden is of no consequence.  The goal is to get rid of Trump. Period.
No Wrist Corsages, Please
At this point, with this president, Biden could run with anyone. The focus should be on beating down everything trump says and does, day and night. This is a war, and a trump is taking the advantage. Dems have to get moving - NOW.
Get Biden out the basement and off his bicycle  and start shredding Trump for his fiscal policies, ignoring the needs of millions of Americans; but most of all hammer the Turnip on 160,000 dead Americans. No more plans. Hit Trump and his lackies 24/7. He's out of the basement.
"Nothing will fundamentally change" we might move on a few issues, but the authoritarian tendencies exist at the highest levels of both parties. Were basically just electing a blue version of Trump with Biden.
Elect Biden. Win the Senate. Keep the House. End the filibuster. Redo the Census.
Both Presidential candidates seem to be, unfortunately. Biden's seems slightly more progressed, but they both clearly are not as sharp as their former selves when speaking.
You need a powerful Dem who can stand up and recount every Trump transgression and hammer him on it day and night. Then let Biden come in with the solution. No talk about some vast plan. Just plain solutions that will make Americans "proud". Recount T's failures 24/7. Pelosi?
Biden risks alienating young Black voters after race remarks
Trump is trying to steal the election and the USPS is a major part of his plan. It's time for Biden to name his VP and start countering Trumps moves. Precious time is being lost in this process. Biden may be ahead but if votes aren't counted he could lose.

yeah i totally agree with that. biden/harris isn‚Äôt good and it‚Äôs fucking depressing that this is where electoral politics gets us
okay i mean. four more years of trump would be a lot worse for a lot more people, my only hope with biden is that pressure from dems further to the left and maybe a halfway decent cabinet can actually get us somewhere
It's defeatist to say that "voting won't be enough to change everything and thata life". Wait are you saying that voting for Biden is that important now?
Because one of them (Joe Biden) authored the crime bill that put young black men in jail while the other (Kamala Harris) carried out the law to the later by jailing young black men even for smoking marijuana while she was bragging about smoking it herself.

Americans were literally just polled and 70% of them support it, with around 80% of Democrats. Its not a prop, we want people to be able to survive. We want Biden to support a policy that a majority of the American people support and will save countless lives.
So many potential actions are inhibited by Democrats saying we don‚Äôt want to open that Pandora‚Äôs box.  It is possible that Barr will indict Obama, or Biden, or others in his administration. If he Opens the box then it must be no holds barred

I‚Äôm surprised it‚Äôs only 59%. He clearly has dementia, &amp; bc of his outbursts, likely Alzheimer‚Äôs. He will have an exam by White House dr. Dr. will deem Biden ‚Äú... to suffer from mental disease or defect...‚Äù &amp; declare him unfit for job. Harris becomes Acting Pres. Nightmare!
Biden/Harris are better for more Americans than Trump/Pence.   As an American, go with the candidates who are more likely to do more good and less harm to the majority of Americans.
I don't want a President who gets off being pissed on . On top of that , he's been pissing on all of us for almost 4 years . I'm not into being pissed on . BIDEN/HARRIS 2020  #WorstPresidentInHistory
Did #Trump just imply that Biden wouldn't know what he is doing if elected? Yeah, that lifetime of public service and 8 years as VP totally leaves him unqualified to lead. smdh. #whitehousebriefing #trumpPressBriefing
Breaking in down so anyone can understand; The Harris Biden 2020 Campaign.
Actually, we are well informed.  Thats the point.  Have you read any economic policies SPECIFICALLY allocated for BLK Americans in Biden's  plan that would constitute the kind of support we are being asked to hand over?
He's in CA. The way the electoral college works. There's no way his vote to nominate Bernie affects the general vote for Biden in CA in November.   I'm in a similar situation cause I live in NY. Im gon write in Bernie but in NY that still means Biden will win NY
This is what Biden told voters to do as well...don't blame us when you lose!
Here is thing I don't like Biden. Nor do I like Trump. But hopefully Biden gets in then gets impeached and hopefully Kamala Harish becomes president and then we are still screwed.
Saw a woman, sorry, person with a cervix, wearing a Biden tshirt at trader Jose‚Äôs. She looked ashen.
Ok ladies let‚Äôs buy Biden/Kamala merch
Trump says Joe Biden "Doesn't take questions" But Trump doesn't ANSWER THEM! He's gotta GO!!!
"Unable to put a dent in Biden‚Äôs lead in the polls, Trump and his Republican operatives are now trying to tarnish Harris with charges that she is too extreme, too liberal, too leftist and ‚Äî in a twist ‚Äî not quite black enough."

We fucked either way bc if trump win, that‚Äôs an L, if Biden win L bc niggas prolly gonna lull down
Trump might win this election frfr bc im looking at all the hoops we possibly gone have to go through to get mail in ballots counted and niggas already not enthusiastic about voting... so we damn sure not risking our health to go vote for Biden on election day
Vote for Biden anyway!
I've gotten up every day since Joe Biden selected Kamala Harris feeling slightly happier than the day before. #BidenHarris2020
It's almost like going to war based on a lie. . . oh wait! Joe Biden did that too. . .üôÉ
He‚Äôs not the president idiot, Drumpf is and he has screwed everything up, believe that Biden will end it appropriately
The choice is Biden or the guy rounding people up with a secret police force.   Choose wisely.
I'm typically  not, but this is serious shit going on with the USPS.  I've been expecting for the last two years that Trump would do anything to rig the election and will refuse to accept the outcome if it shows a Biden-Harris win.  Plus he has Barr in his corner.
Judge orders tRump to submit #Evidence of fraud in mail-in voting. Can you share some of yours, and help the old criminal out,  and   #FakeVoterFraud
1.Biden pushed to have more funds and federal resources to cure cancer. As a life-long politican he was able to cut through some of the red tape. 2. He pushed as VP Obama to sign legislation allowing same sex at the national level making it illegal to discriminate or deny!
Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi.  Hear this loud and clear.  Just because the Dems have an outstanding ticket they will have zero chance of being elected.  Once Trump gets done with obstructing the vote the tally will be Trump 99%, Biden 1%.  Just like Saddam used to do.

They're afraid of the boogeyman version of Biden that doesn't exist. A Marxist that will take their guns, make them gay, and force them into slavery under women and poc.
If voting for Biden were the same as voting for Trump, Republicans wouldn't be going out of their way, illegally, to prevent people from voting for Biden.
I was 40 in '94. I can attest to what the climate was like, what white people like me feared, how the rhetoric ran. Biden was kinda mainstream in that. That however, doesn't mean that it was good, wise, or somehow not racist.
Vote for Biden
Yes, i encourage everyone to read through the comments. You will clearly see that the responses to Joyce's vile, disgusting post are organic and authentic. Joyce thinks if she says "Trump and Russia" enough times, ppl will dismiss the overwhelming opposition to Biden/Harris.  No.
From what I've seen it's been a lot of condescending "y'all are too young to understand" takes in defense of the bill that coulda just never been tweeted while folks are critiquing Biden.
If folks woulda sat there, and ate their food, and let Joe Biden get the licks he deserves, wouldn't be no "the crack era wasn't even that bad" takes.  But, here we are. . .
Vote Biden, and then push him like hell to do more of what you want. That might work on Biden. Clearly doesn't work on Trump who just doubles down on what you don't like.
Best words? üòÇüòÇüòÇAnd Trump makes fun of Biden!
And, let's be clear, folks #onhere been defending the 1994 Crime Bill since Joe Biden announced.  That's why we're even having this argument now. This asinine argument over a bill that's objectively bad.
Biden is not the president blame your guy who‚Äôs gonna take all yall down with himüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Oh my God! That‚Äôs enough. She is like CREEPY, SLEEPY JOE BIDEN! And we all know the numbers are BULLSHIT! Cardiac arrest: Covid; broken leg: Covid; head injury: Covid; drug overdose: Covid.

Joe Biden knew EXACTLY what the fuck he was doing back in the day.  And, to posit his work as some kind of "mistake" that wouldn't have been made with hindsight is asinine.  WHY THE FUCK ARE Y'ALL DEFENDING THE FEDS?!

Ask Joe Biden he literally said the same thing.

Biden‚Äôs Pledge To Choose A Woman For VP Was Popular ‚Äî And So Is Harris   Biden‚Äôs decision to pick a woman as his VP has remained widely popular, and in Harris, he‚Äôs found a solid No. 2. She‚Äôs already been through public scrutiny of her record and background
No  The coming together of Arab &amp; Israel states wasn‚Äôt built from the efforts of the failed Obama-Biden Administration. In fact, your adm. contributed to the great unravel of the Middle East, rise of brutal terror organization &amp; destroying Arab-US alliance #UAEIsrael
‚ÄúQuestion is‚Äù... Question? Biden doesn‚Äôt have to face questions. They won‚Äôt let him even comment on the weather without a script. Your candidate is a pathetic joke.   But us ‚Äòwingnuts‚Äô are ‚Äòtriggered‚Äô.If you think things will be okay if Biden wins you need to yeet yourself away from me.
Pretty much all liberals who say they'll hold Biden accountable have no plan of doing so, have never organized, &amp; are going back to sleep once he takes office. Any criticism of Biden will be met with accusations of divisiveness, helping repubs, &amp; Russian trolling.  Mark my words
We need to prosecute that son of a bitch and put him away if Biden wins (along with all his scumbag associates involved in his crimes) both a.) because he‚Äôs a criminal and deserves it and b.) if we don‚Äôt then laws, ethics governing politicians behavior will be meaningless
She wasn't? Like wtf. You think Biden would pick her if she couldn't be president in the event of his death? How stupid are you?
Trump shutting down USPS puts nearly a million people out of work.   So I don‚Äôt wanna hear all this ‚Äútrump helps unemployment and the economy‚Äù BS when the man will cut a whole workforce to try to avoid losing to Biden.
In the beginning of the video the woman having people leave said thank you, then the question was asked, I think, I only heard mumbling though. Both Biden and Harris were still sitting there, why not yell the question out if it was that important.
Well then you have a lot of catching up to do.
I‚Äôm happy that whole despicable fiasco is pretty much over though; the behavior of countless hacks using Reade as an excuse to try to upend the primary (and not a few Biden fans as well) was just disgusting. Trying to keep an open mind got you called a Rape Apologist
I didn‚Äôt know Biden had such an interest in gardening tools, at first thought you were calling Kamala Harris a hoe. You were referring to his love of gardening right? Or are you calling her a hoe bc you‚Äôre afraid of powerful women? If it‚Äôs that then, prayers for you.
Hope the Biden administration is prepared for the width and breadth of the Trump transgressions it will have to investigate and charge. The volume is absurd.
A Biden-Harris administration.
Tell 'em, Joe!!!! BIDEN/HARRIS 2020!!!!
Republicans aren't running the country.. their running away from it. Our country's foundation is being torn apart one brick at a time by trump and his enablers.. it's time to fix it and get Biden/Harris in to get it started! Thank you Senator Warren for all you do for us
But I thought you said Biden was a racist
They may have to hold their nose, but they should vote for Biden if they want to even sniff their policies being realized
She won't... Because voting Trump out of office is only life or death if it's not hers... I on the other hand fear that ensuring Biden doesn't get into office IS life or death, and will be voting in person at my local polling facility...
Given the breadth of Biden's career, with his career-long ideology that treats public goods as things that haven't been privatized yet, I do not believe Joe Biden is going to save the post office either. He's not going to use it to ratfuck an election, sure, but that's a low bar.
Seriously, if Biden wins, Trump and family are 100% royally fucked (pun intended)! Kamala, the new AG &amp; SDNY will be relentless!!
*whiney asshole maga voice* But.....but......but her emails. And and and Biden has dementia.

It has nothing to do with ‚Äòcentrists‚Äô nor are ‚Äòcentrists‚Äô responsible for low voter turnout (need I remind you that Bernie Sanders had terrible turnout worse than his first run whereas joe Biden won on a surge of it)
I actually think so too at least based on what I know of union political engagement from my time working within the labor movement; Biden is both more malleable than Obama and running at a time when unions are more powerful within the party and more agressive about priorities
Why is it all the comments like this one have 8 digits at the end of their username? That being said, if Biden were to win and fulfill half his claims there may well be a civil war... If Trump wins... The same might happen. We're at a strange tipping point in history.
I haven‚Äôt seen that yet personally (don‚Äôt get me wrong he SHOULD be; everyone else that‚Äôs done even half as much as he has to elect Biden has been deemed a neoliberal hell-demon) I mean most fake leftists are also sanders personality cultists as well..
Kudos for President Trump! China has pushed USA around for to long! Taking jobs away and now giving the world COVID! Trump stand up for Americans. Biden and Harris are weak that is why China wants them. China executes or imprisons it‚Äôs own people, just for speaking their minds.

"We can support those elements in the Turkish leadership that still exist and get more from them, embolden them to be able to take on and defeat Erdoƒüan,‚Äù Biden said, ‚Äúnot by a coup,‚Äù but via the electoral process.
Biden repeatedly says he is "very concerned" about developments in Turkey, calling for "a very different approach‚Äù to Erdoƒüan by "engaging" with the elements of the Turkish opposition leadership as he did during his vice presidency.
Why didn‚Äôt he do anything before ?     You should of had another republican running this term. 2 people vs Biden would of gave you a better shot! A Republican is a Republican. The name shouldn‚Äôt matter!
Biden is the epitome of ‚ÄúTalk less, smile more.‚Äù
You know why a Biden presidency would be great? Because I nothing Biden. I won‚Äôt have to think about him, my kids won‚Äôt be learning any new curse words because of him. He will just exist, like an appendix. Inert. That sounds incredible. To nothing the presidency sounds amazing.
First of all this is not my sole reason for not voting for Trump.Biden is not by far my first choice but I sure as hell will vote for him.The majority of the ppl in my life are either LGBTQ or in another minority and have been hurt on a continual basis by this administration.
It would have to be close in order for that to happen. In a poll by the Hill that came out Thursday Biden had a 52%- 33% lead nationally. I don't see Trump winning in any scenario.
I despise the Trump administration and EVERYTHING they stand for, but I refuse to force my friends and relatives to vote for Biden. American blood wasn‚Äôt shed by our soldiers so that we can turn our democratic election system into those of totalitarian governments.   #Vote2020

Biden and Trump make my skin crawl.
Biden was my first choice. He‚Äôs safe and didn‚Äôt chase the far left. Only candidate capable of ousting Bernie.
I‚Äôve said on multiple occasions that if I were Warren I wouldn‚Äôt have been willing to take the VP job; it‚Äôs not a criticism of Biden but she would‚Äôve been required to push his agenda and forever defined by it; she arguably has more power in the senate anyway

So let me understand your logic here: "you are so opposed to trump that you're willing to virtually vote for him,  writing in a person who is planning to vote for Biden because he opposes Trump."  Your logic makes ZERO sense.

I feel like the "people who smoke cigarettes" poll would be very similar, has to be a large crossover with Trump voters and cigs. Free MAGA hat with a carton of Camels kind of thing.  Biden may have the non-cig pot smoker vote wrapped up.

No choice then. Biden. Or we lose our country as it was intended.
Hahahaha. Sycophants and yes men? The last thing Biden does is ‚Äúinclude all viewpoints.‚Äù You ain‚Äôt black!!! Flipped on every major issues throughout career, including segregation and befriending Klan members. How could anybody, as a self defined liberal, even consider this man?

The idea that Joe Biden is a weak man is laughable. He was just biking last weekend, while wearing a mask. They need to get out of their bubble
They will lose their job and pensions. And then Biden can give those jobs and pensions back in a few months. They're going to lose their jobs and pensions anyway if he's not gone on Jan 20.
Harris is a supporter of planned parenthood. Her &amp; Biden also have in common, locking black men up.

All I'm saying is his presidential bids in 1988 and 2008 went exactly no where but then Obama taps him for VP, the Onion runs things like this, and everyone is all about Joe
Is Biden charismatic or is the Onion's Diamond Joe Biden charismatic and we just assume that is who he really is?

I think they are going to try to indict Hillary or Obama or Biden. They will cheat in any possible way. They are corrupt AF.
At least Dems are against things like Citizens United. We need to stack the federal courts with liberal judges. Biden started early in his career championing public funding for campaigns. The man owns no stocks or bonds. Dems &gt; GOP. End of discussion.

But please explain to me, then, why Biden &amp; the mainstream media label her an African American woman.  Where does Africa fit into the equation?
I think that's about what you'd get. So mixed up that he picked a VP that thinks he's a predator:   Figured out yet that it's all pretend? Just pro wrestling at the top. A show for the cameras. They have a totally different goal, &amp; it's not to save the US.

15:30. Start listening there. The point is, one can mispronounce a name, and not mean it as an evil thing. They really attacked Tucker, wrote articles, etc. Yet, just before she takes the microphone, Biden makes the same, innocent, mistake.
I wonder who Melania is voting for? Keep in mind, Biden wins the divorce from the orange moron can happen 4 years sooner.
I look back to the debates and Biden was just so confident but didn't have answers. I remember several times, him running out of material and talking about how his time was almost over.  It was all orchestrated to fuck Bernie. Biden was the winner before the game began. Fuck that
I think Harris will make a good VP, and she would probably make a better POTUS than Biden in my opinion.

How Biden Chose Harris: A Search That Forged New Stars, Friends and Rivalries
A lack of a vote for Biden is a vote for trump
Theres not a doubt in my mind that no matter how many millions of votes remain uncounted in swing states, no matter how much team Biden begs them beforehand to be responsible, those greedy dicks at CNN, NYT etc will gladly hand trump everything he needs to steal it after the fact
Actually I‚Äôm betting on the ‚Äúdespite decreases in turnout (omitting that it‚Äôs a 75% decrease) and *whispers* some ballots uncounted *whispers* Trump appears victorious BREAKING: PRESSURE MOUNTS ON BIDEN TO CONCEDE‚Äù
Of which one? The one of Tucker was the other night. He said her name incorrectly, not disrespectfully ( I was watching). The man he had on called him on it and made it a big deal. Then Biden as he is introducing her as running mate, says it same way.
Not saying I‚Äôm voting Biden tho. If you live in NY/a blue state and you‚Äôre disappointed with Biden, don‚Äôt vote Biden. A third party/write in vote in NY tells the Dem‚Äôs that you‚Äôre a person who votes, but you‚Äôre not going to vote for just whoever they put up.
You know, you‚Äôre allowed to criticize political opponents while still planning to vote for them. You can both vote for Biden/Harris while still recognizing their problems. It‚Äôs anti-democratic to say ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt criticize democratic candidates because that just helps Trump win‚Äù

Biden did not say he was going to order universal masking or order the governors to order masking. He said he would ask the governors to do so. More lies from Fuhrer Trump.

Exactly this. Biden told us to vote for someone else. ü§£ He refused to budge on healthcare, mildly back peddled on education, and still has gaff after horrible gaff. Not to mention, we're still blamed for 2016 despite "falling in line" and the Electoral College being to blame.
They are doing that now with you as President.  Biden/Harris is the way to VOTE.
I just saw campaign ad by Joe Biden, he plagiarized Mr. Trump 2016 ad campaign. Keep jobs in USA, help middle class and economy. JOE, President Trump has already done that! You have a TV in the bunker? Your VP and THE SQUAD DON‚ÄôT have the same views of America. You don‚Äôt either.
The only good rhat came from is  that the progressives hate Kamala and Biden. They represent the establishment in the worst ways with their justice track records. Leftists don't like that.
Media today: worst ever disease! hide in your basement and forfeit your rights for a little feeling of security. Media if Biden wins: well actually it‚Äôs really not too much worse than the flu, and I guess we could get the economy going again.

Enthusiasm is a nothing-burger metric. Biden supporters are extremely motivated to vote, per polls; they are also enthused to vote AGAINST Trump. An a vote unenthusiastically counts the same as an enthusiastic vote.
could be difficult. Despite Biden's big win in the primaries, the hard core left (and anti israel focused) wing of the dem party will grow in the house.

you accused Biden of being of having unwanted sexual advances and you said you believe the women now you‚Äôve turned a blind eye to it secondly you accused him of being a racist you‚Äôve turned a blind eye to that also so what does that make of you
The self care day imma take after voting Biden
so you said you believe the woman that accused Biden of unwanted sexual advance so now are you being a hypocrite because you‚Äôre turning a blind eye into it and secondly you accused him of being racist have you turned a blind eye to that also
Why does it have to be "YOUR candidate"?  Obama rigged this for Biden to win when we had a chance for substantive change. Yes, he's the lesser evil but we've again been cornered into choosing evil. The truth is we'll have to fight every bit as hard for change under Biden as Trump
America will become weak if Biden gets elected.
Joe Biden's choice of Sen. Kamala Harris, D-California, as his vice presidential running mate elicited broad smiles from key black Catholics. Others, though, started criticizing her record nearly as soon as the pick was publicized

Joe biden already served for 8 years. Yet, here we are.... unemployment through the roof, 100s of thousands dead. Racism rampant. Yeah, were in much better shape now....
That thing that's happening, where everyone is saying ‚ÄúBiden/Harris, not my first choice, but what are you doing to do?‚Äù  It's always like that. Even Obama's first run, I was skeptical just because he seemed a little too young, and i think his first year reflected that.
Biden will try and reconcile with the far right, they will spit in their hand. Brown shirts will be even more out in force, but the police will clamp down in BLM harder than before. Then in 2024 we will have to explain to people that Adolph Mussolini Mc.Killbaby is a villain.
Lolololol vote shaming totally closes the divide... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  "Settle for Biden/Harris and hold their feet to the fire."  *Attempts holding their feet to the fire, shifting the establishment paradigm left before signing away a vote*  "I gUeSs YoU'rE fAsCiSt!"

Ok I want this on record. Here is what's going to happen in the best-case scenario. Biden and Harris win, Dems take the Senate. Biden vetoes NGD, UBI, and M4A. All their "reforms" will be performative at best. The gap between the rich and the poor will grow even more 1/
you And Biden have the unique opportunity and the heavy responsability to turn around the USA and the Western world, the task is daunting, be up to it, there are millions supporting you everywhere in the world
Just acknowledging the possibility of being prosecuted is an admission by Giuliani they are losing badly. Cheer up Rudy, maybe Biden's AG will make you a deal.

I just heard Biden's introduction of her and you are completely wrong.  Also, Tucker was doing it purposefully because he's a Nazi. Any instance of Biden doing it is just his senility and general inability to speak clearly.

Yes, Trump is vastly worse than Biden but Biden is running to the right of Hillary and has enlisted as his VP someone who has imprisoned people for small amounts of weed, kept prisoners beyond their sentences for cheap labor, fought exoneration of a clearly innocent person, etc.
This interaction is instructive. Biden is the king of shout downs. When these fascists are caught in a lie, they shout down any opposition. They use their presumed authority to get away with it!
If he stole my idea, so be it.  I really don't care how anyone reached the correct conclusion, only that they do.  We'll see if Democrats end efforts to defund (or as Biden calls it, "reallocate funds") the police and get them the training they need.  Not holding my breath.
I‚Äôm voting For Biden cuz I do believe in harm-reduction and with the right pressure Harris can facilitate SOME real progress, but I‚Äôm super critical because I know a lot of people like me won‚Äôt be voting and I‚Äôm beyond terrified that dems are gonna lose again. It‚Äôs too close

Joe Biden has been in politics for 47 years. If you think that he's going to be a positive change in 2021 than you are sadly mistaken.   Joe Biden has gotten wealthy as a career politician. If he wanted to help the country he should have done it the last 47 years.
Joe Biden, like most of his fellow Democrats, have NO respect for his constituents and voters at large, so lying to those that take them at their word and never question or verify what they are claiming, comes naturally.  Considering they keep getting elected, I understand why.
Reality is setting in that there is a high probability that Joe Biden will not finish his first term and that an unqualified Kamala Harris would become the 47th President, much like Sarah Palin in 2008.  President Kamala Harris...I don't think so.
Kamala and Biden as far left?  Is anyone buying that? I mean probably, but were those people voting for any Democrat anyhow?
I wonder - what percentage of people who are planning to vote for Joe Biden are doing so for the simple reason that they know he cannot possibly finish out a four year term ?
Kamala Harris stands on the shoulders of giants in the Democratic Party who broke down barriers ‚Äî the congresswomen Shirley Chisholm and Barbara Jordan and political operatives like Donna Brazile and Mignon Moore.

As to the Biden and Harris speeches today, let‚Äôs also add empathy, honesty and an absence of lies. None of these should be remarkable, but with Trump as President, they are.
God forbid but even if Biden dropped dead right now, with her AG experience, her Senate experience and her presidential campaign experience she's ready!!!!!!!!
The OP makes it sound like Biden is some sort of badass.   Maybe I misunderstood your tweet. This "it was always about the courts" is nonsense. If that were true, the Dems should've brought someone electable. Overestimate Biden at your own peril.
Are you high? Dude, they‚Äôre further to the right than George W. Bush. Biden voted for Iraq. Both of them love to throw and keep minorities in prison for stupid reasons. They love the banks like you do. It‚Äôs a match made in heaven.  Just trust me on this.

I'm as suburban as they get. Kamala doesn't scare me. I find her uplifting. I am happy and comforted with her as Biden's VP pick.   Now, if I were a criminal, or a racist twat, I guess she'd scare me. Can't even wrap my head around that kind of thinking. So strange.

I watched Joe Biden today. He gave a great speech.He was concise, clear and focused. So refreshing to hear a leader with an adult vocabulary and one with aspirations for a better America for all of us.
YES VERY BIDEN/HARRIS LET‚ÄôS GO!!
He is a racist and loves racists supporting him. No amount of your failure of a lifetime of trying to refute that will ever convince anyone with a functioning cerebral cortex. When Biden kicks his ass off the electoral map he'll rename your home Jomaha and outlaw ethanol subsidy
It's just so obvious how big of opportunists Harris and Biden are. They ascended the political landscape so well because they're good at schmoozing rich people/big businesses/law enforcement. The American people deserve better.
It's wild how Conservative media &amp; Trump really try to categorize Joe Biden as the "radical left"

He chose a qualified woman. He didn‚Äôt pick someone that was loyal to him. Credentials mattered. Biden chose someone that was critical of him. Seems like a smart choice to me.

I'd have to say that I believe this guy is right. Biden never had any core principles so it's impossible for him to "sell out" when his entire guiding philosophy has always been to only ever serve the donors. Sell outs once had ethics that are compromised. Joe never had them.

Stop equating conservative and racist, this narrative is ridiculous. Trump won an award from the NAACP because he pioneered racial parity in the golfing community. Trump sued the government to make it happen lmao. Meanwhile Biden was riding shotgun with a KKK grand dragon.

? Not sure k agree or disagree but can if biden wins you can cover the higher taxes
btw, I'm voting for Biden because Trump is a neofascist and is actively trying to remove the tools of democracy. To me, he is a stop-gap president that we will challenge and challenge hard in four years. I wish everyone voted for Biden but they have a right to their vote.

The whole point of the argument "black people voted for Biden" argument is to literally tokenize black people and monothing the group. I'm telling you that you can disable the argument by exactly suggesting that black people, based on age and voting patterns, are not monolithic.
Trump is going to destroy Biden/Harris. He really knows how to speak to the people. Even dumbbells should be able to understand this. Then again, there's the MSM aka. DNC operatives.
Doesn't change my point. Biden is a sexual qssaulter, hair sniffer, nonconsual kisser and toucher. He IS the Patriarchy.
Do you think we have a shot at a fair enough election to get Biden in? Because I'm starting to lose faith, Ming.
Very True. That includes authors of the op-ed ‚Äúendorsing‚Äù Elizabeth Warren to be Biden‚Äôs VP. I wonder how did that work out? Obviously, it didn‚Äôt. Not at all.
Klobuchar polling at 5% &amp; Buttigieg polling above that, that alone provides the 10% margin which Biden used to win in numerous states during Super Tuesday. Add on to the fact that Warren remained in the race pulling votes from Sanders. The strategy against Sanders was clear.
Compassion? Lol. Joe Biden literally said "Lock the SOBs up" while arguing for the crime bill.
Oh, poor delusional child. Don't be projecting on me. You're being manufactured to consent, you're the one voting for Biden.
Post it directly to Biden and thank you for bringing a voice to this murderous practice.
Biden has zero political argument if Trump took a time to resonate with people  on this issue.He knows he can't go with depth in this issue,so why not navigate as his opponents are doing? They know he can't hit em  back on this given his position,yet Trump can elaborate on masks
If Rubio and Kasich had done for Cruz in 2016 what Buttigieg and Klobuchar did for Biden in 2020, we wouldn‚Äôt have Trump.
Right, like when they fought tooth and nail for Bernie and did everything to destroy Jewish Biden.
Yes. Joe Biden has been accused of inappropriately touching 8 women and sexual assaulting one of them. Patriarchy is running a predator as our nominee.

I definitely agree on the first count, and this may be naive of me but I don't think at this moment people will check out even if Biden is in--things are too bad. I also don't believe the Democratic Party would learn a lesson if he lost, they will never learn and they don't care
I remember .... and I remember Demsr and Repubs uniting with Ukr's worst neonazis to start the coup that killed over 50,000 innocent human beings and pple profited from that including Biden's son

Last week Biden posted a lie about Trump (regarding ‚Äúfine people‚Äù) but it is not flagged; neither was a tweet by Iran‚Äôs leader threatening the use force on the US. But Twitter did flag Trump tweets about issues with mail-in ballots and that he will use force against rioters.
Anyway, the only things that is different between Donald and Biden is that Donald is more preferred by the oil companies and Biden is preferred by Silicone Valley. Military contractors and etc would be fine with either. The would still get billions, as show by Democratic Congress
Oh, I encourage it. If you think that Biden can beat him, you‚Äôre smoking crack.

Haha. Can‚Äôt make this stuff up. So the people that are supposed to deliver  the ballots, support Biden? Unbelievable
Um, hearing Joe Biden say the words "I badly need you", is just, well, a little unsettling....
i can see your point but idk if I agree. I've thought a lot about it and I think it isn't an Obama situation where people will go back to sleep.  A lot has happened in the past 5 years. In some ways I think it could be easier to mobilize the left under Biden.

this is one of the better biden takes i‚Äôve seen
This is evident by the fact that despite all major moderates withdrawing, states such as Colorado, Minnesota, Massachussets, Texas and Maine saw Biden only beat Sanders by less than a 10% margin. That is DESPITE the entire moderate and centrist vote going to Biden.
The Democratic Party had to coalesce around Biden before Super Tuesday or else the moderate vote would have been split to such a degree that Sanders would have received wins in numerous states.

Because Bowman wants universal healthcare. He ran on that. And you want to lie to yourself and say Bowman aligns with Biden just because he supports Biden over Trump, that doesn't mean they are politically aligned. Which is obvious if you did a bit of critical thinking.

Did he say he was gonna vote for Biden ???
Romney doesn't have to switch parties. He just should announce he's voting for Biden to protest what Trump has done to his Republican Party...
Biden &amp; Kamala or is it Kamala &amp; Biden?  What are they for?  Open borders  Medicare for all  criminals before law abiding citizens  Actually let Biden's own words do the talking  Kamala too
Case for the emotional candidate story:
A sober look at the reality, without emotions about Trump getting in the way, reveals that a Biden administration is far worse for the world.
She should tell Biden that...
It's a new class of bot. Older accounts are hacked and all their tweets are wiped. Then suddenly they got on a tweeting spree pushing propaganda. So you've got grandmamagee from 2008 with 159 tweets suddenly posting Biden is satan.
You should be focusing on getting Biden to throw in some Funky Winkerbean references as Rust Belt outreach.
No I do not hope he beats Trump and here's why. Biden wants a coup in Venezuela, Trump wants to recognize Maduro and dump Guiado. Biden wants to continue the Afghanistan war, Trump wants to end it. I won't support either of them, but Trump is definitely the 'lesser evil'
Nope. I think a Biden administration is worse for the world.

Nowhere in Biden‚Äôs agenda, or on its website, does the campaign mention one of the biggest promises it made during the primary: a 100-day moratorium on any deportations of immigrants already in the United States.

They need me to use the power of inherent contempt and start arresting these people.  Literally the future of the country is at stake.  When Biden wins the election there needs to be a commission to go after every one of these criminals and lock them away.
I actually read something that gave me pause and got me thinking about the subject a bit harder  - but I would have still had a rebuttal to the person since I didn‚Äôt go up for Kamala nor Biden in the primaries but my rebuttal would be more a personal theory with evidence
That‚Äôs exactly what they want. They want Biden to lose so they can spend the next 4 yrs how they spent the last 3.5. Saying Sanders would have won, Spew establishment bs, saying they were right when in truth they were actively undermining Biden. They don‚Äôt give a crap

Hillary Clinton carried Oregon by 11 points in 2016 (and the GOP hasn't won there since 1984). But the continued menance of the violent Left will give Trump a chance to narrow that gap. Biden will almost certainly win the state, but by a less impressive margin. #PortlandRiots
voted for the war in Iraq. Biden supported the war in Libya. Obama &amp; Biden didn't end the wars in Iraq &amp; Afghanistan, they started two new ones in Syria &amp; Libya. Their failed policies led to the emergence of ISIL &amp; the instability across the ME.
This is TRULY eye opening. If your vote did not matter, this would not be occurring. They do not bb want Biden and Kamala in office. Trump is committing a crime in plain sight.

Our infrastructure is collapsing. The Biden administration might be the last chance to save America before it's too late. It's time to build, not to fuck around.
I actually agree w/ this. A Biden admin will likely acquiesce to the excesses of the left-identitarians and enshrine much of their demands in law, regulation, and practice. But a fact-based right-of-center mvt. able to fight this requires the total destruction of the present GOP.
They‚Äôre on a budget. Have you donated generously to Biden‚Äôs campaign?
I don't agree. Have faith in Biden. The debates are an important part of the process, and we need to uphold the process. We need to make an example of him. And don't forget, we get to see Kamala make mincemeat of Pence.

I would guess 99% of the rioters are not voting or voting for Biden.
I don't agree with the all in person voting, but Trump has a serious history of political interference in many institutions. Biden doesn't. Trump admitted his intentions with USPS funding were to prevent mail in voting. We see his actions. Biden has done nothing of the sort.

Yet biden doesn't mention China... He does say 'trade', then he does the green new deal thing. Coal is cheaper. India needs nuclear

Biden wants the tax cuts to billionaires repealed, to spend on infrastructure, pro green technologies and energy spending. He‚Äôll actually lead on the Coronavirus issue. Do you get everything you want? No, of course not. The people promising you everything are unbelievable.

Nominating Biden was irresponsible and unpatriotic. I did whatever I could to prevent that from happening. Anything that happens as a result of his nomination is YOUR fault, not mine. Put your big boy pants on and accept responsibility for your actions.

Re: Biden having won the primaries by being Obama's VP, I really think people don't talk enough about how destructive his prestige has been  Like, he's probably the only reason Rahm Emanuel was ever mayor of Chicago and that, I think, did not work out great for Chicago

Ha! Biden looks quite youthful doesn't he?  I think Trump is just old and in poor shape. I see 70 yr olds moving that way, especially when they're overweight.  What he has wrong with him has more to do with who he is as a person than how he moves down a ramp. #VoteHimOut

Electing Biden/Harris will not be a repudiation of white supremacy. It will be a small, necessary step away from white supremacy.
WHAT? Trump has a TON of baggage now, so your statement makes zero sense. You clearly underestimate how much hatred has grown for Trump over the last 4 years.   And The DNC didn‚Äôt nominate JOE, African American voters did.
If you are impressed by President Obama's record,why not 4 years of Biden/Harris?
A landslide victory for Biden will take the wind out of trump saying fake election. Then my guess is he will make a deal to resign if pardoned by Pence. Also, make a deal with NY for no jail time.
I'm more worried about the Dems who stole the last two primaries stealing the GE for Biden and his war criminal supporters like Bolton and Bush and Ann Coulter and Romney all of whom are backing Joe which should terrify progressives.
Regardless, they won‚Äôt win and as it stands those lost votes for Biden only support Trump. It‚Äôs so far from an ideal situation but it‚Äôs naive to believe that a third party would win this year so let‚Äôs vote for the better option of two evils

There‚Äôs no schtick. I‚Äôve actually read up on Biden‚Äôs proposed policies and a lot of them are very good and they‚Äôre a hell of a lot more progressive than anything Trump would do with a 2nd term. You can read up on them here :
Yes, it's a fact that countries that did what Biden proposed in January have defeated Covid. We know what works, but Trump and the Republicans still refuse to act.
Not to mention that the Biden/Harris "Green New Deal" will be nothing but, a couple Trillion dollars created and given to their cronies in Corp America. The imbalances of wealth and ownership will only increase.
True, but Biden wants taxpayers to pay for it. That goes against Psalm 94 specifically, thus putting the blood of innocents on all of us. As a Christian, I cannot support that. I probably won't vote, as much as it galls me.

This is all part of his dog &amp; pony show so he can claim voter fraud when the results give the election to Biden.  This slime ball is going to try to hold on with both of his tiny hands!
Technically speaking every single thing people do every single second changes the future. Positive. Negative. Nothing at all. And you are right. If Biden wins and surrenders to China, you better invest in some Rosetta Stone in mandarin.
hard. if biden wins all the privileged liberals will put on their blinders, gives a go ahead to the dems to run increasingly shitty candidates for the next 20+ years. If trump wins, some marginal benefits (supreme court, 15$ min wage, some gnd stuff) are out the window
Reality: Look at what San Francisco is known for today:  ‚Ä¢ Sky-high prestige ‚Ä¢ Sanctuary city ‚Ä¢ Sidewalks people are proud to walk on  This is what Biden &amp; Harris want for all of America.  That terrifies the #CorruptGOP!

I think what the political folks are trying to say is why would you spend money on Trump voters if you‚Äôre, say, Joe Biden. It‚Äôs a waste of scarce resources. And this is a base election. The Trump supporters aren‚Äôt changing their minds. Drive your supporters out and target indys.

You‚Äôre blaming citizens for the lack of Joe Biden appeal.
How you advanced your career by sleeping with a 70 year old man, how you put more black people in jail besides your dementia ridden counterpart Biden.  How you withheld evidence that could free a black man on death row so your record as attorney would get another conviction?
I really hate to say this, but I think Biden has sealed his fate with selecting Harris as VP and will lose. I am very pessimistic and I have to steel my nerves. The Dem establishment just made the same mistake as in 2016, and the convention shows they are rubbing it in our faces
Biden's biggest issue is not getting Trumpies to change their minds (they're long gone) but getting the far left to come to terms with him so they don't stay home in November.  So this is extremely helpful on her part.

I completely understand that. He‚Äôs definitely one of the reasons we‚Äôre in this mess. But again, he‚Äôs not the nominee. So focus on that &amp; focus on making sure Biden wins the presidency. Maybe sanders can bring some of his supporters to vote for Biden. We at least need that.

Or "we'll have a variety of perspectives &amp; experiences, unlike the sycophantic &amp; homogenous Trump WH." But no, just "I landed a punch for the sake of landing a punch" (which was always what that busing attack was about, since Kamala's position isn't far off from Biden's today).
Biden/Pence merely compensated for whatever Obama/Trump lacked. In the former, it was Foreign Policy experience, in the latter, it was the commitment to appoint conservative Justices.  Not sure what Kamala compensates for, except being ready when Biden decides to retire...

This isn't her official vote, this is her vote as a delegate at the DNC. Voting at the DNC doesn't do anything since Biden has already been declared the nominee, it's just a symbolic show of support for Bernie's policies. In the general election she will likely vote for Biden.
Now it's being said they won't even pursue a public option year one. Biden camp refuses to comment on report. Pushing left? Hillary wanted to lower Medicare eligibility to 55, Biden only agreed to 60, which is now in platform. They're actually going right.
