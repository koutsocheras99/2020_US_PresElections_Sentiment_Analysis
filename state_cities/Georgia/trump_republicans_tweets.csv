Wow. Another poor brainwashed trump supporter!
oh I bet she is! P. Trump has cut off all their normal channels of communication, he's even on to their video game chats! Good catch! They look way too happy to see one another!
So he’s one urge up on Trump then.

Trump has restored our Economy. As someone who isn’t even a Trump supporter even, I can recognize that. You can not blame Trump for the devastation COVID has inflicted. That’s absolutely bizarre. Research the Economy before COVID 19. That success was Due to Trump!
There is no messaging capable of covering up the fact that Trump is the candidate.
Accurate picture of Trump’s mental state.
After 150.000 dead, the economy tanked, and trump talks of postponing the election? And you think he's gonna win? 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Trump knows he can’t move the election. He just wanted to distract you from the WORST economic quarter in US HISTORY!!! #TrumpFailedAmerica #ETTD
Kerry Washington highlights real-life ‘superheroes’ in documentary ‘The Fight’ about ACLU lawyers during Trump’s presidency
Did President Obama say something that wasn’t true? If a Democrat President was doing what Trump is doing I would think the republicans would call him/her out on it, this was a perfect time knowing what Congressman John Lewis stood for.
Did he not see Trump’s “address” in Mt. Rushmore? THAT was a political rally.
Good God how much older is Barack than Trump? He looks 110! Stress maybe, now that is so called legacy is in tatters? Not to mention the guy who he’s floating is not all there, poor guy.
This description reminds me of everyone treating the Trump presidency as “business as normal.”
Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That’s Unconstitutional.  I kinda like the idea of President Pelosi, as pointed out by a co-founder of the Federalist Society.  and  must leave in Jan 2021.  is next in line if vacant.

WHY can't the press ask better questions of tRump?
Trump-backed postmaster general plans to slow mail delivery  Critics of the changes say they dont see how minimizing mail delivery efforts will lead to an increase in revenue.
Damn! tRump said nothing! And the press corps asked 0 worth of questions.
Most presidents will actually develop the concept of the law themselves then send it to congress.  But that would require trump to care have at least some understanding of the problems some understanding of the law have a brain be able to think like an adult or even a human...
You had 4 years to maga. Instead you golfed, slept on a pandemic, and divided an ailing country.  It’s time to pack it up, saddle bags. Maybe try Trump University II instead?
Literally every time Trump speaks. Seriously- just pick a presser. How about the one where he suggested ingesting bleach?  Or when he wished G. Maxwell well.
I’d like to think that if my party ever elected someone as dangerous to democracy as Trump is that I would be as principled as #NeverTrumpers.
Exactly zero chance he will ever comment on Trump’s assertion that this election will be the most inaccurate and fraudulent election in history.
Why are Mnuchin and Meadows involved at all? This is a Senate bill, not a WH bill. MM's previous excuse that they should allow input from Trump since he could just veto it doesn't hold in this case. It's an election year, he can't veto it and win. Pelosi should be all over this.
Sadly, I agree. We actually started out with a unified shut down, but as soon as Trump and unpatriotic, lunatic fringe organizations like Tea Party Patriots made it look like we had to choose between the economy and health, the unification fell apart. This is their civil war.
Not me!  Trump landslide coming!!!
Nothing like an Obama speech to remind everyone why they voted for Trump in the first place!!!
We are so close to getting some peace and quiet in this country. No more of Trump’s chaos all of the time!
The fact that pompeo KNOWS the answer but yet choses to defend trump, says it all. He has to GO
In ally 60 plus years, I have never disliked anyone more than trump
So how do you know he caught it at Trump's rally?
Ummm... Start with video of his inauguration &amp; the Unregistered Russian Agent to his right on the phone to his contacts in Russia  Continue to videos of Trump firing members of the USIC investigating him, illegal payoffs to porn stars, emoluments violations, etc... that’s year 1
Haha dream on....!  Trump 2020...🇺🇸
He chose to go in to a crowded enclosed space during a global pandemic and not wear a mask to please Donald Trump. And now he’s dead. What a dumb hill to die on. He was an idiot but maybe his stupidity will awaken others to do the simple and right thing. #WearADamnMask
#WeWillVote We will not let trump take one more step forward. The line has been drawn!
somebody (i think it was a congressmen) was supposed to take a trip w trump but then he caught covid and now he isn’t going. i think he should still go..
The other side shoots innocent protestors but will guard and protect with their lives people with nazi flags, confederate flags and trump flags.
Daddy Trump? 😂
Trump warns of massive voter fraud, questions whether election should be delayed
He was a great civil rights leader, but I can’t forget he refused to attend Pres Trump’s inauguration and State of the Union address.
My concern is a U.S. vaccine that Trump or his minions have an interest in will get accelerated approval from the FDA (prior to election), even though it may not be fully vetted or ultimately as effective. If Oxford/AstraZeneca, etc, etc, are more effective...more deaths.
Not sure these are different
No, Trump can’t delay the election  via
Where does Joe Biden go for apologies from Ari Fleischer and Jonathan Turley? Both publicly sneered whe Joe predicted that trump would try to delay the election.
Mexico is generally pretty friendly to Americans wanting to live there. Or they were before trump.  Israel has to take me, but I'd rather live in Mexico.
Donald Trump suggests delay to 2020 US presidential election
Trump, for all his bluster, is a coward. He doesn’t even fire people directly, he gets others to do it for him. If he loses, he will talk a big game and then take one last ride in Air Force one down to mar-a-lago to lick his wounded ego.

Copy editors of the world, don't fall into the "experts say" trap when writing headlines about the possibility of Trump delaying the election. It's not a matter of debate or opinion. He lacks the authority. Period.
Cain attended President Donald Trump's June 20 rally in Tulsa, where he tweeted a photo of himself surrounded by people not wearing masks.
Trump never spouted injecting one self with bleach. Never happened. Uninformed people keep parroting that line.
"We have 0 say".. hm. I dont give a shit about Trump. They're all playing some twisted money moving game that I have no part in. I dont give a shit whos in office lol. I dont live off the government, nor do I need their help. Again, you can talk all the shit youd like, sport.
Trump wants to get in front of cameras because Obama is about to be in front of the camera. You can’t make this stuff up.
Trump hasn't "sought" anything. He made a suggestion. And none of your aforementioned presidents had to deal with people on the other side of the aisle who would blatantly cheat to steal an election. And BTW, you're a POS traitor to the Republican party.

Trump did the smartest thing he’s ever done in his whole “presidency” and that was not showing up to John Lewis memorial service
Keep the faith, Trump is preparing the cure for ALL to see, keep fighting. Hear it here in the X-22 Report
It's just a distraction. For TRUMP to take away ANY moment from congressman Lewis funeral . trump has to be the ONLY one talked about, according to him
I’m glad Trump isn’t there. He is antithetical to everything John Lewis stood for.
So here are the alternatives- 1- don’t vote.  2- throw away your vote on an independent candidate.  3- vote for Trump.  The choice is your’s.
Funny you say supporter. I’m not a Trump supporter but I’m also not oblivious to the prosperity president Trump has bought to America.
It’s definitely something else. Trump was right. Nobody likes him.
the only correct answer is B only communist and trump supporters would choose anything else
They said he was at that Tulsa Trump rally
You’d be surprised. I have a friend who is black, gay, and married. Supports Trump unconditionally. I don’t get it.
Herman Cain, former Republican presidential candidate and former CEO of a major pizza chain who went on to become an ardent supporter of President Donald Trump, has died of complications from the coronavirus. He was 74.
I never said that. And neither is anyone else. Except extremists. Why would Trump involve CDC and Birka and have press conferences if he thought it was a hoax. You’re thinking in a little box.
Yes, when are you going to ask Trump to resign like you asked Bill Clinton too?
So, Herman Cain likely died because Trump wanted to feel better about himself.
I see the bushes in the Rose Garden have grown immense with the constant spew of fertilizer from the mouth of Donald J Trump
I don't want to belabor the point, but no one, man or woman, Republican or Democrat, should have voted to confirm him. He was obviously picked because he lobbied for the position by appealing to Trump's base instincts. No one should want that brand of person on SCOTUS.
RIP, Herman Cain.  This tragedy could likely have been avoided. Wonder if he signed the Trump's campaign waiver.
Has nothing to do with Trump. Call out the daily and nightly protestors why don’t you.
There's no evidence that he contracted COVID at a Trump rally. The CNN article you link to says it's unknown where he contracted the virus. Stop lying.
I wonder if Herman Cain wore a mask would he still be alive? I’m pretty sure listening to Trump is bad for your health.
...and planting seeds for his base to grow. For some reason, every time Trump does this, media people rush to fertilize it.
I wonder will Trump pay his respects for Cain 🤔
Trump will win in a landslide!!!
Put Obama in place of Trump...and then how would we conservatives feel?
Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so         This reminds me Turkey!
so in case you’re unaware, Trump is allowing schools to re open but won’t let people go out and vote him out of office... pls take me out of here
Sadly conservatives/libertarians fail to see that trump is the logical end to their morally and intellectually bankrupt philosophy... so they will continue to support him or at least their philosophy to the detriment of us all... binary thinking kills

President Donald Trump explicitly floated delaying November's presidential election on Thursday, lending extraordinary voice to persistent concerns that he would seek to circumvent voting in a contest where he currently trails his opponent by double digits

How many could've been saved with Hydroxychloroquine? Dems are lying to America in an effort to hurt Trump and in the meantime people are dying.
Do you not remember trump changing the laws about media companies being responsible for user content?   Facebook can be sued if people follow bad advice and die now.  This is a direct result.
Here’s a question, Trump maybe signing off to reduce our military in Germany, but such a withdrawal doesn’t happen immediately, it takes years... couldn’t a President Biden undo and reverse a morons capitulation to Putin?

You’re in for a big disappointment. You backed a loser, a scammer, a cruel, dishonest racist fraud who was protected by daddy all of his life. After all of his failures, he moved on to con you. We’re now living with consequences of Trump’s incompetence, until January at least.
totally with you!  they can't control us with the drug, but they can with a vaccine, esp. if they put a microscopic chip in the vaccine. Plenty of garbage goes in those vaccines. Plus,it's all about undermining P.Trump!

I highly doubt that fake accounts with one follower could understand NATO spending, but Trump supporters don’t either. None of the NATO alliance countries give money to NATO. Trump acts like we write a check to them and that Germany’s check wasn’t big enough. 🤦🏼‍♀️
I agree Trump is quite often held at a much higher expectation. Contrary to popular belief he’s actually quite intelligent. And yes I should be less sensitive. I appreciate you being so respectful.
I’m curious as to what research you’ve done. You’ve claimed that Trump is racist but haven’t provided any sources or evidence.
Trump says what he thinks. It's the smart move for him. If he says nothing they can't really attack him.
Trump is the ONLY person that can turn the economy around.  It’s happening now with record job growth occurring.
It's not that they are overwhelmed. They are under a stand down order by the politicians. Until that gets lifted, the city doesn't stand a chance. Politicians are hoping Trump gets defeated, because they have to know he isn't going to send them any money. Biden will.
How did stupid people like him and trump grow up to think they are so smart? Defies logic. #TrumpFailedAmerica

As much as I hate Trump, it’s fake. Don’t give him any air to cry fake news.

It's a package deal...given his lack of intelligence in all matters, the bad actor, fringe types he has chosen to surround himself with are doing a lot of string pulling behind the scenes and deserve as much scrutiny...e.g. Navarro, Miller, Giuliani, anyone else named Trump, etc.

Follow the money, im telling you trump and assoc have money invested in this drug
Most of the people at that rally had masks. Statistics showed no spike directly related to the Trump rally.  The liberal cities may not be sending formal invitations, but they certainly aren't doing anything to stop, or even slow them down.
Can you imagine what it would be like if the media didn’t bash President Trump 24/7/365 for FOUR YEARS?  Not to mention pushing the Russian Collusion hoax for years!  Amazes me many don’t question being lied to for years!
Y’all don’t find it weird that trump endorsed her knowing that someone died from using hydroxychloroquine and she’s the ONLY “medical professional” that’s says it “works”.  None of this is adding up or making sense at all.
Interesting what a trump endorsement will do to you. She’s spreading false information before she got endorsed by trump this is what she was posting. Telling us to wear a mask and wash our hands.
He blocked me at some point and I was never even rude to him, I only pointed out that what he was doing, only benefits Trump and to tamp it down... also he didn’t even allow Warren to drop out before jumping ship... dude is seriously inbalanced.
if Biden wins, can he declassify and make the Putin- trump calls public?
I didn’t vote for Trump. We’re talking about Barr.
Trump rallies stopped after isolations began. Protests and riots were much bigger crowds, and ran consecutively for two months and counting, all in liberal run cities.
There was a hospital ship that could hold 1000 plus patients and a tent hospital in Central Park. Neither was used. The Chinese New Year was in February, and the parade was in March. Trump shut down travel from China in January.  Protests in Liberal cities for 2 months.
It’s really sad that it’s going to take someone of high profile w/in the anti-mask wing of the  to die from this before people finally start taking this seriously. None of this makes any sense. Had Trump handled this well, it could have breezed him through re-election!

The party without Trump has zero guts. Less than zero. Almost comical how weak these aholes are.
I honestly can't understand it, other than their hate for Trump is so strong they'd rather have anyone, and I mean ANYONE, else in office.
Hey Eric, I hear there is a great platform to spread BS lies and generate more conspiracies openly and freely, Parlor!   Why hang around a platform like Twitter that denies you such a latitude to be the natural grifting cons that is a hallmark of the Trump credo?
Donald Trump isn't the one who sent infected people into nursing homes.  He's not the one who said we should celebrate Chinese New Year in Chinatown, or attend the St. Patrick's Day parade. Those were Democrats!
Trump's involvement has really tainted our understanding of what went wrong with the league. Now, he wasn't a positive force, but the reality of what went down is more complex. It should have succeeded, but was doomed before Trump walked through the door.
Trying to take blame off Trump and the GOP by claiming Fauci opposed the "cure."
It is possible that Trump is an incompetent asshole AND for hydroxychloroquine to be an effective drug. Don't be as dumb as Trump. The science is complicated. Take Trump out of the picture and try to be objective about the science.

If Biden is elected people will begin to see how oblivious he is. Biden has policies that conflict with Trumps and how is that good. People can may claims about Trump but they cannot deny facts. He’s created more jobs for America. He made our economy golden. What will Biden do?Good effort Chris-I would honestly like to know if he believes all that or just covering for Trump.
That’s good to know. Many of us hang our heads in shame over how Trump has “conducted business.” Ok everyone, it is July 30th, what #GoodTrouble can we get into?
In a recent article, he explained why he thinks it’s essential that Trump win the next election, and questioned the salvation of “woke” evangelicals.
Biden has been a politician for how many years? But all the United States problems are because of Trump now? It’s ridiculous. He was in a lose-lose with the Coronavirus. And please tell me you think Biden is of the right mind to be president? Can the Democrats not find better?
And they sensor all of us that dare to be Trump supporters!

Probably not.  I’m starting to think this is all a hoax like Russia gate!!  I believe there is a Coronavirus but I also believe there is a flu every year.  I have a feeling after the election and Donald Trump is re-elected the media will turn its corrupt sights on something else!
All the MSM called Trump a lier about spying but looks like he was right so Twitter needs to let people say what they want. It’s should not up to them to fact check anyone.
Herman Cain died of complications from Covid. The news media want you to believe that he contracted the disease at the Trump Tulsa rally, however, it is UNKNOWN where he contracted it...the MSM are so dishonest...
Yes! I found this info a year or so ago because it bothered me that I couldn’t wrap my head around why and how people now to Trump. Thing that it hardest for me is how anyone speaks against the leader, and they are “re-educated.”
Rape is not okay, at all.  There's 0 to suggest Trump is guilty in any of those (quickly dismissed) accusations.  May be hard to accept but, it is possible for women to lie about sexual acts to push the narrative of "Orange man bad".
... Big pharmaceutical dismissal and banning of a proven COVID preventative and treatment simply because Trump endorsed it, Twitter and FB censorship/banning of conservative and Q accounts, the documented coup discussions between FBI officials- off the top of my head.
More evidence that  is out of his depth and unfit for his office.  via

Friends? Epstein was banned from Trumo properties and Trump was then the only person to help the FBI make a case against Epstein.  Also, he suggested to Barr to reopen the Epstein investigation...
I was ok with him till he voted against Kavanaugh.  You and I both know that miss Ford was full of crap.  The voted to impeach Trump.  If you like trump or hate trump he shouldn’t have been impeached for some made up BS.
I’m still not a fan, but he does look better in light of Trump. I think Obama’s shenanigans broke the GOP and drove it crazy.   Plus, a lot of Trump’s ideas came from Obama. He’s responsible for at least some of this mess.
I am voting for President Trump. According to Biden, I ain’t black
I suppose so. And maybe just a bit better. I still don’t like having to vote for joe, but he’s leagues better than trump.

RUSH: I'm not sharing this with you to frustrate you, folks. I think that the point here is once again the Democrats are not confident that they're gonna win this.
So you think that just because trump did 1 thing, he handled this properly?
If trump dies, then pence runs. That’s how it’s always worked. Do you not know this?
Yeah, but from where I’m standing, I don’t really see that happening. There’s a difference in pointing out joe’s flaws, and attacking him and putting up there with trump. I don’t think they’re being equated, and if they are, it’s on the sexual assaulter level.
I feel like “attacking Biden” is a stretch. If you’re a white leftist, odds are you’re not suprised by this stuff from trump and you gave up hope a year or two ago on him. Just gotta get him out.
That’s awesome!!! 🤔 hmmmm who’s up next? Barr? The trump thing/it?

This is the contrast- some of "us" thinks veil anger and hate and use Trump/Q as a shield or rally call for those negative agendas and do not represent the core message of this movement.
Cain had been traveling all over the US before the Trump rally. Dont even try to assume you know how or where he got it.

Small things lead to big things look at subsidies they started out relatively small and they’ve continued to grow and grow now we’re giving out trillions of dollars in one bill if you allow a leak then you should expect a flood and Trump allowed a leak

Jimmy 'better' Christian than trump. Trump 'better' president.
Hey Bean, have you yourself checked out. I doubt a guy who just got promoted didn’t do it because of Trump. I’m a minority and guess what,  I reaped what I sowed. I kicked ass for 44 years for government and got treated like a king. I didn’t kiss anybody’s ass to get where I got.
Wow. Your hate for him really shows. But thats ok. I guess if democrats make stupid remarks they dont get the same treatment as Trump just because you hate him. You can not see that Democrats have just as many issues with the truth. Stay blind my friend.
Donald Trump has said, “I don’t kid.” This includes joking I am sure. If the President says something I believe he means it.
Mr Trump. Will they read 1 Corinthians 13 at your funeral? Will you be remembered as loving and kind as the late John Lewis is? And will prior Presidents speak words of paise for your service?
Because I like keeping people honest, I just want to remind you all that the people calling Herman Cain a "Trump victim" are the same ones claiming covid doesn't spread at "certain" protests. 💯
you are absolutely right that Trump is using Russian talking points but it is true that the US supplied Taliban with (weapons) stinger missiles in Afghanistan to defeat the Soviet Union. The point is that Trump defends Putin at every turn. Inconceivable...
I love that President Pelosi is trending. Those veins in Trump's neck must be working triple time. 😠😡🤯💀  🙃😆
“Fascism will come to America wrapped in a flag and carrying a bible “, Mr Frum is correct. Power over country for Trump and his enablers in Congress. It’s knocking on the door now.

Also the trump endorsed demon semon hydroxychloroquine doctor, Barr's hearing, trump admitting to not asking Putin about bounties. Yeaaa... It's been a doozy.
President Trump is just trying to distract them. I believe something big is about to happen. Trump’s tweet are his laser pointer
And just where donyou get your "real" facts? And why were Dems saying theres nothing to worry about go out to the public events that Trump is just racist when he banned flights from China. Cuomo, Pelosi and others did that. There are videos of them stating that
Representative Louis Gohmert (R Texas) tested at The White House yesterday before getting cleared to ride on Air Force One with President Trump to attend the fundraising event in Odessa, Texas. That’s effectively the type of testing that should be available to every American. ...
🦠doesn’t care if your rich. We all know Trump is a fraud. Those “marks” he’s conning for$$$ that will mostly line his own pockets are the real TRUMP CHUMPS. #trumpchumps
I am saying Trump fire Fauci. I don’t think you can count on Trump weighing the fallout from firing Fauci. He is the double down clown.
2. I've notice him doing this before. he lied on congress woman Wilson &amp; others. trump is most racist person I've seen in years.
trump said colin Powell told him that report that Russia was paying to have us soldiers killed. that's not true. a lot of ppl want believe this, but he chose colin Powell because he is black. he thinks by naming this black man what's tthe harm?  that's deep disrespect.
What Trump doesn’t understand is that these groups benefit us by being there ...should have nothing to do with money from Germany
Hey! I understand now. Trump and GOP are aliens themselves. It all makes sense now.
Also, we need to stay alert for this in ourselves. Feel the anxiety rising? Anger? Be aware u may not be taking in all facts, getting us off track-common weapon Trump employs. To break that, pretend u are a scientist and w/o judgement, take note of -Who/what/where/when/why/how.

I wasn’t always like this😂 ... then, trump happened 🤦‍♀️😠 I never thought I would wish Covid on anyone, but trump might be an exception😬He makes me physically, ill! 😷
If Trump can’t divide the country on way, he will try dividing the scientists and doctors. One could equate the present situation comparable to a little war that happened about 1860 or so.
Can anyone name one time when Donald Trump showed leadership since he has been office?

Trump Rips CNN for Asking About Tweet on Controversial Doctor |   via
Again proving my point and I am still laughing. I think Trump is far from anyone that might be sent from God. I however absolutely will not support anyone or any party that doesn't protect Christian values and morals. Now why don't you go read your Bible and get back to me.
Conservatives weren't whining about the EO. It's what he was doing with it. An executive order is a constitutional power given to the president. And SCOTUS protected Obama's DACA order, which just sets a precedent increasing the power of the executive office. Currently: Trump.
Obama imposed regs which affected small businesses that couldn't afford it which eliminated any competition to the major conglomerates. It's almost as if that was the plan. Trump is preventing a monopoly (already illegal) from treating people differently based on political party
And it'll be hard to undo when he's gone. Thanks to recent SCOTUS decision on DACA. They actually increased Trump's power by ruling against him.

The fact that Donald Trump would endorse a dr who practices in a strip mall store front clinic in Houston, tells u that he is unstable, gullible and will believe anything he hears that coincides with his views. Alien sex while someone sleeps? Witches? SMH!
I keep saying Trump is a master chess player.  He’s been in the loop and was being prepared for Presidency for many years.  His strategies may seem awkward to some but the majority of us know he doesn’t make decisions on the fly.  Everything he does is thought out.
Did you watch Biden yesterday when he took 4 questions, had notes, news outlets pre planned and he still screwed up! No way he will face Trump on stage!! Watch and see😡
I was disappointed that Trump said yesterday that we will still be getting drugs from China. We should buy nothing from them! Cheaper and safer for us and would make many jobs in labs across the country!🤔
The damage these toy soldiers of General Trump are really and truly damaging the image of our real soldiers that dawn the uniform everyday. People really believe they are real soldiers not wannabe toy soldiers “playing army” with🤴
As a vet say something about these images of wannabe soldiers deploying around country in full out camo/ military field gear. People watching tv think these are our soldiers. Not General Trump’s toy army soldiers. It’s very bad for the image of our folks proudly wearing uniforms!
Ask Jim about the mystery volume on Kodak day before the big announcement by Trump yesterday. There’s a 🐀 in them buys. Think Trump’s SEC will look at that? Highly doubt that.
Look at Kodak stock volume the day before the big announcement by the Orange King yesterday. I smell Kushner/ Trump cutouts. Around 30-50k shares to over 1.5 million!! Grifters gonna grift. Smell’s like a rat.Think Trump’s SEC will look? No way.
General: Trump’s gestapo toy soldiers clad in camo and full military gear come across as our soldiers to most of the public. Please would you and other respected former leaders speak out. They’re hurting the image of our brave folks in uniform serving us all. Thanks
Thank you for your service sir. And thank you for still serving by speaking out. I wish more of our former military leaders would speak out. This President brings shame to our soldiers everyday playing General Trump with his toy soldiers clad in camo. Folks see our soldiers 😢
And I’m always winning like I’m Donald Trump!
I am more confident now because the media and democrats are fully exposed. My only concern is voter fraud because they have been pushing vote by mail for the past 4 months. I know I will be voting for President Trump and all Republican down the ballot.
The media is 24/7 hate Trump. They are just following the narrative of the Democrats. The fake news media is truly the enemy of the people.
Anyone think trump has invested in hydrochloriquine?
great interview with  for Axios.  can’t wait to watch the whole interview. Trump denies knowing about bounties. Throws shade at China. Talks about nuclear proliferation. Swann sticks to the topic and Trump wiggles like a large mouth bass
why have you not directly asked Trump if he has financial ties to the Med?
Unfortunately so many are brainwashed and fell to the theory that only Trump can fix things, and we all know his promotion of the meds, which by the way, and physician would have lost their license for promoting an unstudied drug for use by all.
Apparently trump and a few others have stock in it. Why has no one asked him if that is true.

President Trump was right again. They need to make it available over the counter. So many lives would have been saved because the media and democrats hate President Trump. They would rather people die than give him credit.

Cavuto and Napiltano are both bought and paid for...the judge is still mad that Trump will not put him on the Supreme Court...
Idk I will have to figure all that out. The Ga primary was a disaster. We had a brand new voting system $105 and they kept breaking down, closed polling places in minority area, and long line. Now Trump put his own person in charge of the post office.
Which will we see at this briefing, Twitter or Teleprompter Trump?  Jekyll or Hyde.
I don’t think they looked very impressive to the American public that watched.  President Trump May have to thank them this fall!!
Well when you look at what democrat voters are saying : not really. They think dems should let Barr talk so he can incriminate himself and /or Trump. They can't fathom that the questioners don't want him going into too much detail. Mainly because it would implicate dems.

Posting studies that favor hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 is like posting polls that favor Trump over Biden. They exist but lack context and don’t show the true status of the situation.
Exactly and it pisses me off. Sometimes it seems like President Trump is on an island by himself except for his supporters. Hopefully it will be a landslide victory with Republicans riding his coattails to victory
For starters y’all can’t tell me that ain’t Donald Trump 😂
Isn’t the purpose of the ENTIRE “oversight” committee to get at the truth to see if someone has abused the office they occupy?  This looks more like a court of law with Prosecutors and Defenders trying the covert actions of Donald Trump and his fixer.
That’s really crappy but I bet your sentiment is shared by so many. I will continue to wear my Trump gear and not afraid to show my support.
tRump is trying to rig enough laws and executive orders to keep himself and his #TrumpCrimeFamily out of jail. That's all.  #TrumpHatesWomen  #VoteRedToKillAmerica #VoteRedToKillDemocracy
To put the GOP recommendation of 1.75 bil for FBI building in perspective, if actually used to help Americans, each man, woman, and child would get $500.  Or we can misuse a relief bill for a pet project Trump is demanding.
I was at the gym earlier and an older Spanish lady approach me. I always wear a MAGA or KAG hat at the gym. She said how much she loves President Trump and was afraid to wear her hat because of people giving her evil looks. This tells me the silent majority is increasing everyday
The media is easily hookwinked! This “change of tone” by trump is ridiculous.
Trump and a few of his officials bought stock in it, then had the US buy up the supplies of it in anticipation.

President Trump was right all along. So many lives would have been saved if the media and Democrats was honest
"Remember when liberals said that Trump would destroy America... as liberals seriously go burn down America..."
Because I can’t vote for Bernie or Elizabeth and have it take down trump.
are you people completely nuts??  Really??  This is more than a “protest”.  It’s a riot. It has nothing to do with Police brutality.  It is an out and out push to try to get Donald Trump out of office. Do you know what the truth is anymore?
It’s because they fear you Mr Trump. All great people are feared because they can’t be stopped. You are doing right by this country.
Brazil's Bolsonaro has been accused at The Hague for  "crimes against humanity" related to his response to Covid-19. Brazil has approximately 80,000 deaths.  USA has almost 150,000. Why hasn't trump been charged? #TrumpDeathToll150K
To all democrats answer me why Biden refuses to have a unscripted interview with Chris Wallace. Trump did and answered some hard questions. Scared your candidate can’t complete a sentence with out screwing up! Anybody want to tell me why.
Isn't this the right thing for him to do? Does anyone want to see him anywhere near John Lewis?   Isn't it better that no part of his passing is made about Trump and whatever awkward thing he would say or do?
I see NO REASON, in any universe, why a VIRTUAL DEBATE would be necessary in Nov.  Remember HILLARY and TRUMP on stage? This time will be TRUMP and BIDEN on stage! Far apart! The people who ask the questions can wear masks if they want to!
Election time is right around the corner and they have to ramp up their anti-Trump rhetoric even more. Opposing view points will not be tolerated by the liberal media.

That's Trump and Kanye ma'am
Why would anyone want to see returns while they were in office? Returns were for years prior to office. Pence turned over 10 returns during campaign. Why didn’t Trump?
But, he always gives it to a govt agency, then promptly sends the receipt to his accountant to claim as a charitable donation on his taxes. He doesn’t turn over returns b/c he doesn’t pay any taxes. Trump doesn’t “give” things away unless it benefits him.
I just realized why Trump always calls MSM polls fake. (I’m a bit slow at times). Aides are giving one set of numbers to satisfy him, and then he sees real poll numbers on TV. Some ppl only believe what they want to hear. I wondered why they never matched.
She has and that is still not enough for them, its really them trying to pull the focus off the horrible shit trump has done to the US not to mention his sexual misconduct.

And tRump does??
If we didn't have cognitive tests, we would never know if trump was of sound mind.
Despite what leftists might say, President Trump deserves partial credit for this. His willingness to ease off of regulations and bring private companies into the force fighting Covid.
The lack of coinage seems to be an effect of the pandemic. Production was slowed in the spring to implement safety measures but is now back to full capacity. The second factor is lack of commerce using cash.  I have a hard time blaming either on Trump.
There are ways to handle violent protesters without invoking Orwellian images. It would be a simple matter to put the LEOs in traditional police riot gear.   Trump did not start the violence but he is throwing fuel on the fire and fanning flames.   We are being played.
Another example is the WAPO article today where NG  commander confirmed that Lafayette Sq. incident was moved up to accentuate Trump's law and order speech.
Paramilitary LEOs in Portland and elsewhere are one example. What could be better to stoke violence among people who fear Trump's US is an authoritarian police state than having anonymous officers in military uniforms grabbing folks off streets and putting them in unmarked cars?
There is more and more evidence that the Trump Administration is playing up and escalating the civil unrest around the country because they think it will help at the polls if voters see the violence as "Biden's America." It's the 2020 version of the migrant caravan.
He must have seen how tough Wallace was with Trump..lol
Yall hate me now.? Wait till Trump win again...lmaooooo i could see it now...”FREESTON YUH MS” “YOU REALLY VOTE FOR THIS MAN.?” Nd i going laugh baaaaaaddddd cuz meen vote for him before nd i aint voting again
As a human being, wishing him a speedy recovery. But honestly, dude in non essential. TRump gets his national security briefings from #FauxNews anyways
President Donald Trump won’t be throwing out the first pitch at Yankee Stadium next month after all.
Ok maybe I suck at math but this seems incredibly inaccurate. Clinton won 2,868,686 more votes than Trump, the above graphic says that was only .1% more eligible voters than Trump. That would mean there are 2,868,686,000 eligible voters.
Simply put Russia facilitated Trump’s election and continues to play a role.
If you have Hulu, you might enjoy watching the 3 part Trump Biography series. Very interesting. And to think this person is the President of the United States.
Ppl only hide things when there is a reason they want them hidden. Trump’s tax returns will eventually come to light just like all of the corrupt things he has done. He may be gone when they do, but they WILL be known. His children may be the ones to suffer.
Wrong!!!  Every POTUS since Gerald Ford in 1976 has willingly turned over their tax returns. Mike Pence tuned over 10, Trump turned over none.
But Trumps doing the same shit Biden would be doing hell Trump enacted more gun control than Obama, has sent more troops overseas than he’s brought back, has continued to send out massive subsidies to big businesses there’s no real difference between them
Burn it down and start over with all you guys , all the Never Trump Republicans as well as the few Republicans left , Powell/ Rice/Kasich/Hogan. Or form a new conservative moderate Party. I don’t know if there’s anything left worth rebuilding in the GOP. Grifters and enablers.
Remember when liberals said that Trump would destroy America... as liberals seriously go burn down America...
"Remember when liberals said that Trump would destroy America... as liberals seriously go burn down America..."
All anyone knows how to do anymore is to blame Trump...there's no journalistic integrity, no thoughtful debate, just "but Trump". Truly sad state of affairs for people who claim to be intellectual
Democrats have made no effort to secure it either. They only sent forward partisan bills that they knew would not pass the Senate to make it look like Trump and the GOP were not taking action. The election bill had it ok to vote at 16. They can not drink or smoke till 21........
has my vote. I was hoping for  to run/be nominated for the Libertarian party again.   Biden needs to retire, he's plagiarized enough already. Trump was "booming" the fiscal deficit prior to covid, yet he's conservative? That dude is a joke.. 👎
I wish every governor that failed to act and trump could be held accountable for the blood on their hands
It's so crazy how these magats block me when I mention trump &amp; child traffickers. Or post my memes about his sexual assaults. It's almost as if they deny the truth?
The likelihood of Trump going scorched earth after the election is yet another reason why he should have never been allowed near the Oval Office in the first place.
I'm definitely going to follow the advice of actual experts when it comes to masks and not some BS you copied and pasted from tRump's tweeter feed
As a  fan I was born to hate the  but how can I hate a team who does something so respectful and pisses off Trump at the same time?
Funds for what? If Trump didn't oppose the riots no one would because Dems and the mayors act like burning and destroying a city is "peaceful" protesting. 😤
This is one of those times when you need to back up what you say with facts. And even if that we true, I'm concerned with the unkind things tRump has done than the things someone has said.  #FactsMatter  #VoteRedToKillAmerica #VoteRedToKillDemocracy
Dang. Can't even manage to build a wall right.   In March 2018, Congress appropriated $1.6 billion out of a $1.3 trillion spending bill towards the border barrier, characterized by Trump as a "down payment" ...
Publicity...wondering will Trump send his “secret police“ to quash these lawless acts that are threatening law and order in Texas 🙄🤔.
Democratic leadership is responsible for this uncontrollable violence!And they are the ones keeping it going. Why?  So people like you and the far left media can spin it to be President Trump's fault, hoping it will hurt him in the 2020 election!  Not gonna work tho!
Lightfoot has been antagonistic towards trump. Trump wants the violence in chicago to stop. Lightfoot does not want trump to overshadow her. That is wrong for the good people living in these areas.
They are too invested in taking President Trump down.  They have to push the narrative that the protestors are mainly and largely peaceful while they burn down those Democrat run cities.

Me...I’m waiting to hear all of the explaining and blubbering that’s going to come after Trump’s defeat. “Oh... I was weak...it was my meds...that’s not really who I am.” Remember ACTIONS speak louder than words...it is what it is 😂😂🙄.

I can't wait to vote for Trump again!

It is not 1st amendment when you bring violence into it. You guys are making a stronger trump reelection.
It's just a ploy to take votes from Biden to help Trump. Smart strategy really
DEAR PRESIDENT TRUMP, PLEASE USE THE WATER CANNONS FOR THESE RIOTS!! THEY ARE EFFECTIVE AND WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THE DESTRUCTION!! KAG🇺🇸🇺🇸
Trump is the status quo he’s a Republican care to explain why you’ll vote for him because if it’s for gun rights and smaller government in general then you’re very mistaken
I am and we will be voting for President Trump. #Trump2020. Vote all democrats out including local, state, and congress.
Why don't you cover what trump accomplished with drug prices. This should be a major WIN.

Where is the rising action in this plot? How many plots are in this story? Is there only one plot with various layers of sub plot? I just realized the double meaning of the word plot in this narrative. Simply Russia facilitated Trump’s run for President &amp; continues I play a role.
The only positive to trump being president is pushing these issues into public and letting people show who they truly are. Be happy to talk more as following your posts and newsletter has educated me quite a bit about things I just simply didn’t know.
Your Dad and Uncles, along with my Father and Uncles, who fought in WWII, would be appalled by what is happening in the USA.  Trump is no fascist but Antifa is  fighting to overthrow the USA.  BLM is a Marxist /Communist organization.
There not gonna share the honey pot . It’s their pot to bleed dry for Trump and his family. How dare they!!!
Mr Nichols: sir do you subscribe to Carville’s theory that Trump will withdraw rather than face a humiliating loss? I just can’t see it. Too much money he can milk on way to and after the election.
School teachers that voted for Donald Trump I hope they realize when they voted for Donald Trump in 2016 knowing of a person he is you just signed your death warrant by going back to school during this pandemic, being way out of control I wonder do they realize that
Either that or rich. Trying to avoid paying taxes that Democrats would impose.   I know a MAGAt who is vehemently still pro Trump. Despite having a blue collar, average paying job, a 1993 pickup, and less than stellar living conditions for a 55 year old man.

TIL Press Secretary Kayleigh Mckenany used to be anti-Trump.  Press called her out and she said it was because she was watching
Trump is not gonna let go of any money. It’s all for he and his family to grift from. Those properties are hemorrhaging cash. Campaign funds are his “honey pocket”.
They were never for diversity or tolerance. They had succeeded in hiding their hate for the American people with the help of the biased media. The media is just an extension of the Democrat party. President Trump exposed them for who they truly are and that’s why they attack him.
None-a President doesn’t waste time like that, but instead leads. Trump has a lot of time on his hands.
Everyone has a right to have and speak their opinions.Having varying points of view makes for a stronger union.We should not expect everyone to think as we do,or disrespect 1 another because they don’t. No 1 should get all of what they want all the time. Someone should tell Trump
First of all tell Trump to remove his hatred of people off color and also how is He the best President when Americans are dieing from coronovirus on his watch and he doesn't have a clue what he is doing . you should be ashamed of yourself for saying that
America WAS great until Donald Trump, his kids and his band of cronies entered the picture. But then Republicans also supported Nixon until the very end. Nixon tho, was smarter than Trump. He left on his own b/4 Secret Svc had to escort him off WH grounds.

I do eveytime. I no longer see trump when he talks. I see her face. Which is such a relief from his ugly small mouth and squinty eyed face. 🤮
You have saved this country with your videos!.  I listen to Nothing trump says that comes from his face. I just want for your interpretation of his lies.   In a matter of fact I don't even see HIS face anymore when he speaks on the news but I'm not looking at the TV.

PRESIDENT TRUMP: Schools Must Re-Open, ‘Teachers are Essential Workers’
Trump should send federal troops to the jail they are being held and arrest the police and prosecutor for violating their 2nd amendment rights .
The problem is that individual Rs failed to hold Trump accountable.  The flip side is that we will need divided government for the Biden years.
No what many people want is a president that will actually protect their rights which neither trump or Biden will do and just because you’re afraid to break the status quo doesn’t make everyone who’s isn’t afraid a pussy in fact I think it makes you the pussy
It's frightening.  I have even seen people in the grocery store with trump 2020 masks.  I want to run the other way when I see them.
If Barr doesn’t muzzle her with a sweetheart deal that “doesn’t recall “ trump other than a few parties

Facebook has far too much power — and uses it to let Donald Trump run lying ads so they can profit. It's time for federal regulators to investigate #Facebook and act.

They were more of a check to Obama than Trump.   The bottom line is that neither party wants to serve as a check to a president of their own party. That’s why I want divided government.  Bring back Jim Stockdale’s Gridlock!

Instead we get pretend wannabe army of toy soldiers for General Trump to “play army” with. Like the little plastic soldiers I played with as a little boy. Mama would say “go play army with your soldiers and leave me alone so I can fix supper “.
Toy wannabe soldiers for trump to play “army” with and be a pretend battlefield commander like Patton in the movies. He’s like an 6 year old boy. BRAVELY SURGING HIS TROOPS INTO OUR CITIES TO BEATUP UNARMED CIVILIANS.
If Putin wanted them he could move tomorrow and Trump wouldn’t do a damned thing. ZIP NADA NOTHING

I love your impressions of Trump!..   I NO LONGER SEE TRUMP FACE WHEN HE TALKS. I LAUGH BECAUSE I ONLY THINK OF YOUR RESPONSES.  LOL..😆    I used to hate!. hearing him talk now i don't mind as much.   He should pay you for making him more palatable.
I think that’s just being honest. Garland was blocked because Obama was a Democrat. Trump’s nominee would be heard because he’s a Republican. That’s all they care about.
thinks the rioters just hate trump but in fact they hate America and a federal building is just a trophy. Wake the hell up! If there is no punishment for crimes then crimes will increase.
Being a former DOJ attorney is no longer good on your resume. Signals your an enabler of unconstitutional actions in order to achieve your goal. Barr has his enablers just like Trump has his Trumplican Senate and staff.
You are spot on. Trump refuses to go on any network other than Fox. He gives these pressers because he is a narcissist &amp; needs to feed it. Why not ask him why he wished a sexual predator, Grislaine Maxwell, well after she recruited/abused young girls in a sex trafficking ring.
👍I remember when experience in US ATTORNEYS OFFICE was good on your  it’s a badge of shame that your just another enabler of Trump/Barr. It’s a badge you will lie cheat and do anything to win not respect for constitution and rule of law and Justice.Enabler
General Trump is having fun playing General Patton with his wannabe toy soldiers . No pesky bone spurs. Pentagon wouldn’t cooperate so he’s got Barr to get him new toys.
I do remember that Wilson screened Birth of a Nation in the White House and spoke favorably of the film that glorified the KKK. You’re probably right, although I see Trump as more of a bigot than a racist.
Being a former prosecutor with US ATTORNEYS OFFICE used to be great on a resume. Now it’s turning into a liability. Stands for being a traitor to democracy and turning your back on the constitution. Barr is also surrounded by his own enablers. It’s not just Trump&amp; Barr.
They did just that so Trump could have his photo op they did it in Minnesota they did it in LA they did it in Orlando Daytona beach he’ll they’re kidnapping people off of the streets in unmarked vans in Portland

It’s a trap. The protests need to stop because it gives Trump a reason to use this national protection force. If it gets worse he could declare a National emergency and remain in office. Go home now. Get people registered to vote and bring people to the polls for early voting.
Mr Trump. Everyone gets that test at the dr’s ofc on a regular checkup if over 60 to check for dementia. I had it, like u , I “aced” it like millions more like us. U nor I are geniuses. Joe has probably taken it also. Try something else. That one won’t work.
Sir I’m already there.Trump will declare martial law to try and turn off this election cycle. He knows he faces charges when he leaves office. He’s not going to risk a defeat.There is honestly nothing to stop him. You know as practical matter there’s nothing. He’ll ignore courts.
I’d love to see her spoil a trump and Biden victory and I’m willing to bet you would go if you read her policies
This is, in my opinion, is one of his most egregious abuses of power. Roger Stone must still be holding goods on Trump. I imagine he is beholden to many now, and unless re-elected, he will not be able to repay. Fed Govt has certainly fattened his coffers.
You are spot on about Trump and taking him at his word on the election/ martial law. I do and I see little if anything to stop him with his enablers in Congress. Protests will just feed his narrative. We’re entering very dark times indeed. Not sure how we get thru this
Trump is getting desperate. Since he can no longer hold bellowing rallies, he will pull more desperate tricks out of his hat before Nov. But if he is not careful, instead of protesting, ppl will be fighting in streets, and the bunker will become his home.
You are the last of a dying breed of old school Democrats Leo. Time for you to switch party and come to the sane side. The Democrats has always been the racists. President Trump just revealed who they truly are.
I have never, in my 51 years, supported a President like I do, Trump. I am so sick and tired of Biden, Obama, Pelosi, the looters, the "quiet" protesters, BLM but most of all the "INNOCENT CHILDREN THAT HAVE DIED BECAUSE OF ALL OF THIS CHAOS". PRAYERS TO YOUR FAMILY!

Literally every time Trump speaks. Seriously- just pick a presser. How about the one where he suggested ingesting bleach?  Or when he wished G. Maxwell well.
I’d like to think that if my party ever elected someone as dangerous to democracy as Trump is that I would be as principled as #NeverTrumpers.
Exactly zero chance he will ever comment on Trump’s assertion that this election will be the most inaccurate and fraudulent election in history.
Sadly, I agree. We actually started out with a unified shut down, but as soon as Trump and unpatriotic, lunatic fringe organizations like Tea Party Patriots made it look like we had to choose between the economy and health, the unification fell apart. This is their civil war.

Only if Biden wins.  If Trump wins, it will last until January of 2025. Unless we take back the House and hold the Senate. It's up to you, people? Do yo like your masks and eye shields?
...Trashing the only person going against Trump right now, play’s into the hands of Trump... in other words you’re not helping to get this MF’er out, you’re enabling him to stay in... to give you his version of a crime bill.
How many could've been saved with Hydroxychloroquine? Dems are lying to America in an effort to hurt Trump and in the meantime people are dying.
Do you not remember trump changing the laws about media companies being responsible for user content?   Facebook can be sued if people follow bad advice and die now.  This is a direct result.
Here’s a question, Trump maybe signing off to reduce our military in Germany, but such a withdrawal doesn’t happen immediately, it takes years... couldn’t a President Biden undo and reverse a morons capitulation to Putin?
I remember watching this Christmas 2016 and thinking, wow, this is exactly what is happening here with Trump...can someone wake up up from our “Potterville nightmare”? Where is Clarence when you need him!

Wow. This is getting real. A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn’t pretty - The Boston Globe
Saw him being rude to  on MSNBC this morning while praising a Trump. Time to show  the door.
You’re in for a big disappointment. You backed a loser, a scammer, a cruel, dishonest racist fraud who was protected by daddy all of his life. After all of his failures, he moved on to con you. We’re now living with consequences of Trump’s incompetence, until January at least.
What bills? You do understand that money doesn’t change hands at all, right? Just a little side note. Trump is notorious for not paying his bills. It’s been well documented for years. He stiffs everybody.

I highly doubt that fake accounts with one follower could understand NATO spending, but Trump supporters don’t either. None of the NATO alliance countries give money to NATO. Trump acts like we write a check to them and that Germany’s check wasn’t big enough. 🤦🏼‍♀️
Trump is the ONLY person that can turn the economy around.  It’s happening now with record job growth occurring.
It's not that they are overwhelmed. They are under a stand down order by the politicians. Until that gets lifted, the city doesn't stand a chance. Politicians are hoping Trump gets defeated, because they have to know he isn't going to send them any money. Biden will.
How did stupid people like him and trump grow up to think they are so smart? Defies logic. #TrumpFailedAmerica
Lol  did you get your medical degree from Trump University?
As much as I hate Trump, it’s fake. Don’t give him any air to cry fake news.

1/ I will make this clear. I am just another human but, I’ll say this, make no mistake,Trump, with his order to pull troops out of Germany is only an agreement between him and Putin to pave the way for for conquer.
Trump is like a box of “ANIMAL CRACKERS “you never know which monster is coming out next.
Germany has been slapping us and the rest of our allies in the face for years. They need to pay their share. WTF happened to you, anyway? You get your little feelings hurt when Trump beat you?

You'd probably have to go to Canada to find a Trump supporter that thinks masks cause the virus. Even Fauci said masks were useless.  There are people that signed up to get tested. When they saw how long the lines were, they changed ther minds. They got letters saying they were +
Once again, if you’re supporting Trump, you’re evil and racist. You can be a Republican and not support that evil ass man.

There is no doubt that this was funded by Obama, produced in the China Wuhan Lab, and delivered through carriers across the Globe in a last ditch effort by the feckless Illuminati to keep Trump from being re-elected and thus themselves from being prosecuted.
Most of the people at that rally had masks. Statistics showed no spike directly related to the Trump rally.  The liberal cities may not be sending formal invitations, but they certainly aren't doing anything to stop, or even slow them down.
Can you imagine what it would be like if the media didn’t bash President Trump 24/7/365 for FOUR YEARS?  Not to mention pushing the Russian Collusion hoax for years!  Amazes me many don’t question being lied to for years!
that they wanted him there to answer questions?  Also it's funny how this is a man they approved to be Attorney General &amp; praised his knowledge of the law before but because he was nominated by Trump he is no longer the same person. Their hate for Trump is so much that they are
Y’all don’t find it weird that trump endorsed her knowing that someone died from using hydroxychloroquine and she’s the ONLY “medical professional” that’s says it “works”.  None of this is adding up or making sense at all.
Interesting what a trump endorsement will do to you. She’s spreading false information before she got endorsed by trump this is what she was posting. Telling us to wear a mask and wash our hands.
He blocked me at some point and I was never even rude to him, I only pointed out that what he was doing, only benefits Trump and to tamp it down... also he didn’t even allow Warren to drop out before jumping ship... dude is seriously inbalanced.
if Biden wins, can he declassify and make the Putin- trump calls public?
I didn’t vote for Trump. We’re talking about Barr.
Trump rallies stopped after isolations began. Protests and riots were much bigger crowds, and ran consecutively for two months and counting, all in liberal run cities.
There was a hospital ship that could hold 1000 plus patients and a tent hospital in Central Park. Neither was used. The Chinese New Year was in February, and the parade was in March. Trump shut down travel from China in January.  Protests in Liberal cities for 2 months.
It’s really sad that it’s going to take someone of high profile w/in the anti-mask wing of the  to die from this before people finally start taking this seriously. None of this makes any sense. Had Trump handled this well, it could have breezed him through re-election!

The party without Trump has zero guts. Less than zero. Almost comical how weak these aholes are.
I honestly can't understand it, other than their hate for Trump is so strong they'd rather have anyone, and I mean ANYONE, else in office.
Hey Eric, I hear there is a great platform to spread BS lies and generate more conspiracies openly and freely, Parlor!   Why hang around a platform like Twitter that denies you such a latitude to be the natural grifting cons that is a hallmark of the Trump credo?
Donald Trump isn't the one who sent infected people into nursing homes.  He's not the one who said we should celebrate Chinese New Year in Chinatown, or attend the St. Patrick's Day parade. Those were Democrats!
...they hope to win this time by making idiots believe staying home, wearing a mask, and voting by mail is the future but that will also fail because Trump has let them come from behind the veil and reveal themselves.
A little deeper than that. Their 16 year plan to destroy America was disrupted by Trump. So they want to get power back and have tried everything but they have failed. Now they hired terrorists to do damage and brought the C-virus ...
Trump's involvement has really tainted our understanding of what went wrong with the league. Now, he wasn't a positive force, but the reality of what went down is more complex. It should have succeeded, but was doomed before Trump walked through the door.
I reported the tweet that said god bows down to trump!
Like literally their whole platform is “we’re not Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell” which like... that bar is so low it is literally on the floor
It is possible that Trump is an incompetent asshole AND for hydroxychloroquine to be an effective drug. Don't be as dumb as Trump. The science is complicated. Take Trump out of the picture and try to be objective about the science.

Put the blame on Kemp he shouldn’t have been so worried about what Trump wanted and more about what the people of Georgia needed. He was told time afte time we were opening to early but he ignored that. He knows mask can help slow the spread of the virus but refuses to speak up.
You lost all credibility when you back pedaled on school openings it was bad enough we can’t trust trump and his dog and pony show but then you joined. You will never have the respect you worked so hard for. Be like Dr fauci and stand up for the truth.
Who didn’t see it coming! So now people who may be cops are kidnapping people. Well guess Trump is happy now we have the secret police coming to a town near you.
Then how does he keep up with current law? Barr didn’t know Trump issued new DACA laws this morning.
Remember, last week Trump and Barr ensured Law and Order were carried out by doing the first federal executions in more than a decade. Three disputable people met their maker last week (one of which a Neo-Nazi by the way). #LawAndOrder
I actually have a person I know (not a friend though) that is Republican, but doesn't want to seem like he's an Uncle Tom. But lately he's been posting videos of himself talking and I'm noticing Black people on his feed telling him to "preach" and "that's why I support Trump"

You know that phrase “everything Trump touches dies?” You don’t renovate a garden in 90 degree heat.

That was quite a little show the facist Trump Fixer put on today. And his fellow fascist Gym.
The area I think you’re getting at is Trump has dug into political normalcy, naturally, and the vitriol and shit tossing back and forth (for lack of better term) is both sided. But none of it excuses him. He is not a patriot, and this election we need to remind ourselves to be soWhy, Oh why, does the GOP keep is wobbly wheeled wagon hitched to team Trump?

I’m learning from Jonathan Turley today that Trump’s election delay tweet only goes to show how irresponsible it was for Biden to indulge a conspiracy theory that Trump would attempt to delay the election.
Trump got the left TRIGGERED!!! 😂😂😂😂😂
Trump is so used to the attention at this point - he won’t retire quietly. We’ll be hearing from this dude obnoxiously until his death.
If the election were held today, trump would have one of the most historic losses in history. But you’re right, trump is incapable of recovering an economy, so him being president much longer means the economy spirals further down.
what’s most frustrating is it’s not crumbling, it crumblED. Cain was presumably all but gone. railing against Covid wasn’t just futile science-denial, it spits in the face of genuine medical trauma.   it’s like these folks think they even have to fear Trump in death, honestly

For people who claim to love small government, conservatives have let Trump assume a lot of power 🥴
Fun fact: absentee and mail in voting is THE SAME THING.  Funner fact: Without an election Trump would no longer be president at noon on January 20th and the line of succession would likely be a democrat senator.
Trump's disapproval gap is huge, but it's still amazing that 40% approve of his job as president. Says a lot about our tribal nature.
Trump is President of USA, not other countries, what exactly do you think he can do? If other countries want to work with us, yes we can.
If it were filed prior to Trump running for President, it might have had legs.
If you “liked” this tweet in a genuine way and not in an ironic one I will unfollow and block you immediately. Trump is a clear and present danger to the Republic.
I think seriously discussing a distraction is being Trump's fool once again. Moreover, he doesn't have the power, so it is not about what he wants, but what the GOP is willing to do for him. If media must go with this story, it should focus on GOP support.
They were paid in a way, Trump loved them so much he actually did executive orders for criminal justice reform, money for Black Colleges, opportunity zones, low black unemployment, and more!
The purpose of (1) knowing history and (2) reading fiction is to be able to identify when a corrupt person makes a grab for power. Donald Trump is suggesting we delay the election, which would keep him in power longer.
I get my laughs in the morning by searching for Twitter accounts that  declare both 1)support for Trump and 2) an interest in the truth. Cracks me up every time!!🤪
The bigger the crisis, the bigger the distraction.  Don't fall for it AGAIN, please! Not still after 3.5 years!!  THIS 👇 is what it is all about, including Trump's election statement.

I find it quite comical that when President Trump talks about low income housing libs says he’s racist because they automatically assume he’s talking about POC. Low income housing means housing for families with low income regardless of race.
Oh come on this was in the past it's time to move on not everyone is racist biggest one is racist and that is Donald Trump people need talk about that then old videos like get real he's already going through enough give him a break i love joey graceffa he is a sweetheart

Hopefully for Trump, Caine signed his waiver (the proof that his campaign knew the risks they were taking in Tulsa).

Trump could have been a hero by showing leadership &amp; getting things done, letting his experts run things. The only guess I have for his motivation is that he saw an opportunity for some of the best grift of his presidency &amp; thought he'd get away with it as he has everything else.
Trump and his minions chose not to enact the National Pandemic Response Plan, and now 150,000 people are dead, the GDP has dropped by 32.9%, millions are soon to be evicted and foreclosed upon, and now he's threatening to "postpone" elections. This is bad.

*The headline we will see and not care to read the article* .. BREAKING: “Donald Trump viscously attacks senior citizen. Verbally abuses the elder and pushes his racist agenda down his throat while man pleads for justice for all” the headline in today’s culture is all that matter
My heart goes out to Herman Cain and his family during this time of loss. Yet, I wonder if President Trump feels somewhat guilty by defying experts that advised to not hold a rally because of the COVID-19 risk?
Lol. All quacks. A group the Tea Party put together 12 days prior to help Trump.  If what they say is true and Hydroxycholorquine is a cure you still have to blame Pence and Trump's task for for not declaring it a cure.
Yes !!!!!! All #wildlife matters !!!! Now do those deviant Trump boys.
Perhaps it’ll work for Louie Gomert ........ but then again it just might speed up his demise from the Trump hoax
So you wanted protesters at the service? Doesn’t matter what he does someone would have been mad. If he went, he would be accused of making it about himself. Way to honor John a Lewis by drawing attention to Trump. You need help!
😒🤳🏿True story 👉🏿 tRump spent the 1st 3yrs of his campaign touting that illegals from the Southern border would infect this country with murder &amp; disease. Truth be told the ones doing the most Spreading of the disease are, get this, 👉🏿 Republicans. Go figure! 😠😠😠 👇🏿👇🏿👇🏿
Trump said delay the election like the constitution doesn’t exist. 💀
But you praising tRump. So laughable. He’s definitely old, and definitely White. And definitely a racist. And last but not least, definitely incompetent.
You thought the “Blacks for Trump” were safe huh? Smh. R.I.P.
And I’m the same age as Pompeo... east Berlin Wall? Was he on the communist side fighting an agreed wall coming down? All of these Trump admin and enablers have one mission... demolish democracy.
I’m brainstorming my ideas on how Biden is gonna slip out of the debates .. it would be so funny to see this dude on stage with trump lol they’d run a nationwide anti-bullying campaign after because they’d have first hand evidence of trump bullying the hell outta an old man. Lol
Crazy that Herman Cain went to a Trump rally with no mask and then died from Covid.
I sure hope the Trump administration plans to send in undercover agents to monitor the people handling the mailed in ballots. That’s where the fraud is going to happen and I don’t doubt the left already has many mailmen on their payroll.
This made me laugh so much because, no matter how we feel about Demos, we are all sick of Trump’s tweets!!!  😂😂😂
Trump knows he can’t move the election. He just wanted to distract you from the WORST economic quarter in US HISTORY!!! #TrumpFailedAmerica #ETTD
Exactly especially when he was a braver man than trump will ever be. Just be silent, no need to shit on the dead.
I agree. But it just in bad taste that men with less privilege were sent off to war while trump got to stay here. Where is the equality there?
So you're not denying that Trump pardoned someone who could implicate him in a crime.
Well if you think Trump is good role model for your kids, then Child Services needs to be called immediately!!! Not sure how you can ignore Trump's behavior, but do you! #biden #trump
Trump Jr. and Other Aides Met With Gulf Emissary Offering Help to Win Election
I'm not a Trump voter.
I have been telling everyone that lately there has been an increase in spam, robo calls. I thought there was some kind of law or ordinance put in place last year by Trump. 🤔
Pretty sure the market is still higher than before Trump took office.
I think the world is slowly beginning to wake up and see who the actual thugs, thieves and criminals of the world are... (note: not all Caucasians). Just the ones like boris, and trump... Now and throughout history.
Lol. Because he told you yo blame China...another distraction. I remember when Ebola showed up in NY. Guess who Trump blamed?  Hint: 👇🏾
Finally seeing what us sane people have been shouting about Trump all along eh? He's a fascist.
Putin?! Why all of Trump’s private calls to Putin with no mention of bounties on US soldiers and silence from you! Where’s the accountability? Crickets!
Weak excuse, my friend. Trump isn't the first to have an opposing party. Stop whinning anout it.   Have fun applauding his troll work. Also applaud the fool rewting a video of a quack "doctor" who believes the gov is partly run by reptiles disguised as humans.

The above is what they did for our June voting- Here is fact check on what you mentioned.
What dictators do:
Well, when you factor-in the margin-of-error...  Biden is still beating the living hell out of Trump in NH, right now.  But, given that failure is NOT an option in this election, let's continue fighting for Biden as if he's 10 points down.
First off, you're misrepresenting what she said. She's not questioning why people voted for Trump--she's questioning why they continue to support him. That is a very, very big difference.
I never imagined anyone could be more generally despised than Bush and now, because of Trump, he seems like a patron saint of yesteryear!
Sadly because Trump has made wearing a mask part of his culture war, Herman did not wear one and he caught Covid-19. Such a preventable death.
This country  can not will  stop for Trump .He will be whining months and maybe  years long after his fat butt is kicked out of the WH in Nov.

Lol.   You deflected away from the historically low GDP numbers.  Trump's America is hot mess.
Must be nice 2 not have 2 worry or fight 4 ury right 2 vote. On the day we lay honorable John R Lewis 2 rest this is what ur bitching about. Blk/brn ppl R being suppressed but hey keep helping Trump &amp; then they'll come after ur rights but Dems will be there 2 look out 4 you.
He also never said many of the things you imply he said (like that Jesus said that everyone should sell what they have and give to the poor). He literally said, "Things Jesus said." Defense of Trump or not, your reply seems very quick to make assumptions for the sake of arguing.
I just saw your bye Nicole and Steve tweet and tried to jump in. Everybody is so over Trump. Politics are slow. It just keeps going.

So first be upset he didnt go then its oh he wouldn't get in anyway like that would actually happen smh trump has done more for African Americans than your precious obama
I think your points were really valid  only thing you didn’t think about is the role the media has done to divide us because everybody hated Trump from the beginning so if he did anything  that you liked you were excoriated
Trump-connected lobbyists reap windfall in federal virus aid
All three of these men are decent, especially in the face of Trump. Buzz off. Troll.
There is a productive middle ground between panic and complacence. We need to be #AwareAndPrepared for everything that #Trump &amp; his allies might do to cause chaos around the elections, and be ready to act. #Election2020
All that fealty by Cain to Trump, and  stomps on his head.
Really... I can’t even imagine! 🤔 What a tremendous burden it must be for you to still be defending Donald Trump
I get it-I really do. I’m just saying I think the theatrics about Trump has been more about distracting voters in order to gain power than about Dems being appalled at how terrible he is. That would explain why most people have no clue about any of the good things he’s done.
Nothing like the W H. spending time trolling Twitter and the country is hot mess.   Because the country needs another troll on Twitter right now.  Trump supporters should expect more from the W.H.
Biden *is* a bowl of sh¡t, because he’s so terrible and it sucks that we couldn’t have someone way better and progressive.  But we can recognize the importance of Trump losing, who’s like 10 bowls of sh¡t.
RIP Mr. Cain.  Let this be a lesson to all of us that Donald Trump and his enablers, such as Mrs. Conway, do NOT care about Americans’ health during this crisis. Only spreading false information for political gain.  Here is a casualty of that misinformation.
The marathon, three-hour service in the sanctuary of Ebenezer Baptist Church on Thursday was a celebration of John Lewis and the democracy for which he lived and, several times, nearly died.
Did President Obama say something that wasn’t true? If a Democrat President was doing what Trump is doing I would think the republicans would call him/her out on it, this was a perfect time knowing what Congressman John Lewis stood for.
Where did he mention Trump? It seems clear to me his message is geared towards those Christians who would support Trump despite what the Scriptures say on this issue. I think you may have been a lot more political with your response than the author was with his post.
Mr. Trump gets things done ✅
Other problems?? Yes!  The most important one is “remove Trump from the White House!”
Sad thing is we have 49 million unemployed, 159,000 dead from a virus he claimed to have under control back in February, historically low national GDP, and you think Trump trolling people on Twitter is a worthy task for Trump.  Save trolling for trolls. He has work to do.
Their base doesn’t really want to be governed. They want to be ruled. And have their never ending needs for grievances fed. That’s why it’s reached cult level with Trump.
There is no such thing as "universal mail-in voting", only Absentee voting which Trump himself and most of his staff use, also all miltary oversees, the elderly, and people aways from their state- there is no problem with this He is just manipulating and trying to surpress votes
You worried you’ll have to soon answer why you ordered  use Logan Act to try &amp; frame  in secret Oval Office meeting on 1/5/2017? This was days before Trump was sworn in. Your coup attempt has dishonored all our soldiers who’ve died to prevent this Communist tactic.
Trump fired the inspector general who was reportedly investigating Sec. of State Pompeo — and he has no real reason for it other than ‘[Pompeo] requested’ it  #FixThePolice
Things President Trump has in common with my 4mo son:  🔸Can't formulate a proper sentence 🔸Constantly whining 🔸Expects everyone's universe to revolve around him 🔸Can't handle a ramp 🔸Tries to erase all progress we've made 🔸Wears a combover
Trump is playing 4-D chess while everyone else is playing checkers.
You may not be settling but lot of us are.Most progressives/young folk dislike Biden bc of his extremely regressive past,inadequate platform,&amp;poor temperament. We may recognize importance of Trump losing gen election,but we hate that its to Biden rather than someone way better.
So Putin or China have our voting machines rigged for Trump and that’s why he’s freaking out about mail in voting?

Perhaps Donald Trump is trying to martyr himself. Even a demented old fool should know that exposure to and infection by the coronavirus is a virtual death sentence for a man in Trump's physical condition. He seems to have a death wish. Could he be committing suicide by pathogen?
“Trump supporters aren’t going to riot...”
It’s not the nba’s fault our post Trump government is trash now.
Trump is a murderer.
This is not opinion. It’s empirical fact. Trump is responsible for tens of thousands of deaths.  He should be thrown out of office. We may not survive his reign until January.
Trump already has the Religious Right vote. If he can't win with their support, Pence can't either.

Love you  please update to: Your daily reminder that Trump is the first president elected since Nixon to refuse to release his tax returns, continues to sue to allow any oversight in all courts to keep us from knowing whether Trumps pay taxes and who’s loaned money.

Lewis didnt like trump and I think it would have been more disrespectful had trump went. That's like ppl that you dont like goin to ur funeral. Dont be fake at the end. Had trump went ppl would be mad he went  Herman also had colon cancer but the media doesn't tell you that. Smh
I refuse to bring up trump wanting to move the election to my hyper conservative mother because if she agrees with him I’m gonna flip my shit

Did he not see Trump’s “address” in Mt. Rushmore? THAT was a political rally.
The only thing I might be more tired of hearing about besides trump is joe rogan
You can tell by his defeated voice Trump has had a rough day today. Probably got beat down with all the push back to his delayed election tweet.  Combined that with the GDP report and Herman Cain reality check and he was searching for a new message.  #trumppresser
Fan the Trump base into a rabid fury. It’s okay. They’ll just foam at the mouth and still lose in November.
READ MY OP-ED: Trump Is Running A 3-Card Monte Con Game On America He uses unfulfilled, hyperbolic promises, to cover up other unfulfilled, hyperbolic promises. He is using lies, misinformation, disinformation &amp; personal attacks to control the media.   62

Walsh on Trump tweet: I don't give a damn if he's joking, he said it. Former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh reacts to a tweet by President Donald Trump in which he suggests delaying November's presidential election.
Actually to see 3 presidents are compentent compared to Trump. Clinton had his issues and I hated W Bush, but by God you would want them back. 😀
Trump set the precedence of turning everything into a campaign rally, but if Obama eulogy trigger you that much you might need to cut back on snake oil consumption
Never forget, the same people who are attacking Trump now, are also the same ones who were blaming him for all of our preexisting problems on the day after he took office.
I am praying for America and for our President.   Every democrat I see is evil and corrupt and a lap dog for the deep state.  God please help President Trump to withstand the forces of evil that beset us.
Washington’s Attorney General Bob Ferguson Started Prepping In March To Sue If Trump Tried To Delay The Election, and states he is ready to file a lawsuit in 24 hours if the president tries.
* Knowing that he's likely to lose, Trump thinks he can manipulate a large Biden margin to call the election illegitimate  I think the 2nd would not be an effective strategy for him. The first is certainly possible, but usually requires close margins to hide detection.
Trump pleads with Dems to agree to extend $600 unemployment boost  via

You can tell that every time Trump is at at podium he thinks he’s going to make some iconic, historic speech. And he’s right, except for all the wrong reasons.

white females who are in sororities and proudly support Trump
110M eligible voters didn’t vote. I can understand why some disaffected folks took a flyer on trump. But after this disastrous response to CV19 why on earth would they vote for him again? How has he unified the country? He’s only bringing the crazies out. You want more of that?
Not unless Trump or Ivanka get it.
give trump a break, we all cope differently
Lol im DYING laughing at this page..im like pretty sure it’s a parody account but who can be %100 sure when it comes to trump voters
These three are why Trump is in office.
Ask Lincoln's opponent to hold Trump's beer.
This is news somehow? What should scare people is that he doesn't care about people in red states dying, either. His political team might, but trump doesn't.
As a Trump supporter, THIS is the issue you’re bringing up??? NICE STRATEGERY, Peg!
Trump:” Our country will be a laughing stock all over the world” Rest of the world:
That's exactly what trump did. John Lewis wouldn't want trump at his funeral. Lol I dont blane trump for not going
Sorry but I don’t see any socialist or lefties crooks here. All of these here are liars. Now the way trump is trying to control everything my opinion with him we’re heading to a country like Cuba. Trump stinks and destroyed the economy.
Trump doing more damage to the GOP than Dems could ever do
I am not delusional. I had these sort of nightmares when Trump was first elected. But you are right, we had better be prepared to fight like hell.
“We’re making vague statements that no one thought we ever would. Some are saying we’re making more of these than ever! And next week some things will happen that will surprise a lot of people.”  Trump, probably.

Trump gonna try to ban the NBA after that 😭😭
Not disagreeing that it will happen but watch what you wish for. In politics turnabout is fair play!  Exhibit One, Reed does away with nominations and sub Supreme Court filabuster and Trump and McConnell pack the Courts at all three levels with incredible ease.
I don’t know; let’s ask Trump and Barr.

Why is Trump so hung up on having to leave the White House?  Chances are excellent that he'll be living in another federal facility very soon.
As much as he doesn't understand that Trump literally said the election was rigged four years ago and his voters still turned out.

Well said and welcome aboard the Never Trump Republican Express.  Growing larger every day!
Calabresi sees no path to Trump winning re-election — and may, in fact, see the delayed election tweet as the nail in the coffin — so now he's looking to clear the path for a better nominee so that the Federalist Society can continue his preferred method of stealing the republic.
I hate how people are saying its trumps fault people are dieing because of the virus when its yells fault for not taking care of each other and being irresponsible when going to places trump doesn't make your decisions
Donald Trump is a fascist, says an arch conservative and prior supporter
Such decisions keep Trump's xenophobic base happy, which allows him to continue his corruption. As a result, US technology leadership and quality of life declines. November is our last chance to put a stop to this.

Now is not the time to hold onto your fiscal conservatism. Do that when Trump wanted the wall, or give handouts to farmers.
To be fair, ever since Trump started giving the Saudi Arabian ruling family that paid for 9/11 everything they wanted—planes, bombs, troops, etc—because "they pay cash," we haven't had any more "radical Islamic terrorists." Which is cool but how do we War on Terror without them?
and   I think it should be the  that escort Donald Trump out if he refuses to leave.
It’s a bit puzzling that this  tweet is the straw that seems to have broken the camel’s back for Calabresi. Having said that, I notice that he doesn’t say in the op-ed that he won’t be voting for Trump.
That's right not only are you rubbing our noses in the fact that Sanders got messed over again ( the infamous Obama phone call the day before Super Tuesday) now  you are fear mongering ( do you want to risk 4 more years of President Trump?) Sigh. TL
Trump was personally deeply insolvent, but it was very much "You owe bank 1 million, bank owns you. You owe bank 1 billion dollars, you own the bank." situation. Trump was put on a large allowance instead of forcing personal bankruptcy to basically keep Trump's image intact.
You are the only person on here that I see that gets it. Nobody is laughing at him. Pelosi’s team tweeted from the funeral that Trump can’t change the election. They are want to swim in negativity for 95 more days. I am going to trash talk and do this 👇
Protests* they aren’t rioting. They veterans and moms are literally just standing there protesting while fed beat and kidnap people. I agree Trump did sign an EO to help veterans get the care they need, now we wait for the fallout of the order, hoping it’s good.

How did Herman Cain catch a “China virus” from a Trump rally in Oklahoma? Shouldn’t it be called a #TrumpVirus instead?
Journalists, please stop saying Trump was subdued because he’s “mourning” Herman Cain’s death. You have ample evidence he’s primitive and damaged and incapable of empathy or authentic grief. He’s only, and always, nursing a narcissistic injury (right now it’s that he’s LOSING).
He had the COVID-19 that he got from The Tulsa Trump Coronafest. Herman Cain's blood is on Trump's hands!
I dont understand women who support trump. Like did their husbands tell them too? I really don't understand
No, there is no bottom for either Trump or his sycophantic supporters in Congress.

think he caught it from the June 20 Trump Rally?

Trump is the only idiot who didn’t know this! Also the Democrats use to be Republicans! Tell us something we didn’t already know!
I never even mentioned trump. Sounds like u should take ur own advice. And genius, he was speaking on a major portion of John Lewis legacy &amp; what he fought for. What the heck did u think he was going to speak about. That’s like saying don’t speak about music at Aretha’s funeral.

Does... Does he not realize that the bulk of his base is 50+?  Seriously; 64% of Trump supporters are 50+. 32% are 65+.  Trump is literally telling the majority of his supporters, "Only you have to worry about dying from this thing I don't care about."
It's easy to tell which votes are fraudulent and which are not. All those votes FOR Trump = good: safe, honest, valid, fraud-free. All other votes illegal, rigged, etc.
A lot of people saying "Trump doesn't have the authority to..." assuming that is a deciding factor. It not being legal to do something is A factor, but he's done lots of things that aren't legal. THE deciding factor is always power. Does he have the power to do it?
GOP only think of themselves, corporations, and tax breaks for the wealthy and anything to appease Trump. Anytime you all could Fix the economy, Stop the Virus, uphold the Constitution and our laws, Storp foreign influence, and Think about the people of America for once!
Encouraging to see many Republicans denounce Trump's suggestion that we should delay the election
No one, particularly Donald Trump can upstage President Obama.
Because Trump failed to make it an issue when he had the House and Senate. Never mentioned voter ID for those 2 yrs. Pretty obvious.
I'm sad to hear of his passing, but he doesn't come within an inch of #RIPJohnLewis. Herman chose to follow Trump's crazy agenda, and he died for his blind faith in a dictator.
The final decision was made by Herman Cain. trump is a co-conspirator,  Caine is the main perpetrator.
He “needs” the Trump base for what? He’s nowhere near as radical as them.

"Considering closing" = "is being intentionally run aground and sunk by yet another unqualified Trump-appointed lackey"
I mean if the shoe fits. Trump supporter with a history of homophobic and transphobic comments? Probably not a great guy on misogyny and racism
And I think supporting Trump is delusional and requires an unhealthy comfort with blatant racism and xenophobia amongst other things...
So...lay out ur alternative! Our only hope right now is TRUMP! Unless u want 2 live in DEM socialist CHOP POS!!!
Trump/Pence 2020: can you assure anybody of anything?

What will Trump do as an ex-President? Time, he’ll be doing time.
Biden built the system Trump is using.  It's dangerously naive to suggest Biden wouldn't use the very system he built.  You know who wouldn't? Howie Hawkins. #Hawkins2020
I thought it was the trump Tulsa virus #trumpvirus
Making clear the threat of a bipartisan impeachment may be the only way to check Trump's impulse to dispense with free and fair elections rather than face the possibility of defeat.
Who brought up trump? Please kill the obsession.
Trump admitted he will stay in office no matter what... by saying that it will take YEARS to decide the real results of the election if you "do it right."  #TrumpIsAFascist
If u are Godsmacked about failing economy, blame Trump! If u are wondering why US economy is faltering, blame trump. If u are wondering why your 401 is only half of what it was a couple yrs ago, blame Trump. If u are suddenly ashamed and scared to be American, move to Canada.
#BlueMAGA wants a sane President.  They need to elect Howie.  In 2016, Hillary Clinton won 9 states, Donald Trump won 4, and Nobody won 37.  Of course a third party can win.  #VoteGreen
This is, in fact, validates Trump's 1st impeachment, since the issue there was essentially the same: an attempt by a sitting president to maintain his hold on power by undermining the fairness of the election. Calabresi and company didn't see it then because they didn't want to.
You better believe I retweet them... count me with Larry Hogan and Ben Sasse and Mitt Romney... I will never support, defend or make excuses for the sad person in Trump...deficit running, pandemic ignoring, emoluments stealing, hateful toward women, faux religious person in trump
During the Wallace interview Trump promised a great new Healthcare plan that he would unveil within 2 weeks. Quess what, there is no plan.
Honestly there’s nothing for them to debate , the people voting for joe are voting for joe ..the people voting for trump are voting trump

Did Trump mention postponing election insincerely to distract from GDP report, or sincerely because of the GDP report?
The last refuge of a cornered #Republican is to say "it's a joke."  No one's laughing  . No. One. Is. Laughing.   And it's not because the "joke" didn't "land." It's because #Trump is a threat to democracy. So are you.
The moment you hear Michael Cohen cleared all legal hurdles preventing him from writing a Trump tell all book.

Hermain Cain died today from coronavirus, after contracting it from Trump’s rally in Tulsa. John Lewis was eulogized today in an inspiring ceremony where 3 former presidents honored his civic and political career.   ...there’s a political lesson to be learned in there somewhere.
Electing Donald Trump was the most reckless act in the history of American democracy. He needs to be defeated soundly and ushered out of the White House and into well-deserved historical infamy on January 20th, 2021.

If I weren't thoroughly convinced that it's just as effective to touch your windowpane at home as the touchscreen of an electronic voting machine, I'd be pushing for turnout in the election to defeat Trump. Of course, the prospect of a Biden presidency is frightening, as well.
There are 4 million plus Trump voters in California, let alone the number of Republicans and conservatives. They are so deeply dumb.

It’s still a question in the mind of a lawmaker of color IF he should vote for Trump at this point? It’s an actual consideration? How much more failed leadership does Hurd need to see UP CLOSE in order to step away from this dumpster fire?
John Lewis didn’t die of corona virus..... he knew the implications and practiced safety measures to avoid being infected.  Herman defied the fact that the virus was real and went to a trump rally without any safety measures. He did it to himself. His fault!

No one is going  down that road with you. Biden is on thin ice as well. He was def not my choice.   It's interesting how you can understand the point of view of black folk when we support Biden but you cannot understand why we think Trump is racist. Honestly just STFU!
Cain’s death may well become the tipping point in public perception of Trump, and in doing so, will inadvertently be Republican Cain’s greatest contribution to democracy, the US &amp; the world.

I watched the local CBS affiliate. Karen Greer was the point person for the media. Everyone associated with the coverage for CBS was a Black person . I moved to Atlanta in 1989 and Karen Greer was just starting out. In light of the violent response to BLM protests by Trump...
Trump is setting it up. His dumb followers will vote election day, cuz they ain't afraid of no covid! So it will appear he wins. Most dems will more than likely vote by mail and it will take weeks to count. He will send his smarmy lawyers everywhere to stop the counting.
Republicans detaching from Trump as his poll numbers bottom out get no credit. You’re just trying to plant the seeds for the party to claim trump was an outlier. They do not get to pretend they are separate from this.
We already knew Democrats didn't give 2 shits about the Constitution.  With Trump, it's clear his 30% base doesn't either.  It's amazing the document that is the foundation of our country is totally shit on by around 75% of American citizens. This is why we're in trouble.
I very genuinely cannot understand or process the logic of someone who has a change of heart or mind on Donald Trump in July of 2020. What have you been doing? This is not a rhetorical question. What about any of this is surprising or beyond the scope of who has been?

This is exactly right.  Being “forced” to hold it on time, then making it as chaotic as possible gives Trump his strongest argument for not accepting the results.
Still says the same.  Listen...if you think anyone blames Trump for the appearance of the virus you're misunderstanding.  But yes, absolutely, many blame him for his handling of the virus.  Full stop.
Did Herman Cain have to sign the waiver to attend that Tulsa Trump rally?
Why is Trump not impeached
What about withdrawing troops from Germany? What about Russia arming the Taliban and paying bounties on our troops? What about abandoning our Kurdish allies in Syria?  If you really care about national security why don’t you call Trump our when he endangers it?

So maybe we should all stop patting people like George W. Bush on the back for performing the unthinkable task of being more decent than Donald Trump. Yeah, I guess he’s slightly less embarrassing but believe me when I say I cannot wait for George Bush to die
I hope you're not talking about Obama. Trump is Satan but Obama is apart of the corrupt system that made those cages, undermined BLM, dismissed Flint Michigan, droned strikes families, sent troops to protect pipelines and so much more.
You need to deal with the Trump and your party.  Stop demonizing the Democrats.
I’d like to think that if my party ever elected someone as dangerous to democracy as Trump is that I would be as principled as #NeverTrumpers.
Am I supposed to believe that if Trump simply attended John Lewis’ funeral today, that would be some grand act of benevolence? Of course he didn’t go, it would be weird if he did.
At the moment it is to spread this Military Civil Disturbances Operations and Chemical Agents stuff to protesters far and wide so when feds and militarized police try to brutalize them they may better protect themselves.  Justice, end systemic racism, defund, no delay, out trump

While I like Trump doing ‘briefings’-they’re AWFUL for his re-election campaign-I also HATE seeing his stupid orange face on my tv...

Steven Calabresi is as Republican as you will find. He's concerned about Trump attempting to postpone the election.
He beat colon cancer in 2007 &amp; was actually pretty healthy in recent years. He technically was high risk simply because of his age. He made a choice to attend that crowded Trump rally and also decided against wearing a mask.  isn't wrong in stating the obvious.
Chris said Cain's blood is on Trump's hand because Trump, against all accepted knowledgeable advise held a indoor rally with no masks and no social distancing.  Nana implied that was stupid.  Moya said just as stupid as an anti-masker.  I don't see your point and this is tiring.

It really is. Trump’s cult members are so deranged that he can ignore Russian bounties on our troops and they STILL try to make excuses. Sad really.
There is a great deal of truth to this video. But I know many will defend Trump and say that the bounty surrounding the Troops is not confirmed. But he confirmed that it was chatter and truth.
Sadly, I agree. We actually started out with a unified shut down, but as soon as Trump and unpatriotic, lunatic fringe organizations like Tea Party Patriots made it look like we had to choose between the economy and health, the unification fell apart. This is their civil war.
Trump should just resign, He cannot handle the COVID-19.We will never though this virus 🦠 without proper leader ship~
That might be what it is used for now, but originally I think it was spread by China as a way to cripple the US and other economies, as well as Trump's chances of re-election.Obama also stopped the Gain of Function research that makes viruses more virulent and wanted pandemic funding  to be prpared for the worst. The GOP opposed. It started again under Trump and now covid-19 is out.
Please President Trump Make Executive order for Us not to have to wear a mask  Especially for November 3rd....

Hey          where is the tweet apologizing for blaming Trump and Republicans when in fact it was a previous Democrat precinct committeeman with the party from 2016 to 2019??
I completely agree Terence. We don't have to both like Trump to be friends. You're obviously a good person as well and I always enjoy speaking with you. Talk to you after the game!!!
Do you realize how stupid you sound to conservatives right now? But that's OK. Like I said, when it's just you and the ballot, no one will judge you for voting for Trump.
You have no idea that unethical trump is just that...unethical.
The Doomers keep coming. “But did you see the Utah poll? He’s down 50! What about that tweet? Did you hear Trump wore his mask improperly? How will that effect Florida?”
characters matter to you? He has scandals too, right? But you support him because of his policies. We're not voting for a pope. I just want someone to make the right decision got Americans. In my view, despite the fact that I hate the person he is, Trump has done that. 3/3
delivered on more promises than any POTUS in recent memory. We're tired of "no new taxes" before election to new taxes the first month in office. We want people to keep their promises and Trump has done that more than past ones. I don't care about his character. Does Trudeau's /2
Trump could take a dump on the Resolute desk and you’d say it was presidential.
Anytime we get into character assassination of Trump, I'll lose cause I agree with you on almost all of it. I still don't think it changes how I vote or the fact that he's the POTUS.
Gentlemen.  Something trump knows nothing about.   Sad for America.
I notice most righteous liberals say religion shouldn't matter in politics. Why don’t they realize it's the same for conservatives?! Trump doesn't share my religious values, but I don't care! His policies help my family! I couldn't care LESS about his religious beliefs!
Why should Biden leave when trump is destroying himself.
Trump has turned America into the FYRE festival. #TrumpHatesScience
You are right, but you and I both know, that if it was ANYONE other than Trump that promoted HCQ, we wouldn't be having this conversation right now... Why is that?
Haha thanks. I appreciate your knowledge in Asian last names (unlike  You are free to vote whoever you want to. I'm not here to change that. All I'm saying is, in 2016, we had the same people bashing Trump publicly vote for him on election day. 🤫
YOU PUT TRUMP FIRST ALWAYS. LIKE TODAY.  TRYING TO  DAMAGE OTHER COUNTRIES (who HAVE no where near  US cases).  SO JEALOUS OF GOVS WHO  DID A  DECENT JOB.  AMERICANS SEE RIGHT THRU U. FAILED LEADER.

Looks like it didn’t matter to Trump. I won’t speak ill of the dead so I’ll just say, “Godfather’s Pizza hit right after the skating rink.
a possibility should (I would think) be something ALL people, especially liberals crying so much about COVID-19, to celebrate and seek. But instead of doing so, we've banned it completely in some places. It's crazy how much power the hatred for Trump has.
The thing is, Terence, the drug HCQ is VERY safe. It is listed as one of the safest drugs by WHO in the treatment and prevention of malaria. But now we've completely BANNED it because Trump suggested it, even though it MAY possibly help people live. Just the fact that there is
He was in remission since 2007. Trump killed him.
We already KNOW YOUR RECORD OF SERVICE AND HARD WORK FOR AMERICANS! Donald Trump however, is an entirely DIFFERENT STORY! Joe Bide for PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA! YYYYAAAAASSSSS!
which is unheard of in medicine. This is not cocaine. HCQ is an OTC medicine in most countries (including Canada, I believe) and can safely given to pregnant women and babies. But now its BANNED because Trump proposed it. That's a problem for me. /4
Put it this way, if Trump is not president you and I wouldn’t even know his son’s name. So your worry about his safety is due to what you see politically. Then you used his son to reference his instability.   Leave the kids out of the politics.
Except trump voters will show up maskless.
Not sure, and you can’t be sure. Hard for any politician to control a virus. 26 children age 14 &amp; under died from the virus as of 6/17. Studies show kids are not carriers to adults on a substantive level.   Trump’s response has been bad, absolutely.  You’re better than this tweet
If trump losses he’s going to run again
We must go out and  vote. If we keep Trump in power. Many more citizens will die specially the elderly.
It's OK guys. We understand you guys have to be anti-Trump in public and in the polls. We know that when election time comes and it's just you and the ballot, you'll do the right thing and vote from Trump, just like you guys did in 2016. Your secret is safe with us.
President Trump’s Campaign Ad #Trump2020
Trump’s tweets are “dumb” like an arsonist lighting a school is “dumb.” Trump is destroying foundational pillars of our republic. Your judgment is the one that needs an adjustment.
I’m voting for Trump but only God can save America.
Trump's like...
Cain was diagnosed on June 29th and on July 2nd he tweeted that people could attend the Trump appearance at Mt. Rushmore on the 4th.. Masks were not required. Who does that?
When a Federalist Society co-founder bears fangs against a Republican President, you know things have gotten serious.    Great (and short) read.
Would have been great if people took the virus seriously cause trump can't make your decisions
I hate how people are saying its trumps fault people are dieing because of the virus when its yells fault for not taking care of each other and being irresponsible when going to places trump doesn't make your decisions
This guy. I appreciate the hell out of people like this.   This man is a conservative. Will be voting for Trump in 2020 but he can AT LEAST see tbe absolute bullshit that POTUS is engaging in. Good for you Erick.  We need more Republicans like you.

Why Trump brought up the election?
Did find it interesting how many feathers this ruffled that usually don't get ruffled by everything else Trump does. (ex.
The new Postmaster General that Trump appointed is slowing the mail down. In all the years I've lived in this house I've had mail every day but within the last 2 weeks there were days at a time that mail was not delivered. My absentee ballot came a week before that of my spouse.
More like a passionate campaign speech against Trump.
Cain attended President Donald Trump's June 20 rally in Tulsa, where he tweeted a photo of himself surrounded by people not wearing masks.
The next big Steven King blockbuster will be the horrors of living under this administration. Who will play trump??
DON'T TRY TO MAKE ME LIKE TRUMP! NEIN!!!
The United States of America is craving for leadership, because we have NOT had it under Donald Trump since he has been in office. We often do NOT miss the water, until the well runs dry and there is no sign of refilling! IT IS TIME FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD!
Trump and his ass hole minions are doing their best to slow down and even stop postal service to keep mail-in ballots from being delivered. We must stop this attack on our freedom to vote without getting sick and dying.
Please push to call the Postmaster in for a hearing immediately to address alleged slowdowns already ordered and to address Trump's claims of massive mail in voter fraud.

Your lifetime must have been filled with STUPIDITY, if you think these three honorable men were less presidents than the clown LITTLE MAN DONALD TRUMP! YOU ARE IGNORANT AND NEED TO WAKE UP TO REALITY!
The ⁦ and ⁦ have proven they will do ANYTHING to protect Trump and their Senate majority. And they will get help from the ⁦  #RepublicansAreDestroyingAmerica
President Obama give us hope while trump give us hate!
Classy is when you vote to extend folks unempl ins. Making sure folks are not evicted from their homes. Making sure folks can have access to health care, etc. etc. Watch how he votes. Nothing classy with this trump sycophant.
Just like with most IGNORANT people, I don't have a clue of who or what you are talking about. We are HONORING JOHN LEWIS, if you want to wallow in what is not being done for this country, I would strongly suggest you direct those comments to LITTLE MAN DONALD TRUMP!
He is simply trying to protect the sanctity of the vote. The Left know that  the only way they can  defeat Donald Trump  is by stealing the election! The easiest  way to do that is to provide for fool proof  fraudulent voting - ( mail in voting)!
I am sure these presidents behind closed doors are close. They are all HONORABLE men. Of course they have  made mistakes just like we all have. But they have never divided this country more than Donald Trump! It is not who they are, as made evident by today! One love! Aliciadine
You mean like Donald Trump is doing right now? I don't sink to the level of what you are. UNTIL you get EVIL OUT OF YOUR HEART AND SPIRIT, You will NEVER UNDERSTAND what is NEEDED FOR the United States of America to be the country that it is created to be!WAKE UP!YOU ARE BLINDED!
Wow that SOB really likes to hear himself talk. And they say Trump is a narcissist.
Please Pres. Trump. People say that this is just a joke you are making. But how are we to know what is a joke and what is not. Don’t make the citizens of our great country guess about which things you really mean.
Yeah except Trump couldn’t even eulogize his father without talking about himself the whole time. I can imagine him speaking about Herman Cain and filling it full of campaign BS
I think the thing is, Trump hears these nutty theories and maybe he starts to believe them. Then he decides to tweet about it. He’s either a fool, or trolling. Or a combination of both.
Trump has screwed up every thing he worked on, UNFIT.
Beat cancer and got killed because of a Trump rally. Covid karma can be a bitch when you don't believe.
Herman Cain is no longer of any use to Trump so he’s simply moved on.
Cain attended President Donald Trump's June 20 rally in Tulsa, where he tweeted a photo of himself surrounded by people not wearing masks.
Racism, smoking, being a trump supporter all come to mind for me.
I glanced at the chart quickly and thought it was tRump’s signature. But then again, it is.
We must do MORE THAN JUST TALK ABOUT THE divisiveness and ills of Trump. He MUST BE VOTED OUT along with other members of Congress who are divisive and DO NOT WANT The United States of America to be TRULY UNITED AS ONE GREAT NATION! ONE LOVE! Aliciadine
Work is temporary because our lives are temporary. This nation is made up of flawed people trying to figure it out on this journey we call life. The difference is that some men like Bush, Clinton and Obama have a shared leadership in unifying America. DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT!
There is only one style of voting that is fault proof. The red China 100% all in favor. Which by the way is what Trump wish for his presidency. US goes from leader to joke of the world in 4 yrs.
Trump doesn't joke, remember? He said so.
Trump doesn't joke, remember?
Indeed, I think after looking at this picture, although these men made mistakes as well, their intent to make America great were something that they shared. I think many of us realize the MISTAKE in having LITTLE MAN DONALD TRUMP IN OFFICE!
DONALD TRUMP has done more DAMAGE TO AMERICA in 3 years than ALL of these presidents TOGETHER. They were all two term presidents. These are men who believe in America! Donald Trump believes in  are TOO IGNORANT TO SEE THAT Trump is using you!WAKE UP!
georgia is definitely in the running too. brian kemp is one of trump's personal scrotum polishers and he already corrupted the election here to get into the governor's office so... what's stopping him from taking it to the next level?
Wait...so it is safe for kids to go back to school. It is safe to reopen businesses, but it ISN'T safe to go vote?  Typical GOP/Trump logic
The sad part about this statement from you Aysh is that you are TOO IGNORANT to know when someone DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU! Donald Trump does NOT CARE ABOUT YOU! He is the MOST DIVISIVE PRESIDENT IN OUR HISTORY!Calling women bitches and whores, mexicans rapists and thugs, WAKE UP!
I say this to you Renny Guarde, LITTLE MAN DONALD TRUMP has called women like your mother bitches and whores, Mexicans rapists, and even talked about white people. Check how little you think of yourself by voting this racist, natcissistic bully back into office. I don't THINK SO!
I say this to you Krista and to every women in the USA. This Little man Donald Trump has called women on several occasions bitches and whores, he has made fun of a person in a wheelchair, called Mexican people rapists and thugs and black athletes assholes. Check yourselves!
Trump is connected from how he downplayed the virus for so long and his followers listened to him and now we have prominent figures in the GOP either having it or in the worst case die from it. He is responsible.
Trump supports the police and the Democrats hate the police, that's all you need to know for this election. #CopsforTrump
McConnell is arguably worse than Trump
These tweets seem to be stirring up the EVIL within you. Good and decent spirits cannot be amongst the EVIL inside of you! It seems that Donald Trump was NOT INVITED to the homegoing of John Lewis because he stood for things that Trump has NO CLUE ABOUT, INTEGRITY, PEACE, CLASS!
I think Trump is Following in Hitlers footsteps😢😢😢
I haven’t checked but I’m just assuming this was when all of the mis-reporting was occurring and that since late June/early July the numbers have only gotten better and therefore doesn’t fit trump=bad narrative. Just like when they used photos from the Obama admin and changed tim
Sorry, he didn't care enough about his family or staff.  Masks will not be mandatory at the event, which will be attended by President Trump. PEOPLE ARE FED UP!’  That tweet remains on Cain’s Twitter feed.
Hopefully this will wake Trump up!
No this is not Trump's fault and in no way I support Trump. He should have used common sense but instead he tried to make a political point.
What if that was the point. With so many in the media questioning whether the election could get delayed, now that Trump is suggesting it the media and the left will state unequivocally it won’t be delayed.
No, nothing like that, actually. Those bankrupted companies were part of the Trump Org. Was he invlolved I. Daily management? Maybe not, but it was a lot different than a name sponsorship on a stadium
OMG I needed this laugh, thank you my dear! We must ALL WORK TOGETHER to get TRUMP far away from America! He is tearing away at the fabric and leading us in the WRONG DIRECTION! R.I.P. John Lewis! love you as the MAN OF GOD YOU ARE! ONE LOVE! Aliciadine
The Postmaster needs to be called in immediately for a public hearing. Carriers are already alleging that he's ordered a slow down. Also get him on record about what Trump is claiming too. It's crucial!
The government doesn’t “give” anything. It takes it from taxpayers and redistributes it to others. It is welfare and arguably theft. Both parties are at fault, and it would be congress passing it. Trump would sign or veto.
Obama was more successful than Trump as POTUS by every measure. Even before Covid, Trump’s GDP wasn’t growing any faster than Obama’s did. And now it just had the worst drop in history. Sad, but completely predictable
Why isn't the Postmaster being called to testify immediately to address Trump's claims? Make him go on record about allegations of already slowing down the mail too.
Call the Postmaster in immediately for a televised hearing before the house. Get him on record now to address the allegations that he's already slowing down the mail and ask if he agrees with Trump's voter mail fraud claims.

NO!!! Not poor taste at all. People like this (under pressure or not) defy NON-PARTISAN science to politicize an apolitical PANDEMIC in order to placate the unplacatable (trump). Maybe if a few more of these type deaths occurred their psychotic leader would yield.
is anyone else in awe that Donald Trump actually became our president or no?

Trump is a murderer. Plain and simple.
And he’s dead because of a fucking trump rally that never should have happened. Yep! The blood is on your hands
Don’t go to Trump rallies. Wear a mask. This virus is deadly serious. Prayers for his family.
In fact the whole Trump economy is flying  In the wrong direction...
He had beaten cancer years before. He was a health risk for COVID because of that.  The cancer didn’t kill Trump did.
RIP.   I’m filled with rage at Trump. The Tulsa rally was purely to feed his vanity.  He encouraged his supporters to scorn the most basic protective measures against the virus. How many good people will we lose because of this pathological narcissist?
Sorry Henry, Joe told you he wanted to delay the election. Stop giving trump the benefit of the doubt, he eventually says the quiet part out loud.

Just sold at ~$44. Not a bad chunk of change for minimal effort. Thanks for the advice!
So have these other black voices for Trump been tested??!! 🤨
Nah, you not gonna try and frame this. He died of COVID-19.  Trump msg killing people.
Trump’s vanity killed a great American, Herman Cain. Burn the GOP to the ground because they desensitized us to Trump’s abuse of power.
Any comments on the narcissist whose vanity rally and anti-mask recklessness that led to this great man’s death? Trump caused this

Donald Trump.- #quote #image
Soooo- now Democrats run the Senate and create their bills. Right Dementia Donnie. The GOP is doing all of the cutting, and everyone knows it. They’re all signing their own unemployment papers! Can’t wait.
But it was no big deal to the media clowns unti suggested by Trump.
I'm telling you, there will come a day when we'll say, "remember when we elected Trump for four years?" It'll be like when you tell stories from college with that tone of "it was crazy fun, but I was so stupid and how did I live through that."
Remember when Trump couldn't fire Comey, pardon Stone, or sell nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia?
This is why I want every single Trump enabler to be voted out.
In the Trump era, it’s quaintly funny that Biden was previously able to take the “gaffe master” title when political competition was far less   Biden finally found a proper use of his “gaffes” now that “says what he means” is important to the electorate
Of course we will have an election and this will feed the conspiracy theory of “what if Trump won’t leave?”
What the actual FVCK??? Someone needs to get this motherfucker OUT!!
He wants to delay the election so he can stay in    Trump knows he is going to lose at this point and unable to change that
Hahahahaha! You only think they are voting for trump. Wait until they vote.
lol right?  Supreme Court: "You can't do that"  Trump: "Too bad. What are you gonna do?"
Why doesn't this tweet say:  "Only Congress can set the date of a presidential general election, contrary to Trump's tweet. The election will still be on Nov 3rd, 2020."
DAMNIT WE NEED TO GET RID OF TRUMP NOW
The Thurmond rule don't mean shit &amp; that lame duck session will see more rules made, judges appointed, pardons issued than your head can comprehend.  Trump's presidency won't end on Election Day even if it happens and even if he loses. Trust me. You think it's bad now? Just wait.
Plus I'm allergic to zinc. Maybe that is why Trump's face gets so red.
"Don't Count Trump Out" - for the record, I don't, mostly because Roger Stone is a free man and The National Enquirer still publishes.
The Democrats are good at a lot of things; fighting back and using the media to their advantage like Trump does, is not their forte. They prefer taking the high road. This country is just a few steps away from absolute fascism, they need to stop their measured resources &amp; FIGHT
I agree. That's why I said that's what trump and his racist bigots mean but there is also a big dollop of classism mixed in as well.
Yes, I’m not a fan of that either. But it’s the way Trump says things that only fuels the fires of tribalism. Actions indeed speak louder than words but when you’re the president your words carry a tremendous amount of weight.

Lindsay Graham is one of Trumps henchman who he has in his pocket. Lindsay Graham is the man who stated over my dead body will I GIVE Americans who need it most right now, the extra 600 per week in unemployment. To him and other Trump supporters. YOU ARE AS IGNORANT AS THEY ARE!
I hope I’ll control the chaos that all of Carmen Sandiego’s crooks would’ve caused in Portland now that Oregon’s governor made the ICE &amp; CBP agents withdraw from the city.  I imagine that only Trump &amp; those federal agents would provoke V.I.L.E. to put up a fight.

Senator Lindsey Graham are you a racist? Because based on your ads that is what people of color are saying. America is looking at Donald Trump and anyone who is associated with him with regards to the poor handling of race relations! I can see you also need to be VOTED OUT!LEARN
Nobody is lying to pollsters. That makes zero sense and if anything Trump supporters are super proud of their ignorance.

You should see how heavy the lies have been in Florida, a vital swing state that if Trump loses, there's almost no hope. They want you to think everyone in Florida is dying.
Accounts like Ned are one of the ways entities use social media to effect people's minds. He's obviously anti-Trump and wants you to think Trump supporters are all like this. Don't be fooled.
Bernie supporters are worse than Trump supporters with their delusions. My goodness. Biden won because more people, by far, voted for him. Not any DNC conspiracy. Socialism isn’t popular here, maybe try an actual socialist country if that’s what you want .
He's obviously doing this on purpose to make Trump supporters look bad. Don't pay him any mind.
Hey bro, just take this down... I'm all for Trump, but this is the liberals think Trump supporters are all stupid. Please stop acting dumb. This makes us look bad.
Dude, I'm all for voting for Trump, but sorry to say, things like this are why the liberals think all Trump supporters are crazy. He's great, but please calm down. He's not Jesus.
Exactly. These Bernouts have a lot less power than they think they do. They’d rather help Trump get re-elected than admit that Socialism isn’t popular in the USA.
Always brother.
Spoken like a clueless, entitled white man. Have fun with that. Just remember that in Trump's Murica, you're just a tiny bit less entitled every single day. There will come a day when you'll be treated like us, then we'll see how "flatulent" it is.
Always.  I haven't caught you replying to any of the lies so I can't say why you support Biden. I don't get it, but again, that's your right. Don't know your age, big I was once a Bernie supporter in my 20s, so I can sort of relate.

Think about this: the OLDEST president ever at the START of their presidency was  at age 70. Reagan was 73 at the start of his 2nd term and dems HAMMERED him for it.  is going to be FIVE YEARS OLDER than that. Sadly, the mental capacity is just not there.
He understands it’s a dog whistle. He’s choosing to act like he doesn’t get it because “how could Trump ever say something racist”
You think Kim Jong Un is going to dote on him as an old man and give away concessions to us when he may not even know what country he's speaking to? That's frightening man. It's not just slip-of-a-word mistakes like DJT. This is on a different level.
Look, I'm not saying the guy is a bad speaker. But he's almost 78. At times, he doesn't even know where he's at. He can't remember questions being asked.

Trumpism. Trump-o-nomics
Nobody deserves to die because of their politics. It’s sad that he was willing to risk dying for likes of Trump.

I have pondered whether he would resign on 1/19/2021 so Pence could pardon him for everything. But then realized this is unlikely because pardon implies he did something wrong. Trump is incapable of admitting fault.
Does this mean you think when Trump said at one of his rally's  'Maybe we should ask the Russians for Hillary's emails', it was proof of collusion?  Are you that gullible Bill?
That means Trump next ??? Lol everybody dying from COVID but him
Neither side, seems exceptionally trusting.    How about this,       To keep Trump from cheating, we require Voter ID.  ??    If not,  why?
Oh I got a lot of enthusiasm for Trump! I will bubblewrap myself and bounce my ass to the polls if need be, to vote that sorry ass out of our White House! So you’re half right...lots of enthusiasm🤨
Then good lord what does that make you and every other Trump supporter?!
Hmmm. This isn't hard to figure out... Trump is in on it. He's playing all y'all like fools. There's no such thing as an honest politician at that level. You don't get to BILLIONAIRE STATUS by being a nice, honest person.
What is wrong with people? I have to believe they were like this all along but trump made it acceptable to be filled with hatred. But it was so nice to watch everyone with good sense at John “Good Trouble” Lewis’ service in the ATL.

To be clear, Trump can't delay it and the reason he can't has nothing to do with what Nancy tweeted. So best to focus on safe and secure elections.
President Trump, please make this drug over the counter
Not defending Mark here since he’s more than capable of defending himself. Just want to make one observation: you can still be a conservative and not like Trump. No, not including those Lincoln Project nutcases.
someone gets it. The ultimate goal is just part of establishing the permanent pessimism and distrust in the system. Even if he loses, (which he doesn't want to do) he and his party have been planting the seeds of an anti-democratic support base. this is bigger than trump.
the ACA and obamacare are the exact same thing. how many people on the political right, including those benefiting from it, still don't know? Those people, are exactly who trump is talking to.
It's another way to destroy Trump!
Really is quite the phenomenon here. Liberals complaining that the media isn't asking enough hard questions. Nevermind that we watch White House Press Corp members literally arguing with Trump every chance they get as they attempt to advocate for their position, not the truth.
Politico Editor Fantasizes About Trump Quitting the Race
I’m not voting at all this time around if trump and Biden are the only options. My conscience won’t let me vote for old, senile pedophiles... So it depends on your perspective. Trump supporters say it’s a vote for Biden. Biden supporters say it’s a vote for trump.
It's incredible to watch the transformation this handle has taken since the election of trump. Before '16, though I didn't agree with the politics it pushed, I respected most of the opinions. Reasonable, thoughtful, and truly conservative. Trump has taken you down with him. #SAD

Perspective | My entire state votes by mail. Sorry, Mr. President. It works great.  it should be this way EVERYWHERE in the US!
Well, back then we weren't so broken or needing to be fixed, we needed leadership that we could respect and depend on and we had it. Now due to lack of leadership, we have over 150,000 dead Americans. How about team tRump fix that.
In the terms of income I am considered poor. I own a small business and my wife works with special need children. Neither of us are bad people or criminals. In Trump’s world I guess we would be. It saddens me that there are people who openly judge someone based on income alone.
People mad about mail-in votes and Trump delaying the election like the lizard people haven’t already decided who the next president is... #smh
Trump? A big question. Putin?   A big question.  But Trump/Putin, well that's a whole new dynamic duo.  Tssk,Tssk, yep, a whole new can of worms
He was a grown ass man capable of making his own decisions. Anyone who listens to trump is just as ignorant as he is.
Her parents are named Trump? That's odd.
I call it Trump’s America.
You mean like what happened to Herman Cain at a Trump Rally?
No not at all, kinda my point, but thanks for playing the "Let's blame Trump for everything" game. You lost BTW.
So  says something stupid but more so than normal! He then goes even further ans says something comepletely crazy so you forget about the first one and it works every time!
No Nancy, we are the Trump supporters!
Stop falling for the BS, Trump throws out shiny balls and you spend so much energy chasing after it you lose focus on everything else.
I agree! Look at what the republicans did in North Carolina! I live in a red state and I trust a snake more than I do the Republicans running my state. I’ll be voting in person if I have to bubble wrap myself and bounce my ass to the polls! Trump has got to go!
You know, Trump didn't close it OR open it, each governor did. Were we being ravaged before the closing? During the closing?
Calling ppl racist when it isn't there is disrespectful to real victims of real racists. The casual over-use of the word can only lead to diminished significance. Referring to "uneducated white ppl" or "Trump supporters" as u have done is very Bigoted. Maybe examine urself 1st.
Trump’s tweet caused an INSTANT meltdown in the media...#NineLineNews #HappeningNow #USA #Election2020 #Trump
The Trump Slump
I will sell my soul to the devil if it means Trump will be out of office.
Michelle and Barack Obama Use New Podcast To Take Subtle Swipes at Trump
Donald trump didn’t have a damn thing to do with it! Everything was already on its trajectory when Trump squeaked his ass in to our White House. If you’d do a little research you’d know that. All Trump has done is get a big tax cut for himself and his rich cronies. Sit down!
Allow me to translate....don't vote for Trump
I think #Trump and his cronies REALLY think that they can do this. They cannot.
Can you imagine four more years of the left and Trump going at it? Just how many impeachment trials can they complete in a year’s time? 2, maybe 3?
Oh no America didn't fail Herman Cain he failed himself. He made the decision and was willing to sacrifice his life for Trump. Mission Accomplished.
Meanwhile, Trump tweets...
Yes, it’s called attending a Trump Rally without a mask or social distancing and it’s a GOP thing.
Don't blame Donald Trump. Herman Cain was not a child. He decided that going to worship his idol at a rally was more important than his own health.
You mean the cancer that he recovered from nine years ago and then decided to sacrifice himself at the altar of Donald Trump. Yeah we know that.
Trump administration work so hard to to recend anything that Obama put in place. Shit is too sad.
Study after study is finding that large percentages of people—namely Trump supporters, per the research—not only believe coronavirus conspiracy theories, but multiple *conflicting* theories. Thus: "Attempts at debunking them individually will likely fail."
All these politicians within feet of Trump getting COVID and this nigga still don’t got it. Life not fair.
you wish  Trump floats unprecedented idea of delaying election, which he cannot do
I thought republicans had a magic cure for Covid? Trump didn’t share it with his friend?
In direct opposition to last month’s #SCOTUS decision, the current admin says it will continue to defy the federal court order compelling full restoration of #DACA. We must restore DACA now &amp; secure a pathway to #Citizenship for all DACA recipients.
Donald Trump should resign.  Pass it on.
went to Tulsa rally with Trump...no mask....too bad  Herman Cain, 2012 GOP Presidential Candidate And Businessman, Dies At Age 74
Fight for Medicare for All, Earl. No one needs to be told Trump sucks.
Herman Cain was too old to be this stupid. These black Trump supporters love Donald Trump so much that they are willing to die for him. Oh well file this under play stupid games win stupid prizes.
So, Trump is so jealous of the attention Obama will get from giving a thoughtful and inspiring eulogy for John Lewis that he is threatening to illegally hold up our election to remove him from office. #NobodyLikesTrump
Georgia is a tough one to figure out. In my area, IF you see a sign, it’s a Trump sign.  ...and they’re abrasively large.
It is not a coincidence that this tweet from Trump comes the day our nation is laying John Lewis to rest and Maxwell’s deposition was scheduled to be unsealed.
The Trump that would be King.  He's got to go. #TrumpIsARacist  #TrumpsGestapo #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
FANCY NANCY: Trump Supporters, Republicans Have ‘Disdain’ For Working Am...
This is just a new form of discrimination. On average people of color earn less, which means many of us can’t live a “suburban lifestyle” because Trump thinks we’re criminals.
This is pretty drastic. Is that b/c Trump thinks it has value or they just don’t want the stockpile used for COVID19? Or to get ppl to use the expensive COVID19 treatment
Trump floats November election delay - but he can’t do that  #SmartNews
Sorry to hear about  dying. He tried to challenge the establishment with his positive politics long before Trump came along. Sadly, Trump won where Cain couldn't. But I firmly believe to this day that Cain would have been a superior president to Trump.
Someone should make a list of all those who have lost all credibility in the Trump era from stuff like this.  It would be long, I know, but still helpful for future cable TV programming.
May trump continue to silence Moscow Mitch.
Herman Cain, trump supporter, who contracted Covid at trump's Tulsa rally, has died from the disease.  Condolences to his family and loved ones.  Republicans, take note of Cain's affliction and passing, and learn from it.  #NoMoreKarens
I used to think my ex-wife was the best at pushing buttons but she was a amateur compared to President Donald J. Trump.  He Tweets and the DemocRATs start banging their heads against the wall, next thing you know...  California has an earthquake.  Can't make this stuff up...
As  just said on the podcast yesterday, Trump has lowered the bar so much that it is underground.
So you’ll be voting for trump instead of the most progressive major party platform in history that’s built by a partnership between the progressive and moderate wings?
Anyone ever play Basketball? Trump just did a "Head Fake" - maybe read Sun Tsu, Keep enemies off balance?  Prez tossed a baited hook out into the Lake to see how many gullible fish would bite, about the 100th time he has had a chuckle watching them waste time on nothing? JMHO.
Notice how all the articles just tell you the economy 'shrank at a 33% rate'?  They don't tell you the growth rate. I'm guessing that's because it is still positive - we aren't in a recession.  That's tremendous news for TRUMP!
I have already made that case. Trump is a Republican Johnny come lately.  The Republican's have been unified against "socialism" since FDR.
Trump floats election 'delay' amid claim of voting fraud (from
Trump floats 'delay' of 2020 election amid claims of voting fraud
Trump is such a fucking troll. To tweet this shit on the day of John Lewis' funeral.
They called me the other day mistaking my phone for my son's who is in college now getting the full indoctrination process. Luckily I raised him right so he's have answered the same as me. I had the little lib crying by the end of the call because of my staunch support for Trump.
I need Trump to break me off one more time with that check
I have noticed that today's morning twitter is filled with Donald Trump, and that could well be why his preposterous "delay the election" tweet opens the day.  He has now got center stage, which is exactly how he survives.
Trump floated delaying the election 15 minutes after the GDP figures came out.
Blown away at how flagrantly partisan he came across! And then to be wrong on top of that? Just crazy.  ...Trump isn’t the only one blowing up norms—his adversaries are matching him point for point.  ...AND the border of our greatest ally is still closed to American travel 😭
On the heels of a successful push by militarized police against leftist protesters in a northwest province, U.S. President Donald Trump takes authoritarian tact of suggesting to delay election as regime loyalists remain silent or complicit in his whims.
President Trump floats election 'delay' amid claims of voting fraud
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: Pres. Trump is the ultimate test to our constitution.
Thank God, the dates are set by Congress and not Trump. It won’t be long before he claims he can do it on his own.
You mean other than he is trump?  Doesn't that cover it?
What type of leader suggests altering the election?  A dictator.  trump today---President Trump on Thursday suggested delaying November's presidential election  Nuff said.  Welcome to the end of the US as we know it.
I love how Trump can so easily push the loony left's buttons.  I'm sure they started drinking before breakfast today.  Kudos.
Donald Trump calls for delay to 2020 US presidential election
it was rude, disrespectful- the man who said Barr was not fit to utter Lewis's name-they were completely to a man hostile.  Barr need not have appeared-a picture of he and trump pinned to the wall and all the darts they can throw.  I vote, i remember
and the  claim they want to restore the economy and “defeat” CV19. The problem they have no plan and no real message, except lies.
Are we really going to do this today. Donald Trump does not have the power to delay the election. The election will be held on November 3rd. As usual he is talking nonsense.
Is this how Trump “drains the swamp?”
Wow, the WSJ, and I thought they were squarely on Trump’s side. Guess not this time.
Also, many members of the group are arguing whether an old WWE clip of Trump smacking Vince McMahon is real, apparently completely unaware Trump used to regularly appear at wrestling events. These are the people who think their “research” will save the world.
Trump knows his Russian Masters can’t hack Vote By Mail, so he will attack this safe and secure method of voting.
First the house passed their bill in May, you did not act on it. Second, the White House and the Senate GOP are causing the failure by failing to talk to the Dems or act in good faith. Like Trump you can’t make your lies true by claiming the other side is to blame.
The ignorance of you and your sycophantic followers is a sight to behold. Surely, calling those who support Trump "cultists" gets great play on your Twitter feed, but it doesn't lessen the understanding of what is happening right now. Cuomo's "blunder" killed thousands, right?
Reader letters, Thursday: Questioning President Trump's competence
All day n night! There is no other choice life=Biden death= Trump #SuburbsForBiden
Your just a sheep getting gaslite by tRump and the FoxNews/ "Q" crowd....good job sheep
Back in March you were promising us TWO MILLION dead.  You told us our cities would look like the burning of Atlanta scene in 'Gone With the Wind'.    The fact is we lost mostly people in nursing homes because DemocRATS put infected people in them.  Thank God for Trump!
Dean...not one Democrat gave AG Barr a breath to speak yesterday...your actions were despicable &amp; deplorable...you should all be ashamed of how you spoke &amp; acted. AG Barr kept a calm, cool head in the face of arrogance! I side w/ AG Barr, Trump, Our Constitution &amp; Country
Hey how come you didn’t endorse Bernie so we could beat the snot out of Trump and maybe get like some help down here?
trump
So, your actual issue is someone more successful than you exercising their 1st Amendment rights. And Trump has crossed so many lines we’re going to have to hire a team of archeologists to find them again once we drag him out of the White House. But, you’re ok with that.
Have you ever heard of N.U.N.Y.A.? As in, the reason Donald J. Trump has not released his tax returns is because it is NUNYA damn business.
Your reporting is biased. Any reasonable person can see that the violence is from the left, not because of President Trump but because of the lefts hatred for him. Liberals deserve other liberals. Have at it. Natural selection.
The videos of him groping children are real though🤮 a couple of doctored photos don’t change that fact. Biden is as gross as trump
The death toll from the coronavirus in the U.S. hit 150,000 on Wednesday, by the far the highest in the world, according to the tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. --&gt;&gt;
Good. Trump's got more important things to do.
#blueMAGA Biden supporters are helping trump win more than any other group of people. Trying to bully anyone who criticizes the senile pedophile they worship.
Care to comment ?
I guess we will see...
#RacistTrump   Trump again attempts to stoke racial divisions in housing message
BS  Fact check: Trump misleadingly suggests the White House has largely followed Fauci's recommendations
Sometimes it takes working with someone..getting to know him..to have your eyes opened to the character of that person.  Many people voted for Trump and after his 4 years are choosing NOT to support him for another term.  Character &amp; job performance has not been what many hoped
Tearing down people's hope is useless and cruel if you're not going to guide people to a solution. Why destroy what little glimmer of light people have?   Also, Biden is FAR from perfect, but do you genuinely believe he's equivalent to Trump?
Trump needs to suspend habeas corpus, impeach them,  revoke their citizenship and deport all of them.
Lord have mercy on this Country 🙏   Did President Trump say he thought she had and important voice and other than that he knows nothing about her??? I repeat..Lord have mercy on this Country 🙏
President Trump we all know what it is is false they’re going to try to do everything they can to rig it to where they want it George Soros is the one that’s leaning and he’s let all the rest in because he’s a billionaire !   $$$$$$$$$ Just for the MONEY 💴
Three of four former presidents will attend the funeral of John Lewis tomorrow.  Missing is the former president who is 95.  One current president will not.  Why would any African-American support trump?
I agree with Ryan. I don’t think Biden is any better than Trump. And a ton of people blame Bernie supporters for trump winning bc we didn’t support Hillary soon enough I guess. Who knows
If we get Trump it may take a decade.  If we let the Dem party take over a century
It is entirely possible that when Trump said Texans love America so much that they "couldn't breath" it was just an extremely loud dog whistle. #GeorgeFloyd
I hope and pray that they all vote for Trump. This Republican would help if he saw a policeman in need. To walk or drive by and do nothing when a person needs help is wrong.
Brought to you by the guy convicted of housing discrimination-- Trump asserted his efforts to prevent low-income housing from being built in affluent areas prevents suburbanites from being “bothered or financially hurt” by  minorities.--
They playing u?  Home skewled r u?  Sigh.  trump does luv em dumb, don't he?
The people who were bullied into voting for her (like me) still got blamed for trump winning😂 I hate #blueMAGA
Stop it damn it...stop it. I’m so sick and tired of every little “nook and cranny” article that is merely meant to stir up Democrat in-fighting. Like  says, we know how to lose. Republicans stick to the plan regardless! Why do you think trump is still there!
He would've sooner spit in Trump's face than disgrace the military &amp; this country by giving it to that piece of human waste that deferred repeatedly and disrespects our military daily. Shame on you. You disrespect our soldiers by wanting to give that to one who hasn't earned it.
Trump just said Texans love America so much "they couldn't breathe."  What does it mean to love your country so much that you can't breathe? Very confused by this.

Yep, while telling them why not to vote for tRump the entire time.
I’m certain that Trump pays Herschel Walker.
The airwaves here are thick with swampy, nasty attack ads from Trump, Perdue, and Loeffler. Panic is setting in.
All this nonsense stops on 11/4/2020 when Trump is re-elected in a landslide.
Opinion | Three big takeaways from Trump’s awful new admission about Putin  how could any veteran, or any non-veteran patriotic American support him after this?  How?
During their last telephone conversation  did not raise the issue of Russian targeting of US troops in Afghanistan with his buddy Putin. Trump was being told to remove troops from Germany. Now he is complying.
we been knew that trump supports gentrification. dispicable.
REP. JAYAPAL: Bill Barr is Trump’s ‘Henchman,’ He’s Only ‘Activated’ Whe...
Kelly! Lindsey is scared just like you. Being held accountable for enabling a criminal president can be a very scary thing. Especially, when y’all have been committing crimes just like tRUmp for some time now. Best start shopping for another country to asylum in, like N Korea.
I’ve seen polling putting them dead even again, even with 150k dead and Trump’s litany of other offenses. All Trump has to do is promise to legalize weed at the last second and it’s game over.
There are two explanations for headlines like this, and "the media is out to get Trump" is the wrong one.
Thomas you are wealthy with white privilege you know nothing about real life. You like Trump have been institutionalized your whole life. I feel sorry for you.
Trump dismisses virus aid for cities, lashes out at GOP
Spurred on by President Donald Trump’s demand to pull troops out of Germany, the U.S. will bring about 6,400 forces home and shift about 5,400 to other countries in Europe, U.S. defense officials said Wednesday--&gt;&gt;

You don't understand science do you The only reason for another "Study" was that the authors of the first rejected independent review of theirs This proves nothing It is like trump saying, I have eliminated X regulation, when in fact all he did was say look at how to eliminate it
Fred Trump had demon sperm.
I just wonder what secrets Putin gave Trump on Bill Barr. Why would he completely decimate what I understand was a good reputation among legal scholars?
Perhaps it’s because Dr. Fauci is doing his job and you Mr. Trump are not! Just an guess.
Kev, Ntilikina Islanders will hold a luau for you when Frank becomes a 3-D force under Thibs next season.
Dr. Fauci is a world renowned physician &amp; pandemic expert.  is jealous because Fauci is more liked. So Trump’s new favorite doc is a voodoo doc who claims alien DNA &amp; demon sperm are the causes of our health concern. Please vote in November.
They have been playing theses ads for weeks in Georgia about if you elect Joe Biden police are not going to be able to protect you. The funny thing is they are using footage of these things currently happening while Trump is president.
Best quote: “Let me repeat for emphasis: It passed in May! Trump and McConnell did nothing in May, June or July.”    Do not care about the people, but they enable trump.
Do people think Trump is writing his own prescriptions? Sheesh.If the President of the United States Dr is writing scripts for the leader of the free world, why are people trying to discredit you? Why aren’t reporters trying to interview his Dr? What has happened to common sense?
To help his business across the street, The Trump Hotel🤔
not at all- obama spied on trump and the campaign, wire tapped illegally reporters- he is an icon to you- the standard of what a president should be- so no
#BarrHearing the barr hearings highlighted no need for the hated subject to appear- a picture of barr and Trump (because after all he was the real target) could have been tacked on the wall and boxes of darts passed out to the members.
It has been said there are only 2 choices in the upcoming election:  1. Biden, which means the Right either starts a civil war or we become a communist state.  2. Trump, which means the Left either starts a civil war or we become a fascist state.   New Zealand is looking good now

Sen. Lindsay Graham campaign ad alters image of Jamie Harrison to make his skin darker.  Sen. David Perdue campaign ad alters image of Jon Ossoff to make his nose bigger.  Trump ads looks more like a First Alert burglar alarm ad.  It is clear Republicans are using fear tactics.
Stop falling for his distractions. We want investigative journalism. Not commentary on his Tweets.  Yes,  is straight-up propaganda for Trump but your excessive coverage also helps him. Enough.
Only the ones voting for Trump
Trump was right all along
We can prove they met. Proving what was discussed is another matter. However, it should be pursued by the media, but I doubt it will. The media thinks they can use #COVID19 to beat Trump, so they won't do anything that could promote a conspiracy story.
Trump doesn't  control the House, different branch. He was impeached for Ukraine BS. He did release the transcripts of the call. Have you read all the investigations or just what Adam Schiff said? Big difference.
You're definitely a gnat. I was not worried about Trump and foreign governments.
Stop....you are showing your ignorance!  I am sure you watch Fox, listen to Rush, and read Breitbart.  Democrats are not communist...If Trump is re-elected we will all be under martial law.
John Lewis boycotted Trump's inauguration, he got a nice Tweet, more than I would have given the racist.
Do you remember the peaceful standing rock protests? Shit like this happened before trump. Biden proves he’s still racist when he makes dumb ass comments abt trump being the first racist president and the whole “you ain’t black” comment.Defending him is trump supporter behavior
We are getting ready to have an eviction crisis unlike anything we’ve had to deal with in this country, and brown, black, and trans folks will be hit hardest and fastest.And remember, Trump admin says trans people have no right to a homeless shelter.
Robert, I lived in NYC In late 80's &amp; 90's for a billionairess Worked with Trump on a fee projects. He is the greatest.  President of my lifetime &amp; my Mom's, she just turned 96. We will vote, in person, no mail in
Perhaps soon we'll see the banning of political parties and individual politicians, like they do in the countries Trump admires.

He allowed them to show their hand. And they think Barr is trying to help Trump's campaign. 🤣 Lately, I'm beginning to think they also want Trump re-elected.
Pshh....youll defend anything wont you....the crzy doctor lady, its obvious, she is batshit crazy...  Amd as far as her tweet was sarcasm.....pshh yeah you wish it was....you can wish all you want,  she is crazy, tRump is batshit crzy and so are his voters...yall guna cry 11/4

Trump administration won't accept new DACA applications
So far, just projected to be a tropical storm. But the real issue is that it's only July 28 and we're already up to letter I. #ClimateCrisis IS real, except to #Trump and his cronies
I’m so fucking tired of Barr and Trump blaming Obama for their short comings . Obama has been gone for over 3 years, if you haven’t figured out a better plan yet than you are the problem!
Because Trump said it would work &amp; they would rather die than say he was right
Exactly as I said back in March. We would reach the point where trump used the models based on doing literally nothing, to say any number less than that is a success. fuck man, this reality is useless, when there are still people that think this is okay.
Busey to Trump: “I want my son”
I didn’t even know who he was. Apparently, he still has pro Trump stuff on his website. Ironic. Whatever. Did you get to see any of the Bill Barr hearing?
Bill Barr is Trump's Goebbels. Welcome to America in 2020. #BarrResign #BarrHearing #TrumpsGestapo
I hereby choose to believe that Eric Trump actually can't tell Donald Sr from Donald Jr
At this point, I believe, Trump is less and less powerful, and so, who does that empower.  Trump is walking around Gaga, bumping into walls, and Barr is running the law enforcement arm of America.
Napolitano is obviously blackmailable. That has been my conclusion. He did an about face on his support of President Trump
Twitter has temporarily halted President Donald Trump’s son from tweeting on its site after he shared a video riddled with unsupported claims about the coronavirus Monday--&gt;&gt;
He’s not dumb, he’s a crook just like 45. His son-in-law works for Trump his daughters in the treasury department, he’s a liar and a crook just like 45
If Trump "happens to think" any drug works that's a pretty good indication you should stay the hell away from that drug.
Trump's plan to bring back American manufacturing jobs is apparently to loan out tens of millions of taxpayer dollars to American companies. Capitalism, baby!
Biden is the cycle, he had his chance during the Obama administration,  they threw out a Anchor, Took Trump to recover the economy,  Biden would not know the first thing about recovery
no, i didnt mean to accuse you of being upset. can we find daylight between antifa and liberalism? protests and riots? i saw where a black trump supporter was shot recently. i guess BLM didnt care about that! not much separation. its either blue or red, these days..
Huh? She was hammering him for not knowing about Trump's tweet and the vile things displayed in MI. Then claimed he didn't do any in MI because he somehow supported it. I don't want the Feds involved in everything, but they do have a role to protect Fed property and civil rights
How can anyone vote for this bunch?  If I were Trump I would never allow such a spectacle again!
Mr.Trump  There is a difference between riots and protests. Both have had police called out on them both have had military forced used on them the difference, a riot destroys privet property A protest pickets and shouts or refuses to move or refuses to comply with law enforcement
My deal is that he is the US AG, not the MI AG. You can't complain that Trump is a dictator, and Barr his enforcer, then complain when he isn't aware of a particular protest in one State, that's the message the Democrat side was pushing in this "hearing"
Hey, don’t you have a tRump-embarrassing tape that you’re going to show us?
Current anarchy is pushing median further left, real revolution is global. Dilute power of wealth, corporations worship poor &amp; not their owners. Trump pushed median right which was bad for global revolution, so anarchy pushes back left. Bi polar party politics manic Trump?

That may be what you think. I’ve never heard that Trump paid people to attend his rallies. You are the first person that I’ve ever heard of suggesting such a scenario. That’s something that Joe Biden should do given his miserable turn outs. Have a nice day now.
you have been silent for 3 yrs while trump has ruined this country. His lack of leadership has caused almost 150k dead. Yet the right has said nothing.
no no no, let the trump supporters get killed by the angry black spirits who live in the water after they were kicked out of forsyth county
This thread is very interesting... and all those absentee ballots maybe what decides everything  "What happens if Donald Trump refuses to accept the election results?"
Trump is one Petty mother #DrFauciFanClub
I do not believe conspiracy theories but I do wonder how it can be so clear that Trump is physically and psychologically compromised and yet no one in the Republican party or the mainstream media is discussing this. How can that be?
tRUmp’s fascism is never right, nor is KKKelly’s blind placating of crimes of his regime.
Trump again pushes unproven drug as COVID-19 treatment
Yep, not just the Bernie campaign but also the Trump campaign with her frequent and active opposition to Biden. No thank you.
Yes, but NOT a Trump Republican.  Huge difference.
Good to hear that there are folks  that have sanity in their message... But may be they should create a new party because a lot of  are just plain racists and do not care for anybody else than themselves or special interests...
If Trump did another 2-4 week lockdown and at least 3 government stimulus he could easily take November

But there is destruction like never in my lifetime all around us right now and Trump is in charge? 🤷🏼‍♀️
I just realized it’s trump and kanye😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 i was like these ppl look so familiar!
LMFAOOOO I just realized this trump and kanye😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
OH SHIT I JUST REALIZED ITS TRUMP AND KANYE
I remember during the last election people were saying that Bernie Sanders was too old to be president, yet Trump is only four years younger than Bernie 🧐

That's funny... they wreck their own cities and blame it on Trump. Hahahahhaaaaa

Just believe the opposite of what Trump says to be true.
Seems like Biden should announce during Trump's convention speech.
Jarrett wants to talk about current investigation to deflect from 4 yr old investigation.Pretty sure  is more than capable of working two crime stories simultaneously. It is possible for Obama &amp; Trump to both be corrupt. One being guilty does not absolve the other.
Trump has tweeted a news story about doctors in Detroit saying #Hydroxychloroquine helped their patients. The story is from July 2 and has never been followed up on.
Start taking an active interest in how my country is being governed. Understanding how we let Trump happen may prevent another one in the future
I suspect the guy with a pinned tweet of “acquitted for life” for Trump doesn’t deal in facts.
This should fire up the left...Cuz Trump's fault no doubt🙄
Michael Cohen already dispelled the notion that trump will give a direct order.  So, that claim by Barr is disingenuous at best.
Opinion: Why the national security adviser's Covid-19 infection is a national security problem   from someone who actually knows how NSC works, WH admission that O'Brien hasn't seen #Trump recently may be worse than compromise of his staff

Liberals don’t want open up America...Instead they gladly pay them with stimulus money to continue to riot, then blame it on the Trump. They are burning the shops where they could be working. But they make more money doing their night job.
Your arguments are well organized, I'll give you that, but ideology and perception are skewed. The anti-Trump mindset, aka TDS, does not leave much room for real dialogue. And your illustrations don't serve you as much as you think they do.

I have nothing but respect for your father but he never had to fight the State Controlled Media the way President Trump has.  Trump has as more right to use pictures of him and your father than you do my friend. If you don't understand that, there's nothing more I can say...
And that’s what President Trump said!  You, the MSM, criticized the cure from one end of the county to the other. CNN’s agenda of poking the President has always been more important than the welfare of the American people.
Georgia, do we really want this guy again? He’s an enabler.
Trump keeps making me proud!
Trump is a  Sociopath
Easy, they are the " money changers" I think were mentioned in the New Testament. Trump fits right in.

It is abhorrent the sitting US President will not pay his respects at the Capitol to the late Congressman John Lewis.   Regardless of your politics, I defy anyone to claim Donald Trump has not dragged this nation into the gutter every day for almost four years. He's a disgrace.

You have no idea that unethical trump is just that...unethical.
Trump could take a dump on the Resolute desk and you’d say it was presidential.
Gentlemen.  Something trump knows nothing about.   Sad for America.
Why should Biden leave when trump is destroying himself.
Trump has turned America into the FYRE festival. #TrumpHatesScience
YOU PUT TRUMP FIRST ALWAYS. LIKE TODAY.  TRYING TO  DAMAGE OTHER COUNTRIES (who HAVE no where near  US cases).  SO JEALOUS OF GOVS WHO  DID A  DECENT JOB.  AMERICANS SEE RIGHT THRU U. FAILED LEADER.
Hard  to take seriously a vile liar like you. hear no evil, see no evil, speak plenty of evil. You think like Cotton if you screech loud and long enough  and wave your hands around people will believe you.  THE CAST MAJORITY IF AMERICA DOES NOT TRUST THE GOP &amp;Its fealty to trump
We already KNOW YOUR RECORD OF SERVICE AND HARD WORK FOR AMERICANS! Donald Trump however, is an entirely DIFFERENT STORY! Joe Bide for PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA! YYYYAAAAASSSSS!
Except trump voters will show up maskless.
Trump’s tweets are “dumb” like an arsonist lighting a school is “dumb.” Trump is destroying foundational pillars of our republic. Your judgment is the one that needs an adjustment.
Trump's like...
Would have been great if people took the virus seriously cause trump can't make your decisions
I hate how people are saying its trumps fault people are dieing because of the virus when its yells fault for not taking care of each other and being irresponsible when going to places trump doesn't make your decisions
Yes the Chinese virus is fake and Democrats say that many people died to make Trump look bad.
It is China and their Chinese Virus and Trump has handled it perfectly
"Three months ago, Joe Biden predicted that President Trump would eventually try to delay the November election - and Republicans laughed" #TrumpDelay #FascismHasComeToAmerica #gapol #Biden2020

Did find it interesting how many feathers this ruffled that usually don't get ruffled by everything else Trump does. (ex.
Cain attended President Donald Trump's June 20 rally in Tulsa, where he tweeted a photo of himself surrounded by people not wearing masks.
The next big Steven King blockbuster will be the horrors of living under this administration. Who will play trump??
DON'T TRY TO MAKE ME LIKE TRUMP! NEIN!!!
The United States of America is craving for leadership, because we have NOT had it under Donald Trump since he has been in office. We often do NOT miss the water, until the well runs dry and there is no sign of refilling! IT IS TIME FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD!
Please push to call the Postmaster in for a hearing immediately to address alleged slowdowns already ordered and to address Trump's claims of massive mail in voter fraud.
Too bad you’re a voice for Trump and you forgot about your constituents.
So sick of trump “everything is beautiful”.Yes happy about plasma.   DIDNT HELP HERMAN.  150000 dead Americans ON TRUMPS FAILED LEADERSHIP.    TRUMP DIESNT HAVEVROUNDTABLES. HE HAS VISITS ONLY FROM PEOPLE WHO WILL SHOW HIM FEALTY.
Your lifetime must have been filled with STUPIDITY, if you think these three honorable men were less presidents than the clown LITTLE MAN DONALD TRUMP! YOU ARE IGNORANT AND NEED TO WAKE UP TO REALITY!
Classy is when you vote to extend folks unempl ins. Making sure folks are not evicted from their homes. Making sure folks can have access to health care, etc. etc. Watch how he votes. Nothing classy with this trump sycophant.
Just like with most IGNORANT people, I don't have a clue of who or what you are talking about. We are HONORING JOHN LEWIS, if you want to wallow in what is not being done for this country, I would strongly suggest you direct those comments to LITTLE MAN DONALD TRUMP!
I am sure these presidents behind closed doors are close. They are all HONORABLE men. Of course they have  made mistakes just like we all have. But they have never divided this country more than Donald Trump! It is not who they are, as made evident by today! One love! Aliciadine
You mean like Donald Trump is doing right now? I don't sink to the level of what you are. UNTIL you get EVIL OUT OF YOUR HEART AND SPIRIT, You will NEVER UNDERSTAND what is NEEDED FOR the United States of America to be the country that it is created to be!WAKE UP!YOU ARE BLINDED!
I think the thing is, Trump hears these nutty theories and maybe he starts to believe them. Then he decides to tweet about it. He’s either a fool, or trolling. Or a combination of both.
Trump has screwed up every thing he worked on, UNFIT.
Beat cancer and got killed because of a Trump rally. Covid karma can be a bitch when you don't believe.
Racism, smoking, being a trump supporter all come to mind for me.
I glanced at the chart quickly and thought it was tRump’s signature. But then again, it is.
We must do MORE THAN JUST TALK ABOUT THE divisiveness and ills of Trump. He MUST BE VOTED OUT along with other members of Congress who are divisive and DO NOT WANT The United States of America to be TRULY UNITED AS ONE GREAT NATION! ONE LOVE! Aliciadine
Work is temporary because our lives are temporary. This nation is made up of flawed people trying to figure it out on this journey we call life. The difference is that some men like Bush, Clinton and Obama have a shared leadership in unifying America. DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT!
Indeed, I think after looking at this picture, although these men made mistakes as well, their intent to make America great were something that they shared. I think many of us realize the MISTAKE in having LITTLE MAN DONALD TRUMP IN OFFICE!
DONALD TRUMP has done more DAMAGE TO AMERICA in 3 years than ALL of these presidents TOGETHER. They were all two term presidents. These are men who believe in America! Donald Trump believes in  are TOO IGNORANT TO SEE THAT Trump is using you!WAKE UP!
The sad part about this statement from you Aysh is that you are TOO IGNORANT to know when someone DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU! Donald Trump does NOT CARE ABOUT YOU! He is the MOST DIVISIVE PRESIDENT IN OUR HISTORY!Calling women bitches and whores, mexicans rapists and thugs, WAKE UP!
I say this to you Renny Guarde, LITTLE MAN DONALD TRUMP has called women like your mother bitches and whores, Mexicans rapists, and even talked about white people. Check how little you think of yourself by voting this racist, natcissistic bully back into office. I don't THINK SO!
I say this to you Krista and to every women in the USA. This Little man Donald Trump has called women on several occasions bitches and whores, he has made fun of a person in a wheelchair, called Mexican people rapists and thugs and black athletes assholes. Check yourselves!
These tweets seem to be stirring up the EVIL within you. Good and decent spirits cannot be amongst the EVIL inside of you! It seems that Donald Trump was NOT INVITED to the homegoing of John Lewis because he stood for things that Trump has NO CLUE ABOUT, INTEGRITY, PEACE, CLASS!
I haven’t checked but I’m just assuming this was when all of the mis-reporting was occurring and that since late June/early July the numbers have only gotten better and therefore doesn’t fit trump=bad narrative. Just like when they used photos from the Obama admin and changed tim
What if that was the point. With so many in the media questioning whether the election could get delayed, now that Trump is suggesting it the media and the left will state unequivocally it won’t be delayed.
OMG I needed this laugh, thank you my dear! We must ALL WORK TOGETHER to get TRUMP far away from America! He is tearing away at the fabric and leading us in the WRONG DIRECTION! R.I.P. John Lewis! love you as the MAN OF GOD YOU ARE! ONE LOVE! Aliciadine
The Postmaster needs to be called in immediately for a public hearing. Carriers are already alleging that he's ordered a slow down. Also get him on record about what Trump is claiming too. It's crucial!
Why isn't the Postmaster being called to testify immediately to address Trump's claims? Make him go on record about allegations of already slowing down the mail too.
Call the Postmaster in immediately for a televised hearing before the house. Get him on record now to address the allegations that he's already slowing down the mail and ask if he agrees with Trump's voter mail fraud claims.

RIP.   I’m filled with rage at Trump. The Tulsa rally was purely to feed his vanity.  He encouraged his supporters to scorn the most basic protective measures against the virus. How many good people will we lose because of this pathological narcissist?
Sorry Henry, Joe told you he wanted to delay the election. Stop giving trump the benefit of the doubt, he eventually says the quiet part out loud.

So have these other black voices for Trump been tested??!! 🤨
Trump’s vanity killed a great American, Herman Cain. Burn the GOP to the ground because they desensitized us to Trump’s abuse of power.
Any comments on the narcissist whose vanity rally and anti-mask recklessness that led to this great man’s death? Trump caused this
The Tulsa rally was purely to feed Trump’s vanity. He encouraged his supporters to be reckless and scorn the most basic protective measures against the virus. How many good people will we lose because of this pathological narcissist?
Obama and Biden left Trump a Pandemic Response Plan, a Pandemic Response Office, and 44 infectious disease experts in China which he ignored the plan and got rid of the office and disease experts
This is why I want every single Trump enabler to be voted out.
In the Trump era, it’s quaintly funny that Biden was previously able to take the “gaffe master” title when political competition was far less   Biden finally found a proper use of his “gaffes” now that “says what he means” is important to the electorate
He wants to delay the election so he can stay in    Trump knows he is going to lose at this point and unable to change that
I agree. That's why I said that's what trump and his racist bigots mean but there is also a big dollop of classism mixed in as well.
Congress should stop his paycheck. The Erican people should not be paying for Trump’s personal attorney

Lindsay Graham is one of Trumps henchman who he has in his pocket. Lindsay Graham is the man who stated over my dead body will I GIVE Americans who need it most right now, the extra 600 per week in unemployment. To him and other Trump supporters. YOU ARE AS IGNORANT AS THEY ARE!
I hope I’ll control the chaos that all of Carmen Sandiego’s crooks would’ve caused in Portland now that Oregon’s governor made the ICE &amp; CBP agents withdraw from the city.  I imagine that only Trump &amp; those federal agents would provoke V.I.L.E. to put up a fight.
President trump will ALWAYS OUT HIMSELF FIRST. BLAME OTHERS, take credit for what others did, NEVER TAKE RESPONSIBILITY.  WHAT A VILE PERSON.
Trump and your goons double down on what you want! Where was the concern or doubling down for white police officers who killed George Floyd? Where is the doubling down on the white racists who wanted to lynch a governor lately? You people are a joke. Racist Lindsay Graham! ENOUGH
Senator Lindsey Graham are you a racist? Because based on your ads that is what people of color are saying. America is looking at Donald Trump and anyone who is associated with him with regards to the poor handling of race relations! I can see you also need to be VOTED OUT!LEARN
There are people in your base along with your colleagues who are NOT wearing a mask because you have CHOSEN NOT TO LEAD EFFECTIVELY DONALD TRUMP! Because you DON'T take THE TRUMP VIRUS SERIOUSLY so THEY DON'T EITHER!

Woke up today feeling something sinister in the air. Then I saw trump fuckin up again
I mean that he wants to frame it as a wedge issue. I wanna open schools and help kids, dems wanna keep them closed. Problem is, voters en masse disapprove of how Trump has handled the issue.
Incumbents also usually win by having decent governing records and by negatively defining their challengers. Something that Trump has not been able to do as successfully as he did in 2016.
What happened to #mirandarights?? I left the Philippines 30 some years ago because of this. Now it’s happening in America. Trump and Barr need to get a taste of  their own tactics. That’s how dictators end. Thrown into a plane and taken somewhere.

Yep, most Americans would agree.  “I really failed my fellow American citizens,” said Claudia Luckenbach-Boman. “If I were to vote again for Donald Trump in 2020, it would be just as much a failure as an American, but also a failure as a human being”
I’m with you. Trump 2020.

It’s hard to except the truth but when it’s staring us in the face we can pretend not to see it or we can get together and do something about it! Trump’s the wake up call America needed for us to say we’re mad as hell and we’re not going to take it anymore!
No Americans civil or constitutional rights gives anyone the right to endanger the entire country during a pandemic period! Trump’s supporters have kept this disease alive and well and he’s responsible for all the needless deaths caused by all his misinformation and lies!
Barr's arrogance is stunning! You should be apologizing to our country for Barr and Trump's crimes! Both of them belong behind bars.
A is plausible. But not plausible to be so major that a Trump blunder won't overshadow it.
Things can change if: A. Biden MAJORLY screws up.  B. Trump regains trust on handling the pandemic.
When Trump praises a “doctor” who believes that demon sex dreams cause STIs &amp; vaccines have alien DNA, or spitballs ideas UV rays &amp; bleach injection COVID treatments, you see it as a problem for his re-election prospects. Most of us see a person unfit for any office.

Trump’s batshit crazy presser today is why  gets under your skin  By merely using Trump’s own words, they make you confront the devil’s bargain you made by pretending that this imbecile is a normal President.
So sorry to hear you are voting for a loser...unethical trump.
Barr is playing the long game &amp; working for the #KochNetwork. He's only protecting trump bc they want 4 more yrs to finish stacking the court with young right wing justices.   Omg, how much more do you need to get excited about voting for Biden? He's pro democracy. Repubs arent!
+1000   Also, this is why  viral videos enrage the anti-anti Trumpers. Their con depends on finding flaws in Trump’s critics while pretending that Agent Orange doesn’t exist. They hate you for making them confront what they are really defending.
Trump can’t even read other people’s words well.  If he were quizzed about what he read he would fail.  But of course there is always Person, Woman, Man, Camera, TV. 🙄

If one works for Trump they are “heartless”. Without a heart you are very dead.
A huge reason I walked away from working in politics was when I was told to keep quiet about the shady shit Kirk was up to the first year Turning Point excised because, “our donors love him too.” I could see the bad direction things were headed pre trump.
Trump is a psychopathic killer responsible for the death of thousands of Americans.He would rather you die than to admit he was wrong.
I am watching you now on CNN stating to Attorney General William Barr about the denouncement of the tear gas and agents on the protesters by the bishops and administrators of the church that Donald Trump wanted to take a photo op. They vehemently did it afterwards!

He was in remission since 2007. Trump killed him.
We already KNOW YOUR RECORD OF SERVICE AND HARD WORK FOR AMERICANS! Donald Trump however, is an entirely DIFFERENT STORY! Joe Bide for PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA! YYYYAAAAASSSSS!
Put it this way, if Trump is not president you and I wouldn’t even know his son’s name. So your worry about his safety is due to what you see politically. Then you used his son to reference his instability.   Leave the kids out of the politics.
Not sure, and you can’t be sure. Hard for any politician to control a virus. 26 children age 14 &amp; under died from the virus as of 6/17. Studies show kids are not carriers to adults on a substantive level.   Trump’s response has been bad, absolutely.  You’re better than this tweet
Trump knows he can’t move the election. He just wanted to distract you from the WORST economic quarter in US HISTORY!!! #TrumpFailedAmerica #ETTD
All three of these men are decent, especially in the face of Trump. Buzz off. Troll.
Did President Obama say something that wasn’t true? If a Democrat President was doing what Trump is doing I would think the republicans would call him/her out on it, this was a perfect time knowing what Congressman John Lewis stood for.
Did he not see Trump’s “address” in Mt. Rushmore? THAT was a political rally.
Trump set the precedence of turning everything into a campaign rally, but if Obama eulogy trigger you that much you might need to cut back on snake oil consumption
Good God how much older is Barack than Trump? He looks 110! Stress maybe, now that is so called legacy is in tatters? Not to mention the guy who he’s floating is not all there, poor guy.
Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That’s Unconstitutional.  I kinda like the idea of President Pelosi, as pointed out by a co-founder of the Federalist Society.  and  must leave in Jan 2021.  is next in line if vacant.

Exactly zero chance he will ever comment on Trump’s assertion that this election will be the most inaccurate and fraudulent election in history.
Sadly, I agree. We actually started out with a unified shut down, but as soon as Trump and unpatriotic, lunatic fringe organizations like Tea Party Patriots made it look like we had to choose between the economy and health, the unification fell apart. This is their civil war.

The United States of America is craving for leadership, because we have NOT had it under Donald Trump since he has been in office. We often do NOT miss the water, until the well runs dry and there is no sign of refilling! IT IS TIME FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD!
He chose to go in to a crowded enclosed space during a global pandemic and not wear a mask to please Donald Trump. And now he’s dead. What a dumb hill to die on. He was an idiot but maybe his stupidity will awaken others to do the simple and right thing. #WearADamnMask

Flatten the curve quickly became destroy the economy to beat Trump.  And we are seeing civil unrest as a campaign tactic.  It is totally expected to see Democrats attack Trump on the economy.  Perhaps they really are that stupid not to understand the consequences of the action.

Donald Trump suggests delay to 2020 US presidential election
Trump, for all his bluster, is a coward. He doesn’t even fire people directly, he gets others to do it for him. If he loses, he will talk a big game and then take one last ride in Air Force one down to mar-a-lago to lick his wounded ego.
Always look for how Trump has compromised the mark. Kodak CEO made $$ on the stocks. Would be scrutinized in a sane world. Trump will claim Kodak has vaccine “almost ready,” practically daring Kodak to push back. If this money is dirty, they won’t push back. Trump 101.

Trump wants to get in front of cameras because Obama is about to be in front of the camera. You can’t make this stuff up.
He made a choice to ignore medical experts in the name of politics. He repeatedly downplayed the danger of the virus, attended a Trump rally where few were masked, and refused to wear a mask himself. I feel for his loved ones, but this was entirely self inflicted and preventable.
We must do MORE THAN JUST TALK ABOUT THE divisiveness and ills of Trump. He MUST BE VOTED OUT along with other members of Congress who are divisive and DO NOT WANT The United States of America to be TRULY UNITED AS ONE GREAT NATION! ONE LOVE! Aliciadine
Work is temporary because our lives are temporary. This nation is made up of flawed people trying to figure it out on this journey we call life. The difference is that some men like Bush, Clinton and Obama have a shared leadership in unifying America. DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT!
Trump hasn't "sought" anything. He made a suggestion. And none of your aforementioned presidents had to deal with people on the other side of the aisle who would blatantly cheat to steal an election. And BTW, you're a POS traitor to the Republican party.

I say this to you Renny Guarde, LITTLE MAN DONALD TRUMP has called women like your mother bitches and whores, Mexicans rapists, and even talked about white people. Check how little you think of yourself by voting this racist, natcissistic bully back into office. I don't THINK SO!
I say this to you Krista and to every women in the USA. This Little man Donald Trump has called women on several occasions bitches and whores, he has made fun of a person in a wheelchair, called Mexican people rapists and thugs and black athletes assholes. Check yourselves!

These tweets seem to be stirring up the EVIL within you. Good and decent spirits cannot be amongst the EVIL inside of you! It seems that Donald Trump was NOT INVITED to the homegoing of John Lewis because he stood for things that Trump has NO CLUE ABOUT, INTEGRITY, PEACE, CLASS!
Keep the faith, Trump is preparing the cure for ALL to see, keep fighting. Hear it here in the X-22 Report
I’m glad Trump isn’t there. He is antithetical to everything John Lewis stood for.
Nah, you can tell when it switches from Trump to a voice impressionist.
So here are the alternatives- 1- don’t vote.  2- throw away your vote on an independent candidate.  3- vote for Trump.  The choice is your’s.
What if that was the point. With so many in the media questioning whether the election could get delayed, now that Trump is suggesting it the media and the left will state unequivocally it won’t be delayed.
OMG I needed this laugh, thank you my dear! We must ALL WORK TOGETHER to get TRUMP far away from America! He is tearing away at the fabric and leading us in the WRONG DIRECTION! R.I.P. John Lewis! love you as the MAN OF GOD YOU ARE! ONE LOVE! Aliciadine
It’s definitely something else. Trump was right. Nobody likes him.
The government doesn’t “give” anything. It takes it from taxpayers and redistributes it to others. It is welfare and arguably theft. Both parties are at fault, and it would be congress passing it. Trump would sign or veto.
the only correct answer is B only communist and trump supporters would choose anything else
They said he was at that Tulsa Trump rally
You’d be surprised. I have a friend who is black, gay, and married. Supports Trump unconditionally. I don’t get it.
Herman Cain, former Republican presidential candidate and former CEO of a major pizza chain who went on to become an ardent supporter of President Donald Trump, has died of complications from the coronavirus. He was 74.
I never said that. And neither is anyone else. Except extremists. Why would Trump involve CDC and Birka and have press conferences if he thought it was a hoax. You’re thinking in a little box.
What say you  ? Staying on the Trump Train?
Yes, when are you going to ask Trump to resign like you asked Bill Clinton too?
I see the bushes in the Rose Garden have grown immense with the constant spew of fertilizer from the mouth of Donald J Trump
Donald Trump is terrified that Kamala Harris will be the next Attorney General. If he loses, probability is very high that he will step down and let Pence pardon him before the next administration.
RIP, Herman Cain.  This tragedy could likely have been avoided. Wonder if he signed the Trump's campaign waiver.
NO!!! Not poor taste at all. People like this (under pressure or not) defy NON-PARTISAN science to politicize an apolitical PANDEMIC in order to placate the unplacatable (trump). Maybe if a few more of these type deaths occurred their psychotic leader would yield.
Donald Trump’s Tulsa rally killed Herman Cain. Incredible
Has nothing to do with Trump. Call out the daily and nightly protestors why don’t you.
I wonder if Herman Cain wore a mask would he still be alive? I’m pretty sure listening to Trump is bad for your health.
And he’s dead because of a fucking trump rally that never should have happened. Yep! The blood is on your hands
In fact the whole Trump economy is flying  In the wrong direction...
He had beaten cancer years before. He was a health risk for COVID because of that.  The cancer didn’t kill Trump did.
Nah, you not gonna try and frame this. He died of COVID-19.  Trump msg killing people.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
He got it at the Trump rally right?
Trump will win in a landslide!!!
Put Obama in place of Trump...and then how would we conservatives feel?

I fucking hate Trump, but I want to see the "data" that confirms that it takes three weeks for us to see evidence of an outbreak of a virus that people usually only have for two once they contract it.

Here’s a question, Trump maybe signing off to reduce our military in Germany, but such a withdrawal doesn’t happen immediately, it takes years... couldn’t a President Biden undo and reverse a morons capitulation to Putin?
Yes, I’m not a fan of that either. But it’s the way Trump says things that only fuels the fires of tribalism. Actions indeed speak louder than words but when you’re the president your words carry a tremendous amount of weight.

You’re in for a big disappointment. You backed a loser, a scammer, a cruel, dishonest racist fraud who was protected by daddy all of his life. After all of his failures, he moved on to con you. We’re now living with consequences of Trump’s incompetence, until January at least.

Trump is the ONLY person that can turn the economy around.  It’s happening now with record job growth occurring.
It's not that they are overwhelmed. They are under a stand down order by the politicians. Until that gets lifted, the city doesn't stand a chance. Politicians are hoping Trump gets defeated, because they have to know he isn't going to send them any money. Biden will.

1/ I will make this clear. I am just another human but, I’ll say this, make no mistake,Trump, with his order to pull troops out of Germany is only an agreement between him and Putin to pave the way for for conquer.

Germany has been slapping us and the rest of our allies in the face for years. They need to pay their share. WTF happened to you, anyway? You get your little feelings hurt when Trump beat you?

He was in remission since 2007. Trump killed him.
Put it this way, if Trump is not president you and I wouldn’t even know his son’s name. So your worry about his safety is due to what you see politically. Then you used his son to reference his instability.   Leave the kids out of the politics.
Not sure, and you can’t be sure. Hard for any politician to control a virus. 26 children age 14 &amp; under died from the virus as of 6/17. Studies show kids are not carriers to adults on a substantive level.   Trump’s response has been bad, absolutely.  You’re better than this tweet

Did find it interesting how many feathers this ruffled that usually don't get ruffled by everything else Trump does. (ex.
The new Postmaster General that Trump appointed is slowing the mail down. In all the years I've lived in this house I've had mail every day but within the last 2 weeks there were days at a time that mail was not delivered. My absentee ballot came a week before that of my spouse.

He is simply trying to protect the sanctity of the vote. The Left know that  the only way they can  defeat Donald Trump  is by stealing the election! The easiest  way to do that is to provide for fool proof  fraudulent voting - ( mail in voting)!
I bet anything it was released on purpose by Dems and China!  Both want to destroy Trump!
Think about the psychological toll on the school administrators that would have facilitated the avoidable deaths of susceptible people. They woul get that aweful feeling in the pit of their stomach Donald Trump got after the death of Herman Cain. Never mind.
Please Pres. Trump. People say that this is just a joke you are making. But how are we to know what is a joke and what is not. Don’t make the citizens of our great country guess about which things you really mean.
Where is the statement from his murderer Donald Trump?
Yeah except Trump couldn’t even eulogize his father without talking about himself the whole time. I can imagine him speaking about Herman Cain and filling it full of campaign BS
I think the thing is, Trump hears these nutty theories and maybe he starts to believe them. Then he decides to tweet about it. He’s either a fool, or trolling. Or a combination of both.
Cain attended President Donald Trump's June 20 rally in Tulsa, where he tweeted a photo of himself surrounded by people not wearing masks.
I glanced at the chart quickly and thought it was tRump’s signature. But then again, it is.
There is only one style of voting that is fault proof. The red China 100% all in favor. Which by the way is what Trump wish for his presidency. US goes from leader to joke of the world in 4 yrs.
Trump doesn't joke, remember? He said so.

I haven’t checked but I’m just assuming this was when all of the mis-reporting was occurring and that since late June/early July the numbers have only gotten better and therefore doesn’t fit trump=bad narrative. Just like when they used photos from the Obama admin and changed tim
Sorry, he didn't care enough about his family or staff.  Masks will not be mandatory at the event, which will be attended by President Trump. PEOPLE ARE FED UP!’  That tweet remains on Cain’s Twitter feed.
But he was too stupid to make that decision, as were the many maskless people huddled together at the rally. Not holding rally, or at least hold it safely, was the choice that should have been made. That's what leaders do, which Trump clearly is not.
Hopefully this will wake Trump up!
Trump used him as a prop at a maskless non social distancing rally, which killed him.
No this is not Trump's fault and in no way I support Trump. He should have used common sense but instead he tried to make a political point.
No, nothing like that, actually. Those bankrupted companies were part of the Trump Org. Was he invlolved I. Daily management? Maybe not, but it was a lot different than a name sponsorship on a stadium
The government doesn’t “give” anything. It takes it from taxpayers and redistributes it to others. It is welfare and arguably theft. Both parties are at fault, and it would be congress passing it. Trump would sign or veto.
Obama was more successful than Trump as POTUS by every measure. Even before Covid, Trump’s GDP wasn’t growing any faster than Obama’s did. And now it just had the worst drop in history. Sad, but completely predictable
He was also an idiot who ignored the science about masks and social distancing necessary to contract this non hoax disease. His blood is on Trump's hands and yours for not supporting Trump's removal from office.
Trump killed him with the insurance that masks should not be mandated at the Tulsa rally. You are trying to kill the rest of us Georgians by sticking to that. Think about it.
Trump killed him.

Don’t go to Trump rallies. Wear a mask. This virus is deadly serious. Prayers for his family.
In fact the whole Trump economy is flying  In the wrong direction...
He had beaten cancer years before. He was a health risk for COVID because of that.  The cancer didn’t kill Trump did.

In the Trump era, it’s quaintly funny that Biden was previously able to take the “gaffe master” title when political competition was far less   Biden finally found a proper use of his “gaffes” now that “says what he means” is important to the electorate
Of course we will have an election and this will feed the conspiracy theory of “what if Trump won’t leave?”
What the actual FVCK??? Someone needs to get this motherfucker OUT!!
He wants to delay the election so he can stay in    Trump knows he is going to lose at this point and unable to change that
Hahahahaha! You only think they are voting for trump. Wait until they vote.
lol right?  Supreme Court: "You can't do that"  Trump: "Too bad. What are you gonna do?"
Why doesn't this tweet say:  "Only Congress can set the date of a presidential general election, contrary to Trump's tweet. The election will still be on Nov 3rd, 2020."
DAMNIT WE NEED TO GET RID OF TRUMP NOW
The Thurmond rule don't mean shit &amp; that lame duck session will see more rules made, judges appointed, pardons issued than your head can comprehend.  Trump's presidency won't end on Election Day even if it happens and even if he loses. Trust me. You think it's bad now? Just wait.

"Don't Count Trump Out" - for the record, I don't, mostly because Roger Stone is a free man and The National Enquirer still publishes.
The Democrats are good at a lot of things; fighting back and using the media to their advantage like Trump does, is not their forte. They prefer taking the high road. This country is just a few steps away from absolute fascism, they need to stop their measured resources &amp; FIGHT
Yes, I’m not a fan of that either. But it’s the way Trump says things that only fuels the fires of tribalism. Actions indeed speak louder than words but when you’re the president your words carry a tremendous amount of weight.

This turd makes me mad when he constantly calls it the China Virus... if anything it’s the Trump Virus
Well no they were accurate, Trump just cheated
Trump only uses people as props. It’s terrible. RIP Herman Cain.
Oops, he did it again! If only we could get that fool out of office now! #Trump #TrumpImpeachment #GOPCorruptionOverCountry
Too bad Trump basically killed him

I dont want either in power but mentally i rather trump than biden because at least we will stay on the streets with him but biden will lock us up with the swiftness...
Plenty of people can. Unfortunately it doesn't sound like Trump will give up his office even if he loses, so putting someone competent on the case doesn't sound likely
I know you MAGAs think Trump is perfect and can do no wrong, but you lose all credibility when you fail to acknowledge his role in this. Everyone but Trump's fault, right? Lol
Completely false. You sound so sure of yourself too, as if you're a doctor with any sort of expertise. MAGAs will listen to any crap that comes out of Trump's mouth. HCQ is just more of the same
Trump meets with the family of  Vanessa Guillen
You would rather he thought like the slave owning democrats wanted him to and hate trump. You still have the mentality. You’re free to have your own thoughts.
Wait, I think that headline is really poorly written. Is it not him saying that TRUMP would ditch the inauguration?
Trump got Coronavirus and Died 😷
But you’re mad about trump having a rally. Still are. That’s funny. And you’ve used it as a reason to justify a death. But you say nothing negative and don’t get mad at mass protests and riots.
There is a lot of room for the Republican Party in the middle. They will have to denounce what some call the Trump party and those who have tied themselves to it. There are many former Republicans who may never vote that way again.
You’re mad it was a trump rally. Just start with that.
Trump floats idea of election delay, a virtual impossibility
This man is bat shit crazy! The German people have been very hospitable to us. It is a vital location for us, Putin gets from trump what Putin wants!!
Whoever voted for Donald Trump your the reason we are in quarantine
I knew that racists ass Donald Trump wouldn't show up to the late Congressman's John Lewis funeral smh you hate black people so much you cant pay your respect to such a wonderful gentleman #dividedstatesofamerica
Lmao 😂 honestly nobody has to do that trump does a great job all by his self
trump doesn't joke
It’s trump. The 17th letter is trump.
Key word "rush". Trump wanting a good economy for Election Day (doesn't care about livelihoods, just wants to look good) isn't a valid reason to preemptively open the economy.
They shutdown *because* Trump botched Covid-19. It's great he wants to open but he can't have his cake and eat it too. We have to deal with the consequences of his failed leadership now
Dems want the economy open just as bad as you, but they aren't going to rush it just so Trump's can maybe have a better looking economy for Election Day
They shutdown their entire state *because* Trump botched Covid-19. Other wealthy countries get to enjoy summer, not America. Nice job Trump
I cannot explain that logic. I agree with you there. But to respond to the guy above - literally the only people who have made connections between Covid-19 and Nov 4th are Trumpers. You're projecting so hard for Trump's reopening efforts.
Why make this all about HCQ if you think Covid is relatively is relatively harmless? I agree we need to open the economy. If Trump acted competently we would be enjoying summer, unfortunately he failed us and there is no end in sight.
I love how everyone,even conservatives,losing their minds over  tweet about voter fraud &amp; asking question if election ought to be delayed. Love it. Masterful. Fact that folks STILL take EVERYTHING Trump tweets literally is gold. Once again, you been played. #TrumpTrolledYou
GEORGIA IS TRUMP COUNTRY!!! Havent seen a single Biden sign anywhere. Trump/Pence signs, flags &amp; bumper stickers EVERYWHERE here!!
No no loss here. Youre an anon pos on twitter. Theres no arguement to win or lose. But you seem to accept the covid talk from ppl who hate trump, i assume you probably accept their "nothing to see here" attitue about riots. You can run along now.
So really, that IS what they love about him.  And that is why many elected officials on the right know they will get points with their constituents if they 1) support Trump 100%, 2) own the libs 3) make the libs heads explode.  That’s the formula.
...revoked because the drug is "unlikely to be effective in treating COVID-19"  No matter what evidence is presented, you still cling to HCQ. Is this really all for Trump?  I'm not Fauci but much is unknown about Covid and experts are learning &amp; adjusting as new info is uncovered
President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden both promise sweeping progress over the next four years -– via starkly different paths.
What in the world! Of course they are going to say it was trump.. I guess if Biden was in office they would say he same thing!
Somehow we always end up talking about Hillary when I argue with you MAGAs. Yes, she believes Trump cheated to win. Any comment on Trump refusing to say whether he'll accept the 2020 results? Or delegitimizing our election in his tweet above? Or do you only do double standards?

Problem is, the wonderful Mr. Gleeson will make Trump seem to have depth.
The stable genius isn't too hot on his feet either pal. When I take a minute to see what Trump is really doing for the US, it's delay and delegitimize our election (see his above tweet)
See what I mean about conspiracies? You believe that the PhDs who have dedicated their lives to this and published loads of research are nothing more than fear-mongers. What does Trump know about infectious diseases?😂 This is how the US became the worst place on Earth for Covid
Just another Trump BOT
I doubt Trump was wanted.
Trump suggests delaying November election, something he doesn't have the power to do - ABC News — What a Fascist!  He needs to learn and respect the Constitution! #TrumpISAFascist

Now let’s see how trump responds to your death lmao
When Donald Trump became president
No one is telling me he won’t accept the results. I can surmise that just by opening my eyes.   Nonetheless, no one is discredited from commenting on Trump’s actions here and now because of totally unrelated commentary from 2016

The world would be safer with Trump in jail. Fingers crossed.
On Thursday morning, Trump tweeted: “With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE &amp; FRAUDULENT Election in history."
He went to that damn Trump Rally!
Election of no, Trump's term is over at noon on January 20th. Until an election is held, the office would pass to the Speaker Of The House. The Speaker may not be Nancy Pelosi, but it will be whoever the sitting House choses, election or no.
Do you MAGAs add anything substantive to the political landscape, or is everything just a lib-owning contest?   Why wouldn’t people be concerned that a failing US President is trying to delegitimize our democracy?  You all think Trump is some mastermind, nah he’s a bafoon
So funny how MAGAs worship Trump as if he’s some genius
Voter ID has absolutely nothing to do with Trump’s call to delay the election. Saavedra is just distracting from our wanna-be dictator
It is bad. But I'm afraid Trump is dangerous for our country. MAKE AMERICA JUST FIRST.
“The U.S. economy shrank 9.5 percent from April through June, the largest quarterly decline since the government began publishing data 70 years ago”  So much better! No matter how you spin it, Trump destroyed our economy
“The U.S. economy shrank 9.5 percent from April through June, the largest quarterly decline since the government began publishing data 70 years ago”  Okay, I feel much better now😂  No matter how you spin it, Trump destroyed our economy.
Still the worst economic quarter in history, thanks to Trump
Ok so if Trump delays the election and his term is up the speaker of the house becomes short term president. If Nancy Pelosi is in power, you see what California looks like under her authority, homelessness, rent crisis, fire crisis now image the whole country....I'm just saying.
Some of you Trump haters have the most hate in your heart...  I don’t support him but that hate...is a no for me, dawg.   Sending you all love and light 💖
This fucking umpa lumpa will do anything to try and stay in power... BBC News - Donald Trump suggests delay to 2020 US presidential election
Trump right now^
Without hesitation. My mother *despised* Trump, but would be disappointed if I hadn't helped someone in need.
Our entire country is feeling the pain caused by the coronavirus. Americas are struggling to pay their bills and get food for their family's. Guess what.Trump wants to build a new FBI building at the cost of 1.75 million. that's way more important then helping the American people
If we can have an election in 1864, then we can have it now. Trump is working hard at destroying our democratic society all for the betterment of himself, his cronies, and supporters.

Trump floats election ‘delay’ amid claims of voting fraud
He will never admit when he fucks up. He is so simple minded he can't understand why everyone trusts Fauci and that hurt his little orange ego.. Trump can't handle the fact he sucks at being the leader of our country. In his eyes admitting failure is a sign of weakness
Trump is so full of shit...he lies about everything...he uses people to cover up the stupid shit he says or does. Then throws them under the bus. Its like running after a toddler except the toddler will learn from their mistakes unlike Trump.
I guess President Trump want segregation again. You go ahead announce Jim crow laws 2.0 while you at it, since its obviously, that's what you want.
Proud of my piece in American Review of Public Administration's special issue on COVID-19. I examine President Trump's communications and argue that presidential leadership failed us not the federal bureaucracy.

And there's nothing inherently wrong with being a Republican or conservative at all. It's not my political flavor, but I understand that there's merit to some of their ideals.   Trump is completely out of scope with those principles.

If you hide a deadly virus . It doesn’t kill . Trump &amp; GOP logic .
Journalist can’t sell peace . They can sell riots . Except with gun toting Trump voters . That’s fine .
Sounds like Trump &amp; republicans voters . With the GOP enablers . TRAITORS ONE &amp; ALL!
What’s to explain . Waste the money . It’s how Trump rolls during a pandemic . Death aren’t important . Golf &amp; a new FBI Headquarters is.
Biden pretty much has to debate Trump, or Trump will say Biden is afraid to debate him. On the other hand, I saw Biden do a shark grim when he said he'd debate Trump. Debating is something you learn in real schools.
Boat parade supporting President Trump in Myrtle Beach
Can’t let trump be right. Couldn’t let him save lives. 145k dead because of their negligence and political motivations. We can’t forget this
#Hydroxychloroquine works. It was well documented yet for whatever reason not used. Oh figured it out. Trump said it worked so it got buried. Dems and doctors are responsible for the deaths. Not trump.
It is trump supporting homophobic nazi chic 🥴
It solves the problem... the Dems create problems that is republicans have to fix. That’s why it’s important to keep Trump in office!
are we still bombing? Because I think Trump pretty much stopped the bombing that the last black president we had escalated.
why is that so hard to believe? you hate trump so much you'd rather they were wrong? Sad.
Omg Trump is either suffering from mental decline or he’s drunk or high. He constantly is slurring and making crazy racist statements. I will vote for anybody as long as it’s not Trump. He is the most corrupt President in history.
Lady G you’re headed towards retirement. What about the bounties Putin put on our soldiers? Why won’t you condemn him? You said trump would destroy your party and you would deserve it. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
I doubt it. I don’t think trump or his administration would allow it.
I just saw that Trump thin skin was trending!!! That’s a big fat laugh!!! NO ONE could deal with what has been thrown at him and still be able to run a country without a break down!! There’s has been no other President that’s gone through the crap he has!! #Trump2020
Trump in 2020!
Trump has done more in 3 years to help Blacks than Obama and Biden did in eight.  He signed prison reform, he got the Black unemployment rate to the lowest ever, he signed into law the MLK National Park in ATL (wonder why Obama did not do that?) and he gave Black Colleges funds.
Trump could say chickens come from eggs and the media would say he’s wrong.
We getting another stimulus check next month! Hellz yes. Trump wins again #stimuluspackage #Trump2020LandslideVictory
Hilarious the Right has been drooling over these videos as if they’re an accurate representation of society, or even Dems.   Acting like the actions of 0.00001% of the population warrant GOP leadership instead.  Too many real issues at stake. Trump and the GOP are toast
I bet Bill Kristol is being paid $1000 for every negative Trump tweet by George Soros and he is working overtime.
Trump is toast. Biden by 5 million
Nope
Trump supporters JUMP at the opportunity to troll and cyber bully people.   Fuck what you think.
If you were really concerned about player safety you would put each player on hydroxychloroquin but it’s not. It’s about the hatred of Donald Trump. PATHETIC!
Every Trump supporter I talk to says this shit.  It's almost like they're ashamed.
Trump couldn’t guide a blind man across the street. However; people woman man camera tv idiot.
...and you enabled the inept Trump to continue as president.  You are to be held responsible for his actions/lack of action...140k dead.  Thought you were a "pastor",where is your condemnation of the Russia bounty on our troops?  #gapol #GAsen  #GAGOP
Sadly it’s what has been ignored . As time &amp; time again republicans cheat to win . No investigation . Recounts taken home to invalidate the votes . It’s a mess if authoritarianism . Now ask how Trump going to win . With a model like GA’s . No one ever comes to save the people.
Nothing is done. A transcript of nothing . Equals Trump doesn’t care .
Since the Dem Party keeps following its trend of nominating moderate GOPers it moves the GOP further and further right to the point they’re nominating batshit crazy, sociopathic people like Trump. What the hell comes next for them since we’ve nom. our most conservative cand yet?
All of them . Trump doesn’t care .
One more thing doe Democrats who still think we have to vote for these Corporatist or else. Think about this for a minute, the GOP went from Reagan to Bush1, to Bush 2, and now to Trump. Notice a trend. Each one progessively more Conservative and batshit crazy then the previous.
Republicans will read nothing or see nothing or hear nothing . Just as with Trump . Traitors don’t turn on each other . Too much to lose . Like your country . Could kick you out . Or put you inprisin or death sentence for killing 150,000 people on purpose .
Trump national security adviser O'Brien has the coronavirus
If, and I say if, he wins it’ll be entirely due to the fact people voted against Trump and maybe 5% because people like him and think he’ll be a good president. And that’s only because Democratic primary voters left us with this hellish, disastrous choice yet again.
Is Trump speaking in tongues again ?
There is no such thing as a "shameless attack on the president"  Trump deserves everything the media can throw at him....and more.  Trump is an inept moron, who is pardoning his cronies.  Trump is a criminal.
It is. It’s him and trump 😭
What the hell else does the GOP, PRIOR TO TRUMP &amp; after, have to do to show they hate Democracy. They don’t like the “others” voting bc it cuts their power. But bc the neoliberal establishment is in the same economic club, the Democrats pretend water isn’t wet and up isn’t up.
McConnell has stacked the federal judiciary with the acquiescence of a weak Schumer, he refuses to bring up the VRA for a vote. We have some of them tape admitting it’s to hurt blacks and other minorities. Most of these activities happened before Trump ever announced his run
I’m so freaking sick and damned tired of neoliberals acting as though Trump is an outlier. These people stole the 2000 election, lied us into multiple wars, subvert democracy daily with gerrymandering and voter suppression, including a modern day poll tax with DeSantis in Florida
I’m not sure what this is implying but seeing as how the democrats are letting their cities burn and seeing as how democrat run cities are in shambles I don’t think there is any room to talk about Trump. It took a global pandemic that nobody could prepare for to bring his economy
Welcome to the Trump/GOP Dystopian America. I’m so sick and damned tired of this cadre of Neoliberal Democrats whining about why doesn’t the GOP stand up to Trump. Bc they believe the same things. Trump didn’t bring this authoritarian strain into the GOP. Anyone remember Cheney?
Some of us got it a couple decades ago. But I can bet you there are millions of Democratic bobble ditto heads out there saying, we have to do this to beat Trump. Can’t you just see them. The unthinking masses who’ve bobble headed us into this hellscappe of the neoliberal class.
Me too but I do breads like I said when Trump makes me angry my neighbors love me they all get a loaf lol
Because there a lot of unthinking people in America who want, and in some cases, need to be told what and how to think. Is there any wonder Trump won?
Remember when all those celebrities said they were going to leave the country if Trump won, but they never did?
Naturally Trump is being a dick and announced he’s not going to pay his respects to Congressman Lewis or his family... I hate this man
Because he's not Donald trump
Luckily, no one will ever speak of the immoral Trump with kind words after he passes.
He asked Trump &amp; Epstein, the original "teenage girl" lovers
You think these people are still “peaceful protesters”? I believe you owe President Trump an apology!!
Trump must want it functioning in his voter areas . As in an email he sent out .  He recommended vote by mail .
Leave the $600 alone and stop paying for Trump golf trips. 💯
No Biden is just a Criminal who with his son Huntermade a lot of money off of the American Taxpayer.  BTW Trump is not a traitor.  Might want to look at Hillary for her selling American Uranium to the Russians or Obama with his plane loads of cash to terrorists to kill US Troops.
Despicable, trump is bringing his stench across this country🥺

AP-NORC poll: Anxiety props up Biden support, Trump voters fervent
If you want to vote for Trump by all means do that but don’t tell somebody else what to do with “their” vote !!!!
Wrong, an aggressive government would be there in full force, cracking heads and hauling those "peaceful" rioters off and throwing them into a windowless prison. I'm hoping that's still an option under cosideration.  Trump's got to stop playing softball with these terrorists.
... agreed, there was a plan in place. The Trump Administration failed to follow it
The state should have the right to fine electorals that don’t follow their state votes even if they voted for Trump. Yes I will vote for Trump but if he doesn’t win and Biden wins then see Biden is the winner but to keep it fair for each state this is why we have the system !
I'm a life long Republican...something that Trump can not claim.   One can be a Republican and not support Trump. He is destroying &amp; tarnishing the GOP.
..it started with Trump dismantling the pandemic response office at the White House.
Bravo....Reagan would NEVER supported the  moron Trump.  Reagan was a real Republican

President Donald Trump's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, has tested positive for Covid-19, according to an official familiar with what happened.
You don’t want to listen to the people who will actually be in the classroom, teaching?  P.S. this wouldn’t have been a problem if Trump didn’t botch the virus response.
I spent 9 hours sleeping while you cried about trump. Tell you what. Conversation over. Go cry to someone else. But get help. You’re lost and confused.
Deductive*. How do you explain your fascination, rage, and obsession with trump supporters? You can’t. You lack the ability to rationally think.
It’s incredible that the most basic things need to be explained to MAGAs  People aren’t deciding not to work. They are out of work because of the virus  The virus that Trump completely failed at stopping. If not for his abysmal leadership, people would likely be working again
This dude stayed up all day and night just to scream at trump supporters. But kept saying the same thing over and over. Seems his tds has led to a meth addiction.

Went outside this morning to see that my neighbors put a Trump sign in their yard. I guess it’s a good thing I have Biden yard signs in my car left over from SC
The ChiComms developed, spread, and then denied the virus was theirs.  When a Trump stopped flights from China, Pelosi and others haranged him.  The DemocRATs are using the virus as a tool to hurt the US and by doing that hurt Trump.  Wake up!
I DONT SEE YOU WRITE OR HEAR YOU DENOUNCING VIOLENCE IN THE STREETS WHY DONT YOU USE YOUR LOUD DISCUSTING MOUTH AND YELL INTO THE CAMERAS DENOUNCING THE VIOLENCE? OR DO  YOU WANT  TO LET PEOPLE TO DESTROY THE COUNTRY JUST BECAUSE YOU HATE TRUMP? THE PEOPLE DO IT FIR FUN NO CAUSE
I guess you blame the virus on Trump.  Well, Cuomo is the person who put sick people in Nursing Homes and that infected the most vulnerable. Is he one of your hero’s? The media is trying to help him spin that tale.  The ChiComms developed, hid, and spread this virus worldwide.

Sometimes I find myself wondering what Trump’s days after he loses and is preparing to leave office is gonna look like. Will he just finally snap and become a dictator?
Ok but why does the White House look like Trump is planning on never leaving....
Monika, if you are on Medicare and ill enough you would know Obamacare is killing the elderly. Our out of pocket has gone through the roof. Thank GOD we now have a president that is helping the elderly. TRUMP 2020
These rioters do not want peace, this has been going on long enough. The governors and mayors have proven to the world that they will not try to bring this to an end. President Trump has a duty to step in and stop this madness. President Trump will protect the people. Trump 2020
1. You wear a mask because you’re afraid of a cold. 2. You think it’s cool. Stop calling people cowards. 3 the secret service makes bunker calls, not the president. 4. You’re obviously more obsessed with trump than actual trump supporters lol
He works??? I think the trump children are too stupid to work. They just suck the old man for money. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
How was she interfering? She appeared to me to be going to the aid of someone, who may have been injured!! A trump supporter will always see the opposite of everything.
Lolololololololol...Hogwarts isn't real, The School of Hard Knocks doesn't offer an accredited degree, and degrees from Trump University are not relevant.
They are the ones instigating the violence. How fucking dense are you?! Being spoon fed tRump, Carlson, and Hannity is dangerous, and that makes you dangerous since you believe the lies they spread.
You keep hanging onto Russia conspiracies, the 2016 election, and your trump gifs. It’s all your life consists of. Gonna get off here and hang out with this thing called a family. Hope you get your bread and water tonight. 🤙🏽
Coulda fooled me. You keep sending a trump gif and calling him obese. You love that stuff don’t you lol
But let’s not get this twisted. It’s not that they’re afraid of Trump or the GOP. They don’t have to courage to stand up to their donors and cut off the spicket feeding billions to them. So they continue to fund a bloated pentagon &amp; national security complex that feeds the donors
Not that I am one. But if I were a poorly educated trump supporter, it would still be a lot better than a loser still crying and obsessing over trump. Hell dude you talk about trump more than I do haha. You must love him. I bet you Stan his tl. 🤣
Keep waiting, b/c there is no proof that anything like that ever happened. That's why the intel agencies decided not to brief Trump on the issue. On the other hand, we killed hundreds of Russian soldiers in Afganistan in the 1980s, and I'm proud that we did. Was that wrong of us?
Read this. It's long, but it's worth your time.  The real irony of the situation is that Trump could do this today and have and have a tool to get the "violent anarchists" off the streets and he still won't.
Yo have you seen the Republicans against trump campaign that’s going on right now? I love it

AND if you had the ability to set aside your hatred &amp; pay attention, you would already know thousands upon thousands of men, women and children have been rescued from human/sex trafficking &amp; exploitation under Trump. Such a bad orange man.
Has anyone else noticed that all this crap about the virus, and economy, and BLM, and sports figures pushing agendas...all of those things have pretty much taken the focus of Joe Biden’s incompetence &amp; mental failings off our radar!  We need Trump to debate Biden!!
Obama-Biden was the worst presidential administration in my lifetime. I had to deplete my savings and almost shut my business down, but Donald Trump got elected and business picked up.
It’s coming . Brace for the war . As every Trump voter in GA I’ve met says is coming if Trump don’t win . Trump is following dictator 101 playbook.

People at this point want things to go back to the way they were before covid. Trump lost with Covid. There is not enough time to get back to normal.
And people rationalize his idiocracy but could never come up with this “concrete things” he’s ever thought or said. It’s just mind blowing how many people support this monster. These are trump’s OWN WORDS, not a commentary. 😂

Actually Biden's racial history makes Trump look like Mother Teresa.   Dems always call their opponents racist. In primary elections they accuse each other.  Biden was accused of racism during the Democrat Presidential debates. It's really the only arrow in their quiver.
Well, Trump is not God, and its not my job to determine the level of his faith. Christians believe God saves sinners. The Bible says we're all sinners.
You have quite a different view of history than the rest of the world.  This didn’t start with Trump or Gingrich or even Nixon.  Do you not remember Barry Goldwater?  Do you not remember Joseph McCarthy?  Right-wing BS has been going on for probably close to a century!
Sammy, if you're on Trump's side, you're on the side of racists. Period. Tap dance all you want, but that point will continue to be true, and damning for you.

I do not find it as racist as I find Joe Biden  Check his career and he never voted for any bill that helped African Americans which is why I find his statement as ironic. If Trump is racist he has hid it well as he has done numerous things like appealing Biden’s Crime bill

“To have a big convention is not the right time," the president said. "I have to protect the American people."

I swear, every right-minded citizen will need therapy after learning more and more specifics like this and putting a face to the horrible acts of murders and treason by the president. Trump era is causing brand new, deeply painful PTSD.
Always look for how Trump has compromised the mark. Kodak CEO made $$ on the stocks. Would be scrutinized in a sane world. Trump will claim Kodak has vaccine “almost ready,” practically daring Kodak to push back. If this money is dirty, they won’t push back. Trump 101.
Never forget that Donald Trump, lifelong New Yorker, took Sarah Palin out to get La Famiglia mall pizza in Times Square, which he ate with a fork.
He made a choice to ignore medical experts in the name of politics. He repeatedly downplayed the danger of the virus, attended a Trump rally where few were masked, and refused to wear a mask himself. I feel for his loved ones, but this was entirely self inflicted and preventable.
Well done. When ever I get mail from Trump, I put it right back in the mail box with “Return to Sender in the same font size as his signature
Funny how a Trump rally spreads Covid but riots don't.
You're extremely uninformed , bless your heart. Trump can't stop the state of California from reelecting Pelosi. States run their own elections. Go watch Schoolhouse Rock and find out how the government works, please.
Nah, you can tell when it switches from Trump to a voice impressionist.
In part my initial gut reaction was because so many of my friends are devil may care about the virus.  OR It’s just a fake virus created to hurt Trump’s re-election campaign.  Too many of my friends shared the Plandemic video (and now the Breitbart video).
I’ll be honest, I’m emotionally conflicted.  At first (go ahead and judge) I laughed to myself.  “Well, you didn’t social distance at a Trump rally and refused to wear a mask”
Herman Cain attended Tulsa rally without a mask! Irresponsible, reckless rally! Trump has Herman Cain’s blood on his hands! GOP party of know nothing leadership has politicized public Heath, and racism for sake of winning! Where’s nationwide public health policy! GOP Crickets!
Sorry Herm, you knew better. But you wanted to seek the approval of trump rather than the approval of God. Now you'll get a chance to explain to Him.
What say you  ? Staying on the Trump Train?
Why should Trump have any respect for the fraud that was John Lewis?
And who is to say that if Trump wins we will get someone in on the left in 2024? The evidence is there, Dem establishment dont give a shit about losing as long as their interests are protected. They will fuck over a progressive again in 4 years if need be.
of more Fascism. Like I said, pushing the party left will be a gradual process. Having a fucking Fascist as president does nothing but slow that process down. We can bully Biden into conceding on 1 or 2 issues, with Trump we cant do that
God Bless W, he's a better man than Trump will ever be
Please tell me how we fight neoliberalism by saying he's equal to Trump. You make no sense. Neoliberalism leads to Fascism yes, BUT WE HAVE ALREADY ARRIVED AT FASCISM. Biden being in office at least guarantees us 4 years without fascism. Which is objectively better than 4 years
Donald Trump is terrified that Kamala Harris will be the next Attorney General. If he loses, probability is very high that he will step down and let Pence pardon him before the next administration.
another 4 years as a black man is legit scary to me. And there is no evidence that Trump winning again will push the Dems further left, or somehow keep a candidate worse from him out in the future.
And this is UNDENIABLY a ground to vote for him. In fact it's the only one, considering being better than Trump in this context means neoliberalism over fascism, which once again I will take ANY day. And not to go full SJW here but the thought of Fascism being emboldened for
It’s very sad. It’s also sad that GOP pushes this fantasy that something as small as a wearing a face masks isn’t important.  Even after this trump will continue neglecting science
Donald Trump’s Tulsa rally killed Herman Cain. Incredible
Hermain Cain died of COvid-19?! That’s what his republican ass gets for going to that trump rally
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Now his concern for the health of citizens is fear of losing?  He can't win. If the world declared peace today and all the leaders of the world said it was due to Trump's leadership how would the Democrats spin it?
He got it at the Trump rally right?
deserves to be this old enabling fuck turtle. #MoscowMitch is Trump’s bitch. What a feckless coward?!

Biggest person exposing our secrets is Trump &amp; you do NOTHING! After talk with Putin he moves our German troops. When he loses election he will tell Putin more to get his hotel. And YOU DO NOTHING TO STOP HIM!  COWARDS!!!
I get condescending and dumb comments on Twitter. COVID is a virus, Trump could have shut down the whole country or left it open, it didn’t matter...state by state current results prove that whatever the decision was, had no effect. NY Cuomo killed more than any one politician.
Boomer? 100% sure I'm younger than you lol. But if you think Biden is a Fascist, will have open racists in his administration, take away protections for LGBT people in healthcare, deny the existence of climate change, idk what to tell you my guy. Biden can be bullied, Trump cant.
Trump has done more to stop the outrageous use of our military than any president in history
You’re delusional! When Obama was president, I lost my job of 15 years, my healthcare went up 400%, and sold my house for a loss. With Trump, I make well over 6 figures now, bought a house 3 years ago and has gone up 100k in value, and my 401k has doubled. All FACTS!
I remember when he was president, I lost my job of 15 years, my healthcare went up 400%, and sold my house for a loss. With Trump, I make well over 6 figures now, bought a house 3 years ago and has gone up 100k in value, and my 401k has doubled. These are all unexaggerated facts!
Well, I'm glad Sara Gideon has some issues &amp; thoughts in her head other then the one Susan Collins has held these last four years, the one where she only thinks about how she can kiss Donald Trump's ass to make him feel better.   Maine certainly should consider that one.
Ummmmm....became cognitively impaired??!!! Biden’s wife is a doctor. She parades him around by his arm. Hello!!! The guy is a puppet and Mrs joe Biden should be ashamed. Maybe we will be voting for her to get to the white house. TRUMP 2020!!!!!!!!!!!
Yes, we are very disappointed in you Susan Collins, even those not from Maine.   I hope your lips that have been spent kissing Donald Trump's ass these last four years will feel real sore come November 4th.

Mornin'. Yo, the media does not determine if HCQ is effective. Trump's own FDA, and the NIH have said that taking the drug is dangerous quackery. Your allegiance to man over country is how we get dictators. Be an American and do some damn critical thinking. Stop being a sheep.
Democratic campaign consultants are the worst! They gave us W and Trump. Complete incompetence, but they keep getting hired and make millions!
I don't know why  trump promotes  a crazy witch doctor over  real doctors
Wrong. Trump's base and Conservatives are an increasingly diverging venn diagram.  Your attitude is why Trump stands a good chance of loosing to a dementia patient.  If you simply go along with the GOP without checking them you are a useful idiot.
Like literally their whole platform is “we’re not Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell” which like... that bar is so low it is literally on the floor
Ok, that's great. Now fucking do something about it!  We're tired of hearing Trump,  Graham, and everybody else giving us lip service. ACTON, ACTION, ACTION!  DURHAM, DURHAM, DURHAM! Get it DONE! There is already enough evidence to support indictments. Convene the Grand Jury. ✌
100%  But this is true for trump as well. I'm certain that half of the real absurd racist screed he throws out is far too subtle. He doesnt know the history. Someone puts it in drafts, he thinks it sounds smart, then has to pretend that he meant something else.   Transparency
As a conservative who will vote for Trump because I am voting against Biden I disagree with your second sentence, your 3rd is only marginally true.  We need need more Eric Ericksons conservatives with a conscience and principles that transcend both culture and cult of personality
I agree there is a larger, systemic problem, and that NYC in particular has serious issues. But we also need to recognize that problematic police feel incredibly emboldened by Trump's support of practices that unethical, and in some cases illegal. The issues are linked
Yep, most Americans would agree.  “I really failed my fellow American citizens,” said Claudia Luckenbach-Boman. “If I were to vote again for Donald Trump in 2020, it would be just as much a failure as an American, but also a failure as a human being”
From the way things are going, it doesn't look like they're going to need his help at all. Trump's doing more than Bloomberg ever could. So "whatever it takes" could be a pack of gum.

This is the whole point. Muddy the water, and no one can KNOW what is really true. Next they deny the numbers. Insist infections are going down. This was all bc people pointed to hosp. #’s whenever Trump claimed it was just testing that made it seem high.
Trump doesn't have income to launder. He lets Russian mobsters launder money through his real estate holdings because otherwise he'd be bankrupt. Without that and licensing his name to scammer condo developers, he probably doesn't make enough rental income to cover the mortgages.
So you think Trump should fuck up the protestors? Or are you saying he invented racism?

The new Postmaster General that Trump appointed is slowing the mail down. In all the years I've lived in this house I've had mail every day but within the last 2 weeks there were days at a time that mail was not delivered. My absentee ballot came a week before that of my spouse.

Yeah except Trump couldn’t even eulogize his father without talking about himself the whole time. I can imagine him speaking about Herman Cain and filling it full of campaign BS
I think the thing is, Trump hears these nutty theories and maybe he starts to believe them. Then he decides to tweet about it. He’s either a fool, or trolling. Or a combination of both.

There is only one style of voting that is fault proof. The red China 100% all in favor. Which by the way is what Trump wish for his presidency. US goes from leader to joke of the world in 4 yrs.

Sorry, he didn't care enough about his family or staff.  Masks will not be mandatory at the event, which will be attended by President Trump. PEOPLE ARE FED UP!’  That tweet remains on Cain’s Twitter feed.
Hopefully this will wake Trump up!
No this is not Trump's fault and in no way I support Trump. He should have used common sense but instead he tried to make a political point.
No, nothing like that, actually. Those bankrupted companies were part of the Trump Org. Was he invlolved I. Daily management? Maybe not, but it was a lot different than a name sponsorship on a stadium
The government doesn’t “give” anything. It takes it from taxpayers and redistributes it to others. It is welfare and arguably theft. Both parties are at fault, and it would be congress passing it. Trump would sign or veto.
Obama was more successful than Trump as POTUS by every measure. Even before Covid, Trump’s GDP wasn’t growing any faster than Obama’s did. And now it just had the worst drop in history. Sad, but completely predictable

NO!!! Not poor taste at all. People like this (under pressure or not) defy NON-PARTISAN science to politicize an apolitical PANDEMIC in order to placate the unplacatable (trump). Maybe if a few more of these type deaths occurred their psychotic leader would yield.
is anyone else in awe that Donald Trump actually became our president or no?

Trump is a murderer. Plain and simple.
And he’s dead because of a fucking trump rally that never should have happened. Yep! The blood is on your hands
Don’t go to Trump rallies. Wear a mask. This virus is deadly serious. Prayers for his family.
In fact the whole Trump economy is flying  In the wrong direction...
He had beaten cancer years before. He was a health risk for COVID because of that.  The cancer didn’t kill Trump did.
RIP.   I’m filled with rage at Trump. The Tulsa rally was purely to feed his vanity.  He encouraged his supporters to scorn the most basic protective measures against the virus. How many good people will we lose because of this pathological narcissist?
Sorry Henry, Joe told you he wanted to delay the election. Stop giving trump the benefit of the doubt, he eventually says the quiet part out loud.

He got it at the Trump rally right?
But it was no big deal to the media clowns unti suggested by Trump.
I'm telling you, there will come a day when we'll say, "remember when we elected Trump for four years?" It'll be like when you tell stories from college with that tone of "it was crazy fun, but I was so stupid and how did I live through that."
I fucking hate Trump, but I want to see the "data" that confirms that it takes three weeks for us to see evidence of an outbreak of a virus that people usually only have for two once they contract it.
Remember when Trump couldn't fire Comey, pardon Stone, or sell nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia?
Obama and Biden left Trump a Pandemic Response Plan, a Pandemic Response Office, and 44 infectious disease experts in China which he ignored the plan and got rid of the office and disease experts
This is why I want every single Trump enabler to be voted out.
In the Trump era, it’s quaintly funny that Biden was previously able to take the “gaffe master” title when political competition was far less   Biden finally found a proper use of his “gaffes” now that “says what he means” is important to the electorate
Of course we will have an election and this will feed the conspiracy theory of “what if Trump won’t leave?”
What the actual FVCK??? Someone needs to get this motherfucker OUT!!
He wants to delay the election so he can stay in    Trump knows he is going to lose at this point and unable to change that
Hahahahaha! You only think they are voting for trump. Wait until they vote.
lol right?  Supreme Court: "You can't do that"  Trump: "Too bad. What are you gonna do?"
Why doesn't this tweet say:  "Only Congress can set the date of a presidential general election, contrary to Trump's tweet. The election will still be on Nov 3rd, 2020."
DAMNIT WE NEED TO GET RID OF TRUMP NOW
The Thurmond rule don't mean shit &amp; that lame duck session will see more rules made, judges appointed, pardons issued than your head can comprehend.  Trump's presidency won't end on Election Day even if it happens and even if he loses. Trust me. You think it's bad now? Just wait.
Plus I'm allergic to zinc. Maybe that is why Trump's face gets so red.

"Don't Count Trump Out" - for the record, I don't, mostly because Roger Stone is a free man and The National Enquirer still publishes.
The Democrats are good at a lot of things; fighting back and using the media to their advantage like Trump does, is not their forte. They prefer taking the high road. This country is just a few steps away from absolute fascism, they need to stop their measured resources &amp; FIGHT
Yes, I’m not a fan of that either. But it’s the way Trump says things that only fuels the fires of tribalism. Actions indeed speak louder than words but when you’re the president your words carry a tremendous amount of weight.

Spoken like a clueless, entitled white man. Have fun with that. Just remember that in Trump's Murica, you're just a tiny bit less entitled every single day. There will come a day when you'll be treated like us, then we'll see how "flatulent" it is.

I don't think there will be a debate. VP's yes, Trump/Biden no.  Trump is that polarizing, that crass, that much of a jerk that he may lose to a dementia patient.  If he would just act like he does without Twitter, when the journalist aren't there he would do better.
The only way Trump wins is if all the people who hate him stay home. Or if he cheats, but it would take A LOT of cheating. He is the most despised first term president in modern history.
Trump is correct. They are way behind, but, most of Europe is afraid of a large militarized German Army. Maybe Biden can strike a deal where they can put money towards US &amp; Canada budgets that defend Europe? Non compliance leaves them vulnerable to demagogues like Trump.

I mean that he wants to frame it as a wedge issue. I wanna open schools and help kids, dems wanna keep them closed. Problem is, voters en masse disapprove of how Trump has handled the issue.
Incumbents also usually win by having decent governing records and by negatively defining their challengers. Something that Trump has not been able to do as successfully as he did in 2016.

Agreed. I saw people saying the process to approve a vaccine could be rushed or influenced by Trump appointees for electoral purposes, but such a move would be met my mass resignations or firing of career health officials and would backfire tremendously.

A is plausible. But not plausible to be so major that a Trump blunder won't overshadow it.
Things can change if: A. Biden MAJORLY screws up.  B. Trump regains trust on handling the pandemic.
When Trump praises a “doctor” who believes that demon sex dreams cause STIs &amp; vaccines have alien DNA, or spitballs ideas UV rays &amp; bleach injection COVID treatments, you see it as a problem for his re-election prospects. Most of us see a person unfit for any office.

Never forget that Donald Trump, lifelong New Yorker, took Sarah Palin out to get La Famiglia mall pizza in Times Square, which he ate with a fork.
Beat cancer and got killed because of a Trump rally. Covid karma can be a bitch when you don't believe.
Cain attended President Donald Trump's June 20 rally in Tulsa, where he tweeted a photo of himself surrounded by people not wearing masks.
Racism, smoking, being a trump supporter all come to mind for me.
He made a choice to ignore medical experts in the name of politics. He repeatedly downplayed the danger of the virus, attended a Trump rally where few were masked, and refused to wear a mask himself. I feel for his loved ones, but this was entirely self inflicted and preventable.
We must do MORE THAN JUST TALK ABOUT THE divisiveness and ills of Trump. He MUST BE VOTED OUT along with other members of Congress who are divisive and DO NOT WANT The United States of America to be TRULY UNITED AS ONE GREAT NATION! ONE LOVE! Aliciadine
Work is temporary because our lives are temporary. This nation is made up of flawed people trying to figure it out on this journey we call life. The difference is that some men like Bush, Clinton and Obama have a shared leadership in unifying America. DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT!
Indeed, I think after looking at this picture, although these men made mistakes as well, their intent to make America great were something that they shared. I think many of us realize the MISTAKE in having LITTLE MAN DONALD TRUMP IN OFFICE!
DONALD TRUMP has done more DAMAGE TO AMERICA in 3 years than ALL of these presidents TOGETHER. They were all two term presidents. These are men who believe in America! Donald Trump believes in  are TOO IGNORANT TO SEE THAT Trump is using you!WAKE UP!
Wait...so it is safe for kids to go back to school. It is safe to reopen businesses, but it ISN'T safe to go vote?  Typical GOP/Trump logic
The sad part about this statement from you Aysh is that you are TOO IGNORANT to know when someone DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU! Donald Trump does NOT CARE ABOUT YOU! He is the MOST DIVISIVE PRESIDENT IN OUR HISTORY!Calling women bitches and whores, mexicans rapists and thugs, WAKE UP!
I say this to you Renny Guarde, LITTLE MAN DONALD TRUMP has called women like your mother bitches and whores, Mexicans rapists, and even talked about white people. Check how little you think of yourself by voting this racist, natcissistic bully back into office. I don't THINK SO!
I say this to you Krista and to every women in the USA. This Little man Donald Trump has called women on several occasions bitches and whores, he has made fun of a person in a wheelchair, called Mexican people rapists and thugs and black athletes assholes. Check yourselves!
Trump supports the police and the Democrats hate the police, that's all you need to know for this election. #CopsforTrump
McConnell is arguably worse than Trump
These tweets seem to be stirring up the EVIL within you. Good and decent spirits cannot be amongst the EVIL inside of you! It seems that Donald Trump was NOT INVITED to the homegoing of John Lewis because he stood for things that Trump has NO CLUE ABOUT, INTEGRITY, PEACE, CLASS!
Nah, you can tell when it switches from Trump to a voice impressionist.
What if that was the point. With so many in the media questioning whether the election could get delayed, now that Trump is suggesting it the media and the left will state unequivocally it won’t be delayed.
OMG I needed this laugh, thank you my dear! We must ALL WORK TOGETHER to get TRUMP far away from America! He is tearing away at the fabric and leading us in the WRONG DIRECTION! R.I.P. John Lewis! love you as the MAN OF GOD YOU ARE! ONE LOVE! Aliciadine
The government doesn’t “give” anything. It takes it from taxpayers and redistributes it to others. It is welfare and arguably theft. Both parties are at fault, and it would be congress passing it. Trump would sign or veto.
What say you  ? Staying on the Trump Train?
Donald Trump is terrified that Kamala Harris will be the next Attorney General. If he loses, probability is very high that he will step down and let Pence pardon him before the next administration.
NO!!! Not poor taste at all. People like this (under pressure or not) defy NON-PARTISAN science to politicize an apolitical PANDEMIC in order to placate the unplacatable (trump). Maybe if a few more of these type deaths occurred their psychotic leader would yield.
Donald Trump’s Tulsa rally killed Herman Cain. Incredible
And he’s dead because of a fucking trump rally that never should have happened. Yep! The blood is on your hands
In fact the whole Trump economy is flying  In the wrong direction...
He had beaten cancer years before. He was a health risk for COVID because of that.  The cancer didn’t kill Trump did.
Nah, you not gonna try and frame this. He died of COVID-19.  Trump msg killing people.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
He got it at the Trump rally right?
deserves to be this old enabling fuck turtle. #MoscowMitch is Trump’s bitch. What a feckless coward?!
I fucking hate Trump, but I want to see the "data" that confirms that it takes three weeks for us to see evidence of an outbreak of a virus that people usually only have for two once they contract it.
Remember when Trump couldn't fire Comey, pardon Stone, or sell nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia?
Obama and Biden left Trump a Pandemic Response Plan, a Pandemic Response Office, and 44 infectious disease experts in China which he ignored the plan and got rid of the office and disease experts
What the actual FVCK??? Someone needs to get this motherfucker OUT!!
DAMNIT WE NEED TO GET RID OF TRUMP NOW
We knew that was coming. Trump floats election ‘delay’ amid claims of voting fraud  #SmartNews
All no Republican stand up to this? It’s not his choice? He wants the country to open and schools to open but delay the election?? Fuck Donald Trump.
Why would she boost for Trump?
Yes, I’m not a fan of that either. But it’s the way Trump says things that only fuels the fires of tribalism. Actions indeed speak louder than words but when you’re the president your words carry a tremendous amount of weight.
Congress should stop his paycheck. The Erican people should not be paying for Trump’s personal attorney
If you support this piece of shit, it's because you are one. It's really that simple. You can be a conservative, you can be a Republican, but you CANNOT be a Trump supporter and stand behind this man and not be a shit human.

CNN Don Lemon interviewing the Governor of Portland who stated that the federal agents from Trump are leaving the city! She also states the vast majority of protesters are PEACEFUL, not just in Portland but across the country!
Little Man Donald Trump you are steadfast on sending federal agents into Portland. However, they have seen through your mental rants and are now LEAVING THE CITY OF PORTLAND! The vast majority of protests in Portland and across the country are PEACEFUL! AMERICA SEES THROUGH YOU!
Lindsay Graham is one of Trumps henchman who he has in his pocket. Lindsay Graham is the man who stated over my dead body will I GIVE Americans who need it most right now, the extra 600 per week in unemployment. To him and other Trump supporters. YOU ARE AS IGNORANT AS THEY ARE!
I hope I’ll control the chaos that all of Carmen Sandiego’s crooks would’ve caused in Portland now that Oregon’s governor made the ICE &amp; CBP agents withdraw from the city.  I imagine that only Trump &amp; those federal agents would provoke V.I.L.E. to put up a fight.
Trump and your goons double down on what you want! Where was the concern or doubling down for white police officers who killed George Floyd? Where is the doubling down on the white racists who wanted to lynch a governor lately? You people are a joke. Racist Lindsay Graham! ENOUGH
Senator Lindsey Graham are you a racist? Because based on your ads that is what people of color are saying. America is looking at Donald Trump and anyone who is associated with him with regards to the poor handling of race relations! I can see you also need to be VOTED OUT!LEARN
There are people in your base along with your colleagues who are NOT wearing a mask because you have CHOSEN NOT TO LEAD EFFECTIVELY DONALD TRUMP! Because you DON'T take THE TRUMP VIRUS SERIOUSLY so THEY DON'T EITHER!

Polls showing that Biden and Trump are tied in the Georgia polls at 47%. This is a state that has been Republican for the last 8 years. Americans are showing they are NOT satisfied with the way Trump has handled the Coronavirus, race relations, the economy and his poor leadership

LITTLE MAN DONALD TRUMP WANTS EVERYONE TO RETURN TO WORK, in the middle of a pandemic that is  growing worse. He has NO NATIONAL PLAN to show how this is supposed to happen in the wake of the virus. NOW HE WANTS TO PUT OUR CHILDREN IN DANGER BY SAYING THEY MUST RETURN TO SCHOOL!
Maybe we can turn Georgia blue!! We’re working on it!
YOU ARE THE ONE WHO IS WEAK LITTLE MAN DONALD TRUMP! You have NO class/integrity. You are a bully trying to make people feel small to make yourself look bigger. Only a SMALL MAN would send federal agents into a state for YOU! PLAYING POLITICAL GAMES ON YOUR COLLEAGUES AND BASE!
NEVER before in the history of America has a president FAILED US MORE than LITTLE MAN DONALD TRUMP! He has SURRENDERED his efforts in just simply wearing a mask to protect citizens from the Coronavirus. He does not discuss systemic racism! HE HAS GIVEN UP ON YOU! ENOUGH OF THIS!
Don't you have a NATIONAL PLAN TO GO OVER so that we can exit out of this Coronavirus? Ignorant, racist, narcissistic little man Donald Trump! America CANNOT DO ANOTHER 4 YEARS OF THIS SMALL MENTAL CASE AND HIS MERRY BAND OF IDIOTS!VOTE THEM ALL OUT NOW!

Ummmmm....became cognitively impaired??!!! Biden’s wife is a doctor. She parades him around by his arm. Hello!!! The guy is a puppet and Mrs joe Biden should be ashamed. Maybe we will be voting for her to get to the white house. TRUMP 2020!!!!!!!!!!!
Trump is no longer worried about voters. Steps are well under way to steal it again.
Dear Nancy Pelosi, Unethical trump needs to be removed from office before the election. He is doing everything he can to destroy our country even before the election. You and colleagues must stop him.
tRump would get the opportunity to fill another SC judge &amp; more conservatives on fed courts. Today he rolled back fair housing. None of that effects you though. With friends like you Blacks don’t need enemies.
I would rather see Kamala Harris as the next AG so she can go after Barr and the entire Trump Admin.
Yeah it does, tRump has called BLM terrorist organization, he just waiting for RBG to die and you wanna say Biden/Harris is equal to tRump. GtFOH.

Now she show a backbone.  Diss she still believe Trump learned his lesson? Senators and House reps like her are i it for kickbacks and big companies and not for the American Citizens. History will tag her actions to enabling Trump, his gestapo, and the failed virus response.
I’m sure there’s gonna be lots of first time voters there voting for Trump. Myself included 😊
I don't think there will be a debate. VP's yes, Trump/Biden no.  Trump is that polarizing, that crass, that much of a jerk that he may lose to a dementia patient.  If he would just act like he does without Twitter, when the journalist aren't there he would do better.
the white terrorists are equally as horrible as the black terriorst.  donald trump does not embrace violence of any kind.  the terrorists are demanding equality in the democratic cities, and states as Dems have done nothing for the Blacks. there are bad Blacks and bad whites !

Trump 2020!  Keep it up Mr. President.  You are the hardest working President I have ever seen and an inspiration to Americans!
Well, Trump is psychologically damaged, doesn’t know how to be a leader &amp; should never have been elected. Barr, on the other hand, has a choice. He knows better but willingly lies &amp; subverts the constitution to cover up &amp; suck up. He has chosen evil.

As a conservative who will vote for Trump because I am voting against Biden I disagree with your second sentence, your 3rd is only marginally true.  We need need more Eric Ericksons conservatives with a conscience and principles that transcend both culture and cult of personality

Yep, most Americans would agree.  “I really failed my fellow American citizens,” said Claudia Luckenbach-Boman. “If I were to vote again for Donald Trump in 2020, it would be just as much a failure as an American, but also a failure as a human being”

Whitey Bulger was 88 when Trump's Bureau of Prisons let him be murdered.

That’s BS. Biden has no cognitive issues &amp; Trump is the same he’s always been - a delusional narcissist (well, that may be an oxymoron).

You appointed your very good friend and Trump Fundraiser as the Postmaster General and now you're saying the mail in ballots are fraud! I call bullshit!
Is this the first confirmed death of somebody who attended the Trump rally in Tulsa? I know contact tracing is difficult when folks ignore protocols, but the timeline certainly makes it possible (likely, even) that he contracted the virus at that time.
Dang. Herman Cain died after getting COVID while not wearing a mask at that Trump rally.
Trump was asking a question in lieu of the fraudulent mail-in voting that has taken place in NY.  Only Congress can delay the election and he knows that.  Would you rather have an honest election or one that we know will be fraudulent? That is the question he is really asking.
Boy you can’t tell the Trump thumpers that’s...it’s crazy how delusional people can be when it means you get to say nigger
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is for the first time floating a “delay” to the Nov. 3 presidential election, as he makes unsubstantiated allegations that increased mail-in voting will result in fraud.
This is how we get a dictator right fucking here. He knows he might lose, and he doesn’t want to take that chance. Idc if you supported Trump earlier this morning, you have to see the danger of this statement and at the very least reconsider. This is bigger than any party.
Trump will win. Republicans will retake the house, hold the senate. In a landslide. Because this shit is supported by democrats. And we see you.
If one of my grandchildren get covid because Brian Kemp and Donald Trump forced schools to reopen, I will do everything I can to see that they pay for the pain and death they have caused to our children. That is a promise.

Some people can’t help but spread hate and try to be demeaning to those with different opinions. I’m not a Trump supporter either, but I also don’t believe that he told people to inject chemicals. I do think a sitting president should be a little more careful of their word choice
He's dillusional to still believe Russian narrative. President Trump has been harder on Russia than any administration since the wall came down.

A Lowndes County judge overturns the removal of a controversial anti-Trump billboard ... And the billboard battle begins.
Once again the democrats demonstrate how big of a joke they are. Just like the Kavanaugh hearings, the Russia Collusion fiasco and the Impeachment proceedings. The democrats show how pathetically inept and immensely desperate they are. MAGA! Trump 4 more years!!!
Hey Trump, go to Twitter and do a search on resisters. That should answer your question.
Wait. Let me get the straight, the construction company that built Trump Tower was owned by the mob?  So technically the mob built Trump Tower. Interesting.
It WAS big news until the corrupt MSM quashed the story. They want people to get sick and die so they can blame Trump. They (MSM) don’t care who gets hurt as long as they get their agenda across.
Stick to bad acting.   Trump IS the boss.
Too dumb for the job.   Lincoln Project co-founder met with Trump for campaign role in 2016  via
They'd rather die than credit Trump with saving their lives.   They're THAT insane.
Obama said that the "AMERICAN dream is to be Donald Trump."  And that explains why he hates Trump so much–he HATES AMERICA.
So I searched google for Trump fighting sex trafficking, got nothing but story after story bashing Trump. Did same search on bing, and got all articles on all the sex trafficking rings busted under  Great job
How many times y’all think Trump has tested positive for COVID?
Yeah ... it’s actually Trump who will be ‘thrown out’ very soon ... story was always backwards ... 😎😎😎
Was Trump really ever asked to throw out the first pitch? No one can believe anything he says ...
Hey y’all, please don’t let Trump win this year. Please don’t let that man get another four years by doing joke write-ins like the last election. Voting is serious and I know there aren’t too many good options, but let’s choose the best over the worst please.
I've been thinking we need better science ed but now I believe ethics courses are likely more important. We are being slaughtered in the name of personal ambition. Coronavirus ravaged Florida, as Ron DeSantis sidelined scientists and followed Trump

Only eight states currently meet the WHO requirements for 'safe' reopening, and (shockingly!) none of them are led by Trump supporters—instead, they are all Democratic or swing states.
Wrong. Trump doesn't.

I love Apple products for privacy and consistent great products. Politically, I don’t like Apple though. Trump as a leader done well for the past 3.5 years in terms of business, jobs. Trump needs to work on his personality. He is not charismatic or father like.
JOHN ROBERTS is a major disappointment, inconsistent justice. Trump needs to add 2 more conservative justices as soon as possible. Trump needs 4 more years and then we likely need Mike Pence afterwards to nominate 2 or more conservative Justices!!!
Judge Roberts is a disappointment. He is not consistent. Trump needs to add 2 more conservative justices as soon as possible.
Liberals does not support Antifa. They overlook Antifa bad behaviors, because they want Trump to lose election and want to gain power. They are fool to think Antifa won’t take over Liberals as well. Antifa wants to TRANSFORM America to a new America where they rule the land.

The fix is in on the election. That will be your mailed in ballot they don't count because it arrives late. Trump and his basket of deplorables must go.
Press/Media/democratic mayors are putting on blinders. They want Trump gone! We need to Reform Media. I miss objective reporting. Every hour is bias. We need balance. Where are the conversative media (youtube, I guess)

So soccer moms in bike helmets are what trump and his storm troopers consider to be terrorists and anarchists and use that to justify attacking them. As a veteran and former military police I want to say you guys are a disgrace to the uniform and your oath of office!
trump has a call with Putin today. Topics discussed included coronavirus control and nuclear arms. Topics not discussed-Russian bounties on American troops nor Russian hacking of coronavirus research (didn't know about that did you!). #trumpisatraitor

Rand Paul is an idiot. Cuomo bought his city from being the epicenter to being one  of the first states to begin recovering. He and the PO💩 in the WH would be well to follow his lead instead of attacking him because trump doesn't like him!
