trump just farted.
That's cool you're not voting for Trump then
Because in the world that we live in, school is going to open in the fall. Trump won't let those policies pass, therefore it's stupid to put the economy over kids and their parent's lives.
He wants to make himself look good for his non-existent future in politics, but too cowardly to publicly oppose Trump for his non-existent future in politics.
Those countries also have already existing infrastructure and much smaller general class sizes. Not to mention that even if Dems could pass it as soon as possible, Trump would still be President as Fall comes around. It makes literally zero sense unless you live in fantasy land.
Republicans have set us back 30 years. Mitch McConnell and the Trump Administration are two of the worst things that have ever happened to this country.

A rant about how Trump pronounced it correctly
First, Biden wasn‚Äôt President. Second, you mean Trump did more in 3 years to destroy this country
Every one of the 150,000+ deaths from the virus are on Trump's hands because of his lacking. Every life SAVED here in MI, is because of you. You're our hero. We just got you! As brilliant a V.P. as you'd be, we cant give you up! #PLEASE STAY
Trump promises that the Space Force will be mining and distributing Trump CheeseTM from the Moon.

DON'T LIKE THE WAY TRUMP IS DOING IT NO OTHER PRESIDENT WOULD DO IT
So terribly sad to see what's become of this country.  True patriotism is dead.
Trump invents his supposed rights out of thin air. Trouble is, his Republican allies believe ‚Äúmight makes right‚Äù! They‚Äôd scream and holler and fight tooth and nail if the tables were turned.

I don't even know if you'll see this, but I'm gonna take a wild guess as to why you blocked me. You liked my post, but then saw my profile and saw that I'm anti-Trump and support BLM. Accurate?
Bro Wtf. It's bad enough that we have Trump and Devos spewing this bs but now the most powerful Democrat in the senate is too? Get this fool out of here.

In other news, I have come to the realization that the college football equivalent for Joe Biden is Pitt and for Trump it's Wazzu
"That he‚Äôs okay with siphoning off Black votes from the Democratic nominee, thus helping Trump. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not denying it, I just told you. To say that the Black vote is Democratic is a form of racism and white supremacy.‚Äù"
Trump wants to dictate! And all too often we let him.
priceless..This qualifies him to be an official Trump son..
Trump and his administration are pathetic
Trump is not perfect - I think he says these things to get a rise out of liberals. My brother did it to me and my father would tell me - ignore it if it is not true. You guys fall for it every time.
And MAGA dolts will lap it up like ... like suckling pigs lap at the the teat.  While they pause from writing checks to the NRA looters and the Trump friends and family ‚ÄúCampaign‚Äù slush fund.  While meekly agreeing to eliminate regulations keeping their air and water clean.  Wh..
Joe Biden doesn't act like he knows more than the health experts. Trump ignores the health experts which causes confusion. We need a president who doesn't think he's "a natural". #COVID19 #Coronavirus #JoeBiden #TrumpHoaxedAmerica

Let's keep our footing on solid ground. Biden is not perfect, probably no white person is when it comes to representing blacks. However, Biden is much better than Trump.
I did not realize black voters  appointed Trump as their spokesperson.

Excellent.  ...briefed by military in 2017 on levels American and Russian nuclear arsenals reduced...Trump demanded US increase its nuclear stockpile tenfold. According to some reports, this was what prompted the Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, to call the president a ‚Äúmoron.‚Äù

The most comical part about Trump attacking Biden on his religion is the fact that the attacks are coming from a thrice married philandering thief who raped his first wife and laughed about a man bleeding out on the floor.
Wait God is a black woman! That‚Äôs not God‚Äòs hand so it must be Satan! I knew it! Trump followers are all part of the largest Satanic cult the worlds ever seen! And I have proof! They‚Äôre all satanists just you wait, the truth will come out soon!
I used to think the "Trump Derangement Syndrome" was just a cheap way to deflect valid criticism but on reflection it's pretty obvious that ppl often stop thinking and say really dumb shit when they've made up their mind the person they're talking about is wrong/evil
Been doing this for years. Noticed a pattern: If a story was very good for Obama or very bad for Trump then they wouldn't acknowledge it exists for almost 12hrs until the far right media can coordinate their talking points. Then they spin aggressively. Exception 2012 election

That's a completely different video. And how the fuck am I a pedophile? It is an excuse because you refuse to acknowledge Trump's pedophilia. You see videos of Trump groping his own daughter's ass and bragging about sexual assault and DON'T see wrongdoing? Ya. You're a hypocrite.

Ok bud, I think we‚Äôve beaten this to death.  Although I disagree with you on the Trump is a pedo claim you are implicitly making, I wish you well.  That‚Äôs all I have to say to you.
For the umpteenth time.  Wishing maxwell well is not in any way evidence of Trump being a pedo.  Why must you die on that hill? He also said let the government prove the charges.  That‚Äôs the right approach to take and probably all he should have said.
Well finally something we can agree on...Trump was unwise in wishing her well...precisely because people like you will take it as evidence he‚Äôs a pedo.  But he says and tweets alot of unwise things.  That doesn‚Äôt mean his statement was sympathetic to her alleged crimes.
And what is the clear evidence you saw with your own eyes in that interview that Trump is a pedo.  Please don‚Äôt make it up.
Look, I‚Äôm not tied to anything but saying that your posts are the injustice here because you are trying to label the president a pedo on no substantive evidence.  You can believe what you want...but ask yourself if those beliefs simply reflect hatred of Trump.

Why not? She's shutting down the NRA. Trump Org is next.
You said Trump wished her well on the pedo charges.  You simply made that up.  Whether there is evidence to convict her has nothing to do with What Trump said nor in any way suggests he‚Äôs a pedo.
All good questions. I also heard that people didn't fill it out because Trump or Biden wasn't on it. Lots of voters are in the habit of ignoring primaries or misunderstanding them.
Trump, moron or sadist? I've heard it both ways.

They are both nearly equally terrible, obviously Trump is worse for human rights. But they're both pedos and in Trumps case a definite rapist. Biden could be as well we just don't know yet. And Biden is a huge unknown, he could be worse than we even imagined if he wins.
Yeah, I totally get that get that. And Trump is definitely a worse person than Biden, my tweet was mostly just referring to the fact that IF we had Trump another 4 years at least we'd be done with him after that.
Notice Trump never tweets about your interviews
That's not how I feel, I was just making a statement. I definitely don't prefer Trump to Biden.............. And I wasn't 100% serious about the Bernie tweet. It's Twitter.......  I really have no idea what to do so don't judge based on two tweets.
You gotta to be Bobo the Clown not to see that Kanye is Trump‚Äôs straw candidate to pull away some black votes.  A vote for Kanye is a Vote for Trump.  It‚Äôs sad that people would take advantage of a obviously mentally sick person.  But nothing is too low for this administration.

Trump keeps changing reason on against vote by mail. Some time ago he claimed he would prob lose if vote by mail. Now he claims fraud. Stop the insanity. Choose  health/death vs not voting. Trump will go anything to win-legal or not. Must be stopped.
Trump excuse changing  over yrs. Sometime ago-- vote by mail could cause more voters to vote against him. Now he is using ruse vote by mail fraud. He just want to disenfranchise voters. Do it make choice health/death vs vote. Stop the insanity!!
Got to d o something. Floated long before now Trump has contended that vote by mail could vote him out of office-more voter voting against him. Now contends voting fraud. Choose between  health/death or right to vote. Trump/Rep's most be stopped!
For someone who does seem to like tRump, you are awfully interested in what the other side has to say. Why don't you just swipe on by?

So tell me again how Trump wished Maxwell well on ‚Äúchild sex trafficking charges‚Äù.  Just add the words you want to believe you read to what Trump actually said.  Trump‚Äôs  real view on the charges was the correct one...let the government prove them.
As for wishing the best for Maxwell....again what exactly does that prove?  You guys simply don‚Äôt have a pedo case to make vs Trump.  Remember, it‚Äôs your burden to prove Trump is a pedo.  You have not come anywhere close to meeting that burden.
You realize that this virus came from China not Mar-A-Lago or Trump towers... Your stupidity is not going to get Biden elected.

No accusations?  The intent of your posts is clearly to lead the reader to conclude Trump is a Pedo.  &amp; don‚Äôt put words into my mouth.  Never called Biden a pedo.  I said there is more basis in that one video to conclude Biden is a pedo than you guys have to say the same of Trump

No. Trump lied. Plain and simple.
This is one of those things that because much of the online left doesn't treat the Trump campaign seriously, they can't see that there's obviously to targeted votes within the catholic vote he's going after. So we get "LOL, Catholics and 2nd Amendment!" and Pope tweets f/ pundits

Their confidence that Kanye will take more Black voters from Biden than likes-voting-for-weird-celebrities voters from Trump is probably unfounded.

One more thing and then this is over.  There is more basis to claim Biden is a pedo in this vid than everything you and your Trump is a pedo cohorts have come up with in these tweets.
E. Trump was/is part of the international bank fraud, money-laundering and espionage that Epstein and Maxwell master-minded.
How long till we get a trump tweet that just says "READ THE MANUALS!"
Just like you guys have nothing to prove Trump‚Äôs past relationship with Epstein makes him a pedo.  No guilt by association in this country right?  BTW, you think if there was a credible pedo case vs Trump that the Dems, NYT, WaPo, etc., wouldn‚Äôt have made it by now?
And the facts you point out show what?  You are implying that the real estate deal is the reason Trump banned Epstein from Mar a Lago...as opposed to Epstein‚Äôs sexual misconduct.  To me the court filing supporting the latter makes more sense.
Trump always sits like this. He has balance issues that have become more severe.
Look, the whole debate here is over the attempts you guys are making to establish that Trump is a pedo because of his past social and/or business relationship with Epstein.  Neither Trump nor I have to prove otherwise.  You guys have that burden..and you‚Äôve failed.
You‚Äôve earned it baby......now let‚Äôs get TRUMP OUTTA THERE!!!!
Unfortunately I don‚Äôt care what Trump supporters think. Go Gov Whitmer, you‚Äôre welcome to move to Florida or Texas. See how that works out for ya

Don‚Äôt forget that the court limiting ballots to those received on Election Day. With Trump attacking the USPS it‚Äôs going to make this even harder.
Trump has lost his mind.

If you take the perspective the Trump administration is attempting to do as much harm to the US as possible, does it make sense now?
I'm just curious, can you give me one example of Trump governing like Hitler?
And you tweet this as Trump is trying to BAN #tiktoc because creative teens schooled his fat ass about Tulsa   So  just which 1st Amendment are you preaching to the choir about?  Does Nestor have Tik To?
Yes my dear he most certainly is I don't know if you're old enough to remember Joe McCarthy everyone was a communist in his book and I do mean everyone. I fully expect one day to see mr. Trump institutionalized in a place for the clinically insane
IKR!  I cringe when I see Trump signs in St. Clair Shores, I guess the narrative of "lazy people who don't belong here are coming to take what you've worked for" kinda grabs folks by the fear centers in the brain and resonates.
Let's keep our footing on solid ground. Biden is not perfect, probably no white person is when it comes to representing blacks. However, Biden is much better than Trump.

Fuck Donald Trump for his anti-news rhetoric. This dude has absolutely decimated legit credibility with none other than false hysteria. Damn you, Mr. President.
You might wanna double check that. No member of Trump's immediate family has EVER served in the military. I would think his brother would be considered immediate family.
If Trump really cared about American workers.He would‚Äôve brought his manufacturing jobs,back from China,long ago.

My dumb ass voted Hillary.  I thought for sure she would win.   I was wrong.  I‚Äôm voting trump this year.  Biden is to far right for my vote. Trump is a protest vote.  If he wins he could completely destroy so many corporate creations. Need to nominate a real Dem in 24.
That would be great but it isn‚Äôt going to happen.  Voting to just not have trump is a waste of time.  It‚Äôs like a battered wife staying with the husband who beats her.  I‚Äôm out.  This shitty party has wasted enough of my time.  But good luck. Hope it works out for you.
If I lived through Joe Biden voting with Republicans from 1973-2009 to make himself wealthy and screw the working class...... you can make another 4 years of trump.

Trump‚Äôs constant lying,is disrespectful,to the flag,and to the troops who have fought bravely,to protect it.
I bet you every threat came from Trump supporters. I guarantee it. You have Trump's leadership or lack thereof to thank for that.
That's code for black people living in inner cities. One thing Trump knows is at least 50% of his voters are on some level racist and loyal to him. I guarantee he can call black people the N word on national TV and won't lose one vote. In fact, he might even gain a few votes.

Just explained to my family that I can‚Äôt vote for trump or Biden because neither of them made Late Registration. Neither of them could make a record like Yeezus. My uncle asked me if I was on crack
Thank you Trump very cool!
Remind me what branch of the military cadet bone spurs was in or anyone else from his family since they came to this country. I'm a dem and never miss a chance to pile on the anti-American repubelicons but John McCain was a hero and more American than Trump could ever be. Lemming
Trump‚Äôs evil ineptitude and narcissism has cost my country it‚Äôs standing in the world. Not listening to others more knowledgeable (a rather low bar) and lead through a pandemic has cost 1000s of American lives. His violation of all things law &amp; order is abhorrent. #LincolnVoter
Trump is never wrong.
Oh please.  And you promote the dolt trump. Who cant even pronounce a national park....

We do. Joe Biden is a decent man who has spent 40 years of his life serving the nation. Trump is a crook who has spent just as long ripping people off.
The Trump Library will be fully mobile qnd pushed through the cell block by Brooks Hatlen.
You should do something about that then man. The difference could not be more clear! Trump is incompetent and puts his own personal profit ahead of our safety. Biden is neither of those. For that reason alone Trump must go.
Trump needs to demand,that Barron‚Äôs school must be opened,on time
But the second one on the President. Well I don't think they were talking about Trump at the time. Because the way I see it he dosen't know very much of anything. And the other way I see it is. I rhink the jury is still out on him.
I'm aware of President Trump making that accusation against Michigan SoS, Jocelyn Benson. I can't speak for other states, but I can tell you with absolutely certainty that here in Michigan every registered voter received a ballot request application, not an unsolicited ballot.

Remember Senate Republicans who dismissed Trump‚Äôs wrongdoing ‚Äî and show them the door
So I have been thinking hard about your logic here. BUT I think I get now. Come Nov, if Trump wins, results can be legally challenged in court, that Trump really LOST election because of mail-in voter fraud. Not that the results will need to be challenged.  #MailInVoting
This mornin' the "President" of the United States declared "children are immune" to COVID-19.Trump will kill us all. Entire second-grade class in Georgia school forced into COVID quarantine after just one day
So was Trump.
Then there is always the bloody,Bowling Green massacre,and the fake,Civil War monument,that Trump placed on one of his golf courses.Trump is an expert in fakery.
My nephew's wife ( a trump supporter) thinks kids should go back to school. Not her kids, they're adults. And when her kids were little they went to private school, with 7 kids per class.
Your profile says you live in Colorado.   Colorado is the gold standard when it comes to mail in voting.  Election fraud is rare. President Trump is promoting a false narrative because he is behind in most election polls. He's planting a seed to cast doubt on the election results
In 2016 Trump running opposed got about 480,000 votes Joe Biden, even with people still voting for Bernie Sanders who got 500,000 votes, just got over 800,000.
Eric Trump eats paste  Eric Trump runs with scissors   Eric Trump doesn‚Äôt work and play well with others  Eric Trump slugged his second grade music teacher. Oh, that was his daddy sorry.
Trump has no way of knowing,whether or not,it will be ‚Äúvery safe‚Äù to vote in November.Donald and Ivanka Trump,happily carry out business with CHINA,an extremely repressive,Marxist State.Which is the birthplace of the deadly‚ÄùTrump virus.‚ÄùThe deep state and the media have a nonsense narrative... all foreign nation, terrorist group, would like to get out Trump and America first... including Canada, Mexico and maybe England too..
Because he‚Äôs spreading false info. I really don‚Äôt think Trump is gonna kiss you
That fatass pig is also suing a TV station in Wisconsin on behalf of the Trump campaign. So you want to know how crooked the election is and will be? Just ask the crybaby who's whining about mail ballots because he's already busy cheating.

I can‚Äôt wait to see what Kayleigh says when a reporter tells her we already have this in Obamacare. How will she spin this? Trump is delusional.
Just in time for Trump to award him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
What a crock of BS. If Scott was smart enough to be a Trump supporter in 2016, he would still be a Trump supporter today! There is now logic to this unless he only watches CNN or MSN-BS!!!!!!! Bogus!!!!!
Just because some kids embarrassed him he wants to go after a dancing app? Fuck Trump! Do real work and leave it alone
Jason Nichols: Biden's take on AA voters and 'diversity' was not wrong   ‚Å¶ wondering if your characterization would be the same if Trump said it? As we always say, if not for double standards the left would have none at all.
if you are seriously asking, here is the serious answer: Donald Trump dying from Covid-19.  Of course, President Pence would be trying to create a Theocracy to enshrine his bizarre beliefs in law.
They should give Trump peyote, then turn on the Coyotes game. Then tell him Mexico got a hockey team send tweet
Okay, but what if i were taking a walk with Donald Trump? Could I leave him behind to be eaten by a bear? Please? Pretty please? Mother may I?
I told Hillary in 16 that she needs Chinese bots to defeat Trump's Russian bots. She didn't listen therefore she didn't get elected. Biden's campaign did! You win by fighting fire with fire!!! He gets it!
Look at their profile to make sure MAGA not included. Or Trump 2020. Or Confederate flags. Or libtards. You know, all the key words.
Trump's new postmaster general ordered them to sort mail by hand instead of using the machines. He is purposely creating a backlog to mess with the election.
You realize we've always been divided right? It's just that every President we've had at least tried to unite us except this one well that is if you can even call Trump a President...more like a Hollywood entertainer.
I mean there's 78 million active monthly fortnite players who i'm sure would scream nonstop to their parents about how much they hate trump if they couldn't play anymore...
After the sell wechat order, if tencent decided to say, block all americans from fortnite and league of legends, could they leverage that into an anti-trump movement?
Comparing bush to trump makes bush look much better. Having said that bush was a historically bad president by almost every measure. Even a lame horse looks good next to a jackass.
I mean, member when she also said ‚ÄúDonald Trump is not going to be President. You can take that to the bank. He‚Äôs not gonna be president.‚Äù Lolz
It should.  Donald Trump is the culmination of five decades of GOP strategy, policy, and propaganda. All of those fine, upstanding GOP Reps and Senators are complicit, so is the GOP rank and file,  and so are you.
How many million has Trump and his crooked family stolen since he has become president?

Didn‚Äôt the ‚Äúradical Left‚Äù ‚Äúkill God‚Äù?  If Trump believes God is dead, or that he never existed, why should Trump care?  Trump uses the Christian religion only to further his own agenda, as he does everything else in his life, including family, community &amp; money. Repugnant old man
Portland mayor needs to go! people who set fire to a police station and block the exits are trying to kill cops. They need to be arrested and tried.The mayor comes out and is more worried about Trump Campaign Ads then the lives of police officers

Was Trump fantasizing about KFC or Ivanka
You mean how Trump believes that one of his best friends, Kim Jong-Un, didn‚Äôt kill Otto Warmbier? Trump is friends with leaders who kill Americans. Great representative for America huh?
165,000 Dead from Coronavirus, 31 million Jobs lost. Worst economy since The Great Depression. Has lied over 20,000 times as President. Allowed Russia to order hits on our soilders. On November 3rd say goodbye to Trump.
Countries run by Trump are in shambles
Hey funny what a Republican and a Trump supporter can agree on right? If only our politicians drank more. For real cheers I'm on my Crown Royal now lol.
If you truly were you'd realize that Trump uses us a photo op. Biden is a true Catholic. Why would you say he's not? Do you personally know him? That's what I thought
If Biden has 100 a day then Trump has a million. You really want to keep on going? Come on dude check yourself before you wreck yourself...literally
You do realize Trump was literally hanging out in a bunker during the Washington DC protests right? Some leader
You say Biden has dementia but Trump has 2 gaffes in one day? Yeah I'd chill on that
The worst things Biden has said compares nothing to the things Trump has said that is for certain and at least Biden has the decency to apologize if he feels he has said wrong while Trump feels he can't do or say wrong which is exactly why we're in the dire situation we are in
Remember when Trump said Mexico would pay for the wall, he would create the greatest healthcare plan ever, save coal jobs, manufacturing jobs, Carrier, Harley Davidson and get rid of the National Debt?
I can‚Äôt argue that he has dealt with an incredible amount of grief. That story I shared is completely legit though, along with many other instances of his dishonesty. All I said was Joe Biden will not be a good President. I didn‚Äôt say he should or shouldn‚Äôt beat Trump.
You mean when Biden is running for his second term and Trump is in prison and bankrupt.
Rabid dogs wear muzzles, Donald Trump should wear a face mask that has a built in fact-checker for when he speaks as President on the job.
What Trump did to the USFL is what he is now doing to us and our country.
And I'd honestly vote for a literal rock over Trump lol
Dems didn't expect Trump to mess up this much and are now having Biden talk, along with suing the NRA, in order to lose harder.
Trump wouldn‚Äôt know a bible even if he had to walk behind teargas to hold one.
I respect your opinion I only see one evil this election in fact I see Biden as someone that shares more true conservative values than Trump does
I'm a Republican who wants the days of Reagan back. Trump is the opposite of that. Reagan said lets accept the responsibility of the future while Trump says he doesn't take responsibility for anything. Enough said.
The numbers don't lie. Trump has lied more than anybody else in history and YouTube videos can prove that.
Disinformation about Trump seems impossible since that man is known to lie all of the time...

Trump says arrest the press.
Trump wants a vaccine however he has said multiple times holistical approach is what he truly supports and hydroxychloroquine also discredited by Fauci and big Farma because these are cheep remedies that won‚Äôt make billions for Bill Gates
I‚Äôm a Michigander and I hate this Bitch with a passion she is manipulating this Plandemic so she can do her part to try and get Trump not re elected
Biden had a little bit of a gaffe today but thanks to Trump that got overshadowed big time. For Biden just has a speech impediment, Trump is just plain dumb and ignorant.
See I don‚Äôt think Joe Biden is a decent human being, but that‚Äôs just my opinion. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a good politician, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs of sound mind and I certainly do not believe he will be a good President. I‚Äôm taking Trump out of the equation and just evaluating Biden.
tRump is confusing Joe Biden's policy on China with HIS policy on Russia. Stupid as the day is long.
What a fucking moron...  Here‚Äôs what Trump got wrong about America‚Äôs COVID-19 death rate
Trump has had 2 gaffes in one day yet he says Biden is mentally ill? Lol
I dislike Trump‚Äôs posture, speaking abilities, hair piece, all of it. It‚Äôs a sickening sight.
#JoeBiden is a Catholic who attends Mass. The closes #Trump has EVER gotten to Scripture was when he held up a Bible for a photo-op... if we are to believe it was a Bible! #thursdayvibes #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
Biden wouldn't block Trump's prosecution if the Justice Department pursued it   Prosecuted for beating Hillary?
If he could get away from Trump I think it'd help him a ton. He has a promising future if he does. His latest ad is quite interesting though
I know Trump supporters tried to vote for Brenda...and it failed...I think this may be a sign that this state is finally ready to get rid of the Antichrist known as Trump my friend
Hard to doubt Hillary would have been worse than Trump considering the situation we are in now...
Sure but the Trump campaign also doctored information about her and sadly people believed it had they not well we probably wouldn't be in the situation we are in now at least it wouldn't be as dire
Or Donald Trump becoming President...
I don't trust any video from Trump supporters they'll doctor anything they did that to Hillary and that's why she lost in 2016
So I know some people personally that compared Hitler to Trump. Do they not realize that by saying shit like that they‚Äôre minimizing the Holocaust? I mean come on!!
That dude you quoted is a Trump supporter though so that might have been doctored to begin with
This year yes we have to. Besides Biden's worst compared nothing to Trump's worst
So sad that trump has Obama envy.
He's going the extra mile to get out of meeting with Trump today.
While I do intend to vote for Trump, I'm not what you would call a cultist. When he's right or wrong, I say so. Problem is the Left is almost always wrong, so Trump is the only choice we have.
And he will still beat Trump's sorry ass November 3rd...Tick Tock!
Well, he'd aim for Trump, but hit Pence.

Mr Trump your fear and misinformation about the vote is misleading and frankly just wrong.  The voting process where I live is secure.  voters are influenced by this campaign from the social media platforms, which you are speaking from.  And the lies you put out as truth.

Honestly if we don‚Äôt see Biden and trump speak to each other on a debate stage then we shouldn‚Äôt have an election.   1. You should have to be able to defend your platform in a non-scripted setting   2. If either of them catch Covid let‚Äôs be fucking honest nobody is gonna cry
I can‚Äôt predict the future but Joe Biden does not seem to be a viable candidate to run this country in my eyes. I‚Äôm not trying to compare him to Trump, I‚Äôm trying to gauge his potential to be a good President. I do not see it.

Biden will beat Trump. I don‚Äôt like Biden, I do not think he will be a good President (Easily could be the worst President of all time), but he will beat Trump. Only way Biden loses is if he absolutely shits the bed on the debate stage. It would have to be a historic meltdown.

I just watched the Axios interview again and I don't know how Johnathan Swan made it through that interview without laughing his ass off. I'm sorry I know this isnt PC but Trump is fucking mentally retarded. Flat out Mentally Retarded there's no other way of putting it.
His bitches at Fox Conspiracy channel like Hannity, Carlson, Geraldo and especially Hannitys bitch Dan Bongino should join Trump in his jail cell when this is all over. All these fucking idiots do night after night is lie on National TV aided by their Australian billionaire boss.
If I was in charge of a global broadcasting news network, I would never allow a live stream of Donald Trump.  The reason for it would be to delay the stream for fact checking.  He is spreading false claims and lies to Americans and the world nonstop which is very harmful.
I still can‚Äôt believe that Shri4Three actually happened and I feel bad as fuck for not supporting the primary opponent.  I hope somebody launches a really solid write-in campaign because he only lost by 2000 votes.  Same goes for Trump‚Äôs favorite state legislator, Karen Whitsett.

I hope you‚Äôre right but I don‚Äôt trust this court to do the right thing when it comes to trump and what the GOP must due to survive the fallout after him. This is why they don‚Äôt give a crap about him screwing up the usps and the census. The fuckery will get worse, I believe.
Two decades of pandemic war games failed to account for Donald Trump
The one thing I don‚Äôt really get about trump supporters is that they will try defend him when it comes to him being racist, misogynist, or transphobic and say that none of those things are true, but even if they weren‚Äôt true like what does he do that makes you support him anyway?

Oh and don‚Äôt forget Trump destroying the USPS, getting Russian support during the election, and being ok with Russia giving weapons to the Taliban that then killed our soldiers
I don‚Äôt love Biden either but at this point I don‚Äôt know how you can look at any Trump ‚Äúpolicy‚Äù or interview and still think he won‚Äôt destroy this country. 155k preventable deaths, hate crimes, sexism, racism, and the worst 2nd quarter ever is trumps legacy

Trump is signing an executive order to add a day to leap year!
Also, I don't really have anything against Joe Biden, it's just that he isn't the type that would give free Medicare. But I do have to admit, it is a more reasonable price than what Donald Trump charges. So just be glad that I want Trump out of office as well as you do.
But we can all agree that we both HATE Trump.

people like to pretend the Trump era is something really special but the 2000s were so stupid, the main difference is the general decline wasn't so advanced that you could still plausibly ignore it (which made it possible for "Hope &amp; Change" to resonate) but that's about it
I think you could make up a fake Bible verse that supports Trump and he would share it thinking it is real.
Yeah I don‚Äôt think Trump ruined everything. That‚Äôs a cop out. I think it started in 08 when Obama made office and the racist far rights were mad then Trump won and the racist nuts thought they won and the far lefts came out either way we all lose
You all really need to get behind Trump
they're in the middle of rehabilitating GWB and Biden is already saying that prosecuting Trump (who is, according to the Democratic Party right now, a fascist, corrupt, treasonous, totalitarian existential threat to democracy) would be "bad for democracy"  what do people expect?

She‚Äôs a Trumpster and believes he‚Äôs going I good job. So I just told her a vote for trump is a vote for racistism &amp; that includes you. I also told her that now being a devoted Catholic she should listen to the Pope because he‚Äôs against what trump is all about, just a lost sole.
Much like Trump, I have always seen the Kardashians for what they really are: No talent vapid grifters. Let's Crowdsource an island and send Kanye, the whole crew of Kardashians/Jenners and Trump crew there to live out their days. They all deserve each other.
Voting Green also prevents more Trump. Free Medicare for All!
Did Trump in fact claim that Biden insulted the Black community?  It seems like an accurate headline.
But.....you all laughed when Trump said he would beat OBAMA.  Yup  He running against BIDEN , you said.  You LIED
Trump wins. The Dems look like radical fools for wanting extreme things like defunding the police, allowing the Nafion of CHAZ, etc. Many are converting to Conservative because of the insanity.
Just don't say you a trump supporter
If we allow the media to hype this as they did with Hillary than we have failed again. Kornacki and  needs to stop doing this shit. Trump still has a chance and we need to fight on.
I think the ad that should be shown is when Billy Bush was on Bill Mahar. When Billy Bush was at the Apprentice Trump was lying and said the Apprentice was the number one show in America, he confronted Trump about it.  Trump told him, ‚Äúlie! Tell them anything, they believe you!
Edmund Burke said ‚ÄúManners [read morals] are of more importance than laws.‚Äù  Up to now, US Presidents have lived by a common moral code. tRump has blown that up and the laws that we thought would constrain him do not. #TrumpHasNoMorals #GOPHasNoMorals
What if Obama had attacked Trump for marrying an illegal immigrant?
A former GOP strategist: ‚ÄúIt was all a lie.‚Äù Yep. Unfortunately too many GOP still believe it. Longtime GOP strategist says he‚Äôll ‚Äòwork with Democrats‚Äô to defeat Trump | PBS NewsHour #ItWasAllALie #PBSNewshour
Donald J Trump
I bet even Trump would tell you to shut up right now.  Nah, his ego would take over and be like "nobody knew that. That's why I have a big, tremendous, beautiful brain." and both of you can fly off into the sunset, kissing, on a zeppelin powered by your farts.
If trump gets any more orange someone is going to whack his noggin and see if there is 8 lovely segments of chocolate orange inside üòÇ
It really suck to be  when he calls out black people for not being diverse. Just goes to prove that Joe Biden  and the Democratic Party are racist.
Just another rich kid born on home plate who thinks he‚Äôs hit a home run offering his woke opinion! If he had a brain above his belt he should be more concerned about what the Democrats will do to Trump clan if they be crowned in 2020!
If Trump was a real Christian he would know! Nobody can hurt GOD! They can only offend him, like he does!
To avoid facing the fact that my life is mediocre and unimpressive in every way, I tell tell myself every night that I'm smarter than the president and I feel less bad inside. Every "trump bad" meme brings me closer to some sense of self-worth. Covfefe lol
If a vote for 3rd = Vote for Trump Then logically, it's also a vote for Biden
DEMOCRATS passed their bill 3 months ago. The GOP just started considering what to do. You truly have embraced Trump and his ways. Projecting your failures on the DEMS
LISTEN UP PATRIOTIC REPUBLICANS!   THE CORRUPT DEM CONTROLLED ELECTION POLLS R FAKE! THE MAINSTREAM NEWS NETWORKS HAVE A COMMON GOAL &amp; THAT IS TO DISCOURAGE REPUBLICAN VOTERS INTO THINKING THEY R WASTING THEIR TIME GOING TO VOTE FOR TRUMP! BE SMART &amp; DON‚ÄôT BELIEVE THE BULLSHIT!
She don‚Äôt like trump. It won‚Äôt last long

JUST IN: President Trump just said TikTok could be gone from the U.S. in 45 days.
Trump get any ?
The Trump family
Leftist: *breathes* Dems: It'll be your fault if Trump wins again! Dems: We don't need your vote! Dems: Why didn't you vote for our guy, look at the damage you've done!!!
It's cute how conservatives have a continuous case of the vapors over young folks telling other young folks to learn if they can legally register to vote so they can go out and vote to get Trump out of office  these kids aren't as dumb as you'd like to think they are
I think it is time that Republicans and Democrats admit that Trump and Biden are not good Christians. We should pray for them both.
Yeah, that's why he's pushing a drug that has deadly side effects (that existed BEFORE COVID-19, ask someone with Lupus) that does not have scientifically-backed success for COVID-19. oh wait... nope. It's money
This is truly one of the dumbest things that you could ever post. Trump is a dumpster fire that has managed to tank the economy and kill over 160,000 Americans.
"Kolomoisky was tied to the events that led to Trump‚Äôs impeachment proceedings earlier this year after two of Rudy Giuliani's associates met with him to try and get a sit-down with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky."
Bet you didn‚Äôt have anything to say when Trump used Cambridge Analytica to influence the 2016 election. Talk about shills when your the biggest shill I‚Äôve ever seen. Consequences for thee, but not for me
LOL The Anti-Christ (Trump) said Biden is going to hurt The Bible, Hurt GOD?
Anything Trump says  We say opposite.
Biden will never debate Trump.  He scared.

Trump needs to start building ANTIFA &amp; BLM PRISONS WITH MINIMAL TO NO ACCOMMODATIONS!   A CELL, BREAD &amp; WATER, &amp; TOILET.   Really, it‚Äôs time to put them away until they respect authority &amp; the greatness of AMERICA. They are all RACIST DIRTBAGS FUNDED BY THE CORRUPT RACIST DEMS!
tRump thinks he's God
Biden will never debate Trump
I just know in my heart....  Somehow.  This Trump's fault.  Yup...he went back in time , and did it.
I‚Äôd be willing to bet most Americans have made a choice...Biden could walk on stage in a diaper with a pacifier in his mouth and people would still vote for him...if I‚Äôm being honest..I would. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è trump has got to go...

We are watching a working poor genocide happening right now. Trump only cares about money &amp; power.
not sure how anyone could have missed this after he cruised to the nomination with a campaign consisting of nothing but a handful of small speaking events where he challenged voters to a push-up contest and told them to fuck off and vote for Trump if they don't like it
And then you wonder why HDQ , the cheap alternative pushed by Trump is great in every country except the United States
Trump still has no respect for the virus! Still playing politics! He Gone Learn!
LOL, you think this is controversial? Trump says worse things almost everyday. LOL
Now do the same to the trump foundation and send Don the Con tax evader to prison!
Why would anyone spread information that originates from Donald Trump? Warning or not?
Trump campaign hasn't paid $2 million in police bills
Michigan pro-Trump Republicans say Biden‚Äôs police policies will push voters toward Trump
Feed right in to the RWNJ propaganda, again! A balanced article would at least consider that Trump's demand for a new debate (while refusing to comply with what was previously agreed) is because he is losing. Why debate a serial liar, anyway?
I just scrolled through Letitia page.  She absolutely hates Trump.  This just another TDS WITCH HUNT.  THese people shouldn't be allowed to do this.
I get what you mean and trump probably did agree with it but ultimately it wasn‚Äôt his decision.(Don‚Äôt get it confused I am not defending that pos)
Trump campaign says Michigan voters deserve presidential debate before early voting starts
Your point is crucial. The win by Trump was truly a statistical fluke. The US was undone by this system of electing a president.
Trump doesn't deserve to watch Great Players Play NBA Basketball..!
Pardon my language but, fuck this.   Don't care about your political affiliation, BUT the MAGA fam ain't taking over the car scene. NO!  You have bikers. This year took over boating; when it comes to cars, debates are over brands, mods &amp; 0-60 brag rights.

You never addressed why the Left, who supposedly had so much dirt on Trump, waited until AFTER he was elected to ‚Äúunleash‚Äù the resistance. Seems to me that if you really had something it should have come out before. Or perhaps it‚Äôs all manufactured? Help me here.

Only tRump can look at this data and say ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre winning.‚Äù He sees the death rate dropping all the time. #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
I‚Äôm right there with you. I will not be around anyone that voted for or currently supports Trump. He is the Anti-Christ. I have had a really hard time with those that didn‚Äôt vote at all &amp; just assumed HC would win. That bs brought us this nightmare that we are all living through.
Excuse me? Trump installed a guy to purposely pull everything back and yes there will be huge increases in ballots getting.
What are you smoking? Flynn took money from a foreign source without reporting it. Then admitted guilt twice in a court of law. He was overly friendly with Russians and we know how trump loves to help them out. Corruption ain‚Äôt a river in Egypt
I am not a virus denier nor am I a Trump apologist.  I shut my business before government said I had to.  I wear a mask.  You are not a medical professional.  Clearly.  Trump is right.
Damn you right ash. Wasn‚Äôt voting for ye anyways but they know he not winning shit it‚Äôs just taking votes away for trump to win smh
I was pretending to be a conspiracy theorist / Trump apologist. :D
REMEMBER WHEN CORRUPT DEM GOVERNOR RUN STATES SAID TRUMP OVERREACTED CLOSING TRAVEL TO CHINA? REMEMBER WHEN THE CORRUPT DEMS TOLD TRUMP WE CAN HANDLE OUR OWN STATES? DO DEM IDIOTS KNOW ITS ALL DOCUMENTED &amp; ALL US PATRIOTIC AMERICANS HAVE GOT TO SEE DEM BS ON TV FOR MONTHS NOW?ü§£
This is so sad, blaming Dr Fauci like he created the virus. Probably his base. Trump reminds me of JJ, the Guyana cult leader, his base is like JJ followers in Guyana. Trump is the kool-aid .
It‚Äôs just INSANE how CORRUPT DEMS try to call TRUMP A RACIST! They have ZERO ON HIM BEING RACIST! BUT, WE HAVE 50YRS OF RACISM ON PEDO JOE‚ÄôS CAREER!  Playing the RACE CARD ON TRUMP FOR THE ELECTION WOULD BE A HUGE MISTAKE! BLACK AMERICANS DO SOME HOMEWORK ON JOES RACIST HISTORY!
WHY DIDN‚ÄôT OUR FIRST EVER ‚ÄúBI-RACIAL‚Äù Pres.Obama address SO CALLED SYSTEMIC RACISM &amp; SO CALLED WHITE PRIVILEDGE?   HE HAD FUCKING 8YRS! WHY DIDN‚ÄôT HE REMOVE CIVIL WAR STATUES? OR BAN THE CONFEDERATE FLAG!?  KNOW WHY?  HE DIDN‚ÄôT GIVE A SHIT!  ü§£, BUT, NOW CORRUPT DEMS BLAME TRUMP!
An ant &gt; trump
Idc. He ain‚Äôt gotta be perfect just better than trump
Top level trolling.
Yeah I am at odds with most people on this virus, because I think it's real.  But I can't figure out what Trump said that was dangerously wrong here.   Immune might not be the exact right word, but close enough.
He is not really doing it.  It‚Äôs a bunch of republican operatives who seem to be taking advantage of his mental state all in hopes of helping Trump
You DO know that Trump criticized Nobama for a few ebola deaths right? Are you saying Korea is a better country, greater than America? They have what 300 deaths.
People have been saying it for weeks and this is just proof that a vote for Kanye is a vote for Trump.
trump supporters are actually blind. completely brainwashed and or just have no brain cells. im over it
This is insulting to black people everywhere. They (Trump, Kanye, their teams) think black people are gullible and uninformed enough to vote for Kanye strictly because he's Kanye in hopes of splitting the ticket and taking votes away from Biden that never would've gone for Trump.
They stopped Trump from tweeting
Twitter just stopped Trump from tweeting

JUST IN: For the first time Facebook has deleted a post from President Trump.
Before Trump we projected strength in the world. One way we did that was with intense diplomacy and intelligence capabilities. When something happened America was the first to know. Now our president gazes into the world with befuddlement as if every question has no answer.

Trump is such a racist.
.  now telling CNN  that he briefs Trump everyday on coronavirus. Why does Trump still misunderstand ‚Äútesting.‚Äù huh?
Trump, Biden, TV ad dollars and get out the vote: MLive political reporter talks Michigan as a battleground state
Trump's clock would be kinda fucked up but in an unnatural way that you could tell he practiced it beforehand and then Biden's would have all the numbers crowded into one corner and he'd just insist it was fine and say something like "the presidency isn't just about penmanship"
Strange take on a guy who hates Trump so much that he destroyed his credibility over it. You're a real "quipster".
I meant for US Senate unless LP person is good. My priorities are   1) Remove Trump (It's so upsetting to me the alternatives to him that we have)  2) Balance (I am hopeful that whoever wins the presidency does not have a majority for their party in the House or the Senate)
You said Trump infected everyone not true.  There are virtually no "extra" deaths, the numbers are misleading.
Trump infected no one, the number of dead is the total number of people, and is about the same number as died the year before.  Close to half the deaths right now are suicides.
Omg. I used to say that all the time. Not about Trump, just about people in general. But, yea, I agree.
Superimpose ferg over one of them people screaming no when trump was elected.  Lmao
Anyway, I'm sure repeating "I don't need to take a test!" will be a winning strategy on this issue through the election, same basic thing worked for Trump's tax returns and that's the standard now I guess
THAN WHY IS TRUMP AND THE GOP KILLING US?
My coworker told me her grandson wants to vote for trump. So I asked if she tried to convince him not to. She said no she doesn‚Äôt have to. He doesn‚Äôt even know where he can even vote let alone that he has to register and she ain‚Äôt telling him üòÇü§£üò≠

How dare you. Have you no shame? You, and fellow GOP, need to pull your heads out of Trump‚Äôs ass and serve the American people. YOU WORK FOR US!
Drinking game until the debate. Drink everytime trump lies.. Well damn we will all die of alcohol poisining  before we see a debate.
Name a time in past 4yrs! I didn't like him at all.  He had to win me over. Took him 3yr of me keeping him under a microscope to believe him. He is a Constitutionalist so if it goes against Trump, don't care, does it go against the Constitution? I need to know.
Joe made more sense in that brief clip than trump has in 4 years. Are you aware Joe had to overcome a stutter? He sometimes trips over a word or 2 but he is mentally there, unlike fat cheeto who cant even pronounce Yosemite.

You quote the Bible, your you still support tRump. Your a hypocrite.
I don‚Äôt understand how you can lie so much and get away with it tbh.... trump wears a mask and asked people to wear them, hospitals are empty, there are more tests here than ANYWHERE else, and you spelt conservative wrong.... way to fit ‚Äúcult‚Äù in there. You‚Äôre embarrassing

TRUMP 2020!! We do not need the Left Wing Nuts running our nation over the cliff to Socialism. Anyone who wants to live in a Socialist country is not a true American. Biden wants to raise our taxes! Why would you vote to give away more of your hard-earned money? #Trump2020
Trump's base loved that he was a liar and a cheat ‚Äî but now it's coming back to bite them
Forgetting the Trump administration would certainly clear up a lot of space
And Trump immediately jumps to conclusion that it was an attack.  Such a Rufus.
Okay, I‚Äôve noticed one thing about Biden and trump supporters.        Trump supporters your loud as hell and speak a lot of facts.                                 Biden supporters you guys are usually dumb as hell. And your only voting for him because he‚Äôs running against trump.
OBAMA weaponized the IRS.  If they had anything.  Trump never would have got elected.  Also.  Mueller would have found something  But....here you go again.
TRUMP IS NOW SO POWERFUL  HE CAN CONTROL PLAGUES !!
can't wait for it to be revealed Trump created Space Force specifically to raid the former Nazi moon base converted into a pedophile haven (so-called "Epstein's island", Epstein meaning "river hill", aka the site of the water production plant built up on the walls of the crater)
So, are the Dems "in disarray" or are they all unified behind Obama's agenda of ensuring people have access to health care, good-paying jobs, etc.? Either sounds better than falling in line with the race-baiting, life-threatening, economy-crushing agenda of Trump.
Fox News largely ignores Trump's disastrous Axios interview
When the Reagan Foundation thinks you're such an asshole you're tarnishing *that* asshole's reputation.
BIDEN 2014 RIOTS. Burning buildings, torching cars, destroying property, putting people at risk that‚Äôs destructive &amp; there‚Äôs no excuse for it. PEOPLE should be prosecuted for engaging in criminal acts. IS THAT RACIST FOR JOE TO SAY? THEY SAID TRUMP IS RACIST FOR THE SAME REMARKS!
Just think in 91 days we get to decide if we want Trump to keep right on killing our citizens or we want someone who will make a decision &amp; put this country on tract and direction to rid the COVID19 virus. You have the biggest decision of your lives, kill more or save lives.
This happens because they are people like you. You‚Äôre always so silent when trump does something stupid. Y‚Äôall are both hypocrites
Nah dude! It's just more efficient to sit back and let your dad talk.   P.S.-It's mean that you trump children are not addressing your fathers dementia. If you love him, you'll get him the care he needs.
Yet....they still walking around.  Nothing Will happen.  Because........  WE AIN'T IN OFFICE.  GET OUT YOUR RABBIT HOLES. GO GET IN OFFICE. RESEARCH HOW TO DO IT*  GO GET IN OFFICE.  TRUMP CANNOT DO THIS ALONE.  GO GET IN OFFICE  .

When you try so hard to paint those you hate in a bad light, and end up making them look rad instead. Ben Garrison is the ham-fisted Trump of political cartoonists; doing all his opposition‚Äôs work for them.
For the good of the country he had too becuz trump would not invoke the dpa
Obama didn't just expand the definition. He aggressively pursued prosection, making sure people were caught in the legal system so that they could be charged with felonies if they tried to return. Extremely punitive and the perfect precursor for Trump's own inhumane policies

President Trump endorses voting by mail.
That's a reach. All the way back to the 80's. You guys are a joke. Trump lies all the time. He word vomits and contradicts himself in the same gdamn paragraph and never makes any sense. Biden could shoot somebody in the middle of 5th Av and I would still vote for him. #150000dead
Oh please trump told him to lie because there weren‚Äôt enough masks
You know, you might want to try out the Trump train. Your lying is the perfect fit. The charming personality, too.
Bill Maher did  a skit called "What if Obama said it" White Privilege: when Trump can brag about the size of his dick on national TV and still get elected.   Now I gotta take that thought a step further...what if Obama sent Sasha or Melia  to represent USA in foreign affairs?
mike, get with the program.  many states have had mail in ballots for years, and surprise ; no problems.  the only voting fraud is repubs trying to purge people off voting rolls, gerrymandering and  closing voting polls.  so mike you are like trump a liar. use facts..
Want some cheese with that whine,
I think Trump and Biden are both just wheels in a fucked up machine, i just think Biden is a better wheel.  If you agree hit like, If you disagree but respect my opinion comment 'respect'  Lets show the world we can agree to disagree.

Trump has forgotten this country was stolen from Native Americans.
I would say yes , definitely that I have seen since Trump been in office. He‚Äôs incompetent, incoherent, doesn‚Äôt speak in complete sentences. A five year old is way more competent than Trump. A disgrace.
Would Trump have been a distraction?  If he had attended, would we be hearing that he didn't have any right to be there?
I really don‚Äôt think CORRUPT DEMS EVER WANNA PLAY THE RACE CARD NARRATIVES AGAINST TRUMP AGAIN! Their BOY PEDO JOE HAS A WHITE HOODED SHEET IN HIS CLOSET! He gave the EULOGY FOR A KKK LEADER! Wake up BLACK AMERICANS! Trump only said NO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS! That‚Äôs not racism!

It's another great thing he's done even though it was already done under the Obama administration....  Are you really that naive and gullible?  So far the trump supporters applauding this move has lowered the national IQ.
üòÇüòÇüòÇSo sneaky...so when he is indicted the press can say, ‚ÄòTrump told Barr to prosecute.‚Äô
I think you mean "done". FYI, all trump has done is make a mess and make this country look and act bad.
Biden and Trump side by side isn‚Äôt close. Is biden as sharp as he once was? No way. But side by side? Not close. I don‚Äôt understand tweets like this.
Check your facts.  It's part of the affordable care act under Obama. It's nothing more than grandstanding by trump.  Ordering something that's already covered??  Impressive action by the moron......

Don't vote for trump~
I would be really really surprised if they had another "March" in Portland tonight. Maybe 20 people will show up after last night and Trump's threat to send the guard in.

Trump is 100% trying to steal/discredit the election.  For the people who say Trump can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt stay in office, he‚Äôs doing illegal shit in front of your eyes &amp; getting away w/it. Doing everything he can to win &amp; staying even if he loses is the natural next step of all of this BS

You're way dimmer than I ever thought. Stupid question. In absolutely no way is Donald Trump qualified or worthy of being president. Shouldn't be an issue whatsoever.
Got it. The ACA, in my opinion, was a first step to universal health care. I‚Äôm hoping Trump‚Äôs term doesn‚Äôt set us back too far. Canada did it. It took years. It‚Äôs complicated but a decent US govt could accomplish it I think.

I‚Äôll grant the first (although not so much for small businesses...and his terrifs etc have actually hurt) and fight to the death on the second. Abortion is up 4% under Trump, and that‚Äôs just the starting point, because life is more than birth.

Trump Says What Many Americans Have Been Thinking: Epstein Might Not Have Killed Himself
Any chance that Meadows was sent in to the negotiations to tank them so that Trump could ride in on his white horse and try to fix things with executive orders.    In other words they played with the lives &amp; welfare of Americans for a political campaign moment.
Wanting is very different than interfering.    I‚Äôm sure most countries want trump gone but they don‚Äôt interfere.
Fuck Donald Trump
Hand it to Trump.  He will put his name on anything.
Between how Trump is trying to use Facebook and today‚Äôs illegal ‚Äúexecutive orders‚Äù/lying about Obamacare, this should be terrifying.  Trump is going to do everything he can to both steal the election and discredit it if he loses, and Joel Kaplan is going to help him.
We‚Äôre new to our neighborhood still, so unsure the political makeup so far. Very few yard signs so far. But one house down the road that looks out to M-6 has a huge tRump sign on the back of their garage visible from the highway and the Kent Trails.
Well they are there to see Trump though so it's really not a good thing.
How often have you heard Trump use the words "We" or "Us"?
So with trump announcing these executive orders, (payroll tax suspended, student loans suspended, insurance companies can‚Äôt deny pre-existing conditions, cheap medications) does anyone on the left dare oppose this publicly? Watch the lefties squirm!

Believe it or not , President Trump has been threatened pretty much every day since he took office . there are a lot of whack-jobs out there that just can't get a grip on reality ! he has dealt with it and needs a little break from the constant barrage of hate filled threats !
I get it. Trump pardoned this guy so he falls obligated to eat Trump‚Äôs ass.

Just wait til the news about trump being investigated or being indicted is released publicly. Trump wont have time to attack or spread lies about Biden, he will be busy with damage control.
Tough call. He's a sad little man who's carrying water for Trump in the most absurd way possible. I pity him in that regard. Yet, he seems to have a masochistic streak that causes him to consistently say things for which getting mocked is the only plausible outcome or motivation.
Trump would just turn around and challenge Biden to say an entire coherent sentence without stumbling and stuttering
Fun to talk evangelical masculinity, Trump, and John Wayne with  today. ü§†

Have you ever seen the series Life in the Fash Lane on YouTube? It breaks down all the ways that America is ripe for fascism, and how Trump is different than Hitler, and how American fascism looks vs fascism from other countries. I found it excellent.
So, Joe Biden's America will look like Trump's America?
How can women say they stand with and will vote for Trump?
9)We "elect Presidents, not pastors", but Joe Biden hates God so we shouldn't elect him.  10)Mexico didn't pay for a wall. The debt has grown exponentially. The trade deficit grew. Iran still has no nuclear deal. Obamacare hasn't changed. But Trump "kept all his promises!"
4)Trump hires only the best people but the Post Office is in shambles and it's totally not his job to fix it.  5)Masks are tyranny when 160,000 are dead in a pandemic, but torture is totally good cause 3,000+ died in 9/11. 6)Three marriages + tear gas = loving God.
Everyone involved needs to PRAY then PAY for what they have done to America and Donald Trump. That includes you Joey Biden!
Trump Had A Great Week!
Donald Trump exuded trashiness when he cheated on his wife with a porn star and then paid her off. He also exuded trashiness when he bragged about being able to grab women by their pussies. You exuded trashiness in your hypocritical disgusting response. And your dog is ugly.

I am neither a racist, a misogynist nor an evangelical. I also have a college degree and work in medical research. President Trump loves this country and its people. He also can't be bought. I'll take him over ANYONE from the corrupt, soulless Democratic party any day.
If Trump said do not take hydroxychloroquine then they would be on CNN saying how great the drug is the next day.
Sounds like Trump admin did. If the votes are there in the senate to override a veto, pass a 2T relief bill. Hopefully one that doesn't include insane pork on either side.
Does Trump pronounce France phonetically as Frons? No. He doesn't because 90% of America doesn't. Unless he's not American. I demand to see his birth certificate!
Yeah. The horror. Just imagine: six Americans died. How horrible! Good thing something infinitely worse never occurred on Trump's watch.

My summary of Trump and TikTok:  1. Microsoft Billionare Charles Simonyi donates to Trump‚Äôs 2020 re-election campaign.  2. Trump drives down the value of TikTok so Microsoft can lowball ByteDance.  3. We watch it happen right before our eyes.  4. We post stupid videos on TikTok.

In 2016, I was eating breakfast with two of my friends after Mass and a caravan of black SUVs pulled up and Donald Trump walked in. Weirdest morning ever.
So ending private prisons, decriminalizing marijuana and expunging records, free public 2 year college, $15/hr min wage, $1T in infrastructure investments, a health care plan that covers 98% of Americans with no out of pocket costs it‚Äôs not different enough from Trump?? Wtf??

He‚Äôs a helluva a lot more pro labor than Trump is... what did Trump tank our economy by 40 million jobs and actually sink our GDP??   TPP and NAFTA werent perfect but protectionism only serves to drive the cost of consumer goods up. Its a trade off and its complicated
OMG.  Wow.  That is powerful.  Remember: this is going on your permanent record.  Too many see this as fun cuz Trump made it "cool" to be a racist.  When he loses and Vance sends him to prison, watch how many Trumpies say, "No, I never liked the guy!"  The internet is forever!
His plan would still cover more Americans than Trumps. Also Trump is presiding over the worst exonomic decline in our nations history since the great depression (+40mill) so im pretty sure Biden beats Trump on ‚Äútrade‚Äù as well.

Michigan didn't vote for this trump sheep in 2018 and it won't again. John James is a fraud and people see that.
She‚Äôs right.    Journalists, Trump‚Äôs tweets aren‚Äôt ‚Äònews‚Äô.     Stop pretending they are.
The tRump Administration is a HOAX

Meanwhile At an official Basement event, Biden is delivering a campaign speech, repeatedly attacking Trump. Many of these line are right out of Bernie, AOC, Tlaib and Omar‚Äôs rallies
Most of the Republican party is responsible for enabling tRump. They are just as responsible for this sh** show as him.
President Trump Makes Cryptic Remark at Ohio Speech: "I Have a Lot of Enemies...This May Be the Last Time You'll See Me for a While"  via
More lies, but here some facts, tRump has ruined almost every relationship with allies we have had for centuries. And he praises our enemies.  He goes out of his way to please Russia and Putin.
I‚Äôm glad he and his team tested negative but really, that was a pretty elaborate way to miss an appearance with Trump.
No more Trump
When and where did President Trump say this? I have missed so much!
For me getting Trump out and bullying Biden further left seems a lot less harmful than burning it all down. But hey to each their own
Youre the one LARPing here. I actually have a realistic goal of getting Trump out and you apparently seem to think vote shaming, wokescolding, lefty infighting is going to revitalize the system?? Burn it all down or whatever?? Do you know nothing about coalition building?
Donald Trump only banned TikTok because Baron was filming Renegade in the Oval Office.
What exactly is your end goal here? Are you one of those Bernie or Bust accelerationists who thinks if we burn it all down we will make progress faster? What is it really? Politics takes time. Coalition building takes time. Biden can be pulled left but a fascist like Trump cant
trump, you‚Äôre losing voters faster than imaginable, and that the fault of   .... you‚Äôre being sabotaged!
I was a Bernie guy too but even I can see the importance of getting Trump out in November  This stupid wokescoldy nonsense of trying to out left each other is childish. Vote the fascist out and bully Biden to the left while he‚Äôs in office. Pretty fuggin simple
Bullshit dude. Trump has only been a politican for 3 years. It‚Äôs not really a fair comparison. But even so look at all the harm he has caused. Not even a Hillary admin. would‚Äôve fucked up the pandemic response this bad smh

This Bunch of Never Trump Looser Globalist Fakes  Do Not Click Adds You Know Who these Morons Are Ignore Them Dont Add Anything to Their Traffic
I read your response. All those things you said Trump did,are rumors. Not ONE IS PROVEN. If you listen to the lying media, it has one goal in mind, get their investment back from corrupt Hillary‚Äôs 2016 election offer, it proves every goal made was created to destroy PT
2of2 Stop listening to the local media liars, theyre purpose is, get Trump impeached,so they can get their investment back and return on Hillary‚Äôs 2016 election offer. She created a corupt investment to win the election but lost and so did Dems, Soro‚Äôs, and media, it makes sense
Who‚Äôs potus Noem or Grenell? I love this ticket! Both seem cool as hell, good looking, classy! Grenell is a genius and a damn twitter wrecking ball. Nobody on the left has a prayer. He‚Äôs as big a troll as Trump. ü§£

Where the hell does somebody get the idea Nancy becomes the president ? Donald Trump will Remain the President till a different President is voted in and then Inaugurated. And he will most likely win this Election in 2020. Wishful thinking will not change the Government

Good. I find your non-actions in re to trump offensive. Deal with it. #ItIsWhatItIs
Why is trump banning Tik Tok before he bans the KKK? Just wondering ...
- I've been in the same room as Ted Cruz and Donald Trump. Cruz was at the 2016 Wyoming GOP Convention and Trump was at WrestleMania 7.
The desire to defend every spittle-drenched synaptic misfire from Trump is bizarre
But when Joe Biden said Trump hasn‚Äôt ever read the Bible how is this different? No factual base, one mans opinion.
Accurate, since Trump thinks he‚Äôs god...
Most of them is majority. Among my friends 100% have doubled down üòë and I've never seen anyone say I voted third party this time I won't or I didn't vote last time I will this time. I just see a lot of if you vote for Biden your voting for the status quo that gave us Trump
Compare the candidates? There is no comparison. Biden is a man of integrity and intellect. Trump is an ignorant cesspool of hatred. We don‚Äôt need debates to highlight this even further.  But if you really want it...
This is why white guys hate talking about race, the conversation is a god damn mine field, say the wrong thing &amp; its the guillotine for you. There is nothing Biden can say thats on a par with Trump for bigotry.  We can litigate Biden or we can defeat trumpism.
Trump cheated on his mistress with a porn star as his 3rd wife cared for his infant child and then paid them off to save his Russian led campaign. Jesus would hate donald trump.
IN 2020 FROM HOW TRUMP AND HIS ADMINISTRATION HAS HANDLED THE CRISIS THAN WE DID WITH 911. THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A SECOND. TRUMP NEEDS TO GO IN NOVEMBER THIS REPUBLICAN THAT VOTED FOR TRUMP IN 2016. DEFINITELY AGREES THAT TRUMP IS A BUSINESS MAN NOT A POLITICAL MAN. HE NEEDS TO GO
TRUMP ONLY CARES ABOUT MONEY YOU WANT PROOF HOW ABOUT WHEN HE DECIDED TO DEPLOY MILITARY TROOPS AGAINST THERE OWN. PEOPLE ON U.S. SOIL FOR STARTERS. THIS IS ALL A POLITICAL SCANDAL FOR TRUMP TO BE RELECTED. TRUMP SAYS THE CASES ARE GOING DOWN BULLSHIT WE HAVE SEEN MORE DEATHS
BUT MITCH DIDN'T DO THAT AND NEITHER DID STEVEN MNUICH INSTEAD THEY ARE TO BUSY üíã TRUMP ASS WELL THIS REPUBLICAN ISN'T GOING TO KISS ANYONE ASS AND I'M NOT GOING TO SUGAR COAT SHIT OUR LEADERS SUX DICK. THEY ALL NEED TO GO IN NOVEMBER. THEY HAVE MADE PEOPLE LOOSE THERE HOMES

I'd pay good money to hear Trump pronounce, "I quit".
Well why should  care if people are dying, starving, can't pay their bill? He is going to his club to golf for 3 days on our dime! This is why Trump &amp; the  need to all go in Nov they don't give a üí©about the American People! Sending kids to school to die.

I seriously think trump will dump pence for ivanka..
Can anybody on this plant please explain to me wth God, the Bible, guns, trumps wig, his orange skin, trump gold resorts are doing in a Whirlpool washer machine convention?
I became a citizen during the first term. Trump has my vote for his second term!
President Biden should play this dementia clip of Donald trump at every event until the very day Biden is sworn in.
No way in hell!  Anyone who still supports trump has some serious issues with morals and values.  Why waste any time getting to know someone that you are such polar opposites with.   Rape? Caging children and taking them from their parents, racist, etc.   NOPE hard pass!
What are you doing to fight Trump‚Äôs rising autocracy? How are you working to save the post office, which is enshined in thr Constitution? How are you protecting the vote of every Michigander?
This is NOT ok &amp; needs to be immediately investigated! Impeach trump again!
Trump issues executive order banning 'transactions' with TikTok, WeChat owners
Does Trump realize how many conservative Irish Catholics live in Midwest swing states? It‚Äôs well known Biden‚Äôs Catholic.
You mean Russia will interfere with the election and tRump will go belly up for Putin?
So Trump is like Moses.  What rock did he strike to cause water to come out of sinks and showers.
Mom of 2, who voted for Trump in 2016 but won‚Äôt vote for him again in 2020, in part because of his response to BLM tells me: ‚ÄúSuburban moms aren't 1950s housewives. We're educated, strong women...who want our children to understand the privilege they have that others don't."
Trump continues to hype up Biden more than anyone else could
When is Trump finally going to be on American Greed: Biggest Cons?
Supporting Trump now is disgusting.
GOP, You own this horrible disaster called Donald trump! WTH is wrong in his brain to play a song like this, in today‚Äôs world at a campaign event with ‚ÄúLive &amp; Let Die‚Äù?? So I guess you all have agreed with his statement of ‚ÄúIt is what it is‚Äù?? This is a sick, disturbing person!üò°
Plus Trump and he have a Brokeback Mounting of their own. Pics don‚Äôt lie!
I love when MAGA dorks have to justify Trump‚Äôs inability to talk. ‚ÄúPeople say Thighland all the time. In fact that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve ever called it!‚Äù If Trump presented at the Oscars, Dinesh D‚ÄôSouza would swear that her name actually is Adele Dazeem.
So vote trump*. Because he is so much better.
Trump‚Äôs America: a student in Georgia has been suspended for sharing a video of crowded hallways with nary a mask in sight.  Students were warned about sharing any pictures of the mess by the principal on the loudspeaker. Freedom?
How is anyone voting for this guy??? Answer:  because they just can‚Äôt bring themselves to vote for Trump.  Stay home then snowflakes.  We are KAG! üá∫üá∏
So when trump misspeaks it‚Äôs lack of intelligence when Biden does ‚Äúpeople make mistakes‚Äù got it.
This dude posted something about how he thinks Robin Williams would have voted for Trump and I'm legit so pissed
I‚Äôd wait 8 hours to vote FOR Trump
Again Biden is not perfect but he‚Äôs not a fucking fascist like Trump. Lets get the fascist out of the white house first and then we can bully Biden to the left all we want mkay??

Its pretty simple dude:  People like Krystal Ball and Kyle Kulinski argue that Biden and Trump are the same on economic policy. Though this is true to a certain extent this is a class reductionist framing as it ignores all the racist social policies Trump will implement cometerm2
Trump needs his own platform. Simple and secure. Then we would link it to Social Diseased Media. No more censoring.
Do you think Kyle Kulinski doesn‚Äôt engage in class reductionist language? He spent months trying to convince his extremely white audience that Biden and Trump were the same. Are you joking? You made the claim class reductionism isn‚Äôt real and so far youve done nothing to defendit
And I hear class reductionist say identity politics/race is a distraction all the time. Look at channels like KyleKulinski who monetize their white privilege by saying straight up asinine things like Biden = Trump. I agree Biden‚Äôs not perfect but to be so racist as to say they =?
They're both private companies numb nuts. Trump agreed to their terms. Perhaps Nestor could explain this to you.
Of course, that's what this is about.  Get rid of TRUMP then our America becomes Venezuela.
Yes, but have you seen the anyone but trump signs üòç
I try to stay out of politics on social media but how tf are there 330 million people in this country and the best options we could come up with for president are Trump and Biden. There HAS to be someone out there with a brain.
It's a red state, they dont believe in science. Only Trump.
Compared to how Trump takes black voters, its night and day.
Bill Barr is not stupid.   Neither is Mike Pompeo, or Mitch McConnell.   If you think they‚Äôll risk their future to save  Trump, you are mistaken.
To be a strong manufacturing nation we must get rid of tRump and all the  that are up for reelection.
I‚Äôm telling you, they aren‚Äôt going to run Trump.   Assuming by some bizarre chance he even makes it to November
Mother!!!!
Theyre trying to say Biden relates to the public because of grieving and that he could lead public to recovery.Time to show the public that Trump not only sympathized but took action. Trump lead the way healing America. Cold shoulder Biden &amp; his "C'mon man" doesnt scream sympathy
Trump is hard to take
Pathetic Cowards For Trump, aka Republicans
I hear ya. But look at what Trump gets away with.
I‚Äôm all for everyone having the right to vote and have their own opinion but at this point I really wanna go around to every house that has a ‚ÄúTrump 2020‚Äù sign in their yard and steal it so nobody in GR can have one. It‚Äôs not a right to vote if your vote is gonna cause harm
That was part of the con, the setup to establish his "anti-trump" credentials.
Everything Trump Touches Dies #ETTD
Holy hell. Please DO IT. Don‚Äôt give him the authority!
Joe Biden will hurt God?   Donald Trump already did that when he hijacked God's followers as his own.
They the democrat's have tried everything in the book to lie about Trump because they can not control him . Democrat's need to go to jail for Treason now.
Trump's an Idiot
Facebook and Twitter are against Trump totally have been since day one.
Trump is yet again trying to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program ‚Äî a program that protects over 700,000 people from deportation and allows them to work and attend school in the United States, their home.
Trump not even remotely rational. If Biden is president he‚Äôll hurt the Bible and hurt God?! Gee, maybe you should pick up a Bible and read it and get a clue who God is. Gonna go out on a limb and say that no worldly leader can hurt God. Also, Biden is openly a believer ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Hey Kev, ‚ÄúOur way of life‚Äù doesn‚Äôt matter because the you and the Trump sychophantic, lapdog enablers are allowing the mass deaths of Americans. At this rate, there won‚Äôt be enough of us left to have any ‚Äúway of life‚Äù. Great Job GOP!
45 has bankrupted 6 times. He is either bad with money or ripping people off. Which is it?   45 paid to sleep with a porn star and cheated on Melonia, the paid to cover it up.   Trump foundation shut down and not aloud to run a charity again because of self dealing.
Maybe I'm confused, but is this the same God with the floods and the smiting and the tower of babble and what not? I mean, Joe's a pretty resilient guy but I just don't see him getting clean contact on God. Or is Trump's God a different one than I'm thinking of?
No you, the  and tRump don't define the truth. You all think you can spread whatever false information that makes you look good. You all are traitors.
trump‚Äôs Law and Order is handcuffing 9 year olds face down on the pavement. No thanks.
When Trump got elected, he started firing all his staff. Looking back, I don‚Äôt think this was because he didn‚Äôt like them or anything like that...  I think it‚Äôs because he thought this was the newest season of The Apprentice.
I guess I think now is a great time to for Dems to persuade those voters, while they share a common enemy. Rather than telling them not to donate to the people who may have drawn them away from Trump.
Donald Trump takes us all for fools. Disingenuousness will not take you too far, Jason.
Hope he did not listen to Trump, about not wearing a mask!!! Trump was to meet with him today!!!
So you‚Äôre saying if his VP pick doesn‚Äôt meet your requirements, Trump gets your vote?  Good grief. Your red side is leaking.
Why is ANYONE talking about this? Have we learned nothing about handing free attention to narcissistic reality TV personalities from 2016? Pandemic, democracy burning, planet burning, rising fascism. But we're going to get distracted by Kanye? If so, we deserve Trump.
Trump, remind us how well u handle the CORONAVIRUS in USA &amp; Ohio, remember to tell ur base there, today another of ur big lies, OK???
What's the difference? All but one sitting Republican blocked witnesses at Trump's impeachment trial.
Donald Trump is the King of cancel culture!
See what I mean about Ohio? Why does Trump say he has an October surprise? Will Putin, give him a vaccine before the election, for CORONAVIRUS, just wondering hmmm. Remember what Putin, did to Hillary &amp; her, e-mails before last election!!!
Mask Gaetz, supporter of Trump who has lied 20,000 times, has opinions on Truth üôÑ
What if, for instance, a voters #1 priority was removing Trump from office and that voter found  messaging more effective and persuasive than that of smaller Dem races? Would there be a reason for that voter to max out on other races first?
Lies, democrats had the heroes act ready in May. The  and tRump try to lie to Americans about who really is responsible from helping the American people. You want to help the rich.
Didn‚Äôt u Dems mention that Pres. Trump has been receiving a lot of calls from Russian leader, Putin, LATELY??? Maybe instructing him what to do???
This movie mentioned Ohio, where Trump is headed for a rally. This movie reminds me what Trump &amp; Russia r trying 2 do, TAKE OVER AMERICA, so much for USA, USA! I suggest u all watch it!!!
Do you have trumps tax returns, you lie and get payed to . You lie more than trump ever has !
Trump really needs to watch some YouTube makeup tutorials, my god. Blend, man. Blend.
Not a trump supporter whatsoever, but lowkey I think he might be the one to reveal everything cause he really don‚Äôt give a fuck and has nothing to lose at this point lmao
1: this is a sound bite, did any of you watch the full video ?    2: Trump says, and has said 20 times worse, so as far as I'm concerned it's Biden or no one.    3: if you don't vote, you voted for Trump... Thankyou and have a good day.
Anyone believing this nonsense or that Trump has the interests of any minority population in his purview needs to read this:
"I like taking guns away early," Trump said. "Take the guns first, go through due process second." So....who EXACTLY has talked about taking away gun...without due process FIRST ?
You tRump's are so out of touch with the majority of America. The majority of parents don't want schools open.
Trump taught whoever writes this bullshit for the White House how to lie. Probably that White Nationalist Miller.
Maybe she has low grade depression because Trump is coming to get her POS crooked former president husband to expose all his treasonous acts while in office.
The HHS(Departartment of Health and Human services)is obviously lowering the cases because of trump, The day the change happened, cases immediately slowed and went down, this is a no brainer
He would say something like that. Trump pleases the devil every day.
Deflecting &amp; Projecting ... 2 things tRump is actually good at!
You ain‚Äôt voting for trump lol, so you just voting for someone who isn‚Äôt gonna win lol ü§°
Trump 2020
Apparently you aren't following the right God. You would know Trump is not good for this world. He does too many things to benefit himself. Maybe you need to go back and reread the whole Bible.
You just want to dignify your reasoning for voting for him like other do without trump lol
Hopefully the turnout will be better. The way I see it though, is he's going to basically get the same number of Democrats voting at least that voted for Hillary, and then he's got the never Trump Republicans also.
Close my eyes and circle his name. I swear outside of hate for Trump there‚Äôs no way anyone can honestly but comfortable with Biden lol.
I can't believe his V.P even matters. tRump and Pence have failed this country. Anyone he picks is better than them 2.
Facebook removes troll farm posing as African-American support for Donald Trump: Facebook also removed hundreds of fake accounts linked to conservative media outlet The  |
Trump is connected to them as well as Putin.
I agree with you Ryan. Both candidates are too old. It blows my mind that younger, better candidates have not emerged considering it's now clear that 74 year old Trump has no chance of making America great again and Biden is 77 years old.
Trump: All African Americans will support me because Biden said they are monolithic.
Is Donald Trump Preparing For An Insanity Defense? ‚Äì Dennis R. Hill. This is an excellent point. Since this was published, the amount of utterly insane proclamations, statements and actions ‚Å¶  has added could be used by Individual 1!
I smell a  lawsuit coming against Facebook! If Facebook allows one American Bridges ad , Trump-should sue immediately
Trump just called Thailand "Thighland". Wow.
He could choose a fresh pile of dog crap and it would be a better choice than sicko trump!
Do  supporters not realize they are becoming as bad as Trump supporters in their willingness to accept/overlook/excuse anything?? What is the line? Where are you no longer okay? He‚Äôs racist status quo that does nothing for you.
the wackadoos are never ever gonna change - the regular gun owners get to see how they've been screwed over? Trump is always gonna use the socialists/take your guns/open BOARDERS/hate the flag/hate the military crap whatever happens
The  choice is Clear but it is surprising how many people will cut their own nose off to spite their  face . The brainwashed liberal controlled Media continues to spout drivel about Trump and Ignore the Facts about Biden/Obama , Clinton , the Washington Swamp Cabal Pedos +more !China should not cave in to Trump the dictator.
China is solidly behind its business partner,Donald Trump.
His support is much stronger than his polls, that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre gonna get spanked. Democrats have rigged themselves into thinking they‚Äôve been winning this whole time. 62% of the country say they‚Äôre scared to say who they support (Trump) &amp; that doesn‚Äôt include the brave onesüß®üí•
Trump knows nothing about Corona virus.
The tide appears to be turning... Trump knows Americans won‚Äôt take the long way home to avoid the bully for too long before we‚Äôll team up &amp; fight back. He‚Äôs been sizing up the situation, waiting for us to signal him we‚Äôre ready to stand up. You hear it? He does. Cheers. Finally.
Dump trump

Trump is in business with  he has no ethical or moral scruples about TikTok.He just wants his cut.
That's just how Trump and his idiot minions sound to people who are sane. And not sycophants. Or Republicans. Get over it, as the late, not-so-great Mick Mulvaney said.
You hang a pi√±ata with Trump‚Äôs face on it and give each kid 3 swing of the bat.
If you don't like the VP, have a better candidate in 4 or 8 years. For now, if you don't get rid of Trump, you're no better than the rest.
See prime example of propaganda being used. He bought they they were "Trump loving christians" Thats not a Christian.
I'm just curious, can you give me one example of Trump governing like Hitler?

I think that Trump should concentrate,on getting Barron‚Äôs school,up and running.
Trump is too full of himself,to ever learn a lesson.
Like his master Trump.Larry Kudlow strongly believes,in feeding the corporate greed.
So the #Trump Administration is going to sanction for them for abusing dissidents while actively abusing dissisents here worse with #secretpolice and misusing "nonlethal" weapons.  #BLM #antifa
This could be what Twitter is like when trump is gone.
Why is Trump so obsessed with taking down Tik Tok?
I‚Äôm glad they are whacking Trump now, but they are going to turn on Democrats the moment the election is over.  Give to candidates directly.
I will do whatever is necessary to vote Biden in And Trump OUT!
So Trump really banning tiktok üôÑ
Every headline should start "Due to Trump's inept, failed and non-existent response to covid.. "  Please and thank you.
I suppose but are there really that many and I think they would just tie it in with the trump stuff so that's not going to go away
Seeing all these progressives just going along with this Biden isn‚Äôt it but we just gotta do it in order to get Trump where the fuck is the fight in that where are the demands you all are just falling in line and giving Biden a pass you all aren‚Äôt even holding his feet to the üî•

I truly want to believe that this won‚Äôt be like Trump saying he‚Äôll have a new health care plan in 2 weeks.
I‚Äôll say it again, Biden is the racist old white dude that they tell you Trump is.
Donald Trump,is an anti First Amendment,anti catholic bigot,who spends his Sunday‚Äôs,on one of his golf courses.
Donald and Ivanka Trump,happily drove their workers,to China.
The Trump‚Äôs did even more.They took their jobs to low wage,authoritarian,Communist China..
Fake news Trump says that catholics are against God.
By entering into and maintaining, a business relationship with China.Donald Trump shows that China is number 1 to him.
By attacking Joe Biden for his Catholic faith.Donald Trump has shown himself,for the hateful,divisive   Bigot,that he is .
Trump is already hurting,the GOP.
Creepy Donald Trump,claims to be a ‚Äústable genius‚Äù yet offers no proof of this.If Trump  was an academic whiz,he‚Äôd be showing off his scholastic accomplishments,onFox news,for all the world to see.
Dr Trump is at it again ?
So now Trump thinks he‚Äôs God ?
Donald Trump disparages Biden‚Äôs school records,while hiding his academic ,‚Äùaccomplishments‚Äù from sight.
When COVID came calling.Donald Trump was asleep on the job.
Keep in mind these are the same guys that hacked chinese flag makers data to predict Trump to win in 2016.
If Trump really cared about American workers.He would‚Äôve brought his manufacturing jobs,back from China,long ago.
Trump will punish anyone,he perceives as being an enemy.
Well Trump should order them to open it up!  It's almost as if he doesn't care about his children at all!
You know if they really wanted Biden to debate Trump they would at least do some kind of Zoom Debate.
His work is not intended to help trump.  It may be an unintended consequence but that is not his fault.  He has not lied or exaggerated the truth since I‚Äôve followed him.  If you dislike him you will hate me. My ballot will be blood red top to bottom.  I hate centrists.
Trump is forgetting that the president can‚Äôt do that, probably because it‚Äôs something he would try to do if he were on the other side
Pencil me in for a trump vote then.
Trump is like a loud customer who gets on your nerves but, when you do a good job, he remembers your name, shows appreciation &amp; always leaves a big tip!  I‚Äôll take him over a phony polite guy who avoids eye contact and stiffs on tips every time!   üá∫üá∏TRUMP 2020üá∫üá∏
Mark me down as trump then. I can live with that.
Maybe. You know you are correct. I am helping trump.  If Biden wasn‚Äôt such a shitty nomination I most certainly wouldn‚Äôt be helping trump.  Every action has a re action.  Biden caused trump which causes........
My dumb ass voted Hillary.  I thought for sure she would win.   I was wrong.  I‚Äôm voting trump this year.  Biden is to far right for my vote. Trump is a protest vote.  If he wins he could completely destroy so many corporate creations. Need to nominate a real Dem in 24.
That would be great but it isn‚Äôt going to happen.  Voting to just not have trump is a waste of time.  It‚Äôs like a battered wife staying with the husband who beats her.  I‚Äôm out.  This shitty party has wasted enough of my time.  But good luck. Hope it works out for you.
Trump is like a loud customer who gets on your nerves but, when you do a good job, he remembers your name, shows appreciation &amp; always leaves a big tip!  I‚Äôll take him over a phony polite guy who avoids eye contact and stiffs on tips every time!   üá∫üá∏TRUMP 2020üá∫üá∏

Not sure why everyone‚Äôs so surprised. The only reason people ever thought Trump was racist is because the media decided that would be good for Democrats.
If I lived through Joe Biden voting with Republicans from 1973-2009 to make himself wealthy and screw the working class...... you can make another 4 years of trump.

You seem level headed.  I don‚Äôt do the weak ass corporate media both FOX and MSNBC well he did this crap.  To me they both suck. My disappointment in nomination creates an extra vote for trump.  Lesser of 2 evils is the permanent DNC campaign slogan. Lol
The lawsuit against the NRA has nothing to do with the 2nd Amendment, and everything to do with the fraud they were allegedly perpetuating, just like Trump Foundation and Trump University. Even the NRA is not above the rule of law!  But donny dip shit spins it to divide the ppl.

Trump is evil and shit but give us some sign that shit is going to change and that voters are being listened to cause as I see it right now Biden wins but what exactly is going to change for all of us who are out here barely making ends meet cause so far the poor/working class
Im sorry I can‚Äôt support this we deserve better than this. Trump must be taken out but so does the majority of the Republican party and the Dems who have enabled him.
Honestly in the Settle with Biden and this Vote Trump Out shit bothers me why are progressives doing the work for him when he and his campaign should be doing the work.

Posting Fuck Donald Trump isn‚Äôt stopping that fucking nightmarish piece of shit there needs to be a plan to hold his ass accountable I am not seeing any of these settle with Biden people talking about they just believe that if we get him out shit is just going to stop being
Right. This is the guy I'm assuming knows everything trump does he has to. It's baffling to me nobody has questioned him on his knowledge. They keep going after the big fish that they can't catch maybe if some others start feeling the heat they'll change their tune.
I don‚Äôt think anybody is advising him I think they are just letting him do whatever he wants. The campaign seems to not care their whole thing is we got to get Trump out vote for Biden cause he‚Äôs not Trump and that should be good enough it‚Äôs all very entitled and out of touch.
Yes I would . You should too. Unless you‚Äôre all talk about Trump. That‚Äôs the problem. People have gotten lazey.
Trump has four (4) more years to take out the trash!
Trump 2020.
So vote Trump out by giving Biden the nomination even though he did not deserve it and then make demands after he is elected as if Biden as if he is going to do anything what is this shit.
Biden won‚Äôt even debate or be at the convention. I hate Trump I think he is garbage but how is doing the work for Biden and his campaign going to push him to the left Biden keeps being given everything he also keeps getting free passes for barely doing nothing.
Protect it by getting rid of the Trump crony Postmaster General. Protect it by insuring the USPS has funding. Tweeting won‚Äôt fix it, Ronna. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
It's easy to armchair quarterback but he will say a lot of the same things Trump has already did. Except A travel ban on China that may have saved thousands of lives
Not very many &amp; the media doesn‚Äôt help at all. How many people do you hear blaming Trump for every Covid death. The media knows nobody really pays attention so they keep repeating their lies to convince them.
He‚Äôs a bold &amp; successful business man which makes him easy to attack but, he‚Äôs done way more for people in this country than I ever have. More than most. He‚Äôs got our interests in mind w/protecting our rights &amp; freedoms. Trump gets rid of dumb rules instead of making them. DT2020
At least don‚Äôt vote at all. You can‚Äôt really want Biden. 40yr career politician who‚Äôs never actually helped anyone but himself unless it was a coincidence. So crooked he can‚Äôt talk straight anymore &amp; There‚Äôs videos of him being ‚Äústrange‚Äù w/kids. Trump‚Äôs gotten really bad press.

This mornin' the "President" of the United States declared "children are immune" to COVID-19.Trump will kill us all. Entire second-grade class in Georgia school forced into COVID quarantine after just one day
So was Trump.
Then there is always the bloody,Bowling Green massacre,and the fake,Civil War monument,that Trump placed on one of his golf courses.Trump is an expert in fakery.
My nephew's wife ( a trump supporter) thinks kids should go back to school. Not her kids, they're adults. And when her kids were little they went to private school, with 7 kids per class.

Omg my last tweet looked like Trump talks wtf.
We don‚Äôt. We need Democrat government to release the cure= HCQ.  The only reason Trump talks about a vaccine is because every time he gives attention to something positive, the media tries to kill it. The whole ‚Äúvaccine coming soon‚Äù narrative is to ease some panic caused by MSM

The deal has been a success,for Trump and Ivanka.That is what really matters.

Trump cares only for revenge.
Donald Trump insists that China is to blame for the Virus.Yet he and Ivanka,are comfortable being partners with the Chinese Communist Party.

Nobody Trump knows or cares about is dying . So it is what it is.
They say they want to get Trump out but they do nothing to actually resist him and the Republican party there is no fight. They resist anything progressive and I wish people would open their eyes and see that both parties don‚Äôt care nor really have plans to work for the people.
That is one of the most horrible things I‚Äôve heard him say.  John Lewis is on a level with MLK Jr. as far as his impact.  Trump is an awful, awful man.

Does a vote for Kanye steal votes from Trump or from Biden?
I‚Äôll grant the first (although not so much for small businesses...and his terrifs etc have actually hurt) and fight to the death on the second. Abortion is up 4% under Trump, and that‚Äôs just the starting point, because life is more than birth.
Trump will sign an executive order to prevent evictions and utility shut downs. Keep America Great.

Trump Says What Many Americans Have Been Thinking: Epstein Might Not Have Killed Himself
Fair enough. But anyone who apologizes for either records of Trump or Biden is only fueling the continued cycle of corruption. Time for people to move beyond the duopoly and call out ALL politicians for their records.
I would also never vote for Trump, just like I would never vote for Biden. I vote third party most of the time. Some people do, so folks assuming that certain votes belong to certain candidates need to stop this bullshit assumption.
So with trump announcing these executive orders, (payroll tax suspended, student loans suspended, insurance companies can‚Äôt deny pre-existing conditions, cheap medications) does anyone on the left dare oppose this publicly? Watch the lefties squirm!
Are you for real? You assume that third party votes belong to Biden. Why don't they belong to Trump? If I vote third party, then am I not taking away a vote from Trump? Third party voters, like myself, were never going to vote for either Biden or Trump under any circumstance.
I served 4 years USN, visited 15 countries, spent more time than I care to remember in the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean, know how to correctly pronounce countries names and I‚Äôm more of a man than either you or tRUMP, and I‚Äôm not a felon !

Well why should  care if people are dying, starving, can't pay their bill? He is going to his club to golf for 3 days on our dime! This is why Trump &amp; the  need to all go in Nov they don't give a üí©about the American People! Sending kids to school to die.
I seriously think trump will dump pence for ivanka..
Can anybody on this plant please explain to me wth God, the Bible, guns, trumps wig, his orange skin, trump gold resorts are doing in a Whirlpool washer machine convention?
President Biden should play this dementia clip of Donald trump at every event until the very day Biden is sworn in.
This is NOT ok &amp; needs to be immediately investigated! Impeach trump again!
GOP, You own this horrible disaster called Donald trump! WTH is wrong in his brain to play a song like this, in today‚Äôs world at a campaign event with ‚ÄúLive &amp; Let Die‚Äù?? So I guess you all have agreed with his statement of ‚ÄúIt is what it is‚Äù?? This is a sick, disturbing person!üò°
Trump‚Äôs America: a student in Georgia has been suspended for sharing a video of crowded hallways with nary a mask in sight.  Students were warned about sharing any pictures of the mess by the principal on the loudspeaker. Freedom?

They're both private companies numb nuts. Trump agreed to their terms. Perhaps Nestor could explain this to you.
They the democrat's have tried everything in the book to lie about Trump because they can not control him . Democrat's need to go to jail for Treason now.
Facebook and Twitter are against Trump totally have been since day one.
Trump is yet again trying to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program ‚Äî a program that protects over 700,000 people from deportation and allows them to work and attend school in the United States, their home.
Hey Kev, ‚ÄúOur way of life‚Äù doesn‚Äôt matter because the you and the Trump sychophantic, lapdog enablers are allowing the mass deaths of Americans. At this rate, there won‚Äôt be enough of us left to have any ‚Äúway of life‚Äù. Great Job GOP!
45 has bankrupted 6 times. He is either bad with money or ripping people off. Which is it?   45 paid to sleep with a porn star and cheated on Melonia, the paid to cover it up.   Trump foundation shut down and not aloud to run a charity again because of self dealing.
trump‚Äôs Law and Order is handcuffing 9 year olds face down on the pavement. No thanks.
Hope he did not listen to Trump, about not wearing a mask!!! Trump was to meet with him today!!!
So you‚Äôre saying if his VP pick doesn‚Äôt meet your requirements, Trump gets your vote?  Good grief. Your red side is leaking.
Trump, remind us how well u handle the CORONAVIRUS in USA &amp; Ohio, remember to tell ur base there, today another of ur big lies, OK???
You may be surprised to learn that you have been lied to your entire life. As usual, a person who cannot argue facts results in smears and deflects from the points made. Truth hurts. Now I am just waiting to be called a Trump supporter and a Russian bot.
See what I mean about Ohio? Why does Trump say he has an October surprise? Will Putin, give him a vaccine before the election, for CORONAVIRUS, just wondering hmmm. Remember what Putin, did to Hillary &amp; her, e-mails before last election!!!
Didn‚Äôt u Dems mention that Pres. Trump has been receiving a lot of calls from Russian leader, Putin, LATELY??? Maybe instructing him what to do???
This movie mentioned Ohio, where Trump is headed for a rally. This movie reminds me what Trump &amp; Russia r trying 2 do, TAKE OVER AMERICA, so much for USA, USA! I suggest u all watch it!!!
Do you have trumps tax returns, you lie and get payed to . You lie more than trump ever has !
1: this is a sound bite, did any of you watch the full video ?    2: Trump says, and has said 20 times worse, so as far as I'm concerned it's Biden or no one.    3: if you don't vote, you voted for Trump... Thankyou and have a good day.
"I like taking guns away early," Trump said. "Take the guns first, go through due process second." So....who EXACTLY has talked about taking away gun...without due process FIRST ?
Maybe she has low grade depression because Trump is coming to get her POS crooked former president husband to expose all his treasonous acts while in office.
He would say something like that. Trump pleases the devil every day.
Deflecting &amp; Projecting ... 2 things tRump is actually good at!
Apparently you aren't following the right God. You would know Trump is not good for this world. He does too many things to benefit himself. Maybe you need to go back and reread the whole Bible.
I made it up? I am not talking about Reagan. I am talking about now. Look no further than Dem party apologists in this very thread. They deflect to Trump and Republicans every time that one calls out the corruption in the Dem party. That's what I mean by loyalty.
Trump is connected to them as well as Putin.
Is Donald Trump Preparing For An Insanity Defense? ‚Äì Dennis R. Hill. This is an excellent point. Since this was published, the amount of utterly insane proclamations, statements and actions ‚Å¶  has added could be used by Individual 1!
Trump just called Thailand "Thighland". Wow.
He could choose a fresh pile of dog crap and it would be a better choice than sicko trump!
The  choice is Clear but it is surprising how many people will cut their own nose off to spite their  face . The brainwashed liberal controlled Media continues to spout drivel about Trump and Ignore the Facts about Biden/Obama , Clinton , the Washington Swamp Cabal Pedos +more !
Has Anyone Considered The Possibility That Trump Is Not Really Smart? ‚Äì Dennis R. Hill. Do you mean to tell me the ‚Äú#HighIQStableGenious‚Äù ‚Å¶ isn‚Äôt really smart? I‚Äôm SHOCKED!! üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇüòÇü§£
Of course not. But this is just terribly bad timing. We need this election. I was finally starting to see rumblings against trump in my deep red state recently. Those will go away now.
Is there any other kind of call with trump or Geraldo?

Lmao you actually believe Trump has never paid for an abortion?  üòπüòπüòπüòπüòπ  Just listen to his victims. üò°üò°  One was 12.  12!!!
Lies.  Fear.  Lies.  Fear.  No vision.  No healthcare plan.  No plans for anything.  No policy.  That's Trump.
Says the bot with 7 followers since April, who has no original tweets, just retweets of Trump and Pence tweets and replies with snarky, non factual information/conspiracy theories!
Interesting you would agree, Trump above any career politicians.
Well senile old creepy Joe got away with saying ‚Äúpoor kids are just as smart and talented as white kids‚Äù so are we really surprised? For all the ‚ÄúTrump is racist‚Äù, the left lives ignoring the real racism on their side.

üòπüòπüòπüòπ  So there are a lot of Trumpers in Wyoming.  There are a lot if NRA fans here.  They are losing their üí© today.  Saying that they are coming for our guns now.  Yeah, that's not true.  Wyf is wrong g with people?  One says that if we don't elect Trump, there will be war.
Any critics of the DNC and Biden platform are accused of being a Trump supporter.  It's a reflex at this point.  It's the "fake news" of the Dems.
I live out in 2A country, and I will say that the NRA announcement was a gift to trump. He‚Äôs been having trouble finding a way to rally some GOPers, and ‚Äúthey‚Äôre takin‚Äô muh guns‚Äù is just the ticket. Not quite a comey, but bad timing nonetheless.

We So Silly Ignore Us Really We Dont Exit  Russia Got Trump Elected Moron! Blue check #2a4life
Is Pres. Trump saying Texas is corrupt &amp; u can get away with misusing NRA members money on Wayne LaPierre, &amp; his family, etc., huh!!!
Trump‚Äôs comment ‚ÄúI told him long ago to move to Texas!‚Äù Speaks Volumes of his corruption, period!!!
Why is Trump‚Äôs only comment on NY A.G. Lawsuit 2 dissolve The NRA, because ofthe leader Wayne LaPiersis mishandling of members millions of $$$ was, ‚ÄúI told him he should have moved 2 Texas.‚Äù Very revealing!!!
Indeed!   I‚Äôve never predicted a race before but this time I will. Trump will win in a landslide. Regardless of what else happens in the meantime.
Kanye genuinely believes he will win. I‚Äôm not sure if Trump followers would vote for him. He‚Äôs a black male and most Republicans are not that progressive.
Just because Trump continually says the virus ‚Äúwill go away,‚Äù does not make it so. I‚Äôve kept saying my ex-husband will go away. But alas, he hasn‚Äôt.
Imagine going after the NRA and not going after Trump and his family of criminals. There I fixed it
Lol. That's all that they've got because they cannot argue the facts. So, they resort to "you must support Trump". Their TVs did not tell them that they can be against BOTH Creepy Joe and Agent Orange. #poorlyeducated
I'm waiting for CONTEXT and explanation before I jump in with comment.  Lord knows Trump can't speak and still has his job!!!
Hoping this is true, but with Pompasspeo in charge, I see it more of a way to trying to find ppl who are willing to "talk" about their (Trump campaign) illegal activity and then to "silence" them.  Pompeo wants Trump to win.  But, I'm hoping I'm wrong.
Looking around at this fine, fine mess we have here, I think the chickens are coming home to roost. Feathers are flying thickly. Now it will get good, as even Trump's people are starting to realize that even if they didn't care if he destroys the world, they're going to hurt too.
The Trump base is tiny, much like other parts of Trump.
Secretary Azar is a criminal and like trump he cares nothing  for your children.
All roads lead to Putin and Trump.Because he‚Äôs spreading false info. I really don‚Äôt think Trump is gonna kiss you
That fatass pig is also suing a TV station in Wisconsin on behalf of the Trump campaign. So you want to know how crooked the election is and will be? Just ask the crybaby who's whining about mail ballots because he's already busy cheating.
Trump doesn‚Äôt need Help from Russia,Hillary wouldn‚Äôt have fared as well as she did in 2016 even though she lost she wouldn‚Äôt of had half the boat she got it they hadn‚Äôt been for google helping her
Just in time for Trump to award him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
Just because some kids embarrassed him he wants to go after a dancing app? Fuck Trump! Do real work and leave it alone
Jason Nichols: Biden's take on AA voters and 'diversity' was not wrong   ‚Å¶ wondering if your characterization would be the same if Trump said it? As we always say, if not for double standards the left would have none at all.
if you are seriously asking, here is the serious answer: Donald Trump dying from Covid-19.  Of course, President Pence would be trying to create a Theocracy to enshrine his bizarre beliefs in law.
They should give Trump peyote, then turn on the Coyotes game. Then tell him Mexico got a hockey team send tweet
Okay, but what if i were taking a walk with Donald Trump? Could I leave him behind to be eaten by a bear? Please? Pretty please? Mother may I?
Yes but now they have to focus on their defense, and can't donate to President Trump's campaign. Word is, this is the main reason NY AG is doing it. Sick!  I wish Republicans would learn to fight fire, with fire. They've done way more dirty sht! Sue! Investigate! Expose em!
I told Hillary in 16 that she needs Chinese bots to defeat Trump's Russian bots. She didn't listen therefore she didn't get elected. Biden's campaign did! You win by fighting fire with fire!!! He gets it!
Trump's new postmaster general ordered them to sort mail by hand instead of using the machines. He is purposely creating a backlog to mess with the election.
You realize we've always been divided right? It's just that every President we've had at least tried to unite us except this one well that is if you can even call Trump a President...more like a Hollywood entertainer.
I mean there's 78 million active monthly fortnite players who i'm sure would scream nonstop to their parents about how much they hate trump if they couldn't play anymore...
After the sell wechat order, if tencent decided to say, block all americans from fortnite and league of legends, could they leverage that into an anti-trump movement?
JOE BIDENS MENTAL STATE IS ZERO,HE DUMB,DON'T KNOW WHAT STATE OR CTY HE'S IN.BEN DON'T KNOW CRAP.HE WILL HURT AMERICANS,RAISE TAXES.BIDEN IS TREATING BLACKS WRONG SAYING STUPID CRAP..AMERICANS DON'T VOTE FOR BIDEN, VOTE TRUMP.

Trump is still furious over the mashed potato incident when his brother dumped a bowl of his potatoes on his head when he was 7 years old. What does that say about him? Don't retweet this. Trump would be furious.
Was Trump fantasizing about KFC or Ivanka
Hey funny what a Republican and a Trump supporter can agree on right? If only our politicians drank more. For real cheers I'm on my Crown Royal now lol.
If you truly were you'd realize that Trump uses us a photo op. Biden is a true Catholic. Why would you say he's not? Do you personally know him? That's what I thought
If Biden has 100 a day then Trump has a million. You really want to keep on going? Come on dude check yourself before you wreck yourself...literally
You do realize Trump was literally hanging out in a bunker during the Washington DC protests right? Some leader
You say Biden has dementia but Trump has 2 gaffes in one day? Yeah I'd chill on that
The worst things Biden has said compares nothing to the things Trump has said that is for certain and at least Biden has the decency to apologize if he feels he has said wrong while Trump feels he can't do or say wrong which is exactly why we're in the dire situation we are in
You did all this just to not have to see Trump? You could‚Äôve just said no.
I can‚Äôt argue that he has dealt with an incredible amount of grief. That story I shared is completely legit though, along with many other instances of his dishonesty. All I said was Joe Biden will not be a good President. I didn‚Äôt say he should or shouldn‚Äôt beat Trump.
Rabid dogs wear muzzles, Donald Trump should wear a face mask that has a built in fact-checker for when he speaks as President on the job.
And I'd honestly vote for a literal rock over Trump lol
Dems didn't expect Trump to mess up this much and are now having Biden talk, along with suing the NRA, in order to lose harder.
Trump wouldn‚Äôt know a bible even if he had to walk behind teargas to hold one.
I respect your opinion I only see one evil this election in fact I see Biden as someone that shares more true conservative values than Trump does
I'm a Republican who wants the days of Reagan back. Trump is the opposite of that. Reagan said lets accept the responsibility of the future while Trump says he doesn't take responsibility for anything. Enough said.
The numbers don't lie. Trump has lied more than anybody else in history and YouTube videos can prove that.
Disinformation about Trump seems impossible since that man is known to lie all of the time...

Trump says arrest the press.
Biden had a little bit of a gaffe today but thanks to Trump that got overshadowed big time. For Biden just has a speech impediment, Trump is just plain dumb and ignorant.
Donald Trump doesn't know how to drive a car! Probably wouldn't know how to start a new one.
See I don‚Äôt think Joe Biden is a decent human being, but that‚Äôs just my opinion. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a good politician, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs of sound mind and I certainly do not believe he will be a good President. I‚Äôm taking Trump out of the equation and just evaluating Biden.
No let us take it to the Bridge as they say,   Trump is charged with crimes against Humanity. The neglect and ignoring the scientist, which  led to the spreading of Covid -19 and the killing of 160,000 US citizens and counting.    While on his way to the land of #MAGA
What a fucking moron...  Here‚Äôs what Trump got wrong about America‚Äôs COVID-19 death rate
Trump has had 2 gaffes in one day yet he says Biden is mentally ill? Lol
I dislike Trump‚Äôs posture, speaking abilities, hair piece, all of it. It‚Äôs a sickening sight.
#JoeBiden is a Catholic who attends Mass. The closes #Trump has EVER gotten to Scripture was when he held up a Bible for a photo-op... if we are to believe it was a Bible! #thursdayvibes #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
Biden wouldn't block Trump's prosecution if the Justice Department pursued it   Prosecuted for beating Hillary?
If he could get away from Trump I think it'd help him a ton. He has a promising future if he does. His latest ad is quite interesting though
I know Trump supporters tried to vote for Brenda...and it failed...I think this may be a sign that this state is finally ready to get rid of the Antichrist known as Trump my friend
Hard to doubt Hillary would have been worse than Trump considering the situation we are in now...
Sure but the Trump campaign also doctored information about her and sadly people believed it had they not well we probably wouldn't be in the situation we are in now at least it wouldn't be as dire
Or Donald Trump becoming President...
I don't trust any video from Trump supporters they'll doctor anything they did that to Hillary and that's why she lost in 2016
So I know some people personally that compared Hitler to Trump. Do they not realize that by saying shit like that they‚Äôre minimizing the Holocaust? I mean come on!!
That dude you quoted is a Trump supporter though so that might have been doctored to begin with
This year yes we have to. Besides Biden's worst compared nothing to Trump's worst
So sad that trump has Obama envy.
This is why Trump doesn‚Äôt want mail in voting.
Fuck you Donald Trump. LeBron ur the real OG
Mr Trump your fear and misinformation about the vote is misleading and frankly just wrong.  The voting process where I live is secure.  voters are influenced by this campaign from the social media platforms, which you are speaking from.  And the lies you put out as truth.
I'd bet a year's salary that he's a Trump supporter.
Many parents prefer mixing online and in-person school, poll finds
I would think being the President of the USA , the most powerful Country in the world  he should have taken the lead of Govenors and the 50 States. Instead 50 Gov. doing 50 different things and 1000 people dying per day. ‚ÄúAs Trump says, it is what it is‚Äô.

I can‚Äôt predict the future but Joe Biden does not seem to be a viable candidate to run this country in my eyes. I‚Äôm not trying to compare him to Trump, I‚Äôm trying to gauge his potential to be a good President. I do not see it.
You would think a guy who‚Äôs showing clear signs of Dementia and has plenty of other baggage would not be elected man but Trump has been vilified by the media to the point where even some of his base has turned on him.
Biden will beat Trump. I don‚Äôt like Biden, I do not think he will be a good President (Easily could be the worst President of all time), but he will beat Trump. Only way Biden loses is if he absolutely shits the bed on the debate stage. It would have to be a historic meltdown.
1. Find a real doctor 2. Report this one to the AMA and state licensing board as this doctor should lose their credentials (like that one Trump tweeted about, they have not practiced medicine for years)
Out of curiosity, if you do. Why do you hate Donald trump?
I just watched the Axios interview again and I don't know how Johnathan Swan made it through that interview without laughing his ass off. I'm sorry I know this isnt PC but Trump is fucking mentally retarded. Flat out Mentally Retarded there's no other way of putting it.
His bitches at Fox Conspiracy channel like Hannity, Carlson, Geraldo and especially Hannitys bitch Dan Bongino should join Trump in his jail cell when this is all over. All these fucking idiots do night after night is lie on National TV aided by their Australian billionaire boss.
If I was in charge of a global broadcasting news network, I would never allow a live stream of Donald Trump.  The reason for it would be to delay the stream for fact checking.  He is spreading false claims and lies to Americans and the world nonstop which is very harmful.

Fuck Kushner, fuck Trump and fuck everyone who supports these 2 cocksuckers!
&amp; why hasn‚Äôt he done it to trump? Or passed down his assassin skills to his child?
The point is how do we know she is lying? Because Trump said so? He is always truthful. How is it Trump supporters can see others lies but never see his.   A man who is responsible for 158,000 deaths and continues to deny with a  mantra, ‚ÄúIt is what it is‚Äù.
Lmao buddy said ‚Äúmanuals, what manuals!?‚Äù So sincerely. Trump is a psycho.
Two decades of pandemic war games failed to account for Donald Trump
The one thing I don‚Äôt really get about trump supporters is that they will try defend him when it comes to him being racist, misogynist, or transphobic and say that none of those things are true, but even if they weren‚Äôt true like what does he do that makes you support him anyway?

When hasn't he helped Trump in every way he can!
After 60%+ votes have already been cast in some states, the 1st debate is planned...but will it be realized? Ahhh, different ?? Biden won‚Äôt debate because he knows he can‚Äôt match Trump, on ANY subject. That is, if Trump shows up and not The Donald!
Let's call it what it is. We have a homicidal lunatic in the WH who has no empathy and just wants to win at our expense. Why should we sacrifice our children because he wants everything to look normal when peeling back the surface it stinks of the rotten Trump stench.
That‚Äôs why we need to go out and vote trump and his goonies out of the office
Those are the people are stealing this country. And trump is going to bankrupt this country like he did to all of previous companies
Around 2 people died of Ebola. Trump pandemic killed over 160,000, and more dying
Trump thinks that America is to him and he doesn‚Äôt want to give it up. Everyone needs to stand for trump and tell him this is dictatorships country
Trump Hashem stolen over $660 billion dollars. This the money is Congress is asking trump administration about. And trump isn‚Äôt listening nor giving anything to Congress
Trump isn't a gift to the GOP the sooner he has been voted out the better our party will be...WE NEED TO GET BACK TO REAL CONSERVATIVE VALUES!!!

But why? Just yesterday Donald Trump said we've got ahold on this virus now and it's going away, AGAIN!
Trump if he loses the election to Biden
You know this because? It becomes a mystery to me.  Trump has lied over and over, 160,000 people have  died. He lies that the US is doing better then any country in the world. He should be arrested for crimes against humanity.   I will use Trump‚Äôs response, It is What It Is.
After listening to Tucker Carlson speaking about George Floyd's death, I actually think, he is even more ignorant that Trump.

What bothers me,really is to think of all the people who voted for him and the people who did not vote at all in 2016.   Please Dear Lord,  Please VOTE in 2020  For those who voted for Trump no words for you. You will vote for him again. Like my Grandma says like hang with Like
#TrumpIsALaughingStock It has been speculated, pondered upon,and contemplated  but it is now been authenticated, Trump is ignorant and lack leadership skills. A reporter said to him, you have lost 158,000 US citizens to the COVID-19 and Trump says, it is what it is.
It presents a problem for their false narrative.
I‚Äôm gonna miss not having debates with an audience cause I was hoping Biden would invite all of the women Trump sexually abused to sit in the audience like that ba$tard did with The Clinton‚Äôs. The difference being it didn‚Äôt rattle Hillary it would totally shut Trump down.

Wow Trump is such a comedian!
Ok Kayleigh with the short memory, remember when you and Trish Reagan had the laugh that cost her the job she had. President Trump wont let the virus come here and isnt that refreshing is exactly what you said! So go back and finish sucking that bag of dicks!
You have The Kennedy Libray, The Reagan Library, The Clinton Library, The Obama Library and last but definitely least The Trump Virus! If Trump had a library it would only consist of the one book he completed reading, The Cat In The Hat.
Trump's fault.
Its true. I‚Äôm not sure why Trump agrees to all these inteviews, people just end up hating him for it. We know by now that if it isn‚Äôt about Trump, Trump isn‚Äôt interested.
Initially I thought you were giving Trump too much credit for having a clue, but yea how could he not know this ‚Äúcivil rights legend‚Äù?
I truly wish she did. But 99% of ppl who want to vote for her will say a vote for her is a vote for Biden or a vote for trump. I wish ppl truly believed there was more then two parties but this country‚Äôs far from that.
Oh and don‚Äôt forget Trump destroying the USPS, getting Russian support during the election, and being ok with Russia giving weapons to the Taliban that then killed our soldiers
I don‚Äôt love Biden either but at this point I don‚Äôt know how you can look at any Trump ‚Äúpolicy‚Äù or interview and still think he won‚Äôt destroy this country. 155k preventable deaths, hate crimes, sexism, racism, and the worst 2nd quarter ever is trumps legacy
I don‚Äôt know what the big deal is- Trump is 100% correct, we are, indeed, lower than the world. We are subterranean. We‚Äôre in the fucking underworld. Tell me we‚Äôre not in Hades.
The fact that people think Trump isn‚Äôt a pedophile himself is wild to me. Like just look into that nasty history of his since the 80‚Äôs bro ü§£ü§£
god youre so in love with trump it‚Äôs unbearable
dog, that Axios Trump interview is so embarrassingly funny
Trump only pays attention to cases because we are in ‚Äúfirst‚Äù in that regard, literally the only star he cares about. This is so fucked up
Have I mentioned lately that  is an idiot? And for him to think he's done more for blacks than Rep Lewis is laughable. Trump is the biggest loser though!
Biden is winning in some of the most important swing states. Trump only won with 25% of the vote last time if our generation actually would vote Biden can win in a landslide. And tbh Nick it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúlol‚Äù if trump wins again it‚Äôs going to be devestating for our democracy
But 157 K are dead and somehow Trump supporters are okay with it although 12 K were dead with Swine Flu in the Obama administration and they went bat crazy over that. There's no consistency with them, JaMarcus Russell.
really said ‚Äúit is what it is‚Äù when asked about the 155k preventable deaths from COVID. He still won‚Äôt take responsibility, he doesn‚Äôt care about any of them, and then cries and wonders why people don‚Äôt like him. Trump is a disgrace and needs to be voted out
Not cause someone is a trump supporter its actually not as easy I've only gotten a few signs down just not all but I could say the same thing about the Dummycrats they lost thier ways ago now I'm conservative/Republican Make America great again
Dear President Trump, we are all going to do that.  We are going to vote you out. Bye bye
lies lies lies!  My prescriptions are more expensive overall, many are cheaper due to dreaded generics, and costing me less out of pocket due to the Medicare Advantage insurance I have that Trump wants to take away. (Every Trump budget proposed cuts to that and Social Security.)
I expect Trump to mock them, as he did John McCain for being a POW.
Stick to what you know which is lying and making shit up. Talib is ahead by over 20 points in her district dumbass! I'm not sure who's worse for this country Trump or this big headed motherfucker.

Court filings suggest Trump is being investigated for fraud: report
I'm damn proud of Lehner in particular since he's publicly supported Trump. Maybe this will show some others who currently still do that it has nothing to do with the anthem or flag.  Finally! #Kneel4Hockey
Trump is a fraud and that's the nicest thing I can say about that orange piece of shit!
Shhhhh don't tell Trump that lets have him figure it out on his own.
Donald Trump is the enemy of the people.  #TrumpThreatensAmerica  #TrumpVirusDeathToll156K  #TrumpVirus  #TrumpIsALaughingStock  #TrumpHasNoPlan  #TrumpIsLosing  #EnemyOfThePeople  #TrumpEnemyOfThePeople   All of the above already existed. I did not make up any.
it is now known as the Trump Virus. #TrumpVirus since you have used it more effectively to kill off Americans than anyone else anywhere else.
You are out of your mind! No one wants Trump if they want to survive and thrive!

Court filings suggest Trump is being investigated for fraud: report
I don‚Äôt have one Trump sign by me or one Biden sign by me! Signs mean nothing. I saw at least 100 bad tweets against trump and 1 really bad tweet against trump and all kinds of bad memes about trump. I‚Äôve seen more than 4 great tweets for Biden, 4 yes way more than 4. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Well Trump takes off his wig and sits with a cat in his lap.
Same with me But I crack up watching Sarah Cooper She's 1 funny talented young lady Trump was burned by youngsters using the ap They made them think the the Tulsa rally was going to be HUGE Turned out tiny like his manly organ
The CDC is under the Federal Government, which is controlled by Trump....
I agree with Speaker Pelosi. Giving up your integrity to be Trump's go-to-person is reprehensible !!
It is an amazing book. Many of the phrases that his father, Fred Trump, uses are phrases that Trump uses every day. This include Hyperbole. It is a true window into the scary territory of Trump's mind.
She got a CNN job after she got in an argument with Trump on TV
Trump has been lying his entire life! KARMA IS CATCHING UP WITH HIM!!
Twitter is US-based, so they wouldn‚Äôt have the national security pretext that they have with TikTok. It‚Äôs much harder (if not impossible) to ban a US app via presidential order. Besides, Trump would probably die without Twitter.
By Trump
It will never happen before Nov. 3rd because it is to big to have go under until Trump will act like the dictator he is. He will lose the election if he does.
‚ÄúHis not going anywhere‚Äù?  Try He‚Äôs! That says enough. Another uneducated member of the tRump cult. Not wasting my time anymore. Bye.
I still don't. We need leaders, and they are both.  Trump is a racist game show host who couldn't lead a pick and roll let alone the country.
In the McCain household. Meghan supports Joe while her husband supports Trump? Well that has to be awkward...
Just the price of the Trump curse!! #TrumpStench
Too bad there was a trump flag in the picture too.
The water line is pretty clean though. Just needs a pressure wash. Now to burn that Trump flag that passed by. Idiots.
Because she says what Trump likes to hear! If you lose your integrity can you get it back? Or is it like virginity, gone for good. "Everything Trump touches dies."
And Trump supporters at that. Shameful.
I hope that the guy with the trump flag gets arrested
Does anyone want to bet that Chris Wallace gives Duckworth nothing but softball questions and doesn't push back on her at all. This will be nothing but a glorified anti Trump interview.
Trump Teaches History #TrumpLies
definitely not in my top 10 but i think it‚Äôs high on a Trump‚Äôs list
Lying motherfucker Trump is down double digits even in the last Fox Conspiracy channel poll in Michigan and has pulled all of his ads. Trumps doing so well he's stalled his whole campaign to try to go a different way. Fox Conspiracy Channel is by far the worst thing to happen
Yes Mr. Trump what about the Russian bounty on our AMERICAN servicemen and women who are being targeted by the Taliban?  What do you say about THAT?  You care more about twitter than you do our military.
Giving up your integrity is like giving up virginity! You can never get either back! The Trump stench ruins careers and reputations.
Maybe she shouldn't have given up her integrity.  To Trump. Is losing your integrity the same as losing your virginity? You can't get it back!!
"Very concerned" "Trump has learned his lesson."
And Donald Trump and Melania were partying with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell at Mar-a-lago like it‚Äôs 1999.  And what was going on there?  Why are there reports of children molested there also?  And Trump payed them off to get rid of the accusations?  Why?
Fit for the job??? LMAO.... the man won't come out of his basement unless it's to talk to reporters that he's and his team has picked. He will be slaughtered in the debates against Trump cuz he can't do a coherent sentence live....
Trump is still embarrassed about when his brother dumped mashed potatoes on his head when he was 7 years old. Don't retweet he would hate it.
Trump is still the 7 year old kid with the mashed potatoes dumped on his head.
At this point Donald Trump is trolling us when it comes to TikTok being banned üíÄ
People keep saying we will have a vote and yes we will!!! BUT SO MANY MORE PEOPLE WILL DIE UNTIL THEN  WHERE IS THE WHOLE OF THE GOVERNMENT TO COME UP WITH A PLAN SND FIX THIS OR SLAP TRUMP ACROSS THE HEAD AND TELL HIM TO DO HIS JOB
Can anyone seriously imagine Trump doing that? The baby would shit all over him from being startled.
opposed Trump. Done.
it's been all of America under tRump
I won't accept the results if the vote is not held in public! #whatsappdown
Stop blaming Trump for everything and anything!  Stop the ignorance!
#BillClintonIsAPedo but so is Trump, Trump supporters so be consistent
Trump never implemented his healthcare plan thanks to John McCain. The garbage health care that we have now is thanks to Obamacare. An actual free market health care system would be the best in the world by far.
This is why he disappoints me as a Republican all he does is follow Trump and refuses to take charge...
People are talking about what a bad golfer Trump is. They even let him win, because he is such a poor loser. Shh! We wouldn't want him to know what people think of him.
It's amazing how they left out the source--the Bible--as clearly spelled out in the Talmud! That calls "all non-Jews (the goyim) really animals, just in human form"! Slavery was considered as Christians' "God given right". Chit rolls downhill! #banthebible
Trump plz don‚Äôt shut down TikTok it‚Äôs the only thing that keeps my gf happy
I have not seen them, but you had me at mock Trump.over the Trump/DeVos/Huizenga supporter  Vanwoerkom does not represent our values or support our public schools.

Her inner trump is growing stronger Bwa haha
I just think Biden is less dangerous and I would rather deal with him than Trump. I don't even like him, this is all pragmatism here.
Do you have Neil the concept. I do not know how Trump is not going to make this a reality and screw everything up. His goal is to not have mail-in ballots, and he‚Äôs going to move heaven and earth to make sure that happens.
tRump will take credit for the ACA in 3, 2, 1...
Yes! TRUMP VIRUS
It's not the China virus! It's the tRump virus!  You're responsible for this in America
It should be considered election interference because they are silencing one group from talking amongst themselves while putting the other out on blast. The worse part is I know they are because I know a lot more pro Trump people in real life in a fucking far left community...
Really I have not seen so many Trump signs this year. They keep saying my area is Biden but... I honestly only seen like 2 Biden signs to every 20 Trump signs.
That's why I gave up on the FB &amp; IG crack pipe a while back. The Zuck is just as narcissistic as Trump is. Plus its awful product.
Why didn‚Äôt the Trump administration realize in March that testing and contact tracing would be the keys to stopping Covid-19 from devastating the economy?
Two or three States flip and it's a different story. Remember back watching Florida flip from Hillary to Trump. That was the difference, all the momentum shifted.
No one is going to take any trump vaccine that comes out in Nov just in time for the election. This will be just like the other snake oil meds the duck hawks.
Who is it again that's against healthy food?

Waiting for them to blame Trump when the violence goes up after they defund the police in certain areas.
Are you speaking about Trump? Because he has killed over 150,000 so far and it‚Äôs increasing by 1,000 per day
What a lie! The Trump administration has invested a ton into the stock market keeping it relevant.
You are so damn ignorant Trump! And yes you are right Trump does not know a damn thing about our constitution nor does he realize that everybody is for the second amendment, but under certain conditions. Never seen a grown man whine like a 5 yr old alone a President act like him
Trump will definitely fold at a debate with Biden. Biden will destroy him lol
Laurence I wouldn't give Trump a damn dime..I bet he has stole more than that from us taxpayers
Stop with the lies we will re-elect Donald Trump
Mary Trump you need mental help., you apparently thought you could cure yourself by your degree, but so far it hasn‚Äôt worked! Your a very angry hurt person I feel sorry for you, and I will pray for you!
This globalwarming shit... They trying to blame Trump on or something. THEY BEEN SAYING THE SAME SHIT FOR OVER 20 FUCKING YEARS. IT'S JUST THE FUCKING WEATHER. IT'S FUCKING NORMAL.
OMG! There must be hundreds of people out there showing their support, while millions of Ohio workers are out of work, because Trump refused to acknowledge the coronavirus and protect our borders!
If the thing is correct about the order that Trump just made.
When Trump said he was going to drain the swamp  I didn't know he meant the video game's swamp.
I know Biden isn‚Äôt perfect. He wasn‚Äôt even on my radar as a presidential choice. But any notion of a moral equivalence between him and Trump is hilarious.
The ones they take from Facebook friends of Trump! I take the poll just to vote no on his begging for donations crock
Pence is simply aware that the camera is on him and that trump will notice if he doesn‚Äôt publicly lick donnie like a lollipop in a porno
Or the trump clan?
The comment I have heard from republicans that voted for trump and who are not going to vote for him now is. Vote out the incumbent.
tRump‚Äôs ‚Äúracial insensitivity‚Äù Is actually blatant racism and the reason noxious CONservatism needs to be beaten into the ground, bleed dry, and rebuilt from the ground up.
If you fallow Trump then you fallow a false ideal. It plainly speeks of such things. You should read it once in while.
"it is what it is" "i don't take any responsibility" -trump 2020
Don't worry Byron. Don't take Redrac seriously. He's just a gaslighting bot. Just to get you riled up with projected lies and falacies. He's just another trump knob-polisher. Pay no heed to him.
well then they will have to move planned parenthood to Texas right?? that is where Trump said the NRA should move too
Trump just said he wants a cut of every deal wonder how much he is getting??
What is it you think he said? Since you translate Trump constantly, this man has concern and empathy at there for of his speeches, something you are totally unprepared for.
If you type the word ‚Äúidiot‚Äù in a google search and then hit ‚Äúimages‚Äù Trump‚Äôs pic is the first to pop up. This is not fiction...100% real. Cracks me the hell up!
Follow the facts and apply the law. Enough is enough. Dissolve the NRA just like the Trump Org. was dissolved.
They gave Trump some damn pictionary colors and you still don't understand it..
They gave Trump colorful pictures this is how many people died the color red. That's how he understand pictionary ..
Axios article listed tweets about trump and you‚Äôre quoted.
Are you really that stupid Trump? People have been voting by mail for over many years. What about your mail-in vote that you did? Is that fraud when you do it right? The only fraud that's going to happen during election as you! pray to God that day comes when we say goodbye!!
Trump says Sally Yates 'lying or grossly incompetent' on Comey testimony  #FoxNews
Washington Post issues major correction after botching Trump-Twitter post  #FoxNews
Trump used his own plane
She can't testify to hear say. Only what she knows for fact. When had Trump testified?
Haha, you guys are so twisted.  For what? Seriously are nuts believing Trump at all. The accruals courts are making him in criminal investigations, none of those that you name.
The trump administration..
I didn't hear that Twitter suspended Trump's account, but Trump's campaign account. I think someone didn't read the article, or write it, correctly.
Better Biden than tRUMP. At least he's never spent 5 TRILLION in 5 months! All while letting 150,000 people die and more than 2,200,000 currently infected out of 4.9 million cases!
At least Obama didn't borrow 5 TRILLION dollars over his 8 years in office, that Trump will have borrowed in less than 4! Paying people more money to not work, than if they did, is not good for the economy!
Update: Twitter temporarily bans Trump team from tweeting  via
While Biden on the other hand will not save the world from global warming, will not legalize weed, will not end forever wars, will not end anything he inherits. Rather exacerbate much like trump did after warmonger Obama
At least trump is out in the open and still sticking a finger in the eye of the bastards here and there (needs to stick his own eye once) by trying to get out of Afghanistan. Also created the biggest uptick of income inequality in American history.
In what way is he better than trump?
Later, rinse, repeat! The same claim against everyone who says anything discrediting tRUMP! Corruption, lies, and scandals are all you are, topped off by bigotry, racism, and cruelty.
An American President could only be born in America, Karen! Do you not think it was verified, more than once? How about Trump's tax returns? We've been waiting...
You're one of the 7% of black Americans that support Trump. That leaves 93% that don't!
He said soon.  I believe he's waiting so Trump don't start his badgering and stupid comments about sleepy Joe and his VP.  I love how he's keeping Trump off balance on not knowing what Biden is doing.. You know this eating Trump up inside. I love it!!
You must be pretty ignorant if you don't understand what was going on! It showed innocent people getting beat up and thrown in Vans and taken away by these Trump hazmats.  I agree with you 100%...
While you open other national sites to mining!
This president &amp; vice president are totally responsible for many of the deaths from covid 19 by their inactions &amp; incompetence. It is the TRUMP VIRUS.
Where are the twenty five women survivors of Trump sexual attacks? Does being a sexual deviant qualify Trump from being a qualified leader?
It can be looked at another way. Putin has also arrested protesters. Trump is doing the same thing. They're both fashy autocrats.   But yeah, liberals can be shortsighted and a lot of them don't understand how we actually got here.
I wish they'd have learned that when trump won
Donald Trump: It is what it is USA:
the  wants Trump...but we the People are going to give them the RULE OF LAW
Because it was been made political by tRump and allies.
Our corrupted REPUBLICANS AND CHURCHES BRAINWASHED THE SHEEP TO VOTE FOR RACISTS WHO HATE WOMENS CHOICE BECAUSE GOD COMMANDS SUBSERVIENCE AND SUBMISSION AND FAITH. Sorry to yell, I hate trump
With his signature, Trump became the greatest conservationist in a generation
You should probably pass a Corona Bill before Trump signs an executive order and get's the biggest bump he'll ever get in terms of popularity....
So you‚Äôre going to sit on your hands and let Trump sign an executive order giving Americans money to save their homes and families in spite of you? Lol. You guys handing him a golden ticket to re-election is the most democrat move ever. GET A DEAL DONE NOW
Just think how far the money tRump has spent on golfing go in these poorer districts!
Obviously, it means #Biden is a #communist. That's how it worked when David Duke said he was voting #Trump in 2016.   Will Biden condemn the communist party (like Trump did DD &amp; KKK) and reject their endorsement? #2020Elections #Election2020
How can you stop a trump from doing what he loves, Lying, talking, condescension, wishing (warning) evil people well? Did I mention lying?
Trump was right . We are number one! In deaths. Yeah! üò©
Haha, I just love animals so much, and I don‚Äôt like snakes. Trump tells the rally goers his story of the snake so it really fits.
Salt stings open wounds. Trump is so obviously wounded
At this point covid only happened to prove Trump wrong at something. (As far as I see it aka "the internet is serious business".)
Again, kids are not buying guns legally. You people are nuts! They are buying guns off the street from gang members! Pres Trump is NOT responsible for ‚Äúunderground buying of guns‚Äù, get real! WATCH YOUR OWN KIDS!!
What a HORRIBLE PERSON! What has tRump unleashed?
Finally Numb  via      This song is for everyone going numb to the barrage of terrible trump topic every day
Yet Trump is promoting mail in voting himself!
The media needs to share these facts when Trump talks about how ‚Äúfantastic ‚Äú the US is doing.
Oh mob money built his Trump tower.
I mean I get Trump stumbles over his words but it's easy to compete against a man who can randomly wordsalad during a debate.
We already know everything we need to know about this pure evil POS: ‚ÄúOh, we‚Äôd fill it,‚Äù McConnell said with a smile when asked last year whether he would act to confirm a Trump nominee to the Supreme Court should a seat become vacancy. Divided my ass!
#DearMichigan - don't be #insane. A vote for Trump is a vote for #fascism
I will say that it‚Äôs pretty cool that Trump showed up (far left) to approve the massive turn out.  Love the thumb up for the dedicated.
Trump=oy vey!
Ryan Knight is a Bernie or bust dolt. He blocked me for stating this same fact, that tRump is a racist fascist and must be voted out. Oh, and fact two that Bernie was out. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
no other President and administration has lied to the American People as much as yours and you..the Fake News comes from you.. President Trump has made more than 20,000 false or misleading claims  they are being polite it's called LIES
Funny Trump has had all the CDC data for weeks and has yet to correct that number.... Wonder Why?
That was kinda at the moment Russia really accelerated things then wasn't it. We're they paying Trump a lot? Remember when you told Ryan that?
Surprised you would like Trump then, how he hasn't moved on helping Venezuela to establish a proper government. Not since Russia moved into Venezuela's Waters he backed off like a bitch. But I know you won't engage you are only a Trump promoter.
Trump own chief of testing has already stated move on from that drug, not proven. Does more harm than good.
fuck u and donald trump
Now do actual tRump cultists:
This administration would have no leg to stand on if it took any responsibility. It doesn't take responsibility nor should get any credit. It's already shown that it can't do a good job. There wasn't any Marxism under any previous Democratic admin. Trump has already failed.
This is the new Trump take, as we lose 33% off our gdp. On our way to over 250k dead. Continued chaos daily.  need a new candidate.
I'm from Western Michigan.  I have seen 2 Biden signs and probably 50-75 Trump signs, flags, etc.  I think people are sick of the chaos.
Yeah, distraction works for trump and little kids
I will not allow trump pandemic to end our 43 years together
I don‚Äôt think trump can block or I know 20K peeps including me who would be blocked by nowü§£
And yet your slipping in Texas! How can you screw up two of the strongest Republican states, Florida and Texas? Another Trump record to stand for a millennia!
Dirty Truth really means "Fake Information".  #LincolnProject  provides the unvarnished truth about Trump, the Lying King. How many Republican supporters have used absentee(mail-in) voting for previous elections? Trump is trying to suppress your and every other American's vote.
And its bad. At least spend the $ for a professional. Oh that's right all the $$$ been siphoned enter Trump's pocket.
How do christian people not cringe at trump actions, inhumane as fukkk
He F‚Äôd up! That‚Äôs for sure. I think this ad is really for Rs not resisters. Reagan admirers need to see the contrast with trump and reject trump, and Biden seems much less of a risk than say a leftier guy like bernie. Get what I‚Äôm trying to say?üòÜ‚úåüèª
Wonder if tRump would feel this way if he was white.  Probably not.
No it won't, people are not going to return to shopping and going out for a long time when there is still people out there not taking the trump virus seriously.
Unpopular Opinion: The PizzaGate conspiracy mostly isn‚Äôt real,it was pushed by the Trump administration in 2k16 to discredit and sink Hillary‚Äôs presidential campaign,now it‚Äôs back in 2020 to do the same thing to Joe Biden‚Äôs ü•¥
And it all will be lies! Right now, Mexicans are avoiding the US, because of the coronavirus. Trump is pushing to cut Medicare, Medicaid, and social security spending. He's ruined affordable healthcare for all, and hasn't come up with any replacement.
The past 6 months have shown is the real Donald Trump. Is that what you want the next 4 years to look like? So you want the US divided and at war with itself? That makes you an anarchist!
864511320 That's "get rid of Trump on November 3rd 2020" for those who don't understand!
Your just one of the ~35% that will vote for Trump. Too bad he's short the votes he needs, for his supporters to see him for another 4 years!

They weren‚Äôt empty or unmanned until trump decided anything obama did MUST BE DESTROYED! Trump said it out loud. Block Party!! Aisle 86
Another thing to point out about this is people are suggesting that Trump just pass privacy laws. Well we did have some... I don't know if Obama abolished that but I know shit changed during his presidency.
If Trump really wanted to make a difference he should ban all Chinese based apps.

Objectively thinking or embracing your inner devil? Interesting in the middle of a pandemic that's killed over 100k Americans and protests in the streets against police brutality and systemic racism you came to the light that Trump's a good guy. Nope you're just trash.
In spite of what happens to it, trump loses sooner or later. If all democracies die, so do their dictatorsI am not a Trump supporter. I just can‚Äôt believe the DNC let the party down by giving us this. Is that who you want to answer the phone at 2 am and it‚Äôs a national security crisis.

MY NEW FILM SHORT  #TrumpsFakeChristianity  Donald Trump uses God the way he uses everyone else.
Is Trump  gonna  shoot the  VIRUS  out  of  the  air  here  in  America  like wanting  to  nuke hurricanes?
Trump lies that he got Veterans Choice passed after others had tried for almost 50 years, though Choice was a Sanders-McCain bill signed into law by Obama in 2014, and he's said this more than 142 times and how do I not have a keyboard hot key for this yet
Biden campaign claims lagging auto jobs puts Trump at disadvantage in Michigan
But Melania Trump nudes are all over on the internet. What do you say about that ?
tRump is the President
Probably a popular opinion but one I haven't seen voiced yet: Ivy league schools deserve a lot more crap for admitting, educating and enabling Trump, Kushner, etc because of their wealth and despite their ability.
Trump ruined his businesses now he wants to ruin the United States of America üá∫üá∏ and those who don‚Äôt see it must totally blind and/or brain dead!
Even from a distance that Trump building is heinous.

Speaking of Thighland, just wait until Trump sees Niger on the teleprompter.
This isn‚Äôt Biden. Not that some reapportionment isn‚Äôt needed. It‚Äôs happening under 45‚Äôs presidency. Policing needs reform. Crime needs addressing but traditional police methods are failing. Divisions need to be overcome, not made worse. Trump makes it worse.
Wish Trump was s hoax and and the last 3ish year did happen. #TrumpHoaxedAmerica
Dawg trump banned purchases with tencent which owns Riot and Epic games... gaming community could get real nasty if he does tend to ban more than just WeChat from tencent
But you and your husband can't decide, Trump took that choice away from you and made it for you. He decided what app your kids can use, not you
Certainly not Trump.   In Thailand it's pronounced differently.  Who invented the Thai language?  In other words, we're not in England, Australia, or India.  Trump doesn't speak with any of those inflections.    In even more other words, he can't read and you're an idiot.
What do you know of truth, Trump Pumper?
Reading up on a bit of it, but I think Trump may have just slashed half of Esports away from the US based on this Tencent debacle.

Lebron had a chance to be one of the biggest human rights activist ever. Then he decided to shut up and dribble. I‚Äôm saying, take off the trump hate blinders off by not just agreeing with anyone who dislikes trump. But go lebron for saying he won‚Äôt miss trump Lolol.
To Joes handlers. There‚Äôs only one reason you‚Äôre still acting like he is an actual opponent against Trump.  You‚Äôre scared of what happened with Ukraine, Burisma, Hunter, and many other bad actors including Joe himself.  Where‚Äôd all the money go?
I don't think they care that Trump had sex with a 13 y/o and then paid her off....
Lebron is no better than trump. Take the trump hate blinders off.
Bernie didn't lose, Obama pulled the strings to engineer his loss. There's a big difference; and if we get another 4 years of Trump bc Obama chose to pull the strings in favor of the very worst candidate, it's yet another part of his dismal legacy.
Trump you‚Äôre crazy.
Trump is having memories of all the restrictors hes put on his rental properties.
Alternate version: What‚Äôs thirty feet long and has fourteen teeth? The front row at a Trump rally!
Trump is admitting he is God, for God created the earth, the oceans, rivers, lakes, and rain. People are thanking Trump for Water, because they think he is God.
Can you believe Donald Trump not being able to correctly pronounce "Yosemite"? He must've skipped a LOT of cartoons growing up, right?    (have to scroll down for the actual cartoon, near the bottom)

Yes I agree, too many people support him obviously. But we don‚Äôt need to elevate and cite this article as defacto proof of that when it‚Äôs headline is an intentionally incorrect statement. Trump loves misinformation like this, let‚Äôs not use it.
Lol we really hate Trump here.
125 million white ppl aren‚Äôt voting for trump... misleading headline (for clickbait) considering the article breaks it down more and no demo was actually at 50, and also they asked less than 3,000 ppl.
Smart. Forward thinking. Compassionate. Yes, of course he‚Äôs absolutely right. And the Trump administration will intentionally ignore his advice. üôÑüôÑ
Trump is awful in a million ways but the democrats are so wrong to criticize him for enabling racists to expose themselves. This does lead to more overt radicalization, but I've seen it happen on "both sides" and is one of the only benefits in the Trump era.

Good Grief.

I don't get why I keep seeing AnCaps praise DHS or Trump for going after Antifa, when Antifa is not who they are going after.  They are training people to see anarchists as terrorists.  They didn't declare war on Antifa, they declared war on YOU - Anarcho Capitalists. Wake up!!!

Oh and proof is out that tRump knows about the Russians paying for the assassinations of US troops tRump will NEVER take responsibility NOR HAS HE EVER TAKEN RESPONSIBILITY for things he knew would kill people or hurt people he doesn‚Äôt care about anyone but himself

Could this anti-Trump Republican group take down the president?
I believe trump supporters are in a cult that worship him this wouldn‚Äôt surprise me but hey maybe they can all go drink Lysol and bleach together and that will rid the United States of the stupid people üòÇüòÇüòÇ #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
What‚Äôs even more sad is that POS president trump didn‚Äôt even show up to John Lewis‚Äôs funeral Clinton, Obama, AND EVEN BUSH showed up! And Bush is a republicant too!

We're just not allowing them to punish my friends --- also Donald Trump
these are the equivalent of a chimp tossing its feces at zoo visitors. The reason they miss the mark is that I am not what you accuse me of, and if you read my previous tweets, you'd know I am not a Trump supporter. #asshat
Quite begging Trump for aid, when you constantly attack him. You made this bed in Michigan, you deal with it!
THANK YOU for defending us hard working ESSENTIAL WORKERS at the USPS. We work hard EVERYDAY, &amp; take great pride in our work. Mr Trump doesnt like the USPS &amp; I'm sure he will blame his loss in Nov!! Thank you again for defending us before it happens !! #USPSSTRONG
God spared Congressman Scalise‚Äôs life so he could continue to serve and yet he can sit there in Committee, with his face hanging out, and lie to the American people. Why? To protect Donald Trump.
It was politically motivated. I‚Äôll because he was a conservative and a Trump supporter. All lives matter Terrence!
Pelosi also said if Trump wins her and the Democrats are going to drag him out of the office one way or another!
Donald Trump.
Someone should create an advent calendar for the election.  It could count down the days toward the second coming of democracy. #RIPJohnLewis #Trump #Resist #COVID19 #TrumpMeltdown #ObamaWasBetterAtEverything
these shutdowns and the economic fallout were INEVITABLE. The numbers were a surprise to no one &amp; to suggest that this is all Trump's fault pretty much shows a partisan mindset that is impervious to rational analysis and is only concerned with touting one's "team"
a lot can be ascribed to Trump, but COVID lockdowns, the entire reason for the (expected) downturn, cannot be blamed on him, particularly when he is also accused of pushing to end lockdowns prematurely by those who seem to want to shut country down for the next 2 years.

"It‚Äôs clear that the president is more focused on his chances in the 2020 election than on protecting families from a virus that has killed more than 150,000 Americans." - Gov. Gretchen Whitmer
President Trump suggested on Twitter that the November election should be delayed; Gov. Whitmer says he should focus more on 'saving American lives'
I swear everything they feared a black president would do trump has and they say we ghetto
as long as you support Trump in any way, I will never vote for you. #DumpTrump2020trump just farted.
That's cool you're not voting for Trump then
Because in the world that we live in, school is going to open in the fall. Trump won't let those policies pass, therefore it's stupid to put the economy over kids and their parent's lives.
Those countries also have already existing infrastructure and much smaller general class sizes. Not to mention that even if Dems could pass it as soon as possible, Trump would still be President as Fall comes around. It makes literally zero sense unless you live in fantasy land.
Even Trump said, he knows he will get sued.
They‚Äôre going to get Trump elected... Again. That‚Äôs basically their only real purpose.
Republicans have set us back 30 years. Mitch McConnell and the Trump Administration are two of the worst things that have ever happened to this country.
China should not cave in to Trump the dictator.
China is solidly behind its business partner,Donald Trump.
His support is much stronger than his polls, that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre gonna get spanked. Democrats have rigged themselves into thinking they‚Äôve been winning this whole time. 62% of the country say they‚Äôre scared to say who they support (Trump) &amp; that doesn‚Äôt include the brave onesüß®üí•
Trump prevented nothing. By the time dimwit Donnie stopped flights from China, it was already here. 40,000 people came into the country after, many from the Wuhan district. Oh, and it been determined that the virus here came from Europe. They don't tell you that on fux noise.
Trump knows nothing about Corona virus.
A rant about how Trump pronounced it correctly
The tide appears to be turning... Trump knows Americans won‚Äôt take the long way home to avoid the bully for too long before we‚Äôll team up &amp; fight back. He‚Äôs been sizing up the situation, waiting for us to signal him we‚Äôre ready to stand up. You hear it? He does. Cheers. Finally.
This is an interesting poll, the question was will there be a vaccine, not whether you trust the Trump admin‚Äôs good faith in releasing an efficacious vaccine.
Why does it seem like the Trump campaign hired those scammers who would generate those Nigerian prince email scams to create their campaign emails?
Dump trump
What absolutely drives me nuts about this is every single person, whether you‚Äôre a Trump supporter or not, KNOWS the only reason this is happening is Trump wants to sabotage mail-in voting. It‚Äôs so fucking obvious!
I fucking hate saying this AGAIN... we‚Äôre in ANOTHER constitutional crisis. The Post Office is a constitutionally mandated institution the Trump administration is actively sabotaging in real time.

I know, at the very least hope, someone out there is making a record of all the time Trump has turned these official visits into campaign rally‚Äôs.   Whomever Biden‚Äôs AG is gonna be will be very thankful to that person.
#CuomoPrimeTime President Trump is using his Trump Card to help his Re election as President of the United States.
Thank you, IDIOT, for helping Donald Trump to get elected! #Trump2020! By-the-way, you are breaking the law!
Donald Trump can‚Äôt stand Jesus and will silence every true Christian in this Nation if given the chance. Joe Biden gives us all a voice. It‚Äôs clear. Lines have been drawn. You don‚Äôt have to like Biden, but if you want to publicly love people as Jesus commanded, then vote Biden.
So terribly sad to see what's become of this country.  True patriotism is dead.
Google it. I'm not saying who's right or wrong but she may have ulterior motives. I hate to think that but according to Google, no trump has ever served and I'd heard that before.

If you actually read the stories about this you'll see that Wheeler mentions that he's afraid that Trump will use this (the riots and attempted murder) to his advantage.  Wheeler doesn't care about the cops.  He's worried about Trump getting re-elected.

Trump and his administration are pathetic
Best president ever! God bless President Trump! God bless America
Trump is not perfect - I think he says these things to get a rise out of liberals. My brother did it to me and my father would tell me - ignore it if it is not true. You guys fall for it every time.
Actually... the CCP wants trump to lose because they want their citizens to get back to working and stop laughing all the time!
He lives the Trump playbook
Sen Debbbie Stabenow is there anyway that we can stop President Trump from stopping the postal service from continuing? I depend on the postal service to send me my bills. And if Trump stops it. There's no way i can pay them. I don't have a computer.
That's just how Trump and his idiot minions sound to people who are sane. And not sycophants. Or Republicans. Get over it, as the late, not-so-great Mick Mulvaney said.

Trump is polling fine in the Midwest. Everybody knows that New York and California will vote Democrat. But, the RustBelt states are the states that will determine the next president.
Donald J Trump you‚Äôre an idiot
If you take the perspective the Trump administration is attempting to do as much harm to the US as possible, does it make sense now?
If you don't like the VP, have a better candidate in 4 or 8 years. For now, if you don't get rid of Trump, you're no better than the rest.
See prime example of propaganda being used. He bought they they were "Trump loving christians" Thats not a Christian.
And here's Boris Johnson, Trump's BFF, saying "Thai Pongal". Guess how he pronounces it?
I'm just curious, can you give me one example of Trump governing like Hitler?
Yes my dear he most certainly is I don't know if you're old enough to remember Joe McCarthy everyone was a communist in his book and I do mean everyone. I fully expect one day to see mr. Trump institutionalized in a place for the clinically insane
Not trying to b that dude but why is trump going after fucking video game developers lol, aren‚Äôt police still killing black men and women for no good reason at all daily??? Like Jesus priorities man priorities
Let's keep our footing on solid ground. Biden is not perfect, probably no white person is when it comes to representing blacks. However, Biden is much better than Trump.
I did not realize black voters  appointed Trump as their spokesperson.

To question Trump,would be ‚Äúhurting God.‚Äù
I think that Trump should concentrate,on getting Barron‚Äôs school,up and running.
Trump is too full of himself,to ever learn a lesson.
Like his master Trump.Larry Kudlow strongly believes,in feeding the corporate greed.
So the #Trump Administration is going to sanction for them for abusing dissidents while actively abusing dissisents here worse with #secretpolice and misusing "nonlethal" weapons.  #BLM #antifa
This could be what Twitter is like when trump is gone.
Why is Trump so obsessed with taking down Tik Tok?
Just remember Mr. Trump that the Chinese companies you put tariffs on aren‚Äôt paying the tariffs the American people who purchase the goods are paying it!!! Stop the lies!! Unless that is what you believe and you are just STUPID!!!!!
So Trump signed the executive order to ban TikTok?   Good fucking luck dude, we'll just find another way to troll you. Kids these days are relentless.
Kudlow: Thats not what he said! Poppy directly quotes trump K:  haven't heard what he said.   #cnn

I would thank President Trump for all the great water pressure and spray that meteor down with a garden hose from inside my bunker.
Oh stop.  Trump has given PP millions..
Facebook is Trump's bitch. No way would he ban.
I'm following both of you Can you Please follow back üòÉ
ask  +  to Debate over the 2 hours - Sean moderates one than Laura others or do it jointly. Format -Trump answers than Biden is on video screen answers in his own Primary words to same question. Do it before first Votes
And?  This has nothing to do with that?  I‚Äôm a HUGE critic of Harbaugh and not one of these creepy, cultish, blind followers (like the some of the trump supporters). I call the guy out constantly. I said what I said tho. This wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúsnitching‚Äù.
Their defiance and Trump‚Äôs misinformation is what is crippling our economy and dragging this virus on.
What Biden said was moronic. And yet all you can do is attack someone else. Just typical fascist behavior by today‚Äôs left. I can easily admit trump is wrong about many things. Why can‚Äôt you just admit Biden is an idiot??
And the African American community will be showing the fool just how diverse they are by voting for trump in 2020 even more than they did in 2016.
If you don't have time to sit and read, I highly recommend this audiobook.  This is INSANITY! I'm listening to "Alt-America: The Rise of the Radical Right in the Age of Trump" on Scribd (I believe they have a 30 day free trial!!!) Check it out:
Biden hasn't been the president yet. Why don't you compare Trump to President Obama?
The dems who matter, politicians, like trump. They just can‚Äôt admit it. He‚Äôs winning by a landslide
I will do whatever is necessary to vote Biden in And Trump OUT!
So Trump really banning tiktok üôÑ
Every headline should start "Due to Trump's inept, failed and non-existent response to covid.. "  Please and thank you.

I suppose but are there really that many and I think they would just tie it in with the trump stuff so that's not going to go away
Seeing all these progressives just going along with this Biden isn‚Äôt it but we just gotta do it in order to get Trump where the fuck is the fight in that where are the demands you all are just falling in line and giving Biden a pass you all aren‚Äôt even holding his feet to the üî•

Where did anyone say it is Trump‚Äôs fault Michelle Obama is experiencing depression?
I don‚Äôt like calling people stupid, but the VP is just ONE cabinet position. It‚Äôs important yes, but any person choosing a Trump cabinet over a Biden cabinet is a straight up idiot and, at the very least imo, a fascist enabler.
Sure he has, after he saw Trump's welcome to the Whirlpool rally!!!
So I HAD to go see this comment. I didn't want to stir the pot but desperately want to know what she and her ilk think Trump has actually done to stop trafficking. It's seriously scary and sad.
Spotify as well. Literally just google "Tencent" + Any tech/entertainment company you can think of. there is a VERY high chance Tencent has ownership in that company and that company is fucked by this EO Trump has signed.
trump and the repugs are committing genocide by their actions in not following the recommendation of scientists.
It sucks, but don't vote third party because then Trump will win again üôÉ
I'm not a fan of Trump either...twinkle toes.
Yeah to vote the anti God Trump OUT. you can't preach faith and cheat your way through everything and on everyone.
Kanye West is a sellout and a disgrace of a black man if he allows Trump to prostitute him to steer democratic votes from Joe Biden.  A black man who tries to sabotage black progress is an Uncle Tom, and any black person that votes for him is a fool.
Today, Trump puts ban on #TicTok  Yesterday, #Instagram introduces its TicTok knock-off ‚ÄúReels‚Äù   Can‚Äôt tell me #Zuckerberg ain‚Äôt down with the Trump-wagon

I used to think the "Trump Derangement Syndrome" was just a cheap way to deflect valid criticism but on reflection it's pretty obvious that ppl often stop thinking and say really dumb shit when they've made up their mind the person they're talking about is wrong/evil
I truly want to believe that this won‚Äôt be like Trump saying he‚Äôll have a new health care plan in 2 weeks.
Totally agree! I would have thrown in the towel and dumped it all in Biden and Pelosi‚Äôs laps. He loves America too much. He is a natural leader! Besides, his ego would not allow him to do that. TRUMP 2020!!!
They always swallow for Trump
For one, everything you just said is a lie. For 2, everything you say from now on will probably be a lie. For 3, you can't handle someone who actually knew her job a actually protected the U.S. with no thought about right, left or in between. Trump humpers only protect Covidiot45

Donald Trump,is an anti First Amendment,anti catholic bigot,who spends his Sunday‚Äôs,on one of his golf courses.
Just let them fade away. That's what Trump would love, that after he is gone they'll still be calling his name.
Donald and Ivanka Trump,happily drove their workers,to China.
The Trump‚Äôs did even more.They took their jobs to low wage,authoritarian,Communist China..
Well, if that‚Äôs the issue you must vote for Trump. Absolutely.
Fake news Trump says that catholics are against God.
By entering into and maintaining, a business relationship with China.Donald Trump shows that China is number 1 to him.
I can‚Äôt believe people can‚Äôt see what Trumpism is. People, Trump is a huge threat, Trumpism will wash over the world and end it.
By attacking Joe Biden for his Catholic faith.Donald Trump has shown himself,for the hateful,divisive   Bigot,that he is .
It makes no sense that they won't i agree Mr trump.

First DeJoy was not appointed by Trump, the Post Master is elected by The Governors of The Board  in which there are 11. Governors are appointed by different Presidents.
How about the economic and health crisis facing the American people? Instead of focusing on the impact on Trump, try looking at what's happening to the sick and the high-risk. This is a story about them, not him.
Trump is already hurting,the GOP.
Creepy Donald Trump,claims to be a ‚Äústable genius‚Äù yet offers no proof of this.If Trump  was an academic whiz,he‚Äôd be showing off his scholastic accomplishments,onFox news,for all the world to see.
everything they blame you for they are doing and getting away with it! It is making alot of us Americans sick to our stomach we support you trump .trump2020
The joke is trump pronounced Thailand as Thighland.
It honestly disgusting how Joe is acting and the way they are hiding is inability to even have a conversation a out trump. Do us a favor and vote trump save us from utter chaos.
Dr Trump is at it again ?
So now Trump thinks he‚Äôs God ?
Donald Trump disparages Biden‚Äôs school records,while hiding his academic ,‚Äùaccomplishments‚Äù from sight.
When COVID came calling.Donald Trump was asleep on the job.
This tweet is a direct violation of the Hatch Act, not that the Trump adminstration believes rules and laws apply to them.
Fuck Donald Trump for his anti-news rhetoric. This dude has absolutely decimated legit credibility with none other than false hysteria. Damn you, Mr. President.
Keep in mind these are the same guys that hacked chinese flag makers data to predict Trump to win in 2016.
You might wanna double check that. No member of Trump's immediate family has EVER served in the military. I would think his brother would be considered immediate family.
If Trump really cared about American workers.He would‚Äôve brought his manufacturing jobs,back from China,long ago.
Trump will punish anyone,he perceives as being an enemy.
Well Trump should order them to open it up!  It's almost as if he doesn't care about his children at all!
There are a lot of gross people in the Trump administration that I‚Äôm excited to never hear from again. The Schlapps are up there.
You know if they really wanted Biden to debate Trump they would at least do some kind of Zoom Debate.
His work is not intended to help trump.  It may be an unintended consequence but that is not his fault.  He has not lied or exaggerated the truth since I‚Äôve followed him.  If you dislike him you will hate me. My ballot will be blood red top to bottom.  I hate centrists.
Just wait till you are voted out!!! You are NEXT!!! ‚Äú NY Attorney General files law suits on Donald J Trump ex president‚Äù ‚ÄúNY DA files suit on Trump CO, Trump family and Trump Campaign ‚Äú

You might want to look in the mirror A vote for trump is a vote against the constitution
Pencil me in for a trump vote then.

My dumb ass voted Hillary.  I thought for sure she would win.   I was wrong.  I‚Äôm voting trump this year.  Biden is to far right for my vote. Trump is a protest vote.  If he wins he could completely destroy so many corporate creations. Need to nominate a real Dem in 24.
That would be great but it isn‚Äôt going to happen.  Voting to just not have trump is a waste of time.  It‚Äôs like a battered wife staying with the husband who beats her.  I‚Äôm out.  This shitty party has wasted enough of my time.  But good luck. Hope it works out for you.

Not sure why everyone‚Äôs so surprised. The only reason people ever thought Trump was racist is because the media decided that would be good for Democrats.
If I lived through Joe Biden voting with Republicans from 1973-2009 to make himself wealthy and screw the working class...... you can make another 4 years of trump.
Ms. McCain, I admired your dad. However, after this with President Trump, I will never vote for another Republican ever again.

The lawsuit against the NRA has nothing to do with the 2nd Amendment, and everything to do with the fraud they were allegedly perpetuating, just like Trump Foundation and Trump University. Even the NRA is not above the rule of law!  But donny dip shit spins it to divide the ppl.

Im sorry I can‚Äôt support this we deserve better than this. Trump must be taken out but so does the majority of the Republican party and the Dems who have enabled him.
Honestly in the Settle with Biden and this Vote Trump Out shit bothers me why are progressives doing the work for him when he and his campaign should be doing the work.
I would vote for a Twitter Bot over Trump.
Do you have proof the ballots are illegal or are you just repeating Trump?  Just because an application is sent to a deceased person doesn‚Äôt mean they got a ballot. I‚Äôm glad we voted so everyone will have a means to vote without being disinfranchised.

We‚Äôre talking about Trump, so to him I‚Äôm sure ‚Äúeviction protections‚Äù means protecting landlords from being litigated for mass evictions.
Make sure he gives trump a big fat kiss.
We‚Äôre talking about people who elevated Donald Trump as their fascist figurehead, these people are detached from reality.
All good questions. I also heard that people didn't fill it out because Trump or Biden wasn't on it. Lots of voters are in the habit of ignoring primaries or misunderstanding them.
Trump‚Äôs constant lying,is disrespectful,to the flag,and to the troops who have fought bravely,to protect it.
I bet you every threat came from Trump supporters. I guarantee it. You have Trump's leadership or lack thereof to thank for that.
That's code for black people living in inner cities. One thing Trump knows is at least 50% of his voters are on some level racist and loyal to him. I guarantee he can call black people the N word on national TV and won't lose one vote. In fact, he might even gain a few votes.
Posting Fuck Donald Trump isn‚Äôt stopping that fucking nightmarish piece of shit there needs to be a plan to hold his ass accountable I am not seeing any of these settle with Biden people talking about they just believe that if we get him out shit is just going to stop being
Right. This is the guy I'm assuming knows everything trump does he has to. It's baffling to me nobody has questioned him on his knowledge. They keep going after the big fish that they can't catch maybe if some others start feeling the heat they'll change their tune.
"More people will die if Donald Trump is elected president than if we delay the vaccine for 4 weeks." Someone will absolutely say this on TV.
I don‚Äôt think anybody is advising him I think they are just letting him do whatever he wants. The campaign seems to not care their whole thing is we got to get Trump out vote for Biden cause he‚Äôs not Trump and that should be good enough it‚Äôs all very entitled and out of touch.
Yes I would . You should too. Unless you‚Äôre all talk about Trump. That‚Äôs the problem. People have gotten lazey.
‚ÄúThe Biden campaign surge in fundraising the past couple of months has helped it narrow the Trump campaign‚Äôs once-massive cash on hand advantage.‚Äù  Could have just thanked Black Lives Matter donations instead of general ‚ÄúGrassroots donors‚Äù, Joe.   I wish that $$ went to the ppl!
Ummm No Trump 2020

Being Trump's enemy might not be fatal but being his friend? That invites disaster.    The man has no loyalties. He can't have a dog because no dog would have him.

When I c a big Pharma ad against u I think ‚ÄúThank U Grandma 4  being so smart &amp; strong,instilling in me at a young age the ability to recognize people like Trump for the racist,sexist, misogynistic,crooked,lying conman he is&amp;not 2b blinded by their money&amp;power.‚ÄùShe despised him.
They are both nearly equally terrible, obviously Trump is worse for human rights. But they're both pedos and in Trumps case a definite rapist. Biden could be as well we just don't know yet. And Biden is a huge unknown, he could be worse than we even imagined if he wins.
Yeah, I totally get that get that. And Trump is definitely a worse person than Biden, my tweet was mostly just referring to the fact that IF we had Trump another 4 years at least we'd be done with him after that.
Notice Trump never tweets about your interviews
That's not how I feel, I was just making a statement. I definitely don't prefer Trump to Biden.............. And I wasn't 100% serious about the Bernie tweet. It's Twitter.......  I really have no idea what to do so don't judge based on two tweets.
Find a new doc that didn‚Äôt get his degree from Jackass University oh sorry I meant Trump U wait that‚Äôs the same school üôÑ
So vote Trump out by giving Biden the nomination even though he did not deserve it and then make demands after he is elected as if Biden as if he is going to do anything what is this shit.
Biden won‚Äôt even debate or be at the convention. I hate Trump I think he is garbage but how is doing the work for Biden and his campaign going to push him to the left Biden keeps being given everything he also keeps getting free passes for barely doing nothing.

Not very many &amp; the media doesn‚Äôt help at all. How many people do you hear blaming Trump for every Covid death. The media knows nobody really pays attention so they keep repeating their lies to convince them.
Have you always wanted one of our ICONIC Make America Great Again Hats?  Well, you‚Äôre in luck. President Trump just hand-signed one of them and, because you‚Äôve always been one of his best supporters, he specifically requested that it go to YOU.
I‚Äôm following could use more Trump voters!
He‚Äôs a bold &amp; successful business man which makes him easy to attack but, he‚Äôs done way more for people in this country than I ever have. More than most. He‚Äôs got our interests in mind w/protecting our rights &amp; freedoms. Trump gets rid of dumb rules instead of making them. DT2020
are master trolls. They live rent free in Trump's head.
At least don‚Äôt vote at all. You can‚Äôt really want Biden. 40yr career politician who‚Äôs never actually helped anyone but himself unless it was a coincidence. So crooked he can‚Äôt talk straight anymore &amp; There‚Äôs videos of him being ‚Äústrange‚Äù w/kids. Trump‚Äôs gotten really bad press.
#Trump is doing a great job!  has a pandemic and other problems to deal with. As Americans we must band together and stop the problems. We can do it. I don't believe only 20% are satisfied. They must have only polled Californians. #MAGA2020
I‚Äôm ruined. This is now the only way I can handle listening to Trump.
You're are absolutely 100% correct. Only Trump could screw up this bad.
You should accept the nomination at the Trump Tower in NYC.  You and Melania can come down the escalator to accept the nomination.  That will shut all of the liberals up!  Mike drop!
Trump keeps changing reason on against vote by mail. Some time ago he claimed he would prob lose if vote by mail. Now he claims fraud. Stop the insanity. Choose  health/death vs not voting. Trump will go anything to win-legal or not. Must be stopped.
Trump excuse changing  over yrs. Sometime ago-- vote by mail could cause more voters to vote against him. Now he is using ruse vote by mail fraud. He just want to disenfranchise voters. Do it make choice health/death vs vote. Stop the insanity!!
Got to d o something. Floated long before now Trump has contended that vote by mail could vote him out of office-more voter voting against him. Now contends voting fraud. Choose between  health/death or right to vote. Trump/Rep's most be stopped!

Trump pushed the FCC to make social media companies responsible for user content and misinformation (fake news). Now Twitter is censoring Trump‚Äôs tweets for being fake news. It‚Äôs a total leopardsatemyface moment
Also, like, *waves at Trump's twitter feed* it clearly won't.
Does anyone know what the tweet actually said that Trump posted?
Well, Trump‚Äôs just not that smart. Plain and simple. üá∫üá∏ #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
I'm sure Trump said to do that too.
First of all they weren't RIOTS.. they were LEGAL PROTESTS. THE ONLY PEOPLE STARTING FIRES AND BREAKING WINDOWS WERE TRUMP'S WHITE SUPREMACISTS THAT HE PAID! GEORGE FLOYD SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN MURDERED BY THE RACIST COPS. HENCE THE PROTESTS!  WE'RE DONE WITH TRUMP!
So then what is it, exactly? That Obama spied on Trump? Do you have any clue what happened? Its just another republican conspiracy, just like the emails and Benghazi ... a big nothingburger.
Some people will just stay home with more chaos..just what Trump wants
He's just trying to help trump.  Kanye is certainly not qualified  Like trump, he's got serious mental issues and not qualified. This is a rediculous plot to steal DEMOCRAT votes

And it dies in the Senate, along with the other 300+ Bills. Do you happen to have an exact count on the legislation the Senate sat on since Trump took over?
problem described here isn‚Äôt minority rule. The problem is that one branch has become the All Powerful Oz.  Also, of course Trump shouldn‚Äôt care about the national vote. Neither should Biden. Had Hillary won it would‚Äôve been minority rule too, just less spaced out geographically
And they said Trump supporters were deplorables. üôÑü§¢ü§Æ

So I‚Äôm going with the better option
Well their you go, like I said, when trump says gonna go something he damn well will do it!
I hope you‚Äôre talking about Trump.
Sure he is, he‚Äôs the one that‚Äôs actually keeping shit in check, unlike Obama where he practically separated us as a hole &amp; didn‚Äôt do nothing for this country, except for maybe one thing. He gave a list &amp; never completed it, trump gives a list, he‚Äôs done 9/10 things on that list
Who is to blame? If you are to take a glance at my account, you‚Äôll have a very sure guess. It is the Trump followers. The Covid-deniers. The anti-maskers. The ‚ÄúLETS FUCKING PARTY BECAUSE WE CAN‚Äù-ers. All one group of people. You (anti-maskers) may see this as standing up to‚Äî‚Äî

Their would‚Äôve been way more if he haven‚Äôt done what he did, it‚Äôs a virus it‚Äôs not gonna go away, it‚Äôs here to stay, quit blaming trump for things like the virus that he can‚Äôt control over or have control over it.

Thank you for this. Biden is a man whose faith has been tested through his life and has found solace,peace and strength in his Catholicism.  There are no words to describe how immoral Trump is but craven and despicable come to mind.

I was wrong. Nothing exciting from Tish so far. Just transportation regarding NY. It will take more time to investigate Deutschebank and Trump. But she will get it done in time. I was overly optimistic. Lots of documents to review. Don‚Äôt give up. Kodak is next problem.
HOWEVER, some people asked whether this could be due to the red states ramping up testing (i.e., Trump's "more tests = more cases!" logic). It's true that this would at least make it *look* like there were "more" cases.  So I decided to check.
Bro told Trump 1000 Americans are dying a day. Trump said ‚ÄúIt is what it is‚Äù üò≠
thei facts and let Trump defend them.
lied. Florida has history od bad voting tallies. But Florida has a GOP Governor. A good interview would have pointed this out to Trump. And Trump has voted by mail in Florida and NY. One good interview is not enough. Press needs to hit back these lies. Reporters have to state
Everyone is excited about the Swan interview which was excellent. Yet Trump said voting by mail in Florida is safe and they have a great Governor and Senator. No reporter countered. They are both corrupt. The corona deaths are false. He shut down too late. Deaths rising. They l
Duh... Turns out now there was no info Trump was either... False pretenses only.
So what I hear u saying is that Trump's ad excites u more than Bidens politics???  Same here
Criminal.  Period. Thanks for running experiment with Georgia's kids.  Anything for Trump, no matter how many more you kill. Leader???
#1 is simple enough to check on...see their work product. If they‚Äôre doing good work to hurt Trump/GOP and help Biden/Dems, it shows. So far most of their ads/videos have been decent to excellent. Think  is getting rich off of it? Beats me, but I doubt it.
More than that, he's also stressing that he wants ALL the Trump-enabling GOP electeds (i.e., like 90% of them) to be kicked out on their asses, not just him.
It's important  to note this doesn't mean they're suddenly gonna fall in love with M4All/etc. It *does* mean they recognize that the only way to flush out Trump/Trumpism is to accept a few years of full Dem control. If that's the price they're willing to pay, I respect it.
Good point about the election. Maybe you could do a segment about Biden versus Trump stocks? Certainly energy up Trump down Biden.
I‚Äôll be incorporating the blue/red ratio into my daily updates going forward. It sucks that we even have to think about it in these terms but Trump has given us no choice. State and national POLICY is being based on it.

You keep calling him a "Never Trumper" even though he's literally volunteered his time (something most elected officials don't do) to get Trump elected in 2016. Im curious why you think he doesn't support the President.

Florida has had two or more terrible Governors. Just because Trump says someone is great doesn‚Äôt make it so. More propaganda. Absentee ballots and mail-in are the same and encourage voting which is a good think. Fraud is virtually non-existent. He needs to discredit the results.
Biden isn't hiding he just doesn't have to say anything to show his superiority over Trump......Trump does that for him

These idiots can't defend Trump and the federal government response to Covid in the slightest, so they blame the governors.  It would be like blaming Rudy Giuliani for 9/11 happening.  Truly mind blowing.
I forgot. Trump carries his own Bible around with him. Just in case!
Trump said he didn‚Äôt know John Lewis. But John Lewis didn‚Äôt attend his inauguration. So if he didn‚Äôt know him. How did he know if he didn‚Äôt attend? Trump knew who John Lewis was. He lies so often.  He doesn‚Äôt know the truth from a lie.
Hey trump team...I think it‚Äôs safe to say it‚Äôs time to put the ‚ÄúBiden is losing his marbles‚Äù bit in the trash....
Putin is pulling his strings. He is owning Trump, and will do what he can to destabilize us by making truth impossible to discern.  We need Russian experts to join Biden camp

I like this proposal Joe. Keep it up, work hard, and you might be able to get a job as an assistant, associate, vice copy boy in the next Trump administration. Not!
Trump‚Äôs answers are all lies. He lies as easily as he breathes and I wish he would stop. Cin-cin.
If you can actually read. Try the Mueller Report. It requires intelligence. No witch-hunt. No hoax. Russians. Collusion. Indictments. Obstruction. Trump was impeached. Remember.
If mail-in voting is fraudulent. Maybe Trump lost the 2016 election.
Doesn‚Äôt anyone understand that Trump is not a capable President nor a medical doctor. He should never be giving medical advice. His ego is beyond belief. He excels at nothing except BS.
Well... when referring to #COVID19, Mr. #Trump also said things like ‚Äî&gt;
Trump knows more about TikTok than Hydroxychloroquine.
That may be an exaggeration...I just mean that he's one of just 2 Dem incumbents up for re-election in a state won by Trump and he's been outraised by his opponent. That doesn't mean he's "at risk", just more so than, say, Dick Durbin or Jeff Merkley.
The sooner he picks one, the sooner the Trump managers make an attack plan. Take your time Joe, I for one will STILL vote for you no matter who you pick üëçüèΩ
I blame the Trump admin for not being prepared and denying it's existence. I blame them for promoting early reopenings which caused even more unnecessary death.  He failed.  I am absolutely positive if Clinton was president (or Biden), there would be many fewer deaths from Covid.

Rep. Clyburn: Trump won't leave White House if he loses the election
True, but it's also about HOW they're likely to vote. Trump is assuming that Dems are more likely to vote absentee/by mail because we're (rightly) scared of COVID, while Trump voters are more likely to vote in person since they think it's a hoax/etc.

I am concerned they‚Äôve lost more than their minds. When you consider the religious fervor, evangelistic zeal, and the completely unironic way Trump is spoken of as God‚Äôs anointed, I believe it is a cult that corrupts Christian Faith. They need prayers for deliverance.
Social security is your money and you saved it without interest. It‚Äôs not republicans money to give. If Trump comes, they will chop your social security.

well. Trump and Mitch outplayed the better lawyers. You needed a much stronger Mueller. Witnesses. And 2/3. You made some ofvthese points but not enough in your book. In a real trial. You may have prevailed. Trump belongs in jail. Voters need to oust Trump. Pelosi was of no help.
Barr was a major obstacle. Unprepared to counter him or Trump‚Äôs claim of exoneration. You and Barry and Dems did great trial work but lost. You had no chance. And no witnesses in Senate. You treated this as if it would be a fair trial. It wasn‚Äôt. If waited for quid pro quo to

Republican's and Trump's boss.
Trump pulled an inside straight draw and barely won the election and governed like he had a mandate like Reagan 84.  Trump is going to lose in a landslide to Biden.
After 3 1/2 years I can't believe anyone is still gullible enough to fall for this shit. I believe this will happen as much as I believe Trump's "fantastic healthcare plan" will be "signed" tomorrow morning (he has 8 hours to go to meet his latest "2 weeks" promise).

'Trump blithely remarked, ‚ÄúOne day, it‚Äôs like a miracle, it will disappear.‚Äù He had in mind, of course, the #coronavirus, but, as others have said, he might just as well have been referring to the #Americandream.'
Correct! You can‚Äôt just go into a powerful position Willy Nilly about the law. Mr. Trump is lost in the fog. Just an opinion/observation.
Yes! I say Donald Trump take a polygraph.
Ruling means ‚ÄúTrump could sit for deposition[] under oath in the coming months.‚Äù
Holding: The U.S. Constitution‚Äôs Supremacy Clause does not bar a state court from exercising jurisdiction over a sitting President of the United States during his term.
"I came to the U.S. for free access to information. I feel I‚Äôm targeted by Trump" WeChat operates under Chinese law, is used by the Chinese government for mass surveillance. How's that "free access to info"? There's a reason it's allowed to operate in China &amp; alternatives aren't.
Trump pardoned him for Kanya West!
Or what? You'll vote for Trump?
Yep. It's perfectly consistent with the fucked up values of Trump voters and Evangelical Christians. There's death and destruction all around us. But as soon as somebody shows a little skin...

Trump already spent (pre-COVID) $60 billion on farmers, most of them corporate.  Are farmers just in blue states?

I've always thought that compared to Trump, Pence comes off as a kissass. I don't believe he would win in 2024 if he did choose to run.  That said, I'm also not on board with Don Jr running, as I don't like the idea of creating another presidential dynasty.
You have failed us in ever way possible we should not exspect any concern for people local units will be laying off first responders and others contributing to the trump depression
Argument: Trump will leave a mess and if Biden wins, GOP will blame mess on Biden and GOP will hammer dems and field ultra-right ticket in response.   My response: Dumb to suggest this is a Biden problem because it would also be Bernie problem if he were candidate.
Trump is Hitler in disguise
God forbid if trump has to talk about Niger
Republicans are in the process of banning all abortions. And if Trump "wins," they will succeed.
TurtleConnell has decided it will look better to voters if the GOP doesn't negotiate &amp; Trump signs an Executive Order. They want him portrayed as a last minute hero.This could have been done TWO months ago so don't hit me with that BS!  Also, we are IN this mess because of Trump.
These stories should make it perfectly clear that the only reason USPS is slow now is because Trump and Senate Republicans want it to be.
Weird how little attention it's getting that Trump's DHS, which doesn't have a Constitutionally approved head, is denying new DACA applications in defiance of the Supreme Court. This is a constitutional crisis that's a test run for much worse things.
Then Trump can say, " Hey I tested positive, too! We can quarantine together on the debate stage!"
Trump happened. ‚òπÔ∏è

Hopefully, Trump is not for his election speaks so many pretty words. Otherwise our country should be the next Venezuela üáªüá™. The Chinese Community Party has no credit at all. They are the biggest Terrorist Organization in the world!
‚ÄúWhen Donald Trump took office he announced that the US would leave the Paris agreement. On the one issue that demands a worldwide response to help safeguard the Earth for future generations, the US has chosen to walk away.‚Äù  We literally can‚Äôt afford another 4 years. #VoteBlue
Experiencing Michigan in Trump country. Wearing a mask feels like a protest üòÅ but the outdoors are pretty
Is America better off today under Donald Trump's leadership than 4 years ago under Barack Obama?
I get a ton of Trump ads on YouTube in SE Michigan. Other than that they‚Äôve completely stopped on Hulu and cable for me
More disappointing is that 6 weeks ago it was reported that Putin through the GRU had placed bounties on the heads of American Soldiers and bounties have been paid. We found out Trump's administration knew in Feb. Not one statement from Trump. Not one word.
The problem isn‚Äôt the rank hypocrisy of Trump not knowing the Bible from Adam, the problem is that he brought religion into politics. It‚Äôs not funny, it‚Äôs an attack on American democratic norms and religious freedom.
Trump had just become a ‚Äòjoke‚Äô. Unfortunately, the joke‚Äòs on us.
Hmm... Trump wants to ban TikTok just a few weeks after teen users pranked him and screwed up the attendance expectations at his Tulsa rally. Coincidence? How short does he think our memories are?
The comments in here are hilarious someone was like ‚ÄúCHINA IF YOU‚ÄôRE LISTENING reveal Trump‚Äôs tax returns!‚Äù ü§£
Fuck trump, fuck racists, fuck rapists, fuck 2020. I‚Äôm fucking over it
More like burn in hell Trump!!!
U.S. Intelligence Warns China Opposes Trump Reelection, Russia Works Against Biden
What a dilemma the Russian are campaigning for Trump the Chinese against Trump. No wonder Trump is so upset with China and he claimed it was about Hong Kong. The GOP is rooting for Russia Putin bounties and all. Sure glad we solved the issue of foreign governments interfering
Stimulus talks just now broke down. Munching says he‚Äôll advise Trump to take executive action. This ought to be a riot!
Aye,, Trump is tying to get rid of payroll tax! Thats big fire!!!!
No it was playing on you can‚Äôt run for president if you‚Äôre not born here, and Trump was against Obama‚Äôs policies so he pushed the myth Obama was born somewhere else. Race not needed.
‚ÄúWe assess that Russia is using a range of measures to primarily denigrate former vice president Biden and what it sees as an anti-Russia ‚Äòestablishment.‚Äô‚Äù
Canadians are welcome in the US. Americans are NOT welcome in Canada. Why? Donald Trump's continued alliance with a virus.
So if Obama was white and trump did the same thing it wouldn‚Äôt be racist? Don‚Äôt treat individuals differently based on their skin color. Don‚Äôt want people to think you‚Äôre being racist or anything.
Florida is getting ready to be the last hill Trump can fight on. He now lives there. Losing would be inconceivable. Get ready ro rumble, folks. It‚Äôs going to be bloody.

i just can‚Äôt articulate how annoyed i get when i see someone supporting trump when they‚Äôve literally never had to handle money in their lives like congrats you get college paid for by your parents?
Why would trump push prison reform if he was racist? Why was he friends with Muhammad Ali? Why wasn‚Äôt he accused of being racist before running for office? It‚Äôs all political. Actions speak louder than words and trump hasn‚Äôt discriminated against any race while in office.
I want to defeat President Trump.
Pathological liars I doubt they have mentioned it trump says it is a Russian story like all the rest he is right and they are all true Putin owns trump

This might be obvious from the github page, but I couldn't see it. Do you have a 2016 E-Day probability for (Clinton Pop Vote &amp; Trump Electoral College)?  I think that's probably the best single number measure of the different models.
Donald Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúit is what it is‚Äù is a testament to the complacency many Americans have had for political and human rights issues we face in our country. We stopped striving for a more perfect union and have now settled for mediocrity instead.
You lose credibility when you call Trump a racist. Both bushs weren‚Äôt racists either. HW nominated Clarence Thomas to the SC. So racist he put a Black man at the highest court position in the land.
Is ‚Äúthe mask debate complex?‚Äù Elaborate in the comments. From:
You quit it right now or Trump will have to find some other way to reward you.
The Republicans and Democrats are nowhere close to a deal and Donald Trump is golfing at one of his clubs. The great goddamned "deal maker" is golfing as Americans are being FUCKED by his party. The DEM HOUSE passed a bill 2 1/2 months ago with NO ACTION on it by the GOP SENATE.
This crap wall is so analgous to the crappy Trump Administration. Everything he touches breaks down, goes bankrupt, or turns to sh*t. #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
"The #Trump administration is all bark and no bite on drug pricing," said  director of Washington #healthcare policy at  "And despite the barks getting louder with executive orders, the bite is no harder." #news #politics #ExecutiveOrder
One reason Trump struggles to define his second term goals is because he's running out of things to destroy.

#boycottKimandKanye #BOYCOTTKANYEKARDASHIAN are my favorite HASHTAGS.  You want to stay at the level you're at?  You need to get your husband to stop this madness.  People are suffering out here under Trump. Get your shit together! No one gives a fuck about emojis rn!
Russia paid bounties for killing American troops and Donald Trump ignored it, was told a second time, never responded to it and it never really became a scandal. That's how fucked up this country is.
Maybe you didn't care when Trump made fun of war heroes or people with disabilities, talked about grabbing women by their genitals, chucked rolls of paper towels at hurricane victims or continuously acts like a jackass every time he opens his mouth...
Estimate: 3 out of 4 in US joke about Magats believing Trump. 1 of 4 wonder if he's right. 1/2 of that 1/4 (1/8) listens 2 a little voice saying "don't be an ass!" The other 1/8 drinks it &amp; 1/2 die! So, 1 of 16 MAGATs die from Trumps advice? That's terrifying! (As is my mathüò†)

If they want I am sure trump will assist them he is owned by the Saudis
It is a small number of people out of millions.. AND if people are that upset, maybe listen to why they are upset, no? That is like me saying every single Trump supporter is racist.   How can a minister think that Trump is the best president of all time by the way? ü§£
Just shut up, please. It's bad enough we have to deal with Trump's daily onslaught of falsehoods. We don't need you chiming in with your litany of lies.
These sentiments are absolutely *not* "very rare for a democrat." You must have them confused with Donald Trump. Pay attention, why don't you?
If all of the above is true why did Pelosi refuse 2 compromise?SHE Despises TRUMP so she wants to continue the $600 unemployment/people make more $ then when they worked.Businesses can‚Äôt get workers, the economy tanks,Trump ifired,Pelosi is happy,could care about sm businesses
Saying, "I'm feeling depressed about [insert anything Trump has done to hurt someone]" is not claiming you have a medical condition that needs treatment. It doesn't deserve to be criticized as if you're stigmatizing those with clinical depression. Others should grow up.
No political demographic has done in to the extent of Trump‚Äôs followers. No other groups of conservatives or liberals have been this willfully ignorant.
Court rules that House has standing to enforce McGahn subpoena, but once again, Trump wins by losing. Case is remanded for further proceedings, causing further delay. Trump‚Äôs bad faith stall game needs to be called out and the rules changed to defeat it.
Dear lord!  I am so sorry.  Trump and company need to fry for this!!!!!!!

Nope  ‚ÄúNever Trump‚Äù means ‚ÄúAlways Idiotic‚Äù!
Wait...they're using the shitty antigen tests around Trump? Heh. Well, at least Mike DeWine didn't have to lower himself to greet Trump in Ohio. Congrats.
How much we'll be respected when we have 350K or more dead Americans and Donald Trump steals another election. Remember when everyone thought we were overstating how bad Trump would be? When we said he stole the election? You do? Well, fuck you.
It amazes me how Trump groupies will literally attack minor semantics of an arguement rather then opening a book, believing in science, or listening to things like facts. He is so effective if creating a mindless base that will just agree with his ideology regardless of impact.
This. If you listened to talk radio in the 90s, you know *exactly* where Trump came from.
Suddenly, because of a news anchor mistype, Obama's the real candidate. A switch from last month when supposedly Obama wasn't saying shit to help Joe Biden. Go on. Say it's Obama's 3rd term. See what that does for coward Trump, who wouldn't run against Obama when he could have.

Undecided are people who maybe have seen what Biden‚Äôs been up to and that the third run doesn‚Äôt wash the stink off.  I hate Biden but despise Trump so it‚Äôs a real emotional roller coaster until November.
My point is conservatism does not equate to anti-lgbt or racist despite what the media tries to push. Caitlyn Jenner is pro Trump so according to your logic she is against lgbt rights for who she associates with?
No... it‚Äôs money given to republicans that hate trump. The moment this is over, they will be making those commercials about taking away our reproductive rights and health care. Send the money to dem candidates
Oh, I wouldn‚Äôt wait in line for 8 hours to vote Biden IN.  He‚Äôs easily the worst D candidate of my lifetime, and I‚Äôm counting Geoffrey Fieger for governor of Michigan.  But to vote Trump OUT?  I‚Äôd wait as long as it took.
Can't even talk about it-SO ANGRY!  The KarJenners are another mob outfit like the Trumps. I don't know what is wrong with Kanye West, but this is unforgivable. Does he not understand how many Americans are suffering under Trump? Does he not realize how many Black Americans are?
Every time Obama signed an executive order, Republicans blew up. Obama has issued just over 100 in his first 4 years. Trump has already issued 177. It's like McConnell is intentionally preventing Congress from passing bills so Trump can be a king.
Ummmmmm, Mr. Trump when you are trying to suppress the black vote try to be a little more slick next time. Your desperation is apparent.
You see, caring about the rule of law is why Trump was elected. The democrat party left ME back in the early 90s.
It does until 2024 unless another Trump runs...you RINO.
Trump pretends Biden is tired and has dementia by manipulating photos of Biden PRAYING and then goes out and says Biden is "against God" and will "hurt God". Donald Trump is lucky his Christian supporters are dumb as fuck. And that's not by accident.
And with unemployment at a post-war high, and most of the emergency income support having just expired, Congress can't get anything done, and they've all left town.  They've agreed to touch base by phone to see whether it's worth continuing negotiations.
I don‚Äôt know. What is Trump at? Let‚Äôs use that as our baseline, and Biden will never catch up.
Only way Trump would be silent from saying ignorant BS is if he was choking on fast food. We just haven‚Äôt seen his latest incoherent ignorant rants yet
Trump, the greatest liar ever, cites Fake News spreading via TikTok as part of the reason for banning it in 45 days. Once he gets away with this, why shouldn't other platforms be next if they allow content that criticizes him?
I bet the Governor is happy he did not have to put up with trump for a day
I won't say that pretending Trump purposely mispronounced Thailand is a dry run for backing him when he refuses to accept a loss in November. But it's a good example of what it will look like.
Facebook is bad.
The truth behind Trump‚Äôs bluster. Yet more evidence of his ignorance.
In Hindu tradition, it is considered a desecration of the dead‚Äôs soul to wait for cremation for more than a day or two. Let alone months. If you are a Hindu living in America and a loved one dies, tough shit. Thanks Trump.
Trump bringing god into his political attacks on Biden is more than just rank hypocrisy, it‚Äôs yet another dangerous attack on the bedrock principles of American democracy. That alone would be enough to forever disqualify him in my book.
Why don't all non-US companies have to comply with US audit requirements to be listed on US exchanges?
Facebook is bad.
So tired of trolls &amp; misinformation. Can we just have rational debate please? "The foreign pro-Trump troll farm was based in Romania and pushed content on Instagram under names like 'BlackPeopleVoteForTrump' and on Facebook under 'We Love Our President.'‚Äù
Based on Trump‚Äôs Axios performance, I am now thinking that his aides won‚Äôt want HIM to debate Biden!!!
It‚Äôs all about keeping out brown people and possible Dems. Expect it to continue.  The Trump administration imposes yet another arbitrary, absurd modification to the immigration system

Suppose Trump is doing Putin‚Äôs bidding. 1. Don‚Äôt react to Covid- creating economic disaster, fear &amp; unrest 2. Undermine nato Europe falls 3. Destroy trust in U.S. removed from the world stage 4. End of trade treaties crushing economic growth. Nah never happen
The ironic thing is all the people on here being a dick to this guy, assuming he supports trump, while thinking they are better than him. #OnlyLiberals #LookInTheMirror #LibLogic #DontAgreeWithMeYoureARacist
But the trains didn't run on time  But I bet Trump does start bragging that the mail is faster than ever soon and 37% will believe him.
How will Putin launder money to Trump and the GOP if the NRA is shut down?
No Donald Trump is a true Christian. A Laodicean hypocrite. But I did hear that he walked on pond water at his golf club in the sacred land of Miralago.
Trump needs an escape route after November.
Trump and his henchmen testing election night interference.

Joe Biden has a non-religious leftist agenda? Of all people, seriously - of all people - Trump is calling out someone‚Äôs faith?? Can he really be that stupid ‚Äî him who held the Bible upside down &amp; backwards?

Yo what if Trump banning TikTok is the catalyst that gets young people out to vote. How horrifically ironic that would be. But I‚Äôd take it. #HighThoughts
Trump: "For my next trick, I will block anyone from saying bad things about me on WhatsApp, Gmail, Messenger, FaceTime, SMS, and the telephone."
Trump banning Wechat is gonna piss off so many Chinese Americans. Many elderly only get in contact with friends and family through Wechat. This will make so many people's life difficult.
So you must of been a much bigger fan of Trump than Obama? Since Trump was pro LQBT while Obama was against gay marriage. Conservatism does not equate to discrimination just as liberal does not equate to equal rights for all.

Trump takes action on medical supplies during visit to Ohio  #Trump -
When Trump makes major changes to the Republican convention because of Covid yet still calls for open schools, it tells you everything you need to know but the statistics. Thanks for the statistics. But know that Trump is not doing this to kill kids. He simply does not care.
I‚Äôm in the same position. It began when he ‚Äústarted feeling sorry for Trump because everyone is against him‚Äù. He pays no attention to news reports, political news, and so on, so he‚Äôs not an informed voter. My attempts to inform him have been rebuffed. Sigh.
They are linked to tRump and thus far right politics.
If you support Kanye after this, but bitch about Trump and other things going on in the world, you should seriously reevaluate yourself.

Trump has been the biggest presidential supporter of the black people - far more than Obama.
I don‚Äôt know what legal basis Trump‚Äôs team is using for this, but it seems likely this will not end up being enforceable. In which case, it feels like just begging the CCP to retaliate against some American companies, and they actually do have the means to enforce their orders.
Wow, Trump managed to hook in Tencent in the PRC app divestment talk with the CLEAN initiative. This is undoubtably going to fuck over almost every sector of the entertainment industry.

Ask trump...
The point I‚Äôm making and I enjoy this conversation. Power concedes nothing without demand if u don‚Äôt demand policy changes before u vote for someone the likelyhood of a politician changing anything is minimum. Trump could be gone but nothing could change
not disagreeing with u about progressives down ballot. I‚Äôm saying is that who u vote for doesn‚Äôt take away from someone else. If someone earns your vote give it to them.our issues aren‚Äôt going away with trump. Better than trump isn‚Äôt progress. All I‚Äôm sayin.
As a black conservative speaker you should be trying to build bridges between the black community and the Republican part, that doesn‚Äôt entail lying for Trump points.
Actually, it came in internationally from Italy, but since you obviously buy all of Trump‚Äôs bullshit, you‚Äôre just another lost cause.
Take this bullshit &amp; get off this thread! 911 was perpetrated by an outside enemy. Trump called this a hoax after it had already ravaged other countries. He said it would be gone by April &amp; now he says, it is what it is. He is an enemy of the people.
Can you explain ‚ÄúTHE MINDSET‚Äù of trump??
Being an old, the Wechat ban bothers me even more than the TikTok one.
3/ But the whole idea of the "But Italy" argument totally gives away the game. Trump supporters won't hesitate to brag that the USA is the best country in the World. And in some ways they are right. Sticking with the Italy comparison, we are far wealthier. We have better
1/ Trump supporters have tried to defend his coronavirus response with silly whines like "But look at Italy!" Fine, let's look at Italy. Of these 2 graphs of daily Covid-19 deaths, can you guess which one is Italy and which is the USA?
Because your buddy, Trump, is a sociopath narcissistic murderer. And if you support him, then you‚Äôre just as bad.
Trump has no idea what he talking about
Let‚Äôs see the Senate‚Äôs relief bill provides stimulus check but to a few people than the 1st checks, extended unemployment funding based on a silly time consuming formula, relieves employers of liability etc. just more hype equal to vaccine by Nov. 3rd according to Trump the liar
Given how often we see pictures of Biden in churches, quite often kneeling in prayer - that‚Äôs going to be a hard label to stick.  His pro-choice leanings are a better attack vector for Trump.
You know what I see as Fauci‚Äôs greatest failure in this? He didn‚Äôt come prepared to deal with Trump.Trump has one goal: re-election. Fauci      should have passed on the invitation. Like everything else around him, Trump will kill his legacy from his work on HIV. Fauci was naive.
And Trump.
Donald Trump should have to say "It is what it is" at 159,000 funerals.
Just to be clear. More than 30  MILLION Americans are on unemployment due to Trump's Covid failures.   Republicans want to give them a pay cut because they would rather risk a depression than help a Democratic president.  Also, their stocks are doing fine now so they're happy.
I will vote for him no matter who he picks.  Trump must go!!!
Never republican is how I feel after the last 3 nightmare years. The republican politicians are enablers and participants of Trump‚Äôs evilness and corruption. In many years of voting I‚Äôve sometimes voted for republican mayors, governors, and senators - sometimes. Never again.
No. Trump is Evil. Is Evil a mental illness?
Because Donald Trump is going to lose the 2020 election by numbers too big to count and he knows it.....so he is shitting his pants and pulling out every dirty trick he can.  Won't help.... he's a loser. ALWAYS has been, ALWAYS will be.

What fictional people are stupid enough to think that Trump fixed their sinks or showerheads? Even your lies are terrible.
Why does trump org sell so many products from China????
In his defense, I think Trump only ever ran for POTUS to build an audience for a TV network he wanted to start, and was shocked when he won. No sense of service or patriotism or anything like that figured in at all.
Trump is losing or looking like a loser- she has to do something- right?

I feel like you'd agree with both these statements. 1. People should vote. 2. People should be informed.  Let's say someone voted for Trump because they like Universal Health Care and Strict Gun Control. Some have. Uninformed voting can decide elections in arbitrary directions
Yes, but we know Trump‚Äôs donations never materialize.
Trump lies and Americans die
If Biden was for "no religion" and if he killed God, I would love him. But the Bidens are actually Catholics who regularly attend masses. (Unlike Trump, who rarely goes to church, except for photo ops)
Biden was friends with Robert E Byrd dick Russell and Strom Thurmond nut I guess since he‚Äôs a democrat and we have trump in office we can just ignore that
90% of what Trump says is just for Tucker Carlson's writers.
Having just returned from there, it was a whole lotta white people walking around w/o masks.  And many out of state tourists as well.  And a LOT of Trump signs. He needs to be fired.
Donald Trump should ban Fire Emblem from the US That will stop the waifu revolution 2
I cannot in good faith ever vote for a party that time and again has further enabled and defended   His ONLY outspoken critic has been Romney, at which point Trump AND the party turned against Romney.   Amash went independent and left the party.  GOP == Trump.
Thankfully Trump severed all ties with his enterprises or this might suggest self-dealings. Plus a number of other federal law infractions.  A law &amp; order tyrant would never do a thing like that. If Trump gets another 4 years hmm I hear Costa Rica has retiree appeal . Adios amigo
How weak is God that he can't stand up to someone like "Sleepy Joe" Biden, who, according to Trump, is suffering from "serious cognitive decline"?
Trump Country.  Last week we saw one  sign amongst countless signs for the incumbent from Saugatuck to Holt.
Oh, but it is about Trump.  Just wait!!!
Trump won't leave his house to give a convention speech but he wants your kids and teachers to spend 30+ hours a week in human petri dish schools.
Must be Trump supporters picking up on that great advice he gave everyone.
Is this the type of content we're supposed to start paying $100/year for?  There was one "anti-Trump" MI Republican -- Justin Amash, and he's not even a Republican anymore.  MI Republicans (incl  are all-in on Trump. There's no separation.
How can a devout Catholic ‚Äúhurt God?‚Äù The man is deranged. Look- if you vote for Trump, I‚Äôm just gonna assume you‚Äôre IQ and age are the same number.
hahahahaha ... ‚Äúshreds‚Äù. Biden is a devout Catholic and Trump doesn‚Äôt know the proper orientation to hold up a bible. Please.
Yes I‚Äôm aware of that but she‚Äôs more widely known as a Trump boot licker and professional double talker. Wierd that they would all be able to live under one roof. Hence the shout out for the pro bono family lawyer I suppose.
You will say anything for Trump points, you are a fake black conservative. Trump has added more debt then any president in history, he may be Republican but he is not conservative.
Not to mention that Trump has an actual record in office now.
NRA members, it is possible to have people lobby for your gun rights who are not stealing from you and helping Donald Trump's Russian treason. Figure it out.
Why would we vote for people that support Trump?
This is crazy. I wish Trump would say, "Eating inside in restaurants is the American way." That would get them shut down in an instant.
And the obvious fact that Biden is a deeply devout Catholic and Trump doesn‚Äôt know the proper orientation for holding a bible.Which do you want?  "A"  "Trump Plague"  &amp; Trump Forever    Or  "B"

And here's what he wants   Trump FOREVER    Vote  B
Boggles the mind MSM cuts away from watching informative news shows and makes us have to watch Trump. Then they spend  COUNTLESS HOURS regurgitating Trump spewing Lies after Lies!!!
Some trump worshiper followed me via bot and I think i'm just gonna let him find out on his own.
They think they operate in a free market beforehand, but don't seem to understand that forcing oil companies to buy corn for ethanol fuel is a hand-out. When Trump stopped that for their "free market", they all lost money and had to grow soybeans.
There is justification for thinking that some farmers really are mush for brains. They do not understand reality. They are willing to lose money on the ideology that created all their problems because they think he has some kind of secret plan.
Can't stop thinking about those fools in that Dirty Money episode 'Slumlord Millionaire" who were living in a home in disrepair own by Jared Kushner but still thought Trump was great.
Anyone who tells you this is a lock for Trump.
Hogan, read the 12/2010 law that Trump &amp; GOP have tried to repeal. H.R.3590 - Patient Protection  Affordable Care Act, Sec. 1201, as modified by Sec. 10103) is ONLY LAW that covers Pre-existing conditions   #Obamacare
The ACA or Obamacare covers preexisting conditions. It‚Äôs the equivalent of Trump signing an EO naming tomorrow Saturday
The cognitive test is only given if your doctor suspects you may have mental and/or cognitive or memory issues. If trump was given the test it‚Äôs because his doctor was concerned!  Biden was not given the test because his doctor saw no reason that might require it!!

No, that will get repealed and replaced after the Republicans take back the house after the November Election. President Trump, and the Republican Senate will get it done in 2021.

Didn't the Democrats attack President Trump for hiding out in a bunker? I guess most Democrats relate to living in a basement, mainly there parents.
Why might Whitmer be a finalist for VP? She is very popular in Michigan, a state that Trump barely won in 2016. She may be the most popular Democrat in Midwest battleground states.
I‚Äôve defined my source every tweet, Vladimir.  Also your little tirade describes the Trump campaign. Nice projection! This is you:
No your just just a follower with no argument, just hate. If you're not voting for Trump because you don't like him, that's like eating a dog turd because you dont like broccoli. You all put stupid non issues in front of reality. Grow Up!
Trump is actively trying to destroy a beloved, useful institution and somewhere around 40% of the country still gives him two thumbs up, very cool
This is why we know Trump says it like it is. Stop proving him right Jim! Are you that naive? Don't you have some sort a record now for bending the news to fit your political beliefs? Are you a reporter, or activist, posing as a journalist? Try writing a few positive stories?
If anyone made it political it was Trump. He just does not get it, that politics is not a meant as a skill to keep people fooled. If Trump had not destroyed the economy it took a long time to rebuild, and had allowed 160k people to lose their lives because he feared his base.Weak
Trump already created more Jobs than any President since Ronald Reagan. You Democrats did not. Guess what? 2.8 Million people went back to work in July. 14.7% unemployment 2 months ago. 10.2 percent now. In 3 months we will be back to low levels again. Thanks to

Everything he says puts Trump lagging.
They are the most selfish people on earth. They have theirs and that's all they care about. They see trump as the means to maintaining that. They don't know what empathy is.

Trump placed about $3.6 billion worth of new tariffs on Canadian aluminum. Canada said ‚Äúokay, bet‚Äù and placed new tariffs on all US goods to the exact dollar amount of the aluminum tariffs, thus making everything 0 out. Elite level trolling.

I bet he doesn‚Äôt care, because he knows Putin wants him to win because Trump will give him anything he wants.  is a asset to Russia.
Its funny how  was never was involved with anyyhing until photos surfaced with him and his son with the Ukraine Company in question. Then it jogged his memory. Crooked Hillary, Bad Biden.  !!Trump 2020!!

Brace yourselves to have Trump ruin your Friday night.
Please stop covering Trump's taxpayer-funded campaigning as "press conferences."  Stop covering them at all. Ask for a transcript and report on it from the words on the page.

Donald J Trump became POS POTUS CORRUPTUS  to steal money. He has stolen a lot. Helping Americans is not part of the GOP agenda.
Mike Pompeo and Donald J Trump approve of Russian bounties to kill American troops. Of course they do. They are Republicans.
#MoscowMitchMcConnell isnt going to do anything about the news that Russia is trying to ‚Äúdenigrate‚Äù #JoeBiden by hacking into our elections because he‚Äôs benefiting from it just like crime boss Trump.  needs to be removed from Congress.   #thebeat
Donald J Trump and the GOP approve of Russian bounties to kill American troops.
These people , who obviously have no sense of decency , are the core of trump's base. He enables them. He encourages them. We have to take this country back in November.

The only administration in history that he could fit into ...is trump's. No one else would have anything to do with him.
This is good. From all accounts he was flaunting the standards that students were held to. That said, I have the ominous feeling that if he agreed readily like it sounds, it's because he has a job in the Trump administration lined up already.

Donald J Trump, Russian mole, approves of Russian bounties to kill American troops. Also, Trump spies for fascist Russia.

Hey Faris! Your friendly neighborhood information security professional here. While I'm totally with you that we should be prioritizing MANY things over tiktok, and while Trump's reasoning may be because of his ego (which would be dumb), tik Tok is definitely a threat. 1/
He knows he's talking about  and he is none of these things, right? Trump is however dumb like a stump. And batshit crazy. Can't forget crazy.

As someone who recently had to move here, i can say from experience  and the citizens of Michigan is taking #COVID19 way more seriously than  That being said i also see more Trump supporters; its sad public health disregard goes hand in hand with politics
Reason 88 to vote Democrat: After Trump's Tax Cuts in 2017, the US deficit soared. This either means cutting services to those who need it the most or leaving crushing debt to us, the younger generations. Democrats will raise taxes on the richest Americans to protect our future.

This is a ridiculous example of his failures. Here's a few of his accomplishments.
Let's start by teaching our history with the truth. I NEVER  knew about Tulsa until Trump scheduled his rally there and I saw some tweets about the possible message he was sending.   So I googled it and was horrified of the event that took place.  There are more ...
Michigan used to be covert in its racism(not that this was a good thing), but there are some that are totally out in the open in the age of Trump.  He thinks BLM is taking away "his" country.  This is why systemic racism is the issue.
Donald Trump directly is responsible for these deaths. When a president speaks,  even a terrible one,  there will be people who listen and take them literally
Wow. How disgusting. I can‚Äôt wait until we vote Trump out and wipe the arrogant smile off this criminal‚Äôs face. This person, US Attorney General, is CAMPAIGNING for Trump!! #RemoveBillBarr
Why is the new jobs report being touted as a win? Are Trump supporters so desperate for a win that they consider the record high unemployment he caused by pretending COVID was a hoax, dropping to just barely below record high unemployment, means he‚Äôs a great leader?
Conservatism can come back in response to a new Democratic President without changing much:  In power, it amounts to deficit-financed tax cuts &amp; a lighter liberal advance. But that hasn‚Äôt stopped its power as a backlash movement the next time
The backlash future for the Republicans is given short shrift here because Brooks doesn‚Äôt recognize that the failure to translate a positive policy vision is endemic. It doesn‚Äôt have to be economically or policy focused; it can rely on thermostatic public

We all need to accept Trump is a cheat, liar, unethical brute that continues to get away with crime and unconstitutional violations without consequences.
Zero knowledge of science including scientific method. Trump doesn't have clue about research, testing, positive-negative results, placebos, and control groups.
Trump mocks Biden but he doesn't know where states are or their capitals. Pronunciations are a consistent problem for words he probably he has rarely used. Regular dope.

When someone tells me they know a lot of people don‚Äôt like Trump but they are voting for him and then ask my opinionThe sad truth for the non sociopathic worshipping part of society is Trump's sycophants will not waver or change sadly until they get screwed by him.

Anyone who cant see this move for what it really is either a sycophant or  hasnt been paying attention the last 4 years. While it's incredibly possible Trump is too stupid to know why this Executive order is unconstitutional the GOP does. They know the order infringes on the...
If Trump gives me $600 a month extended UIA with executive order  that's the most government has done for me in a long time. Just saying.
A SNL skit about a delusional headline writer might be funny but in real life it screams I've no credibility but want attention. The nature of intel gathering makes it murky so there's rarely a consensus. Labeling it disputed here is only about an inconvenient narrative to Trump.
Agree completely. My hope is Dems take the Senate so no matter what Trump does - if re-elected - foiled. We‚Äôre in such a bad place.
i  know it's  true.  trump will stop at NOTHING to get reelected.
Yea I think the move there would be to say it‚Äôs a deep fake video...which given that it‚Äôs coming from Russia is entirely plausible. The problem with stuff from Russia is you can‚Äôt trust anything whether you like or hate Trump.

The GOP is so in the weeds with Trump that they are complicit.
I have a Master's degree and have in fact travelled outside my home state. I need neither to know that Trump is a failed human whom history will revile.   I need neither to conclude the same about you.
My beef is with Trump not you. We did need to shut down for a short period of time to stop the spread, what needed to happen was a real man in the white house with a plan for testing and treatment that would have ended the lockdown sooner.

For at least the next 20 years or so after this Trump catastrophe. The complete and total abdication of responsibility and basic decency by the Republican Party is unforgivable.
Unless you‚Äôre part of the ruling class, the American government doesn‚Äôt care about you.  Joe Biden isn‚Äôt going to change this. Donald Trump isn‚Äôt going to change this. American electoralism as it stands isn‚Äôt going to change this.
at this point i don‚Äôt understand how anyone who is planning on voting for trump isn‚Äôt evil. even surface level you can see who the bad guy is. it‚Äôs black and white. like a movie almost. why do u blindly support a villain? are u really that selfish, inempathetic, and horrible?
You‚Äôre way too old and incoherent to be our president. I dare you to debate President Trump!
I tend to agree for the most part, but I don't care that Biden is "old" so long as he is a democrat he has my vote and any other "D" I can vote for.  We have to get Trump and as many Republicans out in order to undo this nightmare.
Is Donald Trump just a Conservative? You can be conservative in your views and still care about people.

I can't even believe this comparison. It's like apples to oranges. Mr Obama was our President, trump is not!
Actually, it is what trump made it.
Not true! Look around. His base is not remaining silent any longer. The riots, open murders, burning buildings, assaults on innocent people have hurt the democrats! Trump stands with the civilized rational Americans. Wake up! Your partyü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüëá
My Daddy would have called trump a "bullshitter".
Wow!  Trump completely makes it up as he goes along. He‚Äôll say anything regardless of whether it‚Äôs true or not. You must live in The Land of the Easily Led.
Text TRUMP to 88022! I stand with
What an absolute fucking asshole. I never imagined I'd see a president so weak and pathetic as Trump is here.
Wow lmao sounds like he supports trump üòÇ not before trump.
Black people are being killed by cops Trump: they are killing White people too!  COVID has killed 160,000 Americans Trump: it‚Äôs killed a lot of people in other countries too!
The Republican US Senate candidate in Michigan is lying in his campaign ad. In the Trump tradition.  The current US Senator Gary Peters is a US Navy veteran.   Yet another GOP Senate candidate uses ‚ÄòRanger‚Äô label despite Army caveat
Sounds like before trump?! I‚Äôm confused
Trump‚Äôs gestapo is alive and well in DC.  Two Black moms took their kids to the Mall. Secret Service officers confronted them with guns, they said.
Promise you if trump does not win, all trump supporters will start saying people cheated because of the mail in votes. Mark my words.
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe Trump is banning an app that steals our data and is run by the same communist govt that unleashed a plague on the world‚Äù cried the people who cheered states banning church services, gatherings, businesses from reopening and mandated face coverings.
Trump Not Impressed by John Lewis: ‚ÄòHe Didn‚Äôt Come to My Inauguration‚Äô. That is soooo pathetic. And you wonder why you are not loved? No one will visit you when you are making license plates in New York. Except maybe Fox News.
Trump Not Impressed by John Lewis: ‚ÄòHe Didn‚Äôt Come to My Inauguration‚Äô. That is soooo pathetic. And you wonder why you are not loved? No one will visit you when you are making license plates in New York. Except maybe Fox News.  What are you? Eight years old?

Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance's recent court filing suggests President Trump and his company, The Trump Organization, may be under investigation for possible bank and insurance fraud, The New York Times reports. You can hide...but they will find you.
turn all states blue people and vote trump out the White House üè°. We had enough of him and his family and his lies. Vote this old fart republicans MitchPutin out of the senate house üè°. And all of his manaces out and mental illness friends.And vote veterans LT. Marine McGrath .
Trump is Putins puppet!
Phew!!! it is a joke. .I was getting worried...That Joe was pulling a Trump move..Trying get a buck any way he can!! He's got my vote...But I was thinking.."Damn does he need campaign funds that bad!!ü§£ü§£
hmmmmmm..... I'm voting for you,  but I don't like this concept Joe.üôÑ.. you getting commercial like Trump.. you in need of campaign funds that bad??.. if you gonna go the Gimmick route.. Lol give a way a Tee shirt with a vote for you!!ü§£ü§£ü§£
Dear President Trump, we are all going to do that.  We are going to vote you out. Bye bye
Now that it‚Äôs on record trump didn‚Äôt solicit young woman with Epstein people call in propeganda. Y‚Äôall are a trip.
Arabs for trump
üòê seriously, it was it is. I mean I‚Äôve been relatively ho hum this past week. I feel like if you retweet even one thing pro trump you get shadow banned.
What trump really thinks about his followers.The deep state and the media have a nonsense narrative... all foreign nation, terrorist group, would like to get out Trump and America first... including Canada, Mexico and maybe England too..
If Trump gives me $600 a month extended UIA with executive order  that's the most government has done for me in a long time. Just saying.
i  know it's  true.  trump will stop at NOTHING to get reelected.
Yea I think the move there would be to say it‚Äôs a deep fake video...which given that it‚Äôs coming from Russia is entirely plausible. The problem with stuff from Russia is you can‚Äôt trust anything whether you like or hate Trump.
You need never apologize if you are omniscient (though I'd like to hear Trump try to pronounce the word)
Americans-Where is Trump‚Äôs great healthcare plan he promised?  Trump-I‚Äôm signing a executive order to cover ‚ÄúPre-existing conditions‚Äù  Americans-We already have that with The Affordable Care Act(Obamacare)  Trump- ‚ÄúKayleigh is that true, can I see the paper‚Äù  Americans-
I can‚Äôt wait to see what Kayleigh says when a reporter tells her we already have this in Obamacare. How will she spin this? Trump is delusional.
And trump is a bad guy ??
You mean unlike trump‚Äôs ‚Äúit is what it is‚Äù?
Just in time for Trump to award him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
What a crock of BS. If Scott was smart enough to be a Trump supporter in 2016, he would still be a Trump supporter today! There is now logic to this unless he only watches CNN or MSN-BS!!!!!!! Bogus!!!!!
I mean, I don‚Äôt know Trump personally, but I‚Äôd have to assume he‚Äôs always a nervous wreck because the next ‚Äúbig set back‚Äù is always right around the corner.
The GOP is so in the weeds with Trump that they are complicit.
I have a Master's degree and have in fact travelled outside my home state. I need neither to know that Trump is a failed human whom history will revile.   I need neither to conclude the same about you.
but its good for them tastes great
Yes but now they have to focus on their defense, and can't donate to President Trump's campaign. Word is, this is the main reason NY AG is doing it. Sick!  I wish Republicans would learn to fight fire, with fire. They've done way more dirty sht! Sue! Investigate! Expose em!
You‚Äôre wrong trump
Trump impeded nothing It took Whitless quite a while to wake up to what her job was, problem is she still doesn't get it. Recall Whitless
Look at their profile to make sure MAGA not included. Or Trump 2020. Or Confederate flags. Or libtards. You know, all the key words.
I mean, member when she also said ‚ÄúDonald Trump is not going to be President. You can take that to the bank. He‚Äôs not gonna be president.‚Äù Lolz
How many million has Trump and his crooked family stolen since he has become president?
Burn that garbage, Trump is going down November 3rd...Biden 2020 MFers ü§£
Imagine not realizing you are a Bot account created by Trump‚Äôs inner circle. That you JR.? You get caught stealing from St. Judes Hospital again?
Makes alot more sense once I see youre a trump supporting republican. You enjoy telling people what they can and can't do with their OWN BODYS so makes sense.
Story:  This is significant because it suggest that this could eventually lead to a ban on US companies distributing their apps in China.
Still beats a fascist, wannabe dictator Trump.
Didn‚Äôt the ‚Äúradical Left‚Äù ‚Äúkill God‚Äù?  If Trump believes God is dead, or that he never existed, why should Trump care?  Trump uses the Christian religion only to further his own agenda, as he does everything else in his life, including family, community &amp; money. Repugnant old man
If #Trump can bar #TickTock from the American markets because of "national security" what other social media app is next?
You mean how Trump believes that one of his best friends, Kim Jong-Un, didn‚Äôt kill Otto Warmbier? Trump is friends with leaders who kill Americans. Great representative for America huh?
Liberals hope to somehow hurt Trump by this. Amazing.
What injunction? They have been trying to burn the building for two months. All this is only to avoid Trump sending in the National Guard and ending this commie uprising once and for all. The cops have been standing down all the time,  working with commies.
The whole thing is to make Trump look bad, but in reality, the sick libs are hurting themselves. The so-called protests could be stopped in one day, but sick libs choose to do nothing because they have been ordered to stand down from Hillary and Obama.
165,000 Dead from Coronavirus, 31 million Jobs lost. Worst economy since The Great Depression. Has lied over 20,000 times as President. Allowed Russia to order hits on our soilders. On November 3rd say goodbye to Trump.
Countries run by Trump are in shambles
Does that mean they will call on Trump to resign since you know, he paid off porn stars when he cheated on his wife?
üñïüèª Trump
Remember when Trump said Mexico would pay for the wall, he would create the greatest healthcare plan ever, save coal jobs, manufacturing jobs, Carrier, Harley Davidson and get rid of the National Debt?
Trump banning League
Posted an anti-Trump thought tonight. Had someone "enlighten" me that Joe Biden is being controlled by Satanists and pedophiles who want to undo Trump's help for Christians.   I respectfully disagreed. I was then told I was "beguiled by the devil."   So, how was your day?
When Trump said he wanted to stop the riots, I didn't know he meant the Riot's and the Epic's.
For at least the next 20 years or so after this Trump catastrophe. The complete and total abdication of responsibility and basic decency by the Republican Party is unforgivable.
You mean when Biden is running for his second term and Trump is in prison and bankrupt.
at this point i don‚Äôt understand how anyone who is planning on voting for trump isn‚Äôt evil. even surface level you can see who the bad guy is. it‚Äôs black and white. like a movie almost. why do u blindly support a villain? are u really that selfish, inempathetic, and horrible?
I tend to agree for the most part, but I don't care that Biden is "old" so long as he is a democrat he has my vote and any other "D" I can vote for.  We have to get Trump and as many Republicans out in order to undo this nightmare.
People are irate because it shouldn‚Äôt matter who Biden picks as VP. A decent person can look at the two choices that we have - Trump or Biden - and choose Biden without hesitation, no matter what. Because Trump is NEVER an acceptable choice.
No retweet but a hell of a lot of laughter. It‚Äôs simply too much please stop with the comedy routine. If you think that people actually believe this is even more hilarious. But not quite as hilarious as watching you and the rest of you morons when Trump wins again in November
What? Are you going to riot over more lies and burn more things down?? Wow. How original. Keep telling the idiots that believe you more garbage. They are the weak and dumb minority. But keep on. Every time you do it‚Äôs just more votes for Trump &amp; the GOP. üëçüèªüëçüèªüá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I knew Donald Trump's hair looks familiar
Trump wants a vaccine however he has said multiple times holistical approach is what he truly supports and hydroxychloroquine also discredited by Fauci and big Farma because these are cheep remedies that won‚Äôt make billions for Bill Gates
I‚Äôm a Michigander and I hate this Bitch with a passion she is manipulating this Plandemic so she can do her part to try and get Trump not re elected
I hope you enjoy the rest of your communist days in this country. Standing in line for toilet paper and bread. Trump 2020, Trump Jr 2024
I- ...........so this who I gotta vote for to get trump out?ü•¥
Donald Trump doesn't know how to drive a car! Probably wouldn't know how to start a new one.
Michigan Trump 2020
I think that you forgot that Republicans either believe that Trump can do no wrong or have to act like they believe that
Trump is winning though. And you know why? UNLIMITED POWER!!!
tRump is confusing Joe Biden's policy on China with HIS policy on Russia. Stupid as the day is long.
#JoeBiden is a Catholic who attends Mass. The closes #Trump has EVER gotten to Scripture was when he held up a Bible for a photo-op... if we are to believe it was a Bible! #thursdayvibes #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
And I will sometimes vote for a conservative IF they have the best interests of the community I live in at heart. Currently the GOP as it stands who all support Trump and Trump himself doesn't. If and when there are conservatives that do again (see Hogan, DeWine types), I might.
Checking out her account, it's a joke that took on a major life of it's own - I think she was hoping Trump would take the bait.  Woooops.
Trump did it telepathically
Trump
Trump is obviously referring to Biden's training with Hattori Hanzo.
Where do you see trump supporters not being civilized? All I‚Äôve see is riots, murders, burning bibles and flags, assaults on innocent people and law enforcement... all be the left!!! Please explain yourself...
Are you shocked? That is the Democrat party in a nutshell.
I know none of us want trump, but we can acknowledge that Biden is racist as hell too right?
While I do intend to vote for Trump, I'm not what you would call a cultist. When he's right or wrong, I say so. Problem is the Left is almost always wrong, so Trump is the only choice we have.
And he will still beat Trump's sorry ass November 3rd...Tick Tock!
Thanks, I go out of my way to not listen to Trump so thanks for the explanation.
is spitting straight facts about Trump on undisputed this morning üòÇüôåüèª
Trump!!!
Facebook, Twitter Pull Trump Posts Over Coronavirus Misinformation - The New York Times
Imagine if trump asked a black reporter if he did coke before they went on air and then continued to ask if he was a junky   Just imagine the headlines ‚Äútrump racist, implies African American journal..‚Äù   But Biden does it? Not a peep
Honestly if we don‚Äôt see Biden and trump speak to each other on a debate stage then we shouldn‚Äôt have an election.   1. You should have to be able to defend your platform in a non-scripted setting   2. If either of them catch Covid let‚Äôs be fucking honest nobody is gonna cry
#DemocraticParty, #HRC voters, are worried that the warp-speed Vaccines and therapeutics are going to destroy their #FakeNews that Trump doesn't have clue.
Kanye Has a Senior GOP Strategist Helping Him Get on the Ballot in Colorado - VICE     are you good with Trump snd the GOP using Kanye?    I personally would sue them for taking advantage of someone they know is not well.
#DeutscheBank reportedly hands over detailed records related to dealings with President #TrumpFamily business after receiving a subpoena. Ouch. Nothing new before the #Elections2020 but if he loses...ü§î
The idea that any of the corporate media calls account to power is a joke. Other than a few exceptions, most media scares people and only gives them a very small ideas to choose from. Why are they completely ignoring Jo Jorgensen? There are so many people sick of Trump and Biden.
Trump is winning, you are losing!
Honestly Covid or not I think the American people deserve to at least see trump and Biden battle about IQ tests on a debate stage like this needs to happen
Feeling bothered by the feeling that my sophomore English teacher giving a lesson on W.B. Yeats ‚ÄúThe Second Coming‚Äù (Things Fall Apart) in 2016 was like real life foreshadowing of the Trump era
My only problem with this statement is that Biden is going to decimate Trump. I cannot imagine that any single VP option on Biden's list won't do the same to Pence.
What trump said to Axios Swan (they are dying, that‚Äôs true, ant it is what it is). Please reporters stop Camparing Beirut‚Äôs blasts to Trump‚Äôs failure pandemic.

Thank you my friend. Some people don‚Äôt have sympathy. They just want to compare explosions blast to trump failure pandemic
I still can‚Äôt believe that Shri4Three actually happened and I feel bad as fuck for not supporting the primary opponent.  I hope somebody launches a really solid write-in campaign because he only lost by 2000 votes.  Same goes for Trump‚Äôs favorite state legislator, Karen Whitsett.
Barr will block it. The AG, the nation's senior law enforcement official, is in effect Trump's personal attorney
Wrong again - trump cheated - Putin helped him.
Troll Level:  Trump-like
I‚Äôm not wanting to argue with you man. I respect your opinion. Just respect mine. If Trump gets re-elected I won‚Äôt be devastated but just not happy about it. Peace !
If you wanted to get elected, why would you "show your hand" before November. You could have had some of us on your side of the fance that weren't happy with Trump.
Not if they end up someone like Donald Trump... they can become Santa Clause, I won‚Äôt object to that
I am a Dam. While I love Adam Schiff and, believe he is more than qualified; I won't write him in.  1. If he wanted to be president he would have run.  2. There aren't enough votes to make him viable. 3. I don't want to take away,or give a vote to Trump. I wish he would have run
People are going to vote for Biden because he's not Trump. No other reason than that
Trump
why would people come out to vote in a primary where he was running unopposed?  I know there was someone running against Trump, but no one remembers his name, and no one cared.
I'll feel that way once they give everyone on unemployment the extra $600 back. And we get McConnell and Trump out. Then we can work on eradicating the corporate Dems. We the people need to take the government Back.
That‚Äôs why we need to go out and vote trump and his goonies out of the office
Those are the people are stealing this country. And trump is going to bankrupt this country like he did to all of previous companies
Around 2 people died of Ebola. Trump pandemic killed over 160,000, and more dying
Yeah I get that Biden is a little off. But I like him better than Trump...plain and simple.
Trump thinks that America is to him and he doesn‚Äôt want to give it up. Everyone needs to stand for trump and tell him this is dictatorships country
Trump Hashem stolen over $660 billion dollars. This the money is Congress is asking trump administration about. And trump isn‚Äôt listening nor giving anything to Congress
It‚Äôs NOT the media; it‚Äôs listening to Trump talk! He sounds like a total dip-whit! He‚Äôs sinking his own ship with what he says to the media. IMHO.
To be fair, a pandemic hit. Obama (who I love) didn‚Äôt experience a pandemic. Trump handled it horribly!! But yea.
He‚Äôs starting to use Trump‚Äôs accordion hands.
Trump if he loses the election to Biden
From Jim Jordan to Trump and Covid‚Ä¶It‚Äôs always about¬†politics.
Absentee ballots are counted before the main election and you know that. #Lies #LoserTrump #LoserFox  Fox News: Trump, in 'Fox &amp; Friends' interview, warns it could take years to get election results with mass-mailed ballots.
After all, dying from #COVID19 "is what it is". #wednesdaymorning #TrumpIsALaughingStock #TrumpIsKillingAmericans #TrumpIsALoser
A lot of states do fine with ballot mailing.  Just like the "fake news" that has suddenly popped up with Trump, ballot mailing is suddenly a problem THIS YEAR, though it's funny, he's okay with Florida doing it, and he does it every year.  Huh.
Maybe if trump ever does anything worthy of respect...
They want that National Guard arrive, so that Trump would look bad. Lol.
If a US general said this then I'm ashamed to know that our general doesn't have enough experience that this may not be a bomb. But of course IDIOT TRUMP totally ignored what a general would say and formed his own opinion.
The idea that the Republicans have ever been for small government is a complete joke. Trump bragging about the largest bill and possibly thinking about making some state action in regards to "income inequality". Trump makes a joke of what Republicans think they stand for.
Trump says US generals tell him Beirut blast 'bomb of some kind'  via
Really?  Lying!?? Trump hasn't told the truth in 3.5 years!
Trump Supporters R SO FUKING STUPID
funny thing if her name was Kilpatrick she still would have won
#Trump message on #BeirutBlast is misinformation in my opinion.  By claiming possible outside responsibility, confusion ensues and an external actor can be blamed instead of the incompetent Lebanese elites, who are beholden to the West and must be protected at all costs. #Lebanon
I‚Äôm gonna miss not having debates with an audience cause I was hoping Biden would invite all of the women Trump sexually abused to sit in the audience like that ba$tard did with The Clinton‚Äôs. The difference being it didn‚Äôt rattle Hillary it would totally shut Trump down.

11 jaw-dropping moments from Trump‚Äôs flabbergasting ‚ÄòAxios‚Äô interview    Dang. This juicy af. Nice work Mr. Swan.
If Biden decides to debate trump. Biden should bring all the girls and women he attacked and called them names.
Fantastic. Genius. Turned this ad out quickly. Now can we make it mandatory watching in every room of hospitals, nursing homes, and senior center. "Trump doesn't care if you die. Please vote Joe 2020. Please ask you families to save your life and vote Joe 2020. He cares.
Bernie only wants to disrupt. I personally find him as guilty of stealing the 2016 election as the Russians and Trump.
ahhhh. It's a Trump joke...
Thank you. Now in Sunday's HBO Axios interview the Orange bastard said that Floridians should vote by mail. Bipartisan my ass. Trump and GOP want mail in votes in states they must win. Trump knows he cannot win Florida w/o seniors and mail in voting.
Wow. Trump said that??
Trump would think this was a compliment.
‚ÄúEvery time I speak of the haters and losers I do so with great love and affection, they cannot help the fact that they were born fucked up!‚Äù ‚Äî Donald Trump

Leads me to believe Mary Trump! Someone did take  college exam test. And if he was being sarcastic. saying He doesn't know Congressman John Lewis. He failed at that..same way he is failing Americans üòî Trump is so ignorant he doesnt  know how to fake being smartüôÑ
Your President is so childish.He is such a babyüë∂üèº. "Congressman Lewis..don't like me so I don't like him!!" What a Boob! For Trump to say he does not know John Lewis!! "An Original Freedom Rider!", This man stood at the Capitol before him
When individuals lack a basic understanding of politics in the US, this is the unfortunate conclusion people reach. If anything Trump is the perfect candidate of the elites and those who seek to divide and conquer, right here at home. 2/2
It's no surprise to see many supposedly enlightened people openly say they will vote for Trump, even right here in the Muslim and Arab communities. They claim he is candid, an outsider, and up against the deep state. 1/2
trump refused to hang this portrait.  let's break the internet with it!
Its true. I‚Äôm not sure why Trump agrees to all these inteviews, people just end up hating him for it. We know by now that if it isn‚Äôt about Trump, Trump isn‚Äôt interested.
I think we can accurately assess she is not only a Trump supporter, but also a Christian.
Initially I thought you were giving Trump too much credit for having a clue, but yea how could he not know this ‚Äúcivil rights legend‚Äù?
Is Trump even going to debate?
The fact that people think Trump isn‚Äôt a pedophile himself is wild to me. Like just look into that nasty history of his since the 80‚Äôs bro ü§£ü§£

As co-chair of the Great Lakes Task Force, I have opposed the dangerous rollback of water pollution standards imposed by the Trump Administration, and am committed to continuing to protect our Great Lakes from PFAS and other hazardous chemicals.

I‚Äôm saying someone who wants Trump to be president enacted budget cuts that made the USPS less able to process voting ballots that could have been a threat to his re-election chances. Conflict of interest.
We are supposed to believe this too? Just like Epstein, Trump will have anyone murdered who is a threat to expose the Truth.
That‚Äôs why Deutsche Bank is under investigation. Nobody could figure how Trump got hundreds of millions of loans when his credit was horrible. He‚Äôs a scam artist like he‚Äôs always been. He only cares about the Trump family name not anyone else.
Wow, really. Trump has mocked and attacked Women, Minorities, Gold Star families and people who served this country. Trump has defended White Supremacists, Confederate Statues and flags, and Mass Murderers who have killed Americans(Kim Jong-Un, Putin). Trump is a disgrace.
Well, that is certainly misleading. tRump is not giving shit to aid human trafficking survivors. Our taxpayers, are giving $35 million. How much you you pay in taxes, junior?
Wow lmao sounds like he supports trump üòÇ not before trump.
Sounds like before trump?! I‚Äôm confused
Promise you if trump does not win, all trump supporters will start saying people cheated because of the mail in votes. Mark my words.
So that still means people are dying from the Coronavirus. People can live full lives with diabetes, asthma, heart problems and even immune deficiencies. If a person has cancer and is murdered, u don‚Äôt blame the cancer. What if something worse hits us. Trump is incompetent.
First of all, no one knows exactly how much Trump is worth because the coward won‚Äôt release his tax returns. Secondly, Trump has failed at 95% of the businesses he‚Äôs had. The majority of his money comes from his name. Bill Clinton and Deutsche Bank saved him when he was bankrupt

Trump doesn‚Äôt believe in Democracy, he wants a dictatorship like Kim Jong-Un. If you say anything bad about him he wants you in jail. He‚Äôs the worst President we have ever had and that‚Äôs saying a lot since we had the Bush family.
Maybe he isn't aware. The rest of America and companies pay taxes, the is the US cut.  Trump says TikTok sale can go through but only if the US gets a cut
The teachers union can go to hell. They don‚Äôt care about kids. Only themselves. Tell your sister not to blame Trump when it‚Äôs the teachers union that is corrupt and greedy.

While people find the current President detestable we in Michigan have had as bad or worse historically. How about a proven bribe scheme to the entire of City of Detroit with the Mafia. Trump might be bad but things can get worse. Perspective is useful.
Why use science rationally when you can try to politicize it I suppose is the idea.
Congratulations for the expanded Deadline White  House program - you deserve it!   P.S.   a lot of us turn off the Trump briefings so if you see a dip in ratings - it‚Äôs not you, it‚Äôs him.
They will try, but it won't be enough. Which will be yet another embarrassment in their growing portfolio of failures to take Trump out.
No debates stick with Trump! Easy enough.

Trump already rolled out his health plan months ago, he wants us dead.
Asking for a friend... Is the delay in releasing tRump‚Äôs new health care plan is that they are trying to figure out what prescriptions are covered?
Actually Trump makes it very easy and most of the journalists parrot each other.   See it on MSNBC every day.   Joe usually steers the ship.
"This invisibility was partly a product of Trump supporters looking to avoid offending their more union-sympathetic friends and neighbors. But it was also the result of a broader Midwestern reticence, a reluctance to discuss subjects on which opinion might be split."
Working on it. We're there, but have to keep outlying nuts from falling for Trump's fear/hate mongering. Our suburbs were well integrated during Obama, it helps us today. Trump segregation will hurt us, they felt that last week. Majority is offended. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020
Not true. Trump was still using a (D),saying IF he ran as pres, he'd pick HRC as VP.  While starting Birtherism. He was widely panned by dems 4 Obama admin. He isa racist, anti women's right, moron. He would not have been nominated as a dems. Stop drinking the Orange kool aide.
Uh, we could probably put 48 hours of tRump speaking nonsense, and another 14 hours of him lying. Is the GOP really sure it wants to go there?
YouTube is going to haunt Republicans for the next 20 years or more. There are literally no end to the things they‚Äôve let Trump get away with that as soon as a Democrat is in the White House they‚Äôre suddenly going to be morally outraged again at every little thing.
Same with me But I crack up watching Sarah Cooper She's 1 funny talented young lady Trump was burned by youngsters using the ap They made them think the the Tulsa rally was going to be HUGE Turned out tiny like his manly organ

As far as Trump is concerned, I could never vote for him. I just don't like him.
Don't vote for Trump
Trump just exposed the negativity and hate inside other people. Trump himself bring people together if you really listen to what he says and take away politics and BS. It's the decay of society showing after poor upbringing and schooling.
Recruit everyone that you can in the great State of Alabama to vote for Biden.  That‚Äôs the only way that we‚Äôll get rid of the Trump Virus and the only hope that we have to create harmony amongst our peoples.

Yes, if it accepted widely by the scientific community.  No, if Trump's fingerprints are anywhere near it.

Simple: because if you are not going to support the candidate of the Democratic Party that got the most votes and delegates during the primary, the obvious result will be a people crushing return of Trump.
And that has led to what, exactly? Besides Trump, that is. The Green Party might become relevant when they organize, run, and get folks elected at state and local elections. Otherwise they're an ostrich hole.

Is the  attempting to reelect Trump with Russia's help??? #YouBeTheJudge (Article from ‚Å¶
Trump called a deadly virus a hoax, now 160k Americans are dead.
We know Kanye just trying to split the black vote to help Trump win.
NOBOBY WORST THEN TRUMP.
The only thing Trump can legally do with the executive order is a continuance of a bill that expired.  He has that authority.  So yes, by execute decree he can extend the $600 unemployment benefits, but he cannot change the amount.
The reason we hate Trump is because we love our country. Which btw was never founded on a religion but rather the lack thereof. Are you familiar with separation of church and state? He's trying to destroy it.
You know just as well as everyone else that Biden can be persuaded, and damn well that Trump cannot. Trump will continue to cheat our government for the benefit of the 1% and his followers are so oblivious they think it's for them.
Uhm are you like blind? Trump is literally in the middle of a race war. And he's encouraging the beat down of black people. He calls them thugs. Meanwhile his gun weilding asshats are called "Patriots". You can't possibly oversee the micro aggressions.
Accidentally my fat ass! How do you make a mistake and listen to a Cardi  B song? Everyone knows who she is and what type of music she makes. Also you're pearl clutching over this but was cool with trump's "grab em by the p*ssy" comment? You should play in traffic.
In spite of the fact that you do not help Trump
NEW AD: Republican Vets Against Trump  via
Trump doesn't miss a beat, I wouldn't want to play mumblety-peg with Trump
.....Chief, gladly accepting SMEAR CAMPAIGN MATERIALS on Biden. They have ALREADY been warned by CIA &amp; other Intel that the Senators themselves r in danger of being COMPLICIT in the ACTIVE ATTEMPTS 2 INTERFERE with a POYUS ELECTION. BOY--Trump must REALLY hav the GOODS on THOSE 2
CHINA would b MASOCHISTS 2 back Trump. Same with Iran. Sounds fine! DEMS will GLADLY take China's &amp; Iran's help--now that FOREIGN HELP is OBVIOUSLY okay 2 DO now. Just ask Senators Chuck Grassley(Iowa) &amp; Ron Johnson(Wisconsin). They have been in CONTACT with Putin's Propaganda...
Good night, sleep tight no Trump dreams.
Well...Trump's NOT EXACTLY LITTLE! 280-POUNDS little!
Hell--Trump is ALREADY getting help from Putin. And HAS been ALL YEAR!
YES!  This apparently DRUNKEN POTUS Trump at tonight's Trump-Country-Club-Press-Conference DESPERATELY  NEEDS RUSSIAN HELP 2 WIN.
Trump can HAVE Vlady RUSKY!  WE  DEMS  get CHINA'S  help! AND Iran! Then maybe ALL 3 countries can take turns POUNDING the KREMLIN!
Fuck THAT! In November, Trump can FRENCH KISS Putin 2 his HEART'S CONTENT! HELL--he can MARRY the LOW-DOWN RUSKI 4 all I care. Once Biden takes over the helm on January 22, 2021, he's gonna have HIS Air Force pay Putin a little VISIT as they fire-up  the CLASSIC Beach Boys tune..
The deep state and the media have a nonsense narrative... all foreign nation, terrorist group, would like to get out Trump and America first... including Canada, Mexico and maybe England too..
Yeah, Trump only has 5000 more business practice lawsuits against him than Buffett, who‚Äôs far richer, because he‚Äôs SO innocent. He‚Äôs been a fraud his whole life!
Will Trump's DOJ then seek to have this executive order overturned in the courts?
Go in PEACE, FRIEND! And LISTEN 2 GOD! GOD doesn't happen by OSMOSIS! BELIEVE me--I know. Found out the HARD way! Actually, this all could b a BLESSING in DISGUISE! Perhaps God is PUNISHING U 4 SELLING YOR SOUL 2 TRUMP...which seeped out of U like FATALLY-POISONOUS ZYKLON-B GAS..
I'm not sure if you are to high or not high enough. The planet is melting, an ice shelf the size of Manhattan broke off today in Canada. Trump nor Biden have any kind of plan to help, let alone anything else worthy. Fuck Biden- Fuck Trump. Direct action now.

No matter what, if Trump wins or if Biden wins, Americans and the rest of the planet lose. This government is run by corporations and isn't working for the people, it is your duty to replace it.
I don't think we should attack him. I've been into this stuff since way before Q, I delve in both the red pill and black pill communities and I understand some of his concerns (if he's being genuine.) I will throw a vote to Trump any day but just be aware of all possibilities.

why would he do that, its fucking mcdonalds trump

BREAKING: Donald Trump signs Executive Order declaring the two days between Friday and Monday to be weekends.
"Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions ‚Äî a protection which already exists under Obamacare"  Yet another Executive Order that is nothing more than autographed toilet paper. He fought against ACA, then took credit for it.
Trump is not going to accept the election results. This isn't some weirdo conspiracy shit. He is trying to disrupt/suppress voting and he will have close to 3 months between his loss and when he has to leave.
Not from tRUmp.

.....like Iraq was. And Trump won't go cheap on equipment like W. Bush did in Iraq-who did so 2 keep the deficit from spiking. Trump doesn't CARE about a spiking deficit. He DOES care about WINNING the war...&amp; ACQUIRING that oil. He will need a MILITARY DRAFT 2 beat Iran.......
Curious on your thoughts on the election.  Do you think Biden is the better candidate?  I didn‚Äôt vote for trump and haven‚Äôt voted for  a Republican President yet.  So you support the liberals pick for president and all his racist statements?
Lol Trump just gave you that $600 extension until the end of the year.  No one needs Biden
Well any idiot voting for trump is a lost cause. Dont waste your breath talking to them. There are reasons every day for past 5 years that prove he is unfit. Michigan is a disgrace

Yeah the Dems want $2 trillion for New York and California‚Äôs poorly run shit shows.  Trump is extending the unemployment benefits $600 a week until end of the year, stopping payroll tax, no evictions, student debt relief.  It‚Äôs not republicans messing up the negotiations.
I don't get it. Are Trump supporters running out of arguments or are they just getting dumber. This was just plain stupid.

It's true! Basically he tied the hands of the Democrats from holding up this legislation. So they'll either put something together that looks like his or Trump will sign an executive order on those items
....thinking about commandeering those oil wells. Trump's lust 4 MASSIVE WEALTH will find him OBSESSED with those oil wells...&amp; war with Iran--whom Trump doesn't RESPECT as a TOUGH FOE. Which they ARE--BIG time: MUCH BIGGER COUNTRY; &amp; a BIGGER, BETTER MILITARY. NO cakewalk.....
This mentality. This is what happened in 2016. People felt both candidates were awful but people voted for trump bc they thought hillary was worse. Really. We would not have had the circus with hillary in office. Like her or not. Once again people will keep trump in office.
Im done with watching secupp. How ignorant and absurd. Countless times criticizing trump and now she will write someone in if she does not like vp pick.  WTH.
If a black American is truly serious about voting for Joe Biden over Donald Trump they are truly betraying their own race and keeping their disenfranchisement.
The alternative is trump. Give me a break
He just got kicked off Illinois ballot for fake signatures. He is using the same lady that got trump his signatures.smh

He is just showing his true nature. He's a scumbag parading as a man of God. Just like his buddy Trump. His dad is rolling over in his grave.

Trump defends the Confederacy. Alexander Stephens, Vice President of the Confederacy, said the "Cornerstone rests upon the great truth, that the negro is not equal to the white man." White supremacist?
You're serious? This isn't witty at all. Comparing Trump &amp; GW Bush is nuts. W believed in the international liberal order. So did Obama. Before Trump, Obama and Bush became friends. Obama, younger and more liberal, shook things up, but was a largely traditional POUTS, as was W.
The post is right - in their mind "any system that makes it possible for Donald Trump to be more successful than moi, must be a mistake and therefore, ripe for dismantling".
1-2-3 Que the Trump tweet about he hardy knows  but wishes him well. And about how unfairly he has been treated.

Biden and the DNC have chosen "Uniting America"...The theme for the DNC's unprecedented virtual convention is meant to show a sharp contrast to Trump, who Democrats say has divided the nation amid one of the nation's most trying periods.
if you are seriously asking, here is the serious answer: Donald Trump dying from Covid-19.  Of course, President Pence would be trying to create a Theocracy to enshrine his bizarre beliefs in law.
They should give Trump peyote, then turn on the Coyotes game. Then tell him Mexico got a hockey team send tweet
This doesn't sound crazy now, since China wants Trump out they unleash this virus to get him out. They knew Trump would be unprepared and 4 more years of him would put China in a serious recession. Trump is bad for business worldwide.Trump‚Äôs visit is fouling up there emergency 9.

Trump only went to Penn-Wharton for his last two years of undergrad. He went to Fordham for first two years after high school. Transferred to Penn with help of dad. He couldn‚Äôt get into Wharton from high school.
And you tweet this as Trump is trying to BAN #tiktoc because creative teens schooled his fat ass about Tulsa   So  just which 1st Amendment are you preaching to the choir about?  Does Nestor have Tik To?
Let's keep our footing on solid ground. Biden is not perfect, probably no white person is when it comes to representing blacks. However, Biden is much better than Trump.
I did not realize black voters  appointed Trump as their spokesperson.
Yeaaaa, no he hasn‚Äôt
Polls are likely to continue to tighten as the election draws nearer and Trump's misinformation machine churns on. We cannot get complacent, and we must do everything we can to reach voters.
I agree. Looks like Noam Chomsky does too.

For the umpteenth time.  Wishing maxwell well is not in any way evidence of Trump being a pedo.  Why must you die on that hill? He also said let the government prove the charges.  That‚Äôs the right approach to take and probably all he should have said.
Well finally something we can agree on...Trump was unwise in wishing her well...precisely because people like you will take it as evidence he‚Äôs a pedo.  But he says and tweets alot of unwise things.  That doesn‚Äôt mean his statement was sympathetic to her alleged crimes.

Wayne LaPierre is in big trouble. So is NRA. Good news if proven. She has strong information. Trump will claim he doesn‚Äôt know him. Can‚Äôt recall. Can‚Äôt remember. Going to jail probably.
That's code for black people living in inner cities. One thing Trump knows is at least 50% of his voters are on some level racist and loyal to him. I guarantee he can call black people the N word on national TV and won't lose one vote. In fact, he might even gain a few votes.
Good news. She will go after Trump in time. NRA in trouble. And officers.

HOWEVER, some people asked whether this could be due to the red states ramping up testing (i.e., Trump's "more tests = more cases!" logic). It's true that this would at least make it *look* like there were "more" cases.  So I decided to check.
Being Trump's enemy might not be fatal but being his friend? That invites disaster.    The man has no loyalties. He can't have a dog because no dog would have him.

I‚Äôll be incorporating the blue/red ratio into my daily updates going forward. It sucks that we even have to think about it in these terms but Trump has given us no choice. State and national POLICY is being based on it.
Some people will just stay home with more chaos..just what Trump wants
Michigan. Trump 2020
Ha Ha. Trump even jolted our racism awareness- for the better!  Unintended good consequences.
Woa! Not just the post, but held his account!  Ballsy
So tell me again how Trump wished Maxwell well on ‚Äúchild sex trafficking charges‚Äù.  Just add the words you want to believe you read to what Trump actually said.  Trump‚Äôs  real view on the charges was the correct one...let the government prove them.
#FacebookCensorship  Seriously.  How long is this going to be allowed to go on?
As for wishing the best for Maxwell....again what exactly does that prove?  You guys simply don‚Äôt have a pedo case to make vs Trump.  Remember, it‚Äôs your burden to prove Trump is a pedo.  You have not come anywhere close to meeting that burden.
This is how you roll...say Trump ‚Äúexposed‚Äù Epstein before Epstein could ‚Äúexpose‚Äù Trump. Implication...Trump gets Epstein investigated for being a pedo before Epstein can get Trump investigated for being a pedo.  That‚Äôs how you want people to see it.  That is NOT what was written.
No accusations?  The intent of your posts is clearly to lead the reader to conclude Trump is a Pedo.  &amp; don‚Äôt put words into my mouth.  Never called Biden a pedo.  I said there is more basis in that one video to conclude Biden is a pedo than you guys have to say the same of Trump
Lena was a Trump cultist also. Trump cultists really don‚Äôt go over well with the majority of people in M11.
Just explained to my family that I can‚Äôt vote for trump or Biden because neither of them made Late Registration. Neither of them could make a record like Yeezus. My uncle asked me if I was on crack
Thank you Trump very cool!
So the guy who posts that he is a ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù first, is calling Halley Steven‚Äôs names. Great strategy Eric. Fits right in with Breitbart and Trump. Is that how you are teaching your sons to treat women? And I understand you want to totally eliminate the ACA.
Trump‚Äôs evil ineptitude and narcissism has cost my country it‚Äôs standing in the world. Not listening to others more knowledgeable (a rather low bar) and lead through a pandemic has cost 1000s of American lives. His violation of all things law &amp; order is abhorrent. #LincolnVoter
Facebook removes Trump post over coronavirus misinformation #SmartNews
Long overdue. "Facebook removes first coronavirus misinformation post by Trump"
Interesting...another "ex-GOP sickened by what the GOP has become" organization. Note that they're not just going after Trump, they're also pledging to help take out his GOP sycophant enablers as well, which of course is a Good Thing¬Æ.
I'm aware of President Trump making that accusation against Michigan SoS, Jocelyn Benson. I can't speak for other states, but I can tell you with absolutely certainty that here in Michigan every registered voter received a ballot request application, not an unsolicited ballot.
Facebook removes Trump post over coronavirus misinformation about children being immune from CV19.
My post would be "Chomping at the bit to cast my vote to re-elect Donald Trump. The greatest president in US History!"
So I have been thinking hard about your logic here. BUT I think I get now. Come Nov, if Trump wins, results can be legally challenged in court, that Trump really LOST election because of mail-in voter fraud. Not that the results will need to be challenged.  #MailInVoting
Your profile says you live in Colorado.   Colorado is the gold standard when it comes to mail in voting.  Election fraud is rare. President Trump is promoting a false narrative because he is behind in most election polls. He's planting a seed to cast doubt on the election results
In 2016 Trump running opposed got about 480,000 votes Joe Biden, even with people still voting for Bernie Sanders who got 500,000 votes, just got over 800,000.
Corona fascism?  Is that Trump‚Äôs political philosophy?
Mitch, turn your hearing aids up. The Democrats don't want to fund revamping the FBI building so the Trump Hotel can benefit from it. They want business held accountable for providing a safe work environment. They want local government and health care providers compensated.
Why should he take it...because Trump did? Trump and the Trumpanzees are senseless
And you are bowing to, or blowing Donald Trump.
So you're saying, I want to be clear I understand you. You are NOT taking any responsibility for the excessive deaths, from the covid virus, ie Trump administration and your personal efforts or "lack thereof" in controlling the spread of covid-19 &amp; providing Federal support
you have to generating more trump vids. We need him to sink faster in the polls. How about you being interviewed by J. Swan from Axios. trump gave u a lotta material with those charts.
Why are you talking about name calling? Trump has called everyone out of the name. Give me a break!
Clump. Trump. Obama. Well, Chuck Grassley, which one said it? #ClumpTrumpObama
If one reporter can demolish Trump, where are the rest?Get some people who can ask tough questions and not accept bullshit answers.
The Lincoln Project understands that Trump‚Äôs enablers must pay a price
Which is why Catholics who voted for Trump will suffer mightily in hell.
The next question to Trump should have been..how many times a day are you tested..how many times a day is anyone in the Trump family tested..
Val Demings: Remember Senate Republicans who dismissed Trump‚Äôs wrongdoing ‚Äî and show them the door
One more thing and then this is over.  There is more basis to claim Biden is a pedo in this vid than everything you and your Trump is a pedo cohorts have come up with in these tweets.
As though election interference by Trump and Barr isn‚Äôt enough foreign interference has Sen.Blumenthal alarmed enough to shout out!  2020...where will it end?
Just like you guys have nothing to prove Trump‚Äôs past relationship with Epstein makes him a pedo.  No guilt by association in this country right?  BTW, you think if there was a credible pedo case vs Trump that the Dems, NYT, WaPo, etc., wouldn‚Äôt have made it by now?
And the facts you point out show what?  You are implying that the real estate deal is the reason Trump banned Epstein from Mar a Lago...as opposed to Epstein‚Äôs sexual misconduct.  To me the court filing supporting the latter makes more sense.
Trump is a fake president!
Look, the whole debate here is over the attempts you guys are making to establish that Trump is a pedo because of his past social and/or business relationship with Epstein.  Neither Trump nor I have to prove otherwise.  You guys have that burden..and you‚Äôve failed.
You‚Äôve earned it baby......now let‚Äôs get TRUMP OUTTA THERE!!!!
Trump has been bankrupt many times in his life, but his properties jumped up from every bankruptcy. He totally screwed up anybody who cooperated with him. Now he has been gradually screwed up the entire nation of USA! He will be richer! He has been building up his empire palace
üò¢So very sad üôèüôè Trump has Navajo blood on his hands!

That's cool you're not voting for Trump then
Because in the world that we live in, school is going to open in the fall. Trump won't let those policies pass, therefore it's stupid to put the economy over kids and their parent's lives.
He wants to make himself look good for his non-existent future in politics, but too cowardly to publicly oppose Trump for his non-existent future in politics.
Those countries also have already existing infrastructure and much smaller general class sizes. Not to mention that even if Dems could pass it as soon as possible, Trump would still be President as Fall comes around. It makes literally zero sense unless you live in fantasy land.
Even Trump said, he knows he will get sued.
They‚Äôre going to get Trump elected... Again. That‚Äôs basically their only real purpose.
Republicans have set us back 30 years. Mitch McConnell and the Trump Administration are two of the worst things that have ever happened to this country.
Trump prevented nothing. By the time dimwit Donnie stopped flights from China, it was already here. 40,000 people came into the country after, many from the Wuhan district. Oh, and it been determined that the virus here came from Europe. They don't tell you that on fux noise.

A rant about how Trump pronounced it correctly
This is an interesting poll, the question was will there be a vaccine, not whether you trust the Trump admin‚Äôs good faith in releasing an efficacious vaccine.
Why does it seem like the Trump campaign hired those scammers who would generate those Nigerian prince email scams to create their campaign emails?
First, Biden wasn‚Äôt President. Second, you mean Trump did more in 3 years to destroy this country
What absolutely drives me nuts about this is every single person, whether you‚Äôre a Trump supporter or not, KNOWS the only reason this is happening is Trump wants to sabotage mail-in voting. It‚Äôs so fucking obvious!
Every one of the 150,000+ deaths from the virus are on Trump's hands because of his lacking. Every life SAVED here in MI, is because of you. You're our hero. We just got you! As brilliant a V.P. as you'd be, we cant give you up! #PLEASE STAY
I fucking hate saying this AGAIN... we‚Äôre in ANOTHER constitutional crisis. The Post Office is a constitutionally mandated institution the Trump administration is actively sabotaging in real time.

Trump says he needs the Yo-Semites votes to win.
DON'T LIKE THE WAY TRUMP IS DOING IT NO OTHER PRESIDENT WOULD DO IT
So terribly sad to see what's become of this country.  True patriotism is dead.
Google it. I'm not saying who's right or wrong but she may have ulterior motives. I hate to think that but according to Google, no trump has ever served and I'd heard that before.
Trump invents his supposed rights out of thin air. Trouble is, his Republican allies believe ‚Äúmight makes right‚Äù! They‚Äôd scream and holler and fight tooth and nail if the tables were turned.
Huge News: This should be a parody account.  Side bar: Same dude that tweeted a picture of Trump‚Äôs  America saying it could be Biden‚Äôs America. Existing conditions? Obama did it first and did it better! Donnie needs a diaper change.
I don't even know if you'll see this, but I'm gonna take a wild guess as to why you blocked me. You liked my post, but then saw my profile and saw that I'm anti-Trump and support BLM. Accurate?
I‚Äôm convinced any voter fooled by such a tactic was already gonna vote for Trump.
Bro Wtf. It's bad enough that we have Trump and Devos spewing this bs but now the most powerful Democrat in the senate is too? Get this fool out of here.

If you actually read the stories about this you'll see that Wheeler mentions that he's afraid that Trump will use this (the riots and attempted murder) to his advantage.  Wheeler doesn't care about the cops.  He's worried about Trump getting re-elected.

Do you EVER criticize vile lying Trump???
"That he‚Äôs okay with siphoning off Black votes from the Democratic nominee, thus helping Trump. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not denying it, I just told you. To say that the Black vote is Democratic is a form of racism and white supremacy.‚Äù"
Trump wants to dictate! And all too often we let him.
priceless..This qualifies him to be an official Trump son..
Trump and his administration are pathetic
Trump is not perfect - I think he says these things to get a rise out of liberals. My brother did it to me and my father would tell me - ignore it if it is not true. You guys fall for it every time.
Actually... the CCP wants trump to lose because they want their citizens to get back to working and stop laughing all the time!
Joe Biden doesn't act like he knows more than the health experts. Trump ignores the health experts which causes confusion. We need a president who doesn't think he's "a natural". #COVID19 #Coronavirus #JoeBiden #TrumpHoaxedAmerica

Yes my dear he most certainly is I don't know if you're old enough to remember Joe McCarthy everyone was a communist in his book and I do mean everyone. I fully expect one day to see mr. Trump institutionalized in a place for the clinically insane
Not trying to b that dude but why is trump going after fucking video game developers lol, aren‚Äôt police still killing black men and women for no good reason at all daily??? Like Jesus priorities man priorities
Let's keep our footing on solid ground. Biden is not perfect, probably no white person is when it comes to representing blacks. However, Biden is much better than Trump.
I did not realize black voters  appointed Trump as their spokesperson.
Funny how Trumpists have to change their defense of Trump from ‚Äúhe might be rich but he‚Äôs just like the common man‚Äù to ‚Äúthose lowly degenerates can‚Äôt grasp his massive big boy brain‚Äù
I got news for Donald Trump he claims to be a man of God in fact he said God chose him to leave the country, but he should read a little farther because in that Bible it says beware of false prophets
Amen to that!! Trump is the devil and he has made our country hell
People are losing their homes at an alarming rate I can't imagine how Donald Trump can sit in his Ivory tower and make remarks about how wonderful the country is doing the man is a flaming fool
Just remember Mr. Trump that the Chinese companies you put tariffs on aren‚Äôt paying the tariffs the American people who purchase the goods are paying it!!! Stop the lies!! Unless that is what you believe and you are just STUPID!!!!!
Excellent.  ...briefed by military in 2017 on levels American and Russian nuclear arsenals reduced...Trump demanded US increase its nuclear stockpile tenfold. According to some reports, this was what prompted the Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, to call the president a ‚Äúmoron.‚Äù

The most comical part about Trump attacking Biden on his religion is the fact that the attacks are coming from a thrice married philandering thief who raped his first wife and laughed about a man bleeding out on the floor.
I hope not.  She can lie as good as trump
Wait God is a black woman! That‚Äôs not God‚Äòs hand so it must be Satan! I knew it! Trump followers are all part of the largest Satanic cult the worlds ever seen! And I have proof! They‚Äôre all satanists just you wait, the truth will come out soon!

You might wanna double check that. No member of Trump's immediate family has EVER served in the military. I would think his brother would be considered immediate family.
There are a lot of gross people in the Trump administration that I‚Äôm excited to never hear from again. The Schlapps are up there.

Ok bud, I think we‚Äôve beaten this to death.  Although I disagree with you on the Trump is a pedo claim you are implicitly making, I wish you well.  That‚Äôs all I have to say to you.
For the umpteenth time.  Wishing maxwell well is not in any way evidence of Trump being a pedo.  Why must you die on that hill? He also said let the government prove the charges.  That‚Äôs the right approach to take and probably all he should have said.
Well finally something we can agree on...Trump was unwise in wishing her well...precisely because people like you will take it as evidence he‚Äôs a pedo.  But he says and tweets alot of unwise things.  That doesn‚Äôt mean his statement was sympathetic to her alleged crimes.
And what is the clear evidence you saw with your own eyes in that interview that Trump is a pedo.  Please don‚Äôt make it up.
We‚Äôre talking about Trump, so to him I‚Äôm sure ‚Äúeviction protections‚Äù means protecting landlords from being litigated for mass evictions.
Look, I‚Äôm not tied to anything but saying that your posts are the injustice here because you are trying to label the president a pedo on no substantive evidence.  You can believe what you want...but ask yourself if those beliefs simply reflect hatred of Trump.
Make sure he gives trump a big fat kiss.
Oh the rest of the world should rely on what you saw in Trump‚Äôs eyes?  Man that‚Äôs twisted.
We‚Äôre talking about people who elevated Donald Trump as their fascist figurehead, these people are detached from reality.
Why not? She's shutting down the NRA. Trump Org is next.
You said Trump wished her well on the pedo charges.  You simply made that up.  Whether there is evidence to convict her has nothing to do with What Trump said nor in any way suggests he‚Äôs a pedo.
All good questions. I also heard that people didn't fill it out because Trump or Biden wasn't on it. Lots of voters are in the habit of ignoring primaries or misunderstanding them.
Trump, moron or sadist? I've heard it both ways.

When I c a big Pharma ad against u I think ‚ÄúThank U Grandma 4  being so smart &amp; strong,instilling in me at a young age the ability to recognize people like Trump for the racist,sexist, misogynistic,crooked,lying conman he is&amp;not 2b blinded by their money&amp;power.‚ÄùShe despised him.
They are both nearly equally terrible, obviously Trump is worse for human rights. But they're both pedos and in Trumps case a definite rapist. Biden could be as well we just don't know yet. And Biden is a huge unknown, he could be worse than we even imagined if he wins.
Yeah, I totally get that get that. And Trump is definitely a worse person than Biden, my tweet was mostly just referring to the fact that IF we had Trump another 4 years at least we'd be done with him after that.
Notice Trump never tweets about your interviews
That's not how I feel, I was just making a statement. I definitely don't prefer Trump to Biden.............. And I wasn't 100% serious about the Bernie tweet. It's Twitter.......  I really have no idea what to do so don't judge based on two tweets.
You gotta to be Bobo the Clown not to see that Kanye is Trump‚Äôs straw candidate to pull away some black votes.  A vote for Kanye is a Vote for Trump.  It‚Äôs sad that people would take advantage of a obviously mentally sick person.  But nothing is too low for this administration.
Not to mention, wasn‚Äôt there an article several months ago that the Wisconsin governor had made the decision that only trump would be listed on ballots for Republicans?

A SNL skit about a delusional headline writer might be funny but in real life it screams I've no credibility but want attention. The nature of intel gathering makes it murky so there's rarely a consensus. Labeling it disputed here is only about an inconvenient narrative to Trump.

Get Biden for America.. #Biden_is_Trump_vaccine
Two reasons for it.  1. Trump said he liked it, so the press and the deep state has to be against it.  2. Its a cheap drug, so big pharma want you to take something more expensive.  I hope people will open their eyes on the deep state, big pharma and fake studies.
Yea I think the move there would be to say it‚Äôs a deep fake video...which given that it‚Äôs coming from Russia is entirely plausible. The problem with stuff from Russia is you can‚Äôt trust anything whether you like or hate Trump.
You need never apologize if you are omniscient (though I'd like to hear Trump try to pronounce the word)

My beef is with Trump not you. We did need to shut down for a short period of time to stop the spread, what needed to happen was a real man in the white house with a plan for testing and treatment that would have ended the lockdown sooner.

I tend to agree for the most part, but I don't care that Biden is "old" so long as he is a democrat he has my vote and any other "D" I can vote for.  We have to get Trump and as many Republicans out in order to undo this nightmare.

People are irate because it shouldn‚Äôt matter who Biden picks as VP. A decent person can look at the two choices that we have - Trump or Biden - and choose Biden without hesitation, no matter what. Because Trump is NEVER an acceptable choice.
Not 160,000 loss. He's had six months to make this right and he's done nothing not a goddamn thing. So get off the Trump bandwagon. He should have locked down this country he should get National testing which he's had plenty of opportunities to do and he hasn't.

They think they operate in a free market beforehand, but don't seem to understand that forcing oil companies to buy corn for ethanol fuel is a hand-out. When Trump stopped that for their "free market", they all lost money and had to grow soybeans.
There is justification for thinking that some farmers really are mush for brains. They do not understand reality. They are willing to lose money on the ideology that created all their problems because they think he has some kind of secret plan.
Can't stop thinking about those fools in that Dirty Money episode 'Slumlord Millionaire" who were living in a home in disrepair own by Jared Kushner but still thought Trump was great.

Hogan, read the 12/2010 law that Trump &amp; GOP have tried to repeal. H.R.3590 - Patient Protection  Affordable Care Act, Sec. 1201, as modified by Sec. 10103) is ONLY LAW that covers Pre-existing conditions   #Obamacare

Trump is actively trying to destroy a beloved, useful institution and somewhere around 40% of the country still gives him two thumbs up, very cool
This is why we know Trump says it like it is. Stop proving him right Jim! Are you that naive? Don't you have some sort a record now for bending the news to fit your political beliefs? Are you a reporter, or activist, posing as a journalist? Try writing a few positive stories?
If anyone made it political it was Trump. He just does not get it, that politics is not a meant as a skill to keep people fooled. If Trump had not destroyed the economy it took a long time to rebuild, and had allowed 160k people to lose their lives because he feared his base.Weak
Trump already created more Jobs than any President since Ronald Reagan. You Democrats did not. Guess what? 2.8 Million people went back to work in July. 14.7% unemployment 2 months ago. 10.2 percent now. In 3 months we will be back to low levels again. Thanks to

Michigan used to be covert in its racism(not that this was a good thing), but there are some that are totally out in the open in the age of Trump.  He thinks BLM is taking away "his" country.  This is why systemic racism is the issue.
Donald Trump directly is responsible for these deaths. When a president speaks,  even a terrible one,  there will be people who listen and take them literally
Wow. How disgusting. I can‚Äôt wait until we vote Trump out and wipe the arrogant smile off this criminal‚Äôs face. This person, US Attorney General, is CAMPAIGNING for Trump!! #RemoveBillBarr
Why is the new jobs report being touted as a win? Are Trump supporters so desperate for a win that they consider the record high unemployment he caused by pretending COVID was a hoax, dropping to just barely below record high unemployment, means he‚Äôs a great leader?
Conservatism can come back in response to a new Democratic President without changing much:  In power, it amounts to deficit-financed tax cuts &amp; a lighter liberal advance. But that hasn‚Äôt stopped its power as a backlash movement the next time
The backlash future for the Republicans is given short shrift here because Brooks doesn‚Äôt recognize that the failure to translate a positive policy vision is endemic. It doesn‚Äôt have to be economically or policy focused; it can rely on thermostatic public

If this is true - then Trump wins.  Not my opinion. There's simply no historical record where a "Biden/Rice" ticket wins in 2020.   This is straight from #TheDirector which is the quantum AI from the reality TV show #Travelers

I would‚Äôve said that he won‚Äôt appoint conservative judges‚Äî until the DNC decided to host John Kasich, so who knows ü§¶üòÇ  Although imo the one thing Biden has going for him is a $2T climate plan- it‚Äôs no Green New Deal, but it‚Äôs better than Trump selling parks to big oil

But either way.. we will all see soon enough.. right? But Trump will win 2020
They report the same thing all other news media outlets report. I usually refer to independents and AP, NPR, the Hill, etc.  Right-wing media reports on what trump wants to hear, and what the racist commentators say: hannity, tucker, ingraham, rush limbaugh, etc. Too many to list
The best book Trump read after being elected was. . The Idiots Guide To Being President. He also read a book by Putin,.  How To Engage Enemies With Silly Talk
"Buy America‚Äù mandates that federal purchases of certain medical supplies and equipment deemed essential." Odd that we reward the US industry who variably charges more to American customers than to foreign customers.

Prediction is almost useless and pride is toxic. Two decades of pandemic war games failed to account for Donald Trump

A colleague of mine died this morning. People ask when will Trump have a national day of mourning. He‚Äôs incapable of having one. We need to hold on until #JoeBiden gets sworn in. I think it will be meaningful and genuine. We all just need to stop and grieve on that day. üíî
The fake candidate trump claims to be running against is my ideal candidate.  Abolish ice, abolish police, no borders, godless, destroy capitalism.
Trump won the 2016 election at the 2nd debate. After that it was over. Not to mention Biden is getting worse, did you see the cognitive decline video from the other day?
He made it policy to not allow trans people in the military.  He supports removing job protections, what little we have, from work places.  Just look up trump and anti trans and you'll see all that him and his cabinet has done to oppose trans rights.
Trump has been practicing in front a mirror to much.   Trump accuses Biden in Rant: He‚Äôll ‚ÄòHurt the Bible, Hurt God. He‚Äôs Against God.‚Äô   "When Donald J Trump's mouth is open and his lips are moving then he's lying"
In one breath, Trump claims #JoeBiden will hurt God, hurt the Bible, and against guns. God is a God of war and those who oppress his people. So  God is against you! Someone needs to ask Trump to point to scripture in the Bible.
Our man from Queens sends him a check for $10,000. A rabbi's critically ill son needs to get from NYC to California for specialty care. No airlines will fly him. The generous man uses his private jet to fly the child. This kind man us  Donald J Trump. Our awesome President üá∫üá∏
If Biden isn't going to do well in Ohio why is Trump there?
This is how ignorant  No one can hurt God! If anyone hurts the Bible it‚Äôs Trump when he used it as a prop in front of a church! I don‚Äôt know how these so-called evangelicals can support this heathen!  He is a walking/talking abomination to the Word of God. #Ohio
Its amazing how this would be on every news channel nationwide had Trump said it.
one of the best, most succinct ways I've heard Trump supporters summarized: "they don't like him for the good things he's done for them. They like him for the cruel things he's done to others".   I really think it's that simple about 99% of the time.
Liberals are pouring it on thicker this time. When they polled me I told them I'm voting for Biden, but I'm really voting for Trump. Check out Trump followers on Facebook and Twitter for both candidates. Trump has millions more followers than Biden. Trump 2020!
Michelle suffering depression 'over Trump's hypocrisy'
I think it‚Äôs even stranger considering Biden is a practicing Catholic and Trump has yet to attend any regular services.
always comes with the straight-up unadulterated truth! Americans are hurting! We are tired of Trump immaturity and buffoonery! People need shelter and food. His stupidity does not help the situation!
They‚Äôre Trump Christians. They support a self admitted sexual assaulter, who cages children for the pure cruelty of it. Trump Christians are anti truth, science, decency etc,.
The saddest part is that this was a similar tactic used against Clinton and it worked - mostly because every single news org kept reporting it and conspiracy theorists wouldn't shut up about doctored photographs.  In terms of policies, Trump has nothing. Like the Axios interview.
Ain't this something.. Trump campaign is watching this one i bet.. smh
Yesterday the Trump adminstration literally photoshopped Biden praying at Church to look like he was mentally and physically exhausted.  The only 2 tactics Trump has against Biden is to try and make others think he's against God and has dementia ("Sleepy" Biden). That's legit it.
The Clinton Foundation stole $6 Billion from the money that was donated to rebuild Haiti. The Haitian people protested the Clintons for 6 years &amp; the media ignored them. Obama was asked by many groups to get involved &amp; he looked the other way  BTW, I abhor Trump.

We‚Äôre like moments away from people using  as an excuse for supporting Trump somehow.   Get over your hate.
I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll get through to trump supporters using logic, math, and science Unfortunately. Numbers can be hard for some people.
In other words,  is a liar:
Y'all, stop conflating conservative/liberal with left/right wing ideology. Left/right is your political belief. Liberal/conservative is how radical you feel about you political views. Trump republicans are the liberal right. They want extreme change to move rightward.

And FYI, trump inherited a rising economy from Obama/Biden. He did nothing to earn that himself. Just like he enherited his fortune from his father. And much like he bankrupted most of his business ventures he‚Äôs bankrupting the country. He‚Äôs a perfect circle of failure.
He didn‚Äôt CAUSE the pandemic but trump and his administration botched the response to it. Encouraging his crowd to not wear masks, encouraging states to remain open/reopen too soon, lying and saying US is lowest in deaths when we have 25% of the worlds covid deaths. Incompetence
Trump: ‚ÄòI‚Äôm doing the country a big favor‚Äô with my conspiracy theories about voter fraud   If Trump Really wanted to do America a Favor.... He'd slither back in the dark slimy hole he came out of.
Chatfield said  ‚Äúrefuses‚Äù to say he doesn‚Äôt support defunding police, but Biden did just that at a virtual fundraiser last night.

No one‚Äôs voting for Biden because they‚Äôre upset. 1) it‚Äôs hilarious u think Biden has dementia but trump has no mental decomposition. 2) even if trump isn‚Äôt mentally compromised by a disease, his lack of intelligence, empathy, and compassion are the reasons I won‚Äôt vote for him.
I don't think you want to go that route. They tried 'tests' for voting,  like a reading test. You can't disenfranchise someone based on how you perceive their intelligence,  otherwise Trump wouldn't have a single vote

I'm not spooked by another 4 years of Trump as worst case scenario, he'd just cause the civil war he accused Hillary of sparking, but unlike her, he won't know how to bluff to save his life
What that does that even mean?  The Trump flock were the ones not listening to the government and he was encouraging it.  When Governors were trying to lockdown and get things under control President Tweets was out there encouraging people to not obey and protest it.

China is solidly behind its business partner,Donald Trump.
His support is much stronger than his polls, that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre gonna get spanked. Democrats have rigged themselves into thinking they‚Äôve been winning this whole time. 62% of the country say they‚Äôre scared to say who they support (Trump) &amp; that doesn‚Äôt include the brave onesüß®üí•
Trump prevented nothing. By the time dimwit Donnie stopped flights from China, it was already here. 40,000 people came into the country after, many from the Wuhan district. Oh, and it been determined that the virus here came from Europe. They don't tell you that on fux noise.
Trump knows nothing about Corona virus.
The tide appears to be turning... Trump knows Americans won‚Äôt take the long way home to avoid the bully for too long before we‚Äôll team up &amp; fight back. He‚Äôs been sizing up the situation, waiting for us to signal him we‚Äôre ready to stand up. You hear it? He does. Cheers. Finally.

Im sorry I can‚Äôt support this we deserve better than this. Trump must be taken out but so does the majority of the Republican party and the Dems who have enabled him.
Honestly in the Settle with Biden and this Vote Trump Out shit bothers me why are progressives doing the work for him when he and his campaign should be doing the work.
Do you have proof the ballots are illegal or are you just repeating Trump?  Just because an application is sent to a deceased person doesn‚Äôt mean they got a ballot. I‚Äôm glad we voted so everyone will have a means to vote without being disinfranchised.

Trump‚Äôs constant lying,is disrespectful,to the flag,and to the troops who have fought bravely,to protect it.

Right. This is the guy I'm assuming knows everything trump does he has to. It's baffling to me nobody has questioned him on his knowledge. They keep going after the big fish that they can't catch maybe if some others start feeling the heat they'll change their tune.
I don‚Äôt think anybody is advising him I think they are just letting him do whatever he wants. The campaign seems to not care their whole thing is we got to get Trump out vote for Biden cause he‚Äôs not Trump and that should be good enough it‚Äôs all very entitled and out of touch.
Yes I would . You should too. Unless you‚Äôre all talk about Trump. That‚Äôs the problem. People have gotten lazey.

So vote Trump out by giving Biden the nomination even though he did not deserve it and then make demands after he is elected as if Biden as if he is going to do anything what is this shit.
Biden won‚Äôt even debate or be at the convention. I hate Trump I think he is garbage but how is doing the work for Biden and his campaign going to push him to the left Biden keeps being given everything he also keeps getting free passes for barely doing nothing.

These demonic DemocRATS are totally disgusting to our Nation and National Security. The Obama Cabal had their crosshairs aimed at Trump from the very beginning. And when he WON, it is OBVIOUS that this IS a Coup d'e'tat. No question. Because Trump WON. And Biden knew about it too
Not very many &amp; the media doesn‚Äôt help at all. How many people do you hear blaming Trump for every Covid death. The media knows nobody really pays attention so they keep repeating their lies to convince them.
Have you always wanted one of our ICONIC Make America Great Again Hats?  Well, you‚Äôre in luck. President Trump just hand-signed one of them and, because you‚Äôve always been one of his best supporters, he specifically requested that it go to YOU.
He‚Äôs a bold &amp; successful business man which makes him easy to attack but, he‚Äôs done way more for people in this country than I ever have. More than most. He‚Äôs got our interests in mind w/protecting our rights &amp; freedoms. Trump gets rid of dumb rules instead of making them. DT2020
At least don‚Äôt vote at all. You can‚Äôt really want Biden. 40yr career politician who‚Äôs never actually helped anyone but himself unless it was a coincidence. So crooked he can‚Äôt talk straight anymore &amp; There‚Äôs videos of him being ‚Äústrange‚Äù w/kids. Trump‚Äôs gotten really bad press.

You know, given the completely indefensible nature of what Trump is doing, it wasn‚Äôt a bad answer.    It was bs, of course, but far from the worst bs she has spread.
Look, you cannot bring up Biden‚Äôs name in Michigan without eliciting a laugh and a shake of the head. Remember things were going very well before the COVID-19 virus. Everything that the hi-jacked Democratic Party has schemed against Trump has failed miserably.
Hate Trump, Hate the Republicans, it is your right, and you also have an absolute right to be stupid, seems you are more interested in your absolute right to stupidity. Racism is real, but the only thing you‚Äôre proving is SYSTEMIC IGNORANCE, is rampant.
That is the best thing I have heard all day Trump is a genius there were some hiccups at the beginning that was due to fake news and Democratic hoax Trump has done a great job managing the China virus he gives himself a 10 we need to slow down testing to have fewer casesCelebs taking the time to bash trump but not speak on the sex ring issue are gross ‚ùåü§Æ get your priotirities straight and stop spreading lies abt a pres who literally is working to save America and ALL the children !!

We all know about the Russian bounties placed on US soldiers heads. Trump literally said No one is more militaristic than him. Well we know that answer now don't we?

Membership cost for Bedminster Golf Club where Trump had his rant tonight - $350,000  So the 'forgotten men and women of America' that he's fighting so hard for are ones that can cough up $350,000 to join a golf club  Dont fall for the con and vote for Joe Nov 3  #ONEV1
It's another great thing he's done even though it was already done under the Obama administration....  Are you really that naive and gullible?  So far the trump supporters applauding this move has lowered the national IQ.
üòÇüòÇüòÇSo sneaky...so when he is indicted the press can say, ‚ÄòTrump told Barr to prosecute.‚Äô
I think you mean "done". FYI, all trump has done is make a mess and make this country look and act bad.
Biden and Trump side by side isn‚Äôt close. Is biden as sharp as he once was? No way. But side by side? Not close. I don‚Äôt understand tweets like this.
Check your facts.  It's part of the affordable care act under Obama. It's nothing more than grandstanding by trump.  Ordering something that's already covered??  Impressive action by the moron......

Did you see that video where the Trump sign had a little voltage to it? Lol
Don't vote for trump~
I would be really really surprised if they had another "March" in Portland tonight. Maybe 20 people will show up after last night and Trump's threat to send the guard in.

Trump is 100% trying to steal/discredit the election.  For the people who say Trump can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt stay in office, he‚Äôs doing illegal shit in front of your eyes &amp; getting away w/it. Doing everything he can to win &amp; staying even if he loses is the natural next step of all of this BS
Go President Trump!!!!

"It is a testament to how thoroughly Trump‚Äôs norm-shattering, autocratic leadership has permeated Washington that even the sleepy Post Office has become politicized"
You're way dimmer than I ever thought. Stupid question. In absolutely no way is Donald Trump qualified or worthy of being president. Shouldn't be an issue whatsoever.
Got it. The ACA, in my opinion, was a first step to universal health care. I‚Äôm hoping Trump‚Äôs term doesn‚Äôt set us back too far. Canada did it. It took years. It‚Äôs complicated but a decent US govt could accomplish it I think.

I‚Äôll grant the first (although not so much for small businesses...and his terrifs etc have actually hurt) and fight to the death on the second. Abortion is up 4% under Trump, and that‚Äôs just the starting point, because life is more than birth.

Wanting is very different than interfering.    I‚Äôm sure most countries want trump gone but they don‚Äôt interfere.

Hand it to Trump.  He will put his name on anything.
Between how Trump is trying to use Facebook and today‚Äôs illegal ‚Äúexecutive orders‚Äù/lying about Obamacare, this should be terrifying.  Trump is going to do everything he can to both steal the election and discredit it if he loses, and Joel Kaplan is going to help him.
We‚Äôre new to our neighborhood still, so unsure the political makeup so far. Very few yard signs so far. But one house down the road that looks out to M-6 has a huge tRump sign on the back of their garage visible from the highway and the Kent Trails.
Well they are there to see Trump though so it's really not a good thing.
How often have you heard Trump use the words "We" or "Us"?
So with trump announcing these executive orders, (payroll tax suspended, student loans suspended, insurance companies can‚Äôt deny pre-existing conditions, cheap medications) does anyone on the left dare oppose this publicly? Watch the lefties squirm!

I get it. Trump pardoned this guy so he falls obligated to eat Trump‚Äôs ass.

Let‚Äôs be honest Bill IS a predator. Look all the nice things that were said to and about him by all the left. N trump and the right are no different. I‚Äôm not sure an honest person can be president anymore.
Yeah I never said my president was all that smart. I‚Äôd bet money Bill was involved. Wouldn‚Äôt be shocked if Trump was too. There is so much to uncover in that scandal with multiple nations and leaders involved. I hope they keep her alive and we get some resemblance of truth.

Just wait til the news about trump being investigated or being indicted is released publicly. Trump wont have time to attack or spread lies about Biden, he will be busy with damage control.
Tough call. He's a sad little man who's carrying water for Trump in the most absurd way possible. I pity him in that regard. Yet, he seems to have a masochistic streak that causes him to consistently say things for which getting mocked is the only plausible outcome or motivation.
Fun to talk evangelical masculinity, Trump, and John Wayne with  today. ü§†
Trump is an island. He hung out at Wharton, his father was a billionaire, he's traveled around the world. Yet his critics are, almost universally, much smarter than him. No wonder they seem like such aliens to him. He views everything with hostile incomprehension. #projecting

Lets us make it clear to the historians: Trump is incompetent and evil. Next chapter.
Have you ever seen the series Life in the Fash Lane on YouTube? It breaks down all the ways that America is ripe for fascism, and how Trump is different than Hitler, and how American fascism looks vs fascism from other countries. I found it excellent.
So, Joe Biden's America will look like Trump's America?
How can women say they stand with and will vote for Trump?
9)We "elect Presidents, not pastors", but Joe Biden hates God so we shouldn't elect him.  10)Mexico didn't pay for a wall. The debt has grown exponentially. The trade deficit grew. Iran still has no nuclear deal. Obamacare hasn't changed. But Trump "kept all his promises!"
4)Trump hires only the best people but the Post Office is in shambles and it's totally not his job to fix it.  5)Masks are tyranny when 160,000 are dead in a pandemic, but torture is totally good cause 3,000+ died in 9/11. 6)Three marriages + tear gas = loving God.
Everyone involved needs to PRAY then PAY for what they have done to America and Donald Trump. That includes you Joey Biden!
Trump Had A Great Week!
Donald Trump exuded trashiness when he cheated on his wife with a porn star and then paid her off. He also exuded trashiness when he bragged about being able to grab women by their pussies. You exuded trashiness in your hypocritical disgusting response. And your dog is ugly.

I am neither a racist, a misogynist nor an evangelical. I also have a college degree and work in medical research. President Trump loves this country and its people. He also can't be bought. I'll take him over ANYONE from the corrupt, soulless Democratic party any day.
If Trump said do not take hydroxychloroquine then they would be on CNN saying how great the drug is the next day.
Sounds like Trump admin did. If the votes are there in the senate to override a veto, pass a 2T relief bill. Hopefully one that doesn't include insane pork on either side.
Does Trump pronounce France phonetically as Frons? No. He doesn't because 90% of America doesn't. Unless he's not American. I demand to see his birth certificate!
Yeah. The horror. Just imagine: six Americans died. How horrible! Good thing something infinitely worse never occurred on Trump's watch.

OMG.  Wow.  That is powerful.  Remember: this is going on your permanent record.  Too many see this as fun cuz Trump made it "cool" to be a racist.  When he loses and Vance sends him to prison, watch how many Trumpies say, "No, I never liked the guy!"  The internet is forever!
His plan would still cover more Americans than Trumps. Also Trump is presiding over the worst exonomic decline in our nations history since the great depression (+40mill) so im pretty sure Biden beats Trump on ‚Äútrade‚Äù as well.

So bc trump signed an executive order about something small today what else did he do that is being covered up by this small story? There‚Äôs always something ...MAJOR! JFC... I have seen tonight the entire plan laid bare. The Republicans made sure they wouldn't meet the Democrats where there would be a solution so that Trump could swoop in with EOs and call himself the hero.
I don't know about the response.  In general I don't think any President should be ruling by executive order.  But then again, I don't believe Trump ever took control of the federal government.

A ton of Republicans now admit TRUMP IS A CLOWN, as you just did -- VERY NICE!!  It won't save you from the total butt kicking you're on Nov 3rd...But still, VERY NICE of you to acknowledge a "fact"   And by acknowledging a fact, is what makes a person credible #BlueWave2020
I was just thinking how ‚Äútrash and depravity‚Äù are the perfect words to describe Donald Trump.
I am watching, but not sitting back.  I am knocking on doors, why isnt Biden?
I think we figured out that you are a partisan who just wants things to be true. That's fine, with President Trump its still a free country. But the rest of us don't have your Prejudice, and we would like some actual evidence.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Well, it predates the Trump Administration, and there is evidence of that. Maybe the Trump Administration has time machines.üòÅü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I am not at all concerned by the .01 % of words that Trump mispronounces.  I am concerned that his opponent is an obvious Criminal Who Cannot form a complete sentence in most situations.üòÅ
Nope Trump just retweeted asking for resolution üçøüçøüëç
Isn't Eric Trump the dumb one???
Just watch what you say we need to get Trump  out of office. Please Sir.
Obama caused kids in cages, on purpose.  Trump has fixed this.
Trump is going after Gamers. Biden is going to be playing a Game &amp; Watch on his next Zoom interview.
Oh Trump bout to shut down tiktok on y‚Äôall bet u won‚Äôt vote for his dumbass now dumbass
Seriously??!!!  If he picks Rice you‚Äôre out? Because Benghazi???  Trump has killed about 20,000 ‚ÄúBenghazi‚Äôs‚Äù of Americans, and lied repeatedly causing massive increases in deaths, but you‚Äôre OK with keeping HIM??
Who in their right mind would want to be friends with him??? ...Him meaning Fake Trump. #NotMyPresident
NOT MINE, #FAKE.TRUMP
Trump sure did destroy this country
As much as I'd like to see Joe crush him, Fake Trump needs to stay out of Michigan.  PERIOD!!!
Geez....what a ‚Äúcoincidence‚Äù. üôÑü§® You all do remember Trump lies right.
Shows trump had no understanding of religion or faith. And anyone who buys his crap doesn't either
Never thought I would be one of them. My job of 17 years shocked me when the eliminated my position due to covid a month ago. Sadly still waiting to see an actual unemployment check after being approved.  High anxiety not knowing when you might get one. Damn trump!!!
America is what you should be voting for! Trump is a traitor trying to turn this country into another Russia! Get your head out of the sand!
Hell yes I will wait line as long trump gets out of office

Michigan pro-Trump Republicans say Biden‚Äôs police policies will push voters toward Trump
Now come on -----  Would you really take medical advice from Trump if your life was on the line??
Do he and Trump have the same campaign advisors?
Wow, goes to show the BS that these Trump enablers can dish!!
There are viral anti-Biden Whatsapp messages that a bunch of desis have forwarded me in the past couple of weeks, and I have a shrewd suspicion that they're all emanating directly from the Trump campaign as part of a covert messaging apps strategy.  I hope I'm wrong.
Giving Trump this headline is doing state propaganda not journalism  Folks should be ashamed and held accountable.
They all are. We're not voting on Trump vs Biden, we're voting on whether Justice should be done or this should be covered.
Currently the answer is Republicans. In general the answer is neither.  They all lie so much, I would vote for anyone that Trump fully endorses.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
If Trump said it, we'd be rightly calling it racist.
Trump campaign says Michigan voters deserve presidential debate before early voting starts
Yeah Bishop, my race is full of fools and bigots who drink the bs Trump and company feed them. I‚Äôm proud to say I voted for President Obama, would do so again and again if I could! I miss his Presidency.
I like the way Trump ran our economy business wise.... but he‚Äôs a horrible person, personally. Do you pick your president based on who you like? Or who knows how to make the economy run smooth.
There is nothing accurate about what Trump said. Stop gaslighting.
My sense of it is that Joe does it when he loses his train of thought, and Trump does it when he has no idea what he's talking about or wants to dodge a question.
I am catholic  and the majority of catholics I know cannot stand trump.  The people I know believe in social justice and know pro life is way more than abortion..

Trump set himself up for ridicule by implying that he has the best brain.  He‚Äôs a big boy he can take a tease.  Stop defending the toddler president.  Let him grow up.
Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt go around pointing at his brain saying it‚Äôs the best.  Trump sets himself up for ridicule.  Stop defending the big baby.  He‚Äôs a big boy now.  üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Trump is the one that puts himself out there as the smartest brain, so he sets himself up for ridicule when he does not correct himself in real time.

It absolutely and empirically is not, and has not for months.  When this is over, and Trump is re-elected, you will find that the overall case fatality rate was something like .1% or less.
This is what Roger Marshall ‚Äîthe guy who beat Kris Kobach in the Kansas Senate primary tonight‚Äîhas to say about immigration on his website.  "Trump is right: we must build a wall"  Don't get it twisted. Just like Trump &amp; Kobach, Marshall is an anti-immigrant radical and racist.

In my experience most bears are Trump supporters.
The insanity we're seeing from the press and the Democrats daily is not because nothing is happening.  I think when we re-elect Trump, you'll really see fireworks. I just hope they don't involve China too much.
I face every day with the thought that in November we WILL take our country back from Trump and Putin by helping  win the election! Trump can try any damn trick he wants....he‚Äôs going to LOSE BIGLY! People get off your ass and pity party wagons and VOTE!

does Trump tweet for you?
Such an uncomfortable interview to watch. I don't know what was more disturbing, Trump trying to prove his point, or Swan trying to help Trump understand that he is wrong
It is not big government to hide inside of a building and slowly put out fires because the local government has failed even in its basic tasks.  It's a Trump campaign commercial, which is why they will win so big.
Could it be because he's supposedly the commander in chief? You all start at the top when Obama is office but now that Trump's in you want to start from the bottom now.

Biden can't beat Trump.  Trump, on the other hand, can win it for Biden.  Trumps biggest problem is he doesn't know when to shut his mouth and Biden's biggest problem is he doesn't know what's going to come out of his mouth.  This is a low mark in Presidential Elections.
Too bad Trump can‚Äôt be bought, otherwise spot on
What a world Trump lives in where a few folks is "Massive"
Trump's ads just make Biden sound so cool!!
Always substitute "Donald Trump" with "Fake News" when listening to the obese orange toad (Nickname per Stormy) who occupies the White House
You're not going to debate me because you don't have even kind of a leg to stand on.  That's fine, as long as President Trump is in charge, it is your right to be wrong and loud about it.üëç

Says the person who believes Trump support has eroded by being right and watching the Democrats make mistakes.  I'm not complacent, I want a landslide. I held my nose in 2016, I'm bringing friends and family this time.üòÅ
I like that you think this is because of Trump and not the Governors who have decided to lock down.  The opposition is really down to simpletons at this point.üòÅ
So Trump has known for a year and a half, and has done NOTHING about this? He‚Äôs a traitor. He needs to be removed. This is bullshit that he‚Äôs still in office.
If a bill isn't pass, it will reflect poorly on the leadership of Trump. It will further hurt his polling numbers.  Dems have all the leverage. We should cave on nothing.
Lol  1) Lots of Democrats were and are racist  2) Given his other views and that he's a man of color in mid-Michigan, no surprising actually  3) Don't underestimate Trump
I think a lot of folks don't understand the impact on voters of the non-trivial culture change we're going through right now.  The uncle I'm talking about used to be a strong Democrat, according to me dad.  Trump is disrupting how former strong Democrats in the midwest vote.
A lot more people at going to vote for Trump than are willing to admit publicly or to pollsters.  I spent time with an Indian uncle in Saginaw, MI that fits this mold.  He didn't say it outright, but he spent a lot of time talking about #AllLivesMatter &amp; that Biden is pro-Muslim.
This is a true story. Everything is on display now. Democrats cannot even hold their own areas without violence and rioting. All of the shootings and police misaction come from democratic strongholds. The choice is clear, We Will re-elect trump.üëçüá∫üá∏
You have no evidence, there is no refutation necessary. Trump unites, and has more minority support than any Republican in the past 50 years. You believe fake news, and I don't dislike you for it..üòÅ
Obama was the worst president we've ever had. I don't even think he once thought of American interests while he was in office. Could you give me an example of Trump's divisiveness?
Then I assume you are on the Trump train. This is the side that supports all Americans. The other side promote peaceful rioting, and believe that ruining an economy is an appropriate pandemic response.üëç
Yep, always one D.A.F. or D.A.S. (dumb as...) in every neighborhood!  One block over from me , an entire block of Biden supporters with signs in yards and one neighbor on same street, with lime green, jacked-up pick-up with a huge Trump flag and and Rebel flag on long PVC polesüôÑ
1) The US economy shrank by 32.9% last quarter  2) Our unemployment is 11%  3) Trump has failed all of us
This Biden indecisive crap is all fake narative. Its called thoroughly vetting a VP choice.  The problem is the lack of vetting the media did on trump four years ago.  Its all fun and games til 150,000 plus people die
No the one you pretend is real even though it's not, is the one I'm referring to. There are more Trump supporters now then there were in 2016.  Primarily hate in this country is owned by the left, as evidenced by their peaceful riots.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Yes, that is consistent with reality.   You admit they lied to you, but somehow think that's Trump's fault. It's a sickness, and the red pill cures it.
I‚Äôm old enough to remember the debate you moderated where DJT Trump ridiculed you-on national television-regarding the poor ratings of your radio show. You looked pretty humiliated. And yet, just like Ted Cruz, here you are.
Damn right he speaking the truth...Trump likes fuckin with people here because he gets jealous no one like his ass so being in charge he wants everyone to be upset ....And he ain't getting no money from it so it's a problem

Good, I think Manafort is a piece of shit that was planted in the Trump campaign for exactly the opinion you now hold.  This is an Insurgency, that's why they're releasing prisoners, that's why they're trying to curtail freedom of movement and  assembly. There is a virus.
That's exactly what this is, fear porn. You are either scared of the virus, scared of lack unrelated Medical Care due to the mishandling of the virus by state governors, or afraid of the economic Fallout which is still coming.  None of these are related to Trump.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I think you've got your Presidents mixed up, this was an Obama policy.   Trump wanted to face the accuser, who turned out not to have had correct information.
Trump was nowhere near the halls of power in 2012 when Obama got caught spying on AP reporters.  Fake news brush it under the rug, and none of us like to read. I missed it at that time as well.  It's the exact same reason the Democrats can't have Bernie.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
A reminder that a vote for Biden is a vote for Trump. A vote for Trump is a vote for a third party. A vote for a third party is a vote for lasagna. Not voting is having a yard sale. Fishing is putting in a cement driveway.

Why do I believe that COVID-19 is a bioweapon developed at the Wuhan Lab or Fort Detrick?   Well, the most obvious indicator of foreknowledge is the statement on January 12, 2017 by Dr. Anthony Fauci that ‚Äúthere will be a surprise outbreak‚Äù during the coming Trump administration.
He clearly hired some folks but is he creating jobs?  Don't know since we haven't see Trump's tax returns.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs reckless‚Äù as he says nothing about Trump trying to tear apart the constitution by calling for the election to be delayed
If the entire news cycle today had been about the fact that the economy dropped 32.9% while China‚Äôs economy grew last quarter, it would have done untold lasting damage to his polling numbers.   Trump knew that. He acted. He made today about the date of the election.
I‚Äôm concerned with the response in our country once we knew: Trump has failed. Stop deflecting!
No, it doesn't. But I am not a partisan who is completely blind to the world around me.  The second Trump wins, the likelihood of World War 3 starting with China is high.  They already own Biden.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

We CAN make things better for working people in Michigan: Join me in defeating Donald Trump this November --&gt;
This relies on both guccifer 2.0 being a Russian agent, which they weren't.  It also relies on Trump knowing that stone talkedto someone who was not a Russian agent but knowing he was at the time.  On top of that, it's still not the conspiracy they lied to you about.

The only thing Trump can legally do with the executive order is a continuance of a bill that expired.  He has that authority.  So yes, by execute decree he can extend the $600 unemployment benefits, but he cannot change the amount.
That's cool you're not voting for Trump then
Thought to consider. Everytime Trump opens his mouth about the election how many human deaths occur in the country as a result of COVID-19 , opioid overdose, or gun violence that he has ignored  over his presidency?
The reason we hate Trump is because we love our country. Which btw was never founded on a religion but rather the lack thereof. Are you familiar with separation of church and state? He's trying to destroy it.
You know just as well as everyone else that Biden can be persuaded, and damn well that Trump cannot. Trump will continue to cheat our government for the benefit of the 1% and his followers are so oblivious they think it's for them.
Uhm are you like blind? Trump is literally in the middle of a race war. And he's encouraging the beat down of black people. He calls them thugs. Meanwhile his gun weilding asshats are called "Patriots". You can't possibly oversee the micro aggressions.
Because in the world that we live in, school is going to open in the fall. Trump won't let those policies pass, therefore it's stupid to put the economy over kids and their parent's lives.
Accidentally my fat ass! How do you make a mistake and listen to a Cardi  B song? Everyone knows who she is and what type of music she makes. Also you're pearl clutching over this but was cool with trump's "grab em by the p*ssy" comment? You should play in traffic.

He wants to make himself look good for his non-existent future in politics, but too cowardly to publicly oppose Trump for his non-existent future in politics.
CHINA would b MASOCHISTS 2 back Trump. Same with Iran. Sounds fine! DEMS will GLADLY take China's &amp; Iran's help--now that FOREIGN HELP is OBVIOUSLY okay 2 DO now. Just ask Senators Chuck Grassley(Iowa) &amp; Ron Johnson(Wisconsin). They have been in CONTACT with Putin's Propaganda...
Good night, sleep tight no Trump dreams.
Well...Trump's NOT EXACTLY LITTLE! 280-POUNDS little!
Hell--Trump is ALREADY getting help from Putin. And HAS been ALL YEAR!
YES!  This apparently DRUNKEN POTUS Trump at tonight's Trump-Country-Club-Press-Conference DESPERATELY  NEEDS RUSSIAN HELP 2 WIN.
Trump can HAVE Vlady RUSKY!  WE  DEMS  get CHINA'S  help! AND Iran! Then maybe ALL 3 countries can take turns POUNDING the KREMLIN!
Don't spin numbers to show false support for whatever BS view you want to believe is accurate.  Trump's little pie charts have NEVER shown actual math, only lightened stats to dishonestly prove his statements.  Trump lies. WH lies. Trump supporters peddle his words like gospel...
Those countries also have already existing infrastructure and much smaller general class sizes. Not to mention that even if Dems could pass it as soon as possible, Trump would still be President as Fall comes around. It makes literally zero sense unless you live in fantasy land.
why does trump always look like he‚Äôs choking on his tongue
Fuck THAT! In November, Trump can FRENCH KISS Putin 2 his HEART'S CONTENT! HELL--he can MARRY the LOW-DOWN RUSKI 4 all I care. Once Biden takes over the helm on January 22, 2021, he's gonna have HIS Air Force pay Putin a little VISIT as they fire-up  the CLASSIC Beach Boys tune..
The deep state and the media have a nonsense narrative... all foreign nation, terrorist group, would like to get out Trump and America first... including Canada, Mexico and maybe England too..
Even Trump said, he knows he will get sued.
They‚Äôre going to get Trump elected... Again. That‚Äôs basically their only real purpose.
Yeah, Trump only has 5000 more business practice lawsuits against him than Buffett, who‚Äôs far richer, because he‚Äôs SO innocent. He‚Äôs been a fraud his whole life!
If Trump gives me $600 a month extended UIA with executive order  that's the most government has done for me in a long time. Just saying.
Because he‚Äôs spreading false info. I really don‚Äôt think Trump is gonna kiss you
Will Trump's DOJ then seek to have this executive order overturned in the courts?
Go in PEACE, FRIEND! And LISTEN 2 GOD! GOD doesn't happen by OSMOSIS! BELIEVE me--I know. Found out the HARD way! Actually, this all could b a BLESSING in DISGUISE! Perhaps God is PUNISHING U 4 SELLING YOR SOUL 2 TRUMP...which seeped out of U like FATALLY-POISONOUS ZYKLON-B GAS..

China is solidly behind its business partner,Donald Trump.
I don't think we should attack him. I've been into this stuff since way before Q, I delve in both the red pill and black pill communities and I understand some of his concerns (if he's being genuine.) I will throw a vote to Trump any day but just be aware of all possibilities.

His support is much stronger than his polls, that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre gonna get spanked. Democrats have rigged themselves into thinking they‚Äôve been winning this whole time. 62% of the country say they‚Äôre scared to say who they support (Trump) &amp; that doesn‚Äôt include the brave onesüß®üí•

Trump prevented nothing. By the time dimwit Donnie stopped flights from China, it was already here. 40,000 people came into the country after, many from the Wuhan district. Oh, and it been determined that the virus here came from Europe. They don't tell you that on fux noise.

......Congress must approve its reinstatement &amp; funding--which they will do, as usual, in lockstep with Trump's every desire. Trump has hinted his desire 2 go 2 war with Iran for 4 yrs, but knows he can't get reelected with that platform. If ReELECTED, war will SOON follow
why would he do that, its fucking mcdonalds trump

BREAKING: Donald Trump signs Executive Order declaring the two days between Friday and Monday to be weekends.
"Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions ‚Äî a protection which already exists under Obamacare"  Yet another Executive Order that is nothing more than autographed toilet paper. He fought against ACA, then took credit for it.
Trump is not going to accept the election results. This isn't some weirdo conspiracy shit. He is trying to disrupt/suppress voting and he will have close to 3 months between his loss and when he has to leave.

.....like Iraq was. And Trump won't go cheap on equipment like W. Bush did in Iraq-who did so 2 keep the deficit from spiking. Trump doesn't CARE about a spiking deficit. He DOES care about WINNING the war...&amp; ACQUIRING that oil. He will need a MILITARY DRAFT 2 beat Iran.......
Curious on your thoughts on the election.  Do you think Biden is the better candidate?  I didn‚Äôt vote for trump and haven‚Äôt voted for  a Republican President yet.  So you support the liberals pick for president and all his racist statements?
Lol Trump just gave you that $600 extension until the end of the year.  No one needs Biden
Well any idiot voting for trump is a lost cause. Dont waste your breath talking to them. There are reasons every day for past 5 years that prove he is unfit. Michigan is a disgrace

Yeah the Dems want $2 trillion for New York and California‚Äôs poorly run shit shows.  Trump is extending the unemployment benefits $600 a week until end of the year, stopping payroll tax, no evictions, student debt relief.  It‚Äôs not republicans messing up the negotiations.
The tide appears to be turning... Trump knows Americans won‚Äôt take the long way home to avoid the bully for too long before we‚Äôll team up &amp; fight back. He‚Äôs been sizing up the situation, waiting for us to signal him we‚Äôre ready to stand up. You hear it? He does. Cheers. Finally.
I don't get it. Are Trump supporters running out of arguments or are they just getting dumber. This was just plain stupid.

It's true! Basically he tied the hands of the Democrats from holding up this legislation. So they'll either put something together that looks like his or Trump will sign an executive order on those items

This mentality. This is what happened in 2016. People felt both candidates were awful but people voted for trump bc they thought hillary was worse. Really. We would not have had the circus with hillary in office. Like her or not. Once again people will keep trump in office.
Im done with watching secupp. How ignorant and absurd. Countless times criticizing trump and now she will write someone in if she does not like vp pick.  WTH.
Why does it seem like the Trump campaign hired those scammers who would generate those Nigerian prince email scams to create their campaign emails?
If a black American is truly serious about voting for Joe Biden over Donald Trump they are truly betraying their own race and keeping their disenfranchisement.

Watch live: President Donald Trump holds news conference
Bernie, Bernie. You of all people should know this is all Trump. If he can shut down the US Postal Service then he cancels out the mail in voting process. A political move that is typical Trump.
No, it‚Äôs not. I count 6 people in that photo wearing masks, and the rest are packed together with no protection (even 4 children in the front). Trump is actively disregarding social distancing guidelines set by his own administration and the state he‚Äôs currently in.
Trump will help another country but he will not help his own country because of the Democrats as he says
Why does he keep saying the China virus it's the Trump virus Trump is racist look what he did in the last three and a half years don't forget about all the remarks he said Trump is for Trump that's it
Never said that. In fact in the states where it‚Äôs worse now those governors are being reckless. The  way half the country blindly follows trump if he would have said to do it they would have
If I were going to stand on a crowd a people taking a risk on getting a virus that could kill me it sure the hell wouldn't be for Donald Trump

Estate and trust taxes are so fucking complicated.  And the rich people you are thinking of have staffs of folks to work their way around those rules. It's why seeing Trump's tax returns is a laughable notion. Hib, tax accountant

2020 polls tighten: Trump narrows gap with Biden as campaign chief credits coronavirus briefings  #FoxNews
If it true, it‚Äôs the stupidest election campaign strategy of all time. Everyone voting against trump is voting to get rid of the reckless ‚Äúcelebrity president‚Äù and voting for the quitest and least controversial candidate. If anything, it takes votes from trump
I believe most Canadians appreciate what the Liberals and what our great leader, Prime Minister Trudeau has done for Canada during this time of the trump virus!! And they will not forget at the next election !
Get Trump out and put a man with dementia and 81 running again. 369 million ppl in this country and we end up with Joe Biden. Omg what a joke for both parties
That‚Äôs what I said. But I said 300 million and they end up with a 77 old man that‚Äôs on his last days. Minds going.  Trump at least 70.  Biden at 81 running again.  I can‚Äôt believe we ended up with this guy. He has some timers and it turns into all timers. He can‚Äôt handle pressure
It‚Äôs very clear that Whitmer doesn‚Äôt care about nothing beneficial. She‚Äôs doing her part to help push fear and keep businesses closed so she can blame trump #recallwhitmer

Come freakin' on COVID19 you spread so easily, what? are you too good to infect trump?? Have some self respect and get to infecting the cause for our suffering.
The plan is to have Trump issue an executive order so he can be seen as the savior of the second stimulus package. You‚Äôre journalists c‚Äômon Katy this is how his mind works. His campaign will have a positive issue after all. It‚Äôs not hard to figure out the strategy ..unemployment
I got memes from a boss that were pro Trump so I just sent a response meme back pro dem and haven‚Äôt gotten anything from him since. I saved it in case of blow back. CYA!
Trump responded quickly with a China travel ban. Immediately Biden condemned Trump for being  a Xenophobe. Nancy Pelosi called Trump a racist as she walked through San Francisco's China town telling everyone it is safe to travel &amp; her city is open. Biden at least apologized.
It's true, Trump is such a cosmopolitan world traveler. Once I saw him at a restaurant in Cap d'Antibes and I heard him order ¬´ Magret de canasson avec sa sauce de l'orang-outan ¬ª in perfect French.

Trump defends the Confederacy. Alexander Stephens, Vice President of the Confederacy, said the "Cornerstone rests upon the great truth, that the negro is not equal to the white man." White supremacist?
"That he‚Äôs okay with siphoning off Black votes from the Democratic nominee, thus helping Trump. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not denying it, I just told you. To say that the Black vote is Democratic is a form of racism and white supremacy.‚Äù"
You spelled Trump Virus wrong. #TrumpVirus
You're serious? This isn't witty at all. Comparing Trump &amp; GW Bush is nuts. W believed in the international liberal order. So did Obama. Before Trump, Obama and Bush became friends. Obama, younger and more liberal, shook things up, but was a largely traditional POUTS, as was W.
The post is right - in their mind "any system that makes it possible for Donald Trump to be more successful than moi, must be a mistake and therefore, ripe for dismantling".

Biden and the DNC have chosen "Uniting America"...The theme for the DNC's unprecedented virtual convention is meant to show a sharp contrast to Trump, who Democrats say has divided the nation amid one of the nation's most trying periods.
if you are seriously asking, here is the serious answer: Donald Trump dying from Covid-19.  Of course, President Pence would be trying to create a Theocracy to enshrine his bizarre beliefs in law.
but its good for them tastes great
Don‚Äôt blow up my twitter. But I have friends, that I would consider, well educated, and intelligent individuals that  are Democrats. They believe Biden shows early symptoms of dementia and will still vote for him because they hate President Trump.   Let that sink in...
They should give Trump peyote, then turn on the Coyotes game. Then tell him Mexico got a hockey team send tweet
This doesn't sound crazy now, since China wants Trump out they unleash this virus to get him out. They knew Trump would be unprepared and 4 more years of him would put China in a serious recession. Trump is bad for business worldwide.

Luckily the only people who are still voting for Trump are the uneducated rubes who demostrate their ignorance with every Tweet. If Russia supported Hilary, why does Trump give Putin an open mouth kiss every time is name comes up? Putin hated Hilary.

Trump has denounced David Duke. I've been a conservative since1989 &amp; have never seen anything resembling a white supremist group. Any race issues in America can best be solved by electing John James as the 1st Black MI Senator providing everyone a voice at the table.
Trump can't even read a "COSMOPOLITAN" magazine.  I doubt he can pronounce it, but I would love to see him try.
This is a stupid metric to use but I mean not as stupid as interviewing people as only interviewing 13 to be the next-next POTUS.

Never said Biden is adopting his platform en masse. But look at both then compare to Trump's. I.e. public option vs Medicare4all vs no plan at all. Both believe in democracy vs Trump's autocracy. Throwing out the baby w/the bath water isn't better just shows your bitterness.
That‚Äôs cause you tell so many lies!!! Biden a honest man!!!
my coworker said she would rather have Trump back in office cause Biden is a pedo like sis ....both are üíÄ
The year is 2021:   Trump has been physically removed from the White House after his loss.  Biden has implemented a national mask/testing strategy, eliminating COVID in 6 months.  USPS is fully funded.  College football teams are gearing up to start a fall season.  Life is good.
He has been this whole time, but you never hear about it on your media. This whole time he has been actively fighting the pandemic. This whole time Democrat‚Äôs and Biden/Pelosi Stayed home and did nothing. They  some How still think that they can criticize.
So we just need some other org to say you can't vote for Biden, and then we can install a Catholic monarch, right?
Give me a break. I certainly don‚Äôt see this from the  The press corp allowed Trump to break the norms, so you can‚Äôt expect only Biden to follow them.
So the Russia interference investigation indeed was a witch hunt like Trump had been saying. FYI this happened under the Obama/Biden administration.
So you would rather have Trump‚Äôs total lack of governance and human decency because that‚Äôs closer to a Bernie presidency than Biden. Do you even care Bernie‚Äôs platform? This is what happens when you let checkers players into a chess game.
2/3 a coup, Obama/Biden had a pattern of 8 yrs of spying so why is anyone surprised that they spied on Oppo party and a Presidency  They spied e.g. Merkel, AP, Rosen/Family, Congressional committees; All Americans=Clapper lied under oath; Brennan lied, Comey leak/spied
I just pray we see a Trump vs. Biden debate.
Joe "I don't do white running mates" Biden is definitely turning out to be the real deal.
I need to ask you if you are for or against abortion? &amp; Either for or against the LGBTQ? I am just asking a simple question. I agree with Biden about the economy, &amp; I Pray you are there to help him as well. To be honest, I lost trust in politics years ago.üò∞
Oh hell no. Biden for the win. Warren freaks me out
Ill be looking forward to seeing the Running VP behind bars. Shes an active terrorist and a communist. If Biden is elected we can put her away forever. In her own system.   42 U.S. Code¬†¬ß‚ÄØ1985.Conspiracy to interfere with civil rights

I have complete confidence in the Biden Harris team! Hopefully the cabinet includes many of the other candidates.
I feel like you‚Äôre wildly under-selling the amount of Americans who refuse to vote for Biden. It‚Äôs not just online smugbros, there‚Äôs a ton of ex-hippie boomers for example.  America will suck regardless, but Trump winning would make it a permanent, potentially world-ending  suck.
Congressman Khanna, you are more of a leader for the people than Biden or Harris will ever be. Please keep up your pressure if they get elected.
We are so fortunate to have you as Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate. Major hurdles, of course,   Massive sexism (at 72 yrs I so understand), birthism (no surprise), that craziness about no red meat (anything to be just plain crazy). We just fight the good fight!!!!
Postal Union Endorses Biden-Harris As Trump Threatens USPS
So what the hell is your point?  Because he repeated a grade that makes him ineligible to be POTUS?  Really Soledad I expected better from you than this bs!  Move on, #Biden-Harris to save USA!
Biden is a warmonger who along with Obama/Hillary invaded Libya, drone bombed seven countries and fueled Syrian/Yemeni war and sent American soldiers to fight useless wars. How is any of that showing empathy and leadership?
A vote for Biden is a vote supporting his warmongering with Obama, their invasion of Libya, their drone bombing in seven countries and the death of 100,000 brown people. F off with your democracy. A vote for Biden is a vote for war and murder.
Edgy take of the day:  "We are bombarded by death, disease and the dawning of a new Great Depression. . . . But as a silver lining, we no longer have to suffer the bullshit of presidential campaign reporting."  -- Hamilton Nolan,
It‚Äôs cool. Biden/Obama led Libyan invasion, drone bombed seven countries, fueled arms to Syria/Yemen conflict and led to 100,000 dead brown people. So if you vote for Biden, I consider you having voted to bomb brown people.
2/2  is full of Crap so much data incl Dossier/FISA ABUSES; documents via Freedom of Info by   why do u let Tarlov say if I haven‚Äôt seen anything yet re Historic spying on Oppo party w so many lies by Obama/Biden Rice Comey McCabe
How does the rest of the panel let Tarlov get away w her BS - there is plenty of Documented information that Obama/Biden spied on  campaign and Presidency and it is a continuation of 8 years of spying eg Clapper all Americans; AP; Rosen/Family; Merkel  1/2
Dems aren‚Äôt ‚Äúlooking for the perfect candidate.‚Äù If this was any other country progressives like Bernie wouldn‚Äôt even be the same party as Biden. We don‚Äôt want the perfect candidate. We just want a candidate period. I‚Äôm voting for Biden but Biden is not progressives‚Äô candidate.
Btw I‚Äôm still begrudgingly voting for Biden. Not sorry. If you can‚Äôt acknowledge Trump is worse than Biden you need let go of your inflated image driven ego and learn to think critically. Stay mad
I live voting for Biden on ‚Äúpolls‚Äù hahaha. Trump 2020!
Biden is whatever I don‚Äôt like
They probably have Biden signs in their yard! Hiden Biden!
These polls suggest that Biden has a lock on the popular vote, and an almost certain lock on a November victory. State polls suggest the same. He's ahead of Trump by 6 points or so in Michigan, for example.

Biden and Harris for 2020
Biden good,  trump very, very horrible traitor.
I hope someone makes a digital animation of a Biden/Harris train, because wowie.
I just saw the gal bullying the 12 y/o and I‚Äôm leaving it on Coward‚Äôs Ratio look up my likes if you want to find it. Like listen man, I get you‚Äôre that mad about Biden and Kamala....I don‚Äôt know how to finish that sentence.
Joe Biden Calls For Nationwide Mask Mandate 'Immediately'
Of course. Plus she deserves it. My guess though is Biden will lose more white votes than the black votes he gains. I hope I am wrong.
He talks out of both sides of his mouth. One time he says one thing. Then five minutes later he's saying something different. And he can't stand it when Biden is right and he's not.  Trump has to be center of attention for everything. He can't stand it when Biden or Harris talk.
What‚Äôs the point anyway?  Biden will do what he wants so Ro‚Äôs vote against the platform means nothing.
And yet Biden is a big enough man and ethical leader to choose someone as his running mate that doesn‚Äôt always pander to him. This is a refreshing change! We will have better outcomes in leadership when we are permitted a diversity of ideas and solutions.
Tax reductions seem unlikely given the enormous fiscal response to the Covid-19 business disruptions. Biden‚Äôs tax plan offers a glimpse of what we may be facing in 2021 and beyond.

Trump is already blaming Biden for everything and calling him a liar... also said number 1 in the world for Ventilators?!... please end this shit #TrumpKillsUSPS #TrumpThreatensAmerica
It's already collapsed and the world is already laughing. It's time for a Biden rebuild.
Yep a very cynical ploy by Trump. Vote for Joe Biden!
I think Biden is better than Trump that‚Äôs it. I don‚Äôt like Biden he‚Äôs just the better of the two shitty candidates.
Thank you for agreeing with me. You‚Äôre right, you weren‚Äôt talking about Biden‚Äôs covid response, but you quoted my tweet about Biden‚Äôs covid response with a completely new topic and acted like my tweet you quoted was in opposition of your comment. Be honest in your discourse plz
Has Joe Biden congratulated Trump on the historic peace agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates?
My super power would be to snap us right to Jan21, 2021 for Biden‚Äôs inauguration.
Hey Kamala Harris, Care to explain why prison stocks rose, as soon as u were announced as Biden‚Äôs running mate? Or are u just gonna continue doing what your doing at the expense of others. I hate choosing the lesser of two evils
I always wonder how tf Trump shoves Big Macs down his gullet every day and has even lived this long. What kind of sick joke is the universe playing? And Biden looks like he could croak literally any second. It‚Äôs the same feeling of waiting for the screensaver to hit the corner.
#SayHisName  it's sad i have to hear about this on twitter i guess the news is to busy bashing joe biden.
Amazing to see a so-called Christian call out the faith of Joe Biden (a regular Catholic churchgoer) while embracing #ImpotusAmericanus who has trampled every teaching of Jesus Christ!!! Absolute hypocrisy!!! #BidenHarris2020 #BidenHarris2020Landslide
In short, fascism won‚Äôt be changed in one election, but we can chip away at it by voting in the direction that we want. Like it or not(and I fucking hate it) Biden is our most progressive VIABLE candidate. And that sucks ass but it‚Äôs reality.
And look at the fact that RBG‚Äôs term is ending. You DO NOT want trump to be in command when it‚Äôs time for her to be replaced... anyway, my point is no voting for Biden won‚Äôt immediately change anything but it will make it easier to get the change we want to see in the future
One single person to take command of everything. Look at Trumps cabinet and how damaging they have been to the country. Let‚Äôs be honest here, Biden probably isn‚Äôt going to even live through his full term. But the cabinet he puts in will have be way better than the current one
Future that I would want to see, NOT because Biden represent the future I want to see, but because if he gets elected Trump will be out office. My main focus is just getting trump out of there ASAP because he can‚Äôt handle this pandemic. Biden sucks but he at least will be able to
With that out of the way let‚Äôs address the second thing you said. I‚Äôm not claiming voting for Biden will end the oligarchy. Not even close. Voting for one candidate can‚Äôt accomplish that, but that‚Äôs not the goal of voting for him... voting for him is just one step toward the
Is biden harris having one at 5 20
Since you decided to share a definition with me earlier I think it‚Äôs only fair I get to do the same. You still keep straw Manning my arguments. Trump is demonstrably worse than Biden. I don‚Äôt like Biden. I think we can agree that we need to abolish the two party stystem right?
The Biden campaign is looking more and more like "Weekend at Bernies."
America makes progress after kicking and screaming and whining, but progress is made just the same. We need to work to make sure the Trump years were just a blip of ‚Äúwaaa we don‚Äôt wanna‚Äù sandwiched between Obama and Biden/Harris, with a more just and equal America for everyone.
2/3 let Voters exactly what Harris/Biden promised Dem Voters-    Get  info on Harris re not prosecuting Catholic Church abusers &amp; his documents- how she went after Sickle Cell Student then talk to
attack Harris‚Äô/ Biden‚Äôs Primary positions! Why, bec Harris will certainly take over from Biden- then will push her own agenda - if Biden wins and can remain Pres for 1st term - I believe he will resign near the end so Kamala will be Pres leading into the  election 1/3
Okay that‚Äôs not a good thing, but that‚Äôs child‚Äôs play compared to systematically destroying the USPS in the middle of a global pandemic. Not even in the same realm. Like I said, Biden isn‚Äôt good, but Trump is off the charts fascist. It‚Äôs not even a comparison.
okay then i don‚Äôt wanna hear shit about progressives or ‚Äúbernie bros‚Äù losing biden the election in november. y‚Äôall don‚Äôt want or need our votes but then blame us for everything when shit goes south. and for the record I still am voting for biden.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
Yes and I‚Äôm choosing to vote for the guy who‚Äôs not actively engaging in voter suppression(fascism). Don‚Äôt get me wrong I can‚Äôt stand Biden or Harris, but we can‚Äôt let Trump erode our democracy another 4 more years
Fantastic 2 days of introducing Biden/Harris! Speeches brought tears of joy. Truth, empathy &amp; plans for America! Bravo team, well done!

I think it‚Äôs great they asked a respected Republican governor to endorse Biden at the DNC. And it‚Äôs spelled soul.
just watched your show. I loved how Biden teed up the mispronunciation of Kamala for you. I laughed out loud
Everyone is saying "what are we supposed to vote for t*ump now?" Like no ofc not but its also not bad to recognize and understand what harris and biden have done. Honestly no one's going to be happy but just vote for Biden and Harris and understand that they both suck ass
‚Å¶ Dude, you do know, if Biden wins he won‚Äôt take the Oval Office until next January 20, right? Not this November, as you have in this story. Seriously? For shame. And your copy editor should be fired.
The point I'm making is that Biden/Harris have a better chance of helping someone.
I feel you, I understand the gravity of it all. I can‚Äôt vote for a guy just because he‚Äôs not another guy. So I either stay home, or write in Andrew yang. Biden is more of the same and will usher in someone even worse than Trump
I get Trump‚Äôs an idiot. But this is decency? Biden/Obama invaded Libya illegally, dropped record drone bombs on 7 countries, fueled Syrian/Yemeni conflict with arms and left 100,000 dead brown people. Seriously wondering if humanity doesn‚Äôt extend to non-Americans.
Bleeding liberal here. Biden/Obama admin invaded Libya illegally, dropped record drone bombs on 7 countries, fueled conflict in Yemen and Syria and left 100,000 brown ppl dead. But sure, speaking well is so important you forget about war and murder.
I get you can‚Äôt vote for Trump. I‚Äôm a liberal too. But calling Biden decent and humane? Obama/Biden invaded Libya, drone bombed seven countries in record numbers, fueled Yemen and Syrian conflict and left 100,000 dead brown people. Does your humanity not extend to brown ppl?
No new country was invaded for the first time this century.  The Dems savage Trump for being a ‚Äúthreat to humanity‚Äù  100,000 brown people died from Obama/Biden wars and drone bombing in Libya, Syria &amp; Yemen.  The Dems? Endless praise and voting for more.  Posturing assholes
When we read this headline.   BIDEN/HARRIS WIN WHITE HOUSE.
Ok, I had a tear in my eye listening to both speeches. It was hope for what‚Äôs likely to come. Biden was good, but Harris was stellar.
After the 50th lie poured out of Biden‚Äôs mouth, I had to change the channel. Therefore never heard a single word Harris had to say; oh well. No loss.
My mistake Cher.  That's supposed to say if there is one. Cher. Do yo think your friend Joe Biden is going to be President? Just curious Cher.  Me I have this really really good feeling that he will be.  And my feelings usually have been accurate. So now do you think he will be?
Question: Obama/Biden invaded Libya, drone bombed seven countries, fueled conflict in Yemen and Syria and led to 100,000 dead brown people. Does compassion only extend to American people? How can a liberal vote for this warmongering?
I understand you‚Äôre excited. But where‚Äôs the justice for the 100,000 people who died from Obama/Biden invasion into Libya, drone bombing seven countries and fueling arms to destroy Yemen? Does compassion and healing not extend to brown people, Rabbi?
Because, for better or worse, the model is now becoming a major part of the story. You can't reliably model this election, but now people will think Biden has an easy path. They shouldn't, but we know they will, which makes the model a significant variable.
missing major point &gt; the Media is going to be working w Biden Harris - and will cover for them - they will have 98% media support

Joe Biden is a secret Muslim? What happened? Did Obama secretly convert him? Did Obama convert Biden over to Marxism as well? Is Scranton, PA really part of America? Joe! Where's your birth certificate?
Yes!!!  Is that suppose to scare us? That‚Äôs part of why I am voting for Biden/Harris.
If Biden can get passed it, we can as well. They are working together to govern.
We are not listening to anything coming from a Biden camp.
The real sad thing about this Biden/Harris ticket is that as a Palestinian there really is no good option for president. Both candidates and their VPs are unabashedly pro-Israel and don't even attempt to hide it with the typical two state solution lines.

If you are spending today not criticizing the literal warmonger Biden who invaded Libya, drone bombed seven countries and left behind 100,000 dead brown people, quit with your social media posturing.
My dream was Bernie Sanders and Andrew Yang and here we are with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris...
How did ‚Äòholding them accountable‚Äô work when Biden/Obama invaded Libya leaving thousands dead or drone bombed seven nations? There ain‚Äôt no excuse to vote for a war criminal. Atleast Trump hasn‚Äôt invaded a new country.
Biden/Obama bombed seven countries, destroyed Libya and drone bombed merrily. Kamala prosecuted innocent people. You don‚Äôt have to do this. Disagreements are fine but not with a warmonger and a criminal top cop.
More important question: Why did she endorse Biden after calling him a racist segregationist and saying she believes the women who accused Biden of sexual misconduct?
Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his running mate

This ad is basically an own goal, eh.  So far, you've spotted Biden/Harris 3 goals and there's 8 minutes left in the 3rd period.

Until Kamala Harris comes out and honestly explains why she refused to pursue and prosecute Steve Mnuchin the head of our treasury for gaming for closures when he was at One  West I will not vote for Biden
It's a good ticket and it shows Biden has a thick skin. I like the idea of a cabinet of rivals, historically it has resulted in great leadership.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Congratulations to Senator  I think this is an excellent choice. #BidenHarris2020
Biden-Harris for the WIN!
Mannn Biden got me scratching my head
Horrible decision I will not vote for Biden!
Fun fact: Joe Biden's first choice for VP was John W. Davis.
Until Kamala Harris explains why she did not prosecute Steve Mnuchin for gaming foreclosures with One West which incurred company fines to the tone of 100M dollars, I will not be voting for Biden.  Of all the qualified and incredible running mates, he chose the poorest candidate!
The NRA has nothing to worry about your safe. It‚Äôs everything else Biden and Harris get their hands on we need to worry about. Lucky for us Trump will be re-elected no worries.‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏

Biden couldve picked teddy ruxpin as his vp and hed have my vote by default
I‚Äôm stoked for a Biden/Harris ticket. Imagine competent leadership!
Be honest, the only good thing to come out of a Biden win is that we end Trump. And that is definitely good. But don‚Äôt pretend like our so called democracy will be better. We will still have perpetual war, poor healthcare, income inequality &amp; abusive cops.
I heard Trump warns we will have to take our Castor Oil if Biden wins. The giant Little Rascal tablespoon size.
I can't wait for VP Harris to be the girl power face of what's sure to be a brutal, sustained, and punitive crackdown on protests using faceless federal troops the SECOND Biden wins. Assuming he does of course, and that's no slam dunk.

I know  is the current  boogeyman, but I've been saying that  will not win over the African American vote if he picked her for #VicePresident, so it's a waster of time to keep demonizing her  via
Based on the convention‚Äôs line-up, reason makes me believe  that these people will not be Biden‚Äôs pick. What do you think? #BidenVP
Big homeless numbers, big numbers of people camping out for food donations, big numbers of people unemployed,big numbers of people sick&amp;dying of Covid. Big numbers of people frustrated w/ your incompetent, divisive, corrupt, BS. BIG NUMBERS OF PEOPLE SICK OF U &amp; VOTING FOR BIDEN
So sad. I saw a campaign called ‚Äúsettle for Biden‚Äù. Settle. I still can‚Äôt understand if they‚Äôre serious or it is in jest. That‚Äôs the 2020 election in a nutshell
This is a really narrow-minded tweet. Biden‚Äôs pick isn‚Äôt about sending a message to black women or white women. His pick will be based on who he trusts the most and clicks with. All of the woman are incredible. Stop trying to divide. We need to rally around Biden and his pick!
I think through this pandemic, she HAS shown that she has what it takes. Why can‚Äôt this just be about Democrats rallying around whoever Biden chooses? At the end of the day, this person will be who he clicks with the most. Every one of those women are qualified.
trump will never do it.  The day after Biden is inaugurated, it needs to happen so kids can get a month and a half of regular school in and we can start to get back to normal.
what is Biden afraid- let voters have as much info as possible move up the one debate or    Ask   to do a debate before 1st votes - use video for Biden and use his own Primary words to respond to questions when it is his turn
Did you see the info babe's eyes lift when she said the Chinese want Joe Biden?
So, Trump just said that the 1917 (n√©e 1918) pandemic "probably ended the second World War. All the soldiers were sick." I'm sorry, but if you still support him after everything that's happened, you're not just stupid, you're hopeless. Don't give me any bullshit about Joe Biden.
Whitmere, Warren, Wilma Flintstone, or whomover...Biden still gets my vote!
Trump should spy on the biden campaign. What's good for the goose is good for the gander.
Biden was always goofy Joe. 30 years ago, he was claiming someone else's boyhood history as his own, for example. He's a bit worse now. We're not really electing him, of course, but whoever we think is pulling the strings. Maybe that'll be the VP?

Cher Cher Cher my one Cherie. Im voting for Joe Biden don't worry. I'm one of his supporters. So dont worry it's all under control. Well for me. It's under control at least. We have have to get the giant üçäüçäü•ïü•ïü•ïüéÉüéÉüéÉ out of office. Sorry I got carried away.

That sounds quite threatening to Vice President Biden. I'm sorry but I feel it's my responsibility to forward this to the appropriate authorities.
Just an FYI‚Ä¶ There is no amount of Joe Biden being corrupt that makes Donald Trump look better.

Trump Syndicate. RICO Act in 2021. That's if we win. Biden/Harris!
#Biden has googly eyes on Harris.  You may have seen that almost kissing moment photo. üò¨
2 weeks ago, my friend and I took a trip to Caseville, up North. The Biden signs and the Trump signs were about equal. Danny is a Trumper. Doesn't mean I don't still love him. He's just misguided, like my Mother. Just don't talk politics üòú

And Biden will take care of all those things? Hahahahaha
Yes they should him! And he can‚Äôt stand Biden or Harris!
Even after Biden wins in a couple months, does anyone really think the social fabric in America will ever be the same as prior to the advent of the virus?
I think you‚Äôre a traitor who‚Äôs getting paid by Russia to smear Biden. Your story is weak, Russia isn‚Äôt getting their money‚Äôs worth.
This attitude right here is why I have no time for progressives shitting on Biden nonstop. A god damn former right wing tea party congressman can put his beliefs aside to end the emergency and so can everyone else.
Fact check: Trump skews record on Biden-Harris, economy
The year is 2021:   Trump has been physically removed from the White House after his loss.  Biden has implemented a national mask/testing strategy, eliminating COVID in 6 months.  USPS is fully funded.  College football teams are gearing up to start a fall season.  Life is good.
Typical flip flop politician who plans to help Biden give our nations wealth away for free free free!!!!!
So we just need some other org to say you can't vote for Biden, and then we can install a Catholic monarch, right?
Not even Biden writing these tweets
No SMART citizen would want Biden as president! #TrumpTrain
I would have had Brain dead Biden on the Left side- implying visually she was the ‚Äúright hand ‚Äú woman.
Just a reminder NOT voting for Trump is a vote for Biden.ü§£ #DownBallot #NeverBidenNeverTrump #NeverBidenNeverKamala #KickRocksKamala
The Blue Wave, my neighbors, the positivity Biden/Harris stirred up. We need to find a way to channel all the anger we have towards Trumpublicans into positivity for Biden/Harris. We're not out of the woods untill January 20.
It's coming down to it. I dread to see all the Trumpublicans and Trumptards in line with no masks. It's going to get very ugly. No mask=Trump, Mask=Biden/Harris. You'll know before the Vote...
So ya'll poorly edited a bunch of clips together of Hannity talking about Joe Biden, and tried to make it seem like it's about Trump? You're doing the same stuff the wallstreet journal did to pewdiepie? But you don't think young people are going to see through that? HA!
It made be crystal clear to us, but I think, at least to Joe Biden, he is blind to it! Or at the very least not consciously aware?
Congressman Khanna, you are more of a leader for the people than Biden or Harris will ever be. Please keep up your pressure if they get elected.
Postal carriers union endorses Biden, warns that 'survival' of USPS is at stake
I understand you live in fear and sound foolish.   Facts are facts. Trump wins we start nominating a progressive 2 years before 2024 election.  If Corporate puppet Biden wins we waste a decade on this pos corporate owned pimp.   Why waste any more than 2 years on this?
It really does.  If Trump wins 2 years from now we start nominating a progressive. If Biden wins a decade is wasted on shitty Centrist Corporate owned puppets.
Pick Trump. In 2 years we can nominate a Progressive. If Biden wins a decade is wasted on Corporate Puppets.
The day after Michigan Bernie's campaign was saying he wouldn't dropout ( It was over
Joe Biden had a major rally in Detroit on March 9 and then trounced Bernie the next day in Michigan. There was nobody saying postpone the primary. Nobody wearing masks voting. COVID hitting ended Bernie's hopes to drag things out for delegates.
I'm afraid that come november, even if Biden gets elected, people are going to assume they can sit back and stop protesting for important causes because the president will "fix everything" which is NOT the case. Regardless of who wins, don't stop fighting. They won't change
Vote for Biden anyway.  Count on Biden to put together a team of advisors that he will actually listen to.  He‚Äôs not going in thinking he has to know everything.  He just has to know how to lead.  Besides we have a better shot at surviving the next 4 years with Biden for Prez.

Joe Biden has promised to appoint a Secretary of Education who has actually been a public school teacher.   I can't wait.
That would be Biden! Isn‚Äôt he so nice about the Black people! I can‚Äôt believe they would vote for him or Harris! Don‚Äôt trust either one of them! No he‚Äôs not joking on what he saids! I wouldn‚Äôt vote for evil racist never!
I love that the bar is so low that Biden can tweet out about just basic human decency and people will quote tweet it like ‚ÄúTHIS is what we need in a president‚Äù
Joe Biden is going to force our children to read the Curand (muslim bible) in schools.

Joey Two Times Biden
I love your posts and not looking to argue..... Joe Biden isn‚Äôt intelligent enough to have written the Patriot Act.  Corporate interests wrote it and had Biden claim he wrote it. Then lobbyists threatened to primary anyone who dared to vote against it.
. JOE BIDEN IS NOT IN CHARGE DID OBAMA HAVE ANY THING TO DO WITH THIS WOMAN'S POSITION?                                           Vote:  REPUBLICAN  2020 - 2022
Do you want to lose your social security? Trump wants to end it. Biden voted to cut it 4 times.
Ever wonder why American Presidents are prohibited from taking monies or lavish gifts from foreign countries?  Because it compromises them.  Biden has been compromised by American corporate interests as well as Ukraine who gifted his moron son millions of dollars.
We‚Äôre on the same side here Joe. Just everyday we see Biden‚Äôs dumbass and I think what could‚Äôve been instead. Doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm not also aware of everything else. I‚Äôm allowed to be upset with the DNC.
the better candidates to win. Then will guilt you to vote for their shitty candidate. Im aware of the bigger issues, it only took me 5 seconds to make that tweet. You can continue to have your head up the DNC‚Äôs ass and be happy with candidates like Biden but I wont üêë
Of course. Plus she deserves it. My guess though is Biden will lose more white votes than the black votes he gains. I hope I am wrong.
He talks out of both sides of his mouth. One time he says one thing. Then five minutes later he's saying something different. And he can't stand it when Biden is right and he's not.  Trump has to be center of attention for everything. He can't stand it when Biden or Harris talk.
Change is happening  We will get better president for 2020 . Joe Biden for the win üíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôèüèª
r u kidding, the demon'crats will do anything to win  elections...how do people like Whitmore...the squad..polosi..Schumer  ..Schiff.. problem child M. Watters..shit for brains the thief biden...Kamala the mirror fake news Harris ...who votes for these pos...they cheat !
thanks so much, Angela... üòä
Everything is going to come out IF we can successfully elect Biden/Harris. The Trumpublicans and Trump syndicate WILL see PRISON! That's why this is all or nothing for this corrupt regime! Vote! No matter how you do it! Vote!
Like I keep telling people: you ain‚Äôt voting for Biden, you‚Äôre voting for RBG‚Äôs replacement - For starters.  Like do people have any idea how much damage DeVos did to the educational system and the students in less than four years?!
I am  And she‚Äôs a evil witch! She is not good for anything but starting trouble with racism! She‚Äôs very good at that ! Why do they say she‚Äôs black when her notionally is different! Please answer this!And you know Biden is not all their!
Vote for Biden/ Harris.What have you got to lose?
Lol. Time will tell cuz Biden is winning
Biden will lock Trump,in the bunker.
Every time you feel the urge to take a shot at Biden or Harris, redirect that shit toward Trump. There is a country to save.
no biden voters allowed to read my tweets
My father (MI) Trump My mother (MI) Trump My step father (MI) Trump My uncles (IN) Trump My my aunts (IN) Biden Myself (Macomb County) Biden My wife (Macomb County) Biden My mother in law (MI) Biden My father in law (MI) Trump
I never said it did.  To me voting Green is a way not to vote for Biden or Trump.  I am voting Trump. A vote he should never have got and a vote Joe is expecting based on my voter registration.
I respect your point of view. The corporate interests used millions to insert their corporate puppet and set back the progressives movement.  I would hate it if I voted green and Biden won.  A vote for trump is most revolting thing I can do to the cheating DNC.
Yep a very cynical ploy by Trump. Vote for Joe Biden!
Can someone tell me one good thing about Biden?
I am voting trump because I hate Corporate owned puppets. Those folks are Republicans who like to feel good about themselves pretending to care about the less fortunate.   If trump wins in two short years we start nomination process. If Biden wins a decade is wasted.
I appreciate your point of view.    I am voting trump.   Why?  If Biden wins we don‚Äôt have a primary in 2024.  To hell with that. Four more years of trump is a million times better than a waste of ten years with Biden.
Biden / Harris ... lock em up
Per Biden's rule, perhaps you're not really Latino. üòâ
That‚Äôs understandable because BIDEN did not pick her. The leftists who pull his strings picked her.
Biden voted against the working class from 73-2009. He voted for cutting social security 4 times. He was for such liberal favorites as Citizens United. He is for no Wall Street or Banking super vision.   Which of those is driving you to vote Joe?  What votes Joe made do you like
He can reach into my pants. What does that even mean?  For 47 years he voted with GOP. Now a ten minute talk to Bernie and all is well?    Hell no buddy.  Never Biden.
I‚Äôm obviously bored here and am immaturely splitting hairs here but Biden served from 73-09 as a ‚Äú Republican ‚Äú err democrat Senator. 47 years in DC.  Shitty 47 years.  As you can tell I‚Äôm bored.  Take care
Prison populations will explode if people are dumb enough to fall for her and Biden‚Äôs bullshit
Ending the ACA is step 1 in implementing Medicare for All.  No problem so far.   Seriously Biden is the least attractive bring nothing to the table candidate in more than 50 years.  His nomination and failure to get elected will sadden so many Centrists. Thoughts and Prayers
Join me in supporting Joe Biden via
‚ÄúBiden believes in killing babies at 9 months‚Äù God I don‚Äôt have the mental capacity for this today.
She signed to agree with Trump on more than a few unsavory issues, and with the ‚ÄúDefund the police‚Äù sentiment being so strong atm it‚Äôs just another example of Biden being shortsighted in the face of his goals. ‚ÄúI Need to get my black vote back up, get a black lady right?‚Äù Wrong1
Not to me.  Biden is a Corporate owned puppet.  No Medicare for all no vote for Joe.
Look at the big picture.  Bernie had largest crowds at every rally. Huge stadiums at times.  Biden had a rally today. 63 folks showed up. Corporate interests are saving millions for themselves nominating Biden. I would rather lose to trump than be cheated by the DNC again.
Funny how trump gave the 1% a permanent tax cut. The rest of us got a small temporary cut. Now he is making up stuff about Biden. Remember when Obama/Biden fixed the economic mess left by Bush? I guess Biden will have to clean up an even bigger mess this time. #TrumpDepression
Ma‚Äôam I‚Äôve got many history books. Ever notice in school they never mentioned Nixon?  The history books our kids get in school is the history corporate America wants our kids to believe.   100 of the richest Americans forced Biden on us. We will do all we can to beat him
The Biden campaign is looking more and more like "Weekend at Bernies."
I watched this multiple times. You're missing the point. Biden can disagree with somebody &amp; realize they have a lot to offer even if they have a different opinion on something. This is leadership  &amp; Character.   Donald Trump will fire you if you disagree with his ideas.
I‚Äôd  care if Corporate interests didn‚Äôt nominate Biden.  DNC cheats us. Then cry‚Äôs when GOP cheats them.
You should spend some time doing research before you blast out comments on Twitter. It's clearly documented that Joe Biden grew up with his stuttering problem.  Biden has overcome his insecurities about stuttering. Trump has never overcome his insecurities resulting in narcissism
I won‚Äôt vote for Biden
Per this debate video on June, 2019, #KamalaHarrisVP skewered &amp; grilled #BidenCoalition?!? WTHeck. üò≤ Now, they are Friends?  Fishy. Slimy.   Kamala Harris confronts Joe Biden in tense exchange on race relations  via
No thanks Sir.  Corporate interests inserted their puppet Biden into the nomination.  Maybe 2024. Good luck.
So what are you saying?  Sounds like your saying ‚Äú Bernie raised funds, Wall Street won‚Äôt allow him to win.  You are voting Biden.  I think that is what your saying.  I respect your decision. üëçüèª.  It‚Äôs a free country.  I‚Äôm voting against Biden the corporate selected nominee.
If this is true then donald trump and biden both have an IQ of 228
Well duhhh!  Exact reason I‚Äôm asking Green voters to vote trump.  Keep worthless corporate owned Biden out of office all together.   Ten steps ahead of you there.
Hell know to Biden and Harris!
So did The Simpsons predict a Biden/Harris ticket and were they in the white house, we need to know
DOJ? PFFT. Please with a criminal as AG. I can't wait to see these criminals go to prison. Biden has already said he will not stand in the way of investigation and incarceration of these criminals.
I know folks not voting for Trump, but it has the feel of a bit larger Trump win than ‚Äò16. I think Trump is the beneficiary of the pandemic lockdowns, followed by BLM riots and a cognitively challenged Biden!
If Biden wins, Trump will be spending 2021 in court and potentially jail. If he wins and they lose control of the senate, Pence will be President because Trump will be removed.

Obama Biden sold 20% of U.S. uranium to Russia and personally profited from the sale. Just like you profited from Ukraine and China.
Wouldnt someone who champions Biden and the cop be outing themselves as well?
Awesome!!!! GO BIDEN AND HARRIS!!
Netflix is not a propaganda machine? I mean, Obama is part of netflix is he not?  Yes the US (cia..intelligence agencies)have done and allowed some creepy things...u see Trump is cleaning out deep state  pedophiles, thieves like biden, child traffickers...that's why trumps hated
Yeh...just like the deep state dumbasses biden..Harris...Schumer..Pelosi...r going to "really" change things for the better...this time.. really ? just vote for Trump..do yourself &amp; your family a favor...Trump has done more in 3  years than the last 4 puppets put together, awake!
- Biden is leading in 5 of the top 6 battleground states and the other one he is tied with Trump.   - His current average overall approval rating is 43.4%  If you don‚Äôt believe the polls, okay so be it, but he‚Äôs blatantly making shit up here. Come on now lol be better.
Are we supposed to vote for Biden and Harris because they are the best the Democratic Party has to offer or because one was Obama‚Äôs VP and the other is an African American woman?   Tell me the policy reasons I should vote for them. Don‚Äôt try to win me over with heartstrings.

I‚Äôm not mad at you because of your pension. I‚Äôm happy and proud for you.  Your vote to these Corporate owned Puppets to continue voting against the working class.  I hate Joe Biden , the anti christ of the Dems. He voted against me 1973-20009. I can understand boomers like him.
Please add Joe Biden to the mix.
How it happened: Inside Biden's search for a running mate
You mean the lady that gave Hillary Clinton all the answers during the debate? No!     She‚Äôs probably already giving CNN, MSMBC ideas on how to put and ear piece on Biden‚Äôs ear so they can do the same
I'm not gonna pretend that Biden, any dem or a politician is squeaky clean. I'm not naive. That said, we've seen trump enrich himself and his cronies right out in the open. How many of the small business loans went to his friends and himself.
Whitmer told Biden she didn't want VP spot, urged him to choose Black woman  via
I bet 100.00 she is on a pension. Biden and the corporate elite voted to abolish those in the 70s for most of us. They were grandfathered in to keeping it.  My dad likes Biden too. He earned his pension and loves his party.  In my estimation this party dies with the boomers
He didn‚Äôt say that.  He said it‚Äôs further to the left than it‚Äôs ever been, but that platform has nothing to do with Biden.
That is frickin halarious. You know Biden could do that cuz clown donald can barely make it off the news conference stage without holding onto a wall or column. Watch trumpy when he exits from a stage. His balance is way off; something not right there.
Hey. You vote how you vote. I‚Äôll handle mine.  The most damage I can do to this filthy Biden nomination is to vote trump.  The greens are a wonderful  option.  A trump vote is double damage. A vote trump should not have received and a vote a progressive would have got.
Because here‚Äôs the thing: you‚Äôre not voting for Biden.  You‚Äôre voting for Ruth Bader Ginsberg‚Äôs successor.  It‚Äôs choosing between getting shot in the knee or shot in the gut, but if you choose neither, then someone else takes the bullet for you.
I assume I'm considered a "house-wife" since I stay home to raise my son and finish my multiple degrees. But I can say that trump got it very wrong. This "house-wife" (I hate this term) is voting for Biden/Harris!!!
I dislike them both, but as I‚Äôve said over and over again, I‚Äôm not voting for Biden, but RBG‚Äôs successor.
The concerns are legitimate, because voting for Biden is painful.  However, this isn‚Äôt an election where you vote to get someone IN, this is an election where you‚Äôre trying to get someone OUT.  If Joe doesn‚Äôt do the right thing in four years, then vote him out too.
Biden passes over Whitmer, taps Kamala Harris for vice presidential nod  via
As bad as Biden and Harris are, they at least have people like Warren, Sanders, and the BLM movement nudging them in different directions.  All I can hope is that they listen, because four more tears of Trump is just the start of the worse alternative.
I understand your position. I was in it every election from 88 forward trying to get a Republican out of office.  Since we now nominate republicans I haven‚Äôt a worry in the world.  Either way these clowns are bad options. 1 has a max of 4 years left. Biden will waste 8.
Anybody realize joe Biden been in office for longer than any of us have been alive, (most of my followers) and still Has yet to change anything, what makes anyone think he will now ?üòÇ
The leverage will or will not be made in November.  If Biden wins progressive agenda is delayed a decade or more. Trump wins, we start fundraising at the mid terms.  We nominated a Republican. I prefer the other Republican which we can get rid of in 4 years.
That‚Äôs were our opinions differ. 100 of the richest Americans donate to the Super Pacs.  They decided Biden was best for them.  Now you decide if Corporate interests have scared you into voting for their choice?  I‚Äôm not scared.  Never Biden
Bruh I promise I‚Äôll still vote for Biden/Harris as a lot of us will.   I‚Äôm not gonna be fuckin thrilled about it tho. Please just admit you‚Äôre a moderate if you love this pairing, PLEASE.
No chance in hell im voting Biden.  The corporate scare tactics are bullshit.  They bail themselves out every time anyway. 24 trillion deficit on the Conservative watch?  It‚Äôs all a bunch of bullshit. Never Biden.
...I barely rock with Biden and nothing could ever make me roll with Kamala!
WTF are you to judge my progressiveness?   DNC loaded up corporate puppets with cash to run against four progressives.  All corporate puppets lost. That is an act of political war.  Biden and every corporate puppet on all of our ballots should be voted against. Biden voted w GOP.
Here‚Äôs Biden and Paul Ryan‚Äôs
Kamala and Biden have always been friends. Don't doublethink!
Are you saying Biden doesn't have money he brought in Kamala for money? üôÑüôÑ..  Do you follow American politics? First of she got this VP ticket based on her black race (Mixed Indian race is added bonus, if she is pure Indian, she won't be in the race for sure)
So apparently some of the first real oppo they release on  is basically reminding voters that the Biden-Harris White House will end the discriminatory cash bail system in this country
Politics is a chess game. Few Americans play chess. Joe Biden doesn't. In this game, he is NOT a King, he is a little soldier that Dems move to the left. Pretty soon, he'll fall of the chess board. Kamala is NOT a Queen either. She is a chameleon, who is easily changing colors.
The positive would be a Biden Harris loss.
Biden sets the progressives movement back a decade if he wins.  He brings nothing to the table.  This democrat is voting trump and you should too.
We nominated a corporate owned pimp which would push progressive adgenda back a decade if he wins. If trump wins, at mid terms of his second term we could start backing a progressive.  No votes for Biden.
No . If Biden wants to run , he has to debate . Nobody gives a shit about the VP ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
She‚Äôs a terrible person to be giving more power to , between her and Biden they will explode the prison population in this country
I was talking to a few of my neighbors last night, they support Biden, and one of them said she worried what white men will think about Harris. I said I don‚Äôt give a shit what white men think, I care about what black women think. #BidenHarris2020
That‚Äôs exactly why I‚Äôm not voting for Biden.  Your comment meant for Dank just resonates in my mind. An anti Biden tv add should be produced using your very own beautiful words. Honestly you have talent.
Most Americans r not that stupid, biden? Somatic narcissist dumbass..Harris a covert narcissist mirrors everyone...what? MSM has deceived many to hate Trump...the spirit is called leviathan ...Jezebel/narcissist have this spirit also..it twist truth
Hell no. .....  Say Biden wins..... progressive agenda is pushed back a decade at best.  If Trump wins we start fundraising in 2 years for a progressive replacement to trump in 4 years.  No one who demands Medicare for All should vote for Biden.
Yeh cus it's a joke..lost 9 billion ? The postal service needs to b put into the private sector,so the scum in Washington  like biden..Pelosi, Schumer, Harris, who like to skim the take, b thankful we now have a president who is stopping the  skim, surprised u didn't know that
Corporate interests picked Harris. Biden is the complete puppet.
HARRIS IS A HYPOCRITE WHO SAID SHE BELIEVED THE WOMAN WHO COMPLAIN THAT BIDEN IS A PEDOPHILE. HAVE A GOOD DEMOCRAT KKK
Joe Biden is a secret Muslim? What happened? Did Obama secretly convert him? Did Obama convert Biden over to Marxism as well? Is Scranton, PA really part of America? Joe! Where's your birth certificate?
He is, but he also realizes that he needs his voters to support Biden or trump will win again
Seems like #Russia's Putin wants Trump to win the election and #China's Xi Jinping wants Joe Biden to win the election üòÇüòÇüòÖ  #MAGA #KamalaHarris
The real sad thing about this Biden/Harris ticket is that as a Palestinian there really is no good option for president. Both candidates and their VPs are unabashedly pro-Israel and don't even attempt to hide it with the typical two state solution lines.
No she didn‚Äôt change her mind! She‚Äôs looking at this as a opportunity if Biden gets sick she can take over as President!
Don‚Äôt think so! She won‚Äôt be debating ! It will be trump and Biden!
White larpers pulling a Joe Biden on this guy and telling him you ain't really black...

Joe and Beau Biden of course.
Joe Biden has hired me, "the gray fox", to "steal" the election... Easy for me ..
Wasn't that long ago Harris said that Biden was a sexist and molested women...so these things are no longer true?
I take it this means Harris no longer believes that Biden is a racist and a sexist...my how opinions change when you're bought off.
You actually asked Joe Biden that Cher? What was his answer? You couldn't be any happier Cher.  Im as happy as a clam or better.

Loved meeting you back in 2018 Abdul. I think you‚Äôre right on this. I hope you also keep forcefully pushing the Biden campaign on Medicare4all since that is one of the main reasons I was a huge supporter of you back then.
Lmaooo I‚Äôm scheduling a Biden rally on the corner of 25 and Shelby
I disagree. Biden‚Äôs pull with those Obama / Trump voters is masssive and under reported. They will turn out where it counts.. People seem to forget that Trump won by &lt; 100k perfectly placed votes. If I recall correctly he won MI by 17k. Those votes are gone.
You may not like him, you may love him, but one day his campaign will be studied in social media marketing classes around the world...he‚Äôs a genius and joe Biden is a racist pedo pig
Joe Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
If pwning the libz is good enough for the "red pilled" crowd why shouldn't we vote Biden/Harris just to piss y'all off?  LOL
Went to the grocery store after hearing that Kamala Harris will be Biden's VP  Could not stop smiling at the little Black girls who will grow up and see themselves in her.  Let's do this.
Proud to be a Biden Supporter!
I don't want to do it. I don't like Biden one bit.  He doesn't' represent me at all. But I will do it, because I must, because the alternative is a threat to democracy itself.
OMG  The woman that pointed out your racist behavior during the debates is now your running mate what is this world coming to? Show your white privilege Joe Biden your brain is mush old man
Go google Biden‚Äôs voting record from 73-09. Then stick your head in a soiled toilet and flush.  You have no idea what you are talking about.
I know isn't great Cher.  Im so so happy. I tweeted her to send my congratulations to her. Kamala Harris and Joe Biden are to do a great job. In fact they right now doing a great Birthday. Trump is already running scared. He knows that Biden has the upper hand and may just win.
Agreed. This was my hope since Biden became the presumptive nominee. So pumped. It‚Äôs been a joy watching most of the reaction.
Vote Trump nothing harms Corporate pimp Biden more.
I hope you understand now that Joe Biden can careless about you. You have an opportunity to redeem yourself, cut the cord with Sleepy and focus on your career. By him being racist and picking only a women with color you should be upset. He will never win with her!
Green is great. Trump votes are more damaging to Biden.  I‚Äôm not sure how many 29 dollar Bernie donations I made.  Close to 3500 I can account for. ( I smoke ) can‚Äôt always remember.....  DNC fucked me out of 3500ish. Trump it is this ballot
They will when we start winning. This Biden nomination saved me a small fortune in political contributions. I gave 100 to that 70 something year old lady to retire.   That lady, is gunna be most of us if we don‚Äôt eliminate the corporate owned DNC and their gaggle of puppets
May I ask are you turning out to vote Biden?  Only fair to say I am not.
I cannot get rid of a Biden, Kamala Harris header üòµ
Do I just roll with people that are a lot further left than Biden/Harris, and they really ARE a good representation of most dems? Idk who I wanted him to pick, but she‚Äôs just never been someone I‚Äôm excited about.
She‚Äôs a liar also! But then Biden is also!
Oh my God this woman is a liar! She knows Biden is a racist!
This was the difference between Sanders and Warren. This is why I had to vote Biden in my state primary.   DON'T LET THE PERFECT BE THE ENEMY OF THE FANTASTIC
Bullshit! He picked who he wanted.   I wanted Warren/Harris. Then Biden/Warren. But I GOT Biden/Harris and guess what? It's STILL going to be a successful ticket and they'll accomplish great things.  COVID has validated Warren policies. She'll be unstoppable in the '21 Senate
Remember when Trump told Chris Wallace there‚Äôs no enthusiasm for Biden. Keep thinking that, big guy.
Well considering Biden doesn't even know where he is you better hope you're right on that.
My dream was Bernie Sanders and Andrew Yang and here we are with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris...
What a terrible choice. Good ole Joe. Politics at its best. Biden sucks.
Um-lil creepy.  Your crystal ball telling you that Biden is going somewhere?
Biden-Harris has been my dream ticket for some time, so I love today‚Äôs news. I also love how many other absolutely incredible women have been in the public eye as serious contenders more than prepared for the office.
Do ‚Å¶‚Å¶ &amp; ‚Å¶‚Å¶ remember this ‚Å¶ statement or are they too busy soaking in the praise from the liberal media who only loves republicans when they attack republicans?

Hi I'm just tweeting you to CONGRATULATE you on recieving the highest honor for any woman thus far.  Joe Biden selected you to be his running mate. That is great news. You and Joe Biden will make a great team as our President ( Joe Biden ).
Oh my Gosh they are throwing everything in the mix to try to get this idiot elected!!! Let‚Äôs see if this really happens when the TRUMP Administration is our and BIDEN is in!!!
Are you on drugs?  Did they not have books in your school?  Joe Biden voted with the GOP from 73-09.  He can unify a damn thing. Don‚Äôt even let me get started on you.....

Yes Cher this is a time to celebrate and dance around with love in our ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§üíòüíò. Because it is the day that Former Vice President Joe Biden selected Sen Harris as his running mate. All of us woman should all go and play your song WOMANS WORLD.  It would sound perfect now.
My fear is I‚Äôve seen this movie many times before.  Biden wins the DNC will fuck up the next 10 years with their corporate puppets.  The key is to cause them to lose. And try again in 2024.

Crazy as it sounds......  I too thought of 3rd party.  Idiot Biden could still win.  I‚Äôm voting in a ‚Äú Bi-partisan manner for Trump‚Äù.  I hate trump. But I‚Äôm not wasting 4,8,12, up to 16 years on Biden and Harris corporate asses.
Kamala Harris used to work with Hunter Biden doing what who knows? She enforced that 1994 crime bill against black defendants to its full extent. As a student of former mayor Willie Brown , whom she had an alleged affair with  Willie said she would make a lousy president!
You're out your damn mind. Trump has done WAY more for the Black/Hispanic communities than any other president. Biden on the other hand says you aint black if you don't vote for him
Progressives will definitely NOT get on Board with a Biden/Harris ticket you can be sure of that
Ridin' with Biden and Harris!! Lets dump Trump!
me when im seeing all this new biden/kamala merch
You're not making any sense, if Russia has already purchased Biden then  that's who they would want in the office ad president.   Russia has purchased Donald, Mitch McConnell,  and grassley
Please help support Joe Biden 2020, add a #Twibbon now!
Okay somebody needs to do some research. Every single thing Biden did regarding this situation has already been evaluated. Watch the entire tape &amp; read the articles.   Stop using propaganda that's faults.  Research dude research.
Two racist people and Biden cannot even talk or form a sentence or answer questions Harris wants to defend police, to losses
Presumptive of me, but I'm really proud of Joe Biden for choosing a woman who hit him hard in the debate. He's showing us he's a man who can take criticism and doesn't hold grudges. How refreshing.
This fella has a real good YouTube show.  I watch it daily.  He is a Republican but not the idiot wearing an AR15 to the grocery store kind.  Kind of a silly post,  maybe he is paid by the comment or retweet.  Biden‚Äôs nomination took me from MSNBC and politics until 2023 ....
Ok is that why she went and met with Biden last week .
Biden has to win first. Cast your vote wisely.  I don‚Äôt need a corporate owned incumbent in 2024. I‚Äôm voting trump. This way we can nominate a progressive or elect yet another Republican.  Corporate Dems are worthless
Remember the debate where Kamala Harris heavily criticized Biden on busing? Picking Harris speaks volumes about the kind of man Joe Biden is. Does anyone think President Man-Baby would or could pick someone who wouldn't kiss his fat ass day in, day out?
Kamala Harris is announced as Joe Biden's running mate(VP), her mother is a tamilian (Dad is an African American). Joe Biden's memory is getting so bad, if Biden wins, he may not continue as a President for long, Kamala may take over. Congrats Kamala üëçüèº
Why was msmbc so late in announcing Biden‚Äôs vp pick
Hey everyone, only rational reasons for spreading your cheeks after a rigged primary and STILL voting for Biden after a shitty VP pick in the replies!
I‚Äôm crying right now! I always thought she would be the perfect strong lady to stand up for America and be the perfect partner for President Biden! America should be Dancing in the streets to have such a brilliant beautiful WOMAM as VP! trump is shakin in his boots!
Hell yeah!  I‚Äôm way more excited about Kamala than Biden but let‚Äôs do this!!! #bluewave #KamalaHarrisForVP #BidenHarris2020
Biden/Harris was the obvious ticket. She can now push police reform as a former AG, she's got a ton of charisma that'll remind people of Obama, and it'll set Dems up for 12 years in office when she runs in '24. #BidenHarris2020
I can't wait for VP Harris to be the girl power face of what's sure to be a brutal, sustained, and punitive crackdown on protests using faceless federal troops the SECOND Biden wins. Assuming he does of course, and that's no slam dunk.
Joe Biden just lost his 2020 election good going üòÇ
Joe biden ran for president in 1988 and got caught for lying and it took him out the race, then he ran again after that in 2008 and lost to your ‚Äúgreat‚Äù Obama, so please tell me how you want somebody like this in office LMAO
Kamala Harris is, objectively, the worst possible choice for the Democrats to put in the White House alongside Joe Biden.  Not because she is a woman, but because when she had the power to help people facing injustice from law enforcement, she did nothing. She. Did. Nothing.
Fuck. I knew i should have bought one of those Biden Harris websites when they were doing the primaries coz i knew this was coming
Biden/Harris - the comprehensive rapist/mass incarceration bootlicker 2020.  Trump is Rapist/Religious Mysogynist.  There is no "win" here.

Trump: 'Some people would say men are insulted' by Joe Biden choosing a woman as VP
If biden picks whitmer my dad might vote for them. Just depends how they feel about military spending.
Have you noticed how Trump doesn‚Äôt talk about his own plans for the future but all he does is critisize Biden? Maybe it‚Äôs because he doesn‚Äôt have any plans?
There's a difference between a country wanting somebody as president and country manipulating an election to get their candidate. We already know Russia is actively manipulating, using social media. Germany would like to see Biden. Does that make them an enemy of the state.
Wow he never said that. But since you can't remember what city you are in it makes sense you would say that. Nice new slogan SETTLE FOR BIDEN shows real enthusiasm huh.
I'm trying to get your point here. So who really cares if China wants Biden to be president. We all know Russia, a much more dangerous entity, wants and will manipulate to have Donald j Trump remain president. You forget they helped him win in 2016.
And he accuses VP Biden of cognitive slippage. There are montages, like this, of coo coo for Cocoa Puffs moments from DJT. Yikes.

Yeah except even trump is trying to do something for the voters Biden doesn‚Äôt care about.  Kind of amazing we nominated a Corporate owned pimp.
I am pretty sure Biden said he will accept the nomination from his home so I think the majority of the convention will be virtual
Biden is the absolute worst nomination ever.  Read that.
I think you mean Biden &amp; Obama.  bragged about blackmailing the Ukrainians. Joe got his useless son huge jobs &amp; contracts without any qualifications.  was friends with leaders of Cuba &amp; Venezuela. Did nothing against Russia, China, NK &amp; helped Iran.
No I think it‚Äôs Byee Biden! You are a disgrace!
Could have stopped at ‚Äúpeople aren‚Äôt impressed with Biden‚Äù
With his first breath after Biden makes the announcement
I think Kamala Harris is going to be Biden's VP pick.  She checks all the boxes for the Dems.  If Whitmer is picked for the job; she should resign as Governor of MI.  It's only fair to the taxpayers of MI.
is a tool! Instead of reviving fabulous Robin Williams' career, killed him again like the ex-wife(ves) who siphoned $$ forcing him to take so-so projects just to pay bills. Zelda could have also aired Other Jokes to showcase Robin's talent.

I gotta ask, why aren‚Äôt Dems taking this approach? Seriously, just start making up awesome stuff about Biden and who cares about how realistic it is?
This coming from the campaign attempting to cast doubt on Biden‚Äôs mental faculties. Orwellian is appropriate.

Ted or whatever your real name is......  would you like me to post your campaign contributions from Corporate America.  More and more Americans are putting together that corporate interests pay you to vote against the people.  Your no Joe Biden or anything but you have no room
Joe Biden only cares about corporate interests. He has been a corporate puppet since 1973.  He is so weak and revolting he may lose.

Hey Biden you couldn't pass rotc,you failed in rotc had nothing but c and ds in college your a failure,and a disgrace to be running for president. You and Kamala are a disgrace to man
Seriously? And he calls Biden demented? Lol
But YOU stepped all over this fantastic news by going after Harris and Biden instead of delaying comments on them to promote the agreement. YOUR fault! Not the fake news fault. YOU handed them the methodology to undermine your achievement
Don't vote for air head biden and dumb ass kamala they will screw the world up and then the ones who vote for him will be crying cause jobs will disapear in PA and people are gonna have to pay high taxes. Wake up America pull your head out of your asses. VOTE FOR TRUMP

Biden didn't ask for dirt Trump did although Trump's sons had business deals in Russia yet you didn't bat an eye about that..
You say Biden is creepy but a case can be made for Trump as well so wouldn't that make you a hypocrite?
I'm not a socialist and neither is Biden. Biden holds more conservative values than Trump actually. As I feel being a conservative means you're a true man of God, spreading the love of Jesus Christ.

The Anti-Biden people are much better off trying to push Conservatives to vote for Libertarians, but that makes too much sense and is maybe too much work for them.
The reason I say he has more conservative values is because a true conservative is a man of God and there's no question that Biden is more a man of God than Trump is
Biden is not far left and if your mind was not easily influenced by conspiracy theories you'd realize this in fact he has more conservative values than Trump has...
Also this has nothing to do with Trump I was just telling you what Biden said...what you don't believe there are crooked cops? Really?
No they're not...you do realize that Biden is for the exact opposite right?

Biden will probably have his hands all over Harris since he likes touching women and she is a nasty animal that needs here rabies vac.These 2 are the biggest joke I have ever seen. DON'T VOTE FOR BIDEN N HARRIS THEY WILL F#*K US AMERICANS OVER VERY BAD DON'T BE
You got to watch governor Whitmer she all mad cause she can't see glory and stars now that she was not picked by Biden,She is a sell out,she suppose to care for michiganders but she sure was kissing biden feet to be elected vp.another joke
Hey there's the 2 biggest liars and crooks around. Hope yall know all the blood spilled from americans and the children are on your heads Kamala and Biden and rest of the dems.Democrats are nasty,liars,crooks and MURDERERS. KAMALA AND BIDEN SUCK WITH THE OTHER DEMS
Make them viable during the midterm and primaries. Voting for them now is wasting a vote and giving Trump the win. Biden and Kamela would be the better option of the only two we actually have.

Recently yeah, that's all I've been watching of either guy. I think Biden's strategy lately has been good in that there hasn't been a lot of material, but the problem is that the material that there is lately hasn't been good, the Vette commercial excepted which was quality
Let's worry about getting Biden and Kamala in the office before berating them on policies and past behavior. Sure, we can scrutinize. But I fear we run the risk of wavering minds voting 3rd party. Not a risk we should be willing to make.
Then a non vote for Trump is a vote for Biden. I‚Äôm not voting for Trump then lol
Bad, but shit Biden's looking worse lately. I watched a few videos of him now vs him during Obama, and it's brutal. I'm hoping for some type of clarity during the debates
Might not logically follow, but still true. Biden hasn't been looking good.
Kamala is a leftist along with others like Old ass Bernie.they are nothing but trouble DO NOT VOTE FOR BIDEN &amp;KAMALA THERE GONNA DESTROY AMERICA.ALL AMERICANS NEED TO OPEN THERE EYES AND SEE HOW BAD THEY ARE.ETS KEEP AMERICA GREAT WITH TRUMP.
Hell  yes Biden is a joke,and kamala is to.they are both racest. This election is the biggest circus event ever. Joe Biden is the stupid ring master.. Kamala Harris is no damn good for America..Dems are so far left it's pitiful.this election is a JOKE,JOKE
It‚Äôs got to be a coordinated thing; it happened so suddenly. Can‚Äôt believe it was to overshadow Biden‚Äôs VP pick, but it was definitely on purpose.
Biden lost my vote with that pick. It‚Äôs sad because I had higher expectations for him.
Vote for America!  Vote for Liberty for all! Vote Trump 2020 and John James 2020!  We need people who love OUR Country! Trump does not take one dime from this country and he has only been in office for 3 years!  The Biden group have been around for 45 years...look at the mess!

Trump Warns of What China Will Do if Biden Wins in November
Why do you think she deserves 95% of the African Vote?  Because she's an African American female or some other reason.   Name one good thing she's done as a Senator?   Just for kicks, name one think Biden has done in 47 years in Washington.
Biden and Harris could both shoot me on 5th Avenue, and I'd still vote for them. #truth
I want at least that. Biden isn‚Äôt as right wing as Trump and certainly not as impulsive.
So get four more years of Trump then? If you can‚Äôt have it 100% your way, you‚Äôd prefer total defeat? That‚Äôs childish.  I dislike Biden. He‚Äôs creepy. He‚Äôs corrupt. Likely not sincere. Now take those qualities, shift them even farther right, and you get Trump. That‚Äôs worse.
Well, we *had* other options.  They‚Äôre not available anymore. Not for THIS election cycle.  Biden, even if only barely, is better than Trump. The least we can do is vote for the lesser evil and try harder to support truly progressive candidates. Maybe Yang can win in 2024.
When she ran for Senate she did a lot of things to build her name up. Now just a couple years later she is going against everything she stood for in order to sell her souls to the devil aka Joe Biden
Progressives: I feel you. Biden wasn‚Äôt in my top 5 for the presidential primary. Your jaded feelings are valid, but don‚Äôt lose the hope.  We have two allies in  &amp;  They can only pull off big upsets if they get Bernie-level fundraising. Follow &amp; donate!
Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt want to help you. He wants a return to the status quo, and he‚Äôll use your fear of four more years of Trump to do it. (Just a reminder, the status quo fucking sucked for everybody)
We cannot take anything about this race for granted, and I look forward to turning out the 12th district and all of Michigan for Vice President Biden and Senator Harris in November, to protect our country and democracy.

Biden loves little kids he's a damn creep and he's more racist then anyone I've ever seen also people make remarks of racial slurs all the time shit happens people make white racial jokes but yet don't see me complaining? Idgf what people say it's what they do..
Oh wait it does Joe Biden said he would only pick a African American Lady! Hypocrite!
If you did the research you'd know how corrupt the Trump admin is too  Yes. I'm willing to take Biden over Trump knowing full well both are still evil. Trump is more evil. As I said in 2016, we deserve better choices. Socialism&gt;fascism any day.

Can I just vote for Biden/Harris now please?
Biden 2020-2024, Harris 2024-2032 then Abrams 2032-2040. Let the healing begin!
It will be the down fall of America if biden and kamala get elected. Democrats would screw up a wet dream.

Hey Nancy Pelosi since you ass hole democrats can't come to an agreement how bout you,shumar,biden,and other dems take the Americans that get evicted and have no money to feed there kids let these americans move in with you. I think that's a good idea since yall don't
hey Dan I was listening to news this afternoon and heard biden has to elect a black women lol.this president election has nothing to do with us americans. It only is about money and racism. This is all a joke. The hell with dems there liars and crooks
I could give two shits about who he picks. A woman of color who will do absolutely nothing for black Americans, just like Biden and Obama.
Need one similar which says,  "Real Atheists  For Biden".

Has some of our americans seen what a racist really is. It's Joe Biden,if you have noticed all the mistakes he makes are about black people.. Joe Biden is showing his true colors.Joe biden is against us Americans he shows it every day. Pelosi and Shumar don't care
Dear me, at least he is talking in sentences.  Joe Biden has can't even say words on the first or second time.
Or whoever the Democrats might pick as Biden's replacement.
They say they're pro life but don't understand how some Democrats are too like Biden they just don't think it should be government controlled. If anything they should be furious with the person that invented abortion in the first place that's what I do.
Rice, though never elected to anything, is a foreign policy expert with a very close personal relationship to Biden. Whitmer has been a governor for less than two years, with no federal government experience.  But she's white. And to Biden, that's the winning ticket. (10/10)
Whitmer's selection also has the added bonus of delivering Michigan's first Black governor if Biden is elected, as our lieutenant governor is Garlin Gilchrist, a Black man. (8/10)
I wouldn't be surprised if Biden is making the following calculations:  "Black people will largely come out and vote for me no matter what because they're scared of Trump. Progressives will come out because they're scared of Trump... (5/10)
They are all for workers' rights and so on. But they are not joining the protests in the streets. In fact, they are made fairly uncomfortable by most talk about race and racism, as it seems Biden often is. (4/10)
These moderate (white) voters would be okay with a woman being one heartbeat away from the presidency. But not a Black woman. Especially in the age of Black Lives Matter.   I grew up in Delaware and Pennsylvania. I lived with the kind of white moderate Democrat Biden is. (3/10)
My prediction: Joe Biden will select Gretchen Whitmer as his VP candidate.  Why? Because she's white.  Biden's whole theory from the jump of the campaign has been to flip moderate (white) Midwestern voters who voted for Trump in 2016, narrowly giving him the White House. (1/10)
Joe Biden twenty twenty

To stop the American people‚Äôs time from being further wasted on unproven rumors, could the media possibly attempt to not imply or claim either candidate is under foreign control without any evidence? #US #politics

If he wants the black vote, he needs a vow of solidarity. Or else they will vote for Kanye (as Ye admitted that was the only reason he was running). Gretchen would be a FINE pick. But I think if Biden wants to WIN, now is not the time.

Seven years and hundreds of millions donated and the biggest gain in institutional racism you describe was criminal justice reform by a politician that never received a penny.  Despite that, BLM will assuredly endorse people like Joe Biden who helped jail more blacks.  Good luck.

I told Hillary in 16 that she needs Chinese bots to defeat Trump's Russian bots. She didn't listen therefore she didn't get elected. Biden's campaign did! You win by fighting fire with fire!!! He gets it!

Our situation is so bad you have consider at least three entirely plausible and horrible outcomes: the election is sabotaged or outright cancelled, Trump just wins outright, Biden wins and runs a left-bashing (figuratively and literally) administration
You're just never going to convince me that voting for Biden is anything other than indulging a desperately false hope  If that's what you wanna, I won't argue, but we are fucked. That's reality. It's what it is. The sooner you accept that the easier the rest of this will be

I think Obama‚Äôs biggest mistake was underestimating what an ass #MoscowMitch would be.  He has already said if Biden wins and he is still majority leader nothing will get voted on
I think the hope is Biden wins and we get competent Presidential leadership and by spring things are more under control
So if Something happens to Biden, which it very well might, Hariss will take over? Big Yikes.
I think you missed my point. In any event, anybody Biden offers a job will do well under his experience and leadership, whether or not they've had a similar position before. Buttigieg is an asset to the party that should be nurtured rather than sidelined.
It mobilized libs, which is why the worst candidate won too. They go back to sleep when biden goes in. We don't.

Prediction:  Trump will make a joke  (or lots of jokes)  about how he should debate Kamala instead of Biden, because she's the real ticket.  Enough to goad Joe into making a statement that he's not going to step aside once elected.
You checked your "Christianity" at the door, pal. Biden is an ardent Catholic. Seems like you might need to revisit the teachings of Christ. And why, as a man of the cloth, are you wading in to politics?

Let's be doubly clear on why. Biden is no better than Trump - Biden just hides it better. He's racist, misogynist, and wants to cut all social safety nets (the latter, he's been VERY clear on). I cannot, in good conscience, vote for that. I just can't.
I absolutely am. I'm a strong left Independent. Dem party gave me NOTHING to vote for. I'm not asking for everything I would like to see happen. But I'm not being offered ANYTHING from Biden. So no. I'll be voting Green to give 3rd party viability. M4A is my MINIMUM requirement.
ROFLMAO! It'll be history alright. A fucking fascist is gonna get a second term. Jesus Christ.  Biden did a GREAT job at pushing out the largest voting bloc.   All he had to do was select a progressive. He couldn't even do that.   I'm voting Green and my conscience is clear.

Harris as VP pick actually rules because you don't even have to feel a little bad about not voting for Joe Biden
Did Biden choose Kamala just to get the Black vote?
Picking a cop as the #VPPick during the largest social uprisings in a generation, fighting police brutality/systemic racism is probably the most tone deaf move #Biden could have made here. Learn to read a room, dude.
Kamala Harris is Biden‚Äôs VP? The Democrats really are doing everything they can to self sabotage themselves for this election
i guess she passed the sniff test? idk biden already forgot who he picked anyways
I love how some Dems are bitter about Biden-Harris like, "politics sucks. We have no choice really." That's what primaries are for and you had more than a dozen choices and guess what? They didn't get the majority.
Biden announces #VPPick the same day that hundreds of Sanders Delegates to #DNC2020 vote NO on the Democratic Party Platform because it omits #MedicareForAll. This is an attempt to dominate the news cycle and drown out our dissent, which is valid and sorely needed #DrawTheLine
üö® BREAKING üö®  named California Sen.  as his running mate on Tuesday, making history by selecting the first Black woman to compete on a major party‚Äôs presidential ticket.
In Historic Pick, Joe Biden Taps Kamala Harris To Be His Running Mate
Biden picks Harris, SHE AINT BLACK!
I wouldn‚Äôt care if the democrats put out Biden &amp; Foxxy Brown, I‚Äôm not voting for him.üá∫üá∏üíØüëéüèæ #BidenHarris2020
the way i told my coworker yesterday that i thought biden would pick kamala LMFAOOOOO we are in hell
So what crazy thing will the orange moron do to try to get Biden &amp; Harris off the top of the news cycle?
Joe Biden selects Kamala Harris as vice presdiential running mate
Kamala Harris huh Biden?   I see right through that pick... smh
Dude fuck no, not Biden and Harris
Kamala Harris is Biden‚Äôs vp lol
Well, at least  can stop worrying about being replaced by
BREAKING NEWS: Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate.
This is 2020, not 1920.
Biden announces running mate.
If Joe Biden picks anyone other than a POC for his VP. We will still vote for him to get 45 out. Be we will also know where we stand. Good enough to date but not good enough to marry and take home to mama..#Veepstakes
Biden can ride a bike with a mask on. Trump can't hold up a glass of water with one hand.
thanks George.  trump and supporters are on the premise that Biden is not there mentally.  Biden can ride a bike  and talk to reporters, trump has trouble walking down a ramp.  believe only half of what you see and nothing you hear.
Biden is a tainted candidate from a tainted party.
If you have four very qualified people who each have different skills they bring to the table. You choose the person with complimentary skills. So biden choosing a black woman would help get much needed representation for people who biden just doesn‚Äôt cover alone.
Especially if they expect Biden to remember all those names.
Biden will take a page from the NYT and pick two VPs, uuuhhhhh, the gay one and one of the women I guess
my Biden family members are already freaking out because "Biden is getting roasted for moving left!" which I guess refers to conservatives calling him a socialist, it's begun
You've forgotten Beto. Beto raised the most money his first day of the 2020 campaign, $6.1 million, only beaten by Biden's $6.3 million. Beto out raised Bernie. He also has turned Texas into a battle group state. Beto is a major talent for Biden.
No matter how unfit Biden may or may not be, he‚Äôll ALWAYS be more fit than Trump.  üòÜüòÜ
Mayor Pete is trending. No, he won't be VP, but consider how well he'd campaign for president after Biden.  This VP better be electable.
I think the most important characteristic of Biden's VP - for the future of the country - is how well they'll perform in their own presidential election against whatever carnival barker the GOP puts up,  2024 or '28. Democrats will need more than one shift to fix all this.
I'd vote for Biden if he picked Peewee Herman
You believe videos now ?  See....Biden billion dollars bribe.  Or  Creepy joe biden swearing in ceremony video
I would never agree with Biden
I‚Äôm excited to see who he picks but I‚Äôll vote Biden no matter who it is ‚ù§Ô∏è
Joe Biden for prison 2020!!!!
Did Biden say that he's pick a black woman?
Bill Barr is merely projecting. Sure... Biden, Nancy, and Chuck want to tear down the very system that props them up. Pretending Democratic leadership is left wing and not just center-right corporatists is laughable.
Sadly, it seems like this was just an ego trip for them. Being better.  Being correct. Being right. Being chosen. Being the hero. Being the saint. I honestly didn‚Äôt feel that from HRC. Nor Biden. Nor Obama. And not from Harris actually.
Seeing people line-up ‚Äútheir‚Äù VP choice as if that‚Äôs now the line they‚Äôre going to draw over supporting Biden or not... gtfo. Literally all of the people being talked about are 3 billion percent better than the best of the other side. We don‚Äôt need perfection, we need capability.
As long as Biden doesn‚Äôt pick Belloq, Gmork, Starscream, Lady Deathstrike, Annie Wilkes, Killmonger, a Murder Hornet on top of a jagged can lid, Cinnamon Toothpaste, or either guy from The Lighthouse as his running mate, we‚Äôre going to need you to STFU when it‚Äôs time.
I know Joe Biden's VP choice!
No shit fck Biden
YES! CANNOT WAIT! HOPEFULLY IT IS A STRONG WILLED AFRICAN AMERICAN FEMALE LEADER!! WE GOT THIS! TIME TO BRING HOME THE #BIDEN #BACON #VictoryIsOurs
Trumps not sinking. Biden‚Äôs mind is sinking. You must be sinking to support the guy. Sad. Both of ya.
and you didn‚Äôt even blow this up ... Biden is awful
It never makes sense. I've had Democrats telling me Schumer actually doesn't want to reopen schools (then why do schools need tons of reopening funding but UI payments are negotiable?) or that Biden will prosecute Trump (then why is he calling it "bad for democracy"?)
ALL 7 USPS Unions have backed Biden!  Give us a break with your bullshit!   WE WANT IN PERSON VOTING WE WANT VOTER I.D.
If you watch Trump's angry alzheimer's grandpa routine at every press conference and think "yeah, he's killing it", you've got way worse mental problems than Joe Biden. And he's definitely got a few.
This man is a danger to the United States!!! Shit to the world!! His obvious plan to sway the black vote away from Biden so that Trump wins is DANGEROUS!!! If people dont take this shit serious and stop this madness, there is no hope! Dont fall for the foolery
Joe Biden could not run a hot dog stand
Soy demands Biden.
Is all well with Biden and that bussing issue you had previously?  You're a kowtowing boot lick!
Unless you have future knowledge of what is going to happen then you can prepare for potential outcomes which your current potus seems to be out of the loop of but I cannot believe but trump will get back in.. LMFAO Biden really the best opposition!!!!!!!!!
Is that why NY is BEGGING them to come back??üòÇüòÇ Every day you make a bigger ass out of yourself, stole that bit from Biden apparently üôÑ
If your for Biden . You definitely like to touch dicks .
Nobody BELIEVE YOU.  You helping BIDEN
How would you classify Biden?   For the record, I don't labels.  I am a small government  / less war / less spending voter.  Democrats are never any of those things.
Remember, Biden's VP will be hand-picked by the DNC because Biden has always just been a place-holder to stop Sanders.  The DNC is fully aware of his cognitive decline, which is why we will likely see NO debates, and no speech at the Convention by the Mumbling-Republican, Biden.
Biden for Prison 2020
I heard #KamalaHarris is #biden VP ü§î
Biden sucks.  It doesn't take too much imagination to denigrate a Centrist, Corporatist whose platform reads like a Republican.  The fact that the DNC is using our hate for Trump to give us NOTHING that would hurt their Corporate Donor income should tell you their priorities.
Nope, don‚Äôt Biden or Trump.
Yep.  Keep lying to your viewers about how far ahead Biden is and watch him lose just like Hillary did.  Biden's entire platform is "I'm not Trump".  I find it hard to believe that will excite enough voters for a Biden win.  Either way, we get a Republican.
Sounds like you should have been "Hiden from Biden"
I'd vote for Biden if it means we get rid of her so good strategy
Friend rolled his motorcycle into a bar parking lot. Got his beer &amp; a stranger said "So you're a Biden supporter?"  Friend was confused. "What?"  Stranger pointed out my friend's blue bandana. He must support Biden.  This is the level of fucking moron we're dealing with, kids.
Okay Hiden Biden, Who tweets for you?
Yea well Biden said Obama and me the other day so yea they‚Äôre really letting their light shine bright
The media is working for BIDEN.  Isn't that illegal or something ?
I absolutely despise Biden, but I can‚Äôt wait for the excuses to come flying from conservatives about this one
So it would appear, we have zero Republican representation in this area, Biden says we have group think here.
they're in the middle of rehabilitating GWB and Biden is already saying that prosecuting Trump (who is, according to the Democratic Party right now, a fascist, corrupt, treasonous, totalitarian existential threat to democracy) would be "bad for democracy"  what do people expect?
Biden campaign claims lagging auto jobs puts Trump at disadvantage in Michigan
Biden first entered my awareness as Obama's VP pick at the height of my own atheist phase so this all checks out
Did Trump in fact claim that Biden insulted the Black community?  It seems like an accurate headline.
But.....you all laughed when Trump said he would beat OBAMA.  Yup  He running against BIDEN , you said.  You LIED
Hunter Biden is acting like a normal Presidential nominee‚Äôs son. Dignified and quiet. Just as things should be... fucking normal!Not surprising at all. Did you ever see the video of that child getting ran over. People walking by. Nobody even stops. Our future if Biden wins.
That's because Biden cannot answer any questions at all because he has no idea what's going on while he hides in his basement.
I definitely think you are talking about yourself Joe biden a complete failure in politics spent 40 years doing nothing
Sad seeing a lot of Warren people shitting all over Biden and Harris. It's not helpful. We have one shot at getting rid of Trump. Why be another arm of the GOP? It's like 2016 all over again, only with Warren peeps. I'm sure she wouldn't approve. Unfollowing. Unfollow me. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
My Mom is I'll, pneumonia and diabetes, so we covered 5 States in 2 days. We saw the same number of coughing, ill people, without a sense of smell, as we saw Biden campaign signs...
Joe Biden is not yet the POTUS.
Why is there a need for this  piece? Because #birthers like #Trump fabricate fiction to debunk; that‚Äôs why. So sad because the reality is #KamalaHarris was a #Democratic presidential candidate before becoming #Biden‚Äôs #VP choice. Ugh, just ugh!
Who Can Not Stomach The Biden/Harris Media Darlings trying to.Shove These Loosers down our Face.  I'm so Sick of Politics  Are Their That Many Stupid people In This Country That Think They Wouldnt Just Be Worse Than Status Quo Special Intrest Globalist Care About any one of Us?
Growing up my parents pushed honesty, I grew up living an honest life. So sad that HRC, Bill Clinton, Obama, Biden, Harris, etc didn‚Äôt have the same upbringing. Honestly it seems like Trump was one of the few that was raised right ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
So, they kinda had a Biden boat parade. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
It‚Äôs time to get Biden and Harris on stage for a vetting of their goals and how they will pursue them before the mail ballots take place.
I deliver for Amazon and see hundreds of Trump signs daily and have only seen 3 Biden signs total in the last 2 months here in MI ...
That's because the Biden campaign is scared shitless to let either one of them speak in an unscripted setting.
Weird, last I checked between trump and Biden only trump was named repeatedly in multiple court cases regarding the rape of minor children. And wasnt it odd how trumps hand-picked labor secretary was part of the Epstein plea deal?
The benchmark we have to reach is a Biden presidency.
Where‚Äôs Biden?
Bully biden and pressure the party, bernie or busters are so cringe lmao
‚ÄòI badly need you‚Äô: Biden makes impassioned plea to progressive conference  via  he doesn‚Äôt need is bad enough to give us Medicare for all
He's better than Joe Biden.
I‚Äôve seen one Biden flag this entire election cycle. That‚Äôs it
Unfortunately I‚Äôve been seeing many Biden signs and BLM signs in the neighborhood...
Trump will make mincemeat out of Biden.
Oh you know... the admitted socialism policies Biden and Harris are calling for...
Want to join me for this Joe Biden for President event?
Back in 2010 President Obama and VP Joe Biden were going to fire 50,000 cattle guards,but Joe said he wants to oversee them being retrained for better jobs. I sure hope he has changed his tune. Hahahaha
If you think Biden/Harris is going to do anything to improve the country, you‚Äôre already blind.
(Snort!)  FFS, do you have some fantasy Biden will?
I have the same problem. Maybe put, that we‚Äôre Democrats, who supports Biden in our profile? Kidding, not kidding.
Why do you open yourself up for all this? One thing Biden could never do is kill 167,000 Americans and dissolve the USPS during a pandemic. You seem to be great at that, though.
The Democrats wanted to get somebody as conservative as they could to draw away those Republican voters that really don‚Äôt want Trump in the office.Biden seemed to be the safest. Because he is very moderate. But it will backfire.
None of that is going to make a big enough change unless we have a living wage to go back to and Medicare for all. Sadly the refusal to back that I believe will be the end of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. No Medicare for all. No vote for Joe.
How did you feel when they supported Obama &amp; Biden in both '08 &amp; '12?
I hear a lot of people insisting how bad America will look if Joe Biden is elected, while neglecting the current reality... Proud Boys in #Kalamazoo, for instance...
Biden is a moderate republican lol
Just annoys everyone but extreme leftists who will vote Biden anyway.
This is hilarious so they just want to impeach Trump because they don't like him. The Democrats have wasted American money on the Russia Investigation that they cooked up, and Biden admitting to not give aide to Ukraine unless they fire the prosecutor.
Why #Trump‚Äôs kids open their mouths is beyond me. Their dad does a very effective job of making a fool of himself without their nonsensical views added.  Eric Trump calls on Biden to answer for 'very discriminatory' process of picking running mate  #FoxNews
You wanna put some skin on that? Its proven that Biden was blackmailing Ukraine for quid pro quo for Hunter. The democrats have done nothing but praise and defend China, and have ignored the official reports saying China is in the top 3 to meddle with our election.
Trump Ads Attack Biden Through Deceptive Editing and Hyperbole
She repulses blacks and women.  It was a wonderful choice by Biden- for Trump!  LOL
Just crossed 5 States, dozens of Trump banners, not 1 Biden.  Not 1.
Democrats are the party of the kkk. It never changed. They just got better at lying. When joe Biden says well, all the racist shit joe says, that‚Äôs because that‚Äôs how joe really thinks. They aren‚Äôt gaffes! He just forgot to lie.
They endorsed Barack Obama &amp; Joe Biden in 2008 &amp; 2012.
This is the worst advice you could possibly offer Biden. A smart Biden campaign says the bare minimum between now and November. This election will be a reaction to Trump lighting himself on fire daily. Why do anything that would distract from the fire?
Biden coming with some HEAT
Here is a photo of a rock in my yard I‚Äôd rather vote for than either Trump or Biden. I named him Dwayne. Dwayne ‚ÄúThe Rock‚Äù. He needs a last name. How about ‚ÄúJohnson‚Äù? Everyone should write-in Dwayne ‚Äú ‚Äù Johnson in November. #TheRock2020
It doesn‚Äôt make sense to compare an executive with a publicly funded press secretary, and a candidate with a campaign fund. There should be two sets of expectations there.   Besides, Biden tells more truth in 5 minutes than Trump has his entire life
Even before Trump came out and said what everyone already knew, there's no way you'd call Biden's speculation "baseless". Trump's pattern of behavior is itself a base of suspicion for the motives behind Trump's actions. What kind of kindergarten headline writer did this?
The weekend grocery shopping trip was made much better by spotting my first Biden for President yard sign #GoJoe2020
Hey, I'm no Michael Bennet hater! I like Bennet a lot, I just prefer Pete for this moment. I genuinely hope Bennet is given a chance to shine with a Biden cabinet position.
In the immortal words of Joe Biden.   "Come on, man"
Biden can‚Äôt even spell his own name. Democrats are criminals. If you want a Soviet government then vote Biden.
Am I the only woman who read this ‚Å¶ piece and went ‚Äúwow, he really has no idea what it‚Äôs like to be a woman in leadership in a traditionally male context‚Äù?  (Generally I‚Äôm a fan which is why this surprised me.)
You raised a man worse than that.  Hunter, your family (sister, brother,son and yourself) are corupt to their bones thanks to YOU... for what?  Love of money and power. Tell me again what in your 40 yrs in  government have you done for Americans vs. your Biden clan? Ur worthless.
Lying about Biden in Newsweek, doesn‚Äôt make it true.
Beautiful, compassionate words, and an excellent solution to the problem we face. But tbh, as I read it I could not imagine any of it in Trump‚Äôs voice. I kept slipping into Biden‚Äôs voice in my head. I think he‚Äôs already ‚Äúmy President‚Äù.
Maybe you should have targeted Joe Biden and the rest of the Demonrats. Why did it take so long and you have nothing to show for it.
If you think Trump is going to do anything other than help his buddies steal as much from us that they can, you‚Äôre thinking wrong. Biden would be so much worse though.
I noticed that... Kamala Harris was Biden's handlers' pick y'know...
Vote for Biden.
Love it, keep doing it, if Biden can do that it's fair game. That is hilarious.
I'm glad you are free to support Trump so much. I stand with for the children in cages, and I proudly stand with Biden/Harris.
Would have been epic if he said Biden.

Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report  #FoxNews
Another question you can ask: Why is the sky blue? Why can't Biden complete a sentence?
Dumbass question. How come Biden &amp; Harris can't answer any questions? Let me guess, because they don't have any answers. Biden is too busy cashing checks from the Ukraine and China.
Biden &amp; Harris can't answer any questions! Ask some relevant questions, like "President Trump, how did you accomplish so much in 3 years? Biden has been a politician for 45 years and has no accomplishments."  . #NeverBiden
Because they can't answer any questions and they don't have any accomplishments to discuss. Biden will be in a nursing home by November.
Obama &amp; Biden were too busy corrupting America and filling the swamp.
Just saw my 1st Joe Biden ad on the local station here in deep red WY. It sounded great, but not sure how the mandatory mask bit will go over here, so many covidiots!!
I‚Äôm voting for Biden/Harris because they can actually do the job without the lies and blatant corruption.  They are true diplomats and can mend fences with our allies.  Also, I‚Äôm tired of the division that has happened to our country.
How embarrassing for up and coming young artists to be seen with doddering old fool, Biden. How does this help their cache with fans? üòÇ
Vote for Biden and save us all, please.
Clinton and Obama are definitely wonk Ivy wasps as this article portrays. Biden is the lone Irish Gipper, the feeler, the westerner, the American.
Bernie's plan also didn't abolish private insurance. I can't believe you grouped her in with those Neolibs. I have noticed you and Abby are crickets on Bernie sheepdogging progressives into voting for someone as horrible as Biden and Kopmala! You both are better than this!
WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT, Mr. President, I thought you said Biden was the one who would "hurt God and the Bible"?!?!?!
Biden Harris says enough likes someone who sends people to jail and a women who doesn‚Äôt let them out smh dems are laughable

Would you rather have Joe Biden‚Äôs memory or Kamala Harris‚Äô laugh?
Agreed. I live in West MI and it's rampant around here.  "Libertarians" voting for Trump. It boggles my mind. I actually committed to Biden unless my friend commits to Dr. Jo, as I told him I'm just voting to negate his vote. (Petty? Maybe. But too many Ron Paul folks &lt;3 Trump)
As long as you say the same about Trump (without mentioning Biden)
Totally agree. But if I (generally conservative) were to tell a dem that I‚Äôm voting 3rd party, though, this is the typical response, ‚Äúbut that‚Äôs a vote for Trump!‚Äù which is just not true, because I‚Äôd never vote for Biden. And especially not Bernie lol. Maybe I‚Äôm an outlier, idk.
Vote for Biden. You don‚Äôt have to be in love, bro!

This Biden drinking water ad is the stupidest thing I've seen since Obama drank Flint water
You lost me at Biden being a better president than trump. I do however get what your saying, I would just reverse the analogy.
The atmosphere for protest and agitation will likely lessen under Biden *for a while*. But the evictions, recession and other crises will generate protests again, and Biden will not stop the crushing of those mvmts.
Anything dems offer that sounds good is and always will be either abandoned or will cement in the advanced made by the right.   Case in point. Biden will maintain trump ICE policies.
She's notorious for oppression of Black Americans as a DA. Called Joe Biden a racist. Damn bear EVERYTHING she says is race based... so who's the racist?
The anti war protests were amongst the largest ever, and the overt lies that made the case for iraq were unraveling well before boots were on the ground. All it would have required for Biden to do the right thing was listen. But he didn't because hes a lifelong warmonger.
Once again, there is no reason for anyone on the left to feel as if they must vote for Biden. He will not reverse any Trump policies when in power.
Great to be in-studio yesterday at  in Casper to talk about the important issues facing Wyoming, as well as why Kamala Harris's radical policies would hurt our state and the nation.
if trump wins stocks goes up, biden wins stocks go down. i‚Äôll refer to this on election day
Biden‚Äôs a racist, he picked a running mate on color and gender. No bigger racist than that!

Joe Biden is a "law and order" democrat
You know if Biden gets in this will all be swept under the rug. It‚Äôs been going on forever. To hell with the election get the results out! We deserve to know ASAP.
No the most extreme Ticket was unqualified Trump! And the  has done everything to cover for his 21,000+ lies, the disaster of 166,000+ DEAD American's! Biden/Harris has come forward with plans to fight the Virus, not worry about shower heads! You're a disgrace just like Trump
Wait, wait, I can do that too: I have Dem friends in the bluest of blue states and not one of them is voting for Biden.  See how easy it is!
Joe Biden Tries to Take Credit for Trump Brokered Peace Deal as Rashida Tlaib Yells At Clouds
Nope. I‚Äôd agree Trump would get credit if the economy were churning along when Biden takes office, but it currently is and almost certainly will be in free fall at that point.
I think we need tons of people voting in person for Biden/Harris on Election Day. I may risk it and go. I am so worried he‚Äôll declare victory on Election Day if he‚Äôs ahead on in person voting. That would be harder if Joe comes out on top on election night.
Maybe the First Couple's mail-in ballots will be "lost" somewhere until they are discovered a week after the election of President Joe Biden.
Even better the Joe Biden?? üëÄüëÄ

Who would your father support?   He was a man of character and did what he thought was right.  Your dad loved joe Biden and you said you did too?   WTF are you not endorsing the man who has always been there for your family?  Trump treated your father horribly!
It‚Äôs really more of a suggestion of what Biden thinks should be done.  He won‚Äôt actually be sworn in until January, so that‚Äôs when it would start. By then, we‚Äôll likely have a vaccine.

Biden says a mandatory mask mandate will save 40K lives in the next three months. So at a (generous) 1% death rate, that means there would have to be 4 MILLION NEW CASES in the US between now and Election Day. #notgonnahappen
The world is already laughing that Biden is the best that the DEMs could come up with.
The Biden/Harris photo was perfect. Made in sketchy light. Really great.
Jill Biden and Douglas Emhoff are building a beautiful virtual friendship
Perhaps, but you have to admit Trump inherited an economy that was roaring along, while Obama inherited one that was in a death spiral. Ironically, if Biden wins, he‚Äôll inherit an economy in worse shape than the one Obama did.
So isn‚Äôt it time to enthusiastically endorse Biden/Harris? Your dad would.
You realize you said overt fascism about the current President of the United States, and are still willing to give him 4 more years? You think this place will be around in 2024 or 2028? Seriously? By then he will have nabbed Putin-like control. We can at least hold Biden to theüî•
I'm calling it for Trump.  Liberals are completely oblivious to Harris's wh*r* problem with women.  She actually reduces Biden's appeal.
That, and Biden's sign interpreter.

Don't believe a word Biden says. Pure bullcrap pulled out of thin air. Remember, Biden liked Robert KKK Bird. #NeverDemocrat
Biden. You made a bold face lie about wearing masks and saving lives. Nobody could say with any accuracy that wearing a mask will save 40,000 lives. Total bullcrap. Standing for the flag is Patriotic, not wearing a mask. When are you going to answer questions from media?

THIS is leadership. Not Joe Biden.
What would you do?  Some guy on a moped drives by my house daily and screams expletives towards my Biden yard sign. There are young children on my block.
I wonder, too. You could say the DNC strategy was a success since it beat Bernie Sanders. Seems like a costly victory, though, if you permanently lose a good part of your base, which I think the party has. Then pick a limp candidate like Biden and search for political Viagra. Wow
Hope in Joe Biden.... ok... üßê. Your TDS is over 9000!
She knows Biden‚Äôs winning. She‚Äôs trying to find the way to deal with that
Really? Joe Biden had 50 years in government, and didn‚Äôt ‚Äúfix‚Äù this. Now, all of a sudden, it‚Äôs a priority and he can fix it.  Nope, not buying it!
Those are completely made of statistics. Multiple sources and polls say that only about 10% of Sanders supporters won't be voting for Biden and for Yang idk. But either way, you're lying out of your ass and making yourself look like a fool

Should there be a national mask mandate?  Presumptive  Democratic nominee, Joe Biden, wants one.. what do you think?   will talk about it with you tomorrow morning on West Michigan LIVE.
I think we can gauge by her primary performance.  That's her first national campaign.  She came in dead last- behind the likes of Bloomberg, Gutbieg, Pocahontas, even Biden himself.  Zero power.
When I watch Mr.Biden and listen to his,as people say,rambling on,and lack of putting words together too form intelligent speech.  I feel sorrow for him,and at Sametime shame for his staff,and family for keeping him in the limelight. Let the poor man retire. He really needs help
Election gambling odds. You bet $100 to win $43 with Biden ($143 payout) or You bet $100 to win $125 with trump ($225 payout) . You could bet $100 on Kanye and if he wins you win $50,000 ($50,100 payout). Something to watch. Trump was +1150 at a point in 2016.

Plus California has the highest income inequality. And highest taxes and cost of living so how is she and Biden gonna make it better? Look at the history of those two before you decide
To bad you don‚Äôt know the truth. Our President built the economy from the bad one Obama and Biden couldn‚Äôt bring back in 8 years . Matter of fact trump made the best economy our country has ever seen before, because our President killed all the bills that stopped
Yes. They are probably staunch supporters of Biden and the like.
I don't feel about Joe Biden.
Biden calls for nationwide mask mandate
Name calling shows me a lot. Smh. Do better. Biden is horrible and trump would be the lesser of the 2 evils
I think it's not true. It seems like they called for governors to require mask wear:  but I can read the comments either way.
hey Donald, do you what will happen if you lose the election? Biden will sign the hero‚Äôs act and you‚Äôll look like an uncaring ass. Your screwed up team of    are sabotaging your election chances. Are you that Blind?
Fully agree. I haven‚Äôt seen a single person who I‚Äôd consider as ‚Äúfar-left‚Äù excited about Biden or Harris.
Biden &amp; Harris can stuff their masks where the sun don't shine!
Hes also probably closer to Biden‚Äôs views than AOC
Hey  I don‚Äôt appreciate being used as your strawman. This holier-than-thou approach is why incremental change is so hard for the left.  Also, if you think Biden/Harris would truly be as bad as the current assholes, you are out of your collective goddamn gourds.
So, here we have  announcing an historic peace agreement in the Middle East.  And the best Biden can do is demand masks on everyone for the next three months - even if you‚Äôre not within 10 miles of another human being. What a sad &amp; scary excuse for a leader.
Fascism is already here. You already live in a police state. We already have concentration camps. Biden/Kamala will not save you from this, they ARE this.
every time i hear biden and harris being described as ‚Äúfar left‚Äù my already dead soul dies even further just that much more
Your actions were banana republic, you bent banana dick! Rudy Giuliani Warns Joe Biden Admin Will Prosecute Trump

Are you a young person who's ready to #MichiWIN for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris? Join our fellowship program:
ohhhh what i would do to see a trump vs biden debate üíÄüòÇ
it's where Biden sits
We can vote AND tear it all down, it's definitely an option.  Just the harm reduction of voting Trump out of office makes it worth doing IMO even if Biden and Kamalla are horrible.  Just don't forget to fight them as well, we can't have the left go to sleep like during Obama
I believe the Biden Harris ticket will do much more for the progressive movement moving forward than trump will. There is more hope with them in office than what we have right now!
The problem with 3rd party voting by progressive democrats, its a vote taken away from removing trump from office for no other reason but to hope and protest. Why not give the Biden Harris ticket a shot to show they will listen to progressive ideals and put some in place to start
Why are you endorsing Biden/Harris? Thanks though.
Wait....Democrats want everyone to be vegan?   Hmmm.  I‚Äôll still vote for Biden.
Kamala Harris believed Joe Biden's accusers ‚Äî until she didn't  #KamalaHarris
If you thing feeble Joe Biden is going to be good for America after 47 years in government, you might no be too intelligent.    #BidenIsARacist
Not to mention tRump is projecting onto Biden what Americans already do to him.
And what other 'camps' will happen in the future if Biden wins? #scarythoughts
Just one of the many reasons to vote Biden/Harris üòá
I am so over people complaining about Biden being the nominee. I‚Äôm sorry, I don‚Äôt love him either, but some of y‚Äôall need to learn to accept it before Trump gets re-elected.
Biden and Kamala have locked up more black people than anyone in history..a speech doesnt undo that.. theyre both garbage!!! üíØ
Will you be voting Biden/Harris? Asking for a country.
Trump breaks everything he touches. Hopefully a Biden administration will be able to restore the department‚Äôs image as mentioned in the article. Congress should also look at legislation to prevent the DHS from being used inappropriately in the future.
Or, as someone put it a couple days ago, she could be a sack of potatoes with a smiling face and I'd still vote for Biden.
It's true that African Americans didn't show up in quite as large of numbers, though in 2008 they voted with 60% and 2016 it was 59%.  As a Michigander, I knew Trump would win. But he's lost a lot of support here. And every third party voter I know from 2016 = Biden.
Trump campaign uses the totally false claim that dead people vote.  Trump campaign uses a dead persons Twitter account to attack Biden and Kamala.  Vote decency and truth, Vote #BidenHarris2020   #ONEV1
Absolutely none. She is more fake than Biden and the people need to see that.
Other than being the most pro-abortion ticket in history, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are puppets for the pro-China, open borders, Wall Street Chamber of Commerce crowd. They'll continue policies that ship jobs oversees while shilling for Big Tech
OMG you still have millions out of work and hours are being cut a monthly 2000 STIMULUS per person is what biden said hes going to do if he is the president its about the people not Trump's agenda TRUMP DOES NOT CARE about the people only HIMSELF üò•
One Biden/Harris rally &lt; One Trump Boat Rally
This is the future of the Biden/Harris Administration. This stuff will go on and on and on without end. Think before you vote.
Aww was Harris mean to your buddy that was bought &amp; paid for by you? We are still trying to figure out how he paid off all his bills with cash. I hope the Biden/Harris admin look into that. I'll take an angry/mad Black women over a LYING POS like you!
I am not dismissing a priori the case for Trump &gt; Biden.  That doesn‚Äôt when we (Catholics) should adopt the rhetorical style, obnoxiousness, bellicosity, and internal incoherency which comprise the four pillars of his administration and shout, ‚ÄúINTEGRALISM!‚Äù
Suburban woman here!   I‚Äôm excited to vote for Biden Harris in November.  Can‚Äôt wait to get the currupt incompetent traitor out of the White House and stop being embarrassed daily by #TraitorTrump looking forward to an actual response to covid.   #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica

Republicans trying to figure out how to bash joe biden's vp pick after joe biden has practically chosen a republican üòë ü§î
Just suddenly remembered last night that one of my best friends had a cat named Joe Biden.
Biden picked VP who slept w/married man, 30 yrs older than her, to get appointed to government commissions paying over $400,000. Isn't that theft? Corruption? Conflict of interest?
Biden picked VP who slept w/married man, 30 yrs older than her, 2 get appointed to government commissions paying over $400,000. Isn't that theft? Corruption? Conflict of interest?
I use tweetdeck so much I don't know how to navigate the native twitter site.  Detroit Free Press did a thing on Whitmer's hesitation. She's young and probably wants to build a stronger party base as governor.   Unless Cain had a scoop on Biden, he wouldn't have known
THIS WOULD BE AMAZING IF IT HAD A MONTHLY 2000 DOLLAR STIMULUS IN IT BECAUSE ITS NOT JUST HEALTHY PEOPLE GETTING TJIS AND DYING FROM IT ITS EVERYWHERE SO WEATHER IF UR HOMELESS OR WHO EVER YOU ARE A MONTHLY 2000 STIMULUS WOULD REALLY HELP.
I am still incredulous that Kamala Harris likened coronavirus to Ebola to demonstrate Biden‚Äôs ability to lead by stopping an Ebola pandemic. üòÇü§£Ebola was an outbreak. 4,000 miles from the U.S. We got 2 cases. It‚Äôs going to be a long 3 months.
In ‚Äòmust-win‚Äô Michigan, Trump campaign takes fight door to door as polls show Biden with strong lead
You mean the Biden üí©???  Nope, we don‚Äôt.
Joe Biden mangaled it too!!! And she's his running mate!
You're incapable of having an honest conversation.  I literally advocate for doing all of that RIGHT NOW alongside voting.  I reject that I'll be "at the mercy of Biden" any more than we're at the mercy of someone worse right now.
You never Trumpers don‚Äôt want to watch Biden make a fool of himself.  I used to respect you.
Because I care about harm reduction?  Because I'm more under threat by Trump than Biden, even if only a little?
There is only one reason we now have a Biden-Harris ticket....even the Democrats want Trump to WIN!  #MAGA  #Trump2020  #GodBlessTheUSA
Just as I would under Biden because he is also bad
He has scared this white person, right to the point of voting for Joe Biden.
Then why are you spending so much time attacking me, someone whose MAIN FUCKING GOAL is to bully Biden into adopting better policy?
My entire argument is to bully Biden, you're the one saying to keep Trump in office
YES I KNOW, IM NOT TELLING ANYONE TO STOP FIGHTING BACK IM LITERALLY JUST SAYING VOTE FOR BIDEN AND THEN FIGHT BIDEN WHILE HE'S IN OFFICE BECAUSE TRUMP IS WORSE
YES, AND THAT IS LESS BAD AND MAKES IT EASIER TO FIGHT BACK. Do you realize you're literally arguing to keep Trump in office because Biden won't be good enough?  The only choices are Trump or Biden right now, I hate Biden but you're fucking stupid if you think he's just as bad.
I never defended any of these people.  But if you don't think that things will at least be a LITTLE less awful when Biden is in office and we can bully the fuck out of him, agitate, and protest, then you're just lost buddy.  I hate Biden and I haven't ever defended these people
Yes, that's why I fight fascism... but that doesn't mean you shouldn't also engage in harm reduction through electoral means when Trump literally is using secret police, brutalizing protesters, and threatening us to a much greater degree than Biden is.
No, of course Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt own
Joe Biden And Kamala Harris Host First Joint Campaign Event
You sick old man. I am WOMEN, HERE ME ROAR, Talk about something really important like how many people have died under your lack of leadership!! Do you think God is happy with you, or any of us for that matter. Talking about Biden and how God feels about him.
Good luck getting anywhere with the Biden Harris ticket.
Maybe somebody needs to let Biden know that. Today during his announcement with Kamala present, he referred to her as Kamela. You know like Pamela only with a K.
Please don‚Äôt write any more headlines containing the phrase ‚ÄúBiden tapping a woman‚Äù
That‚Äôs my point. Biden should be asked those questions too. They all should.
Amen
So you‚Äôre telling me Joe Biden is the old dude from O Brother, Where Art Thou?
Give up.  VP Biden and Sen Harris are going to show you the door.
Give up.  VP Biden and Sen Harris are going to wipe the floor with you.
Give up.  VP Biden and Sen Harris are going to kick your ass.
Speculation or assumption. I bet its the "dirt" on Biden and his son Hunter. Remember back when Rudy went to the Ukrain looking for evidence on Hunter and Joe Biden? Yeah bet they pull that joker card out of thin air. They'll say Biden is a criminal or some shit like that. Watch.
Very good article.  While reading it, I thought about how Abp Gregory would handle a president Biden presenting himself for communion and then exiting the church to immediately promote abortion on demand to the assembled press gaggle while holding his bible.
Wyoming Here   /  all the way in this family! On a side note my son turns 18 this year &amp; is also Biden/Harris all the way!
That's what I say to.
Glad you'll base your vote on policy. I'm appalled that Biden's VP pick was limited on criteria - race and gender. He shut out so many other accomplished candidates just because of their biological traits. I do believe that's the true definition of racist and sexist.
Trust me took time. Trial and oh several errors. but the wait was well worth it. Don't know if the age difference makes the differents... shhh don't tall anyone, I'm 52 he is 38. So there is that. üòä
She's the choice of the Vatican.  Biden, Pelosi, Hillary and Obama are some of the other pseudo-religious secret followers of the Vatican. They have been promised, by the Pope, that they are chosen to rule the world. That's why Hillary was so p*ssed when she lost.
has biden figured out how to login to twitter yet
Liberal leaning Mom asked what I thought about Biden's pick; my response  - I don't agree with picking candidates based on race or gender.
Have to say I found my guy on a video game I came to WY to meet him in person after phone dating for 6 months. I even came to WY in Jan. "Born in Chicago" so I know snow. ü§£ We have been together since 2008, have a 11 year old son together with my other 2 older kids. &amp; Very Happy
Obviously he is scared that Biden won‚Äôt show.
Yeah signs for 45 up all over the place. Here and in Montana. I don't understand any of them. I don't feel safe putting a Biden sign up because they are die hard here and they might burn down my house. Not kidding either. So me &amp; my family &amp; close friends just say hidden. ü§£
Yeah I don't think you can get much redder then Wyoming. That's the only thing that sucks about WY. I just don't understand how they can back someone that has done so much damage to farmers. I just don't get it here. But luckily I still have my family to talk to none are for 45!
I want over 1/2 of Biden‚Äôs cabinet to be women AND his choices need to be vetted and doled out dribble dribble dribble
C‚Äômon man (Joe Biden voice)! You can‚Äôt just say crap like that and bounce!!
"Less people suffer under Biden than Trump"  I don't think that's true. Biden hasn't meaningfully committed to dismantling anything trump has put into place and given how democrats govern it's certain that he won't reverse most or any programs trump has enacted.
"on core legislation and aren't betraying"  what issues do biden/harris agree with the left on?  ICE? M4A? Corruption? Taxes? Police Violence?
I hear what you‚Äôre saying and I thought surely they were going to replace Biden too! But I think they would have done it before he picked his VP. I think he‚Äôs it.
Joe Biden looks amazing in his well fitted suits.
Biden is doomed
You are about to witness the genius of Trump.
Me too, but I think Kamala will inject some more newsworthy and positive press. I‚Äôm in Michigan and the 300 lbs orange fatass is 12% behind Biden right now. He will not win Michigan again. If he does win The GOP will not win the Senate. We can Impeach that MF‚Äôr for good this time
Weird Al Yankovick would be more help than Biden in making a tough decision.
No I‚Äôm not much of a FB guy. I got on here mostly to f*ck with Trump any way possible! I screwed up by voting for him in 2016. I‚Äôm trying to atone for it, so I got on here and will see if can do more for Biden/Harris campaign. Thank you for a laugh! It is healthy, keeps you young
We have several, because we are hunters here. Not just BS hunters, I mean we have gotten our hunting license, have our kill processed so we get the meat out of it. Lovely roasts, steaks, hamburger "Not hamburders ü§£" &amp; sausage made from it. Nothing goes to waste. The right way!
didn‚Äôt biden tell Obama not to kill bin laden?
Good for Biden/Harris. It's way better then a racist traitor sitting in the WH! You know the guy that has allowed 160,000+ American's to die because he did nothing for 70 days when it started, "oh that's right he called it the Dem's HOAX" Remember 15 closer to 0.. He was LYING!
VP Biden, they‚Äôre removing mail counting machines. They‚Äôre completely dismantling the postal service. There needs to be a nationwide plan by the DNC. Ballot drop boxes everywhere? Something must be done. Mail in isn‚Äôt going to work. This is getting really scary.
They dont care about those ones i guess the ones biden supposedly touching
As i said will be damn hard to do worse than trump. So im willing to bet biden will be far better
I started clapping to fill in the awkward, uncomfortable silence that followed after Biden introduced Harris, as she was approaching the podium.
We still have a war to win. Healing can‚Äôt begin til Biden inauguration.

Criticize Joe Biden as much as you want.  But the ability of this man to show this kind of empathy at a moments notice is amazing.  #BidenHarris
Suburban mother absolutely voting Biden/Harris.
I‚Äôm still in shock the lefties aren‚Äôt gonna replace Biden! Anybody thought about that? He‚Äôs really it! They‚Äôre really gonna go with him! ü§£
I'm not saying but trump anything. Biden will be better than trump for progressive agendas period. Can't change my mind
Saying joe will be just as bad is speculation at best. Having an actual person in office that listens is far better than a man who listens to no one on anything because hes the smartest person in every room. Not changing my mind. We will be better off with biden. Period
I was not even considering Biden. But after the announcement today, Harris is the VP, I will consider.
I haven't made an excuse stated a fact on what the video is. Its ignorant that all people want to do is point out his past while largely ignoring trumps past and present to this very day. You want to vote 3rd party that has 0 shot at winning this time around to spite biden
Not to mention the countless other groups who are significantly more at risk under Trump than we would be under Biden.  It's not to say he isn't awful or that you shouldn't criticize him, you should and he is, it's that we have to not allow a literal fascist to win
Yeah, but we don't have to support him.  There's a difference.  I hate Biden and as soon as he beats Trump, the kid gloves come off and I'll be every bit as vicious against him as I am against Trump.  I just can't not vote when Trump's re-election is a threat to my very existence
I haven't actually.  I've been having a really hard time getting myself around to voting Biden and I will absolutely argue that it's the least bad option but nowhere have I told anyone not to criticize Biden.
Yeah, &amp; got paid well for it too. Burisma, &amp; China are the most relevant foreign policy experiences of the Biden clan. If only the kickbacks can be applied to lessen the economic impact of the Democrat wish list. Living on the dole is no way to go through life.
It‚Äôs mind-blowing to me that people who lived through 2016 still say things like ‚Äúthe next President‚Äù &amp; ‚Äúthe next Vice President‚Äù re: Biden/Harris ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Like, I did this too. It feels incredibly dumb to look back on now. Yes, polls look good. But polls aren‚Äôt votes. So just...stop.
Trump tries to paint Kamala Harris as both too liberal and too moderate
Yes. The moron line was negative, but I'm sure people know what I mean. It's either Trump or Biden. Anything else is a waste of time and energy. From the top on down and back up, a Blue ticket will get us out of GOP hell.
I don't want to vote for Biden, but voting for him and getting him elected puts Trump out of office who is actively a fascist and doing unspeakable things that probably would at least be easier to combat under Biden
Still seeing so much butt hurt. Warren was my choice too for president. But guess what? It didn't happen. I got onboard with Biden immediately. Because I'm not a moron. Negative energy will never create the change you want. Numbers matter. We have to get a super majority. Period.
Biden Welcomes Kamala, Who Absolutely Hammers Trump  Who writes this crap "Absolutely Hammers Trump" what an f-ing moron.
Can't I settle for Biden and say people should vote Biden but also shit on him and his VP pick because they're actually awful?  I 100% agree that it's a war against the fash but let's not kid ourselves about what we are being forced to vote for.
Biden &amp; Harris vs Trump &amp; Pence. I'll  sleep easy tonight. Trump 2020!
Most of them know her general nature is that of a slaver and a ruthless overlord . She already has plans to get rid of Biden and if they win he won't last 10 months if that.

Both are already left. Ows and dapl i do not get what your point is when concerning biden on either one. And biden supported the patriot act to a certain extent. Not fully. Trump and biden are not the same and that's extremely dangerous to spread that rhetoric
Yep.  Put  into the browser and landed here.  Don‚Äôt miss the ActBlue statement at the bottom.  Guess Antifa is endorsing Biden.
‚ÄúFatilities‚Äù ‚ÄúDoxxers‚Äù...yet, he nicknamed Biden, Sleepy Joe! Donald himself, just today, cannot properly pronounce common everyday words like ‚ÄúDoctor‚Äù or ‚ÄúFatalities‚Äù but has 2 grown sons trying their best to convince us Americans that it‚Äôs Joe who cannot read. It‚Äôs an SNL skit!
Exactly. And the Biden/Harris ticket IS a higher standard than Trump/Pence. But, apparently all of you highly intellectual people who know more than the rest of us get to piss moan and cry about how things don‚Äôt match your higher standards. It gets old. Again, grow up.
Absolutely, was the only reason I hoped that VP Biden wouldn't pick her for his VP.
What a "tell" you're making here. Admitting Biden isn't capable of debating President Trump.  Oh and just fyi... Tulsi cleaned Kamala's clock on the debate stage. Pence will also defeat her in the VP debate.
Easiest job in the World? Crowd control at a Biden/Harris rally.

Old people love to be like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not happy about biden but we have to fight like hell to get trump out!‚Äù But to them ‚Äúfighting like hell‚Äù means yelling at young people to vote and then not doing anything else. Maybe you guys should try campaigning harder :-)))
Biden had 50 years to make a difference and now he talks like he can change the world What a  Piece of shit dont buy it
Biden is doing a decent job of reading his speech.

Goes toward my observation that the Vatican is a Marxist front and people like Biden and Obama, and now Harris, are agents of that pseudo-religion whose main mission is raping young boys.
Honestly, when I read the inflamed tweets of people saying they'll never vote for Biden/Harris, I cannot tell if they are honest or if they are dense Trump supporters attempting to ratf*ck us into depressing the vote.
A great endorsement for Biden/Harris.
Dr. Biden, I am so hopeful to see your work as First Lady.
If you honestly think people believe your bullshit, you‚Äôre nuts. Biden...a devote Catholic attends church. Maybe the pandemic has temporarily closed some but once dumb Trump is out of office hopefully we can get the virus under control and we can get back to normal.

In a fist fight I would probably take Biden.  He seems like he's good at taking hits to the head.     In a debate I have to take Trump because Biden often seems to forget where he's at.  In an election. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Y‚Äôall know people can want to get Trump out of there more than they dislike Biden and Kamala right? Us expressing how we feel doesn‚Äôt mean we aren‚Äôt voting.
If you're not voting for Biden/Harris...you are a tRump supporter! Not voting, voting 3 party, voting for 45...all means you are a tRump supporter! How is 45 working out for you? If good, then YOU are the problem!
Buddy I litteraly said fuck Biden look at my header
Trump will beat Biden. It's no surprise Biden picked an Indian descendant of slave holders.  We need to start a rebuilding process.  Get Kanye involved in 2020, then, in 2024, he may be in a position to win.  Let's give the guy a chance!
I'm embarrassed to see Biden signs in my neighborhood. How do people get that clueless?

It‚Äôs actually a simulation. They ran the election simulation 40,000 times and Trump won 29/100 on average and Biden won 71/100.

Probably, but it's the biden guy whose on here posting about how he would vote for hitler over trump.
Now they have given 45 the chance and he failed. They like Biden.
His whole job is to siphon young white male votes away from Biden. Everyone with a functioning frontal lobe would know that.
Oh, but just watch the instantaneous flip if Biden wins.
Who's he kidding! She wasn't anyone's choice, let alone Biden. Some staffer picked her name out of the hat of Black Women Demoncratic Radicals. #JoeAndTheHoe

Biden has publicly and repeatedly stated his refusal to submit to the Roman Pontiff in regard to gay marriage and abortion, as well as actively working in opposition to those Church teachings, and is therefore outside communion with the Church.  That is a demonstrable fact.
Why is it that no one wants Biden on the debate stage?

Incredulity, Heresy, Apostacy, and Schism are the options.  There is no ‚ÄúBad‚Äù on the list.  Apostacy does not apply to Biden.

Biden/Harris will absolutely kill your kids and maintain everything the current Trump administration is doing.  That's what they're being paid to do.
i don‚Äôt like biden or harris but do i want another 4 years of a fucked up, bible-wielding, uber-conservative tr*mp administration?? HELL NO!
Biden VP Pick Prompts Support, Criticism In Michigan
To be honest I just am not happy about it. I didn‚Äôt like Biden I‚Äôm the first place and now he‚Äôs picking Harris. I liked her for how she actually criticized the man but now she‚Äôs throwing that out the window and saying she‚Äôs ‚Äúhonored‚Äù to be his running mate????
There‚Äôs one simulations where Biden wins by more than 400?? Lol holy shit that‚Äôs the dumbest model ever
With Biden being listed as a criminal suspect in Russia, it would be grounds enough for him to step down and allow Kamala to take over.
Biden/Harris might as well be a republican ticket
üí•Me, too! Biden/Harris!
Well, Biden's VP nomination is the scariest one if you like your guns and your thoughts! She will take them both away, and take your money, and we are on our way to Venezuela! Watched her treat an innocent man absolutely despicable!! Scary times we are in!!
Would really help of the american public could grasp ‚Äòchance to win‚Äô vs actual polling numbers. They can‚Äôt, so this stuff from Nate makes people think Biden is up 42 points
Keep your models to yourself, idiot. The populace is too dumb to understand ‚Äòchance of winning‚Äô. They think that means Biden is up 71/29 in actual polls. You did this shit in 2016 and caused major issues.
If white supremacy doesn't end, America would. Did you hear me? The Civil War was God's first punishment to this nation because of slavery &amp; America is still not listening. Their fight against black lives to matter? Biden &amp; Harris has to respect us or America loses
Kamala Harris is officially Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate. Michigan supporters say it‚Äôs about time.
A - Biden is.  B - No one gives a shit about your magic beans. C - Dismantle the Church

I can‚Äôt stop thinking that Tulsi would beat Trump in a landslide but here we are with Biden and Harris and another 4 years of Trump.
Biden released 20+ years of tax returns.    Nothing to hide with Biden because he isn‚Äôt a currupt con man stealing from the American people like trump.   trump proves he has something huge to hide, corruption, fraud, and his failure as a ‚Äúbusiness man‚Äù
We‚Äôre not comfortable with a foreign nation interfering with our elections. Last time I checked Hunter wasn‚Äôt running for president. There‚Äôs no indication that China is acting at the same level as Russia in trying to get Biden elected. Only idiots think China created this virus.
The "suburban housewife" is a fascist-right fiction suggested to you so that you stop losing your shit around your staff. Women in my neighborhood (just outside of Grand Rapids, MI) are appalled by your misogyny and race baiting. The Biden/Harris signs are going up!
All in all I think this is a big arrow upward for Biden in an election that I don't think is going to be close no matter who his VP candidate is.
Remember how everyone loovved ice cream eating Joe Biden when he was Obama‚Äôs VP and now all the sudden he‚Äôs evil? That‚Äôs called a smear campaign. Republicans want you to think he‚Äôs evil so their candidate wins. That‚Äôs literally politics.. I‚Äôve had it up to here with you motherfuc

Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
It's coming down to it. I dread to see all the Trumpublicans and Trumptards in line with no masks. It's going to get very ugly. No mask=Trump, Mask=Biden/Harris. You'll know before the Vote...
No need to worry about it now! Democrats can now TEXT TO VOTE according to the new law Trump just passed! Since he didn‚Äôt want to fund the postal service they‚Äôre allowing it for Democrats.   TEXT the word: BIDEN TO: 30330   No registration/ID/signature/mask!   We did it!
But basement Biden is ahead by 7% in national polls with a margin of error of -24%
Joe Biden is calling for a 3 month mask mandate, but he hasn‚Äôt addressed the riots or the looting! GTFO
I look at Biden/Harris and they terrify me. He‚Äôs been a liar for his entire career. So phony he was forced out of the race for plagerizing last time he ran for pres. She says out loud that she believes Tara Reid yet still supports Biden. Can‚Äôt trust either to go against grain.

It really does.  If Trump wins 2 years from now we start nominating a progressive. If Biden wins a decade is wasted on shitty Centrist Corporate owned puppets.
Pick Trump. In 2 years we can nominate a Progressive. If Biden wins a decade is wasted on Corporate Puppets.

You mean nobody asked when he stopped beating his wife? What do you expect from MSM?  Think you'll ever hear a question like that posed to Joe Biden? How about ANY serious questions? Like what day is it? What month is it? What city or state are you in Joe? Great vetting MSM!!
If I have to stand there 24 hours to vote for Biden, I will!
Your privilege is allowing your political purity to outweigh the needs of the many who will immediately benefit from Trump no longer being in office.  Is Biden perfect?  No.  Is he leagues better than Trump. Without question.  Your privilege blinds you to that.
Pretty sure this is a BIDEN BOT
Dr Biden: I believe this country is stronger when the least of us is supported and lifted up. A rising tide lifts all ships.   Melanie: A rising tide lifts the ships and make us the stronger country of the least people. Close enough.
Because that shit was laughable. ZOOM OUT. It‚Äôs so simple. He knew Biden had been super dirty in Ukraine. He asked to look into it. Dems spun it in an insanely dishonest way. It didn‚Äôt work. Guess what? HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT BIDEN. The rest was a legal assassination attempt. MISSED
Umm no. Not what happened. He said, they found no evidence of Russian collusion. What you just said was a false translation from the fake news. As far as Ukraine, Biden is up on  federal charges over there for crimes. All trump did was point it out. Dems are really that ballsy

How about Harris before being a vp candidate called Biden a racist and she also said she believed all his accusers in regards to sexual assault.
Change is happening  We will get better president for 2020 . Joe Biden for the win üíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôèüèª
Vote for Biden/ Harris.What have you got to lose?
Biden will lock Trump,in the bunker.
And  will be the first to resist President Biden and a Democratic bill to raise corporate and upper income personal tax rates. But hey, he‚Äôs got those 4 delegates from America Somoa.
I never said it did.  To me voting Green is a way not to vote for Biden or Trump.  I am voting Trump. A vote he should never have got and a vote Joe is expecting based on my voter registration.
I respect your point of view. The corporate interests used millions to insert their corporate puppet and set back the progressives movement.  I would hate it if I voted green and Biden won.  A vote for trump is most revolting thing I can do to the cheating DNC.
I am voting trump because I hate Corporate owned puppets. Those folks are Republicans who like to feel good about themselves pretending to care about the less fortunate.   If trump wins in two short years we start nomination process. If Biden wins a decade is wasted.
I appreciate your point of view.    I am voting trump.   Why?  If Biden wins we don‚Äôt have a primary in 2024.  To hell with that. Four more years of trump is a million times better than a waste of ten years with Biden.
Biden / Harris ... lock em up
Biden/Harris..... Making America California. I‚Äôll pass üëéüèΩ
Biden voted against the working class from 73-2009. He voted for cutting social security 4 times. He was for such liberal favorites as Citizens United. He is for no Wall Street or Banking super vision.   Which of those is driving you to vote Joe?  What votes Joe made do you like
He can reach into my pants. What does that even mean?  For 47 years he voted with GOP. Now a ten minute talk to Bernie and all is well?    Hell no buddy.  Never Biden.
I‚Äôm obviously bored here and am immaturely splitting hairs here but Biden served from 73-09 as a ‚Äú Republican ‚Äú err democrat Senator. 47 years in DC.  Shitty 47 years.  As you can tell I‚Äôm bored.  Take care
Prison populations will explode if people are dumb enough to fall for her and Biden‚Äôs bullshit
Ending the ACA is step 1 in implementing Medicare for All.  No problem so far.   Seriously Biden is the least attractive bring nothing to the table candidate in more than 50 years.  His nomination and failure to get elected will sadden so many Centrists. Thoughts and Prayers

She signed to agree with Trump on more than a few unsavory issues, and with the ‚ÄúDefund the police‚Äù sentiment being so strong atm it‚Äôs just another example of Biden being shortsighted in the face of his goals. ‚ÄúI Need to get my black vote back up, get a black lady right?‚Äù Wrong1
Not to me.  Biden is a Corporate owned puppet.  No Medicare for all no vote for Joe.
Look at the big picture.  Bernie had largest crowds at every rally. Huge stadiums at times.  Biden had a rally today. 63 folks showed up. Corporate interests are saving millions for themselves nominating Biden. I would rather lose to trump than be cheated by the DNC again.
Ma‚Äôam I‚Äôve got many history books. Ever notice in school they never mentioned Nixon?  The history books our kids get in school is the history corporate America wants our kids to believe.   100 of the richest Americans forced Biden on us. We will do all we can to beat him
I‚Äôd  care if Corporate interests didn‚Äôt nominate Biden.  DNC cheats us. Then cry‚Äôs when GOP cheats them.
I won‚Äôt vote for Biden
What more could we ask for! She‚Äôs already proven to have zero integrity and just like Biden, the more she says, the worse she looks! Thank you Clintbama‚Äôs.... Excellent choice!

I‚Äôm not voting Biden and I did vote Hillary.  Polls are BS.
I‚Äôm not mad at you because of your pension. I‚Äôm happy and proud for you.  Your vote to these Corporate owned Puppets to continue voting against the working class.  I hate Joe Biden , the anti christ of the Dems. He voted against me 1973-20009. I can understand boomers like him.
Congratulations to Senator Harris and Vice President Biden for standing tall in adversity!! WELL DONE! Now we have to do our part VOTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I bet 100.00 she is on a pension. Biden and the corporate elite voted to abolish those in the 70s for most of us. They were grandfathered in to keeping it.  My dad likes Biden too. He earned his pension and loves his party.  In my estimation this party dies with the boomers
Hey. You vote how you vote. I‚Äôll handle mine.  The most damage I can do to this filthy Biden nomination is to vote trump.  The greens are a wonderful  option.  A trump vote is double damage. A vote trump should not have received and a vote a progressive would have got.
I understand your position. I was in it every election from 88 forward trying to get a Republican out of office.  Since we now nominate republicans I haven‚Äôt a worry in the world.  Either way these clowns are bad options. 1 has a max of 4 years left. Biden will waste 8.
The leverage will or will not be made in November.  If Biden wins progressive agenda is delayed a decade or more. Trump wins, we start fundraising at the mid terms.  We nominated a Republican. I prefer the other Republican which we can get rid of in 4 years.
That‚Äôs were our opinions differ. 100 of the richest Americans donate to the Super Pacs.  They decided Biden was best for them.  Now you decide if Corporate interests have scared you into voting for their choice?  I‚Äôm not scared.  Never Biden
If you think COVID - 19 is dangerous, Biden - 20 will destroy our country!
No chance in hell im voting Biden.  The corporate scare tactics are bullshit.  They bail themselves out every time anyway. 24 trillion deficit on the Conservative watch?  It‚Äôs all a bunch of bullshit. Never Biden.
...I barely rock with Biden and nothing could ever make me roll with Kamala!
WTF are you to judge my progressiveness?   DNC loaded up corporate puppets with cash to run against four progressives.  All corporate puppets lost. That is an act of political war.  Biden and every corporate puppet on all of our ballots should be voted against. Biden voted w GOP.
The positive would be a Biden Harris loss.
Biden sets the progressives movement back a decade if he wins.  He brings nothing to the table.  This democrat is voting trump and you should too.
We nominated a corporate owned pimp which would push progressive adgenda back a decade if he wins. If trump wins, at mid terms of his second term we could start backing a progressive.  No votes for Biden.
No . If Biden wants to run , he has to debate . Nobody gives a shit about the VP ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
She‚Äôs a terrible person to be giving more power to , between her and Biden they will explode the prison population in this country
That‚Äôs exactly why I‚Äôm not voting for Biden.  Your comment meant for Dank just resonates in my mind. An anti Biden tv add should be produced using your very own beautiful words. Honestly you have talent.
Hell no. .....  Say Biden wins..... progressive agenda is pushed back a decade at best.  If Trump wins we start fundraising in 2 years for a progressive replacement to trump in 4 years.  No one who demands Medicare for All should vote for Biden.
Corporate interests picked Harris. Biden is the complete puppet.
HARRIS IS A HYPOCRITE WHO SAID SHE BELIEVED THE WOMAN WHO COMPLAIN THAT BIDEN IS A PEDOPHILE. HAVE A GOOD DEMOCRAT KKK
This VP is different. Even Biden says, he‚Äôs no spring chicken. Kamalalala is the Deep State‚Äôs choice for president! If Biden strokes all the way out, üß®üí•Who and what she is, shows everyone the utter lack of integrity &amp; willingness to be radical these LEFTIST CRATS truly are!
For now ... until December when Biden picks her for a cabinet post ...
‚ÄúTrumps a racist, pervert, uses people of color for personal gain, babbling idiot!!‚Äù  And what did you and the DNC decide on?  A racist, pervert, using people of color for personal gain, can‚Äôt formulate a sentence (Biden‚Äôs not a babbling idiot like trump but it‚Äôs not great)
When something‚Äôs okay. ‚ÄúBelieve all women‚Äù until it turned on Biden. ‚ÄúWhite people have to stop using people of color for personal gain‚Äù until Biden did it. ‚ÄúWe need a president whose well spoken and not a hot head ‚Äú which Biden isn‚Äôt even close too.  ‚ÄúBUTTTT TRUMPPP‚Äù  Ya know,
*pretends to be shocked*  Biden, is completely using a women of color just for votes. Not because he believes she‚Äôll do the best job. Sad. You know all the other outrage when white people, were using people of color to justify things they‚Äôve said or done or this and that
Welcome to my Ted Talk.üê∏üçµ
‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt vote and like Kamala Harris cause she a black women you‚Äôre racist and sexist. Hate her because of her views‚Äù  Is it okay to pick her strictly because she‚Äôs black and a women even though she isn‚Äôt most qualified, if at all??  ‚ÄúBIDEN WOULD NEVER THATS A TRUMP THING!!‚Äù
Her and Biden are chomping at the bit to gain more power and incarcerate more people than ever before
Kamala Harris is no ‚Äúfriend‚Äù of the people , between her and Biden more black people will end up incarcerated than ever before ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
You do know Biden and Harris stance on crime and mandatory sentencing , they are the reason we‚Äôre in the mess we‚Äôre in now . Prison populations will explode if these 2 ass clowns get more power
Between her and Biden , the prison population will explode ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Taking on a prosecutor VP is suicide for Biden. He just lost a lot of pot smoker libertarian votes. I'm probably the only right wing pot smoker on earth.
Gotta remember, this isn‚Äôt a typical VP situation. Kamala is the deep state‚Äôs choice for PRESIDENT! We all know Biden‚Äôs not gonna make it very much further anyway but, the second they‚Äôre ready, they‚Äôd make him retire and have her in the oval. With her integrity... makes sense.
grand standing fraudulent virtue signaling politician of all. She was pleading to censor Trump on Twitter in order to get some cheers and when it didn‚Äôt land, she akwardly laughed through the lack of applause. She‚Äôs  screeching nails on a chalkboard FAKE. NO BUENO! NO BIDEN!
OMG  The woman that pointed out your racist behavior during the debates is now your running mate what is this world coming to? Show your white privilege Joe Biden your brain is mush old man
Maybe because they know the economy will survive since there‚Äôs no way Biden can win now üòÇ
The point in using those videos is to say ‚Äúthis is the type of nonsense that will continue if Biden is re-elected‚Äù. When he‚Äôs re-elected and the house flips over, the mess in those videos will be done. Voting him back into office will show the support is there to make it happen.

You don‚Äôt understand because you don‚Äôt think backwards like a Democrat. It‚Äôs not about what she stands FOR. It‚Äôs a new way to attack Trump &amp; his voters.

Are you on drugs?  Did they not have books in your school?  Joe Biden voted with the GOP from 73-09.  He can unify a damn thing. Don‚Äôt even let me get started on you.....
My fear is I‚Äôve seen this movie many times before.  Biden wins the DNC will fuck up the next 10 years with their corporate puppets.  The key is to cause them to lose. And try again in 2024.
Crazy as it sounds......  I too thought of 3rd party.  Idiot Biden could still win.  I‚Äôm voting in a ‚Äú Bi-partisan manner for Trump‚Äù.  I hate trump. But I‚Äôm not wasting 4,8,12, up to 16 years on Biden and Harris corporate asses.
Kamala Harris used to work with Hunter Biden doing what who knows? She enforced that 1994 crime bill against black defendants to its full extent. As a student of former mayor Willie Brown , whom she had an alleged affair with  Willie said she would make a lousy president!
Was there any Democratic primary contenders more conservative than Biden and Harris? Seriously asking
Two racist people and Biden cannot even talk or form a sentence or answer questions Harris wants to defend police, to losses
This fella has a real good YouTube show.  I watch it daily.  He is a Republican but not the idiot wearing an AR15 to the grocery store kind.  Kind of a silly post,  maybe he is paid by the comment or retweet.  Biden‚Äôs nomination took me from MSNBC and politics until 2023 ....
Awesome. Didn‚Äôt she call Biden a racist and also say she believes Biden‚Äôs accusers! What a joke,
Joe Biden Picks Kamala Harris As Democratic VP Running Mate
Biden has to win first. Cast your vote wisely.  I don‚Äôt need a corporate owned incumbent in 2024. I‚Äôm voting trump. This way we can nominate a progressive or elect yet another Republican.  Corporate Dems are worthless
Why was msmbc so late in announcing Biden‚Äôs vp pick
Anyone have the clip/video of Harris crying about how racist Biden was for wanting segregated schools and busses? That‚Äôs one of my favorites.
If you vote for Biden your nightmare in Portland will just continue forever
Thankfully he is in MA and Biden will win that state by 20%
Trump replied: ‚ÄúHe said that. Some people would say that men are insulted by that, and some people would say it‚Äôs fine. I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù  Somehow that became:   Biden is insulting men everywhere (without quotation marks‚Äù‚Äù‚Äùbtw!)  You really do have to be a detective to read the news

Yeah except even trump is trying to do something for the voters Biden doesn‚Äôt care about.  Kind of amazing we nominated a Corporate owned pimp.
I want them to roll up in that Corvette and do a big donut in front of Biden's house.

Ted or whatever your real name is......  would you like me to post your campaign contributions from Corporate America.  More and more Americans are putting together that corporate interests pay you to vote against the people.  Your no Joe Biden or anything but you have no room
Joe Biden only cares about corporate interests. He has been a corporate puppet since 1973.  He is so weak and revolting he may lose.
The only thing Biden will be picking will be his ear. The deep state chooses everything he does from his outfits to his interviews.
He‚Äôs also quite handsome but, that also has nothing to do with my point. I‚Äôll play along tho... fair to say, Biden doesn‚Äôt exactly have that gift either but, the press never comes at him even a little bit like they have with Trump. Anyone being honest, will see my point here.
man oh man, all my ignorant family members posting about how Joe Biden is a creepy pedo sure seem to forget that there is actually a creepy old man in our family who was accused and sent to jail for molesting his granddaughter, but we conveniently forget about that don't we?
That goes with the statement Trump made; If Joe Biden gets elected China will own this country. Scary!!!!!
But still pending VP pick to vote Biden?
Let's charge Ron Johnson with treason for using Russian propaganda to smear Biden. Don't believe his lies such an Russian asset
Obviously, it‚Äôs hard for anyone to imagine Biden coming up with an idea that would work but, don‚Äôt be fooled, he‚Äôs always had a staff of people coming up with his ideas for himüôÑ

All these Rose twitter üåπ peeps that were foaming at the mouth for Biden to quit are impinge over hurdles for Alex Morse.
Imagine if the FBI tried to create false narratives that the Biden campaign colluded with Russia.
Raise your hand if you believe Joe Biden has signs of dementia and is incapable of remembering what he is talking about.
Wow, seems like a lot of the smartest people around are saying the same things about Biden... he seems so sharp on tv tho
LaBomba... ‚ÄúJust like Obama except a Hispanic because everyone knows they‚Äôre the divirsiest‚Äù   Now available: Vote for Biden by texting: BIDEN to # 30330   No ID required No signature required No Voter registration  necessary  Even better than mail-in ballots  Democrats only!
If my aunt had balls...she‚Äôd be my uncle!  Thankfully, Trump is no democrat and obviously, Biden isn‚Äôt Republican.   SADLY, we won‚Äôt hear much truth about anything political from our ‚Äúfree press‚Äù and since they‚Äôre making EVERYTHING POLIYICAL, don‚Äôt expect much truth from your TV
Never seen any evidence of Russia helping Trump. I hear it all the time but, haven‚Äôt seen one example.   Biden on the other hand, has the biggest election interference machine ever created via mainstream media, every social media platform in existence, &amp; print.  Where‚Äôs the beef?
Maddie loves Joe Biden and that‚Äôs no malarkey! #Dogs4Biden
And Joe Biden is as sharp as a tack mentally.

Meathead Trump never colluded with Russia. Russia and China do not want him in office. They want Biden. Why do you think that?! Because they can manipulate Biden and not Trump!
I‚Äôm really looking forward to when Joe Biden signs executive orders banning the use of fossil fuels, guns, and requiring all the ice cream machines to work at McDonald‚Äôs, now that Republicans have decided that there‚Äôs no need for the most important branch of government.

Biden could really screw us now. Biden wins disaster for country. Trump wins his disaster continues. At least the Gov has common sense
Ok I‚Äôm fine with your decision. I‚Äôm voting against Biden in hopes he loses. Then the DNC may not nominate another corporate owned pimp. If they do again, I‚Äôll vote against them again.   It‚Äôs policy not party.  If my wife blew my neighbor I wouldn‚Äôt have him ove for dinner.
Your on the Joe Biden ACA Medicare raping of America plan.  The progressive plan has no premiums no deductible no copay.
Biden has proven he is loyal to only those who pay him millions.  I don‚Äôt have millions. He don‚Äôt have my vote.
In response:  people like you are enablers.  You accept the trash presented to you and look for a positive in the rubble.   He isn‚Äôt trump is all you have.  I agree trump sucks.  Why can‚Äôt you admit Biden is a shitty corporate owned nomination. Your enabling harms every American
You're in Michigan. I'm in Macomb County. A few Trump signs. Saw one Biden sign.a lot of American flags. Silent majority.
I‚Äôm 6 miles from Canada now.  I‚Äôll send you a pic of Americans begging to cross to buy prescriptions once I get out of work. ACA most expensive to consumer healthcare plan in the world.  Biden loves it. The corporate interests paid his campaign bills and ordered him to protect it
As long as Biden loses, nothing else matters.
Honestly,  I saw electing a ‚Äú Black ‚Äú president as a doorway to kick down ending a string of Old White Men.   Biden is the most galvinized corporate puppet ever. 73-09 he didn‚Äôt miss a Corporate ass he could kiss.  Worthless Joe is a waste of time.Not surprising at all. Did you ever see the video of that child getting ran over. People walking by. Nobody even stops. Our future if Biden wins.
Sad seeing a lot of Warren people shitting all over Biden and Harris. It's not helpful. We have one shot at getting rid of Trump. Why be another arm of the GOP? It's like 2016 all over again, only with Warren peeps. I'm sure she wouldn't approve. Unfollowing. Unfollow me. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
My Mom is I'll, pneumonia and diabetes, so we covered 5 States in 2 days. We saw the same number of coughing, ill people, without a sense of smell, as we saw Biden campaign signs...

Growing up my parents pushed honesty, I grew up living an honest life. So sad that HRC, Bill Clinton, Obama, Biden, Harris, etc didn‚Äôt have the same upbringing. Honestly it seems like Trump was one of the few that was raised right ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
So, they kinda had a Biden boat parade. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
It‚Äôs time to get Biden and Harris on stage for a vetting of their goals and how they will pursue them before the mail ballots take place.
That's because the Biden campaign is scared shitless to let either one of them speak in an unscripted setting.
Where‚Äôs Biden?
Just because Joe Biden claims that he has progressive policies doesn't mean that he will fight for any of them. His record shows the opposite.
I‚Äôve seen one Biden flag this entire election cycle. That‚Äôs it
Trump will make mincemeat out of Biden.
Oh you know... the admitted socialism policies Biden and Harris are calling for...
Back in 2010 President Obama and VP Joe Biden were going to fire 50,000 cattle guards,but Joe said he wants to oversee them being retrained for better jobs. I sure hope he has changed his tune. Hahahaha
(Snort!)  FFS, do you have some fantasy Biden will?
I have the same problem. Maybe put, that we‚Äôre Democrats, who supports Biden in our profile? Kidding, not kidding.
Why do you open yourself up for all this? One thing Biden could never do is kill 167,000 Americans and dissolve the USPS during a pandemic. You seem to be great at that, though.
Just annoys everyone but extreme leftists who will vote Biden anyway.
You wanna put some skin on that? Its proven that Biden was blackmailing Ukraine for quid pro quo for Hunter. The democrats have done nothing but praise and defend China, and have ignored the official reports saying China is in the top 3 to meddle with our election.
Trump Ads Attack Biden Through Deceptive Editing and Hyperbole
She repulses blacks and women.  It was a wonderful choice by Biden- for Trump!  LOL
Just crossed 5 States, dozens of Trump banners, not 1 Biden.  Not 1.
Democrats are the party of the kkk. It never changed. They just got better at lying. When joe Biden says well, all the racist shit joe says, that‚Äôs because that‚Äôs how joe really thinks. They aren‚Äôt gaffes! He just forgot to lie.
Biden can‚Äôt even spell his own name. Democrats are criminals. If you want a Soviet government then vote Biden.
You raised a man worse than that.  Hunter, your family (sister, brother,son and yourself) are corupt to their bones thanks to YOU... for what?  Love of money and power. Tell me again what in your 40 yrs in  government have you done for Americans vs. your Biden clan? Ur worthless.
Lying about Biden in Newsweek, doesn‚Äôt make it true.
Maybe you should have targeted Joe Biden and the rest of the Demonrats. Why did it take so long and you have nothing to show for it.
If you think Trump is going to do anything other than help his buddies steal as much from us that they can, you‚Äôre thinking wrong. Biden would be so much worse though.
I noticed that... Kamala Harris was Biden's handlers' pick y'know...
Vote for Biden.
Love it, keep doing it, if Biden can do that it's fair game. That is hilarious.
I'm glad you are free to support Trump so much. I stand with for the children in cages, and I proudly stand with Biden/Harris.

Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report  #FoxNews
Another question you can ask: Why is the sky blue? Why can't Biden complete a sentence?
Dumbass question. How come Biden &amp; Harris can't answer any questions? Let me guess, because they don't have any answers. Biden is too busy cashing checks from the Ukraine and China.
Biden &amp; Harris can't answer any questions! Ask some relevant questions, like "President Trump, how did you accomplish so much in 3 years? Biden has been a politician for 45 years and has no accomplishments."  . #NeverBiden
Because they can't answer any questions and they don't have any accomplishments to discuss. Biden will be in a nursing home by November.
Obama &amp; Biden were too busy corrupting America and filling the swamp.
Just saw my 1st Joe Biden ad on the local station here in deep red WY. It sounded great, but not sure how the mandatory mask bit will go over here, so many covidiots!!
Plug your nose and vote blue! I‚Äôll personally assure you that Biden is a good man and Kamala is a great woman. Look at the fool that‚Äôs in there now? If you don‚Äôt vote you are giving Chump a vote!
I‚Äôm voting for Biden/Harris because they can actually do the job without the lies and blatant corruption.  They are true diplomats and can mend fences with our allies.  Also, I‚Äôm tired of the division that has happened to our country.

She's notorious for oppression of Black Americans as a DA. Called Joe Biden a racist. Damn bear EVERYTHING she says is race based... so who's the racist?
Great to be in-studio yesterday at  in Casper to talk about the important issues facing Wyoming, as well as why Kamala Harris's radical policies would hurt our state and the nation.
No the most extreme Ticket was unqualified Trump! And the  has done everything to cover for his 21,000+ lies, the disaster of 166,000+ DEAD American's! Biden/Harris has come forward with plans to fight the Virus, not worry about shower heads! You're a disgrace just like Trump
Wait, wait, I can do that too: I have Dem friends in the bluest of blue states and not one of them is voting for Biden.  See how easy it is!
Joe Biden Tries to Take Credit for Trump Brokered Peace Deal as Rashida Tlaib Yells At Clouds
Nope. I‚Äôd agree Trump would get credit if the economy were churning along when Biden takes office, but it currently is and almost certainly will be in free fall at that point.
Maybe the First Couple's mail-in ballots will be "lost" somewhere until they are discovered a week after the election of President Joe Biden.
I won‚Äôt credit Obama, but I certainly hope I get the chance to credit Biden.
It‚Äôs really more of a suggestion of what Biden thinks should be done.  He won‚Äôt actually be sworn in until January, so that‚Äôs when it would start. By then, we‚Äôll likely have a vaccine.

Perhaps, but you have to admit Trump inherited an economy that was roaring along, while Obama inherited one that was in a death spiral. Ironically, if Biden wins, he‚Äôll inherit an economy in worse shape than the one Obama did.
So isn‚Äôt it time to enthusiastically endorse Biden/Harris? Your dad would.
I'm calling it for Trump.  Liberals are completely oblivious to Harris's wh*r* problem with women.  She actually reduces Biden's appeal.

Don't believe a word Biden says. Pure bullcrap pulled out of thin air. Remember, Biden liked Robert KKK Bird. #NeverDemocrat
Biden. You made a bold face lie about wearing masks and saving lives. Nobody could say with any accuracy that wearing a mask will save 40,000 lives. Total bullcrap. Standing for the flag is Patriotic, not wearing a mask. When are you going to answer questions from media?
Kamala Harris is everyone‚Äôs worst nightmare. Thanks no balls Biden.
Also...Biden has 50 years of lies to answer for, so can't wait to see if he gets asked similar questions.  Oh, wait...he won't even take questions.
THIS is leadership. Not Joe Biden.
I wonder, too. You could say the DNC strategy was a success since it beat Bernie Sanders. Seems like a costly victory, though, if you permanently lose a good part of your base, which I think the party has. Then pick a limp candidate like Biden and search for political Viagra. Wow
Really? Joe Biden had 50 years in government, and didn‚Äôt ‚Äúfix‚Äù this. Now, all of a sudden, it‚Äôs a priority and he can fix it.  Nope, not buying it!
Those are completely made of statistics. Multiple sources and polls say that only about 10% of Sanders supporters won't be voting for Biden and for Yang idk. But either way, you're lying out of your ass and making yourself look like a fool

I notice the poll stories are over three weeks old now.  When that happens, it means Biden isn't doing so well.
I think we can gauge by her primary performance.  That's her first national campaign.  She came in dead last- behind the likes of Bloomberg, Gutbieg, Pocahontas, even Biden himself.  Zero power.
When I watch Mr.Biden and listen to his,as people say,rambling on,and lack of putting words together too form intelligent speech.  I feel sorrow for him,and at Sametime shame for his staff,and family for keeping him in the limelight. Let the poor man retire. He really needs help
Election gambling odds. You bet $100 to win $43 with Biden ($143 payout) or You bet $100 to win $125 with trump ($225 payout) . You could bet $100 on Kanye and if he wins you win $50,000 ($50,100 payout). Something to watch. Trump was +1150 at a point in 2016.

Glad you'll base your vote on policy. I'm appalled that Biden's VP pick was limited on criteria - race and gender. He shut out so many other accomplished candidates just because of their biological traits. I do believe that's the true definition of racist and sexist.
Trust me took time. Trial and oh several errors. but the wait was well worth it. Don't know if the age difference makes the differents... shhh don't tall anyone, I'm 52 he is 38. So there is that. üòä
She's the choice of the Vatican.  Biden, Pelosi, Hillary and Obama are some of the other pseudo-religious secret followers of the Vatican. They have been promised, by the Pope, that they are chosen to rule the world. That's why Hillary was so p*ssed when she lost.

C‚Äômon man (Joe Biden voice)! You can‚Äôt just say crap like that and bounce!!

Yes. The moron line was negative, but I'm sure people know what I mean. It's either Trump or Biden. Anything else is a waste of time and energy. From the top on down and back up, a Blue ticket will get us out of GOP hell.
Still seeing so much butt hurt. Warren was my choice too for president. But guess what? It didn't happen. I got onboard with Biden immediately. Because I'm not a moron. Negative energy will never create the change you want. Numbers matter. We have to get a super majority. Period.

Trump will beat Biden. It's no surprise Biden picked an Indian descendant of slave holders.  We need to start a rebuilding process.  Get Kanye involved in 2020, then, in 2024, he may be in a position to win.  Let's give the guy a chance!
I'm embarrassed to see Biden signs in my neighborhood. How do people get that clueless?

Hey Biden you couldn't pass rotc,you failed in rotc had nothing but c and ds in college your a failure,and a disgrace to be running for president. You and Kamala are a disgrace to man
Seriously? And he calls Biden demented? Lol
But YOU stepped all over this fantastic news by going after Harris and Biden instead of delaying comments on them to promote the agreement. YOUR fault! Not the fake news fault. YOU handed them the methodology to undermine your achievement
Don't vote for air head biden and dumb ass kamala they will screw the world up and then the ones who vote for him will be crying cause jobs will disapear in PA and people are gonna have to pay high taxes. Wake up America pull your head out of your asses. VOTE FOR TRUMP

Biden condemned Trump for the China Travel ban, he‚Äôs an idiot that couldn‚Äôt pour piss out of his shoes if the directions were written on the soles.
Biden does have a debt forgiveness plan, it's not all encompassing, but it should cover most Americans.  I got nothing on the others tho.
Just out of curiosity, simply yes or no, do you still believe Biden's accuser? No BS political answer. Simple yes or no. Feel free to explain why but a one word answer is all I'm asking for.
Just got a letter from Biden's camp addressed to my Great Grandfather, who has been dead for at least 50 years...lmao
Biden is like me he isn't for abortion he just doesn't think the Government should control a woman's body that's all speaking of socialism that's real Government control right there...
Biden didn't ask for dirt Trump did although Trump's sons had business deals in Russia yet you didn't bat an eye about that..
You say Biden is creepy but a case can be made for Trump as well so wouldn't that make you a hypocrite?
I'm not a socialist and neither is Biden. Biden holds more conservative values than Trump actually. As I feel being a conservative means you're a true man of God, spreading the love of Jesus Christ.
Let me get this straight...Biden has the support of the Post Office and Trump has the support of the Police...it‚Äôs Letters vs. Cops...Who will win? üçø

The Anti-Biden people are much better off trying to push Conservatives to vote for Libertarians, but that makes too much sense and is maybe too much work for them.
The reason I say he has more conservative values is because a true conservative is a man of God and there's no question that Biden is more a man of God than Trump is
Biden is not far left and if your mind was not easily influenced by conspiracy theories you'd realize this in fact he has more conservative values than Trump has...
Also this has nothing to do with Trump I was just telling you what Biden said...what you don't believe there are crooked cops? Really?
No they're not...you do realize that Biden is for the exact opposite right?
lol he thinks Biden has dementia?
I'm not a Democrat but I will tell you that I see Biden with more conservative values than Trump has

Biden will probably have his hands all over Harris since he likes touching women and she is a nasty animal that needs here rabies vac.These 2 are the biggest joke I have ever seen. DON'T VOTE FOR BIDEN N HARRIS THEY WILL F#*K US AMERICANS OVER VERY BAD DON'T BE
You got to watch governor Whitmer she all mad cause she can't see glory and stars now that she was not picked by Biden,She is a sell out,she suppose to care for michiganders but she sure was kissing biden feet to be elected vp.another joke

It will be funny when the Biden,Harris campaign talks about trump and his family donations to Kamala
That's fantastic! So he's for Biden now I guess.
I think Kamala‚Äôs  past might be a bit of a negative but she has done good things. I don‚Äôt think the vote for Biden needs to come down to his VP choice. His decency and complete sentences make him a better option than Trump
VP means almost nothing. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs anything to worry about. I think Biden only does 1 term and being VP makes Kamala the front runner in 2024, but statistically VPs don‚Äôt go on to win the following election. Last 2 times were Bush 1 in 1989 &amp; Van Buren in 1837.
Kamala is nothing but a lieing low life person,she talks nothing but bull crap.She will do nothing to help americans,all she and Biden are gonna raise your taxes,do away with fraking which will cause a lost of jobs,I guess if you vote for them can pay big money
Big Biden accounts could have RTed that poll but refused to that's on them like
Recently yeah, that's all I've been watching of either guy. I think Biden's strategy lately has been good in that there hasn't been a lot of material, but the problem is that the material that there is lately hasn't been good, the Vette commercial excepted which was quality
Let's worry about getting Biden and Kamala in the office before berating them on policies and past behavior. Sure, we can scrutinize. But I fear we run the risk of wavering minds voting 3rd party. Not a risk we should be willing to make.
Then a non vote for Trump is a vote for Biden. I‚Äôm not voting for Trump then lol
Bad, but shit Biden's looking worse lately. I watched a few videos of him now vs him during Obama, and it's brutal. I'm hoping for some type of clarity during the debates
Might not logically follow, but still true. Biden hasn't been looking good.
Kamala is a leftist along with others like Old ass Bernie.they are nothing but trouble DO NOT VOTE FOR BIDEN &amp;KAMALA THERE GONNA DESTROY AMERICA.ALL AMERICANS NEED TO OPEN THERE EYES AND SEE HOW BAD THEY ARE.ETS KEEP AMERICA GREAT WITH TRUMP.

My Statement on Elections in Belarus | by Joe Biden | Aug, 2020 | Medium
Your only speaking to the rich! Obama/Biden reversed the worst Recession, since the Great Depression, and created more jobs than Trump. Then Trump ruined it all, overnight!
Yet, more people are unemployed than when Obama/Biden took office in 2009! In fact, unemployment has only been higher once, in the last 100 years, during the Great Depression!
And Trump has been in Washington less than 4! Who knows politics more than the other? Who's done more for Americans... Biden, that's who!
Really? 5 out of 6 swing states have Biden leading Trump!
She's far from "radical"! 23% of Republican voters like her more than you! 16% of Republican voters like Biden more than you!
And yet Biden &amp; Harris and all the rest of their circus monkeys had zero masks on. Interesting

The only difference you will see in our politics when Biden is elected is that you will have both DEMS &amp; GOP criticizing everything where as not 1 GOP dares to criticize the duck.

I agree with that, I think Biden is only in this for one term. He didn't want to run for President, her was pulled Out to run.

Biden didn't pass the USMCA which significantly increases the requirements for domestic auto content
Yes I think he would. I don't think he actually cares about winning. Biden has been shifting on black voters this entire spring/summer. He actually has spoken out against almost every policy initiative black voters and protestors have brought up.Under Obama the US became the leader in exporting oil.  That made it worse. Biden will do nothing to address, or even start to address, the climate crisis.  He's known about climate change since the 70s and hasn't done anything to make it better.
Biden doesn't listen because he supports corporate statism and kamala herself which i will give her credit for, supports 2K per month UBI while Biden won't support it or sign the bill.
It's all authoritarianism because even Obama tried to dismantle the usps himself.  Biden supports corporate statism and trump is fascist.
She may have cosponsored the bill but Biden said he wouldn't sign it. He said that he wouldn't sign any bills to do with Bernie or the squad.  So he's still essentially a moderate republican who signed the crime bill that militarized the police and the bankruptcy bill too

I'm so grateful for  Thanks for tackling the real issues with decisiveness, perseverance, and focus.  Side note: I was real worried #Biden was going to take #BigGretch from us. She's saved countless lives, and selfishly, I'd like her to continue protecting us.
We don't have an intelligent option between Trump and Biden. Next.
I'd be more inclined to buy this analogy if wearing a mask also meant incubating COVID 2 which would appear 4 years down the line.  Biden is like sending kids back to school with masks.
I don't care what Party you are in at this point.  If you don't Back Biden/Harris and you are female...you're not For Women.  Prove me wrong.
Biden has done it before. Yes with mistakes, but he is not God. I am losing a lot these last 3 years, I am 74, I want hope for my wife and family before I go home.
I also believe the best candidate should be elected: the one who actually wants to fix the problems. Kamala and biden will not fix anything.  There's only one good choice,  and

Trump raped his ex-wife &amp; accused of sexual misconduct by 25 women:   "Grab em by the pussy" "Just start kissing them"  He peeped on teens as young as 15 at the 1997 Miss Teen USA pageant.   BUT YEAH LETS GO AFTER BIDEN /s

False.   6 months ago the ecomony was as good as its EVER been with record low unemployment.   The Dems found a way to use a fear mongering and mass shutdowns to destroy economy and blame Trump.   Want to see the economy die?  Elect Biden

Pence: Kamala Harris as Biden's VP confirms Democratic Party controlled by radicals
I see what you folks are doing (Don Jr. made a similar claim earlier). You are so scared of Biden that you are trying to make the election a contest between Harris vs. Trump instead of Biden vs. Trump. How desperate and sad. Luckily Harris is a better candidate than Trump.
Both Biden and Harris have long careers characterized by bowing to prevailing political pressure.  This has meant some bad policies in the past, and some good.  What it means now is that if progressives exert enough pressure over the next 4 years, we can get progressive policy.
In ‚Äòmust-win‚Äô Michigan, Trump campaign takes fight door to door as polls show Biden with strong lead
The Dem party establishment has no respect for the working class people of this country.  One can vote for a Biden-Harris ticket out of necessity, but to claim it to be anything more than a least-worst is a slap in the face to the ethics of human decency.
There are a lot of oddities. Like WAY more scenarios than I a comfortable with have Biden winning MS or LA but losing AZ, NC, FL, MN. It's totally odd stuff ATM and I am not sure if these are outliers or really 7-10%.
So, she's announcing that she will be putting out a contract on Joe Biden? That he will be somehow rubbed out before the election? That's what it sounded like she said. (By the way, did this clip cut out just BEFORE she took a giant swig from her wine bottle she keeps at hand?)

Still gonna vote for Joe Biden but Im still really fucking mad about it

Upton‚Äôs gonna endorse Biden and when he does it‚Äôs important to me that people remember I called it.
A Biden/Harris ticket is not awesome if you want true progress as a Democrat. Neither of them have shown commitment towards the popular progressive policies the people actually want. They‚Äôre better than Trump... but many people ‚Äúdon‚Äôt like it but will support it anyway‚Äù.
Joe Biden is receiving briefings now. Thank goodness there‚Äôs an adult hearing the important things. üò≥
Anyway I‚Äôm never forgiving Gen X for intending to vote for Warren then when she dropped out voting for Biden. I literally... why.

I also keep seeing Trump sympathizers and fence-sitters implying that voting for Biden/Harris is a vote for defunding the police and destroying the country? Like, neither of them are that progressive, calm down.

you're right, it doesn't make any sense for Hitler to be Biden's VP. whoever suggested such a hypothetical must be a real bologna head.
#KamalaHarris Ultimately will be President if Biden wins, and I just don't think she is up to the task. Her policies would greatly hurt the economy in a time of crisis and she would further add to the political division in the nation.
I'll still hold my nose and vote for Biden. I may have voted for Amash instead had he not dropped. At least he was anti war, wanted to cut military budget, and wanted to demilitarize the police.

Kamala Harris was by far the hardest on Biden during the debates. Those clips will be SOMETHING to see.
Biden not stealing my governor to be vice president is the sort of basic political good sense that is always nice to see. Democratic governors of Michigan are just way more valuable than Democratic senators from California.

Whitmer sent word to Biden's team that while she was flattered, she no longer wanted to be considered for the running mate slot, according to a high-ranking Democrat familiar with the process. She recommended Biden pick a Black woman.
The Michigan governor had caught the interest of Joe Biden and his vice presidential vetting committee, who were drawn to her prominence in a crucial battleground state and her aggressive response to the coronavirus outbreak there.

This list is long if harris and biden damage to black community.  She only 25% black so stop dragging out that card. She the great child of largest slave owner in Caribbean .her dad's half black mom Indian . Biden best friend was clan wizard . can you get a more racist ticket?
Biden/harris never be elected. You couldnt get a more racist ticket if the KKK themselves put them up.
Yeah I dont see trump giving whitmer a job. Biden has 0 chance of being elected.  A known bigot and the great grand child of largest slave owner in Caribbean .i dont think so. And before you say snopes says may not be true I show you 1 of 400 pages I can show you

She has been a VP contender since she  endorsed Biden. Harris is the first Black woman and Asian American person on a major-party presidential ticket.

AP sources: Whitmer met with Biden as he nears VP decision
I have a strong belief that Biden is going to lose.
Great. Hope they get Biden
A trip to Delaware has people talking up Gov. Whitmer's chances. Here are the pros and cons of adding her to the Democratic ticket in the fall.
One way or another, we‚Äôre likely to know Biden‚Äôs choice before the Democratic National Convention begins next Monday.
I will vote for Mr. Biden regardless of who his VP pick is.  I think he needs a strong pick only because of his advanced age. ‚ù§Ô∏è
The video in this thread I posted about Biden looking like a moron
me too. Let‚Äôs not vote for this joke... what ever happened to hunter Biden? He got real quiet real fast
Said ONE SKETCHY THING?! Are you drunk ?? Biden does that shit 2x a week IF THEY LET HIM OUTTA THE BASEMENT! That old man is scared to debate trump Bc he will look like the fool he is
LOLOLOL! Isn‚Äôt it hilarious this is the BEST you Dems can come up with üòÇ don‚Äôt forget that you think JOE BIDEN is your best shot at winning ü§°

I hope she gets nomination so we get rid of her. Biden doesn't have a chance in hell of winning election. She be out of politics for a while be good for michigan. She only has support in greater detroit area the other 90% of state hates her

Russia not a big deal they stop being a major enemy of usa 30 years ago when ussr broke up they have 5% military budget of usaIt‚Äôs also pretty lame of  to not follow up with, ‚Äúso, do you not think those attacks (implying Joe Biden is a racist for working with segregationists and opposing busing) were true? Or what?‚Äù But he‚Äôd likely say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just a comedian‚Äù

Trump Syndicate. RICO Act in 2021. That's if we win. Biden/Harris!
#Biden has googly eyes on Harris.  You may have seen that almost kissing moment photo. üò¨
2 weeks ago, my friend and I took a trip to Caseville, up North. The Biden signs and the Trump signs were about equal. Danny is a Trumper. Doesn't mean I don't still love him. He's just misguided, like my Mother. Just don't talk politics üòú
And Biden will take care of all those things? Hahahahaha
Y'all realize that all these polls with Biden smoking Trump are, as  said, "Bullshit Polls," right? Y'all got giddy like this in 2016 and you're doing it again.
Yes they should him! And he can‚Äôt stand Biden or Harris!
Well, that‚Äôs the Biden endorsement I wasn‚Äôt expecting...
Even after Biden wins in a couple months, does anyone really think the social fabric in America will ever be the same as prior to the advent of the virus?
I think you‚Äôre a traitor who‚Äôs getting paid by Russia to smear Biden. Your story is weak, Russia isn‚Äôt getting their money‚Äôs worth.
This attitude right here is why I have no time for progressives shitting on Biden nonstop. A god damn former right wing tea party congressman can put his beliefs aside to end the emergency and so can everyone else.
For the people in the back: Biden and Harris are not radical leftists. Run your campaign and blast the other side and do your thing, but don‚Äôt scare people with statements that are not true.
Remember when Joe Biden said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt work for you.‚Äù Remember that when you vote.
That‚Äôs cause you tell so many lies!!! Biden a honest man!!!
The year is 2021:   Trump has been physically removed from the White House after his loss.  Biden has implemented a national mask/testing strategy, eliminating COVID in 6 months.  USPS is fully funded.  College football teams are gearing up to start a fall season.  Life is good.
#SaltyArmy If you're ridin with Biden, make sure he doesn't steal your hairbrush üòÜ SALT MUST FLOW
So we just need some other org to say you can't vote for Biden, and then we can install a Catholic monarch, right?
Not even Biden writing these tweets
No SMART citizen would want Biden as president! #TrumpTrain
I would have had Brain dead Biden on the Left side- implying visually she was the ‚Äúright hand ‚Äú woman.
Just a reminder NOT voting for Trump is a vote for Biden.ü§£ #DownBallot #NeverBidenNeverTrump #NeverBidenNeverKamala #KickRocksKamala
So the Russia interference investigation indeed was a witch hunt like Trump had been saying. FYI this happened under the Obama/Biden administration.
The Blue Wave, my neighbors, the positivity Biden/Harris stirred up. We need to find a way to channel all the anger we have towards Trumpublicans into positivity for Biden/Harris. We're not out of the woods untill January 20.
It's coming down to it. I dread to see all the Trumpublicans and Trumptards in line with no masks. It's going to get very ugly. No mask=Trump, Mask=Biden/Harris. You'll know before the Vote...
2/3 a coup, Obama/Biden had a pattern of 8 yrs of spying so why is anyone surprised that they spied on Oppo party and a Presidency  They spied e.g. Merkel, AP, Rosen/Family, Congressional committees; All Americans=Clapper lied under oath; Brennan lied, Comey leak/spied
I just pray we see a Trump vs. Biden debate.
No need to worry about it now! Democrats can now TEXT TO VOTE according to the new law Trump just passed! Since he didn‚Äôt want to fund the postal service they‚Äôre allowing it for Democrats.   TEXT the word: BIDEN TO: 30330   No registration/ID/signature/mask!   We did it!
But basement Biden is ahead by 7% in national polls with a margin of error of -24%
Joe Biden is calling for a 3 month mask mandate, but he hasn‚Äôt addressed the riots or the looting! GTFO
Joe "I don't do white running mates" Biden is definitely turning out to be the real deal.
I look at Biden/Harris and they terrify me. He‚Äôs been a liar for his entire career. So phony he was forced out of the race for plagerizing last time he ran for pres. She says out loud that she believes Tara Reid yet still supports Biden. Can‚Äôt trust either to go against grain.
I need to ask you if you are for or against abortion? &amp; Either for or against the LGBTQ? I am just asking a simple question. I agree with Biden about the economy, &amp; I Pray you are there to help him as well. To be honest, I lost trust in politics years ago.üò∞
"FAKE NEWS: Joe Biden spreads unhinged conspiracy theory about the USPS removing mailboxes in Portland"  #news #feedly
Ill be looking forward to seeing the Running VP behind bars. Shes an active terrorist and a communist. If Biden is elected we can put her away forever. In her own system.   42 U.S. Code¬†¬ß‚ÄØ1985.Conspiracy to interfere with civil rights

So ya'll poorly edited a bunch of clips together of Hannity talking about Joe Biden, and tried to make it seem like it's about Trump? You're doing the same stuff the wallstreet journal did to pewdiepie? But you don't think young people are going to see through that? HA!
It made be crystal clear to us, but I think, at least to Joe Biden, he is blind to it! Or at the very least not consciously aware?
Congressman Khanna, you are more of a leader for the people than Biden or Harris will ever be. Please keep up your pressure if they get elected.
Just in Postal workers union endorses Biden, warns 'survival' of USPS at stake  via
We are so fortunate to have you as Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate. Major hurdles, of course,   Massive sexism (at 72 yrs I so understand), birthism (no surprise), that craziness about no red meat (anything to be just plain crazy). We just fight the good fight!!!!
I understand you live in fear and sound foolish.   Facts are facts. Trump wins we start nominating a progressive 2 years before 2024 election.  If Corporate puppet Biden wins we waste a decade on this pos corporate owned pimp.   Why waste any more than 2 years on this?
It really does.  If Trump wins 2 years from now we start nominating a progressive. If Biden wins a decade is wasted on shitty Centrist Corporate owned puppets.
Pick Trump. In 2 years we can nominate a Progressive. If Biden wins a decade is wasted on Corporate Puppets.
The only reason they chose her is so they can call Trump a woman hating racist. She doesn‚Äôt even need a brain. Now Biden looks less racist and they have 2 virtue signal boxes checked to respond to Trump with.
So what the hell is your point?  Because he repeated a grade that makes him ineligible to be POTUS?  Really Soledad I expected better from you than this bs!  Move on, #Biden-Harris to save USA!
I'm afraid that come november, even if Biden gets elected, people are going to assume they can sit back and stop protesting for important causes because the president will "fix everything" which is NOT the case. Regardless of who wins, don't stop fighting. They won't change
Biden is a warmonger who along with Obama/Hillary invaded Libya, drone bombed seven countries and fueled Syrian/Yemeni war and sent American soldiers to fight useless wars. How is any of that showing empathy and leadership?
Vote for Biden anyway.  Count on Biden to put together a team of advisors that he will actually listen to.  He‚Äôs not going in thinking he has to know everything.  He just has to know how to lead.  Besides we have a better shot at surviving the next 4 years with Biden for Prez.
A vote for Biden is a vote supporting his warmongering with Obama, their invasion of Libya, their drone bombing in seven countries and the death of 100,000 brown people. F off with your democracy. A vote for Biden is a vote for war and murder.
It‚Äôs cool. Biden/Obama led Libyan invasion, drone bombed seven countries, fueled arms to Syria/Yemen conflict and led to 100,000 dead brown people. So if you vote for Biden, I consider you having voted to bomb brown people.
And people say Biden can‚Äôt say anything intelligent üòÄ
2/2  is full of Crap so much data incl Dossier/FISA ABUSES; documents via Freedom of Info by   why do u let Tarlov say if I haven‚Äôt seen anything yet re Historic spying on Oppo party w so many lies by Obama/Biden Rice Comey McCabe
How does the rest of the panel let Tarlov get away w her BS - there is plenty of Documented information that Obama/Biden spied on  campaign and Presidency and it is a continuation of 8 years of spying eg Clapper all Americans; AP; Rosen/Family; Merkel  1/2
Btw I‚Äôm still begrudgingly voting for Biden. Not sorry. If you can‚Äôt acknowledge Trump is worse than Biden you need let go of your inflated image driven ego and learn to think critically. Stay mad
I live voting for Biden on ‚Äúpolls‚Äù hahaha. Trump 2020!

You mean nobody asked when he stopped beating his wife? What do you expect from MSM?  Think you'll ever hear a question like that posed to Joe Biden? How about ANY serious questions? Like what day is it? What month is it? What city or state are you in Joe? Great vetting MSM!!
If I have to stand there 24 hours to vote for Biden, I will!
Pretty sure this is a BIDEN BOT
"Hell no, I'm not resigning ... I thought (the post) was humorous. I had no idea people would react the way they did. I think people have gone overboard on this ‚Ä¶ It's an election year."
Dr Biden: I believe this country is stronger when the least of us is supported and lifted up. A rising tide lifts all ships.   Melanie: A rising tide lifts the ships and make us the stronger country of the least people. Close enough.
Because that shit was laughable. ZOOM OUT. It‚Äôs so simple. He knew Biden had been super dirty in Ukraine. He asked to look into it. Dems spun it in an insanely dishonest way. It didn‚Äôt work. Guess what? HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT BIDEN. The rest was a legal assassination attempt. MISSED
That would be Biden! Isn‚Äôt he so nice about the Black people! I can‚Äôt believe they would vote for him or Harris! Don‚Äôt trust either one of them! No he‚Äôs not joking on what he saids! I wouldn‚Äôt vote for evil racist never!
Umm no. Not what happened. He said, they found no evidence of Russian collusion. What you just said was a false translation from the fake news. As far as Ukraine, Biden is up on  federal charges over there for crimes. All trump did was point it out. Dems are really that ballsy
Joe Biden is going to force our children to read the Curand (muslim bible) in schools.
R: Don‚Äôt vote for Biden, he‚Äôs a pedo.   D: Don‚Äôt vote for Trump, he‚Äôs a pedo.   That‚Äôs a fucking issue.

I hope someone makes a digital animation of a Biden/Harris train, because wowie.
How about Harris before being a vp candidate called Biden a racist and she also said she believed all his accusers in regards to sexual assault.
I love your posts and not looking to argue..... Joe Biden isn‚Äôt intelligent enough to have written the Patriot Act.  Corporate interests wrote it and had Biden claim he wrote it. Then lobbyists threatened to primary anyone who dared to vote against it.
I just saw the gal bullying the 12 y/o and I‚Äôm leaving it on Coward‚Äôs Ratio look up my likes if you want to find it. Like listen man, I get you‚Äôre that mad about Biden and Kamala....I don‚Äôt know how to finish that sentence.
Do you want to lose your social security? Trump wants to end it. Biden voted to cut it 4 times.
Ever wonder why American Presidents are prohibited from taking monies or lavish gifts from foreign countries?  Because it compromises them.  Biden has been compromised by American corporate interests as well as Ukraine who gifted his moron son millions of dollars.
Of course. Plus she deserves it. My guess though is Biden will lose more white votes than the black votes he gains. I hope I am wrong.
He talks out of both sides of his mouth. One time he says one thing. Then five minutes later he's saying something different. And he can't stand it when Biden is right and he's not.  Trump has to be center of attention for everything. He can't stand it when Biden or Harris talk.
Change is happening  We will get better president for 2020 . Joe Biden for the win üíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôèüèª

Everything is going to come out IF we can successfully elect Biden/Harris. The Trumpublicans and Trump syndicate WILL see PRISON! That's why this is all or nothing for this corrupt regime! Vote! No matter how you do it! Vote!
Dolly Parton should be the Secretary of Humanity in the Biden Administration.
when u talk of Stock Market share how many people are in the stock Market incl pension funds. In addition, when Biden Harris say they would Mandate Nationally - it is an example of the Nanny State and Dems plan to have Govt Control over everything eg zoning Suburb 1/2
I am  And she‚Äôs a evil witch! She is not good for anything but starting trouble with racism! She‚Äôs very good at that ! Why do they say she‚Äôs black when her notionally is different! Please answer this!And you know Biden is not all their!
Vote for Biden/ Harris.What have you got to lose?
Biden will lock Trump,in the bunker.
Trump is already blaming Biden for everything and calling him a liar... also said number 1 in the world for Ventilators?!... please end this shit #TrumpKillsUSPS #TrumpThreatensAmerica
It's already collapsed and the world is already laughing. It's time for a Biden rebuild.
Every time you feel the urge to take a shot at Biden or Harris, redirect that shit toward Trump. There is a country to save.

I never said it did.  To me voting Green is a way not to vote for Biden or Trump.  I am voting Trump. A vote he should never have got and a vote Joe is expecting based on my voter registration.
I respect your point of view. The corporate interests used millions to insert their corporate puppet and set back the progressives movement.  I would hate it if I voted green and Biden won.  A vote for trump is most revolting thing I can do to the cheating DNC.
Yep a very cynical ploy by Trump. Vote for Joe Biden!
Can someone tell me one good thing about Biden?
I am voting trump because I hate Corporate owned puppets. Those folks are Republicans who like to feel good about themselves pretending to care about the less fortunate.   If trump wins in two short years we start nomination process. If Biden wins a decade is wasted.
I think Biden is better than Trump that‚Äôs it. I don‚Äôt like Biden he‚Äôs just the better of the two shitty candidates.
Thank you for agreeing with me. You‚Äôre right, you weren‚Äôt talking about Biden‚Äôs covid response, but you quoted my tweet about Biden‚Äôs covid response with a completely new topic and acted like my tweet you quoted was in opposition of your comment. Be honest in your discourse plz
I appreciate your point of view.    I am voting trump.   Why?  If Biden wins we don‚Äôt have a primary in 2024.  To hell with that. Four more years of trump is a million times better than a waste of ten years with Biden.
Biden / Harris ... lock em up
Biden/Harris..... Making America California. I‚Äôll pass üëéüèΩ
Per Biden's rule, perhaps you're not really Latino. üòâ
That‚Äôs understandable because BIDEN did not pick her. The leftists who pull his strings picked her.
Biden voted against the working class from 73-2009. He voted for cutting social security 4 times. He was for such liberal favorites as Citizens United. He is for no Wall Street or Banking super vision.   Which of those is driving you to vote Joe?  What votes Joe made do you like
Hey Kamala Harris, Care to explain why prison stocks rose, as soon as u were announced as Biden‚Äôs running mate? Or are u just gonna continue doing what your doing at the expense of others. I hate choosing the lesser of two evils
I always wonder how tf Trump shoves Big Macs down his gullet every day and has even lived this long. What kind of sick joke is the universe playing? And Biden looks like he could croak literally any second. It‚Äôs the same feeling of waiting for the screensaver to hit the corner.
He can reach into my pants. What does that even mean?  For 47 years he voted with GOP. Now a ten minute talk to Bernie and all is well?    Hell no buddy.  Never Biden.
I‚Äôm obviously bored here and am immaturely splitting hairs here but Biden served from 73-09 as a ‚Äú Republican ‚Äú err democrat Senator. 47 years in DC.  Shitty 47 years.  As you can tell I‚Äôm bored.  Take care
Amazing to see a so-called Christian call out the faith of Joe Biden (a regular Catholic churchgoer) while embracing #ImpotusAmericanus who has trampled every teaching of Jesus Christ!!! Absolute hypocrisy!!! #BidenHarris2020 #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Prison populations will explode if people are dumb enough to fall for her and Biden‚Äôs bullshit
Ending the ACA is step 1 in implementing Medicare for All.  No problem so far.   Seriously Biden is the least attractive bring nothing to the table candidate in more than 50 years.  His nomination and failure to get elected will sadden so many Centrists. Thoughts and Prayers
Join me in supporting Joe Biden via
In short, fascism won‚Äôt be changed in one election, but we can chip away at it by voting in the direction that we want. Like it or not(and I fucking hate it) Biden is our most progressive VIABLE candidate. And that sucks ass but it‚Äôs reality.
And look at the fact that RBG‚Äôs term is ending. You DO NOT want trump to be in command when it‚Äôs time for her to be replaced... anyway, my point is no voting for Biden won‚Äôt immediately change anything but it will make it easier to get the change we want to see in the future
She signed to agree with Trump on more than a few unsavory issues, and with the ‚ÄúDefund the police‚Äù sentiment being so strong atm it‚Äôs just another example of Biden being shortsighted in the face of his goals. ‚ÄúI Need to get my black vote back up, get a black lady right?‚Äù Wrong1
One single person to take command of everything. Look at Trumps cabinet and how damaging they have been to the country. Let‚Äôs be honest here, Biden probably isn‚Äôt going to even live through his full term. But the cabinet he puts in will have be way better than the current one
Not to me.  Biden is a Corporate owned puppet.  No Medicare for all no vote for Joe.
Look at the big picture.  Bernie had largest crowds at every rally. Huge stadiums at times.  Biden had a rally today. 63 folks showed up. Corporate interests are saving millions for themselves nominating Biden. I would rather lose to trump than be cheated by the DNC again.
Future that I would want to see, NOT because Biden represent the future I want to see, but because if he gets elected Trump will be out office. My main focus is just getting trump out of there ASAP because he can‚Äôt handle this pandemic. Biden sucks but he at least will be able to
With that out of the way let‚Äôs address the second thing you said. I‚Äôm not claiming voting for Biden will end the oligarchy. Not even close. Voting for one candidate can‚Äôt accomplish that, but that‚Äôs not the goal of voting for him... voting for him is just one step toward the
Is biden harris having one at 5 20
Since you decided to share a definition with me earlier I think it‚Äôs only fair I get to do the same. You still keep straw Manning my arguments. Trump is demonstrably worse than Biden. I don‚Äôt like Biden. I think we can agree that we need to abolish the two party stystem right?
Ma‚Äôam I‚Äôve got many history books. Ever notice in school they never mentioned Nixon?  The history books our kids get in school is the history corporate America wants our kids to believe.   100 of the richest Americans forced Biden on us. We will do all we can to beat him
The Biden campaign is looking more and more like "Weekend at Bernies."
2/3 let Voters exactly what Harris/Biden promised Dem Voters-    Get  info on Harris re not prosecuting Catholic Church abusers &amp; his documents- how she went after Sickle Cell Student then talk to
attack Harris‚Äô/ Biden‚Äôs Primary positions! Why, bec Harris will certainly take over from Biden- then will push her own agenda - if Biden wins and can remain Pres for 1st term - I believe he will resign near the end so Kamala will be Pres leading into the  election 1/3
I‚Äôd  care if Corporate interests didn‚Äôt nominate Biden.  DNC cheats us. Then cry‚Äôs when GOP cheats them.
Okay that‚Äôs not a good thing, but that‚Äôs child‚Äôs play compared to systematically destroying the USPS in the middle of a global pandemic. Not even in the same realm. Like I said, Biden isn‚Äôt good, but Trump is off the charts fascist. It‚Äôs not even a comparison.
okay then i don‚Äôt wanna hear shit about progressives or ‚Äúbernie bros‚Äù losing biden the election in november. y‚Äôall don‚Äôt want or need our votes but then blame us for everything when shit goes south. and for the record I still am voting for biden.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
Yes and I‚Äôm choosing to vote for the guy who‚Äôs not actively engaging in voter suppression(fascism). Don‚Äôt get me wrong I can‚Äôt stand Biden or Harris, but we can‚Äôt let Trump erode our democracy another 4 more years
I won‚Äôt vote for Biden
What more could we ask for! She‚Äôs already proven to have zero integrity and just like Biden, the more she says, the worse she looks! Thank you Clintbama‚Äôs.... Excellent choice!

DOJ? PFFT. Please with a criminal as AG. I can't wait to see these criminals go to prison. Biden has already said he will not stand in the way of investigation and incarceration of these criminals.
just watched your show. I loved how Biden teed up the mispronunciation of Kamala for you. I laughed out loud
#realDonaldTrump   Hey Joe Biden why ya Been Hiding (going over 8 thou views in 6 days//// working here and twitter to make it go Viral Help me if you can!!!! Repost) and May The Lord look over you
#realDonaldTrump   Hey Joe Biden why ya Been Hiding (going over 8 thou views in 6 days//// working here and twitter to make it go Viral Help me if you can!!!! Repost) and May The Lord look over you and your fam from Minister Thomas
The point I'm making is that Biden/Harris have a better chance of helping someone.
Wouldnt someone who champions Biden and the cop be outing themselves as well?
I feel you, I understand the gravity of it all. I can‚Äôt vote for a guy just because he‚Äôs not another guy. So I either stay home, or write in Andrew yang. Biden is more of the same and will usher in someone even worse than Trump
Awesome!!!! GO BIDEN AND HARRIS!!
Netflix is not a propaganda machine? I mean, Obama is part of netflix is he not?  Yes the US (cia..intelligence agencies)have done and allowed some creepy things...u see Trump is cleaning out deep state  pedophiles, thieves like biden, child traffickers...that's why trumps hated
I followed you and I care, as I am sure all reading this do too! I understand and this year has been awful. I have those feelings daily too. You are not alone. Try to feel the hope of Biden/Harris and we have work to do to make sure it happens. We are stronger together! üíôüíôüíô
I get Trump‚Äôs an idiot. But this is decency? Biden/Obama invaded Libya illegally, dropped record drone bombs on 7 countries, fueled Syrian/Yemeni conflict with arms and left 100,000 dead brown people. Seriously wondering if humanity doesn‚Äôt extend to non-Americans.
Bleeding liberal here. Biden/Obama admin invaded Libya illegally, dropped record drone bombs on 7 countries, fueled conflict in Yemen and Syria and left 100,000 brown ppl dead. But sure, speaking well is so important you forget about war and murder.
I get you can‚Äôt vote for Trump. I‚Äôm a liberal too. But calling Biden decent and humane? Obama/Biden invaded Libya, drone bombed seven countries in record numbers, fueled Yemen and Syrian conflict and left 100,000 dead brown people. Does your humanity not extend to brown ppl?
No new country was invaded for the first time this century.  The Dems savage Trump for being a ‚Äúthreat to humanity‚Äù  100,000 brown people died from Obama/Biden wars and drone bombing in Libya, Syria &amp; Yemen.  The Dems? Endless praise and voting for more.  Posturing assholes
Yeh...just like the deep state dumbasses biden..Harris...Schumer..Pelosi...r going to "really" change things for the better...this time.. really ? just vote for Trump..do yourself &amp; your family a favor...Trump has done more in 3  years than the last 4 puppets put together, awake!
- Biden is leading in 5 of the top 6 battleground states and the other one he is tied with Trump.   - His current average overall approval rating is 43.4%  If you don‚Äôt believe the polls, okay so be it, but he‚Äôs blatantly making shit up here. Come on now lol be better.
When we read this headline.   BIDEN/HARRIS WIN WHITE HOUSE.
Majority of Americans (even 49% #Democrats) think   would not finish first term if elected  #tcot #gop #migop
Out-of-touch #Democrat  thinks helping Americans through this pandemic equates to war on Social Security  #tcot #gop #migop
Joe Biden couldn‚Äôt put a 25 piece puzzle together, but he‚Äôs going to put the economy together! üòÇüòÇ
After the 50th lie poured out of Biden‚Äôs mouth, I had to change the channel. Therefore never heard a single word Harris had to say; oh well. No loss.
I‚Äôm not voting Biden and I did vote Hillary.  Polls are BS.
My mistake Cher.  That's supposed to say if there is one. Cher. Do yo think your friend Joe Biden is going to be President? Just curious Cher.  Me I have this really really good feeling that he will be.  And my feelings usually have been accurate. So now do you think he will be?
Kamala Harris won't stop talking about Beau Biden, it's very suspicious that she would spend this much time talking about a dead person. Possible ties to necromancy? - The Gray Fox
Question: Obama/Biden invaded Libya, drone bombed seven countries, fueled conflict in Yemen and Syria and led to 100,000 dead brown people. Does compassion only extend to American people? How can a liberal vote for this warmongering?
I understand you‚Äôre excited. But where‚Äôs the justice for the 100,000 people who died from Obama/Biden invasion into Libya, drone bombing seven countries and fueling arms to destroy Yemen? Does compassion and healing not extend to brown people, Rabbi?
Because, for better or worse, the model is now becoming a major part of the story. You can't reliably model this election, but now people will think Biden has an easy path. They shouldn't, but we know they will, which makes the model a significant variable.
missing major point &gt; the Media is going to be working w Biden Harris - and will cover for them - they will have 98% media support
The presidential race has really heated up now that Harris will run as Biden's VP, but there is still work to be done now and well after Nov. ‚û°Ô∏èCommunities of color are still asking for police reform/abolishment ‚û°Ô∏èThe injustice to Breonna Taylor has yet to be rectified (1)
Hmmm, Joe Biden has chosen the first female Redguard VP.. -The Gray Fox
When you're Joe Biden. But, pretty much ALL the time. üòò
Wow Harris and Biden huh, that‚Äôs pretty cool :) love the direction our country is going
I‚Äôm not mad at you because of your pension. I‚Äôm happy and proud for you.  Your vote to these Corporate owned Puppets to continue voting against the working class.  I hate Joe Biden , the anti christ of the Dems. He voted against me 1973-20009. I can understand boomers like him.
Please add Joe Biden to the mix.
I'm not gonna pretend that Biden, any dem or a politician is squeaky clean. I'm not naive. That said, we've seen trump enrich himself and his cronies right out in the open. How many of the small business loans went to his friends and himself.
Congratulations to Senator Harris and Vice President Biden for standing tall in adversity!! WELL DONE! Now we have to do our part VOTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I bet 100.00 she is on a pension. Biden and the corporate elite voted to abolish those in the 70s for most of us. They were grandfathered in to keeping it.  My dad likes Biden too. He earned his pension and loves his party.  In my estimation this party dies with the boomers
That is frickin halarious. You know Biden could do that cuz clown donald can barely make it off the news conference stage without holding onto a wall or column. Watch trumpy when he exits from a stage. His balance is way off; something not right there.
The truth about Biden's tax plan
VP Biden and Sen Harris are both centrist Democrats  ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Hey. You vote how you vote. I‚Äôll handle mine.  The most damage I can do to this filthy Biden nomination is to vote trump.  The greens are a wonderful  option.  A trump vote is double damage. A vote trump should not have received and a vote a progressive would have got.
I assume I'm considered a "house-wife" since I stay home to raise my son and finish my multiple degrees. But I can say that trump got it very wrong. This "house-wife" (I hate this term) is voting for Biden/Harris!!!
I understand your position. I was in it every election from 88 forward trying to get a Republican out of office.  Since we now nominate republicans I haven‚Äôt a worry in the world.  Either way these clowns are bad options. 1 has a max of 4 years left. Biden will waste 8.
Anybody realize joe Biden been in office for longer than any of us have been alive, (most of my followers) and still Has yet to change anything, what makes anyone think he will now ?üòÇ
The leverage will or will not be made in November.  If Biden wins progressive agenda is delayed a decade or more. Trump wins, we start fundraising at the mid terms.  We nominated a Republican. I prefer the other Republican which we can get rid of in 4 years.
That‚Äôs were our opinions differ. 100 of the richest Americans donate to the Super Pacs.  They decided Biden was best for them.  Now you decide if Corporate interests have scared you into voting for their choice?  I‚Äôm not scared.  Never Biden
Bruh I promise I‚Äôll still vote for Biden/Harris as a lot of us will.   I‚Äôm not gonna be fuckin thrilled about it tho. Please just admit you‚Äôre a moderate if you love this pairing, PLEASE.
If you think COVID - 19 is dangerous, Biden - 20 will destroy our country!
No chance in hell im voting Biden.  The corporate scare tactics are bullshit.  They bail themselves out every time anyway. 24 trillion deficit on the Conservative watch?  It‚Äôs all a bunch of bullshit. Never Biden.
...I barely rock with Biden and nothing could ever make me roll with Kamala!
WTF are you to judge my progressiveness?   DNC loaded up corporate puppets with cash to run against four progressives.  All corporate puppets lost. That is an act of political war.  Biden and every corporate puppet on all of our ballots should be voted against. Biden voted w GOP.
Occultists: I am the embodiment of an ever-changing universe, a supernatural alchemist capable of transmutation of soul, an infinite capacity for change, nothing is beyond my power.  People: We know it's terrible but please vote for Biden/Harris  Occultists: Sorry, can't do it.
Don‚Äôt care for Biden, didn‚Äôt vote for him, blah about Harris, but like to say they‚Äôre the same is a quantum LEAP
Politics is a chess game. Few Americans play chess. Joe Biden doesn't. In this game, he is NOT a King, he is a little soldier that Dems move to the left. Pretty soon, he'll fall of the chess board. Kamala is NOT a Queen either. She is a chameleon, who is easily changing colors.
The positive would be a Biden Harris loss.
Biden sets the progressives movement back a decade if he wins.  He brings nothing to the table.  This democrat is voting trump and you should too.
We nominated a corporate owned pimp which would push progressive adgenda back a decade if he wins. If trump wins, at mid terms of his second term we could start backing a progressive.  No votes for Biden.
No . If Biden wants to run , he has to debate . Nobody gives a shit about the VP ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
She‚Äôs a terrible person to be giving more power to , between her and Biden they will explode the prison population in this country
I was talking to a few of my neighbors last night, they support Biden, and one of them said she worried what white men will think about Harris. I said I don‚Äôt give a shit what white men think, I care about what black women think. #BidenHarris2020
That‚Äôs exactly why I‚Äôm not voting for Biden.  Your comment meant for Dank just resonates in my mind. An anti Biden tv add should be produced using your very own beautiful words. Honestly you have talent.
Most Americans r not that stupid, biden? Somatic narcissist dumbass..Harris a covert narcissist mirrors everyone...what? MSM has deceived many to hate Trump...the spirit is called leviathan ...Jezebel/narcissist have this spirit also..it twist truth
Hell no. .....  Say Biden wins..... progressive agenda is pushed back a decade at best.  If Trump wins we start fundraising in 2 years for a progressive replacement to trump in 4 years.  No one who demands Medicare for All should vote for Biden.
Yeh cus it's a joke..lost 9 billion ? The postal service needs to b put into the private sector,so the scum in Washington  like biden..Pelosi, Schumer, Harris, who like to skim the take, b thankful we now have a president who is stopping the  skim, surprised u didn't know that
Corporate interests picked Harris. Biden is the complete puppet.
HARRIS IS A HYPOCRITE WHO SAID SHE BELIEVED THE WOMAN WHO COMPLAIN THAT BIDEN IS A PEDOPHILE. HAVE A GOOD DEMOCRAT KKK
So you don‚Äôt care about the warmongering from Biden/Obama admin that invaded Libya, drone bombed seven countries and led to 100,000 brown people dying? You dont care about dead brown people? you don‚Äôt care about innocents being jailed under Kamala?
Joe Biden is a secret Muslim? What happened? Did Obama secretly convert him? Did Obama convert Biden over to Marxism as well? Is Scranton, PA really part of America? Joe! Where's your birth certificate?
This VP is different. Even Biden says, he‚Äôs no spring chicken. Kamalalala is the Deep State‚Äôs choice for president! If Biden strokes all the way out, üß®üí•Who and what she is, shows everyone the utter lack of integrity &amp; willingness to be radical these LEFTIST CRATS truly are!
Yes!!!  Is that suppose to scare us? That‚Äôs part of why I am voting for Biden/Harris.
He is, but he also realizes that he needs his voters to support Biden or trump will win again
We are not listening to anything coming from a Biden camp.
For now ... until December when Biden picks her for a cabinet post ...
The real sad thing about this Biden/Harris ticket is that as a Palestinian there really is no good option for president. Both candidates and their VPs are unabashedly pro-Israel and don't even attempt to hide it with the typical two state solution lines.
‚ÄúTrumps a racist, pervert, uses people of color for personal gain, babbling idiot!!‚Äù  And what did you and the DNC decide on?  A racist, pervert, using people of color for personal gain, can‚Äôt formulate a sentence (Biden‚Äôs not a babbling idiot like trump but it‚Äôs not great)
When something‚Äôs okay. ‚ÄúBelieve all women‚Äù until it turned on Biden. ‚ÄúWhite people have to stop using people of color for personal gain‚Äù until Biden did it. ‚ÄúWe need a president whose well spoken and not a hot head ‚Äú which Biden isn‚Äôt even close too.  ‚ÄúBUTTTT TRUMPPP‚Äù  Ya know,
*pretends to be shocked*  Biden, is completely using a women of color just for votes. Not because he believes she‚Äôll do the best job. Sad. You know all the other outrage when white people, were using people of color to justify things they‚Äôve said or done or this and that
Welcome to my Ted Talk.üê∏üçµ
‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt vote and like Kamala Harris cause she a black women you‚Äôre racist and sexist. Hate her because of her views‚Äù  Is it okay to pick her strictly because she‚Äôs black and a women even though she isn‚Äôt most qualified, if at all??  ‚ÄúBIDEN WOULD NEVER THATS A TRUMP THING!!‚Äù
Times up for Trump for sure, but a tough on crime prosecutor and Pro Police Biden? Not sure It's going to be a great thing for BLM. Definitely a team that I will be closely evaluating over the next 4 years.
No she didn‚Äôt change her mind! She‚Äôs looking at this as a opportunity if Biden gets sick she can take over as President!
Don‚Äôt think so! She won‚Äôt be debating ! It will be trump and Biden!
White larpers pulling a Joe Biden on this guy and telling him you ain't really black...

You will never ever ever get a perfect politician. There will never be a garden of eden so to speak, but you can vote people in and work towards change. Biden 2020!
AND still voting for Biden/Harris
Joe Biden has hired me, "the gray fox", to "steal" the election... Easy for me ..
Taking on a prosecutor VP is suicide for Biden. He just lost a lot of pot smoker libertarian votes. I'm probably the only right wing pot smoker on earth.
So many wonderful jobs open for so many wonderful people with the Biden administration üá∫üá∏ #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #VoteBidenHarris2020
Wasn't that long ago Harris said that Biden was a sexist and molested women...so these things are no longer true?
I take it this means Harris no longer believes that Biden is a racist and a sexist...my how opinions change when you're bought off.
You actually asked Joe Biden that Cher? What was his answer? You couldn't be any happier Cher.  Im as happy as a clam or better.

Loved meeting you back in 2018 Abdul. I think you‚Äôre right on this. I hope you also keep forcefully pushing the Biden campaign on Medicare4all since that is one of the main reasons I was a huge supporter of you back then.
Biden had a cheat sheet on his desk so he wouldn‚Äôt forget where he was. Also, is holding the phone upside down. . .
I wince when I hear people who support abolition movements toward ICE and defunding the police cheering on Biden's VP pick, who will set those movements back a generation. #KamalaHarris
Gotta remember, this isn‚Äôt a typical VP situation. Kamala is the deep state‚Äôs choice for PRESIDENT! We all know Biden‚Äôs not gonna make it very much further anyway but, the second they‚Äôre ready, they‚Äôd make him retire and have her in the oval. With her integrity... makes sense.
I disagree. Biden‚Äôs pull with those Obama / Trump voters is masssive and under reported. They will turn out where it counts.. People seem to forget that Trump won by &lt; 100k perfectly placed votes. If I recall correctly he won MI by 17k. Those votes are gone.
grand standing fraudulent virtue signaling politician of all. She was pleading to censor Trump on Twitter in order to get some cheers and when it didn‚Äôt land, she akwardly laughed through the lack of applause. She‚Äôs  screeching nails on a chalkboard FAKE. NO BUENO! NO BIDEN!
You LIAR Biden is not against NRA yes background test and Ar47, etc
Every Dem who has opinion about Biden and Harris:   Shut up.  Shut the fuck up.   You‚Äôre arguing about a fart when someone shit on your white carpet and then walked through it 9,428,016 times.   Grow up.
OMG  The woman that pointed out your racist behavior during the debates is now your running mate what is this world coming to? Show your white privilege Joe Biden your brain is mush old man
Go google Biden‚Äôs voting record from 73-09. Then stick your head in a soiled toilet and flush.  You have no idea what you are talking about.
Maybe because they know the economy will survive since there‚Äôs no way Biden can win now üòÇ
I know isn't great Cher.  Im so so happy. I tweeted her to send my congratulations to her. Kamala Harris and Joe Biden are to do a great job. In fact they right now doing a great Birthday. Trump is already running scared. He knows that Biden has the upper hand and may just win.
Amen, Jason. Amen. With Biden in the WH, Elizabeth Warren will have her day. Good things ahead. We just need to get out the vote. üá∫üá∏#BidenHarris #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #VoteLikeYourLifeDependsOnIt
Vote Trump nothing harms Corporate pimp Biden more.
The point in using those videos is to say ‚Äúthis is the type of nonsense that will continue if Biden is re-elected‚Äù. When he‚Äôs re-elected and the house flips over, the mess in those videos will be done. Voting him back into office will show the support is there to make it happen.
I feel like she's a good antithesis to Biden, and that they can round each other out a little more. I think she'll help capture more voters who want somebody with a harder edge.
Green is great. Trump votes are more damaging to Biden.  I‚Äôm not sure how many 29 dollar Bernie donations I made.  Close to 3500 I can account for. ( I smoke ) can‚Äôt always remember.....  DNC fucked me out of 3500ish. Trump it is this ballot

May I ask are you turning out to vote Biden?  Only fair to say I am not.
It means Biden is so racist, he can‚Äôt even keep it a secret. OVER &amp; OVER!
I cannot get rid of a Biden, Kamala Harris header üòµ
Do I just roll with people that are a lot further left than Biden/Harris, and they really ARE a good representation of most dems? Idk who I wanted him to pick, but she‚Äôs just never been someone I‚Äôm excited about.
You don‚Äôt understand because you don‚Äôt think backwards like a Democrat. It‚Äôs not about what she stands FOR. It‚Äôs a new way to attack Trump &amp; his voters. Anti-Biden/Harris will be considered ‚Äúanti-women‚Äù &amp; ‚Äúanti-people of color‚Äù üôÑ IT WONT WORK but, it will be PAINFULLY CRINGEY!üëáüèΩ
She‚Äôs a liar also! But then Biden is also!
Oh my God this woman is a liar! She knows Biden is a racist!
How does any decent person say ‚ÄúI believe them‚Äù yet still support Biden? It‚Äôs one thing to be a little too flirty or make inappropriate comments, especially considering he grew up in a different era. Um excuse me..FINGER RAPING A STAFFER...UNFORGIVABLE!  Really Democrats? REALLY?
This was the difference between Sanders and Warren. This is why I had to vote Biden in my state primary.   DON'T LET THE PERFECT BE THE ENEMY OF THE FANTASTIC
Bullshit! He picked who he wanted.   I wanted Warren/Harris. Then Biden/Warren. But I GOT Biden/Harris and guess what? It's STILL going to be a successful ticket and they'll accomplish great things.  COVID has validated Warren policies. She'll be unstoppable in the '21 Senate
Remember when Trump told Chris Wallace there‚Äôs no enthusiasm for Biden. Keep thinking that, big guy.
If you are spending today not criticizing the literal warmonger Biden who invaded Libya, drone bombed seven countries and left behind 100,000 dead brown people, quit with your social media posturing.
Well considering Biden doesn't even know where he is you better hope you're right on that.
My dream was Bernie Sanders and Andrew Yang and here we are with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris...
How did ‚Äòholding them accountable‚Äô work when Biden/Obama invaded Libya leaving thousands dead or drone bombed seven nations? There ain‚Äôt no excuse to vote for a war criminal. Atleast Trump hasn‚Äôt invaded a new country.
Biden/Obama bombed seven countries, destroyed Libya and drone bombed merrily. Kamala prosecuted innocent people. You don‚Äôt have to do this. Disagreements are fine but not with a warmonger and a criminal top cop.Only reason Biden wins is if the Democrats get their way with mail in voting. All these sheep need to wake up and realize that the Democrats started this virus with the sole purpose to rig this election by mail voting.
Vote for Biden :)
He is going to keep this country where it needs to be, Biden won‚Äôt and isn‚Äôt. Plain  and simple!
Fake News! Not sure what ‚Äúreliable‚Äù source you even got that from! I‚Äôm sorry but it‚Äôs not right, also I would be shocked if Biden did 1 of those things on that list you gave! üòÇüòÇüòÇ he wouldn‚Äôt just like Obama, named 10 things, but he only did 1 of those 10 things. A Joke!
What‚Äôs funny is with Biden &amp; his running mate, very Little change, Hmmm maybe that proves to you that Biden isn‚Äôt a good choice. It‚Äôs also in a rise and trumps still in office
"...suburbs are shifting in terms of demographics and political loyalties, becoming less white and more Democratic in recent elections."  So if you don't vote for Biden your not black, confirmed.
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ omg I don‚Äôt even think he‚Äôs perfect, but he is doing and caring for the country unlike Biden did &amp; Obama. Here‚Äôs a thing btw that Biden said, a few things that where racist, this is from a democrat btw!
Biden‚Äôs been supporting China for the past 40 yrs it‚Äôs their, that‚Äôs out their, look it up, That‚Äôs a fact. What did Obama did back when H1N1 was in 2009, why did it take him 8 months to finallly do something?
Also True, Facts are facts! The letter is racist and it shows how Biden is, We don‚Äôt want that as our leader in the Novel Office!
Shall we start with Joe Biden?
It is mainly focused on the Democrats and liberals not so much as Biden, he‚Äôs just gonna be a puppet and listen to what the liberals want him to do
Fine believe what you want, but Biden isn‚Äôt gonna be better I‚Äôm telling you
Ok But still Biden is not going to be a great president is what I‚Äôm stating he isn‚Äôt gonna do anything for the country, he doesn‚Äôt care, the liberals don‚Äôt care
Well then explain to me the three racist things that Biden said? He even picked a black candidate so then the blacks would vote for him
Destroy economy = more votes for Biden? How does that even make sense?
Clearly you don‚Äôt see that the left is what started this bullshit and not Donald trump! Get more Educated and see the truth for what it is! Biden will destroy this country.
Am I thrilled, excited, or inspired by the Biden-Harris ticket? Absolutely not. It's truly disappointing. Am I going to vote for them without hesitation? Of course. The alternative is four more years of Tr*mp.

No I was referring to Biden, Not trump! I‚Äôm not saying trumps perfect, but he‚Äôs far better than Biden
Hopefully, President Biden will be able to restore things.

Who ever said he was perfect, not me, I do have some hate over trump once again, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs perfect by any means and their are some things he should be way better on, but he‚Äôs miles better than Biden. So I‚Äôm going with the better option
Btw I‚Äôm not part of the corruption people that think Biden‚Äôs the best, I see the facts for what they are, so quit saying shit that‚Äôs not right about me.It is interesting to read or follow Professor Lichtman‚Äôs books predicting past elections. He has been accurate but it is based on historical metrics. He is a Dem but got Trump right last time  and many others. He says Biden this time. He has a new book out soon.
Thats a meal I would die for. I think we lost Wonder Bread in Michigan. My wife is worried about the voting/mail. My prediction only between you and me and one other for the record. Is Biden will win in a landslide even if Trump tries to destroy the mail.

Yes.   Also, Warren with the KO punch to Bloomberg was pretty interesting. I thought Bloomberg was gonna steal the Biden lane for a minute.   Biden owes Warren for that. LOL
That would be crazy. Biden would have to win Texas if he won the third district

Pollsters are fearful due to missing the Trump victory so they are reluctant of being too strong for Biden despite their own polling. My guess is that the polling for a Biden victory is accurate. Harris will increase his lead in the polls. Trump will be defeated unless Putin and
Funny, they don‚Äôt have any evidence of Biden going out to Pedophile Island. But we know your Cheetoh in Chief was there... (along with the other pedophiles Epstein, Spacey, Weinstein, Clinton, Maxwell, etc.)

I never thought anyone could compare in speaking ability to President Obama. Harris did it today. She hit it out of the park. It was one of the best speeches other than ones by JFK that I have heard. She will be formidable. Pence and Trump are no match. Biden was excellent too!
We know there's always behind-the-scenes negotiating for a job as important as Vice President, but let's put what's important front and center: Kamala Harris is an eminently qualified, battle-tested candidate. Her record earned her the nomination.
IMO Biden needs to secure the moderate vote more than the liberal vote and Kamala was a good choice for that. Really there weren‚Äôt many candidates who were a woman of color and also qualified to govern the country. I agree that it‚Äôs not the best look but also people need to chill

Ok sure but there 3 months till the election do you think enough people are going to vote independent (and agree on a candidate) to make even a dent against Biden or trump Conservatives are anti change that's their whole schtick, you need a liberal supreme court for real change
Climate change is an existential threat we need to address immediately, right?  Biden has a $2 trillion dollar climate plan approved by the Sunrise Movement.  So, is the message "we need to fight climate change now, but the Earth can survive 4 more years of Trump"?
Given the current situation, I think its extremely important that I/we vote for Biden/Harris, but just because I have less criticisms of them than I do their opposition, doesn't mean that those criticisms disappear
There's a lot of talk saying people with severe criticisms of Biden/Harris unrealistically want a perfect candidate and I think that's a BIG stretch. Gigantic even.
I'd prefer incremental progress and Biden passing a public option getting us from 20% uninsured to 3%.   I guess you'd prefer Trump taking us from 20% back to 40% once they finish gutting the ACA in his 2nd term on the hopes a socialist revolution will happen.  2/2
They truly have no consistent message against Biden.  He's on decline. But he also leading Antifa. He's bought by Wall Street. But also lead by radical socialists like AOC He wrote the crime bill. But he's going to let gangs loose in the suburbs.

Biden/Harris support return to Iran deal which takes the Mullahs/Hezbollah off their death bed and resuscitates terror and violence toward Israel. They support threatening Israel to make concessions and deals with Jew hating Abbas etc.
And they along with Bernie endorsed Biden.
Looking at the various "if the election were held today" polls and the comments under them, it's pretty clear Democrats/liberals aren't happy with Biden/Harris ticket. Almost all of the "what about the 3rd party option" replies are from the "resist" types.  Just an observation...
She has publicly called Joe Biden a racist. Now she's joining him on the ticket. Either she doesn't have integrity or she has become a racist or she was slandering an old man for her win! What do you think?
So because the Obama team didn't do it this way they automatically assumed that Biden's team wouldn't?  It makes sense, really--get the oppo out there to see if anyone gives a shit *and* to see how the prospective VP candidate handles/responds to it being dumped.

So here‚Äôs a question: How long has his digital/graphic design team known she was his pick? Or did they create logos, websites, graphics, site content, etc for EVERY likely choice just in case? Are there Biden/Warren, Biden/Whitmer &amp; Biden/Rice websites buried on the server?
The pressure for Biden to have some major legislation will be intense not just from Bernie or Warren but yeah that‚Äôs makes sense.   If there is no Senate Majority we might as well sit back and watch Netflix.
If Biden wins there will literally be a Qanon caucus in 2022.   I wish I was joking
I think folks are under the impression that Biden himself is acting as his own web developer or something.

Interesting that the stock market took a hit near the end of today. If Biden wins. We will find out what the crooks were up to these past years.
Biden made the best choice possible imo. And the others will be part of his team. As a lawyer. I respect her intelligence and ability. Joe needs a fighter. He will unite Dems and have a great cabinet. Trump can win only by cheating. And he will try.
The bussing comments made by Biden against Harris in the debate were overstated. Bussing was never a great solution to a big problem. But it also allowed many of color here in Detroit to get to better schools and many from poor neighborhoods. In retrospect. It was a disaster.
My favorite part of Biden selecting Kamala as VP is watching lefty twitter meltdown.  Bruh, y'all shot your shot when Biden won the nomination. Y'all already said you weren't voting for him.  But enjoy all those likes and retweets from the "Kamala is a cop" crowd.
Anyone else feel like Biden just shot himself in the foot by picking Kamala? :/
I have stayed out of the frey. But I believe this is a great choice. She can take on Trump and Pence and Mitch. Trump can‚Äôt attack too hard. She knows the law and how to take on Trump. Biden may have Warren at Treasury. Those tax returns. Schiff as AG. Abrams at HEW.
Newt you are 100% correct that Biden desparetely needs to shore up his support in the black community, although not the first to notice it.
Welp, the far left and the far right hate the pick, so Biden must have made the correct choice.
Clinton had the most progressive platform of any GE candidate ever. It wasn't left enough for some. So Biden, some1 more moderate than Clinton, won this time. He's made the same concessions to the left (maybe more). If he loses, u think we're going to get some1 more left in 2024?
No. Portland is a niche issue on Twitter and people who watch Fox News. They are already voting for Trump. Portland isn't going to swing anyone towards or away from Biden. It's silly.  These polls are stable and what little movement they have is within their own margins of error.

Nobody including Joe Biden cares what this guy thinks
If that's a criticism, then Biden couldn't raise his kids properly.
I wonder if Trump is jealous of the VP process Biden is going through. Biden will be the decider.   Trump was definitely forced to have Pence more than he wants to admit.
This is absolutely true. Trump needs to leave office, but Biden keeps doing horrible things like this since he feels entitled to votes at this point.

I suspect this as well. I think Biden made up his mind a few weeks ago but wants to wait as long as possible in order to shorten the bullshit attack season as much as he can. Plus, Obama didn't announce *him* as his running mate until *August 23rd* 2008 anyway.
The backlash wouldn‚Äôt be as bad now given a) the lawsuit, b) expanded subsidies and c) ten years later I think more people understand it‚Äôs purpose than did at the time...but I just don‚Äôt see it happening. Biden said he wants to do so but I don‚Äôt see that in his healthcare plan...

the offense. Explain in simple terms what this payroll deduction scheme is to the People. Tell them they may lose their healthcare and social security. Do it in one or two sentences. Have Biden‚Äôs surrogates on the road every day. All these great plans don't mean a damn thing ifhas a broad brush list of her being a corrupt shitbag.

Thank God. Imagine the relief of getting to protect the Senator or VP Biden instead of the grifter family.
A Biden/Harris ticket is not awesome if you want true progress as a Democrat. Neither of them have shown commitment towards the popular progressive policies the people actually want. They‚Äôre better than Trump... but many people ‚Äúdon‚Äôt like it but will support it anyway‚Äù.
Joe Biden is receiving briefings now. Thank goodness there‚Äôs an adult hearing the important things. üò≥
Biden VP pick Harris promoted group that put up bail for alleged violent criminals
The right was going to attack whoever Biden picked as ‚Äúthe most liberal VP pick of all times!!!!!‚Äù However, their attacks on  reveal just how racist and misogynistic they are as a collective group.
I cannot WAIT til Biden and kamala release all those kids from cages and TEAR DOWN YOUR WALL!!! üòÖü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Was good til I woke up and saw Trump tweet that Biden kid racist PLEASE! This from a KKK family
you're right, it doesn't make any sense for Hitler to be Biden's VP. whoever suggested such a hypothetical must be a real bologna head.
#KamalaHarris Ultimately will be President if Biden wins, and I just don't think she is up to the task. Her policies would greatly hurt the economy in a time of crisis and she would further add to the political division in the nation.
Great! Biden needed someone more liberal on the ticket. That‚Äôs an awesome endorsement!
Should been you. So we can get Michigan back on track. Hate both biden and trump. We are all screwed in this election.

I was reading on there that there are tons of trump signs up all over and barely any Biden signs, so that must mean no one is supporting Biden. I was going to respibd tgat Biden supporters don't need trashy signs plastered all over their places, but i didnt want their responses
You mean Biden right? Whatever Dems accuse you of they're doing. And criminal fugitive?????
Did he just endorse Joe Biden?
It‚Äôs hard living with Obama democrat parents who believe slightly better than Trump is progress. That‚Äôs why they subscribe to the joe biden landslide victory equals progress
#NewsConference has started, with the prez discussing the economic upturn. Addresses China, its support/Biden, its large purchases since the trade deal. More regulation cutting than any admin, more cutting to come. Will still protect the environment &amp; have safety.
Okay, now that I've had time to deal, I need to be transparent and say that I am not just going to vote for Biden-Harris. I am going to make phone calls, drop lit, and be super annoying to every person that I know until Election Day. #LFG
If they think the chaos will suddenly go away (regardless of whether Biden wins,) they are sadly mistaken.  I hope they wake up and realize that Trump is their best defense against the chaos. Biden will just let it spread.
"Biden and I have our disagreements on how to reach our common goal"  "We diverge on the details but he has good intentions"  Any weak platitude would have been better than this.
I'll vote for Biden and everything but yeah...   I especially love the juxtaposition of "tweet less" with the sign that has a hashtag
Amazing to watch the press circle around demands for Biden when Trump won't release his tax returns, visitor lists at the White House, a list who is a paying member of the business he calls a home, or any actual medical records.
Hmm!  Not buying it, but good try.  Oh, I‚Äôm still voting Biden and not third party, but the quote...

Hard to comprehend the number of truly spoiled people who choose to rise-up &amp; resist Gold cuz it's not Platinum! We have Biden &amp; Harris, who at min. are NOT Trump &amp; Pence.  At max, will be the greatest Pres Team ever! (tied w/ Obama &amp; Biden!). Spoiled should stamp feet silently!
Just saw these in an Ann Arbor pet store. It's A2, so not a surprise. But it's not hard to notice the absence of a certain figure.  There's a slim chance they just either bought all of the Biden toys, or like him, they just forgot.  #Trump2020

Took my Mom to Kroger super early &amp; she got into a verbal altercation with a woman she has known for about 40 yrs, in the parking lot, over Trump &amp; the Post Office. U don't know real life until you've see 2 great grandmothers throw down. Joe Biden should hire my Mother. #Saturday

All MAGA are like that and have no idea what;s going on except Hunter Biden and all that bull....
The two people I criticized most at the beginning of this campaign have now become the presidential and vice-presidential nominees. As much as I'd like to see Biden with more progressive ideals, anything is better than Trump so the Biden/Harris ticket has my vote.
So, w/all the talk of the Trump judges. 2020 elex can have big impact on the next judges for the circuit courts  My approach was, any judge born 1960 or before = may flip (tho of course this is hard to measure.)  IOW, almost all circuits could flip in Biden p.1 or Trump p.2
Legs up Biden ridin
CBS All Access is taking all the ad money from the Biden campaign and I am here for it. Literally every single commercial. Binging four or so episodes= seeing that message more than ten times
No one will accept the results of the 2020 election, not just Trump. This election will have the most voter fraud in history. Hell, the Democrats still haven't even accepted the results of the 2016 election. World leaders poke fun at everyone. And Biden isn't a narcissist?
That sounds like you're making a factual statement. Can you back that up? That Biden didn't choose Harris? I would like to see your source.
Join me in supporting Joe Biden!
Get Trump out you won‚Äôt be sorry if you vote for Biden and Kamala our country will be normal and they will get things done for every oneüôèüèΩ
They could get their wish next week when they dump Biden for Clinton.
I've always thought Pelosi's theory of the election is 2020 will resemble 2008, when the bottom fell out of the economy in September. But this September we're more likely to see a pretend vaccine introduced, Barr indicting a Biden or 2 and Dems signing off on checks for everyone.
Joe Biden and the Great Leaders of 2020 Are Part of a Club
Trump is disgraceful trash.   Biden Harris 2020üá∫üá∏
Biden's got his pit bull. This is awesome.
With Harris as Biden's VP pick, and Biden being an aged individual, don't call it too soon!
Biden‚Äôs bugs has a nice ring to it. But I‚Äôm told it is worms that have eaten his brainü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Are we a LAWLESS country? 46 states warned they'll be disenfranchised &amp; their ballots not counted! Trump now asserts Harris is INELIGBLE due 2 parents heritage! Sen.Ron Johnson admits his Russia probe was 2 get negative info on Biden 2 secure Trump win! #Resistance NOW!
So the challenge is to paint Joe Biden as too old but somehow has an e-mail scandal.
I'm sorry if you're upset, but please vote for Biden. We deserve better than a wannabe dictator. Thanks.
Harris‚Äô past position on surgeries was wrong and did serious harm. But she has also done significant good in advocating against ‚Äúpanic‚Äù defenses. Painting the Biden-Harris as anti-trans is misleading.
Also not true. Did the Obama-Biden administration do enough? Absolutely not. But they did put in place better policies in federal prisons. Those policies were rolled back by the Trump administration:
I guess Biden will have to sign an executive order outlawing high capcity magazines. Trump showed us the way to get things done.
appreciates msm positive coverage/deal w/Israel &amp; UAE. Other countries ‚Äúcoming into the deal.‚Äù Brushed off Biden taking credit.POTUS says Obama &amp; Biden did a terrible deal w/Iran that Prez stopped, Biden doesn‚Äôt even know the names/countries prez is in negotiations w/now.
This is a misrepresentation of Biden‚Äôs position and record of action for trans rights:
Trump is the alternative or did I miss something? I have a lot of issues with Biden and Harris but the alternative is far far worse.
Ha  I can't imagine there would be a substantive change in US/Israel policy with a Biden administration.
I like the line ‚Äúyour privilege if not voting for biden is hurting poor people and people of color‚Äù while they bash poor people and people of color for not being enthusiastic about biden and for not voting for biden lol
No questions...no debates. Why bother if you're Biden? Hiding in the basement is working!
look i just think that if joe biden and others can work to destroy the lives of the working class and black people, they deserve people hollering outside their homes 24/7. fuck this "we have to treat these monsters with civility" nonsense
I can honestly see Biden-Harris (assuming they can even manage to win despite this openly proclaimed effort to steal the election) going either way on all these things. their records tell me to be cynical; my hope comes from the tendency of events to overtake politicians
if you want every leftist to vote biden, try to figure out people's thinking rather than placing yourself in some imaginary category of "Adults Who Get Their Hands Dirty" (when all you ever do is sign the occasional check and watch MSNBC while making little tutting noises)
if you look at Biden's and Harris's records, it should be a genuine question for you how many of Trump's actual policies they will discontinue. his *style* will of course be gone overnight. will the tough-on-crime dem and the top cop really shrink ICE?
the cases against voting biden I'm hearing from the left are such above-it-all displays of moral purity as "I survived sexual assault and I believe Tara Reade" and "biden's drug laws killed my relatives." definitely people who are way too comfortable. for sure. great take
I finally can't agree with swing-state voters who won't vote Biden for left reasons, but seeing them demonized by people whose engagement w/politics is just clueless, ahistorical fandom makes me sick
Let‚Äôs face it, everybody knows this is about not electing Joe Biden, it‚Äôs about trying to get Harris to be the next black woman president. He‚Äôs even admitted that he is a transitional candidate.
Op-Ed: If Biden wins, don't expect Trump to accept defeat and head for the exit
So you promise to move to Russia when Biden wins the election? Pinky swear? Don‚Äôt let us down, James!
No one know who they pick when they go into the voting booth. I hope there are some women who are tired of the male BS and vote to Biden/Harris.
kind of disheartening that a good portion of the people i saw bitching about third party voters in 2016 are the same people in 2020 saying ‚Äútell me exactly why i should vote for biden/harris.‚Äù

So your're willing to sacrifice the people that will die from losing their healthcare under Trump? Biden wont do M4A but he also won't try and completely gut the entire system. Medicare will be protected, Medicaid, etc... that's ppls lives you're willing to throw away for "pride"
Biden whipped votes for that war!
"Or, as one former Biden official put it: 'I don‚Äôt think he really cares about what a 30-something Pod Save America host thinks about him, and that honestly might be why he‚Äôs the nominee.'"  Sensibilities like this are why I think Biden has a good shot at winning.
Whether or not I can vote by mail, I will be crawling over broken glass to vote for Biden Nov 3 ‚úåÔ∏è
She says that all Covid deaths are Trump's fault and then says most are...so I'm not sure which it is.   should do the same on his show tonight except for Biden....I mean, there is plenty of material.
I refuse to believe that a 12 year old is volunteering for Biden - my god why!!!
James Woods thinks that America has, at most, another four years to survive because Republicans like Mike Pence and Nikki Haley won‚Äôt defend America, let alone Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. They‚Äôll all just leave America to the wolves. Trump alone is the last defender. Bye America
You don‚Äôt have to support Biden. You should still vote for him because leftists need to infiltrate the DNC as opposed to being outsiders to the party.  did a video today and made the same arguments.
How Biden could Turn it all around in Two weeks if he Wins
I‚Äôve got my own negative feelings towards Biden but you‚Äôre correct to here to professional politicians speak was a nice change of pace
It would be harious to watch Biden introduce himself 15 times to foreign leaders because worms have eaten his brain and taken his short term memory.
Hi Gaby! I'm very behind on the JBU podcasts, but I'm investing time to catch up! You shared a powerful quote from Angela Davis on the episode where you and Alison's TOPIXXXX was Joe Biden a few weeks back. Can you share that quote with me by chance? Thanks. &lt;3 xx
At least Kamala Harris did not insult Biden's wife or his father. Ted Cruz is not more forgiving than Biden nor is he more desperate.
No, Biden isn‚Äôt great, but I‚Äôm over my disappointment. He‚Äôs a transitional figure and his campaign all but openly acknowledges it. He‚Äôs the next step that moves us forward - why is this so hard to understand??
TRUMP is a disgrace. He lies, cheats, manipulates, and doesn't give a shit about anyone unless it benefits him. All the business owners I know are voting for Biden.
When people tell me that I have to vote for Joe Biden.
When I‚Äôve gotten into it with them, it‚Äôs their privilege that shows. One guy‚Äôs line in the sand was that Biden wouldn‚Äôt give him free healthcare (I don‚Äôt even know that to be true tbh). I want healthcare, and decisive action on climate change, and a drastic reduction in military
This is on my mind again after hearing Biden raised $48 million in the last two days   When you can raise $$$ like that so fast it feels like the trade offs of investing in more expensive states like TX lessen
Gretchen Whitmer and Michiganders KNOW  that to be false. #FascistTrump #TrumpIsATraitor  # Vote for Joe Biden
Liberals think Biden is the compromise, while for many leftists, Bernie was the compromise.
they seem as afraid of kamala as they were/are of biden.
Flo should have been Biden's VICE PRESIDENT pick.
Guess I'm not voting for Biden now because he's running mate isn't AOC. Thanks Whit.
Now Kamala is ridden w/Biden, racist's are salivating. Saying Kamala's parents weren't US Citizens (SHE was born in US). How do they explain many of our early Pres w/parents born b4 America! (English subjects) They were White? Oh! Now I get it! #resist
There‚Äôs a new Republican talking point in town, and it ‚Äúargues‚Äù that Biden is a pushover that will not be able to contain the growing progressive calls for change. If only this were true...‚ù§Ô∏è #JoeBiden #trumpPressBriefing
You fool! It's Biden. Biden is the cadaver. Biden you have to clap to make sure he's still awake.
Ah. Well in that case, you could make the argument that Indiana‚Äôs voting Trump either way and your presidential vote doesn‚Äôt matter.  Although this year in particular, an overall popular vote number for Biden will matter in arguing against Trump trying to delegitimize the result.
What state are you in?   If it‚Äôs purple, you can do one of those third party vote swapping deals where someone in safely blue states votes your favorite third party while you vote Biden for them.
Just realized that this is broken lol. It works to for seeing if Trump wins the state but not for Biden
This is a super interesting and in depth article
The world will be celebrating that we have a sane man as our president once Joe Biden
He's grotesque, but he doesn't look like a stiff the way Biden does. I swear Sleepy Joe smells of mothballs and has a broomstick up his back to keep him from falling over.
He will be calling Biden Willie Brown by the beginning of fall.
I feel like 10% of all posts I see are berating people who don‚Äôt want to vote for Biden!
Yeah, if Biden is elected he‚Äôs going to let it spread all over the US
Hi you can complain about Biden/Harris all you want but if you claim to support progressive policy and still vote third party or abstain you're a dumbass. üíú
This makes me want to buy a Biden hat
It‚Äôs going to be so much fun watching Trump work to respond to every last ‚Äúslight‚Äù that Biden and Harris are going to be offering between now &amp; Election Day. He‚Äôs going to exhaust himself, Twitter might explode!

Looks like the Civitas poll pushed North Carolina to jjjuussstttt barely on Biden's side on 538
How much does Father Time Biden pay someone to tweet  for him all day?
Biden is gaffe galore and to an extent thinks in old ways. But it is extremely unfair to say he "becomes less likable every time he opens his mouth."  He is genuinely empathetic, and sensible. All low bars but they count for something.
He is going to eat Biden for breakfast and s*** him out.
Or Biden should just man up and debate like every other presidential candidate has done for the history of the United States. Why does he have to have conditions, or special circumstances?  His lying is more notorious than Trump's.
YEAH and honestly, while I'm going to vote, I can't blame others for choosing to not vote, since the rhetoric has been "yeah biden and harris worked to destroy your lives and community, and promise to do the same if elected, but shut up and fall in line because ~harm reduction~"
But has he funded his Billions to the Biden Campaign to help win the Election?  Hope so, its been Crickets from Bloomberg, since he dropped out of the Primary race.
Am I crazy about a Biden/Harris ticket No. Will I fight sexist and racist attacks against Kamala at every given opportunity? You bet.
I‚Äôm in Michigan and can confirm that our swing state with Biden up 6-8% in polls is very much under attack.
Democratic National Convention starts Monday, 8/17. The Dems can't seriously be happy with Biden and Harris. Look for a switcheroo and Hillary gets another shot. She's their best choice at beating the Donald. Market volatility / start of election sell off commence.

Legit question: from the only quote in the oped from Sen. Harris, it seems like the accusers she said she believed were the ones that Joe Biden himself apologized too, for uncomfortable touching and personal space violations. Good on Harris for calling him out. What‚Äôs the story?
Holy fuck listen to Biden #cornpop
BS!  She is extremely close to Trump and she knows what Barr and Giuliani have trumped up on Biden. They have been working overtime making up false claims. She let it slip and Dems need to know not to believe anything that Repubs thrown at the Dems.

Whitmer is still likely to play a big role in the upcoming campaign, as one of the co-chairs for Biden‚Äôs national campaign. She's already stumped for him and is slated to speak at the DNC next Monday.
Gray said some progressives see Harris‚Äô past job as a prosecutor and Biden‚Äôs role in a major 1994 crime bill as antithetical to the marches for police reform happening around the country.
With Whitmer staying put as Michigan's governor, what does a Biden/Harris ticket mean for the state?  correspondent  joined Stateside to talk about the road ahead.
The ‚Äúveepstakes‚Äù are over and #KamalaHarris is the presumptive Democratic Vice Presidential nominee. For months, Michigan‚Äôs own Governor Gretchen Whitmer seemed to be on the shortlist for Joe Biden's running mate.
Since Biden raised $15.2M in Q3 2019, and then $26 million in 24 hours just now, I think that means fundraising has gone up by *moves beads on abacus* FIFTEEN THOUSAND PERCENT!

.  who is actually a cop, is another fierce Black woman who was high on the VP list. I‚Äôm really not sure who the roses would have been happy with as VP. Besides Bernie, who is older than Biden and completely defeated the purpose of a VP for a septuagenarian
Biden: nobody is excited about him, nobody asked for him, but there he is and I guess this is our only option. Congrats Joe, you‚Äôre the Sbarro of candidates.
whether your voting for Biden or not, idrc either way, anyone who wants the Dems to be social democratic party needs to realize that excising the donor class from power is an absolutely necessary step to achieving that goal
COVID and the material conditions of the moment will probably push Biden to do some marginally good things (Enhanced UI, stimulus checks, etc.) but all these fucking jackals in the article below will work there ass off to make sure the measures are only temporary
WTF is Pirro talking about? Something's going to happen (to Biden)? What is going to happen? Is that a threat?
Heard a couple of minutes of Trump presser before rapidly turning off the TV in disgust (I try to avoid them at all costs) and he said ‚ÄúBiden and his new running mate Kamala‚Äù a) I could hear the fear in his voice and b) it‚Äôs Senator Harris to you #BidenHarris2020
They believe you should cheer for biden and shut up so u don‚Äôt help trump lmao u can‚Äôt win with the libs lmao
My euphoria over watching Biden-Harris was short-lived. :-(
The ‚Äújoe biden is near death and cannot possibly serve a full term in office without dying‚Äù is something I hear enough from people anecdotally that I‚Äôm not going to laugh this off as fox BS, because it has obviously gotten through to people and could maybe work
Everything communicates.  Between the two campaigns' grassroots efforts via text, there's a stark difference.   Trump's is "Text TRUMP to 88022."  Biden's is "Text UNITED to 30330."  One is inwardly focused on the individual.ü§°  The other is outwardly focused on uniting us. üá∫üá∏

Great speeches by both Biden and Harris ! Perfection. Great team !  I‚Äôm in to work on this campaign !!!
After being here for a week and a half, I'm not letting my parents just say shit like Biden is a radical leftist or our problem is people want McDonald's to be a career and starting to ask questions and follow them to their root assumptions. A lot of conversations abruptly stop.
If we had a president who embraced masks and social distancing in early May the way Joe Biden did, Herman Cain wouldn't be dead.
The way to visualize this for gamers is that Biden wins on a success of 1d20 unmodified vs DC 6. Plenty of tabletop gamers know how often you roll a 6 or under, especially when it counts. So don't forget to vote! It lowers the DC (to get the swamp troll out of DC).
I trust Biden in a Basement over Trump in a Bunker

Biden: during the vetting process, I met with a lot of women and ‚ÄúEach of them was qualified to be president.‚Äù This was his criterion.
My basic thought: we can continue to be critical of Harris‚Äô complicated record, push HARD on this Biden/Harris ticket and admin, and value the power of the people and mass social movements over electoral politics... (1/2)
Watching VP Biden swear in new senators was must-see TV in the Capitol.
he‚Äôs created¬†roughly $7 trillion¬†(one-third of the¬†entire nation‚Äôs normal annual GDP) out of thin air and used much of that money to buy corporate stock and bonds to keep the stock market afloat. In its 107-year history, the¬†Fed has never,ever done this

My social media feeds are so much more tame now that Biden has made Kamala official.   This is what it's supposed to be like. You elect officials so that you don't have to worry about politics every frikin minute of the day.
It's the "Biden/Lady with nails on chalkboard voice " ticket ladies and gentlemen!
I wish people could just agree to disagree on the simple fact that we simply just need Trump out of office and that is the FIRST step. Joe Biden is not my first pick nor would Kamala Harris, however what I do know is that in the bigger picture Trump needs to be gone.
No. This election is too consequential to throw away your vote on a third party candidate. We can survive 4 years of Joe Biden. Donald Trump will be even more unhinged and volatile if elected again.
Their the same thing. The libs will lye about  their China slurpee flew numbers to get Biden elected

2016 Bernie was railroaded by the DNC, but this time he had a ton of money and was supposed to have a ton of support. Guess what, young people suck as a voting block. Older people vote and they chose Biden for us.
Who‚Äôs you guys. I voted for Warren both times during the primaries. If you think that Biden will be worse than Trump you‚Äôre a ducking moron and are helping the same people you pretend to fight. There are no other parties. None. There is no Green Party or whatever.
There are two parts to this argument. Is there a net positive to having Biden over trump (I think the answer is clearly yes), and can anyone claim that it is immoral to support a lesser evil. I think the answer to the second question is no, but if you care about minimizing pain,
‚ÄúI believe Joe Biden‚Äôs accusers... unless he‚Äôs gonna give me that VP position I‚Äôm so desperate for in which case, fuck those women!‚Äù
‚ÄúKamala is the most progressive VP selection ever!‚Äù Ok, but on a progressive scale of 1-10 she‚Äôs like a 3.5. That‚Äôs a really low fucking bar. How low do your standards as a human being have to be to view a Biden-Harris ticket as even remotely acceptable?
We could‚Äôve had a Bernie Sanders-Nina Turner ticket in 2020, instead there‚Äôs motherfuckers out here acting, with a straight face, like we should be happy, or even satisfied, with... Joe Biden and Kamala Harris? Get the fuck out of here and take both of these assholes with you

When I was a child, I called my friends "dodo head" or something like that, because I didn't have a good response.This isThat! *I've been watching a ad in Mi. against Biden from 1987. No joke! Because it's all they have."Dodo head". hahaha yeah! 33 yrs ago.

kamala is a joke. biden is a joke. trump is even bigger joke. so we all should vote for Biden by default.
Calma. Sir Allan Lichtman  has called it for Biden.
Wtf now we know joe biden and kamala Harris has contempt for both millennials and Gen Z.
A deeply flawed candidate indeed but he represents the party that is making the best effort to represent the powerless. It would be an easier call to not vote Biden if the other side wasn‚Äôt even more ignorant and further passing law to stop wealth redistribution
This video made me feel things I haven't felt since pre-2016 Hillary heartbreak and I'm very excited to vote for the Biden/Harris ticket. #returntodecency
Biden climate action plan ambitious.  Big needed focus on justice. 100% carbon-free electricity grid by 2035. Really important. Unfortunately, carbon capture w sequestration unlikely to be a winner. Goal is to get off fossil fuels, AND create lots of jobs.
üíØ. Plan on voting for as many progressive candidates as I can. Also plan on voting for Biden/Harris. We can do both. Small steps. Giant leaps are a fools errand. Just look at the GOP response to Obama, who was not a progressive by any means.
I‚Äôll vote against my will for Biden/Harris (our ONLY option) because we literally will not survive another 4 years with this cabinet and its members who act only in the interest of the president.
I don‚Äôt want to vote for Biden/Harris either, and at the moment I barely feel like I can, but I can‚Äôt not vote when there are huge opportunities to fix the House and Senate. Vote for congresspeople who will push for change the executive office won‚Äôt.
I have mixed feelings about #BidenHarris2020. But I do recognize that we cant fight for Black futures w/o livable Black communities. Environmental justice is racial justice. Climate justice is racial justice. So #BidenHarris have my vote. And we push.
If Australian main stream media is anything like the US (liberal left ‚Äúprogressives‚Äù) and you believe your media then you think Biden will win in an historic landslide. In reality where most of us live, Trump stomps Biden.

Perfect. You may not like Biden or Harris, but your protest vote isn‚Äôt going to help right now. Which is exactly when we need help.
The people stand with Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris! Americans demand true leadership, not liars and cheats. #VoteBlue #VoteForJoe #Joementum #Kamala!
Biden up 17 points with voters aged 65+? Guess the GOP should‚Äôve avoided all that messaging where seniors should sacrifice themselves to reopen the economy.
Is this an anti-Biden post?
I don't know why everyone is acting like Kamala Harris isn't exactly what is expected of the Biden campaign. Biden is a centrist at best and he's looking to win the Republican vote. You're out here acting like he's some socialist savior when really he's further right than Obama
Kamala Harris is officially Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate. Michigan supporters say it‚Äôs about time.
Biden touches children in public WAY more than Trump. You have one example I have 20. I'm voting third party. Democrats threw the election.
Does this make Biden even more Catholic?
Just ordered $250 worth of Biden/Harris face masks to give as gifts to my closest African American female friends. Put it all on my little credit card but just applied for a second job so it‚Äôs worth it. As a woman and a mother I‚Äôm so excited for this historic moment!
And that‚Äôs one reason why people should vote for that ticket. Complaining about her her stance on Palestine, criminal justice, etc is supposedly one way to keep them from pandering to Republicans (tho all the BLM protests amounted to Biden saying we should up funding for police?)
6. Look, I know how much this sucks, our political system is fucked &amp; I share all your issues about Biden, but abandoning the political process doesn‚Äôt absolve you of your responsibilities, it just makes everyone around you do more work with the limited tools at their disposal
4. Biden can create a cabinet that is more progressive than he is, he can overturn every racist EO 45 every signed, he can appoint hundreds of women &amp; PoC judges into the federal court system, we‚Äôre talking lifetime appointments here in this flawed judicial system
2. it‚Äôs simultaneously true that Biden is awful but still much better than Trump (it‚Äôs a false equivalency to say they‚Äôre both the same, they‚Äôre not): one will have a black/Asian VP, put progressives in the  defend ACA, put qualified women &amp; PoC into their cabinet,
1. being a global citizen means participating in civic institutions because your vote has global repercussions, so it‚Äôs not vote or protest/organize, it‚Äôs vote AND organize/protest, let‚Äôs hold Biden accountable &amp; build off these protests
here‚Äôs my pitch for voting in the GE even if, like me, you voted for Bernie &amp; you really dislike Biden (a thread)

Michigan here...Yet to see a Biden sign.
I would much rather vote for Howie than Biden.  At the same time - I want to try and build solidarity with progressive Dems who are skeptical of 3rd party voters and the "far left" in general.  Indie voters need to organize precinct by voting precinct and do exit polls.
Lol. Okay!  Biden smeared Anita Hill for Thomas and then... didn't vote for him? So much better.  As for Scalia - being a respected jurist does not mean we want Democrats to nominate or approve right-wing conservative justices.
(granted the DNC is corrupt)  but think about how many trump signs you see vs biden or even bernie signs...  conservatives *blindly* scream loudler.... maybe we should learn that lesson
These people need to start looking at Biden's actual platform. Obama ran further to the right.
She's right. I'm dumb. I stewed before donating to Lincoln Project. I'm sick that I did.  I don't know how to reconcile this with my absolute belief that Trump will be reelected. I don't believe "progressives" will show up for Biden/Harris, but I'm convinced anti-Trump Rs will.
Gosh, I am frequently shocked and occasionally appalled by  comments on  but ‚Äúidiot‚Äù is not a word I would use to describe him. On the other hand, ‚Äúsenile‚Äù is a word I would use to describe Mr. Biden. Sorry if my opinion, which this is, upsets anyone.
Then... *my fears are* (fraudulent) evidence is presented linking Obama/Biden to attempting to "sabotage" the election, indicating them for "treason"...
"I'm Joe Biden and I approve this message".
You talking about someone looking strong and is ready to go to work? JOE BIDEN!! #BidenHarris2020
If you mean covid, that falls apart with the reality Biden can barely function and Harris couldn't even keep the LAPD in check, so I doubt she could keep a pandemic in check. Outside of that, you're wrong. Thanks for playing
That's what's weird. I haven't voted GOP since I don't remember when (I'm old) but only Trump is slamming my inboxes. Where is Biden's campaign? Where will this "landslide" come from if their campaign doesn't lift a finger out in the streets?
"...Biden's choice decision to choose " is very GOP.
A shout out to all the #vbnmw people for continually reminding me that any vote other than a vote for #biden is in fact a vote for #trump !  Gee I never realized this!  I don‚Äôt know how I can ever repay you for your incredible insight!!
I have, I follow it every day.  It means my life and well being.  Trump and his administration has been extremely detrimental to trans people.  Most recently, the trans gender health protections.  So much more malicious than what biden will do.
I do not agree. Biden is stronger than you think, and is backed by stronger people still.
You might want to update the headline on that June story instead of just adding an editor's note to it:
Why the hell would Biden do this? Trump sinks deeper by talking because he's an incoherent, lying, narcissist. Biden would be foolish to help Trump.
Vote Biden/Harris, the rest will follow. There are ways to vote absentee or ‚Äúmail-in‚Äù in most states without actually having to use USPS. In-person pick-up and drop-off ballots are county clerk or elections offices.
But neither obama or biden want to remove trans rights.  The damage trump did to me and other trans people has been way worse than anything obama did.  And do you really think biden's picks for the SC will vote to remove abortion rights?  Trumps will.
Especially you still trying to decide if you are gonna vote Biden
He would veto Medicare for all but trump is worse so I‚Äôm voting for Biden but I won‚Äôt tell people biden is great because I don‚Äôt think that is true.
I think Biden is terrible but trump is an existential threat so I‚Äôm settling for Biden.
When, and if, Biden debates, it will be all over.

Kanye is Trumps and Kushners house N-word. Do you really think they are persuading him to run so West can win? Of course not...run house N-word, draw votes from Biden-Harris and watch Trump continue to decimate Black and Brown communities that he has done virtually nothing for.

No, it's not over the top of you understand history and frankly I grew up when a worst president was given two terms. And my apparent goals keep getting destroyed by people like Biden &amp; harris
Biden used a small vetting team to help decide his VP pick.
And THAT is only going to help Biden/Kamala. Your vote would be wasted. Please don't do that with November's vote!
Yeah, they found the DA had done NOTHING WRONG except the fact he was investigating the company where Biden's son worked. He was NOT CORRUPT like Joe had stated he was!
See what President Trump's son, Eric says about Biden's pick for VP.
At least a Biden Cabinet will reflect what America is, not who look and act like Trump. Competent people.
I am truly concerned this is a small step and foreshadowing to potential attempts at Obama/Biden indictments. The concurrent and impending corruption from this Administration just kills.
Biden didn‚Äôt pick anything. He can‚Äôt form coherent sentences.

Not voting for trump, Biden or Hillary once in my life will be something I brag to my grandchildren about
Campaigns usually preview their priority for major legislation, as Obama did with stimulus &amp; ACA. But Biden has been mostly negative &amp; event responsive so far (now mostly focused on COVID &amp; economy), so unclear how that would translate beyond whatever doesn‚Äôt pass from HEROES

Sexist and racist????? Uhm didn't you dumbocrats openly pick the senator because of gender and race???? The associated press reported Gov. Whitmer even suggested to Biden that he should pick a black woman. So who is being sexist and racist again? The hippocracy is overflowing.
Jim Clyburn‚Äôs endorsement swung the SC vote totals emphatically enough to make Biden the frontrunner‚Äîand eventually, the nominee.   Biden bet his whole race on that. Bernie crossed his fingers and hoped enough leftists would turn out nationwide that it wouldn‚Äôt make a difference.
Warren‚Äôs polices were much better than Bernie‚Äôs and she got called a snake. The platform Biden‚Äôs eventually going to run with will have a lot of important planks‚Äîmany out there by Sanders and Warren staffers.  If leftists call it ‚Äúshit‚Äù and don‚Äôt vote? Just makes change harder.
Joe Biden is not ‚Äúextremely conservative‚Äù lol
They want him removed because he has outlived his usefulness to them. They got their judges, now they want to discard trump and find a candidate that might have a chance to beat Biden. They just have to find someone who is just as big a tool as trump, without a side of dementia.

I think 2016 is a much better example of Bernie being cheated. This primary election, the moderate candidates simply consolidated behind Biden before Super Tuesday and the moderates outnumbered the progressives within the party
ahhh okay I misunderstood a tiny bit there. Yeah its weird that people will broadly support policies M4A (58% of primary voters in SC supported it but the state went for Biden for example) and I'd be interested in understanding why that disparity exists
I agree with all of these things as well. Im voting Biden because I think we have the best shot of getting those things under that administration and not our current one. But it's also true that a lot of Americans ARE very moderate and this ticket reflects that.
also some people dont look at policy for voting unfortunately. People recognize Biden from the Obama administration and want to return to an era of "stability", rather than pressing forward into unknown territory (socialistic policies) because they want to maintain their comfort
but the primaries are the opportunity for people to express this type of support. In Michigan, Biden won EVERY COUNTY. This is due to low voter turnout from our age bracket (18-28 voter turnout is 16%) skewing the country further right/moderate than what it should/could be.
Who I think Biden will pick for his cabinet IF he wins:  1. Secretary of State: Susan Rice 2. Secretary of the Treasury: Elizabeth Warren 3. Secretary of Defense: Pete Buttigieg 4. Attorney General: Val Demmings 5. Secretary of the Interior: Jamie Rappaport Clark
Trump organizers are knocking on doors and holding in-person events in Michigan, but  told me today Democrats don't feel its "practical or smart" to do the same for  just yet.
precisely. I just think it'll take a bit more time for the American populace to be "primed" for a socialistic/social democrat political leaning/president/etc. I can't be mad about Biden/Kamala because imo its much closer to reflecting the majority of Americans and their leanings
So we all know Trumps a POS...  and Biden‚Äôs held office for 40+ years and hasn‚Äôt created any type of change...  how did we get to this point again of voting for what YOU believe is to be the ‚Äúlesser of two evils‚Äù VOTE THIRD PARTY #Joforpresident
Despite the OBVIOUSLY BULLSHIT that prisons have stocks and therefore are used for profit by pure common sense economics... It should worry people that we can‚Äôt let the Biden administration get away with this shit if he wins either. We are settling for Biden but we can‚Äôt leave 1/
Public university grads can do anything - including run for President, Vice President, and Governor.

As a real Christian, I'm offended that you are attacking Biden (Catholic) &amp; Harris (Baptist) as if your White Evangelical/Gnostic/Judaizer cult is of Jesus Christ. It's not &amp; you aren't of Christ. You don't support life as you support the Trump demonic leadership reign
They‚Äôre serving the broader coalition, which is necessary not only to enact progressive policy to defeat the literal actual fascism staring us in the face.   I think Biden‚Äôs a poor candidate, &amp; his nomination is a failure of the party. But I‚Äôd like there to be a 2024 election, so
Joe Biden just said yesterday Trump is causing chaos in the world   Today Trump announces peace in the Middle East

Right, was there another way?  Pirro did NOT say Biden would be dead.
MSU PLS Professor Matt Grossmann discussed the selection of Sen. Kamala Harris as VP candidate on NPR this week. Listen here:  #YesPLS #MSUSocialScience
Rs reacted to Biden‚Äôs VP announcement by criticizing Whitmer's 'audition' during the pandemic, high unemployment; Ds laughed off criticism, saying it's refreshing for Mich. voters to see their leaders in the national spotlight for positive reasons following Flint's water crisis
"...the dauntless 'woman from Michigan,' Gretchen Whitmer (Michigan State, ‚Äô93), who thinks like a general, looks like a ‚Äô40s film star and talks like she‚Äôs ice fishing for muskie."
. spent a day with the Trump campaign in Midland County, observing how the campaign is meeting voters at their doorstep during a pandemic.
Whitmer's quick rise to national stage - &amp; Biden‚Äôs VP list - leaves Democrats happy she will remain governor, excited for future; it could open door to new donors for her 2022 reelection bid &amp; the battle for control of the Legislature
Me: ‚ÄúDress up like June Cleaver and commence vacuuming.‚Äù   ‚ÄúPiss off, Timmer. I‚Äôm voting for Biden.‚Äù
.  raised $26 million for his presidential campaign in the 24 hours that followed his announcement that California Sen.  would be his running mate.
Did you think racist Biden would pick an African/American....Kam(comi)la's daddy's ancestor owned slaves
Views of Harris are unlikely to move voters or voter blocs, but could change impressions of Biden; prior running mates have had minimal &amp; fleeting top-line effects but have changed or mollified voters‚Äô concerns about presidential candidates
Kamala Harris is a disgusting enabler.
It's pretty self explanatory to ANYBODY paying actual attention that Biden can barely string together a coherent sentence
She didn't threaten him. U ppl R freakin idiots. Do you have a thought of your own? ITS ABOUT BIDENS MENTAL DECLINE that Democrats will replace Biden with Harris &amp; he won't be on the ticket anymore. She did sleep her way 2 the top so it's not unlikely
It's supposed to be a clown train with Biden driving the clown train
#Resist #Election2020 #politics #Democrats2020 #Dump45 #Resistance #Elections2020 The 2020 phrase that should be banned already: ‚Äúprogressive enough.‚Äù It is diversionary and divisive. We support Biden/Harris, enthusiastically, because it is the right thing to do for our country.
I‚Äôm voting for Biden only because trump is an existential threat to our democracy but he needs to support Medicare for all. He said he would veto it should it ever come to his desk. Biden sucks but trump is obviously worse so I‚Äôm settling for Biden #settlingforbiden
Harris is the first Black woman on a major party's presidential ticket, and she and Biden noted the historical significance.
Do you think liberals will learn anything about electability when leftists don't vote for Biden in droves?
And you think that‚Äôs Biden?
Voting for Biden and Kamala just because they‚Äôre not Trump shows more problems of the Democratic Party than the Republican Party.

Biden is Catholic. I believe you‚Äôre commenting on your own lack of tolerance for those who don‚Äôt share your beliefs.
For many Black women, Sen. Kamala Harris' selection as Joe Biden's running mate represents a full-circle moment after fighting for generations to have their voices heard and political aspirations recognized.
Biden‚Äôs vulnerability there is by _far_ his greatest strength as a candidate. I want a male leader willing to have those types of emotions on public display. ‚ÄúManliness‚Äù as a construct in its current form needs to be buried forever.
According to a business I frequent once a week,  opinion was, won't vote TRUMP 2020. NEVER VOTE FOR BIDEN. It's Kanye or not vote for President. Just keep that vote untouched. Exactly, what GOP WANTS! THREE candidate mess splitting ticket again like past with Perot.
Biden and Kamala showcase the worthlessness of their opinions and accusations.  Haven‚Äôt they devalued accusations of sexual assault, racism, and bad policing?   Politicians need to be more honest and righteous.
I googled antifa and no references to Biden came up.  What do you do with lying reporters asking lying questions to a lying president?
He's also supporting Biden,  so... He been a dip stick fur the left for years.
Trump has no idea how to even turn on a computer. He‚Äôs just jealous that Biden can make the ‚Äúmagic box‚Äù do things!
True... but if Two Supreme Court Justices are tapped to  say ‚ÄúSTEP DOWN‚Äù because they were wrongfully put there that also could be a great choice after Biden places a Black Woman on the bench!

Only TWO people died of Ebola pandemic under Obama/Biden in America, compared to over 166,000 deaths of COVID-19 under   #FailedLeadership
Joe Biden is so much better than Trump it's hard to believe they're of the same species
Flashback: Kamala Harris women accusing  'I believe them, and I respect them being able to tell their story and having the courage to do it' To Kanamla:  Should Biden Run? ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs going to have to make that decision for himself, I wouldn‚Äôt tell him what to do.‚Äù Now his VP?
If you think Biden‚Äôs gonna try a Muslim ban, appoint conservative SCOTUS judges, invite foreign interference in our elections, gut the USPS, undermine NATO, build a wall, AND try to race-bait his way out of a pandemic, by all means don‚Äôt vote for him.
I'll bet you Jim Acosta &amp;  won't run one story with all the facts of what Kamala Harris said about Joe Biden during the debates? How she believed Bidens accusers, and now she doesn't? Yet she stated she believed Brett Kavanaghs accusers even after the FBI said no.
It's August 12th, day after Biden said "no" maybe made an offer to handle national ROADS as nuttin here yet!
But have either Trump or Biden stated how they would plan on punishing the Houston Astros?
You sound pathetic. It‚Äôs okay that Black woman have voted for white men and women for years whether they liked it or not. You hate to see that FINALLY we have a great pick in #BidenHarris like we had in Obama/Biden years ago. Sorry, we are not sorry! Get over it! #KamalaHarris
Your Suburb or Your Roads: Biden Will Do in One or the Other
.  recommended  pick Black woman for VP slot
Dems probably won‚Äôt get control of the Senate and Biden is moderate, so not much to worry about unless he... you know... (78 years old man)
As a suburban woman I‚Äôm sorry to tell you that I never went through with the wedding ceremony with my house. My partner and I (he was a life long Republican) will both be voting Biden/Harris in any event, so it‚Äôs not an issue.
I really think the Biden campaign is tone-deaf af, not necessarily malicious, because it feels like they‚Äôre pandering to Obama-era nostalgia that many democrats feel. I mean Biden only felt emboldened to run because of his relationship to Obama
A video has been released that appears to show the moment former vice president  asked Sen.  to be his running mate.
Reason 83 to vote Democrat: The third of Job Biden's plans to Build Back Better is to make child and parental care possible without devastating the long term finances of a family.
Trump is running ads on crime (79% of ads) &amp; protests/riots (31% of ads); Biden is running more diverse ads, focused most on COVID (69%) &amp; the economy (60%). Trump is only 12% positive vs. Biden 64% positive.
There's no defending her!! she comes from slave owners her family has benefited from the oppression of the African American and Jamaican people!!   she is still a slave driver She put them all in forced labor prison And so did Joe Biden  Research and wake the hell up
Nope. You frauds can try and sidestep the debates however you want, you know the president will knock Biden's dick in the dirt.
Can someone find me statistics on people who voted for Trump in 2016 but are voting Biden this year, vs people who voted for Hillary in 2016 but are voting for Trump this year? I‚Äôm willing to bet the latter can be counted in one hand while the former is in the thousands or more.
Choosing a non-centrist running mate is a departure for Democrats. But Biden &amp; Harris match a public that is more symbolically conservative but more liberal on policy. They propose more liberal policies without selling an ideological revolution, running instead on restoration
I know people absolutely hate Biden and Harris but as a gay person please for the love of god vote Trump and Pence out. They have been the absolute worst toward LGBT+ rights, really not a debate.
I'd be more scared that they have a HIGHER AA percentage then anywhere else since she incarcerated mostly AA on Weed charges &amp; gave the toughest sentences that Biden's bill was directly responsible 4 &amp; the fact the area is very religious 2. It had ZERO 2 do with Racism. Nada
i feel so split, on the one hand i completely agree that voting for biden/harris will not solve years of generational, systematic oppression (esp when harris is an opp herself!) but i also can‚Äôt stand people acting like it‚Äôs not the only option right now
Ben Shapiro: At this point, Trump is running against Harris not Biden
Biden is the racist üê≤
Not voting for Biden is a vote for trump !!
This does nothing to perpetuate the idea that Biden is unwell. He handled himself with class in the primary debates and the American public deserves to watch him debate Trump.
It has nothing to do with hopeüòÇ there is a ZERO percent chance Betsy DeVos is a part of the next cabinet. There is a 0% chance Trump's postmaster general for the USPS is kept on. There is a 0% chance that Biden would appoint a conservative SCOTUS judge. These aren't guesses....

Hopefully we can push Biden/Harris on this ü§û
Wow. "Suburban Housewife" here. Also, small business owner, active volunteer, liberal voter who would never vote for trump. I am extremely excited to vote for Biden and Kamala Harris.
Niggas gotta go vote Biden then go home and cry themselves to sleep. Hate it here I can‚Äôt wait to dip
Governor Gretchen Whitmer wanted out.
You think majority of white people voting Biden over trump? Lol
It makes me so sad and confused that people r actually voting for Trump or Biden.
That's why trump is surrounded by incompetence and Biden will build an administration that has what's best for the country as its agenda . trump and his cronies are all about what's best for them.
The bottom line here is Trump can‚Äôt be elected president again. The only chance to stop that is voting for the Biden ticket.
All I‚Äôm gonna say is don‚Äôt say shit to black women OR sexual assault survivors for feeling hesitant about voting for Biden. Everybody else is free rein
Maybe to add a little spice in addition to the Biden/Trump and Harris/Pence debate, let‚Äôs have Doug Emhoff debate Karen Pence and Jill Biden debate Melanie Trump.Ever seen a Biden supporter use a dead baby in a jar as a stage prop for a fake religious ceremony campaign video?  Neither have I.

Oh man Joe Biden and Dr. Fauci can both go to Old folks home
Who is the world with Joe Biden becomes president and this Camila they‚Äôre going to ruin the United States of America
The enthusiasm for Donald Trump is absolutely amazing his supporters do all this on their own. I don‚Äôt hear much from Biden except a dumb add where he said he‚Äôs gonna do everything that Trump has already done. He is such an ass.
prosecutors, the American people either never gets the Putin vaccine or it just turns out to be a hoax and the trillions of  $$ to Putin was to let tRump stay in Russia. Epilogue: the Biden administration puts crippling sanctions on Putin and Putin blames tRump and bye bye tRump!
Coming to a whitehouse near you soon JOE BIDEN. Champion of the people bringing law and order to our nation. Stay tuned for the arrests of tRump and his sycophants that have attempted to overthrow our democracy and surpress voting in our country. Prison for them all.
let‚Äôs be real here, Biden only picked Kamala Harris because she smelled better than the other possible candidates. #BidenHarris #KamalaHarrisForVP
But yet this is ok
I think there is enough disaffected progressives/liberals because of the Joe Biden, Kamala Harris ticket who would vote for Trump if he pardoned Edward Snowden.
She would become  a  virtual dictator should she and Biden win. She needs to be defeated at all costs. America will cease to exist should they win. And they don't have a dog's chance as Paul "Mr. Wonderful " Orndorf would say.
Joe Biden is the right guy to coordinate the rehab of our government. I hope he calls on all the living ex-Presidents for council, and expect he will.  He is also the right man to take Trump out behind the woodshed &amp; make sure he faces consequences. 2/5
Is this the right ticket for right now?  Yes. Yes, it is.   Joe Biden is the right man to apologize to our allies for Trump.  He has the right motivations &amp; respect. He is doing this for Beau. And he is doing this for the American people. He has the relationships &amp; sincerity. 1/5
I guess they think we cannot remember (or find) these things... Hey! Whoever is sending Biden's tweets... Please let him know that the internet is forever!
Biden actually did help right the 1994 crime bill. It‚Äôs a valid critique. But at least he now acknowledges the issues of the justice system unlike who we have now. So his statement is bull.
Didn‚Äôt the USPS workers union endorse Biden/Harris?  I‚Äôm sure they will just do their jobs and not be biased in any manner ü•¥
She‚Äôll be the kiss of death to Biden campaign.

Historically vice president were opposites to their president. Really thats all she needs to say of she wants to keep the narrative that there is really any substantial difference between her and biden, or between them and Republicans for that matter. They're the same. Viels off.
Ignore him.  He‚Äôs trying to steal attention away from Biden &amp; Harris.
I'm pressuring Joe Biden to support liberal policies by attacking anyone who criticizes or pressures Joe Biden into supporting liberal policies.
crawl on my hands and knees over broken glass to get to the polls and vote for Biden/Harris.
If you want to see Trump defeated in November, spare a couple of dollars for the Lincoln Project.  Their ads are stronger than anything the Biden campaign dare put out there.
I agree.  A majority in my state decided to change the law to allow all voters to vote by mail if they choose. I am 70 years old and was counting on voting by mail in November. Now, I plan to risk my health to go to the polls to ensure my Biden/Harris vote counts no matter what
Much needed change when Biden and Harris win  the ticket. And there is no longer the likes of people like you wandering the peoples White House halls any more.
I agree with you!  POTUS will win big. I am one of the silent majority but I am building up the courage to put my TRUMP/PENCE sign in my front yard. Just on my street in my small town so many have their signs out. I have not seen one Biden sign.üá∫üá∏
That may be true, but the goal is to keep Biden from being elected. What do we do RIGHT NOW?!
You were the best senator and grilled everyone came in front of you. And you are going to be the best VP after you and Biden win
She's just Biden her time 'til November.
I think Biden-Harris are only "mandating" masks because they have to cover their badly botoxed/cosmetically altered faces until they look "human" again.

Joe Biden that lady can shut their mouth they don‚Äôt have the right to tell people what to do this is not a Third World country we we can do what we want we don‚Äôt have to wear a mask if we don‚Äôt want

Joe Biden will be 78 in November.
During the primaries, Biden and Harris were probably my last 2 choices for who I wanted to get the nominations. I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm a huge fan of the ticket. But you have to be delusional to still be able to turn a blind eye to all the garbage from the other side of the aisle.
Nah. This is a big deal:    This is a bigger deal:
What Trump is doing is wrong wrong wrong.  If mail in voting is made unsafe by this madman, I will crawl over broken glass and risk COVID to vote for Biden/Harris.  Trump will be a one term wrecking ball.
Joe Biden Picks Kamala Harris for VP | Sterling K. Brown #theDailyShowWithTrevorNoahEarsEdition   via
A presidential primary campaign and many hit pieces from leftist breitbart dot com later, and it‚Äôs seen as ‚Äúthe sky is falling‚Äù for progressives when Joe Biden picks Harris has his running mate
I think so also. Both of them have a personality or character flaw that's out to destroy. I remember Biden's debate with Paul Ryan. Biden was vicious &amp; I think Kamala will be like that also. They are the combination that, if elected, will bring down America. Voters remember this.
Pushing the left even farther away with your ‚Äúsuck it up‚Äù and vote for Biden/Harris strategy.
She did not make a threat, she made a statement that isn't too far fetched since Biden is very old &amp; fraile now &amp; can hardly put 2 sentences together.
Hmm ok these are bad policies to back, so I probably wouldn't be a fan of hers or Biden, but I'm going to vote for them this upcoming election so that we don't end up with Trump
Biden doesn't know where he is. I'd be embarrassed to defend him. #WheresHunter
I just want to see how the Liberals act to the critics that talk about Harris having descendants that owned slaves . Also about her accusing Biden being a sexual harasser &amp; now he‚Äôs the cats meow . If this was a conservative, the Libs would be marching &amp; crying .Tad hypocritical
We are going to have a Conservative majority in November. You sex workers should vote for Trump. Because under a socialist regime of Biden and Harris you will no longer be making money. You will have your financial assets seized by the government.
It will be funny when the Biden,Harris campaign talks about trump and his family donations to Kamala
Please can we all just agree to vote for Biden/Harris. Please. I don‚Äôt care if he‚Äôs not the perfect choice but really, he‚Äôs the better one. Get this fucking tangerine out of the spotlight.
I like Kamala.  Not my first choice, but I think she's phenomenal and I'm thrilled she's on the ticket with Biden. My only real concern is about her KHive.  Worse than Bros ever thought of being. And now they think they are the base?
It's amazing what four years of 45 on this platform have done for me. I'm not having any discussions, arguments, or "exchanges of opinion" anymore here. If you support 45, we have nothing to discuss. Want to take pot shots at Biden and Harris? Do it. Blocked.
So explain Biden today? What's that, you can't? Congrats on becoming a complete hack.
He is a known commodity. Obama remains the countries most popular President and Biden was a part of that.
What a disgusting Whiskey voiced hag.  Fox News host baselessly claims that 'something's going to happen' to Joe Biden, forcing her colleague to walk her comment back  via
Was watching Biden Harris.
On March 16, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden made an unprecedented promise mid-debate: to choose a woman as his running mate, no matter what.    ‚òùÔ∏è
And that‚Äôs the reason people like you . Cannot come into power . I predict you will leave Washington in a pine box . With that bobble head for Soros Biden and Obama. You will reap what you sew. Tread lightly
Did i say conservatives are good? I just don‚Äôt like socialists that weaponize race to their advantage. If you don‚Äôt vote for Biden you‚Äôre not black üëçüèº
Say trump and Biden are switched in this situation. What do you think people like you and liberal media‚Äôs would do with information. The DNC, hypocrisy at its finest.
Every woman I know who lives in the suburbs (it's not 1957, dude) thinks you are contemptible and is voting Biden/Harris.
Joe Biden and this lady are only going to screw our country up
Joe Biden and this lady don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about people need to open their eyes excuse me Black people are not the only people on this planet
Oh yeah Joe Biden and Obama stopped a bola
Dude this lady accused Joe Biden of being racist before?
Do people actually believe that Joe Biden will do anything for the United States he‚Äôll do nothing but raise taxes trumps done more for us
Joe Biden says he‚Äôll fix the country what it yeah race Texas defund the military take away your Second Amendment and then there goes your head remember right you people have to realize he is he is not going to be in control he‚Äôs just a puppet
I‚Äôd like to watch my news not Joe Biden he thinks people are crazy if they‚Äôre going to get rid of the Second amendment of people that allow Will not allow it
Joe Biden I could give you shit you don‚Äôt need no money need to go to an old folks home
I‚Äôd like to watch my News not see old man Biden on my TV screen I don‚Äôt like him go to an old folks home
Not voting for Joe Biden or you just screw the United States up
And I agree but a vote for Biden just because of him being ‚Äúthe lesser evil‚Äù isn‚Äôt going to make our country any better sure historically third parties don‚Äôt win but who says we can‚Äôt change that?
Our President Biden has never done anything like that.  Lies. We know this. So look to your tin god Trump.
Well Joe Biden becomes president there goes the world higher taxes higher food military lower military cuts and then will probably get taken over by another country
Man am I bummed Biden didn't pick Marianne Williamson.
Just read that Giuliani's daughter has endorsed Biden/Harris.

Watching Joe Biden school Sarah Palin in 2002 was a historical high point in politics.  Pence vs Harries is going to be the pinnacle! Never have we seen 2 candidates so unevenly matched. I cannot wait to see Harris decimate Pence. I hope he cries.

It wasn't that long ago when the Democrats had 24 choices.  They voted for Biden.  Sanders and Williamson supporters now have three choices: Biden, Trump or throw away your vote.  Compare Biden to Trump and make your own decision.
maybe its because every democrat has run on reducing freedom of religion, and taking away at least some guns.  Biden and Kamala both have.
According to Trump, Biden will hurt God. So Biden is powerful.
You will raise taxes greatly and billionaires will leave and take their money with them. Sorry, Mr. Biden.
You have sat on your very large and prominent perdonker dunk and murdered 170,000 innocent Americans. Your inaction killed a lot of suburban mothers children and loved ones. These wonderful suburban women will vote for BIDEN/HARRIS to save this country from you.
Not surprised Biden picked Kamala Harris for VP, because before you fuck kids, you gotta lock their parents up. #BidenHarris2020 #SniffEmNFuckEm2020
THE #Democrat Party stood for racism long before Trump switched to the Republican Party and put AMERICA first.  While Biden still thinks China "isn't so bad". China is pulling for a Biden Inc. to win. Where's Hunter?
Lmao. And just like that the Biden Campaign gives up on a state with a population less than than the city of Detroit. And there goes a whopping 3 electoral votes. Lol.
And now the of rest  the story, China Joe will be unable or unwilling to mount a campaign. IF Biden INC won't debate, where will the #Democrat Party be? Harris campaign was at 2%, TWICE what Hunter's father's 1%. Economy MUST fail, schools CANT't open.  Or Trump will WIN WIN WIN!
God damn it, my dad is gonna ask me any day if "you SJWs are happy about Biden's VP pick"
Oh really. Cry me a river, knuckle draggers.
This picture of Biden always makes me think of the Martians from the movie "Mars Attacks"...

Trump campaign tweets mugshots of alleged criminals, all of them Black, to claim Biden is pro-crime  via   Trump's entire staff is criminal and they are all walking free to include HIM
I mean she also called Biden a racist very recently if were gonna go fact digging around irrelevancies. Oh wait one deals with donations to an attorney general and the other deals with the fact that the newly appointed Democratic VP candidate called her running partner a racist.
But that same woman called Biden a racist as well ü§î interesting
a RW hold on the SCOTUS for a generation if RBG retires, corporate control on policy, increased income inequality, loss of 1st am rights &amp; police reform are on the ballot not just Biden&amp; Trump. Purity tests &amp; disillusion arent justification enough to risk the suffering 45 causes.
So 2020 election is boutta be Joe Biden/ Kamala Harris or Trump/Pence,,,-
"Joe Biden is a racist!" - Kamala Harris
"Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate"
So if voting independent is a vote for Trump or a vote for Biden, then why vote independent at all? They don't want you to cause its easier to divide, control, and conquer when it's two.
At this point, he would simply look like a copycat.  Still, I always thought he would if Biden did, so maybe.

please. i don‚Äôt care how you feel about biden or kamala harris. PLEASE don‚Äôt vote third party. get trump out of office
Biden and Harris
Agreed. That being true, I would vote for her over Trump or Biden in a heartbeat.
She isn‚Äôt my first choice. Neither is Biden.   But I do respect her &amp; believe she will make a great leader, when it comes to that.  Also, she‚Äôs 55, so if she does a great job &amp; earns our votes, she might provide a steady &amp; capable presence in DC for the next 12 years.
I saw your grandson Owen at the local pitch  n‚Äô putt. Was upset to see the Apple had fallen far from the tree. He wore a shirt that said ByeDon! Libtard can‚Äôt even spell Biden!
Plus I heard.  ( not sure if it's true or not yet.) Biden said a while back, "He needed a vice president that can take charge an control. When he quits 6 months after being elected."
If Joe Biden becomes president we have to look for higher taxes business is shutting down the virus is spreading more higher cost-of-living going up in peoples paycheck not going up he is Do not elect him as president
Is Joe Biden choosing a black woman to Con Black people down?
While I would have preferred Elizabeth Warren as VP, I respectfully disagree with your assessment. I think independents and Never Trumpers are more than fine with Harris. If a conservative academic still prefers Trump over Biden/Harris IMO they were a lost cause to begin with.
If people actually believe these commercials that are run by Joe Biden blaming the president Donald Trump for everything they‚Äôre not using common sense
You just don‚Äôt like trump Joe Biden is too old

At this point "can they speak coherent sentences" is the bar. I don't think Biden/Harris is perfect, but it's fine for now (I would've preferred Warren).   Also, glad he didn't pick Whitmer b/c we need her to stick around Michigan.
welp, there it is. I‚Äôm in for the Biden/Harris and I‚Äôm not happy about it
I‚Äôm a white woman and am so thrilled with Biden‚Äôs VP pic. I can only imagine how black women must feel right now. Wow! What a moment.
joe biden and kamala harris the duo we never asked for but will settle
Awww poor Stretchin‚Äô Gretchen!  Well shit, I‚Äôm not voting for Biden, I‚Äôll tell u that right now. No way am I changing Kamala Harris becoming president.
Great choice Joe! Biden/Harris 2020
üö® Joe Biden selects California Senator and former Presidential candidate Kamala Harris as his vice presidential running mate.  #KHive | #2020Election
Whitmer.will be offered a cabinet job if Biden wins
Before that you will see Biden is smashed by Trump
Joe Biden is too old and I don‚Äôt even think he knows where he is at time or what day it is
I‚Äôm getting tired old man Biden go to a retirement home all man
In all seriousness VP picks kinda dont matter (except Palin) and if you were hesitant to vote for Biden based on his VP pick you were looking for an out so you could vote for Trump #facts #BidenHarris2020
#BREAKING The Vice President spot on the democratic ticket will be  she is  pick.
Chills and tears! Yes! Go Team Biden!
I‚Äôm in for Biden-Harris. #BidenHarris2020
Biden Harris 2020 officially. Great choice
Biden supporters don‚Äôt give a shit about what offends Trump.
Joe Biden just picked Steve Harvey as his VP. Oh wait that‚Äôs wrong #VPPick
‚ÄúIt got so bad Joe Biden went on a bike ride the other day with a mask on‚Äù ignored the reporter that was so close to him Biden had to ride around him! And that he was riding in a group and SS detail must stay within 6 feet to protect him. So yes Biden was appropriate to wear one!
TEXT OU812 to find out FIRST who is DEFINITELY MAYBE going to be Biden's VP
Love Biden the way I love Obama!  I will fight for him all the way!
Love Biden!  üíôüíôüíô
Seeing that there are more Women voters than Men I would say this is just another colossally stupid statement. Mentioning Race is just typical racist trump.  Trump claims ‚Äòmen are insulted‚Äô because Biden might pick a Black woman vice president
Money older than joe biden
I would love a Biden/Harris ticket!
Distraction, not that it matters... There is NO ONE on planet Earth that Biden can choose as his "V.P." that would cause him to LEGITIMATELY win the Presidency.
Did you see the info babe's eyes lift when she said the Chinese want Joe Biden?
I doubt Biden even knows who Kamala is or what it means that she "unfollowed" him... Guess he didn't like the way she "smells"?ü§£üòÇü§£
My God, Politco really is putting hit pieces on every VP candidate aren't they. None of the main contenders, especially not Kamala or Whitmer would cost Biden any state. It's crazy to say and think that would happen. People vote for the nominee, not the running mate.
It's very possible this isn't related to Biden, but if it is, I have no idea what this means. Maybe a speech together? Maybe Cabinet meetings. Maybe recording something for the Convention? South Bend is also really close to Michigan, so maybe it's not even Pete.  No idea.
They won't announce the VP until after they announce Biden's replacement!
According to who?
Maybe Joe Biden will use the Toimb of the Unknown Soldier.    I am not serious but can you imagine the backlash that would  happen?
Also, in case you haven't noticed, Bernie is working with Biden.
I think it's important for this country to survive and that only happens if Trump is not in control of this country.  Frankly if you think Trump and Biden are the same, you are WAY not paying attention.  Biden earned votes. Obviously Bernie didn't, or he'd be the nominee.
Boo hoo. Where has Bernie been during the BLM protests?  Kamala has been out there protesting, and working her ass off.  For her record, the receipts have been brought time and again to prove stories on her are wrong. I'm voting Biden no matter who is VP is. Can you say the same?
I seen the fist Biden sign near me and it‚Äôs a big banner I was shocked to see next time I drive past I‚Äôll get a picture
It doesn't matter who they chose for VP, Biden and the demoncrats are going to lose... They've awakened more people to the truth (not their intention, I'm sure) than we could have ever done in so short a time.  They're screwed, and they KNOW it!
This is the only part of their base that has any energy to it. They need it, because Biden is doing nothing for any of them. Everytime Biden talks, Trump gains voters back. This is all they got.
All Lies  nice try and keep watching CNN and other networks that just bush the Liberal agenda.  Biden = Communism!!!  The True Russia hoax.
is / was an  advisor to Joe Biden for the debates.
Biden is also for cutting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.
You just feel stupid because Biden's actually saying racist crap. We don't have to spin it.
Who tf is confident in Biden lol
Well this is where you lose me as your fan. You will lose your ability to make money under a Joe Biden dictatorship. Trump is the one that can save America as we know it . Let me say this any openly lefty Trans will not be supported by me. I rather not know your politics.
I wouldn't mind you following me, you being a  Wrestling fan. Had you not openly declared yourself for Biden and against Trump. Such stupidity by someone following my account will not be tolerated without a rebuttal. So consider yourself rebutted. Have a nice day.
Your  hero  Barack Obama (who's the actual heel along with Biden and virtually the entire Democratic Party) you want to use wresting terminology for this current e? Then Trump &amp; his supporters are the Faces, the heroes.
Biden is such an ass even his campaign ads he talks about doing everything that Trump has already done you mean to tell me people watching the ads don‚Äôt know that?
According to Biden, 150 million of us have died from gun violence, and 120 million have died from COVID...  So, there should only be 60 million of us left? ü§îüò¨
And there's this...  Nancy says "China would prefer Joe Biden"
Since the Trump campaign is endlessly running the ad where Mr. Biden says something stupid, will this recording come up during the race? During the debates?  Trump On Tape: I Grab Women "By The Pu**y‚Äù  via
All the more reason we don't want nor need Joe Biden.
Amy I don't care who he picks. What I want is for everyone to stand and vote for Biden no matter who he picks. Cable news will dissect her to death. Ugh!
Oxygen? Here‚Äôs Joe Biden riding a bike...when was the last time Trump‚Äôs fat ass got on a bike?
These EO's are dead on arrival on Monday. But here's a thought for the brainless Magat's. For laughs let's say this walking colostomy bag gets away with this. When Jan 20th comes Biden by EO can erase the Cap on SS. Repeal all of trumps tax law. Make space force disappear..
We know that. Milano is a Biden supporter. What do you expect.
Awww.. poor dear.  Did someone ruffle Trump‚Äôs reputation?  Deservedly so..  Kanye has admitted that it‚Äôs only to pull votes for Biden, so...
JOE BIDEN SHOULD PICK WHO HE WANTSüó£
I'm sure Biden will not have any boat parades.
Biden supports basically none of the policies that Sanders supports and from the bottom up any dumb fucking asshole who insists otherwise knows nothing about them beyond their name and listed party. Just sad that one of those fucks is the president...
Text TRUMP to 88022! I stand with
I hope she can. Because quite frankly under Biden and his  minions we will all have less freedom to do just about anything including you  Arielle Scarcella. My one hope is that you vote for Trump in November and save America as you know it. Because  the new America would be scary
Madam Speaker, why are the 2 Rep's that are helping Putin funnel negative propaganda about Biden still allowed to serve on the senate?  When are you all gonna hold Trump and his gang accountable for their treasonous acts, and not to mention the Kanye fiasco....Enough us enough!!
Calling it, by fall, there will be a real effort by the trump campaign to pull "youth support" away from Biden.
I believe what we see happening at the hands of Repubs is by design...a long game with big money and foreign power behind it.  If Biden wins and Dems hold the House and take the Senate, they will find a smoldering pile of ash left by Repubs because that's how they play.
Michigan republicans would vote for Biden to get Whitmer out of Michigan
I thought you asked why Biden was excommunicated.
Biden literally said roe v wade went too far
Biden? Church?  I‚Äôm pretty sure he was excommunicated a while ago.
üòÇ  Future President Joe Biden will be elected.  He will take you out behind the woodshed &amp; make sure you are prosecuted   He‚Äôll help set up a framework for fixing what you‚Äôve broken  Then he‚Äôll step aside &amp; we‚Äôll have compassionate, intelligent leadership for the next 11 yrs üá∫üá∏The enthusiasm for Donald Trump is absolutely amazing his supporters do all this on their own. I don‚Äôt hear much from Biden except a dumb add where he said he‚Äôs gonna do everything that Trump has already done. He is such an ass.
I don‚Äôt understand truly, Joe Biden has said far more racist things than Trump, how is that not a issue
prosecutors, the American people either never gets the Putin vaccine or it just turns out to be a hoax and the trillions of  $$ to Putin was to let tRump stay in Russia. Epilogue: the Biden administration puts crippling sanctions on Putin and Putin blames tRump and bye bye tRump!
let‚Äôs be real here, Biden only picked Kamala Harris because she smelled better than the other possible candidates. #BidenHarris #KamalaHarrisForVP
If Biden is polling better than Clinton did in 2016, then how come the FiveThirtyEight forecast in August 15th 2016 gave Clinton an 88.8% chance but Biden has a 72% chance now?
But yet this is ok
I think there is enough disaffected progressives/liberals because of the Joe Biden, Kamala Harris ticket who would vote for Trump if he pardoned Edward Snowden.
Don‚Äôt worry. Davis is just playing the game. Her excitement is to get people to vote Biden/Harris so we can get Trump out of office.
She would become  a  virtual dictator should she and Biden win. She needs to be defeated at all costs. America will cease to exist should they win. And they don't have a dog's chance as Paul "Mr. Wonderful " Orndorf would say.
lol yeah the #resist in your bio along with several blue wave emoji, a Joe Biden/Kamala header, &amp; profile full of Dem tweets didn‚Äôt give it away. You‚Äôre an absolute joke üòÇ peace
Biden actually did help right the 1994 crime bill. It‚Äôs a valid critique. But at least he now acknowledges the issues of the justice system unlike who we have now. So his statement is bull.
Historically vice president were opposites to their president. Really thats all she needs to say of she wants to keep the narrative that there is really any substantial difference between her and biden, or between them and Republicans for that matter. They're the same. Viels off.
Asking Palestinians to pick between Trump and Biden is not asking us to pick the ‚Äúlesser of two evils.‚Äù  It‚Äôs asking us to pick the lesser of two abusers.  #Palestine #FreePalestine
Ignore him.  He‚Äôs trying to steal attention away from Biden &amp; Harris.
I'm pressuring Joe Biden to support liberal policies by attacking anyone who criticizes or pressures Joe Biden into supporting liberal policies.
Biden praises the Israel-UAE normalization agreement. He even tries to take credit for it.  Raise your hand if you‚Äôre surprised.  #Palestine #FreePalestine
Much needed change when Biden and Harris win  the ticket. And there is no longer the likes of people like you wandering the peoples White House halls any more.
I agree with you!  POTUS will win big. I am one of the silent majority but I am building up the courage to put my TRUMP/PENCE sign in my front yard. Just on my street in my small town so many have their signs out. I have not seen one Biden sign.üá∫üá∏
You were the best senator and grilled everyone came in front of you. And you are going to be the best VP after you and Biden win
She's just Biden her time 'til November.
Lol, the Dems are already getting rid of Biden?
President? So you know that Biden is a place holder???
Ask her about how she thought Biden was a creep, you know before she was selected to run with him
I wonder where the enthusiasm is for Biden.
real unfortunate that a vote for anyone other than trump is a vote for biden :-/
friendly reminder that donald trump used to donate to democratic political campaigns. most notably hillary clinton, joe biden, and kamala harris üôÉ
Joe Biden will be 78 in November.
Make them viable during the midterm and primaries. Voting for them now is wasting a vote and giving Trump the win. Biden and Kamela would be the better option of the only two we actually have.
Joe Biden Picks Kamala Harris for VP | Sterling K. Brown #theDailyShowWithTrevorNoahEarsEdition   via
A presidential primary campaign and many hit pieces from leftist breitbart dot com later, and it‚Äôs seen as ‚Äúthe sky is falling‚Äù for progressives when Joe Biden picks Harris has his running mate
Pushing the left even farther away with your ‚Äúsuck it up‚Äù and vote for Biden/Harris strategy.
Yeah its gonna be a daily reminder to vote for Biden and his hairy legs
Hmm ok these are bad policies to back, so I probably wouldn't be a fan of hers or Biden, but I'm going to vote for them this upcoming election so that we don't end up with Trump
Biden doesn't know where he is. I'd be embarrassed to defend him. #WheresHunter
I just want to see how the Liberals act to the critics that talk about Harris having descendants that owned slaves . Also about her accusing Biden being a sexual harasser &amp; now he‚Äôs the cats meow . If this was a conservative, the Libs would be marching &amp; crying .Tad hypocritical
We are going to have a Conservative majority in November. You sex workers should vote for Trump. Because under a socialist regime of Biden and Harris you will no longer be making money. You will have your financial assets seized by the government.
It will be funny when the Biden,Harris campaign talks about trump and his family donations to Kamala
Please can we all just agree to vote for Biden/Harris. Please. I don‚Äôt care if he‚Äôs not the perfect choice but really, he‚Äôs the better one. Get this fucking tangerine out of the spotlight.
Trump would wreck everyone on the bus coming from our away games in high-school. Ya Wlad ya Wlad. Shu!! Tuhkoosh ma3 biden. Why??? Cuz he sniffs girls hair in third hour. Lmaoo
He is a known commodity. Obama remains the countries most popular President and Biden was a part of that.
Then you‚Äôre not voting Biden lol
Did i say conservatives are good? I just don‚Äôt like socialists that weaponize race to their advantage. If you don‚Äôt vote for Biden you‚Äôre not black üëçüèº
Say trump and Biden are switched in this situation. What do you think people like you and liberal media‚Äôs would do with information. The DNC, hypocrisy at its finest.
Every woman I know who lives in the suburbs (it's not 1957, dude) thinks you are contemptible and is voting Biden/Harris.
Our President Biden has never done anything like that.  Lies. We know this. So look to your tin god Trump.
Man am I bummed Biden didn't pick Marianne Williamson.
I have been in the resistance day one. I have Phone banked for months for Biden &amp; Democrats. I started a 501(c)(3) nonprofit called Vote Voiced to GOTV in MI. I am the Voter Engagement Chair of the Western Wayne County Branch of the NAACP in Michigan.  #Vote2020
Watching Joe Biden school Sarah Palin in 2002 was a historical high point in politics.  Pence vs Harries is going to be the pinnacle! Never have we seen 2 candidates so unevenly matched. I cannot wait to see Harris decimate Pence. I hope he cries.
As  picks  for VP,  Issues Stark Warning #civility #KamalaHarris
Trump lowkey not wrong about Biden I‚Äôd never vote for him even if I could vote üò≠
maybe its because every democrat has run on reducing freedom of religion, and taking away at least some guns.  Biden and Kamala both have.
According to Trump, Biden will hurt God. So Biden is powerful.
It‚Äôs got to be a coordinated thing; it happened so suddenly. Can‚Äôt believe it was to overshadow Biden‚Äôs VP pick, but it was definitely on purpose.
THE #Democrat Party stood for racism long before Trump switched to the Republican Party and put AMERICA first.  While Biden still thinks China "isn't so bad". China is pulling for a Biden Inc. to win. Where's Hunter?
And now the of rest  the story, China Joe will be unable or unwilling to mount a campaign. IF Biden INC won't debate, where will the #Democrat Party be? Harris campaign was at 2%, TWICE what Hunter's father's 1%. Economy MUST fail, schools CANT't open.  Or Trump will WIN WIN WIN!
Vote for America!  Vote for Liberty for all! Vote Trump 2020 and John James 2020!  We need people who love OUR Country! Trump does not take one dime from this country and he has only been in office for 3 years!  The Biden group have been around for 45 years...look at the mess!
I mean she also called Biden a racist very recently if were gonna go fact digging around irrelevancies. Oh wait one deals with donations to an attorney general and the other deals with the fact that the newly appointed Democratic VP candidate called her running partner a racist.
But that same woman called Biden a racist as well ü§î interesting
I want at least that. Biden isn‚Äôt as right wing as Trump and certainly not as impulsive.
So get four more years of Trump then? If you can‚Äôt have it 100% your way, you‚Äôd prefer total defeat? That‚Äôs childish.  I dislike Biden. He‚Äôs creepy. He‚Äôs corrupt. Likely not sincere. Now take those qualities, shift them even farther right, and you get Trump. That‚Äôs worse.
Well, we *had* other options.  They‚Äôre not available anymore. Not for THIS election cycle.  Biden, even if only barely, is better than Trump. The least we can do is vote for the lesser evil and try harder to support truly progressive candidates. Maybe Yang can win in 2024.
So if voting independent is a vote for Trump or a vote for Biden, then why vote independent at all? They don't want you to cause its easier to divide, control, and conquer when it's two.
When she ran for Senate she did a lot of things to build her name up. Now just a couple years later she is going against everything she stood for in order to sell her souls to the devil aka Joe Biden
Progressives: I feel you. Biden wasn‚Äôt in my top 5 for the presidential primary. Your jaded feelings are valid, but don‚Äôt lose the hope.  We have two allies in  &amp;  They can only pull off big upsets if they get Bernie-level fundraising. Follow &amp; donate!
i hate that biden and harris and trump and pence are our only god damn options i hate america
We cannot take anything about this race for granted, and I look forward to turning out the 12th district and all of Michigan for Vice President Biden and Senator Harris in November, to protect our country and democracy.
I want this for Biden‚Äôs cabinet. Cuz I feel like the monstars can also be rehabilitated at this time, as well.
please. i don‚Äôt care how you feel about biden or kamala harris. PLEASE don‚Äôt vote third party. get trump out of office
"A vOtE FoR SoMeOne OtHEr ThAn BiDeN iS a VoTe FoR tRuMp"
Biden‚Äôs like ‚ÄúACAB? All cops are the best?? Okay! Sign me up!‚Äù
Biden and Harris
I saw your grandson Owen at the local pitch  n‚Äô putt. Was upset to see the Apple had fallen far from the tree. He wore a shirt that said ByeDon! Libtard can‚Äôt even spell Biden!
Harris: 'I believe' Biden accusers
While I would have preferred Elizabeth Warren as VP, I respectfully disagree with your assessment. I think independents and Never Trumpers are more than fine with Harris. If a conservative academic still prefers Trump over Biden/Harris IMO they were a lost cause to begin with.
Oh wait it does Joe Biden said he would only pick a African American Lady! Hypocrite!
Should we make a Biden Bear?  One with a heart?
At this point "can they speak coherent sentences" is the bar. I don't think Biden/Harris is perfect, but it's fine for now (I would've preferred Warren).   Also, glad he didn't pick Whitmer b/c we need her to stick around Michigan.
welp, there it is. I‚Äôm in for the Biden/Harris and I‚Äôm not happy about it
joe biden and kamala harris the duo we never asked for but will settle
Can I just vote for Biden/Harris now please?
Great choice Joe! Biden/Harris 2020
Whitmer.will be offered a cabinet job if Biden wins
Before that you will see Biden is smashed by Trump
#BREAKING The Vice President spot on the democratic ticket will be  she is  pick.

Biden Harris 2020 officially. Great choice
Biden camp is running a remarkably tight ship

Need one similar which says,  "Real Atheists  For Biden".
Money older than joe biden
if KHarris didnt go on a debate stage and openly call Joe Biden racist to his face IN TEARS a bit ago then this VP pick would have been made a month ago and those two would be looking good   now he makes that pick and trump has boat loads of ads against them lol
If you haven‚Äôt read the green new deal then you shouldn‚Äôt vote  If you haven‚Äôt seen any debates yet you shouldn‚Äôt vote  If you haven‚Äôt seen any appearances from Biden/trump tht you watched to entirety you shouldn‚Äôt vote  If you haven‚Äôt looked into who funds him then don‚Äôt vote
I would love a Biden/Harris ticket!
Did you see the info babe's eyes lift when she said the Chinese want Joe Biden?
Dear me, at least he is talking in sentences.  Joe Biden has can't even say words on the first or second time.
Or whoever the Democrats might pick as Biden's replacement.
My God, Politco really is putting hit pieces on every VP candidate aren't they. None of the main contenders, especially not Kamala or Whitmer would cost Biden any state. It's crazy to say and think that would happen. People vote for the nominee, not the running mate.

Rice, though never elected to anything, is a foreign policy expert with a very close personal relationship to Biden. Whitmer has been a governor for less than two years, with no federal government experience.  But she's white. And to Biden, that's the winning ticket. (10/10)
Whitmer's selection also has the added bonus of delivering Michigan's first Black governor if Biden is elected, as our lieutenant governor is Garlin Gilchrist, a Black man. (8/10)
I wouldn't be surprised if Biden is making the following calculations:  "Black people will largely come out and vote for me no matter what because they're scared of Trump. Progressives will come out because they're scared of Trump... (5/10)
They are all for workers' rights and so on. But they are not joining the protests in the streets. In fact, they are made fairly uncomfortable by most talk about race and racism, as it seems Biden often is. (4/10)
These moderate (white) voters would be okay with a woman being one heartbeat away from the presidency. But not a Black woman. Especially in the age of Black Lives Matter.   I grew up in Delaware and Pennsylvania. I lived with the kind of white moderate Democrat Biden is. (3/10)
My prediction: Joe Biden will select Gretchen Whitmer as his VP candidate.  Why? Because she's white.  Biden's whole theory from the jump of the campaign has been to flip moderate (white) Midwestern voters who voted for Trump in 2016, narrowly giving him the White House. (1/10)
Boo hoo. Where has Bernie been during the BLM protests?  Kamala has been out there protesting, and working her ass off.  For her record, the receipts have been brought time and again to prove stories on her are wrong. I'm voting Biden no matter who is VP is. Can you say the same?

You just feel stupid because Biden's actually saying racist crap. We don't have to spin it.
To stop the American people‚Äôs time from being further wasted on unproven rumors, could the media possibly attempt to not imply or claim either candidate is under foreign control without any evidence? #US #politics
Honestly, instead of Trump, it should be Biden.
Who tf is confident in Biden lol
Well this is where you lose me as your fan. You will lose your ability to make money under a Joe Biden dictatorship. Trump is the one that can save America as we know it . Let me say this any openly lefty Trans will not be supported by me. I rather not know your politics.

All the more reason we don't want nor need Joe Biden.
This is why this pandemic will never be over in the USA. Hopefully when Biden takes over in January he'll lock the country down for a month and have a mask mandate.
Amy I don't care who he picks. What I want is for everyone to stand and vote for Biden no matter who he picks. Cable news will dissect her to death. Ugh!
I think the student loan freeze, eviction moratorium extension, and 400 dollars unemployment bonus is relevant as well. As someone who shall not likely be voting for Trump or Biden I can appreciate when either campaign makes a clearly good move, because it is so rare.
If Biden knows how to run the country why didn't he tell Obama?
We know that. Milano is a Biden supporter. What do you expect.
JOE BIDEN SHOULD PICK WHO HE WANTSüó£
!!! Joe Biden names TOAD TOADSWORTH as his running mate after long running VP speculation  ‚ÄúYHELLO,‚Äù says Toad, clocking in at a mighty 6‚Äô7‚Äù
Actually i think biden is just a senile corporate front man
Biden supports basically none of the policies that Sanders supports and from the bottom up any dumb fucking asshole who insists otherwise knows nothing about them beyond their name and listed party. Just sad that one of those fucks is the president...
Biden: ‚Äúcan you get me Minnesota‚Äù BG: ‚Äú... Sir it‚Äôs Michigan‚Äù Biden: ‚Äúyou passed my first test‚Äù
Can we simply decide the winner of this election by having President Biden race aginst Trump on bicycles?  Can Trump even ride a bicycle?
I hope she can. Because quite frankly under Biden and his  minions we will all have less freedom to do just about anything including you  Arielle Scarcella. My one hope is that you vote for Trump in November and save America as you know it. Because  the new America would be scary
That‚Äôs fine dude. Biden will do the right thing in January.
Joe Biden, too easy
I thought you asked why Biden was excommunicated.
Biden? Church?  I‚Äôm pretty sure he was excommunicated a while ago.
Burn that garbage, Trump is going down November 3rd...Biden 2020 MFers ü§£He‚Äôs right. Biden 2020
I have no empathy for him whatsoever. You expect me to show empathy to him while he doesn‚Äôt show any whatsoever to Joe Biden where he lost his first wife and daughter in a car accident and almost his two sons too while at it. And then later on his other son Beaue dies too? üò°üò°üò°
I think you‚Äôve literally described a chain of events with no evidence of wrongdoing or corruption.  Bad optics sure, unethical at most, bad precedent 100%. No evidence of criminality, not to mention Hunter Biden will be not near his administration.
Name one thing that sleepy Joe Biden did in his 40 years that made a positive impact on America?   Crickets chirping.
Tump's tryig 2 get a little WORKING- CLASS IRISH-AMERICAN TOUGHNESS. Like JOE has. Trump grew up RICH &amp; SECLUDED. Biden grew up POOR &amp; WITH PEOPLE: FIGHTING BULLIES; playing W/ his buddies TOUGH SPORTS of FOOTBALL, HOCKEY, BASEBALL , BOXING. Trmp didnt. His RICH DAD was too ANAL!
Have you heard your president slur and walk lately.. It's amazing he's not in the hospital getting monitored. Not to mention he speaks like an 8 year old. So there's a couple of times Biden needed to collect his thoughts.. Who doesn't from time to time. Still much better than DT
Never said Biden is adopting his platform en masse. But look at both then compare to Trump's. I.e. public option vs Medicare4all vs no plan at all. Both believe in democracy vs Trump's autocracy. Throwing out the baby w/the bath water isn't better just shows your bitterness.
If you can't see that Biden/Harris is so so much better for America than Trump/Pence, then you are either blind, ignorant, have a screw loose or all the above.  Be smart people, especially on Nov 3rd and do the right thing for the country.
‚ÄúBut you could argue that the biggest Biden/Trump contrast, the mother of all remedies, is his capacity for compassion, identification ‚Äî the ability to make the connect, the very thing he‚Äôs been peddling from the start.‚Äù THIS IS WELL DONE! Thank you for penning this piece.
‚ÄúBut you could argue that the biggest Biden/Trump contrast, the mother of all remedies, is his capacity for compassion, identification ‚Äî the ability to make the connect, the very thing he‚Äôs been peddling from the start.‚Äù Learning to Love ‚Å¶
Would be a mistake for Biden to avoid one on ones until November but this far out there‚Äôs no need to inflict unnecessary damage while his opponent lights himself on fire everyday.
So you would rather have Trump‚Äôs total lack of governance and human decency because that‚Äôs closer to a Bernie presidency than Biden. Do you even care Bernie‚Äôs platform? This is what happens when you let checkers players into a chess game.
Why is Trump saying that Biden wants  to defund the police if It has  already been done on his watch?  I am scared today.
Guess  thought he was going be President &amp; make the appointments during his term? The left spends all its time debating principle &amp; then the clock runs out. Even now far left is badgering Biden about Medicare 4 all. What good is progressive purity if we don't win? ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
It‚Äôs obvious that one of his lackeys wrote this. Someone who knows the fine art of projection. You can tell when he goes off script. It‚Äôs patriotic to wear a mask. It may be great, it may be good, it may be not so good. Covering all the bases. üôÑüòÇüò∑üòÇüôÑ
I guess they think we cannot remember (or find) these things... Hey! Whoever is sending Biden's tweets... Please let him know that the internet is forever!
What benefit is it to him to go on a Sunday talk show.  The crazy ass clown show he is running against commits suicide daily at press conferences &amp; refuses to take the measures to slow down the crisis that‚Äôs been swirling around him since March... Biden keeps gaining in polls.
So you complain about Harriet handling us off, but you say trump and Biden are supposed to restore the black community?...ok.

It's just not so thinly veiled racism to erase black voters who picked Biden.
I bought the Impolite Arrogant Women shirt from Warren's campaign. If Biden/Harris offered a line of shirts with quotes like this, I'd purchase every last one.
Joe Biden talking about requiring masks outdoors for the next 3 months:  "It's not about your rights"  Yeah, we know that, Joe.  Leftists don't believe in human rights.  Our prediction?  Every leftist governor will start following whatever Harris/Biden recommend immediately.
My questions...  Will Republicans push for Kanye to be included in the Presidential debates?  Should Biden?  (might be illuminating)
Also that‚Äôs taking votes away from Biden too, Biden needs all the votes to get Trump out of office. Every vote counts in this election
Trump recently said that Sen Biden insulted all men by picking a woman running mate. Not that Trump has ever worried about hypocrisy, but that‚Äôs a hard one to ignore.
When will Trump challenge Heels up Harris to take a DNA?  How will that play out considering that Biden was suppose to pick "the first BLACK FEMALE?
The Clintons are central to a pustule of corruption. Bill in the White House, Hillary in the senate and in Obama‚Äôs cabinet, the Clinton foundation. They‚Äôve sucked in Pelosi, Schumer, Schiff, Nader, RINOs, Obama, Biden and Harris, et al. It‚Äôs a cancer in our government.
I know if my grandpa was still alive today he would be voting for Biden instead of Trump. He voted straight red his whole life and hated Trump before he died. The last thing he said about Trump was ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a cocksucker‚Äù
I think Biden-Harris are only "mandating" masks because they have to cover their badly botoxed/cosmetically altered faces until they look "human" again.
Tax reductions seem unlikely given the enormous fiscal response to the Covid-19 business disruptions. Biden‚Äôs tax plan offers a glimpse of what we may be facing in 2021 and beyond.

And you'll be dead right about the post-election analysis if Biden and Kamala fail to defeat Trump.
I like Kamala.  Not my first choice, but I think she's phenomenal and I'm thrilled she's on the ticket with Biden. My only real concern is about her KHive.  Worse than Bros ever thought of being. And now they think they are the base?
It's amazing what four years of 45 on this platform have done for me. I'm not having any discussions, arguments, or "exchanges of opinion" anymore here. If you support 45, we have nothing to discuss. Want to take pot shots at Biden and Harris? Do it. Blocked.
In my trip to the #Michigan Upper Peninsula last week I counted election signs for fun while driving. Well... #Trump 32  #Biden 5 I also started counting Family Dollar and Dollar General stores...but lost count of them, too many!  Coincidence?
Team Biden/Harris 2020!
I wondered how Kamala Harris felt about being chosen as Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate based solely on her gender (1 of only 2) and the color of her skin, rather than her achievements and the possibility of being POTUS (which is not legally possible). Apparently, she‚Äôs elated.

Again, my sense from personal experience is that the power elite are cosmic eff-ups, that can't walk and chew gum, think Biden before memory-ward fodder. Parasites function solely by virtue of the (Randian) sanction of the victim ("men of the mind"). Think tapeworm beating chest.
The difference is when ppl are still dying under biden/harris you wont give a shit anymore

I don‚Äôt think so.  If Trump loses and refuses to leave, on Jan. 20 he becomes a trespasser in the WH and de facto threat to Pres Biden. The Secret Service would have ample resources to restrain and remove him.  stay safe
It‚Äôs gonna be Biden is really a black Muslim who wants to hurt God and the Bible...  but Harris isn‚Äôt really black.
How Biden decided on Harris  SERIOUSLY,  MSN WENT WITH THAT HEADLINE?

Well any of the list were horrible candidates, all would bring Biden down. But of the list Kamala is maybe the least offensive... IMO. She helps suggest a possibility of law and order. She is a senator, so some legislative experience. But probably bad for attracting minority vote
Considering I have no faith that Biden could last 4 years, I am opposed to voting for ‚Äòpresident Kamala Harris‚Äô
Her staying in helped Sanders more than it helped Biden. When Buttigeig / Harris / etc dropped out, their vote was going to (1) Biden or (2) Warren.  The left consolidated around Sanders. Warren staying in spoiled the moderate vote more than the Sanders vote.
Take a solid look at Biden‚Äôs platform, and how many of her plans made it in. He‚Äôs got the most progressive platform of any modern presidential nominee.   She didn‚Äôt get anything for herself, but she got more for the left than any modern pol but Sanders. The hate for her is crazy.

So excited that Biden has selected  to be his running mate.  Let‚Äôs get this done!
Democrat voters aren't voting for Joe Biden - they're voting for a list of "influencers" who'll be controlling what amounts to be a sock puppet.  Also - that stock background photo was from the 2012 Republican National Convention.  You can't make this stuff up, folks.
That‚Äôs a great ticket! Thank you President Biden.
1) Insufficient base turnout in MI,PA, &amp; WI beat Hillary 2) Benghazi won't trump Covid 3) Dems and Indies are so fired up that VP pick matters little re:turnout. Covid, bad economy, and Trump will drive turnout on both sides. That's why Biden will win. Keep riding that bike Joe!
In all seriousness VP picks kinda dont matter (except Palin) and if you were hesitant to vote for Biden based on his VP pick you were looking for an out so you could vote for Trump #facts #BidenHarris2020

I have a question for all the republicans who are voting for Joe. Are you just voting for Biden and for the rest of your ballot voting for Republicans or straight Democrat? Just curious not going to criticize I‚Äôm just curious that‚Äôs all.
Agree, but look at Biden, build back better. Similar message, without the seat of your pants diplomacy. American manufacturing is key. We can‚Äôt have all workers from home making no physical product.
Come on man, I am so forward looking to having a conversation with the president. Joe Biden is a Buffoon!
You do realize those characteristics are diametrically opposed to Biden, right?
I don‚Äôt expect Biden to last 4 years, maybe not even 1. So I‚Äôm sure as hell not voting for ‚Äòpresident Susan Rice‚Äô.
Distraction, not that it matters... There is NO ONE on planet Earth that Biden can choose as his "V.P." that would cause him to LEGITIMATELY win the Presidency.
I doubt Biden even knows who Kamala is or what it means that she "unfollowed" him... Guess he didn't like the way she "smells"?ü§£üòÇü§£
And, you are also misinformed about the Federal deficit.  Recall that Obama / Biden inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.  Federal deficit trend (note the increase under Trump before the virus hit):
This isn‚Äôt a 100% by any means, but it sure seems like Susan Rice is going to be Joe Biden‚Äôs VP pick. The betting markets have completely flipped in the last 24 hours in which Kamala Harris was a big fave &amp; now Rice is the favorite on her own.
The other way to look at jobs, number employed (again Fed data).  Employment rose steadily from 138 M in Dec. 2009 to 152 M in Dec. 2016 under Obama / Biden.
You are also misinformed about jobs.  After Nov. 2010 unemployment fell steadily from 10.5% to 4.9% at the end of 2016 under Obama / Biden (Fed / Bureau of Labor Statistics data).
You are misinformed.  After Q2 2009 real gdp rose every quarter for the next 7 1/2 years under Obama / Biden.  Federal Reserve data:
Please, Governor Whitmer, don't go to Washington as Biden's VP. We need you here in Michigan.
She would graciously say that. Black folk, me in that number, as a reliable voting block are tired of being overlooked. That is very real, and Brother Biden should pay attention to that very real sentiment.
If course I‚Äôll vote for Biden, although Gov. Whitmer and Warren are both qualified they aren‚Äôt my 1st choice or 2nd thru 5th choice but in Gov Whitmer‚Äôs case it‚Äôs all selfish on my part because I‚Äôd kind of like to keep her in Michigan. There‚Äôs still a lot of work to do

Biden is a thoughtful man who measures his words carefully. It's the bs projection of Trump's diseased brain. Have a VP prediction?üåü

It is not surprising that the Jewish community is excited to be represented on the Biden-Harris ticket.   Kamala Harris‚Äôs husband, Doug Emhoff, is a member of the tribe, and two of Joe Biden‚Äôs children are married to someone who is also Jewish.

It sucks that the Overton Window in the US shifted right 1970-1994 but you're not going to (literally) get anything done without working with a party establishment anyway; Politics is inherently about building consensus, and while I'm further left than Biden, I understand that
Have you decided to vote for Biden yet?
And ignoring that crowd is how Biden won that state
Interesting facts about Kamala Harris that you probably didn't know, PLUS see what rumor got "shut down" by reading more, below! -Randi Myles
But his momentum is w/ young voters. The same momentum Bernard had in that state and he lost it. Nobody thought Biden would win Massachusetts. Ed Markey is Dependent in those same voters. POC support Kennedy &amp; in a close Race can be decisive &amp; we‚Äôre never polled right
Why should they lay off. Women day they equal. And we blacks are equal. So have at it. She can certainly fish it out she prove this by her attacks on Biden. Do Trump, Pence media go for it.
Why should we she and Cory Booker told us how racist Biden was. Are we to believe her now? Her record for putting others in jail was 70 % more blacks than whites. She is phoney. I
Why does Biden have 600 layers watching voting?? I do not trust that.
We must re-elect President Trump. Can you imagine a China lover in Joe Biden in the Outhouse and a V.P who is the most liberal senator in the Senate running our Country!
The post office is touchy subject.  We know that either party will claim it‚Äôs rig if we use the postal service.  Trump trying to prevent that.  Just one mistake and it‚Äôs going to be a joke. Trump can‚Äôt lose on this post office thing.  Biden can bc when shit goes wrong. Trump warn
It‚Äôs amazing that people believe that Biden is ahead. I live in one of the top ten Bluest counties in the country and Trump signs outnumber Biden signs by probably 100:1.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel responsible for the sins of my father and grandfather. I feel responsible for what the situation is today, for the sins of my own generation, and I‚Äôll be damned if I feel responsible to pay for what happened 300 years ago.‚Äù Biden
"You cannot go to a 7-11 or a Dunkin Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent. I‚Äôm not joking.‚Äù Biden said this
‚ÄúUnless we do something about this, my children are going to grow up in a jungle, the jungle being a racial jungle with tensions having built so high that it is going to explode at some point.  We have got to make some move on this.‚Äù Biden quote
Why don't America cut all ties with the Chi-Coms! They steal everything we come up with. They send out a virus all over the worlds to try and get their boy Biden in the Outhouse!
From Joe Biden‚Äôs website.
it‚Äôd be great if it was renamed Make Billionaires Never Again Act &amp; it was ready for Biden to sign on day 1; assuming he wins.
But YOU stepped all over this fantastic news by going after Harris and Biden instead of delaying comments on them to promote the agreement. YOUR fault! Not the fake news fault. YOU handed them the methodology to undermine your achievement
I'm thinking about getting a Beretta M9 just in case the morons vote China Biden in the Outhouse!
This birther üí© was probably put out by the Biden campaign!
‚ÄúGov. Gretchen Whitmer...has broken key campaign promises made to Blacks‚Äù

100% of Biden are bogus.
‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs latest remarks reflect a demeaning and condescending trait among white liberal politicians. When you invite them to a meeting in the Black community, they take the biggest seat in the room without seeking permission.‚Äù

Speaking directly before Biden is huge for us! Happy with this news!
don't get me wrong, i'm voting biden/harris, but this bears repeating. WHEN they get into office, we still have so much work to do.
My mother keeps calling me a Bernie bro bully while yelling at me about how I have to vote for Joe Biden or I'm personally responsible for Trump's reelection.

Don't vote for air head biden and dumb ass kamala they will screw the world up and then the ones who vote for him will be crying cause jobs will disapear in PA and people are gonna have to pay high taxes. Wake up America pull your head out of your asses. VOTE FOR TRUMP
Yea right, the only traitors to go down will be low level people like the FBI lawyer that just pled guilty. The real criminals like Obama, Biden, Comey and Brennan will face no justice
Once again Andrew Knaggs is like every other Trumper who wants to act like Biden is diminished when there are so many examples of #Trump doing the same thing. When called out he says he's going to table it until the debate. Go to any media source &amp; watch the 100s on Trump
I keep replaying the part where she says, "She's on a Biden ticket not the  Sanders ticket...."
So Joe Biden is 3 yr older than Trump who we know is a stable genius He says so all the time You won't answer the question as to WHY YOU KEEP SAYING JOE BIDEN IS DIMINISHED When there are 100s of examples of #Trump doing the same thing #SuburbanHousewivesForBiden

Trust me I would have preferred bernie. I'm not enthusiastic about Biden, he is a very average candidate to me. But all that matters rn is getting Trump out since there's no other choice. Hopefully the next candidates are better
I never said Biden is good. He is pretty average imo. But he isn't Trump, and at this point that's all I care about.
yes,  Biden told the world he would pick a black female now he's painted his butt in a box.   Democrats don't even like her  only far nutty one's Do.    She will be bossing the old man around  maybe even punching him   She looks the part

A friendly reminder that the President freaking children work in the White House! Hunter Biden is a private citizen, please stop this you're embarrassing yourself spewing this Russian Propaganda given to you by Putin!
Is Obama still taking credit for Trump's economy? Biden literally took credit for Trump's peace deal a couple nights ago.
So joe Biden has an island next to Jeffrey Epstein‚Äôs. It‚Äôs an old military base complete with submarine docking station and a big ass military control room.

Polled twice,they called looking for my daughter and I took there poll then they called me back a month later and asked what Biden could do to win his support, told them if he was magician and could turn into Ronald Reagan then maybe I‚Äôd consider but since he‚Äôs not then trump2020
I feel you there. This is what I use for the stubborn Berners and EWarren for Veep folks who are expressing their disdain. If I had the choice, I would‚Äôve wanted Sanders/Warren as the ticket, but there‚Äôs no reason for folks like me to *not* vote for Biden/Harris. Absolutely none
So That's good, no Joe Biden allowed!
Biden &amp; Obama pretended to care about the climate crisis, then did this--&gt;  "[Under the Obama Administration, oil production saw] an incredible 74% increase. In fact, in 2015, the U.S. pumped the most oil in 43 years."
Why should we believe he's going to do what he says? Biden's record shows he does not care about the climate--&gt;  "[Under the Obama Administration, oil production saw] an incredible 74% increase. In fact, in 2015, the U.S. pumped the most oil in 43 years."
Campaigning for Biden now?  You lie worse than he does.

Your profile says you're in Texas, it would be nice if that state was in play. I think your question is relevant. We vote for someone, I believe Joe Biden is a man of faith  integrity, honesty, and decency. I believe he will move our country forward and be a great President.
I‚Äôll agree on the hoax. I‚Äôm calling you out the February and March stuff. Biden was holding rally‚Äôs deep into March after a Trump stooped and Pelosi was telling people nothing to worry about. The democrats were actually worse. You can‚Äôt run by me with that argument
Unfortunately where I live just North of Detroit they either have Joe Biden or BLM signs down my whole block. üò° needless to say I am moving out of Michigan to the great state of Florida this month to live near my new born twin granddaughters!

People not being honest with themselves about the reality of our current candidates just because they want trimp out. Just straight lying about Biden and Harris. How are Democrat‚Äôs so different from republicans again?
Biden could never out work Donald Trump.   Biden continues to campaign from his basement.  Why would Biden's work ethic change if he was in the White House?

People who are critical of Biden/Harris have good reason to be, especially those of us who are impacted by their political choices &amp; acting like that criticism is gonna cost them the election is dishonest &amp; stops them from dealing with accountibility.
Yeah. One thing is obvious by every possible metric‚Äîworking class white men are taking a hit and being reduced in society. It‚Äôs all coming from the left. Look at Biden‚Äôs forced VP pick based only on identity.
What Biden is saying. Americans are stupid! We tell them what you do! Like we do not have enough sense to protect ourselves. Beware this is the frist step to SOCIALISM! Bit by bit taking our freedom away.
FACT:  Unless Biden arrest Trump as soon as he Swears I DO- You will never see Trump serve a day in jail or court as long as he lives! Once he get on AF1, he will DISAPPEAR from the world to parts UNKNOWN!  If I see Trump in cuffs on Inauguration Day, I can die a HAPPY MAN!

Joe "the bigger the lips, the hotter the sauce" Biden.

I saw my first one in metro Detroit last weekend. I've seen plenty of "Anybody but Trump" but exactly 1 Biden. It's crazy. Everybody hates Trump, but nobody likes Biden.
Just a question: Where tf were all of you when Biden was VP under Obama for 8 years with these complaints? ü§£ Now you're all digging up shit like detectives. Nope I dont excuse his old career politician ass but‚Ä¶
it‚Äôs clear you only read Trump tweets. Biden referred to Trump labeling it the ‚ÄúChinese‚Äù virus as xenophobic, not the travel ban. He actually agreed with it because it was backed by science. You‚Äôre not going to win the argument that Trump handled this well. Move along ‚ù§Ô∏è
So will you vote for Biden and Harris Ben ?
and you know that how? Biden actually believes in science. Him and Obama literally developed a pandemic response guide in 2016 for the next administration (and it wasn‚Äôt followed). Funny you even brought him up when we were talking about Trump‚Äôs failed response.
And true to form, if Biden does lose, those with questions will be blamed as opposed to the folks whose job it was for the last 3 almost 4 years to present the right candidates and platform. Or if they win you will have leadership that promised nothing but to not be Trump. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The reason they want a Democrat back in office is the same reason why they're sitting on their asses &amp; also the same reason why you dont get any calls or people knocking on your door for Biden. Because liberals dont want to have to think or really do anything but go back to sleep

I'm afraid that come november, even if Biden gets elected, people are going to assume they can sit back and stop protesting for important causes because the president will "fix everything" which is NOT the case. Regardless of who wins, don't stop fighting. They won't change

Do you want to lose your social security? Trump wants to end it. Biden voted to cut it 4 times.
Ever wonder why American Presidents are prohibited from taking monies or lavish gifts from foreign countries?  Because it compromises them.  Biden has been compromised by American corporate interests as well as Ukraine who gifted his moron son millions of dollars.
Of course. Plus she deserves it. My guess though is Biden will lose more white votes than the black votes he gains. I hope I am wrong.

I watched this multiple times. You're missing the point. Biden can disagree with somebody &amp; realize they have a lot to offer even if they have a different opinion on something. This is leadership  &amp; Character.   Donald Trump will fire you if you disagree with his ideas.
You should spend some time doing research before you blast out comments on Twitter. It's clearly documented that Joe Biden grew up with his stuttering problem.  Biden has overcome his insecurities about stuttering. Trump has never overcome his insecurities resulting in narcissism

Pollsters are fearful due to missing the Trump victory so they are reluctant of being too strong for Biden despite their own polling. My guess is that the polling for a Biden victory is accurate. Harris will increase his lead in the polls. Trump will be defeated unless Putin and

He didn‚Äôt say that.  He said it‚Äôs further to the left than it‚Äôs ever been, but that platform has nothing to do with Biden.
Ok sure but there 3 months till the election do you think enough people are going to vote independent (and agree on a candidate) to make even a dent against Biden or trump Conservatives are anti change that's their whole schtick, you need a liberal supreme court for real change
Because here‚Äôs the thing: you‚Äôre not voting for Biden.  You‚Äôre voting for Ruth Bader Ginsberg‚Äôs successor.  It‚Äôs choosing between getting shot in the knee or shot in the gut, but if you choose neither, then someone else takes the bullet for you.
I dislike them both, but as I‚Äôve said over and over again, I‚Äôm not voting for Biden, but RBG‚Äôs successor.
The concerns are legitimate, because voting for Biden is painful.  However, this isn‚Äôt an election where you vote to get someone IN, this is an election where you‚Äôre trying to get someone OUT.  If Joe doesn‚Äôt do the right thing in four years, then vote him out too.

As bad as Biden and Harris are, they at least have people like Warren, Sanders, and the BLM movement nudging them in different directions.  All I can hope is that they listen, because four more tears of Trump is just the start of the worse alternative.

Are you saying Biden doesn't have money he brought in Kamala for money? üôÑüôÑ..  Do you follow American politics? First of she got this VP ticket based on her black race (Mixed Indian race is added bonus, if she is pure Indian, she won't be in the race for sure)
So apparently some of the first real oppo they release on  is basically reminding voters that the Biden-Harris White House will end the discriminatory cash bail system in this country
Politics is a chess game. Few Americans play chess. Joe Biden doesn't. In this game, he is NOT a King, he is a little soldier that Dems move to the left. Pretty soon, he'll fall of the chess board. Kamala is NOT a Queen either. She is a chameleon, who is easily changing colors.

Don‚Äôt think so! She won‚Äôt be debating ! It will be trump and Biden!
So because the Obama team didn't do it this way they automatically assumed that Biden's team wouldn't?  It makes sense, really--get the oppo out there to see if anyone gives a shit *and* to see how the prospective VP candidate handles/responds to it being dumped.
Joe and Beau Biden of course.
‚Äú sent word to Biden‚Äôs team that while she was flattered, she no longer wanted to be considered for the running mate slot, according to a high-ranking Democrat familiar with the process. She recommended Biden pick a Black woman‚Äù
So after all the fuss about Secret Chartered Flights from South Bend last night...he asked her via FaceTime.
I disagree. Biden‚Äôs pull with those Obama / Trump voters is masssive and under reported. They will turn out where it counts.. People seem to forget that Trump won by &lt; 100k perfectly placed votes. If I recall correctly he won MI by 17k. Those votes are gone.
Fun story: A year ago, when there were still like 300 Democratic candidates, I whipped up a fundraising page for ALL of them as a joke. As each one dropped out I removed them from the page. For months it‚Äôs been just Biden, of course, but I haven‚Äôt promoted it until today. 1/
Proud to be a Biden Supporter!
So here‚Äôs a question: How long has his digital/graphic design team known she was his pick? Or did they create logos, websites, graphics, site content, etc for EVERY likely choice just in case? Are there Biden/Warren, Biden/Whitmer &amp; Biden/Rice websites buried on the server?
I don't want to do it. I don't like Biden one bit.  He doesn't' represent me at all. But I will do it, because I must, because the alternative is a threat to democracy itself.
Go google Biden‚Äôs voting record from 73-09. Then stick your head in a soiled toilet and flush.  You have no idea what you are talking about.
Agreed. This was my hope since Biden became the presumptive nominee. So pumped. It‚Äôs been a joy watching most of the reaction.
Vote Trump nothing harms Corporate pimp Biden more.
I think folks are under the impression that Biden himself is acting as his own web developer or something.
Was......Ridin with Biden:-(((( til he chose Krapala
Green is great. Trump votes are more damaging to Biden.  I‚Äôm not sure how many 29 dollar Bernie donations I made.  Close to 3500 I can account for. ( I smoke ) can‚Äôt always remember.....  DNC fucked me out of 3500ish. Trump it is this ballot
They will when we start winning. This Biden nomination saved me a small fortune in political contributions. I gave 100 to that 70 something year old lady to retire.   That lady, is gunna be most of us if we don‚Äôt eliminate the corporate owned DNC and their gaggle of puppets
This isn't the first time that the GOP has outright lied about what our candidates have said. Just the other day, Michigan Republicans said that Biden wants to defund the police‚Äìwhen he has literally said the opposite in a June 10th Op. Ed.
May I ask are you turning out to vote Biden?  Only fair to say I am not.
I cannot get rid of a Biden, Kamala Harris header üòµ
She‚Äôs a liar also! But then Biden is also!
Oh my God this woman is a liar! She knows Biden is a racist!
This was the difference between Sanders and Warren. This is why I had to vote Biden in my state primary.   DON'T LET THE PERFECT BE THE ENEMY OF THE FANTASTIC
Bullshit! He picked who he wanted.   I wanted Warren/Harris. Then Biden/Warren. But I GOT Biden/Harris and guess what? It's STILL going to be a successful ticket and they'll accomplish great things.  COVID has validated Warren policies. She'll be unstoppable in the '21 Senate
What a terrible choice. Good ole Joe. Politics at its best. Biden sucks.
okay in all seriousness kamala was a dogshit pick even before police brutality came up in the discourse again. her history as prosecuter, DA and AG is a bad look but is great when juxtaposed with ‚Äúminimum sentencing‚Äù biden, the DNC continuing to push lukewarm dipshits who are...
Biden-Harris has been my dream ticket for some time, so I love today‚Äôs news. I also love how many other absolutely incredible women have been in the public eye as serious contenders more than prepared for the office.
Do ‚Å¶‚Å¶ &amp; ‚Å¶‚Å¶ remember this ‚Å¶ statement or are they too busy soaking in the praise from the liberal media who only loves republicans when they attack republicans?
So if you criticize her record, her unauthentic grandstanding in Congress and leftist policies, you‚Äôre a sexist and racist??? Group called 'We Have Her Back' warns media against 'sexist' or 'racist' coverage of Biden VP pick | Fox News
Whoo hoo! Biden/Harris 2020!  üíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíô
Can‚Äôt wait for  racist-ass response to Biden‚Äôs VP choice.   #VicePresident #Trump #Biden
Until Kamala Harris comes out and honestly explains why she refused to pursue and prosecute Steve Mnuchin the head of our treasury for gaming for closures when he was at One  West I will not vote for Biden
SOLID pick! Let‚Äôs do this üîµüá∫üá∏   #BeatTrump #BidenHarris2020 #Biden2020 #KamalaHarrisForVP #Biden #Democrats #USA #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica #HistoricPick #Kamala
Horrible decision I will not vote for Biden!
Until Kamala Harris explains why she did not prosecute Steve Mnuchin for gaming foreclosures with One West which incurred company fines to the tone of 100M dollars, I will not be voting for Biden.  Of all the qualified and incredible running mates, he chose the poorest candidate!
Interesting that the stock market took a hit near the end of today. If Biden wins. We will find out what the crooks were up to these past years.
Ridin' with Biden and Harris!! Lets dump Trump!
You're not making any sense, if Russia has already purchased Biden then  that's who they would want in the office ad president.   Russia has purchased Donald, Mitch McConnell,  and grassley
Okay somebody needs to do some research. Every single thing Biden did regarding this situation has already been evaluated. Watch the entire tape &amp; read the articles.   Stop using propaganda that's faults.  Research dude research.
Presumptive of me, but I'm really proud of Joe Biden for choosing a woman who hit him hard in the debate. He's showing us he's a man who can take criticism and doesn't hold grudges. How refreshing.
Biden made the best choice possible imo. And the others will be part of his team. As a lawyer. I respect her intelligence and ability. Joe needs a fighter. He will unite Dems and have a great cabinet. Trump can win only by cheating. And he will try.
The bussing comments made by Biden against Harris in the debate were overstated. Bussing was never a great solution to a big problem. But it also allowed many of color here in Detroit to get to better schools and many from poor neighborhoods. In retrospect. It was a disaster.
Ok is that why she went and met with Biden last week .
Remember the debate where Kamala Harris heavily criticized Biden on busing? Picking Harris speaks volumes about the kind of man Joe Biden is. Does anyone think President Man-Baby would or could pick someone who wouldn't kiss his fat ass day in, day out?
Kamala Harris is announced as Joe Biden's running mate(VP), her mother is a tamilian (Dad is an African American). Joe Biden's memory is getting so bad, if Biden wins, he may not continue as a President for long, Kamala may take over. Congrats Kamala üëçüèº
Hell yeah!  I‚Äôm way more excited about Kamala than Biden but let‚Äôs do this!!! #bluewave #KamalaHarrisForVP #BidenHarris2020
I can't wait for VP Harris to be the girl power face of what's sure to be a brutal, sustained, and punitive crackdown on protests using faceless federal troops the SECOND Biden wins. Assuming he does of course, and that's no slam dunk.
Joe Biden just lost his 2020 election good going üòÇ
I have stayed out of the frey. But I believe this is a great choice. She can take on Trump and Pence and Mitch. Trump can‚Äôt attack too hard. She knows the law and how to take on Trump. Biden may have Warren at Treasury. Those tax returns. Schiff as AG. Abrams at HEW.
Newt you are 100% correct that Biden desparetely needs to shore up his support in the black community, although not the first to notice it.
Fuck. I knew i should have bought one of those Biden Harris websites when they were doing the primaries coz i knew this was coming
Biden/Harris - the comprehensive rapist/mass incarceration bootlicker 2020.  Trump is Rapist/Religious Mysogynist.  There is no "win" here.It‚Äôs also pretty lame of  to not follow up with, ‚Äúso, do you not think those attacks (implying Joe Biden is a racist for working with segregationists and opposing busing) were true? Or what?‚Äù But he‚Äôd likely say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just a comedian‚Äù
Credit to her, I guess, for discrediting herself rather than saying ‚Äúit was a debate and we just disagreed (whether Joe Biden is a racist for working with segregationists and opposing busing).‚Äù
Your not wrong Go with your gut  Tell the others you feel better and more confident with Biden
Trump Syndicate. RICO Act in 2021. That's if we win. Biden/Harris!
2 weeks ago, my friend and I took a trip to Caseville, up North. The Biden signs and the Trump signs were about equal. Danny is a Trumper. Doesn't mean I don't still love him. He's just misguided, like my Mother. Just don't talk politics üòú
Y'all realize that all these polls with Biden smoking Trump are, as  said, "Bullshit Polls," right? Y'all got giddy like this in 2016 and you're doing it again.
Well, that‚Äôs the Biden endorsement I wasn‚Äôt expecting...
Even after Biden wins in a couple months, does anyone really think the social fabric in America will ever be the same as prior to the advent of the virus?
I think you‚Äôre a traitor who‚Äôs getting paid by Russia to smear Biden. Your story is weak, Russia isn‚Äôt getting their money‚Äôs worth.
This attitude right here is why I have no time for progressives shitting on Biden nonstop. A god damn former right wing tea party congressman can put his beliefs aside to end the emergency and so can everyone else.
For the people in the back: Biden and Harris are not radical leftists. Run your campaign and blast the other side and do your thing, but don‚Äôt scare people with statements that are not true.
The big question is: Do you have your Towel??
Maybe not you, but some of us could get accepted back in our family‚Äôs home country. But I have never said I would go anywhere. üòâ
Thank You!! Those of us with sense know this mess of a government endangers Canada as well as the US.
That‚Äôs cause you tell so many lies!!! Biden a honest man!!!
my coworker said she would rather have Trump back in office cause Biden is a pedo like sis ....both are üíÄ
The year is 2021:   Trump has been physically removed from the White House after his loss.  Biden has implemented a national mask/testing strategy, eliminating COVID in 6 months.  USPS is fully funded.  College football teams are gearing up to start a fall season.  Life is good.
He has been this whole time, but you never hear about it on your media. This whole time he has been actively fighting the pandemic. This whole time Democrat‚Äôs and Biden/Pelosi Stayed home and did nothing. They  some How still think that they can criticize.
So we just need some other org to say you can't vote for Biden, and then we can install a Catholic monarch, right?
Not even Biden writing these tweets
Give me a break. I certainly don‚Äôt see this from the  The press corp allowed Trump to break the norms, so you can‚Äôt expect only Biden to follow them.
So the Russia interference investigation indeed was a witch hunt like Trump had been saying. FYI this happened under the Obama/Biden administration.
The Blue Wave, my neighbors, the positivity Biden/Harris stirred up. We need to find a way to channel all the anger we have towards Trumpublicans into positivity for Biden/Harris. We're not out of the woods untill January 20.
2/3 a coup, Obama/Biden had a pattern of 8 yrs of spying so why is anyone surprised that they spied on Oppo party and a Presidency  They spied e.g. Merkel, AP, Rosen/Family, Congressional committees; All Americans=Clapper lied under oath; Brennan lied, Comey leak/spied
I just pray we see a Trump vs. Biden debate.
Joe "I don't do white running mates" Biden is definitely turning out to be the real deal.
I need to ask you if you are for or against abortion? &amp; Either for or against the LGBTQ? I am just asking a simple question. I agree with Biden about the economy, &amp; I Pray you are there to help him as well. To be honest, I lost trust in politics years ago.üò∞
Oh hell no. Biden for the win. Warren freaks me out
Ill be looking forward to seeing the Running VP behind bars. Shes an active terrorist and a communist. If Biden is elected we can put her away forever. In her own system.   42 U.S. Code¬†¬ß‚ÄØ1985.Conspiracy to interfere with civil rights

I have complete confidence in the Biden Harris team! Hopefully the cabinet includes many of the other candidates.
I feel like you‚Äôre wildly under-selling the amount of Americans who refuse to vote for Biden. It‚Äôs not just online smugbros, there‚Äôs a ton of ex-hippie boomers for example.  America will suck regardless, but Trump winning would make it a permanent, potentially world-ending  suck.
Congressman Khanna, you are more of a leader for the people than Biden or Harris will ever be. Please keep up your pressure if they get elected.
We are so fortunate to have you as Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate. Major hurdles, of course,   Massive sexism (at 72 yrs I so understand), birthism (no surprise), that craziness about no red meat (anything to be just plain crazy). We just fight the good fight!!!!
Postal Union Endorses Biden-Harris As Trump Threatens USPS
So what the hell is your point?  Because he repeated a grade that makes him ineligible to be POTUS?  Really Soledad I expected better from you than this bs!  Move on, #Biden-Harris to save USA!
Biden is a warmonger who along with Obama/Hillary invaded Libya, drone bombed seven countries and fueled Syrian/Yemeni war and sent American soldiers to fight useless wars. How is any of that showing empathy and leadership?
Vote for Biden anyway.  Count on Biden to put together a team of advisors that he will actually listen to.  He‚Äôs not going in thinking he has to know everything.  He just has to know how to lead.  Besides we have a better shot at surviving the next 4 years with Biden for Prez.
A vote for Biden is a vote supporting his warmongering with Obama, their invasion of Libya, their drone bombing in seven countries and the death of 100,000 brown people. F off with your democracy. A vote for Biden is a vote for war and murder.
Edgy take of the day:  "We are bombarded by death, disease and the dawning of a new Great Depression. . . . But as a silver lining, we no longer have to suffer the bullshit of presidential campaign reporting."  -- Hamilton Nolan,
It‚Äôs cool. Biden/Obama led Libyan invasion, drone bombed seven countries, fueled arms to Syria/Yemen conflict and led to 100,000 dead brown people. So if you vote for Biden, I consider you having voted to bomb brown people.
2/2  is full of Crap so much data incl Dossier/FISA ABUSES; documents via Freedom of Info by   why do u let Tarlov say if I haven‚Äôt seen anything yet re Historic spying on Oppo party w so many lies by Obama/Biden Rice Comey McCabe
How does the rest of the panel let Tarlov get away w her BS - there is plenty of Documented information that Obama/Biden spied on  campaign and Presidency and it is a continuation of 8 years of spying eg Clapper all Americans; AP; Rosen/Family; Merkel  1/2
Dems aren‚Äôt ‚Äúlooking for the perfect candidate.‚Äù If this was any other country progressives like Bernie wouldn‚Äôt even be the same party as Biden. We don‚Äôt want the perfect candidate. We just want a candidate period. I‚Äôm voting for Biden but Biden is not progressives‚Äô candidate.
Btw I‚Äôm still begrudgingly voting for Biden. Not sorry. If you can‚Äôt acknowledge Trump is worse than Biden you need let go of your inflated image driven ego and learn to think critically. Stay mad
I live voting for Biden on ‚Äúpolls‚Äù hahaha. Trump 2020!
Biden is whatever I don‚Äôt like
They probably have Biden signs in their yard! Hiden Biden!
These polls suggest that Biden has a lock on the popular vote, and an almost certain lock on a November victory. State polls suggest the same. He's ahead of Trump by 6 points or so in Michigan, for example.
"Hell no, I'm not resigning ... I thought (the post) was humorous. I had no idea people would react the way they did. I think people have gone overboard on this ‚Ä¶ It's an election year."

Biden and Harris for 2020
Joe Biden is going to force our children to read the Curand (muslim bible) in schools.
Biden good,  trump very, very horrible traitor.
R: Don‚Äôt vote for Biden, he‚Äôs a pedo.   D: Don‚Äôt vote for Trump, he‚Äôs a pedo.   That‚Äôs a fucking issue.
I hope someone makes a digital animation of a Biden/Harris train, because wowie.
I just saw the gal bullying the 12 y/o and I‚Äôm leaving it on Coward‚Äôs Ratio look up my likes if you want to find it. Like listen man, I get you‚Äôre that mad about Biden and Kamala....I don‚Äôt know how to finish that sentence.
Joe Biden Calls For Nationwide Mask Mandate 'Immediately'
Of course. Plus she deserves it. My guess though is Biden will lose more white votes than the black votes he gains. I hope I am wrong.
He talks out of both sides of his mouth. One time he says one thing. Then five minutes later he's saying something different. And he can't stand it when Biden is right and he's not.  Trump has to be center of attention for everything. He can't stand it when Biden or Harris talk.
What‚Äôs the point anyway?  Biden will do what he wants so Ro‚Äôs vote against the platform means nothing.
r u kidding, the demon'crats will do anything to win  elections...how do people like Whitmore...the squad..polosi..Schumer  ..Schiff.. problem child M. Watters..shit for brains the thief biden...Kamala the mirror fake news Harris ...who votes for these pos...they cheat !
And yet Biden is a big enough man and ethical leader to choose someone as his running mate that doesn‚Äôt always pander to him. This is a refreshing change! We will have better outcomes in leadership when we are permitted a diversity of ideas and solutions.
Everything is going to come out IF we can successfully elect Biden/Harris. The Trumpublicans and Trump syndicate WILL see PRISON! That's why this is all or nothing for this corrupt regime! Vote! No matter how you do it! Vote!
Dolly Parton should be the Secretary of Humanity in the Biden Administration.
when u talk of Stock Market share how many people are in the stock Market incl pension funds. In addition, when Biden Harris say they would Mandate Nationally - it is an example of the Nanny State and Dems plan to have Govt Control over everything eg zoning Suburb 1/2
Trump is already blaming Biden for everything and calling him a liar... also said number 1 in the world for Ventilators?!... please end this shit #TrumpKillsUSPS #TrumpThreatensAmerica
It's already collapsed and the world is already laughing. It's time for a Biden rebuild.
Every time you feel the urge to take a shot at Biden or Harris, redirect that shit toward Trump. There is a country to save.
no biden voters allowed to read my tweets

Yep a very cynical ploy by Trump. Vote for Joe Biden!
I think Biden is better than Trump that‚Äôs it. I don‚Äôt like Biden he‚Äôs just the better of the two shitty candidates.
Thank you for agreeing with me. You‚Äôre right, you weren‚Äôt talking about Biden‚Äôs covid response, but you quoted my tweet about Biden‚Äôs covid response with a completely new topic and acted like my tweet you quoted was in opposition of your comment. Be honest in your discourse plz
Has Joe Biden congratulated Trump on the historic peace agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates?
My super power would be to snap us right to Jan21, 2021 for Biden‚Äôs inauguration.
Per Biden's rule, perhaps you're not really Latino. üòâ
Hey Kamala Harris, Care to explain why prison stocks rose, as soon as u were announced as Biden‚Äôs running mate? Or are u just gonna continue doing what your doing at the expense of others. I hate choosing the lesser of two evils
I always wonder how tf Trump shoves Big Macs down his gullet every day and has even lived this long. What kind of sick joke is the universe playing? And Biden looks like he could croak literally any second. It‚Äôs the same feeling of waiting for the screensaver to hit the corner.
#SayHisName  it's sad i have to hear about this on twitter i guess the news is to busy bashing joe biden.
Amazing to see a so-called Christian call out the faith of Joe Biden (a regular Catholic churchgoer) while embracing #ImpotusAmericanus who has trampled every teaching of Jesus Christ!!! Absolute hypocrisy!!! #BidenHarris2020 #BidenHarris2020Landslide
In short, fascism won‚Äôt be changed in one election, but we can chip away at it by voting in the direction that we want. Like it or not(and I fucking hate it) Biden is our most progressive VIABLE candidate. And that sucks ass but it‚Äôs reality.
And look at the fact that RBG‚Äôs term is ending. You DO NOT want trump to be in command when it‚Äôs time for her to be replaced... anyway, my point is no voting for Biden won‚Äôt immediately change anything but it will make it easier to get the change we want to see in the future
One single person to take command of everything. Look at Trumps cabinet and how damaging they have been to the country. Let‚Äôs be honest here, Biden probably isn‚Äôt going to even live through his full term. But the cabinet he puts in will have be way better than the current one
Future that I would want to see, NOT because Biden represent the future I want to see, but because if he gets elected Trump will be out office. My main focus is just getting trump out of there ASAP because he can‚Äôt handle this pandemic. Biden sucks but he at least will be able to
With that out of the way let‚Äôs address the second thing you said. I‚Äôm not claiming voting for Biden will end the oligarchy. Not even close. Voting for one candidate can‚Äôt accomplish that, but that‚Äôs not the goal of voting for him... voting for him is just one step toward the
Is biden harris having one at 5 20
Since you decided to share a definition with me earlier I think it‚Äôs only fair I get to do the same. You still keep straw Manning my arguments. Trump is demonstrably worse than Biden. I don‚Äôt like Biden. I think we can agree that we need to abolish the two party stystem right?
The Biden campaign is looking more and more like "Weekend at Bernies."
America makes progress after kicking and screaming and whining, but progress is made just the same. We need to work to make sure the Trump years were just a blip of ‚Äúwaaa we don‚Äôt wanna‚Äù sandwiched between Obama and Biden/Harris, with a more just and equal America for everyone.
2/3 let Voters exactly what Harris/Biden promised Dem Voters-    Get  info on Harris re not prosecuting Catholic Church abusers &amp; his documents- how she went after Sickle Cell Student then talk to
attack Harris‚Äô/ Biden‚Äôs Primary positions! Why, bec Harris will certainly take over from Biden- then will push her own agenda - if Biden wins and can remain Pres for 1st term - I believe he will resign near the end so Kamala will be Pres leading into the  election 1/3
Okay that‚Äôs not a good thing, but that‚Äôs child‚Äôs play compared to systematically destroying the USPS in the middle of a global pandemic. Not even in the same realm. Like I said, Biden isn‚Äôt good, but Trump is off the charts fascist. It‚Äôs not even a comparison.
okay then i don‚Äôt wanna hear shit about progressives or ‚Äúbernie bros‚Äù losing biden the election in november. y‚Äôall don‚Äôt want or need our votes but then blame us for everything when shit goes south. and for the record I still am voting for biden.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
Yes and I‚Äôm choosing to vote for the guy who‚Äôs not actively engaging in voter suppression(fascism). Don‚Äôt get me wrong I can‚Äôt stand Biden or Harris, but we can‚Äôt let Trump erode our democracy another 4 more years
Fantastic 2 days of introducing Biden/Harris! Speeches brought tears of joy. Truth, empathy &amp; plans for America! Bravo team, well done!

*herman laying in peace*  Biden: kamala is my running mate  Herman:
Bernie: sets of easy to digest plans with bills backing them up  Biden: I‚Äôm gonna restore the soul of America and I‚Äôm not Trump. C‚Äômon man!
I‚Äôm been trying to convince my socialist friends to settle for Biden for months, and this short video makes me want to stop that.   Shane, go phone bank for Joe, rather than shit talk leftist who have legit reservations on how bad the Dems are.
DOJ? PFFT. Please with a criminal as AG. I can't wait to see these criminals go to prison. Biden has already said he will not stand in the way of investigation and incarceration of these criminals.
I think it‚Äôs great they asked a respected Republican governor to endorse Biden at the DNC. And it‚Äôs spelled soul.
just watched your show. I loved how Biden teed up the mispronunciation of Kamala for you. I laughed out loud
Everyone is saying "what are we supposed to vote for t*ump now?" Like no ofc not but its also not bad to recognize and understand what harris and biden have done. Honestly no one's going to be happy but just vote for Biden and Harris and understand that they both suck ass
‚Å¶ Dude, you do know, if Biden wins he won‚Äôt take the Oval Office until next January 20, right? Not this November, as you have in this story. Seriously? For shame. And your copy editor should be fired.
The point I'm making is that Biden/Harris have a better chance of helping someone.
Wouldnt someone who champions Biden and the cop be outing themselves as well?
I feel you, I understand the gravity of it all. I can‚Äôt vote for a guy just because he‚Äôs not another guy. So I either stay home, or write in Andrew yang. Biden is more of the same and will usher in someone even worse than Trump
Awesome!!!! GO BIDEN AND HARRIS!!
Netflix is not a propaganda machine? I mean, Obama is part of netflix is he not?  Yes the US (cia..intelligence agencies)have done and allowed some creepy things...u see Trump is cleaning out deep state  pedophiles, thieves like biden, child traffickers...that's why trumps hated
I get Trump‚Äôs an idiot. But this is decency? Biden/Obama invaded Libya illegally, dropped record drone bombs on 7 countries, fueled Syrian/Yemeni conflict with arms and left 100,000 dead brown people. Seriously wondering if humanity doesn‚Äôt extend to non-Americans.
Bleeding liberal here. Biden/Obama admin invaded Libya illegally, dropped record drone bombs on 7 countries, fueled conflict in Yemen and Syria and left 100,000 brown ppl dead. But sure, speaking well is so important you forget about war and murder.
I get you can‚Äôt vote for Trump. I‚Äôm a liberal too. But calling Biden decent and humane? Obama/Biden invaded Libya, drone bombed seven countries in record numbers, fueled Yemen and Syrian conflict and left 100,000 dead brown people. Does your humanity not extend to brown ppl?
No new country was invaded for the first time this century.  The Dems savage Trump for being a ‚Äúthreat to humanity‚Äù  100,000 brown people died from Obama/Biden wars and drone bombing in Libya, Syria &amp; Yemen.  The Dems? Endless praise and voting for more.  Posturing assholes
Yeh...just like the deep state dumbasses biden..Harris...Schumer..Pelosi...r going to "really" change things for the better...this time.. really ? just vote for Trump..do yourself &amp; your family a favor...Trump has done more in 3  years than the last 4 puppets put together, awake!
- Biden is leading in 5 of the top 6 battleground states and the other one he is tied with Trump.   - His current average overall approval rating is 43.4%  If you don‚Äôt believe the polls, okay so be it, but he‚Äôs blatantly making shit up here. Come on now lol be better.
When we read this headline.   BIDEN/HARRIS WIN WHITE HOUSE.
Ok, I had a tear in my eye listening to both speeches. It was hope for what‚Äôs likely to come. Biden was good, but Harris was stellar.
Majority of Americans (even 49% #Democrats) think   would not finish first term if elected  #tcot #gop #migop
Out-of-touch #Democrat  thinks helping Americans through this pandemic equates to war on Social Security  #tcot #gop #migop
After the 50th lie poured out of Biden‚Äôs mouth, I had to change the channel. Therefore never heard a single word Harris had to say; oh well. No loss.
My mistake Cher.  That's supposed to say if there is one. Cher. Do yo think your friend Joe Biden is going to be President? Just curious Cher.  Me I have this really really good feeling that he will be.  And my feelings usually have been accurate. So now do you think he will be?
Kamala Harris won't stop talking about Beau Biden, it's very suspicious that she would spend this much time talking about a dead person. Possible ties to necromancy? - The Gray Fox
Question: Obama/Biden invaded Libya, drone bombed seven countries, fueled conflict in Yemen and Syria and led to 100,000 dead brown people. Does compassion only extend to American people? How can a liberal vote for this warmongering?
I understand you‚Äôre excited. But where‚Äôs the justice for the 100,000 people who died from Obama/Biden invasion into Libya, drone bombing seven countries and fueling arms to destroy Yemen? Does compassion and healing not extend to brown people, Rabbi?
Because, for better or worse, the model is now becoming a major part of the story. You can't reliably model this election, but now people will think Biden has an easy path. They shouldn't, but we know they will, which makes the model a significant variable.
missing major point &gt; the Media is going to be working w Biden Harris - and will cover for them - they will have 98% media support

Please add Joe Biden to the mix.
I'm not gonna pretend that Biden, any dem or a politician is squeaky clean. I'm not naive. That said, we've seen trump enrich himself and his cronies right out in the open. How many of the small business loans went to his friends and himself.
That is frickin halarious. You know Biden could do that cuz clown donald can barely make it off the news conference stage without holding onto a wall or column. Watch trumpy when he exits from a stage. His balance is way off; something not right there.
The truth about Biden's tax plan
This #nastywoman will vote for Biden-Harris 2020. Vote Blue if you‚Äôre Nasty!
Yeah, but is Biden a Slytherin or a Gryffindor? These are the important questions we should be asking.
VP Biden and Sen Harris are both centrist Democrats  ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Without guns maybe Dick wouldn't shoot people by mistake. And...the taxes are mostly on the Rich. The stocks will crash  again in the Fall due to COVID. Biden can't raise taxes anyway until things get better. The GOP takes from the Poor and working poor and gives to the Rich.
I assume I'm considered a "house-wife" since I stay home to raise my son and finish my multiple degrees. But I can say that trump got it very wrong. This "house-wife" (I hate this term) is voting for Biden/Harris!!!
Occultists: I am the embodiment of an ever-changing universe, a supernatural alchemist capable of transmutation of soul, an infinite capacity for change, nothing is beyond my power.  People: We know it's terrible but please vote for Biden/Harris  Occultists: Sorry, can't do it.
Don‚Äôt care for Biden, didn‚Äôt vote for him, blah about Harris, but like to say they‚Äôre the same is a quantum LEAP
I can‚Äôt wait to vote Biden/Harris in November!!!
I was talking to a few of my neighbors last night, they support Biden, and one of them said she worried what white men will think about Harris. I said I don‚Äôt give a shit what white men think, I care about what black women think. #BidenHarris2020
Most Americans r not that stupid, biden? Somatic narcissist dumbass..Harris a covert narcissist mirrors everyone...what? MSM has deceived many to hate Trump...the spirit is called leviathan ...Jezebel/narcissist have this spirit also..it twist truth
Yeh cus it's a joke..lost 9 billion ? The postal service needs to b put into the private sector,so the scum in Washington  like biden..Pelosi, Schumer, Harris, who like to skim the take, b thankful we now have a president who is stopping the  skim, surprised u didn't know that
Typical Donald ü§™. Notice he called her nasty and mean ... he insults all women. I think he meant she was HIS number one pick for Biden. As in "the worst pick".
Attacks on Joe Biden have fallen flat so those hoping for his failure‚Äîprogressives and conservatives alike‚Äîare targeting Kamala Harris with sheer aggression and malice.
55 Things You Need to Know About Kamala Harris - POLITICO
Trump is 3 years younger than Biden..weighs 75 pounds more..Biden can ride a bicycle..Trump would die within 30 seconds trying to ride a bicycle..so the death mongering is ridiculous..
So you don‚Äôt care about the warmongering from Biden/Obama admin that invaded Libya, drone bombed seven countries and led to 100,000 brown people dying? You dont care about dead brown people? you don‚Äôt care about innocents being jailed under Kamala?
Joe Biden is a secret Muslim? What happened? Did Obama secretly convert him? Did Obama convert Biden over to Marxism as well? Is Scranton, PA really part of America? Joe! Where's your birth certificate?
Yes!!!  Is that suppose to scare us? That‚Äôs part of why I am voting for Biden/Harris.
He is, but he also realizes that he needs his voters to support Biden or trump will win again
We are not listening to anything coming from a Biden camp.
The real sad thing about this Biden/Harris ticket is that as a Palestinian there really is no good option for president. Both candidates and their VPs are unabashedly pro-Israel and don't even attempt to hide it with the typical two state solution lines.
‚ÄúGeography matters less than it used to in the general scheme of things,‚Äù Ms. Rizzo said. ‚ÄúShe is the daughter of immigrants. Florida is a state of immigrants.‚Äù Counting on Fl! #BidenHarris2020
Times up for Trump for sure, but a tough on crime prosecutor and Pro Police Biden? Not sure It's going to be a great thing for BLM. Definitely a team that I will be closely evaluating over the next 4 years.

Joe Biden has hired me, "the gray fox", to "steal" the election... Easy for me ..
So many wonderful jobs open for so many wonderful people with the Biden administration üá∫üá∏ #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #VoteBidenHarris2020
Right! Biden proved he‚Äôs a real man.
‚Äú sent word to Biden‚Äôs team that while she was flattered, she no longer wanted to be considered for the running mate slot, according to a high-ranking Democrat familiar with the process. She recommended Biden pick a Black woman‚Äù
Wasn't that long ago Harris said that Biden was a sexist and molested women...so these things are no longer true?
I take it this means Harris no longer believes that Biden is a racist and a sexist...my how opinions change when you're bought off.
You actually asked Joe Biden that Cher? What was his answer? You couldn't be any happier Cher.  Im as happy as a clam or better.

Loved meeting you back in 2018 Abdul. I think you‚Äôre right on this. I hope you also keep forcefully pushing the Biden campaign on Medicare4all since that is one of the main reasons I was a huge supporter of you back then.
Biden had a cheat sheet on his desk so he wouldn‚Äôt forget where he was. Also, is holding the phone upside down. . .
I wince when I hear people who support abolition movements toward ICE and defunding the police cheering on Biden's VP pick, who will set those movements back a generation. #KamalaHarris
You LIAR Biden is not against NRA yes background test and Ar47, etc
Every Dem who has opinion about Biden and Harris:   Shut up.  Shut the fuck up.   You‚Äôre arguing about a fart when someone shit on your white carpet and then walked through it 9,428,016 times.   Grow up.
I know isn't great Cher.  Im so so happy. I tweeted her to send my congratulations to her. Kamala Harris and Joe Biden are to do a great job. In fact they right now doing a great Birthday. Trump is already running scared. He knows that Biden has the upper hand and may just win.
Amen, Jason. Amen. With Biden in the WH, Elizabeth Warren will have her day. Good things ahead. We just need to get out the vote. üá∫üá∏#BidenHarris #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #VoteLikeYourLifeDependsOnIt
Was......Ridin with Biden:-(((( til he chose Krapala
I hope you will run again for Governor of Georgia again or take a Cabinet position in the Biden administration.
I feel like she's a good antithesis to Biden, and that they can round each other out a little more. I think she'll help capture more voters who want somebody with a harder edge.
Not only is  incredibly smart and thoughtful, she‚Äôs a great mentor for so many Latinas in politics. The Biden-Harris team is in good hands! #TheFutureIsLatina
I sincerely hope you will be part of Biden administration in order to bring back the level of intelligence, dignity, moral character and honesty this country enjoyed during the Obama years, then we can truly make America again.
I want the two party system dismantled and new people brought into office more than anything, but when our currently leader is beginning to mimic HITLER? there‚Äôs only so much you can do.  I will be voting Biden and Harris in November, because I‚Äôm scared not to. you should be to.
This isn't the first time that the GOP has outright lied about what our candidates have said. Just the other day, Michigan Republicans said that Biden wants to defund the police‚Äìwhen he has literally said the opposite in a June 10th Op. Ed.
I'm sick of people telling me to vote for Biden because he can be dragged to the left. The DNC rigged 2 primaries to avoid progressive policy. They sure as hell aren't going to cave to it when they are in power! #VoteGreen2020 #GreenMovement #DemExit2020
I already know Biden/Harris isn‚Äôt the most ideal ticket right now. I voted for Bernie Sanders and I held out hope Biden would choose Warren as his VP. Don‚Äôt want to hear any negativity now. I just want you to vote for #BidenHarris so we can #DumpTrump
Remember when Trump told Chris Wallace there‚Äôs no enthusiasm for Biden. Keep thinking that, big guy.
If you are spending today not criticizing the literal warmonger Biden who invaded Libya, drone bombed seven countries and left behind 100,000 dead brown people, quit with your social media posturing.Well I would sure like to hear about the Biden plan.  And you are wrong about why I don‚Äôt blame Trump.  I don‚Äôt blame him because I voted for him.  I don‚Äôt blame him because he didn‚Äôt cause this crisis, and he‚Äôs doing a great job.
Trumps ineffective leadership has worsened the crisis? I haven‚Äôt heard the Biden plan or the Pelosi plan, which would have produced a better outcome or saved more lives.   It‚Äôs ignorant to bash Trump without offering your own better idea.
Ever seen a Biden supporter use a dead baby in a jar as a stage prop for a fake religious ceremony campaign video?  Neither have I.
Endorsing Biden like this is an interesting strategy
I‚Äôm attending ONECampaign for Michigan‚Äôs event, ‚ÄúFINAL DAY: Westland Virtual Convention Watch Party During Joe Biden's Keynote Address!‚Äù ‚Äì sign up now to join me!
Governors and Joe Biden have to realize you work for the people and the people that are like you guys are old farts the majority don‚Äôt elect you people
Oh man Joe Biden and Dr. Fauci can both go to Old folks home
Who is the world with Joe Biden becomes president and this Camila they‚Äôre going to ruin the United States of America
The enthusiasm for Donald Trump is absolutely amazing his supporters do all this on their own. I don‚Äôt hear much from Biden except a dumb add where he said he‚Äôs gonna do everything that Trump has already done. He is such an ass.
prosecutors, the American people either never gets the Putin vaccine or it just turns out to be a hoax and the trillions of  $$ to Putin was to let tRump stay in Russia. Epilogue: the Biden administration puts crippling sanctions on Putin and Putin blames tRump and bye bye tRump!
Coming to a whitehouse near you soon JOE BIDEN. Champion of the people bringing law and order to our nation. Stay tuned for the arrests of tRump and his sycophants that have attempted to overthrow our democracy and surpress voting in our country. Prison for them all.
let‚Äôs be real here, Biden only picked Kamala Harris because she smelled better than the other possible candidates. #BidenHarris #KamalaHarrisForVP
But yet this is ok
I think there is enough disaffected progressives/liberals because of the Joe Biden, Kamala Harris ticket who would vote for Trump if he pardoned Edward Snowden.
man just the other day I saw some shithead trend on Twitter going on and on about how Joe Biden can ride a bike and Donald Trump probably can't  wow liberals  I'm sure Biden's cardio is gonna save us all
She would become  a  virtual dictator should she and Biden win. She needs to be defeated at all costs. America will cease to exist should they win. And they don't have a dog's chance as Paul "Mr. Wonderful " Orndorf would say.
Joe Biden is the right guy to coordinate the rehab of our government. I hope he calls on all the living ex-Presidents for council, and expect he will.  He is also the right man to take Trump out behind the woodshed &amp; make sure he faces consequences. 2/5
Is this the right ticket for right now?  Yes. Yes, it is.   Joe Biden is the right man to apologize to our allies for Trump.  He has the right motivations &amp; respect. He is doing this for Beau. And he is doing this for the American people. He has the relationships &amp; sincerity. 1/5
Biden actually did help right the 1994 crime bill. It‚Äôs a valid critique. But at least he now acknowledges the issues of the justice system unlike who we have now. So his statement is bull.
Didn‚Äôt the USPS workers union endorse Biden/Harris?  I‚Äôm sure they will just do their jobs and not be biased in any manner ü•¥
She‚Äôll be the kiss of death to Biden campaign.
Man, I can't believe Biden said that shit üò°üò°üò°
Historically vice president were opposites to their president. Really thats all she needs to say of she wants to keep the narrative that there is really any substantial difference between her and biden, or between them and Republicans for that matter. They're the same. Viels off.
Ignore him.  He‚Äôs trying to steal attention away from Biden &amp; Harris.
I'm pressuring Joe Biden to support liberal policies by attacking anyone who criticizes or pressures Joe Biden into supporting liberal policies.
crawl on my hands and knees over broken glass to get to the polls and vote for Biden/Harris.
If you want to see Trump defeated in November, spare a couple of dollars for the Lincoln Project.  Their ads are stronger than anything the Biden campaign dare put out there.
I agree.  A majority in my state decided to change the law to allow all voters to vote by mail if they choose. I am 70 years old and was counting on voting by mail in November. Now, I plan to risk my health to go to the polls to ensure my Biden/Harris vote counts no matter what
Much needed change when Biden and Harris win  the ticket. And there is no longer the likes of people like you wandering the peoples White House halls any more.
Maybe you should get someone to read this to you since you're unaware of it. It's Joe Biden's iPad on January 27th regarding the pandemic
OMG I'm listening to you right now read your notes about Biden ignoring scientific evidence regarding the virus and following left-wing liberals. You need to listen to yourself.. you're the one trying to stop testing to keep number low to let people die.

That may be true, but the goal is to keep Biden from being elected. What do we do RIGHT NOW?!
She's just Biden her time 'til November.
What Joe Biden and that lady one state to make it mandatory to wear mask is taking your rights away once you take your rights away from that they‚Äôll go after the other right they‚Äôll be able to come in your home at any time they want
Joe Biden that lady can shut their mouth they don‚Äôt have the right to tell people what to do this is not a Third World country we we can do what we want we don‚Äôt have to wear a mask if we don‚Äôt want
Lol, the Dems are already getting rid of Biden?
President? So you know that Biden is a place holder???
Ask her about how she thought Biden was a creep, you know before she was selected to run with him
I wonder where the enthusiasm is for Biden.
real unfortunate that a vote for anyone other than trump is a vote for biden :-/
Biden already released a statement trying to help take credit for it. Now that's hilarious.
friendly reminder that donald trump used to donate to democratic political campaigns. most notably hillary clinton, joe biden, and kamala harris üôÉ
Disappointed by losing his Zionist backers, disappointed Adelson hasn't donated yet, and frustrated Israeli leaders say they will accept a Biden win, Trump delivered this prize to Israel in hopes of regaining Zionist votes.
This is nothing.. today someone replied to me saying.. Biden will be weak on COVID not like Trump... ( I‚Äôm guessing he/she works for the virus team, maybe??)
I told my 8yo daughter that when Biden gets elected, we will have our first female VP.  She was so excited.
Joe Biden will be 78 in November.
During the primaries, Biden and Harris were probably my last 2 choices for who I wanted to get the nominations. I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm a huge fan of the ticket. But you have to be delusional to still be able to turn a blind eye to all the garbage from the other side of the aisle.
Nah. This is a big deal:    This is a bigger deal:
What Trump is doing is wrong wrong wrong.  If mail in voting is made unsafe by this madman, I will crawl over broken glass and risk COVID to vote for Biden/Harris.  Trump will be a one term wrecking ball.
Joe Biden Picks Kamala Harris for VP | Sterling K. Brown #theDailyShowWithTrevorNoahEarsEdition   via
A presidential primary campaign and many hit pieces from leftist breitbart dot com later, and it‚Äôs seen as ‚Äúthe sky is falling‚Äù for progressives when Joe Biden picks Harris has his running mate
I think so also. Both of them have a personality or character flaw that's out to destroy. I remember Biden's debate with Paul Ryan. Biden was vicious &amp; I think Kamala will be like that also. They are the combination that, if elected, will bring down America. Voters remember this.
Pushing the left even farther away with your ‚Äúsuck it up‚Äù and vote for Biden/Harris strategy.
She did not make a threat, she made a statement that isn't too far fetched since Biden is very old &amp; fraile now &amp; can hardly put 2 sentences together.
Hmm ok these are bad policies to back, so I probably wouldn't be a fan of hers or Biden, but I'm going to vote for them this upcoming election so that we don't end up with Trump
Biden doesn't know where he is. I'd be embarrassed to defend him. #WheresHunter
I just want to see how the Liberals act to the critics that talk about Harris having descendants that owned slaves . Also about her accusing Biden being a sexual harasser &amp; now he‚Äôs the cats meow . If this was a conservative, the Libs would be marching &amp; crying .Tad hypocritical
Watching her spew one lie after another is laughable.  She is a lot like Joe Biden, because just like Basement Joe she is also delusional and detached from reality.
Kamala Shaves Head In Preparation For Meeting With Biden  via
We are going to have a Conservative majority in November. You sex workers should vote for Trump. Because under a socialist regime of Biden and Harris you will no longer be making money. You will have your financial assets seized by the government.
It will be funny when the Biden,Harris campaign talks about trump and his family donations to Kamala
Please can we all just agree to vote for Biden/Harris. Please. I don‚Äôt care if he‚Äôs not the perfect choice but really, he‚Äôs the better one. Get this fucking tangerine out of the spotlight.
So explain Biden today? What's that, you can't? Congrats on becoming a complete hack.
He is a known commodity. Obama remains the countries most popular President and Biden was a part of that.
What a disgusting Whiskey voiced hag.  Fox News host baselessly claims that 'something's going to happen' to Joe Biden, forcing her colleague to walk her comment back  via
On March 16, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden made an unprecedented promise mid-debate: to choose a woman as his running mate, no matter what.    ‚òùÔ∏è
And that‚Äôs the reason people like you . Cannot come into power . I predict you will leave Washington in a pine box . With that bobble head for Soros Biden and Obama. You will reap what you sew. Tread lightly
Did i say conservatives are good? I just don‚Äôt like socialists that weaponize race to their advantage. If you don‚Äôt vote for Biden you‚Äôre not black üëçüèº
Say trump and Biden are switched in this situation. What do you think people like you and liberal media‚Äôs would do with information. The DNC, hypocrisy at its finest.
Every woman I know who lives in the suburbs (it's not 1957, dude) thinks you are contemptible and is voting Biden/Harris.
Joe Biden and this lady are only going to screw our country up
Joe Biden and this lady don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about people need to open their eyes excuse me Black people are not the only people on this planet
Oh yeah Joe Biden and Obama stopped a bola
Dude this lady accused Joe Biden of being racist before?
Do people actually believe that Joe Biden will do anything for the United States he‚Äôll do nothing but raise taxes trumps done more for us
Joe Biden says he‚Äôll fix the country what it yeah race Texas defund the military take away your Second Amendment and then there goes your head remember right you people have to realize he is he is not going to be in control he‚Äôs just a puppet
I‚Äôd like to watch my news not Joe Biden he thinks people are crazy if they‚Äôre going to get rid of the Second amendment of people that allow Will not allow it
Joe Biden I could give you shit you don‚Äôt need no money need to go to an old folks home
I‚Äôd like to watch my News not see old man Biden on my TV screen I don‚Äôt like him go to an old folks home
Not voting for Joe Biden or you just screw the United States up
And I agree but a vote for Biden just because of him being ‚Äúthe lesser evil‚Äù isn‚Äôt going to make our country any better sure historically third parties don‚Äôt win but who says we can‚Äôt change that?
Our President Biden has never done anything like that.  Lies. We know this. So look to your tin god Trump.
Well Joe Biden becomes president there goes the world higher taxes higher food military lower military cuts and then will probably get taken over by another country
Man am I bummed Biden didn't pick Marianne Williamson.
Just read that Giuliani's daughter has endorsed Biden/Harris.

Watching Joe Biden school Sarah Palin in 2002 was a historical high point in politics.  Pence vs Harries is going to be the pinnacle! Never have we seen 2 candidates so unevenly matched. I cannot wait to see Harris decimate Pence. I hope he cries.

She locked up more poor blacks on petty drug charges than almost any other prosecutor in the US. And who made that possible for her? Joe Biden.
It wasn't that long ago when the Democrats had 24 choices.  They voted for Biden.  Sanders and Williamson supporters now have three choices: Biden, Trump or throw away your vote.  Compare Biden to Trump and make your own decision.
maybe its because every democrat has run on reducing freedom of religion, and taking away at least some guns.  Biden and Kamala both have.
According to Trump, Biden will hurt God. So Biden is powerful.
You will raise taxes greatly and billionaires will leave and take their money with them. Sorry, Mr. Biden.
God, I wish Biden and Harris were half as radical as these hysterical right-wingers like to pretend
You have sat on your very large and prominent perdonker dunk and murdered 170,000 innocent Americans. Your inaction killed a lot of suburban mothers children and loved ones. These wonderful suburban women will vote for BIDEN/HARRIS to save this country from you.
Not surprised Biden picked Kamala Harris for VP, because before you fuck kids, you gotta lock their parents up. #BidenHarris2020 #SniffEmNFuckEm2020
THE #Democrat Party stood for racism long before Trump switched to the Republican Party and put AMERICA first.  While Biden still thinks China "isn't so bad". China is pulling for a Biden Inc. to win. Where's Hunter?
Lmao. And just like that the Biden Campaign gives up on a state with a population less than than the city of Detroit. And there goes a whopping 3 electoral votes. Lol.
And now the of rest  the story, China Joe will be unable or unwilling to mount a campaign. IF Biden INC won't debate, where will the #Democrat Party be? Harris campaign was at 2%, TWICE what Hunter's father's 1%. Economy MUST fail, schools CANT't open.  Or Trump will WIN WIN WIN!
God damn it, my dad is gonna ask me any day if "you SJWs are happy about Biden's VP pick"
Oh really. Cry me a river, knuckle draggers.
A sign of the times. Remote meetings. Glad to Biden is a Apple guy.
Instead of Trump Ag bribes that solve few problems, and are skewed to ag industrialization, let‚Äôs have a real plan to address the core problems that confront retaining the family farm.  Kamala Harris joining Biden ticket is a win for rural Iowa and farmers

I thought Biden would pick nitWhitmer because she has less baggage than others
Trump campaign tweets mugshots of alleged criminals, all of them Black, to claim Biden is pro-crime  via   Trump's entire staff is criminal and they are all walking free to include HIM
I mean she also called Biden a racist very recently if were gonna go fact digging around irrelevancies. Oh wait one deals with donations to an attorney general and the other deals with the fact that the newly appointed Democratic VP candidate called her running partner a racist.
But that same woman called Biden a racist as well ü§î interesting
a RW hold on the SCOTUS for a generation if RBG retires, corporate control on policy, increased income inequality, loss of 1st am rights &amp; police reform are on the ballot not just Biden&amp; Trump. Purity tests &amp; disillusion arent justification enough to risk the suffering 45 causes.
So 2020 election is boutta be Joe Biden/ Kamala Harris or Trump/Pence,,,-
"Joe Biden is a racist!" - Kamala Harris
"Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate"
So if voting independent is a vote for Trump or a vote for Biden, then why vote independent at all? They don't want you to cause its easier to divide, control, and conquer when it's two.
At this point, he would simply look like a copycat.  Still, I always thought he would if Biden did, so maybe.
i hate that biden and harris and trump and pence are our only god damn options i hate america

Biden campaign statement/announcement on VP pick
Trump campaign &amp; RNC statements on Biden‚Äôs VP pick, Sen. Kamala Harris:
is rattled.    President Trump blasts Biden‚Äôs VP pick, Kamala Harris, as 'meanest, most horrible, most disrespectful' senator
Biden's been around about 40 years in politics, including VP. Still waiting for the fierce leadership.
Keep in mind everyone that during the biggest racial uprising since the late 60‚Äôs, the  is going with the Author of the crime bill in Joe Biden which unjustly targeted and incarcerated vast numbers of minorities in this country.   And...
Those who will still not find relief in a Biden/Harris administration.
please. i don‚Äôt care how you feel about biden or kamala harris. PLEASE don‚Äôt vote third party. get trump out of office
Biden should not agree to a debate until Obese Orange releases his taxes
Agreed. That being true, I would vote for her over Trump or Biden in a heartbeat.
She isn‚Äôt my first choice. Neither is Biden.   But I do respect her &amp; believe she will make a great leader, when it comes to that.  Also, she‚Äôs 55, so if she does a great job &amp; earns our votes, she might provide a steady &amp; capable presence in DC for the next 12 years.
I saw your grandson Owen at the local pitch  n‚Äô putt. Was upset to see the Apple had fallen far from the tree. He wore a shirt that said ByeDon! Libtard can‚Äôt even spell Biden!
Plus I heard.  ( not sure if it's true or not yet.) Biden said a while back, "He needed a vice president that can take charge an control. When he quits 6 months after being elected."
If Joe Biden becomes president we have to look for higher taxes business is shutting down the virus is spreading more higher cost-of-living going up in peoples paycheck not going up he is Do not elect him as president
Is Joe Biden choosing a black woman to Con Black people down?
Vote for Biden! Wink, wink.
While I would have preferred Elizabeth Warren as VP, I respectfully disagree with your assessment. I think independents and Never Trumpers are more than fine with Harris. If a conservative academic still prefers Trump over Biden/Harris IMO they were a lost cause to begin with.
If people actually believe these commercials that are run by Joe Biden blaming the president Donald Trump for everything they‚Äôre not using common sense
You just don‚Äôt like trump Joe Biden is too old

The Kamala Harris VP pick will make liberal suburban wine moms happy but is probably the nail in the coffin for a widespread progressive vote.
At this point "can they speak coherent sentences" is the bar. I don't think Biden/Harris is perfect, but it's fine for now (I would've preferred Warren).   Also, glad he didn't pick Whitmer b/c we need her to stick around Michigan.
welp, there it is. I‚Äôm in for the Biden/Harris and I‚Äôm not happy about it

Awww poor Stretchin‚Äô Gretchen!  Well shit, I‚Äôm not voting for Biden, I‚Äôll tell u that right now. No way am I changing Kamala Harris becoming president.
Great choice Joe! Biden/Harris 2020
üö® Joe Biden selects California Senator and former Presidential candidate Kamala Harris as his vice presidential running mate.  #KHive | #2020Election
Whitmer.will be offered a cabinet job if Biden wins
Before that you will see Biden is smashed by Trump
Joe Biden is too old and I don‚Äôt even think he knows where he is at time or what day it is
I‚Äôm getting tired old man Biden go to a retirement home all man
#BREAKING The Vice President spot on the democratic ticket will be  she is  pick.
I‚Äôm in for Biden-Harris. #BidenHarris2020
Biden Harris 2020 officially. Great choice
Biden supporters don‚Äôt give a shit about what offends Trump.
First they have to pass the Biden Basset smell test
‚ÄúIt got so bad Joe Biden went on a bike ride the other day with a mask on‚Äù ignored the reporter that was so close to him Biden had to ride around him! And that he was riding in a group and SS detail must stay within 6 feet to protect him. So yes Biden was appropriate to wear one!
TEXT OU812 to find out FIRST who is DEFINITELY MAYBE going to be Biden's VP
I used too. I admit it. Now I wave it proudly with my Biden 2020 yard sign. We're all Patriots.
Love Biden the way I love Obama!  I will fight for him all the way!
Love Biden!  üíôüíôüíô
Seeing that there are more Women voters than Men I would say this is just another colossally stupid statement. Mentioning Race is just typical racist trump.  Trump claims ‚Äòmen are insulted‚Äô because Biden might pick a Black woman vice president

I would love a Biden/Harris ticket!
My God, Politco really is putting hit pieces on every VP candidate aren't they. None of the main contenders, especially not Kamala or Whitmer would cost Biden any state. It's crazy to say and think that would happen. People vote for the nominee, not the running mate.
It's very possible this isn't related to Biden, but if it is, I have no idea what this means. Maybe a speech together? Maybe Cabinet meetings. Maybe recording something for the Convention? South Bend is also really close to Michigan, so maybe it's not even Pete.  No idea.
They won't announce the VP until after they announce Biden's replacement!
According to who?
Maybe Joe Biden will use the Toimb of the Unknown Soldier.    I am not serious but can you imagine the backlash that would  happen?
basically anyone but Biden would be a lock LOL the guy cant do press
Also, in case you haven't noticed, Bernie is working with Biden.
I think it's important for this country to survive and that only happens if Trump is not in control of this country.  Frankly if you think Trump and Biden are the same, you are WAY not paying attention.  Biden earned votes. Obviously Bernie didn't, or he'd be the nominee.
Boo hoo. Where has Bernie been during the BLM protests?  Kamala has been out there protesting, and working her ass off.  For her record, the receipts have been brought time and again to prove stories on her are wrong. I'm voting Biden no matter who is VP is. Can you say the same?
I seen the fist Biden sign near me and it‚Äôs a big banner I was shocked to see next time I drive past I‚Äôll get a picture
This is the only part of their base that has any energy to it. They need it, because Biden is doing nothing for any of them. Everytime Biden talks, Trump gains voters back. This is all they got.
All Lies  nice try and keep watching CNN and other networks that just bush the Liberal agenda.  Biden = Communism!!!  The True Russia hoax.
is / was an  advisor to Joe Biden for the debates.
Biden is also for cutting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.
You just feel stupid because Biden's actually saying racist crap. We don't have to spin it.
Biden is covered with Byrd droppings
Who tf is confident in Biden lol
Well this is where you lose me as your fan. You will lose your ability to make money under a Joe Biden dictatorship. Trump is the one that can save America as we know it . Let me say this any openly lefty Trans will not be supported by me. I rather not know your politics.
I wouldn't mind you following me, you being a  Wrestling fan. Had you not openly declared yourself for Biden and against Trump. Such stupidity by someone following my account will not be tolerated without a rebuttal. So consider yourself rebutted. Have a nice day.
Your  hero  Barack Obama (who's the actual heel along with Biden and virtually the entire Democratic Party) you want to use wresting terminology for this current e? Then Trump &amp; his supporters are the Faces, the heroes.
Biden is such an ass even his campaign ads he talks about doing everything that Trump has already done you mean to tell me people watching the ads don‚Äôt know that?
Since the Trump campaign is endlessly running the ad where Mr. Biden says something stupid, will this recording come up during the race? During the debates?  Trump On Tape: I Grab Women "By The Pu**y‚Äù  via
All the more reason we don't want nor need Joe Biden.
Amy I don't care who he picks. What I want is for everyone to stand and vote for Biden no matter who he picks. Cable news will dissect her to death. Ugh!
Oxygen? Here‚Äôs Joe Biden riding a bike...when was the last time Trump‚Äôs fat ass got on a bike?
These EO's are dead on arrival on Monday. But here's a thought for the brainless Magat's. For laughs let's say this walking colostomy bag gets away with this. When Jan 20th comes Biden by EO can erase the Cap on SS. Repeal all of trumps tax law. Make space force disappear..
We know that. Milano is a Biden supporter. What do you expect.
Awww.. poor dear.  Did someone ruffle Trump‚Äôs reputation?  Deservedly so..  Kanye has admitted that it‚Äôs only to pull votes for Biden, so...
So when are we gonna find out who is Biden's running mate?
I'm sure Biden will not have any boat parades.
Biden supports basically none of the policies that Sanders supports and from the bottom up any dumb fucking asshole who insists otherwise knows nothing about them beyond their name and listed party. Just sad that one of those fucks is the president...
Text TRUMP to 88022! I stand with
I hope she can. Because quite frankly under Biden and his  minions we will all have less freedom to do just about anything including you  Arielle Scarcella. My one hope is that you vote for Trump in November and save America as you know it. Because  the new America would be scary
Madam Speaker, why are the 2 Rep's that are helping Putin funnel negative propaganda about Biden still allowed to serve on the senate?  When are you all gonna hold Trump and his gang accountable for their treasonous acts, and not to mention the Kanye fiasco....Enough us enough!!
Calling it, by fall, there will be a real effort by the trump campaign to pull "youth support" away from Biden.
I believe what we see happening at the hands of Repubs is by design...a long game with big money and foreign power behind it.  If Biden wins and Dems hold the House and take the Senate, they will find a smoldering pile of ash left by Repubs because that's how they play.

Michigan republicans would vote for Biden to get Whitmer out of Michigan
Get Biden for America.. #Biden_is_Trump_vaccineA vote for Biden is a vote for Pizza....Disgusting and Sick!!
Michigan here...Yet to see a Biden sign.
I would much rather vote for Howie than Biden.  At the same time - I want to try and build solidarity with progressive Dems who are skeptical of 3rd party voters and the "far left" in general.  Indie voters need to organize precinct by voting precinct and do exit polls.
Lol. Okay!  Biden smeared Anita Hill for Thomas and then... didn't vote for him? So much better.  As for Scalia - being a respected jurist does not mean we want Democrats to nominate or approve right-wing conservative justices.
(granted the DNC is corrupt)  but think about how many trump signs you see vs biden or even bernie signs...  conservatives *blindly* scream loudler.... maybe we should learn that lesson
These people need to start looking at Biden's actual platform. Obama ran further to the right.
She's right. I'm dumb. I stewed before donating to Lincoln Project. I'm sick that I did.  I don't know how to reconcile this with my absolute belief that Trump will be reelected. I don't believe "progressives" will show up for Biden/Harris, but I'm convinced anti-Trump Rs will.
Gosh, I am frequently shocked and occasionally appalled by  comments on  but ‚Äúidiot‚Äù is not a word I would use to describe him. On the other hand, ‚Äúsenile‚Äù is a word I would use to describe Mr. Biden. Sorry if my opinion, which this is, upsets anyone.
Then... *my fears are* (fraudulent) evidence is presented linking Obama/Biden to attempting to "sabotage" the election, indicating them for "treason"...
"I'm Joe Biden and I approve this message".
You talking about someone looking strong and is ready to go to work? JOE BIDEN!! #BidenHarris2020
If you mean covid, that falls apart with the reality Biden can barely function and Harris couldn't even keep the LAPD in check, so I doubt she could keep a pandemic in check. Outside of that, you're wrong. Thanks for playing
That's what's weird. I haven't voted GOP since I don't remember when (I'm old) but only Trump is slamming my inboxes. Where is Biden's campaign? Where will this "landslide" come from if their campaign doesn't lift a finger out in the streets?
"...Biden's choice decision to choose " is very GOP.
A shout out to all the #vbnmw people for continually reminding me that any vote other than a vote for #biden is in fact a vote for #trump !  Gee I never realized this!  I don‚Äôt know how I can ever repay you for your incredible insight!!
I have, I follow it every day.  It means my life and well being.  Trump and his administration has been extremely detrimental to trans people.  Most recently, the trans gender health protections.  So much more malicious than what biden will do.
I do not agree. Biden is stronger than you think, and is backed by stronger people still.
You might want to update the headline on that June story instead of just adding an editor's note to it:
Why the hell would Biden do this? Trump sinks deeper by talking because he's an incoherent, lying, narcissist. Biden would be foolish to help Trump.
Vote Biden/Harris, the rest will follow. There are ways to vote absentee or ‚Äúmail-in‚Äù in most states without actually having to use USPS. In-person pick-up and drop-off ballots are county clerk or elections offices.
But neither obama or biden want to remove trans rights.  The damage trump did to me and other trans people has been way worse than anything obama did.  And do you really think biden's picks for the SC will vote to remove abortion rights?  Trumps will.
Especially you still trying to decide if you are gonna vote Biden
He would veto Medicare for all but trump is worse so I‚Äôm voting for Biden but I won‚Äôt tell people biden is great because I don‚Äôt think that is true.
I think Biden is terrible but trump is an existential threat so I‚Äôm settling for Biden.
When, and if, Biden debates, it will be all over.
Kami Is Lying....President Trump will Not Allow Anything or Anyone to touch SS...Also, Kami is very far left, her and Biden are for Baby Murder even at full term. A Vote for Them Is A Vote For Evil
Biden wins, I will come back here after the election and say "Deborah rocks is and is all knowing. I pledge loyalty to her from now on." - If Trump wins, you say "Trump is so sexy"
I saw some stats about the groups of Americans who support Biden vs trump today. You would think they would have an awakening after being labeled ‚Äúuneducated, white‚Äù üòñ
Or suck off Bobby at work 4 benefits bc that's what somebody else decided 2 do &amp; laughed about it during an interview on the News. Biden picks the most disliked woman more then Hillary. He had other choices.They knew about Willie Brown &amp; Kamala going downtown ü§∑ can't help that

I thought they delayed it because of the excitement of  the Biden/Harris ticket. I have LOL ‚Äòd at the attempts to say she is not a valid candidate.  It‚Äôs like he doesn‚Äôt have a new playbook.  It‚Äôs also fun watching Harris chew them up and spit them out.

If your not voting for President Trump because you don't like him, then thats like eating a dog turd because you don't like broccoli. If you are voting for Joe Biden because you think he's a moderate Democrat, then that's like eating a dog turd because someone told you to.
Kanye is Trumps and Kushners house N-word. Do you really think they are persuading him to run so West can win? Of course not...run house N-word, draw votes from Biden-Harris and watch Trump continue to decimate Black and Brown communities that he has done virtually nothing for.
No, it's not over the top of you understand history and frankly I grew up when a worst president was given two terms. And my apparent goals keep getting destroyed by people like Biden &amp; harris
Biden used a small vetting team to help decide his VP pick.
And THAT is only going to help Biden/Kamala. Your vote would be wasted. Please don't do that with November's vote!
Yeah, they found the DA had done NOTHING WRONG except the fact he was investigating the company where Biden's son worked. He was NOT CORRUPT like Joe had stated he was!
See what President Trump's son, Eric says about Biden's pick for VP.
At least a Biden Cabinet will reflect what America is, not who look and act like Trump. Competent people.
I am truly concerned this is a small step and foreshadowing to potential attempts at Obama/Biden indictments. The concurrent and impending corruption from this Administration just kills.
Biden didn‚Äôt pick anything. He can‚Äôt form coherent sentences.
I think its gonna be a landslide win start to finish, no questions asked ass kickin by Biden/Harris, the country is sooo sick of this shit n want change

I‚Äôm not clear - is the suggestion that if Biden wins, he will force a federal policy of using prisoners for work crews? I thought that was only a California thing, not national.
He's got to be younger than Biden and Trump?
Y‚Äôall finna bait me into voting for Biden/Harris and then when I later on critique Biden/Harris y‚Äôall gonna go ‚Äúbut you still voted for them tho ü§™‚Äù and I‚Äôm not going.
Biden, while horrible, at least doesn‚Äôt have a track record of election fraud and voter suppression; it‚Äôll be easier to primary him then to get Trump out after four more years of advancing overt fascism.
I see a number if people saying to vote third party and oh but Biden/Harris will be just as bad as Trump and I just shake my head and assume they are bots because LIKE IT OR NOT THIS COUNTRY IS ESSENTIALLY A TWO PARTY SYSTEM. SUCK IT UP AND VOTE (2/?)
Right! They just might get cussed out by Biden or Harris, and I‚Äôll be here for it! A bully needs to get popped real good in his mouth to get back! #Kamala
Where in the world is Joe Biden?
Uh, no. People ONLY wear masks when at supermarkets. Outside just walking nobody cares. If the mandate Biden talks about requires me to wear a mask when going out for a run, I won‚Äôt comply bc I have been doing it for 4 months without an issue
are you struggling to say VOTER SUPPRESSION because that‚Äôs exactly what Trump is doing by handicapping #USPS! I just can‚Äôt wait to see how y‚Äôall give President Joe Biden the benefit if the doubt as you struggle to report on the criminal in the WH! Geez.

Campaigns usually preview their priority for major legislation, as Obama did with stimulus &amp; ACA. But Biden has been mostly negative &amp; event responsive so far (now mostly focused on COVID &amp; economy), so unclear how that would translate beyond whatever doesn‚Äôt pass from HEROES

Trump, Biden has to have more control of the system.  Trump just wants to give it oxygen.

The moral of the story is the planets and the sun they orbit are not in exact geometric proportions. It‚Äôs chaotic, and held together with gravity.   It‚Äôs a fucking miracle, and we‚Äôre lucky to be aware of the universe.   We would do well to vote for Biden and push his ass to ...

Sexist and racist????? Uhm didn't you dumbocrats openly pick the senator because of gender and race???? The associated press reported Gov. Whitmer even suggested to Biden that he should pick a black woman. So who is being sexist and racist again? The hippocracy is overflowing.
Jim Clyburn‚Äôs endorsement swung the SC vote totals emphatically enough to make Biden the frontrunner‚Äîand eventually, the nominee.   Biden bet his whole race on that. Bernie crossed his fingers and hoped enough leftists would turn out nationwide that it wouldn‚Äôt make a difference.
Warren‚Äôs polices were much better than Bernie‚Äôs and she got called a snake. The platform Biden‚Äôs eventually going to run with will have a lot of important planks‚Äîmany out there by Sanders and Warren staffers.  If leftists call it ‚Äúshit‚Äù and don‚Äôt vote? Just makes change harder.
Joe Biden is not ‚Äúextremely conservative‚Äù lol
They want him removed because he has outlived his usefulness to them. They got their judges, now they want to discard trump and find a candidate that might have a chance to beat Biden. They just have to find someone who is just as big a tool as trump, without a side of dementia.
Joe biden sucks but trump is an existential threat to democracy so I am settling for Biden. #settleforbiden

I think 2016 is a much better example of Bernie being cheated. This primary election, the moderate candidates simply consolidated behind Biden before Super Tuesday and the moderates outnumbered the progressives within the party
ahhh okay I misunderstood a tiny bit there. Yeah its weird that people will broadly support policies M4A (58% of primary voters in SC supported it but the state went for Biden for example) and I'd be interested in understanding why that disparity exists
I agree with all of these things as well. Im voting Biden because I think we have the best shot of getting those things under that administration and not our current one. But it's also true that a lot of Americans ARE very moderate and this ticket reflects that.
also some people dont look at policy for voting unfortunately. People recognize Biden from the Obama administration and want to return to an era of "stability", rather than pressing forward into unknown territory (socialistic policies) because they want to maintain their comfort
but the primaries are the opportunity for people to express this type of support. In Michigan, Biden won EVERY COUNTY. This is due to low voter turnout from our age bracket (18-28 voter turnout is 16%) skewing the country further right/moderate than what it should/could be.
Who I think Biden will pick for his cabinet IF he wins:  1. Secretary of State: Susan Rice 2. Secretary of the Treasury: Elizabeth Warren 3. Secretary of Defense: Pete Buttigieg 4. Attorney General: Val Demmings 5. Secretary of the Interior: Jamie Rappaport Clark
Trump organizers are knocking on doors and holding in-person events in Michigan, but  told me today Democrats don't feel its "practical or smart" to do the same for  just yet.
precisely. I just think it'll take a bit more time for the American populace to be "primed" for a socialistic/social democrat political leaning/president/etc. I can't be mad about Biden/Kamala because imo its much closer to reflecting the majority of Americans and their leanings
So we all know Trumps a POS...  and Biden‚Äôs held office for 40+ years and hasn‚Äôt created any type of change...  how did we get to this point again of voting for what YOU believe is to be the ‚Äúlesser of two evils‚Äù VOTE THIRD PARTY #Joforpresident
Despite the OBVIOUSLY BULLSHIT that prisons have stocks and therefore are used for profit by pure common sense economics... It should worry people that we can‚Äôt let the Biden administration get away with this shit if he wins either. We are settling for Biden but we can‚Äôt leave 1/
Public university grads can do anything - including run for President, Vice President, and Governor.
The senior Biden advisor (&amp; former Bernie spox) cont'd:   "Wayne County are Black Voters. So, while the majority of the electorate in Michigan are not Black voters obviously we have to do real work in speaking to Black voters in Michigan‚Äîparticularly in Wayne Co." #Election2020
As a real Christian, I'm offended that you are attacking Biden (Catholic) &amp; Harris (Baptist) as if your White Evangelical/Gnostic/Judaizer cult is of Jesus Christ. It's not &amp; you aren't of Christ. You don't support life as you support the Trump demonic leadership reign
They‚Äôre serving the broader coalition, which is necessary not only to enact progressive policy to defeat the literal actual fascism staring us in the face.   I think Biden‚Äôs a poor candidate, &amp; his nomination is a failure of the party. But I‚Äôd like there to be a 2024 election, so
Joe Biden just said yesterday Trump is causing chaos in the world   Today Trump announces peace in the Middle East

Views of Harris are unlikely to move voters or voter blocs, but could change impressions of Biden; prior running mates have had minimal &amp; fleeting top-line effects but have changed or mollified voters‚Äô concerns about presidential candidates
Kamala Harris is a disgusting enabler.
It's pretty self explanatory to ANYBODY paying actual attention that Biden can barely string together a coherent sentence
She didn't threaten him. U ppl R freakin idiots. Do you have a thought of your own? ITS ABOUT BIDENS MENTAL DECLINE that Democrats will replace Biden with Harris &amp; he won't be on the ticket anymore. She did sleep her way 2 the top so it's not unlikely

Harris is the first Black woman on a major party's presidential ticket, and she and Biden noted the historical significance.
Do you think liberals will learn anything about electability when leftists don't vote for Biden in droves?

According to a business I frequent once a week,  opinion was, won't vote TRUMP 2020. NEVER VOTE FOR BIDEN. It's Kanye or not vote for President. Just keep that vote untouched. Exactly, what GOP WANTS! THREE candidate mess splitting ticket again like past with Perot.
Biden and Kamala showcase the worthlessness of their opinions and accusations.  Haven‚Äôt they devalued accusations of sexual assault, racism, and bad policing?   Politicians need to be more honest and righteous.
I googled antifa and no references to Biden came up.  What do you do with lying reporters asking lying questions to a lying president?
He's also supporting Biden,  so... He been a dip stick fur the left for years.
Trump has no idea how to even turn on a computer. He‚Äôs just jealous that Biden can make the ‚Äúmagic box‚Äù do things!
True... but if Two Supreme Court Justices are tapped to  say ‚ÄúSTEP DOWN‚Äù because they were wrongfully put there that also could be a great choice after Biden places a Black Woman on the bench!
Kamala Harris (  ‚ÄúHe inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden. And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground."
Only TWO people died of Ebola pandemic under Obama/Biden in America, compared to over 166,000 deaths of COVID-19 under   #FailedLeadership
Joe Biden is so much better than Trump it's hard to believe they're of the same species
Flashback: Kamala Harris women accusing  'I believe them, and I respect them being able to tell their story and having the courage to do it' To Kanamla:  Should Biden Run? ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs going to have to make that decision for himself, I wouldn‚Äôt tell him what to do.‚Äù Now his VP?
If you think Biden‚Äôs gonna try a Muslim ban, appoint conservative SCOTUS judges, invite foreign interference in our elections, gut the USPS, undermine NATO, build a wall, AND try to race-bait his way out of a pandemic, by all means don‚Äôt vote for him.
I'll bet you Jim Acosta &amp;  won't run one story with all the facts of what Kamala Harris said about Joe Biden during the debates? How she believed Bidens accusers, and now she doesn't? Yet she stated she believed Brett Kavanaghs accusers even after the FBI said no.
It's August 12th, day after Biden said "no" maybe made an offer to handle national ROADS as nuttin here yet!
But have either Trump or Biden stated how they would plan on punishing the Houston Astros?
You sound pathetic. It‚Äôs okay that Black woman have voted for white men and women for years whether they liked it or not. You hate to see that FINALLY we have a great pick in #BidenHarris like we had in Obama/Biden years ago. Sorry, we are not sorry! Get over it! #KamalaHarris
Your Suburb or Your Roads: Biden Will Do in One or the Other
.  recommended  pick Black woman for VP slot
AMERICANS AND THE WORLD ARE ABOUT TO WITNESS TRUE LEADERSHIP WHEN THE BIDEN/HARRIS PARTNERSHIP TAKES OVER THE WHITE HOUSE &amp; REVERSES EVERY DAMN THING TRUMP POISONED.
Dems probably won‚Äôt get control of the Senate and Biden is moderate, so not much to worry about unless he... you know... (78 years old man)
As a suburban woman I‚Äôm sorry to tell you that I never went through with the wedding ceremony with my house. My partner and I (he was a life long Republican) will both be voting Biden/Harris in any event, so it‚Äôs not an issue.
I really think the Biden campaign is tone-deaf af, not necessarily malicious, because it feels like they‚Äôre pandering to Obama-era nostalgia that many democrats feel. I mean Biden only felt emboldened to run because of his relationship to Obama
A video has been released that appears to show the moment former vice president  asked Sen.  to be his running mate.
Reason 83 to vote Democrat: The third of Job Biden's plans to Build Back Better is to make child and parental care possible without devastating the long term finances of a family.
Trump is running ads on crime (79% of ads) &amp; protests/riots (31% of ads); Biden is running more diverse ads, focused most on COVID (69%) &amp; the economy (60%). Trump is only 12% positive vs. Biden 64% positive.
There's no defending her!! she comes from slave owners her family has benefited from the oppression of the African American and Jamaican people!!   she is still a slave driver She put them all in forced labor prison And so did Joe Biden  Research and wake the hell up
Nope. You frauds can try and sidestep the debates however you want, you know the president will knock Biden's dick in the dirt.
Can someone find me statistics on people who voted for Trump in 2016 but are voting Biden this year, vs people who voted for Hillary in 2016 but are voting for Trump this year? I‚Äôm willing to bet the latter can be counted in one hand while the former is in the thousands or more.
Choosing a non-centrist running mate is a departure for Democrats. But Biden &amp; Harris match a public that is more symbolically conservative but more liberal on policy. They propose more liberal policies without selling an ideological revolution, running instead on restoration
I know people absolutely hate Biden and Harris but as a gay person please for the love of god vote Trump and Pence out. They have been the absolute worst toward LGBT+ rights, really not a debate.
I'd be more scared that they have a HIGHER AA percentage then anywhere else since she incarcerated mostly AA on Weed charges &amp; gave the toughest sentences that Biden's bill was directly responsible 4 &amp; the fact the area is very religious 2. It had ZERO 2 do with Racism. Nada
i feel so split, on the one hand i completely agree that voting for biden/harris will not solve years of generational, systematic oppression (esp when harris is an opp herself!) but i also can‚Äôt stand people acting like it‚Äôs not the only option right now
Ben Shapiro: At this point, Trump is running against Harris not Biden
Biden is the racist üê≤
Not voting for Biden is a vote for trump !!
This does nothing to perpetuate the idea that Biden is unwell. He handled himself with class in the primary debates and the American public deserves to watch him debate Trump.
It has nothing to do with hopeüòÇ there is a ZERO percent chance Betsy DeVos is a part of the next cabinet. There is a 0% chance Trump's postmaster general for the USPS is kept on. There is a 0% chance that Biden would appoint a conservative SCOTUS judge. These aren't guesses....

5 Takeaways On The New #BidenHarris Presidential Ticket
It makes me so sad and confused that people r actually voting for Trump or Biden.
The bottom line here is Trump can‚Äôt be elected president again. The only chance to stop that is voting for the Biden ticket.
All I‚Äôm gonna say is don‚Äôt say shit to black women OR sexual assault survivors for feeling hesitant about voting for Biden. Everybody else is free rein
Maybe to add a little spice in addition to the Biden/Trump and Harris/Pence debate, let‚Äôs have Doug Emhoff debate Karen Pence and Jill Biden debate Melanie Trump.
I'll take Biden pushing states and potentially the Senate to dems due to his consolidation and expansion of independent and even some right leaning voters over Bernie potentially winning the presidency and maintaining the current balance of Congress. thats just me tho
i hate the biden/kamala ticket as well, literally 2/3 of my least fav candidates from the primary (worst was Bloomberg obv), i just angy at people saying they won't vote at all because donald trump is the imminent danger imo. i said it earlier but im gonna be MUCH pickier in 2024
Everyone looks so dumb being mad at those who don‚Äôt wanna vote for Biden. Like be mad at everyone who got us here in the first place...misplaced anger babes :/

That is what they find for Palin:  But they find the Biden pick helped Obama (re-assuring voters about his experience).  Also, can sometimes split voters without helping or hurting. Paul Ryan made Romney gain with conservatives &amp; lose with moderates.

dems are force feeding us extremely problematic options and then jumping down everyone‚Äôs throats to ‚ÄúVOTEü§©‚ú®‚Äù I‚Äôm not blind to the fact that we have to get trump out of office, but dems are being tone deaf acting like they‚Äôre entitled to our vote for biden/harris in the midst..
joe biden and trump are basically the same! even though joe is for $15 min wage, student loan forgiveness, has the most comprehensive climate change plan of any candidate from the primary, will have the opportunity to replace at least 1 supreme court judge...  my brain is smooth!
Sure, you're a closet Biden supporter üòâ
Michigan  says #BidenHarris will bring ‚Äòfierce leadership‚Äô to White House
He was remembering how you enjoy his macaroni and cheese. Love your pic with Biden too. I am hopeful after this nightmare .
Trump is an existential threat and that‚Äôs why I will vote for Biden. Not because I think he will take our country in the right direction, but strictly harm reduction.
Interesting.  reports Whitmer told Biden‚Äôs team she no longer wanted to be considered for his running mate before her Aug. 2 flight to Deleware. She recommended Biden pick a Black woman.
Or maybe it's on Biden for not having policies that resonate with the progressive wing of the party.
NEW: In late spring, Whitmer said she no longer wanted to be considered for the VP. She recommended Biden pick a Black woman.  But Biden still wanted Whitmer in the mix, and he personally called her in mid-June to ask if she would continue. Whitmer agreed.
AP: Whitmer asked to be removed from veepstakes in late spring and recommended Biden pick a Black woman. But Biden still wanted Whitmer in the mix, and she agreed to second round of vetting.
They are very scared now. This was the perfect pick for Biden. He picked someone that is ready to be President. He picked someone that can bring unity back to this country. It‚Äôs ok if we never see eye to eye on things. But we still respected each other. First time I‚Äôm going Blue!
No longer under consideration as Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate, Governor Whitmer returns to micromanaging the state economy and our daily lives by issuing Executive Order #169 setting operating hours for grocery stores &amp; pharmacies.
Trump maintains a ~2% advantage in the Electoral College over the popular vote. He has a chance to win but Biden has a chance at a landslide. Economic conditions are quite uncertain &amp; more mixed than reported (due to stimulus income &amp; market gains)

üî¥ LIVE PODCAST: 8/12/20 | Ep. 2109 Michael Patrick Shiels: Governor Whitmer Calls Biden-Harris A "Fierce Team" on
The important part of this story for the perspective of the American public is that HMO's and insurance companies have posted *record profits* since the passage of the ACA.  Care costs more than ever. And Biden/Harris oppose the best fix -which is M4A. Why, DNC insiders, WHY?!?!
I totally forgot about Hillary's awful running mate - Tim Kaine. That ticket was never going to win.  I don't like Kamala, and I cannot stand Biden - but I like what Democrats *think* Kamala is. If that makes sense.   No, it doesn't make sense! But I think they could win.
12 hours left. I‚Äôm hoping Biden leaks it pulls into the lead.

Yes she will raise him up:  Biden that is.
Very very disappointed in the selection of Biden‚Äôs running mate. But am I surprised? Never.
if she was smarter she would have dropped out and endorsed Bernie before super Tuesday, gotten the vp nod, trounced trump at the polls, then usurped the presidency Richard the 3rd style by pouring strychnine in Bernie's oatmeal. Now she has to watch Kamala do it with Biden :|
not all the best law schools are Ivies, but Harris and Biden went to crappy law schools!

Poor Joe Biden, he's been forced further left than he's ever been, and he's been forced to pick a VP he doesn't want. Even, if he was all there mentally, this wouldn't be the way he wanted to become president.
You‚Äôre right, we need to see Biden pretend like he may choose a progressive VP, so that we can believe he really cares about the left
Honestly, the Biden/Harris ticket announcement gave me the shivers, I feel the energy go up my spine and I get goosebumps.  This is the winning ticket and you can feel that good history is going to be made!
I think that small percentage of Bernie voters that don‚Äôt vote for Biden will be smaller than didn‚Äôt vote for Hillary in 2016. We couldn‚Äôt survive 4 more years of trump and that has to be obvious to more people than in 2016. Imagine no more post office.

I think that the vast majority of us Bernie supporters are voting for Biden. I think the percentage that don‚Äôt vote for Biden will be smaller than didn‚Äôt vote for Hillary. Trumps so bad (160k dead is hard to ignore) that all Biden has to do is exactly what he is doing now.
joe biden really didn‚Äôt read the room huh
That is such a cool backstory to #KamalaHarris Tonight‚Äôs pick by #JoeBiden is a perfect example of selfishness &amp; patience. Harris chose to exit the presidential contest early. People were upset; but her selflessness stood out to Biden. #BidenHarris2020
A Biden/Harris ticket is interesting.  Like when my mom told my dad I got a C+ in a class, and his reply was ‚Äúinteresting.‚Äù  Kamala Harris threw everything she said and felt about Joe Biden out the window when she got tapped for VP nominee. How convenient!!!
What people fail to realize is, despite Harris‚Äô and Biden‚Äôs policies, they are willing to listen to progressive, have a conversation in change.
Same for me, but you can leave Biden off.

I asked her if she supported the Bill. She said her and my grandfather supported better policing in the city. I told her that wasn't really an answer. She said, and I quote, "Baby, I'm voting for Joe Biden. A lot of people don't see the world the same way as they used to." &gt;&gt;&gt;
Lansing State Journal: Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his VP running mate
Somehow the right is so far gone that Kamala Harris and Joe Biden apparently aren‚Äôt moderates..........
After that, Biden gets accused of sexual assault, so he vows to choose a woman as his VP. And now, Sleepy Joe announces Phony Kamala as his running mate.
Then, 3 months after ending her own campaign, she reluctantly endorses Biden.
First, Kamala Harris attacked Joe Biden‚Äôs racist policies (did she forget?). Next, she ends her pathetic run at President.
Just when we thought the idea of Joe Biden being President of the United States couldn‚Äôt get any worse, he announces that Kamala Harris, a failed presidential candidate and a corrupt former California Attorney General, will be his running mate.

Like I do not like Biden or Harris but I do genuinely believe that he would be better than Trump, BUT we shouldn‚Äôt also be blindly allied with a party to not suffer. Third party gives me v ‚Äúright idea wrong time‚Äù but I ALSO should not have to compromise.
Biden/Harris reinforces the likelihood that Democrats move substantially left on policy positions without embracing (&amp; sometimes explicitly challenging) a consciously ideological reinvention or an abandonment of the party‚Äôs traditional coalition of constituencies approach
idk what to do fr cause I understand both of the ‚Äúvote third party‚Äù and ‚Äúvote Biden‚Äù groups.
I asked state Sen. Adam Hollier about the historic nature of Joe Biden picking Kamala Harris.   It made him think of his 3-year-old daughter's first Halloween costume. She went as a president standing on a glass ceiling:
Dems were successful with a Dem Senator Veep candidate 4 times: Kennedy/Johnson (1960), Carter/Mondale (1976), Clinton/Gore (1992), Obama/Biden (2008). They were unsuccessful 4 times: Stevenson/Kefauver (1956), Dukakis/Bentsen (1988), Gore/Lieberman (2000), Clinton/Kaine (2016).
Lmao! Blind damn republicans! All about yourselves aren‚Äôt ya? We are all gonna vote Biden/Harris and givr America back to the people! Y‚Äôall are outta here üëãüèº
all these tweets are so funny but i can‚Äôt help but be angry that my only option as a decent human being is voting for a biden/harris ticket ü§°
Please remember that while Taylor supports Biden, Biden is still a disgusting rat.   BUT I would do anything for Trump to be out of the White House, that doesn‚Äôt mean I support everything Biden does.   In 2024, we need to learn and vote for not disgusting, rich, white men.

Tweets that do mean more coming from someone who also just said he was voting for Biden, I suppose.
I‚Äôm ready! Kamala is ready, too! Go Biden/Harris!
It could also be read as saying ‚ÄúIf these election results are wrong, it‚Äôs because we didn‚Äôt account for Trump cheating.‚Äù Which poses 2 problems 1.) it shows the analysts‚Äô bias 2.) creates a false dichotomy‚Äî either Biden wins or Trump cheated.
I absolutely get the Kamala criticism. I do not like her, and I do not like Biden. I just don‚Äôt see how people are surprised?? I‚Äôm trying to think of the Supreme Court &amp; Covid response, and otherwise I‚Äôm trying to keep my energy local.
Biden is crushing in the polls. Harris does not change the polls in any way. Ben is triggered by this fact.
So who are y‚Äôall voting for If it isn‚Äôt Biden?
I'm loving it. They are trying so hard to figure out how to make Biden choosing Harris into Biden being a racist.
Biden sabotaging himself??? Maybe he knows he's not capable of being President? ü§î
That was the hint that it would be #KamalaHarris Biden wouldn‚Äôt have chosen  unless he knew Harris would be comfortable with her.

Mike! I can‚Äôt wait to have you back serving our country again! I hope you answer the call in a Biden/Harris Administration. Thank you for your service and sacrifice.
Please get joe Biden to support Medicare for all. His current position is that he would veto it.
I would agree that her stance on healthcare might be more moderate than, say Bernie‚Äôs. But it‚Äôs a more progressive policy than Pete‚Äôs (very close though), and much more progressive than Biden‚Äôs ACA expansion. In my mind, her MFA plan seems much closer to Bernie than Biden.
'A fierce team.' Whitmer praises Kamala Harris as Joe Biden's VP pick.

I think you‚Äôre a traitor who‚Äôs getting paid by Russia to smear Biden. Your story is weak, Russia isn‚Äôt getting their money‚Äôs worth.
This attitude right here is why I have no time for progressives shitting on Biden nonstop. A god damn former right wing tea party congressman can put his beliefs aside to end the emergency and so can everyone else.

The Blue Wave, my neighbors, the positivity Biden/Harris stirred up. We need to find a way to channel all the anger we have towards Trumpublicans into positivity for Biden/Harris. We're not out of the woods untill January 20.
It's coming down to it. I dread to see all the Trumpublicans and Trumptards in line with no masks. It's going to get very ugly. No mask=Trump, Mask=Biden/Harris. You'll know before the Vote...
No need to worry about it now! Democrats can now TEXT TO VOTE according to the new law Trump just passed! Since he didn‚Äôt want to fund the postal service they‚Äôre allowing it for Democrats.   TEXT the word: BIDEN TO: 30330   No registration/ID/signature/mask!   We did it!
But basement Biden is ahead by 7% in national polls with a margin of error of -24%
Joe Biden is calling for a 3 month mask mandate, but he hasn‚Äôt addressed the riots or the looting! GTFO
I look at Biden/Harris and they terrify me. He‚Äôs been a liar for his entire career. So phony he was forced out of the race for plagerizing last time he ran for pres. She says out loud that she believes Tara Reid yet still supports Biden. Can‚Äôt trust either to go against grain.

Vote for Biden anyway.  Count on Biden to put together a team of advisors that he will actually listen to.  He‚Äôs not going in thinking he has to know everything.  He just has to know how to lead.  Besides we have a better shot at surviving the next 4 years with Biden for Prez.

If I have to stand there 24 hours to vote for Biden, I will!
Pretty sure this is a BIDEN BOT
"Hell no, I'm not resigning ... I thought (the post) was humorous. I had no idea people would react the way they did. I think people have gone overboard on this ‚Ä¶ It's an election year."
Dr Biden: I believe this country is stronger when the least of us is supported and lifted up. A rising tide lifts all ships.   Melanie: A rising tide lifts the ships and make us the stronger country of the least people. Close enough.
Because that shit was laughable. ZOOM OUT. It‚Äôs so simple. He knew Biden had been super dirty in Ukraine. He asked to look into it. Dems spun it in an insanely dishonest way. It didn‚Äôt work. Guess what? HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT BIDEN. The rest was a legal assassination attempt. MISSED
Umm no. Not what happened. He said, they found no evidence of Russian collusion. What you just said was a false translation from the fake news. As far as Ukraine, Biden is up on  federal charges over there for crimes. All trump did was point it out. Dems are really that ballsy
Joe Biden is going to force our children to read the Curand (muslim bible) in schools.

Please add Joe Biden to the mix.
I'm not gonna pretend that Biden, any dem or a politician is squeaky clean. I'm not naive. That said, we've seen trump enrich himself and his cronies right out in the open. How many of the small business loans went to his friends and himself.
Congratulations to Senator Harris and Vice President Biden for standing tall in adversity!! WELL DONE! Now we have to do our part VOTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That is frickin halarious. You know Biden could do that cuz clown donald can barely make it off the news conference stage without holding onto a wall or column. Watch trumpy when he exits from a stage. His balance is way off; something not right there.
I assume I'm considered a "house-wife" since I stay home to raise my son and finish my multiple degrees. But I can say that trump got it very wrong. This "house-wife" (I hate this term) is voting for Biden/Harris!!!

Most Americans r not that stupid, biden? Somatic narcissist dumbass..Harris a covert narcissist mirrors everyone...what? MSM has deceived many to hate Trump...the spirit is called leviathan ...Jezebel/narcissist have this spirit also..it twist truth
Yeh cus it's a joke..lost 9 billion ? The postal service needs to b put into the private sector,so the scum in Washington  like biden..Pelosi, Schumer, Harris, who like to skim the take, b thankful we now have a president who is stopping the  skim, surprised u didn't know that
HARRIS IS A HYPOCRITE WHO SAID SHE BELIEVED THE WOMAN WHO COMPLAIN THAT BIDEN IS A PEDOPHILE. HAVE A GOOD DEMOCRAT KKK
This VP is different. Even Biden says, he‚Äôs no spring chicken. Kamalalala is the Deep State‚Äôs choice for president! If Biden strokes all the way out, üß®üí•Who and what she is, shows everyone the utter lack of integrity &amp; willingness to be radical these LEFTIST CRATS truly are!
He is, but he also realizes that he needs his voters to support Biden or trump will win again

‚ÄúTrumps a racist, pervert, uses people of color for personal gain, babbling idiot!!‚Äù  And what did you and the DNC decide on?  A racist, pervert, using people of color for personal gain, can‚Äôt formulate a sentence (Biden‚Äôs not a babbling idiot like trump but it‚Äôs not great)
When something‚Äôs okay. ‚ÄúBelieve all women‚Äù until it turned on Biden. ‚ÄúWhite people have to stop using people of color for personal gain‚Äù until Biden did it. ‚ÄúWe need a president whose well spoken and not a hot head ‚Äú which Biden isn‚Äôt even close too.  ‚ÄúBUTTTT TRUMPPP‚Äù  Ya know,
*pretends to be shocked*  Biden, is completely using a women of color just for votes. Not because he believes she‚Äôll do the best job. Sad. You know all the other outrage when white people, were using people of color to justify things they‚Äôve said or done or this and that

Joe Biden has hired me, "the gray fox", to "steal" the election... Easy for me ..
Taking on a prosecutor VP is suicide for Biden. He just lost a lot of pot smoker libertarian votes. I'm probably the only right wing pot smoker on earth.
Wasn't that long ago Harris said that Biden was a sexist and molested women...so these things are no longer true?
I take it this means Harris no longer believes that Biden is a racist and a sexist...my how opinions change when you're bought off.
Gotta remember, this isn‚Äôt a typical VP situation. Kamala is the deep state‚Äôs choice for PRESIDENT! We all know Biden‚Äôs not gonna make it very much further anyway but, the second they‚Äôre ready, they‚Äôd make him retire and have her in the oval. With her integrity... makes sense.
grand standing fraudulent virtue signaling politician of all. She was pleading to censor Trump on Twitter in order to get some cheers and when it didn‚Äôt land, she akwardly laughed through the lack of applause. She‚Äôs  screeching nails on a chalkboard FAKE. NO BUENO! NO BIDEN!
OMG  The woman that pointed out your racist behavior during the debates is now your running mate what is this world coming to? Show your white privilege Joe Biden your brain is mush old man
Maybe because they know the economy will survive since there‚Äôs no way Biden can win now üòÇ
The point in using those videos is to say ‚Äúthis is the type of nonsense that will continue if Biden is re-elected‚Äù. When he‚Äôs re-elected and the house flips over, the mess in those videos will be done. Voting him back into office will show the support is there to make it happen.

You don‚Äôt understand because you don‚Äôt think backwards like a Democrat. It‚Äôs not about what she stands FOR. It‚Äôs a new way to attack Trump &amp; his voters. Anti-Biden/Harris will be considered ‚Äúanti-women‚Äù &amp; ‚Äúanti-people of color‚Äù üôÑ IT WONT WORK but, it will be PAINFULLY CRINGEY!üëáüèΩ

Remember when Trump told Chris Wallace there‚Äôs no enthusiasm for Biden. Keep thinking that, big guy.
Well considering Biden doesn't even know where he is you better hope you're right on that.

Kamala Harris used to work with Hunter Biden doing what who knows? She enforced that 1994 crime bill against black defendants to its full extent. As a student of former mayor Willie Brown , whom she had an alleged affair with  Willie said she would make a lousy president!
You're out your damn mind. Trump has done WAY more for the Black/Hispanic communities than any other president. Biden on the other hand says you aint black if you don't vote for him
Progressives will definitely NOT get on Board with a Biden/Harris ticket you can be sure of that

Joe Biden Picks Kamala Harris As Democratic VP Running Mate
Why was msmbc so late in announcing Biden‚Äôs vp pick
Biden/Harris was the obvious ticket. She can now push police reform as a former AG, she's got a ton of charisma that'll remind people of Obama, and it'll set Dems up for 12 years in office when she runs in '24. #BidenHarris2020
Anyone have the clip/video of Harris crying about how racist Biden was for wanting segregated schools and busses? That‚Äôs one of my favorites.
Kamala Harris is, objectively, the worst possible choice for the Democrats to put in the White House alongside Joe Biden.  Not because she is a woman, but because when she had the power to help people facing injustice from law enforcement, she did nothing. She. Did. Nothing.
That's the ticket: Joe Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris as his 2020 vice presidential running mate  via  #MIDems
Text is in, and Biden just took to Twitter

Trump replied: ‚ÄúHe said that. Some people would say that men are insulted by that, and some people would say it‚Äôs fine. I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù  Somehow that became:   Biden is insulting men everywhere (without quotation marks‚Äù‚Äù‚Äùbtw!)  You really do have to be a detective to read the news

I gotta ask, why aren‚Äôt Dems taking this approach? Seriously, just start making up awesome stuff about Biden and who cares about how realistic it is?
This coming from the campaign attempting to cast doubt on Biden‚Äôs mental faculties. Orwellian is appropriate.

Uh-huh. And he says Biden is the one with cognitive difficulties.
The only thing Biden will be picking will be his ear. The deep state chooses everything he does from his outfits to his interviews.
He‚Äôs also quite handsome but, that also has nothing to do with my point. I‚Äôll play along tho... fair to say, Biden doesn‚Äôt exactly have that gift either but, the press never comes at him even a little bit like they have with Trump. Anyone being honest, will see my point here.
Like his advisors helping pick the vp or like online ones like the bernie bros? Ive never seen like a extremely amped biden guy on twitter haha
man oh man, all my ignorant family members posting about how Joe Biden is a creepy pedo sure seem to forget that there is actually a creepy old man in our family who was accused and sent to jail for molesting his granddaughter, but we conveniently forget about that don't we?

Kamala Harris Is Biden‚Äôs Choice for Vice President
I don‚Äôt think so.  If Trump loses and refuses to leave, on Jan. 20 he becomes a trespasser in the WH and de facto threat to Pres Biden. The Secret Service would have ample resources to restrain and remove him.  stay safe
It‚Äôs gonna be Biden is really a black Muslim who wants to hurt God and the Bible...  but Harris isn‚Äôt really black.

Well any of the list were horrible candidates, all would bring Biden down. But of the list Kamala is maybe the least offensive... IMO. She helps suggest a possibility of law and order. She is a senator, so some legislative experience. But probably bad for attracting minority vote

The other way to look at jobs, number employed (again Fed data).  Employment rose steadily from 138 M in Dec. 2009 to 152 M in Dec. 2016 under Obama / Biden.

I watched this multiple times. You're missing the point. Biden can disagree with somebody &amp; realize they have a lot to offer even if they have a different opinion on something. This is leadership  &amp; Character.   Donald Trump will fire you if you disagree with his ideas.

I dislike them both, but as I‚Äôve said over and over again, I‚Äôm not voting for Biden, but RBG‚Äôs successor.
The concerns are legitimate, because voting for Biden is painful.  However, this isn‚Äôt an election where you vote to get someone IN, this is an election where you‚Äôre trying to get someone OUT.  If Joe doesn‚Äôt do the right thing in four years, then vote him out too.

Presumptive of me, but I'm really proud of Joe Biden for choosing a woman who hit him hard in the debate. He's showing us he's a man who can take criticism and doesn't hold grudges. How refreshing.
Remember the debate where Kamala Harris heavily criticized Biden on busing? Picking Harris speaks volumes about the kind of man Joe Biden is. Does anyone think President Man-Baby would or could pick someone who wouldn't kiss his fat ass day in, day out?

This is absolutely true. Trump needs to leave office, but Biden keeps doing horrible things like this since he feels entitled to votes at this point.
There's a difference between a country wanting somebody as president and country manipulating an election to get their candidate. We already know Russia is actively manipulating, using social media. Germany would like to see Biden. Does that make them an enemy of the state.
I'm trying to get your point here. So who really cares if China wants Biden to be president. We all know Russia, a much more dangerous entity, wants and will manipulate to have Donald j Trump remain president. You forget they helped him win in 2016.

Joe Biden will be fine, He has not bankrupt 13 companies, or failed to pay his taxes. And he is not a malignant narcissistic sociopath.
Frankly a special-needs 5th grader could do a better job than Donald Trump.   Joe Biden will bring us back to normal. 4 years of Trump's corruption and narcissism was 4 years too many.
And the only word Trump knows. Is Trump. And Biden can drink a glass of water on his own. #YoSemites  #COVFEFE  #Thighland
Up with a tooth ache ‚òπÔ∏è so I'm reading. Just read an interesting article about our governor. Apparently she took a chartered flight to Delaware to meet with Biden.
He isn‚Äôt replacing ObamaCare (ACA). In fact, he is literally not doing anything. This is like Biden proclaiming he is issuing an executive order that slavery is illegal

Biden campaign plans to hit Trump over auto job promises  viaNot surprising at all. Did you ever see the video of that child getting ran over. People walking by. Nobody even stops. Our future if Biden wins.
That's because Biden cannot answer any questions at all because he has no idea what's going on while he hides in his basement.
I definitely think you are talking about yourself Joe biden a complete failure in politics spent 40 years doing nothing
Sad seeing a lot of Warren people shitting all over Biden and Harris. It's not helpful. We have one shot at getting rid of Trump. Why be another arm of the GOP? It's like 2016 all over again, only with Warren peeps. I'm sure she wouldn't approve. Unfollowing. Unfollow me. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
My Mom is I'll, pneumonia and diabetes, so we covered 5 States in 2 days. We saw the same number of coughing, ill people, without a sense of smell, as we saw Biden campaign signs...
Joe Biden is not yet the POTUS.
Why is there a need for this  piece? Because #birthers like #Trump fabricate fiction to debunk; that‚Äôs why. So sad because the reality is #KamalaHarris was a #Democratic presidential candidate before becoming #Biden‚Äôs #VP choice. Ugh, just ugh!
Who Can Not Stomach The Biden/Harris Media Darlings trying to.Shove These Loosers down our Face.  I'm so Sick of Politics  Are Their That Many Stupid people In This Country That Think They Wouldnt Just Be Worse Than Status Quo Special Intrest Globalist Care About any one of Us?
Growing up my parents pushed honesty, I grew up living an honest life. So sad that HRC, Bill Clinton, Obama, Biden, Harris, etc didn‚Äôt have the same upbringing. Honestly it seems like Trump was one of the few that was raised right ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

It‚Äôs time to get Biden and Harris on stage for a vetting of their goals and how they will pursue them before the mail ballots take place.
I deliver for Amazon and see hundreds of Trump signs daily and have only seen 3 Biden signs total in the last 2 months here in MI ...
That's because the Biden campaign is scared shitless to let either one of them speak in an unscripted setting.
Weird, last I checked between trump and Biden only trump was named repeatedly in multiple court cases regarding the rape of minor children. And wasnt it odd how trumps hand-picked labor secretary was part of the Epstein plea deal?
The benchmark we have to reach is a Biden presidency.

Trump will make mincemeat out of Biden.
Oh you know... the admitted socialism policies Biden and Harris are calling for...
Want to join me for this Joe Biden for President event?
Back in 2010 President Obama and VP Joe Biden were going to fire 50,000 cattle guards,but Joe said he wants to oversee them being retrained for better jobs. I sure hope he has changed his tune. Hahahaha
(Snort!)  FFS, do you have some fantasy Biden will?
I have the same problem. Maybe put, that we‚Äôre Democrats, who supports Biden in our profile? Kidding, not kidding.
The Democrats wanted to get somebody as conservative as they could to draw away those Republican voters that really don‚Äôt want Trump in the office.Biden seemed to be the safest. Because he is very moderate. But it will backfire.
None of that is going to make a big enough change unless we have a living wage to go back to and Medicare for all. Sadly the refusal to back that I believe will be the end of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. No Medicare for all. No vote for Joe.
How did you feel when they supported Obama &amp; Biden in both '08 &amp; '12?
I hear a lot of people insisting how bad America will look if Joe Biden is elected, while neglecting the current reality... Proud Boys in #Kalamazoo, for instance...
Biden is a moderate republican lol
Just annoys everyone but extreme leftists who will vote Biden anyway.
This is hilarious so they just want to impeach Trump because they don't like him. The Democrats have wasted American money on the Russia Investigation that they cooked up, and Biden admitting to not give aide to Ukraine unless they fire the prosecutor.
Why #Trump‚Äôs kids open their mouths is beyond me. Their dad does a very effective job of making a fool of himself without their nonsensical views added.  Eric Trump calls on Biden to answer for 'very discriminatory' process of picking running mate  #FoxNews
You wanna put some skin on that? Its proven that Biden was blackmailing Ukraine for quid pro quo for Hunter. The democrats have done nothing but praise and defend China, and have ignored the official reports saying China is in the top 3 to meddle with our election.

Democrats are the party of the kkk. It never changed. They just got better at lying. When joe Biden says well, all the racist shit joe says, that‚Äôs because that‚Äôs how joe really thinks. They aren‚Äôt gaffes! He just forgot to lie.
They endorsed Barack Obama &amp; Joe Biden in 2008 &amp; 2012.
This is the worst advice you could possibly offer Biden. A smart Biden campaign says the bare minimum between now and November. This election will be a reaction to Trump lighting himself on fire daily. Why do anything that would distract from the fire?
Biden coming with some HEAT
Here is a photo of a rock in my yard I‚Äôd rather vote for than either Trump or Biden. I named him Dwayne. Dwayne ‚ÄúThe Rock‚Äù. He needs a last name. How about ‚ÄúJohnson‚Äù? Everyone should write-in Dwayne ‚Äú ‚Äù Johnson in November. #TheRock2020
It doesn‚Äôt make sense to compare an executive with a publicly funded press secretary, and a candidate with a campaign fund. There should be two sets of expectations there.   Besides, Biden tells more truth in 5 minutes than Trump has his entire life
Even before Trump came out and said what everyone already knew, there's no way you'd call Biden's speculation "baseless". Trump's pattern of behavior is itself a base of suspicion for the motives behind Trump's actions. What kind of kindergarten headline writer did this?
The weekend grocery shopping trip was made much better by spotting my first Biden for President yard sign #GoJoe2020
Hey, I'm no Michael Bennet hater! I like Bennet a lot, I just prefer Pete for this moment. I genuinely hope Bennet is given a chance to shine with a Biden cabinet position.

You raised a man worse than that.  Hunter, your family (sister, brother,son and yourself) are corupt to their bones thanks to YOU... for what?  Love of money and power. Tell me again what in your 40 yrs in  government have you done for Americans vs. your Biden clan? Ur worthless.
Lying about Biden in Newsweek, doesn‚Äôt make it true.
Beautiful, compassionate words, and an excellent solution to the problem we face. But tbh, as I read it I could not imagine any of it in Trump‚Äôs voice. I kept slipping into Biden‚Äôs voice in my head. I think he‚Äôs already ‚Äúmy President‚Äù.
Maybe you should have targeted Joe Biden and the rest of the Demonrats. Why did it take so long and you have nothing to show for it.
If you think Trump is going to do anything other than help his buddies steal as much from us that they can, you‚Äôre thinking wrong. Biden would be so much worse though.
I noticed that... Kamala Harris was Biden's handlers' pick y'know...
Vote for Biden.
Love it, keep doing it, if Biden can do that it's fair game. That is hilarious.
I'm glad you are free to support Trump so much. I stand with for the children in cages, and I proudly stand with Biden/Harris.

Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report  #FoxNews
Another question you can ask: Why is the sky blue? Why can't Biden complete a sentence?
Dumbass question. How come Biden &amp; Harris can't answer any questions? Let me guess, because they don't have any answers. Biden is too busy cashing checks from the Ukraine and China.
Biden &amp; Harris can't answer any questions! Ask some relevant questions, like "President Trump, how did you accomplish so much in 3 years? Biden has been a politician for 45 years and has no accomplishments."  . #NeverBiden
Because they can't answer any questions and they don't have any accomplishments to discuss. Biden will be in a nursing home by November.
Obama &amp; Biden were too busy corrupting America and filling the swamp.
Just saw my 1st Joe Biden ad on the local station here in deep red WY. It sounded great, but not sure how the mandatory mask bit will go over here, so many covidiots!!
I‚Äôm voting for Biden/Harris because they can actually do the job without the lies and blatant corruption.  They are true diplomats and can mend fences with our allies.  Also, I‚Äôm tired of the division that has happened to our country.
How embarrassing for up and coming young artists to be seen with doddering old fool, Biden. How does this help their cache with fans? üòÇ
Vote for Biden and save us all, please.
Clinton and Obama are definitely wonk Ivy wasps as this article portrays. Biden is the lone Irish Gipper, the feeler, the westerner, the American.
Bernie's plan also didn't abolish private insurance. I can't believe you grouped her in with those Neolibs. I have noticed you and Abby are crickets on Bernie sheepdogging progressives into voting for someone as horrible as Biden and Kopmala! You both are better than this!

As long as you say the same about Trump (without mentioning Biden)
Totally agree. But if I (generally conservative) were to tell a dem that I‚Äôm voting 3rd party, though, this is the typical response, ‚Äúbut that‚Äôs a vote for Trump!‚Äù which is just not true, because I‚Äôd never vote for Biden. And especially not Bernie lol. Maybe I‚Äôm an outlier, idk.

This Biden drinking water ad is the stupidest thing I've seen since Obama drank Flint water
You lost me at Biden being a better president than trump. I do however get what your saying, I would just reverse the analogy.
The atmosphere for protest and agitation will likely lessen under Biden *for a while*. But the evictions, recession and other crises will generate protests again, and Biden will not stop the crushing of those mvmts.
Anything dems offer that sounds good is and always will be either abandoned or will cement in the advanced made by the right.   Case in point. Biden will maintain trump ICE policies.
She's notorious for oppression of Black Americans as a DA. Called Joe Biden a racist. Damn bear EVERYTHING she says is race based... so who's the racist?
The anti war protests were amongst the largest ever, and the overt lies that made the case for iraq were unraveling well before boots were on the ground. All it would have required for Biden to do the right thing was listen. But he didn't because hes a lifelong warmonger.
Once again, there is no reason for anyone on the left to feel as if they must vote for Biden. He will not reverse any Trump policies when in power.
Great to be in-studio yesterday at  in Casper to talk about the important issues facing Wyoming, as well as why Kamala Harris's radical policies would hurt our state and the nation.

Joe Biden Tries to Take Credit for Trump Brokered Peace Deal as Rashida Tlaib Yells At Clouds
Nope. I‚Äôd agree Trump would get credit if the economy were churning along when Biden takes office, but it currently is and almost certainly will be in free fall at that point.
I think we need tons of people voting in person for Biden/Harris on Election Day. I may risk it and go. I am so worried he‚Äôll declare victory on Election Day if he‚Äôs ahead on in person voting. That would be harder if Joe comes out on top on election night.

The Biden/Harris photo was perfect. Made in sketchy light. Really great.
Jill Biden and Douglas Emhoff are building a beautiful virtual friendship
Perhaps, but you have to admit Trump inherited an economy that was roaring along, while Obama inherited one that was in a death spiral. Ironically, if Biden wins, he‚Äôll inherit an economy in worse shape than the one Obama did.
So isn‚Äôt it time to enthusiastically endorse Biden/Harris? Your dad would.
You realize you said overt fascism about the current President of the United States, and are still willing to give him 4 more years? You think this place will be around in 2024 or 2028? Seriously? By then he will have nabbed Putin-like control. We can at least hold Biden to theüî•
I'm calling it for Trump.  Liberals are completely oblivious to Harris's wh*r* problem with women.  She actually reduces Biden's appeal.

I wonder, too. You could say the DNC strategy was a success since it beat Bernie Sanders. Seems like a costly victory, though, if you permanently lose a good part of your base, which I think the party has. Then pick a limp candidate like Biden and search for political Viagra. Wow

I think we can gauge by her primary performance.  That's her first national campaign.  She came in dead last- behind the likes of Bloomberg, Gutbieg, Pocahontas, even Biden himself.  Zero power.
When I watch Mr.Biden and listen to his,as people say,rambling on,and lack of putting words together too form intelligent speech.  I feel sorrow for him,and at Sametime shame for his staff,and family for keeping him in the limelight. Let the poor man retire. He really needs help
Election gambling odds. You bet $100 to win $43 with Biden ($143 payout) or You bet $100 to win $125 with trump ($225 payout) . You could bet $100 on Kanye and if he wins you win $50,000 ($50,100 payout). Something to watch. Trump was +1150 at a point in 2016.

I believe the Biden Harris ticket will do much more for the progressive movement moving forward than trump will. There is more hope with them in office than what we have right now!
The problem with 3rd party voting by progressive democrats, its a vote taken away from removing trump from office for no other reason but to hope and protest. Why not give the Biden Harris ticket a shot to show they will listen to progressive ideals and put some in place to start
Why are you endorsing Biden/Harris? Thanks though.

Trump breaks everything he touches. Hopefully a Biden administration will be able to restore the department‚Äôs image as mentioned in the article. Congress should also look at legislation to prevent the DHS from being used inappropriately in the future.
Or, as someone put it a couple days ago, she could be a sack of potatoes with a smiling face and I'd still vote for Biden.
It's true that African Americans didn't show up in quite as large of numbers, though in 2008 they voted with 60% and 2016 it was 59%.  As a Michigander, I knew Trump would win. But he's lost a lot of support here. And every third party voter I know from 2016 = Biden.
Trump campaign uses the totally false claim that dead people vote.  Trump campaign uses a dead persons Twitter account to attack Biden and Kamala.  Vote decency and truth, Vote #BidenHarris2020   #ONEV1
Absolutely none. She is more fake than Biden and the people need to see that.
Other than being the most pro-abortion ticket in history, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are puppets for the pro-China, open borders, Wall Street Chamber of Commerce crowd. They'll continue policies that ship jobs oversees while shilling for Big Tech

I use tweetdeck so much I don't know how to navigate the native twitter site.  Detroit Free Press did a thing on Whitmer's hesitation. She's young and probably wants to build a stronger party base as governor.   Unless Cain had a scoop on Biden, he wouldn't have known
THIS WOULD BE AMAZING IF IT HAD A MONTHLY 2000 DOLLAR STIMULUS IN IT BECAUSE ITS NOT JUST HEALTHY PEOPLE GETTING TJIS AND DYING FROM IT ITS EVERYWHERE SO WEATHER IF UR HOMELESS OR WHO EVER YOU ARE A MONTHLY 2000 STIMULUS WOULD REALLY HELP.A phone call by a pollster had zero affect on your job. Hahaha  I have yet to see a maga not proud to be a deplorable.   Says a lot if someone feels to embarrassed to say who they will vote for tho.  VOTING BIDEN LOUD AND PROUD
More than biden did.
I Michigan we voted to be able to vote by mail. The voters spoke and now we can be confident in doing so because of a potus who will cheat to win. So I will go to the polls so I know my vote for Biden will count. But it shouldn't have been this way
I dont see any sign of Biden on a mental decline. And damn good physical shape for his age. Trump can't even stand up straight. That being said I trust Joe Biden to surround himself with the best people. And to listen to the people around him. A successful administration
I have seen Biden interviewed.
Here in Michigan we voted for mail in voting.  That is democracy.  Now we can't trust what we voted for because of a cheater in the White House.  But I will put a mask on and go vote for Biden because it is that important.
REALLY!! Why in the hell should be people even think about voting for sloppy Joe Biden.!! Such a JOKE!!
I'm too am excited   New Trump leaning poll from FOX News:  Biden 49, Trump 42 ----Biden +7
I don't know, it's awfully pretty. Biden might think he's going to heaven, and that would really confuse him.
Biden -- and Democrats all the way down the ballot  Most people know that this country is not going in the right direction
They will call her a cop. Question her ability to lead. Lie about her record/her background. They will use Birtherism. Slander both her and Joe. But they have no idea how much black women can take, and still rise above. Biden/Harris will bring competence back to the White House!
How disgusting......time for him to get kicked out of office!   Virginia mayor faces calls to resign after saying Joe Biden picked ‚ÄòAunt Jemima as his VP‚Äô in Facebook post
Weird too but it shows Biden is willing to work to get where he needs to go this is going to help  Biden not trump
Biden supporters don't read. They know that.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Y‚Äôall gone criticize Biden and kamala right into 4 more years of Trump lmao
By the time I get out of work my polling place is usually pretty quiet. I might just risk it. I need to get my vote for Biden/Harris in!
If the Democrats want me to vote for Biden they must execute Randy Rainbow on primetime television.
If you're just tired of Trump's overt bigotry &amp; want Biden instead? Just say that. Once you get to talking policy, that's when you'll get that work. Biden ain't gone do shit but cozy up to corporations &amp; cops. You're fooling yourself otherwise.
Wow that‚Äôs crazy. Biden gotta do better
Antifa' website cited in conservative media attack on Biden is linked to ‚Äî wait for it ‚Äî Russia
I think I may stick a Biden/Harris sign in my yard upside down, because I support them but I am fuckint confused about it
People will support Trump and have the nerve to say Pelosi is a liar, AOC is stupid, and Biden is a creep
no! not this! people are so allowed and SHOULD point out the HUGE flaws in both kamala and biden, especially if we are voting for them in the middle of a social justice movement that goes against its views- they are 2 people who benefit hugely from the prison industrial complex
In ‚Äòmust-win‚Äô Michigan, Trump campaign takes fight door to door as polls show Biden with strong lead
I don‚Äôt know if it is the right move for the Trump commercial supposedly mocking Biden, but then putting him riding by with ‚ÄúElectric Avenue‚Äù in the background.   #PMTbump
They say Biden new running mate been helping send kids to ices. Hope that shit ain‚Äôt true cause if so fuck her idc what color her skin is! ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Okay but my thing is like... we‚Äôre here now. Electoral college is also still here. We have our options. Choose wisely. That is *all* we can do. Complaining and throwing out the obvious (that ya don‚Äôt wanna vote either) isn‚Äôt gonna help us. Hopefully buying time w Biden will. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
When does Kamala get fitted for her official Biden mask?
Yeah, Biden‚Äôs VP choice clearly shook him.
What is your definition of awhile? Because Joe Biden was the Catholic on the Obama/Biden ticket.  Just as he is still a Catholic.   Your tweet is disgusting and offensive to many of us Catholics who support him.
Kamala Harris is officially Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate. Michigan supporters say it‚Äôs about time.
All of you vehemently denouncing the idea of voting Joe Biden and Kampala Harris... tell me YOUR plan then? Because &gt;&gt;ANYONE&lt;&lt; is better than Trump and I thought we ALL agreed on that?
When you do your piece on this, Kyle, don't forget to mention that 42% of Yang supporters said they wouldn't support Biden.
Yes and he should.   Kanye's whole idea was to help  T rump by costing Biden votes.

CNN: Sen. Kamala Harris is Biden‚Äôs VP pick.
Hey Jules did they grab him by the arm ala Biden? Whose basement do you live in Jules?
Agreed, Biden would want "Very Smart Guy,"  to speak at  convention.  #DNCLetYangSpeak #LetYangSpeakDNC  #LetYangSpeak

Oh, I'm out knocking on doors.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èBut that is my read on Trump's behavior and the reality as it stands. There are many foreign interests and a few Nations as well that have an interest in seeing Trump lose.  Notably two of the countries they're saying are denigrating Biden.
The worst thing that can come out of this demand of Joe Biden? He picks someone else &amp; black folks STILL support him. We'd be done as an electorate. Straight up neutered.
Him and Biden both ass Ts a L either way

They can and are. The interest that are entrenched in our government ignored this in 2016.  This will go on to change 0 votes, as it did in 2016. It will be used as an excuse. Unless of course Biden wins, in which case everything will be above board.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
It isn't a threat, it's a promise for every good citizen.  No one thinks your a Biden supporter. Biden doesn't support his own candidacy.
It will not change my mind. I‚Äôm voting for Biden regardless of who he chooses. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Black women are the core base of the Democratic Party. Joe Biden can‚Äôt win in November without their vote.
Of course it counts, it's exactly what I'm telling you will happen after the election.   They will write a headline that makes it look like foreign actors are against Biden, while the reality is foreign actors are against Trump.üëç
There are no reasons to vote for Joe Biden.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I'm over the road driver last month I went thru Pennsylvania,new York and ohio.  I seen  maybe 5 Biden signs.trump signs every third house.
HUNTER BIDEN 2024
don't underestimate the kind, frail persona of biden. he in reality plays that up. trying to look like he cares about people. a modern version of the Trojan horse.
People are going to freak out, but it will be after Kanye beats Biden for second place
Only your base is ignorant to believe that crap. The rest of us are smart and know the truth. Good thing we are the majority and will vote for Joe Biden come hell or high water.
If Biden picks big gretch as a vp im crying and running to the voting booths
Gov. Whitmer flew to Delaware to meet with Joe Biden, report says
Biden still loses to both Trump and Kanye.
The good news is Biden's gonna lose. The bad news is Trump's gonna win.
Hey  ad is a lie about Joe Biden. üñïüñïüñïüñïüñï
GOP voters will turn out bigly, Democrat voters will turn out for Trump.  Many Bernie Bros will stay home, after their candidate was screwed again. Many African Americans will vote for Kanye. There is no path for Biden.
You're describing America if Biden wins, which is not going to happen.
Again Dumpy:  Biden isn't the one who f*cked a porn star with a new wife &amp; 1 year old child at home, THEN, when on to pay this porn star hush money in violation of federal law.
I am watching, but not sitting back.  I am knocking on doors, why isnt Biden?I would. That's why I'm not voting for Biden or Trump.
Why Biden said he would veto it so no matter who‚Äôs in office that isn‚Äôt a progressive it isn‚Äôt happening so why should we support anyone else
Trump screws up on a phone call to Ukraine &amp; ends up exposing Biden's corruption. Trump's trying to destroy the post office &amp; ends up exposing Obama's corruption for trying to do the same.  Is it any wonder liberals hate him so much even though they're just like him?
If you're dumb enough to believe anything will be achieved during a Biden administration then you haven't been paying attention.  #LiberalMoron
#wrongtrump Sorry Mr President Trump these are the same Dumb Fucks that say there Christian and Wish Death again dont know how little over 15k can be trending but All You Are Sick Fucks I'm for Trump But I don't wish Biden death first he had dementia and soon his time be
It‚Äôs also pretty lame of  to not follow up with, ‚Äúso, do you not think those attacks (implying Joe Biden is a racist for working with segregationists and opposing busing) were true? Or what?‚Äù But he‚Äôd likely say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just a comedian‚Äù
Well joe Biden said she isn‚Äôt... and imagine trying to tell someone who to vote for based off their skin color, you‚Äôre racist.
Credit to her, I guess, for discrediting herself rather than saying ‚Äúit was a debate and we just disagreed (whether Joe Biden is a racist for working with segregationists and opposing busing).‚Äù
It is not surprising that the Jewish community is excited to be represented on the Biden-Harris ticket.   Kamala Harris‚Äôs husband, Doug Emhoff, is a member of the tribe, and two of Joe Biden‚Äôs children are married to someone who is also Jewish.
You're right. Democrats do want to lose. They proved it by choosing a Biden/Harris ticket that doesn't even support a public option to the ACA to go against Trump.
Biden has a beautiful German Shepherd.
Fr. Jim‚ÄîI do, however, get notifications on my home page that you liked such and such a tweet from ‚ÄúJoe Biden‚Äù on a regular basis. I know a tweet is not necessarily an endorsement, but dang. It is made quite publicü§î

Is there a way to turn Political Commercials off on streaming services because god damn I‚Äôm sick of all of them, Trump you suck, and Biden you suck
Your not wrong Go with your gut  Tell the others you feel better and more confident with Biden
Biden does not even support a public option. Its almost like the elites feel so secure in their power that they aren't even trying to hide the fact that the two parties are exactly the same anymore.
Gobermebt tha ghost andcspirit kamala harris and joe biden michelle aint gone becno president barack left
She's on her way to meet Joe Biden and she knows he's gonna cop a few feels so she wants some protection.
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs so different between Trump and Biden?‚Äù Are your eyes open? Can you see? Do you need glasses?
There are good reasons for the press to distinguish between a liar who sees everything as a hoax after spending two years perpetuating the birther hoax and Biden who might reasonably believe that the second investigation was wrongly driven by congressmen fearful of Trump.
You would prefer Biden run instead, like the orange coward?
It's a debate among good people. I don't so much "support Biden" (I was rooting for Pete until the bitter end) as I want to save the republic
I agree. We're seeing that a lot with the far left hatred of Biden/Harris.  They really don't get that they are even more exhausting to a non initiated than even the trump cult.
People really be whining about Biden and Harris like federal agents haven‚Äôt been shoving American protestors into unmarked vans.
"It was a debate. Cackle cackle cackle. It was a debate." So let me get my bearings here. In the democratic "debates", where she called Biden a racist, Biden is now no longer a racist, since now she is the veep nominee?Because "it was a debate"? Sure.
Yeah, you can vote right now so you don‚Äôt have to fight the crowds.   TEXT ‚ÄúBIDEN‚Äù TO: 30330 so you don‚Äôt have to risk getting covid. Anytime from now till Nov 3rd. No ID required!

Only morons would vote for that woman sniffer Biden lol.
I think it's a genuinely complicated topic that is discussed by most everyone very clumsily in public. "Shut up and vote for biden" isn't a completely wild position when you're talking to a national audience and the communication is mostly one way and quite brief.
Tell your followers that President Trump has done more for the Black community in 3 1/2 years than Obama/Biden did in 8! Anyway Joe Biden is clueless as to be President! kamala is a SF liberal who is just a power hungry B. that is worst than Hillary Clinton!
Biden ordered the B1G to cancel football?  You're being sarcastic, right? No one legitimately thinks that, do they?
I will and will vote for President Trump! Joe Biden is a puppet of communist China and will tear down all Southern wall and let whoever come in and this will put the final dagger in the heart of Black folk!
Woman you are crazy as hell to think we Blacks are going to vote for a racist like Joe Biden and a Socialist Kamala Harris who makes Bernie Sanders look like Ronald Regan!
Biden - Harris - Just win baby!
exactly, welcome to the only thing Democrats are running on, praying to be able to steal the election.  Hell, Biden doesn't even take questions from Journos
Not going to vote for Trump it Ye. I'm not going to vote for someone who is mentally ill and can pop off at any given time (that's both of them). Biden isn't perfect at all. But he's for damn sure better than the other two
Trump Syndicate. RICO Act in 2021. That's if we win. Biden/Harris!
Hey Biden you couldn't pass rotc,you failed in rotc had nothing but c and ds in college your a failure,and a disgrace to be running for president. You and Kamala are a disgrace to man

AOC it‚Äôs no different than all the Rich Elite in Hollywood backing Biden! Shit Taylor swift did that today -

Is Trump resp. for all the deaths in the other 170 countries too? COVID-19 was going 2 play out exactly as it has no matter who the prez was. Trump did save thousands w/the travel ban(that admittedly wasn‚Äôt stringent enough). BIDEN OPPOSED IT! U think that would have HELPED?ü§®
Bruh, you‚Äôre call trumpers racist when there‚Äôs literally videos of Biden referring to blacks as animals
Much like 2018, voters in 1978 were disappointed in the sitting president. Two years into Carter‚Äôs only term, Republicans claimed three additional Senate seats, and 15 seats in the House. The Democrats are now poised to do something similar.
Yes ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs trying to lose‚Äù as he raises almost 50 million in two days after his VP announcement and is leading in all the polls. Courting Joe Rogan &amp; ignoring Black voters was definitely the winning strategy üòÇüòÇüòÇ

A couple more wins... didn‚Äôt Bernard lose Massachusetts? Haven‚Äôt you lost every single senate primary And the majority of House races? BTW, Jamaal Bowman &amp; Mondaire are backing Biden &amp; Kamala.
Spare me. Joe didnt get shit. The Democrats held secret meetings to stop Bernie. Multiple candidates dropped out at the same time. Again, you are nothing but a cultist. Biden didnt do shit. He was propped up by an entire machine made to maintain the status quo.

What the F..... Is his guy related to Biden!
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate
we have good relations with turkey right now not perfect but biden would destroy are relations.
President Trump needs to expose Politicians and drain the swamp period.  I def. voting for Trump but he has to do alot from now and Nov. 3 to be re-elected!  biden is way ahead in the polls right now!  politicians need to come together about Mail in voting.
I thought we were and was wrong.  Only thing that could cause a major pullback is a huge increase in the virus or the market freaking out about a biden win.  The Fed plus Treasury will do anything to prop it up

It sucks that the Overton Window in the US shifted right 1970-1994 but you're not going to (literally) get anything done without working with a party establishment anyway; Politics is inherently about building consensus, and while I'm further left than Biden, I understand that
Have you decided to vote for Biden yet?
And ignoring that crowd is how Biden won that state
Interesting facts about Kamala Harris that you probably didn't know, PLUS see what rumor got "shut down" by reading more, below! -Randi Myles
But his momentum is w/ young voters. The same momentum Bernard had in that state and he lost it. Nobody thought Biden would win Massachusetts. Ed Markey is Dependent in those same voters. POC support Kennedy &amp; in a close Race can be decisive &amp; we‚Äôre never polled right
Why should they lay off. Women day they equal. And we blacks are equal. So have at it. She can certainly fish it out she prove this by her attacks on Biden. Do Trump, Pence media go for it.
Why should we she and Cory Booker told us how racist Biden was. Are we to believe her now? Her record for putting others in jail was 70 % more blacks than whites. She is phoney. I
Why does Biden have 600 layers watching voting?? I do not trust that.
We must re-elect President Trump. Can you imagine a China lover in Joe Biden in the Outhouse and a V.P who is the most liberal senator in the Senate running our Country!
Y'all realize that all these polls with Biden smoking Trump are, as  said, "Bullshit Polls," right? Y'all got giddy like this in 2016 and you're doing it again.
The post office is touchy subject.  We know that either party will claim it‚Äôs rig if we use the postal service.  Trump trying to prevent that.  Just one mistake and it‚Äôs going to be a joke. Trump can‚Äôt lose on this post office thing.  Biden can bc when shit goes wrong. Trump warn
Well, that‚Äôs the Biden endorsement I wasn‚Äôt expecting...

"You cannot go to a 7-11 or a Dunkin Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent. I‚Äôm not joking.‚Äù Biden said this
‚ÄúUnless we do something about this, my children are going to grow up in a jungle, the jungle being a racial jungle with tensions having built so high that it is going to explode at some point.  We have got to make some move on this.‚Äù Biden quote
Why don't America cut all ties with the Chi-Coms! They steal everything we come up with. They send out a virus all over the worlds to try and get their boy Biden in the Outhouse!
From Joe Biden‚Äôs website.
it‚Äôd be great if it was renamed Make Billionaires Never Again Act &amp; it was ready for Biden to sign on day 1; assuming he wins.
But YOU stepped all over this fantastic news by going after Harris and Biden instead of delaying comments on them to promote the agreement. YOUR fault! Not the fake news fault. YOU handed them the methodology to undermine your achievement
Even after Biden wins in a couple months, does anyone really think the social fabric in America will ever be the same as prior to the advent of the virus?

Biden said Trump‚Äôs travel ban from China was racist and he wouldn‚Äôt have done it. Fauci said it saved lives. #NeverBiden
100% of Biden are bogus.
‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs latest remarks reflect a demeaning and condescending trait among white liberal politicians. When you invite them to a meeting in the Black community, they take the biggest seat in the room without seeking permission.‚Äù

For the people in the back: Biden and Harris are not radical leftists. Run your campaign and blast the other side and do your thing, but don‚Äôt scare people with statements that are not true.
Speaking directly before Biden is huge for us! Happy with this news!
don't get me wrong, i'm voting biden/harris, but this bears repeating. WHEN they get into office, we still have so much work to do.
Never said Biden is adopting his platform en masse. But look at both then compare to Trump's. I.e. public option vs Medicare4all vs no plan at all. Both believe in democracy vs Trump's autocracy. Throwing out the baby w/the bath water isn't better just shows your bitterness.
My mother keeps calling me a Bernie bro bully while yelling at me about how I have to vote for Joe Biden or I'm personally responsible for Trump's reelection.

Remember when Joe Biden said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt work for you.‚Äù Remember that when you vote.
Yea right, the only traitors to go down will be low level people like the FBI lawyer that just pled guilty. The real criminals like Obama, Biden, Comey and Brennan will face no justice
That‚Äôs cause you tell so many lies!!! Biden a honest man!!!
Once again Andrew Knaggs is like every other Trumper who wants to act like Biden is diminished when there are so many examples of #Trump doing the same thing. When called out he says he's going to table it until the debate. Go to any media source &amp; watch the 100s on Trump
I keep replaying the part where she says, "She's on a Biden ticket not the  Sanders ticket...."
Why wouldn‚Äôt a benevolent police association endorse an admitted sexual predator? New York police would never pussyfoot around with a decent challenger like Joe Biden.
So Joe Biden is 3 yr older than Trump who we know is a stable genius He says so all the time You won't answer the question as to WHY YOU KEEP SAYING JOE BIDEN IS DIMINISHED When there are 100s of examples of #Trump doing the same thing #SuburbanHousewivesForBiden

Trust me I would have preferred bernie. I'm not enthusiastic about Biden, he is a very average candidate to me. But all that matters rn is getting Trump out since there's no other choice. Hopefully the next candidates are better
The year is 2021:   Trump has been physically removed from the White House after his loss.  Biden has implemented a national mask/testing strategy, eliminating COVID in 6 months.  USPS is fully funded.  College football teams are gearing up to start a fall season.  Life is good.
I never said Biden is good. He is pretty average imo. But he isn't Trump, and at this point that's all I care about.
Look, it says ‚Äúfor biden‚Äù
yes,  Biden told the world he would pick a black female now he's painted his butt in a box.   Democrats don't even like her  only far nutty one's Do.    She will be bossing the old man around  maybe even punching him   She looks the part

I got tested for Covid on Thursday morning. It only took 2 days to get the results back here in Canada. I tested negative and they contact trace where I live and work. This is how our numbers are so low. I am confident that Biden will save the U.S. when elected.

Muslim scholar slams media, Biden for reaction to Trump's 'epic and historic' Israel-UAE peace deal
Polled twice,they called looking for my daughter and I took there poll then they called me back a month later and asked what Biden could do to win his support, told them if he was magician and could turn into Ronald Reagan then maybe I‚Äôd consider but since he‚Äôs not then trump2020
I feel you there. This is what I use for the stubborn Berners and EWarren for Veep folks who are expressing their disdain. If I had the choice, I would‚Äôve wanted Sanders/Warren as the ticket, but there‚Äôs no reason for folks like me to *not* vote for Biden/Harris. Absolutely none
So That's good, no Joe Biden allowed!
Biden &amp; Obama pretended to care about the climate crisis, then did this--&gt;  "[Under the Obama Administration, oil production saw] an incredible 74% increase. In fact, in 2015, the U.S. pumped the most oil in 43 years."
Why should we believe he's going to do what he says? Biden's record shows he does not care about the climate--&gt;  "[Under the Obama Administration, oil production saw] an incredible 74% increase. In fact, in 2015, the U.S. pumped the most oil in 43 years."
Campaigning for Biden now?  You lie worse than he does.

Your profile says you're in Texas, it would be nice if that state was in play. I think your question is relevant. We vote for someone, I believe Joe Biden is a man of faith  integrity, honesty, and decency. I believe he will move our country forward and be a great President.
I‚Äôll agree on the hoax. I‚Äôm calling you out the February and March stuff. Biden was holding rally‚Äôs deep into March after a Trump stooped and Pelosi was telling people nothing to worry about. The democrats were actually worse. You can‚Äôt run by me with that argument

Biden is not the president and can make his case to the American people any way he‚Äôs sees fit...journalists have in part created Trump...the interview you did with him used to be the norm

Biden is not the president! WTF has happened to journalism and political commentary in this country?!? Should expect more from these people!

Horrible stupid Biden
People who are critical of Biden/Harris have good reason to be, especially those of us who are impacted by their political choices &amp; acting like that criticism is gonna cost them the election is dishonest &amp; stops them from dealing with accountibility.
Yeah. One thing is obvious by every possible metric‚Äîworking class white men are taking a hit and being reduced in society. It‚Äôs all coming from the left. Look at Biden‚Äôs forced VP pick based only on identity.
I'm a suburban single mom voting Biden/Harris.
It's designed to supress votes and sow doubt about the legitimacy of a Biden victory.
What Biden is saying. Americans are stupid! We tell them what you do! Like we do not have enough sense to protect ourselves. Beware this is the frist step to SOCIALISM! Bit by bit taking our freedom away.
FACT:  Unless Biden arrest Trump as soon as he Swears I DO- You will never see Trump serve a day in jail or court as long as he lives! Once he get on AF1, he will DISAPPEAR from the world to parts UNKNOWN!  If I see Trump in cuffs on Inauguration Day, I can die a HAPPY MAN!

August 15, 2020 and not one word out of Joe Biden and Kamala "Brown" Harris condemning the rioters and arsonist in our major cities. Not one word from these two bozos on China causing this virus and deaths. They just hammer President Trump who had nothing to do with this virus!
Joe "the bigger the lips, the hotter the sauce" Biden.
Biden condemned Trump for the China Travel ban, he‚Äôs an idiot that couldn‚Äôt pour piss out of his shoes if the directions were written on the soles.
Woke love of the "oppressed" and "the underdog" means that they have come to love Islam, which they imagine is some small-time resistance project. Obama-Biden actively promoted all sorts of Iran-linked people. They hate Israel.

True, but it's irresponsible and hypocritical to ignore that biden and his surrogate got on national tv and lied to the public saying it was safe to go out and vote during this pandemic. New York's governor mishandled the pandemic severely that led to the most deaths. 1/2
They are trying to change it now to a women of color. What ever works for them. Just like Obama taking credit for the economy before the China Virus, and now Biden taking credit for the latest peace agreement.  The Democrats will tell the truth even if it takes 10 different ways

The Blue Wave, my neighbors, the positivity Biden/Harris stirred up. We need to find a way to channel all the anger we have towards Trumpublicans into positivity for Biden/Harris. We're not out of the woods untill January 20.
Biden didn't ask for dirt Trump did although Trump's sons had business deals in Russia yet you didn't bat an eye about that..
The secret service answers to the president. January 20th he is no longer the president (unless reelected).. If Biden wins or it's in dispute, he's out, no matter what. The secret service won't follow his orders any longer.  At least I expect that's how it will work.
It's coming down to it. I dread to see all the Trumpublicans and Trumptards in line with no masks. It's going to get very ugly. No mask=Trump, Mask=Biden/Harris. You'll know before the Vote...

I hope Biden wins.  So the world can laugh harder than they ever have at Americans.  Americans will think its a SNL skit and it really is creepy, sleepy, dementia joe.  Now that scary.  I want him to win so the dumb/Dem look like bigger fools.  Republicans forever after joe.

I'm not saying I'm going to fucking like voting for Biden/Harris, but fucking hell people, don't throw all the power Bernie has given us down the toilet because the DNC is a corrupt mess. Water is wet. The DNC will never represent leftists. It can't, it's entire ethos is neo-lib.

it‚Äôs clear you only read Trump tweets. Biden referred to Trump labeling it the ‚ÄúChinese‚Äù virus as xenophobic, not the travel ban. He actually agreed with it because it was backed by science. You‚Äôre not going to win the argument that Trump handled this well. Move along ‚ù§Ô∏è

So will you vote for Biden and Harris Ben ?
and you know that how? Biden actually believes in science. Him and Obama literally developed a pandemic response guide in 2016 for the next administration (and it wasn‚Äôt followed). Funny you even brought him up when we were talking about Trump‚Äôs failed response.
And true to form, if Biden does lose, those with questions will be blamed as opposed to the folks whose job it was for the last 3 almost 4 years to present the right candidates and platform. Or if they win you will have leadership that promised nothing but to not be Trump. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Biden is a warmonger who along with Obama/Hillary invaded Libya, drone bombed seven countries and fueled Syrian/Yemeni war and sent American soldiers to fight useless wars. How is any of that showing empathy and leadership?
Vote for Biden anyway.  Count on Biden to put together a team of advisors that he will actually listen to.  He‚Äôs not going in thinking he has to know everything.  He just has to know how to lead.  Besides we have a better shot at surviving the next 4 years with Biden for Prez.
A vote for Biden is a vote supporting his warmongering with Obama, their invasion of Libya, their drone bombing in seven countries and the death of 100,000 brown people. F off with your democracy. A vote for Biden is a vote for war and murder.
It‚Äôs cool. Biden/Obama led Libyan invasion, drone bombed seven countries, fueled arms to Syria/Yemen conflict and led to 100,000 dead brown people. So if you vote for Biden, I consider you having voted to bomb brown people.

I will predict how this is going to go, because this is how Putin does it: (1) In October, Bill Barr will arrest Joe Biden. It doesn't really matter if Biden did anything illegal, he will be in jail. (2) No matter what the outcome, Trump will declare victory in the election. 1/4

These polls suggest that Biden has a lock on the popular vote, and an almost certain lock on a November victory. State polls suggest the same. He's ahead of Trump by 6 points or so in Michigan, for example.

Ask the black colleges if he‚Äôs a racist,everything you said sounds like something cnn edited to fit there narrative,nice try though ,Biden‚Äôs a true racist and hariris will say or do anything they want to get power.

How can Joe Biden and Kamala Harris cut America‚Äôs pudding, when they haven‚Äôt cut America‚Äôs meat?
No, VP Biden chose her as his running mate because she will win.
Your privilege is allowing your political purity to outweigh the needs of the many who will immediately benefit from Trump no longer being in office.  Is Biden perfect?  No.  Is he leagues better than Trump. Without question.  Your privilege blinds you to that.
A Biden Admin needs to OUTLAW or UNDERCUT ANY &amp; ALL CONSPIRACY &amp; RACIST POSTING MEDIA!!! DRIVE THEM BACK UNDERGROUND AND IN THE MINORITY!  ...Like Bigfoot in the woods...
this is accurate, anyone who claims to be a leftist and equates Trump with Biden is an insane person. I don't like Biden at all, but he's getting my vote because he's not Trump.  The democratic party deserves to continue receiving persistent criticism, though.
8 years of Biden/Harris will finish the deal. California for all.

Right? Our rights have been ignored...with Biden, they will be stripped entirely.

America is a failed state. I am on strike. I support a #GeneralStrike. I will not vote for Biden. I will not vote for Trump. Can we choose a color other than yellow for our vests? Good guys wear black.

But hey, at least Biden is a real Catholic and believes in God. The Cheeto doesn‚Äôt and yet the religious right accepts him without question. SAD!
I will be unblocking  when Biden defeats Trump in November - just to rub it in his face.
I just hope Joe Biden keeps talking. üòÇüëåüèΩ
I really hope it‚Äôs not a golden shower thing. Because we already know Trump‚Äôs a piss-piggy, and it won‚Äôt benefit the Biden campaign at all.
So here we go again the democrats are taking black votes for granted by putting Kamala "the Gorilla" Harris Brown on the ticket. She is suppose to help democrat candidates in the South. Remember " you ain't black if you vote for President Trump. China Joe Biden!

That will probably be the last press conference he will be attending during this administration!! When Biden gets in office he'll probably give that reporter a medal!!

I am voting Green. I am giving my vote to good people. I am not rewarding the evil duopoly with my vote. It is not fair to these good people for me to vote for Biden so you can go back to brunch. If you wanted me to vote blue, Bernie should have been the nominee.
1. military budget thing is irrelevant because they both will do it 2. Biden is pro public choice healthcare which will cover 97 percent of people. a 6 percent increase from now which is millions of people 3. Biden is also GND, lgbt rights, etc the utilitarian calculus is simple
Dr Biden: I believe this country is stronger when the least of us is supported and lifted up. A rising tide lifts all ships.   Melanie: A rising tide lifts the ships and make us the stronger country of the least people. Close enough.

Because that shit was laughable. ZOOM OUT. It‚Äôs so simple. He knew Biden had been super dirty in Ukraine. He asked to look into it. Dems spun it in an insanely dishonest way. It didn‚Äôt work. Guess what? HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT BIDEN. The rest was a legal assassination attempt. MISSED
Umm no. Not what happened. He said, they found no evidence of Russian collusion. What you just said was a false translation from the fake news. As far as Ukraine, Biden is up on  federal charges over there for crimes. All trump did was point it out. Dems are really that ballsy
Biden is not going to do anything to help with climate change either. Biden is a liar. I don‚Äôt trust him to do anything without checking with his billionaire donors first. That is why I am voting Green. They care about the planet. Biden doesn‚Äôt.

All the questions the Press Corps poses to Trump lately, are softball, lame ass questions. It almost seems you (not you, Kelly) are afraid of him. Just like everyone in his administration. A Press Conf is of little value these days. I don't blame Biden and Harris for passing
I mean, it‚Äôs a little easier to fact check Biden in real time than Trump. It‚Äôs not like  has access to the Micro Machines auctioneer to cover the misleading statements and flat out lies Trump spews.

Anybody here who thinks Biden, if elected, will last out a term is more demented than Joe.

It doesent!  Politico is a partisan rag and the rest of the media in the US are in the bag for Biden and the Democrats. Election day will prove who is right or wrong.
The only reason Joe Biden has any chance of winning is because of minority voters. If only whites could vote, Trump would easily be reelected.
Here‚Äôs what I just CANNOT wrap my head around...Does Jill Biden hate her husband? Or is she so power seeking that seeing her husband utterly humiliate himself doesn‚Äôt bother her enough to stop it? Even then has ANYONE told her that Joe won‚Äôt have a lick of power should he win?
I agree with you!  POTUS will win big. I am one of the silent majority but I am building up the courage to put my TRUMP/PENCE sign in my front yard. Just on my street in my small town so many have their signs out. I have not seen one Biden sign.üá∫üá∏

Only voting Biden cause I have no choice.
Life gives us choices. Sometimes, the choices aren‚Äôt pleasant. Bernie lost. Biden won. Biden chose his VP. Do you vote for the current person in office or Biden? Being obtuse is complaining about the two choices after 40 states have decided against what you wanted.
Uh... no. That‚Äôs literally not at all what I said.   If Ava wants to vote Biden, that‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôll likely be voting Biden. I have no choice. But pretending this shit never happened and sweeping it under the rug in the guise of ‚Äúit‚Äôs anti-Black‚Äù is mad corny to me.
How about Harris before being a vp candidate called Biden a racist and she also said she believed all his accusers in regards to sexual assault.
If but Trump is your only case for Biden then you have no case at all to me, because the Democrats were suppose to produce a candidate that can beat Trump
Ava, you really shouldnt make any more political films and profit off of the ‚Äúblack plight‚Äù after saying you dont care about Kamala and Biden‚Äôs history of opression. Its not ignorant but inherently evil.
I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs wrong to vote Biden/Kamala. I probably will. I‚Äôm simply saying it‚Äôs wrong to pretend Kamala is a perfect, unproblematic candidate. She has harmed the Black community just as much as Trump has. Possibly more.
There are two people on the ballot. I asked which one did you prefer. Your answer was neither. So, it goes back to my original post. You can vote for Biden, trump or abstain. This is a democracy. Not enough people agreed with you during the primaries. So what are you going to do?
Well the joke is on all of us because we will be nothing in 4 years regardless of who is president.  Either a Trump destroys the tax revenues and out debt becomes unfinanciable, or Biden green new deals and sells us to China and out debt becomes unfinanciable.  Pick your poison

Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris have put more Black Men &amp; Women in jail than any Republican I know. I think it‚Äôs justified to demand they make it right if they want our vote.
If Ava was saying that she wanted to vote Biden/Kamala while also acknowledging the harmful policies they supported, I‚Äôd respect it. But a Kamala vote isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôm doing happily. And no Black person should be, especially someone who claims to care about mass incarceration.

Of course. Plus she deserves it. My guess though is Biden will lose more white votes than the black votes he gains. I hope I am wrong.
He talks out of both sides of his mouth. One time he says one thing. Then five minutes later he's saying something different. And he can't stand it when Biden is right and he's not.  Trump has to be center of attention for everything. He can't stand it when Biden or Harris talk.

You were the best senator and grilled everyone came in front of you. And you are going to be the best VP after you and Biden win
I would love it if Joe Biden would use words during the debate that he knows trump won't understand.  Each time he asks trump a question, be sure to add a word thats pivotal to the question, that trump won't know the meaning of.
#SturgisRally if we bring c19 to all the states. Just blame the China virus on trump. He stops flights as WHO, crazy Nancy and creepy; sleepy Joe Biden said trump wrong for stopping flights from China.  Even WHO said he wrong.  Dems forget. Joe gets a pass . He has dementia
What‚Äôs the point anyway?  Biden will do what he wants so Ro‚Äôs vote against the platform means nothing.

Kanye is targeting the same Black men 45 is so if they go w/ him in a swing state like Wisconsin ( Milwaukee) and he pulls from 45 number he got last time ( even a little) that helps us. A lot. White ppl who claim Kanye will pull from Biden don‚Äôt understand our community. He‚Äôs
