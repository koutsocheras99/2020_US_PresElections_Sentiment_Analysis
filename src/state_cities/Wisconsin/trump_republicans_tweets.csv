He was too busy selling America to China, covering up Benghazi and fast and furious and spying on Trump.
Remember when this guy was held up as the decent alternative to Trump?  Good times.
Nancy is so out of touch that she does not realize that working Americans and Middle class ARE Republicans and the TRUMP SUPPORTERS!
Trump's Tulsa rally claims another.
Trump sounds like the illiterate kid trying to explain that ‚Äúof course I read the book‚Äù while simultaneously saying ‚Äúbooks are stupid, I‚Äôm not reading them‚Äù and ‚Äúyou never told me to read the book‚Äù. He‚Äôs so bad at covering for his ignorance and his evil.
It‚Äôs a toss up üßê. Who‚Äôs the bigger asshole ? Jim Jordan or President Trump ? Jordan licks Trumps boots all day. It‚Äôs not surprising, their both sexually sick in the head. Jordan likes them young too .( boys ) what a prick. Mr. tough guy, wear a mask and jacket.
"I've been tougher on Russia than any President. "(What Trump Says) 1) Doesn't bother to look into whether Putin is paying bounties for the murder of American troops in Afghanistan.   2) Pulls 12,000 Troops Out of Germany.  (Putin's Wet Dream.)  #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica
Trump when Putin asks him to do LITERALLY ANYTHING
Susan Rice is headed to jail.  Kamala threatened all Americans who supported Trump if Biden wins, plus her past is so filthy.
I spoke with my postman.  He said the only way things could be corrupted would be with this guys help.  Remembering, the fake ballots only need to go to strategically placed locations sufficient to help Trump secure the electoral college.  So when Trump's crying fraud via mail in
Do You Hate Trump
Who would vote for you‚ùì  You are a mini-Trump.  You bring NO original ideas, you just reverb Trump.  We don't need more hate.  We need someone who wants to be better.  You CLEARLY don't.
YES, IT WOULD BE ALMOST AS BAD AS IF TRUMP GOT IT, GRADUALLY STARTING GETTING SICK, BECAME REALLY REALLY SICK, GOT PLACED ON A VENTILATOR AND DIED.
Trump just said Russia Russia Russia. What is he Jan Brady. Marcia Marcia Marcia.

loves these photos. He can put on his Trump glory board
Yea it‚Äôs called insider trading. Trump tells all his goons to load up on Kodak stock before it goes nuts. Then the peanuts they put into it, jumps 500% and they profit off of it.   Same thing Martha Stewart went to prison for.
Hey now!  I don‚Äôt know if I would consider that ‚Äúthrowing‚Äù #fauci2020

Did you know him or point this out as he supported Trump. I don‚Äôt see many posts from you on inner city Milwaukee
Thank you.
Trump is the whiniest President ever. Every other statement is how he is being treated unfairly. Everyone picks on him and never gives him credit.   ‚ÄúAsk not what your country can do for you, ask why the country treats me so badly.‚Äù

Hold Trump responsible!
Bunch of BS to blame Trump.  These were riots way before Trump and Barr sent in Federal officers.  Stop your lying.  The Left is full of hate and now we see it first hand in these cities.
If Fox News, who is known for pushing your pathetic agenda, gaslighting the people of America, IT'S CLEAR that the shit you sling is RADICAL TRUMP PROPAGANDA.
Translates To:  If There's Violence In The Streets Of The United States, You Better Believe Trump's Behind It.
This is Trump‚Äôs America! The violence is his work! The division is his work! The lies are his and his alone. Do not re-elect him!
That's one Trump way of looking at things and then there is reality.
agrees with Trump to shoot any and all protesters with rubber bullets
Why wouldn‚Äôt Trump want groups like that to embarrass themselves? You shoot your own group at a peaceful protest? Why would you have a round in the chamber, with the safety off, and your finger on the trigger? NFAC is helping The President almost as much as BLM

Up like Donald Trump
in 2 years will probably not run for office. He is as criminal as Trump
I guarantee Trump will make sure it gets ugly, riots, more broken windows ect. He realizes he‚Äôs losing BIG time. There‚Äôs no one to take care of him. Watch a lot of Republicans will start to bail on him, they want to keep their jobs. Their fucked up.
Encourage all those in government with info on Trump to come forward.  Guarantee them their jobs back once you win.
FEMA Sends Faulty Protective Gear to Nursing Homes Battling Virus    Typical Incompetence running rampant under Trump Regime.
Problem is no communication - uncoordinated.  If feds can help, great - but what‚Äôs the plan?  Trump‚Äôs problem is he‚Äôs a boss, not a leader.  Bosses have folks rowing in all directions, throwing bodies at the task willy-nilly.  Leaders more efficiently coordinate the effort.
Welp, I think they liked getting punched in the head. Trump breeds hate
It‚Äôs so Trump of him
I don‚Äôt see what fed will actually do to help the neighborhood crime that Trump says he can fix. Chicago has a lot of police as it is. It‚Äôs a social issue

Wow JD! There are more Trump supporters in the union than leadership might have you believe. Teaching remotely is way more difficult than the classroom. I worked many, many long days last spring. Planning this summer, yes, I'm already planning, has been a bear too.Ok honestly I cant tell if Trump is trying to delay the election for his own gain or if he has also figured out that everyone voting absentee will cause a shit ton of voter fraud.
so next Trump plans to steal someone's eulogy with a photo op - remember you have 2 channels!
I just realized something. Trump's "new tone" didn't even last a half of a

He survived cancer.  He couldn't survive Trump.
We do have a bunch of Trump photos of him groping his daughter and looking at her like she is what's for dinner.

You know what's funny?  Biden said he'd try this back in April. CALLED IT.

I can't believe calling Trump "Mr. Make Matters Worse" is probably the high point of the week for D leadership comms.
Just letting you know, Trump is hanging out at your place watching Fox News.
No big surprise! And people vote for someone like him? If it was a Democrat, people/GOP would be up in arms. This is OK with you? Not holding Trump accountable? Shameful and disgusting!

A lack of voting might be the single biggest factor in keeping the will of the people suppressed. People don‚Äôt vote but somehow want things to change. People don‚Äôt vote and then get mad when Trump is elected. Voting is more effective than protesting or repeating a popular slogan

Until the American people revolt he will continue to be dictator. Look at it this way: Since we're going to lose our comfort zones either through fighting Trump or by bowing to his abuses, why not at least have a chance to get our comfort zones back after he's out of office?
A spark from Trump, the single biggest threat to the United States since WWII, will light a fire across this country and make the death and destruction from covid look like a beautiful dream.  So who will stop him? Toothless Democrats? Spineless Republicans?
If Trump looses then tries to stay, MANY in state, local and federal law enforcement would either, "Just follow orders," or gleefully carry out whatever brutal, disgusting, UNAMERICAN acts they are ordered to do.  We are in an extremely dangerous time.
Hmm I wonder what it could be
For Fuchs sake... weighing the love of sex vs the hate of trump.
Does Trump say anything that these clowns think isn't a joke?
Here‚Äôs hoping you will join Donald Trump on the unemployment line come this November.
I don't think he can do anything for the Republicans to turn on him, he has a mind cult going on. They are brainwashed by trump
They wanted someone just as mediocre and small minded as they are. For the first time they saw a mirror for themselves. Trump is the result of our country rewarding bullies for far too long with positions of power. Trump is the sad logical conclusion of a party that has no ideas.
Maybe he wanted to make a statement to the black community to vote for Trump more than he wanted to live! It must have been very important to him to be there.
All of this Obama BS is so stupid/unfounded and just another Trump distraction. ü§¨ Trump‚Äôs economy is now the worst loss in all history of US. TRUMP What else do you expect? He‚Äôs a complete failure in private life, failure in running our govt and now a failure in COVID deaths.
you have the audacity to blame President Trump for Herman Chain‚Äôs death, when your very own brother sent 1000‚Äôs of vulnerable seniors to their death in nursing homes? It‚Äôs obvious you‚Äôve spit in God‚Äôs face and embraced Satan!
So is it just me, or are the Democrats actually unable to focus on more th an one thing at time? When the year started, all they wanted to talk about was impeaching Trump. March &amp; April was COVID. May was fighting against reopening. June &amp; July, rioting. But no word on Hong Kong!
As much as I disagree with Mr Biden, he has been a public servant for decades; Whilst Trump has zero political experience or competency - to group them toghether is fallacious
So I‚Äôm confused.  You said that Trump was using Federal troops to quell protesters, but the only people they have engaged or arrested are rioters and those attacking Federal property.    So by your logic, Lewis supported rioters.
Hey, rapist  How's this for a Reversal of Fortune?   Guilty, hypocritical, pedophile.  Do the right thing,   And Impeach again,  Surely Trump references are currently redacted.

Trump Keeps Criticizing Universal Vote By Mail. But The Nation Isn't Doing That
Trump campaign temporarily pauses ad spending to review its messaging
Barack Obama was making a major speech. The GNP tanked with worst report since reports began in‚Äô47. An American died of COVID every minute yesterday, so Trump was Trump trying to obscure the above. He failed. His comments about delaying the Nov. 3 election were unconstitutional.

I hope you're right,  Anthony.  I am amazed, however, of all the 'Trumpers' not budging from their admiration of this very flawed person.  Trump backers are self assured and enthusiastic... no facts will deter them.
The American people are no better: Heard Trump say he could do anything because he was President Watched Trump order peaceful protestors gassed for a photo op Heard Trump say he was going to send troops into our cities to "dominate" our streets Watched and did NOTHING.
Nobody wants to come here! The trump virus! #NobodyLikesTrump
What do you liken Trump to, he didn‚Äôt even show up at the Rotunda in Washington DC to pay his respects.
Administration issued a national call to action Thursday, asking people who have recovered from covid-19 to¬†donate blood plasma¬†to help others fight the disease and boost the nation‚Äôs supply.
Watched Obama give the eulogy at today‚Äôs ceremony for John Lewis - lovely, complementary, charming, a bit funny but also incredibly moving and inspiring - and legitimately wondered who would ever want trump to deliver their eulogy, and how insulting and whiny it would be.
Odd ass comment coming from the VP to the President who gets off on attacking moms and any other American who doesn‚Äôt think he‚Äôs great. Trump is a bully.
All this former president news reminds me that Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Donald Trump were all born in the same year
Reads as if Epstein was outlining a "defense" for her, knowing he might face increased scrutiny once Trump actually announced his candidacy.
You mean like when President Trump attended John Lewis‚Äô funeral?
By Freeman‚Äôs own logic, Trump was also right to teargas and beat protestors outside the White House. So he can keep rewriting history as he likes
‚Äú[...] the fierce urgency of the day was best summed up by [...] a glimpse of Stacey Abrams. Like all the other mourners, she was wearing a face mask because of the pandemic. On it was written a single word: ‚ÄòVote.‚Äô ‚Äù

What are you yelling about? Nobody‚Äôs defending her except her lawyers. And trump who wished her well
What - short of an open admission of his intent to become dictator - will get the American people to stop him. Congress clearly won't. It's up to us. Do we fight or cower in fear &amp; wait for Trump's troops to come for us? Voting blue won't matter if there's no election. It's time.
You don‚Äôt need a budget. Spend your time packing. Here are honorable presidents. Trump will never be on this team. Kinda like kickball in elementary school. #VoteBlue2020
Trump‚Äôs supporters are easy. He never offers anything to his supporters but hate fear and anger. No policies to for new jobs. No new Health Ins. to replace ACA if he can ever destroy that. He offers nothing concrete except old time statues. His supporters don‚Äôt ask for nothing.
No, he doesn't.  I really need everyone to understand this. Trump is not some pied piper of fascism. He's a bumbling moron.  The people who support him are evil. He's not changing them. He's revealing them.

Because that's what the Trump Administration has been from Day One. A hostile foreign incursion into our nation. President Elect Biden won't be taking over for an American President. He will be evicting an enemy asset from Barack Obama's chair.
COVID19 is endemic now, and we aren't even allowed to leave our country. That's how badly Trump fucked up. We are being banned from other countries because of the mismanagement. They should be using the Fed's to distribute aid instead they protect statues of traitors.
When Trump loses on November 3rd, and he will, there will not be a "transition." There will be a mad dash to burn all the evidence of their corruption and criminality. Smoke will waft from the White House like a Chinese consulate ordered to close.
The idea is 2 lower transmission rates so that R falls bellow 1 Even if a mask isnt foolproof it can still have enough of an effect to stop a pandemic. Trump could have asked small buisness owners to step up and innovate in terms of mask design. We could have a whole new industry

People in this case were the top government officials.  trump let this virus get out of hand and then mishandled it.  This lead to the quarantines that wont go away.  He wouldn‚Äôt lead and tell his followers to wear masks.  Look at Cain, he died following that fool.  Wake up man.

No, 2012 had more to do with giving us Trump because of the nature of the campaign. But I would point out this was brewing much earlier. The Clinton era, with all of the Arkansas conspiracy theories, was our warning. The Obama-Muslim stuff should've set off alarms. We ignored it.
A narrow loss, or only a Trump loss, could lead too many in the GOP to believe it's somehow "the Never Trumpers' fault) and allow them to escape the consequences of their decisions. Anyway, that's an idea I'm tossing around in my head that I'll probably explore.
A bit. But think of how they cycled through the candidates, exercising their id rather than their reason. For example, Bobby Jindal was never considered, but Ted Cruz and Ben Carson were. Even then Cruz could've stopped Trump... if the GOP voters wanted Trump stopped.
Putin said he‚Äôs got someone interested in the German property, hoping Trump can get all his stuff out by the end of the month.
Good question. The Koch-publicans want to shrink the Federal government. Chile under Pinochet is their idea of a successful country. And Trump's incompetence serves their purpose.
I purposely raised my kids in a diverse suburban neighborhood. So happy I did... the dream of our family is that soon we will no longer be bothered by the trump crime family.
My opponent has embarrassed Wisconsin on numerous occasions.   Remember this one?  Nothing screams out of touch like this move he tried. He's an unproven Trump puppet.   Let's turn up the heat, help me get there!
Good. They should do the right thing for their voters.
It‚Äôs wild how quick this story faded from the national convention. Imagine what they would‚Äôve done if this happened with Barack or Hillary! How indignant they‚Äôd be. But since it‚Äôs Trump, they‚Äôre all ‚Äúmeh‚Äù
We know you‚Äôve become a Trump boot licker or worse.  It‚Äôs unfortunate you‚Äôre not running in November and you‚Äôre hope people will forget this in 2022. Can‚Äôt wait for November to start cleaning the stain Trump and the rest of the Republicans have left on the USA.
They've milked the taxpayers enough. Anyway, Trump will be safe in solitary.
But  he ‚Äúbelieves‚Äù it. I think data and randomized studies don‚Äôt #trump that
As opposed to the Repubs, who were all about antifa and lies, trying to scare the public so Trump has a shot at winning the election. #FailureInChief  #Biden2020Landslide
Ask De Blasio (the actual communist revolutionary).  The NYPD is under his control not Trump's.  Dingleberry
You don't get to use our stories for publicity and political gain. Trump has spent decades trying to disenfranchise Indigenous people but it's an election year so now you "care."
In less than 100 days we can vote to get our state and country back on track.  Can we afford to give Trump another term? Scott Allen? We cannot afford to promote Scott Fitzgerald!  We expect better, donate today!
Because Barr and Trump are so corrupt. You‚Äôre right! I‚Äôm a doofus then.
Trump has talked up Remdesivir as well ... I tend to think this is more about who stands to lose a lot of money if HCQ works well enough when used early that it renders Remdesivir a much more rarely used therapeutic.
Remember when my opponent blamed lack of economic growth on abortion?   He's out of touch, unproven, and like all Trump republicans is on the wrong side of history. Both in policy and the people's need for true representation.
If you're frustrated, fed up, scared, mad, confused and wonder how did our country get to this...  Remember the strong hold Trump has on the GOP. So much that, when given a chance on a silver platter, the  didn't remove Trump from office.   Remember that in 98 days.
It sure is. There reality truth, and than the democrats version of events. Very sad that we got here as a country, they still don't understand they are why Trump is President.

So it would have been ok if he stood in front and blamed Trump and the police?
Only the twisted foolish ignorant minds of the lefties blame an American for this virus. It happened in China and the Chinese Communist party is responsible only. Trump was criticized by Biden for his China travel blockade. But you shyster lefties don't care. Worse with Biden.
This is Trump‚Äôs America! The violence is his work! The division is his work! The lies are his and his alone. Do not re-elect him!
Trump didn't CAUSE the virus. No one blames the virus on Trump except you and the useless media.
A qualified yes. My fear is that Trump will send federal goons into every major American city. Protestors will push back. And Trump will use the "unrest" to cancel the election.
Violence against property. Or none at all. Why do you side with fascists?
Because of my strong focus on my job, campaign, kids, and just like Trump I was never asked, I will not have time to throw out the first pitch at any little league or tee ball games this season.
What he mean is a V-shaped stock market recovery.  Government spending is doing that. Once the plug is pulled on the working stiff it will drag down the market.  Kudlow predicted unemployment would decline despite surges in new coronavirus infections.
You‚Äôre confusing Democrats with Republicans. They‚Äôre becoming known for their voter fraud:
With that reasoning anyone associated with the Trump administration should not be paid because they created this mess.  Do your fucking job and fix this mess.

Trump now says he's sending his goons to Milwaukee. If he does, there will be fighting in the streets. Here, and in every city in the U.S. with a Democrat mayor.  He could use the unrest as an excuse to cancel the election.   Tell me it's not possible.
Your Trump Derangement Syndrome is just off the charts.  If he golfed with a transgender multiracial alien you would still call him a Nazi....with Jewish grandkids.
You think Trump's life started 3 years ago? Seriously, did you eat paint chips as a child?
It's very surreal to truly think about my 7 years as a council member, then compare with 3+ years of Trump. The standard local folks are held to and the expectations are just so VASTLY different.   It's both depressing and motivating at the same time. Please vote!

President Trump will win in 2020. Biden's not going to run in 24  82yo. President Trump is not going to run in 24. Ivanka Trump might run in 24. Or Donald Trump jr. The stupid Democratic Mayors not stopping cities from being destroyed and they don't want the President's help.
President Trump puts in a double shift work day of 17 hours per day. Joe Biden doesn't have the stamina! Joe couldn't even do a 6 hour work day. Biden has a damaged brain. He's likely to have a third aneurysm or stroke.  You're not an American, stay out of our politics.
Trump didn't "give" anything. He signed off on a dem bill.  The stimulus and $600/week were authored by House Democrats.  Credit where it's due

Rep. John Lewis is an important enough historical figure that every living President should have honored him and attended his funeral. What does it say that President Trump cannot put his ego aside and honor a man who gave so much to all of us?
Dam, Trump must be up to flabby butt in debt to Russians and he is definitely in debt to many of us in America. Also, Putin or someone must have real damning info or photos of Trump in a SERIOUSLY compromised position! I doubt it's only golden showers! Let's dig deeper, ,ü§ìüá∫üá∏

I agree Andy. This was a dumb move by POTUS. People are already saying publicly that they expect Trump to refuse to leave office if he loses, or establish martial law before the elections etc. He has simply added fuel to this fire. Surely he knows that. So why?
Meanwhile #tRump wishes death on millions of #Americans including school aged children.
We all must ride with Biden, he's a human being with a normal mind. Trump's been given more money, without doing anything but supplying the parties. Not how good businesses are developed that  have staying power. One by one the traitors will be uncloked
Trump is a bit 'Downs' afflicted I feel. In his mind, if he shuts down one communication, he's got control. Humans communicated without phones or computers or post offices for centuries
I think he is laying the groundwork for Barr‚Äôs DOJ to go to key swing states (like mine, Wisconsin) if the election is close and challenge the outcome in court as the product of fraud. Sure, this might be distraction in part but floating this trial balloon is standard Trump MO.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.

Trump has taught his people to do what he does: when you have absolutely NO data to support something you want, don‚Äôt let that dissuade you. Trump uses the phrase ‚Äúa lot of people say.‚Äù Barr uses ‚Äúcommon sense.‚Äù But facts are facts: mail-in absentee voting does not promote fraud.

I honestly remember as a free comment day before he was given an idea to make $, Trump said this "when someone does me harm or injured my biz" (to that effect, as it's been awhile) Trump said "I get even 7 times over"! I'm sure all this is researchable!
I remember all this about Trump U, he had back then a daily biz tip on his promoted daily email promoting himself, someone joked that he could teach biz, all assumed his supposed expertise would b free, but then if you wanted to read anything, Pay Up Front
Trump's making this crap up, starved for attention, next thing well see is him 'mooning' the news cameras! Yuck, Always wanted to see flabby brown stained  cheeks! Someone bring a Bible, someone bring the candle, vestments, I'll bring a sharpened crucifix. Forgive me Godüôèüèºüíõ
Of course, he's been promised a 'cut', Trump does nothing unless, he gets a big slice of the cake, if it ever gets baked! Trump likes getting baked himself, ask all women, whose bodies, he's cut into with his stubby cutlery. üëöüëó‚õèÔ∏èüó°Ô∏èüî™
Donald Trump doesn't even have the polite manners of a rattlesnake, the rattlesnake gives a warning before the venomous bite. Shakes the rattle, Trump just takes a big bite, leaves poison, which most people shake off, Trump's racism remains in a few! Hope he chokes if he bites me
If it hurts good people, Trump will do it. Maybe, one of these folks, applauded his words,kissed his ass, promised better ratings! Let's get our funds back from Trump, he's misused us in US, spends our $ on himself, we earned our $, Trump steals it. Think, dig, blow the whistles!
Of course Trump would not like anyone kneeling to show God, love n respect for giving us a democracy where sports are played w rules. Trump doesn't know anything about respect for others, he just know anything about anything, but cruelty,. racism, as a Satan worshipper.  üëø

there's evidence that you are correct. but just like everything else trump, if there's no absolute proof, it never happened
do not include $1 for any Trump request (FBI building, WH remodel, etc) in the stimulus bill.
Trump doesn‚Äôt even give a Shit about Our U S Troops!!!!  Even when he found out about the Russian Bounty on the heads of Our Troops, trump talks 8 times to Putin and says nothing to Putin!!!!No warnings, Nothing !!! trump is Despicable to Our u S Military !!!! Uses them for Show
There is No National plan for Schools reopening, just telling Parents to send their Children into the Abyss!!!! Trump Nazis trying to Kill Your Children!!!!!!
I think we need to know more about Vlad Putin's agenda. Like trump was brought up in a racist house, think about Putin being in the KGB during the Soviet Union days. Both men have never looked at the world from all sides. It's their way or the highway üëΩ
Boris, if you are listening please find Trump‚Äôa tax returns.
My opinion is Trump thinks he can use our American military to protect him when he has to face the consequences of his crimes against us in America. All of us that have information about Trump must stop being afraid to tell it. Racism is killing people.
Is this real? üíÄ Since when is being in a public service job a position of tv ratings? Dam, get this Trump out. He hears something, does no homework, no planning , then runs with stuff like a gossiping fool. All people deserve a chance in life. Donald F-ed his up too often. üï∑Ô∏è
Trump is doing it at Putin‚Äôs direction ... and I think you know that.
‚ÄúI read a lot. You know, I read a lot. They like to say I don‚Äôt read. I read a lot. I comprehend extraordinarily well, probably better than anybody that you‚Äôve interviewed in a long time. I read a lot.‚Äù  ‚Äî President Trump, quoted by Politico.
Of course this is trump great medical professional advisor üëΩ
I found information that the troops Trump sent to Portland , wearing cammies or other uniform style outfits ,with only a patch on upper sleeve , "police", it's been said these federal troops are actually border patrol agents.  Pelosi has or is trying to stop Homeland from funding

So, the concern is that Harris would want for President after Biden‚Äôs 8yrs. Do they realize that dems need to be president for the next 50yrs to counter mitch/trump judges?
Biden picking a black woman is a mistake!!!he should just pic a good running mate. There no black woman with experience..except rice with bush but she's republican..she wouldn't lower herselve to run with biden and his socialist ways .can't wait for his decision. Vote RED TRUMP!!
So...Putin called and Trump jumped!
Why does Trump continue to happy talk the pandemic and lie about the numbers?! We want to hear from Dr. Fauci not the #LiarInChief!
Trump is a plain &amp; simple traitor to the United States of America! Just because he says things out loud in his blithering idiot manner does not discount his crimes!
That‚Äôs all too common, many of our friends have shared similar stories. trump is so divisive in countless ways.
All the trump supporters in West Texas rn are making me wanna puke. üôÑ so the president is visiting the Permian Basin.. It‚Äôd be way cooler if the man wasn‚Äôt a corrupt piece of shit. I can‚Äôt even choose sides, the system is all sorts of fucked. Thanks for coming to my TED talk.
I don‚Äôt seriously engage much on FB, but follow a few threads at times. I‚Äôve dropped a few others, but they weren‚Äôt family. The family case I referred to was a s-i-law, I just couldn‚Äôt resist, a lengthy post about how sad she was about all the unfounded attacks on trump.
We know why, Trump gets played by Putin &amp; Trump's so I love with Vlad or so in debt to Russians, he can't get out. Well, let's take Trump out, arrest his traitorous ass. Even Amendment 25 (I think) is in Constitution for reasons like Trump's actions! Use it!
To my knowledge, there is enough evidence to remove Trump &amp; his gang, now! Why or who is anyone in a position to do so, not done so?
Once again Trump shows Americans where his loyalty lies, Not with any concerns for our US military personnel, he just sits there &amp; kisses Putin's ass right in front of our eyes on news interview! There are regulations in place that could force Trump out, Why hasn't this been done
Surely the staff In the Pentagon know Trump's an insane traitor. They must have  clout to stop Trump's manical actions. Please step up, you top military personnel, you have an allegiance to protect Americans before any promise to follow a proven traitor
Trump obviously has a financial interest in promoting it and doesn‚Äôt care how many Americans it may kill!
Trump and the GOP win the awards for most stupid and most irresponsible!
How much more proof that Trump is a traitor to America than these comments? It's just icing on the cake of betrayal of American lives so Trump can get his snuggy huggies from his bf, his master, Trump's betrayed US to get $ &amp; approval from Putin üí©
It is terrifying that as a man, the death of 150 thousand people does not touch him on a human level, because that engagement would naturally lead a person in such a place of power to do something. I feel bad that President Trump has so little awareness of what government is.
I agree. Trump's a fool if he thinks he overthrow our American democracy. It's sad that Repubs even allowed Trump in the door. A few years ago, Trump convinced people &amp; many news medias that he was a biz whiz. Have we learned out lesson that people must b truthfully  informed?
We Americans that remain true to our  US Constitution need to take the time to actually read, listen &amp; watch this group &amp; use a variety of news outlets to determine what the truth is about Trump. To me, the truth about is obvious, he's been played by masters of trickery, he's üëø
Another question for Mary:  given the things Trump said yesterday, is it clear he is deteriorating mentally?
There are persons in all nations who are well trained to be on the look out for 'marks', no different than street hustlers but a dude ready in the money honey circles, Trump was easy pickings to be manipulated, Trump being so greedy, racist, he slept w Satan to support his habits
This is worth few minutes to read. I've often thought that after sad ass Trump burned his bridges in US, he was personally hungry for a friend &amp; he needed $ badly. Putin was a KGB officer, well indoctrinated in communism &amp; brainwashing techniques, think!
what are you doing to STOP Louis DeJoy from internally dismantling the USPS? What legislation have you introduced, supported, or amended to STOP this? I am a constituent who wants to know!

Trump's staged so many distractions that we forget that McConnell &amp; several other Repubs got loans or made lucrative deals with Russians. This screams at me, as soon as possible, US must put limits on congressional terms. It's ridiculous that a potus has 2 terms but Congress üëª
I assumed I‚Äôd be waiting...just like you. But I also wonder if Trump suddenly announced the vaccine release in late October if I‚Äôd trust it. Any last minute great breakthroughs would make me rethink the integrity of the development process.
Why did the Republican party allow Trump in the door in the first place? maybe because they were too busy plotting their own, 'how can I fill my coffers off the blood, sweat &amp; tears, of the wonderful people in America'? Trump had his tv show that gave a rosy picture to public
To #Hydroxychloroquine or not to Hydroxychloroquine?  On team "to" - Donald Trump &amp; Steve Bannon.  On the "not to" side - Dr. Fauci &amp; the FDA.  I'm going with the experts. If you're with Trump &amp; Bannon, you are what is referred to in the scientific community as a fucking idiot.
#Trump loses again. No guts, no glory.
This frightening, but I don‚Äôt see effective questioning. Just more of the same. A question is asked and Trump talks and talks about irrelevant issues without being forced to directly answer.

But, quite famously, any remote level of context reveals that to be a lie.  Yet the opening days of his administration featured Trump and Sean Spicer yammering on about an easily disproven fact of his inauguration.
Trump is, at this point, renowned for keeping blinders on when forming his HOT TAKES.  Take his inauguration, for example.  He sees a decent looking crowd immediately in front of him and declares it the biggest inauguration ever.

That is exactly how most people feel right now. I hated him at first but Trump is not typical government. He is doing things and bringing things up that politicians wouldn‚Äôt dare to do. That‚Äôs why they are so threatened by him.
As soon as Trump talked about it in March it was blocked. They can‚Äôt allow him to be right about anything. He is not one of them and is a threat to all politicians. Not just dems either. Both sides.

They may have to make a decision if Trump ends up in the hospital...‚Ä¶.death committee don't play favorites
Listening to CNN Special Report - they are debunking Trump's conspiracy theories‚Ä¶..
I believe that there's a certain sect of the #StickToSports crowd that actually does want their sports coverage with zero politics.  But they're sharing that space with a lot of people who want to produce puff-pieces on Trump and consume what amounts to Breitbart Sports content.
They aren‚Äôt coming for that reason.  They are only coming because Trump thinks he can scare people into voting for him.  Notice he is only sending them to Democrat run states?!?
I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm going to say this.  There‚Äôs a quote in this article where trump actually seems to make sense. And I agree with the point he makes there.  Okay brb gagging
Well, it was segregationist Southern committee chairs that helped bring all those military bases to the Jim Crow South so why not allow a single Senate chair maintain the stain on these forts ... until GOP tosses away its Senate majority by supporting Trump‚Äôs pet issues.
I'm hesitant to put much weight into these ads, because the context of these statements is even more damning for Trump than any video could be.  But this is good work.
In milwaukee yesterday at around this time a fine black man  store owner, TRUMP supporter was standing in front of his establishment and a peaceful thug walked boldly up to him and executed him. Pray for his family. We will not forget, my brother..
Trump for sure
Must be like a paragraph a week. If Trump loses in November this all goes away.
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez spoke truth to white supremacy silencing Rep. Yoho and the Trump gangster regime.
Rachel: Trump threatens to veto an 86-14 bill in the Senate to fund the military that included removing Confederate generals names to military installations. Trump‚Äôs risks an override. The first of his presidency. And the latest poll of Florida reports Biden‚Äôs 13 point lead &gt; DJT
Remembering that the new  Postmaster General demanded worse service in a recent memo. ( Sounds dumb; but it‚Äôs actively defunding and incapacitating a government agency. (See? The #gop is fine with that when it‚Äôs a gov. group they don‚Äôt like).
Did she hire the Trump wedding planner too!!!!!
He‚Äôll be booed out of the place. A terrible mistake that The Lincoln Project will turn into a devastating anti - Trump ad.
Trump cancels Jacksonville portion of Republican convention planned for August due to COVID-19
This was a preemptive  move. You know the dialogue so far is Trump doesn't  care about people. In his book he does a lot of capitulation, always well thought out and his opponents  are left holding the bag. He knows just how far to go to win. Unlike the dems ,never a rethinküëé
Just Trump and his goon squad
Go to china, north Korea,  Venezuela,  the citizens  get the same treatment from their" imposed government by takeover" Fraud elections. These people don't  want dialogues,  they feel entitled to absolute power.  They say Trump they mean  us. Nov 3, liberation üá∫üá∏
Nick - stop blaming Trump and others trying to restore order. Only bad guys here are these anarchists. When do they have to return to their jobs?  If O sent in troops, he‚Äôd be brilliant in your mind!
He‚Äôs hoping for the zillions of followers, in his warped mind, to rise up and overthrow the rule of law. But the Blue Tsunami is real, not a figment of Trump‚Äôs imagination.
This is now. Trump is President now. And has nothing to do with Biden. You may want to be tested for dysphasic disorders.
Isn‚Äôt that Trump‚Äôs now?
4 years ago,  announced  as her running mate...   proud of all our work on that campaign. #StrongerTogether   I still think about what could have been...  And in November, Trump must go.
Honestly trump has broken America.
Trump has never had to shop for groceries

We Veterans will make sure he vacates the WH....a million man Veteran's March......this Trump realizing he can't hold on to the gravy train
Simply the Trump Gestapo...
IT's all about the money with Johnson as with Trump....Birds of a feather or in this case, traitors of a the American people
Putin maybe god but Trump is Emer Fudd!!!!!!
If by chance Trump wins the November election it is a shame, a rigged election either by delaying absentee ballots or just plain buying votes, the American people should storm the WH and throw Trump into the street on his lard ass
Trump is doing the right thing, putting the right people in to make a difference
Rex, obviously the mayor of Chicago is n#out of bad ideas. Things are getting worse there, what should Trump do, defund the police and let the citizens of that neighborhood handle things??? Young children are dying !!!! Wake up
I think you have a different idea of what masculine is than I do. Trump is not masculine - he's a loud, obnoxious, spoiled brat who never got put in his place. Don't simper to him.
Have you seen the Netflex story of Epstein? Trump was a friend of both of them.
Trump is the first president racist against.... laplanders  and astronauts
Go Trump! Sending reinforcements to Chicago to stop the Mayhem!
Trump's America
Trump has never experienced a callous on his hand in his whole life. He is softer than spring fog.
Hahaha. What a anti-Trump tool.
A. They made a deal on a vaccine that isn't approved an available. B. This plan leaves 260 million Americans with no vacine. C. If Trump has anything to do with it, there is a secret profit involved and it probably is never going to happen. This is a nothing burger.
Now do high-profile critics of Trump who happen to be Main-Stream media hacks and has-been celebrities. Let‚Äôs be fare Twitter. These people spit false information daily based off of little more than their opinion that is slanted due to Trump Derangement Syndrome.Big shout out from Wisconsin! Trump 2020üôãüôãüôã
I love carlin too, recently there's been a bastardization of one of his bits about politics that the left has put over a video of trump, which just goes to show how much they didn't understand or care about what carlin had to say and believed in

I said this to my husband in 2007 as Obama was coming on the scene. He laughed at me. I said it many times from then on and kept my eyes on Trump. He did not prove me wrong! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
If you're not retweeting  when she goes after trump, what are you even doing on here?
I'm a socialist and do not rejoice in the death of anyone including Trump supporters.   If Black Lives Matter that means Herman Cain matters.   We didn't want him to die.  This is why we urge people to wear a mask.
And here is another one of Trump's supporters that just died.   Bill Montgomery.
Wisconsin Republicans break with Trump on election delay
And this is exactly one of the points of his tweet. Trump can be a master twitter troll at times.
Sure but his boss (Obama) started it during his administration so he's as much to blame (if not moreso) for it as Trump.
The dates of federal elections are set by Congress, and the Constitution makes no provisions for a delay to the Jan. 20, 2021 presidential inauguration.
Those of you losing your minds over Trump's question about postponing the fall election are falling for an obvious troll. Have you not learned over the last 4 years what a master Twitter troll he is?
Trump proposes delaying November election
the thing about trump is he‚Äôs a product of a country built on oppression. if he just popped out of the ether, he wouldn‚Äôt be our president. if you‚Äôre silent on injustice, you enable the same shit that got us hate
Another fantastic turn out for Women for Trump Wednesdays!  Wisconsin women are going Vote this November 3rd for President   #LeadRight #OnWisconsin #KAG
Today Trump announced Kodak would be getting $765mil to work on pharmaceuticals..Yesterday, before this news was announced, Trading volume in Kodak stock was 30x its normal and its value is now up 572% after being crap just earlier this week. Nothing to see here folks..
So what?  Trump's revenge?  Not good foreign policy.
Just wait til trump goes after her.
So going on the "hills have eyes people", the movie is about how civilized people become mutant cannibals due to nuclear testing?  Since Trump views his followers this way does he see himself as the nuclear bomb that mutates his followers to do savage things?
"Trump tells voters in suburbs they will ‚Äòno longer be bothered‚Äô by low-income housing"
I really think that people need to read reports from medical journals regarding the efficacy of HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE, before making comments about its use. Donald Trump is not medically trained. He is in real estate development. Trust the science folks. Your creator used science.
I promise I will never have sex with Donald Trump- no matter how nice he is to me, or how much he helps the economy!    Are you brave enough to sign the petition to not have sex with Trump?
A really good reason to vote for Joe Biden ‚Äî even if you know nothing about Joe Biden, even if you‚Äôre not a Biden supporter, is that HES NOT DONALD TRUMP! It‚Äôs truly beyond my comprehension how anyone could support President Trump for another term.
As bad as both candidates are an argument could be made that 4 more years of Trump would be better than 8 years of Biden.  We really need to defeat neoconservatism and neoliberalism as both are two heads on the same dragon.
A good dude I know sent me a conspiracy video today. Turns out Covid was funded by Democrats under Obama. When they failed to impeach Trump, they released it to further their political agenda.  I used to play a lot of D&amp;D with this guy (relevant to story)
I don‚Äôt think Trump is doing this because he is somehow the agent of Putin. I think he wants Europe to spend more on NATO.
In what world is Mattise Thybulle more deserving/better than RJ? Again, this is just anti-Knick for no other reason than being anti-Knick. Bum.
Could Trump be any more pathetic? Nobody likes me, everybody hates me, guess I‚Äôll eat some worms ...
trump is ego in human form
Over twenty doctors were willing to stand up on camera for what they believed in,and because it supports Trump‚Äôs opinion, people try to discredit them. Consider this:Remdesivir- $2300 for 5 day treatment, Hydroxy- $37 for 100 pills.Both may work but follow the money to the truth.
Anyone who gets their health advice from a politivian deserves to get sick.   Now that being said, TRUMP 2020
The victim was sitting in a lawn chair outside his Milwaukee business when he was fatally shot in broad daylight. There is not a known motive for the crime at this point.
Really? B/c I got my refund in 10 days back in early FEB and got my Trump check within 5 days of it's original 1st day of release officially, all electronically and via direct deposit. Early bird gets the worm, you think I didn't know what was going to happen soon in the US?
Really because that looks like one of the areas burned up by rioters, not.... Trump or his supporters... hmmmm.
At this point it looks like the only hope we have is if the Green Party wins.   Both Biden and Trump promise total disaster.
The real question is, long after the Trump trial witch hunt is over and all theories disproven, can we say the name Eric Ciaramella?
Too bad Trump wasn't yelling at people to wear their masks, otherwise liberals would've, opf course, gone the opposite way. They'd be protesting national mask wearing orders in the streets! LOL Liberals would be the anti-maskers!
Funny, all these WEAR YR MASKS ppl and yet anything that Trump says, they do the opposite. Too bad Trump wasn't yelling at people to wear their masks, otherwise all this BS would have never happened.
Blasting F*ck Donald Trump while driving down Main Street felt pretty good
Maybe you could mention something about all the peaceful protesters too..instead of just singing the "rioter" message.  It really would have been/would be nice to see such law and order demanded of Trump and his "AG" Barr.
Oh, and by the way, I do not believe the "majority" of American people agree with you, Barr or Trump.  I hope this myth will be proven incorrect in November.  Deservedly so.
You won't get another chance to vote in a free election if Trump is reelected.  Stop being a child.
No I am not. I want to see her as AG and turn her loose on trump and the rest of his republicans
So ‚Äúspring breakers‚Äù/vacationers were heading to NY in March rather than Florida? What a horrific defense of NY‚Äôs response! Does Trump get to claim that he was ‚Äúcaught off guard‚Äù? We‚Äôll mark this tweet and check back in late August.
Why is the possibility of trump not leaving the White House after the inauguration day even a talking point?   At that point he is no longer president. He is  an intruder. Send  the secret service in to drag his sorry a** out!

So what you're saying is, Big Brother threw it down the memory hole and Trump is Emmanuel Goldstein.
Trump passed a bill capping enormous costs of drugs, a big blow to Big Pharma. Univ. Healthcare doesn't address huge costs, just pays for them and enables them. Jo Jo also has plans to cap high medical costs. Thoughts?
I agree and disagree. Most of these Antifa-types say "liberals get the bullet too", are Bernie-bros, and don't care much for Biden except voting for him will oust Trump. A Biden win may actually cause them to cease since this whole thing is being funded by Soros anyway.
if you still believe that 40% of Americans approve of tRump's performance in office, then I got a bridge I want you to look at..  it's in Brooklyn and I'll sell it to ya cheap  #TrumpResignNow #EndTrumpsWarOnAmerica #EndThePoliceState
right? I mean liberals love to talk about alternative medicine and such but God forbid we talk about something that HAS helped many. Yet, Trump says the sky is blue and liberals are all like NO! I seriously hope Trump takes Pot off of Sched 1 drugs federally and libs all be like
Hey, libtard. It was CumHomo on CNN that made a joke during a daaaaangerous pandemic that Trump said "drink Lysol", if you, an IGNORE-ant libtard, actually watched the video, you'd see Trump asked if there was "some way to perhaps apply a disinfectant for the lungs". 1/2
Once again proving the left can't meme. Trump's not trying to force it, he's trying to merely make it legal to get. You know, like the pot you all want legalized? Love that libtards use a Reagan-era PSA to denounce Trump. Liberals don't get Irony either.

Donald Trump thanks you for your support.  I'm sure he and the GOP with get right on the m4a thing first thing.
How many died b/c the guy whom Fauci PRAISED ( Cumhomo) sent the elderly and at risk from empty hospitals and a mostly empty hospital ship (that Trump sent, so of course, he didn't use it out of SPITE) to nursing home death camps?
Because he is not trump
#IKnewItWasTimeToMove when everyone in #Plattsburgh NY became suddenly political after Trump was elected, even though all those libtards made fun of me for being anti-War in the 2000s. Glad I did. Enjoy your impoverished lockdown! Viva Wisconsin!
Right. It‚Äôs just that after so much time spent telling trump supporters that it doesn‚Äôt matter *why* they voted for him bc he‚Äôs still a rapist and a racist...here I am considering voting for a different one. It just sucks
Cause Trump would win?
If Trump had taken the virus seriously from the start, schools might be able to open safely in the fall. #trumpvirus
‚ÄúTrump is racist, so voting for him makes you racist too.‚Äù I agree, but....how does that not also apply to  voting for Joe Biden??

Brett Favre golfs with President Trump
A new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds Trump‚Äôs approval for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic falling to a new low, with just 32% of Americans supportive of his approach.
Hey, Wisconsin: somebody said this was Football Hero Brett Favre golfing with American Dictator Donald Trump.
True that. And they're still illegal and I doubt Trump will change that. Liberals are all like, "you want legal AKs but not muh aborshunz?!" uhm, nah, I'm fine with never owning an AK.
I think Carlin hated Tipper Gore, creator of the PMRC "Parental Advisory" labels and the "7 words you can't say". Also, are you saying Trump is more than one person? "Nazi DictatorS"&lt;-? Yes, Trump is the 1st Nazi that Israel LOVES.
This the present Trump has already delivered
Zero irony that this fine gentleman is sporting a Trump t-shirt to complete the matching outfit.
In the hours leading up to the declared riot, thousands of people gathered in the city for another night of protests as demonstrations over George Floyd's killing and the presence of federal agents sent by President Donald Trump showed no signs of...
Favre completed the Covid pass to Trump, 1st and 10 days till death.
Trump is getting his race war. FUCK.
I am very curious what you‚Äôll be saying when Trump has left the White House and moved to Scotland a year from now. This idea of Trump is so counter what he actually is.
I feel exactly the same way.  I recently dumped all my Trump loving family from Facebook.
Tiger and Brett are buds with Trump but no big surprise there.  They are scumbags.   But now I'm wondering about Jack Nicklaus.  Does he too have some skeletons in his closet?
#TrumpLiesEverytimeHeSpeaks   JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
The simple, terrible truth is that as COVID continues to burn through the US population it will eventually show a disproportionate effect on Trump supporters simply because of their near universal denial in its existence.
Great picture of the Brett and Trump! I‚Äôm from Wisconsin!
Nikki Haley will be replacing Pence in the next election.  That explains her sucking up to trump so hard.
Everyone knew Favre was a good old boy Republican. It's just that Trump is such a proud white supremacist that is the problem.  Decent Republicans are not supporting the Russian traitor.

Can't go to church but you can get away with mostly any crime.  This is not police reform, this is chaos and anarchy masked under the guise of social justice.  Democrats can enjoy another 4 years of Trump because they've essentially handed him this election on a silver platter.

We're they the ones screeching at Nancy P. to impeach trump?
They don't believe that trump got help from putin?

Yes, I saw the first pitch. I‚Äôm not here for the Dr. Fauci slander. I am confident that once he gets a vacation and away from Trump post COVID-19 he could throw a perfect game.
They were doing their jobs.They had credible evidence the trump campaign was breaking the law. They did what they were required to do. Now you and trumps other lap dogs are spreading falsehoods trying to fan the flames and persuade your ignorant supporter that trump was wronged.
With the shortage there was legitimate concern that people would hoard masks that were insufficient in supply for frontline healthcare workers if they told everyone from the start to wear a mask.  This is why Trump's ignoring the warnings in JANUARY fuct us.
But... a US passport doesn't allow entry to the EU. Trump fucked our nation over so severely we can't leave.
Gov. Evers sent a letter to President Trump after talk of deploying federal agents in Milwaukee.
145000 dead. He's just now encouraging masks. You think he cares?  No. Not at all. If he did there would be no rallies. There would be a cohesive plan to help slow the spread.  The experts, Fauci, would be front and center calling the shots.  Retire old man.  Take trump with you.

Holy emails, did anyone else get like 15 emails from various Trump campaigns last night?!
You can assume the statement "Bernie would have lost to Trump" is true - it's no argument against Ms. Newsome's premises: 1- the DNC establishment treated its left wing as a threat, 2- doing so did damage to the party and the country. I voted Hillary. Ms. Newsome's not wrong.

"Trump announces 'surge' of federal law enforcement to Chicago"
Chuck Todd and his guests are pontificating on what trump lied MOST about today. üôÑ
Obviously, Biden's statement was incorrect. But did you notice the trap? Trumpers can't say other presidents were more racist than Trump, because then they'd have to discuss racism and specify what is and isn't racist, and that just won't end well for them.
Well, no. But am I still gonna vote for the guy who said it? Of course.  Also, notice the trap? Trumpers can't say other presidents were more racist than Trump, because then they'd have to discuss racism and specify what is racist and that won't end well for them.
In my opinion Donald Trump is saying right now in his press briefing that we're going to see "very impressive numbers" coming up for Covid-19. Do you know why?..because he's now routing case numbers through HHS instead of the CDC so they can manipulate the data. That's my theory!
You're voting for Trump?
Do you think trump knows he's not allowed to profit from the office by trying to get the British open moved to his golf course or do you think he believes it's fine?  Does he not care or is he just so corrupt that he doesn't even know it's wrong?
Unironically is what gave it some sort of backing for me at the beginning due to the backing for Trump.  I believe God is working within this community to unite the world in his Righteousness, Love and Grace.  There is no such thing as coincidence within my frame of reference.

Do You Hate Trump
We keep saying Trump plays checkers while Putin plays chess. It seems the same is true of Democrats. Putin is outsmarting them also. They need to wise up and plan for every contingency. Trump just pushes buttons. Putin tells him which to push.
Who would vote for you‚ùì  You are a mini-Trump.  You bring NO original ideas, you just reverb Trump.  We don't need more hate.  We need someone who wants to be better.  You CLEARLY don't.
YES, IT WOULD BE ALMOST AS BAD AS IF TRUMP GOT IT, GRADUALLY STARTING GETTING SICK, BECAME REALLY REALLY SICK, GOT PLACED ON A VENTILATOR AND DIED.
Trump just said Russia Russia Russia. What is he Jan Brady. Marcia Marcia Marcia.

There are safety laws in place to prevent snake oil peddlers for a reason. Real doctors aren‚Äôt saying it safe. Just drug peddlers trying to please Trump and his sycophants.
Trump wanted to be accepted by Democrats for decades. He donated money repeatedly but they always kept him at arms length. Trump flipped GOP when he realized he could use grievance as a way into politics. GOP is going to find out why Dems always shunned him soon. Very soon.
Can you provide a source for your statement that Trump's "buddies have bought up massive amounts of the drug [hydroxychloroquine] and now they need to sell it."? It's plausible but I need more info. I looked it up and can't find anything credible.
Play Trump games, win Trump prizes. I heard that somewhere.
When Barr said he‚Äôs a member of the Cabinet and there were discussions in Cabinet meetings about campaign, why didn‚Äôt someone on the committee tell him that it is ILLEGAL to strategize about Trump‚Äôs campaign in a Cabinet meeting.
loves these photos. He can put on his Trump glory board
Yea it‚Äôs called insider trading. Trump tells all his goons to load up on Kodak stock before it goes nuts. Then the peanuts they put into it, jumps 500% and they profit off of it.   Same thing Martha Stewart went to prison for.
Play Trump games, win Trump prizes.
Sounds like a headline from the National Enquirer. Then again, the owner is a friend of Trump.

This is tRump's america.
Right so we can‚Äôt play politics about it. So we can‚Äôt say well Clinton did this, bush did that, Obama did xyz, so it‚Äôs ok that trump does whatever. Two wrongs don‚Äôt make a right. And that‚Äôs the issue that we‚Äôre seeing.
Saw a truck with an ‚ÄòAll rifles matter‚Äô side by side with a Trump/Pence bumper sticker.   I wonder if his sister/mother bought them for him.

Thank you.
2/2 then when authorities used excessive force on peaceful protesters, it‚Äôs created anger provoking more problems. Though it‚Äôs come out that many of the violent crimes have been committed by trump supporters trying to provoke more violence
Trump is the whiniest President ever. Every other statement is how he is being treated unfairly. Everyone picks on him and never gives him credit.   ‚ÄúAsk not what your country can do for you, ask why the country treats me so badly.‚Äù
This scares me because Trump and his goons are actively trying to destroy USPS with political appointees. How many of those Dem ballots won't "make it in time"?
Senate Republicans are compromised like Trump. If November comes, it won‚Äôt be about votes. It will about a criminal organization making political arrests and creating chaos in the streets. Hate to think negative but reality is a B.

I'm telling you tRump definitely sent virus to chinAH bc they weren't playing nice w/him on trade deal. Y else would he blame everyone else. He makes up his bs &amp; blames it on fake news. Either he is incredibly stupid or he thinks we are! I can't stand it anymore! #ASSholeLoser

I voted for Bernie in my primary. I‚Äôm for Medicare for All. But I‚Äôm a realist, and if we want to throw trump out, we have to build the collation of all of us (including real republicans). And I think Pete is an amazing person and will be successful in politics in the future
What did the polls say in 2016? People believed them, democrats took the foot off the gas pedal.... And Trump won. We can't afford to take the foot off the gas pedal this time.
They are calling attention to blm, not disrespecting the anthem, flag or country. It's a peaceful protest. It's what this country is supposed to based on. Not just the 2nd amendment as tRump blasted during his campaign. There are how many amendments? Who are they for? Only GOPs?
Trump has over 30 women with evidence that he sexually assaulted them. Including the sworn testimony of a 13 year old girl. And four other children between 9-13. All of the women and girls he assaulted all said that trump chose them because they looked like Ivanka. Projection
Does anyone know if tRump went to that one?
Anything positive by Trump would be insincere.  Let‚Äôs remember this disrespect in November!
I had the utmost respect for John McCain when he publicly said he did not want tRump at his funeral. Mr. Lewis "boycotted" tRump's inauguration so either tRump is retaliating like a big baby or Mr. Lewis stated he didn't want him there. Love and peace to the Lewis family.
The lightbulb is slowly coming on that no matter how much the left screams about ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs stormtroopers‚Äù on Twitter that maybe, just maybe, people seeing the violence isn‚Äôt going well for the left.
Bunch of BS to blame Trump.  These were riots way before Trump and Barr sent in Federal officers.  Stop your lying.  The Left is full of hate and now we see it first hand in these cities.

I guarantee Trump will make sure it gets ugly, riots, more broken windows ect. He realizes he‚Äôs losing BIG time. There‚Äôs no one to take care of him. Watch a lot of Republicans will start to bail on him, they want to keep their jobs. Their fucked up.
I had a friend of 40 years with whom I parted ways. He's a business owner and a former teacher and still a trump supporter, and gay. I told him he was denying himself. He refuses to deny trump. I had to say goodbye.

Trump admin knew about COVID in Nov. Could have took lead/told states to start beefing up systems as this was inevitable. Instead downplayed it, dropped a nuke, and told states to figure it out. UI offices had 30 employees when it hit here. Don't blame Gov for feds ass dragging
In Trump's own words, referring to women, "When you're a celebrity, they let you do whatever you want". Is that what Trump's friend, Jeffrey Epstein told him? Were all of these women, Trump speaks of, over the age of 18? It's illegal, even with consent, if they're under 18.
And if Joe Biden wins on Nov 3, trump must be removed on Nov 4, because we won't make it to January 21, 2021 if he's allowed to stay in our house until then.

Trump Suggests Unprecedented Delay to November Election
The fact is the only real compelling argument *for* trump is to compare him to alternatives.   When mainstream media drops all pretense of professionalism/ integrity (as Kessler is doing here), he is lending credence to trumpism.
at q here isn‚Äôt whether trump is best person to be president, at q is facts &amp; context around the bounty story. Powell who is openly opposed to Trump politically (not interested in supporting him) is simply telling the truth. Kessler is deceiving.

Mitch is desperate to win just like Trump. This is all about politics. People are dying and you did nothing.  Where was your voice in March? #VoteLikeYourLifeDependsOnIt

Trump should do a mock debate and give his real answers to questions and act out the fake Joe Biden answers.
Friend of mine had a decent drive up through Michigan the other day - said Trump signs everywhere! Nothing for Biden.  Even here in Wisconsin, no Biden signs yet. ü§∑
Trump just showing his racist self.
The biggest problem with this Government is that for every person trying to fix it, there are two people actively trying to burn it all down. We need change this November and Trump and the Republicans are actively trying to prevent it. #NoMoreTrump

True story: One of my volunteers in Wisconsin spoke to a nurse yesterday who is a former Republican and says she is voting for Biden because of Trump's handling of COVID-19. Thinking of her while reading this

Trump will go down and just like other events... people who supported him will not admit it in 2 years... It takes a big person to admit they were wrong or they need help. You can see into a person's heart.
Name one by trump and if we are comparing... Biden wins minute by minute. Grow up
While millions are being kicked out of their homes, cannot feed their families, pay their bills, lost their jobs, Melanie Trump reminds us that we can all eat cake. #MelanieAntoinette
I hope it is not true however,  I have felt that Blackwater is now Trumps army. Follow the money to see where it leads you. Someone's bank account is expanding. Trump saying he is going into Milwaukee will include the DNC dates. Timing is everything.
Another female takes Trump down.  Appropriate.
This didn't age well as they say. Yes, trump and his admin handled this terribly. Could he have stopped it? No, probably not, but if handled seriously, his magats would have worn masks.
Educate yourself about Narcissistic personality disorder and you'll find trump. You must be living under a rock if you don't see the division in our country.
Disinformation kills. Enablers like Steil enable.  Trump doesn‚Äôt care about dead Americans. Nor does he care about dead Republicans. SAD!  #TrumpGenocide 146,000 dead and counting. #MAGA2020 #KAG2020
I've said it before and I'll say it again, FUCK donald trump.
‚Å¶ here it is: Trump ad falsely suggests Biden supports defunding police - The Washington Post
this is an extremely bizarre argument, your claim is that "if a conservative leaning (or trump supporting) celebrity propagates antisemitism nobody proposes the idea that their actions are endemic to their entire community".  are you seriously that bubble-wrapped?
business model is plainly far more dependent on profiting from hate than  is. but you aren't going after  bc its not hate speech your are concerned about: you + partners are trying to jack an election. shame!

Yeah, but it isn‚Äôt about having him lead the country, it is merely about not having Trump in the WH. Biden would just be a warm body occasionally mumbling into the camera while people behind the scene pull the strings. A lot of ppl are willing to risk that.
Interesting demographic breakdown. Looking good for Trump if the trend is right!
"stop burning down cities and murdering black one year olds to own trump" hashtag my man.    whatever works i guess [shrug]
this argument is so bizarre: yes. indeed.  if only the protests were actually non-violent that would totally wreck trump's argument that the protests are violent. i'm completely confused about who is owning who in this scenario...
Lost the 2016 election by rigging the primary for Hillary, which allowed Trump to help minority communities
Haha no, Obama, FDR, LBJ and Woodrow Wilson are in running for worst president ever. Washington, Lincoln, Raegan and Trump would be leaders in competition for best president ever
I‚Äôd crawl over hot coals to vote Trump 2020, even though I didn‚Äôt vote 2016
The left have ALWAYS been fractured, it's not a new thing really rebellion to damn near everything is kind of in our blood, but it's a huge weakness that lead to Trump winning in 2016 and could let him win again if we don't just suck it up and vote.
I saw that yesterday Trump 2020
Bet you won‚Äôt beat Trump
4. Finally, just because president trump hasn't been allowed to censor his political opponents, because of our delicate checks and balances, doesn't mean he hasn't TRIED and is still trying to.
Just because Trump hasn't been ALLOWED to go full on fascist doesn't mean he hasn't exhibited all the warning signs.
Trump has zero regard for the first amendment rights to free speech in this country and if it wasn't for a complicated set of checks and balances he'd most certainly do away with them.
Yeah, they are all closet Trump voters.
So I don‚Äôt disagree with what he says, but trump is still a disgusting excuse for a human being. Third party is the only way I vote now, I just cannot sacrifice my morals for this corporation pleasing bs from both sides.
Trump was buddies with Epstein just like the clintons. He‚Äôs Part of the problem
Completely unrelated but also trump admin policies have made those vulnerable to trafficking even more vulnerable. Victims of trafficking are usually low income, minorities, immigrants, sex workers, trans. How has trump helped any of them
Why do you think other countries are able to reopen sports arenas while we‚Äôre watching cardboard cutout filled stadiums? Trump botched this and it‚Äôs ppl who polticize wearing a mask that will keep us locked up for another year. If ppl took it seriously we‚Äôd be back to normal soon
Democrats are in government wherever big cities are because when more people are voting, Democrats tend to win. The reason democrats control the bulk of corona cases is because corona outbreaks happen in cities. Trump downplayed and still does downplay this corona. He owns it
It‚Äôs probably more often than that.  Putin gives trump his marching orders on how to sow chaos in order to destroy the US.  Trump, useful idiot that he is, is more than happy to comply.
Looks like the Committee to Reelect Trump because you can bet that these images will find their way into his campaign ads.
You‚Äôre pissed because you know I‚Äôm right.  Throw false lablels around, I don‚Äôt care.  It speaks more about you than it does me.  Just another snowflake who can‚Äôt handle being challenged.  If Trump gets four more years, you get the blame this time.
He‚Äôs 100% right on this one and ya‚Äôll are falling into the same trap once again.  Trump‚Äôs bungling of COVID-19 made him very beatable, but it is getting screwed up again for the same reasons Jonathan Pie mentioned in the video from 2016.
Oh good night!  I support the concept of Black Lives Matter, but not the whole agenda of  .  However, any resistance, any questioning, any challenging is met with accusations of hate and bigotry.  This is why fascist Trump won in 2016 and may win again.
You only tweeted this because your retweet includes the words Trump supporter.
What are you talking about? Anti-semite just because George Soros is one of many from various backgrounds that are part of Democracy Alliance? This is more  garbage of making everything about hate and bigotry.  That crap is why fascist Trump was able to win
It matter as Trump destroys the constitution!  Protests are legal!  What we see the Feds doing now isn‚Äôt legal!

Fact is he was a denier. Never wore a mask, never bekeueved in it. Lived his disly life as if it were fake. Was probably exposed long before the rally. But of all things he does, they link to Trump. It's politicizing his death, and u know it bro
Nah, you know damn well the media 100% wants to tie it to Trump. Yes I get the irony in that the virus killed him, after he thought it was a hoax all along. MSNBC covered of a 5 minute video... Took them 24 seconds to say "after a Trump rally".
Your comment on Trump's tweet about postponing the election?
How do we get this across to trump‚Äôs base? How can they be so blind?
Trump bc he is funny. Not Biden because the demented funny will abruptly cease, he'll be out, and his VP will just take over, then who knows whats funny. If Biden remained like he is for all 4 years? Biden wins funny hands down lol
Trump is sooooo envious he can‚Äôt help but to try to stonewall the public from hearing from those he is jealous of.
Can you just make trump disappear?
These elected officials need to be held legally responsible for their actions and maybe if lawsuits against them personally start happening they will think twice about their idiotic decisions that impact people so desperately. Trump was right,the Problem can be worse than virus.

Well I guess we now know what he and Putin talked about on the phone last week. I‚Äôm no rocket scientist, but idt it takes 1 to figure this out!! How much $ &amp; years is it going to take 2 fix all the stupid malicious shit Trump has done to our country??!!

The separation of powers is the only thing stopping the current administration from making damaging, wholesale changes to our electoral system solely because they believe it benefits them. 1/5
So Trump's rally literally killed someone.   Wear your fucking mask!
Can you please let Trump know that it's perfectly acceptable to not think for himself and question authority? Thanks!
BS! Trump is hoping, praying for an economic turn around.  It ain‚Äôt gonna happen!
Okay, I'm not very political but damn, I'm tired of going on anything &amp; seeing Trump tryin' to do whatever he wants. It's like when a child learns something &amp; immediately tries to find a way around it. It's cute at first, but after a while it's frustrating.
Today is the day Donald Trump became president... forever.
You are not independent nor a moderate  you are a member of the Trump cult enabling him at every step for 3 1/2 years  you voted with him on all his judges and justices and voted to keep him in office even though he's a corrupt criminal following Putin's orders
Trump is following more of Putin's orders  not wearing masks is another way to destroy this country  making it political dividing us creating chaos is right in Putin's wheelhouse  he loves Trump killing our institutions now killing our people and kids  he'll get a Russian medal
I see you on Morning Joe or Nicole Wallace talking about Covid 19  haven't you figured out that Trump is destroying this country  first he killed all our institutions now he's killing our people and with schools he wants to kill our kids  he's following Putin's orders

So you're saying that if the GOP gets rid of the symptoms then you're still totally down to vote for the disease?  Everything the GOP has done over the last 30 years is why we have Trump. He's not an anomaly, he *is* the GOP.
Trump killed him. Say it right.
I've voted Republican many times in the past. The continued stupidity of the modern Republican party has guaranteed I will not be doing so in the future.  (No, I did not vote for Trump).
That‚Äôs right I guess that‚Äôs why the republican senate all day long that it‚Äôs not the president call it it‚Äôs  up to the congress live and learn you sound like no nothing trump

Yeah, not so much. If people are getting sick it's because they are not doing what they are supposed to be doing, or their family members are not.  The virus is spread through unprotected contact, period. And I don't give a fuck what the pathological liar Trump says.
I scrolled through the  tweets today and not once did they rebuke Trump's suggestion that we delay the election. The GOP will be complicit in the complete destruction of our democracy.
I think I can assure many people that Trump is deranged.  So the answer to his question is yes.
The world sees you with your ass out,  a la Emperor's New Clothes style.    You've been laying the groundwork to contest an election you know you're going to lose for months.    Upset your plan to let the trump virus go unchecked &amp; sicken &amp; kill millions won't make you win?
I think that's most of it. They know RBG isn't going anywhere before January. They know Trump is headed for a landslide defeat. So now they're trying to save face and be remembered as one of the "reasonable Republicans" in the post Trump era.

Nope.   People like me, and believe me there are millions and millions, know his game. It's so old, people recognize it, and his poll numbers show it.  We are not stupid even though Trump wants to believe we are.

Trump Attacks an Election He Is at Risk of Losing
When Trump loses on November 3rd, and he will, there will not be a "transition." There will be a mad dash to burn all the evidence of their corruption and criminality. Smoke will waft from the White House like a Chinese consulate ordered to close.
The idea is 2 lower transmission rates so that R falls bellow 1 Even if a mask isnt foolproof it can still have enough of an effect to stop a pandemic. Trump could have asked small buisness owners to step up and innovate in terms of mask design. We could have a whole new industry
That‚Äôs because Trump fanned the flames with his stormtroopers so his maga will get their minds off of the failure of the virus

If Trump wasn‚Äôt so dangerous he‚Äôd be pitiful. He knows he‚Äôs losing and he knows he can only keep power is to steal it. Hopefully if Trump and Barr get too dangerous the other half of our Government with any help necessary can keep these crooks from stealing America!
In his sleep, Biden can do more good than Trump at his best. At the very worst, Biden would do far less damage. You need to think about the scale of the destruction Trump has caused by his incompetence.

Despite US law, Trump raises specter of delaying election
It‚Äôs like he forgets that Wisconsin was under a lockdown during the April election, and the reasoning for the delay was for safety.  Trump‚Äôs reasoning is he‚Äôs against mail in ballots, because he has repeatedly said it‚Äôll harm republican chances in elections.  Hypocritical? Yeah.

Is it also hypocritical then if you support Trump's request after frantically pushing to repeal Ever's attempt to postpone the April election?

Herman Cain died because he felt it was important to travel to Mobster Trump's Nuremburg Rally.  "The Party of Personal Responsibility"
He made a personal choice to travel to Mobster Trump's Nuremburg Rally.  He made a personal choice not to wear a mask. "Personal Responsibility."
It's Groundhog Day IRL. What Trump does. How it makes people feel. Opinions fly, like nobody's seen him do this 1,000x before but this time the reaction to it is *fascinating* and totally original.
OOOooooops. Sad. Just said you listened to all the garbage that is endemic to the Right-Wing.  No one to blame but yourself.  "Personal Responsibility."  Shouldn't have went to Tulsa for Mobster Trump's Nuremburg rally. Should have worn a mask.
Trump demands for schools to open next month, but wants the election in November postponed? Does THAT make any sense?
Let me qualify that though, I would help any Trump supporter if they were struggling with groceries or a case of water or anything.   Again because we‚Äôre us, not them.
"I‚Äôd like to see it be very high because I love the people. I want the people to get it, you know. The economy is going to come back."  It's fun hearing Trump talk about socialism like that.

How much does it cost the trump campaign to fill in the blanks...  "_______ for Trump"?!?!  I can't lie tho, I seen "cops for trump" coming... As well as David Duke for trump, etc... #Trump
Trump is lawless. No doubt. Even if he loses and does leave, the rest of 2020 is shaping up to be some kind of nightmare.

The stock market has regained most of its losses, but it also has no bearing on the daily lives of 95% of Americans. This morning, Trump finally realized there's not enough time left to fix this. Right now is when voter's opinions on the health of the economy get locked in. 3/
Last time I'm saying this.  No, Trump's tweet about delaying the wlection is not a distraction from the GRP numbers. It's a direct reaction. It's a trial ballon, just like deploying federal troops to Portland and Seattle. He's testing the fences of his cage to find a way out. 1/
Think I am exaggerating? Trump discusses postponing election - Trump (duh). Herman Cain dies of Covid 19 - Trump rally. Economy shrinks by historic proportions - Trump‚Äôs ineptitude at pandemic. Police state fascism in US cities - Trump‚Äôs homeland security. One. fucking. Person.
Obstruction and private trump-Putin conversations is what we have. Not to mention an AG who isn‚Äôt sure if foreign interference is illegal.
Everything sucks. Trump's latest insane tweets, Herman Cain dying as a direct consequence from that Tulsa rally, and the usual ghouls high fiving over his death. It's all so tiresome.
America is a ‚Äúdisaster‚Äù because you‚Äôre a failure. You hid, downplayed, said it will just go away, underfunded, on &amp; on. G.D.P and unemployment are off the chart. Listening to Clinton, Bush, Pelosi, Obama at J. Lewis funeral. Americans, Trump‚Äôs behavior is NOT ok. #VoteBlue2020
My twitter timeline is nothing but dread and doom today. And it all can be attributed down the one thing - The utter ineptitude and corruption of the Trump presidency. Every single thing can be pointed back at him. One person. Elections matter, people. Life and death now.
Maybe he shouldn't have gone to that MAGA/Klan/death rally without a mask and social distancing. Maybe you all should have stopped pretending it was the flu that would go away? Trump and his cult have this and 150k other deaths on their hands, as do you, Lesser Ivanka. #ETTD

Trump's tweet does not take issue with mail-in absentee voting that is taking place in Wisconsin and many other states. It singles out states that "universal" mail-in voting, of which three existed in 2016 and a fourth added this year.
No, I did not. Because: (1) unlike the Right-Wing I practice critical thinking skills; (2) a Trump victory was actually within the margin of error by election night; (3) Clinton did actually win the popular vote; (4) The entire discipline of polling isn't obviated by 1 outlier;

Joe Biden and Obama were the ones who started locking children up and cages and separating them from their parents. Trump is just following a continuation of Joe Biden's and Obama's policies. Look at Obama's, Bush's, Biden's and Trump's, policies there's not much difference.

Even tho I do not see tRump as a real republican, the GOP friends I still had are  no longer...they all drank the koolaid. I'm a more moderate liberal, so I could always get along with sane GOPers.  Those (sane GOPers) people have left the republican party.
Herman Cain, who attended Trump's Tulsa rally and at one time denied the pandemic and was an anti-masker, has died from COVID-19. Take the pandemic seriously. Social distance and wear your masks.
It‚Äôs truly refreshing to see and hear former Presidents today. Even Bush is infinitely more classy - and eloquent! - than Trump can even imagine.  Imagine that - a President that acts presidential!  Hopefully, on Jan 20, a new POTUS will, once again, restore dignity to the office

Absolutely! But Trump should‚Äôve banned all travels and not just China since cases were soaring in every other country. He was pressured into putting travel bans on other countries. To tackle a problem, you can just take one step and expect things to be okay
You're absolutely right. But it is frustrating for readers and viewers to see: it took a month til JSwan asked Trump about bounties; nobody asks how Trump and senior WH avoid Covid19, sans masks(hint: plasma)- lots of questions we'd ask in your shoes
I know you're working in an insane news environment, with a capricious President. It is frustrating for viewers and readers to see that reporters are not asking certain questions. Jonathan Swan was 1st to ask about Russian bounties. No one has asked how Trump avoids Covid 19.
Nancy is so out of touch that she does not realize that working Americans and Middle class ARE Republicans and the TRUMP SUPPORTERS!

11/ So the question you should ask is -- where's Donald Trump's facts about his meme of vote-by-mail fraud? Not his rhetoric -- HIS FACTS?
7/ Disparaging vote-by-mail is just the latest tactic in Trump's history of false voter fraud talk. And like in his past, this meme -- based on a falsehood -- simply gives a boogyman for his supporters to target and it keeps the long-discredited voter fraud meme alive.
6/ Donald Trump has a history of using this tactic to disparage American elections and target otherwise legal voters for disenfranchisement. I've written about this here:

Herman Cain may be alive today had he 1) worn a mask rather than mock them, 2) avoided Trump's ill-advised Tulsa rally held contrary to CDC guidance.  Cain is now the poster child for the  politicization of the pandemic &amp; sensible actions.  You need not be next! Be safe!

But Trump is? The man who couldn‚Äôt even take a sip of water or walk down a ramp? He‚Äôs a dictator and he welcomes fraud if he thinks it‚Äôll benefit him. Just like he was completely fine with Russia meddling in the 2016 election and spoke to Putin last week and failed to mention it
While it is unclear where Cain contracted the disease, he was among several thousand people who attended a Trump rally in Tulsa on June 20, most of whom did not wear masks. Cain, who co-chaired Black Voices for Trump, was pictured maskless &amp; not socially distancing at the event.

So your telling me you don't see the HATE Trump Is Putting Out? You Really Don't See It? And you really don't SEE WHY JL Encouraged That Boycott?

Herman Cain, last seen maskless in Tulsa, OK at Trump's Covid-19 super spreader event, has died of the virus. Lost his life for a photo OP at a white supremacy rally.

Trump: We need to "Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???" Also Trump: COVID-19 is not a threat, we have it under control. Open everything up. Send all kids and teachers back to school. You will only die if you go vote.
LOL this is the dumbest video I have ever seen. It‚Äôs so funny that for YEARS, vote by mail has only had 14 fraudulent cases out of 15M and now all of a sudden, there‚Äôs more in one video than in the hundreds of years. Don‚Äôt use Trump for research.

Trump has ‚Äúrepeatedly made false and misleading claims about the reliability of the mail balloting and suggested broad conspiracy theories. Critics warn that he could be laying the groundwork for contesting the results.‚Äù
That‚Äôs what you get for trusting Trump. Everything he touches dies.
‚ÄúUnder the US constitution, Mr Trump does not have the authority to postpone the election himself. Any delay would have to be approved by Congress.‚Äù
Go here üëá  and remind Trump that the people decide the election not him!

Trump has been rallying for months. Every time he‚Äôs supposed to brief the country on whats going on, he turns it into a Rally instead. Every time. Not only that, everything that comes out of his mouth at these rallies are lies....all lies.
The date of the general election is set by federal law and has been fixed since 1845. It would take a change in federal law to move that date. That would mean legislation enacted by Congress, signed by the president and subject to challenge in the courts.
Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so - CNNPolitics This Proves It: #TrumpMustGo His lies, false narratives &amp; overall lack of stability threatens this a Nation &amp; The World
Both he and Pence are out if there's no agreement on the election outcome. The presidency then falls to Speaker Pelosi until it's sorted out. The last question is will Trump's base launch a civil war to keep him in power?  I believe we saw the answer in Tulsa, and it is "No." 6/6
Will it work? Well, there have certainly been enough GOP governors willing to kill their own citizens by the thousands to please Trump, so I don't put this past them, either. But regardless of this plan, Trump ceases to be President on Jan 20th. 5/
...and some (probably not all) red states delaying or canceling their elections until Trump says it's "safe."  So what you wind up with is an election on 11/3 where Trump gets absolutely decimated. Just utterly destroyed, because his biggest areas of support never even vote. 3/
Just as he couldn't order individual state governments to reopen their economies during the covid shutdowns, Trump would have to rely on sympathetic governors to do his bidding for him.  This would result in a patchwork, with blue states holding their elections on Nov 3rd... 2/
An important point about "delaying the election."  America doesn't have an election on the first Tuesday of November. America has 51 little ones. Each state plus DC runs their own election. Trump cannot order them to delay or cancel their elections individually. 1/
Why is Trump moving the federal agents that was in Portland here to Milwaukee üòê

See I thought that too but Trump is moving in on a dictator's role so quickly and the COVID response has been so abhorrent, I am not certain there will be a country left to reclaim here. Not to mention, change from within is a fool's errand. The Democratic Party is a lost cause.
No, stupid. They‚Äôre accurately pointing out that Trump &amp; his Republican enablers (you‚Äôre one, hon, so I understand your deflection) pushed to open up the country too early ‚Äî so now we not only have an economy in the toilet we ALSO have an out-of-control virus &amp; a bleak future.
You: but Trump can't do that! Trump:
No other president except Trump seemed to have an issue with Fauci and we never have been in such dire straits except under Trump either. I‚Äôm thinking Fauci isn‚Äôt the problem here.
Last month, Trump told supporters in Arizona that ‚ÄúThis will be, in my opinion, the most corrupt election in the history of our country."
Many of the president's claims about voting by mail are not accurate.  Trump also does not have the power himself to move the date of the election, which was set by an 1845 federal law placing it the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November.

I think Trump's suggestion is wise, but, you might recall everyone who was clamoring to postpone our spring elections (and elections around the country) in March/April/May. So there's precedent, especially during a pandemic which clearly isn't ending anytime soon and is worse now

Yes, there it is. The Presidential line of succession runs from Pres, to VP, to Speak of the House, and THEN president por tempore of the Senate.  Trump and Pence cease to be pres and vp on Jan 20th. That leaves House Speaker next in line, which will be Pelosi.

Since there has never been an inaccurate or fraudulent national election, what‚Äôs the basis for this claim‚Äîthere is none. Trump knows he will get demolished in this election and will do anything to stay in power. Any GOP member not renouncing this immediately is complicit.
Today would be a good day for Republicans to meet with Trump and encourage him to resign.

The only catastrophic disaster is the goon you put in as Postmaster General. You're purposely having him slow mail delivery times to try to muck up mail in ballots this November. Everything Trump touches turns to shit. You're the biggest loser ever.
So, is it safe to assume that you believe Trump is more trustworthy than Dr Fauci?
The endgame has always been to hurt Trump politically.   Hence the lockdowns while allowing the riots. The constant shifting of the goalposts. The lying about Cuomo in NY and DeSantis in FL.  If people have to die so Trump can‚Äôt say HCQ works, they‚Äôll do it.

I spoke with my postman.  He said the only way things could be corrupted would be with this guys help.  Remembering, the fake ballots only need to go to strategically placed locations sufficient to help Trump secure the electoral college.  So when Trump's crying fraud via mail in
How many of you have been grabbed by the p???y by trump
Do You Hate Trump
PARTICIPATES in normalizing GOP Fascists LIES on a daily basis (ie: treats Trump as if he hasn't been caught lying many times and/or compartmentalizes criminality/cover-ups), then PONDERS why Americans don't know what to believe! This is #Corporatism
Focus. If we don‚Äôt get Trump out this year, we‚Äôll be trying to get rid of one of the TrumpKKKlan kids out in 24.
Uhhhhhh.......what "court" allegedly tossed this out? üòÇü§£üòÇü§£  Trump was impeached. And that's FOREVER.
Yesssss but then ask them if they know how many trump supporters just walked past them.
Is there someway to get rid of trump before January. If we don‚Äôt we will not have an America he will turn it over to Russia then the world
There‚Äôs obviously nothing wrong with a good solid graphic design degree from Trump University.
No he will always put trump first, just ask US service members with bounties on their heads.
How are those federal officers fairing in WA and OR?  Oh right, they tucked tail and ran already. Announced today.  Trump tested the fence and retreated.
Thank God for President Donald Trump.  If the teacher's can't work, funds should go to the parents. AMEM.
During the Chris Wallace interview, President Trump said he would have the new health care plan "in two weeks"... very excited... Will this come out tomorrow or Friday?
trump and his anti American ilk are destroying America and our economy.  Had they used Obama‚Äôs plan for pandemics we‚Äôd all be getting back to normal.  Now there are bo jobs and we need to extend UE.  This is what lack f leadership does!
We keep saying Trump plays checkers while Putin plays chess. It seems the same is true of Democrats. Putin is outsmarting them also. They need to wise up and plan for every contingency. Trump just pushes buttons. Putin tells him which to push.
Donald Trump's secret police in Portland &amp; other US cities getting you down? Let Coppy The Cop Car cheer you up!
That's the environment Clinton ran under.  And she still won.  She is the rightful President. Period.  Now, run the scenario again. No incumbent fatigue. No misogyny. Trump has killed 150,000 people.  We're not talking about WI, MI, or PA.  We're talking about NC, GA, and TX.
Holy....shit....Trump is a traitor.  Full stop.
I purposely raised my kids in a diverse suburban neighborhood. So happy I did... the dream of our family is that soon we will no longer be bothered by the trump crime family.
This doesn‚Äôt bother me in the least... Trump‚Äôs vacation bills and now his troop deployments making Europe and NATO less safe are far more expensive and far more wasteful.  These science experiments actually create wealth.
Who would vote for you‚ùì  You are a mini-Trump.  You bring NO original ideas, you just reverb Trump.  We don't need more hate.  We need someone who wants to be better.  You CLEARLY don't.
Donald Trump has taxpayer funded healthcare. I should be able to as well.
And which one could actually find Jerusalem in a map? Here‚Äôs a hint. It‚Äôs not the one thought Belgium was a city - Donald Trump...I mean you can if you're Trump saying it to his idiot followers
Bill Montgomery has also died, helped found Charlie Kirk‚Äôs group for Trump. See Below They deleted the anti-mask one Tuesday after Bill picked Casket, feel free to use....   #MaskItOrCasket
Trump supporters can return to their ancestral home of Nazi Germany any time they want.  I'll let you use my time machine.
Federalist Society co-founder calls Trump's tweet about delaying election "fascistic"
Isn‚Äôt trump the one saying that the virus is under control and that it‚Äôs perfectly safe to send students and faculty back to school in under a month, yet now we need to postpone the election until it‚Äôs safe to go out and vote?
I wonder how many people responding to this tweet in defense of trump would do a 180 on this if a Democrat were in office and everything else was equal.
Of course he is serious, he is also very good at distractions - he has used this tactic his entire term. He has no power to delay the election, that falls on Congress.  GOP congresspersons, even McConnell, are already breaking with Trump on this. It's not going to happen.
Trump supporters are a cult and you can‚Äôt convince me otherwise
Is he making this statement to deflect headlines away from that tRump killed Herman Cain at his Tulsa rally?
Trump is a dictator and Biden is a Communist. Thanks America!
I hope you're right, Michael. However, all US Federal Gov. norms, rules and laws have meant nothing for 3.5 years while Trump is in office. Up is down, right is left, night is day. We are in a serious situation. That's why we need great candidates like you. You have my vote.
Usually I like to not mention Trump or give him the time of day, but I'm seeing a lot of people concerned about delaying the election. It has never happened and it never will, not even a civil war delayed the election.  It's just a distraction from the disasterous Q2 GDP numbers.
Unlike the examples I can think of,Trump hasn‚Äôt directly attacked the COTUS. He‚Äôs only insulted it. No judge/justice has the authority to rewrite the 20th amendment. What you propose isn‚Äôt possible. Trump is a crazy mess, not omnipotent.
Herman Cain went to a Trump Rally without a mask...Herman Cain got Covid-19....Herman Cain will not vote in 2020. Wear a mask and you then you will be able to vote. #WearADamnMask
Good ? No elections at all, Congress can‚Äôt meet, etc., then President Pro Tempore of the Senate becomes POTUS. Trump/Pence leave on 1/20/21 at noon, regardless.  Martial law of no help 1) legally Congress must first declare national, (never has happened)  2) COTUS not affected
If trump hadn‚Äôt held his Oklahoma rally.......
This is automatic, Congress either  1) agrees to a delay/postponement-which makes Pelosi POTUS in January  2) doesn‚Äôt, Trump interferes no election- Pelosi is POTUS in January Martial law? Nope a power of Congress too, nationally.  Trump wants U.S. to ignore: Chart NYT 7/30/20
Inhofe says,‚Äù..didn‚Äôt get the required documentation.‚Äù This after our top generals pulled support. In other words, this guy is done: stick a fork in yet another Trump nominee.....
Trump his dipping his toe in the water to see what the national sentiment is to him retaining office beyond his term without reelection. We MUST make it clear we will not even suffer the notion.
Trump should be removed from office today for even suggesting postponing the election this fall.  And if any of our GOP representatives even entertain this idea after their stand during the spring elections, they should be removed, too.
Republicans, now, please, please?
Twitter probably won't do anything so Trump doesn't complain about them
Trump keeps revealing how little he understands U.S. or our Constitution. Only Congress can delay/postpone and election. He should know if Nancy agreed to it, She becomes POTUS 1/20/21 NOON. He should also know if no election Nancy becomes POTUS 1/20/21 NOON... Go for it Donald!
Stop bothering with Trump supporters. It's wasted time and breath.
We understand COVID-19 was a ‚ÄúBlack-Swan‚Äù event. Coupled with the other BS event-Trump‚Äôs EC, election: this IS his fault..... Source: NYT Online, 7/30/20
I don't think Trump has even HEARD of the Constitution
I can‚Äôt vote üó≥ because I am a felon, but if I could I would write in my own name anyway, so Biden ain‚Äôt needing me either way, but Trump is better by a small pile of poop üí©.
Has Trump been good for agriculture in the USA?
Everytime I see a Trump yard sign, I just want to kick it
China is at fault for not warning us. But it is Trump's responsibility to protect Americans, and he failed.
Retweeting an earlier article. Regarding fears Trump won‚Äôt honor the People‚Äôs vote: In its conclusion is a warning:  ‚ÄúAmerican experiment‚Äôs greatest achievement will come to a grinding halt, and with it the hope that a republic can ever be kept.‚Äù
Holy shit. If AG Barr or Trump uses the phrase, "We'll stand down when they stand up," It's officially an occupation.
Seriously, Trump is the biggest baby I've ever seen in my life.
That's happening right now under Trump...
Absolutely. Remember that nonsense narrative he'll be the conscience of the party and will stand up to Trump?  Pfft.
I would vote for a ham sandwich over Trump
It couldn‚Äôt have happened to a better CONservative except Jim Jordan or Moscow Mitch, or Ted Cruz or Mike Pence or DeSaintis or Trump...or....
Trump, the world's greatest whiner/liar! Congrats.
Trump wants Biden to pick Kamala because he knows how unlikable Harris is!
If you're both poor and a Trump supporter, he's got a message for you.
Mika: You and Joe helped elect Trump four years ago by giving him millions of dollars of earned media. Have you and hubby apologized yet? That would help.
This hearing on AG Barr is a complete joke. The Democrats are just making themselves look unprofessional and scared shitless of Trump getting reelected in November. Their only play is keeping Biden in the basement and controlling the narrative through MSM. It's really sad.
This virus started in China üá®üá≥ and it can not be Trump virus because it never started in America #getyourfactstraight
If she had full authority to draw down Afganistan or renegotiate middle east commitments I could see her stepping up.  But she'd have to be given full control of the effort and Trump would have to take her advice seriously.
The Trump boys are meaningless Trust Fund Babies üë∂!
Please explain what Trump did to destroy the middle. You‚Äôre delusional.
Trust me: Trump will time his backstage visits with these children during their wardrobe change.
just open up the country and let us for back to living our lives.  Your talking like 4 years ago when Trump ran. The economy was trashed by you and your counterpart  you won't be fixing anything, you will really just push us under the rug again
I know Strzok got a raw deal. But, honestly, how many 'Trump is corrupt/compromised' books do there need to be?  I hope he gets paid. but damn...
Trump can't get people to stop getting those meddlesome tests. So, the second best option is to just stop reporting numbers.   98 more days!
What does the media have to do with proper treatment? Conservatives are loving this because they're "being suppressed by the media" and dems love it because they can bash Trump over the head with it. My point is... it's all bullshit and to let the Drs do what they do best.
I would believe that tRump is a reptial in disguise.  And a really bad one at that.
supporting trump is what makes you unattractive not your physical appearance
My biggest flex is that none of my friends are trump supporters üòå
Wouldn't that imply that Trump actually cares about his son? It will be surrogates and staff like this:
So, if we had a worthwhile testing and contact tracing program, there would be more tools at our disposal to fight the pandemic?  Sure, there is some partisan entrenchment here - it's politics, but Trump's dicking the dog from the start is the original sin.
So I was just trying to draw somebody screaming ‚Äúfuck‚Äù kind of with their mouth like trump here.. so I googled ‚Äúscreaming fuck‚Äù on my school computer and switched to images tab... not the ‚Äúscreaming fuck‚Äù I was looking for üò¨
Democrats protesters, protesting Democrats cops üöì, in Democrats cities, in Democrats states, led by Democrats. Blame Trump. Typical mindless Marxist woman!
I used to think that Senate Republicans were tanking things because they know Trump is going to lose and they're getting ready to blame any post 2020 turmoil on Biden.  Now I think they're just soulless and dumb - a dangerous combination.
1. Donald Trump 2. Shit ton of corruption 3. Racist
Trump was married to Ivana up until 1992. That is Ivanka's mother. Maybe you Im not sure exactly what year Maria Farmer worked the desk. It was during the Clinton presidency. Look up the reporting and interviews done by Whitney Webb. She has a ton of good info.
That is absolutely upside down. I know a very vocal Trump supporter who is a lesbian. I also know a black lady who is a supporter. It's counter-intuitive in my book. Not something I would have guessed correctly.
Do you think Trump knew about Ivana going on recruiting walks with Ghislane in the 90s? Seems they were good friends.
Ivanka Trump, Nikki Haley Michael Savage and  Eric July ( Fuck it).
Trump could f*ck up a wet dream.
Trump's wonderful new Postmaster General has changed things: Cut overtime-This means that if a carrier doesn't deliver all their mail pieces by the end of shift then they bring it back and try again tomorrow. This new policy will cause at minimum one day of delay to letters.
So as with all thing TRUMP; SNAFU?????
I come from a family of evangelical Christians. They turn the other cheek and vote for trump no matter what. So hypocritical. Ted Nugent is vulgar and insane.
There's probably a metaphor for Trump's polling numbers in that video. Damned if I can find one, though.
Lest they forget, that Joe Biden's "America" is actually happening right now. When Trump is president. Which he is. Today.
I have more of an issue that Trump is golfing for the 8573417250th time than who is golfing with him. And honestly I wouldn‚Äôt even care how much he golfs if he hadn‚Äôt thrown a temper tantrum every time Obama went golfing
Trump couldn't tweet less or act normal even if he wanted to.
Independent vote is a vote for Trump, remember that
You keep talking about child trafficking yet you support a "group"  that supports a child rapist and suspected trafficker himself in trump. #Hypocrite

This is local government allowing this to happen. They need to fix it. Trump is federal and should not have to deal or be blamed for local matters. Are you asking that he invoke Marshall Law? I would prefer that not to happen.
All I see from the Lincoln Project is a bunch of country club Republicans - formerly marginalized by Trump - trying to buy their way back into power pursuant to the reckoning. Big deal. At least they‚Äôre the devil we know.

Yep, just like Trump, the Clintons, and the rest of Epstein's sick-as-fuck crew.  Some evil people are running the world, guys.
The WH told hospitals to stop reporting to the CDC. It's not going anywhere, but wow it was really easy for Trump &amp; Co to convince you guys. I recommend reading up on critical thinking and giving it a shot - you look really uneducated to those of us who think for ourselves.
Trump has never shown he cares about anyone but himself.
Mindless junkies and paid protesters looting and rioting in Democrats cities and states. Blame Trump...üòÇü§£

You were probably mass reported by trump supporters.
Are you kidding me? The Republicans are the ones refusing to wear masks and protect their own children and family. And why, because you think it takes away from your rights. But yet you support Trump going into States run by Dem Govenors with his Boogaloo Boys causing chaos.
Silly nonsense! If Putin is helping get Trump elected, Putin obviously üôÑ has nothing to fear from Trump and therefore has no motive to assasinate Americans soldiers. Think üí≠ liberals! Try thinking! Democrats sold out American entertainment culture for cash üíµ to China üá®üá≥! Duh
Scott Walker praising Trump for doing something he's refused to do since the onset of the Covid. I think he actually appreciates what Trump is doing now (I do too), but I see this as a thinly veiled criticism of the President. Ironically, I don't think Walker realizes that.

Am I off base by thinking this:  Senate Gippers know Trump is toast. They're willing to push the country off a cliff right now and then they're going to try to hang that around Biden's neck for the next four years.
Can‚Äôt wait for Biden and Trump to face off! Biden will be exposed! He can‚Äôt even read off a teleprompter. Feel bad for anyone who thinks he would be a good president!
If Trump loses the election and then refuses to leave then this voter is heading to DC to join in the protests. No way is he staying in The Whitehouse one more minute than necessary.
It sounds like this Trump supporter may have a foreign accent. An immigrant Trump supporter, how cute!
The mayor is a DEMOCRAT! The protesters are DEMOCRATS. The cops are DEMOCRATS. Blame Trump? What hypocrites!
Democrats protesting Democrats in Democrats states and cities, led by Democrats. Blame Trump. Get da fu.. otta here with dat weak junk, punk!
The Democrats are manufacturing and reinforcing rioting and looting. Moderate mommies with kids are turning to Trump because they are afraid of Democrats rioting in streets and protesting nonsense and the complete lack of Democrats leadership!
Democrats lie compulsively because Democrats are Marxist liberals and Marxism actively seeks removing theology and it‚Äôs rules from society. Removing theology makes morality relative and justifies their lies. Obviously üôÑ Trump isn‚Äôt racist! Trump could easily have been a Democrat
Democrats protesting Democrats in Democrats states and Cities, led by Democrats. Democrats shipping in Democrats protesters from other Democrats states and the Democrats try blaming Trump. The protests are a Democrat manufactured phenomenon in the protesting spot everyone goes.
I mean, ok. Let's pretend that's the case for a minute. Isn't that a huge gamble on her and Trump's part.   That case isn't going anywhere before the election and if Trump loses, her pardon hopes go away. Will she roll the dice, try to slow play it and hope he wins?
You were in CIA. In your experience, if there was something for the US to gain and your only obstacle was a foreign leader like Trump. You'd let the interns handle that one, right?

The funny thing is thats literally the plan and many DNC voters are cool with it. Just as long as Trump is defeated and we can make sure we keep the slavery and genocide going in China. Things at Wal Mart would get super expensive if we brought manufacturing jobs back to the US.
Tell that to Trump
I think Trump is the trigger man, but RoJo is definitely driving the getaway car.
This is already trump's America at the boarder.
Nikki wants to be POTUS. She thinks yelling üêÇüí© into the Twitterverse will get her recognition...  1) She‚Äôs competing with lots of üí©. 2) Nobody outside SC knows her,wants to! 3) She worked for Trump; maybe she‚Äôs unawares but simply taking a job from him is disqualifying.....
I‚Äôm not angry. I send money to the Lincoln Project. Whatever it takes to rid our country of Trump is good.Imagine proudly announcing to the world that you are xenophobic...  Oh wait, Trump probably has no idea what ‚Äùxenophobic" actually means. LMAO

Wow. This was a good read. It was borderline enraging to see that we are still dealing with the same shit almost 30 yrs later. -health care reform -prison reform -ban assault rifles Nothing has changed. 2 steps forward, 2 steps back thanks to GWB and Trump.
So Trump wants to delay the election apparently
All the dipshit republicans will vote in person and it will look like a trump victory, but all the smart Dems will have voted absentee and will take it back. Trump will claim victory on evening of 11/3 before absentees can be counted. I‚Äôm terrified.
Then, do your job. Eschew access journalism for actual work. People get tired of disillusioned Trump voter pieces and thinly-veiled coded pieces about Black people. Inform people. Clickbait and nonsense makes the situation worse.
Part of the reason Trump is facing a second term are Berners and third-party dorks. Can't forgive that.  Part of the reason Kamala Harris isn't the nominee are hoteps, Berners, and fake woke asswaffles.  Unforgivable.
Eddie Glaude Marc Lamont Hill Van Jones  The Triumvirate of Trifling were allowed national TV time and platforms to bash HRC, praise Jill Stein and proclaim when Trump became presidential.  There is no rationalizing stupidity.
The funniest thing about the media being played by Trump, are the media complaining about it. Y'all are being played.
Sad the FDA wants more deaths on its hands.  The length that Twitter, FDA, and the left will go, just to try and change the person in the White House is purely disgusting. After Trump wins. I hope he brings back public hangings and punishes those who are trying to kill citizens.
Fauci: social distancing and masks please.  Trump: You‚Äôre fires!  Immanuel: sex with demons might help?  Trump: Brilliant! Here‚Äôs a raise!

But Barr is working for Trump!!!!
Bill Barr is almost 70 years old, has seen America through wars, bigotry and hatred. Yet, after all that, he's been willing to crush the rights of so many Americans, in order to serve Trump.
Why does  air so many democrat advertisements?  Trump should ask the DOJ to verify equal charging of these ads,  seems like they are lowering the price for democrats and raising it for Republicans.
Trump was right about hydroxychloroquine.
Trump has never made a coherent soeach in his life show me one speach where trump spoke coherently

It took less than a week for Trumps Campaign to turn the ENTIRE 20 minute interview into a 20 minute YouTube add with the Trump text line. Trump is desperate to get young people votes so this is his play.

I had a joke about Trump‚Äôs border wall, but it fell flat.
Yes i live in sheboygan and i am an ex con i can also read and i see how the gop are destroying this country. I do find it hypocritical that you mention me being an ex con when trump is constantly breaking the law his jackboots violate the law
It‚Äôs just that we had so many good candidates and we literally settled on the one most likely to go down to the wire with trump. Like Dems are actively trying to lose this thing. Smdh
I hate trump and all the trump supporters more than you know. But good god you anti Bernie get over it Dems are a close second. Y‚Äôall are the reason me and thousands more voted third party and left you with Trump. I can‚Äôt in good consience do that again, but seriously, fuck y‚Äôall
In 20 there are so many great candidates that it‚Äôs no small wonder Bernie lost as much as he did. People chose Biden because they felt he was safe. Unimaginative, stale, and a bit of a groper, you can‚Äôt tell me any of the other dem candidates would poll worse against trump
I can‚Äôt wait to vote against Trump, either.
I‚Äôm just saying, the likelihood of trump winning would be much less if a decent candidate won the dem nomination. But here we are. We‚Äôll see who needs to ‚Äúget over it‚Äù if Ohio goes to trump.

The only lawlessness here is the actions of the federal government. Federal agents in unmarked vans grabbing citizens in the street exercising their 1st amendment rights is an egregious violation of due process and civil liberties. No one‚Äôs rights are safe in Trump‚Äôs America.
I‚Äôd love to go to the CDC website but that has been appropriated by Donald fucking trump.
Have you seen the states that have? Lol please don‚Äôt listen to anything those two women have to say. They are only out to make money from Trump‚Äôs campaign
We need to stop Trump from creating chaos in Democrat run States in order to prove lies that Democrats are creating lawlessness. When in reality the troops he sends in are escalating tensions by taking people without identifying themselves.  I was taught that this was kidnapping

Now do Trump.
Watching Trump speak in general does
Trump is the master of confabulation, a sign of dementia. He gives false answers &amp; makes up stories, like that his Drs never had any do as great as he did on this simple test.
This secret police Trump has engaged reminds me of the bastards in ‚ÄúThe Handmaids Tale‚Äù. Trump is not a dictator although he‚Äôs acting that way. The military might have to stand up and overthrow this racist narcissistic egomaniac liar.
So a pro Biden tweet should get you fired, right?  Sue the hell out of them!
I‚Äôll never understand this. I‚Äôm not pro trump or anything but can‚Äôt you respect other people‚Äôs political views without blocking them? Seems kind of childish
12 US Presidents owned slaves.  Woodrow Wilson premiered the pro-KKK film, "Birth of a Nation" inside the White House.   I don't like Trump. I get political hyperbole, but come on.

I am starting to worry about Trump. He hasn‚Äôt tweeted all day
The two statements don‚Äôt even sound alike. More amped up drama against anyone questioning the trump administration is what this is.

Yea, I was a Yang guy myself haha. I totally get that. Vote who fits your policies more. For me, economy was doing good before COVID, Trump is trying to remove troops from Middle East. His downside is his character and use of twitter haha.
Donald Trump someday soon:
No room, no time, no desire, no option for Trump. Nov 3....let‚Äôs permanently retire him to his federal prison cell. #WeWillVote
One would think that by somebody of your caliber would've done your research. But like a typical Trump supporter, you were just too damned lazy. Go back to your foil hats and fake media agenda. And educate yourself. ALWAYS seek further education.
Calebrisi is about as true a believer as there is in Trump. At least before today.
THIS is what's wrong in America today; business owners do nothing wrong, but people THINK they did something wrong, so the business owners have to change. Other peoples' feelings trump real action and intent. -- Good thing I'll be dead soon, this country is starting to suck.

Maybe Herman should have either worn a mask or not shown up at the Trump's Tulsa Corona-Fest...
Can't believe it's 2020 and people are still surprised By Donald Trump constantly having verbal sharts about random topics and taking it at face value.
I hate that people only ignore the benefits of it in early stages of treatment because of Trump
Trump is somehow simultaneously an absentee voter and has gone into the polling place and signed for his ballot 'for years and years'.
Trump and his allies will be silent. Instant Karma (after 4 years)!

"Schraa shared links to unreputable sources that found masks ineffective, while leading medical journals, federal and world health officials, research universities and President Donald Trump have said masks do work to cut down transmission." via
I was thinking more like the comparison of watching a presidential speech and watching Jerry Springer. Trump thinks people tune in to his press conferences out of love when it's really because we want to see him fall on his face during the Trump sh*tshow.
I doubt very much that anyone at the Federalist Society really wanted Trump to be president, they did enable him though and helped push through lots of judges
I suspect Trump must have been yelled at by his staff, 'cause now he claims his Tweet promoting unconstitutional meddling was done to create dialogue. He's still setting the table to contest his coming history making beat down.
That's because Obama is something that Trump can't be and won't ever be... a leader.
I'm with you, the why doesn't matter as much as as the fact Trump lost a co-founder of the Federalist Society... That's mind blowing ü§Ø

Read this thread. It‚Äôs so sad &amp; such a waste that a man who (imperfect as he was) overcame so much is dead due exclusively to the anti-intellectualism that defines the Trump GOP.
Trump suggests delaying election. His anti-democratic intent is no joke. By ‚Å¶
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Wow! He truly was a great conservative and loves our President, Donald J. Trump.
So please, I‚Äôm begging you, vote. Vote for the candidate who has the highest chance of beating Trump. Encourage your friends to do the same. This year needs to be a defining year in righting the course of our country‚Äôs history. 5/5
It is abundantly clear now: there is no more room for wishy washy equating of the two presidential candidates. Donald Trump is unquestionably worse. Voting any way other than for Biden is enabling the degeneration of our entire system, flawed though it may currently be, into 1/?
Watching Obama here, you do understand why Trump tried to hold a presser to counter it.
Go ahead, it hands the reins of power to whoever the Dems elect as Pres pro-tem of the Senate on January 3, as they'd have a majority because the incumbents up for the 2020 Senate elections give the GOP control.  January 20th, the now Dem president will order Trump's arrest.
Ya learn something new every day.
Food delivery service is based on location and has increased costs. Meals on Wheels funding was recently cut(Trump joked that old people ‚Äújust die anyway‚Äù). FFCRA and PMLA limits lasts 2 weeks. My state went into lockdown 18 weeks ago.  2/2
Cain was a smart man. He made the choice himself to side with trump
And Donald Trump...
And these federal agents getting sent to cities is step 1.  They‚Äôre are sending them down to Milwaukee, and guess who isn‚Äôt having ANY riots or any notable protests?  I gave up on saying ‚Äúit will never happen‚Äù after Trump was elected.
please remind people blaming Trump for CV19 deaths that people have free will when it comes to wearing masks.
Apparently Pompeo knows even less about the Constitution than Trump.  If that's even possible.
Trump mails in HIS vote.
He supported a fool. Had he taken the virus seriously he may still be worth us. His choice to back Trump and ignore science is the reason he is dead. Good riddance. He was killed by his own stupidity.
Joe Rogan &gt;Lady that cries about Trump endlessly
What in the F is she talking about? ‚ÄúThis is War‚Äù????? Cain, at age 74, CHOSE  to risk his and others lives to attend an indoor trump rally in Tulsa wearing NO mask, with ZERO social distancing. THATS WHY HE CONTRACTED AND DIED FROM COVID-19. FUll STOP!
I wish Trump treated the Coronavirus like a WMD...because this one is actually real.

The Trump administration and Oregon leaders declared victory after it was announced that U.S. agents guarding a federal courthouse during violent demonstrations in Portland will pull back:
Every day I have to see the Trump yard signs in the yards surrounding me pisses me off and makes me wonder what it is exactly about this man doesn't alarm them, worry them, or that they have faith in to lead us. . . He's no republican/conservative. I will never understand.

LOL-   Now all of a sudden, there is a concern.  The president in a tweet questioned whether the date should be pushed back until a time when ‚Äòpeople can properly, securely and safely vote.‚Äô
I hope it‚Äôs in November. That way you will know you get 4 more years of Trump as your president sooner.
Just to save you the trouble your candidate is going to lose. Jo Jorgensen does not have any poll numbers to compare to Trump or Biden.
Trump's biggest fan is Trump.  Lol
Not getting an argument from me. He did and has done all those things. Not a Bill fan. I also don‚Äôt assign his actions to his wife-just as i don‚Äôt assign Trump‚Äôs cheating and vulgar comments to his wife. Both are simply disgusting men.

Pres. Trump suggests delaying 2020 election
The article even says it‚Äôs unlikely but I would like to add oh hell noooooooo we cannot handle even an extra day with this guy
‚ÄúIn the distance you can hear Democrats cheering wildly.‚Äù Trump supporter or not that comment is willfully ignorant full stop.
On the bright side, anybody who doubted how screwed Trump is in November should have no doubt now. He‚Äôs extremely desperate.  Also, this is another reminder that is Trump does somehow win in November...any argument that we‚Äôre still a democracy will be finished.
Chill, twitter. The election date would have to be changed by an act of congress, including via a Democratic controlled house.  Trump does what he wants because the GOP passively never stops him. This would require major, active changes rubber stamped by Democrats.
So let me see if I have this right. Trump talks to Putin on an unscheduled call, don't bring up bounties on our soldiers heads, but suddenly pulls our troop out of Germany. Geez, I wonder what they talked about.
President Trump is for the first time floating a "delay" to November's presidential election, as he makes allegations that increased mail-in voting will result in fraud:
1. No one is pushing "universal" mail-in ballot. States are pushing diff things - nothing universal about it.  2. Trump cannot delay the election. States control the elections, and only Congress can delay an election.   Don't Panic. REGISTER TO #Vote

How did those judges work out for you when they voted against Trump 9 separate times in the last 3.5 years?   SCOTUS isn‚Äôt a partisan toy.
Trump isn‚Äôt even trying to get re-elected but people like you are too dumb to notice.   Follow the money. Seriously. He just gave up on Michigan today and pulled all ad dollars.   There‚Äôs simply too much for him to defend and not enough money to go around.
I dunno. I think the 'Trump staying on in the face of a clear defeat' scare stories are just that.  I just don't believe that like...the military and entire governmental apparatus backing him and playing along is plausible enough to be an assumption.

Trump is beyond deplorable.
None of us can say what will happen in 4 years. Americans tend to swing back &amp; forth on a pendulum. I live in a swing state. There is no choice for me. I will scrape off my skin with razor blades after I do it, but I know I can‚Äôt allow Trump to win again. Not this time.
And this was a group effort. Trump is not omnipotent.  Narcissistic but not all knowing
And most the issues were in place before Trump took office. Expect Covid-but everybody screwed that one up.
And believe it or not, Trump can be contained. Most times he‚Äôs all talk.  Typical CEO.
With all the intelligent people in that party it surprises me.  And their only message is Trump sucks and get ready for more taxes. No solid ideas. At least Obama had ideas. Didn‚Äôt like all of them, but they were ideas to make country better
Trump is challenging but he‚Äôs been accused of things that don‚Äôt hold water.  Just assumptions and conjecture.  If Dems had a moderate, would consider that.... but they dont
Well, to start with, I wrote in John Kasich.  Felt he was the best option. But Trump won.  As a conservative, main tenets are limited govt and strong economy.  Everybody wins with that. Bill Clinton won on it‚Äôs the economy stupid.  And as an American, I respect the office

Nope.  These folks would have done it anyway.  We had our shot at unity with Kasich, but did a poor job reaching the fed up folks.  Trump was their rebellion to a broken corrupt system.  He was the best worst option unfortunately.

Horrible. Trump‚Äôs America.
Democrats voted for Trump to have this power to use the Feds. Maxine Waters and many others were instrumental in it. They believed Obama had the right to be Authoritarian, but not Trump

That's Rush Limbaugh's nickname. That's the excuse he gave for not fighting against the communism he claims he hates in Vietnam. Another coward like Trump, Cheney, and O'Reilly.
That's the line I used to congratulate Kanye on dumping Drumpf. That's the Trump families real Bavarian name.
Democrats voted for Trump to have this power to use the Feds
My loyalties are to democracy. You worship a draft-dodging, woman molesting coward who conspires with communist dictators to destroy democracy. Remember, Trump said he admired what the communist Chinese regime did at Tianamen Square. Treason.
Democrats voted for Trump to have this power to use the Feds
If Trump proclaimed himself king of America VMC would drop to his knees and put his nose to the ground in servile worshipfulness. Cultists like VMC believe Trump was put on the earth to rule over them.
Obama, and Maxine Waters were happy for Trump to have this power over the feds. They passed these laws. So they can't be Gestapo. They are a product of liberal and Democrat legislation
Oppressive, tyrannical govt. and taxation existed thousands of years before socialism or communism. It was created by conservative elites like Trump who believe god ordained them to rule over everybody. They never thought they would have to pay taxes.
Democrats have been selling us out to china for years and trump turned off the faucet.  Now you are cheering for more deaths and job loss so he doesnt win the election.  do you see how sick you are?
It‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs mind that‚Äôs the problem. He never was that smart to begin with‚Ä¶
Not a lot of Trump Spirit that we can detect.
I love MLB, NBA, &amp; NFL, but I just don't see any way this can work without large numbers of players getting sick. I am afraid greed is going to TRUMP the greater good at a very high cost. Nothing will get better until common sense and science prevail.
OK... Pence resigns now after he is passed over. Trump gets COVID and is hospitalized and Pelosi become Acting President. That would be interesting.
I've seen the Trump Twitter trends. They're juvenile and petty.  They throw anything out there hoping something will stick with the masses. Not a chance!
Unfortunately Momma k blocked me so I couldn‚Äôt view anything. Want to know the real Trump? Follow  He saw EVERYTHING Trump did as an employee on the Apprentice. He tags Trump every time he posts &amp; doesn‚Äôt get sued because it‚Äôs ALL true.
We weren‚Äôt discussing Biden, we were discussing Trump. Still waiting for that video showing what Trump does before 11am. His sons run the businesses but he is sole beneficiary
But Trump becomes President of a WHOLE country?! ü§î Make it make sense!
said that Ken Cuccinelli and Chad Wolf are likely criminally and civilly liable for their actions regarding the Trusted Traveller" program. What is your exposure on the invasion of Portland? Are you two willing to go to prison and be wiped out financially for Trump?
So disgusting to watch Trump and his allies lies on  Twitter‚Äôs so-called ‚ÄúTrending Truths‚Äù, where sooo many truths are about Trump, and never a good one.‚Äù But it‚Äôs what it is.
No one who has done a Trump boat parade has a penis larger than 3 inches prove me wrong.
Illegal? It's amazing how fucking stupid any pathetic pecketwood motherfucker would support Trump.   If you do and follow me, don't. You live in an alternate reality void of human decency.
Now do Trump
I think the reason Trump isn‚Äôt going is not not create a distraction and not a sign of disrespect. (Kind of the half full approach)
Y‚Äôknow. At some point the crowd is going to realize there are many more of them than there are of Green Army Men. It‚Äôs not going to turn out well. Well, Trump always wanted to see a parade of tanks in the streets.
Trump sucks. #VoteJoeBiden2020 #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica

If the state guard was called out... then Trump would federalize it immediately- which is constitutional
Only people who really think Trump hates women are liberals who want Real Men stop being so Tough an more like soyboys üôÑ
If trump loses in nov... America will  need a long detox
It's your commie loving Fuhrer who's is attempting to destroy America by conspiring with communist dictators. Conservative elites like Trump hate democracy more than they hate communism. Hitler and Stalin conspired to invade Poland together.
No it was conservative cultists who believed the king was ordained by god to rule them. If Trump proclaimed himself the king of America you would drop to your knees and do whatever he asked even throw white babies into ovens.
You mean that late start where DJT put the restrictions on incoming travel here (dems opposes) from the origins of the virus? Masks? You mean the differing views of the reliability of masks across country? the cdc-
Most media members have Trump derangement syndrome so thats bullshit. They are hoping for anything to make Trump look bad
Want to know what went on in Lafayette Square that one night Trump needed a photo op? Read the link below (the full statement) from a National Guardsman deployed that night.
A recession seems to be the PERFECT time for a frivolous project like this using taxpayer funds . . . unless of course she and Mr. Trump are gifting this renovation to the government out of the goodness of their hearts, and also, boredom. #Melania
That'd be great. I've pinned down almost every Trump supporter I know to where they'd drop support for Trump if he chooses Ivanka, Jared, or Junior as his running mate.  Not that I expect them to adhere to it once it happens, but it'll be nice to watch them justify it.
Every thoughtful Trump fan I ever talk to is willing to admit they'd rather have him than Trump if you push them on it.
I suspect Trump has already forgotten he said that.  If not-- hoping the rest of us have...

Trump‚Äôs new favorite doctor was sued for malpractice after patient died: report
On his podcast with Molly Jong-Fast, "The New Abnormal" (great BTW), Rick Wilson said trump in these last 100 days is "like a rat in a bucket." He will do literally anything to save his own hide.  Evocative and true.
They'll just claim turnout was depressed because of the paranoia created by Mockingbird Media, and Trump wouldn't let them vote by mail (vote absentee instead?).   And of course they couldn't vote in person, even though masks totally work right? I can already see the script.
In which Cody finally comes out as the Trump supporter his attentive viewers have worried that he might be. I mean, possibly he‚Äôs very stupid and doesn‚Äôt understand the difference between a friend and an ally, but I don‚Äôt believe that Cody is stupid.
Is confessed rapist Donald Trump‚Äôs good friend Alan Dershowitz a paedophile? Yes, says Alan Dershowitz in this op-ed, in which he argues that it‚Äôs OK for adult men to rape 14-year-old girls.
Every day that the Never Trumpers occupy Trump &amp; his campaign is a day lost to Biden.
Trump: It‚Äôs safe to open schools  Also Trump: We might have to delay the election because it‚Äôs not safe  üòëüî´
So what you‚Äôre saying is Trump has not accomplished anything to run on!!!
Today started off amazingly with a 5 am sunrise hike - then I got back home to the reports of Trump calling for an indefinite election postponement and fell down a sleep deprived doomscrolling K-hole.  So... cool cool cool... try again tomorrow
Fuck.  I just remembered America elected Donald Trump as president
I know the results right now...you lose. One Term Trump.
Wait, I thought you were going to postpone the election. NOT PATRIOTIC. One Term Trump.
The day news was released that the US hit 150,000 deaths from Covid and the economy fell by one-third under Trump, he distracts everyone by talking about delaying the election. Stop falling for it. It's all distraction.
I have been saying that Trump is mentally and emotionally an 8 year old. That would mean he is living in 1954. That explains the "suburban housewife" quote and keeping "low income" people out of your neighborhood. 1954 is where he wants to be.
Because Fauci said so, he's a doctor You are not .  Look what listening to trump got you 148,000 dead.and we can't attend games , meanwhile look at New Zealand!
Terrible question. Per the U.S. Constitution, it is illegal to do that. Plus we know Trump just wants to stay in power longer.  Do better, NBC 15.
Is this a good idea?  President Trump floated the idea of delaying the Nov. 3 presidential election to combat voter fraud.
Trump is Nazi party 2.0
Thank you for your coverage of Trump's plan to steal the election by delaying absentee ballots.  Please ask the Biden campaign what their plans are to handle this.  Dems need to be aggressive in seeking court orders to make postmark dates acceptable.
Tell Congress: Defund and dismantle the DHS agencies taking part in Trump's "surge" of unaccountable federal forces terrorizing communities and being sent to largely Black and brown urban centers across the country! &gt;&gt;  via
Or of Trump using those nuclear codes when he loses.
The trump presidency is a slow moving Jonestown.
David, the public must be prepared for these shenanigans, beginning with a fake "October Surprise" from Bill Barr and Jon Durham.  No one should be shocked by anything Trump tries and everyone should be conditioned not to accept Trump lies at face value.
It's the virus stupid.
You realize trump is planning on pulling troops out of Germany because his communist buddy Putin told him too...
The majority of Wisconsin‚Äôs Congressional Delegation, from both sides of the aisle, rebuked a recent suggestion by President Donald Trump to postpone the November elections due to the COVID-19 crisis.
Doctor retweeted by Trump has warned of alien DNA, sex with demons
In the final months of the Trump administration the red lights of corruption are flashing. Where is all the money going? Will we ever know? #TrumpMeltdown  #TrumpCorruption #TrumpThreatensAmerica
If the Trump administration loved America, they would fund the USPS extra this year specifically because of covid and concerns about our election. But the Trump administration does not give a shit about America so they do the opposite. This could be a real problem.
Thank god twitter won‚Äôt be an issue just all the things that were bad under Bush you didn‚Äôt change with Obama and have gotten worse under trump
He died because Trump and the Republicans don't believe in science
FAKE NEWS!! FAKE NEWS! The only people spewing this crap are trump and his deplorables. Wow! All he knows is cheating! PATHETIC.  üò±Run the "libs" are coming arrghh!!üëª Idiots. #TrumpThreatensAmerica  #DEPLORABLESARETRAITORS #TrumpDoesNotCareAboutMilitary
You can tell how big Trump's trolling smirk is by how many pieces of punctuation he uses. üòè
Within a few days, Google scrubbed the translation, as did Cambridge Dictionary and others.  It was revealed in the Google whistleblower docs last year that they indeed conspired to scrub the translation from the internet to make Trump look inept.
While Trump was warning us about it in the SOTU and closing down travel from China, Nancy was ripping up the speech and telling people not to worry and to go visit Chinatown.  You low-information rube.
It's another matter of Trump trolling people who don't understand how things work.   It would take an act of Congress to change the date, a near impossibility in late July before a Nov. election.  But now he has them all FIRMLY supporting a Nov. 3 election date, no matter what.
I thought we had this discussion? Trump rementions it out of running out of other diversion antics.  And you the press pounce on his every word.  Did you hear President Obama today? Did you hear what he said?
Trump is just repeating the GOP party doctrine on school shootings since Columbine
The Wu Flu isn't just a way to attempt mail-in voting fraud, it's the foundation of Mockingbird Media's forthcoming delegitimization campaign against Trump's inevitable re-election.  "COVID prevented voting!" will be the new "Trump didn't win the popular vote!"
The majority of Wisconsin‚Äôs Congressional Delegation, from both sides of the aisle, rebuked a recent suggestion by President Donald Trump to postpone the November elections due to the COVID-19 crisis.
Trump won‚Äôt do that. He would rather fight- better be ready. This is not going to be pretty!  Pentagon and Biden better be ready to remove Trump with force. Courts need to be prepared to refuse Trumps legal pleas.
Love trusting the guy who didn‚Äôt prosecute bush admin for war crimes to lock up trump for emoluments violations
For those wondering ‚Äúis the US ambassador to the Netherlands seriously this dumb?‚Äù the answer is no, he‚Äôs much dumber:
It really boggles my mind that the same day Herman Cain dies because of following Trump‚Äùs refusal to wear masks, that  is actively planning to sue  for today‚Äôs Mask Mandate.  WTF?  ü§îü§î
Absolutely. I knew this would happen. Won‚Äôt be pretty if Bill Barr has to testify. And if Trump pardons him , Flynn will have to answer all questions.
Ironically Donald Trump's presidency that started with building a wall to keep people out will end with Americans legally not being allowed to leave the country
Same reason President Trump talked about postponing the election within minutes or the worst GDP print in US history. Coincidence?  Twitter was buzzing about Trump not the economy
Obama had a few jabs at Trump at first, then he went off. The look of sadness mixed with anger on his face was unreal. Then when he said everything his face was showing. Amazing!
Defending his earlier tweet. Get ready for it, we are going to find out what the GOP really is.  I hope they choose the right side of history or we will be heading to a point of no return.
Because his neoliberal failures led directly to Trump?  Nah, I get that.
Trump will retract the tweet and Calabresi will decide that's sufficient enough to win his vote in November.
Always remember:  Cops lie as much as Trump.
Trump and the repugnicans killed him.
Not that we live and breath the girations of corporate profit, but it is one of the few external measuring sticks Trump consults. Is it a coincidence that he tossed out the idea of postponing the election the day reports show we've wiped out 5 years of growth? #DemonSemen
Holy fuck 40 years and we went from Reagan committing queer genocide to trump committing partisan genocide. Like wow I was saying this couldn‚Äôt easily be compared to the aids epidemic but no it literally is identical my bad
#trumppresser  Trump‚Äôs COVID-19 briefing in a nutshell: ‚Ä¢Things are bad ‚Ä¢Not my fault ‚Ä¢Things will get better ‚Ä¢But we won‚Äôt change anything we‚Äôre currently doing ‚Ä¢Absentee ballots are great, mail in ballots are the Devil VOTE IN NOVEMBER!!
A large number of congressional Republicans openly rejected Trump's suggestion that Nov.'s presidential election should be delayed, a move that the president would have no authority to make
Trump wants his name on everything so it can be the Trump virus. Or "a thing called the Trump virus." if he prefers. And use uppercase on virus because he likes it random: a Thing called the Trump Virus.
Credit to  for recognizing early what a danger to the rule of law Trump poses.
What does it say about the Trump pandemic response that the US pace of fatalities is close to those of Brazil, India, and Mexico...?
Trump is a big mutherfuckr
Racism is what keeps Republicans' very lucrative evil clown circus going, and if Trump truly madly deeply knows really anything at all, that's the thing he knows.
Trump‚Äôs recklessness, belligerence and incompetence killed him.
Flynn still not safe &gt;
Benghazi? Really? Your boy trump is ok with Russian bounties on US troops. Your boy also is "taking no responsibility" for 150000 dead Americans.
Donald J. Trump is the first President with a Jewish First Family, you fucking noob.
Today‚Äôs a good day to gather and scream FUCK DONALD TRUMP!
BUT...Herman Cain CHOSE to not wear a mask.  He CHOSE to not believe science.  He CHOSE to go to that god damn rally.  Trust me, I firmly believe that Trump is responsible for all these deaths, but let‚Äôs not forget people are making choices.
If the last 3.5 years have taught me anything. It's that American politics have no room for logic or critical thinking.  Just imagine if the BLM protests were pro-2nd amendment protests, Lafayette park had happened under Obama, and he had said what Trump said/did on June 1st.
It's not &lt;likely&gt; Trump will try to delay the election or refuse to leave. But we're 3.5 years into excusing unconstitutional &amp; illegal things that would have ended any prior presidency, &amp; we have many examples of failed democracies. Laws &amp; institutions are not self-enforcing.
REP. STEINEKE; "Hard NO"
Trump is stealing every day. Money drives him  He is profiting from being in the office. 500B has disappeared from the 3 trillion stimulus package. Get it? He can get away with stealing money and distribute enough to keep his sycophants in line.
You guys remember when Trump killed Herman Cain?
Lawyers: Trump can't delay the election because it's illegal and unconstitutional and the institutions will prevent such authoritarian nonsense from happening  Political scientists (especially comparative/IR scholars):   üò¨ü§îüò±

You're asking a tRUmp supporter to research, comprehend, and understand history and facts. I'm sorry but that will never happen unfortunately.
If I thought a critical mass of these shitlibs would wake up from another 4 years of Trump and realize America is a shithole nation and the Dems help make it that way I would actually vote for Trump.
Trump says no other President's golf game has suffered as much as his
‚ÄúWe are going to elect one half of the team that refused to prosecute Bush admin for literal war crimes to lock up trump over emoluments and end fascism!‚Äù
If not voting for Biden is a vote for Trump then about 250 million Americans are going to vote for Trump and there is absolutely no point in voting anyways.  Glad they solved my Biden dilemma for me.

Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúgood economy‚Äù came on the wave created by Obama. And he probably could have kept it up had he not completely botched the pandemic response. His ineptitude has crippled the economy and cost us north of 150,000 lives and things aren‚Äôt getting better. He‚Äôs a racist disaster
Trump is currently deploying federal police to put a stop to people voicing their objections to him. Case in point Portland , Oregon.
We can only hope that Herman Cain gave Trump a kiss at the Tulsa rally.
Obama wasn‚Äôt a golfer like Trump so what kept him so busy during his eight years in office that he couldn‚Äôt get around to this stuff? Gtfoh with this shit.
President Trump hasn't  tear gassed anybody's mom.

And yet there are adult tRUmp supporters who are literally throwing fits in Walmart when they're asked to wear a mask to not only protect them, but others as well.  Kinda ironic, huh? How about you have some sense of awareness?
Let‚Äôs NEVER forget Trump/Barr/Republican all out effort (even this month) to steal away ‚ÄúObama Care‚Äù from Citizens-who are out of work during a Pandemic  no less! STAND UP AMERICANS against these Russian Traitors, who collect huge salaries while 99% suffer,starve &amp; die.
He can't delay voting. And the entire world didn't invent Covid to hurt Trump's election chances. Arrogance combined with stupidity.üôÑ
During the past month, Iran has suffered a half-dozen explosions and fires at military and civilian sites.  The Trump Administration keeps several hundred troops in Syria in defiance of the Syrian government and without authorization from the UN or any other international body.
No one said you have to vote by mail. Go right ahead and show up to the polls. No way in hell will the election be delayed. Trump is a gd idiot even suggesting it. No way the House would approve it.
There‚Äôs a whole gang needs to be impeached! Trump, Barr, McConnell, Graham, Johnson-R-WI, etc. Nov 3, a US-Neuenberg trial with firing squad neds to be established to answer for &gt;150K +NEEDLESSLY DEAD w/o Needed&amp; appropriate Gov assistance! Rep-Mafia blame WHO,  Medical Experts

Let's get 2 Peloton's out and start a class.  See who could do the most/fastest.  Good test of physical acuity.  Hint:  Biden wins.  He does an aggressive Pelton class every day.  The only thing Trump can do aggressively physically is drive a golf cart.

Just give me a break and go support him. I don‚Äôt criticize anyone who wants to vote for him over Trump. But Biden‚Äôs lies are endless, from involvement in Civil Movement to being arrested in South Africa. Why did he dropped out from primary in 1988? Just check that out.

Evers supported moving to an all mail-in election for the presidential primary in April  He has not yet responded today to the president's comment about possibly delaying the November election  Trump is against mail-in voting, so regardless I doubt Evers will be on the same page
Trump's former head of FDA:
Also worth mentioning that the only difference between trump and Obama years foreign policy wise is the scale. Trump is firing more bombs but Obama fired 26k with a 90% civilian casualty rate. Obama kept kids in cages with Mylar blankets in ice boxes Trump is just keeping more
I don't disagree with this set of observations, but how much do we normalize his behavior? Think about it, Trump is a 74-year-old man--a 74-year-old man who is *the President of the United States*-- who can't be trusted to behave at a funeral. The leader of the Free World.

Nobody on my feed can agree on what awful news Trump's election tweets are supposed to distract us from, so that's a good sign.
Trump's obsession with Twitter likes/retweets makes him singularly susceptible to foreign influence by simply dropping a bot network in his followers and generating synthetic positive responses to the things you want him to do. It's incredible.
Evers would have cancelled the April 7 election and given voters until May 19 to return mail-in ballots. He would have sent mail ballots to all registered voters who hadn't already requested one. President Trump does not support voting by mail.
Herman Cain: I Was There, And the Tulsa Trump Rally Crowd Was Huge and Enthusiastic
Wisconsin's Republican senate majority leader says he doesn't agree with moving November's election date as President Trump raised as a possibility, says reporters are hypocrites and biased b/c of their coverage
Here's a rough draft for the media's Trump obituaries (should he ever die).
If the election were delayed, Trump would be replaced by the next valid office holder in the line of succession on January 20, 2021. There is no scenario in which a delayed election allows him to remain in office.
you watch Herman Cain will lie in state in the capitol and Trump will be there with bells on

Chalk one up for the Trump death toll
Today in "the fundamental problem is not Trump, but the Senate GOP"
Swinging into the last year of my 20s and I'm only asking for 1 thing -- to never hear Donald Trump's name again after Nov 3, unless it's in a headline announcing his arrest. Pledge to vote here:   ü•≥üéÇüíå
Is trump trying to hide the fact that unemployment stim is going away tomorrow or just decided today to say that he wants to push back voting? #WeWillVote
But his party at the state level could _cancel_ presidential elections &amp; award Electoral College votes by legislative fiat (Art II, Sect 1). Florida GOP took steps to do so in 2000. GOP controls enough swing states to guarantee Trump reelection this way.
And the quoted tweet conflates two separate issues to make one non sequitur. Constitution permits state govts to appoint Electoral College electors without holding an election. GOP controls enough swing-state govts to guarantee Trump's reelection.
So much! Full court press to hand Wisconsin to Trump.  My sense is this could be avoided with real Dem focus...But Crickets?
Lmfao man so much deflection here. I'm just saying anti-mask and "covid is a hoax" people are stupid, and it has dire consequences. Nothing about Trump, but I could because he echoes those views. And how do riots also happen make this any less dumb?
A MUST READ from McCain‚Äôs former campaign manager; read entire string. Trump‚Äôs tweet this morning about postponing Nov 3 election is a test to see how it plays out in the public; Trump needs to hear back loudly that ONLY Congress has the power to reschedule that election.
Either way, it's decided by congress and I doubt republicans would even remotely risk the chance of a possibly allowing a democrat to be president by default. It's just a tactic by Trump to distract from the terrible GDP numbers.
Trump floats idea of delaying the November election, a power granted to Congress, as he ramps up attacks on voting by mail - The Washington Post
Trump literally killed Herman Cain!
Trump's "delay the election!" cry is exactly such a potential excuse for Republicans in state governments to cancel their states' elections and just award their Electoral College votes to Republicans. That's the danger, and it's real. 9/9
Republicans control both houses of the state legislature and the governorship in enough swing states that if they cancelled their state presidential elections and just appointed Republican electors, they could guarantee President Trump's reelection. 7/9
Even Mitch McConnell is calling bullshit on Trump's plan to delay the November election.
Strong comments this morning after morning Tweet on delaying the election from President Trump.
That was the same thinking that led to trump becoming president.  He‚Äôs facing countless criminal charges when he leaves office, you don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs going to try to avoid that?
And how exactly could that happen if the election is postponed as Trump would like? No election means everything stays as is, so Nancy Pelosi would still be Speaker - aka Madame President Pelosi.
If Republicans think that President Trump's plan to delay the election is such a bad idea, why do they still intend to vote for him?
I agree with some commentator who thinks Trump tweeted that just to draw attention to the problem of vote fraud with massive mail-in voting in states who have never done it. He knows how to get attention on an issue,  that's for sure.
Representative Steineke, do you intend to vote for President Trump? Has his position on delaying elections changed your view on that matter any bit?

The President can not just change an election date as its Constitutionally mandated. What Trump is doing is setting the table for chaos / confusion / dispute on Election Day. This floated idea MUST be stopped NOW &amp; not be given room to take hold. Not doing so will cause US pain.

Trump has no power to delay an election. Why, that would be like caging children, destroying the USPS, filling progressive cities with paramilitary secret police, funneling public money into his businesses, and putting his kids in government roles. It's all totally inconceivable.

Wow, OMG.There has to be some pretty nervous Trump followers out there right now. These Trumpers need to think for themselves.
Trump wanting to delay the election is mainly to distract everyone from the fact that US GPD plunged by 32.9%. Pass it on. Don‚Äôt get distracted. Make sure to register to vote in November.

Here‚Äôs my personal take. We need an age limit for anyone wanting to run for office. Let‚Äôs say you have to be younger than 65 at the time of your inauguration and no second term if you turn older than 65 (Congress also). That said Biden over trump even if he didn‚Äôt have a pulse

No panicking allowed! Read this and know that our Constitution has a plan in place, regardless of what tRump thinks:
He's saying that all mail-in voting, i.e. automatically distributing ballots to all registered voters (dead or alive), could cause fraud. He specifically said absentee ballot voting is good.   Whether you like Trump or not, it is a fact that all mail-in voting *could* cause fraud
No, Trump can‚Äôt delay the election. But his party controls enough swing-state governments to cancel presidential elections and award Electoral College votes to Trump to guarantee victory. If only they had an excuse to do so, as Florida Republicans threatened to do in 2000.

I think the analysis that the "white working class" swinging toward Trump handed him the election was correct, but what "white working class" actually refers to is not very well understood.
Minnesota's Iron Range swung heavily toward Trump between 2012 and 2016, and now looks to be reliably Republican for the house of representatives, and a lot of the miners driving that change make $90,000.  Like, does that count as working class?
It is true that support for Trump is stronger among middle-class whites than among lower-class whites, but the distinction between the two groups, at least in the analysis I've looked at, is over/under the $50,000 income line.  Why isn't that considered working class?

C‚Äômon y‚Äôall..... Trump has tweeted how he gets upset over him trending.  Why is #EveryoneHatesTrump not at #1 today?  If you have not seen it.... watch.  It‚Äôs bloody brilliant.  Now make this trend-just for Trump.
.   WHY HAS EVERONE STOPPED TALKING ABOUT TRUMP &amp; THE BOUNTIES ON U.S. SOLDIERS?  This is not okay. There should be consequences for this. This is the most atrocious thing that man has done and everyone just stoped-Why?  #PutinsBounties

President Trump's talk of a 'suburban lifestyle dream' makes me want to reread Robert M. Fogelson's Bourgeois Nightmares: Suburbia, 1870-1930.
McConnell &amp; the GOP Senators-by a long shot. Trump never pretended to be anything other than who he is. Hated him in 2016-hate him now! But McConnell &amp; the GOP Senate? They pretend to love this country yet pick Party over Country time &amp; again-they are treasonous &amp; I despise them.
It certainly has Trump described
The enormous rally in Kodak shares has no end in sight, after the Trump administration announced the company will be transformed into a pharmaceutical producer under the Defense Production Act.
Despite the intimation of Trump's "Break-In"ad, the vast majority of police interactions with the public comes not in showing up to 911 call, but for TRAFFIC violations.  That's Biden's point:  Cops SHOULD be re-focused on violent crimes, not traffic violations.
I so wish that the protestors would just not show up while Trump‚Äôs troops are in town.  How stupid would they look standing around with no one else there.
Think about it: The one white man who has said a nice thing about Kamala in the media today has been Donald Fucking Trump.

For all those people that say trump isn‚Äôt apart of the globalist agenda this makes it seem like he is
As for "everyone hates trump" well relatively that's true.  60 million Americans love him. Like the cult members loved Jim Jones (although that didn't work out too well in the end). The rest of the world hates him. Bad ratio, IMO.
If current polling is an accurate Reflektor of trends in The Suburbs, Trump would probably be better off warning evangelicals that Democrats are coming for their Neon Bibles, though with Everything Now happening, he might be in for a Funeral this November regardless.
Asked about alleged bounties, Trump has Putin-friendly answers
Trump will pull 12,000 troops out of Germany and into Portland
We're 5 months into this pandemic and still seeing shortages of reagents, testing kits &amp; PPE.    and I are demanding President Trump use all of his resources‚Äîincluding the Defense Production Act‚Äîto get states the testing &amp; tracing resources we need.
You are right. Everyone knows Trump is a diehard racist. He is a fascist who stirs up hate and fear. Anyone who votes for Trump is a racist who supports fascism.
Donald Trump and demon semen is trending.
My best guess for next steps: 1. Poland will get more US forces as Germamy presence continues to dwindle (End of 2020) 2. Biden takes over and keeps minimal german base, and instead pulls out the forces elsewhere that was done during Trump's tenure 3. More special forces presence
Thank god Trump has rescinded the 2015 Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule! I thought some minorities might move into my neighborhood!

I mean if I were a Trump voter I'd be shy about it.  In context of MoE I realize that 2016 was not because of shy Trump voters but never hurts to have a good fear of them.  Might be shy Biden voters.  I live in one of most liberal cities in US and have only Biden sign I've seen.
Good news though all the people with experience in taking to the streets will be locked up under a Biden admin per his own words so when trump does refuse to concede there will be literally nobody but gormless liberals to get out there and stop him. Good luck fellas
I can‚Äôt wait for Trump to go to prison üòç
This is cute, but what of the four decades of neoconservatism, capitalist evangelicism, Gingrich, Southern Strategy, Palin, Iraq and Iran, the Tea Party, birthers, the systematic dismantling of the New Deal and blocking every social safety net?
I don't think that contradicts Stein.   Stein focused on developers specifically in terms of their role within municipal politics. Trump is talking to NIMBY homeowners because it is a national political statement he hopes will win with them (and which benefits developers anyway)
Biden‚Äôs team still struggling to come up with a more coherent message than ‚ÄúAnything Trump does is bad, even if we support it.‚Äù
Agreed, this isn't even close to over by the time Trump leaves office. It's not so much the country that needs to learn a lesson as the conservatives/Republican Party, which has gone all-in on Trump dictatorship. 52 totally silent witnesses to his rampage, they all have to go.
I can't imagine it's much different than Trump's overall approval. Trump approval transcends even party identification in driving perception on most things right now - another symptom of a cult. They look to the All Father to tell them what to believe.
Last poll that asked the question found that people who trust Biden over Trump on covid are voting Biden on a 96/2 margin. He can roll back Obama orders all day but his numbers won't budge until he can convince people he's handling the pandemic well, and he can't seem to do that.
This is playing directly to NIMBY and I'm sure they're eating it up. But I suspect that this move, like most of the actions taken by Trump over the last 3.5 years, is already playing to the base and alienating everyone else. It's divide-and-fail politics.

Trump is the worst leader our country has ever had! #NotMyPresident #TrumpFailsAmerica #TrumpIsNotWell
The Trump/Barr use of "anarchists" and "rioters" is now their way of describing our 1st Amendment right to protest or government. Too many are accepting this idea, and not just cultists.
Apparently someone managed to get it through to Trump that he's completely lost the suburbs and he can't win without them.
Trump gets lots of goodies, the American people get shafted in McConnell's COVID-19 'relief' bill
This is what serving #Putin looks like. Trump is either too stupid to realize that the US stationed these troops in Germany for its own protection and / or he's still got hurt feelings from Merkel not going to his G7 grift event. Regardless the US is NOT safer by this.  #Russia
It's almost like Trump is Putin's little bitch. Oh wait, that's exactly what he is.
Oh my goodness, this is the real Trump account, isn't it?

It seems useful to stratify on whether they voted in 2016, and if so, who for.  Over representing republican voters might signify a well meaning (but failed!) attempt to weight/over-sample to get the missing trump voters. Seems more straightforward to ask how people voted in 2016

Yes.  It‚Äôs just that I had noticed there are some states where Trump is still winning seniors, so have been less confident that Biden‚Äôs natl edge w/all seniors is solid.  I do think it makes sense that seniors in hard-hit states like AZ &amp; FL are abandoning Trump.
Anti Trump!!  Stop the testing!  MAGA!
Agree on that subsample.  There have been a few battleground state polls that still have Trump winning seniors (but not FL).
How much of this is abt $?  Is Trump‚Äôs big dollar fundraising drying up?
But how good are those figures? Manyüá∫üá∏states are intentionally fudging data to please Trump, who  says is more like an African dictator, so some African nations must have the same problem. How sure are you that numbers from rural &amp; remote areas are reasonably accurate?

So is  being divisive &amp; political, basically trump bashing part of this Christian forgiveness?
Even Lindsay Graham, one of Trump's biggest butt puppets, told reporters that he thinks this is a bad idea.
At least this one has the benefit that it would require an awful lot of election officials and clerks and whatnot all across the country playing along, compared to just like not punishing Trump Co. for money laundering or whatever
What is Trump's intent with a loyal militia in military outfits, nearly 10,000 in number? Protests witnessed these "soldiers" violate the constitutional &amp; international rights of citizens and torture them in plane view of others. Are they even authorized by Congress, as legit?
For people who are comfortable with grocery shopping, etc., I'd also suggest early voting or if you get an absentee ballot, dropping it off to a drop box. trump really is sabotaging the system to delay the results.
"...hours before Trump complained about mail ballots in Michigan, the GOP‚Äôs regional field director advertised...  ‚ÄúMail in Ballot Deadline is Coming! Make sure you apply by May 26th at  so you can vote by mail for [trump]!‚Äù
Takes an act of Congress to cancel/delay the election. If for some reason it is delayed a Trump still has to be out at 12:01 on Jan 20th and Pelosi becomes Prez until a new election is held. The only way Trump stays is if he‚Äôs voted in.
