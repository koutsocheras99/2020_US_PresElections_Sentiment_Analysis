Vote for Trump than Biden. U r racist old man. The dems luv Chao don't care about the rioters, lies &amp; committing treason w/u help. U let biden when on his merit not u lying for him.
This is the funniest thing I've read today. Just hope biden isn't in assisted living b4 the election.
Fact -  does not have the support he needs to win, and won't get it.  Fact - Biden and the Dem party will NOT move towards progressive policies. They have stated they will not.  Fact - Voting for EITHER Biden or Trump will give further legitimacy to our corrupt system.
As much as I despise Trump, I simply won't support Biden, just as I could not support HRC in 2016.
No, most of us aren't going to vote Biden. Where the fuck have you been?
we are all going to be living in a hell if pedo sex assaulter hair sniffer biden gets in
Can we make Trump v Biden debates pay per view? Donate proceeds to Covid relief!
Can we make Trump v Biden debates a pay per view? Donate all the proceeds to Covid relief efforts!
I thought it was sort of treacherous of Dodd to say that Biden requires loyalty to him. Excuse me Mr. Dodd Kamala Harris is loyal to the US Constitution first and if you're not get away from the presumptive Democratic nominee.
i seen some starting to say #wwjd and that's probably not a bad strategy. a lot of holiness minded people do not want to vote for biden.  you making it hard on us. it's effective with a niche population, ain't it?
joe biden's climate change plan is suicide anyways. i want him to pick kamala harris or i probably won't in the president's race. i don't like biden or trump but i hate mitch mcconnell.
yep. i'm really mad at chris dodd for saying kamala harris was ambitious like that old fogey wasn't. so offensive. i don't like him. never did. peeps like him make me cringe at the democrats. dementia joe taking things for granted.
This is the reality of American politics. If Trump doesn’t win he will claim fraud. If Biden doesn’t win he will claim fraud. Either way, America loses.
Kamala Harris will check Biden the whole way. I love Kamala Harris I have to tolerate Biden.  You know he's just to much of a bank Democrat for me but these are unusual times and even Senator Harris says that everyone is on deck to defeat Trump.
trump supporters are starting to approach my social media again, unless they post or directly say something racist i'm not gonna block any of them.  i'll tell them what they told me, i proved it though, see if you do, i survived trump so far you'll survive biden. gonna make it.
Ah, John, You'll be fine. Everyone loses every once in a while. It was a hard 4 years for me. I'm sure you're not rich enough for it to matter about Biden being President and even if you are I don't care. :)
Dem lunatic Biden gets slammed Biden questions whether coronavirus vaccine will be 'real,' despite experts' assurances
Racist ex president Obama slammed..  Levin bashes Obama eulogy for John Lewis, calls Biden 'a quasi-Bull Connor and a quasi-George Wallace'
Democrat communists can lie along with jinpings best friend Joe biden but Americans know the truth...  Americans blame China for its role in the spread of coronavirus, survey finds
Please Vice President Biden send a stronger message to the nation we need democracy And leader ship we do not need tyranny and suppression
He's the only pres. to give over double to negro universities to help them. I wish u &amp; other media to step back &amp; really be honest about everything Trump has done good &amp; biden has said
If that's the case, he should finish his work on time like the rest of his Republican classmates.   A perfectly capable genius that can memorize his cognitive words should be able to rig an election by the deadline. You don't hear Joe Biden asking for extensions.
What an idiot.  Joe Biden was right, again.
You’re right man. Americans do need to focus on winning this election. If Biden wins we truly are screwed.
That's true,  but I think it's a younger generation issue, alot of people get their news from memes,  so if they read it they won't fact check it.   My parents and grandparents don't use social media and LOVE Biden.
So, a man who has voted by mail in for the last 4 elections says it’s fraud??? Imagine being so scared of losing that you want to postpone the election indefinitely. It’s insane that out of so many people in this country our options were Trump/Hillary and now they’re Trump/Biden.
He was the only one who closed travel , Fauci and Berks said not too, Joe Biden and World Heath and Nancy called him xenophobic Nancy even out out a bill to force  to reopen travel wow ! NY and NJ gov did stupid, that killed thousands
I believe Joe Biden has dementia and is currently HEAVILY MEDICATED. PS He admitted the other day when he took questions that he had not been tested for Covid.
I'm voting for Joe Biden but Europe should defend itself.  Europe has a long history of being anti migrant anyways.
FACT: ANYONE VOTING FOR DEMENTIA JOE BIDEN IS ACTUALLY VOTING FOR HIS V.P PICK TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT. BIDEN WILL BE IN THE OVAL OFFICE LESS THAN SIX MONTHS BEFORE BEING FOUND UNFIT AND THAT WILL MOVE THE V.P TO PRESIDENT.
Mre than biden will.
And that is Biden's fault, for being a shit candidate and being just as corrupt as Trump. Biden is part of the same problem and will NOT help the people. He's already said himself that things won't fundamentally change if he were pres.  Go fly a kite with your vote shaming crap.
Again, since you can't seem to understand, Biden's loss will be HIS failure. This is 2016 all over again. Dems are losing and seeking to blame people who won't support their shit candidate before the election is even over. Take your vote shaming somewhere else.
Do not be fooled. Biden will never be your president. He is a puppet for the Democrats. Someone else will be pulling his strings.   Biden is the Democrats yes man...
CNN and Joe Biden confirm that ...
Biden and the Dem Party are no better than Trump and the Repubs. They simply hide it better with pretty words and empty promises that they spout to lure people in that are naive enough to believe them.   He is JUST as corrupt.   He IS the same.  The choice is fascism and fascism.
Biden was elected into the Senate in 1972!! Been in Washington ever since. What exactly do Democrats think he will do for them that he hasn't already had YEARS to do...he is a career politician with nothing to show for it!
Yes. We will pay for it even IF Biden were elected. He is no different than the rest we have in office right now.  Corrupt, only interested in his own benefit. He will be more of the same. If you think otherwise, then he's certainly fooled you.
I think it's really important for Joe Biden to understand though I am going to vote for him, I am not on his side and Joe Biden will not be the first person I seek information from. I welcome the transition away from corporate Democrats &amp; 4 years is to long to stomach, no choice.
And I'll support Kamala Harris and challenging Joe Biden the whole way if necessary, Biden concerns me for being a Republican. Already long term strategy minds are thinking of how to check him. I appreciate Biden moving left but I already am planning to challenge his policy. ATW
Again, no it won't. Holding to my principles and refusing to support more of the same corruption that PUT us in our current shitty state is the only way we can eventually dig our way out.  Biden's inevitable loss will be on HIM.
Which, Biden may not pick Kamala Harris, I'm growing to accept that, the cult of Biden fears Kamala Harris the future of America. Maybe that's justifiable. If I fall near a cult it's the cult of Kamala. I love her so much! Kamala Harris America's senator! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
Trump Pulls Ads In Michigan  Must be preparing to spend it all on Texas.   Biden guy said 22 media markets in Texas. True. Probably get some Democrat money but like a lot us you know you have to do it for yourself and if you don't, like Nancy says, elections have consequences.
Portland mayor a biden lookalike
I think I generally agree with that sentiment. And yeah Golden having an incumbency advantage is good, that’s flipped on Biden. Right now Golden of course has way more money but who knows how much the GOP will focus on this seat, they might view the House as too far gone
Oh yeah 100%. I still think that he’ll do better than Biden in the 2nd but idk why based off of this poll at least
But it’s certainly possible, considering that while Golden is ahead of Crafts on net by more than Biden is beating Trump, Golden and Biden both have 45% in Maine’s 2nd. But it’s certainly possible that Biden wins
So based off of this poll, it goes Golden-&gt;Biden-&gt;Gideon in terms of who’s likeliest to win Maine’s 2nd (of course these numbers could change, there are also a good amount of undecideds rn) Considering that Golden’s seat is rated a tossup by Cook, doesn’t seem good for Biden rn
From Maine’s 2nd Congressional District: -Biden leads Trump by 3 (45-42)! -Collins leads Gideon by 4 (44-40)- I know only statewide matters I just found this interesting
Are you too a groping weirdo like your candidate Biden
Cool things from the new Colby College poll of Maine: -Trump has a net -20 favorability rating (39-59) -Biden leads Trump by 12 (50-38) -Golden leads Crafts by 12 (45-33) -Gideon leads Collins by 5 (44-39) All of this means that there's a lot of work to be done for Dems to win
Is it crazy that I have started mapping out 2024 presidential election? I see Ohio being red then also, because I don’t see Biden running a second term, and instead someone like Harris getting the nomination, esp if she is VP pick 😂
No, nothing makes Biden look strong.
Correct, Biden is a hollow man that a rapidly evolving Marxist Movement is hiding behind.
You do realize living in the WH doesn’t make you president? Biden can take the oath and live wherever he wants until the orange ass leaves!
No, I'm not sitting it out, just refusing to support either Biden or Trump.
Good for you. Just remember when Biden loses it will be because HE failed to earn enough support. Biden's failure. Not ours.
Which Biden will NOT do, and neither will the DNC. They have made that clear.
Sure. However, that's Biden's failure, not ours. If you want to blame those not voting Biden, you have no understanding on how running for office is supposed to work.
Joe Biden taking soft ball,pre-rehearsed question...reading a teleprompter
Not good enough. Biden is just as bad as Trump, as the Dems are no different in their corruption than Repubs. Electing  won't make a goddamn difference for the people.
I am from Ohio,a battleground state (though it's trending red) and I always see tons of Trump signs. No one is excited for Biden.
So, Biden doesn't seem to doing anything, so basically, Trump wins huh?
Biden is not making the choice. He is just along for the ride.
No. Karen Bass is not the one  Elizabeth Warren Kamala Harris Susan Rice  These should be the short list of who Biden should be looking at for VP. #Biden2020
He’s been running for over a year, he’s done plenty of interviews. He went through multiple debates. Right now he’s going to lay low and let Trump keep destroying himself. He’s at a record low approval and Biden is up in every swing state.
All the other Democratic candidates aren’t going to drop out if Joe Biden can’t point out a picture of a fucking elephant. They want the job too. you’re literally voting for someone who used a sharpie to draw a fake hurricane path and you scream fake news.
Say what you want about Joe Biden, but he’s not the one out bragging about passing a fucking dementia test. Boasting about how he pointed out a picture of an elephant like he just discovered electricity.  Man. Woman. Person. Camera. TV.    🤣
There's no advantage for Joe Biden to stand on the same stage as Donald Trump. None. I can think of no reason for Biden to step into what is Donald Trump's wheelhouse, television.  #TrumpIsALoser
This doesn’t really matter because there isn’t any silencers all the democrat ticket or mainstream Democrats in the house who are for defunding the police. Certainly Joe Biden isn’t for defunding but for reform. What has Trump done about it besides sow hate, division and discord?
I do understand the difference between them. If you don't understand why people like me can't support either one by now, you're not going to. You're too full of yourself and unable to see anyone else's point of view.  When Biden loses, it will be his failure, not mine.
I AM an informed voter. That's why I'll never support Trump OR Biden. Great job in assuming someone with a different opinion than you is ignorant.   What arrogance...nice.
Biden Tax Plan Targets Profitable Companies That Pay Almost Nothing - WSJ
And in a relationship between a president and vice president, I like that Kamala Harris called it like she saw it. Does Biden intend to be like Trump and only surround himself with yes men. I hate to say it if that's the case maybe Biden should take a cognitive test.
obviously whoever the donor it was that dodd spoke to about kamala harris and you'd think dodd would know in specifity who it is, they should be able to donate via act blue, and should, but maybe limit candidate exposure. i think they hurt biden here on this one. pts coming off.
if it actually makes any difference w/ selection process maybe it shows Biden is small or surrounded by small minded people. &amp; that could be problematic on a debate stage w/ Trump. Leaking is bad. This is not good for the party. If it came from Dodd. BOO!

RIDIN' WITH BIDEN
Don’t see the issue with this one. Makes Biden appear to be not willing to take tough questions. It’s campaign season
Wake up people!  if Biden is not available for an interview during a campaign this is indicitive of his availability after an election. President Trump is always available to the people. Biden and his handlers will not have the best interest of the American people in mind.
nationalist government control many capitals.  anybody thinks that biden, mcgrath, owensby is gonna just magically make everything better once they're elected this november is surely mistaken. the world is crumbling around us and began with a failure of leadership by Republicans.
Joe Biden was not my number one pick for the Democratic nomination, not even in my top 5, but I will be so excited when Biden assumes office and can work with a Democratic Congress to turn this around. I know it's bad! So bad.

And November is a long way off. Don’t let up, we have to vote like polls show Biden &amp; trump in a head to head race. WE NEED HUGE VOTER TURNOUT. #AmericaStrongerWithBiden

To all Americans,  was our nation. Is our nation,  which is better from 1 yr ago till right now. If said 1yr. Ago was better then plz don't vote for biden. Look it up about joe &amp; what he's taking away or his words. He wants cops taken away, agrees on rioters destroying &amp; killing
Noooo, I don’t want Trump, Biden or Ye.
So Obama would probably be President again, if Biden were elected!
Obama wants Biden to get the gang back together if he wins....
I think he'll do much better than Trump.  It's the welfare I don't like about Biden.
biden has decades and decades of federal experience. i don't really buy that it is a big deal. most of them are ok. i just like kamala harris cause of her politics but also her story. most interesting.
i mean all anyone really do is loudly or silently complain whatever suits ya. i'm voting for biden but i really hope it's with kamala harris. being held hostage sucks. just another biden hostage.
Fully understand but let’s all do what we can do to get rid of Trump ! Phone calls, post cards, and vote. I have elderly neighbors who are confused by rhetoric. I print Joe’s agenda out in big print and say this is why you should vote Biden. 💙

Just might be the perfect storm for that, so long as no one gets complacent just because "the polls show Biden winning." No repeats of Clinton + Trump doing what Trump does, and we very well could see both houses in the blue...
We really aren't safe in Donald Trump's America. I'm willing to try Joe Biden's America out for a bit.

150k dead Americans, economy in complete shambles, opponent he has no idea how to attack and that is fairly popular? I still like Biden’s chances 😆
A vote for Biden, is a vote against Christ. Trump isn’t perfect but at least he isn’t bullying Catholics 24/7 like Biden is. The worse part is Biden is Catholic. #Trump2020
I literally was shopping for the settle for Biden t shirt today lol
And just because I’m pointing out folks on the right crying about everything does not mean I was an Obama fan, or even a Biden fan.  Too quick to label and choose sides.  There is no escaping the the fact that Trump is a clown who is doing nothing except worrying about his image

Eh, I’m black and when I saw Biden say that back then, at no point did I think mitt Romney was going to be enslaving me. And I don’t think any other black people did either.
Yeah, Biden’s a gaffe machine. Although, back then Romney was leaning heavy into the white identity politics. Not to donald trump levels, but he was. But at this point we all know that isn’t really him. It’s why he’s not really popular amongst the Republican base.

You would make a outstanding Secretary of Defense  in a Biden Administration.
That’s not the point. The point is that Biden took arrows for Barack Obama, and he is looking for someone willing to do the same for him, their own ambitions be damned. Biden’s aides are arguing Harris won’t.

Of course, that ruling will go in the opposite direction once Biden is in the WH and the Dems control the Senate as well as the House.
And the difference between you and most Republicans madam is this. We think for ourselves... msm doesn’t tell us what to do or say.. and the big one.. we don’t worship anyone but God. But we do support the president. There’s a difference madam. You worship Biden? 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
And Arthur... let’s talk about hunter and the favors his politician Dad called in for him mostly from China.. how many millions have the Biden’s made off that one. But yeah. Your right ingerity and morals and all.. and Arthur.. stop judging those you don’t know.
Again you have nothing but your personal opinion. Yet if you vote for Biden your voting for a man who according to your standards is of high moral character right?
Obama/Biden BUT hopefully CLINTONS
You’re right.  Kids shouldn’t wear maga hats.  They should just go tickle joe Biden’s leg hair in the pool
Polls show Biden in comfortable lead so trump followers are in minority which begs to question if masks work, because with this many cases it can’t be a minority spreading at these rates
Obama /Biden
Do y’all think Biden knows that people are only voting for him because he’s not Trump? Or do you think he legit thinks he’s popular and a good candidate?
First of all, the fact Trump took a cognitive test is stunning. That means they felt like they had to test him. Second, Trump proves his mental illness through his narcissistic braggadocio. Third, Biden saying million instead of thousand does not compare to Trump’s incoherency.
Maybe. I got the feeling he's in on it. That lady the supplied young girls for Epstein he said he wishes her the best of luck. Can no longer trust him. I think we're screwed if we get him or Biden.
There’s a difference between throwing a ball at 80 and being there mentally.   Biden doesn’t sit there and brag about being able to spot an elephant on a piece of paper.
Funny I can’t find one person willing to vote for Biden. These polls taken in downtown NYC.
Nothing in that article supports the idea that Biden wants market forces to work.
Hahaha This suburban woman knows you are a joke as President and can wait to see President Biden replace you!
Shocking. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver Makes Maximum Donation to Biden Campaign  via
No he won't! Vote BLUE to take our country back! Biden 2020 and I'm mailing it in!
It is not working  Your delusional comments that this would be Biden's America, you seem to forget who sent them there.  This is backfiring on your campaign BIG TIME!
The first debate should be  and Biden taking this test live on television. First try for Biden, second for Trump.
