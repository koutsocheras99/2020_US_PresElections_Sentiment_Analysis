Denounce Trump now on any attempt to delay the election
But you're saying that state law allows absentee voting, and the ballots are collected according to state law, and the state legislature sees a lead for Trump and shuts down not a recount but a *count* of hundreds of thousands of legally submitted ballots.
It's even more critical you denounce loudly that Trump and Barr can not delay the 2020 Elections.
You gonna hold Trump responsible for the spread in the US? Or for stripping the CDC‚Äôs capabilities of monitoring emerging diseases IN WUHAN?!? If not, then save your empty gestures for people as gullible as you.
Why don‚Äôt you leave the cheering of whistleblowers to people who actually appreciate them? You gave up on protecting whistleblowers and IGs when Trump took office.
Yea I am voting in person early in Iowa. I don‚Äôt trust Trump, he will do anything to win.

How is Trump's mouthpiece doing today?  Standing for an anthem is not patriotism, just ask Hitler.  Shit I ask the waiter to sing the national anthem every time I go to a restaurant.
It's even more awkward in hockey. Watching a bunch of Russians, euros, Americans, and Canadians fake reverence for not their countries anthem is painful. Also, the Trump Jr thing tonight :(
No one wants to come into US with raging pandemic. 155,000 already died due to failure to lead. Our economy is in deep recession, GDP just dropped 33%. US debt up 6.5 TRILLION since you took office.  And everything Trump does leads back to Putin. you're FIRED!

The presidential election is not the only choice on the ballot. State legislative elections are being held in these states. When it comes down to it, will these folks undermine their own re-election campaigns for Donald Trump?
Trump has become so anti-democratic and authoritarian that I‚Äôd take nearly anyone over him at this point, and that includes Biden.

BBC News - Donald Trump suggests delay to 2020 US presidential election
Importantly, this change happens BEFORE the inauguration of the new President. Which means a new President Pro Tempore is in place before Trump's term expires.   Assuming the Democrats follow precedent (they wouldn't) they would elect the most senior member of their caucus.
Trump's term ends whether there is an election or not. Thus, the 25th amendment is clear as to the order of succession. Next up is the VP - but oh wait, his term is over too.   Next up is the Speaker of the House - hooray, President Pelosi!!
Folks, I hate to break it to you, but if Trump somehow manages to move the election (he can't, but the hypothetical is fun), we won't get President Pelosi.   BUT, we will get a respected Democrat as President. Allow me to explain. (THREAD)

Let‚Äôs use logic. He contracted covid after attending the trump rally in Tulsa at which masks were not required. He then died from covid related complications. Cain was responsible for not wearing a mask obviously. But this could have been easily prevented by masks or no rally.

,,,  Thank You Father God, for giving us Donald Trump for Our 1st. Pro-life President, to see why you want to spue  America out of Your mouth; to overcome the Abomination of the Obama Nation, with same-sex marriage, and  prayer for Planned Parenthood
Lol, pretty much every liberal would take Bush over Trump in a heartbeat. I disagreed with a great deal of Bushs policies but he at least brought some dignity to the position, and respected his opponents and his country.
You call it ‚ÄúA Trump‚Äù
Louis didn‚Äôt attend George Bush‚Äôs inauguration either. Bush still showed up and spoke at his funeral. Somethings are bigger than politics, Trump absolutely to his core doesn‚Äôt believe that.
You hooked your self to a real career ending grifter. You will be noted as a failure along with Trump in History books
Fuck that
See, work is different than a rally. You have to go to work. They made you sign it because it‚Äôs a job. You are comparing a Trump rally to a job? What? I‚Äôm holding a big party that I know is dangerous, so sign a waiver at the door. That doesn‚Äôt equal employment
If only Trump didn‚Äôt order those COVID patients to go into nursing homes and killed all those old people.  Shit..that was the governor of NY, NJ, PA, and MI.  My bad.
In the coming weeks and months, Republicans may try to DISTANCE themselves from Donald Trump. But please remember this:  Public statements of Trump disapproval DON'T matter if you still wholeheartedly enable Trump's agenda.   And  does this in SPADES. üëç
So Trump praises that we are testing more than anyone in the world but a couple weeks ago he wanted to stop testing? What would he have to praise about us if we didn't have all that testing?
Travel ban not enough!  Trump is responsible for over 150,000 deaths!!!
Trump did not do enough!  Travel limits were NOT ENOUGH!!  Trump insisted opening to early! Trump needed to follow the experts advise!  Trump needed to tell his base to wear masks!
QUIT GETTING DISTRACTED! Why is it so hard for the media to recognize when Trump is playing you and distracting you from MUCH more important issues? Worst GDP drop, Cain dies from C-19 after attending Tulsa rally, so trump fires off an election tweet and everyone goes nuts
Why did Trump have him sign a waiver to attend the rally?
Stop giving trump press. He can not change the election date. Only congress can and they are not going to.
No doy.  Now tell that Trump person you support.
jokingly trump messed up. But this is awful with 33% drop because of such mismanagment
you have to wonder... he didn't wear a mask and he was at a trump rally
Let's talk about Trump's call to suspend the elections....  via  Every #Tyrant before they are called a #Dictator they will do this #SuspendTheElection  #Trump
Then why did Trump make him sign a waiver to attend a rally ? A Covid waiver ?
So Trump is defunding the police?! üòâ
WATCH -- Herman Cain was an outspoken backer of the president and was named by the campaign as a co-chair of Black Voices for Trump. Cain posted a photo to his Twitter account from the rally. He was not wearing a mask and not social distancing in the crowd of thousands.
Thank you, President Trump, sir.  As you said before your election, we will win so much we will get sick of winning.  You were right, because I'm absolutely sick of it all!!

Trump is supposed to be a billionaire!  He doesn't need to raise money!  Maybe his kids and their families need higher pay to "campaign"?
How many deaths are to many for Trump?  When will he try to do something about the spread?
Trump is responsible for over 150,000 dead Americans and doesn't care! Trump does nothing about controlling the spread of the virus!!
What if Trump is trolling us this whole time and then when he‚Äôs out he says ‚Äúsee, politics is a joke‚Äù
No, the following day would be okay.  As long as Trump doesn't rig the voting process!!!
Don‚Äôt forget Mr. Constitutionalist  who is usually too busy giving us folksy lectures on what‚Äôs wrong with today‚Äôs youth, and occasionally trump, without actually putting any weight behind his words. #Nebraska deserves better than this ineffectual hypocrite.
Can you do tweets for the other 151, 569 Americans who have died from COVID-19?  Here's a reminder, Don.  The CDC issued its first warning on 1/8.  Trump held campaign rallies on 1/9, 1/14, 1/28, 1/30, 2/10, 2/19, 2/20, 2/21, and 2/28.
Are you related to former Rep. Doug Bereuter? I‚Äôve been a registered Democrat since I was 18, but crossed party lines to vote for him a number of times when I lived in Lincoln. I can‚Äôt believe he would get in line to lick Trump‚Äôs boots the way Bacon does.

Imagine the media's reaction if Trump (or any Republican) turned a funeral into a campaign speech?
Trump only cares about himself. Trump has no empathy for the dead!!!
Is Trump still calling Covid 19 virus a HOAX???   Trump doesn't care about 150,000 dead Americans!  Trump is busy golfing and trying to rig the election!  Trump is busy following orders from Putin!!
There will be no delay in the 2020 election. John Cornyn says Donald Trump was joking. Ha, Ha. Get it?
Dr. Fauci is trusted and loved. Trump is hated and despised.
‚ÄúAccept last election‚Äù?  Such a tired retort.  Don‚Äôt be mad because sane people call out trump‚Äôs every attempt to undermine our democracy.  Frankly, assuming your a US citizen you should be unhappy with his unethical behavior.
Trump‚Äôs prediction of a V shaped economic recovery is as false as his previous predictions that Coronavirus was under control and would magically disappear and his claims of approval by 96% of Republicans.
Only the Trump cult cares. The rest of us just watched the REAL President in action.
This is a great idea to have all the trump supporters refuse to vote on November 3rd. Protest the Election Day.
The silent majority you folks keep trying to push does not exist. Trump lost the popular vote to Hillary by almost 3 million votes. Do you understand what ‚Äúmajority‚Äù means? The country is far worse off then it was 4 years ago. Please keep pretending everything is great.
.  Herman Cain before the Trump Tulsa rally.
Because the timing fits as well as Trump campaign staffers were tested positive for the virus and kept working the rally. Of course it could have come from anywhere though.
So you are separating yourself now from Trump. I don‚Äôt believe it. You voted not to impeach this nut and now we are suffering from the chaos of his ineptitude!
Let him move it to May of 2021. On January 20th President Nancy P will arrest former president trump, get ahold of his taxes, confiscate all his properties, and jail his whole family. Then  on the 21st , even more.
Got it at a Trump rally. Freedom!!

Then why is Trump talking about it today ? You people
I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs making it clear today. Unbelievable foresight from Biden. Trump blasted him for suggesting a change to the convention and look what Trump did? Now this. You better apologize to Biden
Lol. I know the day our society has finally advanced will be the day we finally stop reacting to things Trump says and instead look for the hidden motive. I fall for this myself. He really isn‚Äôt stupid.
Heck even Bush sounds eloquent compared to Trump.

Um Hasn't Trump done the same thing? Asking foe a friend
Do we need any further evidence that Trump is crapping himself daily. He is flailing uncontrollably.
We need you to lead on this. Trump didn't accept the results of an election he won! He will no doubt use every apparatus his office grants to distort the result this time.  You need to speak, on the floor of the house, on NET, KETV, CNN, Fox, whoever will put you on camera.

Hilarious! He should do stand up instead of be President. Trump the election clown. And the press falls for it every time.
Are you actually going to stand up to Trump if he tries to push this idea? I will you follow in line like you have every other time you've said you disagreed with something he did then did nothing but tweet about it?
Trump is president Republicans control the senate, trumps whole cabinet is hand picked so how are Democrat‚Äôs destroying anything? Everything going on is under his watch.
Trump is advocating bringing back racial and economic Red Lining to prevent people of color from acquiring homes in the suburbs. Blatant racism.

What is Cornyn going to say when Trump will be asked about it later and he doubles and triples down.....  still kidding just to get a reaction?
If President Trump is going to delay the election he will need to get much of the U.S. military and the majority of police on board. It may work but a lot of blood will have to be spilled.
What I don‚Äôt understand is how it‚Äôs so easy for trump supporters to know what news is fake and what news is real. According to him all news is fake just believe him. Everyone close to him ended up a convicted felon. That‚Äôs not fake news that‚Äôs a fact.
The President made Herman sign a waiver for attending a rally because the President knew how dangerous it was. The President convinced ignorant people, like Cain, not to wear a mask. Trump jr is still saying they are overrated. The POTUS politicized masks for so long.

Yeah. I guess the thing for me is: Trump has been denouncing vote by mail for months now. That's not new. The new thing is him raising the threat of delaying the election. That requires a response.
Elections are safe. You can vote by mail and not even leave your house.   Trump is scared because he knows he about to lose
Yes, the Trump administration lied and made this worse. I‚Äôve been listening to experts since the beginning and have heard how wearing a mask reduces the spread.
It's true that Trump makes most intelligent people go, "Jesus Christ," every time he talks.Denounce Trump now on any attempt to delay the election
But you're saying that state law allows absentee voting, and the ballots are collected according to state law, and the state legislature sees a lead for Trump and shuts down not a recount but a *count* of hundreds of thousands of legally submitted ballots.
It's even more critical you denounce loudly that Trump and Barr can not delay the 2020 Elections.
You gonna hold Trump responsible for the spread in the US? Or for stripping the CDC‚Äôs capabilities of monitoring emerging diseases IN WUHAN?!? If not, then save your empty gestures for people as gullible as you.

No one wants to come into US with raging pandemic. 155,000 already died due to failure to lead. Our economy is in deep recession, GDP just dropped 33%. US debt up 6.5 TRILLION since you took office.  And everything Trump does leads back to Putin. you're FIRED!

"Trump can't delay the election." Who the fuck's gonna stop him?  The Republican Senate?  His loaded Supreme Court?  Trump can't do a lot of things that he's done, the GOP doesn't have the balls to do a damn thing about it.  They're not gonna suddenly stop being spineless.
Impeach Barr NOW!! He gave enough info during his testimony to do it. If you don't, Trump will get him to delay the election, which will turn into canceling it.
we must vote Trump otherwise big tech will control our lives. What‚Äôs that platform I need to leave a five star review on?
Trump bashes the defund the police but actually defunds them by not paying them
Donald Trump is not doing his job. He lies, downplays, and denies the virus and efforts to control it. It's killing people. He must do his job and address it or be removed from office. How many have to die to get #GOP to do their jobs?
you‚Äôre almost guaranteed to be fired come Nov. if you do not stand up to Trump and his floating the idea of moving the election.
"Not answering any questions," said Sen. Joni Ernst, an Iowa Republican also facing voters in a tough race, when asked about Trump's tweet."  can't even take a stand on the election date which is set by Congress with authority granted by the  Constitution.
Kim Reynolds presser Hawkeye Football presser Trump being Trump Herman Cain dies of COVID  yikes....sure there will be plenty of reasonable thoughts on all of these
Bingo!!! üëç Some people don't have the ability to think logically... They legitimately think hot dogs &amp; pizza are code words for people‚Äôs private parts. It is so easy to see why so many people are misinformed &amp; why the world is how it is right now. Trump ‚Äúloves the uneducated.‚Äù
I try to be civil and respectful of differences. But with Trump floating the idea of "postponing" the election I'm feeling we are bringing a water pistol to a knife fight. Is there any room for treating him and his followers with civility and respect?
I would like President Trump to define the differences between absentee voting and universal mail in voting.
What part of "Labor Day is too late" does   not understand? People are dying. Every day they do nothing about Trump, more people die. This is on Trump &amp; the Republican congress as well because they refuse to do their jobs and stand up to him. #Incompetencekills
We‚Äôve got some huge morons in this state. I don‚Äôt trust them in the least. A bunch of trump ass suckers don‚Äôt take their words for anything.
Do you realize how dramatic and ridiculous you sound, blaming everything on Trump?  The rest of us know the truth.  He‚Äôs handled it well.  The left and MSM are hyping it for political gain.  And you fell for it, hook line and sinker Chicken Little.  The sky is not falling.
IA3. It was Trump +3 in 2016 and Cindy Axne won by 2 in 2018. So I guess Biden+ 2  but I am not an expert so maybe other people have a better idea.
Bush is responsible for the Patriot Act, DHS, and ICE which are all being weapons zed against us, as many of us said they would. Bush is responsible for arming Trump.

Glad we agree.  I don‚Äôt blame Trump for the Covid epidemic or the economy.  I blame Steve for promoting crap statistics and crap experts.  He just retweeted a claim of 7 DC deaths in 2 weeks.
Bush II at least had the sense to fade into the background and take up painting after he was done. If anything Trump will step on the gas, which will make taking him down popular.   The main danger is if Rs succeed in scapegoating Trump for everything.
Robin Vos says we shouldn't delay November election, breaking from President Donald Trump's suggestion.
I have to wonder how callous someone has to be in order to tweet something like this. You don't use someone's death to score political points. It's disgusting.   Not a Trump fan, but add this to the pile of reasons I regret voting for  in 2016.
My son will not be going in person...she can proclaim all she wants. She‚Äôs not a dictator. My wife is immunocompromised, my Dad is having heart surgery soon, and she still has no real plan, and keeps the districts in constant chaos. Iowans are not Trump‚Äôs test market.
Is an endorsement from Donald Trump something a business really wants? I would think that it would alienate a good portion of its potential customers.
"Well, you'd like to say that, and sometimes you do," added Trump. "The problem is that sometimes your own chemicals take over and you can't wait."
Trump‚Äôs not airing spots anywhere in the country right now.
THIS IS SEGREGATION! Promoting #NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) and attacking low income individuals is atrociously unacceptable. Affordable housing is a community responsibility and housing is a human right.

I know who this is and I don't care :D I was her boss on the Gerson campaign in Minnesota, and we have different views on how to treat disease. She has since gotten mad at me for attacking Trump, and it doesn't bother me in the least that she said this.
why don't you stand up and call it how it actually is. Donald J Trump is directly responsible for the death of this man. He was hospitalized about two weeks post that terrible Tulsa rally. How many more have to die, while you and your party continue to support a monster.
How can his supporters not see that he wants to be a dictator?? His ‚Äútrump 4ever‚Äù video tweet, saying we would delay the election, and when asked if he‚Äôd accept election results he said ‚Äúwe‚Äôll see‚Äù???
Then the question comes about why Trump thinks that voting in November will be so dangerous and OH

No one chooses death.  Like or not Trumps choatic response to this pandemic has resulted in a distrust of science resulting in more infections and death.  This time it's Mr Cain who did choosr to attend a rally and trusted Trump and paid the price.
BBC News - Donald Trump suggests delay to 2020 US presidential election
Importantly, this change happens BEFORE the inauguration of the new President. Which means a new President Pro Tempore is in place before Trump's term expires.   Assuming the Democrats follow precedent (they wouldn't) they would elect the most senior member of their caucus.
Trump's term ends whether there is an election or not. Thus, the 25th amendment is clear as to the order of succession. Next up is the VP - but oh wait, his term is over too.   Next up is the Speaker of the House - hooray, President Pelosi!!
Folks, I hate to break it to you, but if Trump somehow manages to move the election (he can't, but the hypothetical is fun), we won't get President Pelosi.   BUT, we will get a respected Democrat as President. Allow me to explain. (THREAD)

The 1st was a candidate for the house from AL, the 2nd was Trump's new celebrity MD with which he can hawk hydroxychloroquine (which he profits from), the 3rd was AG Bill Barr, yesterday, before a house hearing on his shitty fascist antics in Portland and the last one was Trump.
I move to delay the election and grant Chancellor Trump emergency powers, which he has pinky promised to give up once the Separatists have been defeated!

President Trump floats election 'delay' amid claims of voting fraud
President Trump mused about delaying this year's election on Thursday based on unsupported conspiracy theorizing about the integrity of voting during the coronavirus disaster.

trump is literally out here talking mad shit on absentee votes when also privately pushing them to republicans. make sure you vote this november.
President Trump floats election 'delay' amid claims of voting fraud
President Trump broached the subject of delaying the election in a tweet in which he complained about potential problems with mail-in voting, adding: "Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???"
Between Trump, the GOP &amp; all of his racist supporters, this is how I feel most days. üëáüèº
His name is Donald Trump
Great!  I'm on board for mail-in voting!  The only definite thing in this country these days is that whatever Trump says, the exact opposite is truth.  Trump is literally incapable of not lying.
Trump needn't worry, the virus will disappear like magic by then ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
The dates of federal elections are set by Congress, and the Constitution makes no provisions for a delay to the Jan. 20, 2021 presidential inauguration.
What if we just let Trump go ahead and tell his followers it‚Äôs been delayed? The rest of us can vote on Nov 3.
Did anyone think Trump WOULDN'T at some point suggest delaying the election?
President Donald Trump is for the first time floating a ‚Äúdelay‚Äù to November‚Äôs presidential election, as he makes unsubstantiated allegations that increased mail-in voting will result in fraud.
I am in a very ‚Äúfuck Trump‚Äù mood, so perfect timing on delivery.

Trump voters, he holds you in contempt. And I mean CONTEMPT. Have a listen:
Frontline Doctors are the most current. Do some investigating.  You might learn something. I am not saying it is  magical cure. But if Trump had said the opposite,  Joe would be pushing the drug.
Once again, Trump is using his playbook of segregation &amp; outright racist policies. It‚Äôs not a crime to be low income. This policy is a continuation of keeping the poor down &amp; ensuring that there is not enough affordable housing in our communities.
The right side of Trump's face has collapsed.  Along with the speech issues and dragging his right foot all the time, I've gotta go with: He's had a stroke.
So  is lying as much as he claims Trump is lying by saying hydrocloroquin doesn't work and every medical expert says so. That is a lie because I've seen dozens of Drs say it works. #NBC #MorningJoe
It‚Äôs called the trump shuffle. Let‚Äôs see can‚Äôt lift a bottle of water can‚Äôt walk. Maybe a stroke? I‚Äôm not a Doctor you tell me.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Ok folks, Trump is trying everything that he can to undermine the postal service. Most likely to further suppress voters for this coming election, but also Republicans have been talking about privatizing the USPS for years. Time to take some action, and demand emergency funding!
Going from "Of course Hillary's going to win" to "Trump is going to cheat and stay in office even if he loses" is a slight change in tone.
Dems can't get a single thing passed, silly. McConnell blocks everything, even things his own party wants. If Trump didn't support it, McConnell said it won't move... He said he won't get the rug pulled out from under him again (the immigration bill from about a year ago)

That was from bipartisan work in the congress trump literally just signed it. You‚Äôre acting like Obama wouldn‚Äôt have taken the effort to sign that same  thing
No it‚Äôs an opinion you need facts to back it up üòÇ here‚Äôs a fact Obamacare got 1/3 more blacks on healthcare and trump is trying to completely get rid of it
You‚Äôre right Biden‚Äôs tough on crime bills were atrocious for black communities because lots of crimes that were victimless got the maximum sentencing but whites in America get far less time in jail for the same crimes why hasn‚Äôt trump tried reforming that?
You know what a trend is right? And you know the civil rights act was signed in 1964? That was one of the biggest things for blacks since slavery and the right to vote and it literally ended segregation youre literally quoting trump tweets üòÇ
It‚Äôs a new disease he was literally releasing stuff before it was even able to be tested. Fauci worked with the last 5 presidents including trump and has been bipartisan with all of them but trump literally hates anyone in the limelight but him
1. If you go to New York and ask people about trump they hate him there 2. Trump got taken to court twice on not renting to black people 3. The unemployment rate is at a huge low 4. The economy sucks and he is doing exactly what Obama did with his numbers
They should've ran a better candidate then. They didn't learn that lesson this time either but Trump's so bad people will vote for half a bowl of shit.
He literally inherited a good economy from Obama while Obama had the 2008 depression to work from. Plus he just grew the economic bubble by printing more money instead of using taxes. And that website says lowest unemployment rate for most minority groups but trump did nothing1/2
Yeah I do not to mention he doesn‚Äôt have millions of brainwashed followers like trump who can‚Äôt even acknowledged when he‚Äôs in the wrong and instead lies. Bunker boy only cares about himself and he knows he‚Äôs tanking, voter fraud has nothing to do with it

Don't forget to add that Mr. Cain caught COVID_19 while working for Trump in preparation for the rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Trump just had to pump his ego during a pandemic, failed, and people died.
A person doesn't need Trump to tell them anything. President Chickenshit just withdrew from Germany, and gave Europe to Putin.  He is a scared little boy trying to do a man's job.   #MAGA #VoteBlue2020

Actually we ARE able to vote in person, and WE WILL! Trump will have his ass handed to him and he knows it!

Who's wondering? Barr got what he deserved for being Trump's assistant and not Attorney General of the United States.

"Doesn't care?"  Wrong.  He's the only one of the two showing that he is concerned.  And before you say otherwise, no, Trump hasn't.  Why 6 months of a pandemic and 140,000 dead before he shows concern?
I believe the words "emolument clause" apply here as Trump has violated said clause 5000 ways from Sunday.
Exactly, I think life has meaning which is why I am part of the pro choice movement. I care about the pregnant persona life and i care about the lives of people who have been born. Well except hitler, trump, and the rest of that group.

Trump isn't doing shit.  He sits around spreading false lies during the week, and then goes golfing on OUR dime during the weekend.  He doesn't give a shit about you, me, or anyone.  He only gives a shit about one man: HIMSELF.    Cut the crap and wake up!
Trump is and always has been creepy af.

Ummm.... not sure how Gates and Fauci started this recession, in February.  If it's someone's plan... how is it failing?  Trump has literally sent private contractors into Portland to beat and gass- moms.
You know, speaking of Labor Day.... isn't that when the Republicans said they'd turn on Trump if he wasn't doing better?
You misspelled Trump there.
Think Trump pushes to put more of his troops into cities that they'll be recalled before the election?
Not, entirely true... Trump's Recession started in February of this year. Obama's Recovery ended then.

Mmmm.... it IS Trump's economy, now.
"Trump has ushered in an era of profound American weakness..." #TrumpsAmerica
I think.... that's his point.  Trump turned Obama's economy around- he inherited the longest period of sustained growth in history and in the period of 3 short years... turned it into a recession.
If, by "swing states" you mean FL, OH, TX, GA, IN... I can see it. If you mean PA, MI, WI, AZ, NV- not so much.  Trump, literally, killed GOP supporters across the United States, they're not coming back.

Per Pres Trump, 100 million doses of vaccine will be available by the end of the year.  If Luka comes back and Iowa has the season everybody thinks they can have, his status in this state will be legendary. When he's done playing BB, very lucrative jobs will be avail in Iowa.
Before we say Trump is like Hitler, I feel 100% sure that if COVID had hit the world in the 1930‚Äôs, Hitler would have mandated face masks and ordered a shutdown.   Trump is a fascist, but he‚Äôs a lazy fascist.
Because the media would defend those clowns and make a big deal about fascist tactics, while the leaders of the cities like Portland have made it clear that anything Trump does is not welcome. Insert dog sitting in burning building meme here. Everything is fine.
Yeah I dont get that guy. I also dont get trump either but thats a different story.

Don‚Äôt want Trump, don‚Äôt want Biden. So when do the British come back and tell us we‚Äôve been punk‚Äôd?
This is just  posturing to his MAGA traitors to overthrow the United States once he loses.    His term ends on January 20th 2021 at noon.  That is the Constitution.  He doesn't want the election delayed.  He wants to be absolute ruler of the Trump state.
So most of the morning  and  were talking about Trump tweet about delaying the election.  was on for 40 minutes when Sandra said breaking news from the President. Wow.
Mixed messages from Trump. He just tweeted a question about delaying the election.
Higher death rates hurt Trump.
The woman in that case has now been charged with murder. She just blamed Trump to cover it up.
I agreed with Trump‚Äôs decision, but man, he could‚Äôve had a better explanation for the reasons why. Just terrible communication. Yikes.
Dr King was a Republican and Trump has done more for black people than any President so I think they would get along famously.
Well let‚Äôs see. Barr covered up any prosecutions into the Iran/Contra deal. Now Trump is having Barr ignore information that was in the Mueller report. Barr is trying to have a report that will maybe boost Republicans support for Trump close to the election.
Bernie has never been good at power politics. He is an affable, caring guy that doesn't kill anyone. He wants to beat Trump more than anything, so he didn't kill anyone in the debates, and he doesn't use his supporters as leverage for policy concessions.

Ya, he also didn‚Äôt see Trump tweets of maybe Trump committing a potential felony. Great questioning by  It was like a drilling Brianna gives her guests.
Why? I actually haven‚Äôt watched it much. I knew that the Republicans would focus on Trump narrative ‚ÄúLaw &amp; Order‚Äù and focus on riots and maybe sprinkle in a little of Obama administration SpyGate.

Portland has been rioting for 4 months but it‚Äôs Trumps fault? If Biden was capable of restoring law and order, he would make a vey public denouncement. If the rioting stops, he can claim that he, not Trump, is the law and order candidate. But these people don‚Äôt respect either

It‚Äôs always interesting when she tweets things against the narrative of Trump narratives. Very very rare, but interesting.
George was on fuckin point!! The Dems are being exposed. The deep state Dems. Trump is exposing the government we all grew to despise through the years. Most of the elite in Hollywood and the mainstream media support the old rotten government!! Trump 2020!!
Twitter and Facebook become targets in Trump and Biden ads
You thought she would be upset at how the Trump administration handled the virus. Calling it a hoax. Not taking it serious enough soon enough. Even Trump own CDC said that closing travel to Europe was to late for NY. So Janice isn‚Äôt upset about that facts at all.
Florida is now having difficulty with employees infecting residents of nursing homes. Other states the nursing home residents were infected by the virus like Ohio. You blame Cuomo for Ohio. Seems Janice has zero blame for how the Trump administration handled the virus.
Here‚Äôs the thing. Unfortunately and sadly there are many schools ran by modern day Democrats or simply controlled by their local democratic government. Well. We all know they hate Pres Trump, and OUR President ‚ÄúDonny‚Äù wants our youth back in school. Same here! ....
Wow. Thank you President Trump. A true NON politician to help us.
Of course. National Security is always the trump card of tyrants...but they miscalculated..BIG TIME!

Am I wrong but didn‚Äôt he sign a Executive Order to lower prescription drug prices or did he just talk about it for years? Trump is signing a lot of Executive Orders lately.

So today  citied a poll at the White House Press briefing and saying parents want kids in schools. But polls also said Trump should be impeached. Polls say Trump is doing terrible job at handling the virus. So what polls are we believe
Random thoughts. If trump gets knocked off, will the republicans still hold ranks?
Too late the Senate and Trump are off for the weekend
She said this week that Trump is tested several times a day and everyday. Trump debunked that by saying he is tested sometimes every other day.

Trump made the mistake. Your argument of blaming someone else for their mistakes is actually what you are doing for Trump administration. Interesting how you are trying to switch the blame.
So if you are saying someone used a screwdriver from a toolbox and then gave you the toolbox you wouldn‚Äôt check to see if a screwdriver was in the toolbox? Seems a failure of whoever it was in the Trump administration to ask for funding to replenish the supply.
Trump had three years and had plenty of time to restock it.
The investigations were brought on by Majority or Republicans in House and Senate Committee‚Äôs and by Trump appointee Rosenstein that hired Mueller.
Trump still could do the job of the Presidency and be investigated. Nixon and Clinton did the work and were investigated and one was impeached, but not removed. Lame excuse.

Trump could‚Äôve replenished them. Trump had three years. Why didn‚Äôt Trump do it?
Trump had three years to replenish the supplies. Why didn‚Äôt Trump replenish them? You can‚Äôt blame Obama for failure of a doing that Trump had in three years of his administration.
You're a clown. The CDC pandemic plan that Biden and other Dems tout as being "in place" for Trump specifically says that masks CAN be encouraged but SHOULD NOT be required. It also says there is doubt that masks actually work. There is still that doubt today.
The only thing Trump likes is money and power. He don‚Äôt give a shit about our country.  He wrecked  this courtyard!!!!!

That's Trump's America.   America wouldn't be using the playbook from Nazi Germany and would respect Americans and their rights.
Lower and middle class wages rose higher under Trump than any time in history. Look up the numbers from the failed Obama years. Dredfull!
There were ventilators in the stockpile of the Federal Government. Trump administration didn‚Äôt maintain them so they were junk.
Trump CDC even had a report that said the travel ban from Europe was to late.
So how is this Obama‚Äôs Fault? Trump has been President for almost 3 and half years. So why didn‚Äôt Trump prepare the Feds? Trump administration cut funding to maintain the ventilators in the Federal stockpile.

I know I won‚Äôt watch today. Trump talking point for the whole hour with Jessica getting in a little bit of talking point.
Should be noted that in the Pandemic readiness plan which all the Dems point to as the "in place policy" that Trump should have followed mentions masks as suggested but not required.
This is hilarious. A  personality tweeting this and this picture. When Fox was spreading Trump narrative that the virus was a hoax.
Right all of you Conservative are tired of hearing about the virus. But gang violence and killing in cities you don‚Äôt mind hearing about. You don‚Äôt want to hear about the virus because it makes your boy Trump look bad. Violence in cities changes the focus to Democrat mayors.
How did you come to the conclusion that he‚Äôs bothered by the results? He‚Äôs stating facts. Trump BARELY won. Why can‚Äôt you cultists take that in?
I hate to say it but I don‚Äôt think Biden is the person we need for this country and we definitely don‚Äôt need trump even though the economy was improving before covid. We need a legit 3rd candidate
Lance, I strongly disagree with you. She hates President Trump so much that she will risk the safety of Chicago people rather then have his help. She is a pathetic person!
Wait, what? You let them do it based on Trump‚Äôs demand? You let them do?
They were at a funeral. The report that Katie shared didn‚Äôt say anyone died. They were wounded. So I was the only one concerned about deaths. Katie just cared about spreading Trump law and order narrative since his poll numbers are not good.
Ya. Do you care about the people dying from Coronavirus? The word in your tweet was gunned. I own a gun and illegal firearms are out of control. Trump doesn‚Äôt want to do anything about that. Katie doesn‚Äôt care about that.
Actually I live west of Chicago across the big river and we hardly have anyone killed by gun violence and a week ago someone was shot and killed. So I know Trump and Fox want to make it look like all Democrat cities are in chaos.
So 1000 dead in America from the virus. I wonder who the guest will be on talking about that? Maybe 1000 dead not important because it‚Äôs not part of Trump law and order narrative.
This will be the focus of Fox News. I think Trump is trying to keep chaos in America by sending in the Federal police and stirring up violence so they will cover it on Trump tv.

Hmm, I moved into this apartment a few months before trump was elected in 2016, and now I'm moving out a few months before the 2020 election. COINCIDENCE? You're welcome in advance, libs
If you buy the argument that the virus is more likely to scare Biden voters from going to the polls than Trump voters there is no need to consider moving the election.
Oh of course, you can chat about baseball, but you can‚Äôt comment on Trump trying to destroy democracy by calling to cancel the election. Resign!
I am not a George Bush guy but at least he has some amount of decency and I feel he is capable of compassion. I think it would be great for our country if he took a more public approach to opposing Donald Trump. He lacks both of those things.

Oh Mike.  Posting this on the day we bury an icon, John Lewis, on a day when Trump wants to illegally postpone an election, let's talk "coddling".  Restoring law and order starts Nov 3.  FYI, 59 yr old white Iowa female. You've lost the heartland.
That's lovely but both Grassley and Cornyn have no spines, so if Trump tries to move or delay the election, they will do nothing.  If we were a country based on rule of law, Trump would no longer be president.
Oh course he did.   Trump is such a whiny toddler.   I suggest no one show up.

Trump You are a great embarrassment to the USA. Almost everything out of your mouth is INACCURATE &amp; FRAUDULENT. The most historical part of your presidency will be the number of voters demanding your removal from office in 2020. Do yourself a favor and resign.
Donald Trump already knows that he is going to lose and is trying to discredit the election.

Twitter penalizes Donald Trump Jr. for posting hydroxychloroquine misinformation amid coronavirus pandemic. Peddling false narrative just makes me think Trumps invested in the wrong drug. #DOJ
At first it was an excuse as to why Hillary lost. Then it became a way to ignore the issues that ppl care about. Then Russia and Ukraine became the focus of the impeachment hearings cuz it allowed the Dems to pretend to check Trump while not actually doing so.
It‚Äôs so fucking ridiculous. If Trump or Biden came out in full support to legalize marijuana they would win the election hands down. It‚Äôs a no-brainer policy that is tangibly positive for voters and would motivate them. The rejection of it is only caused by greed and racism.
So policies that 70-80% of the population are in favor of, only 20-30% of the people drafting DNC proposals support. If/when Trump wins again, this is why. The Democratic Party does not care about what we do, unless we force them.

What are you talking about? They'll be at brunch. They're sure things are fine now that Trump's gone. After all, he was the problem, right? So once he's gone, everything will be normal again.
Do you think Trump or Grassley have ever, and I mean ever, gotten calluses or had to apply for a job in the last 60 years? Trump I bet it‚Äôs never.

Jason Amash was elected as a Republican.  You use different metrics than I do obviously.  Trump, for example, ran an honest campaign to win the Republican ticket in 2016. Biden pulled strings in back door deals.  The true delusion is not seeing truth.
Yeah those silly progressives pointing out how insanely conservative Biden is. What a joke they are... üôÑ  So now you just have to trust the most lying presidential candidate of all time. Another way Biden is worse than Trump.
1) Really? We had a recession under Obama and he didn't give people money.  We had tear gassed protestors... Dems didn't seem to care.  Why has dropped more bombs their first term?  On which topics has the policy of Biden been more liberal than Trump?
Do you think liberals will fight as hard against Biden as against Trump?  Do you think Dems will become more progressive and listen to Sanders more or less after winning?  If the goal is M4A do you think we'll get it sooner with a Biden win?

Every day rioters attack federal buildings in Portland for no reason is another 10,000-ish votes for Donald Trump in November
I admit to being a bit mystified by the stock market recovery. I can only attribute it to two things: optimism about a vaccine and the smart money not thinking Trump is in as much danger of losing as it appears he is.
Interesting theory: Trump will win re-election because Democrats will be too scared of the virus to leave their homes to vote for Biden, who they are lukewarm on.
Republican politicians don‚Äôt have the same luxury. Because their voters primarily make their livings in the private sector, they have to produce conditions that are conducive to economic growth. Trump has failed to do that in 2020, which is why he is about to lose.

I agree. Trump is getting his friends out of jail so they can once again help him win again. And what happened to Juliano, where is he and what is he up to?
how come all the people who have accused trump and those on the trump campaign of colluding with the russians are actually the ones who were "crossing paths" with the russians.

My husband &amp; I talked about that last night.  This is not Nixon, there should never be a pardon for anyone Barr, Trump, Flynn, Wolf, etc and the one thing that will piss us off is that Biden and the Dems allow pardons.
This pretty much sums it up - this is exactly how I feel. ‚ÄúNearly five months later, though, it‚Äôs become apparent that the Trump administration‚Äôs abject negligence means we‚Äôre about to repeat it [the miserable experience] anyway.‚Äù
The Obama admin was the one that argued for indefinite detention and child separation in court. They lost that case. Thats why that ruling was on the books when Trump took office  They won the case on toddlers being able to represent themselves - which is why that's the precedent
Exactly. I understand the rationalizations and the justifications. I understand fear of Trump. I can't stand the lying.  Why do ppl feel the need to pretend Biden is someone he's not in order to vote for him?

Iowan, 59 yr old female and voting Biden.  My husband also voting Biden, but lots of men we know are dug in Trump supporters,  wanting the 1950s back. I'm serious, they want to go back to white male dominance .
What a joke! Saying "We need journalists" when modern journos smear for their own political agendas. The news coverage of President Trump's cognitive test was another case in point.
When Trump throws the ball do you fetch it like a good boy? Or are you just the leg-humping variety?
The 2 most important decisions of the 2020 cycle, one brilliant, one fatally bad: (1) Democrats unite over 48 hours to dump Bernie &amp; exalt Biden - brilliant (2) Trump hires Fauci, acquiesces to shutting down the country - fatally bad. That is your 2020 election in a nutshell.
That‚Äôs ‚Äúone term President Donald Trump‚Äù.
Trump is not a conservative. He‚Äôs an opportunist. The people he brought to the Republican Party are not conservatives. They are displaced, white, mostly male, blue collar Democrats. Most conservatives merely tolerate Trump as ‚Äúbetter than the Democrat. I know because that‚Äôs me.
A Trump ad assails ‚Äòchaos &amp; violence.‚Äô Critics point out the photo is from Ukraine in 2014.

Bill McGurn‚Äôs argument as to why President Trump should limit federal law enforcement activities in Democrat controlled cities to protecting federal property. cc:
As a lefty, it feels like the hits against Biden are focused on the things the Left is leveling against Trump. This feels like another example of that. I don't think Biden's brain is any mushier than Trump's.
SUICIDE PIT (Freestyle) by X was the first time I heard somebody diss trump in a song
now this person has to link the president to the actions of someone completely separate from the president.  she'll do ANYTHING to blame trump for ANYTHING.
Senator  ahistorical criticism of anarchist protests comes amid outrage over the Trump administration‚Äôs violent federal crackdown on the #BlackLivesMatter movement.
I mostly agree but I wouldn‚Äôt mind Biden talking sh^t to him right away because trump is a child and that‚Äôs all it would take to make him go off script and even dumber. Poke that ‚Äúbear‚Äù.

Yep the left thinks Trump is literally the most powerful being in the universe.   They must all think that, right?   For him to be personally responsible for so much stuff and to be able to even unintentionally and unknowingly dictate the actions of half the country ...?
Get out while you still can!!!! "Trump came from nowhere five years ago to effectively take over the Republican Party, remaking it into a seeming cult of personality that has repeatedly violated the party's supposed orthodoxies".  Ask the genius to help with big words.
All you GOPers have is projection. But please continue, it‚Äôs easier to recognize Trump‚Äôs faults this way. Don‚Äôt forget to tell us how you think Biden will steal the election. Pathetic.
Its sad that it usually takes me a minute to tell if it's actually trump or not.
We ask you to investigate Ernst dark money, Trump taxes and the illegal use of federal forces in our cities.  Can't wait to vote Joni and her stupidity out.

I hope Trump wins his war against the violent moms and graffiti artists.  (jk I like moms and graffiti is kinda cool)
It is what? Are you really suggesting that viruses have nationalities? Ethnicities? Races?  I call it the Trump Virus because he‚Äôs the main reason the US has handled it so poorly compared to the rest of the world.

This is the Trump ally (who apparently isn't aware Trump is still the president) who spread pro-Trump propaganda on Sinclair-owned Iowa TV news stations until his show was dropped last December.
Trump is doing this as an election strategy period. We know because he can divert attention away from Covid and stir up his base. #TheView #TheLincolnProject
pete's still doing the apples/oranges thing. ABSENTEE VOTING is provided for those who will not cannot be in their home state/district on election day, such as pete, president trump and vp pence. it's a process, you must request a ballot.  it's not a free for all. it's an OPTION.

So can we put a laugh track behind Trump and Kim Reynolds whenever they talk? It helps me cope with the fact that these people would be shitty sitcom characters instead of real-life people with power.
Per  if whether or not to wear masks is a top 3 issue in the election in November, then Donald Trump will lose.

Ooh!  Will there be a similar bill for the Trump administration?
Stick to reporting news, this sounds like something Trump would tweet.
Trump wants to delay tge election... What were you saying about the constitution?
Good thing he can‚Äôt delay. Only congress has the ability to do that. Just shows how little Trump understands how stuff works.
Wow indeed. Co-founder of the Federalist Society saying if Trump‚Äôs tweet about postponing the election is grounds for his impeachment and removal.
WATCH LIVE NOW:  President Donald Trump holds a live press conference on the coronavirus.
it was utterly ridiculous the way Cavuto treated  he kept interrupting him when he had stats and proof that Obama and Biden‚Äôs economy and job loss stunk compared to  He needs to just state he hates Trump and is Democrat! crazy
She's awful. All Republicans in Iowa are on trump's hog so hard they've forgotten how to think and speak for themselves. She has ads attacking "communist China" (literally every time she mentions China she has "communist" before it). All with a dead-eyed smile
You want to know why I care so much about the 2020 election and making sure that everyone has access to vote? Because my job is at stake. Because if Trump gets another four years my dream job won't be possible. So yeah, I care.
Thank you Ms. Speaker! If this goes any further please tell us what us citizens need to to to get our congressman/ senator to stop this madness from Trump.
NO TRUMP! YOU'RE NOT GETTING YOUR WAY!
Also show where they are being authoritarian. The size of the federal government is shrinking and the regulatory control of our society is also shrinking under Trump. First time in 30 or 40 years.  Trump = freedom.
The idiocy of saying this to Iowa voters is that most of the people supporting Trump in Iowa live in rural areas.  Those in the cities and suburbs tend to vote democratic.
Please ask  and  their opinions about President Trump's idea of postponing Election Day.
Trump has made the barr so low
Imagine if we handled the while election however trump wants it and he still loses. He would reverse his opinion at the speed of light and swear that was his position the whole time calling it all a fraud.

Trump does not have enough money to keep the stock market up.  PEOPLE have to believe their money will grow (knowing traders and gamblers will often inflate/deflate stocks regularly). Stocks always come back to reality at some point - capital goes where best used in free markets.

Unfortunately the schools have no decision in anything at all.  This governor has made many wrong moves from the beginning and continues to do so.   She is going to continue to follow what the bully, trump,tells her to do.

GOP? That's funny if it were not so stupid. Trump is trying to open and keep things open while the Dem's and RINO's remain quit (or work against Trump).  Trump is on YOUR side - fighting the entire establishment that has vested financial interest in opposing Trump.
It‚Äôs not about which candidate you like. Trump, as the incumbent, stands to gain more time as president if the election is delayed. Biden would lose potential time as president if the election was delayed.  (All assuming Biden wins. If Trump wins nothing would change.)
I‚Äôm to the part in the report where the players are told to keep politics and sports seperate but then some were allowed to wear MAGA hats and present trump a jersey. And I have a hard time believing they didn‚Äôt know they would be attending and doing that.
The idea of reporting Trump's tweets and Twitter suspending his account is fun, but wouldn't be productive. For one, it'd rile him and his idiot followers up because "first amendment." And two, he's his own worst enemy. Let him say dumb shit and unravel
Yes! Trump IS ridiculous thinking he can STOP an election. Isn't it IN the constitution, that he can't do that??

Thank for the shout out Alex! #WallAgainstTrump
The point is he's doing EXACTLY what he believes needs to be done based on 40 years of SAYING EXACTLY what he's going to do.  Trump no saint - no one believes that. He's better than EVERY other politician in Washington stealing from YOU. Biden there for decades, now fix it? lol
You are watching too much CNN and not doing your homework. Find YouTube videos of Trump the last 40 years. He's doing EXACTLY what he said he would do. It's VERY predictable and planned (MSM can't/won't understand).
His 'fans' don't think the virus is not real - it's the RESPONSE that is a hoax.  Trump is done after the next 5 years. The invisible enemy will be gone and although I'm not sure, I believe we return to stable money (this process has already started). Fed has devastated the poor.

Pence is a Noodle. He's similar to Bush Sr.  Reagan picked Bush to appease the Right (at time). Bush is part of the deep state (both) and might have been too stupid to even know it. Both well enriched.  Same with Pence. He must not be POTUS after Trump or we head backwards again.
BOTH Bush Presidents might actually be worse than Clinton (close tie). NEITHER had the best interest of USA. It's why I left Rep. Party. No Pres. since Regan represented the American exceptional way of life - they enriched themselves - Big Gov. Elites.  I'm back with Trump.

I report lots of the misinformation he tweets.  Hopefully  listens and quits giving Trump a platform for his lies and hate.
I don't like Trump, or any Republican politicians for that matter (besides Mitt Romney; he's OK I guess), but maybe it's because he didn't know Rep. Lewis very well? Not everything the president does is immediately because "orange man bad."
Now, the folks who have been saying "Trump can't do that, it's illegal" without then putting in the work to stop him have been all but useless, but even THEY are more useful than the nihilists who mock them. At least they're trying to keep society from collapsing.
The whole point of saying "Trump can't do that" is that if enough people in our society agree to it, then it's true--it's the necessary first step to taking action to prevent him from doing those things.  When you laugh at this idea, you're giving in to him.
I have been furious with the people who casually drop "if there even IS an election" into conversation for years, and I'm equally furious with the folks who mock anyone who says Trump won't be able to delay the election, cheat his way to victory, etc.

Remember when the Trump Admin put together a voter fraud investigatory committee and then immediately quietly disbanded it because there was no evidence of actual widespread fraud whatsoever
The choice is obvious.
Trump killed one of his own staunchest allies to hold a rally in Tulsa. Imagine what he‚Äôll do to America to avoid losing in November.
Didn't Herman Cain get coronavirus from Trump's Tulsa rally? Damn.
‚ÄúAmerica braces for defining constitutional crisis as POTUS claims powers he does not have‚Äù is the headline. There is a gun to the head of our democracy, Trump‚Äôs finger is on the trigger, and he is SHOUTING AT US that he wants to pull it. WAKE THE GODDAMN FUCK UP.

Just read an interesting thread about the election.  If Trump somehow delays the election his term still ends Jan 20.  No election in the HOR means Nancy Pelosi can‚Äôt become President.  No election in the Senate means 23 R and 12 D lose seats.  D Patrick Leahy becomes president.
We are in the endgame of American democracy. Either we get Trump out and live to fight another day, or it‚Äôs over. Those are the stakes. He will burn this country to the ground to avoid losing. What is and isn‚Äôt in his ‚Äúlegal authority‚Äù does not fucking matter.
I want every journalist going ‚Äúwell, technically he can‚Äôt delay the election!‚Äù to kindly go fuck themselves. Trump‚Äôs entire presidency has been a series of things he ‚Äúcan‚Äôt do‚Äù that he gets away with because OUR DEMOCRACY HAS BEEN BROKEN BY A PARTY OF INSANE FASCISTS.
I am not under any delusion that Trump‚Äôs call for delay is grounded in the public interest.
Just to be clear ‚Äì I am not urging the delay of the federal election.  But I can easily see why a delay would increase enfranchisement. Mass VBM will pose major challenges. (I am not under any delusion that Trump has these serious considerations in mind.)
Emperor Trump wants to delay the election.  A thought we all expected from him.  Expect to see support for this in the Senate and elsewhere. Is this the beginning of the end of America? Shame on him and anyone who supports him.
I guess the coverage is inevitable. Which is what Trump is relying on. It‚Äôs a sick cycle, which seems to have propelled him to victory in 2016.
Trump made his suggestion during a series of tweets in which he again protested proposals to allow mail-in voting, saying that system is too vulnerable to fraud.
Trump is kidnapping political opponents with secret federal agents and people are like "Nah, he won't delay the election, that would be going too far!".

But with 23 Republican Senate seats up for election along with 12 Democratic seats, the majority would shift to the Democrats, putting Patrick Leahy in the Oval Office. So essentially, if he postpones/cancels the election, Trump literally hands the White House to the Democrats
Yeah, DumDum. WHY would so many people trust Fauci and not you?  You blasted excellent on the cognitive test.  Are you admitting you can't figure it out? AND, let me ask you:  HOW do you bankrupt a casino?  I mean, what are the steps.  Pay losing bets?
And yet you all blame to Trump. The liberal State handled it poorly.
Trump is never wrong. Mary Trump can explain how he got that way.  She can explain a lot more...19 bank boxes of his financial records. Wow!
Nope. As you can see from the tweets below - which were written prior the report release - I thought it was clear from Barr's summary that the report would contain damaging information. Others were just hysterical that Trump didn't get indicted, and thus couldn't see the obvious.
Instead of finding a single line plucked out of a statement that you think falls short of ideal, read actual policy positions Biden advocates. The stakes are too high to play purity, fashion-show politics and pretend there‚Äôs any equivalence between Democrats and The Trump GOP
Was yankee staff surprised at Trump‚Äôs announcement he‚Äôd throw out the first ball? That‚Äôs called fantasy baseball people.
I don't know what the unhinged theories would be yet -- as far as I can tell, Biden hasn't adopted them yet. But if e.g. a Democratic President starts going down Goodman's rabbit holes, then yes, Trump should pardon to forestall malicious prosecutions.
If Trump loses and the incoming administration starts adopting unhinged prosecution theories, I would hope that Trump issues a blanket pardon for Barr and others. Even if prosecution is baseless, as it would be here, it can suck up time/energy. Better to pardon.
you have no more interest in exposing crimes in the trump administration than you do exposing pedophiles in your wrestling program at Ohio state.
I truly wish the Joe Biden I see in Trump ads was an option lol
Really? How? (This I gotta see. üòÇ)  The man has literally spent his entire career fighting for the People, eschewing corporate/lobbyist influence, &amp; being consistently (not 100%, but close) on the right side of history. Joe has helped build the corrupt system that led to Trump.

Pick one. All are accurate to Biden. The list for tRump would, of course, be far more extensive &amp; far less polite, so I'll agree there is a difference. Just not enough of one to be worthy of voting for.
Unfortunately you and Trump literally sacrificed the lives of so many families due to your negligence.  So many dead Americans because of Covid.  It makes me sick that you think throwing $500 at people makes up for all the wrong you have done.

I'm not voting for Trump.  And yes, Bernie is too radical for some. They're called lobbyists.  The majority of voters, particularly among registered Democrats, are actually in favor of his ideas at levels of 70-80+%. The Green Party platform is his. That's what I'm voting for.

And we can unite against all of that, but not with Joe. Voting for Biden &amp; the Dem Party is only going against tRump &amp; nothing more. It is giving a free pass to all of the other corruption &amp; ugliness.  I'm voting Green. Their platform represents my values. DNC doesn't, at all.

Bush is responsible for the Patriot Act, DHS, and ICE which are all being weapons zed against us, as many of us said they would. Bush is responsible for arming Trump.

Glad we agree.  I don‚Äôt blame Trump for the Covid epidemic or the economy.  I blame Steve for promoting crap statistics and crap experts.  He just retweeted a claim of 7 DC deaths in 2 weeks.
Bush II at least had the sense to fade into the background and take up painting after he was done. If anything Trump will step on the gas, which will make taking him down popular.   The main danger is if Rs succeed in scapegoating Trump for everything.
Robin Vos says we shouldn't delay November election, breaking from President Donald Trump's suggestion.
I have to wonder how callous someone has to be in order to tweet something like this. You don't use someone's death to score political points. It's disgusting.   Not a Trump fan, but add this to the pile of reasons I regret voting for  in 2016.
My son will not be going in person...she can proclaim all she wants. She‚Äôs not a dictator. My wife is immunocompromised, my Dad is having heart surgery soon, and she still has no real plan, and keeps the districts in constant chaos. Iowans are not Trump‚Äôs test market.
Is an endorsement from Donald Trump something a business really wants? I would think that it would alienate a good portion of its potential customers.
"Well, you'd like to say that, and sometimes you do," added Trump. "The problem is that sometimes your own chemicals take over and you can't wait."

why don't you stand up and call it how it actually is. Donald J Trump is directly responsible for the death of this man. He was hospitalized about two weeks post that terrible Tulsa rally. How many more have to die, while you and your party continue to support a monster.
How can his supporters not see that he wants to be a dictator?? His ‚Äútrump 4ever‚Äù video tweet, saying we would delay the election, and when asked if he‚Äôd accept election results he said ‚Äúwe‚Äôll see‚Äù???

BBC News - Donald Trump suggests delay to 2020 US presidential election
Importantly, this change happens BEFORE the inauguration of the new President. Which means a new President Pro Tempore is in place before Trump's term expires.   Assuming the Democrats follow precedent (they wouldn't) they would elect the most senior member of their caucus.
Trump's term ends whether there is an election or not. Thus, the 25th amendment is clear as to the order of succession. Next up is the VP - but oh wait, his term is over too.   Next up is the Speaker of the House - hooray, President Pelosi!!
Folks, I hate to break it to you, but if Trump somehow manages to move the election (he can't, but the hypothetical is fun), we won't get President Pelosi.   BUT, we will get a respected Democrat as President. Allow me to explain. (THREAD)

The 1st was a candidate for the house from AL, the 2nd was Trump's new celebrity MD with which he can hawk hydroxychloroquine (which he profits from), the 3rd was AG Bill Barr, yesterday, before a house hearing on his shitty fascist antics in Portland and the last one was Trump.
I move to delay the election and grant Chancellor Trump emergency powers, which he has pinky promised to give up once the Separatists have been defeated!
One might also ask why Trump thinks that will be unsafe to vote in November. Are all the purported cures a scam.
Now I am more and more convinced he is letting this virus go on and on and it was a plot by the republicans to delay the election and steal the election for Trump so he can stay in office.  See... I can make up total bulshit conspiracies too and make it sound believable.

President Trump floats election 'delay' amid claims of voting fraud
President Trump broached the subject of delaying the election in a tweet in which he complained about potential problems with mail-in voting, adding: "Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???"
Between Trump, the GOP &amp; all of his racist supporters, this is how I feel most days. üëáüèº

Great!  I'm on board for mail-in voting!  The only definite thing in this country these days is that whatever Trump says, the exact opposite is truth.  Trump is literally incapable of not lying.

Scott and Donald Trump have zero grasp of reality and have no idea what they‚Äôre doing but hey! Great job guys
The dates of federal elections are set by Congress, and the Constitution makes no provisions for a delay to the Jan. 20, 2021 presidential inauguration.
What if we just let Trump go ahead and tell his followers it‚Äôs been delayed? The rest of us can vote on Nov 3.
Did anyone think Trump WOULDN'T at some point suggest delaying the election?
President Donald Trump is for the first time floating a ‚Äúdelay‚Äù to November‚Äôs presidential election, as he makes unsubstantiated allegations that increased mail-in voting will result in fraud.
If you think Trump's suggestion to "delay" the election is in any way defensible, you can go ahead and unfriend me now.   It's anti-democracy. Full stop.
I am in a very ‚Äúfuck Trump‚Äù mood, so perfect timing on delivery.

Once again, Trump is using his playbook of segregation &amp; outright racist policies. It‚Äôs not a crime to be low income. This policy is a continuation of keeping the poor down &amp; ensuring that there is not enough affordable housing in our communities.

Going from "Of course Hillary's going to win" to "Trump is going to cheat and stay in office even if he loses" is a slight change in tone.
Dems can't get a single thing passed, silly. McConnell blocks everything, even things his own party wants. If Trump didn't support it, McConnell said it won't move... He said he won't get the rug pulled out from under him again (the immigration bill from about a year ago)

Corrupt Donald Trump is a Trojan horse for the top 1% agenda.  He will do whatever they want to take more money from the people and transfer it it them and himself.
Yes Biden is the leader we need because Donald Trump has not been a leader since he took office
How is it propaganda when it's coming straight from Trump's mouth?
How about one of Trump hawking various failed wares (steaks, wine, restaurants) and then Trump hawking hydroxy-whatever (of which he bought up millions of doses)? Give it a "ginzu steak knives" vibe. Or a "bass-o-matic" vibe, if you were an early SNL fan.

I agree hate has removed the ability to logically think.  I've never seen a person such as Trump hated so much by any party it started well before 2016 election, I just don't get it. Why the hate?
Do you ever think about people outside of Iowa/AMERICA? I watch BBC WORLD NEWS &amp; yesterday they aired vile trump‚Äôs ‚Äúcoronavirus briefing‚Äù-they HAD TO TELL their viewers what he was saying was DANGEROUS &amp; completely WRONG/ there is NO CURE right now-YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THISü§¨
Since the pandemic began 37,000 meat packing workers have tested positive for #COVID-19. 168 have died. *that we know of* Many packing plants are not fully testing their employees. Even those who are could be manipulating their data since Trump demanded they stay open.
Aha! I wondered why #IranTreaty traitor Tom Cotton was making such a target of himself. üéØüèπ  He's simply being the latest "shiny object" to distract from Trump's murder of 150,000 Americans while allowing Putin to put a BOUNTY on our soldiers!
THE BBC SHOWED THIS &amp; HAD TO TELL UK VIEWERS THAT WHAT VILE TRUMP SAYS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS &amp; NOT TO LISTEN TO ANYTHING HE SAYS ABOUT ANY CURES BECAUSE THERE IS NONE RIGHT NOW ü§¨
Here is my take and I credit the BBC.  Biden is like smooth jazz playing in the background. Trump is like heavy metal screaming profanities in your ear every day.  That's why Biden get elected because we need a break from all of the chaos and need some quiet.
Prove it?  What are your sources or do you just repeat what ever trump says.
98 days before an election is a little too late to start worrying about your constituents more than you worry about keeping Trump in the White House. Your lockstep with his administration has hurt Iowans and the country.

You bring a good point. Still, she was not able to secure 50% of the votes. She did get more votes, but by negation, the majority also did not want her - not as not-wanted as Trump, but not really a win for anyone. A run-off would have been the way to go, but we don't have that.
I disagree. She did not deliver her message outside of her core base. She was a bad candidate. The only reason I voted for her is because I felt Trump is a total NO. Not every time a woman is not chosen means that it is sexism.
That's cuz  isn't a man; he's a baby. When he doesn't get his way, he throws tantrums...hence, Baby Trump Blimp.
"If trump wins America is dead."  Stating absolutes is counterproductive on our end, because when something like this doesn't happen, conservatives will just point to this and call us drama queens.
Democrats have long contended that Attorney General William Barr has walked in lockstep with President Donald Trump. Yet in often contentious testimony before the House Judiciary Committee Tuesday, Barr appeared at odds with his boss on one charged issue.

Exactly = hold protests away from federal buildings/courthouses and deprive Trump/Barr of their oxygen!!!!
No. You're just unreasonable. She is a child. Adults are expected to behave like adults. The real derangement here is that you are such a strong Trump supporter that you won't even call out injustice when you see it. Party is irrelevant. There's no excuse for this.

In a "better-late-than-never" development on Monday, President Trump gave a boost to face mask use by tweeting an image of himself wearing one - more than three months after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended everyone wear‚Ä¶
It's hard to put your employees at risk enforcing a mask mandate when there is little to no support from local and state government. The shopping alternative is Home Depot. Home Depot's CEO is a big Trump supporter. Lowe's CEO is an equal opportunity employer.
You two are typical Republicans who love war. Trump does not and neither do Trump supporters. God bless our President and God bless the America !This is a lie. Trump has no friends.
Over 150,000 people dead because Trump didn't do his job and he's saying it's safe now???
I‚Äôm seeing a lot of false information about what would happen is trump found a way to cancel the November election.  Here is what it would look like if he found a way to do it.
1 good, 1 ok and 1 bad president. How quick the American people forget the truth. Only thing they have in common is they are better then trump.
I still believe there's only two types of Bernie bashers now, Russian trolls and Trump trolls pretending to be Bernie supporters. Very few of these Bernie bashers are real Bernie supporters.
Trump?
No. Yes, Trump is a narcissistic asshole, but people have to think and do for themselves.
Sorry but no delay in the election. Just gives Trump an excuse to stay in office and run this country over
All you Republicans who are now voting against Trump are still complicit in the wanton destruction of our environment, in the dismantling of our educational and health systems and America‚Äôs social safety net. The  was promoting bigotry and homophobia long before Trump.
I‚Äôd like all the #RepublicansForBiden, #LincolnProject folks, founders of the  and others who voted for Trump in ‚Äò16 to consider how much fallacious propaganda your party fed America in order to get voters to believe Trump was preferable to
My tweet will age fairly well. The election will not be a landslide victory for either candidate. Honestly I think trump will lose the popular vote but will win the election based on electoral college similar to 2016.
Oh, that‚Äôs funny. Chuck is the co-chair of the Trump re-election campaign in Iowa along with the #KimReaper  Joni takes her marching orders from Koch Industries. They all work solely for the #ComplicitCorruptGOP
Trump‚Äôs ultimate defense is going to be ‚ÄúWhy did everyone let me get away with it if it was all so bad?‚Äù
RUDY IS  A CONSIGLIORI FOR THE TRUMP/PUTIN MOB FAMILY!!
To be fair I feel like people are even less confident about the democratic nominee in 2020 than they were in 2016 so yes you‚Äôre right it‚Äôs not 2016. It‚Äôs an even worse situation where most people don‚Äôt even want Biden. That‚Äôs a strange situation to be so confident in a trump loss
You neglected to mention that two of the three judges in that second controversial ruling were trump appointees
I mean I doubt he will lose but we‚Äôll see. This kind of overconfidence that the political left have the election in the bag and trump has no chance in hell of winning is what got him elected in the first place.
Biggest defeat in history of us election? If you think trump will lose worse than Mondale lost to Reagan in 1984 then you‚Äôre clearly blinded by your own disdain for the president.
A real president doesn‚Äôt intentionally divide the nation thats all trump has done since he started running for potus
Louie Gohmert aka Gohmert the Goober thinks he got Covid from his mask. This comes from the same book of logic that says Donald Trump is a Christian and we should care about the opinion of  TV game show host.
Trump's fault
Per Trump...you hate it here, then leave.
Trump speak - law and order actually means my way or the highway!
Trump speak - do your job. actually means, declare war on American citizens.
Trump speak - always actually means never!!
Trump is not an animal. Animals have decency and kindness, Trump is not an animal.
Trump speak, anarchists &amp; agitators, actual peaceful protestors!  Federal Government, his version of secret police, thugs, sent to declare war on American citizens!  Once again violating his oath of office!
Or the same logic someone would use to call Donald Trump a great President or a Christian.

i think the President is doing the best that he can and I thank him very much for all the work he has done to make America great again and put of values back into this country thank you president trump
-32% GDP report comes in and Trump then announces he wants to postpone the election. Are you kidding me?   It can‚Äôt come fast enough.
couple things: 1. no, trump can‚Äôt delay the election. 2. he‚Äôs only calling for a delay because today marks the worst gdp drop in history, and he‚Äôs trying to distract you. focus on and spread THAT news!!
You should question ALL nominees of Trump. His reasoning is questionable. BEWARE OF TRUMP!!!
Did anyone think to ask him if the Trump rally was worth it?
Journalism is about comforting the afflicted and afflicting the comfortable. Too often we readers/viewers see the opposite, especially with Trump in office. We see reporters fawn over Kudlow, Ivanka and Kushner, and mimic GOP talking points about lazy Mexicans &amp; welfare queens
Factor in the undeniable and systemic bias against President Trump and the data is overwhelming in favor of hydroxychloroquine - I didn‚Äôt think there was anyone left that actually believes media and academia are not tragically biased (maybe you‚Äôre that last one - well done).
So this is what winning looks like under Trump's Presidency.   Yep so much winning.   US economy posts its worst drop on record
No trump his killing off his buddies.
Trump is already attempting to take control of every branch of the government. It's as obvious as the nose on Putin's face. BEWARE OF TRUMP!!!
Trump could kill somone in Tulsa and his supporters wouldn‚Äôt care!

As he was a Trump supporter, will Trump mention Cain‚Äôs passing?
GDP is down, Obama is giving an eulogy, Fauci threw out the first pitch...Trump just had to tweet something so the media would talk about HIM.
Herman attended the Tulsa rally and got sick right after....hmmmm. NO WAY they are connected. I think all older and sickly Trump supporters should continue to go to ANY rally he has and/or meet in large groups to talk about how great Scott Baio is.
Trump killed him
People blaming Trump for a down GDP clearly don't understand how a world economy works  Or any economy in that regard   If you shut down businesses for MONTHS and don't have any international trade........surprisingly, money isn't exchanged for goods/services
Five states already rely exclusively on mail-in ballots, and they say they have necessary safeguards in place to ensure that a hostile foreign actor doesn't disrupt the vote.
Damn.... Trump - talking about delaying the election.
We should all want to do the opposite of what Trump wants!
Considering that Trump keeps inviting Putin and other foreign adversaries to interfere in the election, voting by mail would have the least amount of voter fraud.
Trump wants to rig this right in our faces.
From CNN: Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so   ( watch out, Trump WILL make a move to take TOTAL control of U.S. Government)

Beautiful View. IM SORRY SIR!!!! BUT BEAUTIFUL PLAN.  SOOOO VERY GREATFUL AND CANT IMAGINE!!! WHERE WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP AND FIRST LADY!!! A I SAVED IN... EPIC PHOTOS. THE ONE WERE THEIR PRETTY EMOTIONAL???? WELCOME HOME
OMG! You're a HillBot. I am so glad she lost a Trump. Kamala is a Hillary clone and I HATE her for that.   I'll be grudgingly vote for Biden as long as he doesn't pick Harris as VP.
Yes! I was going to go along with the Biden thing because I want to get rid of Trump. But if he picks Kamala Harris, I'm writing Bernie Sander's name in. F that crap, I'm not voting for that bi%ch.
True but if he picks a running mate I hate, wanting to get rid of Trump isn't enough to make me vote.
Yeah- I‚Äôm starting to give up hope. I pray if trump wins re election that the democrats take majority over the senate. If they have the house and senate they can stop a lot of the crap he is doing. If that doesn‚Äôt happen we‚Äôre screwed.
We‚Äôre doomed with Trump and the GOP betraying the nation.

I bet you were all for the Trump tax cut for the rich. But a few extra bucks for the people struggling to survive is to much for you. That $600 will go directly into the economy unlike the tax cut for the rich.
Trump‚Äôs policies are also helping Texas to record record numbers of new Corona virus cases as well as deaths. Maybe Trump needs to reconsider changing some of his policies.
Please President Trump don‚Äôt go there they are your allies. They are trying to get you re-elected   But they are trying to be truthful and sir you have made a mistake or two. Let them do their job and please keep doing yours   I believe you are wanting the best for America

Republicans need to stop pandering to a manifesto led by a maniac whose only interest is Putin.  Republicans need to put Trump's needs down and take up the needs of Americans. The people who voted their traitorous ass back over and over.
Thank you President Trump. We want are country back. You can‚Äôt have your freedom of speech when you won‚Äôt let others have theirs. And it‚Äôs not a peace demonstration as soon as you start destroying others property.
Putin‚Äôs puppets. The GOP and Trump continue to destroy America.

Thank goodness it wasn‚Äôt needed. Hats off to NYC for getting prepared and ultimately flattening the curve. Did all of that with little to no help from Trump who was still in denial mode.
Here are some interesting bios...
It‚Äôs called The Buck Stops Here.  Sorta like Trump blaming everything on Obama.
Trump has killed 145K
Trump &amp; GOP are getting desperate. They know he's going to lose in a landslide to a weak candidate so they're using socialism as a scare tactic.   Joe Biden is NOT a Trojan Horse for Progressives, AOC &amp; Bernie. ü§£ü§£ He's actually an old style Repub. That's what is scaring them.
You know it‚Äôs going to be a crazy day when Trump goes twitter crazy before you even leave for work. Buckle up Twitter Family something big is happening.
No there‚Äôs no pmt due. Are you aware of the fact that the orange slime is ok with putin paying the Taliban to kill Americans soldiers? Probably not. The senate has been told  but trump didn‚Äôt know??? Just another lie to add on to the 20,000.+. He is an embarrassment to the USA.
Biden is a well balanced, caring man who shows America needs him. Joe doesn‚Äôt need groupies, we get when we have Joe, truth &amp; visionAccording to the polls America loves Joe. We need calm but mostly someone we can trust, that Joe. With trump, it‚Äôs been 3-1/2 years ofchaos &amp; fear.
Trump is the first president to build a ‚Äúspaceforce‚Äù #AlienDNA it‚Äôs starting to make sense ü§îü§ï
Trump has thrown people into his administration that he knows nothing about throughout his entire term. It's one of the few things he's consistent at. And with an 88% turnover rate, it's painfully clear he's picking the wrong people every single time.
trump costs the US taxpayers millions every year because of his golfing on his own properties. Scum.
I read recently that trump had $400,000 from the campaign funds to his personal account. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised.
The Trump administration said Tuesday that it will reject new applications and shorten renewal periods for an Obama-era program that shields young people from deportation.
I have never said, "Christ, Almighty," out loud so many times since Trump took office, and I genuinely do not believe there can possibly be a higher power.
Yes, you can always make fun of him for those things. But I wouldn‚Äôt end a relationship because of it. Now if he thinks Trump‚Äôs great, I‚Äôd run for the hills.
Wrong...he said a "woman of color", not necessarily black.  It's my opinion that she will be black in order to shore up the black vote since Trump's support was high in the black community prior to the George Floyd protests / riots.
The so-called doctor Trump and his son retweeted lying about how hydroxychloroquine works also says alien DNA is used in medical treatments and science is creating vaccines that immunize against becoming religious.  WTF?   You just can't make this shit up.
‚ÄúDemon Semen‚Äù.  Isn‚Äôt that what produced Trump‚Äôs kids??
Ask Trump to recite the first fifty digits of pi and he‚Äôd ask:  ‚ÄúApple or cherry?‚Äù
You should create a video that‚Äôs just Trump saying Pocahontas over and over again

I want one a baseball card with one of America's heroes. And bonus it pisses Trump off, that made my day!
Yeah how about we listen to the Hong Kong protester from a few months ago   "Donald Trump don't trust China, China is asshole"
They couldn‚Äôt. Trump wants it to go private. Putting funding in would cause him to throw a temper tantrum.  Number 1 rule. Don‚Äôt make the child angry.
That's really funny considering I hate Hillary Clinton And Neolib Democrats. I'm a socialist who voted Trump in 2016. So back the F down.
Donald Trump's re-election campaign is buying ads on #Facebook that spread dangerous disinformation about voting. Facebook‚Äôs business model is subverting democracy. Tell federal regulators to investigate!

Have you read the Steele Dossier?  Why want you acknowledge that it is based on lies??  Why want you acknowledge that Obama illegally spied on Trump's campaign??  You are brainwashed, that's why!!
Was he convicted of anything?  Was there any "smoking gun" of Russian collusion? Yet you think that Trump should've helped Mueller out more when the investigation was based on the LIES OF A FALSE DOSSIER!!  So you can take your Mueller Report and shove it up your arse!!
You're the one who said that I believe anything that Trump says (which I don't), so I'm throwing the same logic back at you.  You haven't denied your love of Obama, have you?
You worship at the feet of Obama. It doesn't bother you at all that Obama illegally spied on the Trump campaign because for you others, the end always justifies the means.  You probably take a knee and pray to BLM and Kaeperdick each night before you go to bed.
It was the same thing when John McCain passed. He hated that the Obama‚Äôs were welcome but he wasn‚Äôt. Ohhhh‚ÄîOBAMA!!üò§üòñüò§üò©üò¢üò≠ Trump wants a RING!üçäü§°üí©ü§¨ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüåäüåäüåäüåäüåä‚òÆÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è
I've read parts but why would I read something in its complete entirety that's based on a false dossier.  Why would I believe someone who is part of the deep state apparatus and is a sworn enemy of Trump?
How many Russians did Obama or Bush kill? What did the coward Obama do when Assad crossed his "red line".  Here's how Trump responded and how many Russians he killed:
I honestly can say, I‚Äôm beyond disappointed that we‚Äôve continued to wait for the system to work &amp; remove him, yet nothing. Trump is using the system to commit his crimes. Had the system worked, most of the 150k would still be alive &amp; we would have barely heard about Covid-19.
How is Trump a traitor?  I understand that you may not like him, or even hate him, but exactly how has he committed treason???

President Donald Trump's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, has tested positive for the coronavirus ‚Äî making him the highest-ranking official to test positive so far.

As an Iowan I'm ashamed of you. As a healthcare worker and recovered Covid patient I'm horrified that you would push Trump's lie that it works.
While that might just be a meme, I really do not know, I am sure that she has a trademark (from China) for coffins.

Bring back decency. Rest in Power John Lewis. Trump refused to go honor his life. #JohnLewis #JoeBiden   ‚ÄúJoe and Jill Biden pay their respects to late civil rights icon John Lewis, who is lying in state in the Capitol Rotunda.
Trump retired you!  Go back to sleep.
agreed. 538 gave trump the best chances in 2016 and polling was pretty conclusive that Comey letter was a massive deciding factor late which broke Trump's way which was the election.
Completely agree. It was great pre- Donald Trump.  Let‚Äôs go back.
I completely agree with Donald Trump. I too am disgusted by all of negative trending tweets. As Donald has had 3.5 years to do something positive and has yet to deliver, apparently the only option is to have him removed from office.
Sure, give Trump another 4 years b/c you are sore loosers.
Iam definitely voting for Joe Biden, there is no.way I would ever vote for Trump. In my opinion he represents  everything a leader of this country should not be. It may take awhile to correct the damage he has done but we can do it.  #ResistanceTaskForce

Is there a bigger shithead than Donald Trump?
Trump is depending on the pandemic to prevent them from voting  in Hope of more votes for him. That's why he's pushing that it's safe to socialize and return to school without becoming infected. He doesn't care if you get sick after the election.
Up to 150k now. And no more mask for Trump?  No photo op needed?
The clip of part of the border wall falling over during the recent tropical storm in Texas would be a perfect icon for Trump‚Äôs entire term.
I honestly don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs wrong, he‚Äôs not endorsing trump bye doing this and it‚Äôs not even for him. I just think it‚Äôs funny how some people are going to take everything he does and blow it out of proportion and make things worse then they need to be
You lie to yourself. Trump or America. Fu if you support a traitor who has let 150k Americans die and us soldiers.
Do you have a position with the Trump campaign or do you just generally violate the Hatch Act?
Good. At this point the less I see or hear from Trump, the better.
Trump‚Äôs team will never get it. ‚ÄòGetting it‚Äô requires a desire to understand a problem and skills to determine effective solutions.  Trump and team have opinions and the confidence to speak. They are talking heads, not problem solvers.
If Donald Trump questions the election results it will be because his election tampering didn't work.

1500k and counting. And still no response to the bounties. Failure at a massive scale from Trump.
The point of this tweet (just attempting an interpretation) is Trump's use of feds in protests is being exploited by Dems and taking away from the BLM movement even tho Obama could have done way more to help protesters at Standing Rock. That's what he gets at in the comments.

Update: she‚Äôs two rows away and it took her ten minutes of walking back and forth on the plane to find her seat. When I tell you that Trump supporters really be THAT dumb
If I have to sit next to the ‚Äúwomen for trump‚Äù shirt lady on this flight I‚Äôm gonna lose it
I hope they slip a dementia test into the Biden/Trump debates. Just have ‚Äòem both randomly trying to remember five words.
Normally I‚Äôd say that a Republican incumbent President hit bottom when he gets told not to use President Reagan‚Äôs image to raise money; but I‚Äôm guessing Trump is far from hitting bottom with regard to the despicable things he might do.
Probably unless they‚Äôre singing the praises of Donald Trump. That‚Äôs too big of a stretch for me.
I have a Trump joke but its just too offensive.
Trump loves hate. Trump loves chaos. And   is right there with him.
Is Biden secretly paying you? Because you keep sharing things that are a HUGE positive thing for the country if Biden is elected. I mean, I was already voting for him, but this is just another cherry on top. Keep highlighting his good policies. It helps sink Trump!
I will get the democratic black vote to keep trump in office #2020VISION
I wonder if trump‚Äôs so called police are willing to take Americans Vets?
Stupid Trump just made the protest bigger. Love it!
The story didn‚Äôt say he was holding a Trump sign when he got shot. The story did say the cross about guns that‚Äôs in the picture was reversed in the window. There‚Äôs also a BLM sign. It could be a number of things that set the shooter off. Or nothing at all.
Would like to vote early if possible, but yes I will be voting against Donald Trump on Tuesday November the 3rd.
You were not a supporter of free speech you are a  supporter of Trump Who doesn't believe in free speech only lies.  You're airing a conspiracy theory that will destroy America. The segment should say no one should believe this including the president. You should praise Dr. Fauci
Trump's Secret police are the violent ones. These protesters in Portland are every day people standing up against racial and justice inequality.
Trump is a perfect example that some people will believe anything no matter how ridiculous!
Sinclair Broadcasting is FOX on Steroids... Believe at your Own Risk... Trump TV...
If your against Fascism.... Pass this On... Our Military Was Antifa till trump... Stand Up and Be Counted!!!
Trump &amp; his team of lowlife family continue to lie and rob the American people. Open &amp; shut case!  Release your taxes today. They will be devastating to you, your supporters and the world. You will pay the price! Crimes of the century!
Don‚Äôt believe what your eyes and ears show and tel you. Trump and the GOP are enemies of the nation.
Sad for you supporting criminal trump. I‚Äôll pray for your forgiveness from God.
too little too late Trump, drug prices aren't going to save the election for you. Besides you don't want to hurt your rich friends
Ah you shitstain, Obama was dividing the country years before Trump. How about you sit this one out and let the big people discuss
And Trump from the White House.
I stand behind Trump!
Sure, Jan.   Putin. Russia. Bounties. Trump. Puppet.
What it does is it allows you to protest without pussy cops shooting rubber bullets at you. none of the Trump turds got shot at and they stormed capitals
Yep. When Biden wins itll all go back to normal. I'm glad. Trump is putting to much sunlight on our problems. It must stop.
Trump is yours?  Lol  How about those Russian bounties?
Go away please!! You've divided this country just as bad a trump did but atleast we know he cares about this country.
Lol. It‚Äôs sad you support the criminal named Trump.
‚ÄúAll roads lead to Putin.‚Äù - Nancy Pelosi   ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care. I believe Putin.‚Äù - Donald Trump
Russia. Bounties. Trump. Putin. Puppet.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care. I believe Putin.‚Äù - Donald Trump  ‚ÄúAll roads lead to Putin.‚Äù - Nancy Pelosi
Trump cast his directives as far-reaching, but they mostly update earlier administration ideas that have not yet gone into effect.
This video is on fire with TRUTH!   Donald Trump..."You have corrupted everything you‚Äôve touched since you became president."  ‚ÄúOn Nov 3rd, America evicts the most disgusting family ever to live in the White House."  Trump is #AmericasGreatestMistake
When will you stop. Do you even know what the truth is at this point.  I hope all you Trumpsters understand that Trump is the deep state.  I have never been so afraid for this country as I am now.
( does Russia have that many to lend him )From CNN: Trump says he could send as many as 75,000 federal agents to US cities Trump says he could send as many as 75,000 federal agents to US cities
He rambles just like trump does.Good luck. She will only do what trump tells her. Instead of leading the country we will be following! Your life is not worth the money someone is giving her is the truth!
Ugh. Living in Iowa has been such a drag lately. After you feel like you survived the Trump news of the day ya gotta fight the Iowa news.
I‚Äôm with Steven Calabrisi. It‚Äôs not hyperbole to call Trump a fascist. He loves other fascists, he supports fascistic policies and loathes democratic institutions. All of these things are objective truths that even his most ardent supporters cannot deny
3 war criminals is all I see. Just like Trump
They should've ran a better candidate then. They didn't learn that lesson this time either but Trump's so bad people will vote for half a bowl of shit.
We all know Trump‚Äôs election tweet was meant to serve as a distraction. But I will not stand by and let the #NBA‚Äôs return be obscured.
Uh oh...what more has she done to Iowans to prove her loyalty to Trump?
Herman Cain dies from COVID-19 which he caught it at the Trump rally wearing no mask üò∑
A person doesn't need Trump to tell them anything. President Chickenshit just withdrew from Germany, and gave Europe to Putin.  He is a scared little boy trying to do a man's job.   #MAGA #VoteBlue2020
From the FAKE virus? How is that possible?? Trump said it "disappeared like magic".  How could it kill anyone if it disappeared???
You just lost Europe! Russia will take over now that you have pulled our troops out   Trump is the WEAKEST president, biggest COWARD ever.
Actually we ARE able to vote in person, and WE WILL! Trump will have his ass handed to him and he knows it!
The news is contemplating "What if Trump does not accept the election results?" More and more I am thinking, what if the people don't.
Vote them all out. #extendPUA #ExtendUI
I wanna see Trump use hydroxychloroquine if he ever tests positive, then blame it on the mask when it doesnt work.
Barr vehemently denies being a Trump tool. Then he repeats a Trump lie about voting by mail and is forced to admit, under oath, that he has no evidence to support the lie.  Thus confirming he is a Trump tool.
A funny thing happened to FOX News, Roger Ailes was convicted of sexual harassment and he died. Trump is thick headed enough to believe that the Hugh Hefner lifestyle is still all the rage.
Trump claims not to have a sense of humor, just compare her to Dr. Fauci. I have some leeches and a skull drill that I think could help too.
Nobody Likes Me, Everybody Hates Me (Guess I'll Go Eat Worms) Funny Song With Lyrics - YouTube #Trump #TrumpIsACrybaby  #NobodyLikeANarcissist
Build Back Better...LOL! Does he have any thought that does not parrot Trump! Disgusting.
Trump whining about Germany and NATO I guess Germany sees as the US has greater interest globally and should pay more or maybe Germany doesn‚Äôt have as many enemies just saying
Somebody said Trump &amp; his supporters got their hands on some of that demon sperm from that great doctor how was it Auntie and Uncle C was it sweet or sour üëéüèøüëéüèøüëéüèø
I mean, fuck Trump still... I'm just saying this isn't the first time this has happened.
Uncle C how they charging for that AlienDNA big Daddy Trump said it works asking for a friend ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Don't say that otherwise I'll have to vote for Trump
I agree with 95% of what you're saying, but credit where credit is due the Obama administration is the one who started putting kids in cages. Trump just continued that legacy.
better not go lightly on Trump again.
Quit telling me how much you miss Obama or how Hillary should've won. I'm sick of that shit, and it does nothing to improve our situation. Focus your energy on getting rid of Trump.
Now you're making assumptions. I'm not BLM and theyre stupid as fuck for going out like that with no mask. Stop trying to make it political. Why is everybody doing that? I hope Trump wins this election tbh because I hate Biden. Stay on topic if you're going to argue masks with me
My apologies I thought you meant we move to the right when we elected Trump. My point still stands though. Trump? Biden? It's the same guy with a different label.

You're giving Trump too much credit. The Madden Football playbook is more complex than his.
Beth Martin   Why do people keep saying non-republications won‚Äôt accept the election of President Trump?
Also not to mention it‚Äôs unfair to American protestors WHO HAVE THE RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH to get tear gased and shot at with rubber bullets. Trust me Trump you don‚Äôt just look like this. YOU ARE THIS.
Americans that are still out of work living off 1200 dollars for four months and unemployment/that is ending soon. It‚Äôs unfair for American woman to feel disrespected by their own president but fuck by all means trump your feelings first.
Big Daddy Trump finna send us some more moneyyyyy Uncle C we balling yeah MAGA we in this bi**h 1200 bout to put us on the map baby 2020
what if Trump was from Jersey he‚Äôd be like YO! I‚Äôm Donny T check out my 20 inch rims hair slicked back but he‚Äôs from New York so he‚Äôs like just call me Don ya know like ‚ÄúThe‚Äù Don and he‚Äôs like if you look at the thing not the first thing but the other thing baddabing
Then, what you smell is Trump.
Lewis is always looking to tree a Trump supporter. He wants me to tell you, good job.
They do. It's the Trump family.
Regardless of your political leanings Trump will be gone, sooner rather than later, we hope. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs using every resource available to him. This will be a very ugly election and if by some bizarre chance he gets the electoral votes again, there needs to be a reckoning.
And HOW exactly did your political views become the purity test for decency? I know plenty of indecent Trump haters.
Trump 2020. Vote your pocketbook
#Facebook just say no. They are a Russian/Trump tool
You spelled Trump administration wrong
" I love the uneducated " - Donald J. Trump... and that folks is the one true statement he has made and why we are where we are.  #stayinformed #WearADamnMask
People trust their local stations unfortunately. They  dont realize that in the era of Trump everything is politicized
67% trust Fauci. 26% trust Trump. People are having their own experiences with COVID-19 or know someone who has so Trumps gaslighting isnt working
Actually both are true, the disease is pretty bad especially with some sectors of the population. It is also true that the Democrats are using this disaster to blame everything they can on Trump. It is an act of desperation.
It would be amazing if the fact that Putin‚Äôs puppet was so incompetent that he unwittingly set off a chain of events that ultimately led to the Russian people liberating themselves from Putin like Americans are trying to liberate themselves from Trump.
Thanks for fighting for our country. Thanks for showing everyone that integrity matters. Thanks for using your poetic and brilliant use of language to expose Trump and his sycophants.
Joey, you need to completely wipe Trump out. Obliterate that goon. He‚Äôs America‚Äôs terminal cancer, and he must be radiated the fkc out of office. Take no prisoners, except for Trump.
Trump‚Äôs physique is deteriorating just as much as his mind.
More focused on beating Biden than Trump..... Okie y‚Äôall ü•¥
In all fairness it was more like Tony Stark to Donald Trump. Rich cool guy to total buffoon with money.
when Trump said they‚Äôre murderers and rapists it felt implied he was referring to those in power and we know the corrupt have all the power of the worst kind of people why is it so hard for liberals to let that be true it‚Äôs not racist it‚Äôs reality üòÇüë∂üèªü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Go look at  story. I reenacted what I saw in my head.  Sorry I don't just make "fuck trump" and "omg new profile pic" posts.
How soon before the cult of Trump GOP begins to trash Ronald Reagan? T-minus...
You and Trump, in a dark room, for 30 seconds.

UNI's Justin Holmes,  professor, weighs in on how the November election could be impacted by a fall without football.

And Senator Ron Johnson is heading a committee that is using Russian disinformation.
Trump graduated from Penn....W from Harvard, Bush Senior Yale.....the last non ivy president was Reagan
You know hes looking at a list of the words. He keeps looking down...WHAT A TRUMP! yes that will be a derogatory slang term when describing a total idiot. Mark my words...What a Trump!
Trump administration tries to block release of a documentary that shows ICE agents illegally breaking into home, eager to arrest immigrants without criminal records #SmartNews
Barbara Walters at her best. We sure could use her now. Watch the video
RIGHT ON!!  AMEN  TRUMP 2020
If it includes a head examination for voting for  Trump. I‚Äôm fer it.
Uh dude this is Trump‚Äôs America!!
Makes sense, he was right about Trump winning in 2016 while you‚Äôve been posting the same tweet for 3 years about how Trumps going to jail. I can understand why you wouldn‚Äôt want to listen to someone who‚Äôs right about stuff.
Ya cuz Trump has a (bad) opinion about everything üòÇ
You know damn well that Trump will have something to say about it.  üôà
The president is gambling the very lives of our young children to win a few votes. Not a good bet.
He is and Bernie Sanders is in love with the idea of Russia. Several of our leaders want to romanticize Russia and communism. Trump used to feel that way until he took their money, now he‚Äôs twisting on their hook.
Trump is having a press conference at 4pm about schools reopening. Do I dare watch it and with how heavy of a beer?
STUDENTS FOR TRUMP can't even control their own idiocy.  They support a racist, very low IQ, weak, pushover of a president who is incapable of doing his job!  Governors are running the country now.   Trump is already done.  You all look really stupid for still supporting him.
No they are disgusted that you would believe such hateful, racist lies from Trump, the WEAKEST president ever.   China kicked Trump's butt.  Russia took Trump to the cleaner's.  BLM made Trump look like the stupid racist he is.  The governors are running the country.   Weakling!!
Trump's America.
Trump hides the facts of COVID-19 by having no experts speak and lies about the severity of the rising cases. Blames China again and yes they have some responsibility but his handling of it is a total failure. #TrumpVirus
Only 1 in 10 polled adults feel its safe to open daycares, schools and preschools That means 90% feel its unsafe. The Trump administration (as usual) is trying to go against the majority  AP-NORC poll: Very few Americans back full school reopening ‚Äì KWWL
Yes because Biden and his record of voting in racist crime bills would just completely fix police brutality in America. Biden is just Trump in a blue suit.
Well since she only cares what Trump tells her to do, districts should be able to decide.
Mac would absolutely not approve of this Donald Trump shit üò™
Trump would bomb the ITBS test
Trump's COVID-19 pivot from "it's a hoax" to "it's going to get worse before it gets better" is exactly how I felt about his election and my hope for the end of his presidency.
Now do Trump.
Trump's America.
The only thing worse than losing a presidential race to Donald Trump, is losing a presidential primary to Donald Trump.  and  will go down as the two most pathetic losers that ever tried to go out for the presidency.
I love how trump and Republicans can just be like "time for the Gulag anarchists!" and republican voters just clap like seals. Really though how do people fall for this shit?
Here's what the Huawei ban may bring about.
Fewer tests. Fewer cases. Trump sez so.  does whatever he sez.
"Solo" had really shitty villains in it. A villain should be pure evil and dark as hell, kinda like Trump.
Not surprised. Let's see what happens, after Trump kicks him to the curb.
A new Trump campaign ad depicting a police officer being attacked by protesters is actually a 2014 photo of pro-democracy protests in Ukraine  via
are trash. I can't wait for 4 more years of you whining about Trump but doing exactly nothing about it.
Cancel trump. Add extra money to essential workers especially healthcare.
Heroes fight for America. Trump fights against it.
I bet you have some gems from before this one. I have been following you for years and you have been predicting this since Trump declared himself a candidate
You kicked ass today! Some of these people who work for Trump have to be embarrassed the way they spin everything to play to Trumps image. I bet their like OMG I can‚Äôt say this it‚Äôs moronic right before they speak no freaking way all of them subscribe to Trumps self promotion!
No, and I have zero respect for people who say "if you follow Trump unfollow me or I'll block you". That is the most arrogant, entitled, egocentric way you can be in a so-called democracy. It's like get over yourself, people are going to have a different opinion you big baby.
