Absolutely. But I bet anyone who says both probably said so when Trump did that. My point is that many saying the kneeling is disrespectful we’re probably silent about Trumps blatant disrespect of the anthem in January.
Hey Trumpers, legit question for you: Are you down with sending kids to school AND postponing the presidential election AND not allowing vote by mail? I'm just trying to figure out any logical reasoning besides it directly benefiting Trump.
If Trump wins there is no Congress. He arrests all the Democrats and replaces them. There are no more elections again.

I hate Trump but I'm pretty confident he's still going to eek out a win. The media will eventually pivot to asking where Biden has been (seriously, where the hell is he) and Biden will come out and look stupid and that lead will shrink fast.
Without offering evidence to support his claim, Trump said mail-in voting will cause an “inaccurate and fraudulent” outcome.

If the GOP had a system set up like the dems have to cheat in elections, the  would have the exact opposite opinion. They would join Trump in condemning the voter fraud going on.

Not sure what you mean by  "consistent evidences".  I prefer a wide variety of evidence rather than "consistent".  Evangelicals have a higher preference for faith than evidence.  Many have faith in Trump.
Most of Trump base are white evangelicals  who were raised to not think critically and not question authority such as Trump.

The democrats are creating a false narrative that Trump will refuse to step down if he is defeated in 2020. Trump will apparently declare Marshall law and halt the election.   This is part of the democrats strategy to undermine the election process and steal the election.
The reason they want to relate it to Trump is because he’s openly against it? Not hard to understand.
But it IS opposing Trump? Trump is openly against taking a knee before games. Doing it is opposite of what he believes.   Try to keep up, Champ.

It’s just as much to our advantage to keep Germany safe from Russia. Trump doesn’t know his history.
How could you possibly say, at any point, that I support Trump? That’s incredible.
Dads have different forms of parenting. Trump’s is too dysfunctional. He only does things for 2 reasons: for his own self interest or to try and make himself look good. Every move is a campaign for him at this point.
Trump’s the only president who would have pulled troops for that reason. I’m sure Putin is aware of that.
Absolutely! The withdrawal of troops was about Germany not paying their share so it was just retaliatory. He really dislikes Angels Merkle. Germany has been an ally for a long time. The left is all about peacekeeping. Not trump. He has no foreign policy. He reacts not acts.
You’re right about one thing: trump can’t do anything right.
You are so generous to trump. I think Putin knows how to play him with flattery and trump wants to be his friend. I’ll bet Putin is ecstatic about 12;000 U.S. troops being withdrawn from Germany. I thought we were talking about TV shows😋

I am amazed to see protests still continue.  I've bemoaned our lack of protest through the past year with each of tRump's atrocities (especially the caged children) so this scenes are thrilling.  If other countries can do it, so can we.
Trump was Jeffrey Epstein’s friend and he wished Ghislaine Maxwell well. So probably a sicko pedo too. He actually said he was more sexually attracted to Ivan’s than his then wife Ivana. Gross
And idiot trump believes a doctor who works with alien DNA and says women can get pregnant by astral projection. So say whatever you want if it comes from trump it’s a lie. He even lied about being invited to throw 1st pitch for Yankees. He wasn’t asked.
Lincoln Project ad makes Trump a laughing matter
Sorry about that...got you now!
A  memo from DHS said Tuesday that it will reject new applications and shorten renewal periods for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. This is following the Supreme Court decision that Trump could not end the program completely.
Followed all I wasn’t following! Plz FB!
Fauci cares about human life, while Trump only cares about ratings and re-election.
Admitting that tRump brings his reelection campaigning to cabinet meetings....
If This Doesn't Show You They're ALL in Bed Together NOTHING WILL!!  via   (more info on GAVI funding from the US gov:
Keep trying to convince yourself because no one else thinks so. That province definitely belongs to trump. Multiple bankruptcies bc he lied to banks and creditors. He's always been a liar. Read Mary Trump's book. He was born and raised to be a liar.
What do you think of trump's 20,000 lies? You're a fool if you believe anything out of trump's mouth.
Exactly what you would expect from trump, cheating and lying.
Exactly what I thought. He thinks it might be appropriate for trump though since trump has already done it at least twice publicly. Disbar this man, he is a terrible attorney.
That's why he's not staying in his basement. However, even if he did, he would still win bc trump sends Biden higher in the polls every time trump opens his mouth, mainly because he is such a liar. hahahahahahah #TrumpIsALoser
Aaaah, let's talk about the Russian spying then. They are actively and did in 2016, trying to swing the election to trump. Don't want to talk about that do you Jim
Barr is an ass. This has nothing to do with Biden! He’s just made it obvious that everything that is taking place is about getting Trump re-elected...
That says it all! He’s Trump’s personal attorney.
Public Hanging
Idaho will definitely go trump but many republicans are disgusted with him. Not enough to make a difference but I am going to cast my vote for Biden anyway.
Yep, many. They surround Trump.   and  are the worst back stabbers. Many fake Republicans.  #DrainTheSwamp is real
Trump failed America! You and your corrupt GOP enabled him. You played politics with American lives instead of doing your job, and you are still doing it. Stop the blame game and get your head out of your butt! Your ignorance and politics are costing human lives! #VoteOutGOP
Kids over 10 spread virus same as adults.  If you think there has been this amazingly coordinated effort to spread a disease just for fraud trump could tell you anything and you’d believe. No facts to support your theory. You sheep
Trump actually said "THEY should have let us know" while referring to the larger point of discussion they were addressing, that "China knew" and didn't let them know, as was a main focal point of this briefing.
I guess she's happy with tRump + she must have been a Bernie supporter. I have been contributing to Democratic Senate candidates but will now contribute to her opponent as well!
tRump and his sycophants.🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬💩💩💩💩🤬🤬🤬💩💩💩
F OFF TRUMP SYCOPHANT.
Geez, Ronna, Trump has said some pretty nasty stuff about you and you still grovel at his feet. Buck up, girl, and act like a woman.
The party of Trump! White privileged Supremacist a**holes!
Oh I’m sure he’s still trying to do things in-lawfully to get Trump out. Maybe he’ll incriminate himself more.
This was happening way before Trump, but he’s just the one that’s going to take care of it. Obama didn’t care enough about his own city and did nothing, during that time more murders in Chicago than Iraq and Afghanistan under Obama
If we don't stick together against Trump, he will win! These are the people I'm afraid of.
That is an excellent way to get Trump reelected.
Big Pee Pee moment! Trump 2020!!!!
I agree.  Why is the MSM not exposing these guys instead of focusing on tRump's goons?  Show that the extreme right groups are setting this up for tRump.
Intelligent, compassionate...everything tRump is not!
Two problems with the post: 1. Trump is not a racist 2. Biden really is a pedophile
At poor baby   did you really think that the traitor Donald Trump can break back here career? Didn't like it then don't like you now dumbass
Anyone in America that supports Scott Baio I will get off Netflix and anything else that brings on Scott Baio because he's a moron and the Trump lover
only cares about his money just like Trump so Trump lover pissed off America is so over you
I don't know really are you an American or a trump lover who loves Putin
TRUMP 2020 !
TRUMP'S PLAN TO STEAL THE ELECTION  1- Hide CORONAVIRUS data from voters  2- Make mail-in voting impossible   3- Disinformation via social media  4- Illegal foreign aid  5- If nothing works, fabricate a new crisis to distract the voters  FULLY SUPPORTED BY THE KREMLIN AND GOPs.
So much for caring about our vets. We all knew trump never meant it anyway
I can’t understand it. I know people I always considered logical and intelligent who have changed completely since trump came on the scene. Now they believe all the conspiracy bs like QAnon, deep state, and all of Hollywood is pedophiles.
Oh, you mean the trump virus. They don’t need you for vaccine development. Spend your time working on some policies that will get your virus under control. Quit pretending you’re busy working. We know better.
Every city with riots is a democrat run city that allows it. It's not Trump, these rioters, arsonists, and violent assaults are from democrat voters or an other words: ANTIFA
Wonder if Christians put a Trump add like that. Hmmm, would media freak out a bit?
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGA
Yes everyone. Make sure you and everyone you know gets out and votes. I’m old and I’ll risk getting trump virus to cast my vote for Biden.
Trump is focused on GOLF, dividing this country, ignoring the pandemic, destroying the economy, violating the constitution and breaking the law.  and  have destroyed America, turned it into a fascist pitied country, unwelcome all over the world!
In 100 days, we’re going to make Donald Trump a one-term president.
Donald Trump needs to be investigated why is it that America has the highest death rate of covid-19 ? Putin is his BFF did Trump initiate this to try and be the dictator of America let's face it the man is a moron he's working for Putin
I just checked them out on eBay..selling from 7.99and up.. This set 28.24.. hilarious! I’m sure there’s some kind of kickback there for Trump!
Trump 2020
Just reported Trump’s mail in voting tweet! Again!
Only if accompanied b a Trump flag. We fly the American flag along with my husband’s Army flag. For us, it’s patriotic and means we love our country. Trump has no votes in our house!
Science, remember that? People who trained, people who worked their asses off to help others! Trump made sure that the CDC, science experts were discredited and deemed useless. You pushed this as a hoax and you fueled this ignorance of science! So FU!
Yes, definitely! But I live in a Red state (Idaho) with a governor who follows Trump loyally.  He has made virus control a regional approach now! We have been in phase 4 almost a month. Spiking big time, schools going to open and we’re surrounded by anti mask cowboys. 😢😷
This is why Trump is losing...
That is one stupid man trying to take a page from trump playbook
Yeah too bad you can’t ever say anyone but you are ever right. Your so wrong in 90%+ decisions you make. You only make changes if it suits your right wing crazy’s and if it is profitable to them but especially the Trump empire! You have done nothing but hurt the working class😤😡
tRump is trying to destroy the country. We have to VOTE! OUR LIVES DEPEND ON IT. 😷😨😨😨😨😨
And the tax payers of America fund these people.
ANTIFA Public School Teachers are on 'Paid' time off during COVID. They have time and no worries.  Time to designate ANTIFA as terrorists and treat them so in all these cities.
Trump 2020 or we will lose America forever. Trump is the only answer to keep America great.
Trump 2020
That's what TRUMP was and still is doing for this country, that's why we need to keep him as they best president ever! Trump 2020.
You have already failed us. 50 years and nothing you did in those years made a difference to the USA. Why would I think you could do something now? Your old and can't hold an intelligent conversation. Trump 2020!
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
The country is dying and Trump is taking a vacation.
I think Trump is trying very hard to suppress the scientific evidence and wants them to reveal only what he wants the public to know. Such a dangerous man
He's broken, 'He' as in Trump, has broken the 'Rules For Radicals', broken the dark quiet and secret laws of DC political correctness and mutual corruption, He is playing their game their way. So YES, in their world, Trump is breaking the Rules.
Not Trump. He been too busy golfing.
Trump didn’t write the bill. He told the House of Representatives to figure it out ASAP and send him the bill to sign off for the relief of Americans. Blame your governors and congressmen
Thank you for being one of the only leaders to take action seriously in our great state. Our gov  continues to play Trump’s puppet while Idahoans die. Thank you for being a true role model and example of what leadership looks like. #GovernorMcClean2022
TRUMP BLOCKING VIRUS UNEMPLOYMENT RELEIF !!! REMEMBER THAT IN NOVEMBER !!!
TRUMP BLOCKING VIRUS UNEMPLOYMENT RELEIF !!! REMEMBER THAT IN NOVEMBER !!!
Americans still can’t pay for it because they are unemployed, have no health care because Trumpass wants to get rid of what we have. And it also does them no good if they are dead from Covid! Fascist Trump can stick it!
because Trump is a traitor
Crap...that’s our local CBS station.   I’ve see previews from the show they’re talking about...they also interviewed Trump.  I don’t watch that crap...
The American people did NOT want Trump!
Donald Trump is #AmericasGreatestMistake. We can fix that on November 3rd.  #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica #Biden2020Landslide
Trump has corrupted everything he has touched since becoming president. New from  #AmericasGreatestMistake
She's another tRump sycophant.
It is very important to vote for Republican house &amp; senate members or Trump will be so shackled he will never get anything done.
- Why is this sycophant of tRump still on your weekly panel?
He’s lying. Tweets can be checked before they are sent. Plenty of time to change your mind. Trump BS!
Ive only got one little old white lady at work that hates Trump and we’re always so happy to see each other because we get to talk shit together about Trump and his supporters the whole time. It’s the little things 👍🏻
Trump’s America!
True  Trump hasn’t changed and never will. Covid is not his priority. It never was. To him it’s a nuisance and he can’t deal with it. As he said about the death toll.....it is what it is. Wonder how you would feel about that if your family was affected.
No thank you. I will drink my imported wine! Trump swill is rot gut.
I live in a red state. Our neighborhood is all Trump. One fence on other end of our subdivision has flag and American flag hanging side by side. We don’t talk to anyone, so we just go about our lives....😒
Yes, I hope so.  Cause it is totally CRAP under tRump.  So any measures will be a definite improvement.
Millions of Americans will not get the extra $600 in benefits that Congress needs to extend because President Trump wants to make sure the FBI HQ stays in downtown DC near his hotel because it's a great source of income for his family.  You read that right.
Laura Ingraham is the epitome of ignorance. She follows Trump like a devoted puppy dog, spewing lies, misinformation and inciting violence and division!
If we don't elect Biden, Trump's current efforts to destroy America, one city at a time, will succeed. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare  #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020
This 👇🏻  “An honorable man would resign—but Trump has no honor. A patriotic Senate Majority Leader would pressure him to do so—but Mitch McConnell is a traitor to his country. It’s incumbent upon us not let this story die. Bountygate must be front and center until the election.”
Mr President Trump, your the best president ever in my opinion. It's obvious you love our country. Please keep your head up and continue to do the excellent job you do. Thank you!
They are just like trump and won’t give an actual response to a direct question. It’s always bullying insults and name calling. So childish. Impossible to have a discussion.
Checking out some of the sources they used...studies from China, the WHO, Iceland and other countries. So they will refer to China and the WHO when it suits their needs. Lost respect for the CDC. They bent over and kissed Trump’s ass! Politics over life!
I really don't think Trump will carry MI this time around. It'll be close and if he does get MI it's going to be a nice night for GOP!
Michigan teacher says he was fired after tweeting in support of Trump
Scroll down and you'll see the articles.
He isn't demented enough to have to take one. Trump was given one because of questions of his mental stability. His dad had Alzheimers and he is starting to show signs of early stages.
He will be shortly especially if trump keeps talking about his mental acuity test which proves he has none.

It's true if you are a Socialist/Communist, a Globalist, a Democrat (which is all of the above). Trump is the Best for America Now. #DrainTheSwamp
what a waste of a conference might as well start referring to you as Trump’s puppet. Action is needed most right now, and the continued inaction is astounding. Follow  example. #IStandWithFauci #COVID19 #FailedLeadership #RollBackToStage1
and   is as stupid as Trump we don't want him in the White House that belongs to America
Reminder that Trump and the  are suing to take away health care in the midst of a pandemic.   #JoeBiden2020
From   No number of deaths will make Trump take responsibility. No number of deaths won't be spun as a "success". And nobody should ever forget that it would be a much better country, if it weren't for    #RememberInNovember
This is Trump’s attempt to put another obstacle in place for Americans to vote! It’s also his vendetta against Bezos and Amazon.
Anyone who supports Trump needs to be blacklisted
Nine Idahoans died yesterday. This is on you due to your inaction as our leader in Idaho. Trump is not an example to follow or listen to. We will not forget your loyalty to a treasonous and stupid President. Roll back reopening, mandate masks, no schools. Simple.
Lots of anecdotal evidence flying around about how many Trump flags and signs are visible! From the sounds of things, the only thing going good for Biden are the lame stream media polls that they keep pumping out! #Trump2020
I agree with you! I have family in AZ and there always talking about the amount of people moving into AZ from Cali! This will probably be the last election cycle that the GOP wins AZ. Good news is, Trump can be reelected quite easily without AZ!
Ukraine said no crime was committed. It's not appropriate for a president to have a political opponent investigated when no crime has been committed or complained of. Only in Trump's admin would such a thing happen. So he’s has no “obligation” under treaty
🐂💩🐂💩🐂💩 This is tRump's America today, you idiot.  Biden is not in charge, your Dear Leader is and doing a shitty job of it.
I support Wendy’s.  They are on the Trump Train!
No, this is Trump’s America.  Joe Biden is not President yet. He owns this you tool....
crumbs  Ukraine said no crime was committed. It's not appropriate for a president to have a political opponent investigated when no crime has been committed or complained of. Only in Trump's admin would such a thing happen.
It sure looks like we are not safe now and you still have no plan for getting kids back to school safely or for getting the trump virus under control. You've had you chance and did nothing so we're kicking you out Nov 3
If you saw trump's interview with chris wallace you know that Biden doesn't support defunding police
is  in a time warp? Hasn't trump been president in the past 2 months or did Biden take over and I missed it?
This is why Trump is losing this battle....
Rand Paul has to be the biggest ignorant idiot, next to Trump of course. NY is doing great. Gov. Cuomo did a great job controlling. I think Paul can’t handle the fact that Cuomo has outshined Trump in handling the virus, hands down.
Lunatic Trump couldn’t hold it together for 24 hours...back to the stupidity and blame game....
Trump is to blame for a lot of things, but not his loser career....he did that to himself...
I hope we find out what she know about trump
the worst part about all this is that if the United States really does become a dictatorship we’ll have to read a Buzzfeed listicle called “12 Ways Revenge of the Sith Predicted the Trump Regime”
Trump won TX in 2016 by 9.2 points.  Even if Trump doesn't get all of his voters to vote for him again, he'll still win by a good margin.  I don't think it'll be 9.2 this election cycle.  I feel like it's more of a 3 or 4 point win for Trump. Plus, I've lived there!
Trump has not turned any corners. He is playing politics at the expense of Americans. Have you started to drink the Koolaid?
Yeah bc the governors were pressured by trump. Do you even know what’s going on?
I hear you. It's not my intention to bash Trump. I would say the same regardless of the individual or party, if I were seeing the same. It could indeed be me who is wrong, I can accept that. But I equally ask you to look past the STATED positives, to some of the negatives behind.
Then the president shouldn’t have contradicted the medical experts. It should be called the trump virus bc six months in there is still no unified national response. That’s not Polosi’s job, it’s the president’s
Trump’s interviews with Chris Wallace did more to improve Biden’s ratings in the polls than any campaign ad. We all know you and trump are gaslighting.
Gov Abbott is a cult follower of Trump! He is following the anti lockdown Trump playbook!
Anything is possible. But is there evidence of such? You need to be careful to differentiate between KNOWING it's a setup by Trump &amp; WANTING it to be a setup by Trump because that aligns with your chosen perspective. At the moment, there's far more evidence it was a deception.
It’s called CYA.  It’s not going to work. The damage has been done and Trump’s MAGAS are not going to listen. Over 142,000 dead and close to 4 million sick! We know this is just a smokescreen to win re-election. You really don’t give a damn about America!
Oh Shammity...the virus is killing 10’s of thousands of Americans! She is right! And it is the Trump Virus now, regardless of where it started! Ignorance and denial is what got us here and he owns every death!
They withheld Obama's appointee for a year &amp; never allowed a vote, but 1 month of lame duck for trump is just fine, eh?  These are the shenanigans of the GOP that will put them out of office, because they lack restraint and dignity, self respect, and they are strangling America.
Oh Nikki. Have you been listening? You don’t criticize Trump for Kung Flu, Chinese Virus? But when it comes to Trump Virus you get all defensive! He failed America with his inaction early on! This has already been politicized and he started it! So, in effect, he now owns it!
Ukraine said no crime was committed. It's not appropriate for a president to have a political opponent investigated when no crime has been committed or complained of. Only in Trump's admin would such a thing happen.
You get paid to kiss Trump’s ass. No real work getting done. Mitchie stalling over 250 bills that are sitting on his desk! You guys take more vacations than a average American! FYI, it’s called COVID! You don’t care. But smart people do!
Seems about right for the Trump admin....
Donald J tRump: Manicures, spray tans and hours in the mirror fixing his hair. Totally a rough guy
We never knew we needed such specific presidential laws on ethics, because we used to be able to count on presidents actually having ethics. Anyone who can still vote for Trump is complicit in tearing down American values.

didn't give a damn about 140,000 people that died until Trump started losing now the morons wearing a mask and blah blah blah he needs to go he's a piece of crap
hasn't done anything until Trump start losing now the retard is wearing a mask thinking in bets going to make it all better sorry Trump you're a loser and you'll always be a loser
I never drink Fox News bs but Chris Wallace burned trump to the ground and left a pile of ashes. It wasn’t the questions, it was the answers. Look up the MOCA cognitive test so you know what they were talking about and see for yourself
I think you better do a little independent research about this so called treaty. You are being lead like a sheep to slaughter. Probably a Qanon believer right? I’m not a Chris Wallace fan at all especially bc he’s Fox, but he scorched trump on that interview.
Is Trump Epstein's keeper or what? Did he care? Trump was busy building an empire. And you know it would be nice if we could get all of your answers from Jeffrey Epstein himself wouldn't it?
Trump just made this easier by agreeing with the lefties &amp; no Trumpers who want to believe their bandannas are saving others lives &amp; letting them work. And letting them open their pestilential businesses #COVID19 3/3
Donald Trump said we should wear masks if were inside &amp; can't stay distanced so the lefties &amp; other no Trumpers will be joining my "Don't get in a situation requiring you to be indoors &amp; within 6 feet of others" club in 10...9...8...7...
No, Joe Biden just doesn’t need his blowhard ego stroked for ratings. Trump doesn’t know when to shut his mouth. And FYI, his Sunday interview revealed his narcissistic, idiot behavior. He’s a nutcase and a liar.
Media, we need you to ask the questions about bounties and help hold our leaders accountable. Ask the questions. Keep asking until President Trump answers or walks away.   #BountyGate
This so isn’t going the way trump  thought it wouldObama sold a book.😂 Trump committed fraud with a university, built a  hotel in DC that he over charges world leaders for. Just a sliver!! Look it up!!! Oh and don't forget this.👇
They’ll drag their ass through broken glass to hear Trump piss over the phone.
As much as I want to see Trump gone, if we had a blue House and Senate he would sign every bill they sent to his desk. And people would like him a lot better.
Donald Trump wants to delay the election because watching Joe Biden campaign is hilarious stuff and he doesn't want it to end.
Creating fear and confusion all there is to Trump’s game
Since when did Trump or Barr feel the need to justify on legal grounds anything they do? As far as they are concerned, they are the law.
Trump should have been removed from office!!! #TrumpThreatensAmerica
Whenever a Democrat stands up for basic American ideals the D.C. press corps always tags it as “partisan.” Meanwhile, on the rare occasion that Trump manages a complete sentence they swoon and gush “he’s sooo presidential!”
#AmericaStrongerWithBiden  Trump is #AmericasGreatestMistake  #JohnLewisMemorial
Shaming people for coming late to the party can send an unwelcoming message. However, in some cases, ie Trump only just now beginning to wear masks, frustration is quite understandable.

Reminds me how much Jeff and Jules hate Trump. #OnlyonTwitter
I don’t even like Biden. But I will support upholding and defending the Constitution regardless. (FTR, I despise Trump, too.)
President Trump cannot "force" a second term. All he can do is persuade more Americans to vote for him than for bumbling, senile Uncle Joe.  If the democrat party wants to defeat President Trump,  they need to nominate somebody who can beat him.
Trump should save face and just resign.
I think a copy of the Constitution needs to be sent to every American, so they can see how much Trump is violating it.
The real Republicans will be voting Biden. Biden is closer to being Republican than Trump is.🤷‍♀️
He will be mocked and called weak for not being appointed by Trump and they will find something to show his non existent beef with Trump so they can continue to ignore the problem.
I always thought hate was too strong a word for me to use on anyone. But now I hate my ex and Trump.
Trump's appeal to suburbanites is one I have seen before. 10 yrs ago, there was a petition going around my neighborhood to stop a development planned across the road. The reasons to stop it? Smaller homes and duplexes were planned, which the petition claimed meant
And I thought it couldn't get any worse... Trump floats idea of delaying the November election, a power granted to Congress, as he ramps up attacks on voting by mail

More lies from Herr Trump #LyingTrump #ImpeachTrumpAgain #DonaldTrumpIsRuiningOurCountry
This will be the last tweet I will comment on in protest of twitter so long twitter TRUMP 2020 !!!
"Well I don't like the way he talks (/tweets)" or "Being a nice person isn't part of the job" when these two qualities should be relatively easy to find and expect from a President.  I was willing to give Trump the benefit of the doubt in 2016, but I know I can't do that in 2020
I don't know what four years of Biden would look like (at least not precisely).  In 2024, if we are at a point in saying Biden was an obvious mistake, then I'll gladly flip to voting for a respectable Republican president.  I'm just tired of hearing Trump voters say
"Trump has done an acceptable job and deserves another four years".  It's not even about supporting Biden to me; he wasn't even a top 3 candidate of mine in the primaries.  It's simply about change.  Change in that I know what another four years of Trump can look like.
There is a lot of talk about whether Trump is going to accept the results of the election if he loses, but I've been thinking what my mindset will be if he wins.  I'm not sure I'll feel confident in our political system for many years if our country basically says (thread)
I agree.  Never forget that never-Trump Republicans are only just slightly better than Trump supporters. They *still* embrace racism as a tactic. They *still* seek to enrich the 1% out of the public coffers. They *still* want to deny reproductive rights.  They aren't good people.
Trump is a furry #YIAYnews
Right.  I've waited 3 years as one claim after another has failed.  Secretary Clinton and President Obama are still walking around with no legal jeopardy in sight.  Meanwhile, Trump and his clownish cohorts are convicted.  How much longer before you dingleberries have results?
Who remembers Earl Scheib? Trump’s paint job always makes me think of him.
Trump is playing hopscotch at best. He has no clue what he is doing.  Why does harming your fellow citizens give you a thrill? Why do you think people are rioting? Just because Trump said some mean words?
But honestly the war with the communist sphere of influence and even isis is far from over and we all know electing Joe Biden is pretty far from the solution but in order to make this outcome make sense I'm going to have to be pretty anti Trump along with the rest
And when I had the forsight to stop the war I pointed out with a bid to stop it. It would've been funny if after netanyahu and Trump clearly fucked up along with the rest of the world it had just declined from there
You want to be against it because Trump is for it. But the fact is the Obama policy destroyed historically POC neighborhoods in cities to make room for gentrification. Sending them to Suburbs, profiting off the properties they occupied in cities.
Trump is Nixon without brains, Reagan without polish and GWB without the compassion shtick. He is basically the GOP id.
Donald J Trump tries to distance himself from another crazy Coronavirus briefing #NobodyLikesMe #LyingTrump #DonaldTrumpIsRuiningOurCountry
I think we can assume that Trump and his cronies benefit financially from this in some sleazy way..
Still maga2020. However, I fully agree with what was censored as new information came to light about the speaker featured in the video. She is absolutely crazy.   A group of lunatics should not be given a national platform because they agree with Trump on a single issue.
Looks can be deceiving. You didn't see what went before.  Who do you imagine is performing the "unlawful detentions"? Trump goons? Then why would NYPD officers, who answer to dem politicians in NYC -- not GOP politicians in DC -- assist in an unlawful act by the GOP enemy?
What makes you think they are Trump agents? The uniformed police officers who were assisting the arrest answer to DiBlasio -- not to Trump.
Those were NYC police officers. They answer to DeBlasio. Not to Trump.
NYC police are under DeBlasio's control -- not Trump's.
The video says this is happening in NYC. That's not Trump territory. It's Cuomo/DeBlasio territory.
The reporter was lucky that Trump didn't identify him as an elephant.
Okay shitlib but just admit you don’t really care about any change other than trump. You guys only pretend to care because trump is against it but in reality you don’t care about black people or any people of color.
Choice between Biden and Trump.  So what you're saying, it's a choice between Florida in the next few decades being under 2 inches of water, as opposed to 3 inches of water.  Can that even be called a 'choice' ?
I don't have to.  Go whine about the loser Trump on Parler. Nobody cares.
I don't have to defend Twitter's idea of what the relevant science is, you utter knob.   It's their platform, and their decision.  However, they're more reasonable than fucking idiots defending Trump.
Donald J Trump only likes to make money for himself and the top 1 percent #BenedictDonald #LyinTrump #TrumpIsACrybaby
Tut-tutting property damage is a profoundly Trump-like response. Don't do that.  And when the response to righteous protest is to use physical violence to protect property, then it is dishonest to frown at the response of protesters.
MAKE DONALD TRUMP NOT OUR PRESIDENT AGAIN!
I am so, so, so happy that my kids are past their public school years.  And not just because of the back-to-school shopping.  So sorry to anyone facing the current Trump-caused fiasco.

Find it yourself, Nancy is not allowed to tell people what a good and decent person Trump is.  #MondayMotivaton
The way Elizabeth voted for sanctions that starved Iranian and Venezuelan children, then voted for trump’s military budget, the largest in human history. Like girl you snapped 💅
One at a time right!!! I live in Trump land Idaho. I have been working on a few of my friends. At least those who will listen.
I thought it was humorous that everything President Obama did made conservatives mad.  But I supported much of his agenda because it was the right thing to do.  Trumpers seem to like Trump *because* he makes liberals mad.  That's it.  No other reason.
Yes! I showed him things outside of Fox News. Now he doesn't support Trump, but now I have to work on him to vote for Biden. He rather vote independent at this point. I still have work to do!!!
I have a Trump joke but #covfefe

Just another thing the next president will have to fix.  Nobody want's any reminder of Trump to remain.
How is Donald Trump not Repugnant to the Word of God?
Alright, Carlos lol. I refuse to date another conservative man for many reasons:  1). You’re voting against your gay/bi interest  2). You’re going for a party that paints minorities as leeches  It’s like Latinos for trump, I don’t associate with them.
Amen.  Trump was right.
The number of uncodified norms of behavior trashed by Trump and his administration (and frankly, by the GOP since Gingrich came to power) is astonishing.  It's very hard to repair that damage.
How is Donald Trump not repugnant to the Word of God? Answer, please.
Please Jules, if your really that beautiful woman in your thumbnail. Please consider you've been fooled by hillary and Obama. It's not your fault. I'm not asking you to like Trump. Just to realize the left is destroying you. And your hope, and your beauty.  xo
I would vote for my whiny 5-year old before I would vote for Trump.
I just realized how much Trump and Snow from the Hunger Games really are alike.
Trump isn’t even original. Trump is Spiro Agnew 2.0.
We need to keep the economy shut down. Stop the trump rallys , make the covid19 numbers look higher and push for mail in ballots so we can change the votes. Oh and trumps a Racist. #ThatsaRiot
I see fascism in Trump America!!!! #AmericaStrongerWithBiden
Did the Democratic Party Vote for Trump's Border Wall?   Democrats voted for all of it. Specifically, the National Defense Authorization Act of 2019, the bill which allowed the $2.5 billion for counter-narcotics barriers to be built, passed with 185 Dems voting in the affirmative

Oh... C'mon. He is entirely sarcastic with his "well wishing". Considering Epstein is dead under questionable circumstances, Trump was totally taking a jab.
The left will Ashley lose their collective minds and I'm just sure they will explode when Trump is re-elected again
Trump is the GOP id unleashed.
You are not alone... I have friends in the village and they hate trump with a passion but can’t do what they want to being out and being vociferous because of their health... keep standing up for truth!
She's the least charged, least indicted mastermind criminal-who's-right-on-the-verge-of-going-to-jail, ever!  You'd think that if she were heading for jail, she'd be behaving more like the Trump criminals scurrying for delays and fighting subpoenas. Instead, she acts normal.
How did your 2016 prediction workout for you?  Loved your Aspen institute appearance prior to the election where it was a joke about Trump's chances.  You guys are political clowns.
You think Trump's DOJ is just biding its time?  All the time in the world, right?  Or maybe Q is a loon, and your gullible.
Lots of people have been kidnapped and then released charged for 0 crimes so apparently they aren’t breaking any laws either. That’s why you should be worried because it gives to much power to this tyrannical government with trump and no government should have this power.
When Trump loses to Biden, &amp; it's beginning to look that way becuz he's bungled this COVID-19 crisis badly.  Americans will be trading in one corporate despot with a lesser more benign corporate despot.
Omg trump really messed up!
I don't recall President Trump being the first to spread the virus. In fact, I remember that the virus came from...wait for it...china. lemme say that again, THE VIRUS CAME FROM CHINA! Remember Pelosi in CHINA town with no mask? I do! Pelosi is a hack!
He isn't removed because Republicans worried more about their party than their country.  And if you think Clinton did something wrong, why has she *never* been charged?  Trump's DOJ has had 3-1/2 years, with is personal toadies in charge.
No lies were told, other than by Trump and his criminal buddies.
Wtf has Trump "accomplished?"  You're so full of delusions.
Yes, Clinton is better than any POS Trump defender.
Trump would rather be a civil war president than a one-term president.

Like he was getting work before his support of tRump came out!😀😃😄😁😆😅😂🤣
I doubt that very much.  You still believe in the bullshit that the lesser of two evils works politically.  It's 2 year old logic like yours is how we ended up with Trump in the first place.  Why the Democratic party no longer represents ordinary Americans.  You're a chump.
Yeah tone is tough to portray this way, so let me try and clear it up: I wasn't necessarily praising Trump, as I believe he's the type of businessman that would force his employees to work, regardless of their health risk in a pandemic. So when I cite him wanting to get workers
But I do feel as though Trump has been pretty open about getting, and I loosely paraphrase here, "very good, very wonderful Americans" back to work. I assume you don't have an issue with that messaging?
If those are the only two Trump states he flips he's still two electoral votes short.
We could have avoided the economic impact of this health crisis if we didn't have an American society so hell bent on greed and an obviously completely corrupted government at the top (both parties, not just fucking Trump).
Trump is more beholden to Putin than USA
Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV. Trump. #MySummerInSixWords
Trump and Putin ... “What is thy bidding, my Master?”
I think Trump prefers being a Civil War president to being a one-term president.
You know it strikes me funny. Most of protesters only have a mask. Wheeler the squealer. Has goggles. I think it might be a photo up that he took advantage of. I don't know I'm just saying looks kind of suspicious.  he looks like such an idiot when Trump ask ask him forhelp.
Did Trump ask for tips on how to beat up moms and veterans? Did he fish for a compliment from his idol?

Feel free to blame China if it makes you feel better. Won't change a damn thing. Trump says he's a wartime President. Herm and that other old dude from Tpusa are collateral damage.
if you would have got off your ass and done something to contain the rioters and stop destruction of property, it would not have come to this. You ma'am are an idiot to be blaming this on the Feds!!! I am not a Trump supporter whatsoever... but people like you...

This is legitimately  gentrification.....?????   Man, Fuck you Trump  you really are a fucking sleaze , gross ass pedo, money and power hungry racist puppet. I'm over this sort of leadership and the fact that the government  doesn't have a backbone to him is fucking pathetic.

Trump is a hopeless narcissist, and sociopath, who is devoid of empathy. He can’t understand or “feel” other’s emotional pain. His curious well wishes to Ms. Maxwell, translated into criminal-speak is a warning, which translated to “I’d watch my back.”

Trump should not be trying to stop attempted murder of blacks by racist whites.
Actually I think his detractors Did more to foment confusion and anxiety with their false claims of an unconstitutional proposal and fascism.  Trump is a sociopath And Too many of his detractors have trump derangement syndrome.
Trump is a symptom of the problems in America not the cause, when he is gone this will become as apparent As it should be now.
I wouldn’t vote for Trump under any circumstances, but keep this in mind: the Democrats will endanger the fundamentals of our democracy in their own interest by eliminating the filibuster rule and perhaps expanding the number of supreme court justices.  \_(ツ)_/¯
16 minutes after it was announced since Covid our economy has shrunk 39.2% trump said we should postpone the election dude does this guy think we are stupid
Timely, as today so many CNN reporters assuming that Cain got coronavirus at the Trump rally, that Trump committed an unconstitutional act in proposing that the election be delayed Republicans are spreading C19 while nationwide young adults are a disproportionate and spiking
If Trump delays the election, Pelosi takes over, until the election is held, and he is gone January 20th.  Alright we can postpone the election a few years...  it’s in the constitution, you should read it sometime.
Trump on Nov. 4th.
Trump on Nov. 4th.
Not even close. Trumpism’s most persistent goal is the advancement of the interest of Donald Trump and it will play any tune to achieve that goal.
Trump is a sociopath who literally drives you insane
As crazy as Trump is you go beyond his level.  Nothing unconstitutional about proposing the election be delayed. Chris your full blown Trump derangement syndrome, And a mask won’t help
Post Trump: Filibuster rules destroyed, 12 Supreme Court justices. Who knows what else
Not even Hillary could lose to trump this time
Can’t agree with Obama’s characterization of the filibuster rules. Democrats are going to do even more damage to the way our democracy functions than a Sociopathic Trump did.
Let's just ignore the fact that a ton of trump supporters are working class
Delaying election would only delay Trump convictions &amp; jail time &amp; cause more deaths &amp; economic destruction!! #LockHimUp #VoteForOurLives #VoteThemAllOut
Trump does not think he can win! So to keep his immunity for all the crimes against U.S. he wants a delay in the vote! #VoteForOurLives #VoteThemAllOut
Not isolated. Bernell Trammell executed in Wisconsin for supporting Trump. Capt David Dorn of St Louis murdered during an AntiFa led riot. These are the people currently destroying Portland.
I think it would be a smart move and good timing...big benefits (w/generally non-trump Democrats and little cost (I don’t think many trad cons would leave trump because of it)
Idahoans for Trump 🇺🇸
Trump suggests delaying the election. Claims he is concerned about fraud. We dealt with it in 2016 from Russia. Russia needs more time to hack the system. Trump's suggests delaying 2020 US presidential election due to concerns over mail-in voting fraud
Wrong.  Trump does have the ability to float the idea and nothing he said indicates he would do it himself.  Narrative driven advocacy journalism at work at CNN.
I am surprised that so many including  are proclaiming that Trump made an unconstitutional proposal. Part of the Trump Derangement Syndrome.  Stupid, but constitutional.
To say “everything Trump touches dies” isn’t funny anymore. I’m not sure it ever was.
How about we judge them on their honesty, especially given our experience with Donald Trump. Harris said that Michael Brown Was murdered [by a white cop]. It was a studied purposeful lie.  She lied to fan the flames of racial division for her benefit. Sounds like Trump.
Biden was incoherent today. A new poll has Trump getting 41% of the Latino vote. If he picks Kamala, he will lose the black male vote who hate her. The threatened school shutdown and city violence will hurt Biden. Trump does not deserve re-election but he will get 400 delegates.
650000 unborn killed annually.  I don’t think a comparative evil analysis serves Trump or Hillary well.
Under Trump leadership, U.S. is world's #1 producer of COVID-19. 150k+ loved ones dead! #VoteForOurLives #VoteThemAllOut
You are part of the reason we got Trump
I wish someone would speak more about the poll numbers being questionable at best. We know tech is purging so why should we believe the other arms of same beast, media and universities, blind haters all of Trump?
Even more alarming is the fact young adults comprise 50% of the new cases only 23% of the population.  These young Californians are not acting in concert with Trump or the GOP.   Why do you cling to the notion that it’s nutty Republicans spreading Covid.  Poll vs data
A reminder on why there is a “No Vacancy” attitude from the White House.
Trump will end federal criminalization of cannabis (probably this fall) and it will be hilarious to watch the hysterical lefties squirm.   (And render doofuses like Ilhan even more irrelevant 😂)
Portland, Seattle and the threat of school closures will re-elect Trump. It is too bad but true. Liberals need to stop trying to instantly change the world for a few months. Everyone is afraid to give their real vote to pollsters.
Every time Trump does something dumb I get the #Hamilton  "You're never going to be President now" chorus stuck in my head.  It's not going away anytime soon.
You're just as ridiculous as he is 😂 Biden and Trump aren't much different, and recognizing the similarities between them will help you out
Good old liberals being wrong as usual. I didn't know socialists were willing to sacrifice minorities, I thought thats what democrats and republicans were doing by supporting Biden and Trump.
Uh no, like I was telling him, nice try  No one said Biden is worse, but liberals refusing to accept that Biden helped build what trump is doing, and other democrats helping trump, it's ludicrous to think that voting for what helped give us Trump, would fix what he's done.
I know, Bidens past absolutely plays into why we have trump now, and refusing to accept that blatant part of history doesn't help anyone.
Yeah, and Biden helped trump, Biden and Obama in office helped pave the way for trump and for what Trump has been able to do, yes, Biden and Obama both helped
But I love how you purposefully missed the point because you don't want to actually accept the fact that Biden is why we have trump, and why Trump's been able to do what he has
Or don't vote for racists that gave Trump all of what he's been doing.
Yes I'm so condescending with speaking the truth. If you actually paid attention to rose Twitter, your actually know what they're thinking. Biden paved the way for trump to do what he's been doing, democrats in office have helped trump do what he's doing. Stop fooling yourself.
But Biden paved the way for trump to do that, you cannot fix the issues with the person that propped up the system that allowed the injustices to happen.
Oh bless your heart again. Biden set it up for trump to do that, Biden and Obama killed black and brown people  If you actually paid attention to what rose Twitter was saying, you'd actually understand that Trump killing minorities is a big issue
Yeah they’re making the trump vaccine. I’ll wait for a non film maker to come up with one
Why are trump properties still standing?
No one is pretending anything, voting for either trump or Biden isn't a vote for progress.
'whatever your problem is, let it go' maybe the problem is just eating the shit sandwich given to us by the DNC, and people maybe don't want to keep eating it, when there are other options. If people don't vote for Biden, or Trump, neither earned it, and it's on them
There is another option with voting, and it doesn't include voting for both republicans. Your tweet was shaming 'if you think trump isn't trying to kill you' bla bla bla. If someone doesn't vote, then the politicians didn't earn the vote, and there isn't anything wrong with it
W looked great. Many people have said so. Perhaps  could do do it better. You never know. Trump could possibly throw the most beautiful pitch anyone has ever seen. The bat boy will run out &amp; say “Sir, great pitch, Sir.” We’ll just have to wait and see. We’ll see.
Twitter will pay for every stupid thing they are trying to pull off it's just a matter of time.I can't wait to watch the Democratic, libral parties implode all this rioting isn't because of trump it's because most of the people are low life scum that have no desire to work
If Trump gives in on mail in voting, it’s fair to say that he will use this as exit strategy post election. He will threaten to fight result bc of mail in voting fraud but then will make a deal with Biden/gang of 8 to walk away for guarantee pardon by Pence in lame duck session.
Also please note that she said Michael Brown was murdered by a white cop. She lied when she said that and knowingly lied. She lied to fan the flames of racial division for her own benefit. That sounds a lot like Donald Trump.
To Suppress Video Of Doctors Countering Pandemic Fear, Big Tech Even Censored President Trump  via  First Projects
You are so wrong. Trump loves this country, he loves our soldiers. Obama did everything to weaken them so they couldn't even fight without fear of going to prison for nabbing the enemies. Obama and the Clintons should hang. Get your facts straight.
Trump supporters call themselves the “silent majority”, but NEVER SHUT THE FUCK UP
I’m sure Trump would gladly give e an interview with CNN and the rest if they showed him just an ounce of respect!
Are u crazy!!! If there were any truth to this trump wound be in jail.  Fake news and everyone knows it!
Portland and Seattle will re-elect Trump. The headlines should read” Spoiled white brats and AntiFa work the streets for Trumps re-election.”
Yes.  Just a total farce!  I’m disgusted at their behavior and how they do not care about the United States but only their vandetta against Trump!
Liberals are destroying the PNW and will re-elect Trump.
Bullshit. Liberals are destroying the PMW and will re-elect Trump.
I was on tour, in midwest and east coast, right before the 2016 election. I seen Trump signs everywhere in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Maryland and all the way down the east coast. Michigan and Pennsylvania had the most.
She can’t be trusted but not for the reason you’re alluding to. She said Michael Brown was murdered by a white cop. It was a lie, check the Washington Post.  She lied to fan the flames of racial unrest to her benefit. Sounds sort of like Donald Trump doesn’t it?
Nope.
Time to move if you live in a trump building
Trump supporters can spout conspiracy theories all they want. There ain't no way the state of Texas is inflating the number of their COVID deaths for political reasons. Shit if anything, they'd be downplaying that.   What? Grandma had COVID and COPD? Well it was clearly the COPD.

Trump needs to pay. He is a disgrace!!
Here is an article you may have missed.
No, you judge me by creating the appearance of things that you say I say, which I do not.  That is your mistake, but a common practice of the left.  Yes, we do agree that lawful protesting is a right and is protected by the first amendment.   Trump agrees with this as well, &amp; DOJ
Larry's just another has been that's now a #Trump bootlicker.
Never saw #Obama golf as much as #Trump, did you?
tRump could not have created the destruction without #MoscowMitch and #GOP backing. The drafters of the Constitution did not foresee a complicit branch in the checks and balances system. #GOP has comprised all three branches. The voters must fix it or lose it. #VoteBlue
I'm curious about something.   What are your views of the Trump decisions on Israel?  Jerusalem being the Jewish capital.   Establishing our embassy in Jerusalem.   And the other things he's done for Israel?
There trying to turn it into a Street war, cause as much damage as possible,  have all the people in the city’s turn against  One another, And then blame President Trump. That’s how sick, The radical left is. They care about politics not the people!!!!!  Wicked Nancy Pelosi,
Hey  friend, you are right about Biden getting more of the black vote.  The thing you fail to realize is that more blacks than ever before are leaving the Democrats and voting Republican.  All Trump needs is an additional 5% of the black vote from 2016 to win!  Chuckles and smile
had to walk through an anti-mask, pro-life, gun crazy, trump supporting protest today. no.
Is the reason Seattle and Portland keep getting rejected due to legal challenges by Federal judges because they are Trump's judges?
Very proud of them!! We need Trump and his cronies in office out so we can succeed.
Google: (any city) coronavirus young adults.  Not a Trump demographic.  Young people are not wearing masks nor practicing social distancing for social, not political, reasons. Until Several weeks after they do we are screwed.
Trump has been horrible and I wish he was the explanation for how bad we’ve done.  In Spokane, Seattle, Oregon, Los Angeles, orange county, Houston, Austin, Chicago, New York City, Philadelphia, DC, Atlanta young adults are a disproportionate and or spiking share of c19 new cases
Donald Trump has wrecked our economy.
Trump appoints judges across US so he can control. Wonder if Putin was behind this?
So are we just stopping to double standards now? Look what I think Trump has done for the economy and middle class are phenomenal, but are we really gonna sit back and not acknowledge the fact that he wished #GhislaineMaxwell well, not one post from any of the hundreds..
Mmmmkay. I've seen Biden, Trump, Warren etc supporters say something against it. I follow so many accounts with a rose in it, but couldn't figure out what was so bad about it.
Stop listening to Trump lies people. He is dangerous and should be removed. If we don't get rid of him now it will be too late.
Ah, the condescending attitude of the elderly. There isn't much of a difference between Trump and Biden, and Biden helped build the system that gave us Trump. Wouldn't it be great if politicians actually earned our votes, though? Whoever does win in November, it won't be us.
This is crazy. Does the outrageous conduct by Trump make the violent criminals active in Portland good?
This is exactly how the election will go, although this is not the only plot the Dirty Democrats have up their sleeve.  When it becomes obvious that the election was rigged and Trump refuses to accept the results, they will say that they were right about him refusing to leave.
I feel like all we are going to get out of this is a note written in sharpie from the aliens saying we need to vote for Trump to save the universe since he did such a good job finding the elephant on his dementia test  #ufo #Biden2020

Quite literally Trumps America. In fact, he sends violent unidentified federal agents into peaceful protests to give the appearance of violent protest. Trump is fabricating this violence so idiots like you tweet stupid shit like this...#WorstPresidentEver
Geezer, I'm in trouble with Twitter for calling you beautiful.  That is a name.  It is polite unlike the president with Warren,  but something tells me Warren has uttered a few choice names for trump too. Human nature is sometimes positive, but negative also from the same source.
Omg!   😂😂😂 really! I think I have heard it all now!  Trump is after them not because they are female but because they are not tho king clearly on behalf of really what needs to happen!
The Democrats are saying you won’t except the election because they are going to cheat at the elections!  This is another set up mr. Trump and you need to call them out on it, please?
Doesn’t take a Sherlock Holmes to figure out that the Democrats are setting up Trump by saying he won’t except the election results because they’re going to cheat at the election in many ways to steal this election from Trump! Fact!
Would like to remind everyone that this war in the US that Trump started is not over. Democrats could loose but unlikely. Biden has a 15% lead on Trump. People are tired of Trump's lie after lie and his temper tantrums. In the long run this will hurt Trump more.
It’s none of our business! American military will take their orders from this president and do what HE says, if PUTIN wants anarchy then so be it! God protect PUTIN and TRUMP! American hero’s.
Thought the world learned from Hitler. One thing I have learned since Trump became President when a Democrat does something wrong they own it, apologize and other Democrats do not support them. Now when Republican does something wrong with this administration they lie about it.
Just ashamed of how folks are acting. I know we’re in Trump country but fuck
I’ll bet anyone $100 that Biden will not debate Trump live in anyway shape or form! Anybody?$$$ if he did it would expose his mental problems.
Come on Biden I dare you to debate Trump
and not saying trump is a full blown fascist because that just wouldn’t be true, all i know is that he speaks just like all of the other devastating fascist leaders did and even if it’s unintentional it’s extremely detrimental in terms of division and truth.
This is BS. The people of Portland and Portland Police need to stand with their mayor or become Trump &amp; Putin puppets. Do the right thing not the easy way out.
September 2016: “As president, I will establish the national goal of providing school choice to every American child living in poverty.”
Good for Barbara Walters for standing up to Trump. Let's get the crazy man out of office!
Trump will be pardoned under the guise of “Healing The Nation”. Centrist BS that got us here
Yes but Putin is in charge of this investigation. That should tell them something! This is Trump's war on his on people to win the election. They need to come up with a plan to have Trump arrested and removed. He is unfit to continue being President.
Trump is unstable &amp; needs to be removed immediately!
I’ve done a ton of dementia screens. Both Biden and Trump should have a dementia work-up that includes MRI and a standardized mental status exam. The results should be released to the public and done at the same academic center.
Come on now. Untrue and WE ALL know it, so do you! Trump is getting his strategy to call the election like Putin did. All we need is a few full apartment buildings to be imploded and Viola. No election!
And the same people who screamed about Obama declaring Marshall law during his last year in office are strangely quiet about Trump sending in troops to cities with different political ideologies... Where's all these "militias" that claim to be ready to fight government tyranny...
Trump is the one doing this right now! Are you kidding me. #TrumpsGestapo
Meanwhile, this is happening in Trump’s America.
I can’t stand Trump but the fact is that part of the annual physical for anyone on Medicare includes a cognitive test. The problem with Trump is he’s morally corrupt and completely incompetent.
The mayor needs to call the police and tell them to stop any orders that Trump ask.
Can't watch tRump on the TV - Can't watch a sleazeball mobster who cares nothing about America or American's ...he's so frickin stupid, speaks like a 3rd grader....lies, lies, lies...anything to keep himself in power. It's like a third-world country!!! STOP believing the LIE!
trump is sending feds into cities, people yell 'they're sending feds to suppress free speech', but maybe theyre sending in feds because murder is up like 200% in some of these cities
I disavow in advance any violence done in the name of Q and/or Trump.  This movement is about promoting truth and peace.   [They]/The DS/etc. always has and always will commit violence in others' name in order to censor the truth.  It won't work this time.
using the death of a 4 year old to criminal violence as a ramp to do the skateboard trick of 'muh suppression of peaceful protest' to own trump is some fucked up shit
Trump can count back from 100 by 7’s if he uses 1’s 7 times.
same people screaming for mask enforcements are screaming trump is a fascist for enforcing laws against murder

Anger gives Trump power!
Hitler did. Anger is how Trump does this. He is a pathological liar. Some believe him and some don't. His temper (anger) is what helps him win. It frightens people to do what he wants so it makes him feel powerful. He probably learned  this from a early age.
If you cared about children or really anything good, you wouldn't support trump  If you wanted peace, you wouldn't support someone that looks up to dictators.
Ok trump has a mask, let’s re-elect him. All good
#Biden2020 every politician needs to earn their votes. #trump actually earns the votes from conservatives while democrats just demand that everyone votes for Biden.
Trump is creating a war in the United States. I am disabled but I will not back down to this dictator who has almost destroyed our country. He is coward who wants to put fear in us. He is attempting to take over cause he knows he can't win the election. He has to go.
It’s moot. AntiFa and anti-open schoolers are going to get Trump re-elected.
You are powerful in this! The world knows Trump is a liar but what helps Trump is his ANGER. It helps him feel powerful and helps him win. Some people feel like it makes them loose control but it's a healthy emotion. Use your anger win needed! Your the winner
Yes it is! Trump does it to give himself power. We need to as well.
You can't trust them. Trump is a narcissist and wants power. That's why he lies and gets angry. That's what helps him win! He knows this!We need to get angry back. Most people don't like to get angry because it makes them feel like they are loosing control.
