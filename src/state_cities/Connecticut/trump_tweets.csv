And Romneycare limited pre-existing conditions to 6-mo.  Obama took a GOP plan and made it better. Trump has tried to destroy what Obama did, and in the case of pre-existing conditions, trying to take credit for a signature Obama/Romney achievement.
These morons only know they want the opposite of what president trump is doing. Even if they look like hypocritical jackasses. Smh . We really need to drain that swamp. VOTE TRUMP 2020!
What do the headstones say.... we “_______Trump”
Kayne  &amp; tRump are friends because they are both bipolar and have the same maniac episodes.
And here is the Donald Trump statement in support of Donald Trump.
The ratios are so extreme on D’Souza’s tweets that you’d almost think he was here with the purpose of undermining Trump.
More than likely
What scares me is black trump supporters getting shot or stabbed
So you're praising Pres. Obama? Cool. How about all the lawsuits by trump admin/gop trying to get rid of it? Will those go away now?
Fuck Trump 2020💯
Trump travels to the Piazza d’Espagna in Rome and eats at the McDonalds
At this point investigating Trump’s crimes would constitute a massive jobs program on par with the WPA.
Cool, Trump supporters voluntarily die and survivors file false mail in ballots.  Deep false admin #TrumpResignNow
Well trump is buddy buddy with Putin so no surprise there
The damage to our country has already been done. Radicals used Floyd's death as an excuse to implement their radical Marxist agenda. Above all, it's all right before an election they would have ordinarily lost. But get this: Donald J Trump never loses, ever! Better luck next time
Complaining about his family and didn’t he get a call from Lara Trump to work  He is a fraud
Dems throughout Trump’s presidency: “You guys we need a great candidate to take down Trump in 2020!”  Dems in 2020: “Ladies and Gentlemen, Joe Biden!”  fml  #Election2020
1/2 of the US government was more into trying to come up with shit to try to get Trump Impeached than caring for the virus.  Europe was and still dealing with the virus and they knew about it also.
Wow now you are campaigning for Biden!  Interesting.  What are the reasons you believe he’s a “good catholic”? You like to disparage trump but Biden is a “good Catholic “ He supports the mutilization of babies, especially partial birth abortion. I’d like him to denounce abortion.
Trump: Slow dooown the testing!  Also Trump: Slow dooown the voting!
And to make it a true daily double Fuck everyone who voted for Trump too 🌈🇵🇷🇺🇸🇨🇦

Trump is a Pediofile
Your the JOKE trump what a fool
If they still support trump after almost 4yrs, there is zero chance you can convince them otherwise. Either they love his horribleness or have invested too much to convince themselves he's something he isn't. They'll never give up on him. You're nuts if you think otherwise.
They’ve never stop trashing Democrats Trump does it every day 🌈👊🏻🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊
Trump “children are immune to #COVID__19 , reporter “how do you know that”, Trump “read the medical reports 🌈👊🏻🇺🇸🇨🇦🇵🇷
It is only dangerous to Biden’s election prospects, that is what the media actually means when they call HCQ dangerous. If Trump liked lollipops those would be consideted very dangerous by the media too.
This is entertaining...imagine if Trump called a black anchor a junkie...the galaxy would be in meltdown.
Hope we treat you as badly as Trump voters have been treated.  God is watching
Don’t tell Trump, he’ll start hawking it
Because he’s being a responsible leader and setting a good example unlike the Trump the Moron in Chief.
We should have to hold them all accountable Trump is killing people and they are supporting it 🌈👊🏻🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊
FUCK TRUMP and everyone who voted for him too🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌈🇨🇦🇺🇸🇵🇷

It’s starts so much hate for republicans and democratic trump you keep your little friend and Obama keep your little podcast
Biden has a point. Just because Trump is a doddering fool, doesn’t mean that every candidate needs to now take a cognitive test.

Yeap Baby Trump
IF YOU SUPPORT TRUMP... that is your opinion and you are entitled to it.   IF YOU SUPPORT BIDEN... that is your opinion and you are entitled to it.  Stop name calling random people bc of their beliefs. You’re just spreading the hate. Focus on the real problems around you first.

People are ridiculous they gettin on Joe Biden because of what he said about the test and Coke! well let me tell you something Trump ruined this country Trump helped  COVID-19 to spread Trump didn’t open those emails and nobody’s talking about that and he’s the one in office 🙄
Just because he is different then the previous Presidents doesn't mean he's not putting the United States 1st.  The problem is, people don't like change.  They are used to certain type of characteristics and President Trump is completely different and people don't like that.
They threw a kid out of a Trump rally last year for making that exact same face.
Live long enough to see Trump go to jail 🌈👊🏻
Also did you even take the time to read the article? It’s people selling Trump merchandise outside rallies &amp; not in his control. I can buy a Biden T-shirt made in China too. Like I said, Trump merchandise sold on his website is made in America.

Where was this purchased? Like I said, ALL merchandise sold on the Trump website is made in America. Stop pushing false information.
Every interview of Donald Trump proves my point that he’s actually a fucking moron
The Axios interview isn't just a great example of how ignorant and uncaring Trump is, but how insulated he is from actual facts. He's been reduced to a staff that insulates him from actual briefings that might upset him. They feed him little bits of good news so he can feel good
So true. Swan fully peeled back the Trump* skullcap.
We don’t have to count Trump*s lies in the Axios interview because Daniel Dale does it for us.   (I hope you’re getting hazard pay.)
And this is how history will remember Donald Trump*.
Now taking bets that Trump will not attend Biden's inauguration.
Trump is a train wreck
So does Donald J Trump. #DumpTrump2020
All products on the Trump website are made in the USA. He cannot stop scum from buying and selling products with his name.
Thank you Secretary Pompeo and President Trump.
Repeat after me: Trump is taking away your mail service.
I’m all for trump, however wtf happened to the “invisible enemy”? All the sudden it doesn’t exist? Like how are we supposed to know when to start acting normal when the top 1% controls everything?
You can make this up. Hysterical 😭 🤣🤣. Please retweet. Trump is going to have a meltdown. Please let this go viral.
One thing the polls show is Trump running BEHIND Biden and AHEAD of most Congressional Republicans. Certainly a scenario like this is possible, but the leverage should be write the best bill.
He’s not Trump and has a good head on his shoulders. Not a jerk or bimbo like Donny
When Trump said this he was criticized for not recognizing today’s global economy
Put something behind the talk.   Trump is taking away your mail.
I honestly believe what goes around comes around. tRump will not make it to Nov 3rd due to some unbeknownst reason. I can feel that vibe from the full moon.

Of course they blame TRUMP They also blame the gun and the gun maker.(GET IT)
Trump wil kill us all
I am all alone in my family being anti-trump. Even my hairdresser is a trump supporter . It gets exhausting at times. Just had to get that off my chest.
Howard Stern speaks the truth: “The oddity in all of this is the people  despises most, love him the most.  The people who are voting for Trump for the most part...he wouldn’t even let them in a f*cking hotel. He’d be disgusted by them.”
He chose not to run in ‘16 because he didn’t feel the “fire in the belly” you need. Right now, he’s running because he (rightly) sees himself as the anti-Trump. He’s not going to run in ‘24.
Or: TRUMP LIES MAIL DIES.
Everyone that made fun of President Bush and called him dumb should apologize. TRump is the dictionary definition of dumb.
Why are they not talking about Donny's times w Epstein?? Since u wanna throw dirt?? What about good ole Donny Trump, biggest scumbag of dm all and his crybaby family , all of u crying all the time
Hey Trump so if baseball players are testing positive for #Covid_19 playing out doors  how are school children gonna be safe in a closed environment ?🌈🇵🇷🇺🇸🇨🇦
It’s a proven statistical fact that countries that are governed by Women, have the best success rates for the COVID-19 pandemic. These women took swift and preventative measures for stopping the spread. tRump hasn’t even been able to spell pandemic
Shorter version: Trump can’t lead, so in Trumplandia, we’re F’d.
Just in case it’s not unanimous for Trump*? Weak.
The new Trump 2020 Campaign ad  is going to give poorJoe Biden fits!
Trump golfs while 1000 people a day are dying from COVID-19
And you still don't want to vote for Donald J. Trump who  believes and figths for our rights and the American Constitution  decisive day  November 3, I hope we know how to choose well
Thanks! Trump 2020 🇺🇸
I'm not saying Obama didn't create the foundation of course, but Trump must also deserve credit for making   a priority for his administration...overall the United States is the real winner here and all the credit must be given  to
Trump was on one of Epstein's flight log in 1997 traveling from Fla to NY. He was never on a flight log to the island and no one has ever claimed they had saw Trump on the island
I'm up to here with pro-birth nonsense. Behind the pusillanimous verbiage is a man as lacking in morals as Trump.   When you go to your final reward, it may not be the one you expect.
So this didn't happen?
Trump’s polemical statements
Who said I didn't hate trump?
Believe half of what you see and nothing of what you hear.Proven in only three and half years BEST PRESIDENT EVER ,Even with all the crap being thrown at him, has done more than professional POLITICIANS!!!!Trump landslide 2020.
My guess is  that once Biden picks his VP #Harris Trump will drop Pence 🌈🇺🇸🇵🇷🇨🇦
UNAFFILIATED PRESIDENT TRUMP VOTER!!!!
What do you think Trump puts in his omelette 😂😂😂😂😂😂🌈👊🏻
Nominees aren't present for the nomination speeches and vote, so Trump doesn't care. He'll certainly have the press cover his acceptance speech.
this man rlly thought he did something  here “trump isn’t racist it’s been proven” shut the fuck up
Again the people of Puerto Rico take another hit and Trump is golfing , remember when he said “ only 15 to 16 people died during the last  hurricane  , it turn out to be 3,000 , just like #COVID19 cases “We only have  a dozen case or so , 150,000 dead  🌈🇵🇷🇨🇦
Thought for the day like Hillary said ,” what happens when Trump get that 3am call“ , please leave a message after the beep #FUCKTRUMP🌈🇵🇷🇺🇸🇨🇦
We must not allow Trump to sacrifice our children by opening up schools to satisfy his ego , thousands of Americans have died under his watch and he takes no responsibility #SAVEOURCHILDREN 🌈🇺🇸🇵🇷🇨🇦
It’s almost like they want to be caught. 🤔
Trolling Trump* from the Beyond.  RIP
Have this weird feeling... Trump gonna walk clean from this Epstein shit &amp; we still will never know the truth / who really was there
We love you Dear President Trump 💕
Show proof people are suffering because of President Trump and not because of CHINESE VIRUS and the Democrats they are to blame.PROVE ME WRONG
Is there anything more frustrating that the left overplaying their hatred of Trump to the point where I have to defend him?
Sandernistas: Biden must adopt M4A, ban cars, end the police and make Nina Turner his Veep in order to win the youth vote.   Trump: I’m banning TikTok.
Can you imagine that if they didn’t show up. Holy shit tRump would go nuts literally. He’d have a breakdown on stage.
Don’t be surprised when an Alien bursts out of Trump’s chest at his next Rally
hydroxychloroquine - we need more of this magical Trump elixir
Old enough to recall when Trump* said he’d be too busy running the country to play golf (jab aimed at Obama). This mendacious imposter has 90+ days left in office.
He sounds like Trump 🌈👊🏻
Mutliple witnesses have testified in depositions that they never saw Trump at the island, at his home in New Mexico or at his home in NYC
I think my ten year old sister would make a better president than Trump tbh
Tik tok users bought tickets for some trump rally, didn’t show up, and now he wants tik tok gone... someone’s feelings are hurt🥺🥺
Trump* always been Trump*. This time around, he’s got his record to run on. America, hope you’re paying attention now.
It’s an obvious play on Trump*s part. Now journos should put their time into getting every GOOPer on the record why this is undemocratic &amp; impeachable.
All jokes aside... can trump actually ban tiktok?
You mean if a pet had a tRump
I think  has trump on the ropes 🤣
Trump says he’s going to ban TikTok as of Saturday but as of right now TikTok is still up so let’s hope this ban isn’t real 😢😢
That's one of the reasons trump is trying to build the wall
donald trump is the equivalent of a kid not wanting to give up being line leader
Giving out free money to people who don’t want to get up and work never worked for this country everyone was on welfare before trump because the Dems love hand outs and they will keep giving hand outs not when trumps in office the Dems are clearly out of there minds
Wrong your so slow he creates jobs jobs jobs  of course he don’t want people to sit around and collect welfare like you go get a job trump brought factories back just because your on welfare and don’t want to go to work stop this crying out for free money
Fuck Trump and his supporters
Wait so trump is really gonna ban tiktok? 🤣
Fuck You Trump but I hope Microsoft buys it before it happens
ion use that shit so ion give a hoot it’s still fuck trump tho
Trump's Tiktok ban will work about as well as Herman Cain's homemade COVID remedies.
Would it surprise you to learn Trump squashed a national unified plan against #COVID19 because he saw the infection as a “Blue State” problem, &amp; he could blame Dem state Governors?  How Jared Kushner’s Secret Testing Plan “Went Poof Into Thin Air”

Killing off a few hundred thousand Democrats in blue states? #Trump relished the idea.
It is fucking insane that our country struggles with the most basic, elementary concepts.  This #BAFTAs Trump sucking Governor is literally killing his constituents.   Floridians, get this guy out before he destroys FL.
But children are “almost immune”* to coronavirus.  *Trump

Maybe we should vote by mail by the time they straighten out all the fraud PRESIDENT TRUMP will remain in office probably till 2030 I'm fine with that.
Is it true that tRump wants to postpone the elections??  He can’t do that right??
As long as Trump is gone they could put in Mickey Mouse for all I care 🌈👊🏻
PURE EVIL RIGHT HERE! CNN is garbage and Obama is a disgrace. People downfall President Trump. They need to really look at the ONE Savage who has ruined this country. That Scum is EVIL! You’ll all be regretting the devil himself
Trump is a Joke ,god help this country if he wins again
Pres Trump reportedly to order China's Bytedance to sell its TikTok US operations - press - Its not know if the US will ask Bytedance to sell TikTok US ops outright or if it will allow other changes to its ownership structure. - US govt announcement could come as soon as today-
Were they big Trump fans?
I think there’s 0 coincidence that Clinton and Trump are both “entangled” with #Epstein #EpsteinDidntKillHimself #EpsteinIsStillAlive
Did see it covered but zero evidence, right now, that it is for his trump support. Could be but they don't know. But thanks for playing my fake indignation &amp; opinions mean more than facts.
We’re Jarrod he said the economy was going to be booming by summer why is he not speaking cuz he’s a dumb shit like Trump
Meaning stop hating on Trump
Probably another Trump lawsuit in our future…
Captured to a tee. Trump, a wannabe tough guy, who was neutered psychically by his father, longs for acceptance from substitute father strong men.
Turdley. Old enough to remember his testifying for Trump during the Impeachment.
They had no masks, trump signs, and even the god damn confederate flag 🤢🤮
Of all the hills that Trump wants you to die on - you chose this one? Lots of hills, Adam.
Like the peaceful transfer to Trump!

“Given the wild pace of events, McCabe couldn't be sure how long he'd last as director, so he wanted to lock down as much evidence as possible.”

Trump is already interfering with our elections  🌈🇵🇷🇺🇸🇨🇦
Trump doesn't joke #trumprecession
Biden is creepy. But I'd vote for mickey mouse at this point. Anyone but trump.
Good pt: bc Trump* is incapable of doing his job, his chaos is replacement artifact. Also, he’s evil.
Herman Cain gave his life to #Trump - dies of -#COVID19 after Tulsa no mask rally.  Now you can join Herman too, leave masks home, go to a bar,  large crowds - or if you’re in a hurry, attend a Trump rally
Trump doesn't give a shit if anyone dies  - we are all disposable pawns
Inconceivable that apparently functioning people could get caught up in this ridiculous nonsense. Really?? Trump is sending secret signals? He's the Prez, what's taking him so long? Really people, put on your thinking caps and re-enter reality!
I feel sorry for his family ,but l don’t feel sorry for him he won’t to the Tulsa  trump campaign rally talked about not believing the coronavirus no protection and it got him rip
You must be blind or something because clearly China sent the virus over and if Obama Biden has the stock pile full we wouldn’t have been in this mess also George Floyd has nothing to do with trump also blm is a horrible bunch of terroist
You just talk stupid black lives matter destroyed us and China if it wasn’t for black lives matter and China everything will be golden trump is the best president of my life time and that is a fact ... China created the virus and blm created these fires that are burning
. knows his Trump*.
Add Herman Cain dead of COVID19  does that GOP thesis that its liek the flu still hold true?  #Trump is so fucked
Sine Trump said “she’s  so smart “  maybe she can explain why this virus is killing so many black Americans 🌈👊🏻
What an idiot  Trump suggesting to delay elections - I think there 50/50 chance he bails out in next 30 days
#Trump wants nothing to do with hard work  What is he facing?  -huge debt  -Faltering economy / unemployment   -Out of control pandemic   -Stockmarket about to hit free fall  -Aliens
Hmm,and they are WOMEN how sexist of President Trump
Of course Trump is RIGHT how can a person CHEAT if SAID person has to show I D to cast their VOTE?? So please tell me why President TRUMP is AGAINST mail in VOTING if he's the cheater.Everyone must be for VOTER I. D.
US Army presence in Germany is to protect Europe and Asia in the event of military actions from Russia or other aggressive groups. You have. Pulling these troops out leaves Germany and other countries vulnerable to violence and wars.  tRump is a moron
So he will move to Trump Tower and charge us rent?
Vote for trump 2020
Not me and not the world Biden is shot his brain is gone he won’t be running anything they will have people behind him running this country we need one leader that’s trump
Trump did something for our country he created the most jobs of any other president he stood up to China when joes son hunter went missing because they stole money millions from other countries Biden had 1 million black kids killed when he was in office
Facts also he will never debate with trump
He cant even debate trump what does that tell you he is incompetent
Trump is perfect to lead if it wasn’t for democrats holding up this country and this president this country would be golden it sucks because the democrats are horrible people and I’m afraid most people who comments here is misinformed
We always need trump

Go ahead vote joe he will have every factory that trump brought here gone to China China will take over the world just like they did when Obama was in for 8 years everyone was on welfare they give hand outs o jobs created all the money in BIDENS pocket and Obama pocket
Yeah right you must be a welfare collector because everyone was broke for 8 years when Obama was in there were no factories there were no jobs your out of your mind trump created millions more jobs in his 3 years then Obama did in 8
Omg I pray every night that trump wins because if not we are fucked we are gonna be fucked if Biden gets in
You need to grow a brain dude it’s very clear that the democrats want power and they want to ruin this country mark my words if Biden gets in your gonna pray for trump to come back
Trump created more jobs then any other president and it’s not trump trump wants people back to work while the democrats want to keep work closed and schools closed because a China virus that trump saved millions of people of it was up to the Dems they were in New York dancing
Get the hell outta here trump saved America
DEAR  you have to stop banning and covering up for the democrats and stop removing videos about COVID 19 this is suppose to be a free speech place and you are trying to make trump lose the election so stop before trump bans this social media site all together
If I was trump I would ban twitter and you tube and Facebook these big tech companies clearly don’t want you to win
Texas man called #COVID19 a ‘hoax’ ( like #Trump did) until family gathering led to 14 infections, 1 death and his partner’s relatives rejecting his help
You said it right on T, when u put that hat on your life doesn’t matter. It’s despicable how hypocritical these people are. To the left nobody that supports Trump life matters. Only thing that matters is their bullshit sham agenda, got nothing to do with caring about black lives
If you support trump retweet this cause I’m trying to see something
I think their FBI flunkies that spied on the Trump campaign are more reminiscent of secret police don’t you?
To defeat Trump and the America he is trying to restore and preserve.
Trump, trump family &amp; trump companies all getting rich on our dime. He’s laughing all the way to the bank. He needs to be stopped!!

TRUMP 2020! Hell I’d vote for a third term if that was possible! 😂🇺🇸
His supporters - not his critics -- are the ones who are often less educated, not financially secure, and in general more vulnerable to his bullshit. My cat is more sophisticated than Trump.
Interestingly enough, I'm Jewish and I think this was likely just stupid not intended the way it appears. You'd have to be on the level of Donald Trump to so brazenly give a Nazi salute with people and cameras around

ngl I’m okay with Trump banning tiktok.
After your interview with trump is a pattern developing?
TikTok, WeChat could be banned by Trump executive orders
Trump administration imposed sanctions on senior Chinese Communist Party officials &amp; their Hong Kong allies, including chief executive Carrie Lam, over their role in cracking down on political dissent in the former British territory.  #China #CCP #ChinaUS

Trump about Biden “he’s against god and guns”. It seems those two words shouldn’t be in the same sentence unless you move the position of the word against: God against guns.

Microsoft in the News: "Trump Bans Dealings With Chinese Owners of TikTok, WeChat" by The Associated Press via NYT
You are right, Trump’s approach to governing is similar to Adolf Hitler’s
'First Trump came for TikTok, but I don't use it. Then he came for WeChat, but I'm not Chinese. He's been calling our press the Enemy of the People. Should I be concerned?'
Why is Trump banning #TikTok and #WeChat? It's a test to help him determine how to ban US-based news apps and sites with which he disagrees.  Dangerous moves against not only China but all of us.

More of Trumps “Embraced Patriotism”.
More embraced patriotism. “Trump knowingly gave aid and comfort to Russian despot Vladimir Putin by turning a blind eye to Russia placing “bounties” on the lives of our American servicemen and women fighting in Afghanistan.”
Yeah right.
If Trump delivered on his promise to bring home the troops, there would be a LOT of people out of work. Quite a few lawmakers get campaign contributions from military contractors.

Some employees at the U.S. Forest Service felt pressured to speed up their reviews of pipeline projects. For the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, that meant playing down its impact on protected species and the danger it posed to steep, landslide-prone slopes.

P.S. I’m not defending Dinesh — quite the opposite — pointing out that the pronunciation in a region that literally doesn’t use equivalent sounds is dumb. In Bogota, people called me “Acha” (which means “ax”) bc there is no “sh” sound in Spanish. Trump doing that would be wrong.
You mean the current president trump is also a rapist
5. Last time I checked, Trump neither speaks a South Asian language nor has an Indian accent, so why is this a point of comparison??? In fact, MAGAs tell my parents to “speak real English” because they have an accent (and though they speak it perfectly), so same applies to Trump?
This is true, though it’s because the hard “t” in most Indian languages is different than the one used in English (more below), and it would be unnatural in the Indian accent. They also pronounce “w”s as “v”s and refer to toast as “bread toast” which I assume Trump doesn’t do 1/

Kidding me, I guess Geraldo didn't watch any of the Debates between Biden &amp; Ryan! He cremated Ryan in the Debates and Ryan is more intelligent then Trump!  Guess Geraldo is just getting forgetful in his old age....

Paul Krugman says he’s done the math — and the risk Trump and McConnell pose to the economy is ‘terrifying’
If Kanye West's name is on your ballot when you go into the booth this November and you cast your vote for him, you pretty much chose to re-elect President Trump.
What this means, in context:   1) Putin is working to help Trump win—again.  2) Russian cutouts are weaponizing private calls—as they did in 2016, with private emails.  3) Russia is seeking to "boost" Trump on social media—again.  4) Our election systems are exposed—still.
23. Even if that never happens, the mere possibility of it happening would be enough, in the age of Donald Trump, to supercharge Democratic turnout, fueling a landslide election, which is probably the only thing that would push Trump out of office.
20. That’s voting for someone who will have no impact, which means Cupp’s opposition to Trump isn’t serious, which means a column about how much depends on Biden’s pick is just striking a pose.
19. To the extent that she insists that writing in a candidate is legitimate, I don’t know what to say, because that’s not voting against Trump.
16. They are voting *against* Trump, which means Biden himself is a secondary thought, which means his running mate is a tertiary thought—if they’re thinking about vice presidents at all, which is unlikely.
12. For the curious, Cupp likes Kamala Harris, dislikes Susan Rice. It would be interesting if Cupp were to say Harris could ignite the Democratic base, especially Black Democrats and Democrats of color, thus doing the most to ensure Trump’s defeat in a tidal wave.
9. In her latest, she said the choice between voting for Biden and a write-in candidate (she’s against Trump) depends on Biden’s choice of a running mate.
5. NG: He wants to create fear, uncertainty and doubt so that people feel frozen and paralyzed, and then the man of action, Trump himself, can ride in and seize the day.”
2. We are entering a dangerous period fraught with instability and apprehension as well as potential for violence and bloodshed. Donald Trump is most likely to contest anything that’s short of a landslide for Joe Biden.
There is nothing surprising here. But it should make us feel better that the apparatus of government is working despite Trump's efforts to suppress it.
Donald Trump is not the one who decided to reopen states too early. It was state governors.  had no control over that. It’s called federalism.
On Election Day 2016, Russian trolls were alleging that the vote would be rigged, and the White House was bracing for Putin’s hackers to cause chaos at polling places.   The Russian objective is not just to help Trump. It’s also to undermine public confidence in our elections.

agreed. And it's not limited to Ams (white or black), but a cross-cultural phenomenon. e.g. I wrote about how contemporary Chinese liberal intellectuals project their anxieties &amp; perspectives to Am, drawing incredibly wrong conclusions &amp; idolizing Trump
The order said that TikTok is owned by a Chinese company and could hand over personal information about users to the Chinese government.
We don't think Trump killed them, his ineptitude killed them and people like you who take your facts from a failed reality TV personality.  No common sense or compassion for others.  People are FUCKING DYING in droves!  But wearing a mask is unpatriotic, right?  I'll wait...
Does Trump have Covid-19?
Depends on how far we go in viewing FDR, not as proto-LBJ, but as leader of a white working man’s movement, many of whose members generations later vote Trump. No doubt it is easier for the Dems to achieve a class party today-but it is not destiny.
Trump denounced for ‘attempt to gut Social Security’ after he announces plan to unilaterally suspend payroll tax
Sorry. By "optimistic," I meant that Trump would agree to give up power. I don't think he will. I don't think he'll recognize a Biden win even if it's a landslide.
And Trump’s only line of attack against Biden is that he’ll “hurt the Bible and hurt God”?  Yeah, Trump’s flailing in his attempts to run against Biden.  He was primed for Bernie or Liz.
You can tell by what Trump is saying  That he really wanted to be running against Bernie or Liz  And we should all be grateful he isn’t
Do we really have to debate how incredibly stupid Donald Trump is?  I mean, if you can’t acknowledge that the man-child is a moron, that’s says so much about you as a person.

You should 100% vote for who you want to vote for. I understand &amp; respect that. I do. All I’m saying is the cold reality is that person will not win this election if it’s not Biden or Trump. And if you’re not a hardcore Republican voter, that vote will favor Trump.
Surprised they haven’t thrown Trump in there!!??
You don’t seem to understand that it’s a 2 party system. You can vote for whoever you want &amp; you should. But, you should also be aware that a 3rd party candidate is not going to win, which helps the incumbent (Trump).   It’s not hard.
False. Voting is not a privilege, it’s a right.   Vote for whoever you want, but a vote for a 3rd party is absolutely a vote for trump (that’s how we ended up with George W. Bush).   Biden ain’t perfect, but compare that gaff to the thousands of Trump comments over the years.

She was mocking Trump supporters the whole time. It was satire. Maybe it went too far, but at the end of the day mocking those fuckers is good and raising money for BLM is good. So it is a net positive.
Wouldn't it have been worth it if Trump actually did retweet in looked like a complete fool and fell even further behind in the polls. Anything to get him out of office! Also mocking his followers and drawing attention to BLM are inherently good things to do.

You are the fake news.  I also watched  it  and it is 100% certain.  Trump may not run the company day to day but he still owns it and is well aware of it.  He was trying to use US government assets to promote his private business, his Scottish golf resorts.
I cannot understand the dissonance of the messaging from the Trump campaign. On one hand they say Joe Biden is mentally incompetent and in his basement hiding? On the other hand they say he is a uniquely powerful man that will bring about a communist revolution and murder god?
I think the thing I’ve come to most is how much trump uses fear tactics. The best defense to that as far as I can see is reading a whole bunch and keeping an open mind. He’s running scared himself, and it shows.

This is the guy that's supposed to be better than Trump? We're just rearranging chairs on the deck of the titanic.
Only if we didn’t know what’s been going on around us for three years. Seriously who TF do you think you’re fooling with these false statements. Donald Trump doesn’t give a shit about Americans. He works for Moscow.
Trump is loyal to you only if he fears you
"Loyalty", to Trump
Hilarious!  Trump and Pence and all of their corrupt sycophants are far bigger disappointments to true conservatives than Justice Roberts will ever be!
I actually do socialize with front line workers including doctors and nurses in ICU. You’re grasping at straws . Trump being on the wrong side of most argument will catch up to him sooner than later. So keep supporting his genius plan.
Everyone’s praising  when his shoes are being made in Chinese sweatshops by underpaid kids. But y’all were mad when Trump wanted to stop manufacture clothing in China and bring manufacturing to America for a better and fair work environments.
That's because our 2 choices are Trump and Biden...no one's voting for  but I don't think it's too much of a stretch to say that America earned this very spot it's currently in right now

You can repeat that lie all you like there was no orchestrated spying on Trump , they were seeking a Russian mole as the  campaign was working with the russians.
Trump literally lies literally 100+ times in that interview, but oddly, that is not one of them.  That statement, although deceptive, is 100% true.
Twitter temporarily restricted Trump campaign's ability to tweet over false COVID-19 claims
Pence and Trump are a joke to all Americans
The vibe be nice till you say something about Donald trump. It’s like ya go retarded or sumn
You are a puppet as you repeat everything from Trump and Fox News. So you avoiding MSM is code for “can’t read” and “I let Trump think for myself”
His own people are against using the drug. There are treatment protocols that the medical community feel more comfortable with it. Are you just a Trump parrot?
I must admit that my first instinct was to answer the question "what has Trump done to lose your respect?"  With  "he carries on breathing" But that seems a bit harsh even for him...
No hoopla: Coronavirus upends Trump, Biden convention plans
CT unemployment payment max about 600.00/wk . extra 600/wk is not the right message at the taxpayers expense of those working to pay people to sit home. If they can’t negotiate at $400 let Trump write ex order. They will destroy Trump for him not to win.

Trump seems to be Karma proof. Nothing ever happens to him. But he’ll die eventually I suppose.
Not as bad. Much worse. He thinks cognitive tests are IQ tests. He brags about it but I am sure he did very poorly. Trump is hopelessly dumb, demented and evil. A combination that will eventually destroy the country if not stopped.
No it’s not that. Trump is a liar. He gives medical advice without a license. So dumb he believes the virus will disappear one day without a vaccine, you should inject disinfectants, nuke hurricanes, rake forest floors, destroy cancer causing windmills. He is an embarrassment 🤮
Wow, another one!   You meant, "bizarre" I take it?   A bazaar is an outdoor market; Bizarre means "strange," like in how strange it is President Trump believes the deaths of 1,000 Americans a day "is what it is."  Protip: Proofread your tweets (and your copy) next time!
Trump said Yo semites, that Colorado needed a border wall with Mexico, and that injecting Lysol does great things against the virus....they are both mentally depleted

Still waiting on that from Trump...
It seems like their are two parties:  A Trump Populist Party vs an Establishment Party.  The Establishment Party contains many Republican office holders.
Absolutely. Trump thinks they should slown down the testing in the midst of a pandemic. He thinks injecting disinfectants a good idea. That’s how stupid he is.
I’d say the same thing for trump but he has never managed to make sense in his entire life. He’s always been a moron. Disinfectants, windmills, person, woman, nuking hurricanes, raking forests. Trump is batshit crazy
So now he's openly racketeering.

Donald Trump Sat With His Arms Crossed, Refused To Answer Questions While White House Staffer Appeared To Scream At Reporters To Get Out.. Welcome to the crazy House''
Do you think if these events happed under a Republican President they wouldn’t follow him forever? How many people even heard of the Gold King mine spill? It was his aggressive EPA who caused it. Trump gets more blame on handling Flint than Obama and it happen under Obama.
Who wants to deal with a leader who speaks before he has all the facts and acts recklessly on hunches. Demonizes anyone who doesn’t agree with him. There needs to be a higher standard for President. Closer to war or anarchy with Trump.
The next seven months are going to be brutal. Trump is a burning fireworks factory next to the leaky ammonium nitrate warehouse that is American politics.
Donald Trump has multiple acts, those are facts. And no, not just a voting record, it includes interaction, history of relationships with people, accepting responsibility for words or actions that have affected people. It goes well beyond the political stripes, character matters.
They would support ANYTHING he said. If Trump went up there and said the air is cleaner because he’s President despite what we know about emissions (not his fault) his supporters would fall for that.
It doesn’t matter Trump will be crushed even if Kanye is in race.  Trump will lose FL and TX and NC and more. Trump is toast and he knows it as do the shameless R’s

Oh yeah interview is frightening but not surprising in the least. We've known for months that Trump had no clue what was going on in the pandemic. Some states like CT have good local leaders, fortunately.
Trump said Beirut blast could be 'a bomb of some kind'
None taken. Again, I knew that there was a disaster. I can show you the receipts from Home Depot in January. I can show you my brokerage statement. If I can see it coming with such certainty, so could the CIA. Trump was told and did nothing.
Yeah China has terrible human rights. But we knew that they were fighting a pandemic and trump did nothing. This isn’t about China. This is about the failure of our govt.

I really don’t understand what Trump is doing with these interviews. Clearly, the lies and obfuscation play to his base and alienate everyone else. He can’t win with just his base. I wonder what effect he thinks they are having.
Remember this:  Trump lies about everything, even when it in no way helps him.  He lies like breathing.

Circuit Blocks Trump Administration's 'Public Charge' Rule, Limits Scope to 3 States

Are you claiming that knife crimes in the UK are somehow directly connected to a certain subset of the population? Also without evidence you presume that the Russian immigrants in the UK are not engaged in knife crime Sounds as poorly researched as Trump on C-19 deaths in USA
If you saw that happen then so did our CIA.... the CIA informed Trump. He did nothing. This isn’t about China. This is about gross negligence on the part of our executive administration.
No need to debate, Trump lost first election 4 years ago, remember the peaceful riots after. No one is voting  for a racist leader
You're taking a play from Trump's campaign and just saying "these polls are fake"
Trump banned Chinese nationals but Americans flowed back and forth. That inconsistency was both stupid and xenophobic. Irrespective of that issue, the trump administration has lead this country to the worst death per capita in the 1st world. It was a failure. Look at the results.

Actual question: if Trump were convicted of all the things he’s been charged with, how many years would he have to serve? A) if he weren’t President? B) if he were?
Doubt it. Someone I had muted for 30 days on FB just popped into my feed with an article about how Trump is going to stomp all over Biden in a debate and the D’s will try to keep Biden from debates because he is unwell. This is a suburban, white college graduate mom.
I feel for Swan here. He's being sucked into the Trump vortex where he has to agree to the ridiculous logic of deaths by cases vs deaths by population.
This elections funny bc every time trump says something that makes me think shit maybe I should vote for Biden, he does something just as ridiculous. It’s like they’re competing for who’s worse
Trump loves calling protestors in the name of George Floyd ‘anarchists’ ‘looters’ etc at the drop of a dime, but in 2016 he went out of his way to make sure not everyone in the NeoNazi crowd was wrapped up in that flag.... that’s an easy one
That is not true, China fought the virus hard and let the whole world know they were dealing with a crisis. Trump ignored and downplayed all of it and allowed it to take root. All of this is well documented. Stop trying to deflect accountability!
Thankfully, Joe Biden is not our only choice when it comes to voting against Trump.  I'm sick and tired of voting for what the party that doesn't represent its people chose for us.  I'm not going to be a part of their game. My votes will represent me.

Trump writes his stuff specifically for Sarah Cooper.  It is hysterically funny but he is frightfully, willfully misinformed
Getting to Trump’s humanity is similar to opening Al Capone’s vault, with as much to be found there.  (Not suggesting any similarity between Jonathan Swan, a journalist, and Geraldo Rivera, a buffoon.)
Last point - didn’t Biden’s law cause millions of Black and Latino men to be put in prison while Trump’s Executive Actions and bills provided them relief from jail? Yes - Biden has a long history to examine. Which “alternative” fact do you want to challenge. Problem is you can’t!
How are any of those facts alternative. Did he not drop out of races because of plagerism? Did he not lie about being arrested many times including seeing Mandela? Did he not admit to not wanting to kill Ben Ladin? ? any of the other facts? Now you know why he won’t debate Trump.
With regards to (1), what are your thoughts on this recent EO?

Most nominees wait until week of convention to name someone. Just because the media is going non-stop trying to guess who it will be doesn’t mean Biden can’t make a decision. In fact, Trump picked Pence on 7/15/16. Pence formally accepted at convention on 7/19/16. #factsmatter
The Trump administration is cutting census data collection short. They don't care about democracy or representation - and they are openly flouting their constitutional obligations.   FILL those forms now. This is more critical than even before.

I know Trump “cool aid drinkers”. They are unwilling to approach the topic of his presidency with open minds and critical thinking. There is nothing you can say to them or show to them that will change their minds.

Your “source” Breitbart is a right wing fake pro Trump news aggregator.  If Trump sycophancy wasn’t paying your bills you’d admit it.
This is a bizarre chain of events, from the geopolitical look, the commission he want the treasury to get the bruised ego it gave trump, etc I'm all for protecting data but screwing with a deal to get done seems rather dictatorish.
I don’t think Trump has any obvious advantage!  He’s 74, frequently stumbles, frequently has trouble with words, doesn’t know how to handle any challenger og is prepared remarks, and generally acts like a thuggish, misogynist, racist moron.  Should do wonderfully in debate!
The only ones making an issue of this are Trump voters.  You misspoke—no big deal.  Like Trump doesn’t say something dumb/inaccurate/dangerously stupid/offensive 50 times a day?  Puhleez.  Keep on truckin’ and beat the sh— out of Trump!  Our country is depending on you!

Trump gave an ultimatum of only 45 days. It won't be out there for 12 months. If it does, it won't sell itself.
He needs to stop wasting people's time! Those republicans wants him to run to take votes away from the Dems, it it's over for Trump so they're grabbing at straws now!
Judge Roberts is in Bush's pocket and Bush does not like Trump-very simple. Too bad he has to hurt all conservatives as a result. As Pence put it, he's a real disappointment for conservatives. Term limits for all judges in the country

I still can’t get over Trump saying he didn’t know about John Lewis. It’s safe to say John Lewis knew plenty of Trumps.

Still awaiting your defense of Trump’s unhinged  interview and his dangerous claim that kids are pretty much immune from Covid. You cannot. So instead you circulate more “what about” nonsense.  Pathetic.   RR and HJH would disown you.

Jeff / the posting in question has your dear leader claiming kids are pretty much immune from Covid. Send them to school. They hardly ever get sick. No worries.   I have kids. Trump is LYING. So you’re ok w Trump playing w the lives of youngsters to get re-elected? Pathetic.

Yes, it reduces the mortality rate compared to number of cases. More  testing helps this stat for trump’s denial purpose. But it’s a meaningless statistic subject to the vagaries of testing. If you want to compare the US to the rest of the world, it must be done via population.
President trump is a HOAX.
President Pump and Top Tick Trump great family duo
Make sure he calls Donald Trump and gives him the update.. I guess his “Generals” told him otherwise.
Trump has NO IDEA swan wiped the floor with him. You want to know why?  Swan told him it was a great honor to be there. That is was Trump heard and he’s too stupid to see the rest.
Trump himself is clearly not satisfied with only one - there seems to be done, but every step counts.
But Trump is focused on TikTok (watching it 24/7 before he bans it).

The American people were most certainly not duped by Trump when he doubled the estate tax exemption.
Trump refused to turn over documents. He did not allow his financial advisors to supply documents. He refused to testify. Most investigated person in the US?! Not likely!
Can you name a respected individual who has worked directly for Trump who has said he is either a great person or a great leader?

Trump and his Cabinet
Donald Trump is a con-man, he always has been. Whether it’s lying to the American people or committing fraud, lying is simply second nature to him.
Proof that Trump has politicized the wearing of masks.
I agree that Trump shouldn't use national security excuse to give it to $MSFT on the cheap. Shut it down if it is a national security issue; prove it in a court of law. I like it better if Trump himself pockets the fees. Then all will see what's actually going on.

Yes. The Trump Presidency is basically a Trainwreck Reality Show.  And like the first blockbuster reality show, “Survivor”, after gorging on it for a few years, the country is ready to move on.
Trump is a reality-phony, paradox intended. So, Biden shouldn’t debate until Trump grants us all 3 wishes. Make it a game show. No debate until he, say, releases his taxes, his physical results and doesn’t tweet for a week. If he does it, debate. But only then.
I think Trump would be extremely naive to trust Zuckerberg; amoral != immoral, if Biden wins then come January it'll be a whole different Facebook.
Jeff Foxworthy needs to remix his “You might be a redneck” for “You might be a ‘rona carrier” ... if you don’t wear a mask if you do but don’t cover your nose if you think tests are a conspiracy to plant devices in your brain ... also works for “you might be a Trump supporter”

I’m being respectful to you. All I would ask is that you to question your current stance on this.   You cited a 4-year-old article.  A lot has happened in 4 years, it is very evident that Trump’s racist rhetoric has emboldened his base  to act, speak, scream, abuse POC.

Does Trump genuinely not understand the data his own administration is producing? He seems bewildered that Swan has, somehow, arrived at different conclusions (ie, what anyone else would have deduced, except Trump).  This is very scary stuff.

Whenever Trump tweets or speaks to the public...I almost always feel like Im being trolled by him 😳 Am I alone here? #Trumpsatroll
It’s only fair. After all Trump has driven most of our country absolutely nuts for the past 4 years so...I don’t feel bad, not even a little bit. I despise trolls, but If anyone ever deserved to be trolled...it’s TRUMP!

Trump’s Postmaster General, Louis DeJoy, sounds like an absolute shit businessman.   You know what they say about birds of a feather.
This is a gross statement. Biden’s policies aren’t that different than trumps he’s just more “civilized”. I’ll vote to remove trump but then I’ll support progressives to remove Biden.
Also trump:"just not by me because it would affect me negatively"
So looking forward to 2nd term with no dem's, I predict Trump will win and be majority in both senate and the house..... life will be great! Thank you Mr President for all you do!
Does trump know he can't ban tiktok because of 1st amendment protections??? Oh wait that would require reading and we all know how well he does with that "Intel report of russian bounties"

Trump: fraud could lead to 'greatest election disaster in history'
Yeah all trump does is turn the nightly coronavirus update into a campaign speech. Oh and bash Biden too!
No. Biden doesn't 'need' them in order to win. Not that you asked but I think if there are any debates, they should be held in an empty studio with just the moderators, crew, candidates, and fact-checkers. However, until Trump releases his tax returns NO debates.

That's insane
I his dreams!! Helllll NO! Trump becomes more &amp; more terrifying the closer he gets to leaving. He’s preparing for any possible angle to not leave office when he’s supposed to. 😱
Why would they blame trump? Just because he got sick after attending the lame Tulsa rally without wearing s mask or the campaign removing the social distancing stickers? Cant see how anyone could get sick from that?

I'm speechless that you are talking about this instead of honoring the memory of john lewis. This proves my point it's got to be about trump republicans and yourself. Your motives are clear and they are not for improving the country
What good has John Lewis ever said about President Trump? Is anyone surprised he isn’t there?
That’s because John hated him and said many things he didn’t like. President Trump isn’t going to say something good about John Lewis after that.

Does Trump think if says he will issue an "Executive Order ", he can then just, do anything he wishes?
It's the ignorance of the Trump campaign to think we would. More white kids from suburbs listen to Kanye and are obsessed with Kardashians. Black women are sick of them appropriating everything. So it was a losing strategy. This is what happens when they have no black advisors.
I saw that Hogg kid and Amy Siskind with their disingenuous praise of Black women. 🙄  And that’s all well and good.   But to be clear:  Trump will be over when, and only when, White people have had enough.   Take that to the bank.

Everytime Trump calls it the "China Virus", I cross my fingers that much harder, praying tomorrow we all wake to hear, "tested positive ".
P.S. I’m not defending Dinesh — quite the opposite — pointing out that the pronunciation in a region that literally doesn’t use equivalent sounds is dumb. In Bogota, people called me “Acha” (which means “ax”) bc there is no “sh” sound in Spanish. Trump doing that would be wrong.
You mean the current president trump is also a rapist
Nope. I would take Nickleback over listening to trump any day
5. Last time I checked, Trump neither speaks a South Asian language nor has an Indian accent, so why is this a point of comparison??? In fact, MAGAs tell my parents to “speak real English” because they have an accent (and though they speak it perfectly), so same applies to Trump?
Someone please remind me to tweet out “When is our Empire gonna get a New Groove?” if trump wins the next election? Hopefully that tweet never has to see the light of day, but just in case?
This is true, though it’s because the hard “t” in most Indian languages is different than the one used in English (more below), and it would be unnatural in the Indian accent. They also pronounce “w”s as “v”s and refer to toast as “bread toast” which I assume Trump doesn’t do 1/

Paul Krugman says he’s done the math — and the risk Trump and McConnell pose to the economy is ‘terrifying’
If Kanye West's name is on your ballot when you go into the booth this November and you cast your vote for him, you pretty much chose to re-elect President Trump.
What this means, in context:   1) Putin is working to help Trump win—again.  2) Russian cutouts are weaponizing private calls—as they did in 2016, with private emails.  3) Russia is seeking to "boost" Trump on social media—again.  4) Our election systems are exposed—still.
23. Even if that never happens, the mere possibility of it happening would be enough, in the age of Donald Trump, to supercharge Democratic turnout, fueling a landslide election, which is probably the only thing that would push Trump out of office.
20. That’s voting for someone who will have no impact, which means Cupp’s opposition to Trump isn’t serious, which means a column about how much depends on Biden’s pick is just striking a pose.
19. To the extent that she insists that writing in a candidate is legitimate, I don’t know what to say, because that’s not voting against Trump.
16. They are voting *against* Trump, which means Biden himself is a secondary thought, which means his running mate is a tertiary thought—if they’re thinking about vice presidents at all, which is unlikely.
12. For the curious, Cupp likes Kamala Harris, dislikes Susan Rice. It would be interesting if Cupp were to say Harris could ignite the Democratic base, especially Black Democrats and Democrats of color, thus doing the most to ensure Trump’s defeat in a tidal wave.
9. In her latest, she said the choice between voting for Biden and a write-in candidate (she’s against Trump) depends on Biden’s choice of a running mate.
5. NG: He wants to create fear, uncertainty and doubt so that people feel frozen and paralyzed, and then the man of action, Trump himself, can ride in and seize the day.”
2. We are entering a dangerous period fraught with instability and apprehension as well as potential for violence and bloodshed. Donald Trump is most likely to contest anything that’s short of a landslide for Joe Biden.
There is nothing surprising here. But it should make us feel better that the apparatus of government is working despite Trump's efforts to suppress it.
Donald Trump is not the one who decided to reopen states too early. It was state governors.  had no control over that. It’s called federalism.
On Election Day 2016, Russian trolls were alleging that the vote would be rigged, and the White House was bracing for Putin’s hackers to cause chaos at polling places.   The Russian objective is not just to help Trump. It’s also to undermine public confidence in our elections.

agreed. And it's not limited to Ams (white or black), but a cross-cultural phenomenon. e.g. I wrote about how contemporary Chinese liberal intellectuals project their anxieties &amp; perspectives to Am, drawing incredibly wrong conclusions &amp; idolizing Trump

Does Trump have Covid-19?

Sorry. By "optimistic," I meant that Trump would agree to give up power. I don't think he will. I don't think he'll recognize a Biden win even if it's a landslide.
And Trump’s only line of attack against Biden is that he’ll “hurt the Bible and hurt God”?  Yeah, Trump’s flailing in his attempts to run against Biden.  He was primed for Bernie or Liz.
You can tell by what Trump is saying  That he really wanted to be running against Bernie or Liz  And we should all be grateful he isn’t
Do we really have to debate how incredibly stupid Donald Trump is?  I mean, if you can’t acknowledge that the man-child is a moron, that’s says so much about you as a person.

As Koreans, New Zealanders, Japanese, others enjoy the freedoms of a virus-free existence, Americans are constrained, lessened, unable to live fully, or work freely. The enjoyments of the summer-break taken away. But as Trump says, "it is what it is". Defeated, surrendered.

The attempts at voter suppression that will occur in November aren't designed to save Trump, the GOP knows he's going down. It's purpose is to save the Senate. They know that's their only avenue to holding power. In tight races they don't need to suppress many votes. #November3rd

Maybe this is a bit optimistic, but it seems about right to me. Biden is looking good in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, Virginia, North Carolina.   I think Biden ultimately wins Ohio, Florida by a hair. But Trump steals Georgia, Texas w/ voter suppression.

Everyone hates Trump. Everyone hates Biden.  What the hell are we doing?

Trump and his team are grotesque. In their desperation to show that Biden is "alone and hiding in his basement," they have taken pictures of him AT EVENTS and altered them.  Here they have taken the microphone out of his hand and changed the background to put him back indoors. /1

Trump cancelled the  convention in Florida but he &amp; your failed Governor are pushing for schools to open! Our children should not be #COVID19 experiments!!  Thankfully I don't live in state led by science deniers!! #ScienceMatters  #DeSantisIsADisgrace #TrumpVirusCatastrophe

HRC won the popular vote by 3 million!!!  Trump "won" the Electoral College by 200,000 votes over 3 states with Putin's help!! In 2018 Democrats won back the house in huge numbers! This time we hope to keep the House &amp; win the White House &amp; flip the Senate!  #Biden2020Landslide
Biden will not debate Trump because the country will see how mentally impaired he is. Just watch his last thirty appearances on his podcasts and on the campaign trail during the primaries. From beginning to end. Scary stuff. And a Trump is going to win.
Trump/ Republican cronies gave huge tax cuts to the 1% while middle class families like mine suffered!! I'm a white Catholic mother &amp; grandmother, part of the "radical left"  I support women's rights, justice for ALL &amp; want a president with empathy &amp; character!  #RebuildWithBiden
Putin put a bounty on US &amp; British forces &amp; Trump has refused to confront him on it!  I don't know stupid you think the people are but Trump himself said he hasn't talked to Putin about this which means they are still in jeopardy!!  #AllRoadsLeadToPutin #RussiaOwnsTrump
The hand sanitizer recall fiasco is a microcosm of the Trump Administration's overall failure to provide a national COVID-19 response. Relying on the private sector to step up on their own initiative instead of coordinating their efforts has lead to chaos and confusion.
It's deeply irresponsible of Trump not to have a national testing strategy &amp; a mask mandate considering we are the most infected country on the planet! We are losing over 1,000 souls a day but he continues to golf every weekend! He's a national disgrace!!  #TrumpVirusFailure
Please explain why the Trump Administration wanted to kill off Americans in the Tri-state area?  You do realize that there are Republicans there, right?  Maybe Trump should have Barr look into that?
Senate Republicans like  voted AGAINST protecting our elections but want to complain our elections aren't secure!! Your hypocrisy is astonishing! Trump &amp; cronies have ALL used paper ballots but don't want the rest of us, during a pandemic, to vote the same way!!
If only Trump's mother didn't take a pregnancy test!
Retweet if you're as curious as I am about Donald Trump having an awful lot of pictures taken with Jeffrey Epstein &amp; Ghislaine Maxwell.  Why so many pictures with them?

I realize that Trump is busy playing golf but we are anxiously awaiting his healthcare plan today!!
How about Putin putting a bounty on our soldiers? How about Trump's praise of China in Jan &amp; Feb? How about his failure to contain #COVID19 &amp; protecting millions of unemployed people from hunger, eviction &amp; disease?   has failed us!! #TrumpFailedAmerica #COVID19Pandemic
You’re kidding, right?  Trump wouldn’t know the rule of law if he tripped over it and his Attorney General is a thug.  Fortunately for Connecticut, you Republicans remain in the minority in government in this great state.
I don't know this guy. I do know every bit of what he says is stupid. I do know I hate that he  says those words. I do know he's idiot. trump has put our country up for sale, discounted for putin of course. That guy, in America can still express himself &amp; I can say he's stupid.

That’s righhhhhhhhht! LOL Fuck you Captain Trump and the whole planet of Trumpion! Fuck Trump! Fuck your feelings..like you ever cared about anyone!
They ask personal questions &amp; then what day is it &amp; who's president! The last thing I wanted to do is utter his name when I was in pain!! He asked me twice so I finally said Trump but hopefully not for long!! He probably thought I was crazy but I can't say his name!! 😫
Sounds like this should be nation-wide. I like the idea of getting a text saying my vote has been received and tallied.

Exactly. trump {he must earn back the capital T} anyway...he says sh*t about everyone, even fox at times. Never, ever anything but "atta putin boy" "why would he do this or that" No questions asked. Come on t, ask the damn question. Ask this damn question.

There are 1,000+ people dying from COVID19 daily &amp; you are celebrating because a gym gets to stay open? We are in the worst health &amp; economic crisis in a generation while Trump golfs, you tweet &amp; the Senate takes a summer break.  What a national disgrace the  is!  #GOPFail
Is the "Trump thing" like a venereal disease? If so she's lucky she never got it!! 🤮🤮🤮
Trump is the epitome of blasphemous!
We can't. Just like we can't live with Trump!
What's up with the supreme court siding with trump on using military funds for the wall? No one from Mexico wants to come here now. In fact they don't want us there. They may build and pay for the wall to keep us out.
If these assholes spent less time trying to trip up or make the Doc look bad and did their jobs we would be in better shape. Gym Jordan was a complete hole yesterday and trump praised him. Use the time to help rather than criticize those trying to get us reeled in here.

By executive order,  satire and hornpipes are now banned. Trump just heard that Pan caused the pandemic.
i’m telling this to mr. trump
Yep not a mask to be seen. Definitely Trump sheep.Or heeded the words of Sen. John McCain.  Even Michael Cohen, who may have waited a bit too long to expose *Trump! He still had good insight into the man who is *Trump!
It has been on display since #MoscowMitch became  ! Once *Trump was elected it became blatantly obvious when the entirety of  feel in lockstep with these treasonous hateful people!
Hahaha.. and those countries are in better shape and less contaminated then we are..  Another spike due to incompetence and tomfoolery.. TRUMP WILL GO.. THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE WON'T GIVE HIM THE OVAL OFFICE THIS TIME AROUND.

He will stop at nothing to steal this election. Have no doubt. Everything is at stake. If Trump wins, the past three years will be remembered as the good ole days. #Election2020
Well many have been pretending Trump hasn’t been happening the whole time.
This is true, but somebody with standing would have to sue the Trump Administration to get this EO struck down by the courts.
Why is a Trump going after TikTok and WeChat as if there aren’t American apps/companies that don’t also steal our information (Facebook, Google, Amazon)? Or the US government itself with the NSA?
Donald Trump BANS TikTok, US Companies Have 45 Days To Stop Doing Busine...  via
Trump’s just shitting in the water.
He only has that power if nobody stops him. These EOs would be blatantly unconstitutional. The Republicans complained about Obama’s EOs for which he at least described a legal basis. They should be screaming bloody murder about what Trump is proposing.
This is true, but someone would have to take the Trump Administration to court to stop these orders from taking effect. Would the GOP go against Trump to fight for a constitutional principle. Would the Dems do it knowing how bad it would look politically. And what next?
They already cover existing conditions because Obamacare is still the law. But if SCOTUS ultimately throws out the ACA, Trump’s EO won’t fix things. It actually is unconstitutional. Besides that Trump just created an incentive no to buy insurance until you get sick.
You mean like Trump?
It will be fairly easy to protect Trump when he’s in prison.
Trump cannot spend money by executive order. If he tried and gets away with it then the President is essentially a dictator.
I tried watching trump’s presser tonight. It was so bad that even Fox pulled away. I depend on  of CNN to fact-check what trump is saying. He’s great.
And arrest trump for breaking the mask mandate as the club’s owner.  And when he refuses, sue to finally get the Supreme Court to admit that not even the President is above the law.
TRUMP WINNING.
At this point, economy &amp; stock market both likely need more stimulus to keep them going up; after all, a prolonged depression would harm US more than another debt-laden bill. But Dems are out of control with their demands for nearly $4 trillion in spending
Does trump really think these pressers help him ?
ABSOLUTELY PRESIDENT TRUMP YOU ARE RIGHT ON KUDOS . AND TO SCHUMER AND PELOSI TIME TO CHANGE YOUR DIAPERS YOU ARE TRULY DISSCUSSTING ONLY CAREING ABOUT YOUR AGENDA BAIL OUT CONNECTICUT CALIFORNIA AND NEW YORK . DUMB DEMOCRAT RUNED SPENDING FOOLISHLY AT TAXPAYERS EXPENSE .
You just said it didn't happen under Trump. This is from 2019
Since when did Trump supporters become against locking people in cages? 🤔
So the five year old migrant children being put in cages by Trump are violent criminals?
You mean like the 5 year old toddlers who are being locked up at the border right now and forced to drink from toilets? Trump said that Africa is full of "Shithole countries" So why should you care what happenes to blacks?

BTW, between covid and Trump the South will fall again!!!!!
They have  doing what *Trump is doing to our country doing! They washed their hands clean of us...
The vast majority of that was official business where the First Lady was, excellently, representing the Nation. I notice Trump doesn’t let Melania do much of that; maybe he’s afraid she won’t come back.

OMG, she gets ONE softball question and can't handle it.  Trump gets nastier questions constantly!
Indeed this has TRUMP all over it ! It’s a distraction, a tool Trump uses when he is desperate. The fact that he is this desperate shows he’s TERRIFIED OF LOSING. Bye!!!
I am praying that Mitch, Lindsey and Jim Jordan are all thrown out of the Republican Party.  They have helped Trump ruin our country.
Trump is DONE
Trump is not decent (by far). Trump is not a decent option.
Uhhhhhh, Trump will not have an easy life after January 20.  SDNY and the state of NY will see to that.
Those are the type of people who support Trump.  They will be left out in the cold after January 20.
WRONG. Trump has done little for people who aren't white and wealthy.
Trump is a #Biblicalidiot
Tell that to tRump. He thinks he's above the law. He even said so. Go after him and leave the NRA alone.
Then the Republican Party better develop some balls, because there are too many Republicans who just want to be loved. (Graham, Romney, Rubio, Baker, and many others). Trump can be a narcissistic fool, but he fights against the barbarians on the left.
Hope your right, but I’ve given up on guessing about stupid when almost 40% of country think that trump has done a good job with Covid!  Just need small amounts of votes in certain states.
You do realize it's a matter of national security right for people to be tested around him. I get you hate anything Trump. If Obama was in the White House they should do the same thing.
Literally anything and everything. I mean it's clearly Trump's fault that a foreign country decided to improperly store fertilizer right? Because that happened.
Yes, the bill you have sitting on your desk for two months presented by the Democrats! Them offering the people $600 a week instead of $200 by Republicans! Plus taking all the GOP greedy asks out wanted by *Trump and your lobbyists! The People first!

Trump issues executive order banning TikTok from operating in 45 days if it's not sold by Chinese parent company
Trump is really going wacko.  Why on earth would he talk about this?
If a company sold a product that killed as many Americans as Trump I would never buy from them again. So yes, never Trump for me means never Republican.
Like Adolf Hitler if he can't run the country he will burn it to the ground Donald Trump Steve mnuchin should both be thrown in jail they're stealing from the American people to artificially prop up the stock market when it crashes we all lose
Me too !!!!!  Do you have a video on Thighland yet ?  🥰🥰 No pressure at all,  I mean, I know you’re busy  .. I just miss you and trump is giving me a migraine.  Love you honey , totally crushing on you . Wishing I was a gay man about now . 🌈🌈🌈❤️😘
You know damn well Trump is not referencing, or knows anything about, a steam setting on a dryer.
Sad part it is Joe Biden will maintain decorum in the debate and *Trump will be *Trump! Attempting to bully and be overly aggressive! Whether Biden does or doesn't debate *Trump it all plays into *Trump's BS!
I understand that it's a satirical joke about the fact that the governor even banned it in the first place.
Anyone who is serious about depending on Biden’s VP pick to not vote for trump, is by definition, an unserious person.
TRUMP WINNING 👍
Trump's lies kill people.
TRUMP WINNING WITH TRUTH AND HONESTY THE PEOPLES PRESIDENT.
I don’t see how reasonable people could take the Rediscovery seriously who have sold out their party and their COUNTRY to support Donald Trump.

We had some significant storm damage here in the Northeast.  We are out of power and many trees are down.  I’m sure the libs will blame this on Trump too.

President Trump seems to not know or care that Congress alone has the power to set the date of the election.  This is a democracy, Mr. President. Americans are dying every day from your botched pandemic response. Stop tweeting about doing illegal things and start doing your job.
It’s totally believable. He’s working for Trump, which is why Trump hasn’t said anything about it.
Biden has a stutter, what’s Trump’s excuse?
After watching the  interview with trump, is it any wonder that world leaders laugh at him behind his back? Narcissistic, dishonest, racist, rambling. ..
But he won't because the Left seriously doesn't have anyone better right now. Biden is the only one who has a realistic chance of going to toe-to-toe with Trump and winning, if the economy and pandemic somehow make independents &amp; swing voters turn against Trump
Trump would totally dominate Susan Rice or Kamala Harris. I really hope Biden pulls out and his insane VP choice becomes candidate- that would almost guarantee another landslide
Wrong !  Why should Biden waste his time on a debate knowing that trump will lie about everything?
No, the Manhattan DA should tell Barr to shove the blatantly unconstitutional OLC memo against indicting sitting presidents straight up his ass and send a SWAT team to drag Trump and any other co-conspirators working at the WH out of the building kicking and screaming.
Not just the kids here are crowded (and mostly maskless). How many dead teachers, staff, administrators and other personnel are acceptable? Per district? Per school? Per month? Per semester? And don’t forget dead students. All while Barron trump is distance learning at home...
you're right , but totally off base about Trump. He wants immigration based on SKILLS, hes always said that, but NOW we must focus on AMERICANS getting jobs. If u think Biden/Socialists will be better than Trump/GOP you're crazy #Trump2020NowMoreThenEver
Are you implying Trump doesn’t have a mind? Not bad for someone who helped build the Manhattan skyline, had a #1 Tv show for a decade, only to end it to become President on his first try, defeating the entire DC establishment. But keep playing your games and thinking he’s dumb.
I know there’s a million why Bernie was better......the question to why Biden is better than Trump is hard to answer really there is no difference.
At some point, if we’re gonna keep demanding Trump get treated like any regular citizen, we need to start talking about the fact that that would mean CPS getting called on every single parent in that sociopath family YEARS ago

Like the orange idiot said, “It is what it is”.  Asswipe trump doesn’t give a shit about Americans losing their lives!
interview of trump is incredible and eye-opening. He reveals just how depraved trump is. The man had no morals, no soul. The part about John Lewis is especially revealing.
Not since Trump was elected and the left went off the rails.
All I have to say is Trump handled this way better than Biden ever could at this point in his dementia.  Trump just has to do a few things for the people and he wins.   I suggest #Medicare4All  and #UBI
Trump should put her in charge of the Space Force. She’s already out there.😂😂😂
Are you kidding me??? He DID NOTHING TO SLOW IT OR STOP IT OR EVEN MENTION IT!!!  It’s all on TRUMP!!! Every single death.
It's not really that valid.  Anyway, Trump is easy pickins' for a debate.
Yes, and Trump is a racist elitist from the Northeast.
GWB has class and Trump has none. Some of us figured that out a very long time ago!
Cicadas are more attractive than Trump admin people.
Reagan Bush Clinton Bush Obama and Trump
This is why Trump is the greatest...
I have no idea how they will work it out. I am sure Trump and GOP will figure out some compromise between making those who lost jobs because of shutdowns homeless and financially ruining landlords.
I get the feeling he said something he wasn’t supposed to say there. Trump has to know the official story is that Epstein committed suicide. He just fed a bunch of conspiracy theories with that answer.Americans are dumb enough. Trump could skate to victory just signing EOs for things that already exist. Constant positive media airtime.
This is true, but somebody with standing would have to sue the Trump Administration to get this EO struck down by the courts.
He only has that power if nobody stops him. These EOs would be blatantly unconstitutional. The Republicans complained about Obama’s EOs for which he at least described a legal basis. They should be screaming bloody murder about what Trump is proposing.
This is true, but someone would have to take the Trump Administration to court to stop these orders from taking effect. Would the GOP go against Trump to fight for a constitutional principle. Would the Dems do it knowing how bad it would look politically. And what next?
They already cover existing conditions because Obamacare is still the law. But if SCOTUS ultimately throws out the ACA, Trump’s EO won’t fix things. It actually is unconstitutional. Besides that Trump just created an incentive no to buy insurance until you get sick.
It will be fairly easy to protect Trump when he’s in prison.
Trump cannot spend money by executive order. If he tried and gets away with it then the President is essentially a dictator.
The vast majority of that was official business where the First Lady was, excellently, representing the Nation. I notice Trump doesn’t let Melania do much of that; maybe he’s afraid she won’t come back.
This #Election2020 is between two camps: A BusinessMan vs a Politician. The businessman works for the economy. The Politician works for himself first. Trump vs Biden ( people that vote for Biden wouldn't care even if was Charles Manson), they are just ANTI-TRUMP
I'd rather deal with Trump tweets than Biden's dementia.
For example, I criticize Joe Biden for wanting to increase police funding, but Trump attacks Biden by lying and pretending Biden wants to defund the police.
No, he won't, because I criticize Biden from the left and Trump would see the things I criticize him for as good
Trump doesn't need "ammo" to attack Biden. He'll attack Biden regardless of what you do.
Hopefully it'll be a vaccine against Trump. He's a disease we don't need.
Take to the bank. Trump #LANDSLIDE

Heads up America. It's Trump time and Its going to be spectacular!! What a time we live in. #winning #thankyouJesus
doesn't hate black people,  he just thinks if a Black person votes for Trump,  they ain't black, and that all Black think alike because they are limited in diversity to tha Latinos. Sounds like Joe is stuck in the 1870's
Or Putin! You can’t vote for Biden if his VP pick is Putin. .... Oh, that’s right... I forgot Putin’s already running with Trump.
Who cares? Will they be breathing? Are they not Donald Trump/Mike Pence? Fine.
Meanwhile....
The other 87% of Fox News viewers think Trump isn't racist enough (cue: Anne Coulter).
And if the African Americans don't want to vote for Trump because of their ill-conceived hatred, just don't vote. Just an opinion. Unless you agree the African Americans are less diverse than Latinos. I say everyone is as diverse as everyone else
It does now, it’s destroying the country to spite Trump. That whether they want to or not gets them banished from the Republican party. Guess what you wanna vote for Biden auto Democrat  status. Lefty way, they cut off the nose to spite the face.
says "if you vote for Trump,  you ain't black" followed by "Black's do not have diversity of thought"
This is the most racist thing ever but no one will care becuase it’s not Trump ... smfh
Trump is the master of pay to play. It's time to focus on his corruption.
If I were a Republican Governor with a Trump visit on your schedule, I'd be nervous
For one, it’s not true, Mary Trump is the author of the number one book and secondly, you haven’t read anything since you were forced to in high school.  We don’t believe you’ve read a briefing never mind a book.  Dummy.
As much as I’d love for NY AG Letitia James’ announcement to be about Trump, I think she’s telling us exactly what it’ll be about in the phrasing of her ‘major NATIONAL announcement’ press release—the #NRA.
He probably feels overwelmed,lonely and very sadat night. But God is holding him up. I for one know it's hard when people are so mean. But he knows there are millions who are watching him change and love him. These bullies will answer to God. Bless you President Trump.
Y’all actively shit on trump when it’s clear everyone is out to get him. But let Biden slide. Dude can’t even finish a sentence and gropes little girls. That’s cool I guess

The White House belongs to the American people, not the  - it’s not a Trump Hotel and it’s not a campaign prop.
Goes to show you a lot about the job Trump is doing that Biden can hide away from everything and still be pummeling Trump in the polls.
Awesome. I just moved and I haven't met my neighbors yet. I'm wondering what happens when I put up the flags and the Trump signs.
There used to be the joke "If Trump cured cancer, Dems would fight for the rights of malignant cells."  I'm not so sure this is a joke anymore.

The level of patience by interviewer  to be constantly interrupted yet maintain composure is tremendous.  Trump wants it both ways with testing —doesn’t like high numbers of testing, but wants deaths measured by tests instead of population.

Johnson is compromised.  When Trump loses there are going to be a lot of people in the GOP with a decision to make about where to spend their futures if they want to stay out of prison.
That was an incredibly roundabout way to say that schools should remain closed if the test positivity rate is higher than 5%. Maybe she was hoping Trump would have tuned out by the time she finished her answer.

No matter what outrages Trump commits in the lead-up to, and aftermath of, the election, we can count on the 4th estate to treat it like it’s normal so as not to upset their corporate masters. Just look at their coverage of global warming for proof.
Let's pray for this! 🙏🙏🙏🙏 Honestly, should Trump win CA, it would be an electoral earthquake.
Our Dem Governor did an excellent job. Sorry things needed to be closed, I guess that's because the people didn't see a need to stay home or wear masks until it was to late and they were sick. I'd put my trust in our CT governor before I would tRump.
Trump’s lies have killed 158,000 Americans ... and he lied about that too.
Trump always lies. In this case he was lying to deflect from his inaction and hoping everyone would forget what he said he would do.
It’s two weeks later and no health plan, unless Trump did it while he was golfing this morning.
IOW you don’t like that he hasn’t selected someone according to your arbitrary and irrelevant timetable.  Ronald Reagan didn’t announce George H W Bush as his VP candidate until the GOP convention. And let’s not forget how Trump ended up with Pence.

That said, Cain was an adult, a former cancer patient, and likely to be at high risk if he contracted COVID19 disease. He could have taken more precautions, but the Trump campaign had much more information about the risks of holding the rally.

Yes. The masks were encouraged, but it's a political football (thanks Trump!). So there are people opposed to students having to wear them. Their priorities are effed up!
Trump isn’t on the trip log 😂😂😂 so why is the rest of his family on it 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
We would of known in 2016? If this has been happening since forever what makes you think Trump would of got exposed if they’ve been doing it for centuries in plain sight?
Maybe we should vote by mail by the time they straighten out all the fraud PRESIDENT TRUMP will remain in office probably till 2030 I'm fine with that.
Yes  Drain the swamp. Get Dumb Donald Trump Arnold out and it will dry up
Trump is in those files and video evidence of him and Epstein having a close friendship...Trump said he barely talked to the guy 🤦‍♂️
All get a bad rep over the 10% what kind of small do you have that it’s the same ideology with police 🤦‍♂️ but no when it’s police it’s only “an incident” you don’t go around calling all police murderers 🤷🏻‍♂️ and didnt Trump get peaceful protesters gassed and shot with rubber bullets
Jim Jordan should ask Trump if his rallies where little to no one wore a mask should be limited. Someone died from Covid 19 going to his rally. Has any protesters died? And in the same breathe as this trash congressman making it seem like all protesters destroy property did he
THIS is why propaganda and lies are dangerous. Will you wake up????
Joe on Trump: ‘A sad, pathetic display’  via   Absentee ballots, mail-in ballots ARE THE SAME THING! This from the former RNC Chairman! Donnie, you’re already finding excuses for losing!! #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #AmericaOrTrump
The people in the Resistance need to stop following Trump. How the hell does he have 84M followers?  You will still see what he spews on here. #UnfollowTrump
The same way biden leads trump in polling
Meaning stop hating on Trump
Like the peaceful transfer to Trump!
I hear you, I just see a lot of people praising Obama when they shouldn't and I fear that it could lead to people not holding anyone who isn't Trump accountable in the future. Mad I have to vote Biden, but I will vote for him nevertheless
I think it is important to remind people that while Trump is the worst, we shouldn't paint others as heroes when they aren't
Trump against Big Pharma. Everyone can get behind that..... right?
There’s a part of me that still holds out hope Trump with ultimately resign so as to avoid losing in the election. The response to COVID-19 and the new reports of the GDP plummeting last quarter should, in themselves, be embarrassing enough for him. Wishful thinking, I know.
If Trump had followed the CDC guidelines, there never should have been a rally in the first place!
His death is on Trump’s hands!!! He most definitely contracted COVID at Trump’s rally and now he’s dead. Shameful
Trump should resign. I will keep saying it. Trump should resign.
.      Should start preparing for the conversation that dems will force trump to either debate kamala harris or no one at all. Joe Biden will never get on a debate stage with donald trump
Brilliant tweet from trump
Just to be clear, doing what’s right for Maine includes bending over backwards for a wanna-be despot? Has Trump “learned his lesson”?
Hmm,and they are WOMEN how sexist of President Trump
Of course Trump is RIGHT how can a person CHEAT if SAID person has to show I D to cast their VOTE?? So please tell me why President TRUMP is AGAINST mail in VOTING if he's the cheater.Everyone must be for VOTER I. D.
Someone NEEDS to protect our soldiers from the combination of DUMB DONALD TRUMP ARNOLD  and the Russians bounty on their heads.
If trump really follows through with these prescription price slashes then hes your daddy and there is no incompliance
Germany has a better economy than us and actaully treats their citizens with love....Trump is the modern day dictator.

Imagine being a Democrat and endlessly complaining about Trump then this is the guy you bring to the plate to faceoff vs Donny. Its the saddest shit I've ever seen
No, Donald. The AG is just trying to protect  members whose donations are being illegally diverted.   Kind of like the Trump Foundation.   Remember?  The Trump Foundation was caught funneling cancer research money directly to you.   You stole money from children with cancer.
One of the options in November is a kiddie-diddling, racist, stupid ass son of a bitch who consistently says the wrong thing at the wrong time. The other one is Donald Trump. Lord Jesus give me strength.

Trump said Yo semites, that Colorado needed a border wall with Mexico, and that injecting Lysol does great things against the virus....they are both mentally depleted
The caravans were drummed up by trump to try and get his base to come out during the mid term elections. It didn’t work.
Trump everything to do with this. Had he taken this pandemic seriously in the beginning instead of calling it a democratic hoax we would already be out of this mess. But go ahead and blame the governor for trying to protect fellow citizens.

Donald Trump Sat With His Arms Crossed, Refused To Answer Questions While White House Staffer Appeared To Scream At Reporters To Get Out.. Welcome to the crazy House''
Do you think if these events happed under a Republican President they wouldn’t follow him forever? How many people even heard of the Gold King mine spill? It was his aggressive EPA who caused it. Trump gets more blame on handling Flint than Obama and it happen under Obama.
Donald Trump has multiple acts, those are facts. And no, not just a voting record, it includes interaction, history of relationships with people, accepting responsibility for words or actions that have affected people. It goes well beyond the political stripes, character matters.
Trump is a racist
Yes, Trump is exactly that!
Trump has a complete lack of empathy &amp; understanding of the amount of human suffering happening across the US right now.
At least she saw the light. How many Trump voters are hopeless cases? Too many.
It’s the way that whenever I see a Trump hashtag, your tweet will always be at the top.
Tinfoil hat time: video includes campaign signs for years after his second term would expire, with “In the Hall of the Mountain King” playing in the background. Kings don’t have term limits. Trump doing away with the 2 term limit confirmed
156,000 Americans dead.   GDP collapsing.   One million new jobless claims every month.   Trump uses his time to troll the internet.   What a goddamn loser.
can anyone who follows me that supports trump please give me 3 reasons why you support him i’m not trying to start any arguments i’m just genuinely curious
You support trump, you’re a lost cause.
Trump still held the grand majority of the Obama to Trump voters, and still does. That's the voting bloc you want to target, because they were formerly Democrats, and would be easier to convert over than lifelong Republicans.   You know who had the best ratings among them?

Wow the first thing bad to happen that you didn’t blame on trump.  Do us a favor and go hit balls at the driving range
Put trump in jail
Had Trump done this from the beginning the country would be in a much better place in every way! His latest interview, which I just watched is an embarrassment to him, his party and the Americans people!
Jesus, fuck I'm so fucking embarrassed to have you as a representative. You're this fucking rankled about the fact that Trump didn't allow bipartisan American Imperialism that you openly admitted to a fucking coup in the middle of a pandemic.
How are you in the medical field seeing people die and get admitted for Covid and you think it’s fake. My coworker will be dedicated to trump no matter what. It’s bananas.
to see who he actually is. Trump to me is a fool, doesn’t care about anyone but himself. I began following just as Ike was stepping down. Be careful young lady.
Is this the Caitlin Hicks I saw dising Pelosi? If it is then may I suggest looking into a situation before commenting.  Trump is a masterful dishonest man.  One thing I’ve learned in my years following politics is investigate. Look at a man’s history...
You’re a boot licking trump supporter.
Whatever he is, I can say one thing though, he is avery decent human being and Trump is not.
"It is what it is". Trump has no empathy for the immense human suffering that Americans are experiencing.
Someone needs to tell Trump the first step in getting out of the hole is to put down the shovel !
Trump has no empathy for those that have died from COVID. He'd rather try to sweep them under the rug. But it's estimated that the US wl have 230,000 dead by Oct.31st. That's the reality that Americans are facing right now.
Trump is such a Fuck wad.

Yes. There was a GA high school that was featured on MSNBC. The school district encouraged masks, but it wasn't necessary. There was a lot of push back from ppl opposed to masks. Bc of Trump mask-wearing has become a political football.

The sad part is the constant belaboring of this idiotic concept. Everyone has to have someone to tell them when they're being stupid. Even if Trump were to have such a person, which he doesn't, he wouldn't listen. Insanity.

I don't follow the NHL so I can't speak to that. As for Biden, I can tell from your tweet history that you are a big Trump guy but many smart rational people think Biden is the best guy for our country. It's ok that you have a different opinion but don't be obtuse about it.
As my husband just said “Trump makes Bush look like Ghandi”
What loser
Trump against Big Pharma. Everyone can get behind that..... right?
President Trump, can you really be this egotistical and myopic. You don't see what you have caused. Hopefully in November that will be your undoing.
The Dems are happy Herman Cain’s dead because it’s just one less black conservative they’ll have to spend time calling a sellout and an Uncle Tom. As if smearing Trump in the process wasn’t bad enough. BTW he had stage 4 liver cancer so I doubt his death was entirely due to Covid
Did he have any other underlying conditions that made him more susceptible to the virus? I don’t think being unmasked and at a trump rally was the only reason for contracting and dying of this virus. Poor statement! A mask is not 100% effective.
I guarantee you they will say not my president because people did when trump was elected.

Ambition is the engine.  When fed by ego you get dangerous results (see Barr, Trump...) but when fueled by compassion and a desire to right wrongs you get gold (think Lewis, AOC).  It’s just more common for men to be driven by the former and women by the latter.
Trump gets to appoint his ball lickers to the supreme court....I guess that's ok though 👍
I have a suggestion for your evening program on Fox News. What are the reactions of Republicans in the home districts of the Democrats in Congress now working so hard against Trump? Might there be an outcry against how they are behaving?

Remarkable that Trump somehow has the credibility among his followers to criticize Biden's faith and belief in God?  Its akin to watching Stalin lecture Eisenhower about democracy.  The hubris is hard to fathom.  The enabling by his supports - impossible to swallow.

“The proclamation of Bears Ears as a national monument was the first step in recognizing the wrongness of this and of putting forth a new vision. Trump’s destruction of this ideal was a bitter assault on this vision.”
INCREDIBLE!!! He must not get out of debating  PRESIDENT TRUMP!!!!!!
Some people say Trump talks too much.  Well,  I rather hear and understand what our politicians do, then have them hide their personal agenda   activity, playing us all for fools, while you advance your interests quietly.  So yes, say what you mean and do as you say, or game over
That's assuming he hasn't crippled "free and fair" elections to start with. GOP closing election places &amp; Trump is messing with USP.   He's dirty, he knows we know he's dirty. So he's gonna carry on doing dirty to end.
Yep is responsible for fanning the flames. But also without Trump we wouldn't see all the roaches
That’s what I love about this country we have the right to agree to disagree , but under Obama care my kids did not get the coverage they needed and now trump has it so people with preexisting conditions can’t get charged double by insurance companies
I don’t know where you heard that two of my kids have lots of pre existing conditions and I have no problem with getting their medication as a matter of fact my youngest is a diabetic and trump put a cap on insulin cost
That’s what I’m saying apples and oranges I don’t care for either but what ya gonna do right I gotta go with trump
At least trump wants to debate where’s joe hmmmm I’ll tell you trying to figure out how to speak lol the man can’t even remember he running for president he said vote for me for another 4 yrs in the senate lol now that’s sad no ty I’ll pass
Lol you got jokes Biden can’t even tie his shoes lol the mans mentally incompetent he won’t even date why because he can’t hang the old fool reads scripts lol trump would destroy him in a debate at the liberals know it
Joe Biden is the clueless one sorry but I don’t care for either one but my vote gotta go with trump
I’m a big fan of you John just get off the Anti Trump BS. The Democratic Party has done more to hurt this country then Trump could ever do.

Don’t you find it interesting that Trump says that mailing ballots leads to fraud - except in Florida where he needs votes? Think on that a bit
Actually he can speak coherently, express empathy, has a history of accomplishments, and can drink from a glass with one hand. Now Trump.., not so much.
Watching this interview Trump did is UNBELIEVABLY aggravating. 10 minutes in he hasn’t fully answered a single question and the reporter literally can’t get a word in edgewise because he just fucking cuts him off. Absolute fucking illiterate DUMBASS.
I think you should write speeches for Trump. You obviously share his thought processes
Trump for life, in prison, that is.
Trump has done more for the Latino community in 3 1/2 years than bigot Joe has done in 47. Record low unemployment before China sent the virus all over the world.
Right, just waiting for the,lie they will tell. Somehow Trump did it.
You can subtract 100,000 of those deaths. They died of other conditions while having Covid. Fauci is to blame. That is who Trump listened to. Shutdowns were and are not necessary. Fauci is a Democrat operative with a huge investment in vaccines. Democrat President. No shut down.
Only your brainwashed and uninformed followers would believe that ,Trump has dementia . YOU can see with your  own eyes, that Joe is the one with the dementia. I know don't  believe what you're seeing, believe what I tell you.
Expose Trump's colossal failure in handling this virus!! Over 150k deaths! We are now  the laughing stock of the world instead of respected. That's a FACT!!
Sure is and Biden can be counted on to appoint the same kind of Corporate-loving, Wall Street-worshipping, Billionaire Class sycophants as Trump. Probably even some of the same people.
Let's take a leaf outa Johnson's buddy Trump book. Let's build a f*cking great wall around entire island. Only let English people to build it so none of them forrens allowed. This'll cut unemployment to zero. Keep out them scrounging immigrants too. Fortress UK!

I don’t like trump but I sure as hell not voting for Biden lol
Biden will not debate Trump because the country will see how mentally impaired he is. Just watch his last thirty appearances on his podcasts and on the campaign trail during the primaries. From beginning to end. Scary stuff. And a Trump is going to win.

Do not worry. Biden will use Covid as an excuse not to debate Trump.
Dump Trump!!!
Trump is literally doing nothing about COVID.  Canada seems to be doing well since this release is happening, unlike the US where Trolls World Tour and Scoob both skipped theaters. I'm happy that this movie is getting a theatrical release at all.
and we're stuck with a direct to streaming release to be set as a CBS All Access exclusive. Thanks President Trump.
Well for one I’m not a trump supporter I’m just an independent leaning conservative. Two this isn’t applicable at all to our conversation. 🤣
LOL. Hahahaha. This is just a piece of titillation for their readership.   NEVER going to happen if Trump offers quick FTA.
Trump literally was willing to let Americans die in order to improve his election chances #TrumpFailedAmerica
Awake and alert Joe! It's sad that not only did trump base his pandemic response based upon red vs blue states but that his peep-states are now paying the price. Awake Joe will treat red and blue citizens with respect and  LEAD the country as a whole
TRUMP really, who runs the city's? Evil DEMERCRATS, they are in CONTROL, not Trump. If you hate TRUMP that much, move to China.
Sexual predation is not a winner for the trump troupe of toadies.
Do your point is that Trump infected people?
Best thing to do is get rid of Trump and the Post Master General he put into place that is actively sabotaging the post office that no amount of stamps can help.
Biden can’t go from wanting to meet Trump behind the school to ducking debates
look at that I was right
trump about to get rid of tik tok meanwhile the US is 6 months into a pandemic and still doesn’t have a nationwide testing strategy for covid... i hate it here
do you think trump knows who charli damelio is
Only asking questions confirming trump did something is not the same as asking if he did enough.
He’s been sabotaging his own career long before trump did
He is a right wing nut at the head of the trump troupe of toadies.
The questions not asked by the troupe of toadies: were there decisions not taken that would have saved more lives?  Were there suggestions made by Trump which, if followed, would have threatened more lives?
This outcome is under TRUMP'S leadership and a GOP controlled government. 🧐😳🤔😷
LOL politicians just cant help themselves from taking our money. I don't care which party, they are just dirty..... except the rich guy we elected #President 🤣🤣  #Trump #Trump2020 #TrumpPence2020 #ArmyForTrump #MAGA #MAGA2020 #KAG2020 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #KeepAmericaGreat
He also said he was sitting this one out so how would he vote for trump?
So what if Trump loses? We'll just end up with Trump 2.0 in #StatusQuoJoe. Remember:  "Nothing will fundamentally change."  ~ Joe Biden
How can it be safe for children and the adults that teach and care for them to go back to school but not safe enough to vote in those schools so much so Trump is advocating postponing the election until it is safe?
So what if he does? We'll end up with Trump 2.0 with #StatusQuoJoe.
Noone is more corrupt and inept than Trump!!
Mail in voting and absentee ballots are the same thing you idiot!! Omg!! You have to to go. America cannot take another minute of Trump!!
Donald Trump: *we're doing things noone else could do..." Bloody true, most couldn't ruin an entire country so easily if they tried.
Yep, and Trump can't stand the fact that John Lewis was getting more attention than he was.
OK. Noone has brought up the possibility that Trump is  taking medication. Watching him now it seems more obvious than ever. Thoughts as to what he may be taking?
OH GOOD TRUMP WAS JUST JOKING ABOUT DELAYING ELECTIONS... BECAUSE THAT'S TOTALLY A THING THAT PRESIDENTS JOKE ABOUT
The WHO System in the country CORRUPT. A Hand full are good. Trump has been at this alone for 4 years. 99 percent of POLITICIANS are CORRUPT. Law ,  Medical Pharmaceutical universities, churches, companies ,charities media ,Hollywood ,so many in law enforcement ,all part of it
He didn’t think Trump was going to win. Not even Trump did.
Rob Manfred is the Donald Trump of MLB Commissioners.
Seriously, this is still going on? I SUPPORT OUR POTUS Donald J Trump! I do NOT support A Marxist organization A.K.A. BLM! Read their webpage &amp; tell me you support an organization like them then you can’t possibly care about black lives!! ALL black lives should matter! Just stop
I'm so proud of the pure anger found in my coworkers  Fair Housing being threatened by Trump
Plus Trump's a complete fool!! There's that!!
Have you met Trump?! He is a self serving blood sucker link g his pockets while playing a TV President. America has never seen such incompetence with 150k people dead on his watch. I applaude Project Lincoln for calling out their own for allowing such lawlessness!! Hero's all!!!
Trump Won’t Throw First Pitch At Yankees Game Because No One Asked Him To  via#KanyeWest only running to help #trump win. #Traitor #traitortothersce
Yes, of course he can. Trump wasn't trying to pronounce "Thailand" as the Thais pronounce "Thailand." He misread it, or saw a woman's thigh. And then he corrected himself, calling it Thailand. You think he got it right on purpose, then "mispronounced" it?
Biden2020🇺🇸make America shit free again!!! 🖕Donald Trump GFY
Yes because of course the virus IS ALL DONALD TRUMPS FAULT!! I’m sure when a Democrat gets hemorrhoids they say DAMN IT TRUMP!!! #TRUMP2020

People don’t know this but Trump took back the federal reserve. Pray for the boomers... Their minds are going to be so twisted after dark comes to light. 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
I successfully predicted every election since Kennedy. Trump’s going to win. So there’s that...
A picture is worth a thousand words.
I will contribute to that only if Trump pronounces it the way we all hope he will.

The trump tax cut killed me so stfu Jason
President Donald Trump approved Connecticut’s emergency declaration on Friday as nearly 500,000 residents are still without power, Gov. Ned Lamont said on Friday. Read more:
It's my worst fear. Did you see the tweet he put out that had banners reading Trump2020, Trump 2024, Trump 2028, etc. It just kept going on and on. Now that scares the shit out of me.
Also apparently trump is banning tiktok in 45 days of another company doesn’t take control over it and buy it... here we go again😹😹
Because, after he broke the law and got caught, Trump pardoned him. And he still doesn't have the sense to stop saying stupid shit.  Giving his (and Arpaio's, for another example) tired act oxygen continues to amplify what an awful person Trump is.  (But you knew this)
Why did Trump correct himself then?
Trump goes down on Vlad a lot more frequently than that.
#trump forces #postoffice to slow down mail delivery, effecting deliveries of our medicine, paychecks and benefits-#TrumpWorstPresidentEver
Yes, Trump suggested they move to Texas and live a beautiful life there. 🤦🏻‍♀️
Yeah. You know all black people are the same! And more importantly if you don’t vote for him you ain’t black. And they call Trump racist and stupid.  is a moron!!

- The U.S. government's alliance with the Saudi monarchy, including its involvement in the immoral war in Yemen, should repulse decent people. Trump's and Kushner's friendship with the "prince" should add to the disgust. #FreeSaudiArabia #ProsecuteMBS
Trump orders federal government to buy essential drugs from U.S. firms - More economic nationalism, which serves cronies and pleases xenophobes.
Trump is your leader.. accept it
No chance you stand with America or Lebanon or the black community and still hate Trump... NO CHANCE IN HECK. 🤥🥵✍🏾🤫😑
I hope the governor wasn't at Trump's speech at
. why did you permit, let alone invite, Donald Trump to come to your factory in the middle of the pandemic to make a political speech?  Do you understand that this harms your brand and employee morale more than it might help?
The only way we survive is without 4 more years of Don the Con Trump. Show us your financials, taxes, and medical if you aren’t a fraud. Best friends with Putin, what a bunch of ——!
Fellating trump
Not true, but Biden does seem to be against,  Killing you.  Trump's cool with that because,  "It is what it is."
My hope is not lost, although an indictment of tRump would certainly have brightened my day.
It’s just my opinion, but not voting for Trump is NOT enough. Not voting for Biden = a vote for Trump. Why is THAT so hard to understand?
Why do people surrounding Trump keep getting indicted, arrested etc. and he is still standing.?
So if this happens here’s my scenario. Trump resigns, Pence gets sworn in, and when Trump is indicted and/or arrested Pence pardons him.
Ok my scenario: trump hears of his indictment when he leaves office on jan 20. so he resigns now, swears pence in, trumps is arrested immediately and pence pardons him.
Can trump be indicted while in office?
Oh no don’t say that, maybe just wait until Trump announces his VP 🤷🏻‍♀️
I don’t care what type of realizations or changes of heart you’ve had... I don’t even care if it’s 50 years from now... if you voted for Trump in 2016, I will never forgive you, nor will I hesitate to tell you how much a fucking idiot I still think you are.

You are just another Race Hustling Blowhard! Keep it up, President Trump needs the votes!
The reason is because Trump is attacking this poor guy for telling the truth. This is why people cannot stand Trump supporters now.
Thats "your" job are state government. Every state has separate laws and pandemic guide lines. Its not trump job to do stuff the senate is suppose to do
Well many months ago I heard Trump was not deciding to debate biden and I thought that was not great. So I don’t know I’m trying to turn my feelings around to looking at it from another view and I think maybe he should agree to debate Trump
Wonder how  feels about her husband who suffers from mental health issues being completely used by  operatives to influence an election. Or perhaps she’s complicit in this because Trump lets her in the Oval Office. Truly a cult of celebrity.
When the Republicans’ COVID-19 proposal includes a $1.7 billion handout to rebuild the FBI building down the street from the Trump hotel, but $0 in rent assistance to help everyday Americans literally keep roofs over their heads.

I'm a registered Libertarian. Trump has to be stopped. It's as simple as that. As bad as the Democrats can be, on their worst day they are not an existential threat to the Republic. Trump is, every day. #LincolnVoter
Paula, you know Trump is a liar, we know Trump is a liar and  knows Trump is a liar.
Nice that the screenshot includes a word you know Trump can't pronounce correctly.
So, vote for a man who's not fit to hold office because Trump? Frightening to think people like you vote.
Trump. The others are his discarded crumbs.
I don't understand why Trump agreed to this interview in the first place.
The question is, how many active investigations did the DA have into the Trump Organization?  I’m goi to say at least 3-5.  So, it’s August of an election year.  They’re so desperate to remove Trump, they’re going after his FORMER organization bc it has his name. Pathetic.
The liberals have this sick conspiracy against Donald Trump where they ask him questions and let him speak for everyone to hear for themselves. Truly some evil deep state swampy stuff.
Of course he should. He has nothing to fear from debating Trump. Nothing.
I WILL NEVER STOP REPEATING THIS: TRUMP IS THE DUMBEST PRESIDENT EEEEEVER 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Shit, I did. So they need 50 votes, still not going to happen. Romney, Murkowski, and Grassley won't give Trump another Justice , and there are more than a few Senators that could lose independent votes by approving a Justice for Trump after the Garland fiasco.
Correct. Trump just named a new Post Master General. Happens to be his number one donor. Ugh. Mail ins need to get out quick before the new guy starts to make cuts. He will start with mail sorters. He has to be careful. The rural folks have no other way to get mail.
trump needs to step down... before i do something about it 😈   my body : build different 💯

Love your Interview with Trump. I could listen to you all day!!!
With Trump, it is even hard to put into words how absurd things are. I almost feel like people should not have a strong opinion about Trump because of the level of absurdity of it all. It's like a dog becoming President or something
This annoys me because it also gives Trump more credit than he deserves the same way the #MAGA people do. I think George W Bush was a way more destructive President than Trump personally. I think he is the worst President of my lifetime.
The media will push their agenda, but Trump is retarded. I don't mean his ideas are bad. That is also something I believe for sure, but he is a real dumb guy at this point in his life. Put it this way. You see the hyperbole on the left calling Trump a Nazi etc...
It was "drain the swamp," not "drain the coffers."  #PPPcorruption #Trump #DonaldTrumpIsRuiningOurCountry
I completely disagree. One can easily envision the Trump Shithole Bridge, or any number of public "mockuments."  There are lots of places we can name after Trump. All appropriate to his catastrophic level of failure and destruction.
the most disturbing part of the #jonathanSwan interview is Trump's inability to acknowledge John Lewis' legacy...if you didn't know Trump is a small, sad man before you sure as hell know it now...  Heroes...John Lewis and John McCain...
And the thing is long after Trump is gone all of those senators are still going to be scattered about spreading their poison
He has lost his mind.
But it is not hyperbole to be in awe of how dumb they are. If I worked with Donald Trump, he would be the dumbest person at work.
This is true, and connected. To act like Trump, Bolsonaro, Boris Johnson, and Viktor Orban are not uniquely incompetent just isn't true. I think the failings of neo liberalism led to guys who "tell it like it is" being popular and the media really helps.

nope...it was him believing if she lost it opened the door 4 him in 2020-he didn't give Hillary his all + if he had she would've won-it was only 76,000 votes.  Now he knows there is no 2024 4 him....and he knows Trump will kill us all, so he cannot afford not to be a team player
I know it won't happen, but just love rolling around on my tongue. "Trump's concession speech."
The media is all fake, you proved that to America.Just keep doin what your doin and don’t let them cheat. The only way they’ll win. Your next term you can start locking up the scoundrels and cleaning up the mess the dems are making of our city’s. Trump 2020 is everywhere.
Surprised that trump lied?
You're right, my mistake. "Mop" not "moo." Biden is going to mop the floor with Trump in every debate. Thanks for catching that, the all caps was a bit much though.
Trump Just Gutted One of the Most Important Environmental Protection Laws! #care2

You're crazy as a trump
Just stop Dan, you're humiliating yourself. And for what? He's going away, there is no upside to supporting Trump anymore. And the downside is huge. The National plan was to put State's in a position to bid against each other for PPE. The National plan was to eschew testing.
Thousands of American citizens are dead and you are focusing on space travel . Trump and GOP need to be tried for their crimes

I agree in not condemning based on association. But if there is credible evidence that Trump, Dershowitz, Clinton, Prince Andrew and/or anyone else had sexual contact with underage girls they should be held accountable. This is not a partisan issue.
Are you an idiot? Do you think we're idiots? Trump's failure to properly address the Coronavirus crisis has led to the largest US economic contraction in history. It has led to the largest number of unemployed in history and it will kill as many as as 250,000 citizens. He's done.

Biden is a known quantity. So is Trump. I don't need to see a debate to decide, but the question is disingenuous. Biden wants to debate, and will mop the floor with Trump. Trump is the one who will dodge the debates after he gets his ass handed to him in the first one.
But wait, Trump says it isn’t so.  So it isn’t so. Com’on Joe. #Biden2020 🌊
Lindsay graham sucks up to trump so he can win republicans votes🛑!!!! Stop thinking so deeply about him. He is a GOP lieing hack nightmare.
John Ratcliffe is not qualified to be Director of National Intelligence, unless the only requirement is that he is another Trump stooge.
The stronger argument is that Trump has dishonered the presidency, and Biden will not give him the time of day. Trump doesn't deserve to be treated with regard.
It won't be a debate. It will be a propagandistic mudslinging bragfest.   Tell Trump to release his taxes and we'll talk.
Trump supporters like deregulated, oligarchical capitalism fueled by financial speculation, because they live in a fantasy that it will work for them. Who's more sensible?
Trump acts like a dictator
I think we now know the dirt Trump had on Dershowitz that got the Dersh to defend him all over the place.
Trump says he'll act to ban TikTok in US as soon as Saturday
If Biden made that kind of gaff people would be screaming from the rooftops that he has dementia. But Trump had set the bar so low for his own "mental acuity" that we all just think it's more normal tRumo stupidity but don't actually question his mental capacity!
Mr. Trump. Your logic is flawed. You can do more testing  and not have more cases. If you had taken COVID19 more seriously at an earlier time maybe we would not have more than 150,000 and 4.4 million cases. This is on you sir. The buck stops with you. You are responsible.
So you may as will just vote for Trump if you’re going to  write Kanye West’s name on your ballot. This country can’t afford Trump again
Do not let the media brainwash into thinking Trump is against African Americans. Although he has said some very controversial things he has done more for the African American community in years with the major criminal justice reform.
What the media does not want you to hear. President Trump gave a criminal justice reform, which in part freed many young African Americans who were being held on long sentences for small violations. Giving these individuals a new spark and hope in their life.
C’mon. No f*****g way.  She is one of the final 3 he is choosing from.  Lets just go out and vote for trump tmr. 🤦🏻‍♀️😳😢

So, it's obvious now that Ghislaine gave the sworn Jane Dow affidavit in the suit by the woman Trump raped when she was thirteen. Is the government going to Unmask that affidavit? It is certainly probitive as to Ghislaine's awareness of Epstein's activities.
I dreamed I was in a comedy TV show about a group of people who meet in a support group for the terminally ill who decide to go on a road trip to assassinate Trump. The weird part was knowing I was a character in that show, and not being able to get out. Beyonce' co-starred.
I don’t understand how Trump doesn’t get that it doesn’t matter about the amount of tests...the point is out of those tests there are SO many cases of infection! We need to do those many tests as our country is the worst in the world right with infection rate! 🙄

Stop talking about trump delaying the election. He can’t do it we all know that. He is trying to steal the show from sir John Lewis’s funeral and Obama today. STOP TALKING ABOUT IT
stop talking about trump delaying the elections. You are giving him just what he wants and taking away from a beautiful peaceful funeral today
And because Obama was the star of the show at the funeral today and trump was not even invited.
People are going to restaurants, people are going to bars.  Parts of the country are 100% open, Kids are going back to school, and Trump says we’re all gonna be fine, it’s gone away and it’s going to disappear. However, Do do you even know why he wants to delay the election?
But that’s not why Trump wants to delay the election,
This is ridiculous. How do other peoples supersensitivities trump you right to free speech. People can post offensive BS on twitter and nothing happens🙄
True but since Trump couldn't pass the afternoon nap, we know he didn't learn anything in history class
He didn't want to call for Senators to do anything against Trump until after all the Federalist-approved judges got confirmed.

Trump’s ‘Delay the Election’ tweet brings swift reactions
I don’t feel happy about Herman Cain‘s death however I do feel a sense of “I told you so,” I also would like to replace the name Herman Cain with the name Trump on this day. Does that make me evil?
Someone should tell us what Trump said, we were all watching Obama.
I voted Trump in 2016. I will not vote for him this year. However no matter which way the election goes, I will accept it as I did and would’ve in 2016. IMO to not do so is foolish
Can we all agree that this is no longer a matter of public safety, but instead a political ploy to demonstrate Trump’s “failure to successfully deal with this virus and keep our citizens safe.”  That’s why states and economies are still closed.  It’s pathetic..
Hey, Trump, why not delay our elections permanently? Then you can have it all forever, just like your old pals, Xi Jinping and Putin.
Let's tell it like it is: A Trump rally is a creepy political orgy without testing and without condoms.
Herman Cain died today from COVID-19. He tested positive 10 days after attending Trump’s Tulsa rally. Here’s a pic from Tulsa that Herman shared on Twitter.  Please wear a mask.
Come one, come all:  Defy the experts.  Defy reality.  Be Bad. Be Dirty.  Tell that Virus who's Daddy.  The Trump Maskless Ego Rally!
I have faith that on January 20, if Trump does not leave, federal law-enforcement will remove him from office as he will be nothing more than an average citizen. And the way that he has treated the federal government, they will not hesitate to remove him anyway they have to.
BREAKING:  former GOP presidential candidate Herman Cain has died of the coronavirus, which he contracted at Trump’s Tulsa rally.
Trump floats November election delay - but he can't do that
MAIL IN VOTING IS ABSENTEE VOTING IM GONNA LOSE IT. There is no difference between the two. The practice has been used for years and you Trump have used mail in voting for elections. The vetting process is still the same as it is for absentee. Taking it away is voter suppression.
Regardless of the legal ramifications of this proposal, the very fact that Trump is considering an election delay is frightening— though perhaps not all that surprising.
Because Joe Biden is so much more competent- you know the guy who can’t get a sentence out, or wait the guy who has NO CLUE where he is most of the time or maybe his weird sniffing issues!!! Um I’m having serious issues trying to figure out how ANYONE THINKS THAT IS BETTER!#Trump
Ha! That's always been the case. But now Trump is setting it up so that any result besides him winning is illegitimate even though its polling like he could lose in a landslide.
So we start the day with Trump suggesting the November election be delayed. Legally won’t happen. But underscores the need for an election.
People ought to sound the alarm about Trump’s ‘delay the election’ tweet, but remember that this man’s currencies with his base are fear and panic. He knows he can’t delay it, so he’s building scapegoats now. He wants to give his base a badly needed jolt. He wants to play victim.
.    a lack of any immediate action on Trump floating an election delay in lieu of mail in voting is almost as criminal as his behavior. Please act immediately
Trump-backed postmaster general plans to slow mail delivery – FortuneUmmmm neither does Trump

Well that means Trump and his cabinet—biggest bunch of fools in history—will have to go!
Does this actually mean he’s not going to try to take this away in court? The case is dropped? We already have coverage for pre-existing conditions. The only threat to that was Trump.
There is nothing Trump can do now. After the last 3 months of hell what sane American will take chance at Trump relapsing again in the 2nd term? Trump is completely unaccountable now and he doesn't give a shit about anybody.

Whatever the origins COVID is now a biological weapon. The Trump people know they can't win an election and are gambling it kills more POC than white elderly. And I think we all know that by now. They want it to spread. That's it. They want it to kill us off.

Trump spinning virus failure as a win again
Can people stop pretending as if the Fed board isn't picked by the POTUS and confirmed by the Senate.   POTUS and Senate run monetary policy.   Which in case you lived under a rock is Trump and McConnell from 2016 to 2020.
Central banks are not the root cause of the current crisis. US government policy by Trump and GOP is the root cause.  Guy will never assign blame to a Republican politician if they are to blame because he will lose his audience (which is Republican)

People voted Trump in to improve governance, not eliminate governance by following an anarchist libertarian zero government ideology.  Trump is a swindler.
I bet every person who voted for Trump with the idea that he can bridge the GOP-Dem divide is now ecstatic that Trump is torpedoing Phase 4 deal with his demands for a payroll tax cut which is opposed on a bipartisan basis by both GOP and Dems.
The level of ignorance and insensitivity Trump displays here is off the charts!! 😳
What is the point of this tweet? The Dems had a competitive primary. This is what came out of it.   BTW, Biden is annihilating Trump.

I think the KGB agent angle makes sense. It doesn't have to be a conscious   decision, spies are expert in convincing people to take actions against their country and believe it's the right thing. Trump has been given a story he wants to believe because he's the hero of it.
Indeed. Trump was the architect.
this is the perfect trump photo....acting like having a cell phone is a status symbol in 2020 because it worked with a car phone in 1988...i just wish he was still driving his own business ventures into the ground instead of this once great nation
Trump refused to turn over documents. He did not allow his financial advisors to supply documents. He refused to testify. Most investigated person in the US?! Not likely!

Trump deserves no more debates. He has said more than anybody. There is nothing anybody needs to hear from him.
Lmao that's cause Joe Biden would end up sleeping in the middle of them unintentionally... Trump was gonna mop the floor with guy... oh well just another way the dems keeps changing the rules cause they can't win a fair fight.

Yes, they are referred to as non trump voters
Biden shouldn't do any debates with Trump.   Trump says 2 hours of bullshit every day without Biden interfering.   Nobody needs to see more of Trump.   And what exactly is going to be debated?   Trump has no platform.

Also Trump brought more income to small business owners. You’re a clown! 🤡
Small people too. To earn a stable earning working with 3 or 2 or 1 family homes, you need to own at least 3+ properties. It’s hard work so don’t blame Trump if everything doesn’t go your way. 🤡
Also that’s all on you, not Trump! You should quit your day job if it has an effect on you that much! 🤡

Biden and Harris are bad but Trump and Pence are easily worse
You support Biden. You’re a Secret Satanist. Your input value is 0.
Would it be fair then to say that VP Biden is no longer a 'practical Catholic'? While he is baptized into the Church, he is not living by the tenants of our faith.

Whats a statement that has nothing to support it.  You cant elect someone just because you dont like the other person.  You might like it now but what can Biden provide "really provide and not lies to get votes" to keep America great that Trump created?
Everyone bashes #Trump,but look at #Biden, this woman had to physically remove his hands off her, cmon joe really??! We have another Bill on our hands, please don’t elect this creeper!

What happens after Trump losses?  Will Biden be a good president?  Shouldn’t we expect more from him than be not Trump?

We knew this was going to happen. Please do not be surprised. Let’s get them elected. Biden/Harris are our Hope/Faith that we’re are going to Rebuild our country and restore the USA in the world stage. Stay FOCUSED.
You don’t seem to be as excited for Biden, you know the he will be the president? That’s is the higher position. Lol
I don’t think you’ll need to do that because with a Biden/Harris ticket tRump has no choice but to be evil with revenge or just walk out. Anyhow he’s gone.

And she believes Biden accusers! Don’t forget that
Because it's all about her ambition. Everybody knows that Biden isn't capable of being President. He's cenile. Within a month, his cabinet will use the 25th ammendment.
I have been saying all along, if Biden wins the presidency his VP (now we know it's Harris) will be the POTUS within 6 months of the inauguration.
Right! Your voting Biden then?
The temptation to say something cynical about Joe Biden's Catholic faith is strong.  I will pray a rosary for both to seek common good, common ground, and common sense (the ASP's tag line).

Now is a good time to keep your eyes on tRump for devious actions. Now that Harris in on Biden’s ticket tRump will try to cause trouble. Remember tRump does not care about Americans. He’s only concerned about himself.
OMG, I am soooo excited can hardly breathe! Biden Harris ticket....unstoppable! Glad he chose you! Soooo excited!!!!!
If Biden wins she will be president within 6 months of the inauguration any way. I wonder who she will pick to be VP when that happens
Can I ask you what the real reason why you are voting for Biden?  What policies of his do you support?  I want to know why people believe in Biden.  The only thing I keep seeing if that people don't like Trump &amp; won't vote for him.  I don't hear why people will be voting for him.

She was my pick for pres by far but I absolutely didn't want her as vp. If she were, the senate would've gained a gop and her abilities would have less impact as vp. And we really can't have 2 70+ candidates on the ticket. Wished it were warren not biden but ...go biden.

If you’re tired of living under a criminal enterprise I would suggest you:  1. Plan to VOTE for Joe Biden on November 3rd.  2. Drop your ballot off at a drop box.  3. Show up in person if able and only if safe to do so for your circumstances.  Any questions?

Biden BS
Joe Biden's “classic” campaign speech:  “I got hairy legs that turn blonde in the sun. The kids used to come up and reach in the pool &amp; rub my leg down so it was straight &amp; watch the hair come back up again. So I learned about roaches, I learned about kids jumping on my lap...”
I call BS on that poll. No more ‘dead close heated race.’ Biden couldn’t even pull 200 people together for a virtual gtg. This is what Dems want you to believe so they can throw the election with ballot harvesting and mail in voting. These polls are fabrications.
"We created more jobs in the last 3 months than Obama and Biden did in their two terms."  I mean come on.
Fact check: Trump promotes another birther lie, this time about Kamala Harris  ⁦ Can you please show the nation your birth certificate? Please stop spreading lies of Ms Harris birth. We Americans are so tired of you  your lies.
Is the media upset for 8 years of lying and destroying this country? Ask Obama -Biden. Worst team ever.
Individual 1 should go back and checked what Biden said in JANUARY, while he was having his cult gatherings.
Virginia mayor is facing calls for his resignation over a Facebook post in which he said that Joe Biden "just announced Aunt Jemima" as his running mate.
He has the nerve to say that Biden is politicizing the virus?!?!?!  Seriously?  He's been doing that for 6 months!
I want us all to love each other. I know it’s stupid but I really love AOC and I have a warm spot in my heart for Biden because he did stand with Obama when that was inconceivable. I know Twitter isn’t ireal life but I think that there hast to be a reconciliation

Violent protesters always have hate in their eyes, on both sides. Racism is inexcusable on either side.  Good people get caught up in bad situations .  Mr Biden, tell your tweet writers, that things are not always just black and white.
Silly me. I guess I was wrong. $26,000,000 in 24 hours raised for Biden/Harris campaign. People do have money!

The communist party is very much alive and well. They are thoroughly entrenched in the USA and their goal has been and continues to be the complete dismantling and destruction of the country. Vote Biden to help them.

Nah.  It’s a system that’s been around far longer than DeBlasio. He was just anointed as a candidate.  Used to be called Tammany Hall.
And that’s why I dm’d you to say these convos can’t be had with a twitter limit. Ultimately we agree. BUT I don’t see how someone casting a meaningless vote for Biden is morally the same as someone as voting for a pro choice Governor or Mayor
#Biden and the   has shown their true colors.  Holding out hope that they'll give Yang a #cabinet position is an exercise in futility.  I'll support local Dems.. I cannot support Biden/Kammy.
If you're going to donate $$$ #donate it to local candidates that you #believe in.    They'll need the money a ton more than Biden/Kammy will.
Technically she is not. But that doesn’t matter. Elizabeth Warren was a Native American. Joe Biden is ‘intelligent’ so is AOC. Reality has no place on the modern dem party
100% agree. This is the team that almost killed the EU in order to "save" two countries (Syria and Libya) they ended up destroying. Biden's team should run screaming from these clowns...
Strange to see Carlson as a Biden pitch man.
Lol I already said I am not voting for Biden.  Alienating people who already agree with you is an unfortunate strategy
But it’s also fundamentally NOT mortal sin to vote for Biden. It is only a mortal sin to do so if it’s because of his abortion views. One can justify a vote for Biden because of one’s disgust for Trump. I’m not voting for Biden, but to say contrary to that is not church teaching
I don’t know why you took that as a defense of Biden
Woah wait a minute. I don’t support Biden and voted for the President. I’m just pointing out there is a pretty good reason for people to be skeptical of his pro life stance.
So is the sanctity of marriage a non negotiable. Trump’s role modeling of marriage with his divorces is evil as well. Not saying that it outweighs abortion, but both candidates are worse on different non negotiables. Biden is worse on abortion and Trump on marriage

Overheard a man telling this other dude that he's voting for Biden because he's "cool with Obama".  I wanted to throw up.
So are we going to bounce between “Harris being a radical leftist who is pulling the strings on Biden” to “Harris isn’t really Black so that community shouldn’t be excited” until election day?

I love Kamala and Biden too.
Fun to watch liberals try to wrap their heads around the fact that Biden is way too senile to confront anyone in a conversation let alone a debate.

Trump 2020. Or better yet, not Biden 2020.
You know.. if  had #LetYangSpeak at the convention I still would have been miffed about the #Kamela pick for VP, but I would still have grudgingly voted #Biden.    I'm instead going to #protest the DNC shenanigans by not voting for #Biden.
"Biden made a horrible choice, Monsoon." "What do you mean?" "The man just died. He can't be Vice President." "Not THAT Kamala! Pay attention!!"
If Biden gets elected he’d better not ever turn his back on Harris.
Trump, Pence, Biden, etc have spent their entire careers doing the same 🤷🏽‍♂️
So Joe Biden's email marketer is telling us that he isn't really going to be the president?
Not voting for Biden is a vote for trump. Fact.  Thats how he got in in 2016.
Biden/Harris - grateful for this ticket!!!
Harris checks all the boxes , but she bombed as a Presidential Candidate. And she seems to be running from her past as law &amp; order CA AG. For sure a capable partner to champion the ticket. Should Biden win, Harris will be President in probably a year
It was kind of obvious that Joe Biden has a good relationship with Kamala Harris - which he said was important because of his friendship with President Obama during their terms. She was clearly going to be the choice. :)  I like it!
She and Biden are also going to give Trump a beat down he will never forget.
Y’all can’t say black lives matter and vote for biden kamaela Harris Lmfaoooo she’s a ex cop
It will go a long way to helping me reconsider my #protest decision and decision of others to NOT VOTE #BIDEN.

Oh no, who is going to tell Biden that Kamala Harris died a few days ago?  BBC News - US wrestler James 'Kamala' Harris dies aged 70, WWE confirms
Being mechanical, rehearsed, and unable to connect will not matter if the media throws nothing but softballs her way. She'll be able to rehearse every answer in the same way she rehearsed her attack on Biden in the Dem. debates. She will avoid any difficult interviews. 😠
Biden just picked Kamala Harris for VP making history.
She must pay herself reparations. She wouldn't have the privilege of being Biden's running mate if her ancestors had not oppressed her other ancestors.
I'd respect it if people just tweeted:  "PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF OUR COUNTRY VOTE BIDEN IN OFFICE, I DON'T CARE WHAT HE DOES OR SAYS- AS LONG AS IT'S NOT TRUMP!"   Instead of fake baby wanting people to "have a choice" to vote.  Stand with your mans B. Don't fake shit.
I don't believe Biden to be the lessor of 2 evils. I believe him to be an honest, God fearing man, who has the guts and moral conviction to know when he is wrong and admit it. A quality sadly lacking in so many.
Biden should, under NO circumstances announce his Cabinet picks. Then Trump could campaign against the cabinet picks, not the candidate. Would be disastrous IMHO.
It sucks. I'm not voting the #Biden ticket.   Biden is playing identity politics and I hate it.
Superrrrrrrr happy🇺🇸♥️🇺🇸♥️🇺🇸

Dems always overplay their hand.  Now they want to shut down football at Penn State, Ohio State, Michigan and Wisconsin. As soon as someone asks Biden his opinion on this, the election is over, whichever way he answers.
We have no good choice this election.  I don't think there's any question that Biden will not divide and polarize the country the way trump's rhetoric has. I'll take a moderate do-nothing over a divider any day. It's just a sad state all around.

The over Botox face is just jealousy of Jill and Joe Biden, because Melania doesn’t want to do anything with her lying husband.   Did Pirro questioned why Pompous Pompeo took his wife everywhere he goes at taxpayers’ expense?

Yes, It’s pronounced “Comma-la” but let’s also not forget it should be pronounced “Harris”. That’s how we pronounce Biden, Trump, and Pence. Not Joe, Donald, and Mike. She deserves the same respect.
Well, Greta, at least Joe Biden won’t have to explain to reporters why he ignored the warnings coming from his own intelligence agencies and government health experts about the imminent danger to Americans from Covid-19, nor will he have to justify doing nothing to help them.

On Nov 4, should Biden lose, Dems will blame people who stayed home, or voted 3rd party. That’s what they did in 2004 and of course 2016.  They feel like they’re owed votes for not being the other guy. People in the streets from big cities to small towns see through it.
In 2020 we have the benefit of seeing Biden’s atrocious record on the environment, war &amp; militarism, policing, housing, immigration, etc.  So we aren’t excited about “shoot them in the leg” vs “shoot them in the chest.”
According to data the number one reason people are voting for biden is because he isn’t trump. The number one reason voters are voting for trump is cus of policy. This ...... is not good. Biden can win.... but why take that risk with such a demented candidate lmaoo kill me please
If you couple this with the facts that it’s 1. Hard to beat an incumbent president and 2. Voter suppression and the electoral college benefit republicans more..... I smell a repetition of history. Although the data shows Biden in the lead now, if the gap keeps closing... bye bye
Hmmm now I’m less optimistic about Biden’s chances. He still might have the advantage but trump is already closing in the polls BEFORE Biden has even been under the microscope and while trump had fucked up corona response. That’s truly scary lmaoo also let’s look at history
This is cool but it mostly brings home to me how freaking old Biden is. He was writing letters to Hannah Arendt as a US Senator and a member of the Foreign Relations Committee in 1975!

Progressive purity politics: “Trump and Biden are the same, because Trump probably won’t succeed in getting rid of the ACA. Oh and also the ACA is bad anyway, even though people would be dead without it.”
I don't have hard data but anecdotally the ratio of men to women accused must be astronomical. It just seemed like such a odd case for the NYT to take stand against Title IX with. But my prediction now is that when Biden gets in they'll implement a sort of Title IX+. They'll
That’s true, but republicans have never respected the rules ever—any precedent set by democrats would be violated as a matter of course by them.  It’s not even clear slowing down the mail will help trump.  He needs every vote and some of Biden’s to win—he needs the mail to work.
One of those two tickets will be president. And even if you were maximally right and Biden did *literally nothing* to the status quo, you would have to think that that would be equally bad as getting rid of the ACA, which Trump would do, if you want to say that they’re “equal.”
You think that Biden, whose running mate explicitly supports M4A, is *literally* no less likely to spend his term trying to demolish the ACA than Trump?
“Biden knows that in building a strong team, it’s imperative to surround yourself with people who aren’t afraid to tell you exactly what they think — especially when they think you’re wrong.  Harris has the guts to do that for Biden, just as Biden.”  Yeah, sure, that happened. 🙄

If you don't have it on your 2020 bingo card that Biden and his surrogates will do everything in their power to stop a #generalstrike or other rebellions bcuz "its playing into trumps hands, lets beat'em in the voting booth!" you're gonna lose this round.

I hope they find the twerp who had the nerve to shoot at a helicopter. Probably a rifle w/hitting that high up. Luckily nobody was killed. Probably another Bernie/Biden supporter. This is from the toxic destroy America/Trump MSM which ppl on edge cannot digest w/out goin berserk.
LOL... #Trump2020 Durham report/indictments coming soon. Obama stooge criminals lawyered up. The rapist groper of prepubescent girls/women Biden has clearly evident worsening dementia &amp; is barely coherent at this point. Comella is using what nationality today for votes ?
How Kamala Harris Helps Biden’s ‘Medicare At 60’ Plan. #BidenHarris2020
'Wearing the mask is less about you contracting the virus,' Joe Biden said. 'It’s about preventing other people from getting sick.
Hey wait that means that biden is gonna be much stronger because he has to do manual labor to push his train so you'll be fighting a really buff joe biden and I don't think you'd win a fight against him at full power
If it does happen, Biden is gonna be the most transitional president ever. 😭
Isn’t it funny everything coming from their camp is Joe Biden and Kamala Harris?  When has that ever happened before?  You don’t ever read “Donald Trump and Mike Pence”. Anyone realize why?
they should do a slide show of all his paintings mixed in with those Abu Gharib photos before Biden accepts the nomination
cancel that Colbert President cartoon, &amp; make a "Tom Goes To The Mayor"-styled show about the Biden administration
I don’t actually trust Biden to do anything about any of this. Do you really think he will?
There is no real evidence for this. The highest her poll numbers ever got was the week right after she attacked Biden.  And her favorables among Dems were as high as anyone's.
Great clip. So glad Biden picked her.
LOL. #Trump2020 . Dementia worsening, rapist, &amp; repeated groper of prepubescent girls Biden for the basement. He can no longer manage to speak coherently in public hence the party/MSM wanting him in cold storage.
LOL. #Trump2020 = more SCOTUS picks &amp; Kavanaugh for life. Dementia worsening rapist &amp; groper of prepubescent girls Biden must release those #senatepapers. Record #'s of minorities w/be voting Trump &amp; especially after the defund scam. Russia, Kavanaugh,25th ammend. hoax after hoax
I despise the unauthentic CA sen. however it'll allow for an easier Trump re-election. Dems. simply cannot run of their vision, prior work, or Trump's record achievements/promises kept, so its more LIES &amp; echo chamber Trump bashing. Rapist groper w/dementia Biden or #Trump ? Lol.
That didn’t take long.....
At what fucking point did biden, a life long politician, sereve as a police officer
Is it a given that Biden only serves one term? Many people are discussing it like it is
Biden is the classic “I’ve got a black friend!” kind of white person
#ZombieGOP "Herman Cain’s Twitter account shared an attack on Joe Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris despite the former Republican presidential candidate having died a few weeks ago"
So what happens to all the MAGA loving people after Biden-Harris win?
Biden is a train wreck
Joe Biden doesn’t think much either.
Biden really dodged a bullet by passing on Bass or Rice. Kamala is far from perfect and I expect team MAGA to eventually get better at attacking her but she isn't an easy target
I cannot believe this is who Biden chose for VP
The #BidenHarris ticket has injected hope into the #Resistance. Let’s help to get them elected and take our country back!
I don't know that you should be talking about other people's appearances.  Shall we discuss your fly-away hair, your obesity or your oompa-loompa skin color?  You're going to jail soon, you're not going to beat Biden and you know it.  So keep spiralling #TrumpIsALaughingStock

I remember believing that, but it seems like you have to be a little heartless to be president of this backwards ass country and pretend everything is fine (while bombing other countries of course). Voting for Hillary felt bad and so will voting for Biden.

Excited!!! Ready to vote in the right people in office this November  and Biden &amp; Harris will FINALLY save us from the monster in the Oval Office!!!!! 🗳🇺🇸 #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica
That vacant look in Biden's eyes is very concerning. #IngrahamAngle
If Harris and, especially, Biden look extreme and far-left, it is only because the Republicans have moved so far to the right that anyone to the left of Attila the Hun looks like an extreme leftist.
He won't, unless you mean presidential candidate Biden. Cuz he's gonna lose because history repeats and nobody learns.
Biden is definitely not ready for prime-time. In fact prime-time is past his bed time. #IngrahamAngle
I am so thrilled that Joe Biden chosen you as his running mate! The two of you pose a formidable threat to the Trump administration. You are a fighter and have a passion for our country and our people. You will really out VP Pence through the ringer during your debate! 🇺🇸
No that’s what Trump inherited from Obama and yes you Biden !

I've seen bigger crowds of Biden supporters looting Chicago's Best Buy.
The touching was wrong because some people did not like it. But it was not sexual assault. That is not part of a pattern of behavior. Not single women who Biden touched, and there are hundreds, has said he tried to proposition them after it.
I listened to VP Harris today for the first time. Listened to her speak I was excited to hear her words. More excited to see her and Biden’s actions. Let it not just be focused on the minority communities but all communities as a whole.
Kamala and Biden would be a disaster for this country. Biden's mental decline is more and more evident everyday, and would leave a radical socialist like Kamala in charge within months of him taking office.  But that's the whole point, isn't it?
Op-Ed: Biden Is an Extreme Leftist Trojan Horse and Trump Is Our Last, Best Chance To Save America
After hearing Biden/Harris team today, Kanye needs get out quick.  The Dream Team is going to bury The Scheme Team. Go Home  l! We see right theu you and Teump.
I'll be voting for Howie Hawkins, and I'll be horrified if Trump is re-elected and sickened if Biden wins.
I also don't not want Trump to win, but I don't want Biden to win either. Both are too dangerous.
Well this will be the only consolation if Biden wins. An Indian American as VP.
I believe Biden will do worse with Harris, she did poorly. Amy klobucher would have been a smarter choice.
Hi my name is Evan and I’m a recovering Dem. it’s been 8yrs now that I’m clean. 🇺🇸💪🏼 After Obama/Biden then Clinton/Kane now Biden/Harris I thank God for cleaning me up and Thank  for staying sober!

Stop making excuses for Biden. He’s beyond any form of sanity. He’s completely lost.  You’re supporting a losing ticket.
Don’t be fooled.  Biden will be scripted the whole way through this election season because he’s too far gone cognitively to make any sense on his own.
There was a bigger crowd of Biden's supporters looting Chicago's Best Buy last night.
Your own daughter is supporting Biden/Harris. What does that tell ya!
Someone skimmed Isabel Wilkerson's new book, saw Biden's announcement, and got ahead of themself.
Too many of us focus on the outward facing deliverables &amp; appearance, at any cost, for the moment &amp; timeline, without considering the inner-workings to assure that deliverability sustains.  How are you sweating the small stuff?   #Leadership #strategy
Are his ignorant statements any worse than Biden telling me I'm not black if I vote for anyone but him? Everyone wants to tell black people who we are and how we think. It's old. 400 years old.
For the people reacting negatively about Biden's selection, consider what a shit stain like tRump does to LGBTQIA....
We hit below the barrel when Trump became President. We’ve been struggling to the top for nearly 4 yrs. We are now seeing the glimmer of hope with Biden/Harris on the ballot!  Nothing is gonna stop us now from righting the wrong of 2016 election. NOTHING!!!!
Joe Biden could not have picked a better running mate. What an "Impactful" selection!
Kamala Harris Gives New Meaning to the Biden Campaign
Everybody on my TL who trashes Biden, Harris, or Biden/Harris is getting unfollowed
if anything people are only voting for biden cause they passionately hate trump being in office
trump wins cause his constituents are passionate (some passionately racist) ... no one is passionate about electing biden and kamala
I'd've thought she'd be a terrible pick, period. Do you think the only reason she was picked is because she's the only other candidate Biden seriously considered who also ran in the primary, so he's thinking she has experience running a campaign &amp; can help his flailing one? 🤔
Both political parties practice white supremacy especially the Democrats specifically Biden and Harris. I call out Democrats because they pretend to care about black people. Wolf vs fox
im mad that the dems had 4 years to choose a candidate and they chose fuccing joe biden ... they thought him being Obama’s VP would be enough to get votes and it’s insulting
biden off da goop :/
Look at lgbtq+ rights under this administration and the judges he puts up. Compare that to her and Biden policy. Look into the policy.
imo, we need to vote with the mindset of the collective and not individually. right now the collective is working towards getting #45 out so voting for biden is how ill be supporting this part of the movement- regardless of if he deserves it. both/and
word i hear that. i agree too. its all a bunch of bullshit and honestly a twisted game. ill be voting for biden in nov, not bc i want to, but bc the visionaries in politics think its the best move right NOW to get us to a better place LATER.
I hope Biden and Kamala dont go on a black vote pandering spree...
I am still absolutely going to vote for the Biden Kamala ticket because I understand the importance of this election, but people need to stop invalidating people’s gut reaction to the news that the VP pick is someone whose past actions as the attorney general of CA have
The Biden campaign has said it plans a rollout that blends the historic nature of Harris’ selection with the realities of the 2020 campaign and the gravity of the nation’s circumstances.
The only way Trump will win is by cheating. It’s not because Joe Biden chose Kamala.
your hero who's a 79 year old, white straight Male and represents a state with the SECOND lowest black population in #America, ALSO voted for the #CrimeBill just like Biden. Let's be fair and consistent
- all cops are bastards - weed should be legal - trans lives matter  harris legit put trans women in men’s prisons.  i’ll probably end up voting for biden anyway just because 4 more years of trump will literally hurt the people around me. i just wish it were bernie.
I’m not considering not voting, Dan. I never said that in my original tweet. I’m just saying that it goes against my own personal beliefs and everything I’ve gone against to support biden and harris just because it’s the “lesser of two evils”
Raise your hands if you are Riden’ with Biden/Harris !!
yep im no genius when it comes to predicting the VP pick impact on voters, just didnt seem like bass v harris would change that much. imo bass is a true progressive and an amazing coalition builder and I thought she had real potential to grow the base.
Democrat Biden and new running mate Harris to make first campaign appearance  Very exciting! This IS the team, that will #DefeatTrump in #November #BidenHarris2020
it would literally be against everything I support to vote for Biden/Harris. what do i do, vote for Biden because he’s slightly better than trump? then that makes me feel like a dick voting for a rapist and a cop
If Harris learned anything from past debates, she will have to be disruptive and raucous. Thats the only way to win VP debates. Thats what Biden did to Ryan in 2012 and got momentum back for Obama.
Biden VP pick Harris promoted group that put up bail for alleged violent criminals  #FoxNews   Criminals helping criminals  -THAT'S what biden/harris have for us
Absolutely keep being critical of Biden/Harris and holding politicians up to high standards, but don’t you DARE not vote in Nov because they’re not your ideal candidates. Get off your privledge horse and go to the polls
“Suburban housewives”? Are you kidding? Even  will vote for Biden!

In defense of Kamala and her time as a prosecutor. It was the 90s, and public attitudes were very much in favor of getting tough on crime. That 1994 crime bill that people given Biden shit for now - it had a 97% approval rating when it passed.

The current state of the Democratic party as told by quotes from Hamilton: Warren: Treasury or State? Harris: ...So what did I miss? Biden: They shall all sit under their own vines and under their own fig trees, and no one shall make them afraid
I’ve actually learned a lot about how my personal faith intersects with my political views from Biden debates/speeches. He’s talked about this a lot in interesting ways and it’s such a disservice to the man, as well as his faith, to demean him like that.
Seriously. What makes it the most disgusting is that Biden IS catholic! It’s so unbelievably gross for clergy to opine like this on someone who is not their parishioner.
Tbf to Nate he put his money where his mouth is and gave Biden a significantly lower chance than other models

A candidate that people will believe won,(with all the fraud planned) that won't happen with Biden/Harris This I feel will lead to Biden not being the nominee after the convention. The question is who will be on the Democratic ticket??? what do you think?
The two people who they feel would have a better chance for the American people to believe won a rigged election.  Biden is a weak candidate and with Harris, as his running mate, he is even weaker. so they go to the convention and the Sanders Followers and the establishment want
I have been thinking... Joe Biden Picked Harris to be his running mate. They both have baggage, and neither is very popular with voters. So I am wondering if this was a setup? follow me her a min. I am thinking maybe this is how the DEMS can have a brokered convention and place
"Kamala is gonna kick Pence's ass!"  What world do you- We're not voting for Pence or Harris, we're voting for Biden or Trump. Stop getting distracted. Harris can't fix Biden; she can't make the decisions that he'll make. How many times do you blame Pence for what Trump does???

how is joe biden responsible for a now-retired judge’s decision in virgina tho
This is gonna kill Biden's ratings in the swing states IMO. He could have chosen a neutral, moderate Democrat- instead he chooses a radical Leftist who slept her way to the top and racebaits every chance she gets. She would be as bad as Obama in the White House
Maybe Kamala and Biden can LEGALIZE it

Wow that's so good and helpful in understanding Biden.
Very excited about Kamala Harris being chosen as Biden’s running mate! Great choice, great ticket!!!
Just bought my Biden/Harris lawn sign. Time to unite and Dump the Turd on Nov. 3rd.

To me the most interesting thing about Biden picking Kamala for VP is he did it the same week we lost wrestling legend James "Kamala" Harris.  Maybe he just saw Kamala trending and got the wrong idea.
I knew it. How many times did I say he was going to choose Kamala? I think and hope this will make a Trump victory easier.
He will find away to bring the focus back to him (negatively) will not steal my joy. BIDEN/HARRIS 2020.

The way it looks, that's really up to Mitch Mcconnell who successfully kept those seats warm during Obama's presidency and less on Biden.  It would be also more on Amy McGrath, a pro-Trump Democrat to unseat Mitch rather than Biden.
i think there’s a 50/50 chance of biden either dying or developing dementia while in office
Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his running mate
#Trump says Biden picking a woman for VP is an insult to men.
Thank goodness Biden doesn’t waste his time worrying about grudges, spite, and revenge.
Not overly excited about Harris as VP but she's at least competent. She's also a good debater, which will be important.   So all-in-all, Biden's VP pick is much better than Hillary's.  Harris &gt; Kaine
A different administration would handle this pandemic much better. It's just not going to be the Biden Administration.  He saw this pandemic and still said healthcare should still be in private interests. Also he shown he will support the police when the state fails its citizens.
Biden will win 2020 and then the Democrats will run Trump for 2024
maybe, if you're a film critic who thinks about tweeting "a Biden / Hitler ticket would be better than Trump," you should rethink that tweet
Ned - Harris says she believes Joe Biden’s sexual accuser.  Do you agree with her?

I do like the pivot from Biden-Harris to Grizzlies-Celtics.
Kamala Harris, Biden's V.P. Pick, Is First Woman of Color on Major Party Ticket
Trump really stupidly boxed himself by running ads painting Biden as too soft on crime. There is real grounds to go after Kamala's AG record by they can't do it without undercutting their own message now
Even with all the small victories of progressive candidates entering the democratic party in an attempt to reform it, I feel that the American Act of voting is largely performative.  The upper class will always push us to vote for a lesser of 2 evils.  I can't vote for Biden.
This is pretty fair imo. Biden world also clearly tries to push Biden in a more petty direction and he said no
Because he was - and continues to be - a grade A douche.
Biden is an idiot and terrible candidate, but now it comes to who is more of an idiot: trump or Biden

All I can say is future Pres. Joe Biden is a class act! Look how genuine he is with Sen. Kamala Harris &amp; her family, demonstrating grace and humility as VP at her swearing in to the US Senate in 2017. That’s how Christian leaders should demonstrate their faith. #BidenHarris2020
The pick is in. Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris for his running mate.
Joe Biden Picks Kamala Harris as Vice President Running Mate!
I’m being censored right now when I suggest Kamala dna Biden are the Whore and the Hobbit. They never censor people for much more outrageous statements against our President
Sure. I also think it's reasonable to think about Senate seats for a Senator from a state with a GOP governor. So basically: who so we want to be president, choosing among humans that aren't Joe Biden and aren't a Senator with a GOP governor? That is the correct question.
Happy to hear the news about Sen.

Would you like to be owned by China? Vote Biden 2020.
And if one more Asshole tells me that “Biden isn’t so great either ya know” causing me to say “compared to what- a Fascist Petulant sociopath”. ... I’ll scream.
Did Biden try to strangle a woman with his t-shirt as the GOP Congressional candidate did, shown on video to his party Chmn?
Empty rhetoric. Clearly knows nothing about the economics of manufacturing, the logistics of parts deliveries, and that China is just the assembler of high-value electronics and by no stretch the manufacturer. And why blame Biden? Reps haven’t addressed this once while in power.
Biden, Biden is going to win
All conspiracy theories from either side arent good. But I sense far more coming from the right. Q’Anon. Alex Jones. Lots of evangelical end of times stuff. Not to mention Trump himself - birtherism, scalia was murdered, Biden is going to take your God and your guns away, etc.

Yes, representation matters. Yes, I'm obviously voting for Biden-Harris. But goddamn the best they could do for us was Kamala Aunty? She reminds me of people in my family I go out of my way to avoid at gatherings. I would call her Kamala in front of the whole fam. #NotMYAunty

Vote for Biden anyway, of course!
But if school reopening goes badly his numbers could easily go off a cliff, and that combined with a potential anti-Biden wave in 2022 could make him quite vulnerable.
That’s ridiculous—Biden loves to take questions. Usually can’t get him out of the room.  Didn’t take questions the other day because it was a formal announcement speech.
Campaign in need of cash? You’re a stooge. Check the FEC records you lying has been. Biden is FLUSH w cash. Trump is so down in polls he’s running ads on Fox! Call the wifey home. She’s gone in 83 days.
Individual 1 should go back and checked what Biden said in JANUARY, while he was having his cult gatherings.
Somebody at the FBI definitely needs to interview her concerning this threat to Biden--what does she know and who does she think is going to harm him?
"Stop playing politics with the virus" is actually a good line. Completely disingenuous, hypocritical, and fraudulent, but actually the classic response to the DEVASTATING attack that Biden and Harris made on him yesterday. Don't "play politics" when I kill people--just mourn.
Biden calls for nationwide mask mandate
Trump has enough air time. I want to hear Biden, I just wish they would ask him some difficult questions.
I cannot think of a better reason to pop the bubbly 😊. #nat’lproseccoday #biden-harris
Joe Biden keeps thanking me for helping him get reelected. Because I donated to Black Lives Matter which I have now determined as a complete and utter fraud. Donations go to Biden’s reelection. Not poor Black people.
I think a Biden win is already mostly discounted.
Swell to have our state mocked on Colbert ;Sen. Kamala Harris Breaks New Ground As Joe Biden's Running Mate  via
Violent protesters always have hate in their eyes, on both sides. Racism is inexcusable on either side.  Good people get caught up in bad situations .  Mr Biden, tell your tweet writers, that things are not always just black and white.

Wall Street was fearful of a Biden/Warren ticket.
The communist party is very much alive and well. They are thoroughly entrenched in the USA and their goal has been and continues to be the complete dismantling and destruction of the country. Vote Biden to help them.
Nah.  It’s a system that’s been around far longer than DeBlasio. He was just anointed as a candidate.  Used to be called Tammany Hall.
I agree Bill. It’s painful, but I think Biden has to go through the gauntlet and do it. Otherwise he just looks too wimpy. He needs to endure the indignity of it. And I think his presidential-ness will blow Trump’s coarseness and sophomoric-ness away.
Does anyone ever notice that Biden is in much better physical shape than Trump?  Trumps body... certainly ain’t no temple!
#Biden and the   has shown their true colors.  Holding out hope that they'll give Yang a #cabinet position is an exercise in futility.  I'll support local Dems.. I cannot support Biden/Kammy.
If you're going to donate $$$ #donate it to local candidates that you #believe in.    They'll need the money a ton more than Biden/Kammy will.
I’m pretty sure it’s not in Biden’s job description to marry people! He was making a political, pandering statement. And you bought it.the baker doesn’t have to make the cake, but govnmt clerks must follow the law. If against their conscience they need a new job.
You still have not explained why you think Biden would have done a better job, considering he said publicly he wouldn’t have shut down travel from China or Europe .
This person hasn’t said one thing that Biden would have done to manage this differently. Maybe because he publicly said he would have kept allowing travel from everywhere and hundreds of thousands more people would have died
So Biden would have shut Europe down but not China? Not sure where you are going with this. Explain what Joe would have done better
Did you agree with Biden when he said Trump was xenophobic for shutting down China travel ? Explain how Biden would have done a better job.
Biden, Harris lash Trump in introduction of historic VP pick
I think ideological purity is a bad thing to demand in a candidate. I also think there were better options than Biden. But this is where we’re at. I’m doing what’s right, rather than making a statement over how I wished things were.
Dr. Gary Rose, a political expert, told News 12 that Sen. Kamala Harris – the first Black female to run on a major party's presidential ticket – is exactly what Joe Biden needs.
Were you with Biden when he said he would not shut down travel from China or.. ? What has he mismanaged exactly?
Biden and Harris are so wrong about everything and stating nonsense. Only uniformed ignorant people would believe or back them. Unbelievable!!
Listen, I finally looked at your page, and being gay seems to define you. You know you twisted my words. To be a practicing Catholic, you must practice the faith. Biden doesnt. Do I think Aborigines who never heard of Jesus need to be Catholic to go to heaven? Of course not.
❤️🙏❤️🙏❤️  Joe Biden and Kamala Harris introduce their presidential ticket in Delaware
Based on the reaction from the left (yes, she is left), 90 % of them want Biden to drop out.
Totally different as Being Jewish is not considered a grave sin in the teachings of the Catholic faith. Why do you have a problem with this? You cannot promote abortion, homosexuality and say you are a good Catholic. Biden is free to find a religion that meets his beliefs.
Already planting the seed for Biden to step down. Embarrassing.
So are we going to bounce between “Harris being a radical leftist who is pulling the strings on Biden” to “Harris isn’t really Black so that community shouldn’t be excited” until election day?
Good grief.  Same guy who last week was blaming Biden for crime bill. Needs to figure out what he’s talking about.
Notice how we only hear “I’m voting against trump” but it’s never “I’m voting for Biden”  Yeah the DNC fucked up. The people wanted Bernie. He had a god damn movement. And if they had listened in 2016 then we wouldn’t be in this hot mess. But y’all ain’t ready to hear it
I think the hypocrisy is Biden claiming,every opportunity he gets, that he is Catholic. This pic is like showing a  self proclaimed vegan eating a steak. You don’t have to agree with Catholicism to see his insincerity.
O, I was in a porno with Joe Biden screaming O
Help put the Clintons back into power. Vote Biden 2020.
It's got nothing to do with skin color ... That's what the LEFT focuses on.  On the RIGHT, we focus on policy ... Biden has an ever changing one and Kamala has NO policy.  DEMs are screwed ... Trump will beat Biden by even more than he beat Hillary!! 😃

Trump and Biden on the debate stage is gonna be a battle of who has the most cognitive ability but Kamala and Pence, ohhh man it’s gonna be great seeing her tear his ass apart
Certainly skipping phase 3 human trials helped push them to the front...(Why didn’t we think of that??)
And Kamala Harris is a moderate. In my view this was the soundest pick Biden could have made, balancing everything out. One indication of a sound mind is a sound decision like this.  Much better VP choice than the last woman VP candidate, Sarah Palin, picked by McCain.
Biden is sick . Uh huh, Just like Hillary was so sick last time, right? That was BS about Hilary and this is BS about Joe now. Better to stick with the facts when you make a point.
And when President Biden honors Madam Vice President and Madam Speaker from the rostrum of the Capitol...wow!
Joe Biden’s choice of Kamala Harris as made her the third woman to run as a VP candidate on a major US presidential party ticket. As well as the first female African American and first person of Indian descent.
You know.. if  had #LetYangSpeak at the convention I still would have been miffed about the #Kamela pick for VP, but I would still have grudgingly voted #Biden.    I'm instead going to #protest the DNC shenanigans by not voting for #Biden.
I'm a Vote Blue No Matter Who guy, but that doesn't mean I'm not also dancing in celebration over a Biden/Harris ticket. This election can't come soon enough!
Trump, Pence, Biden, etc have spent their entire careers doing the same 🤷🏽‍♂️
Biden/Harris - grateful for this ticket!!!
It was kind of obvious that Joe Biden has a good relationship with Kamala Harris - which he said was important because of his friendship with President Obama during their terms. She was clearly going to be the choice. :)  I like it!
It will go a long way to helping me reconsider my #protest decision and decision of others to NOT VOTE #BIDEN.

Biden wasn't my 1st,2nd or 5th choice....but I'm voting for him for sure. I like Warren ,&amp; I'm sure there is a spot for her in his administration.  Ideally,I'd love Harris or Rice as his pick.
OMG! My husband uses thta phrase all the time!  And, I’d wait in line for days, in the cold and rain, to vote for Biden!
I meant Gov Lamont. Malloy was done in 2019. oops

Are you talking about Biden or Trump? If it’s Biden, okay, not ideal. But again Trump is literally about 10X worse in terms of sexual predation and corruption. Not in the same ballpark!
Its not ideal. But youve cherry picked the worst. If you cherry pick the worst of your father, it would be equally bad. But the bigger picture is Biden is much more qualified than your father - in knowledge, experience, ability to hire and listen to talent, and character.
Biden with certainty will usher in less chaos than what we’ve had under DJT.
Probably for the best.. the VP position doesn't have much power other than maybe the chance of becoming president if Biden steps down. Name recognition gets a boost but Yang probably will be more effective in a cabinet position.
What IF #Biden forgets about choosing a woman and ends up choosing #AndrewYang?    Are we in taht timeline? 🤔

Biden should definitely debate Trump! I believe it could be major eye opener for those who are, for whatever reason 🤯 , still undecided. I truly believe Biden would humiliate Trump in any debate as Trump is in way over his head on so many issues. #VoteBidenHarris2020
First of all it is CASES, with an s. Second no I wouldn’t expect him to comment but to at least cooperate since he says he is innocent. If he is the facts will show he is innocent. Biden was willing to cooperate
I would be certainly outraged. We have that in common. But the record is 1 accuser to 20 something. There is a pattern. Biden’s accuser was proven to have lied multiple time about the incident, none of Trumps has.
The fact that u wont waste your years in office tweeting out dangerous opinions &amp; conspiracy theories to fit your own agenda, instead of governing is a huge plus in my book! Biden has just 5407 tweets verses Trump currently at 54.4 tweets &amp; the day is young😳 #VoteBidenHarris2020

I’ve listened closely to Biden and he’s done nothing to convince me that he’s remotely interested in shifting towards progressives. Honestly, what would be more likely to convince me would be an honest accounting from his supporters.

On Nov 4, should Biden lose, Dems will blame people who stayed home, or voted 3rd party. That’s what they did in 2004 and of course 2016.  They feel like they’re owed votes for not being the other guy. People in the streets from big cities to small towns see through it.
In 2020 we have the benefit of seeing Biden’s atrocious record on the environment, war &amp; militarism, policing, housing, immigration, etc.  So we aren’t excited about “shoot them in the leg” vs “shoot them in the chest.”
According to data the number one reason people are voting for biden is because he isn’t trump. The number one reason voters are voting for trump is cus of policy. This ...... is not good. Biden can win.... but why take that risk with such a demented candidate lmaoo kill me please
If you couple this with the facts that it’s 1. Hard to beat an incumbent president and 2. Voter suppression and the electoral college benefit republicans more..... I smell a repetition of history. Although the data shows Biden in the lead now, if the gap keeps closing... bye bye
Hmmm now I’m less optimistic about Biden’s chances. He still might have the advantage but trump is already closing in the polls BEFORE Biden has even been under the microscope and while trump had fucked up corona response. That’s truly scary lmaoo also let’s look at history
This is cool but it mostly brings home to me how freaking old Biden is. He was writing letters to Hannah Arendt as a US Senator and a member of the Foreign Relations Committee in 1975!

theres dozens of messages being sent  by not voting for biden, and while its important to understand the validity and significance behind all of them, the loudest and by far the most impactful message is that you don't mind another 4 years of trump
Once again a vote for Biden is a vote for this evil woman to be are president
Biden doesn’t even remember who the Democrats picked for him I’m sorry I feel bad for the man he’s sick and nobody cares
If you don’t vote for Biden, Trump gets back in. Apparently your not crazy about Trump anymore either
ABC if Full of Shit. Joe Biden will not win the Presidency in November 2020. He is too forget full about even his own words half the time. He even forgets when he is reading from a Teleprompter if he takes his eyes 👀 off it for a few seconds! How in the Hell is he going to Run!
He have no platform. I checked his website. Look at Joe Biden website. You will see his platform.
a recent post of mine relating to dementia comments
PENCE: The selection of California liberal Senator Kamala Harris as Joe Biden&amp;#039;s running mate simply confirms everything President Trump and I have been saying about Joe Biden and the Democratic Party.
lets not forget that joe biden headed the war on drugs and had is foot in mass incarceration. a minority VP won’t get my vote
23. The Democrats must hold on the line on USPS funding for health reasons as well as for political reasons. If they cave, they’ll kneecap Joe Biden.
Obama, Trump, Biden, Bernie - the president of the United States will always lead the imperial death machine. voting will never reduce the harm done to the people of the global south.
She spoke in absolutes and called the pandemic preventable.  When he closed travel in Feb Biden said he was xenophobic.  We are a country larger than France, the UK,  Italy and Spain put together.  Of course, we have larger numbers of death and infection than others.
Of course not!! They just want to control us!! DON’T let them at all!Dr. Siegel tells Tucker Carlson there is 'no science' behind Biden's mask mandate

Stick to your bumper sticker politics. Full your head with QAnon and Alex Jones conspiracy. Get your fill of bubble gum reporting through OANN. Leave the important stuff to the adults. Criticize Biden or Harris’s past and support Trump. Brilliant.
Kamala Harris is already helping Biden’s campaign with key voting groups: key poll
After that, by the time of done ✅ doing that, I’ll be voting 🗳 for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. That’s it.
Let me be honest about this. I may not Elect Joe Biden and his Vice President, but I will help them to defeat President Donald Trump to get him out the White House, 🏡 that’s gonna be on November 3rd.
Like I said, we all need to prepare for a permanent pandemic. Resistance to Biden is going to be resistance to masks and vaccines.
Biden has probably been on both sides of the debate!at some point.
I’ll bet you on this part: Between Joe Biden and his Vice President, I know that they have my vote! 🗳 Just saying that.
Whoever is saying that what I saw on my internet about my President Joe Biden May not be president, that’s a lie, but I’m still gonna vote 🗳 for him and his Vice President as well when Election 🗳 Day gets here in November.

It's so hard to tar and feather #BidenHarris as "radical Left" Bolsheviks bent on seizing your suburban ranch house, abolishing the police, because for 4 years radical Leftists have been screaming "BIDEN DUZNT SUPPORT SOCIALISM", "KAMALA IZ A COP".   Swing voters heard that.

Biden Campaign Slams Trump for "Sabotaging" Postal Service
Progressive purity politics: “Trump and Biden are the same, because Trump probably won’t succeed in getting rid of the ACA. Oh and also the ACA is bad anyway, even though people would be dead without it.”
I don't have hard data but anecdotally the ratio of men to women accused must be astronomical. It just seemed like such a odd case for the NYT to take stand against Title IX with. But my prediction now is that when Biden gets in they'll implement a sort of Title IX+. They'll
That’s true, but republicans have never respected the rules ever—any precedent set by democrats would be violated as a matter of course by them.  It’s not even clear slowing down the mail will help trump.  He needs every vote and some of Biden’s to win—he needs the mail to work.
One of those two tickets will be president. And even if you were maximally right and Biden did *literally nothing* to the status quo, you would have to think that that would be equally bad as getting rid of the ACA, which Trump would do, if you want to say that they’re “equal.”
You think that Biden, whose running mate explicitly supports M4A, is *literally* no less likely to spend his term trying to demolish the ACA than Trump?
“Biden knows that in building a strong team, it’s imperative to surround yourself with people who aren’t afraid to tell you exactly what they think — especially when they think you’re wrong.  Harris has the guts to do that for Biden, just as Biden.”  Yeah, sure, that happened. 🙄

Biden??  Who can’t put two sentences together and is as corrupt as it gets?  That’s your answer????  Boy if you think things are bad now, just wait till the communism comes under the guise of socialism.
21. In the hours since Biden’s tapped Kamala Harris as his running mate, the president had waded farther into the slough of sadism. The farther he goes, according to critics, the stronger Biden gets. Well, maybe, depending on the size of November’s electorate.
10. They’d rather think the way Nate Silver and his team thinks—Trump has this or that much chance of losing, Biden has this or that much chance of winning, giving the impression that the country is this close to returning to normal.
1.  team of data journalists released its highly anticipated survey this week showing the president has a 29 percent chance of getting reelected while Joe Biden has a 71 percent chance of defeating him. This kind of punditry should give you heartburn.

I'm guessing responses will be:  - "He's being sarcastic." - "It was going to fail anyway." - "Universal mail-in voting is worth sabotaging the post office." - "It's Obama's fault." - "Biden smelled women's hair so it's okay." - "You made that fake news clip with Photoshop."

What Reed has going for him is that Biden has known him for years. They served together in the Senate from 1997 through 2008.   McCaskill and Biden served together briefly, from 2007 through 2008.   Duckworth, like Kamala Harris, are both members of the Class of 2016.
Duckworth would make the most sense, given how she was almost chosen to be Biden's running mate.   Duckworth and Reed would both make sense, as Senators from safe blue states with Democratic governors.   Claire McCaskill holds no office, but seems to want to get back in the ring.

Biden and Harris must win this election. But if they run another Wall Street Big Tech crony show, the next wanna be fascist will be the real thing. If the left doesn’t get to do liberation, the right is poised to do it for them.
Amazing that Biden and Harris could put aside their differences and unite to run. Maybe you could learn a thing or 2 or a million from that. THAT is what makes America great. Not your product based Maga B.S.

26. While Biden and Harris are expanding the electorate, the president and his allies are chasing after a base of power that’s getting smaller.
23. They are not attacking Harris so much as trying to bring back white voters who don’t want to vote for a racist (because they don’t think of themselves as racists) but will if Trump can show Biden and Harris are as bad or worse than he is.
21. By choosing her, and promising that she’ll govern as his equal, Biden is signalling to that part of the electorate that has never been represented that the time is coming—if and *only if* you do everything in your power to get everyone you know to go vote for me and Kamala.
19. Harris isn’t just “the perfect antidote to Trump’s anti-immigrant, anti-Black, xenophobic attitudes,” as USA Today’s Jill Lawrence and David Mastio wrote this morning.
17. Harris is a “do no harm” choice for white voters already set to vote for Biden. But a biracial daughter of immigrants who self-identifies as Black is more than “safe” for nonwhite voters like Baraki Sellers’ mom.
16. "But what you want my mama to do is, you want my mama to be on the phones, out in her community getting people to the polls, engaging her sorority. You want them to be active participants, and that’s what Kamala brings.”
15. Listen to how  put it to the San Francisco Chronicle before Biden’s announcement: “It’s not about getting those super-voters to the polls—those super-voters, they’re going to go the polls,” the author of My Vanishing Country said.

7. She may not seem the most comfortable fit as a governing partner, a quality Biden said he was seeking, but Harris was viewed as the safest pick to win in November.”
6.  Barack Obama’s advisor wrote today: “In the end, Biden seriously considered others but returned to Harris as the ‘do no harm’ candidate, unlikely to thrill or outrage many.
4. Consider, then, who Harris appeals to. It’s not voters who are already anti-Trump. As long as Biden didn’t pick Tulsi Gabbard or Marianne Williamson, they were going to support the Democratic nominee no matter who he picked.
2. Many people who are going to vote for Biden aren’t really voting *for* him. They are voting *against* the president, which means Biden is a secondary thought,
1. Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris as his running mate. The first thing we should say is that running mates almost never matter. They have very little effect on voter behavior, because voters usually just don’t care. Indeed, in the age of Donald Trump, they might care even less.

Kamala’s track record with prison sentences is terrible as well... she’s the opposite of police and prison reform tbh. But as you say I’m still taking her and Biden over trump/pence in a heartbeat.

I agree she may not be a good politician. Just hard to see that she would be the minority they cap for to potentially takeover in a unlikely scenario where Biden doesn't complete his term.  But 🤷🏽‍♂️ I still hate this idea that he picked a minority to help propel them to the office.
Wow have you been living under a rock??? Biden has serious cognitive decline everybody knows it and sees it, the Democrats only endorsed Biden because they can control ever aspect of him they know he can’t run this country on his own

There are some people on here who unfollowed me because I won't be kissing Biden and Harris asses. It's a Donald J. Trump move, but I accept it. It just prove my point that there's no difference between them and Trump supporters.
I’m supporting Joe Biden for president because he’ll be a steadfast advocate for our nation’s public school students and educators.   Will you pledge to support Joe, too?
Biden is a Catholic, you are not. Let's see what Pope Francis says.... I will give him a call.....
So what I saw yesterday is that Biden has a very Big Basement. Don't you know the old saying "Starting from the Ground Level leads to Success" But seriously that is one Huge, Big Basement he &amp; Kamala were in yesterday. Huge or as Trump would say "Bigly, Beautiful Basement"
Before Obama-Biden, I don’t think either W. Bush or Cheney were Catholic and I don’t think either Bill Clinton or Gore were either.
Biden is ashamed of himself...lots of Democrats didnt vote in my small community because although they are die hard democrats they refuse to switch for the GREATEST PRESIDENT IN HISTORY but thats fine the PATRIOTS are true to our PRESIDENT! #TRUMP2020 WWG1WGA QQQQ
OMG, I am so nervous about November. Biden/Harris HAVE TO WIN. I cannot survive one second of a 2nd term of who we have now as they are pure evil.
Thread - but especially this. I want Biden to win because fuck the cheetoh toddler in the wh. That is *not* a reason to silence minoritized ppl w/ legit complaints.
I believe Joe Biden is a Catholic. Shame on you! No wonder people are leaving the Catholic Church!
Joe Biden Taps Kamala Harris For VP
It's a shame that the Biden campaign is missing the historical importance of Andrew Yang. I'm NOT surprised at the stupidity of it all.
She did a great job represent in CaliforniaThat was a party pic not Joe Biden
has lawmakers' reactions to Biden's pick for running mate on GMCT.
This is going to be hilarious because Biden was bullied by Black folks demanding a Black woman VP and he chooses Blue Lives Matter Kamala Harris. When this blows up in Biden’s face and he loses bc of it what will the Dems do next.. 🤔🤔
If Biden doesn’t get elected we're basically electing Donald Trump for president.
i'm going to say this at least once a week until november.   even if you don't want to vote for biden, request a ballot/show up to the polls. there are OTHER PEOPLE on the ballot, completely unrelated to potus.   don't be irresponsible.Will do. Have a great night.
Every day on this side of the dirt, is a good day.
Hey Claudia. Erin made us pizza, from scratch, tonight. Wifey is working, so the 2 of us are partying, like 10 year olds.
Thanks for the tag, brother. I hope your weekend is relaxing. Be well and stay safe.
Biden at least wants to tax the wealth unlike Trump
We have to push someone who is already making concessions to the left, Biden. I’m gonna bully him to do so many progressive policies
Newt says Harris is an anti Catholic bigot. He is right. It proves that Biden did not pick her. His handlers did.
I’m enthusiastic to not worry ab Trump so I can bully Biden
This is so much BS , Obama has totally endorsed BIDEN , more LIES and counting !
“Biden also lost two presidential campaigns” yikes
I mean, out of all of the candidates that ran to be the Democrat nominee... they gave it to Biden. He didn't win it... viable candidates just stepped aside so the party could hand it to him. If the party doesn't care, why should the people?
The Daily News. A left wing rag. She is a Green New Deal, pro illegal Alien, anti 2nd Ammendment, Biden bashing fraud.
Seems  wants credit for the peace deal after all.
Yeah true, but Biden’s Biden
Oh, but Mr Biden don’t forget.... get ready for this: it’s “an absentee ballot”! LOL He’s such a dunce.
Vote Biden,Harris in November let's put America back on track  for all not just for the 1% the working class needs to be built back up,we are the ones that make our country stand out this presidency has made us a laugh stock around the world
Keeping my fingers crossed for a Biden /Harris win in November , supporting from Canada 🇨🇦
Trump v. Biden v. Nickelback? Pick one
I don’t know, if you’re talking about Kamala she’s not my choice personally. Biden wrote the crime bill and she locked up a lot of truant mothers and drug users.
We came pretty close with Bernie twice. We’re stuck with Biden but we’ve come pretty far as a country in that respect.
I don’t necessarily disagree with that. Biden is way too old to run for reelection in 2024 potentially. It’s probably gonna be Harris vs AOC
Maybe. But I feel like Biden is not actively harmful to our civic institutions like Trump is, even though they’re not in their right minds.
That’s why Biden wants to undo trumps tax cuts for the rich. Historically Democrats are much better with the deficit than Republicans are.
I think Biden wants to raise corporate taxes and the top marginal rate to some extent.
If you don't vote for Biden, you ain't black
Hey your boy Biden is the corrupt one. Not Trump. There were numerous contacts between Burisma and the Obama State Department. Lies galore during the impeachment trial
Biden was warning about #COVID19 in January when Trump was saying we had 15 cases that would go down to zero!  Now we have over 5 million cases &amp; 168,000+ dead with no national testing strategy!  #TrumpDeathToll169k #GOPGenocide  #TrumpIsACompleteFailure  #TrumpVirusCatastrophe
We desperately need a president we can trust!  Joe Biden is that man. Joe understands our issues because he’s lived them. He earned everything he’s achieved honestly  #VoteBiden to return trust to the White House  #wtp2020   #wtp432
The democrats were behind the Russia hoax, phony impeachment, the public lynching of Kavanaugh led by the nasty and mean Biden bashing Harris, and supporting a corrupt and despicable Clinton. Real fair.
Please I know I didn’t follow this thread from jump, but we have to believe there is a new tomorrow w the Biden/Harris ticket. Look at the people on their teams on their websites they have strong roots yes she was a atty 4 da po ,but fair in life ruining bs petty crimes dismissal
Okay -- except I was specifically reacting to umpteen zillion tweets, many tagging the FBI, that said PIRRO IS THREATENING BIDEN!!1! I'm perfectly fine with saying that Pirro is a doofus conspiracy theorist who operates in bad faith.
I’m just over 600. Slowed down a lot and am very happy with the progress. If anyone else wants to follow I follow back. You’ll be entertained at least once. That more than we can say for Biden or Trump at the moment
A fair point. But easily enough refuted by, well, Biden remaining on the ticket. Far zanier and more dangerous conspiracy theories are on their way.
What is it you're not sure I believe? I don't think Pirro threatened Biden in any way. And I think that Pirro says insane things all the time, so a random conjecture from her that Biden might not be on the ticket doesn't move the needle for me.
You have used racist &amp; sexist tropes against  all week. Words like "angry mean, phoney &amp; nasty" are just energizing all of us "nasty women" to work hard to get  Biden/Harris elected!!  She is already polling ahead of you!! 👍 #MisogynistTrump #NastyWomenVote
Mr Biden,  love ya, and Kamala too  . Yesterday, I noticed that when you removed your mask that you touched your face. Please I know it’s difficult but you have to get out of the habit we can’t lose you guys please b careful
I suspect she is saying (without evidence, natch) that Biden's health will be an issue between now and November. On the Pirro Controversy Scale, that hardly even rates a mention, much less a Twitter riot.
Oh, boy, crazyloonperson Jeaninne Pirro is trending, let's see what the story is.  People are saying she *threatened* Joe Biden?? Holy crap.  {watches clip}  Uh, guys. That's not remotely a threat.
#ChameleonKamala, she can become whatever she needs to become to get ahead. As of late...Biden's best bud and VP.
Translation: Gavin doesn't think that Biden will win.
That's the photo that Biden's campaign sent out. It isn't doctored. He's holding the phone upside-down.
My dream is to see a landslide for Joe Biden, all states, especially to that POS  who arrested the indigenous people native to that region (Who’s property it technically is) while peacefully protesting on July 4th! Put that on Mt Rushmore!
Let Trump attack Biden. Have Pence counter Harris’ vicious attacks with the FACTS!! #FakeKamela #KeepAmericaGreat
I will be thrilled to work, donate &amp; vote to get the Biden/Harris team &amp; Democrats elected!  #VoteBidenHarrisToSaveAmerica  #BlueWave2020 #FlipTheSenateBlue  #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare  #BattleForTheSoulOfAmerica
Watching the Biden Harris speech was so moving!! Woman in this country can be very proud right now!! Making our own decisions, family values , was so strong !! I’m so excited to be Democrat right now
Absolutely! Yesterday he asked a guest if there would be "hard feelings" with the other candidates about not being chose as Biden's VP!  No one would EVER ask that about male candidates! He has to go!!  #ReplaceChuckTodd #NicolleWallaceforMTP
Glad to hear your powerful voices for the Biden/Harris ticket!! #BidenHarris2020  #WomenForBidenHarris #BlueWave2020  #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #VoteBidenToUniteAmerica
is very smart, capable, tough &amp; more than qualified for VP! It's  pathetic that all we have heard from Republicans is that she's part of the far left!  I'm a Catholic mother &amp; grandmother who supports the Biden/Harris ticket so I must be far left too!! 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️
Yea there is. It’s all calculated risk. It’s pretty clear from the VP pick that Biden isn’t counting on the lefts vote. He must think he has enough moderate righty’s to cover
Biden and Harris have written off the left. They aren’t planning on getting the vote and they dont care. They are trying to win with center right voters. So be it. It’s a bold strategy cotton. Let’s see if it pays off.
I am soooo excited to vote for the Biden/Harris ticket in November!! 💙💙💙 #BidenHarris2020Landslide  #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica  #VoteBidenToUniteAmerica #BlueWave2020 #WomenForBidenHarris #WomensVote100
My name is Joe Biden and I did not write this message.
Incapable of coherent thought, as opposed to....Joe Biden? 😂
Love it! They are both discerning and cautionary, but good , strong personalities! She was a very good, very fair AG, and Senator, and who cannot love Joe Biden and his legacy? Very pleased overall!
I truly do not understand these takes. Why are we using this as an opportunity to tear down other women?  Why not given Warren credit for pulling Biden further left?
Great choice Mr Biden! The perfect “yang” to your “ying”! You have my vote 👍

Guess what tRump, we DON’T GIVE A RAT’S ASS what you think about Kamala Harris!  Joe BIden and Kamala Harris are going to win on November 3, 2020
I couldn't have said it better! Hopefully both of you will be an integral part of the Biden administration!! #BidenForPresident  #BlueWave2020 #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica  #StrongerTogether #DemocratsWin
What has this president done bad to YOU? I am not a bot. I live in shit hole NY! So please list what Biden has done  in how many years in office? 🤔go ahead  I am waiting...
A little different this time when Biden is senile and likely to step down after a few months. The VP needs to be qualified and Harris is not. She was the first person out of the Democratic primaries. How on earth is she a good pick overall?
Maybe if you are talking about Kamala the Ugandan Giant from the WWE. But if you are talking about Kamala Harris, she’s not even close to being qualified for President, which she will be if Biden wins, bc he will be unfit for office and step down within months.
Here we go!! Painting Joe Biden/Kamala Harris as radical left would be funny if it wasn't so pathetic!! This is a historic day! The Biden admin.will be one of the most diverse EVER when we currently have a white nationalist in the White House! #RacistTrumpMustGo  #BidenHarris2020

Joe Biden has picked Sen. Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate.  via
Watching Kamala Harris totally gut Biden in the first debate with the "I was that little girl" sound byte last summer, I was convinced that there was no chance for these two to coexist. Politics makes the strangest of bedfellows. Maybe Biden forgot?  #BidenVP
Sooo now we have a Pedophile running for President and a Slut for his VP!  Wow. And they had so much to say about Trump. #biden #kamalaharris
Let Biden try it first. Followed by Pelosi, Schiff, and Comey.
This letter is basically threatening journalists that any critical coverage of Biden's VP pick will be attacked as racist or misogyny. Any journalist who kowtows to the demands in this letter should find another profession, because they'll no longer be journalists.
is awesome &amp; I look forward to a Biden administration that will be as wonderfully diverse as our country is!!  #BidenPledgesAllegianceToUS  #DiversityIsOurStrength #VoteBidenToUniteAmerica #BlueWave2020
Should get Comey, too. And Hillary, Obama, Biden, and Rice. Not to mention Wray, Clapper, and Brennan.
Eat shit Biden’s twitter writers. A day late and a dollar short. Fauci is Mr. Wrong and a Hillary loving democrat operative.
Biden escaping a nursing home
I have not decided yet. I def won’t vote for Trump. Biden will wait as long as possible before supporting a policy and a cabinet position that I feel is important to progressive politics. If he does then he has my vote.
That's exactly what they want to do! They want to come in &amp; take our firearms but it would have to be over my dead body! People better buy all the ammo you can...now!! All I can say is God forbid Biden wins SOMEHOW, it would sadly be DEATH TO AMERICA! Pray for OUR COUNTRY! 🙏🇺🇸♥️
Corrupt lying Biden!
At least he can read. Biden can’t read off a teleprompter. The Lincoln Project sucks.
The debates, man. Once they air, it’s over for Biden
Biden is, and always has been, a moderate.  Don't believe the stories trying to paint him as some kind of radical.  Is it likely that you will disagree with some of his policies?  Yes, most certainly.  But he will always be a person of high moral character, and won't embarrass us
touche touche. definitely an idiot in some respects, i just see trump as an intentional racist and biden as gaffe-prone ( i acknowledge my liberal bias in this viewpoint)
if you see biden as a racist, but not trump, then i have nothing more to say to you, god speed and go dawgs
literally is, i guess we have different understandings of what racism is, and we probably wont see eye to eye...all i know is nazis and white supremacist groups fly the flag of one candidate and it isnt biden (miss me with your impending antifa reply)
It'll be open house for your illegal's. That's what you really love about a Biden Presidency. Right ? Turn the USA into Nicaragua and shit.
If you can stand in line at Home Depot and Walmart then you can stand in line to vote. Biden needs the fraudulent mail in ballot to win. He is scum!!!
His VP pick will not change my mind at all. I will vote for Biden/Any creature alive or dead.  But I want to see the VP candidate start campaigning! 💜
"If you don't vote by mail, THEN YOU AIN'T BLACK"  - Joe Biden
Joe Biden does.
Biden is a moron. Time to have him step aside for a decent candidate.
Just leave them alone, believe me I’ve tried and lost friends over! They are not going to realize till after he is all one big lie, which we are not gonna be able to expose until we get Biden in office. Thankfully he lost his other support that put him over the edge swing states
Good, let the Republicans bring up Benghazi rather than attack Biden.  I doubt there is anyone changing their vote based on a six year old non-scandal.
Trump is a bad person. Biden is a decent person. Their church attendance or non-attendance on any given Sunday does not alter this in the least.
It’s also hypocritical because reports are saying China is trying to interfere for Biden. And by reports I mean  which is pretty much rock solid.
Please watch his last twenty “appearances” on tv. Orange man bad but Biden ain’t it. And Harris, Bass, and the lying Susan Rice ain’t it either. MAGA 2020. Orang man good.
i don’t really know. i see so many people say “biden 2020” and it’s just like isnt he worse.
Yeah I support Biden, but at this point I’d back any candidate who shows any interest in ending the pandemic
people only pick biden becasue that’s the only option.
Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said that while he won’t tear down President Trump’s much-touted wall along the United States’ southern border with Mexico, he also won’t continue construction of the barrier if he’s elected president in November.
We’re is black lives matter now! They should add to the reward. But they spend million for Biden’s campaign. Scumbags
Good luck. I saw my doc and was given anti anxiety meds. They really helped. I haven’t needed an emergency pill, in months. Once my head wasn’t “everywhere”, it was easier to engage. Sending my best, brother. There’s no shame in seeking some help.
I would love to see his reaction to Joe Biden telling him he ain’t black if he doesn’t vote for Joe.
The Dem Politicians don't care because to them this IS normal! THIS IS DISGUSTING AND  BIDEN IS A PIG! Look how uncombfortable cease young children are with him! #VoteNoToPedoJoe #Trump2020 🇺🇸
I was in that rut! I wish I had some sage wisdom, to offer. I just engrossed myself in a few projects, at the house. They’ve spawned other projects, and so on.
Thanks Bill. I finally checked in. Hope your Friday was great.
Nothing is going to help Biden. But let #Jack keep playing his game.
, what the hell do you mean "afraid" ? I'm not "afraid", and I've never been polled ! Dont try and make excuses because Biden is leading in some polls. It sounds desperate. I don't give a damn about those polls. #Trump2020Landslide.
It's NOT okay to sexually assault ANYONE EVER! TELL ME WHY ARE YOU ONLY FOCUSING ON TRUMP AND NOT BIDEN?
A vote for Biden is a vote for China. A vote for  is a vote for America. 🇺🇸
100% correct! Biden is in front of all these cameras touching all these children smelling their hair putting his hands all over their bodies in front of everyone so if he could do that imagine this shit he does behind closed doors!!

ALL THE POLLS ARE FAKE LIKE FAKE NEWS. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS THE TRUE LEADER . JOE BIDEN IS THE LEADER OF THE SHAMEFUL DEMOCRATS WHICH ARE HURTING THE CITIES REALLY BAD THE CHILDREN AND SENIORS. DEMOCRATS ARE KILLING BABIES.  PHILTHY DEMOCRATS. LAWLESSNESS.
So after Obomba interfered with the peimaries and stole Bernie from us NOW he has doubts about Biden.... Obomba is not our friend
Yes biden would have opened the borders in January from china.. How many would be dead then kasie kasum
Absolutely, Eve one knows Biden, his policies are public record , Trump needs the spotlight and keeps helping Biden the more and more he speaks.
Get ready to watch alot of Democrats who screamed that Trump was mentally unfit for the Presidency vote for Joe Biden, a 77 year old in early stages of dementia.
Hillary and Biden united as the worst candidates ever produced by the Democratic Party.  Bush and Trump the worse of the Republican Party.  While the Green Party produces candidates like Ralph Nader and Jill Stein and Howie Hawkins
Tell what Biden would have done differently?
Biden does NOT demonstrate the diminished capacity that we all see in  #ByeHannity is a master distractor so he paints #BunkerBoy behavior on  to keep us from seeing he’s actually describing Trump. NOT WORKING!
I graduated highschool in 1988. I went on to career for 21 years. Raised a family and started a few business. Even served as a local and state official. But this guy has been a forever political insider. Wondering how much ego it takes to be that guy?
I will vote in person on Nov. 3rd to make sure my vote for Biden/Harris is counted! If you can’t vote in person, request an absentee ballot early and place it in a ballot drop box
Biden says MANDATORY MASKS, KAMALA  says now theres a Leader! ARE you kidding me! The lead story should be TRUMPS PEACE AGREEMENT WITH ISREAL AND AEU! The media plays it down! THE PEOPLE KNOW BETTER! TRUMP IS A TRUE LEADER AND SHOULD GET THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE!

The count down is on in Ct. also.  Cannot take Trump another 81 days, let alone 4 years.  Please vote Biden-Harris
Finally something VP Pence and I agree on.  Vote for Putin's stooges Trump and Pence and kiss democracy goodbye or vote for Biden and Harris and turn this train wreck around.
To sufficiently fund the Postal Service would require more taxes than Joe Biden and Heels Up Harris could dream up, combined.  They'd have to drag Barry out of retirement to invent a few more.
I don’t care if he flunked kindergarten! I am voting for Biden/Harris!
reported the news probably did not make it to many mail in voters and even people that went to polls so leave the voters out of it.  Oh yeah, Harris believes Biden's accusers while calling him a racist.
It's an act of sabotage against the Biden admin. McConnell knows trump will lose and is trying hard to blow up the new administration before it even starts.
Biden has +40 years of evil under his belt
BIden said masks should be mandatory in all states for the next three months at least! No!! Then his VP SELECTION said "NOW THATS WHAT LEADERSHIP LOOKS LIKE" No , i say thats what fear mongering and taking away our freedom looks like! Yes wear masks in a public setting, thats it!
TRUMP HAS DONE A WONDERFUL JOB IN RESPONSE TO THE VIRUS,  WOULD HAVE LET MORE TRAVEL FROM CHINA ENTER OUR COUNTRY, TRUMP SHUT IT DOWN!! WE WOULD HAVE MORE DEATHS UNDER YOU! STOP TRYING TO DO WHAT TRUMP HAS ALREADY DONE AND CALL IT YOUR PLAN!
Like you would do any better during a global pandemic and worldwide depression? The only ideas you and Biden have revolve around pot, electric cars, gun confiscation and solar panels.  You would destroy the country in years if you could
biden is smarter than you will ever be
Thomas  If the socialist Communist Joe Biden presidency happens and the house and the senate God forbid goes to that social Communist party we as a country will be in major major trouble!!
I guess my tweet yesterday wasn’t the right way to put my feelings on VP Kamala Harris. I don’t like her at all, but I’m not stupid enough to not vote for Biden-Harris. Trump winning this election will give him an insane ego boost. I live in fear of seeing what happens after that
I was thinking about this the other day after watching Biden and Harris Chances are really good Joe's having that conversation with them I hope
Sure...but so many people believe this crap.  Biden needs to fight like he is 20 points down.
Watch Hannity tonight Bette. Biden/Harris bashing at its best. How’s nyc treating you?  When you moving. I heard that there is a mass exodus.
Just to be clear... Donald trump instituted a travel ban in January. But Joe Biden calling for masks in August is leadership??  I wonder if anyone knows what Joe was saying in January?? Huh,   Would someone at the times happen to have that info?... #crickets
I nominate him for Biden’s Press Secretary
Not a black voice in sight. Great first impression. At least they agree with Biden about the masks.
Absolutely!! Make it great gain and KEEP it that way! Basement boy Biden and his joke of a running mate aren’t up for that job. PLEASE make sure to win in November. It’s the only chance we have. Thanks President Trump. #MAGA #KAG

Why is FOX and the rest of the media starting every show with the BIDEN AND HARRIS TICKET instead of the biggest story of the day. TRUMP BROCKERED A PEACE DEAL BETWEEN ISREAL AND UAE! ITS EPIC AND THE MOST IMPORTANT STORY! They don't want to give TRUMP a win!! I guess we will!!
Biden needs to run like he’s down by 20 points and there are two weeks left !!!!
Headline: Biden and Harris dead in landslide
As talented as Woody Harrelson is and as good an actor as he is he could not capture the demented buffoonery of Biden
That’s why Biden picked her she’s the best fund raiser and he isn’t so basically he’ll be living off her fundraising lol....I had a boyfriend like that
Kamala is a danger to AMERICA! If the left wins through cheating and Biden steps down She will be our next President! She in inauthentic, a phony who will say and do anything to gain power! AMBITIOUS AND RUTHLESS!
Vote for Biden.
President Trump let VP Pence go after Joe Biden vp you concentrate on Joe Biden and whatever the VP that he picked speaks let her talk and she will put her big foot in her big mouth!!
Biden/ Harris are wolves in sheep’s clothing. They are coming for you. Hope you saved your pennies and have a good job. Cause they want you to share it with the world.
If I’m advising Biden, I have him stay in the basement and let 45 tweet and have those crazy afternoon press conferences every day.
Who is this Biden?  Supposedly in politics for 50 years. Why wasn’t he ever giving press conferences daily during the Great Depression while millions lost their jobs and homes. We all loved the money him and Obama gave us. I am still waiting for mine
Biden’s questionable words will be overshadowed continually as long as 45 has an active Twitter account.
You would’ve said this about anybody Biden picked as VP.  Not even an interesting take.
You know what was nasty. Listening to her and Biden just bashing trump and talking about a lot of nothing. Smoke and mirrors. Do nothing democrats. She is gonna make a fool of herself. Hahahahaha I’m gonna enjoy it though
Biden/Harris wolves in sheep’s clothing. They are coming for your house and wallet and job. They need them for the world to enjoy. Hahahahaha good luck. Is Bette staying in New York?  Cuomo needs your money.
I mean you went with the cheap headline instead of commenting on the substance of what Biden said. Why is that?
That’s been Biden’s campaign slogan since he first announced he was running.
Joe Biden basically asleep during Kamala's speech isnt good
You mean a Trump Rally.  Please compare the tone of the Biden/Harris presser and Trump’s presser.
I’m with you, no way Warren was a serious contender. She’s a great senator, but she wouldn’t help Biden with any of the groups he needs to vote for him if he’s going to win. If it came down to two people, then the other was probably Susan Rice.
I’m pretty convinced Biden picked Kamala Harris because he liked the smell of her shampoo.
So cool that a crowd of #BidenHarris2020 supporters have gathered outside of the Delaware High School that VP Biden &amp; Senator Harris are going to speak at. Not a rally of any kind But they showed up anyway!
How come why I type or search up  , Joe Biden's website pops up??? Go ahead, try it.
I find the level-setting game here fascinating.  Kamala Harris is a bold choice and Joe Biden is doing anything but running a safe campaign. The question is whether voters go with the team putting forward substantive policies that improve people's lives or the party stoking fear.
Someone with a Biden sticker on their profile yet hasn't read his platform.
After that, Biden gets accused of sexual assault, so he vows to choose a woman as his VP. And now, Sleepy Joe announces Phony Kamala as his running mate.  These two liberals are as far-left as they come. Between both of their terrible records, it's obvious that this radical
First, Kamala Harris attacked Joe Biden’s racist policies (did she forget?). Next, she ends her pathetic run at President. Then, 3 months after ending her own campaign, she reluctantly endorses Biden.
I got this one:  Just when we thought the idea of Joe Biden being President of the United States couldn't get any worse, he announces that Kamala Harris, a failed presidential candidate and a corrupt former California Attorney General, will be his running mate.
I’ve seen Biden in the last year and he’s not known where he is, can’t read two sentences off a teleprompter without stumbling, has not answered an unscripted question and is clearly in his dotage. If I were I’d be terrified of a debate too.
Harris believed Biden’s accuser
Considering Harris failed pretty spectacularly in the primaries, that doesn't seem like a great idea. A lot of people just don't like Harris and there's no reason to think she'd appeal to anyone who wasn't going to vote for Biden anyway.
With all due respect if youre arguing Tim Kaine was the Catholic in 2016 you do realize that Joe Biden was the Catholic in 2012 you idiot

Trump has a problem of not using a script ever and Biden has a problem of using one, ALWAYS.   We could use a happy middle.
Biden/Harris have no experience Biden has done nothing for 40 years and Harris is a diff person in every room she goes in.She is in wall st pocket.That desperate for votes I c.Wait the polls said Hillary was in the lead and what happened.. silent majority,keep the Kleenex handy
The  should already be firing out ads against #KamalaHarris, if they were playing it smart.   They could end the election in three different TV ads of Biden/Harris in less than a month if they play the cards right.
Joe Biden excluded approximately 98.1% of the eligible American public from being looked at for Vice President, soley because he was judging based on Sex &amp; Race.   #BidenHarris2020 #KamalaHarris
McCain/Palin, 2008, Romney/Ryan, 2012, Clinton/Kaine, 2016, .... Biden/Harris? 2020??  For some reason the woke pondering of a Male/Female ticket to the SJW doesn't seem to work in American elections.
She’s not qualified whatsoever and she said she thought that Biden sexually assaulted women in the past yet she agrees to b his running make. What a joke.&amp; she said Jessee smollet was 1 of the nicest person she ever met.Still on her Twitter page. Never retracted #FakeNews loser
We've seen non-stop elder abuse. I've never been a Biden fan, but he shouldn't be allowed to do this, even for the sake of power.
As long as the person is 35 the day they take the oath of office they are fine. On that basis, AOC will be old enough. But, I doubt there will be serious primary challenge to Biden, if he runs again, or Harris, assuming she wants the top spot.
: Kamala will not weirdly mirror Biden’s actions at the table.
100% of Rudy Giulianis will go to jail in a Biden Presidency.
Why are all these celebrities in love with Biden? Just bc he's not Trump????
Donald Trump, Joe Biden declared winners in Connecticut in final presidential primaries of year
Notice how she didn't say Biden?  She knows he's incapable.
My money is still on Biden winning on November.  But, all of the neoliberal Democrats will be very confused and surprised when the BLM protests only escalate in January.
Bibi knows how to work them too. And how to use them to keep pressure on Trump. Trump can’t win without them so expect more “Joe Biden will hurt the Bible” theatre in the months to come
It's true Joe didn't pick her. The Federalist had a story stating they gave Biden a script for his phone to Harris offering her the running mate position. Can you believe he had to be given a script?
She believes Joe Biden’s accusers.
I liked when she believed Joe Biden’s accusers and told her little girl being bussed story making Biden look like the segregationist he is
Biden bows out of a second term and Harris picks AOC as her running mate.
Although I didn’t care WHO Biden picked for VP, I LOVE KAMALA and I’m so effin PUMPED!!!!❤️
Because she believes Joe Biden’s accusers
Biden. Harris. Biden.  Harris. Biden. Harris. Biden. Harris   Biden. Harris.  Biden. Harris.                  Yeah.    Yeah.   Yeah.   Yeah.
Does Biden even know he picked her. Lol
Twitter is on fire about now !!!!  Can’t retweet fast enough !  Biden/Harris
Biden/Harris 2020 lets go!
It’s my reason #158 for not voting for joe Biden
This is why #BidenHarris2020 is problematic. A VP who'll be looking to knock out POTUS and take it for themselves is not a wise choice, not for Biden &amp; not for Democracy. #PhonyKamala

Biden picked Harris to be VP. I guess she can pull her campaign bus out of mothballs.
Cenk, I hear you, bro, but perhaps Biden is holding her in reserve for Treasury. THAT would be a great move as well, methinks.
Biden's announcement: #BidenHarris2020
Breaking: Kamala Harris is our Dem VP pick. I just voted for Joe Biden in CONNECTICUT’S PRIMARY TODAY! It felt goooood! 😃
Connecticut’s primary is TODAY at polling stations! Our   has worked wonders to allow for absentee ballots! Voting 4 Biden will help him. Do NOT forget many state house + senate seats are being primaried + it’s census and reapportionment time!
Not to be outdone by #CTPolitics, the #BidenVP pick might just be the craziest piece of news today.   The only thing binding these two is that they hate Trump [slightly] more than they hate each other. #BidenHarris2020 #Election2020 #Circus 🇺🇲🙄 Remember⬇️
FYI, for those wondering why the market was up nice today then all of a sudden before close it dropped bigly.... Biden picked Kamala Harris ... #Trump2020VictoryNowMoreThanEver
Dear Biden... Thank You for the #Trump2020Landslide
I think Kamala vs Pence would be a better debate than Trump Biden
Now we just need a good Biden for #SNL. My favorite was Woody Harrelson.
We all should be  This is a very powerful ticket  Biden's paying attention!
#BidenHarris2020 did biden pick the "most qualified" or just the "black woman"  this is going to be easy peasy.... #Trump2020LandslideVictory

Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
It doesn’t look so good when you use the real dates does it:   Obama/Biden 1/21/2009 8,228 1/22/2017 19,827 Change +11,559 +141%  Trump/Pence Today 27,779 Change +7,952 +40%  Of course the percentage change is what counts not the change in raw numbers.  What a dumbass!
Is Biden the nominee?
If Biden is +2 in Georgia, he is more like +12 in Minnesota.
Sorry David. You’re entitled to your opinion and can vote for any candidate you want. But your comment to Patty about “some” Dems supporting Biden and her believing in a Democratic Party “monolith” was condescending and nasty. You invited a retort and should know better.
Joe “nothing will fundamentally change” Biden loses to Donald “ still trying to make America great again” Trump
This is why they selected Biden, the guy with zero likability because he was the easiest to replace because of age and dementia and bleeding eye balls
Connecticut voters expected to rubber-stamp Trump, Biden
I have no psychic powers, so look at what analysts say They say if Biden wins, expect a 5% drop in the entire stock market and worsening unemployment along with rising taxes. But solar and electric car stocks will likely go up If Trump wins, expect 2% increase in stock market
Do you believe the stock market and economy will plunge if Biden wins the Presidency?
They want a voice in the development of Biden's platform. We can't let the Bernie Bros have all of the fun.
This is a staff who is already on the ground running! Yes thrilled for  ! Getting her due for years of hard work! The Biden team well prepared and with a plan!
Nope. I’ll wait for the Biden one.
The key to re-opening schools is to elect Joe Biden, a man prepared to deal with the Trump Plague.
Seems everyone is braver than us.   Remember 1,000,000 in South Korea took to the streets and ousted their president too.  Is the street the only way to avoid Biden or Trump presidency?
Is that Lyin’ Biden talking or Dementia Joe because lots of video says it’s Lyin’ Biden
Here’s my first early morning pondering....the dnc picked joe Biden because they knew he could be easily replaced because of his obvious dementia.  Replaced with Hillary and her 3 million popular vote win over Trump in 2016
If Biden makes Mayor Pete his VP I swear 😂😂
Joe Biden's VP selection committee has now completed their work &amp; disbanded  The announcement could come as soon as tomorrow
I’ll wait for the Biden approved one.

CROOKED LIKE JOE BIDEN.
Hmm  Some speculation that Biden wants  'the whole team' ( of potential Cabinet advisers) present for the VP announcement  Trouble is no one has any real idea when the announcement will happen  Neat idea, though!
Trump is being sued by 25 women for sexual harassment...so yeah..Biden is the creepy one.  trump also believes demon witch doctors instead of real doctors. I'll take my chances and vote for the normal guy instead of trump the 🤡
You just have to go as far as looking at Biden's pick to lead his VIP search to understand what type of administration he would have.  I mean Chris "Waitress VIP Mortgage Ireland tax shelter" Dodd????
You scared people will see Biden’s complete mental breakdown during the debates? The country needs to see if the person running for president is mentally stable don’t you think? You prob don’t care because you hate trumo so much you could care less about anything else.
Couple things, Ms. Romney. It’s not his house. It’s our house. These Biden basement jokes aren’t landing like you think they are landing.
I’m so glad I’m not voting for Biden.   I’m equally happy I’m not voting for Trump.   #VoteGreen
Biden is a friggin weirdo
Sure Biden does!  Lol what a joke...  Biden doesn't know who he is! No ground game zero campaign!  Its a joke Trump 2020.  The silent Majority!
Right, because Biden has 16 Chinese Trade Marks and owes China millions. Oh wait, that’s the Trumps!
Well, you gotta have something to talk about I suppose. Currently,  gives Biden a percentage point lead that will translate into a popular vote win of around 10 million votes. With that kind of advantage, Biden would win the EC decisively.
If this differential holds on Election Day and 130 million people vote, Biden will win the popular vote by 70.5 million to 59.5 million - a margin of 11 million votes.
We can vote on issues by computer just like congress did recently....our government is completely obsolete I know this because it doesn’t function and can’t be update just like that 1995 computer in the basement with Joe Biden
This is as important as a contribution to the Biden campaign right now  Democracy Docket Action Fund contributions help to fight voter suppression  They're working very hard to sue the RNC/Trump campaign's effort to mess up mail-in ballots!
Another vote for Biden
I sincerely believe military officers are waiting for orders from President Biden
The major irony of politics is that the Leftists and MSM falsely accuses Trump of selling out to Russia and Putin- but if Biden wins, Biden actually WILL sell out to China, &amp; MSM will brush it under the rug  If Biden wins, look for rally in US-Chinese joint companies like TenCent
Only 3% of Bernie donors donated to Biden.  I say they are more than considering voting 3rd party
Rand Paul is lying to get me to vote for Joe Biden.  #StillBernie #Bernie2020
trump will win by going left of Biden we’re just waiting hands out for crumbs
So you’re voting for Joe Biden? Because Trump isn’t going to do anything about it. He’s too busy kissing Putin’s ass.
Biden should challenge Trump to a bicycle race.  can even keep the training wheels on 🤣🤣🤣
Biden didn’t know the follow up question was coming.... lol wtf
CT dems prodigal son, a drunk womanizing punk who used his position for profit and is still honored today by the CT dems and media.  Kevin, Biden is no saint as his whole family has cashed in on his position and huge racist.
I have a feeling that Biden will be giving Trump a great gift soon- in the form of a completely unelectable running mate. One of them, Rice, used to praise Scientology &amp; Communism; Kamala Harris is a trainwreck, and his other possible choices aren't better
Please stop saying Biden will go left when he said NOTHING WILL FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE start believing people when they tell you who thy are.... listening is an under rated skill
“We are getting clobbered,” he said. “The left-leaning super PACs are bringing a lot more air support to team Biden than the ones on the right are bringing to team Trump, unfortunately.”
With less than 100 days to go until election, what do analysts think each candidate will do for economy? Under Trump, expect 2%+ rise in stock market &amp; economy, with friendlier markets for energy &amp; tax cuts. Biden would mean 5%+ loss but gains for solar, pot &amp; electric car stocks
I wish Biden was in public again so he could tell people to vote for the other guy
A vote for Biden is a vote for tyranny! They want to abolish the police and in tandem take away our guns!! We must keep the freedoms and the constitution in tact! It was what this great country was built on!!! WE MUST VOTE TRUMP AND REPUBLICAN DOWN TICKET!!!
It truly is heartbreaking! At one point so many in  liked and respected Joe Biden! They understood his pain, decency, strength of character and what family means to him! A party to turning their hate and  despicable plays for power and corruption against him is a shame!
Thank you I never saw that interview! I have such respect and admiration for Dr. Jill Biden!
I see no relevance with the picture you posted. Biden and Thurmond served together on the  committee. Biden was chair and Thurmond was ranking member. They kind of had to work together
And Biden said he agreed with Strom Thurmond's passed?
I stand corrected! I'm sure Biden is the real racist and that this video isn't doctered at all! Right?
Like how you heard the cable news sound bites of Biden's comments? Which by the way he has clarified instead of doubled down on

Biden/Kamala Dem Presidential Ticket have NO position on Crime aka Law &amp; Order, which is gripping this nation right now!! There only concern is wearing masks (which I agree) for 3 months (coincidentally expires just after #Election2020 is decided) any thoughts?
Agree. Also, the largest piece of the electorate (over 40%) is Independent. You aren’t going to win without a coalition of Independents and some R’s . There are plenty of Centrists horrified by Trump and anxious to support Biden. People tuning in should feel all our wanted!
I am just wondering, the Biden/Harris ticket has has 2 press conferences in the past three day. And has yet to answer questions. (Hitler never took questions after his speeches either) To me this is starting to look like the start of a Fascist Dictatorship.

Much better odds than that for Murphy and worse for Rice IMHO. Friend of Biden's, but needs Senate approval. She reportedly has a temper &amp; very sharp elbows that made her enemies at State; it's why she withdrew from consideration when Hillary stepped down after BO's 1st term.

In the past month, more Pro-Trump TV ads have aired than Pro-Biden (63,000 vs 54,000), but more has been spent on Biden ads ($40M vs $32M), suggesting that the Biden ads may be reaching more viewers than the Trump ads.  Read the full report here:
Trump has spent nearly double what Biden has on FB and Google ads since mid-April and nearly 3x what Biden has since mid-July.   Overall, digital spending in the presidential race has totaled $420.9M, with $247.7M spent on FB and &amp;173.2M spent on Google.

The candidates' tone is markedly different on FB. In the past month, Trump has only mentioned Biden in 19% of his FB ad spending, whereas Biden has mentioned Trump in 42% of his online spending.  Read the full report here:
Since July 14, the Trump campaign has not aired a single positive ad, and 98% of Trump's airings have been entirely negative (focused on attacking Biden).   By contrast, 69% of Biden’s airings have been entirely positive, with 12% solely attacking Trump.
While recent Biden ads discuss a variety of policy issues (COVID, jobs, healthcare, civil rights), Trump ads have been laser-focused on crime and the recent protests. No Trump ads aired since July 15 have mentioned the COVID-19 pandemic.

Biden Leads Among All Genders And Age Groups: Polling | Morning Joe | MSNBC  via
Biden is looking for a friend as VP, someone who is loyal. This is a pick to make if you're 110% sure you're going to win. Rice is a liability on the campaign trail, and excites no one (and disappoints many).
I'm calling it now, Biden is going to select Rice as the VP, and it'll be a bigger flop than Palin was in 2008. This isn't the pick needed to win. I'm as much of a yellow dog Democrat as it gets, and this pick would make me have to hold my nose to vote for Biden-- which I'd do.
Trump: Some men insulted that Biden vowed to name female VP
The pick may face racist and sexist attacks from Joe Biden. See Anita Hill.
Biden should chose whoever he is comfortable with. He shouldn’t be forced or pressured by anyone to satisy any agenda
I think Biden should pick whomever he wants. Race and gender shouldn’t be his only options. I’m all for the under dog but I think people are pushing thier own agenda on him way too much

As Trump falters, Democrats and Biden eye an elusive prize: Texas
Do you think that  isn't going to announce his VP Running mate until AFTER the Trump-Biden debates? Because wasn't Aug 10, supposed to be the day of release, originally?
TRAILER: "The Choice 2020: Trump vs. Biden" | FRONTLINE  via
Well, you gotta have something to talk about I suppose. Currently,  gives Biden a percentage point lead that will translate into a popular vote win of around 10 million votes. With that kind of advantage, Biden would win the EC decisively.
Why is it when Democrats See Trump Hats, they go insane. But when Republicans see Biden Hats (if anyone has ever seen a Biden Hat), we laugh hysterically. Whose the Better person?
If Biden is President on #Election2020 USA flag is on the left, If Trump is President on #Election2020 USA Flag is on the Right.
Has there ever been a BIDEN BOAT PARADE (or is it submarines, since he spends his time in the basement)
Just imagine that person as President of the United States before Joe Biden's first term is up (IF HE WINS, which he won't)
If this differential holds on Election Day and 130 million people vote, Biden will win the popular vote by 70.5 million to 59.5 million - a margin of 11 million votes.
Nah his ability to dictate on a phone Trump’s the ability for his phone to distinguish which spelling they wanted. Then I’m guessing they just hit send. Twitter foul doesn’t equate winning the argument but I’m guessing you’ll take any angle you can. Seeing as ur pulling 4 Biden.
You do REALIZE that if Trump loses to Biden our Economy will look like Venezuela and our borders non existent.  Your Canadian/British spelling tells me you shouldn’t be engaging with American politics.
if he’s settling for biden why can’t you
So you’re voting for Joe Biden? Because Trump isn’t going to do anything about it. He’s too busy kissing Putin’s ass.
Biden should challenge Trump to a bicycle race.  can even keep the training wheels on 🤣🤣🤣
CT dems prodigal son, a drunk womanizing punk who used his position for profit and is still honored today by the CT dems and media.  Kevin, Biden is no saint as his whole family has cashed in on his position and huge racist.
I can't believe I have to say this, We CAN NOT let  get his hands on the #NuclearFootball , he would start World War III and as usual, say he's sorry, AFTER JILL BIDEN TELLS HIM HE DID WRONG
If Biden has proof Trump is being aided by Russia, and if Trump has proof Biden is being aided by China and Iran, even with no direct campaign interference, who wins? How do we get through this election in one piece?
VICE president Biden is a devout Catholic.  He speaks openly on how his faith in God helped him through many family tragedies
Biden-ites have got to know,  is saying these things because his (apparent) dementia is becoming more prominent. Joe actually thinks these things, and has to be told that what he is saying is wrong (seriously WRONG) He is not realizing they are BAD.
This #Election2020 is between two camps: A BusinessMan vs a Politician. The businessman works for the economy. The Politician works for himself first. Trump vs Biden ( people that vote for Biden wouldn't care even if was Charles Manson), they are just ANTI-TRUMP
I'd rather deal with Trump tweets than Biden's dementia.
For example, I criticize Joe Biden for wanting to increase police funding, but Trump attacks Biden by lying and pretending Biden wants to defund the police.
No, he won't, because I criticize Biden from the left and Trump would see the things I criticize him for as good
Trump doesn't need "ammo" to attack Biden. He'll attack Biden regardless of what you do.Yes biden would have opened the borders in January from china.. How many would be dead then kasie kasum
Per Elizabeth Warren's twitter, the inspector general is being investigated.....by the office of the inspector general? Idk man, this shit is fucking insane. I fucking hate Biden and Harris but I'm voting for them. If I have to do it in person, I guess I'm calling out of work.
Supporting communist China, while  supports America in his buying. It’s the little things like this that shows VP Biden to be for America first!! #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica
#Unprecedented As Biden says: "We are better than this"
Biden &amp; Harris making it official.
If Biden is not a pre-existing condition no one is
The same people claiming absentee and mail in voting are the same, are the same people who believe Russia hacked the DNC and the Trump campaign wasn't spied on by Obama/Biden.
Repeating a question doesn’t make it less stupid of a question.  Should we ask Biden this question in regards to his whole political career?
I know. I think about you everytime I hear someone suggest that the debates should be canceled. The good news is that POTUS wants to debate Biden. He won't let it go.
Obama/Biden had NOTHING to do with this
Just to be clear... Donald trump instituted a travel ban in January. But Joe Biden calling for masks in August is leadership??  I wonder if anyone knows what Joe was saying in January?? Huh,   Would someone at the times happen to have that info?... #crickets
PFTTTTTT HAHAHA OKAYYYYYYY😂😂😂 Do you not remember when kamala attacked biden for his racist policies? We got dumb and dumber here. Trump 2020
biden's ex cheif of staff now a VP there - what do you expect.
So  made fun of  for saying Kamala’s name wrong and then Joe Biden said her name the same way Tucker did. The irony 😂
Not sure it will be close Jack. I just don't see it being that close. Kamala was a death sentence for Biden.
I didn't know Biden served in Star Fleet. 😂👍🖖
Lemme rephrase this for conveinience  “Old white women who are afraid of any colored people will vote for me because I am also afraid of colored people and will change the rules in our favor. Biden is running with a black woman, and knows other black people! Please pick me!!!’”
Too bad Obama/Biden had no problem with undocumented immigrants in cages until Trump became president.
Sooooo, at age 77, with mother nature taking its course, what happens if JOE BIDEN does not make it to the ELECTION, then what??
We need a clear plan and founding to reopen schools. We also need a clear plan to stop the spread of Cocoa. Now that we are at it. We also need Kamala Harris as a VO along with Biden.
Does Biden even know he picked her. Lol
wait... why does it matter, isn't Biden going to lose anyway?
I thought Kamala and Biden has beef??
Not to be outdone by #CFBShutdown... Biden has picked #Kamala Harris as his runningmate
CONGRATULATIONS!! Biden/Harris2020
CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!’Biden/Harris2020
Joe Biden isn't salvageable - sorry

Dazed and Confused ‘Led Zeppelin’Great Biden intro
Haha one gaff listen to every Biden interview. U pick up at least 3 minimum
Sure Biden does!  Lol what a joke...  Biden doesn't know who he is! No ground game zero campaign!  Its a joke Trump 2020.  The silent Majority!
All of our current/potential adversaries would prefer Joe Biden. I wonder why?
Oh shit, I thought that was Biden! lol
Chimps (and Biden) are both able to ride bikes. Apparently, however, you can’t spell. “Compentcy?”
The only fascim is on the left. Biden is a flat out racist and will never be elected, so good luck in 2024
Can anyone show me why Biden is not a bigot ?
I hear Biden's is happening, but with submarines
Curious?Who dresses Biden?Obvious he doesn’t!
joe biden is THE racist
US officials: Russia denigrating Biden ahead of election #SmartNews
Biden did have 5-6 media types that attended his visit to his childhood home.OH BIDEN WILL SAY?? "I DID" HE HAD A BUNCH OF LOW VISIBILITY SMALL TOWN PAPERS TO INTERVIEW WITH PRE ARRANGED QUESTIONS. HE HAS IGNORED THE MSMEDIA COMPLETELY.
BIDEN CALLED TRUMP A RACIST FOR STOPPING TRAVEL. THAT'S THE FACT JACK!! ON TAPE FOR ALL TO LISTEN. LOOK IT UP.
REMEMBER YOUR #1 IS #10 LIED TO GET HIS LAW DEGREE FROM SYRACUSE. LOOK IT UP. A FRAUD...BIDEN.
The Trump pp I know about coworkers distant family aren’t going to change their minds. I know of literally no one who is on the fence. And for the record Harris is 100% an advantage I don’t know anyone whos said oh well, now I def can’t vote for Biden bc of her. That’s laughable
Politics and Sportsmanship: On last debate between K. Harris and Biden,Kamala Harris brought out some skeletons on Biden,they duke it out,Biden took it like a man,he didn't go Twitting nasty things on his opponent,he took his hit's like a Boxer,and after the match,all forgiven.
#Unprecedented As Biden says: "We are better than this"
And you know this how, woke white lady that wants racist Joe Biden in office?
I’m all for the Biden/ Harris ticket!  They are just what the doctor ordered.  Trump can go as far under as he can go.
Biden &amp; Harris making it official.
If Biden is not a pre-existing condition no one is
Please don't let Biden:Harris cut my meat. 🥺🥺 I'm scared.
Give me a break. Stop whining on Twitter, if you truly don’t see a difference bw Biden and Trump do some reading.
More than half a century before Sen. Kamala D. Harris was named Joe Biden’s running mate Tuesday, another Black woman from California took the stage at a Chicago convention to make a decisive declaration.
That face you make when people think Kamala was Biden’s choice instead of corporate Americans choice for him
This choice proves Joe Biden will make good decisions after pondering options carefully #refreshingconcept
Rudy Giuliani’s Daughter Publicly Announces Her Endorsement For Biden And Harris     What a disappointment to the all time crooked Lawyer,Failed Prosecutor,and loser as once Mayor'' Shalom'' and Good Riddance.
If Harris and, especially, Biden look extreme and far-left, it is only because the Republicans have moved so far to the right that anyone to the left of Attila the Hun looks like an extreme leftist.
Harris is the same woman, who said she believed the women, who accused Biden of sexual assault, and improper touching. Talk about willing to sell your soul. No integrity in that girl. #HarrisBiden2020
I've seen bigger crowds of Biden supporters looting Chicago's Best Buy.
I am elated to see that Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris as his nominee for VP. I can’t wait to vote for Biden/Harris in November and send a message to all Americans that tough women make history.  #BidenHarris
There was a bigger crowd of Biden's supporters looting Chicago's Best Buy last night.
Exactly my point. Joe Biden is just a paper puppet. Still unfortunate that the blacks need the whites to get there though.
As much as the Kamala Harris thing is like, completely tone-deaf and insane Biden's VP choice literally doesn't matter and has absolutely no influence over the election what so ever.   He could have picked Sarah Palin and the needle wouldn't budge.
Woke up last afternoon (I'm working nights this week) to this news. I couldn't be more delighted. Kamala Harris is brilliant, eminently qualified, and, a strong advocate for equality and justice.  I'm ready to do the work to get her and Joe Biden into office. #BidenHarris2020
Try and stay out of politics on here...but seeing so many people happy with the VP pick by Biden was cool to see. Really cool to see actually.   November 3rd feels so close and so far away at the same time.   Educate yourselves and vote 👊
Pray for the safety of America if your paper puppet Joe Biden gets elected.
i’m guessing it goes to joe biden.....
Sooooo, at age 77, with mother nature taking its course, what happens if JOE BIDEN does not make it to the ELECTION, then what??
#Biden picks #VP based on gender &amp; race. That's the American way!!! #WhataJoke
Thank goodness Biden doesn’t waste his time worrying about grudges, spite, and revenge.
Stop. Biden/Harris 2020. We need to unite.
I'm so can excited and pumped. Biden/Harris my dream since February 2019.
What I would love to see is all Prez hopefuls on stage to show a united front for Biden Harris. So thrilled with this choice!
Biden is an idiot and terrible candidate, but now it comes to who is more of an idiot: trump or Biden
I'm so happy!!!  Biden/Harris my dream team.
Brazile will be sooo busy tracking down DEBATE QUESTIONS FOR BIDEN, KAMALA. MAYBE THIS TIME SOMEONE WILL CONVICT HER
My mood just got better with the text message from Joe Biden.#KamalaHarrisForVP
HAS BIDEN SNIFFED HER HAIR YET????
Joe Biden has named Kamala Harris as his running mate, making the California senator the first Black and South Asian American woman to run on a major political party's presidential ticket.
WOW!!! YOU HAVE LOST IT SUPPORTING BIDEN??? NOT ONE EXTRA VOTE WILL KAMALA GET. SHE ALREADY HAS CA VOTES AND NOTHING ELSE.  THE DANCING FOOL KAMALA MUST BE BRETS FAVORITE
A great pick!
Biden-Stark 2020.
SHUT DOWN HARF. FLUSHED WHITE JOE BIDEN IS FIRST UP?????? I THINK  THERE WERE 4 BLCK WOMEN RUNNING FOR TOP STOP. BUT NOW THEY NEED A TOKEN????
New Britain Herald - Congressional candidate quits race following arrest in Wethersfield; state voters expected to rubber-stamp Trump, Biden:
Dazed and Confused ‘Led Zeppelin’Great Biden intro
If the Dems are so sure Trumps going to loose this election, why are the so hell bent on getting all their extreamest policies into the relief package? They can just pass all that stuff easily when Biden takes over. Right? Oh wait maybe they're not so sure as they sound ;-)
Can’t recall Trump ever making a racist comment but heard Biden make 2 in the past week
Y’all know Joe Biden is creepy/shady af and you’re still gonna vote for him for the sole reason “anyone but Trump”.......lol.....
The Obama-Biden Justice Department determined Brown's death was a good kill.  The takeaway you should be promoting is to not attempt to assault a police officer or attempt to take his gun.
Michael Brown's was a good kill, Creepy Joe. Even the Obama-Biden DoJ admitted as much.
You have to use your Biden defebalizer he is saying is your not black!!!
Can anyone show me why Biden is not a bigot ?
Nothing would stop me from voting for Biden. Also, I have never voted Republican and I never will.
Curious?Who dresses Biden?Obvious he doesn’t!
Biden is a racist
You said Biden was barely able to read a scripted statement.  My point was that you could say the same thing for either candidate.  They are both mentally depleted.
I am going to assume you’re voting for Biden. The man can’t even formulate a thought and be consistent with what he is saying.  very scary for Biden to be placed in the highest office at president. He has done nothing in his 40 years in office what policies will he really fix
I’m voting for Biden even if he picks a loaded, BM’d Depends as his running mate. GTFOH lady.Newt says Harris is an anti Catholic bigot. He is right. It proves that Biden did not pick her. His handlers did.
Ask them… They have instant and often access to you… Ask them how they feel about not having access to Biden and ask them what are they going to do about it? The rhetoric is they are waiting for him to be nominated then they will have access we’ll see…
Nothing changes if Biden takes office, he already said it
I agree with you. Who in their right mind would vote for Sleepy demented Joe Biden?
The Daily News. A left wing rag. She is a Green New Deal, pro illegal Alien, anti 2nd Ammendment, Biden bashing fraud.
Women enters grocery store without mask. I tell her to put one on. She says she left it in the car and just needed to run in for a minute. Doesn’t matter I say. Get your fucking mask. In the parking lot she yells I bet you’re voting for Biden, stupid.
Be crazy FOR WHAT BIDEN REPRRSENTS
Hey your boy Biden is the corrupt one. Not Trump. There were numerous contacts between Burisma and the Obama State Department. Lies galore during the impeachment trial
Biden is 3 years older than trump. Who do you think would do better in a stress test?
Biden/Harris intelligent presser is a stark contrast from the unintelligent garbled ramblings that Trump delivers.
Kamila Harris plays the straight man Bud Abbott and Joe Biden is plays Lou Costello because he is always confused and disoriented. Dementia has really taken the life out of Biden very sad.
Biden??  Who can’t put two sentences together and is as corrupt as it gets?  That’s your answer????  Boy if you think things are bad now, just wait till the communism comes under the guise of socialism.
The democrats were behind the Russia hoax, phony impeachment, the public lynching of Kavanaugh led by the nasty and mean Biden bashing Harris, and supporting a corrupt and despicable Clinton. Real fair.
How can I get a Biden/Harris years sign ??
And Biden said he didn’t want his kids to go to school in a “racial jungle” 🤦🏻‍♂️
I have come to the conclusion that you liberals are fucked in the head this Vice President pick is the same one who called Biden a raciest lol you all should be committed
Lol yeah ok then clearly you don’t see it lol Biden is what’s wrong but you gonna believe what you want all I know is trump has my vote
My Biden portfolio didn't trade so well today Surprised $MJ wasn't stronger
If he gets the attendance of Tusla all over again that hurts Trump more than Biden to shout into a half empty arena.
Who are you kidding you know Biden isn’t capable of running this country so they hand picked her it’s another Clinton nightmare
Then you living under a rock because Biden is not capable of tieing his own shoes let alone run a country open your eyes
Do your research you might be surprised at what you find Biden is the raciest here enough said
Because Biden is a raciest he has been his whole life
Wow have you been living under a rock??? Biden has serious cognitive decline everybody knows it and sees it, the Democrats only endorsed Biden because they can control ever aspect of him they know he can’t run this country on his own
Biden can’t remember where he parked his car and that Harris lol she’s a train wreck look at her record as a prosecutor my god if these two are the ones you want voted in we are doomed I’d rather have the spirit squad hell they do a better job
Well you got Biden the puppet and his side kick or Trump hmmmm it’s obvious trump sorry to say , Biden and his side kick lol oh my god hell if these are my choices my pick is Trump those other two scare the hell outta me
My name is Joe Biden and I did not write this message.
Lmao she’s dead on arrival
Aren’t you voting for Biden? So much for being against pedos
If Biden doesn’t get elected we're basically electing Donald Trump for president.
Lol yea I’m scared alright IM SCARED THAT A LOONEY TUNE ABSENT MINDED PERSON LIKE BIDEN WHO CANT REMEMBER HES EVEN RUNNING FOR OFFICE IN CHARGE AND THE CRACK HEAD POT SMOKING PERSON HE PICKED AS HIS RUNNING MATE NOT TO MENTION THIS
Screams “ wake up “ because you dreaming lol lol so joe Biden who can’t remember where he parked his car is refreshing lol lol I’m literally laughing
Official Stratford results as of late Tuesday:  Dem registrar: Simon 2,559, Simon 1,141  Dem president: Biden 3,513, Bernie 398, Tulsi 37, Uncommitted 115   GOP president: Trump 832, De La Fuente 84, Uncommitted 114
Biden-Harris: Continuing to bring you an Authoritarian Fascist Police State America. "Sit down, shut up, or you'll be even sorrier."
Great. So as soon as Biden has his massive stroke, we'll have a cop running the country who believes in slavery and is willing to sell out thousands of people as long as her payday is good.

Joe Biden Picks Kamala Harris To Be His VP Running Mate In Historical Moment
Biden has apparently picked his #VP — predicting Harris or Warren for the ticket. #Election2020
Market is saying absolutely nothing on Aug 11 although it is certainly not uncomfortable w/ a Biden win if the Senate doesn't flip. Comfort and prediction are not one and the same. Our Pres. election model has gotten every election right since 1956 except for 1992. Happy 2 share
your base case about the market not pricing a Biden victory is wrong. You assumed the Senate automatically flips. That's not necessarily true. Market performance in incumbent election years did not forecast beyond random until after Labor Day.
Let Biden try it first. Followed by Pelosi, Schiff, and Comey.
Should get Comey, too. And Hillary, Obama, Biden, and Rice. Not to mention Wray, Clapper, and Brennan.
Eat shit Biden’s twitter writers. A day late and a dollar short. Fauci is Mr. Wrong and a Hillary loving democrat operative.
That's exactly what they want to do! They want to come in &amp; take our firearms but it would have to be over my dead body! People better buy all the ammo you can...now!! All I can say is God forbid Biden wins SOMEHOW, it would sadly be DEATH TO AMERICA! Pray for OUR COUNTRY! 🙏🇺🇸♥️
At least he can read. Biden can’t read off a teleprompter. The Lincoln Project sucks.
And #StatusQuoJoe Biden is a lifelong Corporate-loving, Wall Street-worshipping, Billionaire Class sycophant that sure as hell won't do a damned thing for The Poor and The Working Class.
Joe Biden does.
Please watch his last twenty “appearances” on tv. Orange man bad but Biden ain’t it. And Harris, Bass, and the lying Susan Rice ain’t it either. MAGA 2020. Orang man good.
It’s pretty transparent that the payroll tax deferral is mostly to screw Biden if he wins. Everyone would owe an additional $1,200 at tax time.  If trump wins, the republicans will push to forgive it, if he loses they’ll oppose it.
Your outright lies are laughable! I don't know who is more cognitively impaired,  you or Biden.
The hidden issue is the payroll tax is going to accumulate until January, which he’s saying he’d like to void it altogether. Whoever is the President, whether Trump or Biden, hopeful they both stick to that.
I’m not just voting for Joe Biden for President - I’m voting for his character, his decency, and his leadership.   Joe Biden knows the heart and soul of America - and he’ll lead us into a…
The Dem Politicians don't care because to them this IS normal! THIS IS DISGUSTING AND  BIDEN IS A PIG! Look how uncombfortable cease young children are with him! #VoteNoToPedoJoe #Trump2020 🇺🇸
It's NOT okay to sexually assault ANYONE EVER! TELL ME WHY ARE YOU ONLY FOCUSING ON TRUMP AND NOT BIDEN?
100% correct! Biden is in front of all these cameras touching all these children smelling their hair putting his hands all over their bodies in front of everyone so if he could do that imagine this shit he does behind closed doors!!
Remarkable that Trump somehow has the credibility among his followers to criticize Biden's faith and belief in God?  Its akin to watching Stalin lecture Eisenhower about democracy.  The hubris is hard to fathom.  The enabling by his supports - impossible to swallow.
Never said he wasn’t there just said that Biden has been hiding 🤷🏻‍♂️
Bruh to be fair Biden has been hiding in his basement this whole timeBiden wanted mandatory masks in order to mitigate the spread
They may say they hate Trump but secretly they know they have to vote for Trump. There is no way intelligent people will vote for Biden-Harris. They’re just afraid of the Dems ‘cancel culture’.
That’s not an answer. Truthfully, it doesn’t matter. She could say, “I’m going to do my best with the opportunity from Mr. Biden to serve my country” and it would have all gone away. But this is a lame answer.
Something something something Trump, something something something Biden. I don’t know, I’m really not that into politics.
Anyone know who at the Biden campaign can correct that the texts I’m getting mostly address me correctly as “Sara” but occasionally address me as “Frederick” 🤦🏼‍♀️  WHO IS FREDERICK?!?
F U,  it will be a landslide victory for Biden!
Vote for Biden. It’s the only option. Not voting is a vote for Trump A vote for Biden is getting rid of Trump. This election is not about loving the Democratic candidate it’s about getting rid of Trump 🛑
Biden was not my choice....Kamala and Amy were my picks...my heart died a bit when they both dropped out...I supported Biden because he is our way out of this Trump nightmare; but now...with  on the ticket...I'm energized again....#WomenSupportingWomen
until the illegitimate president takes follow up questions; ans  all ?'s even the ones that make him uncomfortable, there's no reason 4 Joe Biden 2 agree 2 b torn apart by the press.  You ppl allow Trump's daily press conferences to become rallies...stop bitching about Biden
So..it's only a problem because they endorsed trump and not biden. Gotcha.
That's not true. while Biden's copies of his papers are at the University of Delaware, the Senate has access to it's own records. Otherwise there would be no Senate Archives. The minutes of every committee meeting, all employment and personnel records, copies of legislation etc.
You want higher taxes, more regulation and China to own us feel free to vote for Biden. 50 years in govt no accomplishments
There is no time more powerful in filtering out the adults from the children than the few months leading up to this specific election. Every single person who claims they will not vote for Biden is a petulant child who hasn't suffered enough to understand what is at stake.
What are you talking about? Trump is 74 and obese. Biden was out on his bicycle while Trump was sitting his fat ass in a golf cart.
Biden calls for nationwide mask mandate
Was waiting for Biden supporters to try this one!! No way in h*ll are we Republicans going to let Joe out of this one!!! I CANNOT wait to see those debates!! But also the AMERICAN PEOPLE deserve to hear his plan!!! We haven’t heard ANYTHING FROM THIS MAN!
Tell Joe Biden: Make Abortion Access for All* A Top Priority
Now that6a Biden endorsement!
By no means am I saying she’s the anomaly, what I am saying is she aint lock up all them black &amp; brown people disproportionately in jail now. The mandatory minimums,etc is what I meant by her having to do her job while people like Biden wrote the laws that featured the minimums.
Better than i could have dreamed.
Biden, Harris lash Trump in introduction of historic VP pick
There is precisely zero chance of that. If you want to cause the demise of a right-wing party vote for Biden and the Dems. This year, if the Republican party pays a real price for Trumpism it could collapse, nothing else will have a positive effect for progressives.
See what you wrote? That's part of the noise I was referring to, no one who votes Green would choose Trump over Biden on the merits unless they were mind numbingly stupid. And how has not supporting Democrats worked out for the Green Party? How's Climate Change doing under Trump?
That's simply not true. More will get done about climate change with Biden than Trump. It's not even close, and a vote for anyone but Biden, is a vote for Trump. The big money donors have to be shown that Trumpism will cut them out of the power structure.
In the real world either Biden or Trump will win. I'm not a Democrat, I have voted third party for decades. But Donald Trump is a clear and present danger to the Republic, voting for a candidate with no chance of winning while Trump is on the ballot is no better than voting Trump
If you support Trump, and voting for anyone but Biden this year is exactly that. You are not anti war. You'll pretend, but it won't be true.
Not my party and you're full of it. In no way is Biden worse than Trump. We will have 250,000 needlessly dead citizens by election day because of Trump's incompetence and his irrational destruction of anything associated with Obama. And the environment? Biden worse? GTFOHWTS.
Biden was accused by someone who changed her story 6 times (and it's still sketchy). Trump has been credibly accused of assault over 2 dozen times, confessed to it on tape and is fighting a subpoena for his DNA that will prove his guilt. These two things are not the same.
Supporting anyone other than Biden is normalizing the brutal rape,  threatening and intimidation of 13 year old girls. There is also no getting around that fact.
During the 8 years of the Biden Vice Presidency, he expertly hid his Sharia Law obsession, only to enslave us now!
When you encounter “leftists” who claim they see no difference between Biden and Trump and refuse to vote for Biden, they are either Trump supporters, or too dumb to know the difference between life and death. Block them and move on.
This clip of Biden on a bike, you would think would not be what fox would want to put out there. Could you picture Trump on a bike. Omg i would pay.
He only got 11% of the vote here. I thought maybe he'd win because Biden people would stay home. CT did vote for McCain over Bush in 2000. The primary is always too late here to matter.
like I know Kamala is questionable at best but it’s rly infuriating to see people try to dissuade others from voting for her/Biden. Do y’all really want 4 more years of trump? Don’t do that 3rd party shit this time. Save that for 2024. We need stability now
Ryan Grim, who broke Tara Reade's story, was also the first to report on Christine Blasey Ford. There's a lot of complicated details, but here's a timeline of what happened
You have the temerity to call Biden a racist, and then tweet about preventing “low income” (“where black people live”)housing... that takes chutzpah. 2 terms-“housewife” and “red lining”-are 50’s terms and you and your father were masters of segregating blacks away from whites.
Did you just type this up a week or two ago and drop in the name of whoever Biden picked afterwards?
Uhhhh RacistImpeachedOrangeAssClown, she is not your opponent, Joe Biden is.  Time for some more "memory" exercises.... #Resist
I have to disagree with you. Biden has locked up black people. Kamala had to do her job effectively to get to this moment. She doesn’t make the laws but it’s her job to enforce them. Biden wrote in those laws locking up black people &amp; making automatic minimums
Um, Bishop? Biden IS a Catholic. His faith is integral to his life.
Lincoln created a cabinet of rivals with the idea that they would be reluctant to disagree with him and would not hold back when they thought there was a better way to do something. Biden is just as fearless.
Why Kamala Harris was picked as Joe Biden’s running mate
Ok, if we’re being honest, why is Tulsi not the candidate?  If we’re being shady about shit, why is she not the VP pick?  The Dems shoved Bernie aside for the likes of Biden, who legit can’t remember his boss’s name, and doesn’t know what year it is or the office he’s running for

Trump, Biden top 80 percent; few glitches at polls, in flood of mailed ballots
Why Kamala Harris was picked as Joe Biden’s running mate
Some people view voting for Biden and Harris as damage control. Its more of a trolley problem. Damage will be done either way, but I don't think you have the moral luxury to not pick a side when Trump is stoking the flames of America's fascist institutions
I don't think a lot of people realize how troubling Kamala's prosecutorial record actually is– No one should be cheering her on while innocent people rot in jail. Vote against Trump and Pence, but if Biden and Harris win, don't get complacent
Warren has radical policies that don’t win elections but at least she talks like a leader and sounds like she truly believes what she’s saying. Every other candidate is corrupted. Biden and trump don’t believe half the things they say, it’s all for the sound bytes.
BREAKING:  Harris picked by Biden as VP candidate for Dems.   #VPrace #kamala #VPdems

I don’t necessarily disagree with that. Biden is way too old to run for reelection in 2024 potentially. It’s probably gonna be Harris vs AOC
Maybe. But I feel like Biden is not actively harmful to our civic institutions like Trump is, even though they’re not in their right minds.

That’s why Biden wants to undo trumps tax cuts for the rich. Historically Democrats are much better with the deficit than Republicans are.
I think Biden wants to raise corporate taxes and the top marginal rate to some extent.
That’s ridiculous—Biden loves to take questions. Usually can’t get him out of the room.  Didn’t take questions the other day because it was a formal announcement speech.

Campaign in need of cash? You’re a stooge. Check the FEC records you lying has been. Biden is FLUSH w cash. Trump is so down in polls he’s running ads on Fox! Call the wifey home. She’s gone in 83 days.
She is right...the answer is not more police officers...and for the record Biden Harris are not saying defund the police...
He’d be so damaged after that. Heck maybe Biden will give him some ambassadorship. That might be more likely than Warren leaving the senate.
Best chance for Harris to become president is to assume it, should Biden win and not serve the full term as many pundits predict - Too much Harris-baggage otherwise !

Somebody at the FBI definitely needs to interview her concerning this threat to Biden--what does she know and who does she think is going to harm him?
"Stop playing politics with the virus" is actually a good line. Completely disingenuous, hypocritical, and fraudulent, but actually the classic response to the DEVASTATING attack that Biden and Harris made on him yesterday. Don't "play politics" when I kill people--just mourn.

I wonder how many times joe biden asked kamala harris if she owned any 7/11s when he found out she’s Indian
Okay -- except I was specifically reacting to umpteen zillion tweets, many tagging the FBI, that said PIRRO IS THREATENING BIDEN!!1! I'm perfectly fine with saying that Pirro is a doofus conspiracy theorist who operates in bad faith.
I’m just over 600. Slowed down a lot and am very happy with the progress. If anyone else wants to follow I follow back. You’ll be entertained at least once. That more than we can say for Biden or Trump at the moment
A fair point. But easily enough refuted by, well, Biden remaining on the ticket. Far zanier and more dangerous conspiracy theories are on their way.
What is it you're not sure I believe? I don't think Pirro threatened Biden in any way. And I think that Pirro says insane things all the time, so a random conjecture from her that Biden might not be on the ticket doesn't move the needle for me.
Great sporting from   #BidenHarris2020Landslide

Mr Biden,  love ya, and Kamala too  . Yesterday, I noticed that when you removed your mask that you touched your face. Please I know it’s difficult but you have to get out of the habit we can’t lose you guys please b careful
I suspect she is saying (without evidence, natch) that Biden's health will be an issue between now and November. On the Pirro Controversy Scale, that hardly even rates a mention, much less a Twitter riot.
Oh, boy, crazyloonperson Jeaninne Pirro is trending, let's see what the story is.  People are saying she *threatened* Joe Biden?? Holy crap.  {watches clip}  Uh, guys. That's not remotely a threat.
Could u please find out what  thinks will happen to Joe Biden in the next 2 months? Sounded like a threat to his life. If anyone said the same abt  u'd look into it. Pls extend the same courtesy to our former vicePOTUS &amp; current presidential candidate

I agree Bill. It’s painful, but I think Biden has to go through the gauntlet and do it. Otherwise he just looks too wimpy. He needs to endure the indignity of it. And I think his presidential-ness will blow Trump’s coarseness and sophomoric-ness away.

I’m pretty sure it’s not in Biden’s job description to marry people! He was making a political, pandering statement. And you bought it.the baker doesn’t have to make the cake, but govnmt clerks must follow the law. If against their conscience they need a new job.
You still have not explained why you think Biden would have done a better job, considering he said publicly he wouldn’t have shut down travel from China or Europe .
This person hasn’t said one thing that Biden would have done to manage this differently. Maybe because he publicly said he would have kept allowing travel from everywhere and hundreds of thousands more people would have died
So Biden would have shut Europe down but not China? Not sure where you are going with this. Explain what Joe would have done better
Did you agree with Biden when he said Trump was xenophobic for shutting down China travel ? Explain how Biden would have done a better job.
He launches all kinds of useless "operations"....looking forward to action with Biden Harris starting with a federal response to #TrumpVirus
I never manipulate you!Joe Biden is perfect for President Of The United States!
Were you with Biden when he said he would not shut down travel from China or.. ? What has he mismanaged exactly?

Totally different as Being Jewish is not considered a grave sin in the teachings of the Catholic faith. Why do you have a problem with this? You cannot promote abortion, homosexuality and say you are a good Catholic. Biden is free to find a religion that meets his beliefs.

Yea there is. It’s all calculated risk. It’s pretty clear from the VP pick that Biden isn’t counting on the lefts vote. He must think he has enough moderate righty’s to cover

I love how predicting an outsider would beat Hilary Clinton in 2016 means you are a fortune teller of politics. I can name 9 more people who made that prediction who believe Biden will win. The polls are the polls, we will not know until Election Day.
Biden and Harris have written off the left. They aren’t planning on getting the vote and they dont care. They are trying to win with center right voters. So be it. It’s a bold strategy cotton. Let’s see if it pays off.

A little different this time when Biden is senile and likely to step down after a few months. The VP needs to be qualified and Harris is not. She was the first person out of the Democratic primaries. How on earth is she a good pick overall?
Maybe if you are talking about Kamala the Ugandan Giant from the WWE. But if you are talking about Kamala Harris, she’s not even close to being qualified for President, which she will be if Biden wins, bc he will be unfit for office and step down within months.

Curtis Sliwa NY 770 a.m. always says DeBlasios Wife's Complexion is his protection...same with Hiden Biden - Obama's Complexion is his protection - or so he wants it to be.
This letter is basically threatening journalists that any critical coverage of Biden's VP pick will be attacked as racist or misogyny. Any journalist who kowtows to the demands in this letter should find another profession, because they'll no longer be journalists.
is awesome &amp; I look forward to a Biden administration that will be as wonderfully diverse as our country is!!  #BidenPledgesAllegianceToUS  #DiversityIsOurStrength #VoteBidenToUniteAmerica #BlueWave2020
Biden escaping a nursing home
I have not decided yet. I def won’t vote for Trump. Biden will wait as long as possible before supporting a policy and a cabinet position that I feel is important to progressive politics. If he does then he has my vote.
Trump versus Biden - made easy to choose !

The debates, man. Once they air, it’s over for Biden
I don’t care if Biden picks a one-eyed four horned flying purple people eater he still has my vote.  #Biden2020
Biden is, and always has been, a moderate.  Don't believe the stories trying to paint him as some kind of radical.  Is it likely that you will disagree with some of his policies?  Yes, most certainly.  But he will always be a person of high moral character, and won't embarrass us
touche touche. definitely an idiot in some respects, i just see trump as an intentional racist and biden as gaffe-prone ( i acknowledge my liberal bias in this viewpoint)
if you see biden as a racist, but not trump, then i have nothing more to say to you, god speed and go dawgs
literally is, i guess we have different understandings of what racism is, and we probably wont see eye to eye...all i know is nazis and white supremacist groups fly the flag of one candidate and it isnt biden (miss me with your impending antifa reply)
It'll be open house for your illegal's. That's what you really love about a Biden Presidency. Right ? Turn the USA into Nicaragua and shit.
If you can stand in line at Home Depot and Walmart then you can stand in line to vote. Biden needs the fraudulent mail in ballot to win. He is scum!!!
Hi Greenwich 🙂 Power back on. Thank the electricity gods,,, because #eversource was a total failure. Still no TV or internet yet. Now its on  Optimum. Hopefully it doesn't take forever
Biden wasn't my 1st,2nd or 5th choice....but I'm voting for him for sure. I like Warren ,&amp; I'm sure there is a spot for her in his administration.  Ideally,I'd love Harris or Rice as his pick.
Biden May be Biden, but it’s MUCH BETTER than what we have now 🤡🤡
His VP pick will not change my mind at all. I will vote for Biden/Any creature alive or dead.  But I want to see the VP candidate start campaigning! 💜
I meant Gov Lamont. Malloy was done in 2019. oops

I can't wait till Biden asks him to find China on a map
Tmrw Biden is going to announce his VP nomination but it will be overshadowed by the Big Ten cancelling football this fall. You heard it here first.
Gretchen Whitmer has classic all-American looks.
Biden &amp; Pelosi are on record for supporting (I mean really supporting) payroll tax cuts. Now that Trump is for them and to help during COVID-19 is cutting EXACTLY the SAME THING ... they are against them. Can't you people see this. It's not even hidden for the left-sheep to see.
“Biden is the only choice.”  Happy to talk ideology with you in 2021, folks.  #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica

Don’t forget how much  has done for you in 50 years! Episode 19 of The Donald Trump Show live tonight, if WiFi comes back.. here is Biden at his best.. #trump2020
Biden is a moron. Time to have him step aside for a decent candidate.
Just leave them alone, believe me I’ve tried and lost friends over! They are not going to realize till after he is all one big lie, which we are not gonna be able to expose until we get Biden in office. Thankfully he lost his other support that put him over the edge swing states
Joe Biden a Model Catholic? - Fr. Mark Goring, CC  via
Good, let the Republicans bring up Benghazi rather than attack Biden.  I doubt there is anyone changing their vote based on a six year old non-scandal.
Trump is a bad person. Biden is a decent person. Their church attendance or non-attendance on any given Sunday does not alter this in the least.
Trump says Biden is *against* God. And yet who goes to church and has any idea of what one might find inside a Bible?
It’s also hypocritical because reports are saying China is trying to interfere for Biden. And by reports I mean  which is pretty much rock solid.

Are you talking about Biden or Trump? If it’s Biden, okay, not ideal. But again Trump is literally about 10X worse in terms of sexual predation and corruption. Not in the same ballpark!
Its not ideal. But youve cherry picked the worst. If you cherry pick the worst of your father, it would be equally bad. But the bigger picture is Biden is much more qualified than your father - in knowledge, experience, ability to hire and listen to talent, and character.
Biden with certainty will usher in less chaos than what we’ve had under DJT.
Westport (Fairfield county) is a nightmare. Malloy has called for disaster relief. Connecticut ain't gonna get a dime from the fed. We voted for the email lady. #Eversource #poweroutage
i don’t really know. i see so many people say “biden 2020” and it’s just like isnt he worse.
Yeah I support Biden, but at this point I’d back any candidate who shows any interest in ending the pandemic
The only thing Biden has to overcome is  corruption... lol
people only pick biden becasue that’s the only option.
Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said that while he won’t tear down President Trump’s much-touted wall along the United States’ southern border with Mexico, he also won’t continue construction of the barrier if he’s elected president in November.
VP does not matter &amp; Biden himself does not matter - after he is elected - Antifa/BLM/AOC/Sanders/Warren/Squad/Pelosi/Schumer - ALL THESE DEVILS WILL BE IN CONTROL &amp; DIRECT THE COUNTRY TO HELL !
"By the way… as I joke… I shouldn’t say it, I’m going to say something I probably shouldn’t say... Anyway, I’m very willing to let the American public judge my physical mental fill… My physical as well as my mental fill, fitness..." -Joe Biden [SENILITY IS SETTING IN]
Biden should just announce the VP at the convention. Torture people a little longer pls.
Would they be of any use to Biden? I’m sure he’ll have a treasure trove of smart people to appoint.
We’re is black lives matter now! They should add to the reward. But they spend million for Biden’s campaign. Scumbags
should announce his VP pick TODAY! She should hit all the Sunday shows (MTP, FTN, SOTU) Go on Fox News as well. Then all the late night shows next week. Plus Howard stern. As quiet as Biden has been, his VP can raise the roof. Get moving Donkeys!!!! #PR
Good luck. I saw my doc and was given anti anxiety meds. They really helped. I haven’t needed an emergency pill, in months. Once my head wasn’t “everywhere”, it was easier to engage. Sending my best, brother. There’s no shame in seeking some help.
All Trump is trying to do is create a series of financial cliffs which GOP can use to their political advantage in the Biden years. We saw Bush do the same to great effect in 2013 Fiscal Cliff.
I don’t agree. Surely you can cherry pick quotes all day, at the end of it Biden will still be Biden and Trump will still be president.
I would love to see his reaction to Joe Biden telling him he ain’t black if he doesn’t vote for Joe.
Nothing presidential about Joe Biden, but keep looking.
I was in that rut! I wish I had some sage wisdom, to offer. I just engrossed myself in a few projects, at the house. They’ve spawned other projects, and so on.
Thanks Bill. I finally checked in. Hope your Friday was great.
Nothing is going to help Biden. But let #Jack keep playing his game.
, what the hell do you mean "afraid" ? I'm not "afraid", and I've never been polled ! Dont try and make excuses because Biden is leading in some polls. It sounds desperate. I don't give a damn about those polls. #Trump2020Landslide.
A vote for Biden is a vote for China. A vote for  is a vote for America. 🇺🇸

Joe Biden is also actively working to denigrate Joe Biden. Is he in cahoots?
If you ask career national security folks on both sides of the aisle, they will tell you that among Democrats, the only person whose track record on national security is worse than Susan Rice is Joe Biden. That combo would be a disaster from a foreign policy perspective.

Tbh I have a strong feeling Biden is going to lose the race ...
I expect Biden to probably carry that district by double digits. The few statewide polls in Washington have indicated we're well on our way to a 30+ point victory statewide. If that's the case I don't think the GOP ever stood a chance here.
A lot of the shit coming outta Joe Biden’s mouth has really started making me doubt Obama
