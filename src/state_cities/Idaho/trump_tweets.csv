True. Russia, North Korea. No respect just the knowledge that they can manipulate trump.
Nice neighborhoods, good schools and education for our kids, a decent home, car, job, food on the table and money to live and enjoy life.  Trump gave us a great start at regaining that and we need to fight back if we hope to have those things again. We needed a business type guy

Well, she is correct. We could have, and would have had Covid19 under control before now, if it wasn’t for Trump’s leadership. We could have had 160,000 less funerals, and our small businesses and schools would be much more secure today. Thanks Don!
Yes it will be interesting to see the fall out from this crap going forward. For instance gun rights will get a big boost. GOP should get a boost after people see all the crazy, especially in big cities. Trump will be competitive in blue states and will win big.
Answer to What’s the most hilarious thing Donald Trump ever said? by David McPhee
Trump is our greatest crisis.
Funny, the groups I am in have people from all over the world and they love Trump and wish he was their leader. Now Biden, hiding, that’s funny.
Biden has balls? Hiding in his basement doesn’t seem brave to me. Trump is fighting for all Americans! Wake up &amp; do your home work.  All the negative is coming from Dem run states.  When our city had threats of riots the republicans out numbered them 5 to 1! Patriots standing up!
You’ve proven a basic misunderstanding of the problem, of what Trump is saying, because your part of the fake news.
None I just left South Dakota drove through Wyoming, Utah back home to Idaho and the Trump Train was everywhere
The American media is seriously the enemy of the people. They report only news that might be helpful to Joe Biden and make no mention of successes of President Trump. Very unfair to US citizens who make decisions (VOTE) based on info reported by media.

Trumps indecisive pondering about how Epstein died while in jail, when the ”official” report is suicide, and yet he mentions “killed” twice is another insight to what he’s thinking. Because he knows.
Living at the whims of a Trump'er governor is frightening. Idaho is a deeply red state, but we all have to live with our representatives' choices, political or not. Governors/state reps should protect their constituents just like they would their own families, imo.

Violent destructive riots took place before feds came in and the governor nor mayor acted in anyway. Blm and antifa caused the choas with organized terrorism like bricks trump is restoring law and order. Officers are being shot in daylight middle of the city for being an officer.
No apologies needed.  Trump and his campaign have one set of standards and one message that instills fear about voting by mail. It would not have mattered how you addressed it.
Trump’s favorite new five words which I ‘m sure he won’t have trouble repeating. It. Is. What. It. Is.
I guess we will wait til nov. too see how many think trump is joking. He is a joke. Don’t forget to vote by mail. Don’t get tested for trump virus I would want you to get it. Hmmmmm I think you already have it.
I’ll bet you don’t feel a response is necessary 😂. Biden has spoken publicly many times especially recently. He is very eloquent. Trump can’t even read fluently from notes. Why would you say I hate trump. He’s just incompetent and incapable of be president. Do you hate Biden?
What was your maiden name?  Is trump your married name? I didn’t know you took your wife’s name when you got married. Will you do that next time too?
IMHO, the bulk of tRump's ( tweets are penned by his lackies.
What a comparison; between Biden &amp; Trump campaign.  Sez a lot!
It’s called self restraint...something Trump knows nothing about!
Trump: OPEN THE SCHOOLS! Stonekettle: Send your kid to one.  Twitter: How dare you threaten a child!  With...what? An education? Or is there some sort of disease that could be caught by being in a crowded space for several hours?
The Trump appointee at USAID we reported saying women shouldn't hold public office, called for mass deportation of refugees, and who attacked the "gay agenda" says she holding a press conference with Jacob Wohl's group.
Wawawa why are you trying to create more problems we are already dealing with the Trump Covid-19, don’t you think maybe you should shut up and get out of the way.
John Lewis is the hero, and I don't care what Trump says he loves dictators and Love's death
You are still avoiding directly addressing the topic we were discussing which was trump’s mental capacity test. But I totally understand why.
Classic Trump response. Nothing is ever his fault.
Are you effing NUTS or just a tRump deplorable?
Trump won’t lose!!!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
All of us
FDA, filled with same Trump hating swamp creatures as the FBI, IRS, DofEd, et al.  #DrainTheSwamp is real and applies to every Department
Trump ought to sue for plagiarism.
Yes he said in trumps interview he took it himself bc he was curious. I was too so I googled it and took. It’s a very basic test. Take it, then you’ll see how ridiculous trump’s statements are about the last 5 questions being very difficult. They are not at all difficult. I think
This is a great thread discussing the great value of the 5th volume of the SSCI (Senate Select Committee on Intelligence) Trump-Russia report.
I agree with this sentiment! Biden doesn't have the chops or the energy to face Trump.  It will be a glorious defeat for Biden!
This would happen to me if I tried that! Would still vote for Trump even though I fell! 🤣🤣🤣
Actually, Trump has done more for me, a disabled veteran, than Obama did in 8 years. I can't complain.
so I get my meds by mail, I've gone without for a week. My high blood pressure pills is what's worrying me the most but since Trump apparently owns the Secretary of USPS it'll be a lot longer the Secretary of USPS is in Trump's back pocket so I might have to sue
The dumbest argument I’ve heard from a Trump supporter is ‘We don’t believe everything he says.’ 🤪🤪🤪🤪
DONALD TRUMP IS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!
Trump attacked the press again a few hours ago, calling them the “Enemy of The People” on Twitter.  Now “Enemy of the People” is trending.  Let’s make sure the only thing at the top of this trend, besides his tweet, is this video 👇  #EnemyOfThePeople
WORD
Thank you Mr President Trump for showing the truth everyday about the Media. I have unsubscribed to every Media that tells me how to think. Trump 2020!
My hope lyes with TRUMP 2020, the ONLY real hope for this country.
I'm with ya prezz. Go TRUMP 2020! Or lose our freedom.
We've got a great president, I hope 4 more years of his live for this counrty and citizens. Trump 2020
Trump laid out his second-term priorities … (we think).
There is no possible way this could backfire right? If even one child dies from this decision Trump should be removed from office. Gambling with our future big time.
Exactly no mail in votes and Voter ID so Trump can't cheat.
What good is that if don't use it?
FRAUD: trump says mail-in voting leads to fraud in the election but encourages gop to vote by mail.
Not as laughable as Trump was when he was interviewed by Chris Wallace. I thought you might be smart enough not to call attention to that but I guess not.
We are in the middle of a pandemic and the only thing that  and   care about is going golfing, and tick tock give me a break people are dying the White House might want a dictator but Americans don't good luck finding a job when Trump loses
#MeToo   Does Trump empower women?
and MANY other women have been targets of Trump. video below.
Trump doesn't care.
Trump has to win or u won't have nothing,  do u hear me  Vote RED 2020
What about Hollywood.  That unfunny red head that threatened to cut off Trump's head? Tom Arnold threatened Trump's son.  And all the other's. Time to apply eequally.
Looks like her ???
Just happened to me too 👇👇👇
'That' "doctor" always replying (and boosted towards the top of the  comments) on every Trump tweet..
Oh honey I hate to be the one to break it to you but.. the economy is already destroyed, tRump did a great job of doing that..welcome to #TrumpDepression
hugh Hewitt is another sick tRump sycophant.
At least Trump parents, and doesn't let the selfish undisciplined child rule.
When Trump says “cut payroll taxes” that means he wants to cut Social Security.   Social security is funded through the payroll tax.  This is Trump’s way to #DefundSocialSecurity without actually admitting it. Pass it on!
how can you support  when he loves Putin and says dictator in North Korea saying he's a smart cookie and would be honored to meet with him again this is proof that Trump wants to be American dictator not going to happen
he initially blaming Joe Biden 4 does Portland Fiasco that was started by a white nationalist this is his presidency it's happening right now it's not Joe Biden's America it's his and Trump if the votes aren't done by January 1st Nancy Pelosi becomes president
Major newspapers need to call for tRump's resignation.
Y’all stop fucking saying TikTok is being banned it’s actually not Trump doesn’t have the power to do so. That’s is abusing his power just like he was doing originally. So y’all shut the fuck up!
u know who banning tic tok for good it because this person the President Fuck Donald trump
“The political folks believed that because it was going to be relegated to Democratic states, that they could blame those governors, and that would be an effective political strategy,” So, bio-warfare is Trump’s political strategy? #COVIDIOTS
We all know it’s trump who really doesn’t want to debate. I’ll qualify that. Trump wants to debate bc he really is delusional and thinks he’ll do well. But I’m sure his campaign will do anything to keep it from happening. I’m voting Joe whatever happens between now &amp; Nov 3
And there it is. So WHEN Trump changes his tune on TikTok, simply because it will be owned by Microsoft, yet while remaining the same tech that was moments ago a threat, will we all be able to see that it’s not about stopping the dangerous tech, it’s about controlling it?
I’m telling all of my family members some who are teachers it’s too freaking dangerous. To depend on Trump to keep us safe is insanity! Latinos at home! Stay safe protect your babies cause he won’t!
Exactly. And if Microsoft does buy it, and that suddenly changes Trump’s tone, will we all be able to see what that shows us?
tRump is the spreader.
THAT'S A BOLD FACE LIE, MR. TRUMP !!!
I hate Trump!
f*ck trump
Or maybe if trump hadn’t sent 17 tons of PPEs &amp; ventilators to China or if Republicans had fully funded stock pile so it could be fully stocked..or trump had 3 years to stock it..or trump did nothing about it for 70 days..hoax, fully contained, only 15 cases #TrumpFailedAmerica
My grandson loves TikTok. He is 9 years old. He uses it to make funny videos with his friends. It is his line of communication with his friends via texting. Trump is a petty little toddler having a temper tantrum. If he can tweet, kids an TikTok!  #trumphurtskids
Trump  vote RED 2020
Is trump even good at golf?
tRump's strumpets!
I would like to know  stand on voting, will there be enough poll stations and will there be mail in voting for those at risk 4 covid-19 or is he going to stand by Trump and suppressing votes Nov 3 must happen
Trump will do anything to try and f—k up the election so he can claim it’s not legitimate. Remember when he would blow every time he was reminded he lost the popular vote and then lie about it.
But he doesn’t like trump. He is making the sacrifice because he believes in the cause on informing us re COVID 19
do you really feel that Trump will not be reelected in Nov? I'm a little shocked by this.  I guess Cernovich wants to see a Biden White House. What a waste!
are you going to make sure that polls are there and not being pulled so that we can't vote and are you going to make sure that those with us who need to mail in our vote are able to or are you going to stand by Trump and suppress voter rights?
Trump could very well lose the PV by 2 or 3% but he will be reelected with the EC.
Audio of Trump’s Speakerphone Conversation With Inhofe  via
I hate trump more each and every day. What a POS.💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
He followed one of the greatest Presidents who happened to be Black. The racism is what elected trump.
I started out as a Republican but because of Trump and assholes like you I'd rather be a Democrat any day you are a disgrace to America Putin lover
you know what dumbass, it was a white nationalist that started all the protests in Portland to turn dangerous. You know Trump lover I know you always hid the abuse that the wrestlers went through but now you're trying to hide the abuse that America is going through
If they have plenty for tanks etc then they have plenty to keep people alive. Trump wants to hand out money so people will spend it and make the economy look better before election. Wake up sucker
tRump should also be banned.
Something has to be done about the postal service, Trump did this to try and black Americans from voting by mail so that he could try and postpone the election he's sabotaging America he needs to go now
and  should be worried about this instead of trying to push back an election that won't happen they need to tuck their tails and run because America is on to him. It'll all come out Trump you're a predator in every sense of the word
Let’s talk about this after the election.  Dream  on. Trump is our man.
I respect you and all others providing the ads that we need to defeat tRump.
i'm pretty sure the blue vote is going to be split so bad that trump will barely win the election
you know you really should fact check, Trump is the one who stopped the doctor's and Putin is his best friend I suppose you think that's okay are you a traitor to America 2?
sorry I misread your comment I can't wrap my head around anything Trump does
LEWIS WHO? Media Ignores Passing of Pro-Trump Civil Rights Icon Charles Evers  via  USA
We’re not safe in Trump’s America  !
This country has become the sh*thole of the world thanks to Trump and the corrupt GOP. Nothing you can say or do will make Americans think otherwise!
tRump.
He absolutely cannot. Only Congress. Even a republican congressman said trump’s term expires Jan. 20. Then the speaker of the house (Polosi) would become president bc we wouldn’t have a duly elected president.
Speaking of courts as political tools! How many unqualified, right leaning Trump judges did you and your corrupt  push through this year while Americans, you know those people you supposedly support were sick &amp; dying? Covid was priority, not judges!
We will all be rewatching Obama's eulogy of John Lewis. Trump is irrelevant today.
tRump supporters won't listen to any Democratic explanations. They will, perhaps, listen after they suffer job and apartment losses, lose their healthcare or contract COVID.
TRUMP TRAITOR!  #TrumpTraitor #TrumpThreatensAmerica #TrumpVirus #TRE45ON
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Trump MASTER YROLLER HEADS EXPLODING.😂😂😂😂
When it elected trump
You'd bitch if Trump went
quite possibly the dumbest shit i’ve ever read on twitter, not including Trump.
So Twitter will allow Trump to talk out of his ass but they block me because I tell the truth wow
Trump farted
Omg is  related to the moron  or is Trump giving him a tax break to lie
REPORTER: “Did you want Trump to win, and did you direct any of your officials to make that happen?”  PUTIN: “Yes. Yes, I did. Because [Trump] talked about restoring relations with Russia.”   Helsinki Press Conference, July 2018
🛑IMPORTANT WARNING:🛑  My mailman just confirmed they have all officially been told to "SLOW THE MAIL DOWN," per trump's Postmaster General.  So, for mail-in ballots: SEND THEM 21 DAYS EARLY. Mail on Oct. 13th. Do not wait.  RETWEET TO SPREAD THIS FAR &amp; WIDE.
not a chance in hell Trump is the devil
It’s just as much to our advantage to keep Germany safe from Russia. Trump doesn’t know his history.
How could you possibly say, at any point, that I support Trump? That’s incredible.
Dads have different forms of parenting. Trump’s is too dysfunctional. He only does things for 2 reasons: for his own self interest or to try and make himself look good. Every move is a campaign for him at this point.
Trump’s the only president who would have pulled troops for that reason. I’m sure Putin is aware of that.
Absolutely! The withdrawal of troops was about Germany not paying their share so it was just retaliatory. He really dislikes Angels Merkle. Germany has been an ally for a long time. The left is all about peacekeeping. Not trump. He has no foreign policy. He reacts not acts.
You are so generous to trump. I think Putin knows how to play him with flattery and trump wants to be his friend. I’ll bet Putin is ecstatic about 12;000 U.S. troops being withdrawn from Germany. I thought we were talking about TV shows😋
So which reporters are getting the Pulitzer for unearthing Eric Prince's involvement in tRump's goon squad antics in Portland, and others?We all die numb nuts. Some sooner than others. COVID is basically a cold, media and CDC are blowing this COVID-19 out of proportion to scare you, make money off fake vaccines and to shut down the economy so Trump loses the election. If you can’t see that, you’re blind.
Both Biden and Trump are racist. Let’s vote in someone who isn’t.  #VoteOutRacism #Jorgensen2020
That is his plan! Just change the name of the existing Obama care into Trump care. Rs will then love it!
Whoever hasn't caught on to Trump being racist yet you must be blind and deaf. He displays it so freely!!!!! #VoteOutRacism #VoteOutRacism  Please spread the the word!
Yes.  You'll be voting for Trump while in hell.
Trump is the symptom.  The symptom is not the disease - any good doctor can explain that to you.
Hey dingus:  Biden has accepted the debate schedule. Trump has not.  Why do you lie?
Joe Biden forms better sentences than Donald J Trump. Biden is also intelligent and not a con man out for every available quick buck like Donald #TrumpIsLosing #DonaldTrumpIsAPedo #TrumpGolfsAmericansDie
😂😂 My daughter says Trump has ramen noodle hair.
The Democrats have literally put all their eggs in the 'mail in voting' basket and they'll circle the wagons more each day to say #Trump is preventing it
Trump is dangerous and destroying America as we speak.
Those who think a mask will make them unpatriotic or disloyal to Trump just get the damn virus,  but don't you hypocritic fuckers dare utilize our heroes to help you survive it. You gave that right away.
Uhhh....In 90 days trump will still be president. He will still have the authority to do this in 90 days even if Biden wins the election...
Trump said Hillary sacrifices teenage boys. Big difference. One is true the other is false.
Trump/Pence is neck-and-neck with Biden/???  Seriously?  This is why never-Trumpers really can't be trusted.
Trump/Pence is neck-and-neck with Biden/???  Seriously?  This is why never-Trumpers really can't be trusted.
Trump is one of the few Congress folks that donate their salaries LOL nice try
No one is claiming Trump as a practicing Catholic
He’ll take more away from Trump than Joe. Which is typical of this administration. If they’re not actively engaged in destruction they can’t do anything right.
I made this gif four years ago when my sister said that she could see no good from Trump becoming president but also was not voting for Hillary, and it’s as appropriate now.
Because you call Trump a 'pathetic excuse for a human being' does not make Joe Biden any better.  What are you, in kindergarten?
Trump is our own Herod the Great, who I’m sure was considered hideous and murderous but otherwise useful by the “better people” of his day.
You sound wack bro. Trump loves immigrants. Loves americans. And fights government corruption. #LawAndOrder
One thing is absolutely true about Trump:  he's *always* believed that he deserved special treatment, and sees no reason to help anyone outside his circle of sycophants get treated well.
I was asked to justify Biden's qualifications.  It was a moronic and bad faith question. I don't care if you think you should be able to demand an answer when the alternative is a sh!tweasel like Trump.
Biden is way more Republican than Trump!!!
It wasn't illegal. Her predecessor did the same thing. And several Trump administration reps do it.  Imagine focusing on something so petty, while ignoring Trump's rapes, money laundering, and susceptibility to blackmail.
Trump cares more about Putin than he does Americans. #TraitorTrump
Hell no!!! A vote for Kayne is a vote for Trump!!!!
Trump is a liar and has no clue.
Trump has no clue.
Me: "Biden's like a delicious, edible burger. Trump is a shit sandwich."  You: "So you say that Biden isn't worse than Trump."  That's how a hack works.  Trump is as shitty a person as you can find. &amp; again, anyone demanding evidence that Biden is qualified is acting in bad faith
I would be willing to bet that Trump is connected to the NRA fraud in some way.
I want to know the connection to the NRA fraud to the Trump fraud. We all know he is connected to it somehow.
Trump can't back up any of his words. #DonsNextCon
Trump: "I will protect all the cantaloupe ranches from panther attacks!"  Politifact: "There have been no panther attacks on cantaloupe ranches during Trump's term, so PROMISE KEPT!"
As desperately as I want Trump gone, if the choice was between the White House and the Senate I’d choose the Senate.
Dr. Hahn chimes in, noting that the board of pharmacy put a hold on new prescriptions to the drug when Trump first started touting it. Says it's still used for conditions like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.
Why do you write "appeared?" The Trump campaign obviously did manipulate the images to cast Joe Biden in a negative light. More dirty tricks from Trump #TrumpHasNoPlan #DonaldDeath #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
Donald J Trump owes it to the American people to resign today #TrumpVirus #TrumpHasNoPlan #DonaldDeath
The easiest way is if Mike Pence and Donald J Trump each resign today #TrumpVirus #DonaldDeath #TrumpIsACompleteFailure

Donald J Trump is a national and international disgrace #TrumpIsALaughingStock #TrumpVirusDeathToll160K #DonaldDeath
I’m almost 40 (not sure if that’s middle aged, but kinda) and I am TRUMP 2020. I’ve never been polled.  I don’t know anyone that has either.....
Your reasons are both untrue and much worse with Trump.  I have no idea how you make it through your day.
That’s why I’m trying to recruit people who don’t wanna vote for Trump or Biden because then we might have a shot. Honestly, I’d rather vote for someone who actually wants to help, than throw a vote away KNOWING it’s just gonna help Trump.
If you’re not gonna vote for Trump or Biden anyways, vote for  who’s actually trying to change the country instead of just trying to split votes.
Trump wants to squeeze every last dollar out of taxpayers before leaving White House #TrumpIsALaughingStock #DonaldTrumpIsRuiningOurCountry #TrumpVirus
Trump is not fit to tie Barack’s shoes (not that he would ask him or tell him to).
I can.  But I don't care about any loser that would consider voting for Trump.  Your question is asked in bad faith, and I won't play your stupid game.
People who can't make a case for Trump as a decent human being -- but support him anyway -- need to be convinced that an 8-yr VP is "qualified."
By casting out Donald J Trump #DonaldTrumpIsALaughingStock #TrumpVirus #TrumpThreatensAmerica
Yeah - it's the same game.  What we have now is the extreme Right (Trump), and the Right (Democratic party).  The Left - there is no Left anymore, although Ro and Obama want you to believe it still exists.
Trump is the symptom.  The Democratic party is the disease.
Get Donald J Trump under oath about any subject #TrumpVirus #TrumpHasNoPlan #TrumpThreatensAmerica
Trump is a criminal, con man and fraud #TrumpVirus #TrumpThreatensAmerica #TrumpHasNoPlan
Trump will try his best to do that #TrumpVirus #TrumpThreatensAmerica #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
Trump trying to steal election in plain sight #TrumpIsUnwell #TrumpIsLosing #BidenPledgesAllegianceToUS
No.  Anyone incapable of recognizing that an incompetent criminal like Trump is unqualified to lead America is not intelligent enough to pretend to hold a conversation about merits.
I don't believe you.  The economy generally was much better under Clinton and Obama.  (Trump coasted on the economy that President Obama left him.)  If you did badly, it was your fault.
I know all about that interaction. That wasn't the point of my comment.  You're still profoundly dishonest.  And you seem to be defending an incoherent and incompetent Trump, so your doubly deluded.
It would be smart for Trump to just resign.
Trump by half a million votes. Watch
Nevada has done nothing out of the ordinary or wrong for absentee voting this fall. It’s funny how Trump is so quick to attack a blue state over a red state. 🧐
You seem to be suffering from gravity more than Mr.Trump. #TrumpsyourPotus
Isn't New York a state that's actually handling it correctly? Now showing lower numbers? Trump is stupid.
Trump is going to prison. Better start job hunting.

Trump signs Simpson-backed conservation bill  via   #idpol
Um it's Trump America at the moment.🤔 Plus on Fox that's also Trump news.🤔
I just watched this whole interview. Trump is a liar and doesn't own the truth at all. All he does is praise himself as usual.
The irony of seeing trump supporters stand against pedophilia and still support their president is hilarious to me
I have absolutely no doubt that Trump was involved with underage girls. He definitely had a relationship with Epstein and what did Epstein do? Trump.even commented about Epstein liking them.young.
They should have done that hard work in 2016. But they stupidly believed a clown like Trump and the lies spread by the GOP.
Convenient for you to make that claim, isn't it?  Yet Americans generally have been much better under presidents Clinton &amp; Obama, and worse under Bush and Trump (*much* worse under Trump).
What?  Do you know how things work?  Do you know how Trump and the GOP have broken things?
I just realized how I worded that. Let me qualify my descriptor better, buy adding the words "for now" to the line "last real President". Of course if tRump steals another election, then my initial wording may prove to be prophetic.
When Trump is lying he's talking.
Trump is insane... literally
Idiot racists is at least partially normal. They just hid their feelings somewhat until tRump normalized it.
Of course not. He doesn't care about anyone not named Donald tRump.
My.level of hatred towards Trump and all those who stand and watch him literally murder Americans is at a level I have never experienced.
We need to stay united. There is no perfect candidate or human being. We had experienced the alternative for 4 years and the GOP for longer than that. Trump and the Nazis have to go to get our country back. Nothing less is acceptable.
The problem with believing fairy tale stories is that you then have no standard for what you accept as true.  You'll believe anything that is authoritative.  You'll believe Trump, ffs.
Because I have an opinion that matters- said opinion is that trump is a degenerate who is against women at all odds ... I will not be silenced 🤘🏼
The brainwashed that gets sucked into misinformation or at least can't tell the difference.  I do wish we did our elections more like a parliament though. I like Biden, but I do think he's to old. Trump also is to old amongst all the other reasons.
Obama opened a can of worms when he signed the Executive Order for DACA and we hen the Supreme Court up held Obama’s EO. We keep telling you guys Trump is a master chess player, but you all won’t listen.
Trump is obsessed with Obama. Is a crush or jealousy? Maybe both?
😂😂 Trump can definitely make a small crowd.
I really want to read the book, "It Was All A Lie," available August 4th. #864511320 Why Stuart Stevens Wants to Defeat Donald Trump | The New Yorker
What's the equivalent Dem hypocrisy to a "pro-life" candidate like Trump who secretly pays for abortions?  A Dem who's pro-choice but secretly forces a woman to give birth?  How are there equivalent numbers on both sides when the former is prevalent and the latter is nonexistent?
Trump's house of cards will tumble when he exits White House #EvictTrump #TrumpIsLosing #DonaldTrumpIsRuiningOurCountry
Trump is a disgrace and an embarrassment!!! #AmericaStrongerWithBiden
He chose his level of commitment, though. It’s like with religion or partisan politics. Brendol Hux was loyal to the Empire, then the First Order. But if Snoke were Trump, Brendol would be the Republican establishment. Armitage would be the enthusiastic Trump supporter.
That was before Bundy video voicing support for defund police movement.   It’s funny how the die hard Trump supporters in Idaho don’t realize most of far right leadership is not pro-Trump. Ammon Bundy, Dustin Hurst &amp; Greg Pruett are not Trump supporters.
They also suggested its possible, Trump can pee sitting down.
thats a funny way of spelling donald trump
Few people backing Trump #TrumpHasNoPlan #DonaldTrumpIsRuiningOurCountry #BidenPledgesAllegianceToUS
Suppose Trump is re-elected but the Democrats hold the House and gain the majority in the Senate. They start passing legislation and sending it to Trump. I think he would sign anything they put on his desk if it meant his approval rating would go up. He has no loyalty.
If I were Trump I would just resign.🤷‍♀️
Only have them if Trump publicly releases his full tax returns before the first debate
You and your pals sold us out to China. Made hidden deals with Russia and then blamed Trump for the things you and your pals did. This will be the scandal that finally gets you.
As far as I’m concerned, there is a straight line between Nixon and Trump and it includes all your heroes, including Reagan.
Wear it an embrace the inevitable Trump  landslide win.
Trump already said vaccines are voluntary. If you want it get it, if you don’t want it, don’t get it.
Just because Trump is terrible doesn't make Joe Biden great.  This is the logic a kindergartner would use.
Such b.s. Meanwhile, Trump golfs.
I'm progressive, my best friend is hardcore Trump. We've had a couple disscusions, but we agreed no politics, and it hasn't been an issue.  On the other hand, if someone spouts off something incredibly ignorant. I feel I must say something.
Conservatism has been a loser. It just took someone as morally bankrupt as tRump to make it so obvious.
Someone needs to blast her in the media like they do to Trump.
I said I was “gas lighting” the person in the post who said Trump was at the Island. I agree with you. Trump was never there. Some people say Trump was an FBI informant on Epstein, that’s why there are so many pictures of Trump and Epstein. That would be cool if true!
The reason the media isn’t reporting it, it’s because they can’t find any flight records of Trump going to the Island on Epstein’s plane. Watch, they will say Trump took his personal plane to the island.
FYI, I know it’s not Trump.
Read it! Twice, it’s not there in the flight records. Maybe Trump flew to Epstein Island on his personal plane. We need those records. I think you maybe mistaken for Jeffery Epstein’s black phone book, Trump’s name is listed there. I know, I was disappointed too.
I have wondered whether Trump has ever driven a car. If he ever did, it must have been a long time ago.
Hell yes!!! He won't refuse to debate Trump. It  the other way around. Joe will kick the orange fuckers ass!
He could get up to five years in federal prison at his sentencing in October.
Wake Up  via    Love this....The Lincoln Project is a group of Republicans dedicated to defeating Trump!!
Your missing out. Trump is better than domino's at delivering.  #CantseeThoughHate
Not only did Bezos not pay federal taxes in 2017 and 2018, he got refunds both those years for more than $100 million each! This is the guy who made more than $13 billion last Monday. Trump is complaining about a disparity he helps perpetuate.
Between Biden &amp; Trump is a phony choice.  Neither party (Republican or Democrat) represent the American people anymore.  Both these candidates are deeply corrupt as well.
We do need real leadership - that isn't deeply corrupt.  Which pretty much excludes you or Trump.
Unconstitutional activity that Americans are now being subject too.  Obama could have reversed some of those powers before he left office but refused to do so.  Biden may not deploy the gestapo as crassly as Trump, but he's just another corporate stooge - as are the Dems.
Do you use TikTok?  Understand the 'why' before jumping all over this headline.    told reporters Friday he will act as soon as Saturday to ban Chinese-owned video app TikTok from the United States.  #tiktokban #tiktok #china
To all the tiktok users that are going to be even more mad than usual at Trump.
Hard to imagine how stupid one would have to be to say that.  But then, you're a damn Trump defender.  Intelligence is far from your highest priority.
President Trump is going to ban TikTok by Executive Order? That settles it then. He's got my vote for reelection! #Trump2020 #KeepAmericaGreat #BuildTheWall #BuildTheFirewallToo
The problem with trump is nobody is willing to research the evidence that points to the real racist bad guy buffoons on the left.  It's just too fun to keep slinging insults at someone you dont know.  #LazyVoters
What "Muslim terrorist?"  Do you mean that there were people who did something even stupider than voting for Trump?  Where?
Holy sh!t, that's a lot of people. No wonder people hate Trump, and only racists attack Rep Omar.
POTUS needs to accept blame for virus...not China. Trump will go down in the history books as bringing Americans to their knees
As a sociopath, Trump knows all he has to do is create fear, confusion and doubt to get his way.

You're like Trump, declaring himself a "genius."  You sound ludicrous.
Um , no they dont.  You and Jeff are the loud minority of trump haters. #TheNewsisFake
Aren’t there more important things to value in a president? Like not destroying the economy like trump and you before him
Biden is more Republican than Trump!!! #CountryOverParty  #EvictTrump
Obama sold a book.😂 Trump committed fraud with a university, built a  hotel in DC that he over charges world leaders for. Just a sliver!! Look it up!!! Oh and don't forget this.👇
They’ll drag their ass through broken glass to hear Trump piss over the phone.
As much as I want to see Trump gone, if we had a blue House and Senate he would sign every bill they sent to his desk. And people would like him a lot better.
Donald Trump wants to delay the election because watching Joe Biden campaign is hilarious stuff and he doesn't want it to end.
Creating fear and confusion all there is to Trump’s game
Since when did Trump or Barr feel the need to justify on legal grounds anything they do? As far as they are concerned, they are the law.
Trump should have been removed from office!!! #TrumpThreatensAmerica
Whenever a Democrat stands up for basic American ideals the D.C. press corps always tags it as “partisan.” Meanwhile, on the rare occasion that Trump manages a complete sentence they swoon and gush “he’s sooo presidential!”
#AmericaStrongerWithBiden  Trump is #AmericasGreatestMistake  #JohnLewisMemorial
Shaming people for coming late to the party can send an unwelcoming message. However, in some cases, ie Trump only just now beginning to wear masks, frustration is quite understandable.

I can't wait for the Trump tweetstorm after today's Obama speech at Jon Lewis' funeral
Reminds me how much Jeff and Jules hate Trump. #OnlyonTwitter
I don’t even like Biden. But I will support upholding and defending the Constitution regardless. (FTR, I despise Trump, too.)
President Trump cannot "force" a second term. All he can do is persuade more Americans to vote for him than for bumbling, senile Uncle Joe.  If the democrat party wants to defeat President Trump,  they need to nominate somebody who can beat him.
Trump should save face and just resign.
I think a copy of the Constitution needs to be sent to every American, so they can see how much Trump is violating it.
The real Republicans will be voting Biden. Biden is closer to being Republican than Trump is.🤷‍♀️
He will be mocked and called weak for not being appointed by Trump and they will find something to show his non existent beef with Trump so they can continue to ignore the problem.
I always thought hate was too strong a word for me to use on anyone. But now I hate my ex and Trump.
Trump's appeal to suburbanites is one I have seen before. 10 yrs ago, there was a petition going around my neighborhood to stop a development planned across the road. The reasons to stop it? Smaller homes and duplexes were planned, which the petition claimed meant
And I thought it couldn't get any worse... Trump floats idea of delaying the November election, a power granted to Congress, as he ramps up attacks on voting by mail
America's biggest embarassment is Donald J Trump who will do anything unlawful to retain power #LyingTrump #TrumpIsACompleteFailure #BenedictDonald
This will be the last tweet I will comment on in protest of twitter so long twitter TRUMP 2020 !!!
I don't know what four years of Biden would look like (at least not precisely).  In 2024, if we are at a point in saying Biden was an obvious mistake, then I'll gladly flip to voting for a respectable Republican president.  I'm just tired of hearing Trump voters say
There is a lot of talk about whether Trump is going to accept the results of the election if he loses, but I've been thinking what my mindset will be if he wins.  I'm not sure I'll feel confident in our political system for many years if our country basically says (thread)
I agree.  Never forget that never-Trump Republicans are only just slightly better than Trump supporters. They *still* embrace racism as a tactic. They *still* seek to enrich the 1% out of the public coffers. They *still* want to deny reproductive rights.  They aren't good people.At least Trump knows where his thumb is. Biden cain't find his bum with both hands. We trust Trump!  Donald Trump Has the Sole Authority to Blow Up the World.   via
My thoughts for this presidency. At least it would make more sense if you vote for Trump again. You can claim drunken stupidity.
I both dislike and distrust Donald Trump As far as canceling out my argument it doesn't because quite a few veterans have become quite angry with the sports persons kneeling during the anthem kneeling during the anthem is it appropriate
Trump is trying to get 'help' for we the people. Dems trying to get wish list fulfilled instead!  Trump preparing 'aggressive' actions if no deal reached with Congress

Trump
I reflect on when I was a minor &amp; young adult. My burdens were lesser than yours. I wasn't young during a deadly pandemic, the racism of the Trump presidency, Alarming Climate Change, a Great Depression.  I pray the God of All religions gives you hope &amp; safer tomorrows.
Are you a Trump troll tho?
What I meant to say was after years of reading the Bible, I still agree with the assessment that it's uncommonly confusing &amp; complex. yet like all Scriptures, it's Spirit Breathed &amp; Sacred.   I'm not comfortable with how Trump uses The Book like a campaign prop.
The other thing is paying taxes or not, illegals R not citizens. Our medical system has enough trouble with treating 'citizens'. It's too bad Biden is such a brown nosed, liar. He'll say anything to win. Too bad he can't compete with Trump.
So if it can be general, then wouldn't a campaign ad from Trump qualify as him asking you to vote for him?
Trump 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
First time for everything!  #ConsequencesForTrump  America doesnt need a pathological liar as president.   #Biden2020 💙🗽🇺🇸
If Trump says that everyone needs to vote for him this November, is the church required to submit?
First meeting with the Task Force since when, Trump?  April? You are so low. They don’t get any lower than you!
Oh please stop. You let Trump off the hook. No matter what you say or do, you are forever going into history as the guy who rigged the Senate side of the impeachment process. You let a maniac, narcissistic, mass killer, racist dictator get off scott free.
I just rushed a donation to help Latino Victory elect diverse Democrats who will take on Trump’s dangerous agenda. Join me and rush a donation, too!
Reason 3 of 10 why you shouldn't vote for Trump:  He's a pathological liar &amp; has issued 20,000 misleading statements as President.   Source:    Vote #Biden2020 💙🗽🇺🇸
You go overboard like Trump in your descriptions. Trump was giving a presentation on USNP he should have been prepared.
Even the idiots supporting him want the debates. Yesssss!!!!!  Democrats want Biden to debate Trump despite risks

This is a must see/read.Wall is going up,Trade deals made &amp; less illegals coming in.Poor Joe's!Wah, wah.  Supporters urge Joe Biden not to debate Trump, applaud hosts for canceling over COVID-19 concerns

"Plenty of MAGA hats but no masks in Tampa." 😔  154,000 Americans are dead.  Overwhelmingly senior citizens, and disproportionately people of color.  Trump won't wear a mask even if  asked.  #Biden2020 #MaskUp
THANK YOU Democratic leaders &amp; candidates for promoting &amp; even enforcing mask-wearing, &amp; decrying mask shortages.  #MaskUp never should have been a debate. It saves lives!   But it looks like Trump &amp; the  won't wear or enforce masks. 😔 Even if  asked.
Trump, Pence, Barr, and other Trump officials who all recently voted BY MAIL! What’s good enough for them should be good enough for the rest of us.  #TrumpIsLosing #GoJoe2020 #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020
Trump campaign fighting to make it harder for Democrats to vote by mail  Apparently only tubby trump can vote by mail.! 5 states have had mail in voting for YEARS! And it works quite well.  His rhetoric is to have something to blame when he loses the election. He needs to &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
over to the WH? If so why do we even have them? Mnuchin, Barr answer &amp; apparently act only to/for trump the rest of them answer to us, you know the people!
PPelosi and Mnuchin dig in on stimulus positions ahead of scheduled Monday talks  Where are the Republicans (congress &amp; senate) in these negotations? They are the responsible parties, not the WH.  If trump doesn't like the results he can veto it. Has the senate given everything&gt;&gt;
Yes, no money for us, but plenty of tax breaks for the rich. Those Republicans! McConnell, if you’re listening, we hope Kentucky voters can your sorry, unfeeling ass! Guilty of so much that is WRONG FOR AMERICA, and TRUMP ACCOMPLICE!
Do you ever find out someone you really liked is an active Trump supporter and you get really sad and then you unfollow them on all social media
donald trump makes me fucking sick....bye 😀
Get REAL! The Chinese Comms will get what they want, no matter. Trump wants to gas-pipe TikTok for one reason. He has enough trouble with EVERYONE on Twitter, who isn’t afraid of his bluster and bullshit. Don’t encourage his efforts. Worry about yourself.
well, Trump did not have the Rusdisn help you seam to think he did.
Dogs are much smarter and kinder than Donald Trump. They know a good person from a bad person. No dog would want to be around him for 5 minutes!
This could accidentally be the best thing Trump does in his entire presidency. I’ll bet he decided it on a whim. #BanTikTok  -
Trump is losing his marbles... Tweets he beat Obama 4 years ago and now is planning on banning Tik Tok in the U.S.   #TrumpIsNotWell #ImpotusAmericanus #obama4
Oh no!!! What are you gonna do,  ?  "President Trump says he plans to ban TikTok from the US"
#COVID19 is not the problem.  Trump is.   "It's fading away," he said.  Now 150,000 Americans are dead. "Packed churches by Easter"  lies of a soothsayer.  Only one way to get Trump gone.   Donate to  Vote. Volunteer.   We still have to win this fair &amp; square.
Oh, really?  All the more reason to donate to   Trump's playing the authoritarian hand for one reason: Joe Biden has been outfundraising &amp; outpolling him.   We have to keep up the  momentum going friends.💙 Trump's using classic fear tactics because he likely won't win.
I think it's time we admit that #COVID19 isn't the problem.   Trump is.
Florida has the second-highest coronavirus rate in the country, but Trump barely mentioned the pandemic at his impromptu rally.   #COVID19 testing centers are closed today due to a hurricane warning. Most of Trump's crowd was maskless.
OK friends, just a few hours left to DONATE in July!  💙🗽🇺🇸  Trump's disregarding public health in Tampa in a desperate attempt to outraise    We CAN'T let that happen.   The  has a BIG goal of $8M &amp; 100,000 donations!    Can you give?! 💙
WOW, how disrespectful can you get!!  NO ONE is wearing a mask at Trump's Tampa rally, even though Florida is at the BREAKING POINT #COVID19 cases!   We saw this in Tulsa too! Trump is defying public health JUST to get ahead in fundraising!  PLEASE: Donate to
Wow Trump is done for
Wow. His lies are getting more far-fetched every day. I'm starting to get concerned about Trump's mental health.

Its always a "youre stupid" "no youre stupid" or "im right youre wrong" type shit from both sides. Like if you don't like trump, thats awesome. Im not gonna call you out for not liking him. Thats your business. But this pointing fingers and calling eachother dumb is something we-
TRUMP continually draining the swamp.....Not!
So...... over a million unemployment claims a week since April is creating jobs? Wake up! Trump has done more to harm the American economy than any President in history. He inherited an economy in unprecedented growth!  Since 33% decrease in GDP!
Its goes both ways with both parties. Democrats are just as bad about that same thing. Idk why youre only singling out Trump for doing this
Obama will be known in history as one of the great leaders and one who united the country. Trump will he viewed as bad as Hitler. Just saying. God rest the soul of John Lewis. Without him there would have been no Obama.

Feel free to blame China if it makes you feel better. Won't change a damn thing. Trump says he's a wartime President. Herm and that other old dude from Tpusa are collateral damage.
Trump should have done more leading and less tweeting during #COVID19.

If you don't see the blatant equivalencies between Biden and Trump, you need to get your head out of your ass, wipe the shit off your face and see the world how it really is, not some delusional 'democrats will solve everything' nonsense when they played into this, enabling trump
No it's not, Biden is actually why we have Trump, he helped pave the way
Yes, yes you are, as are all trump supporters lmao
There's literally dozens of different links to back up that Donald Trump is racist, Google it 😂
I don't support Biden 😂 and no you can't because Donald Trump is a racist lmao
Lmfaoooooo he was racist then like he is now but look what I found lol
Oh, bigotry and racism are the reason. Fascism is right in front of you with Trump, but you're too brainwashed to see it
'the black American I know' lmao they have every right to be upset with what Biden said, but don't think Trump isn't racist and that they don't see it, too.
Do the data, John. The problem was that Cuomo made Covid-19 an anti-Trump opportunity.  If Cuomo were as competent as Pennsylvania's Governor Tom Wolf, New York would have suffered twenty thousand fewer CV-19 deaths so far in the First Wave.

Hardest bar: on my way to fuckin rob donald trump from my stimulus 🤯🤯
Is there any legal basis that  can scream to  “Reclaim my time!” and be allowed to start his presidency back at his 1st yr? Mr Trump will need 8 more yrs to clean up after the #DemoncraticParty!  Best damn #President in modern history!
ive had high-grade elation due to the trump presidency
Trump is not worthy of any U.S. patriot vote!
SNIF... Joe is smelling a running mate..
I think the  app has been updated and I hate it. Or maybe it's the constant barrage of pro Trump ads that pop up.
I Remember where Ron Reagan disbanded the Air Line Pilots Union.. your on the clock Trump
2016 was a horrible choice between two horrible candidates. 2020, there is no excuse. Anyone, literally anyone but Trump.
Dumbest take ever. There isn’t a single VP candidate that could be worse than Trump. If you believe in democracy, you need to vote against that facist prick! #TrumpIsLosing #NobodyLikesTrump #TrumpMeltdown #TrumpCrimeSyndicate #PresidentSnowflake #WorstPresidentEver
You are so wrong about Trump
4 democrats and Donald Trump walked into a bar....
so many goddamn lies in just 37 minutes. Trump is so transparently evil it's genuinely disgusting to see people venerate him .
Good evening Patriots! Would you please join me in prayer for Donald Trump. only the Good Lord could give this man the strength and the endurance he needs to keep fighting for all of us.
They didn’t have to lol. The narrative is get trump out.
watching the axios interview with Donald Trump and you better believe I got sloshed on cheap beer before listening to that fucker speak for 30 minutes
Remember 4 years ago when an interviewer asked Trump his favorite scripture and he ducked the question by saying it was too personal? Looked to me like he didn't know a single scripture. Remember "Two Corinthians"? or "I don't ask forgiveness?" #FakeChristian
Donald Trump is against God....and I doubt he really cares about guns or "our kind of energy" wth that means.
It was easy for me to decide not to vote for Trump in either 2016 or 2020.  Voting for Clinton or Biden too great a rejection of pro life values and, while neither party exercises fiscal policy discipline, the Dems offered, in my judgment, even less hope of that. Issue, not party
Or they just decided that Biden would do even more damage than Trump.
Mary Trump’s book is number one — by hundreds of thousands of copies! #VoteForOurLives #VoteThemAllOut

I think you should appoint a commission to fully investigate the Trump administration crimes and issue a report for history, something broader than Mueller's  mandate. Let NY go after him on all the fraud charges..don't bog your DOJ down with this mess.

I was a registered Republican until the 2016 election. Trump needs to go! The guy has a personality disorder. #LincolnVoter #VoteTrumpOut #Biden2020
But that's your opinion, people that don't support Biden (who helped pave the way for Trump) don't see him saving the country or world, so why not try to convince people to vote for Biden by not mentioning Trump
Maybe give reasons to vote for Biden that don't include trump
That's not how it works, not supporting Biden doesn't mean you support Trump, like not supporting trump doesn't mean you support Biden. At least be smart.
Except Biden is an ignorant criminal too who would have more help to further trash the Country. If you want progress, you'd actually have to vote for progressives, not people that helped give us Trump
Also, not supporting Biden doesn't mean you support Trump. I know, that's a hard concept for democrats
Trump didn't damage the system all by himself, he had the help of the democrats.
So you're still voting for evil and what got us Trump
All you care about is trump not being president, actual progressives see how we got trump, which Biden helped play into it, and don't want the same shit
Not really, because there really isn't a difference between Trump and Biden, trump can actually move more to the left than Biden.
Wouldn’t change a thing if there was a black dude retweetijg trump jr. if anyone is discriminating it’s liberals like you and your boyfriend Bryce. 🤡
Thank Trump? Migrants are slaves? If only there was a way for immigrants to easily become citizens, where its not a scam for them to wait two decades and waste thousands of dollars when they aren't dangerous or drug dealers or criminals
Criminals, because his buddies are criminals, and the only people trump wants in prison are the ones that aren't on his side, he literally called for his opponent to be imprisoned
If you really wanted prisons to be full of violent criminals, don't vote for people that throw nonviolent drug offenders in prison for decades or don't support someone that abuses their power and let's criminals get away with what they did. Trump has pardoned a lot of crimini

Oh yeah, there's two or three houses a block down each with trump flags, I have a fuck Donald Trump playlist on my Spotify and a few summers back my friend and I drove by this guy selling trump shit at a gas station like three times, small town like you pass everything each way
No, because trump and republicans have been the aggressors 🙄
America was a shithole before Trump, he did make it worse but exposed the problem we've had for decades
I made a comment about Trump or Biden being a sexual predator, so this dude kept saying I beat and killed a dog and because I couldn't prove I didn't do it, I did it. It easily fell apart when I started asking where it happened, how did I get there, when it happened etc
Every dollar you don't donate to trump is a dollar you donate to Biden. So I don't have to donate anything to either of those assholes and I'm still supporting them??

Trump will be the next president plain and simple, you missed your chance, give it up.
I pray President Trump will expose the prevailing evil in remembrance of his good friend John Kennedy, Jr., who suffered the tragedy of death with his wife Caroline and who perhaps shared the same fate of his father, John F. Kennedy, the last good and beloved Democrat President.
I mean to be fair Trump is gonna eat this guys lunch so I see why they are pulling out all the stops, that being said why would you vote for a guy who can’t debate for 3 hours and want him to run the Country for 4 years, turn your brain on!!
Yes, they were both in the financial business. Once trump knew of the things him and ghislaine were involved in he hated him.
Trump partied with Epstein before he knew about what was going on on the island

Do you mean women who don’t lie? Harris said Michael Brown was murdered [by a white cop]. She lied. Given her background as a prosecutor, it was a knowing and purposeful lie intended to fan the flames of racial division for her personal political benefit. Sounds like Donald Trump
Your first three words tell the depth of your misunderstanding: “Trump is afraid.“   Trump is not afraid, and neither are the millions of Americans that are going to sweep Democrats out of office all over the map this November.
Joe Biden doesn’t even know where he is, the DNC is struggling to even find a candidate. You guys had 4 years to find a viable candidate, and just like everything else the do nothing Democrat’s did just that. Enjoy four more years of Trump, btw inflatable tubes dance better!

To the contrary, it was and has been the complete failure of the political class that forced the electorate to elect Donald Trump. The political class hates him, in addition to those who lust after its power, but Trump is only the beginning of a long-term much-needed antidote.

the “artist” of this meme failed miserably because Bill Clinton is not even pictured nor is Donald Trump, who is running for re-election right now, not Billy ... Epstein is dead and his wife is in jail, move on.
Why do we have more death then? If testing causes death then   and everyone  should be dead from all the testing they do everyday. They test themselves extremely often but the rest of U.S. can't get tested. We see Trump lies!  #TrumpLiesAmericansDie
Then why does  have such a low number of cases when everyone there is tested more than anywhere else in the country? Could it be Trump lies?
Don’t forget Trump but. . .
If Biden wins there will be protests, if Trump wins there will be riots.
Votes matter! There is only one man separating us from the rule of madmen. Vote Trump. If you don't like him ask yourself why? If you listen to CNN and MSDNC media you hear nothing good, not the accomplishments but lie after lie. Research, discover, your life depends on it.
Ask a Trump supporter”if Trump refuses to show his tax returns, are you still voting for him?”
I’ll offend many who have “liked” this thread by asking that you not vote for Donald Trump or tolerate his racist behavior and words.
Of coarse he is... So predictable, so anti Trump anything...!!  The Trump Administration could find a cure for cancer, and “The Mitt” would find something wrong with it..!!!  He’s becoming tedious..!!
Biden is as obligated to debate as Trump is to show his tax returns.
Nuremberg trials for the trump administration
Not wrong. Trump still does his name calling but it's usually merited.
Biden is like Politician Ken Doll Barbie. Now with a new outfit that makes him even more generic. And I'm voting for him. Insert generic Democrat vs Trump. That is exactly what this election is.

Senator Harris said that Michael Brown Was murdered by a white cop. Given her prosecutorial experience, she knows that is a lie. It was a deliberate, purposeful lie told to stoke fan the flames of racial division to her political benefit. That sounds a lot like Donald Trump.
You're privileged enough to say 'biden will get things back to normal' and privileged enough to be able to be ignorant in Bidens history and how Biden helped pave the way for Trump, Obama did too  Voting for what helped create the problems won't fix the problems.
I think we need to change that overused answer “what if it has been the Democrats? What if it was Trump? “Instead let’s just remember that we used to be a moral country. Most of us still are. So let’s change that to “what has happened to our moral outrage”
Re your editorial "Putin Needs A Trump Victory:" Well China needs a Biden victory and China is a MUCH GREATER threat! Also not true that Trump is Putin's fervent admirer. He's tough on Russia &amp; China and puts America's interests 1st. So what is not to like about that?
Agreed.  This is why we shouldn’t have spent so much after recovery started in the Obama administration And earlier in the Trump administration. You’ve got to save bullets and neither party ever really wants to. Stupidity, buying votes, frightfully dangerous fiscal policy
Not supporting Biden or 'working for him' in no way means they're working for trump, what an empty argument. And what makes you think Biden would actually support Medicare for All or anything that would make the country better?
Trump followers are not the predominant spreaders. Nationwide, red state or blue, young adults comprise a disproportionate and spiking number of new cases. In California, 50% of new cases are young adults were comprise 23% of the population.
Daniel &amp; friends protested restrictions of personal worship of God and a mandate to worship the king. Applying this to public health restrictions against group gatherings is nonsense. You also miss the resemblance of Trump to Nebuchadnezzar.
So TRUE! The Democrats live above the law, they can't be touched. I'm ready for Trump to make the arrests!
12 Supreme Court Justices?  Don’t be shy.  Trump is nothing compared to what you guys are gonna do And this is coming from a never Trumper.
The scales are falling off. Even the cofounder of the Federalist Society is seeing him for what he is.
Like how you say R'pubes. Totally understand what your saying and agree with you. I have a feeling but not sure that Trump will cave in. My reasoning he is so concerned about reelection that I feel he will use the government money to do it. Remember when his campaign paid actors
Trump says a lot of things and he is usually full of shit!
Yes it’s pretty sad, it’s going to Hard to find leaders in the republican party who aren’t tainted by Trump.
Biden doesn’t know what state he’s in or what year it is. Democrats should be ashamed of this choice and will give Trump 400 electoral college delegates. Klobucher would have whipped his ass. Biden/Harris will be soundly beaten. The polls won’t capture the truth
Kennewick, lonely never trump conservative LOL
We know who’s the Trump supporter 😂
Trump should not be trying to stop attempted murder of blacks by racist whites.
Actually I think his detractors Did more to foment confusion and anxiety with their false claims of an unconstitutional proposal and fascism.  Trump is a sociopath And Too many of his detractors have trump derangement syndrome.
Trump is a symptom of the problems in America not the cause, when he is gone this will become as apparent As it should be now.
I wouldn’t vote for Trump under any circumstances, but keep this in mind: the Democrats will endanger the fundamentals of our democracy in their own interest by eliminating the filibuster rule and perhaps expanding the number of supreme court justices.  \_(ツ)_/¯
16 minutes after it was announced since Covid our economy has shrunk 39.2% trump said we should postpone the election dude does this guy think we are stupid
Timely, as today so many CNN reporters assuming that Cain got coronavirus at the Trump rally, that Trump committed an unconstitutional act in proposing that the election be delayed Republicans are spreading C19 while nationwide young adults are a disproportionate and spiking
If Trump delays the election, Pelosi takes over, until the election is held, and he is gone January 20th.  Alright we can postpone the election a few years...  it’s in the constitution, you should read it sometime.
Trump on Nov. 4th.
Trump on Nov. 4th.
Not even close. Trumpism’s most persistent goal is the advancement of the interest of Donald Trump and it will play any tune to achieve that goal.
Trump is a sociopath who literally drives you insane
As crazy as Trump is you go beyond his level.  Nothing unconstitutional about proposing the election be delayed. Chris your full blown Trump derangement syndrome, And a mask won’t help
Post Trump: Filibuster rules destroyed, 12 Supreme Court justices. Who knows what else

Can’t agree with Obama’s characterization of the filibuster rules. Democrats are going to do even more damage to the way our democracy functions than a Sociopathic Trump did.
Let's just ignore the fact that a ton of trump supporters are working class
Delaying election would only delay Trump convictions &amp; jail time &amp; cause more deaths &amp; economic destruction!! #LockHimUp #VoteForOurLives #VoteThemAllOut

I think it would be a smart move and good timing...big benefits (w/generally non-trump Democrats and little cost (I don’t think many trad cons would leave trump because of it)
Idahoans for Trump 🇺🇸
Trump suggests delaying the election. Claims he is concerned about fraud. We dealt with it in 2016 from Russia. Russia needs more time to hack the system. Trump's suggests delaying 2020 US presidential election due to concerns over mail-in voting fraud
Wrong.  Trump does have the ability to float the idea and nothing he said indicates he would do it himself.  Narrative driven advocacy journalism at work at CNN.
I am surprised that so many including  are proclaiming that Trump made an unconstitutional proposal. Part of the Trump Derangement Syndrome.  Stupid, but constitutional.
To say “everything Trump touches dies” isn’t funny anymore. I’m not sure it ever was.
How about we judge them on their honesty, especially given our experience with Donald Trump. Harris said that Michael Brown Was murdered [by a white cop]. It was a studied purposeful lie.  She lied to fan the flames of racial division for her benefit. Sounds like Trump.
VPs win their party's nomination when they seek it.   No. If Biden/Harris win in 2020 then 2024 or 2028 Harris is the one and only frontrunner and I don't know if anyone could catch her.
USPS was in shambles when Obama/Biden were in office.
As this columnist did, reading "What It Takes" is essential reading about American politics and it is revealing about Biden ... Learning to Love Joe Biden
Again, my reply was based on the poll you gave me. You can dig up new polls all you want, but my reply was base on your original poll.  Again, my main point is that a Biden win is not in the bag. To promote such a thing would lead to complacency, to Dems not bothering to vote.
My math was still based on polls you gave me, third party/lack of it was already factored in. Even though Clinton had a disadvantage  that Biden doesn't have  polls Clinton lead was noise margin from  Biden's lead. My main point is that lots can happen, Trump could still win.
Susan Rice was a finalist for VP nomination. Joe Biden was responsible for blocking Snowden’s pardon. Dem operatives are now engaging in a Russiagare portrayal of Snowden. Can’t make this shit up
Hmmmm, #Boise #Idaho. Ok. Lucky for me, voting in person is 2 min away from my house, with rarely more than 5 ppl in line. Unfortunately, Idaho won’t be pushing Biden over the line, but it’s the principle of the thing.
So Greta, if Biden lies too it’s all good?
Doesn't the Biden 51.0 already have that ~8.8% missing third party vote already rolled in?  If there were a third party at 8.8% this time around then Biden would be at 42.2.  Clinton would have had ~52.4 if no third party.
3) At this point (80 days out) Hillary was in the middle of her post convention bounce and up 6.5%. Biden is not and is up 8.5% (538 average).  The electorate is also more engaged. And there are FAR fewer undecideds.  This is a very different race.
What you posted (+8.6) and (+6.5) are less than 3 (noise) apart.  August 15, 2020 #Biden: 51.0% (+8.6) Trump:  42.4%  August 20, 2016 Clinton: 43.6% (+6.5) Trump:  37.1% Johnson: 8.8%❗
It’s priced in. Biden’s been doing this for 30 years. And nothing he does will be anywhere close to Mr “they should inject bleach”.  Further, elections are about the incumbent. What Biden does or says is almost besides the point.
It’s basically a formality, the Biden delegates from round 1 will keep electing Biden people... but when everybody else has dropped out there’s some shifting that gets weird. But, of course, at that point it no longer matters so no one cares.
😂😂😂😂😂😂 Biden is senile I am not Russian, you moron
I get that part. But HOWEVER Biden is not the answer not even close. And Harris her self is a fraud. Trump is going to win again SOLELY on who he ya to compete with. Biden will be dead in a year or two with his degenerative health
She said she believed Biden's accusors until he offered her the job as his running mate. She sold out! If she did it now, what will she do in the future????
Call Biden
A vote for Biden is a vote for SICK!
Positive polls kept some Dems from voting in 2016.  The lead difference between Biden and Clinton is within noise margin.  Call me paranoid but I'm sure Trump/GOP has an effective October surprise in the chamber.

Has anyone seen a "Biden rally "?? Does anyone outside of Washington,  California,  New York,  and Oregon actually realize hes running?
Don't let any Biden/Harris polls lull you into complacency. That is what happened in 2016.  Go Vote!
After SC:   Bernie had 60 delegates Biden had 54 Pete had 26 Warren had 8 Amy had 7  Biden was a close 2nd, not 5th. Lots of people were voting for him.
Biden promised a woman. Other people hinted he should consider a minority woman, but that’s not something Biden or the campaign ever promised.
Biden won the 4th state (SC) by a lot. And after SC Biden was basically tied with Bernie for delegates (only 6 behind).  Some people were voting for Biden.
The app didn’t work on the night of, which caused delays. But no, after 3 recounts and audits Pete won the most delegates in IA.  Pete won IA, Bernie/Pete tied in NH, Bernie won NV, Biden won SC, Biden won ST, Biden won 3/10, and that’s the ballgame (although Biden also won 3/17)
Kind of. Bernie’s strategy was to leverage his high name rec and HUGE fundraising to stomp out all the competition in the early 3 states, do well in SC, and put it away on ST  By getting 25-26% of the vote in Is/NH he let the field survive and have Biden an opening to get back in
There’s going to be a consistent systematic “bias” when demographics are clearly shifted. The age group that favored Biden was far more likely to vote early/absentee and far less likely to take an exit poll. Hence the bias.   It happens.
Home state effects are overrated and not that important.  And Biden was leading by ~8% before naming a VP. He was looking for a governing partner not an electoral advantage.
When candidates drop out their supporters shuffle.  We saw no drop off in Biden votes between Super Tuesday and 3/10 or 3/17. Biden wasn’t their first choice but they did prefer him to Bernie.  Which, ideologically, makes sense.
I just ordered my Biden-Harris Facemask. I'd love to order a Rabi face mask!  Fund raiser? 😷
Biden/Harris Facemask  Just ordered mine!
yup. He underperformed in the first 3 states.  Good thing, for Biden, it’s a 57 state contest and not just 3.
Bernie dropped out on 4/8 and endorsed Biden on 4/13.  It took a couple days to work out what they were going to say and put together the announcement. They were essentially simultaneous.
All the candidates (aside from Biden) merely “suspended” their campaigns. Colloquially we refer to that as “dropping out” because the candidate in question is no longer trying to win.  “Suspended” is simply the legal term.
What you’re seeing here is what happens when all the other cadidates drop out. They’re no longer eligible to receive delegates and so things shuffle usually toward the nominee (Biden).   On the night of it was Pete 14, Bernie 12, Warren 8, Biden 6, Amy 1.
Both polling and actual results after she dropped showed that Warren supporters were basically split between Bernie/Biden for 2nd choice.  Warren staying in didn’t change a single ST state overall result and only cost Bernie about 10-ish delegates.
“Suspending” and “dropping out” are the same thing.  Bernie not only dropped out he endorsed Biden when he did so, AND he only did so after he was so far back in delegates he had no chance of winning.
Pete won Iowa. Pete and Bernie tied in NH. Biden won SC.  Bernie’s only clear win was NV. He didn’t win the first 3 states.
Every candidate has a different path to victory. Biden’s path was through his support with African Americans. He could lose IA or NH and still have a path forward. Had he lost SC he would have dropped.
Warren supporters were basically split between Bernie/Biden for 2nd choice. And you’re leaving out Bloomberg who hurt Biden WAY more than Warren hurt Bernie.
Pete thought he needed $13 million to compete on ST. He raised only about $6 million.  Meanwhile, Bernie dumped in $25 million.  Pete just couldn’t compete with that. Biden could rely on name recognition but other candidates couldn’t.
Yes, Biden underperformed in IA/NH.  But Biden, via SC, always had a path forward. Pete had gone all in on IA/NH and hoped for a bump to carry him. After Nv and SC it was clear there would be no bump, so he dropped.
YOU do NOT "represent" what "America really is". Women of color are what? 8% of the population? And Biden is an old man in early-stage dementia who's being USED for his name. America will NEVER allow you to be President. #KAG2020TRUMPVICTORY

I shy away for conspiracy angles, but I couldn’t agree more . I feel Obama has his hands, along with many non-politician power brokers from that side, regarding the VP pick . I don’t thing Biden had a damn thing to do with it . Biden is a puppet, and Harris a Manchurian candidate

Absolutely and terrifyingly correct.  So, first and foremost, you need to bludgeon the remaining Nevertrumpers at NR to stop sniping at Trump and fight like hell to reelect him. If Biden wins, Harris will be president before 2021 is over, and the country will be doomed.
We need to focus on the caucus/primary level. Biden won fair and square -- more Dems said "Biden" over the others.  Shoulda picked Bernie if we wanted to actually win. But 2,687/1,073. What can you do?
Also, given the total joke the NYPD became in beating down peaceful protesters and jumping up and down about the faux “poisoning” at Shake Shack the endorsement of any of their unions is even more of a red flag
I believe women, like the Democrats were telling us to do for fifteen years before Biden was nominated.

Blows my mind that you think that a vote for Biden is different from a vote for Trump. Feel free to explain what’s substantively different instead of just making a public performance of your incredulity, if you can.
The DNC needs a marketing strategy to constantly inform Americans what the Democrats have done while in office. This can't just be a process that occurs during election season but has to happen no later than day 2 of the Biden presidency!
Whereas Joe Biden’s response to “how will we hold the primaries on the epidemic” was “why bother holding the rest of the primaries?”
Means plenty.  Just like Joe Biden’s slut-shaming of Paula Jones and Anita Hill means plenty. Just like his fifty-year history of using Black people to scare White Democrats into voting like Republicans means plenty.  You go ahead and vote for the politer of two evils.

The president in the title is Obama. Good read; made me consider that if Biden had run in 2016, he would've beaten Trump.
Yes, Trump, who gives daily briefings speaking directly to the press and people of this nation, is hiding in his bunker. Definitely not Biden, whom no one ever sees. Smh
Tho I agree that Trump could have taken action sooner relative to #COVID, do you really think you &amp; Biden, or matter Hillary Clinton could have kept the death rate to absolute zero? That's not rational or reasonable. So maybe Trump bears some responsibility but not all of it.
Thank God Biden voted to give Trump that power in 2002. Definitely wasn't shortsighted and stupid of him to be in favor of the DHS.
Just another Hiden Biden
America vote Joe Biden this will be everywhere . There will be disbanded police departments than Joe will get and take away guns . This people will next go to the suburbs cause eventually there will be nothing left in the city to loot or burn . Suburban mothers kids won’t be safe
all over the country people can’t express they are voting for  cause of attacks . The polls are wrong guaranteed most republicans or conservatives we don’t do polls and Trump has polled good ever . I’ve been across the country, no Biden signs no where
But as VP she need only wait out the expiry of Biden like Johnson. She will have a 10+ years' tenure. Horrible
Bernie not only got plenty of coverage but his positive:negative ratio was right in line with what Biden got and, historically, what frontrunners get.  The media didn’t sink Bernie.
Rather than making magnanimous and “big tent” noises, he spent the week after NV crapping on the party and praising Castro. It was disasterous (for him). It encouraged the moderates to coalesce and, after SC, that meant rallying to Biden.

omg why has'nt biden droped out of the primary yet he literallt can't win
I get it’s a problem for you, but it isn’t for most voters. That’s the point.  You’re right it’s not a goddamned game. There are real impacts here. So why don’t you stop exaggerating about Biden and start working on getting rid of Trump?
On 1/21/20 the president will either be Biden or Trump.  I’d recommend you figure out which one is closest to your views and vote for that person.  Good luck.
Both polling and results after she did drop show her supporters were basically split between Bernie/Biden for 2nd choice. Her presence in the race didn’t change the result of any ST state and only cost Bernie about 10 delegates.  It didn’t matter.
I know what the “problem areas” are. But on most of it you just misunderstand the history.  Biden’s a mainstream Dem, always has been. And the party is further left than ever, Biden along with it. He’s not as far left as you (or I) want, but he’s certainly not “conservative”.

He’s really not.  Biden’s entire career has been a straight shot down the center of the party, and the party has been (slowly) moving left for decades.  What you’re saying isn’t backed up by reality.
Every candidate has a different path.  Warren has positioned herself as the compromise between Bernie/Biden. She doesn’t know if that’s realistic until she goes a round where it’s basically those 3  Staying in for ST made sense for her. She dropped after ST because it didn’t work
But Warren’s voters were basically evenly split between Bernie/Biden for 2nd choice. If she’d have dropped out before ST it doesnt change the result in any state, and only gains Bernie about 10 delegates.  Her staying in didn’t change anything.
Candidates have different strategies/paths and this different “this isn’t working” points.  Warren has cast herself as the compromise between Bernie/Biden. It made sense for her to stay in one round after it had basically gotten down to those 3, and that means ST.
Biden came in 2nd in Nevada, which considering Bernie’s strength in caucuses isn’t bad.  But Biden didn’t just win SC. He won it in such a dominating fashion as to basically erase Bernie’s delegate lead.
Seems like it’s satirizing Biden as racist and his VP choice a pandering one, both of which are accurate

Debates are basically never a game changer. Few actually watch and those that do are largely partisans who mostly see what they want.  Debates didn’t sink Biden in the primary, they’re not going to in the general.
Ideologically she was between Bernie and Biden. Had the most name recognition aside from those two.  Her plan was to hang around until it was those two and then try to be the compromise. From that perspective it made sense to see how ST went. When it didn’t go well, she dropped.
Black Biden Building Back Blue Better should really be Joe's slogan
I mean, I get you’re not a huge fan of Biden’s. But the voters as a whole do like him. He won over a huge field and it really wasn’t close. And now he’s busy trouncing Trump.  I’m not sure why we’d want to “never let it happen again”.
"Not again" means understanding that Biden and Harris will never allow progressive policy in this country and that anyone who says they can be pushed left is a liar.
Lots of people fought hard for more than a year.  But because of the way delegates are handed out, once you’re behind you’re in trouble. After SC it was pretty clear no one other than Bernie, Biden, and MAYBE Warren had a chance. It was time to get out.
Pete dropped out after SC. At that point:   Bernie had 60 delegates Biden had 54 Pete had 26 Amy had 7  Pete wasn’t leading. He was a distant 3rd, broke, polling below viability in almost every ST state. He dropped because he clearly had no path to victory.
Amy and Pete dropped out after SC. At that point:   Bernie had 60 delegates Biden had 54 Pete had 26 Amy had 7  Pete and Amy dropped out because they had no path to victory (which is what you’re supposed to do). And Biden WAS making a comeback.
Harris was supposed to be an iseological ally to Biden but instead attacked him and didn’t endorse until after ST when he didn’t need it any more.  That’s just politics sometimes.  If Bernie needed Warren’s endorsement to win then they should have treated her better...
Amy and Pete dropped out after SC. At that point:   Bernie had 60 delegates Biden had 54 Pete had 26 Amy had 7  It wasn’t “premature”. Pete was a distant 3rd, broke, polling below viability in almost every ST state. He dropped because he clearly had no path to victory.
Biden got delegates in IA.

Warren’s plan for victory was to present herself as compromise between Biden and Bernie - someone who could appeal to progressives AND the establishment.  It made sense for her to stay in for one round after it had gotten down to (basically) Biden vs Bernie.

I don’t know where you got that.  Biden’s up significantly in every swing state. He’s not only capturing the bulk of independents but - when pushed to decide - he’s getting like 6 of every 7 undecideds.  So much so that states like TX and GA are “swing states”.
On the other hand Biden’s strength was with African American voters - particularly southern African American voters. His plan was to survive until SC, win there, and be the last non-Bernie standing to coalesce behind.  He did just that.
Amy and Pete dropped out after SC. At that point:   Bernie had 60 delegates Biden had 54 Pete had 26 Amy had 7  Pete wasn’t leading. He was a distant 3rd, broke, polling below viability in almost every ST state. He dropped because he clearly had no path to victory.

Dude we’re both voting blue, as I said. If you can’t be critical of the politicians in your party, you are participating in the same tribalism as trump supporters. Im not happy Biden and Harris are the ticket. But yes, I would much rather have them than the current circus.
Amy and Pete dropped out after SC. At that point:   Bernie had 60 delegates Biden had 54 Pete had 26 Amy had 7  Amy and Pete dropped out because they had no path to victory. With a 6 delegate lead and 26% in NH, Bernie was hardly “running away with it”.
And Biden might have “baggage” as far as progressives are concerned, but Biden’s entire career has been a straight shot through the center of the party. That’s why he did so well with voters over 30 and African Americans.  His record wasn’t a problem for most voters.
Don’t get me wrong I’m voting blue, but this ticket is ridiculous and if you think Biden/ Harris are for the people... man. This is a conservative ticket with a Democratic name tag. The DNC is not our friend
Amy and Pete dropped out after SC. At that point:   Bernie had 60 delegates Biden had 54 Pete had 26 Amy had 7  Pete and Amy dropped out because they were broke, behind, and had no path to victory. That’s traditionally what you do when it’s clear you can’t win.

"We need"  You know what we DON'T need? Biden/Harris any more than we need Trump.
So SC became the Hail Mary (that also didn’t work). When he lost SC he dropped out.  At that point, thanks to his incredibly strong support among African Americans - Biden is the only legitimate non-progressive candidate left standing. And the voters coalesce accordingly.

"Truth" can be subjective. How someone selects, sorts and filters data/facts to make something seem true but may not be the truth.  That is why Biden prefers "truth over facts" because the facts would have been filtered and twisted to form his version of truth.
Why do you think we should be silent about their atrocious past records? Should I not criticize Trump for his use of DHS to violate protesters rights? And if I should call that out why shouldn't I call out Biden for voting for the establishment of the DHS?

Candidates typically drop out as soon as it’s clear they can’t win. For the 3rd and 4th place candidates (Biden was a close second at that point) that was after SC.  It was 100% normal behavior. Only Bernie keeps going after the result is clear.
You are wrong Senator!  The 8 years of Obama/Biden were not the longest period of growth.  You’re not stating facts. The 8 years of stagnation were the slowest and lowest 8 year period.  You know this.  But, you are in politics, and won’t let facts stand in your way.  Good luck.

The two top economies in the middle east are signing a peace treaty, this is huge! Thanks Trump!  Countries in the ME know if Biden is elected then Iran will get his support, they will get thrown under the bus again.
Is Saagar out of his mind? I saw his video about how Trump can beat Biden. I don't like Biden. I think he's creepy, and cognitively in decline. I voted for and donated to Bernie. I will vote for ANYONE before I'd vote for Trump, but I'll keep pushing for down ballot progressives.
I'm a progressive, and I have to say that this is yet another election where it's "the lesser of two evils." It sucks.  My question: Will it be easier to promote and implement the changes that you and I both want with Trump or Biden at the helm?
Biden is full of it. Did you call out his nonsense?
Biden to Tara Reade before/during/after penetrating her w/his fingers: "‘I want to f— you,' ‘What the hell, man, I heard you liked me.’ ‘You’re nothing to me. You’re nothing,' 'You’re OK, you’re alright,'”😥 IT'S NOT ALRIGHT!!!😡
The most ridiculous thing is that based on how quickly biden enters the frame on the same track after this monster train, he must actually be going insanely fast.
Hell fkn yes to NOT voting for Biden/Harris.
Two party system. Electoral College. I’m not a millennial, and I’m def not voting Biden/Harris.
They have Biden-Harris Pride shirts up! :D   #BidenHarris2020
This platform is somewhat progressive, and I should and will vote for him. So should everyone else who can vote.   That doesn't change the fact that Biden is not very progressive in terms of where i think the country needs to actually be.
If we aren’t fighting for health care, remind me what specifically is the difference between Biden and Trump?
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
Harris's time as a prosecutor needlessly ruined people's lives, and her perspectives on policing and crime are based in cruelty, "deterrence," and fear. I'm voting for that ticket, but we must address the fundamental cruelty of the "justice" system.
I think knowing this is true and realizing that Biden/Harris aren't going to be some sort of savior for the marginalized community is important while also understanding that Trump needs to go in the meantime.
The Biden campaign is qUiRkY
This is what Biden will look like come November.
The people insisting we can move Biden left after the election will be incredibly silent if/after he wins.
It’s fascinating that we are expected to fall in line and shut up in regards to Biden+Harris. “Better than Trump” shouldn’t be their only way of getting people to vote. They should be held accountable NOW and prove why BIPOC and LGBTQ+ should vote for them.
I agree with your endorsement of Biden/Harris

I don’t support Biden-Harris, but this is good stuff.
Well, the first part (sadly) is correct. Before an announcement of who it was (though most of us knew he'd pick Harris as his yes man), I said the worst part of this election is that we will be saddled with whoever Biden chooses for '24.
Didn't Biden announce only a week or so ago that he wants to increase funding for police?
Well, that'll make me vote for the awful Biden/Harris ticket now.
I dunno I always find it funny when the cry about me not voting for Biden. Then I hit them with the ol "I wouldn't have voted for Bernie either because I live in a red state."
Answer to Will Biden hang Obama and Trump’s portrait? by Richard Flynn
This is utter racist BS; and I am someone who would love for there to be a legitimate reason to remove Harris (and Biden) from the ticket.
Biden people didnt do it... someone bought the domain name  and then redirected it to the biden site.  This can be done without Biden people even knowing but once they found out they could block it.

Excellent as usual. Also, as I said weeks ago, I've gone to a dark place hoping Biden doesn't make it to November because I cannot vote for this ticket and I am done with Dems at the federal level at any rate. I'm not young and this is the worst Dem ticket in my adult life.
You mean the next president of the United States Joe Biden not grandpa, right?😉
What's shameful is that going up against the worst incumbent in history, the Dems chose Biden and then making matters worse he selected Harris for VP. Unconscionable. Your privilege is showing, George.

Let’s be real here. Biden is 77 years old. We all know what her being picked for VP means and how important it was.   She more than likely will be the first woman President, whether by happenstance or running in 2024. Biden has said he’s going to be the “transitional” President.

Too bad she's an unprincipled hack who admitted she only called Biden a segregationist because "it was a debate" and not because she actually meant it.
Biden/Harris take: Dems show people with differences can work together and respect each other. Trumps response shows he only takes yes men/women and he is quick to insult others but cannot take criticism of himself.

Bernie tried to crush Biden. Biden tried to crush Bernie. That’s what campaigns are.  It’s not somehow underhanded or unfair that people are trying to win elections.
It can’t pass! It can’t pass because you can’t answer basic questions like “how do you pay for it”!  You need 60 votes in the Senate. You’ve got like 25. After a blue wave, maybe like 30.  You don’t have the votes. Biden should concentrate on real things not fantasies.
Yes, but another thing that is different is that Biden is the nominee and he is horrid. Their positions are a slap in the face to both progressives in general and Blacks in particular. Will those groups still come out to support them? We'll see. #DownBallot
It’s funny you forget that trump was bffs w Epstein 🥴🥴 also I don’t like Biden!! So maybe next time get your facts straight!!
Again, show me the video of Pete supporters harassing election officials at home and I’ll concede the point. Show me Biden supporters booing Warren. Show me the pages of rat/snake emojis from Beto. Show me where Gilibrand doxxed critics.  Bernie’s campaign was uniquely toxic.
The Debate isn’t about the two candidates and what they want, it’s for the American people so we can here them speak to the issues.  Biden doesn’t debate its confirmation of his cognitive issues.
I mean, it sure seems more measured than The Economist's 91% Biden. Folks need to be willing to read a bit more, but I supposed that's what got us in trouble in the first place?
Has Biden given me good reasons to support him?  Why is it my responsibility? He's the one running. Spend all the money making good policy proposals and marketing them to the people.
I am not entirely happy with her or Biden in general but...but I am putting aside my  gripes until there is a better day to fight. Now is not the time to fight. The day is coming after the elections. Then drive them to make the changes you want to see. Now is not the time.
Some people (AOC, Tlaib, Omar, etc...) tried to help elect Bernie. Some tried to help Warren. Some tried to help Biden. Some tried to help Pete.  That’s a campaign, not a conspiracy.
Hey Trump, look at the stock markets reaction to the Biden Harris ticket!

Biden being racist doesn't mean that Trump isn't racist either?? You literally can't support BLM and vote for Trump
She just got a Netflix special. The lack of any standard in broadcasting has been a detriment to a functioning society. All the reality TV BS and, yes, Sarah Cooper's schtick ... meh. Satisfaction with mediocrity in this also translates directly to acceptance of Biden/Harris too.
That's not why we can't elect progressives. Are you going to vote for Biden/Harris in November? If the answer is yes you've found out why we can't elect progressives. Until we withhold our votes for centrist hacks that's all we'll continue to get. #DownBallot
Biden is a pedophile, Trump is too. That's why I don't support either, because I have morals.
Plenty of reasons to hate Biden and Harris, but there are just as many equally valid reasons to hate Trump. You just can't vote with a good conscience in the US. After the pandemic response and the response to protests, I can't even fathom voting Trump though.
So neither Biden nor Trump then lol
Fundamentally I don’t want to live in an America post four more years of trump. I KNOW this. do I want to live in America after four years of Biden? I don’t know. But I want to avoid the other possiblity so hard that I’m unfortunately willing to eat some shit.
There's folks on my twitter feed who are just really pissy about the DNC and Biden and Harris.  I get not being happy with your 4th choice or whatever, but at THIS stage of the game, we should be focusing on beating Trump.  Nothing else matters if he steals this election. Nothing

I wasn’t happy with Biden, so no.
Every candidate gets negative coverage. Especially front runners.  That’s not something only Bernie faced. Biden’s coverage had basically the same positive/negative ratio.
It wasn’t sabotage when AOC, Tlaib, and Omar endorsed, raised money for, and campaigned for Bernie in October.  It wasn’t sabotage when other Dems did the same for Biden.  That’s how elections work; people try to elect their preferred candidates.
I already knew I wasn’t voting for Biden. Harris doesn’t change that. I’ll be leaving my ballot blank in regards to POTUS. When the electoral college is gone, maybe then I won’t. Fk this two party system.
Some people tried to make the case that Bernie was unelectable. Some people tried to make the case that Biden was unelectable. Some people tried to make the case that Warren was unelectable. Etc...  Every candidate faces criticism. Only in BernWorld is it a conspiracy.

By 11/3/2020 he’ll still pull the lever for Biden/Harris. It’s about careerism not ideology.
Lol bruh this shits in your face... endorsing biden and harris... hillary all over again yall dipshits say “anybody but trump” WAKE THE FUCK UP or yall will be enslaved bu these satanic fucks
That's one hell of a dynamic duo they got there. Biden can make crime legislation that targets black Americans, and Harris will lock em up! Minority voters need to dump their abusive boyfriend, the DNC.  Stop letting them exploit you.
I’m voting biden only because I want trump out of office. Bernie would be my ideal candidate but it’s 2020 the year of being shit on so.
There is some delegate shuffling at state conventions months after candidates drop out. But, no, Biden’s lead after 3/17 is before any of that happend. He had an insurmountable lead from delegates he’d earned.
Lots of primary to go after SC and still anyone’s game.  But after ST, and 3/10, and 3/17 less than half the primary was left and Biden had an insurmountable lead.  It was clearly over.
Kamala is a cop. Pete is a rat. Warren is a snake. Beto is in the pocket of Big Oil. Biden is a rapist with dementia. All of that came out of Bernie’s campaign.  Sure... Bernie never attacked anyone. Uh huh.
I bet $50 that Biden drops out and hands it over to Harris. The ploy to not have debates won’t get support. They’d rather have Harris debate Trump than keep up this farce that Biden isn’t senile.
It wasn’t “interference” when Tlaib, AOC, and Omar endorsed Bernie in October. It wasn’t “interference” when other Dems endorsed Biden in Feb.  People advocated and voted for who they wanted, it wasn’t Bernie.  And Bernie had clearly already lost pre-pandemic.
Kamala was also really nasty to Joe Biden during the debates but they got over that shit because being tenacious and informed turned out to be positive qualities and we have an authoritarian to oust.
Super Tuesday was the last point the primary was even remotely competative. After that it was just a Biden landslide.  If Bernie was going to win he had to do it on ST. He didn’t.
Biden picking Harris is more evidence he’s not in control of his own campaign. I doubt he ever was. He is a means to an end of bypassing democratic institutions while ensuring most people feel like their vote was counted
As I recall, Biden took some hard swings at Barack Obama in the debates. Obama chose him as a veep. Team of Rivals playbook.
Call me a racist if you want, but after the corruption of the first black democrat president, there is no way I’m going to vote for the second.   (because Biden is nothing but a placeholder for who the real president will be)
Don't you want to see Biden wipe the floor with Trump?Siding with Biden!
Really?? How quickly you forget your tantrums the democrats had over hanging chads in Florida. Truth is Biden and heels up don’t have a hope in hell of winning without the help of ballot harvesting and mail in bs. Even then if they lose it gives you democrats a convenient excuse
Oh I see this coming biden is found unfit heals up becomes the president she needs a new vice president she brings Hillary onboard Heals up all of a sudden dies of a mysterious illness Clinton becomes president oh my god somebody pinch me and hit me in the head!

Hate to tell ya but Russia would prefer Biden as well. All it takes is just a little brains and keeping up on politics to figure it out.
There's a bit of a message inherent in two old white men who both enjoy incredible power and privilege arguing over who owns the black vote
You past it because of Joe Biden. Don’t lieAs this columnist did, reading "What It Takes" is essential reading about American politics and it is revealing about Biden ... Learning to Love Joe Biden
Again, my reply was based on the poll you gave me. You can dig up new polls all you want, but my reply was base on your original poll.  Again, my main point is that a Biden win is not in the bag. To promote such a thing would lead to complacency, to Dems not bothering to vote.
My math was still based on polls you gave me, third party/lack of it was already factored in. Even though Clinton had a disadvantage  that Biden doesn't have  polls Clinton lead was noise margin from  Biden's lead. My main point is that lots can happen, Trump could still win.
Doesn't the Biden 51.0 already have that ~8.8% missing third party vote already rolled in?  If there were a third party at 8.8% this time around then Biden would be at 42.2.  Clinton would have had ~52.4 if no third party.
What you posted (+8.6) and (+6.5) are less than 3 (noise) apart.  August 15, 2020 #Biden: 51.0% (+8.6) Trump:  42.4%  August 20, 2016 Clinton: 43.6% (+6.5) Trump:  37.1% Johnson: 8.8%❗
I get that part. But HOWEVER Biden is not the answer not even close. And Harris her self is a fraud. Trump is going to win again SOLELY on who he ya to compete with. Biden will be dead in a year or two with his degenerative health
Positive polls kept some Dems from voting in 2016.  The lead difference between Biden and Clinton is within noise margin.  Call me paranoid but I'm sure Trump/GOP has an effective October surprise in the chamber.
Don't let any Biden/Harris polls lull you into complacency. That is what happened in 2016.  Go Vote!
Wow this muslim calls the Abraham Accord historic and is the exact opposite of what Obama did by strengthening the Iran terrorists.   “This is the end of the Arab boycott of Israel.”
Att America it’s simple vote Biden this will become all of America.  is the only thing that will restore and keep law and order and prosperity love him or hate him he’s the only one . The democrats = chaos , high taxes , no police , no suburbs no freedom.
wants to tax you if you decide to leave California cause the democrats want to take your police away keep raising taxes , keep you shut down . People of California you need to shut this down . This will be what Joe Biden will do as president. This is completely illegl
If he gets any traction  then 'they' can say he is a Biden/Harris vote siphon.
America vote Joe Biden this will be everywhere . There will be disbanded police departments than Joe will get and take away guns . This people will next go to the suburbs cause eventually there will be nothing left in the city to loot or burn . Suburban mothers kids won’t be safe
all over the country people can’t express they are voting for  cause of attacks . The polls are wrong guaranteed most republicans or conservatives we don’t do polls and Trump has polled good ever . I’ve been across the country, no Biden signs no where
My promise: if my area does start mass mailing ballots, I’m going to gather as many as possible and send them all back for Trump.   No one will ever know I frauded Biden and I’m ok with that! Whatever it takes!
omg why has'nt biden droped out of the primary yet he literallt can't win
Let's see Trump try to match Biden in a "weakness" contest with 3 phases  1. Ramp Walking 2. Drinking Glass of Water with ONE hand 3. Closing Umbrella and Walking Through Door ANY WHERE, ANY TIME
Leftists: defund the police  Biden: okay, let’s give them more money  Leftists: no, that’s exactly opposite of what we want  Biden: okay, so, choose a cop and prosecutor as my VP pick?
can you please tell AG Barr that we deserve to know before the election the results of the Durham investigation, the democrat nominee was in the administration who did the spying and knew . People shouldn’t be voting not knowing Biden’s Role and what cabinet where .
Biden isn’t senile. His speech yesterday was amazing. He makes more sense than the so called president ever does. Who’s bragged about passing a cognitive test?   Man, woman, person, camera, tv. Trump aced that shit! So impressive!   Biden/Harris 2020
Biden’s list sounds so fun I wish he had a spine and actually stood for any of it 😔
You have already collapsed it  Biden-Harris is our ticket out of the hell you have created.  Now if you can STOP CHEATING by trying to dismantle our USPS you will witness it for yourself. Remember karma is a bitch!
Bullshit lying Biden Harris are both moderates.
Now that Trump has brokered the ME peace plan, after nearly 30 years of failure from dc types, the dc types want to push Trump aside so that they can “fix it”. #forgetaboutit   And it’s funny that the news broke on Joe Biden’s big day lol.
Too bad Biden and Harris refuse to answer these questions from the media.
The two top economies in the middle east are signing a peace treaty, this is huge! Thanks Trump!  Countries in the ME know if Biden is elected then Iran will get his support, they will get thrown under the bus again.

Kanye's endeavor is just a vote siphon from Biden/Harris base.
Let’s be real here. Biden is 77 years old. We all know what her being picked for VP means and how important it was.   She more than likely will be the first woman President, whether by happenstance or running in 2024. Biden has said he’s going to be the “transitional” President.
With Biden/Harris dominating the headlines, Trump must be working up to some spectacular twitter tirades.
TYT’s reaction to: Joe Biden Announces Vice President Pick, Senator Kamala Harris  via
So crazy that Biden is the nominee... 🤪😷🤪😷. Seriously the world has gone mad.
“Progressives” who aren’t voting for Biden be like: “I’m gonna personally murder 7 civilians to really teach the Democratic establishment a lesson.”
That's one hell of a dynamic duo they got there. Biden can make crime legislation that targets black Americans, and Harris will lock em up! Minority voters need to dump their abusive boyfriend, the DNC.  Stop letting them exploit you.
Call me a racist if you want, but after the corruption of the first black democrat president, there is no way I’m going to vote for the second.   (because Biden is nothing but a placeholder for who the real president will be)
Vote Blue no matter who people don’t get to complain when Biden inevitably starts saying and doing racist shit when he hypothetically is in office. We’ve been telling you that since day fucking one. But you refused to listen and fucked everyone over.
The democratic party doesn't believe that. They never have. After all, if a black person doesn't vote for Joe Biden and his non-black VP well, in his own words, "You ain't black!".
Good luck with that Harris character...she is a liability to anyone...actually I'm glad Biden chose her...she'll drag the ticket down and that is good...now---celebrate democrats...
Because Democrats wanted Joe Biden as the nominee? And just because Harris wasn’t doesn’t mean she won’t make a great VP.   See? Fucking stupid question.   You guys got nothing. It so funny 😆
All my black American Brothers and sisters I suggest you look and read the congressional records from 1974 , Joe Biden easy and purely is a racist . Trust me read them than today’s remarks come into View perfectly. “ You ain’t black unless you vote for me “ Joes heart is racist.
Women will vote just be Because she is a women. How shallow you are to think women just vote and don’t use intelligence to pick their candidate.  I will not vote for either Biden or Kamala. #Trump2020!
Good example of socialism, vote joe Biden in the country will be Portland
We had Bush hand over the Great Recession to Obama. Should Biden win, he would be handed an even worse situation. Given the trend, how can we reasonably hand the Presidency over to the GOP anytime soon?
Biden wins in November, he either dies or resigns bc dementia, and she becomes our first woman president
I just had a Biden volunteer call me to ask me if I was voting for them in the fall and she mispronounced her name :( I poiltely corrected her but we need to make this mainstream
Who cares.   It’s Trump/Pence or Biden/Harris. Tell her to choose wisely.
In the same hall where I saw Biden speak last year. Can’t wait to watch this!
Well put Brit. I do believe it was time for a man just like President Trump. Our Nation was a Patsy for China, our Allies, including NATO. Some of our Politicians, such Biden, Clinton etc we’re benefiting from our Largess with others.
And finally.... After that, Biden gets accused of sexual assault, so he vows to choose a woman as his VP.  And now, Sleepy Joe announces Phony Kamala as his running mate.
First, Kamala Harris attacked Joe Biden’s racist policies (did she forget?). Next, she ends her pathetic run at President. Then, 3 months after ending her own campaign, she reluctantly endorses Biden.
Kamala Harris was the perfect pic for joe Biden, love it
People accusing me of being “Pro-Trump” because I shared a meme stating that both Trump and Biden are pedophiles says it all really.
I’d like to be there with  and the other LDS Biden supporters!
In 2008 Obama had zero foreign relations experience. Put Harris on the ticket for VP as the more ticket-friendly option, and Rice as SOS after Biden is elected. Done.
And nobody would need to. With Rice it's Game over. Knowing what I was getting with Biden (a trainwreck, but no worse than Trump) as an independent I was holding out for Biden's pick.  With Rice I was out.  With Harris, I'm in.  I'm now in.
Great choice Joe.
Even we independents see Rice as the original Benghazi liar-face. Some GOP said they wanted her ... BECAUSE she was unwinnable. Were you even around in Nov 2016? Remember what happened? Don't get cocky when Biden's numbers are up. You need us.

How could Biden have cut social security? He was just a Senator?
Lol - and Biden is going to win easy too, dems have no worries!  But in fact this election is going to be the most lopsided ever, way bigger than the last one. The democrats are going to lose the House too.
No voter suppression, everyone should speak and run.  I am just speculating on the effect on  Biden voting base   and  Trump voting base, and  effect on election if Jo Jo gets some real traction.  I seriously doubt if she is going to  pull much from the  conservative Trump base.
Sure,  #LetHerSpeak   but the biggest influence of Jo Jo will be a vote siphon from the Biden base.  This effectively is a pro-Trump endeavor.

Joe Biden is a racist #Trump2020
Option 1: Joe Biden is senile and old so we can forgive his overt racism but he’s absolutely not fit to be president. Option 2: Joe Biden is not senile and completely fit to be president, but he’s ridiculously and overtly racist and dems don’t give a shit.  Pick.
Because not wanting Biden to have access to the concentrated power exercised by Trump is not a good enough reason to leave Trump in charge.

Very strange! I wake up every morning with this sick feeling like something is going on and then I remember. Trump wants us to die, he doesn’t want us to vote, he’s a traitor and the president. I am sad but hopeful because soon Trump will stop hurting us. Ridin’ with Biden 2020!

If you believe Jo Biden I have some land to sell you cheap!
You need to watch something other that Fox News.  Joe Biden is Catholic.
Stay the course. Harris helps ensure large voting blocks go with Biden. If the goal is to rid ourselves of Trump, a powerful voting block on the other side is needed.  A stanch progressive one heart beat away still doesn't scare me as much as Trump.
So while I must agree with, Ms Harris is a great woman, COLOR does not effing matter, but one thing, a helluva hypocrite!!! How can she forget all the truths she said about Biden during the debates, throw them under the rug, SERIOUS character flaws we are talking, take weeks
I don’t think Biden will have the same taste as trump. It should definitely wait a couple years. Bad timing. People losing homes and trump wants to remodel a place he won’t be living. Stupid

And if you believe the democratic party with Biden and Harris are going to fix the corruption, you are fooling yourself.
I wouldn't be surprised if Idaho does. I expect both Trump and Biden to improve on the Trump/Clinton numbers. (The third party vote was about 13% in 2016.) If I had to guess Trump gets more of that 13% than Biden.

Bumbling Joe Biden can't do that, even though she really isn't black (she's half Indian and half Jamaican). He needs a black running mate, so that makes her black enough for his purposes. She's black enough to pass.
Joe Biden is an excommunicated Catholic. Just putting that out there. He and Trump have both put ideology over the Divine.
I’ve been told that my vote for  is a vote for Trump. I’ve also been told it’s a vote for Biden.   Guess I’m voting for 3 people this election.
That’s not all I’m interested in but the Dems and Republicans are fighting over them as if they aren’t people.  Not to mention Biden even said if you’re black and don’t vote for him, you’re not black.
And if they manage to do so, I have no faith that anything will change.  Why?  Because Biden pretty much said so.
Can't wait to see Biden's expression when he finds out Kamala is his VP pick!
Dumb.. she’s a hypocrite. For sure now I’m not voting for Biden. What she did as a prosecutor in Cali is despicable. Check out Katie. I respect you and your ethics👍🏻
There are a couple nuggets of truth in this that are pretty devastating: the fact that Harris owned Biden in that debate ("I was that girl") and the fact that she didn't dare stay in the race because she knew she'd get shellacked in her home state by Bernie
Yeah.... Between Biden/Cop Kamala and the Great Orange Cheeto, definitely voting third party... We've got #batmaam. #JoJorgensen2020

corruption of the DNC, and going along with the Joe McCarthyism, they would have at least let you join in on their lobbyist bought convention with gropey Joe dementia Biden.  But I guess not.
Most likely scenario is Biden is shaping up his cabinet (perhaps prematurely), offering Mayo Pete SecDef or SecState.

For sure! I’m right there with you. Though, I think Harris will turn out to be a good choice. Originally early on, I thought Biden would go for Klobuchar which KH is a way better choice than her at least. 😂
Honestly, I think it came down to a lot of factors such as experience, age, and political leanings. Biden gets hit on a lot about his age and so getting someone who is subtantially younger was key.
It's going to be up to us to keep our foot on the gas pedal. It's going to be up to us to make sure that Biden / Harris is the bridge to a better world. We must be more active now than ever before. #1u #UnionStrong

Kamala Harris???? It’s like Biden is trying to lose
Joe Biden is actually physically fit compared to the walrus we have in the White House now and they're pretty close in age which is pretty sad I mean I've heard of brown nosing but at this point they can probably feel his heartbeat with their nose hairs
This is an attempt to obfuscate the tactic Trump had to use to help American workers despite dem refusal to give up wish list in Heroes Act.

Something Stelter will never ask:  Why did you say Biden colluded with racists to achieve racist goals and then lauded racists for their racist achievements?
Why don’t we have daily Biden press conferences so we can see these kind of tweets about him.  Well, not from you LOLs or other CNN, but from others.
Biden's team of 13 sound engineers tasked with piecing together random words uttered by Biden and forming real sentences with them for campaign ads is reportedly concerned for their jobs after hearing the possibility they may not be needed anymore.
Harris not asked about saying Biden colluded with racists to achieve racist goals and lauded their racist work.  Not asked about giving Biden a chance to apologize or his refusal to do so.
I'm still so mad I didn't get to vote for her. I cannot believe there are people who voted for Biden over her 😠

I’m officially declaring the debates as the roast of Joe Biden. I’ll have the fire dept on standby cause Trump’s gonna torch that ass.  #Trump2020
Biden’s VP choice was based on immutable characteristics of sex and race, and the lowest level of expediency. Unfortunately, I worry such decision-criteria would characterize his Presidency. More identity politics is the last thing America needs in 2020.
Chameleon Kamala will change her previous views at the drop of a hat, if it means moving forward into the limelight, where she can throw her weight around and snap her fingers at her underlings.  She will definitely be wearing the pants in her relationship with Sleepy Joe Biden.
She made him cry! 🤣 I will be voting Biden/Harris! Blue wave!!
So, Biden is in... good physical shape?
I hope Biden will restore it with Cory Booker in charge. That would please this suburban woman immensely.
Kamala Harris did not call Biden a racist.  She said he colluded with racists to achieve racist goals.
Biden and Harris have no chemistry, because they come from different planets.  If they win, they will suck all of us into an unimaginable black hole!

Drinking game. Drink a shot every time Biden completes a sentence.
I just wonder if Harris still believes Tara Reid, or still thinks Biden is a racist?
Today President Trump referred to an executive order as an executive "offer".  That is, he replaced the "rd" in "order" with "ff" and said "executive o[FF]er"  Today Kamala Harris was named Biden's VP.  Searched qmap for "Harris" and found this 👇  (see next two tweets - 1/3)
Biden picked Harris because she aint black, man
Joe Biden can't speak a coherent sentence. He's embroiled in two massive scandals. But, in the words of your chief mob boss, "What difference does it make?"
She literally destroyed Biden in the debates and called him out for the racist he is. Great chemistry.
just biden time until taking the throne
Let's get this party started! Harris becomes the first Black woman to run for vice president alongside Biden, the presumptive Democratic candidate.
Biden is racist 🙄
It's not possible to think Biden is competent.   The mind can only stretch so far. 🙂
I wish fox and everyone would stop saying that Biden is trying to decide something!   Biden can’t decide what color socks he wants in the morning let alone anything else important for this country!
Why do all of the Talking Heads say Biden is trying to decide on things? Biden hadn’t made a decision in years!  Every decision made is from people around him, he’s not capable of picking out his own breakfast let alone the Vice President!
It's the great transition from everything being racist to everything being sexist the moment Biden chooses his running mate.
Remember when Sarah Palin had to shill for McCain (the economy is strong)...  Imagine someone/anyone trying to shill for Biden.   His wife is the only one with enough to gain by it. 🙂

I think that Trump will be sent to jail by NY. They have signaled they are investigating. Consider how many of his crimes break NY and Fed law and happened in NY. NY can try/incarcerate Trump without weighing down the Biden AG and DOJ.
Who do you think Joe Biden will pick as running mate?
The idea that Media are tearing down Joe Biden and that nothing equivalent is happening to Donald Trump is a blind and baffling assertion!!  All of Mainstream Media lies about and attempts to undermine the Presidency of Donald Trump every single day.
Biden goes back and forth more then a yo-yo , the only difference is when Trumps messes up the media pounces on it and when Biden does they either bury it or avoid it all together.
Never knew North Carolina polls turning against Biden toward Trump would actually cause an earthquake.
do they think theyre actually HELPING biden with this?
I think this is more closer to correct than not. More and more I get the feeling that Biden is just a stand-in for the next Uber-progressive president, who will slide in there when Biden is carted off to the nursing home basement for the final goodbye.
The problem for the Democrats this fall is that activities in Portland auger for the same activities on a more widespread basis if a Biden presidency comes to fruition.   We’ve got to keep the Democrats OUT! Their philosophy is death and destruction. Biden can’t escape the truth.
No you wanna scratch the debates cause we both know Biden can’t string together a coherent sentence.
National Archives would have her complaint, why can't that be released, if with Biden wanting it
Yeah Joe Biden why haven’t you called for assistance from the Democrats out loud and in public. Write it down for so you don’t screw it up
If Biden wasn't a shitty candidate, he wouldn't be having such a hard time at getting people to support him. And yet, that's what's going on
No he isn't LMFAO what's so wrong with wanting Biden to actually earn his votes? Really? What's wrong with a politician earning the votes they get?
If you don't see the blatant equivalencies between Biden and Trump, you need to get your head out of your ass, wipe the shit off your face and see the world how it really is, not some delusional 'democrats will solve everything' nonsense when they played into this, enabling trump
No it's not, Biden is actually why we have Trump, he helped pave the way
I don't support Biden 😂 and no you can't because Donald Trump is a racist lmao
'the black American I know' lmao they have every right to be upset with what Biden said, but don't think Trump isn't racist and that they don't see it, too.
I think Joe Biden owes quite a few un-notable and notable exceptions a reparations beer.😆
