Biden cannot fight for Latino's, Black's have BLM not the 'African American Community‚Äô, BLM &amp; Antifa are terrorists so why is it Biden can accept money from them for his campaign, while the 'African American Community‚Äô does not believe in Antifa so why should Biden?
It‚Äôs clear Biden DID NOT write this tweet!! It is too cohesive.

The elevator isn't going to the top floor. He use to be articulate and stupid. Now he is just cognitively impaired. The Democrat media is magnifying the COVID-19 and white Antifa riots because of an inability to select a competitive Presidential candidate. Biden, Pelosi, Schumer?
Leave it to A$$ kissing  to pretend they  that Mr. Trump can actually read from a teleprompter or paper directly in front of him. I have it on good authority that Biden knows there‚Äôs no ‚Äúthigh‚Äù in Thailand or that Yosemite is not Yo-suh-mite

Joe Biden is an iron chariot in a suit
How would he contribute, ANTIFA &amp; BLM to Public Office under Biden?
Latino's vs African American's according to Joe are of different values while Black's strive for change in America more than Latino's that are willing to accept the values in America except those of Black's. Joe knows for certain neither are the same. Biden is worse than Trump.
Biden is a total embarrassment. Own up to your mistake and fix it before it's too late.

I don‚Äôt care what they say about Biden, he gets my VOTE regardless. They‚Äôre all liars, so anyone believing anything coming out that corrupt con camp is as stupid as they are!
Biden don't know where Biden is.
Can Joe Biden hurt God? Your boy seems to think so.
will it really take a debate for the other 1/2 of america to realize biden's a bumbling baffoon
One day, a President who understands deep and abiding faith will live in the White House again.
Trump thinks Biden can hurt God. Nobody can hurt God, mr trump.
Lmfao somebody just replied to me saying I was "reaching" and that Biden isn't a racist... yikes
Eveybody that's saying Biden should just "shut up" is right if they want him to win.  What I don't get is why you want a blatant racist to hide his racism until after he's elected or to even elect him at all.   But that's just me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
And most of these minimum sentences were set during the Clinton administration with Biden as a senator.  Trump is pushing for justice reform.  Think about that.
Biden is a racist. He is the nominee of the political party which historically represented the racist tradition in America.

Jill Biden sure is trying hard to cover for Joe Biden  A Herculean task!!
Biden isn't going to succumb to pressure from working people. And, FDR wouldn't have done so if he hadn't agreed with those policies in the first place. But, if it makes you feel better to think that, go ahead.

I suppose you think we should vote for Biden instead. Is that right?
Is that a Biden Test Answer?
Well there you go, Biden may as well throw in the towel now.
Is this the behavior of someone who is "morally superior" to Trump? Especially asking my "conservative" friends who can't bring themselves to vote for Trump and say Biden is so "decent." Disgusting. He will say and do anything to become President (including sell out to far left).

This is really interesting. The Lincoln Project are Republicans against Trump. I bet Biden likes these guys.
Voting for a person doesn't make you a racist. Open your eyes people.  ALL of these riots have been funded AND instigated by the leftists. If you think for one minute that Joe Biden is the best candidate to run this country,  then you are blinded by what is REALLY going on.

I don't care about who Biden picks, but that is the worst pair of glasses I have ever seen.

Biden can't pick his nose without directions to it's location! He would have to ask Jill, Hunter, Nancy, Chuck, Barry and the DNC whom he is allowed to ask to be his VP!
If Trump comes up with a lot of asinine rules, he probably will be ignored by the outlet. Plus Biden won't bother debating with him. Which will hurt Trump more, given today's polling.

I'm on social security. My husband is also. We've both paid in for decades and we're finally reaping our benefits. Biden has vowed to cut it his entire career.  Trump, however, has had 4 years to cut it and didn't do it. Something to think about.
I know. I just hate Biden as a candidate. Felt the same about Clinton. It‚Äôs starting to feel like they are taking our votes for granted.
Anyone but Kamala. I already hate Biden as the democratic candidate. Add Harris and I just can‚Äôt force myself to do it.

I've been saying for months that Biden will be dumped at some point--either at the convention or perhaps after he's elected he will resign, or end up being a puppet president like Reagan was.  And whoever has their hands up his chute will likely make policies like Reagan too.

Yeah...this whole NRA thing...that's awesome and all...but if I'm the Biden camp right now...I'm a little "WTF?" about the timing of this. I get that folks in NY/Cali and what not don't get this...but as someone living in the South...this won't play well...
That's all good and well...and I 100% agree...but if I'm the Biden camp right now...I'm a little bit, "what in the fuck are you doing!?"
To tell people that their children are basically immune from this virus is reckless when there are 240,000 children who have been infected in the US alone. He wants to cut Social Security that we worked for. That's not caring for the people. Biden isn't perfect. All politicians
He and DiBlasio have an unexplained sickness, to be determined by psychologists. God already kmowsüôèüèª Btw, they can get in line behind Biden, Pelosi, Nadler, Schumer, Schiff &amp; at least 3/4 of the other Dems.
Yes, what does Dr. Biden hold grudges ?
This should be a non story. He doesn't have time to get ballot access and unless his poll numbers are through the roof he will never get near a debate stage. This isn't about Biden or Trump, its a means to silence 3rd party candidates.
can you guys decipher exactly what Joe Biden is talking about? #DementiaJoe
25 million dollars more than Biden
Well, no. It's stupid for Biden to say this, but it's not by definition racist. A comment on culture is not necessarily a comment on inherent characteristics. Nor is it necessarily a judgment of what is good or bad.
The spice of life. Spice IS life.  This is why Joe Biden urges all Americans to reclaim their thyme.
President Joseph Biden...
I already know I‚Äôm voting for Biden, I don‚Äôt need to see any debates
Tune in to  every Thursday morning from 8:00 - 8:30 for a lively discussion with Sean and Dalton. Today, we'll discuss presidential nominee Biden's VP pick, Senator Jones vs Tuberville poll, &amp; school reopenings. Stream live:  THE SHOW
I‚Äôm wondering if  even accepted Trump as his president yet..  If Biden wins it will be because mail fraud.   I don‚Äôt see very much Trump support but I haven‚Äôt seen anything supporting Biden.
According to Biden you must be black to vote for him.
For those who consider 2nd Amendment rights important, the Libertarian Party platform opposes all government restriction or monitoring of firearm ownership.   Candidate Biden has declared Beto O'Rourke will be in charge of gun control. Beto vowed he will take guns from citizens.
Looking for a bumper sticker that says, ‚ÄúWHO‚ÄôS HIDIN‚Äô BIDEN? C‚ÄôMON, MAN!‚Äù
He won and y‚Äôall just can forget about it. Real funny you said he has to have help. Biden literally had to be given the nomination by the Dems to beat Bernie and the other candidates
I am a #LincolnVoter . Campaigned for W, voted straight ticket till '16. I couldn't stand Trump for the way he treated women, the disabled, and POC. And the nationalism. It isn't an American dream if we exclude everyone. It's a nightmare. I'll be voting Biden &amp; blue.
I think Kanye West is running for President so he can "split the vote" between Trump &amp; Biden. And why did Kanye West take the $5,000,000 PPE loan from Trump? People please don't fall for this! #KanyeWest #Kanye2020 #TrumpThreatensAmerica #Trump #MSNBC #Democrats #WednesdayWisdom
Joe Biden is a puppet. His handlers aren't moderates.
1)Biden is not Bernie; 2)‚Äúmost progressive‚Äù is relative and mere puffery meant to appease Bernie‚Äôs base; 3)‚Äúworking with‚Äù during an election doesn‚Äôt mean it continues afterwards; 4)he dropped the crazier/socialist aspects; 5)it‚Äôs ‚Äúonly‚Äù $2T, the same as Trump‚Äôs tax cuts
Wow Biden is on your list of Republicans?
This is why all of us need to vote for Joe Biden in huge overwhelming numbers.
"...remove Donald Trump and consign those who supported him in the Senate to the trash heap of history.‚Äù Rice said Biden was someone who could ‚Äúheal and unify the nation.‚Äù Wow. Contradiction much. 'Unify' to socialism. We won't heal nor join in.
First, let‚Äôs be clear -Biden is not a socialist- he‚Äôs just not, as evidenced by his record over 40+ years. Second, the last 4 years prove Trump being ‚Äújust a little more Republican than Biden‚Äù hasn‚Äôt helped the debt &amp; deficit, but it sure helped devastate the country. No thanks.
"C'mon Man"...Joe Biden doesn't make any sense...
Should have been prepared for that very question...poor handling by his "people". That and a bad VP pick will have many running for the borders after November.  Canada, etc. are rooting for Biden to do well.
Fact check: Biden says he hasn't taken a cognitive test. Is he flip-flopping?
BREAKING: Former Vice President Joe Biden cannot remember Wisconsin or the DNC Convention.... What are ya, a Junkie? C'mon, man.
1830456Joe Biden explains why he hasn‚Äôt taken a cognitive test by asking a Black journo if he‚Äôs a junkie
Do you know who hardly remembers his own name or where he is? Joe Biden.. your blind hatred is sad
Who said anything about Biden choosing a Republican?
Biden won't go to Milwaukee to accept Democratic nomination
Joe Biden won't travel to Milwaukee to accept Democratic nomination, will accept virtually from Delaware
In this case, the base WILL turn out, because it hates Trump so much. But the moderates on the fence are the ones whose choices are down to two: Vote Biden, or stay home. Biden cannot afford to scare them; if he does, they will stay home, and he will lose.
I really don't understand how Biden and the Dems can be so stupid as to look only leftward for a Veep
Biden insists there are no mental defects causing his gaffes &amp; instability.  You get what you vote for in the election. Take a good look at his career in politics.  #swamp
Joe Biden Just Asked a Black Reporter if He Does Cocaine. No, Really.
And it will also somehow be Obama's fault, connected to Hunter Biden, and the responsibility of Democrat governors.
Yoda Biden. Lol
Greenfield +3, Biden-Trump Tied
Look, I hate Biden and shitlibs as much as the next guy, but Biden isn‚Äôt spewing fascistic shit like trump. You don‚Äôt have to vote for Biden, I get it, I was of the same opinion until coronavirus cases started skyrocketing back up and trump sent in federal troops to stop protests
The only thing holding up Joe Biden's VP pick is he can't determine which woman passes the smell test.
Think about what all Trump did to turn America around before the virus and only Trump can do it again. Not Biden!
I can only hope! Nightmare if Biden gets elected and steps down. VP now president and Nancy Pelosi is VP. Horrible for country!
Biden gets confused on what state he is in (multiple times) and yall want to vote for this man.
Wait, I‚Äôm confused, are you describing Biden‚Äôs tax plan or Trump‚Äôs lack of a plan for dealing with the pandemic?!? #TrumpFailsAmerica
I do not support Biden. I do not support the Democratic Party.
Why Joe Biden Might Choose Terri Sewell for Vice President
Good grief. And his people want to make fun of Biden üôÑ
Joe Biden did not write this tweet, his staffer did!
Sometimes I wonder if that sharp contrast to hearing Biden talk is one of the main reasons he has been so consistent in the polls. Like this dude may become POTUS just for being a good guy. Not necessarily why someone should be president, to me. Ha.
Yeah the age hurts. For all of Biden‚Äôs shortcomings as a candidate, one of his greatest strengths is one of Trump‚Äôs biggest weaknesses. His empathy. You know when Biden talks about suffering, he is not bullshitting. It‚Äôs such a stark contrast to Trump.
You know the theory that Hillary was the perfect opponent for Trump? That if he went up against anyone else, he would have lost? In a lot of ways, I think it can be said that Trump is the perfect opponent for Biden.
BIDEN DELAYS NAMING VP BECAUSE OF DURHAM!? CNN REPENTS! REPORT THAT SWIN...  via
People are looking at these poll numbers and thinking Biden will automatically beat this man so they will not go vote.
That's funny right there...Biden won't be tweeting because he won't be able to remember what he was going to say.
Yeah until he dissed Rae for being a Biden supporter. If I wanted to flirt like that, I would not expose myself for being a selfish MAGAt.
I‚Äôm not talking about Trump. I‚Äôm talking strictly how Biden will be judged at the debates.
Mrs. Biden just said her husband wasn‚Äôt left or right, he was a moderate. She also said that he is as ‚Äústrong as ever‚Äù and his policies are what this country needs to bring us back to a better place....mentioning climate change.   Poor woman.ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Like Biden??
Except they support Bernie‚Äôs policie over Biden‚Äôs
Dana biden cannot speak for himself so his wife know will be another suragate speaker? Not interested üá∫üá∏
He‚Äôs far from the best candidate we‚Äôve got I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of Biden either but I would rather him over trump and or kayne ANY day of the year
I‚Äôm riden with Biden
Actions speak louder than words. This is not a posed photo-op, this is a real moment portraying who Joe Biden is.
I mean I want Biden to win, so I suppose I should not say that, since it just helps Biden. So, continue to push the narrative if you want.
Again, all you people pushing the narrative that Biden can‚Äôt form a full sentence are *just making it easier for Biden*. Biden will debate. If he is a senile old man, we‚Äôll see it. Don‚Äôt set the bar so low before the debate even happens.
His campaign has said over and over Biden will debate. Ha. They said it again yesterday.
Meet the Democratic candidate.  Can't wait for debates.
Definitely. I was saying to some MAGA people recently that continuously pushing that Biden has dementia will just make it easier for Biden. All he has to do is say coherent sentences, and it will be a win for Biden.
The fact that Brian Stelter is backed by CNN while making false statements only confirms #FakeNews We can't wait for Biden to take the stage &amp; debate.
Marshall, with all due respect, Biden has been prone to *lie* his entire political career (which is longer than I've been alive - over 42 years)...I just can't agree with you that Biden is better than Trump (although I'm not a huge Trump fan either).
You people are so dumb, or brainwashed or both, if Joe Biden ( or the shell of Joe Biden ) is elected, this country is done, and as far as my President is concerned, he is extremely intelligent, and it seems that none of you people doing the name calling are billionaires ???
How many years in Government has Biden worked? Why suddenly now does he want to fix anything? This election will set a record for a landslide GOP victories across this great country. GET EM BUZZ !!!
Where have you been Biden doe want healthcare for all. tRumPutin is trying to repeal ACA through the courts. Biden believes in climate change but trumPandemic doesn't.
A month ago you were saying we had to open back up before the economy died. Now you‚Äôre quoting Cuomo?  Biden will give you drastic change, for sure.  Everyone will be in the crapper. I know you don‚Äôt have a business with employees but  Biden policies will end small biz.
To anyone considering doing anything other than voting for Joe Biden this November, I encourage you to   ‚Ä¢reflect harder on the past 3.5 years ‚Ä¢do some homework on Donald Trump‚Äôs life prior to his presidency ‚Ä¢watch this video ‚Ä¢reach the obvious conclusion that he Has to go
Joe Biden just needs to ask him about injecting bleach, the country being mostly clear of COVID19 right now, and what's he hiding in his taxes?? How many porn stars he's fucked and paid off?? Should play great with the base. Christian conservatives love adulterers.
just now is of age to qualify for Medicare. But you want to put a police state Biden and Harris into office, and they aren‚Äôt going to appropriate the tax money from military and police spending in order to put it towards anything substantially good. Miss me with that.
Had general Flynn's son not been involved in questionable foreign transactions he would not have been under the microscope. Shades of Hunter Biden??
Joe Biden couldn‚Äôt even debate himself and win.
Mail in voting is the exact same thing as absentee.Trump has appointed one of his biglyest donors to now run the USPS, to slow down mail and defund the USPS in time for the election.   If Biden wins, BuckSexton and the right will insist it was unfair and illegitimate.
That‚Äôs because you all are talking as if someone like Avakian is like Duke. As if Biden needs to denounce him right away. If you read what Avakian said, he was not jazzed about Biden at all. He just thinks Trump is that bad.
Again, we probably just disagree. Doesn‚Äôt bother me that Biden did that. He is still much, much, much more moderate that Bernie.
Well I guess I‚Äôm confused. Has Avakian worked with Biden?
Oh my God. Ha. Biden won because he was the opposite of Bernie. He always has been. The *worst* case scenario is a medicare for all option is introduced. Which, is not socialism.
I mean Bernie has endorsed Biden. That does not mean Biden‚Äôs platform is Bernie‚Äôs platform. What‚Äôs this I have heard the entire time Trump has been president? He can‚Äôt control who endorses him? By your logic Trump and David Duke are linked.
That‚Äôs not what Trump is pushing. Trump is pushing that Biden wants to get rid of the police. Completely defund. You‚Äôre being pedantic. Trump is not pushing ‚ÄúBiden is going to defund the police by a dollar‚Äù.
Biden has repeatedly said he is against defunding the police. Also, the riots right now are worse than any riots under Obama. Trump keeps trying to link Biden to the extreme left, and it‚Äôs just not working.
Twitter loves to come to the conclusion both Trump and Biden have dementia with every gaffe they have. I mean they *might*. More than likely, tho, they are just old men.
Did you listen to the rest of it? It was a gaffe, no doubt. But if Biden was not in politics, and instead just a 78 year old man giving a speech, you would assume it was a natural gaffe by a 78 year old man. Not dementia.
I‚Äôm saying Trump is trying to sell what has happened in his presidency as what *could* happen if Biden won. It makes no sense.
Also, all you Trump supporters who keep pushing that Biden has dementia, etc are just *making it easier for Biden*. You are putting the bar so low right out of the gate, that you‚Äôre gonna make it super easy for Biden to come across as having won the debate.
He‚Äôll be fine. The debate of Biden and Bernie showed Biden, while no doubt old and has lost a step, is still fine. Honestly it‚Äôs Trump who should worry. Biden has a lot of ammo to choose from to attack Trump.
My guess.... Biden Supporters...
RED FLAGS!! Vote by mail and the VOTES will be collected and delivered by people campaigning for Biden!!
Biden will be fine.
Jill Biden will be on Fox tomorrow for an interview. I wish it were me asking her questions. I believe it will be

Why is Biden lying all the time?
Biden out and Bernie? Cuomo? in in t minus 10... 9... 8...
Given that reasoning Biden and Obama should have absolutely no problem unsealing their records.  After all they have nothing to hide.  Or do they?
GOP is licking its chops over Biden‚Äôs veep shortlist
Yes. DemonRats think they can commit the perfect crime. How long will they give Biden if he wins? If he loses; it‚Äôs goodbye cruel world, he‚Äôs off to join the circus.
Thanks to Trump this will be a landslide.Biden will beat him like a drum and all he had to do was let Trumps piehole do the work.We all know it. He had the presidency in the palm of his wee little hand and pissed it all away
I think that widely shared view is from people that did not watch the Biden/Bernie debate
Well no. His followers believe his bullshit. Ha. Biden will be fine in the debate. He was fine when it was just him and Bernie. He seemed to do better when it was just him and someone else instead of a bunch of people on stage.
Well today there is. There could easily be a pushback to the pushback in a week. Especially if Biden comes out and says he wants to debate.
He is obviously not as sharp as he used to be. It would be silly to deny that. He is also not nearly as bad as some on the right make him out to be. Both Trump and Biden are just old men.
This was from a quick google search I did. Although I will say there are more examples, at the moment, saying Biden should not.
Picturing Biden being sworn in and immediately afterward Trump is handcuffed and taken into custody...is Epstein's cell available?
Do you think, if I tried, I could find just as many examples of the media saying he should debate? Biden has said repeatedly he will.
This could be the calm before the storm (ref: WWl) while the dems wait until after the convention, when more people will be paying attention! So far the Lincoln Project has been carry the water, and they have done a great job! But they want DJT out, not necess. Biden in! ????????

Good article on strengths and weaknesses of current front-runners.
I hope people will realize that anyone Biden picks is way better than Trump. No doubt
That's fine Mr. Hilton but will the media cover it? If people are willing to throw away our form of government by voting for Biden then maybe we don't deserve the freedom.
#DearMichigan Please release is from this hell and vote Biden!
Who's writing this? We know it's not Biden himself. TEST........ Hey Biden, where are you?
I know what a Kangaroo court is, but what is it to vote for a Trump or a Biden? Certainly must be an off the shelf cliche
Hasn't Biden nee a career politician yet he has NOT helped with the unemployment &amp; gangs in Democrat cities? Why expect anything from him now?
Joe Biden‚Äôs son that passed wanted his father to run for President, he‚Äôs doing it for his deceased son. Joe Biden looks so fragile.
The very idea that Biden is a moderate shows how far left the Dems have gone. For most of his 36 years in the Senate, Biden was clearly in the left-most quarter of all Senate Dems. He was a Ted Kennedy wannabe.
Sleeping Joe Biden is so full of
1/2 It would be nice if FOX where developing a kinder approach to Biden, but that would be fantasy. Hating Joe Biden might be their downfall as their viewers are, for the most part, good people who are finding out that they have been sold by Trump and the GOP!
But it would be totally in keeping with Trump's narcissism to make such an argument against Biden. If he hasn't yet, he will!
Dan Bongino: Sources Say Joe Biden Is Reaching the Point of No Return, Democrats Will Have a Decision to Make                                       My first thought is that they go cuomo. Your guesses?
Trump probably can out debate Biden.Most narcissists sociopaths are pathalogical liars(said yourself #TedCruz),manipulative and "talk a good game". We aren't looking for best debater.
The same ones who let Biden speak!
Lol so you‚Äôre an obvious liar. Do me a favor and tell us all about Joe and Hunter Biden in the Ukraine.
Maybe some folks in the MSM should take a few polls to see what we the people think? But then we know that Biden's VP, COVID-19, the unemployed and a myriad of other problems would take precedence of a little thing like Barr's impeachment!
You think the world respects Biden?  What a joke!  That‚Äôs like dem‚Äôs passing things before reading them.
No doubt someone other than Joe Biden would be running the country IF he were to be elected. Dementia is a terrible problem for anyone, and Joe Biden is most surely in the early stages..!
Plenty of reasons to keep demented Joe in the basement.. to support Biden is nothing more than blind, unreasoned hatred for our president.. y‚Äôall running on emotion without reason
Warren is 71, Biden is 77. If she is too old then wtf does that make him?
It doesn't really matter.... With Trump we get 4 more years of prosperity. With Biden the beginning of the inevitable.  The Socialist have control of the Media... Hollywood.... Teachers and their Unions... Universities... Democratic Party...  It's not if.... But When.
This isn't even funny anymore it's just sad  should be in a nursing home the man is suffering from dementia or Alzheimer's disease. I can't believe people are foolish enough to vote for him  Biden FORGETS where he is
The only joke is Biden all  should be ashamed of themselves this man is not in the right mental state to even be alone he definitely shouldn't be running for president he doesn't know where he is or what he's doing half the time
I don't understand this delusion. Biden doesn't even understand!
Biden Campaign Says He Is So Close To A VP Pick He Can Smell Her  via
On day one I hope Biden reinstates every single person that lost there job because of Trump. They gave decades to their country.
How would you build on it? You have to make the public option appealing, or it‚Äôll just be a place for private insurers to dump their expensive clients. You‚Äôd have to expand services for Medicare, which Biden isn‚Äôt for
You‚Äôve got to be fucking kidding. Clinton may be a pedo, and if he is, I hope he‚Äôs jailed for life. But, Biden is waaaaaay less connected to pedophiles than trump. Way less as in zero. If there‚Äôs one thing we should be able to be bipartisan about... it‚Äôs the rape of children.

Should former Vice President Joe Biden win the White House in November, America will likely be in for a foreign policy about-face.
Much admire a president who drives an American built Corvette rather than wimp who couldn't even get his fat ass into the car! Joe Biden = American style and confidence! #VoteJoe !!!
On top of Trump wanting to cut payroll taxes, you have his shills in social media and legacy media trying to scare people about Joe Biden intent on doing things such as removing Trump's tax cut for the rich.  Unfortunately for them, the majority supports that. And more.

Is Obama and Biden racist?
Yes makes sense when you consider how short dems expect Biden to be in office if he wins.
Ms. French seems to be part of the Bernie Bros group that is trying to bring down Biden! Instead of being a never Trumper she wants to deflect our attention to Clinton of 30+ years ago! There are many more pics of Trump and Epstein than there are of Clinton! Could she be a bot?
Joe Biden wants to build the bridge to lead this country into the future. Donald Trump wants to drag us back into the past. The choice is clear, unless you somehow think the 1960s were good in which case you need professional help. #YesWeCanAgain
Yes, though I'd be surprised if Biden refused. Trump, not so much.
Suggestion: since CNN is 24/7 news, it would be a good thing that for EVERY TIME Trump speaks from his bully pulpit, Biden or one of his VP candidates should be given time, on air and live, to respond to Trump / Pence's lying and distortions of truth! Thoughts?
Because they do not meet the approval of the Bernie Bros who are still trying to take down Joe Biden! This is what we see in the heartland and it is sometimes most obvious in comments made by former Sanders supporters! Wish they would leave Joe alone with his decision!

I‚Äôm more worried about Trump calling martial law and being a dictator than anything Biden can or will do.

This is 100% correct. Biden is the lesser of two evils, and I'm not voting for him.

Wasn't sure but now it's evident that the Bernie Bros have enlisted Lou Dobbs into their Biden sabotage plans! Can Hannity and Carlson be too far behind?
Sad this is an actual positive point for Biden...
Actually if one listens to Trump's tirades on mail-in voting one can see a plan developing in the collective GOP mind on how to beat Biden! The GOP govs will get together and print duplicate copies of the ballots and cull out the Biden votes! So simple!
e Bros are still trying to defeat Joe Biden and are sending up this stuff as if they were Russian bots!

If that happens you will see a real disaster. Biden as been a do nothing his whole life!
I agree Jimmy. I don't think it matters much who Biden selects for VP candidate. People just want to get rid of trump.
I disagree. He may be okay with her sandbagging him at the first debate. But I don't think Dr. Biden has forgotten. So do a lot of people. Yes, Senator Harris has a good TV image and name recognition.But she has some baggage. And she didn't really do that well in her campaign.
Hes desperate and unraveling. Be careful what you wish for  If you think your going to stay after Biden beats you like a drum, we the people would love to see you leave in a straight jacket.

Alyssa is a neoliberal, rich Democrat, who likes Biden who said No, no, no, no, and no to all of the actual policies that would make the lives of Americans better.  So liberal?  No.  She's barely liberal like anyone else who voted for anyone but Sanders.
I wish John Lewis had gotten into "good trouble" two more times by endorsing Bernie Sanders instead of Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden.  He did not.
Almost as bad, most anyone except Bernie or Warren in the primary.  I kept wondering when Biden, or Buttigieg, or Klobuchar would actually describe a policy.  But all they said was "No."  No health care, college, SL forgiveness, etc.  Just no.
Why vote for Joe Biden was his guy is part of his persistent team socialist Bernie Sanders?

Do it, I dare you. Pelosi will be president until we count the votes and then Biden will move in WH. Do it....
I would honestly agree if an independent had a chance in an American election but since Biden is hiding from debates she will never get a chance to be on stage with them.
So you know there will be cheating ie LA county has 125% of its population on voter registration which is a million people. You will be screaming Trump cheated if he wins but if Biden wins it will just be a conspiracy that there was fraud. The only audit will be if Trump wins.
But it won‚Äôt be Biden and we all know that. He‚Äôs the puppet. Will likely be whoever is selected VP.

Joe Biden says he'll make VP choice next week
President Donald Trump is painting a dystopian portrait of what Joe Biden‚Äôs America might look like, but a surge in violent crime in several American cities has happened on his own watch.
And didn‚Äôt Biden have John Kasich as a speaker at the DNC?Let‚Äôs get our country back? Hell, y‚Äôall had it for more than three years!! What did y‚Äôall do with it?? Y‚Äôall lost it believing this liar!! Look at where you are today; is your America Great Again? HELL NO! And it won‚Äôt be for a long time. Biden will get us out of this hell hole!!
The Sanders wing has scored a lot of victories in the Democratic platform‚Äîbut didn‚Äôt get all it wanted on Israel.
Maybe he didn't listen to it, he just felt like it was patriotic at first and sent it. Maybe it was an accident. Maybe he did it on purpose. He has literally never made disparaging remarks toward the black community. Ever. Joe Biden is awful.
(Of course, I‚Äôm also reminded that Biden isn‚Äôt Catholic enough for some Catholics, so there‚Äôs that)
I'm not even a biden fan but where is this energy for others?
One problem with countering the ‚ÄúBiden is anti religious‚Äù message with references to Biden‚Äôs lifelong faith is that lots of white evangelicals still don‚Äôt actually believe Catholics are Christian.
so like, if we aren't supposed to vote for biden who are we supposed to vote for..........
We're still going to vote for Joe Biden! Trump had his chance, his goose is cooked! Trump knows if he doesn't win he's going to jail! Trump is nothing but a crook and we know it ! F-Trump!
Joe Biden literally doesn‚Äôt even understand what the African American community is
I thought Trump was just BSing but then I saw this photo of a young Biden.
I'm not sure a Demo controlled senate would approve. If all Republicans voted against, it'd only need a few Democrats to vote against. I think those votes would be there, especially if Biden opposed. Cant know for sure, of course. But this is why historians need to be heard now
Wow. This has no chance of making it thru our current senate &amp; president. And I doubt Biden would sign it into law either if it comes up during his term. But this is the "slippery slope" that people warned against, and that historians need to be heard on.
If Joe Biden could decisively destroy the god worshiped by Trump‚Äôs supporters, he would be doing an inestimable service to America and the world.
How powerful does Donald Trump think Joe Biden is if he says he will ‚Äúhurt God‚Äù
When has Biden ever said he will take away guns?
Great so there‚Äôs no hope  Tho maybe if we get Biden he‚Äôll help w that? I have no hope lol
I love the context, also for clarity I don't think it's also funny in Biden's case
Will the left-leaning national media jump all over Biden for this? I know if it were Trump they would....
Did  pay you off or something?? It's gonna HURT the Biden campaign.
This grandstanding politician is going to hurt the Biden cause.  Talk about something sure to fire up the Trump base, sheesh!üî•üî•
Aye, and her grandstanding will undermine the Biden bid and generate even more support for Trump.
Biden doesn‚Äôt know how grant
If Biden followed science he would be pro life (biology) and would not put billions toward climate change given most scientists agree we don‚Äôt have enough data to justify that.
To the extent this is even coherent, his idea is that China will change when we go back to the WHO?  That‚Äôs nuts even for Biden.

Clinton only won it by 1.5%. 538's average has it at 0.7% redder than the national average. If there were an election today, Biden would win it, but if Trump makes up ground, it's certainly one of the states that he could win.

Trump was not and is not terrified of Bernie. Trump wanted to run against Bernie so bad he could not contain his excitement at the thought of it, and his anger that it ended up being Biden. The capacity you bernie supporters have for delusion is scary
Biden‚Äôs scared.
He barely won last time. This time the economy sucks, he bungled covid and nobody hates Biden like they did Hillary. I could see him losing decisively

I dont get how bidens mind is ever brought up. Do you hear trump speak? He spent his last news conference staring at the podium to read his notes. Trump is obviously more senile than biden and in worse health.
Absolutely. Trying to tie him in it when there's no evidence. All because they got their feelings hurt that their sicko HRC didn't win 4 years ago. And they'll get their feelings hurt again when creepy Joe Biden doesn't win.
That‚Äôs a lie. It‚Äôs a lie. You are lying about Joe Biden. You will never make your lies stick, Ronna. The amusing part of this is that as much as you and the progressive wing of the Demo party would love this lie to be fact, it‚Äôs simply not. You cannot turn Biden into Bernie.
I‚Äôm astounded that ANYONE is seriously considering a vote for Biden. Besides being a pervert and a criminal, he clearly has dementia.
Won‚Äôt get this if Trump or Biden win this year
Lol I don't care about Biden. That's the best you've got?
You owe Joe Biden an apology.  This falls short of admitting how wrong you were.  Apologize.  You will feel better afterwards.
remember when you said that Biden's accusation that Trump would try to delay the election was  "Over the line" and Biden "should know better"?
I think #Biden &amp; #Pelosi both want #Trump‚Äôs head on a pike. And he knows it, too. So don‚Äôt look for him to resign. ‚ÄúPeaceful Transition of Power‚Äù is the only card he has left. It‚Äôs too late to play it. But he‚Äôs desperate and has no other options. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020

In order to support and vote for Biden, a documented racist at his core, they end up condoning and propagating racism with that support! - Stephen Fuller
Biden‚Äôs racism has ALWAYS been there. It‚Äôs apart of his core as a man. Yet, the Democrats continue to give him a pass! By doing so, the Democrats simply are not credible , their arguments are not valid, and they lack any standing in any serious discussion about racism.
If Biden is incapable of debating or knows he is incapable and afraid, how about at least have 3 rads (Dems) vs 3 conservatives ( Republicans) on stage for 2 hours and debate 5 major issues predetermined by national polls. 1/2
Spot the difference: 2012 Biden vs. 2020 Biden |

I thank you for taking the time to type that. I don't feel like it addressed anything that I asked though. I'm not trying to be disrespectful. I'm just curious what you see is the distinction between Donald Trump's racism and Joe Biden's racism? Where's the line between the two?

Joe Biden when ever he sees a black person when he says that they are not diverse enough
What is the difference between Donald Trump's racism and Joe Biden's racism? At what point did Donald Trump cross the line, as you see it, in terms of racism? I'm not trying to change your mind, or voter shame, genuinely trying to understand your point of view.
I'd love to believe you but I'm also sick of reality. üíî Biden might not be the far left's choice either, but he's a man of faith and grace &amp; humanity, and the church is poised- yet again- to vote for horrific insanity in the name of a buzzword.

I feel like the only people complaining about Joe Biden and his gaffs about Black Americans are  conservative white folks trying to say ‚Äúsee! He‚Äôs just as bad as we are!‚Äù when one is just saying stupid shit and one is saying they don‚Äôt deserve basic human rights
You know what Biden said you can lye. But God knows what‚Äôs in your heart you need to tell the truth.
Biden can say he‚Äôs a Catholic, but he does not practice Catholicism, he is pro abortion, he is gay marriage, those are practices that do not represent Catholicism.

Exactly. Biden keeps showing us that he thinks of us as one giant blur, and people keep making excuses for him. I bet the real reason he hasn't picked his VP yet is because he can't tell any of the black women apart.
Peak liberal behavior is the comments of this post crying big ass tears that Yang uses the word fuck k stead of dealing with the message.   This is why Biden is gonna lose 45 states in November.

Here‚Äôs a long one for you all:  Today Joe Biden is quoted as saying: ‚ÄúUnlike the African-American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community".  His point is that black people are a simple folk, and all believe the same things. 1/10

Someone asked me, What if instead of the Vice-President slot, Sen. Biden offered Sen. Harris a position on the U.S. Supreme Court if elected? Would this lifetime appointment supercede a 4-8 year term as the V.P.? Could she be much more effective on the Court than as the V.P.?

Way to dilute Biden‚Äôs insistence on how ignorant it is for him to take a cognitive test to your own racism Ari.
Specifically for-profit mega billion dollar cable news networks. Our friends are people who work for a living, poor people, &amp; marginalized people. The path forward is to demand health care, demand peace, demand criminal justice reform, etc. Neither Biden nor Trump offers those.
It's really important to understand that I'm not trying to defend Trump or his administration when I'm critiquing Joe Biden and his administration.
"You can't prove anyone is or isn't an objective fascist..." Well then, what's your assurance that Trump is a fascist?  For the record I think Trump and his administration are fascistic. I just also think that Biden and his administration would be similarly fascistic.
Biden literally hits all 14 of those points.
An easy to understand example is how Joe Biden is presently against decriminalizing marijuana. African Americans are disproportionately imprisoned for possessing or using marijuana. An easy way to solve that would be to decriminalize it, Biden's position preserves fascism.
Joe Biden authored the law that permitted the weaponizing of state violence against minority groups to increase the prison population and brutalize / terrorize poor urban neighborhoods with state violence.
To answer the question of Joe Biden's fascism: He authored the racist crime bill. Are you aware of the impact that the racist crime bill had on African Americans in the United States? How it exploded the prison population and permitted police brutality and extra judicial murders?
So anything anti Trump is fake news? What PT says can't be denied. Biden is losing it? Trump prattles on making no sense, or actually state his callous disregard of US people. "Sure they die, it is what it is." Narcissist means he can't care about others. Not viable in a Pres.

Where the 1st lady interview. I would rather see the 1st lady interview no one cares about the Biden‚Äôs that watches Fox. Next they will have cheater Donna Brazile own tell us how great that was.
The media is also trying to create talking points for the Biden Camp about the way she debated Joe so he can choose someone else. Kasie Hunt aired a portion of the Veepstakes that featured Kamala debating him. She didn‚Äôt bother featuring Warren doing the same.   The disrespect.

She's wrong, but also WHY BOTHER BRINGING IT UP?  I would still vote for Biden if he named a box of Cinnamon Toast Crunch as his running mate.  I would still vote for Biden if he named Sus*n S*r*ndon as his running mate. Anyone who wouldn't is dead to me.
I mean, they‚Äôre trying to sell Biden to a group of dissatisfied GOP voters that the Dems aren‚Äôt bothering with, which could bring Biden more votes and Trump fewer, so... that‚Äôs good?
Let‚Äôs face it. The Democrats don‚Äôt have a candidate with the mental fortitude to run the nation, much less an economy, especially coming out of #COVID19. It‚Äôs embarrassing that they have to duck &amp; hide Joe Biden, knowing full well he‚Äôs gonna say something stupid.
He was a bad dude. Who can forget how he soaked that straight blade in a rain barrel to get it rusty before he confronted lifeguard joe.   I‚Äôm not entirely convinced that Biden didn‚Äôt make up that story.
Then why have they supported this entire fiasco? Why is Joe Biden supporting the 'squads' plans? Why are they fighting every single thing President Trump does to ensure our freedoms? Wake up, the democratic party has moved over to communism.  They just use socialism as a front.
I want to see it. I don‚Äôt think it will go like you think. If the Biden that debated Ryan showed up, he‚Äôd be a serious threat. However, if Biden is as bad as we think it would end with him dropping out of the race. That‚Äôs why he won‚Äôt.
Yeah, that doesn't change the conclusion that most of Biden's support is driven by anti-Trump animus and not Pro-Biden enthusiasm.

I understand how enormously frustrating it is to believe that you have only to choose between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Both are outspoken enemies of Medicare for all. Note that the green party is offering Medicare for all.
I guess you don't need health care? I'm not sure what you're looking for. What is it that Joe Biden is going to deliver for you? What are you getting as a return on investment for giving Joe Biden your vote? It's your vote, and I'll not shame you for using it, though.
Yang shared the debate stage with Biden during the Democratic primary season.  via
I think what you're really saying is what people tried to say in 2016: Donald Trump has an enthusiastic, yet small, base. Joe Biden has no enthusiasm and no base. So if people don't vote for Biden, that increases the risk of Trump's small base overwhelming Biden's emptiness.
No. A vote for Donald Trump is a vote for Donald Trump. A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for Joe Biden. A vote for the Green Party, is a vote for the Green Party. And so on down the line.
It amazes me how many people still don't realize this. Biden was never going to be the nominee. Democrats never play anything straight. They're always planning and scheming behind closed doors to try and rig the system in some way.
No. A vote for Trump is a vote for Trump. A vote for Joe Biden is about for Joe Biden. A vote for a third party is about for a third party and not voting, is not voting.   The Democratic party has told me they don't want my vote because I want Medicare for all.

Still trying to figure out exactly what the democrat's angle is with Joe Biden. I mean, we all know he's not going to be the nominee, he never was. The question is what are they scheming. The democrats never do anything straight. They are always scheming and trying to deceive.
ANY other f Biden‚Äôs prospects are infinitely better than Mike Pence.  I wonder if President Obama would input his opinion.  He did a damn good job picking Biden.
This does not EXCUSE the brutality of Trump. (We've become accustomed to people pointing to other bad things as an EXCUSE for the current bad thing.) This is instead highlighting that Biden is NOT the solution. Because he caused the identical problems... which led to Trump.
1. I want everyone to have healthcare. 2. Trump looks like he's going to lose in a landslide at this point. 3. Joe Biden could reply to every question by saying "I am not Donald Trump", (and nothing more) ... and Trump would still lose in a landslide. Politics is over. üò¢
This may be even more true if Biden were to win somehow
I think there should be a debate. Trump would totally destroy Biden in the debates.
Biden will make things worse because he will reinstitute the illusion of normalcy. The out if sight, out of mind strategy that allows the elite and their bourgeoisie flunkies to focus on their paymasters and their own self interests at the expense of the suffering masses.

I just thought it was pathetic how he folded to tbe DNC attacked Bernie and backed Biden, and folded on m4a.  But I think he genuinely and naiively had some ideas he cared about.

I will not vote for Joe Biden or any Democrat in 2020. Thus, his VP pick means nothing to me.
I'm not voting for Joe Biden, regardless of who he chooses for his vice president. The Democratic party rejected Medicare for all, accepted continued corporate donations, and rigged their elections. That means that they don't want my vote. So they're not getting it.

American Politics in a nutshell. ** It's debatable that Trump is worse than Biden. Biden authored the racist crime bill and voted for the War in Iraq. Biden forged the weapons of war that Trump's administration are wielding on the world and on our own citizens. So both are evil.

Does anyone that reads this believe Joe Biden has the mental ability to be president? Is he going to be a shadow president while a brown woman is to be president.
The fact that Joe Biden is going to have a female VP, and potentially black makes me feel like he‚Äôs doing it bc he knows he HAS to.
See and that's exactly where we differ in opinion. I do not believe that Biden is even a little better than Trump.  And I refuse to vote the lesser of two evils. If the Democratic party wants my vote they need to run a candidate I believe in.
By selecting Biden as the nominee the Democratic party has once again given a big "fuck you we don't need you" to Progressive voters. I'm just honoring their wishes.
And I get it you're willing to vote for Biden because you believe that there is some legitimate difference between him and Trump. I don't. Deal with it.
I don't vote against candidates I vote for candidates. So instead of trying to explain to me why I need to vote against Trump explain to me why I should vote for Biden without mentioning Trump.
Sorry but if your best argument for Biden is "but Trump" you're engaging in a futile effort with me. I don't negotiate with terrorists.
Literally every reason I won't support Trump are the same reasons I won't support biden. And telling me I have to support Biden is like someone trying to convince you you have to support Trump. It's a total waste of time.
Exactly. Which is one of the reasons why I will never support Biden because he will not support universal healthcare.
Someone made the argument that I should support Biden because of the ACA I explain to them why the ACA actually hurt me and that he didn't created in the first place so why would I give him any credit for it?
But also even if it had been good for me I still wouldn't credit Biden because he's not the one who fucking did it.

You are correct about his aneurysm but he speaks and has written about stuttering since early childhood.  I am working hard not to be pissed off at people about this. I'm officially declaring today my last day of patience with this.
That is a sticking point with me, but I find Trump to be as close to an anti-Christ figure in 2020 as I can think of for a multitude of reasons that I'm going to give Joe Biden the win. Trump is pro-life only as far as courting anti-abortion voters. ProLife is much more than that

We made the promise to vote blue no matter who.....we have had to live with knuckle head Pence, I don't see any person Biden has vetted that I find objectionable.  But it is time for a woman and I believe time for a black woman if that is what he chooses.
Youre actually entirely missing my original point in my initial tweet response to the guy who posted the video. He portrayed Biden as though those were HIS words, therefore he's a closet racist. Disingenuous and irresponsible, not to mention inaccurate.
November 3 of this year will be the most crucial election in decades. Start preparing now.  Democrats from ALL socio-economic backgrounds must get prepared and rush to the polls on November 3 to vote for Joe Biden. Make no mistake.  Democrats must vote in large numbers to win...
Oh I'm sure the unedited version didn't show Biden quoting someone else as he reads. I am not a Biden fan, but your tweet is part of the fake news problem in this country.

There is plenty of time for that after the elections, right now get your followers to support Biden, and speak out for Biden. Everything else is noise.
After trump, the bar for GOP presidential candidates will be so low I‚Äôm afraid that any sliver of decency will be rewarded with electoral success. I mean, this man would be a king if we‚Äôd allow him to be, &amp; yet he‚Äôs only marginally losing in polls.  It should be +30 for biden.
If Biden has the ability to hurt God, then Biden is even more powerful than God. Does trump understand the wrath of God?
A foreign asset tied to the Russian mob shouldn‚Äôt have been allowed to run in the first place, but while we‚Äôre there, Biden should require tax returns for debates to happen.
Since money to trump is God, and Biden is one of the few politicians that hasn‚Äôt grown rich in office, I guess it‚Äôs all about what or who you think God is.
Poor old Biden!!
I know absolutely NOTHING about that. I'm not God. I do NOT judge according to hearsay and rumors. I'm judging Mr. Biden according to what I know of him. Mr. Biden was Vice President under President Obama for two two terms. President Obama never discredited him.
Can you believe Trump accuses Joe Biden of hurting the Bible &amp; hating God, Trump is a Nazi in the WH he's so deranged. Tear gas those folks in Washington so he could take a picture in front of a church holding a Bible, if he keeps going to churches he's going to burn them down.

I always wonder how they can look in the mirror and attack joe Biden for messing up words when you sound like this in every media forum you are in
A Joe Biden feature on Dethrone by Bad Omens would've been legendary.
You just can't beat a good Biden clip! Joe is the most overtly racist candidate I've seen run in a presidential election during my lifetime, yet he's the "Democrat's best" during a time of racial discord that they themselves created in our nation. You can't make this up!
I'd been recklessly considering my reaction if he named Stephen Miller and... still. 100% Biden.
So is Biden an incompetent moron or capable of hurting God? I‚Äôm confused
I pissed in someone's corn flakes. I made a joke about Biden and got suspended for it.

This coming from a man who thinks two Corinthian is a book in the Bible, who holds it upside down.  Not that I want to be judgmental, Donnie, but what does the Bible say about lying, stealing, cursing, cheating on your wives, pride, covetousness since you are so holier than Biden
These were not issues of morality or Christianity. They were issues of fairness and justice.  We don't care zilch about crooked Trump and hypocritical Republican propaganda. Don't come here with it. Biden/Democrats 2020 for a diverse and fair Government.

Biden winning puts off real change longer. Trump winning puts the possibility of real change off to 2024. Real change has to come from the people. Biden is corporate puppet.
The Biden campaign ad copy practically writes itself.
Barack Obama had his 8 years. Can you imagine Baracka Obama having ‚Äúher‚Äù eight years after Biden resigns?
Next mini-rally he will just sputter "Man, Woman, Camera, God, Guns, Biden".
Paying off a porn star isn‚Äôt a crime but I won‚Äôt defend it. Biden actually dodged the draft with 5 deferments. Please provide proof he cheated to get into college and he was already worth more than the $413 million before he inherited that money.
Attacking someone of another race isn‚Äôt wrong, attacking an entire race is and Biden has done that routinely through his career.
Today on the  Show: Biden‚Äôs Racism Reminds Me of Al Campanis
Maybe because he‚Äôs said much worse like he didn‚Äôt want his kids to grow up in a racial jungle, or that Obama was the first main stream, clean articulate African American, or to enter a 711 you have to have a slight Indian accent. Biden is a racist!
Really don‚Äôt care what SE thinks. Her and her political party drove this ship into the harbor we are currently docked. Suck it up and vote for Biden or don‚Äôt vote at all.  Again, Republicans drive us into a ditch then expect us to pay for the wrecker to pull the car out.

Remember the last time we had a fine family man in the WH? One who loved his wife and children, one who had dignity, one who had compassion for the ‚Äúother,‚Äù one who was widely respected in the world. That was just 4 years ago. Let‚Äôs do it again. VOTE BIDEN IN NOVEMBER!
These are common sense reforms supported by the majority of Americans. No Biden is not coming for your hand guns or hunting rifles or calling for repeal of the 2nd amendment. We just want responsible laws governing gun ownership and the type of weapons that can be legally owned.
When Biden suggest nuking hurricanes or that windmills cause cancer then you can talk shit, till then sit dow
This dog won‚Äôt hunt. Biden is seen by many on the Democratic side as far too moderate and we‚Äôre hoping he will pick a more progressive VP.  Biden certainly cannot accurately be characterized as too liberal, although he certainly would be more liberal than most Republicans.
The point of spreading the Axios interview, just like any other moronic clip from Trump, isn‚Äôt just that the President is a moron. The point is to show how little regard he has for others and push them to either not vote for him or vote for Biden.
To go against Biden mental and physical fitness is a joke. trump is by far not cognitively there. I mean, is that the best trump and the gop got? How sad for you. At least campaign on trump‚Äôs record. You can‚Äôt. Trump hasn‚Äôt fulfilled any of his campaign promises.
Young people need to WAKE UP, these media members are puppets! It's sad I haven't heard ONE SINGLE good talking point from the DEMS, only insults and negative talk about TRUMP. DEMS trying to keep JOE hidden, PLEASE put BIDEN and TRUMP on stage together lets see how that goes üòé
That Axios Trump interview was the most depressing and frustrating thing I‚Äôve seen in a while. I‚Äôm going to fucking hate myself when voting Biden.
LOL. Biden has pulled ahead in Texas, is slaughtering Trump in California ...but hey... at least you've got Alabama w/ its 9 EC votes.
Six months ago he could have ordered massive testing, and all of the other precautions he was advised to take. He could have also listened to a little advice from the guy who will likely succeed him.
yep. Biden will handle trump regardless. However, the more they push he has dementia blah blah they are only lowering the bar of expectations that all biden has to do is show up get his name right. this mess of a strategy is what you get from incompetent amateurs
loving how bad this campaign is being run. this push to make biden seem incapable of debating or in decline will backfire spectacularly.
Sounds great! Biden 2020!
Better not be a Ralph Nader redux. If they want to run in CA, NY, WA, OR, AL, MS, OK fine, go for it. But they will have a lot to answer for if Biden loses MI or PA or FL by a slim margin. It's the nature of our electoral system and they don't care.
Not true. Biden is a Christian (a real one!), Pro-life, listens to experts, supports opportunities for all, a veteran, Pro-police and anti-defunding. Maybe time to swap teams in my opinion. Dump Trump!
as an independent who leans left I‚Äôm looking forward to this conversation. While i trust npr i also sense a subtle bias. I‚Äôm hoping Biden wins the election so i can see if the coverage is the same since i wasn‚Äôt listening doing the Obama era.
Biden couldn't debate my dog...
Is Biden even capable of holding a conversation, let alone a debate?  Can he stay awake long enough?
Right... Every candidate just bowed out after Biden‚Äôs announcement to run. Not suspicious at all.
Wow. That was tragic to watch. Biden May repeat himself and have his off hand comments but trump out right lies and reinterprets actual events to benefits him. Trump needs to admit he didn‚Äôt realize Covid‚Äôs impact and start fighting it.
Mr. President,  I hope you are able to get Biden to debate you!  I don‚Äôt bilieve the polls right now, but I don‚Äôt think we can leave it to chance.  If he wins that will be devastating to our country!  Please get him on stage with you and crush him!
To get to facts and truth, Trump, Obama, Biden, Rice (if she is VP candidate), and others should testify to Congress under oath as will help American voters decide whom and what the voters believe in making their 2020 voting decisions. #alpolitics
By ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù are you suggesting candidates on same stage but virtual audience, or candidates debating virtually? Because there is no way in hell Biden‚Äôs team approves the latter. I think they are already exploring all avenues to cancel debates period.
I was referring to celebs like   and  who said Blacks should hold their votes until Biden agrees on a Black agenda or reparations. I should have made that clear. I know you are hard on everyone üòÇ
My problem with you and other Black celebrities are holding Biden responsible for a Black agenda but not trump. You are quick to say Democrats take Blacks for granted but this Republican Administration has proven to be racist.
Before he teased Biden for wearing a mask and now he‚Äôs promoting masks. Six months and 157,000 lives late
If the belief is that Biden will trounce Trump, why not debate?
Is Biden's son, you know... you know... The thing man? The one who became a multi-millionaire from China? Is he.... Awww you know.. You know... Umm ummmm going to jail? Yes, you bet as Biden doesn't know what state he is in, or doesn't know his wife from his sister... He is.
I'm envious of everyone who reads that thinks "communists support Biden" and don't know who Bob Avakian is

Right. Because the vulnerable are really being helped by Democrats so far. The AFA was a joke for any of us that lived in the south. And instead of playforming an option that could protect us all, they vetoed a one payer platform. Biden truly cares. /s
What we hear in trumps press conferences is what we‚Äôll hear in other debates tenfold.  Joe Biden shouldn‚Äôt debate him without a built bat.
Timely reminder for all women. The warning against Trump comes from a class act, Barbara Bush. Vote Biden on 11.3 if only for your self-esteem.  #WomenAgainstTrump
How about Biden‚Äôs? I suppose you have the same I terst in his? Since he‚Äôs been a government ‚Äòservant‚Äô for 40 years and is somehow worth $9 million. Weird.
Like how Kushner and Trump disposed of tens of thousands of Americans because they lived in blue states? Just admit you‚Äôre pro-birth and fine with 4 more years of Trump instead of waxing poetic and clutching pearls over Biden‚Äôs completely predictable pro-choice platform.
obama announced that biden was his running mate two days before the democratic convention. hillary announced that kaine was her running mate five days before it. this year‚Äôs convention is on the 17th. calm down.
Joe Biden said it 2 times in front of congress..
Why would Biden supporters turn out to see you? They cannot stand you! Duh?
Sharp Joe Biden is on it. Stocks when up 8 consecutive years under Obama. Biden can do it also. Under Trump worst economical downturn in history. Ever!
Tomorrow when you have Dr Jill Biden on your show, please ask her how she feels about putting her husband in embarrassing positions!
There are three presidential/vice presidential debates scheduled between September 29th and October 22nd, but several Democratic supporters of Joe Biden are begging the former VP not to debate Trump. -
The media is invested in protecting Biden at all costs. See another example.
Pretty sure Biden has already been exposed.

Biden picked up that crucial Maoist cult endorsement.
Yeah Joe Biden needs a New look!!!
Biden didn't put it off, the the DNC did. The plan is that whoever is the VP pick will be President within a few weeks if Biden is elected. They have no intention of keeping ole Joe as POTUS, in the unlikely event that he is voted in they want to have a commie VP to step in place
Biden Goes Big Without Sounding Like It
Orange cheeto potus 147% evil.  Biden 2% evil.  Biden every time.
It will be more satisfying to scan in person for me. I do not trust the new postmaster to get the ballots in on time and I remember 2000. I also contacted  to become a poll worker. Biden needs to fix elections after Jan, top priority
Remember this, fellow Americans: the President GOLFED while thousands died and did nothing to  contribute to Congress‚Äô efforts to pass economic legislation to help those suffering. VOTE Joe Biden on  November 3rd.
Hear the August 3 Today In Perspective program, ‚ÄúJoe Biden and Muslims Both Set Aside Principles for Power‚Äù
This will be the problem for Biden in the presidential debates. Debating someone who pathologically lies, even about things that can be fact checked, who makes up his own reality, and who has absolutely no moral compass will be very difficult to engage with. Facts v delusion.
I long for a Trump  vs  Biden debate.
It is so True ! Joe Biden's Socialists Party is made out two factions! The Ignorant stupid Blue Collar Folks and the Super intelligent want to dominate &amp; Rule You and America ! They will destroy the America  that We have Known !!!
I think the Democrats know that none of these possible picks will be popular with the American people. They are delaying as long as possible. Two on Biden‚Äôs list of four are from California. Oh, yeah, we want more of California‚Äôs products in gov‚Äôt. Horrors!
The Democrats aren't putting Biden in for president, they are putting his VP in for president. They  plan on putting in the VP as president in a few weeks. I'm gonna bet that they choose Mooshelle.
Endorse Biden. 150000 dead and climbing. About to see children and their teachers added to this number. Millions out of work. Little to no Federal response. Members of your own party refusing to simply wear a mask.
They aren't running Biden for President,  they are running whoever they choose as VP. If Biden were to win the VP would be president within weeks,....maybe days.
This isn't about Biden, it's about who the DNC chooses as VP. That person will be President if Biden is elected.
Which makes about as much sense as a Joe Biden interview.
So one bad apple makes all Trump supporters bad?üòÇ I hope you can see how pointless of an argument that was because I can send you plenty of Biden supporters  being completely gross and spitting in people‚Äôs face, screaming at the top of their lungs like a possessed person, etc.üòÇ
So you‚Äôre ok with Trump going further right than he already is? Trust and believe I‚Äôm a big time Bernie fan but I‚Äôm not stupid either. I‚Äôll rather fight Biden for M4A than fight Trump on the right to live.
The DNC isn't running ole Joe, they are running who ever they choose as VP. That person will be President if Biden were to win.
I will vote for Democrats all down the ballot, town, city, county, state, Congress and Joe Biden!
Biden needs more diversity among his advisors. He needs more women, women of color, and young people advising him.  So sick of old and middle age white men tell highly accomplished women about how they aren‚Äôt magical enough to do a job.
I like to think of it as both voting for Biden and against Trump.
Your disturbing with your comments! What have you been great at? And with your comment how many hits have you taken to be so blind? Please vote for Biden! Unreal
Biden dementia deniers will use this absurd line of thought to justify excusing the obvious.   Biden can‚Äôt debate because Biden isn‚Äôt able.
Isn‚Äôt this exactly what Biden supporters want? No police? And now you‚Äôre complaining about it? I absolutely cannot keep up! #BLMDomesticTerrorists

It's so sad that they are putting Joe Biden through this process.  Whatever his condition, the ongoing pressure cannot be helping.
So just like 2016... who will answer the call in the middle of the night? Biden or Trump? Nuff said case is clear
US House of Representatives must be protected and empowered as the main voice of the people. It is, in fact, the voice of the people. Not the senate, not the ‚Äúelectoral college‚Äú, Not the SCOTUS, not the POTUS. 435 vs 100+9+1. We the people must make the rules. Vote Biden/DEM
I disagree with Joe Biden. I think he has a truly disturbing history with underage girls. There is a 0% chance of me voting for him.  I also think he desperately needs to be in a hospice or similar where he can receive the medical attention he needs, not being propped up on TV.
Can't force people to see reality. Trumpism has created more reality deniers. Fake left now worships murderous sociopaths like John Bolton, provided he says bad things about Trump. That's all it takes to wash away all sins. So they will deny Biden dementia till the end of time
Say ‚Äúwe need Biden‚Äú not we need ‚Äúa presiden‚Äù...Joe Biden is the answer now! We need sanity in the White House. We need ignorance removed from the White House. We need Joe Biden NOW!
Biden is a Moderate and he's too old to be more than a 1-Termer.   He won't do much except stabilize our county.  Maybe in those 4 yrs the GOP will do some soul-searching and abandon Trump's Nationalist Populism and return to it's roots.  I want the Party of Reagan back.

I 100% believe Georgia could go w/ Biden but the problem is in Atlanta you literally have to take off an entire day of work to go vote it takes that long. And lots of folks can‚Äôt do that
The best work being done for Biden is from 3 young brothers, a successful novelist, and a group of old R operatives. The DNC should be ashamed.
Biden‚Äôs declining mental state continues. Two weeks ago he said he'd be releasing a health care plan today.   There's no scheduled press conference, no release.   If Biden can't even keep track of his campaign‚Äôs plans, how can we trust him with anything else?
What about Trump's indecisiveness? He can't decide if he's Russian or not. Most of us have decided. . .he is! By the way if indecisiveness is what you see in Biden's selection process, I see a thorough evaluation of candidates.
Neither does Biden by the way.
I just know Joe Biden is wondering why everyone thinks Bill Clinton is a torpedo right now
Yep, even if Biden picks Liz Cheney or even Sarah Palin. Cause policy or integrity isn't important, esp not for limousine hyper libs. After all, it's nor their kids lacking healthcare or dying in the wars. So any woman will do cause they don't live the oppression
Repeat after me: I will NOT support Joe Biden‚Äôs VP pick. I will allow the media to tear down a female candidate who is a putz. I‚Äôll call out any democrat for not bashing Biden‚Äôs VP pick. This election is life or death for many. We have the luxury to complain. Let‚Äôs Elect Trump!

Hypocrisy reigns in DEM party.  called Biden a Racist for his policies and Believed his sexual harassment accusers-well, up until yesterday. Now Biden is a Saint. She can‚Äôt wait for the next stroke-hoping it‚Äôs 2 days after swearing in.

Joe Biden is an extremely disappointing candidate as was HRC. I‚Äôm not excited about Kamala either tbh.
Joe Biden is 77- why does anyone think a 77 year old can help America? He is out of touch.  He probibly has a flip-phone. We MUST have term limits.  These Kings and Queens are out staying their usefullness.  In government Maturity does not = wisdow.. it =‚Äòs stupidity

Not all Biden supporters are pedos but all pedos are Biden supporters.
You mean like VP Harris having come from Jamaica and her dad once said her grandmother stated she was a descendant of Hamilton Brown was a Irishman that owned a slave plantation on the Island which was involved in the slave trade. Therefore Joe Biden has a racist problem now.
Are you still a democrat? Genuine question. I only ask because the comments seem to be from ppl who started a new party and want to bring you along. At any rate, Biden has been working with Sanders. Moreover, don‚Äôt ever discount us older ppl, pls
Maybe for you and others. But I won‚Äôt forget how Brie Brie and the Bernie bros pushed this lie and had so many calling Biden a rapist.

I like what I just heard re: the Biden VP choice.
So they have pushed Biden to pick a VP, if Biden dies and he were elected that VP pick would become President and Pelosi might have competition in a fight to manage Congress if VP is a female. What if, then may happen that she cannot accept the nomination in which case a upset.

Kasich does whatever benefits Kasich. He is looking for a cabinet position with Biden. It is pretty slutty, but that is what politicians are.
I really thought the Dems could do better than Biden. The outlook for this nation is now bleaker than ever thanks to the complacency of the #DNC and the #GOP. No faith in this two-party system at all.

i can't find any record of biden ever approving any kind of funding for health justice, where are you getting the idea that he has ever "supported" any kind of abortion or health care?
trump's paid for more abortions out of pocket than biden has approved government funding for.    there's lots of reasons to support biden if that's your thing, but he has zero record of supporting health justice generally, and especially not abortion rights.
you realize biden was in a church when he made those "shoot them in the legs" comments, right?
That‚Äôs what everyone said in 2016. Can‚Äôt take this election for granted.  Many people dislike Trump and are disappointed by Biden being in the Democratic ticket. They may stay home.

Russia &amp; Ukraine sinking Joe Biden &amp; his son slowly, Ukraine court case filed against Biden in Ukraine. That money Joe &amp; Son took was a Ukraine fund with Russia, Biden is literally guilty.
Joe Biden has no defense for his irresponsible actions, known fully his son had absolutely no expertise in anything the Ukrainian Gas Co had supposedly paid him for, their President fled Ukraine &amp; Biden and his son came back to America with the Ukraine fund. That's it folks.
Soon once Russia and the Ukrainian's got back in-line with the monetary fund of Ukraine Biden took to America Ukraine brought charges against Joe Biden in Ukraine Court.
Biden denigrated himself in Ukraine esp to the Russian financial goals and responsibilities, money owed to Russia somehow was given away to Biden's son and his father Joe came and withdrew his son &amp; money back to America strong arming the Ukrainian Co deal with Russia.
Oh power, perhaps  has more diverse sincerity for the hundred's of dead murdered Christians of African countries than Biden has for the dead Latino's that did not make it crossing the US/Mexican border. Is Biden OK with Hedge Funding, BLM, riots, murders?
Sure Joe Biden worries that Trump will notice hundreds of Christian African-American's were murdered in three countries in Africa following Biden mentioning a learning session he offers African-American's on Diversity which would be a frightening event to the public not aware.

Can we please have the masked-up rallies for Biden-Harris now? üëèüèΩ We can do this. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Let me be clear on this.   The Trump Campaign will not attack Joe Biden as much now. They will turn their attacks on Kamala Harris. This camp sees her as a dangerous threat and will treat her like she is the one leading the ticket. Mark my words.   KHive, let‚Äôs get to work.
Yes to optics.  I don't care for a lot of Harris' positions, but she's better than Palin.  Minimally when ABC interviews her, it won't be a train wreck.  And did Biden ever have a younger base?  Was anyone of any age ever excited about his run?
Well, Harris is aligned with most of Biden's positions, it's just that being a centrist is uninspiring, arguably unethical, and clearly not what any of us wanted. But yeah no reform for us.
So? Debate skills are not necessary as evidenced by Trump &amp; Biden to achieve where they are now. There will be so many more rules in this debate not like the unstructured &amp; lopsided DNC debates.
It is not up to Biden. DNC only is interested in corporate donors and big dark money.
So what KH debates better. Do debates really count??? As evidenced by Trump &amp; Biden
I believe the effect will be neutral in votes. My point being - debates - so what? Trump &amp; Biden are not the best debaters - that quality did not get them in top spots. And so what if KH is a top notch debater? More security - could be in order...
More accurately, Biden found out today which running mate the DNC chose for him.
Liz Warren is so pissed right now. She raised 3 times of Kamala. All for Joe Biden to drool on himself.
Stacey Abrams was not picked for Joe Biden's running mate because....voter suppression!!!
Yes, I don‚Äôt think Rice has an ambition to be president. That said I think she would make a good one since she is very smart and very tough. If Biden gets elected I have no doubt she will be appointed Secretary of State.

I live in Alabama. Absolutely not. Older blacks lean center to center right. They knew Biden fam. Sanders really wasn‚Äôt campaigning in AL at all! The votes were not spread out. It‚Äôs a moot point now anyway.
DNC is loyal only to big donors including dark money. I don‚Äôt think Biden has a say - it is the DNC donors making the decision. And if Yang is for removing money out of politics - then not a good fit with the status-quo. My opinion only.
"Trail" not "Trial"- although Biden needs to pass trial &amp; go straight to judgement!
How many years has Biden been in politics?  What has he done in all that time to make a difference? He appears to have dementia

Don‚Äôt worry Ben, white people will be just fine. Even if Biden is elected.
And Biden refuses to support Marijuana legalization

Did a journalist really just go on NPR and talk about how Joe Biden‚Äôs gaffes might affect his election chances?
I think you‚Äôll see a run up about a month before the election like IBB tanked into 2016 election. The presidential election is less relevant than how the 11+ states vote on legalization. Gut says all of them will vote to legalize it. If Biden wins no sector will be spared
I am wondering if Kamala Harris missed a whole Senate Hearing on Wednesday because she had to fly out to Delaware to meet with Joe Biden. This would be days after Gretchen Whitmer‚Äôs arrival on Sunday.  ü§î
Patriots, who is Biden choosing as his VP?  The message is always "Next Week..."

Wouldn‚Äôt it be amazing if trump tweeted ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt believe the false smearing of Joe Biden.  My intelligence advisors have told me they‚Äôre spreading false information on social media.‚Äù  Classy John McCain certainly would have.
Biden has a speech impediment making it hard for him to say some words. Trump has well we don‚Äôt want he has.
Look at all the privileged ass hats in the replies saying they won't vote for Biden because he's "just as bad as Trump". There is exactly ONE way to get Trump out of office. Vote for Biden and continue to support other progressive candidates for Congress.
Since Russia is so busy trying to discredit Biden, any truly patriotic American should obviously vote for Biden. A vote for Biden is  a poke in the eye for Putin
this show has become a mini clips for the Democratic talking points of the day. Each story to match up a talking point of closing the country down, COVID gross overstatement, Biden justifies stupid senile statements list is endless, an that flunky Cali Dr , shameful
Someone asked me, What if instead of the Vice-President slot, Sen. Biden offered Sen. Harris a position on the U.S. Supreme Court if elected? Would this lifetime appointment supercede a 4-8 year term as the V.P.? Could she be much more effective on the Court than as the V.P.?
In Huntsville, AL - NASA, üöÄMarshall Space Flight Center, full of engineers &amp; scientists - have not seen any Biden signs. There have been possibly 3 Trump signs - that I have seen...Colbert's interview, he says "We'd call Biden and Kamala Rockefeller Republicans," and the two MSNBC pundits gladly and happily agreed with his assertion. No issues were discussed, but there was much talk about "identity" elements, which is I guess all that remains in the party.
Bruh fuck Joe Biden üó£
Ig Biden gd. I hate to C it but I can't vote for a nigga that fired the Pandemic Response Team in the beginning of the worst modern pandemic this country has ever seen. Ik Biden ain't shit but he's something different from a nigga that has such a blatant reputation for racism+
I'm surprised you'd mention Social Security with Biden's statement about being willing to cut it.
The postal union endorsed Biden &amp; they're a crucial (as we're seeing) part of the electoral process. We can't disqualify stakeholders in our society on the basis of...being stakeholders. But yeah the leadership at very least of the  is just aching to wear brown shirts

Biden is reading from Obummers playbook.
Joe Biden said the same thing so your point is...?
Trump has not dared legalize or decriminalize marijuana since he took office... and you think war hawk Biden and #KamalaCop will???  #BeBold #VoteGold  Let's make #America Free again
Hell no, I doubt it! Go back to 2008-2009 with the H1N1 under Obama/Biden... compare all figures thru Wikipedia and draw your own conclusions.. Biden didn‚Äôt do anything spectacular then, and even not with debilitating dementia, past history shows it wouldn‚Äôt be different ‚ÄºÔ∏è
Patriots, it's up to us! If Joe Biden wins, the entire corrupt Obama administration will be back. We will once again be stuck with Hillary, Eric Holder, Susan Rice and the rest of the Obama criminal bunch.
So is Joe Biden no longer a racist or rapist, as you alluded to during the primary debates?
After they lost their jobs thanks to ignoring a deadly virus.  Joe Biden is not president and has no power over jobs.
Not even close. Read responses by  Only thing 'abhorrent' is Biden's response. But that has come to be expected.
I wish I would get a polling call from the Biden campaign camp. I would say three words, ‚ÄúCOME ON MAN!‚Äù  Then I would hang up.
He did. Ironic you should call forth the 1 President Since LBJ who hated America &amp;Americans. Obama may never see jail time, but we will get as close to him as possible.Why do you think Biden is "mentally declining"?If you suffer from dementia, can't face consequences. Conventient
JUST IN: National Association of Letter Carriers, a union that boasts nearly 300,000 active and retired postal workers, endorses Joe Biden, warning that the ‚Äúsurvival‚Äù of USPS is at stake.

Did you notice how Biden said ‚ÄúBe a patriot‚Äù while telling us that he will mandate mask wearing? Where have we heard the patriotic theme before regarding mask wearing? Oh yeah....that would be Trump.üôåüèª Get your own material Joe!

I really hope you are right.  I only see pockets of Trump signs but almost nothing for Biden.  If the idiots that are ‚ÄúRepublican‚Äù vote for Biden because ‚ÄúOrange man bad‚Äù then it is because of media and low in voters.  Anyone with a brain can see all the good that has occurred.
Only after Nov 3rd. Biden and Harris want us to wear masks EVERYWHERE for the next three months! We're plagued with assholes and idiots.
From the past 24 hours: Kamala Harris doesn‚Äôt have birthright to run for VP From the past week: children are basically immune to COVID19, voting by mail has massive fraud, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris support defunding the police Can‚Äôt list the rest, no space.
Was Biden's campaign operating out of Daphne?
Of course Biden's proposed federal mask mandate would be unconstitutional. But no one in the media will call him on it.
The serial plagiarist plagiarizes again. Big surprise.
Hear ya loud and clear. How is it possible that the voters of this great country have to choose between Donald Trump and Joe Biden?
We don‚Äôt validate reporters who are only trying to harm the country and get 5 seconds of ‚Äúlook at what I did‚Äù during press conferences - How about a video of Biden answering questions...I‚Äôll wait
Who gives a rip what Biden says at this point. He‚Äôs just Polly ü¶ú anyway and has no authority 4 anything except what the demoPhobics are proposing!
The hypocrisy of the Left is unreal. Harris was a cop and if we learned anything from the left it‚Äôs that ‚ÄúAll cops are evil.‚Äù Not to mention her offering up proof that Biden was a racist who hung out with segregationist, and best of all she said she believes Biden‚Äôs accusers

I‚Äôm capable of disliking Trump and Biden at the same time. It‚Äôs quite simple really.
Once the Biden/Harris administration takes office I hope one of the first things they do is get DOJ to launch a thousand investigations into Trump.  I generally believe in not going after past presidents but this man has caused so much harm. We can't just let him go.  Prosecute.

Democrats lauded Harris as a perfect complement to Biden‚Äôs centrist candidacy, but some Republicans argued the move only reinforces their allegations Biden has become a tool of the far left.
I don‚Äôt get it. The Trumplicans are arguing that Biden picked Harris because she‚Äôs black. Then they say she‚Äôs not actually black. How does this even make sense?
Easy... backing the blue does not mean the same as mass incarceration. Imagine a country with  no police. We need the police... we don‚Äôt need the legislation that disproportionately effects the black community which is what Biden and Harris have done.

Neither   nor  intend to debate Biden or Harris. They're going to scream they want to do it, then make ridiculous demands. And claim Biden and Harris were afraid because they refused to debate standing on their heads and drugged.
Reaction to Biden-Harris Democratic presidential ticket
Hell, criticize them to your hearts content. Kamala has been calling for defunding the police recently though, and picking her was a better move than picking Klobuchar (marginally). But also no one could make Biden look other than he is at this point. He's still not Trump.
Tulsi sucks and I don‚Äôt fully trust her but Kamala is abysmal. I‚Äôm voting for Biden but I personally think this pick could end up hurting the campaign.
Riden with Biden  Fairest with Harris.

I went outside to sit in the sunshine, and started reading about Harris as Biden‚Äôs vp pick. Then a dark storm cloud rolled in and blanketed the sky. Winds came in from the East. Leaves were blasted from the trees. My porch door was blown open, and papers were strewn about.
Haha, good one. Too bad Biden is a puppet to the DNC, and Kamala Harris thinks Biden is a sexual abuser and a racist. Not sure how those two ended up together. What do you think, Patty?
I am, and straight Blue, starting with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
Actually my apologies towards Chris Wallace, he is a tough interrogator, but why doesn‚Äôt somebody like he pull Biden out of the damn bunker and ask him unprompted questions?
I‚Äôll kiss you on the mouth if Biden wins! He won‚Äôt! He can‚Äôt even make his own decisions. He is simply a pawn in the DNC‚Äôs game. You must admit that he is simply not the best candidate for you guys. He just has the most popular name. #kamalaharrissucks
Good job DNC! Choosing the same candidate who ripped Biden a new one on his racist remarks/policies and sided with his sexual assault accusers. But hey, she‚Äôs a woman of color. That‚Äôs all that matters to the Dumbass National Committee

Well at least at Fox, Chris gets to voice his opinion, but at CNN, MSNBC, CBS and ABC, you don‚Äôt get to voice your opinion... you read the script. But I will say one thing, when I see him interview Joe Biden and not ‚Äúpull punches ‚Äú then he will become ‚Äúmore‚Äù credible to me.
President Trump told reporters at a White House briefing that Kamala Harris ‚Äúwas very disrespectful to Joe Biden‚Äù during the Democratic primaries, and said ‚Äúit‚Äôs hard to pick somebody that‚Äôs that disrespectful.‚Äù
Sen. Kamala Harris once said that she believed women who accused Biden of inappropriate touching.  IN HER OWN WORDS. ‚ÄúI believe them, and I respect them being able to tell their story and having the courage to do it,‚Äù the California senator told reporters in April 2019.

I‚Äôve heard Biden‚Äôs latest campaign ads too. They‚Äôre copied from President Trumps accomplishments &amp; what he‚Äôs already fighting to get done for us. Biden is a copycat, plagiarist &amp; liar.......not to mention....a wimp!
1. VP Pence will make her look incompetent  2. Biden may pretend to have the virus to get out of debating President Trump.
It's all for votes!  Biden chose her because he got an ultimatum saying he must choose a black woman.  She's suddenly Black American for same reason. BLM will still demand destruction of America!
Last time I checked Biden‚Äôs never actually been the President during any of those 50 years, whereas Trump‚Äôs been POTUS for the last 4 years and yet he still talks about what he will do and not what he has done because all he‚Äôs done is damn near DESTROY THE COUNTRY! üôÑüôÑüôÑ #ETTD

Curious to see how she, Biden and their MSM pals wriggle out of all the public statements that have been made.

Oh yes nasty women are going to get Biden and Harris elected
If Bran just stays warging into Biden throughout his term we might be all good guys.
Aye if Bran just stays warging into Joe Biden throughout his entire term we might be all good.
You mean Biden?  Isn‚Äôt up for criminal charges in the Ukraine. No Quid Pro Quo Job. ‚ÄúAnd the Son of a Bitch got fired‚Äù
Kamala Harris‚Äô extreme positions, from raising taxes to abolishing private health insurance to comparing law enforcement officials to the KKK, show that the left-wing mob is controlling Joe Biden‚Äôs candidacy, just like they would control him as president.
Adding my two cents, kudos to Joe Biden on a great selection of Kamala Harris. It makes me proud to be a Democrat today!!!
Biden or trump we really gotta choose the lesser evil üòÇ
Then you never intended to vote for Biden, right? That would have been a better, far more accurate &amp; refreshingly honest statement to make.

Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
"JOE BIDEN IS RACIST SO IMMA BE HIS RUNNING MATE" -Kamala
You‚Äôre exactly right I drive about 1500 miles a week all over the southeast. Never see a Biden sign I‚Äôve seen one bumper sticker,one out of thousands of cars
"Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate"
Girl what? Do you realize all the sus shit Biden has said when it pertained to integration and segregation. Harris literally called him out on supporting policies of segregationist but it‚Äôs whatever
I DON‚ÄôT mean that you should vote Biden/Harris and then go ignore politics for the next 4 years. No. If you don‚Äôt like the Dem slate, get involved at the lower level. Vote local, vote city, vote county, vote state, vote school board (even if you don‚Äôt have kids), vote dogcatcher.
Look folks, my reaction to the Biden/Harris ticket can best be summed up as ‚Äòmixed, complex, and nuanced‚Äô, but I am still voting for them against Trump. This is not a ‚Äòtake your ball and go home‚Äô moment given how our system actually, y‚Äôknow, WORKS.
No. But I'm not voting for Biden either.
So far the race for a Biden VP is a ‚ÄúRun for the Roses‚Äù.
Im thinking about voting for the first time. I never voted because i dont want to do jury duty lol. Can you give me some reasons to vote for Biden over Trump? Thank you!
Too bad after like a month Biden will be declared not fit for office and then peoples votes for him would be for nothing. She‚Äôll destroy our economy with the things she proposes.
You think wrongly, my friend.
as if biden wasn‚Äôt bad enough he picks kamala as his vip ?!!

And everyday calling for Obama‚Äôs birth certificate was, even after he provided it?? This is more proof we have the wrong person in the Oval Office. Don‚Äôt know if Biden is either, but compared to this, I am all for it!
Difference is Biden knew he had mispronounced it, Trump mispronounced it twice &amp; didn‚Äôt know he did anything. We are better off without him. I will always feel that way. Watch the Axios interview, no defending it.
In the midst of a defund the police movement Biden picks Kamala Harris as his VP choice.
So, who‚Äôs trying to listen to me rant about the Biden-Harris ticket, black voters, the DNC speaker list, and more.üò≠ I got the time today.
Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris as his vice presidential running mate.
That would make too much since for black people. Remember this is a dog and pony show.  His selection was premeditated. She is a token black.  She has a track record that spells trouble for our community  No matter who wins, Trump/Biden. The same thing will happen FOR "Black" ppl
Did Sleepy Joe forget that only months ago Kamala Harris attacked him for his racist policies? Now he is handing over the reins of the Presidency to her and the radical left. #al01 #alpolitics
Biden VP pick: Kamala Harris chosen as running mate. Whoop! Whoop!
Don‚Äôt really want to vote for Trump or Biden smh

Biden just announced Kamala Harris as his VP pick! Woohoo!!!
So, Joe Biden is going with Kamala Harris as his VP. I think that she's more risky than some of the other candidates but she's definitely qualified and I have no issue with voting for that ticket.  And neither should any of you.
So Biden picked Kamala Harris for his running mate.

Biden needs foreign policy help because he is always wrong on foreign policy:   Plus, he's a "demagogue."
Ronald Reagan warned us against Joe Biden&lt;br&gt;

Joe Biden has selected his running mate, revealing to top advisers the woman he will invite to join his ticket, two people familiar with the matter say
Advisors tell Joe Biden who they have chosen to be his running mate**
He is as much of a conservative as Biden is of sound mind.
What cognitive issues? Biden has been a gaffe machine his whole career, and there are multiple montages showing Trump and Biden both equally stumbling words and confusing events (eg, just yesterday Trump says 1917 pandemic ended WWII).
Whoever Biden selects as his VP running mate, she will be 1,000% better than our current VP! And I dearly hope that she will speak "truth to power" with the President rather than soulless wimp that currently holds the office!
so when Biden sold our country to China that made him a great vp?
Any debate between Presidential candidates would be a farce because Biden would have the questions given to him before hand as well as his prepared answers.
If it IS #KamalaHarris that Biden‚Äôs handlers choose, which one will it be?ü§î
Exactly. The Trump platform is all about fear &amp; hate-fear of Biden &amp; hatred of other Americans. With no principles/policy to go by, Trump must have conflict to survive -the last 4 yrs prove this. If today‚Äôs America is your happy place, vote Trump. For the rest of us it‚Äôs Biden.
A Biden/Rice ticket pretty much lets  go on to victory by doing not much more than letting the Trump campaign punch itself out. Don't underestimate how many people are *really* pissed at Trump and plan to vote Biden no matter what anyway, so half of this is theater. 2/2
You know why I say Susan Rice is a safe choice? Because, when all the right has on her is Muh Obamagate, there's not much damage that can be dealt to her. Nothing they've thrown at Biden is sticking either, and the Trump campaign is going to be all offense out of necessity. 1/2
Alabama Sen. Doug Jones will be among the speakers at the Democratic National Convention next week, a virtual event at which the party will formally nominate Joe Biden as its presidential candidate.
So it' obvious that if Biden doesn't pick a black woman for his VP then the Blk community will turn to Trump to spite Biden? Just guessing that the BLM would evaporate as they would no longer have the support from all Americans nor a donor base to support them! Blacks for Trump?
With Biden likely to pick a Black woman as VP, here‚Äôs how the media can avoid playing into sexist and racist trope‚Ä¶
Good statement from Bernie but it begs the question: Why have your Bernie Bros taken it upon themselves to disparage every female candidate for Biden's VP? Why have they enlisted Russian bots in their plans? Why are they trashing your stated goals to suit their own agenda? Why?
Reminder to Democrats: VP Pence is not a democrat! Quit trying to get Biden to select another Pence or Trump will win in 2020 by such vocal shortsightedness!
...very much like what is going on now with Biden. Trump listened, and his choice was made by himself, Jared and Ivanka. We now have Pence as VP. The question is do we want Joe to listen to the loudest voices, or do we want him to select a VP that will work hard for us,or a joke?
B.S.    Biden doesn‚Äôt know anything except what he‚Äôs told 2 say! Get real‚ÄºÔ∏è

Biden subscribes to the theory that a huge LIE told often will be believed by the masses who don't pay attention. Trump NEVER said he would defund Social Security!
I am voting on November 3 for Joe Biden, I don't care who he picks as VP. The situation is critical.
This is the same man who can‚Äôt quote any scripture that important to him because he doesn‚Äôt read the Bible. If he revered God he wouldn‚Äôt have autographed Bibles. If he was just a little religious he wouldn‚Äôt be judging Biden‚Äôs faith or saying he hates God He‚Äôs a piece of work
49% and to date no debate !! If he can‚Äôt debate he certainly doesn‚Äôt have what it takes to run a county. Of course China supports him... they will own the USA if Biden wins! God help us all.
To play rope-a-dope, at some point you need to be able to land a killer punch. Biden can't.

Like I said before, I wouldn't be surprised if President Joe Biden ask him to be in charge of Veterans Affairs.üòá
Oh The sad thing is a lot of the voters for Biden know this &amp; they don't care. That ignorant mentality is one of the main reason The Country is in the shape it's in because the scum could care less.

The One Tweet That Pretty Much Captures How Progressives Feel About Kamala Harris as Biden's VP Pick
Fox News and F uker I mean Tucker are all the real FAKE NEWS. America is all fired up and ready to elect Biden and Harris.  We just hate that we have to wait until November 3rd.
The most important thing is that we America women know who he picked.  Our future Vice President Harris will serve with our future President Biden.
Me too.  Biden all the way to the White House.
Senator Harris WILL make a GREAT Vice President.  American women WILL support her all the way. So call the Movers because Biden is moving in this January.
Per TeamTrump it‚Äôs Obama and Biden and Harris‚Äô fault.

I would like to see America free of Covid 19. So I guess we're both disappointed. I think that I will settle on being FREE of Trump will have to do.  Voting Biden Harris on November 3rd.  The BLUE WAVE is COMING.
The truth is both parties suck but the Republicans suck worse. The DNC has fucked progressives over for two straight elections, so progressives are rightfully not very excited about a Biden/Harris ticket. But we understand it‚Äôs the lesser of two evils.

Mark Levin: Biden's VP pick Kamala Harris brings 'nastiness' to the table
This man won‚Äôt make promises he doesn‚Äôt intend to keep. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris together will restore our country to the magnitude and greatness we remember.
Above all, in my opinion Joe Biden is a good man. He is a Christian. He practices his faith. He has experience and is respected among world leaders. He has integrity. He has known loss and he has love in his heart. He is strong and knows healing. He is a survivor.
That‚Äôs what we need. Biden is not afraid of a challenge. I like that about him. He doesn‚Äôt mind someone who disagrees with him. He knows when to listen to someone who knows better than him on a particular subject. He respects truth and honesty.
That‚Äôs what grownups are supposed to do. It‚Äôs the president of the United States job to compartmentalize. Joe Biden can do this. Trump can not. Kamala Harris will compliment Joe Biden. She will advise him; not always agree with him. His cabinet will probably be diverse.
He seeks to heal our wounded nation by combining the elite minds from the top of their fields, whether they agree with him or not. As long as the United States of America improves from their knowledge, Joe Biden is willing to listen and act in our best interests.
Vice President Joe Biden is a Democrat. He is not a dictator, an authoritarian, or a neofascist. He would never undermine an election. If he felt an election were in jeopardy, he would allocate funds to ensure a fair and just process.
She is a trash candidate. She wants to ban assault rifles via executive action. She wants to ban plastic straws for some reason. She want socialized Medicare. And she‚Äôs against fracking. Why the hell did Biden choose this woman? He already had California and the black vote.
Fuck Joe Biden
Here ya go for all those that want Biden in 2020. You telling me you agree with his statements? Now all the sudden he‚Äôs changing his mind cause he cares about you? Nope, he wants votes!!! PERIOD!!!
The most troubling &amp; dangerous thing about Trump than is abuse of power,mental health,narcissism,&amp; pettiness is his own goddamn ego! Regardless of what people think of Biden,We need someone better that Trump. 4 more years of Trump and everyone's not gonna stand for it!

Kamala Harris represents 'complete socialist takeover of Joe Biden,' Trump 2020 adviser Schlapp says  #FoxNews
Is the idea here that the Biden campaign is weak and slow because it‚Äôs currently beating the Trump folks by a historically large margin for modern elections?
It‚Äôs really, really popular in media and Very Online circles to dismiss ‚Äúevangelicals‚Äù as a gigantic, lost cause Trump voting bloc.  Thank God the Biden team hasn‚Äôt bought into it.
And I think the biggest reason why is that the Biden campaign ( et al) has made sure these important constituencies aren‚Äôt only being spoken to by the GOP.   makes this point a lot, and it‚Äôs important: we should never surrender to Trump in this space.
Most of these folks never liked Trump to begin with, but none of them even considered voting for Democrats in ‚Äò16. In fact, they took active steps to avoid doing so.  For a few reasons, their calculus has changed drastically in ‚Äò20, and most are now affirmative Biden voters.
The Biden campaign has brought these groups closer together than ever before, at least from my vantage point.  Dozens of ‚Äúevangelical Christians‚Äù I know and love have given up on Trump. The cages, the gassing of protesters, the racism ‚Äî it was all too much.
Boy we saw it first hand. What a horrible President that idiot was &amp; to show how many stupid people are in this Country they elected him twice &amp; that's exactly why I know Biden will win. He doesn't know who he is, but he'll win.
Can you dispose of Biden ? He‚Äôs garbage
Trump supporters: we can't live in fear from something like a virus because we'll die anyway  Same people: *swallows 10 pills and uses essential oils like it's weed* You know, Biden is going to take away all the guns and supports ANTIFA
It helps that the media was dedicated to praising everything Obama/Biden did. Hell, it didn‚Äôt matter if was Fast and Furious, Benghazi, spying on U.S. citizens; the media bowed at their feet. Now the media be as hellüòÇ
Hmm his dad must have been a racist and a rapist too. That is what she called joe Biden in the primaries üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ if you vote for the racist and the radical leftist you are a moron.
This Trump rally in the White House being the chaser to the Biden/Harris shot we got earlier sucks.    It's like drinking milk after the shot of tequilla.  Gross.
Joe Biden has a relatively unique ability among national political figures to make fun of Trump for his whining, and we should be looking for more of it as summer turns to fall.
Joe Biden just said Trump has done nothing but sign executive orders. Hmmm. You talking about that executive order to extend unemployment benefits that your party wouldn‚Äôt pass bc they wanted to play politics?  Please, playaüôÑ
Biden didn't talk in a stream of consciousness garbled mess and Senator Kamala Harris just gave the speech of her career.  It really contrasts with the "me me me" Trump keeps displaying.
I really don‚Äôt understand why people are doing this. Like yes she might be terrible. But Pence/Trump is worse. No Biden isn‚Äôt who we really want. But we definitely don‚Äôt want Trump again. It‚Äôs not like we have a lot of options.
The Biden-Harris Administration. That's the tweet.
Did Joe Biden just call her Komdalisa at his press conference?
WE certainly WILL.  Voting Biden Harris on November 3rd.
Harris will make a great addition to the Biden team.  Just ask Your HUSBAND.
The question at this point is who do you think will do less damage as POTUS? Trump or Biden?
That's California Joel. Her record as the AG is very suspect esp with incarcerating blacks. The Dems already have California for 2020. The front of the ticket remains Joe Biden, whom Kamala accused of being a racist. Lot more problems on the Dems ticket.
You‚Äôd think I‚Äôd be mad that I ran over my damn Wayfarers I‚Äôve had for 5 years but it gave me an opportunity to order some Biden shades

These are the asshole who will also say "that was Obama, Biden had nothing to do about it" when we point at economic growth, etc.
Why this conversation period.  Not once has anyone questioned the ‚Äúwhiteness‚Äù of Joe Biden or the ‚Äúorangeness‚Äù of trump.  Please talk about the issues:  Covid-19, healthcare.
Joe Biden was refused communion. He is in complete rebellion. Without acknowledging, confessing and repenting he will remain in rebellion. So at best, he is a luke-warm, rebellious Catholic by name only. You know what the Bible says about being ‚Äòluke-warm‚Äô: Rev 3:16 üî•
Kamala was already announced as the first Indian woman to compete in major election? ü§î Her  family was major slave owners in ‚ÄòBrown Town‚Äôüò°. She called Biden a racist, segregationist and believed his sexual harassment accuser üòÆ. Make up yalls mind ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.
Dismembering and sacrificing human beings will never be ok. Joe Biden must repent and the Catholic Church must take a stand. God will not be mocked.
To say Joe Biden is Catholic is to say that God and the Church have changed their mind about abortion. That hasn‚Äôt happened.
Except Biden‚Äôs support of abortion.
Along with my rant from previous tweets, America is seeing the largest wage gap between the top 1% and working class since the French revolution.... Neither Trump or Biden will do anything substantial to fix that. IDC if these CEO billionaires ‚Äúworked hard to get where they are‚Äù
We need more people of the working class in office. We need more people of the millennial generation in office. Stop voting legacy politicians into office. They have never cared about anyone but themselves, their pockets, and their big corporations. Biden ain‚Äôt anything special
Y'all. Donald Trump has a racism, narcissism, sexism, and tax fraud problem. His fan base has a racism problem. Stop falling for his bullshit. Biden absolutely needs to right a lot of wrongs, but thinking Captain Cheetoh is better? Embarrassing.
She believes Biden‚Äôs accuser but accepts his VP nomination: such sincerityüòè
I think Trump has been triggered because an amazing Black Woman named Kamala Harris was Biden's VP pick. So instead of being triggered of the 160,00 people that died under his and the accomplices negligence,They going nuts over Biden's VP pick! Everyone already knows time it is!
‚ÄúShe is also the first Democratic presidential or vice-presidential nominee from west of Texas‚Äù
I was a big Juli√°n Castro Supporter. Was hoping to see his name in the mix, but this is an extremely electable ticket. Biden knee what he was doing.
the media just don't get it the person you force on us NEVER WIN!! Kamala Harris isn't going to bring the Black Voters out unless she changes some political views! We're not impressed with Good looks Anymore sorry Biden ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
What pisses me off is the economy under Trump made life good for Biden, Harris and most of the wealthy Dems. Not to mention more work for those so inclined. Unemployed got a raise. And they still wanna tear this house down. Lunacy! Pure Lunacy
I love this so much! Taking back our country‚Äôs soul! Biden/Harris 2020
i AM voting for biden however i will continue to complain abt him &amp; the other one girl!!! i complain every day of my damn life why would this be any different.....
- Biden was Vice President when a man was executed by a firing squad in 2010.   - Biden Was the Senator of Delaware when a Delaware man was executed by hanging in 1996.
Even #BLM founder Shaun King, thinks Joe Biden's a moron. Yet, they want him to have Nuclear Codes?! üò≥
Normally everyone. But we're talking about Joe Biden.
So you CAN sleep your way up the ladder. Sara Palin earned her stripes the normal way. Yeah I know this is controversial but I heard her trash Biden till she dropped out. Wonder if HE did. Apparently it doesn‚Äôt matter to him.
Somehow I knew Joe Biden was gonna pick Kamala Harris as VP and Trump reacted by calling her "Nasty" &amp; "Phony Kamala" but it also seems he didn't like the VP choice too! Trump fears strong women,No matter what tricks he pulls everyone already can see through him like a laserbeam!
Daryl, if you are voting for Biden then we are the same ‚Äúus.‚Äù
Something that I‚Äôve learned in the past 4 yrs is that the candidate or even the platform isn‚Äôt the end game of politics. The candidate is the beginning and then you work to ensure that they support the policies you want. That being said, I am ready to vote Biden/Harris on Nov 3rd
Guess this makes them full of shit #Biden #Harris #Hypocrite #Lying

I can only speak for myself, but I don‚Äôt like that she‚Äôs been known to turn her back on the black community, her own community, as soon as it proves to be convenient. I‚Äôll still be voting for her and Biden but that‚Äôs just one thing that rubs me the wrong way.
Was that before or after your son, Hunter Biden, was given a lucrative job with Burisma in Ukraine (without any experience) in an effort to get you to put pressure on their prosecution...which you did?

Have you looked at Biden‚Äôs platform for 2020?
We want to see Americans stop dying from the Trump virus.  So I guess we don't always get what we want.  Biden will actually do something about the important issues.
Women of All races will take this team to the White House And we will Gladly kick Trump out if needed.  Mothers. Grandparents,  sisters and daughters voting Biden Harris on November 3rd.
i dont give a rat‚Äôs ass who biden‚Äôs running mate is. ive never voted in my life and will happily be voting for  for re-election!! i will be doing it in person too... no mail in voting for me.
I feel a BLUE WAVE coming on November 3rd.  We Will Vote Biden Harris to lead this country out of Trumps mess Looking for a Brighter tomorrow.
joe biden said ‚Äúdecades of Black female abolitionists‚Äô blood, sweat, and tears gaining a spoonful of the mainstream recognition they deserve? yeah, let‚Äôs undermine that, but it‚Äôs okay she‚Äôs Black‚Äù and white liberals who were saying defund the police yesterday are nutting
Has Dirty Donny thought up some new bad names to call team Biden and Harris.  I've got some great names you can use,  how about Winners. Vote Biden November 3rd.
Biden and Harris will be a great team to have in the White House. Time to get good decent smart people back in charge.  Can't wait to vote on November 3rd.
talking about candidates on this website (tm) is a bad time, but I appreciated Kamala absolutely dicing Biden during the debates &amp; him having the wherewithal to be like "yeah, I need her on my team"
President Obama notes, thusly, ‚ÄúJoe Biden nailed this decision.‚Äù
2/2 choice if Biden wanted to focus on domestic policy and sure up a progressive base. With all of that said, Kamala Harris will be a better Vice President than US AG. I believe Rice for Sec. of State and I hope we find the political will to win the senate and make Warren leader
The Obama folks from ‚Äò08 get all the fame, a podcast, tee shirts and the like. And much of that is deserved. But this Biden team, many of them old hands in Washington, has bested even the Pod Bros.
Let me be clear, I think Kamala Harris is the wrong choice for VP because of her ‚Äútough on crime‚Äù tenure as an AG in California. I thought Susan Rice was a much better choice if Biden felt like rebuilding international relations and obligations. I thought Warren was the better 1/
‚ÄúAnd that little girl was me‚Äù!
Don't say If, say When she's elected. Team Biden Harris all the way.  I will personally skip mail in voting.  I want to cast the vote in person.

Kamala Harris is just Joe Biden in a lightskin black woman swatch. Take that how you will. But that‚Äôs my feelings on this situation.
Lmaooo Biden was racist a couple months ago according to Kamala Harris. Now that she‚Äôd become president if he‚Äôs elected he‚Äôs not bad
Biden/Harris sounds more appealing than the Trump/Pence "the country we lead now is a disaster...elect us again to fix it"
And if Biden‚Äôs smart, he‚Äôs gonna go into every Southern state and loudly and openly blame Trump for it happening.
Stop worrying about football and solve the virus and the American economy depression.  This Is Your Dam Job.  Biden will have to do it when he becomes president.
It is NOT about the networks. It is about Trump claiming victory in every state he leads on election night and saying its Fraud when Biden wins due to mail ins. Dems need to make sure mail ins will be counted by election night or emphasize IN PERSON EARLY VOTING
I guess from his politics, Biden believes the world better by killing the unborn...up to the day of delivery. Scripture is clear, God is the author of life. Woe be to those who oppose the Creator of life!
Joseph R. Biden, Jr. just sent me an email entitled ‚Äúre: our historic announcement‚Äù and it‚Äôs not even about his VP selection‚ÅâÔ∏è Sir.
Something we don‚Äôt think about often enough is just how awful the 2016 Clinton campaign was at appearances and visuals, as demonstrated in this graf from today‚Äôs Times convention write-up.  Biden is running 6-7 points ahead of Hillary due, in large part, to this fact.
... Biden is gunna starve in America.
I hate Joe Biden as much as the next guy, but who in their right mind would turn down the opportunity to be the second most powerful person in the fucking world, are y‚Äôall crazy.? Y‚Äôall just really hate black women, huh?
Joe Biden is a life long liar.
In 2010 Under Biden &amp; Obama, Ronnie Lee Gardner was Executed by a firing Squad.
Could be bad news for Biden. He‚Äôs been known to do that too.

Trump is a Liar and he hopes we don't notice.  I may not be able to afford his 350 thousand admission fees for his private club, but my vote is just as valuable as any of his Rich friends.  I Will use my vote elect Biden for president on November 3rd.

The Sanders wing has scored a lot of victories in the Democratic platform‚Äîbut didn‚Äôt get all it wanted on Israel.
Maybe he didn't listen to it, he just felt like it was patriotic at first and sent it. Maybe it was an accident. Maybe he did it on purpose. He has literally never made disparaging remarks toward the black community. Ever. Joe Biden is awful.
(Of course, I‚Äôm also reminded that Biden isn‚Äôt Catholic enough for some Catholics, so there‚Äôs that)
I'm not even a biden fan but where is this energy for others?
One problem with countering the ‚ÄúBiden is anti religious‚Äù message with references to Biden‚Äôs lifelong faith is that lots of white evangelicals still don‚Äôt actually believe Catholics are Christian.
so like, if we aren't supposed to vote for biden who are we supposed to vote for..........
We're still going to vote for Joe Biden! Trump had his chance, his goose is cooked! Trump knows if he doesn't win he's going to jail! Trump is nothing but a crook and we know it ! F-Trump!
Joe Biden literally doesn‚Äôt even understand what the African American community is
I thought Trump was just BSing but then I saw this photo of a young Biden.
I'm not sure a Demo controlled senate would approve. If all Republicans voted against, it'd only need a few Democrats to vote against. I think those votes would be there, especially if Biden opposed. Cant know for sure, of course. But this is why historians need to be heard now
Wow. This has no chance of making it thru our current senate &amp; president. And I doubt Biden would sign it into law either if it comes up during his term. But this is the "slippery slope" that people warned against, and that historians need to be heard on.
If Joe Biden could decisively destroy the god worshiped by Trump‚Äôs supporters, he would be doing an inestimable service to America and the world.
How powerful does Donald Trump think Joe Biden is if he says he will ‚Äúhurt God‚Äù
When has Biden ever said he will take away guns?
Great so there‚Äôs no hope  Tho maybe if we get Biden he‚Äôll help w that? I have no hope lol
I love the context, also for clarity I don't think it's also funny in Biden's case
Will the left-leaning national media jump all over Biden for this? I know if it were Trump they would....
Did  pay you off or something?? It's gonna HURT the Biden campaign.
This grandstanding politician is going to hurt the Biden cause.  Talk about something sure to fire up the Trump base, sheesh!üî•üî•
Aye, and her grandstanding will undermine the Biden bid and generate even more support for Trump.
Biden doesn‚Äôt know how grant
If Biden followed science he would be pro life (biology) and would not put billions toward climate change given most scientists agree we don‚Äôt have enough data to justify that.
To the extent this is even coherent, his idea is that China will change when we go back to the WHO?  That‚Äôs nuts even for Biden.

If you put a gun to my head and forced me to vote for Biden or Trump, I'm voting for Trump. Not because I think he's an effective leader, or a trustworthy individual, or a good communicator, or that I even like him as a person, but BECAUSE YOU'RE PUTTING A FUCKING GUN TO MY HEAD.
Kind of like my Neighbor that had a Republican for Biden sign with my Trump Sticker I put on it. I noticed this Morning his sign is gone. That‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt put Stupid Blue Shit up in a Red Area.
Well that's kind of a problem since Project Lincoln has already pledged to support Biden's agenda in office.
Roy S Johnson: Hearing that Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris... I thought about so many bold, bad-a Black women in #Alabama who are leading, organizing, and galvanizing our political landscape.
Great VP choice Biden couldn‚Äôt do any better
Also, hell of an admission that Biden won't be able to handle "bad crap".
Also, just FTR, I did not vote for the President the last time, and I certainly won‚Äôt this time around. But I will not be voting for the Biden/Harris ticket.
The TLDR is this: I think all things being equal (i.e. mental fitness), a Harris presidency would yield more ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù outcomes than a Biden one. That‚Äôs likely more scary to me than you, but that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm coming from. (End, I guess)
This again also assumes Biden is ‚Äúall there.‚Äù Our current president is clearly unstable, but there are real concerns about Biden‚Äôs mental acuity. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs just a right-wing talking point. Biden may be subject to whomever he surrounds himself with at this point. (10)
I have a hard time seeing Biden pushing through a true Medicare for all or single payer system, but I can see Kamala doing the same. (9)
Finally, there are the reasons I think she‚Äôd be worse than Biden. Both have a horrible record on CJ so that‚Äôs a wash. But when it comes to matters of other domestic policy, I do feel Harris is more of ‚Äúthis progressive moment.‚Äù I‚Äôm going off what I saw on the trail and the past.8
Good luck with our country moving toward socialism. I am with your father, and hope he gets well. Also, wishing you well but hope you will research policies of Biden. The platform of the left is not moderate and will be the destruction of our country.
She's being used by Biden to pander to minorities and women. Smart people would see right through this and realized the Dems that have been promising he same crap for 50 yrs hasn't delivered.
Op-Ed: Kama Harris and the Growing Political Power on Black Women: In #Alabama, Black women and the Black Voters Matter Fund played pivotal roles in the election of Doug Jones to the Senate in 2017.
Trump‚Äôs pandemic is his biggest failure as president. And he doesn‚Äôt care. Biden and Harris should start speaking out every day about the pandemic specifically. Make Trump own his failure completely.
Does Kamala Harris still think Joe Biden is a racist, segregationist?  ü§î
Maybe the people who are still whining about Kamala Harris's statements about Joe Biden in debates are still stuck thinking a woman criticizing them is unforgivable.
Y‚Äôall do realize it‚Äôs either Trump or Biden.. right.. fucking vote blue.

Excited about Biden-Harris ticket. Sounds like Trump is afraid of her. He does not handle a smart, talented, assertive woman well. His misogyny will rear its ugly head. His paranoia and sadism will be activated.

Social Security is funded by payroll taxes. Trump said he‚Äôs eliminating payroll taxes if re-elected. Most people don‚Äôt understand FICA and just see the deduction on their check not realizing it funds their Social Security. So Biden‚Äôs not lying.

Yeah, China wants Biden to win so he can dominate the US again.
Biden disproportionately weakened the black nuclear family through laws he sponsored . Trump has tweeted so many things that have been questionable. I appreciate your taking the time to respond. #antiracism
2/2 one law that treated crack cocaine as significantly worse than powder cocaine and ended up disproportionately punishing African Americans. Biden‚Äôs 1994 omnibus anti-crime law is blamed for accelerating incarceration rates, especially of black men.

Not a defender of Trump. Some things you cannot defend ..Just curious do your tweets mean you‚Äôre a Biden supporter ?
Also that Biden doesn't even know it's been released, let alone had anything to do with writing, you know, the, the thing.
Trump says he will fight for ALL American citizens to have prosperity and security. Biden just talks about the blacks.
Trump claims Biden 'no longer worthy of the Black Vote' in wake of diversity comment

In order to support and vote for Biden, a documented racist at his core, they end up condoning and propagating racism with that support! - Stephen Fuller
Biden‚Äôs racism has ALWAYS been there. It‚Äôs apart of his core as a man. Yet, the Democrats continue to give him a pass! By doing so, the Democrats simply are not credible , their arguments are not valid, and they lack any standing in any serious discussion about racism.
If Biden is incapable of debating or knows he is incapable and afraid, how about at least have 3 rads (Dems) vs 3 conservatives ( Republicans) on stage for 2 hours and debate 5 major issues predetermined by national polls. 1/2

I don‚Äôt see why we have to bother with the song and dance every time. Everyone knows where they stand on Trump / Biden by now. Why is either side even running ads? Why do we have to go through the pantomime of like... fucking... debates, and shaking hands and kissing babies...
could we please listen to something/someone other than Joe Biden??? If I wanted to listen to CNN, I‚Äôd have turned on CNN. Dead air would be preferable.
Biden really ain‚Äôt said shit the whole time he been on this tv.
Joe Biden is just awful. I can‚Äôt believe   are actually putting this man on their ticket.
So Biden would reverse Trump‚Äôs reversals of Obama‚Äôs actions?
Let me be clear on this.   The Trump Campaign will not attack Joe Biden as much now. They will turn their attacks on Kamala Harris. This camp sees her as a dangerous threat and will treat her like she is the one leading the ticket. Mark my words.   KHive, let‚Äôs get to work.
This must mean   must be the one paying out of her own pocket. She may be too busy on her knees to campaign. Maybe Wang has bought her like he did Biden with the 1.5 billion. Jamaica could use the money from Harris.
Republicans for Joe Biden AKA democrats in disguise.
Afternoons on WVNN - LT Discusses the Benefits of Kamala Harris as Biden's Running Mate - 8-12-20  via
WATCH NOW: Democratic nominee Joe Biden formally announces Kamala Harris as his 2020 running mate.
Sadly, there are still quite a few Americans who believe Joe Biden can make a difference as President, after doing nothing for them for 47 years
Surely you‚Äôd agree that Biden being Obama‚Äôs VP is the biggest reason he won the nom this year. Hard to imaging Pence ever being the nominee but chances are much higher as VP.
Joe Biden can't remember who he was told to pick
You're for Biden and Harris, and they've been lying to you for decades
Conservatives are saying if Biden is elected he will raise taxes &amp; destroy the economy. Ignoring the fact that this is a tragically laughable comment, I would like any conservative to explain to me how much worse the economy could be than it is now. At least for non-billionaires.
No doubt soon as they get in she‚Äôs gona put Biden in a home and take over as president.

you been watching Biden trying to find his way out of this basement
My point it that we have to focus on getting them in. We can do that AND address their shortcomings, but getting them in is priority 1. Obama wasn‚Äôt progressive but we made progress on which, with Biden, we can build on. Was it everything, no. But it was a good step.
Biden should debate when Trump produces his Tax returns
I won‚Äôt argue that slow progress can is frustrating. But we are making slow progress and we need to keep at it. We cannot allow further regression from the Trump administration. We have no hope of progress with them. At least with Biden and Harris, we‚Äôve got a shot.
I understand why it‚Äôs hard to vote for Biden and Harris.   I also know we will all perish if he stays in office.  So, can we just, all, like, collectively  agree to live longer?  I beg.
Yep. I agree. It‚Äôs Trump vs Kamala now, knowing full well Biden can‚Äôt physically or mentally perform the daily functions of the President. I mean the guy is struggling to communicate.
Damn sounds like the same family values as the Biden's

And y‚Äôall wanna vote for Kanye because Biden/Harris is ‚Äúgonna put everyone in jail‚Äù. #wakeup
Add all of this with Biden's baggage and I have less of reason to vote for Biden.
Hunter and joe Biden ?
I‚Äôm confused at why it‚Äôs ok to be ignorant of what‚Äôs she done just because she‚Äôs black. Even if we vote for Biden/Harris don‚Äôt we have a right to be informed about who‚Äôs being put in office? People are ok with any standard now and that‚Äôs scary
Well...Kamala embraced Willie‚Äôs willie. But did CNN have a headline about that? ‚ÄúBiden picks Kamala Harris, who previously had an affair with the married Mayor of SF and slept her way to the top‚Äù
This video alone will cause Biden and Harris to lose
Interestingly enough, neither #BlackLivesMatter or #MeToo have anything to say about Kamala Barris or Joe Biden.....   I woulda thought "believing Biden's accusers, and being descended from a slave owning family, would've stirred some sort of emotional reaction
Excited about a Biden / Harris ticket !!
I think we get him elected and then push. His policy/action is superior to Trump‚Äôs in every way, so I think the focus right now needs to get Biden elected. Then I think we can press hard for progress. Not ideal, but the alternative is Trump.
Oh I have no issues with criticizing the left people. None at all. I just think that we also need to, despite those criticisms, encourage people to vote for him. Biden wasn‚Äôt my choice at all. Neither was Harris. But this ticket can win and we need to support it.
Also biden and kamala proves the democrats are still not listening, still don't give a fuck about progress and will absolutely let the entire country burn go keep that status quo. Bc those 2 don't give a damn about no change man lol
- you publicly stated you believed and supported the women who accused Joe Biden of sexual assault - now you are with him?? You also said he was a racist?? Should call you "QUEEN FLIP FLOPP" - anything for power - right girl?
I will not be voting for Biden (nor Trump) in this presidential election. The DNC has let us know for the last time that they don't give a crap what their constituents or the US want by selecting Kamala Harris as the VP pick. I know when to get out of an abusive relationship.
You're not selling me on Biden, if that's your goal. I am voting Green b/c they are offering Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, and substantive criminal justice reform like reallocating police funds to community funds. To convince me to vote D, offer the same or better.
A president should have judgement, Biden exhibited failed judgement in this crucial moment. That's all.
I‚Äôm so very happy! Biden-Harris is a winning combination and you can see that the GOP are terrified! It‚Äôs glorious to watch them squirm. They all need to wear diapers now.
I think it's important to ask ourselves why we, as individuals, feel the former is futile. Consider when you have ever met an enthusiastic Joe Biden voter. Consider that ~40% of the eligible voters stayed home in the 2016 general. Is it math? Or is it something else?
Yes to optics.  I don't care for a lot of Harris' positions, but she's better than Palin.  Minimally when ABC interviews her, it won't be a train wreck.  And did Biden ever have a younger base?  Was anyone of any age ever excited about his run?
Mr. Biden would like to have a word with you, Bishop.
Well, Harris is aligned with most of Biden's positions, it's just that being a centrist is uninspiring, arguably unethical, and clearly not what any of us wanted. But yeah no reform for us.
No.  Joe Biden voted for the Iraq war, voted for NAFTA, and authored the racist crime bill. Kamala Harris positively laughed at the thought of locking up the parents of truant children and fought to make sure that evidence that would free an innocent man was kept hidden.
Depending on the polls. If close, will hold my nose &amp; vote Biden/Harris. If not, will vote Green or do a write-in. Will try &amp; focus on who to vote for down-ballot. Priority is now non-electoral politics.
On top of just accusing Biden of being racist, rapist, and pro-segregation just a few months ago? Lmao that shit is hilarious
So? Debate skills are not necessary as evidenced by Trump &amp; Biden to achieve where they are now. There will be so many more rules in this debate not like the unstructured &amp; lopsided DNC debates.
Trump is gonna kick his old wrinkley butt. Its a joke actually. Compare them really. Its a no brainer. Biden is history. No one I mean no one in their right mind will vote for him. There is not that many stupid people here in the US. Its getting close but no.
It‚Äôs an of guard picture, taken at the right moment and no context, used by a lot of trolls and bots to try and discredit Joe Biden. They been doing this since Obama was pres. Heres one of Trump with his preteen daughter looking like she‚Äôs twerking on him
Ha ha, she was chosen by the DNC and Biden had to play along. She‚Äôs full of crap just like him. They pander to anyone for a vote.
Trump is a racist joe Biden is a little less racist - y‚Äôall
All right, ready to convince the first person... joe Biden?! Uh oh.
Biden actually needs our votes and elected to nominate a ‚Äútough-on-crime‚Äù DA in the midst of protests for police accountability. You think he‚Äôll care once he‚Äôs in power?
It riles up the base and it informs those who are politically ignorant because they don‚Äôt pay any attention that Biden is a racist, which they may or may not care about.   This won‚Äôt change the minds of liberals who were OK with him raping a woman though.
LoL actually Trump and Barr would just write up a report that said Democrats interfered in the election because China and üôà [I‚Äôm just gonna pick another] Iran wanted Biden to win and would launch an investigation into that and hold hearings and appoint US attorneys etc.
If Wall Street is glad Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris, where does that put all of the leftist "occupy Wall Street" folks?
Where's #MeToo now that Joe Biden is the Presidential Nominee?  Will Madonna want to blow up the WH if he wins?
Good so we agree that Biden is creepy. Better than being a confirmed rapist I guess.
All you need to know about Kamala Harris  1) Believed Biden's accusers 2) Called Biden out for supporting segregation when she was in school 3) Is descended from a slave owning family 4) The pilot of AF2 will radio the tower with "heels up" when taking off
How Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris: Inside the history-making VP pick
Don‚Äôt forget about the batshit Barr report about Biden‚Äôs son or something that will drop in October!
Sounds like 2012. But it was for Paul Ryan. And his VP opponent? Biden. And Biden "won" that debate.
I wonder: What will the Dems and Biden/Harris do if/when Trump attacks them from the left?
Photo Gallery: Meet Biden‚Äôs VP choice Kamala Harris
So define success for a guy like Joe Biden? Is he successful? Is it because he was elected each time? You don‚Äôt know Trump or Biden personally you just hate or love because someone told you to.  Be honest with yourself. What policies are you for or is orange man bad enough?
Regardless of how you feel about Biden, we need to vote for Biden because the next president will replace RBG. We don‚Äôt want another Brett Kavanaugh.
Harris will be the end of Biden's campaign. Like when McCain picked Sarah Pailin
Unlikable Biden just picked one of the least likeable presidential candidates that democrats didn't even pick for the nomination, and now you want us to believe this is the winning ticket?ü§£ü§£ü§£ get the fuqouttahea!
&lt;shiver&gt;   And I‚Äôm arguing with a black dude in the military right now saying he‚Äôs voting for Kanye and fuck Joe Biden because his portfolio has been constantly increasing.
It's still true. I'm not going to pretend that Kamala Harris and Joe Biden are something that they're not. They're not progressive, they're not for the people, they're not an inspiration, they're a stop-gap. I voted Democrat for the last time; I won't be doing it again.
Ok..... But she's the VP pick. Biden does not oppose fracking.
Even Biden himself is doing it, the you ain‚Äôt Black comment for example - More Black people would be willing to vote for him if he had simply said nothing at all than trying to shame or guilt them into supporting him.   People really dont like being told they have no choice Lol
I think its about the fence, people can hate Trump, but having your own community treat you like youre dumb if you dont 100% agree or you dont see Biden as much better, or any opinion that isnt get Trump out at all costs - those are votes that could be had if they werent off put
Mr. Terrell, thank you for sharing your view about Biden's running mate.
If you vote for Biden, you support a racist segregationist.....  If you accept the nomination from a racist segregationist, you're desperate
Politics is all about persuasion though, and the way some of your tweets come off may make people want to double down on how they feel about Biden and Harris.   It lends itself to the same feelings of hopelessness and lack of choice that cause people not to bother voting at all
When I think of all the great people Biden/Harris have to choose from when replacing Trumps cronies, i get giddy with joy!   Warren, Beto, Buttigieg, Abrams, Col. Vindman, Yovanovitch, and more!
These replies treating Kamala like Paul Ryan in 2012(v Biden btw, who actually won that debate) even though we seen Tulsi already drag Kamala on a debate stage this year.
Maybe educate yourself on what the "National Debt" actually is.  44 increased the ND over 10 trillion, much of that became laundered money to elites. 44 and certain people in Congress were given millions. Thats how Biden got his millions.
Hey leftists form a real opinion instead of telling us what you heard about on the news Trumps not racist but Joe Biden and kamala Harris both are racist and flip floppy morons don't believe me I encourage you to look it all up yourself there's plenty of documentation üòâ
Taylor Swift is out here telling people about Biden unifying America, when literally every song she sings is about a guy who won‚Äôt unify with her.   And my wife will confirm, I don‚Äôt dislike her music. I just find it ironic.
Talk yo shit but remember this Biden/Harris ticket is what we voting for come November.
Obama &amp; Biden were Spying &amp; Lying. #MAGA2020Landslide #TrumpPence2020
Biden can not come out at night. Dementia,Sundowners Syndrome cause behaviors to escalate, such as mood changes, anger, crying, fear and wandering. Sundowning is thought to be triggered by fading light. The symptoms can get worse as the night goes on and usually better by morning
Can't Wait for Kamala to make "MinceMeat" of Phoney Mike in a debate.   #returnsanityvoteJoe
It is not up to Biden. DNC only is interested in corporate donors and big dark money.
Kamala Harris just single handedly changed the slogan from "Ridin with Biden" to "Ridin Biden"
So you‚Äôve finally come to terms with the truth about Biden.
If the country wanted a black woman for president then Joe Biden wouldn‚Äôt have won the democratic primary ü§î.  She isn‚Äôt qualified. This should be entertaining
How are we supposed to believe anything Kamala says if she can't even stand by her own statements that Joe Biden is a racist sexual predator?
Of course joe Biden would pick the fucking cop as his running mate.
I think Biden knows he doesn‚Äôt stand chance so he picked a Non starter
Ryan Knight is actually looking out for the people, which is more than Crime Bill Biden and Cop Kamala can say. Let's not try to rewrite history here. Biden is racist and has shown that many times, and Kamala isn't much better. They're better than Trump, and that's it.
Imagine all this shit with police and protests and riots happening and then Biden ‚Äúchooses‚Äù Kamala Harris that was Indian-American and now is African American to be VP...... the Democrats cannot get more stupid.
I may vote for Biden/Kamala, but I foolishly hope her earlier criticisms of Biden about racism and sexually predatory behavior were sincere. These are issues affecting everyday lives, and it just kinda seems like it was reduced to a political attack.
Today is a horrible day for the USA.  was added to  crazy ticket.  Folks, if you vote these two into office your next president won‚Äôt be Joe Biden...it‚Äôs a vote for #kamala because Biden is mentally compromised.  #VoteTrump2020
I do not think Biden would be a good President.
Ordered my yard sign and a bunch of other Biden/Harris swag, not that my neighbors have any doubts with the  yard sign and the  bumper sticker. Gotta make a bold statement when you're a blue voter in Alabama!
Completely agree with the Senate races. However, as an Alabama voter, what incentive do I have to vote for Biden/Harris?
She believes Biden‚Äôs sexual assault accusers but happily joins him as his running mate. She has zero morals and would blow anyone to further her career.
Thank you Team Joe and the Biden Camp for making this happen. Now that you have us, we‚Äôre going to the White House. üíõüêùüíõ
In one sentence you complain about Kamala being disrespectful to Joe Biden, and in the same sentence you call him‚Äùsleepy joe.‚Äù Projection anyone? Can you say misogyny?
This. Warren was my top pick for the Democratic ticket but you know what? She was one among many who would make a great President. So I‚Äôll be proud to support the Biden/Harris ticket and in the future Harris for President. Let‚Äôs #SaveTheRepublic and vote #BidenHarris2020 Nov 3rd!
I love Warren, but Harris is a solid pick, and I'm going to hang my Biden/Harris shirt next to my Persist shirt and wear the heck out of both. If Warren could be gracious and supportive today so can everybody else.
Jill Biden picks Kamala Harris as VP. There, fixed it for you.
Biden never had a chance in the first place between his comments on black people and Trump
In an effort to even the playing field, Barron Trump will debate Joe Biden
So Biden/Harris is worse than Trump/Pence????  I‚Äôm willing to listening!  No one has ever explained it to me so please inform me so I won‚Äôt be confused.
I don‚Äôt know what is happening locally in Seattle. So you‚Äôll have to discuss that with someone familiar with that overall. In any case, it doesn‚Äôt matter. It still doesn‚Äôt change the fact that we need to elect Biden.
Democrats know their constituents have the attention span of a gnat, so remembering something like this will definitely be forgotten
I‚Äôm not voting for Biden, but every time I see a Republican claim that Biden/Hariis is far-left, it makes me want to vote for them a tad bit more than I previously did...
I don‚Äôt want any gear with Biden‚Äôs name on it.   Just put K A M A L A across the chest on a fitted black tee, pls.
Serious question didn‚Äôt she come out and say we must believe the sexual assault accusations made by Mr. Biden‚Äôs accuser. Something about women must be believed. Just wondering what changed her mind so fast
Legitimately, probably Warren, who‚Äôs CFPB plan Biden also fought üòî
Biden just really solidified his win by choosing Kamala üòÇ
So what KH debates better. Do debates really count??? As evidenced by Trump &amp; Biden
Also, Biden himself has hinted at being a one-termer and anointing his VP as future leader of the party, so while it might have mattered less before, this one is much more determinant.
I believe the effect will be neutral in votes. My point being - debates - so what? Trump &amp; Biden are not the best debaters - that quality did not get them in top spots. And so what if KH is a top notch debater? More security - could be in order...
More accurately, Biden found out today which running mate the DNC chose for him.
Liz Warren is so pissed right now. She raised 3 times of Kamala. All for Joe Biden to drool on himself.
So her accusing Biden of being racist and pro-segregation just doesn‚Äôt mean shit because she‚Äôs pro UBI... MAKE IT MAKE SENSE LMAO WEAK
In case you're wondering, YES, the Biden/Harris merch is already up on the campaign store, and YES I'm going to get some after dinner.  needs a t-shirt. :)
Aight here me out. Hard Knocks type show but following the speech writers for Biden‚Äôs campaign
All jokes aside, I seriously can‚Äôt think of two living people more responsible for the overcriminalization of disadvantaged minorities than Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.   This ticket, with everything going on right now, is peak irony.   #KamalaHarrisForVP  #JoeBiden
I'm glad that's settled. Get me a yard sign for Biden AND Harris, and let's get on with winning the whole show in November. FIGHT FOR EVERY SEAT IN EVERY RACE IN EVERY STATE. Leave no GOP enabler in office.
But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs immediate. People have been not wanting her as a candidate and I‚Äôm not here for Biden at all. Will I still vote for them yes but I don‚Äôt think they are vastly different than a lot of the current administration, they just aren‚Äôt as loud or crass about it
Love this! Her theology must be vibrant and inclusive. She will be able to speak faith language to different groups of people. Good on Biden! Are you excited by this choice?
So if Biden is elected we will have to learn Chinese *and* French?  Cool.

Don‚Äôt think Susan Rice won‚Äôt be in an active and visible role in a Biden administration.  State dept, probably.
Stacey Abrams was not picked for Joe Biden's running mate because....voter suppression!!!
Yeeeeeah this is when it gets murky, innit. Harris, Biden, Trump, and Pence have all done things that are morally/ socially/political unacceptable. I don't think any should be representative. Obviously some more than others. But we need change, and we won't get it immediately.
To be fair, that's pretty much exactly what they're saying about Biden too. Sounds like a couple of moderates to me.
Right now it‚Äôs about preventing further regression. The Trump admin is hellbent on stripping LGBTQ+ and women‚Äôs health rights. They are filling the SCOTUS and lower courts with conservative justices...this can have an impact for generations. We have to vote Biden.
How y‚Äôall feel about Kamala Harris as Biden running mate?
Yes, I don‚Äôt think Rice has an ambition to be president. That said I think she would make a good one since she is very smart and very tough. If Biden gets elected I have no doubt she will be appointed Secretary of State.
Wrong!  I know of NO women who favors Biden- Heels up Kamala- resume the position that got you were you are - you passed the sniff test- Don't blow it üë†üë†üë†üë†ü§£
Joe Biden clearly picked Kamala Harris as tribute to recently fallen pro wrestler Kamala. That is what I choose to believe.
Honestly, it can‚Äôt matter right now. We have to stop Trump. I know it‚Äôs frustrating, but we have to vote for Biden and encourage others to do so as well. The future of this country depends on it.

Being a one issue voter (defund police) is a bad idea. Similar to people who vote republican just because of abortion. You aren‚Äôt ever going to agree with everything, but Biden and Harris are clearly far more capable of managing our govt than the damn circus that‚Äôs there now.
Democratic Party Presidential Ticket! Biden/Harris Congratulations! #JoeBiden #KamalaHarris
You do understand that defunding does not mean eliminate police forces and take all of their money right? And getting Trump out is the MOST important thing. We cannot go on like this. It is unethical to do anything but vote for Biden.
I, personally, am very excited about Kamala Harris as VP, more excited than I was about Biden as president (tbh, I wasn‚Äôt all that excited, not at all).
If Joe Biden didn‚Äôt want me to vote  all that‚Äôs all he had to say.
Don‚Äôt be like this. I don‚Äôt think anyone is thrilled but we NEED Trump out of office. We can squabble about getting an ideal candidate next time. In Nov, it has to be Biden and Harris. Please just encourage voting, let‚Äôs get Trump out, and move forward.

Afternoons on WVNN - LT Discusses How Biden's Campaign Will Do Anything to Keep Him Out of the Pre...  via
Those who say that Biden's VP has to have Presidential skills, because Biden's only doing one term, never bring up the name Andrew Cuomo. Why? Not progressive enough? What we NEED is leadership for difficult times ahead.
The most progressive healthcare platform is false. Hillary Clinton I think wanted to lower the Medicare age to 55. Joe Biden's having a hard time lowering it to 60. So Joe Biden is to the right of Hillary Clinton on health care.
I think Biden and Stelter share the same brain.
In any event. I am not voting for Joe Biden. Nothing you say will get me to vote for Joe Biden. If that upsets you, take that energy and direct it at the Democratic national committee tell them that they lost a voter because they rejected single-payer Medicare for all.
If you insist on using poor logic: every minute you are not making phone calls for Joe Biden is a minute that you're making phone calls for Donald Trump. And every dollar you're not donating to Joe Biden is a dollar you're donating to Donald Trump.
I did not say that Trump was worse than Biden. It's pretty difficult to find any ways that Joe Biden is superior to Donald Trump. And I can think of a few ways where Biden is actually worse. But from my view they're both irredeemably awful candidates. That will never get my vote.
I think what you're trying to say is that Donald Trump has a small and enthusiastic base of support while Joe Biden has zero enthusiasm or support. The fewer people that vote for Biden brings us one step closer to the very small enthusiastic base overwhelming Bidens votes.
You don't have to. Have you ever met an enthusiastic Joe Biden voter? There's more than enough people who are non-voters and unenthusiastic Democratic voters to vote for the Green Party and have them win by a landslide. Last election 40% of the people didn't vote.
To spell this out:   Joe Biden says: "Don't settle" and yet "Settle For Biden" exists, unironically.  This is hypocrisy. And absurdity. And comedy. And tragedy.
Fair. A lot of people feel that way. My question (again, with respect and love) is: a) Name one crisis that is facing 10s of millions of US citizens today, then b) explain how, in policy, and in strategy to implement said policy a Biden admin will fight tooth &amp; nail to solve it.
My hope would be the things that have nothing to do with policy or qualifications would be subdued once this process is over from our own side, like with Biden, but I know that‚Äôs just wishful thinking.
The whole world would prefer Joe Biden   Signed,  üåè
America needs Joe Biden.
He‚Äôs in Biden basement.
On top of that, Biden is the presumptive nominee who will soon be declared as an official Democratic Presidential Nominee. The delegates are in a landslide for Biden so that shouldn‚Äôt be a problem for him to make his official announcement. I‚Äôm just impatient at this point. Haha.
MSNBC has reported that the Biden VP announcement will come as early as today.   Brace yourselves for a day of uncertainty. Today isn‚Äôt in the bag.
Lol, Biden is the one not wanting to debate. His campaign people don't want him to either.
Don‚Äôt worry Ben, white people will be just fine. Even if Biden is elected.
The Biden controllers will most likely select Susan Rice to be his VP She has the most to hide in the protection of Obama, and will be untouchable as long as she is a candidate
talk about the pot calling the kettle black do yall hear yourself sometime time even I believe  biden mind is fucked everything the radio host said where true and we all see biden mental health problems but for some reason you think cause he is riding a bike he is mental fit lol

Even before all of this, I was never too fond of her being a successor behind Biden. I don‚Äôt feel comfortable with someone with too many question marks on his/her resume. Not to be disrespectful but she doesn‚Äôt have that fire to energize an unenthusiastic voter at best.
This is simply sad.  Biden should be in retirement.  Shame on the DNC for not finding a better candidate.  This guy has serious health concerns.
That's very good of you to protect your members. Wish Biden was held to the same standard.
Yeah... that makes Obama/Biden look even worse.
This is the kind of silly trash the Left pushes, and their "woke" sheeple believe itü§£ü§£

Exactly. I did not vote for Hillary in 2016 because as soon as I learned she voted for the Iraq war, she was disqualified. I Will not vote for Joe Biden for the exact same reason. He voted for the Iraq war. He's disqualified.Is it true that Gov Kemp can choose different electors if Biden wins GA?
Thank you  and right back at ya!
But, does he have the FBI and Intelligence agencies spying on Biden's campaign? Are the falsifying evidence to impeach Sleepy Joe if he gets elected? Asking for a friend...

My dog is definitely smarter than Milano!! And also Obama, Biden, Harris, Hillary and Schiff!!
I'm going to call it: IF Biden wins he's then going to say due to his declining health he can't be president and the vice president will have to take over. This the only way I think that democrat can get a female president in the white house without a election.
She can‚Äôt but she already sold her soul. Biden has proved he is a racist for over 4 decades.

Joe Biden gives political speeches from his home. Doesn't the President live in the White House? So he's giving a convention speech from his home, right? I don't see a difference.
So I guess Biden Isn't a racist now? #Debates #She #Said #It
Biden ...good bye!!!
So therefore 1: Jorgensen 0: Biden 0: Trump
So you‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs better to vote for Biden who‚Äôs receiving millions than Jorgensen who‚Äôs received 4000 ok

If we had an honest media Biden would be polling at about 30% or less. Only the far left extremist would be supporting him.
SISTER HARRIS YOUR MOTHER LIVES IN YOUR HEART,SHE'S ALWAYS WITH YOU &amp; PROTECTING YOU!!!! SHE IS VERY PROUD OF YOU AS I AM!! DON'T LET ANYONE DICTATE TO YOU WHAT YOU CAN AND CAN'T DO!! YOU ARE A CHILD OF GOD!! YOU ARE STRONG, BRILLIANT!! YOU WILL HELP BRO. BIDEN WIN THIS ELECTION
didnt Biden screw it up worse? And he is supposed to be her partner.
this is a nuanced and divisive issue and ppl are making good points on why you should or should not vote for the biden/harris ticket. but this thread is very relevant.
I mean, at least Biden is going after swing states. Hillary couldn't be assed to speak to the plebs, as there were rich donors to talk to.
Is it really easy? Tucker is easy. Commala is a bit more of a challenge. But don't throw shade when biden can't do it correctly.  Plus I bet a dollar biden screws it again.

Biden is counting on folks like you who are ill informed. Please dig deeper for the truth. I know it is difficult to find because the MSM is biased. The democrat party wants to send the innocent preborn to death and that is horrific.
Lee also trots out the socialist straw man but Biden and most Democrats are not socialists. If they were, Biden would not be the nominee.

Within minutes of the presumptive Democratic nominee's announcement Tuesday, false information was circulating on social media, claiming that Harris had called Biden a "racist" and that she is not eligible to be president.
BIDEN WILL NOT MAKE IT FOR THE NEXT 4 YEARS!!üò± HE'S ALREADY HAD A BRAIN STROKE! LOOK IN HIS EYES!
...the fact we have to pick between two different scum bags should say enough about the current state of our nation. A lot of people are supporting Biden just so Trump isn‚Äôt the president anymore, and I the homophobic and racist isn‚Äôt from the actual person but their policies.
Wow cannot believe Im about to have to block so many WHITE people for immediately being pieces of shit after Kamala was picked as the VP. Im all in for the Biden/Harris ticket
I mean, that‚Äôs a big reason why I personally don‚Äôt like Biden. So to say that the reasons he‚Äôs ‚Äúdemonized‚Äù are not based in truth is very shortsighted and letting your bias cloud your judgement. There are many legit reasons to dislike Biden, just like trump. More so for Trump tho
She‚Äôs so nasty, damn good choice. Until she dropped out she was getting this 69 year old southern white boys vote. I‚Äôm damned proud Joe picked her. Great choice!!!! She could be President and It shows Biden‚Äôs good judgement.
know Joe Biden ad sierra club.
Are you crazy.  He was not the one to get sued for housing discrimination you and your father were!!!! enough said . joe biden black voter not you!!!!!!
I applaud Shaun King for supporting Biden and Harris. Putting aside your personal feelings for the greater good (Defeating Trump) is what we all need.
From the start, some Biden advisers saw Harris as a logical choice. She was among the party's most popular figures, a deft debater and a fundraising juggernaut.
She‚Äôs going to bat for the idea that women are capable and qualified, not necessarily for Biden.
No centrist would want Biden or Trump. Honestly both are just serving their corporate donors and not the people.
I'll vote for trump or not at all tbh. I was grudgingly voting for Biden after he was picked by the DNC (not the american people) to be the nominee. Now Harris was only wanted by Wall Street, not voters.   Its shameful to think Biden will be any different from Trump as president.

Bernie lost the progressive vote as soon as he bent the knee for Biden and gave up everything he stood for.
Sadly they know that progressives will grudgingly vote Biden so they chose Harris specifically as a slap in the face to progressive views instead of shoring up the vote. They already know their eggs are in one basket and want to stomp out all the resistance to their corruption
Honestly if you are a progressive, neither Biden nor Trump will give you anything that you want and they want you to lose hope.
is very much against the people. The Kamala pick was also just another slap in the face to any progressive who tries to convince themselves that Biden is even a little bit forward thinking with the likes of Warren or Sanders whispering in his ear.
Thoughts on Kamala VP Pick: Biden is absolutely just a figure head with no real policies that he has other than whatever Wall street tells him to do. So with Kamala being his VP, her policy will ultimately dictate his. She has a shitty history from when she was a prosecutor &amp; 1/2
Kamala Harris, congratulations but how are you voting on take our guns away when blacks are killing blacks,#1 crime in America always to this day. You and Biden are a joke,leave our country and know what opressions about,from a white God Fearing loving man that despises you
Congrats on becoming Biden's running partner. #KamalaHarrisForVP
After reflection and a quick informal social media review concerning Biden's choice of Kamala Harris, I have determined that people who weren't going to vote for Biden still aren't and people who supported Biden still do.
So tell me Rick, you voting for Biden this year? Really? You are going to support a candidate who believes its ok to murder babies in the womb?

Biden needs to watch his food and drinks...it would be just terrible if someone slipped him something...
Mama doesn‚Äôt like Pence being alone with women, so Biden can chaperone.
Not crazy about her but then I don't like anyone.  She was the obvious pick when Biden said he would pick a minority woman. Her primary performance was underwhelming, she won't add her state to Biden column, but she will help secure black voters and progressives.
Congratulations President Trump‚Ñ¢ on Candidate Joe Biden's¬© naming of Kamala Harris¬Æ as V.P. pick.
He legit thinks they just named Kamala from the 80s WWF as Biden's VP.  Also, apropos of nothing, my phone tried to change Biden to Vixen, so I think my phone is drunk.
I‚Äôm excited for Kamala Harris. Biden is still CREEPY AF but I‚Äôll take my chance with him.
That's exactly what the debate will be like...Biden will be given the questions and his staff will put the answers on cue cards!!!
Ronna, I truly don't believe Biden could make it for 4 years!! I'm serious!
ü§îWell, Well, Well, between Biden saying "they gonna  put y'all back  in chains" and Kamala changing the way she speaks in front of black audiences, We have a COMPLETE RACISTS COCKTAIL!!üò±üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Seriously tho, Kamala Harris? The woman that has made a fucking fortune on the false imprisonments of minorities? The woman that has ‚Äúbacked the blue‚Äù since it was a ‚Äústance‚Äù. This is who everyone is proud of Joe Biden for picking? YGMFU.

Joe Biden has just named Kamala Harris as his VP running mate. Now it‚Äôs time to really work and get this man to stop raging crazy stuff end get him in that White House

JUST IN: Joe Biden has decided on his running mate: Sen. Kamala Harris.

The more we talk the more I think you‚Äôre just here to push people away from Biden and towards Trump
Yeah well no he doesn‚Äôt shows your lack of research
Biden lost the candidacy in 2016 to a person who then lost to Trump its hugely egotistical of him for un and steal votes from Jo. You see how that logic works out?
1. She gets into the debates and destroys Trump and Biden and wins in a landslide
How have I shown this by not voting for Biden?
I‚Äôm not trying to rationalize anything I think you‚Äôre mad because there‚Äôs a candidate better than Biden
Biden and Trump are and I support neither
No you‚Äôre right but continuing corporate subsidies, continuing the war in the Middle East, gun control, continuing the war on drugs, continuing the militarization of the police and many other things are impossible enough for me to not vote for Biden or Trump
Mathematically she can though she‚Äôs on enough ballots to hit 270 so let‚Äôs get her on the debate stage then Trump and Biden can prove why they are the better candidate
You keep saying that but ya know I just don‚Äôt believe it maybe you should keep repeating it over and over instead of providing a reason for me to vote for Biden other than he‚Äôs not Trump
I wouldn‚Äôt vote for Biden anyways I‚Äôm not siphoning votes from anyone and if you believe I am then you‚Äôre admitting that Jo‚Äôs policies are better than Biden‚Äôs but #BlueNoMatterWho ammiright
And it‚Äôs not supporting trump because Biden and nobody else is entitled to your vote
I like to hear your plan on this Pandemic not some babble about Joe Biden.

Ah, so it‚Äôs the Russians putting out all of those Trump signs in yards and all of the Trump flags I see everywhere AND it must be the Russians organizing all of the Trump flotillas everywhere AND that would explain why I have seen 0 Biden anything anywhere!! THE RUSSIANS!!!!

IF WE LET TRUMP SAY AND DO THE THINGS THAT HE DOES AND SAY ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE AND GET AWAY WITH IT!!!! THEN WHY IN THE HELLLLLLLLLLLLWHEN VP BIDEN SAY ONE THING THAT SOUND OFF THE TRACK SOME TROUBLE MAKERS WANTS TO LYNCH HIM!!! YES WE HAVE LET TRUMP DESTROY AMERICA AND IT'S VALUE

Ok young ppl learn something here. NYT is smart, they know a moderate will win so they try to paint kamala as a moderate when her and biden are literally out, trying to get the progressive vote.... i mean why doesnt the Nyt report that.. bc it would show reality..
Biden is much better that the nut job in the oval office today .
That was easy to see... i wonder if she still thinks Biden is racist and a womanizer???
Get caught up with the morning's top headlines, the national weather forecast, today's celebrity birthdays and more.
Thanks for the genuine question. Even though I oppose most of the Democrats' program, I don't think the Republic can take four more years of a lawless president.   And I believe a conservative Senate can keep Biden's wilder left-wing ideas in check.

A vote for Biden is a vote for trump too
I been fuckin said this shit.  How tf ppl gon say no vote is a vote for Trump when a vote for Biden is still a bite for Trump. I‚Äôm facts it‚Äôs worse, because it shows a willingness

RIght! Which is why she's behind Medicare for All and Biden's tax increase.  Geez, tell me a better lie.
She is just like Biden. She says and does whatever she is told to.
I say this bc Harris and Pence can form coherent sentences whereas Trump and Biden struggle to do so

Over the last four years, we've been trying to keep this administration from taking us back to the 1920s &amp; 1950s. When Biden wins, we'll be telling his administration not to take us back to the bad policies around policing during the 1990s. We're gonna keep organizing &amp; fighting.

Harris,¬†a 55-year-old first-term senator, will be the first Black woman to compete on a major party's presidential ticket.
I felt Biden should pick Kamala for a bunch of reasons but the most obvious ones to me: 1. Should do very well in VP debate.  2. Potentially opens up a Senate seat for Katie Porter. 3. Sets Kamala up for 2024 nominee with a win.
Kamala Harris is Biden VP running mate.

So this silly screed about Biden isn‚Äôt any surprise. It‚Äôs full of holes but there‚Äôs stuff there that the Limbaughfied GOP will love. Hillyer wouldn‚Äôt get away with much of what he‚Äôs written if those Trumper types hadn‚Äôt been built over the decades.

That is a sticking point with me, but I find Trump to be as close to an anti-Christ figure in 2020 as I can think of for a multitude of reasons that I'm going to give Joe Biden the win. Trump is pro-life only as far as courting anti-abortion voters. ProLife is much more than that

Everyone of you liberals have to cuss on some point of your tweet. Does that help get your point across? Oh and your an ass hat.  Prove that Obama and Biden did anything positive for our military or for our country for that matter.
I've a deep blue acquaintance who said years ago emphatically  emphasizing his political persuasion, "I'd vote for Mickey Mouse if he were a Democrat!" He told me after Biden's VP pick, that he's voting Trump. But he said Gretchen, Newsom &amp; weeks of Portland, sealed his decision.
how can Kamala Harris simultaneously call Joe Biden a racist, and a rapist, the two worst names you can be as a white man, then run as his VP üòÇ the democrats are such a joke ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
And that‚Äôs your view. My whole point is about not voter shaming people. I disagree with you, but I‚Äôm not like if you vote for Biden then you‚Äôre voting for all the wars hes perpetuated, the racist systems he‚Äôs fought to uphold, and etc.
Dems say that EVERY YEAR. ‚ÄúIf this were a regular election‚Äù. I‚Äôm not debating you on if Trump is a fascist. He is, but it is counterproductive to tell people ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt vote for Biden, you‚Äôre voting for Trump and everything he does‚Äù. And lmk when Alabama turns blue lmao.
&amp; likely future president...what are the odds Biden makes it to '24?
Those peoples‚Äô votes aren‚Äôt going to matter anyways. What‚Äôs the point in voter shaming someone who lives in a safe republican state that Trump won by 20+ points? There‚Äôs absolutely no point. It‚Äôs a waste of breath. If it‚Äôs a swing state, sure vote for Biden. But that‚Äôs not
Something that really gets me is the extreme views from both sides regarding what could happen if one candidate gets elected over the other. The country is not going to end if Trump gets reelected and neither will it end if Biden becomes president. It will just look different.
Not voting bc you dont like the option of biden or kamala is equivalent to voting for trump!   Those are our options, go vote.
I dont think so. I think there are enough republicans who are dis associating themselves from Trump and voting Biden as a one time deal. They wont ever be Democrats. They will be what keeps the party in check or the split will cause a new party. We are due for that historically.
Exactly! Sure I don't believe everything that Biden says or will do but I believe he has the character we need in this country right now.
Now we can stop asking who will Biden pick and get on with the race. Less than 100 days to go.

Joe Biden has been a public servant for 40 years and he really wants to help the american people. You want to help yourself
The debate over masks has moved to the presidential race.
Well look what Biden has done since then.  So what are they going to tell us next, Michael Jordan was cut from his high school basketball team?
So let me get this straight . . .   If you're Joe Biden's running mate, YOU AIN'T BLACK! üòÇ
Exactly.üòÜ I made the post in response to this Politico article:  ‚ÄòThe President Was Not Encouraging‚Äô: What Obama Really Thought About Biden
Did Biden tell you that? He tends to exaggerate(lie) about where he graduated. Trump graduated from Wharton which has the  #1 ranked MBA in the US. So I'll pass on the TDS infected liberal's opinion on his intelligence.
Simply put, the Obama admin coddled the world‚Äôs leading state sponsor of terrorism, and the Trump admin blew them to pieces and ushered in a peace agreement between neighboring states in the region.   Hard to chalk it up to anything else, but Biden and the media will find a way.
Like, do you really think Biden has a fair shot in Georgia and Florida, with Trump‚Äôs goons as governors?
Of course Hillary was a shark of a politician‚Äîfully willing to take down anyone to be president‚Äîbut I hope she watches as Biden actually crosses the finish line, too. Like, why would she or Obama look down their noses at a man who‚Äôs almost universally liked? It‚Äôs straight elitism
If even a sliver of this is true, it actually makes me resent Obama. His elitism needs to stay far away from his public image, b/c frankly it makes him look like a technocratic asshole. I honestly hope Biden sails to victory by historic margins‚Äî&amp; I hope Obama watches it happen.
Just like biden and Epstein
Maybe you've enjoyed what little freedom you've had. But the people in US prisons from Biden's crime bill haven't. Nor have the people who died from the wars. Or the lack of healthcare. But apparently, for some, you need only show them the wolf to get them to run to the fox
HAPPENING NOW: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris appear together for an event in Wilmington, Delaware.  Watch live:
Hillary Clinton may have her fingers crossed for a new job if Joe Biden heads to the White House. -
fine! Fine! FINE!  KAMALA AIN'T BLACK AND SHE A MAN  I'm STILL voting for Joe Biden!
I didn't say Biden was a saint or even that he was a good candidate. I didn't even mention his name. What I'm saying is that Trump trying to claim that his opponent is racist is a stupid argument bc he is clearly racist himself. Not a zero sum. They can BOTH suck, which they do.
Saw your spot on MSNBC. We need every Dem senator and representative in Washington speaking out...Biden/Harris need your support as well as the Resistance....We must all unite to take our country back from the fascist wannabe dictator.
The difference is that I don‚Äôt agree w that what he thinks it should be. Like I said, simply put,  I think Biden is the better person but he is usually misguided in what is best for the country.  I think Trump is genuinely a bad person but he is more inline w policies.
Oh, absolutely not. I‚Äôm a ‚Äúboth sides are terrible‚Äù kind of person. Nothing annoys me more than people who only see wrongs of one party. Biden had an agenda.  However, in Biden‚Äôs case I think his agenda is more an attempt to make the country what he thinks it should be.&gt;
Biden is on video pinching a little girls nipple.  That's a PEDOPHILE!!!
don‚Äôt know why you talk about Biden when your mans  stay hiding, and cant discern a fallacy from truth anymore and he‚Äôs turning more orange by the day
Surprise surprise, the stupid comes from someone with a Biden/Harris pic. Shocking!
Well for a lawyer who pays someone else to watch their kids, I'm sure Biden is fine, as long as you don't give a shit about his civil rights record, his criminal justice record, his immigration record, Tara Reade, or him being a diet (now with less R next to his name) Republican.
Evil! How can people be so blind. If elected, Sleepy Joe Biden and Kamala Chameleon Harris will destroy the country. God help us! #Trump2020

I should have clarified. I meant complacency bc of strong  polls. Biden/Harris will most likely continue to keep a strong overall national lead and increase EC probabilities in key toss-ups. I fear lower than projected turnout bc of the "we got this in the bag" mentality.
Speaking of forming a coherent sentence.... How about that Joe Biden? Mr. Incoherent sentence(s)... This is who yall want in office? This makes everything you post irrelevant..
He should of just pulled a Biden and lied about where he finished in his class.

I feel like the left would rather be right than actually get closer to the goals they set to achieve. Angela Davis is voting Biden/Harris. That spoke volumes. He is not my ideal choice, but I believe his administration would be more open to hearing and complying to our demands
It's really a no brainer, but I feel like the left sometimes would rather be right than actually get closer to the goals they set to achieve. Angela Davis is voting Biden/Harris and helped make my decision.
Can we do that right after Biden tells him he's fired?
So we can infer that expediency might have been behind her Kavanough slanders like it was her Biden Slanders?
Has anyone else noticed that the GOP has no plan on any isuess, no platform so they are just makimgbup scary things that Biden and Harris will do if elected? Losers. This includes you
Biden is such a idiot. We are not China you Alzheimer nut-job.
When Biden wins in November and gives his speech after the votes are counted I really really really want him to look straight into the camera and say, "Donald Trump, you're fired."

I have figured out the best way for Jones and Biden to attack Tuberville and Trump. Blame Trump and his response to the virus for the cancellation of college football.! SEC hasn't cancelled yet but they will. BTW, I'm a huge Bama fan but the season ain't gonna happen.
Trump did every single thing that he falsely accused Joe Biden of doing today. He literally made a list of all of his own failures and accused Biden of doing them. I‚Äôm so done with this. Please vote the moronic Oompa Loompa out of the WH in November.
Remember Obama‚Äôs first two years of office when Democrats controlled everything. He and Biden changed nothing during that period #police #laws

The media‚Äôs survival depends on this election.  It‚Äôs only the beginning. There will be some ridiculous things happen with the Biden campaign over the next few months that they will willfully ignore. They have to protect him. He‚Äôs the last shot they get for the next 4 years.
Progressive/liberal voices will never win out if they don't vote. The tweet wasn't really about Biden being drawn left, its about the party's politics being drawn left.
This was a political stunt...What are the statistical probabilities of this taking place on the day after Biden made his VP choice?  And it is NOT peace in the middle east...and Jared is a obnoxious ass.

Looks like Biden's choice of Kamala Harris has assured  that he will lose. Well done
Yeah, Biden got it wrong today.
There's not a person in the white house that would try to correct Donald Trump in his blundering about history &amp; different years &amp; what happened during those years but he's got nerve to talk about Joe Biden being slow Trump can't pronounce English words that are used everyday.
I mean I‚Äôm clearly going to vote for Biden and Harris. I‚Äôm not going to like it. I‚Äôm not voting for THEM I‚Äôm voting to get that buffoon out of office.
I was wondering if CNN or MSNBC would cut away for trump. He purposively planned his media joke to take time away from Biden/Harris, but it didn't work. I mean, what did he say anyway besides, lie, blame, insult, and take credit for Obama's work.
Obviously Biden pronouncing her name ‚ÄúCamel-uh‚Äù is to get back at her for calling him a racist who she believes sexually harassed women.
Would you care to put your $ where your mouth is? We can each put $10k in escrow and whoever's candidate wins gets the $20k minus the escrow fees. I've already got piles bet on Biden +120, but I'll definitely take more action at evens. Let me know.
The beginning emphasis on Biden's filial love in Harris speech was a brilliant move. We as a nation are hungry for precisely that during COVID crisis. But it also serves as a stark contrast to Trump &amp; his family. What else do we expect from the son of a whoremongerer?
The only way I would not vote for Biden Is if he took Drumpf as his VP. I am glad he picked someone far more qualified. #BidenHarris #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Remember the Pandemic Response Team that Trump disbanded. That was Obama and Biden. If only Trump and GOP listened to the WHO, CDC, Dr. Fauci, Dr. Birx. Trump is the President not Biden (not yet anyway). Trump was given the tools to combat Covid but he refused them all of it.
Does Biden think Hillary was a man?
Pence: ‚ÄúYou locked up thousands of black people for non-violent crimes such as weed possession. Also, do you still believe Biden sexually harassed those women and is he still a racist?‚Äù  Drops mic and walks of stage.
Also, that‚Äôs a lie. She did not say ‚Äúfar worse things‚Äù about Biden.
Tara Reade wants media to ask Harris about 'smear campaign' over sex assault claim against Biden
It is sad what the Dems are doing. It is obvious Biden has mental issues yet.......
If you are talking about the Biden-Harris conference, then I wholeheartedly agree! I felt like it was Nov. of'08 when Obama was elected! It was a wonderful feeling!
We all knew, know  is certifiable. The back to back with Biden only bolsters our resolve to be rid of this doddering fool.
Its funny how these polls show Biden ahead by 4 or 5 points. Then you scroll down and the survey shows that they surveyed a 1,000 register voters. Also it was done by CNBC, CBS or CNN. All fake...

Message to the press: stop following Trump around on his little junkets. Who cares what he has to say every single day? He is full of lies. Let him rant and rave in private. Follow Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and listen to sanity for a change. We have heard enough from Trump.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to make their first campaign appearance together in a few minutes in Delaware. Watch live on  #wvtm13
. Remember THESE Kamala Harris moments? | Five videos show why the Biden V...
What would the impact of a Biden-Harris win be on US India relations?  The media often underplays the fact that Biden‚Äôs vice presidential pick has an Indian mother. Her heritage could play a crucial role in U.S. foreign‚Ä¶
Do y‚Äôall think anyone‚Äôs told Biden that Kamala Harris is the VP pick?
LIVE NOW: 2020 Presidential Candidate Joe Biden makes his first appearance with newly chosen running mate Kamala Harris. They discuss their vision for how to defeat Trump and lead the country through a pandemic, economic fallout and racism.
If you put a gun to my head and forced me to vote for Biden or Trump, I'm voting for Trump. Not because I think he's an effective leader, or a trustworthy individual, or a good communicator, or that I even like him as a person, but BECAUSE YOU'RE PUTTING A FUCKING GUN TO MY HEAD.
08/12 Richard Dixon: Megan Barth of  on Biden's VP Pick and College Football  via
If y‚Äôall think Senator Harris is going to be a muzzled VP who has no personality, no sway, no strength, &amp; no relevance, please watch this video &amp; catch a clue.  She‚Äôll support Joe Biden all the way, but she isn‚Äôt about to just lay on the tracks for ANYONE. She‚Äôll have a voice.
I‚Äôm so tired. It‚Äôs even worse for an AA that holds that position. I‚Äôve been told on many FB posts that criticism of Obama, Biden, Kamala or the Democratic establishment means I must want Trump again or that I voted for him. It‚Äôs exhausting trying to explain this to people.
We need the bulldog persecution attitude Kamala has when it‚Äôs comes to getting Trump out of office. Honestly prison reform wasn‚Äôt changed when Obama was in office for 8 years..of course it takes more than that. So what makes you think not voting Biden will help in this situation.
He died in NY. On 7/31/20 (31/7). Biden announcement at 3:17. Dogs owner name Robert=317
I‚Äôm asking these everyday till the election.   What are you non-voters doing to advance the country if you‚Äôre not voting Joe Biden?
Kamala looks more white than a black woman? They can‚Äôt use her race as an excuse to hide Biden‚Äôs racism. Period..I worry about her leftist views more than anything else. #DangeroustoAmerica
I had already been working on connects between Baltimores MAJOR explosion on 8/10 and Major Biden, the German Shepard.
Biden/Harris ‚Äúis as mainstream and moderate as you can get. Trump &amp; Co. can bellow all day long that they are lackeys for Sanders and the ‚Äúthe Squad,‚Äù but it‚Äôs simply not credible. The Republican Party, by contrast, isn‚Äôt just catering to extremists ‚Äî it‚Äôs led by one.‚Äù
#NumberNerd ü§ì Watch the numbers. There‚Äôs quite a few numerology and gematria connections with Q1143 and Biden VP announcement. Do you see?
Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden will appear with his newly named running mate, Senator Kamala Harris, today at 2:50 p.m. CT. Both Biden and Harris are expected to speak and they may take questions. Special coverage from NPR and WBHM begins at 2:45 p.m.
Dems say Harris can broaden Biden's base as Republicans attack her record

Biden's magnanimous spirit, too much for  simple mind??
You're terrified to see Biden and Trump debate. Quit acting like an idiot.
That just confirms what I feel about Biden. He's a good man. Not perfect, but good.
Biden lost my vote, trump never had it. I guess I‚Äôm voting for ‚Äúdeez nuts‚Äù again :/
It‚Äôs nice that everyone‚Äôs giving Joe Biden credit for getting over Kamala‚Äôs attacks during the primary. But it reminds me that Ted Cruz doesn‚Äôt get enough credit for being totally chill about Donald Trump saying his dad murdered JFK.
Seems biden supporters are less aware of biden than biden is of biden........
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris

THANK YOU!!! dont even ask me why i am picking biden...
Liked on YouTube: Trump says he was surprised Biden picked Kamala Harris as running mate
Is it okay if I stay silent on the Biden/Harris thing?  It's giving me an even more sour mood than usual.
Kind of like my Neighbor that had a Republican for Biden sign with my Trump Sticker I put on it. I noticed this Morning his sign is gone. That‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt put Stupid Blue Shit up in a Red Area.
but but trump and his team are geniuses who will steam roll Biden...
Joe Biden will make his first public appearance with newly chosen running mate Kamala Harris in Delaware today.
Why every vote counts and why Biden must win by a landslide so that there can be no question about the win!
Help is coming , Biden Harris
Well that's kind of a problem since Project Lincoln has already pledged to support Biden's agenda in office.
There are way too many people arguing that Kamala and Biden are worst than Trump and Pence. That frightens me.
Funny, That‚Äôs not what you said about Biden in the debates.
I love justice roberts! I'll applaud that choice ; )  I do wonder what you think disqualifies Biden. With regards to strict constructionists like Scalia, my experience is that they only apply that philosophy when it aligns with their right-wing agenda.
I think it's bcuz she doesn't associate with blacks... She said she Indian and Jamaican... Then after literally almost killing Biden's campaign and they beef... She ends up joining him... It's like she playing both sides .. It don't matter who wins as long as she in
Exactly...who would ever thought I'll say Trump might be. The better pic... Bcuz Biden and Harris is an tricky selection... Just feel like they phony
Get EVERYTHING off your chest now, as you should, just be sure you vote Biden-Harris in November!
See what he did there??   (There will NEVER be a Biden/Trump debate, btw)
Obama and Biden embrace equality and kindness for all; Trump hates everyone but himself; especially hates women.This statement is supported by Trump's record of continued abuse and denigration of women.  Trump needs to reconsider that hate, how the hell does he think he got here?
This is an absolutely blessed morning. Having blocked out the annoying Trump people and right wing propagandists, it has been going absolutely fantastic. The Biden/Harris celebration üçæ continues.
üëç on  Trump says he was surprised Biden picked Kamala Harris as running mate
Roy S Johnson: Hearing that Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris... I thought about so many bold, bad-a Black women in #Alabama who are leading, organizing, and galvanizing our political landscape.
All Joe Biden‚Äôs choice did was make this war between black men and black women worse!
Great VP choice Biden couldn‚Äôt do any better
I look at the overall picture. Democrats have a strong record in protecting and preserving the two laws that are most important for me and mine throughout history. Biden/Harris 2020
is the leader we need in this nation at this time in history. The opposition will call names, whine and complain. The reality is, we need adults and responsible people to fix this broken nation. Biden/Harris will begin that process. I have never felt so energized!
Exactly! That‚Äôs why this clown is in office now. We have to rely on some of those Republicans (who are sick of Trump) to vote for Biden for him to win smh!
Find out what The Breakfast Club thinks about Biden picking Senator Harris as his running mate! -
the DNC wants us all to go back to the Obama administration. back when they ended racism and nobody payed as much attention to politics. that‚Äôs what Joe Biden and Kamala Harris represent; it‚Äôs Obama‚Äôs VP and another black, and that‚Äôs all they are.
The only thing Republicans have is ‚Äúradical left‚Äù and tired name calling. They can‚Äôt call out Biden or Harris on issues with all the damage Trump has done.
Also, hell of an admission that Biden won't be able to handle "bad crap".
Joe Biden think he slick but most people already know wassup with her
Also, just FTR, I did not vote for the President the last time, and I certainly won‚Äôt this time around. But I will not be voting for the Biden/Harris ticket.
MJ or Lebron is stoking racial division? Biden said all black people are the same just last week. Why isn‚Äôt CNN reporting that.
The TLDR is this: I think all things being equal (i.e. mental fitness), a Harris presidency would yield more ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù outcomes than a Biden one. That‚Äôs likely more scary to me than you, but that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm coming from. (End, I guess)
This again also assumes Biden is ‚Äúall there.‚Äù Our current president is clearly unstable, but there are real concerns about Biden‚Äôs mental acuity. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs just a right-wing talking point. Biden may be subject to whomever he surrounds himself with at this point. (10)
I have a hard time seeing Biden pushing through a true Medicare for all or single payer system, but I can see Kamala doing the same. (9)
Finally, there are the reasons I think she‚Äôd be worse than Biden. Both have a horrible record on CJ so that‚Äôs a wash. But when it comes to matters of other domestic policy, I do feel Harris is more of ‚Äúthis progressive moment.‚Äù I‚Äôm going off what I saw on the trail and the past.8
She speaks so well of Biden üòÇüòÇüòÇ. She called him a segregationist
Good luck with our country moving toward socialism. I am with your father, and hope he gets well. Also, wishing you well but hope you will research policies of Biden. The platform of the left is not moderate and will be the destruction of our country.
President Barack Obama said presidential candidate Joe Biden nailed the decision to select Kamala Harris as his running mate, and other Democrats have also praised her selection.
Again, I know why I'm voting for Biden/Harris. I'm excited. I must move on to share that excitement with other people I know. Good-bye.
We are All Sick to death of Trump savage attacks on anyone one who does not worship at the altar of the choosen one. Rejoice.  Biden and Kamala  Civility Dignity Honesty
i really don‚Äôt like Joe Biden, i don‚Äôt like Kamala Harris, i hate the 2 party system. i‚Äôm not even a democrat but i had a dream last night that Tr*mp got re-elected so i know what i‚Äôm going to have to do and again, i don‚Äôt like it.
üòÇ passion and strength! üòÇ Biden has been on the wrong side of every foreign policy decision ever. Now he doesn‚Äôt know what office he‚Äôs running for or what location he‚Äôs at. Rick is the biggest Grifter I‚Äôve ever seen.
Honestly.. with the choices in this election, I wouldn‚Äôt blame anyone for not voting this time. I said what I said.. Trump is worse but.. Biden and Kamala are pure trash..
Dems, this election is too important to waste our time responding to attacks by bots, Trump people, and other Republican supporters.  Block them out!! Spend that time urging other Democratic supporters to rush to the polls on Nov. 3 and vote for Biden/Harris and other Democrats.
hey for those of you critiquing biden for picking a VP ‚Äújust because‚Äù she‚Äôs a woman of color, you should REALLY be more concerned that throughout history our leaders have been overwhelmingly white males ‚Äújust because‚Äù
She's being used by Biden to pander to minorities and women. Smart people would see right through this and realized the Dems that have been promising he same crap for 50 yrs hasn't delivered.
I am in no way a politician or really even into politics, but DT gone win again because y‚Äôall don‚Äôt wanna vote for Joe Biden üò©
How Biden chose Harris: Inside his search for a running mate
Why not Joe Biden?
This is the main reason I would not be able to vote to Biden/Harris (there are a lot others, but this is the main)
She did not accuse Biden of being a segregationist. She challenged one aspect of his boast about being able to work with people he disagreed with.
Op-Ed: Kama Harris and the Growing Political Power on Black Women: In #Alabama, Black women and the Black Voters Matter Fund played pivotal roles in the election of Doug Jones to the Senate in 2017.
Are the suburbans happy you kept minorities out of the neighborhood?  Probably if we're being honest...   Will it be enough to keep them from voting for Biden for social clout and to keep up with the Joneses? Probably not
You sure he didn't? How many people you think died because of the 1994 Crime Bill? Perhaps, you're just unwilling to face the truth that both Biden &amp; Trump are soulless sociopaths.
Can we put self-serving cancel culture on the back burner for ONCE? If we do not get Donald Trump out of office now, we may not have another election.   This isn‚Äôt about the needs/wants of few, this is about the needs/wants of many. Joe Biden is the most qualified candidate.
This suburban mom is 100% with Biden/Harris.
Biden is being controlled by the Squad and other far left Democrats.
And we are surprised that right wing media is attacking Joe Biden‚Äôs VP pick?
I repeat. Just block the idiotic bots, racists, conservatives, and Trump people. It's easy and convenient. Then continue this momentus celebration üçæ  of....Biden/Harris 2020. It's a wonderful feeling. I love it!! üíò
For some reason, the DNC researchers determined that three factors motivated their voter base:  1) Mental deficiency  2) Pedophillia  3) Kwowing what Willie Brown tastes like  Joe Biden‚Äôs got the first two covered and Kamala can write Yelp reviews on number 3.
Wow!! I feel absolutely wonderful this morning. I thank God for this unspeakable joy. Biden/Harris 2020.
These idiotic bots and Trump people are trying to crush our celebration üçæ of our impressive Biden/Harris Democratic ticket. Just block their misery and annoyance. Keep celebrating and spreading the joy. Biden/Harris 2020.
Yet, Biden voters are not labeled as ‚Äúcoon‚Äù lol I honestly want to know what the non-voters are doing for the country.
I am 100% supporting  the BIDEN-HARRIS  ticket! 100%!!!
I woke up this morning and saw these bots and Trump people tweets all over my phone/computer. It's ridiculous!! I immediately started blocking the morons. Dems, don't argue with them. They're not worth it. We don't need anything to impede our joy and celebration of Biden/Harris.
Precisely this.  is delusional. Nearly EVERY minority is excited for Biden Harris ticket. But more importantly, minorities are desperate to get rid of  Watch the blue wave.
Trump‚Äôs pandemic is his biggest failure as president. And he doesn‚Äôt care. Biden and Harris should start speaking out every day about the pandemic specifically. Make Trump own his failure completely.
Honey you legit cannot call anyone racist...pack your bags Donny boy! If Covid doesn‚Äôt get ya Biden/Harris WILL. Thank u, next.
I‚Äôm not voting for Joe Biden ever
Damnit Joe Biden damnit
Having said that I'm going to mute "Harris" and "Biden" before I set my mail in ballot on fire :)
Pam what's your angle? Why are you attacking Biden?
Medhi I hear what you're saying but until November 3rd it will be helpful is rose Twitter stops bashing Biden and helps us get rid of Trump and win the Senate. Biden isn't going to veto his own party and we can pull harder to the left with him than we can with Trump.
We need to celebrate üçæ Kamala Harris becoming Joe Biden's running mate &amp; next Vice President
That‚Äôs a convenient perspective to ignore Biden‚Äôs cop VP recently saying he‚Äôs a racist whose guilty of sexually harassing women.   I suppose people truly will talk themselves into believing anything that allows them to continue supporting their ‚Äúteam.‚Äù
Does Kamala Harris still think Joe Biden is a racist, segregationist?  ü§î
I heard ‚ÄúAngela Davis is voting for Biden. What do you know that she doesn‚Äôt?‚Äù üôåüèª
Joe Biden is the Presidential candidate
I was all Biden/Harris 2020!!! But then they said she was a phony, and a meanie, so now I just don't know who I should vote for.  I don't like meanies.
Burning down all the corporations isn't on the ticket this year. And if we try and force it on there then we will lose and they will get stronger and harder to beat next time. Obama/Biden admin signed Dodd Frank. Trump repealed it.
Maybe the people who are still whining about Kamala Harris's statements about Joe Biden in debates are still stuck thinking a woman criticizing them is unforgivable.
How Biden selected Kamala Harris as his running mate
The right is getting what its way because they won. If Trump had said he was going to do all he's done, he wouldn't have won. Politics is hard. Biden wants to expand healthcare. Trump doesn't. That's not hard. M4A is one way. Its not the only way. You pick 1 guy. Not an ideal.
I didn't know you were a political philosopher. There is a reality where the next president will either be Trump or Biden &amp; if people don't work to elect Biden then there will be less progress. RBG isn't going to live forever. You want 6-3 far right scotus decisions for life?
Now y‚Äôall who follow my post know how much I love to troll the Republican Party but this time to be fair the Democratic Party Ôøºgotta get these jokes. Didn‚Äôt Kamala Harris Ôøºlast year say she believed Joe Biden sexually assaulted all those women and there stories should be told.
I don't get the rhetoric that Kamala Harris was the only choice for AG. She turned down being Obama's AG. The notion that she is the only one who can be Biden's AG is ridiculous.
Im not giving my vote to an independent ballot and I pray that the kamala and Biden haters don‚Äôt either because trump is worse than all of them and has clearly brought out the worst of the racists in this country again. That‚Äôs it and that‚Äôs all.
OK small purple Birmingham suburb here, no Trump signs, one Biden and the old couple down the street took down their confederate flag.
Fun fact: Kamala Harris believes Joe Biden‚Äôs accusers but now will work for him
I'm not super excited about Biden/Harris, but I'm scared shitless of Trump/Pence.
Y‚Äôall do realize it‚Äôs either Trump or Biden.. right.. fucking vote blue.
Absolutely!! I said it once. I'll say it again. I love that Biden/Harris Democratic ticket....
Absolutely!! Trump is one of the biggest racists I have ever seen. He ran a campaign in 2016 that was filled with racist innuendo.  Look at his administration. Trump is delusional. Biden/Harris 2020
She‚Äôs pretty moderate and  surprise, surprise, she and Biden want MORE Americans to have access to healthcare.
How it happened: Inside Biden's search for a running mate
Won't matter what Biden does the virus will magically disappear nov 4th
But I‚Äôm going to do what I can to get Biden/ Harris and Doug Jones elected. Those efforts will not involve wasting my time trying to convince white evangelicals to not vote for Trump. At this point I don‚Äôt think anything will change their minds.
No what she did is hold Biden to task. That‚Äôs something the bow down to a lying bumbling leader Republicans do not understand.
I agree Pence will be destroyed on the debate and Trump will too. Biden will call out his lies and challenge him. Pence lies like Trump but Trump can't stand to be challenged. Just too bad Pence will face her only once.
1. Because Biden picked her.               2. Because Biden picked her.                       The same damn reason we will stand in the rain to vote for a white man but question a black woman.ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è No other reason is necessary
Though she would be great, can't give up that seat unless 51 Dems have seats or nothing Biden proposal will probably get through esp if a Supreme court vacancy comes about. I know he can pass with a 50 50 split but that extra one is needed in case something happens to another one
That is self defeating. I consider myself progressive but I‚Äôm a realist too.   I‚Äôm üíØ Biden-Harris
If it's me I'd give Adam Schiff strong consideration, but Biden has the benefit of deeper knowledge and a bigger team helping generate a list of candidates.
Please stop &amp; be happy. White men been shucking and jiving their way into our black lives with lies. We finally get a Black Female nominee and here y‚Äôall come, fist in the air. Ok whatever, but I‚Äôd take Biden/Harris any day over what we have now!
Look, Biden can make his running mate Zarbon and I'd still vote for him over Trump.
What is your excuse for not voting for Biden now? Is it going to be Reparations? Instead of demanding to hold your vote hostage why don‚Äôt you use your influence to work with him. Or better, yet try demanding Reparations, justice reform, etc. from Trump.
On tomorrow, Wednesday, August 12, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will deliver remarks in Wilmington, Delaware on working together to restore the soul of the nation and fight for working families to move the country forward. Stay tuned. Time to be announced:
We knew the attacks were coming. That was a given. But, the Republican ticket simply cannot compare with the Biden/Harris ticket. The Biden/Harris ticket is absolutely awesome.......
Harris inferred Biden is a raccist without outright saying Biden is a racist.  Fox's Cavuto fact-checks Trump camp claim that Harris called Biden racist: 'She never did'
Absolutely, President Obama. I said the exact same words. Joe Biden made the very right choice.  Democrats can win if they just prepare themselves and show up at the polls and vote in LARGE NUMBERS....
Atp we have to put our pride aside and vote Biden so we can get Trump out
With a bit of ‚ÄúJesus is Lord don‚Äôt put your hope in earthly things this isn‚Äôt our home‚Äù thrown in for good measure. But all of that can apply while Christians vote for Biden/Harris. I can‚Äôt with the white evangelicals. The other side kind of drives me crazy too.
Joe Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúwhat happen‚Äù at the end of his gibberish the other day is single handily getting me through today lmaoooo. Like you tell us ‚Äúwhat happen‚Äù Joe üò≠üò≠üò≠
I want to see long lines around blocks for Biden/Harris in November in cities all around the country. Let's face it. Middle class white/middle class minority Democrats are going to show up.  We NEED "low income" black, white and other minority Democrats to show up at the polls!!
Would be happy and privileged to have Susan Rice on Biden‚Äôs Caninet.
Excited about Biden-Harris ticket. Sounds like Trump is afraid of her. He does not handle a smart, talented, assertive woman well. His misogyny will rear its ugly head. His paranoia and sadism will be activated.
Please be right. What a nightmare to think of creepy sleazy biden and legs up harris winning
This is horrible Joe Biden you just gave Trump 4 more years for having  Kamala Harris as your Vice President!!! Black People are Not gonna Vote For You!!!
Kamala Harris said she believes joe Biden‚Äôs sexual accusers... now she will act like it didn‚Äôt happen! The corrupt Democratic Party that STARTED THE KKK. COULDNT BE ME!

If Biden/Harris are elected, four years of stupidity will come.
Does anyone forget that Harris believes Biden‚Äôs sexual accusers? Lol
President Donald J. Trump told reporters at a White House briefing Tuesday that Kamala Harris ‚Äúwas very disrespectful to Joe Biden‚Äù during the Democratic primaries, and said ‚Äúit‚Äôs hard to pick somebody that‚Äôs that disrespectful.‚Äù
‚ÄúI am pleased to announce that I‚Äôve just been told who my running mate will be.‚Äù ‚Äî Joe Biden.
My thoughts on Joe Biden‚Äôs VP selection. I am imagining Kamala is thinking up a recipe for Pence Stew come October 7, 2020 Vice Presidential debate. Her opponent might be another Indian American female Nikki Haley. Either way Kamala will bring the heat. #BidenHarris
Do folks not know the Biden is winning in the poles rn ? Do y‚Äôall want the percentages to carry back the other way? Come on nie I know y‚Äôall smarter than this. lol just vote for the man bruh.
None of this shit gonna change if Trump Wins. Vote Biden. None of this shit gonna change if Trump Wins. Vote Biden. None of this shit gonna change if Trump Wins. Vote Biden.
I guess she thinks what she said about Biden doesn‚Äôt matter now?
Time traveler in December, 2019: It‚Äôs gonna be Biden/Harris.  Me, aiming my car at the overpass pylons: Yeah, probably.
A vote for anyone but Biden is a vote for the Cheeto.
Yes, you are just as bad as one of these White people that‚Äôs for Trump if you don‚Äôt vote Biden.
Either you voting Biden or you‚Äôre for 4 more years of Trump. All the rest of that shit is fluff that strays away from the current objective.
I said it back then it was a set up the whole time. They plotted on Bernie to get Biden in there. I called the Kamala VP pick and watch the rest come true. And tiny Mike financing it.
Biden. Harris. Harrison. Jones. Cunningham. Warnock. Ossoff. McGrath. Espy.   Democrats in the South are ready for change. Let‚Äôs win. üá∫üá∏‚ú®
Ok. I‚Äôll admit that I can find nothing from Dems from Jan and Feb where they asked for a more comprehensive ban. Perhaps this complaint later is what I‚Äôm thinking of. The problem is that I still can‚Äôt find a single quote, unless you go w yours from Biden, criticizing it either&gt;

All these people that want a Pence/Harris debate are too scared for a Trump/Biden debate... speaks volumes.
Joe Biden really tricked you black folks, a woman of color is not Kamala Harris, half white and Jamaican,so not a woman of color,Joe is a Racist,,
I will literally follow Biden/Harris anywhere
I‚Äôm not especially close, but I love this movement. My feed has taken a little of the burn off the Biden pick today. üò¨
