He is a bigger idiot than Trump, and you guys are going to vote for him
Not more nervous than this guy! My wife is black and she is way more scared of this idiot than Trump....
If joe picks Bass, will she go up against Pence, or Trump in the debates? Or, both?
Thread by  You all know why Trump has now left the White House - being seen off by the entire WH staff before he traveled to Oe he won't be back for awhile - to go to his resort in Bedminster, NJ, right? Everybody focuses on SPYGATE SPYGAT‚Ä¶
I have a feeling the NRA won‚Äôt be the only organization not survive the Trump occupation. I believe Trump has done what Bush didn‚Äôt... finally put the last nail in the coffin for what was known as the Republican Party.
Never trump never knows they want a Bush to lose nicely
After I saw Trump blast the press, it just got a whole lot better.
Trust in President Trump. I was watching a video and it was said that the people who are against the rioting have not started retaliating because we are the better people and we are letting them exterminate themselves. We need to continue to be patient it will all be over soon.
One of Trump‚Äôs Antichrist friends!
EO to announce that Trump is now in favor of #Obamacare
You‚Äôre right and I‚Äôm not disagreeing with any of that. In the NFL, that old school mentality you mentioned is alive and well. Those owners don‚Äôt care about the pandemic. It‚Äôs all business to them. Remember they‚Äôre mostly Trump supporters.
*LAST CALL*   12 of these Paw-tastic babies left until we can re-up again.    Seeing as fabric is hard to come by, well I'm just not sure when that'll be!  Last 12 will be 10% off until gone!
While  and  are fighting for extended unemployment benefits for the millions who are still out of work, Trump is in Bedminster, entering a room full of rich white guys, yuckin it up, as Hail To The Chief plays. #LetThemEatCovid
DaWhites wanna own the libs so badly they‚Äôre willing to risk their lives and their kids‚Äô lives just to see Trump. That shit is crazy as hell!
Also, russia messed the the polls last time and are continuing to do so because trump is fine with them helping him again. It‚Äôs sadly, the only way he can ‚Äúwin.‚Äù #RepublicansCheat
Kemp went all in for Trump, and now he can't admit he was wrong, even if it means thousands more GA citizens dying.

He said it both ways. So even Trump seems to recognize his error.
Blame!! Trump!!ü§¨
China and Iran and the UK and Australia and Canada and most of the world know Trump is a loose cannon who can‚Äôt be trusted. Of course they‚Äôre all ready to get rid of him. That doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre interfering in our elections like Russia is.
#LeningradLindsey is telling Trump to stand firm against putting $600 per week in the hands of hard working Americans, to stand firm against money to states to fight #COVID19 and to stand firm against funding schools to keep our kids safe.  stands firm for families.
Just imagine if this was Trump.  24/7 wall to wall hysteria from the media.  Nothing Biden says or does even gets a notice.  Pathetic bias.  #UsVsThem
When Mitch bowed out, he conceded midfield. Trump has to have something to run on going into the election. Nancy has the ball at her feet and an open net. This is am easy score.
First off, he did not grow up rich, that was your candidate. Joe's father was a used car salesman. It was Trump that did a quid pro quo in the Ukraine. Not Joe. You're confused Grandma. I've never heard him say he has all the answers. Take my advise, do research.
The way Trump confidently proclaims that no one has done more for black Americans than himself is um ... that‚Äôs delusional
If I took a shot for every time Trump has said fake news in this interview üíÄ

Trump‚Äôs EO about tiktok
Considering trump CAN'T do anything that require funds , it means NOTHING
Glad to finally hear someone in the church saying this out loud.
Wow, some somewhat honest reporting from  Of course China wants Biden to win, they know he won't be as tough on them as Trump. Trump's trade deals will mean trillions of future dollars to the US. Just one more reason we must re-elect President Trump.
Danchenko, a Russian lives in Washington D.C told FBI in Jan 2017 that Steele, a former MI6 officer, tasked him in June 2016 to dig up dirt on Trump. Steele was hired in May 2016 by Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm working for the Clinton &amp; DNC.
Herman Cain, the former Republican presidential candidate, businessman and close ally of President Donald Trump, was guided by his Christian faith in politics, business and his personal life, his pastor said at his funeral Friday.
Trump loves nothing better than these polls that paint him as the underdog. I wouldn't be surprised if he's not somehow responsible for their looney predictions!
Time to stop these talks before the Republicans cave. President Trump‚Äôs EO is exactly what we need (-) extra $600 unemp

trump has put more time and effort into trying to ban tiktok than he has into trying to control the pandemic wtf is happening
Do you think all the libs that support legalization of weed are going to support her, after she prosecuted hundreds and then bragged about smoking it herself? Oh, and the clips of her attacking Biden at the dem debates are going to be great for the Trump ads. This for a start.
great thread.  At this point, do Trump supporters even read?
In all my 60 plus years, I've never seen a more DISGUSTING human being as Donald J Trump
I think if Biden wins by voter fraud then there will be an all out civil war. I don't think Trump wants this to happen.
Dems are Party of Elites and tired of a two tiers justice system w lifetime polictian billionaires! Trump represents America and is fighting for our rights and freedoms. Biden &amp; Dems sold our country soul to China and laundered billions if not trillions thru Ukraine!
Nothing is as it seems &amp; that is certainly true with this article.  Read the headline, then read the article, then tell me if you think there is 1 chance in a million that Biden wins.  One BIG elephant in the room not mentioned - Biden's cognitive issues.
Yeah, sure. I heard Biden say in his typical dull witted way, that prosecuting Trump after he leaves office could be seen as  political revenge and a threat to Democracy. What he's really saying is it's politically destructive to him.
When trump goes on CNN, MSNBC, YOUTUBE, TOWN HALLS, PODCASTS, CBS, and all others Biden has done
He isn‚Äôt doing this because he cares, he‚Äôs not doing it because he wants to be president, he‚Äôs not doing this because he‚Äôs a good guy, because we all know he isn‚Äôt. He‚Äôs doing this because his BFF has shitty numbers and HES trying to keep Trump as president. Kanye is a POS
Trump has done nothing for the black community and how would you even know? Are you black? No? There's a seat over there then
I'm very aware of who both are. There aren't any 'non-racist' options. That's been my entire life story. But I'm married to a dreamer and Trump wants to make it harder for people like my wife to stay here; so why would I vote for his particular racism? A real answer...
Yes orange man bad and trump voter bad, much better. Bravo. ü§°
It's been  fixed since the beginning. McConnell has decided Trump will lose and his only hope to remain Majority Leader is to protect his Senators from political accountability. He is taking advantage of Trump's vanity in order shift responsibility. Only voters lose.
Election interference! If Trump ads get banned so should Bidens .
God must be pained as he watches trump assault humanity.
‚ÄúIf you are have trouble deciding whether you‚Äôre for me or Trump, then you ain‚Äôt black.‚Äù -Joe Biden
Ugh. You‚Äôre going to fuck this all up. I just feel it. And you have a complete lightweight in  leading this. We‚Äôre going to end up with four more years of Trump if you don‚Äôt get your shit together and learn how to be a street fighter. AND replace
It‚Äôs rather disappointing that he ended like this. Because I discovered him through his Fairly Oddparents reviews and thought he was a funny guy. Ever since that Trump rant, he‚Äôs been on a downward spiral.
No, he didn't.   And if he hadn't ignored it and called it a hoax back him January, and hadn't fired the pandemic response team, this wouldn't have gotten this bad.  This is Trump fault. This is his plague.
Not 1 single trump supporter is thinking about voting for Kanye, he is only doing this to take votes from Biden. Kanye has absolutely no chance of winning!
United States v. Fred Trump and Donald Trump. Violates Fair Housing Act by effectively banning minority residents. ‚ÄúNice try‚Äù
So wait, is Trump suggesting Biden is more powerful that God?
9 out of 12 for 424. Easier than usual?
I started out as Never Trump! But all the republicans who enabled him by refusing to hold him accountable have convinced me to to NEVER VOTE FOR ANY REPUBLICAN, EVER AGAIN. #NeverRepublican
As of right now . Even Fox News says if Biden refuses to debate Trump . Trump will lose the election . It does not look good for us at all .
Donald J Trump is working with   Russia,  China, North Korea to overthrow American democracy and its relations for almost 5 year's now. They have successfully influenced one election gaining the end result they were working for and holding that gained power since 2016.
Fired??? He‚Äôll be eating hamberders in Bedminster NJ with Trump on Saturday.
Wow,  everyday Trump gets more desperate!
I‚Äôm old and married, but the Trump question would have been asked prior to the first date.
This hurting God deal is another key point in the Shit Show we call the Trump campaign. I killed over 160K Americans. Biden will hurt God.
Yes this is a winner for Trump. A sign of pure genius. It‚Äôs likely to be a major debate question. Vote for me I banned Tik Tok.
This gaff doesn‚Äôt hurt you with me. I‚Äôd vote for a goat in a dress before I‚Äôd vote for trump.
Trump's not at fault. The more b's you guys post the more it becomes obvious what's really going on. So keep the propaganda coming. Your putting kids and women on the front line of protest. Cowards
Funny you accept Trump‚Äôs lies
My wife's from there. It's fitting
Humility? Seriously. The guy can't define humility. A president that requires a teleprompter and strings to function is just that. A puppet
Trump really think he taking this from us. bro just stop üòÇ
Well now. Trump decided to ban companies from doing business with Chinese companies like Tencent. I am pretty sure he doesn't know nor care but he may have caused a huge crash in the gaming/tech industry in the USA because of it. Tencent owns a very large portion of the gaming
So, FIRST, Bkacks aren‚Äôt black if they vote for Trump. NOW, the Black Community isn‚Äôt diverse? And,  is racist? I‚Äôve never heard the President spout this kind of crap!!
I don't know. Because nothing good can happen, probably not. The only silver lining in this election cycle would be the two brain addled, racist ramblings of Biden v Trump. We probably won't even get that.
‚ÄúTrump bans LoL‚Äù   Future headlines write themselves
I think the more these are worn that it will fix itself. They had these and any masks that are President Trump related.
President Donald Trump on Thursday issued an executive order that would ban the social media app TikTok from operating in the US in 45 days if it is not sold by its Chinese parent company ByteDance
We never should have allowed anything to be shut down.  I never saw anything like this under any virus under the previous administration.  That tells me all I need to know.
This logic makes my head hurt. Voting for the Lib doesn't take it away from Trump unless you were going to vote for him in the first place. It definitely doesn't give the vote to Biden, it gives it to the Lib. It's the equivalent of not voting at all, except you make a statement.
Like his VP pick would be the deal breaker against Trump
Facebook removes troll farm posing as African-American support for Donald Trump  via

He fights his/our evil enemies daily.  I pray all the time.  #GodWins  If Trump loses, it will be voter fraud but remember #GodWins.
Misdirection? You are calling a conspiracy in Trump's DOJ. This isn't 2017. He's flushed everyone he could out after the Mueller investigation which is when this one took place. So yes. You don't get taken seriously and get sarcasm.
Never Trump Republicans are a very small fraction, mostly made up of Bush 2 speech writers and neoliberal Reaganomics geeks, who are pretty much responsible for where the Republican Party ended up... Trump is a symptom of 50 years of Republican policies.
Are we finally ready yet to admit that Kanye West is a "baby Christian" like Dobson tried to sucker us about Trump years ago?  Multiple instances of taking the Lord's name in vain in this article.
Will Joe's VP  be debating Pence or Trump? Or, both?
If a giant meteor hit America and killed ninety % of the population, you'd blame the low employment numbers on Trump.
Beds to Trump?  TVA how about decided to do the right thing!!
Trump humiliated his religious followers, especially Catholics, by insinuating they are stupid enough to think that Biden will hurt God. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Repugs put the final nail in their coffin by rushing to get Kanye on the ballot, implying black folks would vote for him cos he‚Äôs black.
Is four years of dementia worth taking Trump out of office? Funny. The answer is Yes. It is what it is. BTW Is Trump‚Äôs dementia somehow better?
Thank you Pastor Trump a man of the...... whatever. He is Gods protector you know.
This was the Hitler election program in 29/30. All Trump needs is to lose 900 pounds grow some hair and grow a little bit of hair under his nose. Then maybe learn how to read but that‚Äôs not a disqualifier.
I am jumping in here to point out that she describes herself as a staunch conservative in one paragraph and a moderate late in the piece.  Am I missing something here?  Real question: Do staunch conservatives count as moderates now that Trump is in office?
Biden and trump are fuckin idiots.
TRUMP wants everything to appear normal  I DON'T think it will EVER be normal like before the pandemic
These broadcast 'debates' have nothing to do with who knows more or makes a better case. Look at how Clinton 'schooled' Trump, yet Trump supporters and Fox said just the opposite. Anyone who has encountered a Trump supporter on Twitter knows they don't care about logic.
I wouldn't give a damn
How exactly is it racist?

LeBron James says NBA won't miss President Donald Trump as a viewer...wooohooo November is right around the corner....yeppers let‚Äôs vote the clown out of office...
Gaffes what do you call Trump‚Äôs instability to read or have a coherent thought.
The NRA is not a gun lobby as much as power broker for the GOP. (Fact: Trump received $30 million for his campaign from them.) No one wants to take away guns. Most gun owners are responsible and we'll protect their 2nd amendment rights. Common sense gun laws!

My mom is 84 and a staunch Trump supporter. She does NOT want any vaccines!
Do you watch the news, or just mis-report it? Nearly every Republican who turned down Trump's support in 2018 lost their elections. Nearly all that accepted it won. You are either a blatant liar or you have your head so far up your ass you can lick where your heart should be.
Why would Trump name either of them AG?
They're one of the biggest donors, not to mention the "go-between" for Russian sponsors for Trump
How about forever. Trump was a fan of Herman Cain and it would be an honor for postus to implement the simple tax plan Cain suggests in his policy. And name it after Herman in his honor. Wow, the left would incinerate.
You‚Äôre triggered because Trump is leaving Biden in the dust.
FYI, Mr. President, this is going to upset a lot of your supporters! #NoMasks

Mr Trump. Did any of your staffers ever tell you that when you are traveling on the taxpayer‚Äôs dime to a Presidential visit that you aren‚Äôt supposed to turn it into a ‚Äúfreebie‚Äù campaign rally? That‚Äôs a No-No. Keep it up and u may get a bill.

How do U think Prince would feel about trump calling Bloomberg mini Mike? Which I had seen Bob &amp; his friend comment on on Facebook.  Like, excuse me?  We all know P was relentlessly bullied.  What was a huge thing that he was always teased about?

Exactly.  Your alternative is Trump - the anti-thesis of American leadership.  You should be leading the conservative choice for Biden - so we can get back to normal debates about tax policy and deregulation not how many Americans should die per day, kids in cages, etc.

Watch your mouth. That's tRump you're talking about
I think Trump banning Tiktot is just his political battle with China. He need to be focusing more on battling this pandemic instead of worrying about app that will not be banned in the USA anytime soon.
The contrast couldn‚Äôt be any clearer. It just shows how accepting Trump supporters are, even with a different political opinion

Unbelievable. He is as mesmerized by Donald Trump as the people who followed Charles Manson or Jim Jones.
I have always been unimpressed with CT since he wondered aloud how Trump‚Äôs racist strategy and embracing of David Duke ‚Äúwould poll.‚Äù That‚Äôs when I first began to worry that all might be lost.

Pompeo‚Äôs remarks followed reports that Microsoft is in advanced talks to buy the U.S. operations of TikTok, which has been a source of national security and censorship concerns for the Trump administration.

You so sure... I mean Trump has presided over a country that has seen armed protestors intimidate Michigan lawmakers. And one where the Floyd protests broke out. And one where he provoked violence by sending in paramilitary and justified it through inaccurate footage
Do you think ivanka Trump would be an Assistant to the President if Trump was not her Daddy?
Between Trump, Barr and the Trump base, our justice system has been trashed beyond belief. Truth, justice and pride must be restored in these agencies we so depend on.
I beg to differ; Real Republicans are not Trumplican‚Äôs. Trump IS THE GOP RIGHT NOW. He‚Äôs destroyed the brand . It needs to start over. The entire GOP is nothing more than a collection of enablers. The brand ‚ÄúRepublican‚Äù will NEVER be trusted again. It‚Äôs no different from KKK now
I‚Äôm not sure that narrative is correct. It always looked more to me like moderates and independents broke for Obama after the post-Sandy Obama-Christie love in.  I‚Äôm pretty sure Romney got a larger percentage of the vote than Trump.
Ivanka and Trump have been dealing with the Chinese for years. Do you own a Trump tie?  Turn it over. Made in China. Do you have an Ivanka dress?  Look at the label. Made in China. Who is ripping off who?
Trump really do wtf he want .. üòÇ
Good morning to my Twitter family. Hope everyone is having a great start to their day and having an awesome weekend. We have just 93 days left to vote for a President Trump and send the Democrats packing. I believe this election is the most conseqiential election in my lifetime.
Republicans. Didn‚Äôt you watch the Impeachment?  Save one, Repb‚Äôs turned a blind eye and Trump and Repb‚Äôs refused to let witnesses testify. He may have gotten away with his dirty deeds, but he will ALWAYS be known as one of the IMPEACHED PRESIDENTS!

Stephen Miller making comments about Obama‚Äôs speaking at John Lewis‚Äôs funeral is about as delusional as Trump thinking COVID-19 could be over by Easter.  Neither has any basis in reality.

I have seen a good number of Trump signs and bumper stickers this year. I have seen 0 Biden anything. I feel there is no fire in the Biden campaign. I guess it‚Äôs basically an Anti-Trump vote in November. Sad for Democrats that they can‚Äôt nominate a person to rally behind.

Federal LEOs are leaving Portland but the city is still violent.   Precisely what was accomplished here other than deepening partisan divisions and convincing more people that Trump wants a police state?  Maybe providing footage for Trump campaign ads?
Trump has also retweeted many of the Patriots Austin calls "QPharisees" and Q has also linked them many times in his drops in a positive light, even calling them Patriots and acknowledging them as valuable members to the movement.  As for that retweet, kindly share?

All the MSM called Trump a lier about spying but looks like he was right so Twitter needs to let people say what they want. It‚Äôs should not up to them to fact check anyone.

Rape is not okay, at all.  There's 0 to suggest Trump is guilty in any of those (quickly dismissed) accusations.  May be hard to accept but, it is possible for women to lie about sexual acts to push the narrative of "Orange man bad".

I was ok with him till he voted against Kavanaugh.  You and I both know that miss Ford was full of crap.  The voted to impeach Trump.  If you like trump or hate trump he shouldn‚Äôt have been impeached for some made up BS.

Yeah, but from where I‚Äôm standing, I don‚Äôt really see that happening. There‚Äôs a difference in pointing out joe‚Äôs flaws, and attacking him and putting up there with trump. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre being equated, and if they are, it‚Äôs on the sexual assaulter level.
I feel like ‚Äúattacking Biden‚Äù is a stretch. If you‚Äôre a white leftist, odds are you‚Äôre not suprised by this stuff from trump and you gave up hope a year or two ago on him. Just gotta get him out.

Glad to finally hear someone in the church saying this out loud.
Wow, some somewhat honest reporting from  Of course China wants Biden to win, they know he won't be as tough on them as Trump. Trump's trade deals will mean trillions of future dollars to the US. Just one more reason we must re-elect President Trump.
So the Democrats and Republicans are arguing about the second stimulus bill because Trump wants to really only give relief to schools that open up during a pandemic?! So he only wants to reward people and children for risking their lives?!! Am I hearing this right?

great thread.  At this point, do Trump supporters even read?
I think if Biden wins by voter fraud then there will be an all out civil war. I don't think Trump wants this to happen.
Dems are Party of Elites and tired of a two tiers justice system w lifetime polictian billionaires! Trump represents America and is fighting for our rights and freedoms. Biden &amp; Dems sold our country soul to China and laundered billions if not trillions thru Ukraine!
Nothing is as it seems &amp; that is certainly true with this article.  Read the headline, then read the article, then tell me if you think there is 1 chance in a million that Biden wins.  One BIG elephant in the room not mentioned - Biden's cognitive issues.
He isn‚Äôt doing this because he cares, he‚Äôs not doing it because he wants to be president, he‚Äôs not doing this because he‚Äôs a good guy, because we all know he isn‚Äôt. He‚Äôs doing this because his BFF has shitty numbers and HES trying to keep Trump as president. Kanye is a POS
Trump has done nothing for the black community and how would you even know? Are you black? No? There's a seat over there then
I'm very aware of who both are. There aren't any 'non-racist' options. That's been my entire life story. But I'm married to a dreamer and Trump wants to make it harder for people like my wife to stay here; so why would I vote for his particular racism? A real answer...
God must be pained as he watches trump assault humanity.

Ugh. You‚Äôre going to fuck this all up. I just feel it. And you have a complete lightweight in  leading this. We‚Äôre going to end up with four more years of Trump if you don‚Äôt get your shit together and learn how to be a street fighter. AND replace
It‚Äôs rather disappointing that he ended like this. Because I discovered him through his Fairly Oddparents reviews and thought he was a funny guy. Ever since that Trump rant, he‚Äôs been on a downward spiral.
No, he didn't.   And if he hadn't ignored it and called it a hoax back him January, and hadn't fired the pandemic response team, this wouldn't have gotten this bad.  This is Trump fault. This is his plague.
Not 1 single trump supporter is thinking about voting for Kanye, he is only doing this to take votes from Biden. Kanye has absolutely no chance of winning!

Trump campaign team is pitiful for this.
This gaff doesn‚Äôt hurt you with me. I‚Äôd vote for a goat in a dress before I‚Äôd vote for trump.
Trump's not at fault. The more b's you guys post the more it becomes obvious what's really going on. So keep the propaganda coming. Your putting kids and women on the front line of protest. Cowards
Funny you accept Trump‚Äôs lies
My wife's from there. It's fitting
Humility? Seriously. The guy can't define humility. A president that requires a teleprompter and strings to function is just that. A puppet
Well now. Trump decided to ban companies from doing business with Chinese companies like Tencent. I am pretty sure he doesn't know nor care but he may have caused a huge crash in the gaming/tech industry in the USA because of it. Tencent owns a very large portion of the gaming
I don't know. Because nothing good can happen, probably not. The only silver lining in this election cycle would be the two brain addled, racist ramblings of Biden v Trump. We probably won't even get that.
‚ÄúTrump bans LoL‚Äù   Future headlines write themselves
I think the more these are worn that it will fix itself. They had these and any masks that are President Trump related.
We never should have allowed anything to be shut down.  I never saw anything like this under any virus under the previous administration.  That tells me all I need to know.
As I recall Dr Fauci said masks not effective for months, now all n. He advises Trump. The  mobile hospitals + Navy Hosp ships were fanfare not requested? Getting Ford Motors to produce ventilators no good? Expediting processes thru FDA not good? China travel ban excellent

Misdirection? You are calling a conspiracy in Trump's DOJ. This isn't 2017. He's flushed everyone he could out after the Mueller investigation which is when this one took place. So yes. You don't get taken seriously and get sarcasm.
Never Trump Republicans are a very small fraction, mostly made up of Bush 2 speech writers and neoliberal Reaganomics geeks, who are pretty much responsible for where the Republican Party ended up... Trump is a symptom of 50 years of Republican policies.

Thank you Pastor Trump a man of the...... whatever. He is Gods protector you know.
This was the Hitler election program in 29/30. All Trump needs is to lose 900 pounds grow some hair and grow a little bit of hair under his nose. Then maybe learn how to read but that‚Äôs not a disqualifier.
I am jumping in here to point out that she describes herself as a staunch conservative in one paragraph and a moderate late in the piece.  Am I missing something here?  Real question: Do staunch conservatives count as moderates now that Trump is in office?
Biden and trump are fuckin idiots.

My mom is 84 and a staunch Trump supporter. She does NOT want any vaccines!
Do you watch the news, or just mis-report it? Nearly every Republican who turned down Trump's support in 2018 lost their elections. Nearly all that accepted it won. You are either a blatant liar or you have your head so far up your ass you can lick where your heart should be.
Why would Trump name either of them AG?
They're one of the biggest donors, not to mention the "go-between" for Russian sponsors for Trump
How about forever. Trump was a fan of Herman Cain and it would be an honor for postus to implement the simple tax plan Cain suggests in his policy. And name it after Herman in his honor. Wow, the left would incinerate.

Not sure whether it's the moronic interpretations of the First Amendment, the Jwitter infighting, the antisemitic conspiracy theories or Donald Trump (which is to say, all of the above and more), but Twitter has broken me. I'll be back, but it won't be this week.
I come from a very pro trump republican household and it kills me because I know they have no idea what a united globalized society looks like and they never will.  They like Trump because he's a white business man so anything and everything he does is ok.
Glad to hear that you‚Äôre voting for country over party. If Dems ever put up a candidate as bad as Trump, I will do the same. I‚Äôm in GA. I feel your pain. We‚Äôre not doing any better than FL with  failed leadership here.

Well, Dopey, the Trump Administration‚Äôs  calls it a pandemic.
Bumbling trump may have the Republican nomination, but there is no way a nearly illiterate, self absorbed, crook of his magnitude will win enough votes to remain in office.
Let the BS games begin. How about no debates. What‚Äôs the point?  We all know what Trump will do. He doesn‚Äôt change and his brain will not grow.
Only in Trump‚Äôs America have there been death threats to a doctor and top virologist during a pandemic due to the politicization over wearing a face covering to prevent contagions from exiting an infected respiratory system. Pretty fucked up.

You support Trump, yet you criticize someone else?   He‚Äôs responsible for a hell of a lot of misery &amp; death. You‚Äôre lying to yourself if you won‚Äôt admit it (you won‚Äôt).  Every other country got their sht together, but not US. We‚Äôre a laughingstock. We have no leader, just a fool.
Ooo, are they all going to go to Gitmo?  As I said, I‚Äôm waiting for the Barr October Surprise, which will probably involve FBI. Everyone knows it‚Äôs a politically motivated stunt that won‚Äôt hold up.  Don‚Äôt get too excited. There‚Äôs Trump Truth Commissions coming.
I can easily admit these governors made awful mistakes.  For you, it‚Äôs just a game. You aren‚Äôt capable of admitting Trump made mistakes.   Because we don‚Äôt have quick &amp; dependable testing, we will never get a grip on this. England has a 90 min test. We have a 9 day test.

Yes, I linked it further down. Clearly, Trump didn‚Äôt get the result he wanted.
We had an opportunity to have all the masks we needed, made in the US, set up by a doctor at NIH and an American company. They BEGGED the Trump admin four times in Jan &amp; Feb to set it up. They said‚Äî nah. Idiots &amp; amateurs.

You‚Äôre quoting the Trump villain WHO? Ironic.   I‚Äôm not talking travel bans ‚Äî I‚Äôm talking preparation. Which Trump didn‚Äôt do. Doctors begged him to put in orders for PPE. He refused. He wasted Jan &amp; Feb completely.
And I am not blind nor uninformed nor uneducated nor na√Øve and dumb not downright hateful prejudice people. I love Donald Trump and I need him out office  I do feel with all of my heart Joe Biden will bring America back. I am not a left winger nor am I a right winger.
Legally, Sessions was obligated to recuse. I know the law is unimportant to Trump, but it‚Äôs a fact.  What Trump found offensive was Sessions wasn‚Äôt willing to break the law for him. But Bill Barr is. I never thought I‚Äôd have any respect for Sessions, but he did stick to it.

I certainly hope so. Barr and Trump deserve jail terms.
Yet it never would‚Äôve risen to that number of patients, if Trump had listened to the intel, warnings,&amp; briefings he received, rather than holding rallies, fundraising, &amp; playing golf in Jan &amp; Feb.   He thought it would disappear ‚Äî still does. He‚Äôs a fool. Ultimately, it‚Äôs on him.
My point is that Trump and Trumpism isn‚Äôt the root cause of our problem but a symptom. The root of our problems is a willful ignorance brought on by a refusal to accept facts b/c too many don‚Äôt like those facts. Too many Americans think freedoms includes freedom from reality 1/x

Oh, I‚Äôm prepared for Barr to release an October Surprise of indictments ‚Äî we all know something sleazy &amp; completely political like that‚Äôs coming. Just meant for election, won‚Äôt hold up. Maybe McCabe, Comey, Strzok. Barr is just Trump ‚Äòs Roy Cohn.
Trump is not allowed to operate any type of charity or foundation because of it.

It's part of the way a conman operates, right? Election interference has a meaning--bad or unlawful efforts to interfere with voting. But Trump renders our common language meaningless. It reminds me of the way he uses lawyers to tie up judicial attempts to limit him. Endless bs.

Hitler would not allow any German to say a kind word about a Jew. The left will not allow anyone to say a kind word about Trump or his supporters. Who is being had by whom? How does hate emerge in consciousness? How does it make you stupid? Inquire.
Yes. 71% means a little better than 2 in 3 chance. Meaning between a 1 in 3 and 1 in 4 chance Trump wins.   If you flip a coin 10 times and get heads 3 times, that doesn't mean the coin's broken.
No shit Sherlock. Trump is the worst thing for China and Iran. Russia is small potatoes compared to them.
You mean when they got closer than any other mainstream forecast model and published an article days before the election warning people to be cautious and that Trump was only a normal polling error away from winning?
Russia's an asshole nation who thrives on creating chaos in the world. Trump makes the job way too easy for them it's no surprise that they backed him in 2016 and again in 2020. Putin probably laughs his ass off at what a fool Trump is while he thinks he's the smartest guy.
I'm voting for him, but that's it. To get rid of Trump I would vote for Satan, or a dog, or a paper bag.

I‚Äôm pretty smart. My sons are very smart. We all agree Trump is very smart. They also both believe that they are smarter than Biden. So you need to wake up. Young people can see through your BS.
Are you saying you'll vote for Trump if you don't get who you want? Shame.
I think  's assessment of the possibility of Trump refusing to leave office is essentially right EXCEPT a strong Biden victory might backfire. If Biden is too successful it could play into a "fake votes" narrative. Fox News' will decide how Trump does, not the GOP.

Agreed. I‚Äôm torn, being a proponent of clear policy/political philosophy beliefs from candidates so that voters can make an informed decision. However I think joe is crossing the line and attempting to appease voters he probably already has. This will just make a great trump ad.
Trump was blessed with great genes. Biden does not have Trump‚Äôs work ethic or energy. Biden‚Äôs good genes of his youth are no longer expressed. He‚Äôs an old man, fading toward his finitude. No one can stop that.
The ability to admit mistakes and apologize for those mistakes is one of the most critical differences between Trump and Biden. He is nowhere close to perfect, but still is miles ahead in terms of caring for others. It is our job to hold Biden to these promises once elected.
Betty, I‚Äôm a physician. Trump has a great mind. Biden has a failing mind. Look at Biden videos over the last two years. Something is going on. Let‚Äôs see a cognitive test and EEG. Let‚Äôs inform the public; let‚Äôs bring this out into the light of day.
But.. didn't Trump say that COVID19 was a ploy from the Democrats to discredit him??   STRAIGHT clown behaviour  (But seriously, I need some names, fam. Art thieves don't sit well with me)
Maybe, maybe not‚Äîbut it is important for Biden to stand up to Trump‚Äôs petty insults, and to not concede ground to him.
And you think Trump doesn't have any appalling scandals and blood on his hands? Wow you must not watch TV or see his pictures with women and prostitutes. And hangs out with people who have sex slaves. So don't tell me that Trump is not guilty. Like how he handles his daughter.
Kevin McCarthy will do a great job then handoff to Trump.
Trump great president for the people

It‚Äôs not racist to say your going to make a diverse choice for VP who brings a different perspective to the table. Trump would have been/is labeled a racist because he is one.
Power is the only thing, besides money, that Trump has ever been interested in. Do a search on malignant narcissism and read Mary Trump's book. Trump wants to be America's dictator and Putin and China are working to make it happen.
If you think the GOP assumes people will vote for Kanye just because he‚Äôs black, that‚Äôs an incredibly racist (and wrong) assumption. The GOP assumes people will vote for Kanye because he‚Äôs famous - and they will, largely from younger demographics that don‚Äôt favor Trump.

Donald is either lying or grossly incompetent. It is not possible he could have known so little about Deadly Virus Covid19 (and everything else) from his high position as POTUS. The Pandemic of the Century, and he had no idea what he was doing?

Trump is right. Article published in Science yesterday elucidates why children are immune. There are four endemic coronaviruses that provide cross immunity to COVID-19. We should be having endemic coronavirus parties. The masks may prevent immunity. What a twist!!

Yeah I've seen the Biden Trojan horse propaganda too.   Biden is the most textbook moderate democrat that ever lived.   So the only way Trump can defend America against "SoCiAlisM" is to pretend Biden is a "secret" socialist.   We aren't stupid.  You're the one being conned again
We may not all agree with Trump, but you‚Äôve gotta admit, eliminating payroll taxes will provide incentive for people to work &amp; give people more money. For those that can‚Äôt, unemployment is extended and students loans payment/interest will still be suspended. Everyone is covered

my neighbors took down their trump flag but put it back up the next day :(
Kemp went all in for Trump, and now he can't admit he was wrong, even if it means thousands more GA citizens dying.
Trump wants to be king.  No dissent in any form will be allowed.
Honestly, I think it's just about supreme court justices and rolling back roe v wade for that particular brand of christian supremacist still on board with Trump. That and Trump being willing to hire people that ignore the separation of "church" and state.
Support trump as a Christian.
I live in Atlanta, just 20 miles away from that school. It is an ignorant, Trump-favored community, thus they suck up to our corrupt anti-mask governor. Unsurprising.

Seniors are running from trump. They realize trump does not care if seniors get sick and die.They also know trump doesn't care if grand kids or kids are dead. Lord help us.
Actually Trump allowed each governor to decide its state policies.  Kinda sucks for leftist puppets he isn't the "dictator" you've been blahblahblahing about for years.  Don't worry. You still have RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA to whine about....
Is he Trump? No? Okay, yep, we‚Äôre good. Odds are one of the two candidates will have killed 250,000 people by the time the election rolls around. I‚Äôll give you 83 guesses and I bet you Republicans STILL won‚Äôt get it.
Obama did it in an illegal and non-Constitutional fashion. He lied to everyone and then mandated insurance. I wouldn‚Äôt proclaim success. He should‚Äôve just did what Trump is doing.
I heard you were caught saying how much you despise the USA and all the losers that voted Trump into office, and that you would do anything to bring down Trump and all of his supporters.
The progressive movement hasn‚Äôt taken off because they can‚Äôt get votes. This is shown with Bernie and many DSA candidates.   I‚Äôve seen nobody that predicted the DHS being used as a method for Trump‚Äôs re-election

Election year strategy: make Unemployment Pay a liveable wage, forbid people who want to work from doing so (see gym owners breaking into their business to open), don't allow kids to go to school in-person -- blame Trump for high unemployment.
Other than voting him out what do you think is the solution to stop Trump‚Äôs agenda? I would love to hear something that the majority of Americans would also agree with
Literally what would you do with Trump in office and Republicans with the majority in the senate.   Not everyone is in line with your views, you can see that in many elections

Come on Paul, Comey didn‚Äôt pledge loyalty to an absolute idiot in the Oval. That makes him a hero.Yates is only trying to keep her job &amp; a total wimp.  Even the GOP is now against trump except they are not saying it publicly.  No other president has divided the country as he has!
She‚Äôs a RINO!
Not a lie but an astronomical failure from the very top of our nation all the way down to the teachers of schools.  There would be no debate whatsoever if trump wore a mask and was a REAL leader.
Yeah. At this point I feel like every organization and person who is not pro Trump can get what they want as long as they don‚Äôt get in their own way. Of course, this is something Dems have failed to do time and time again, and Biden also has to not do it to himself either. üòÖ
Buy American? Trump makes over $1 million from store selling products of foreign origins
Unfortunately, you are not wrong. I also think that‚Äôs why he was somehow made the Democratic candidate... b/c he is the easiest target for Trump and Russia to campaign against. Trump will use anything bad that happened in Obama‚Äôs terms against Biden saying he was in on it too. üòÖ
Trump comes across as a buffoon. We all know that. Joe ain‚Äôt exactly acing these appearances either, and the pressure on Biden is minuscule compared to Trump. He should be knocking these appearances out of the park but...
Word is that Israel attacked Lebanon. If true Trump's lie about the generals saying Beirut was attacked makes sense because it came from Jared. Trump would never admit that.
No. Trump is being controlled by Jared and both have to go.

Did Pompeo or Trump do this?

Right, not surprising Rod Blagojevich is a Trump fan, or that he's saying positive things about him since getting a pardon. Of course doesn't surprise me to see Dinesh saying nonsense in support of Trump. I just didn't think 'cosmopolitan' would appeal to his readership.
Joe Biden is a devout catholic and regularly attends Sunday service.   The last time Trump went to church, he gassed peaceful Americans.
FYI Trump is a socialist based on your socialist interpretation  He is not against welfare, social security and many other social programs  Trump aka garbage has indicated that he wants an Obama care type of programs
I bet Trump didn‚Äôt know that New York has a border with Vermont.

I feel sorry for Kanye, his kids, and his wife.  It‚Äôs easy to say what she should do, but the laws make it incredibly difficult for her to act in his best interest.  This latest episode from Trump World is beyond the pale and they‚Äôve drilled below the bottom of the barrel.
Of course Fox is saying trump‚Äôs approval ratings are going up! Duh!  He made them main stream and they will say everything that‚Äôs untrue just to get ratings.  trump is still DOWN in the ratings and both trump and Fox News is sill lying to all Americans!
In 2012, I voted for ‚Äúnone of the above‚Äù precisely because of Trump‚Äôs personal immorality.  Republican and evangelical voters had a much better choice  in the primaries, but chose poorly. After 4 years, Trump cleaned up his act, so he gets my vote.
See, now you're getting into propaganda shit again.  There is no major war happening at the border (pan to a caravan the left COMPLETELY lied about). Crazy how that suddenly just went away. EVERYTHING TRUMP DOES IS MISDIRECTION. If there's something bad, he always deflects.
I love WP support #BLM but they don't need to be offended for us over his comment.We understand what he said vs what is Nambia and where it is located in Trump's imagination.
Why are you sending this to me? To put me in a neat little box? It doesn't exist. I have ONE goal, remove Trump from office. It's up to you and your conscience ads to why you can't unequivocally say Trump is killing people. It's fact. It's provable MANY times over. So why defend?

Most Trump supporters acknowledge he's not a good person. Are there some crazed ones that do? Sure! But the majority of us understand that he's flawed. People who say Christians should only vote for people of good moral character are essentially telling us not to vote, ever.
Any rational adult would struggle debating trump but not for the reasons Geraldo thinks. More like ‚ÄúWTF are you even talking about?‚Äù or ‚ÄúAm I being punked?‚Äù or even ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not going to take this seriously, I‚Äôm not doing this.‚Äù

It is very difficult to watch. It also kills every liberal narrative of Trump being a racist without them looking like complete hypocrites. There are many other videos as well. This one of a fun one. You have to skip a few minutes in to get to Biden.

You‚Äôre clearly stuck with your opinion. I never said Trump has done nothing good, but he has done things much much worse than any President ever has. He won‚Äôt even go under oath, even when impeached because he has no respect for our institutions and no respect for the rule of law

IMO, there is no excuse for supporting the birther theory. However, that doesn't make Trump automatically a racist. It's obvious the sole aim was to make Obama ineligible to run for POTUS, not because he was Black, but because he was kicking Rep's ass. That was the REAL reason /1

Probably the amount. But both sides want tons of pork. Frustrating - they can‚Äôt agree on a basic relief bill and leave the ornaments out of it! Give Trump some credit on this one. He wants to try executive order to get the basics in place.

you know, Tony Alpert in Battlefield Hardline was very literal about his second amendment rights, I have a bad feeling that some of Trump‚Äôs white nationalist followers are just as literal about their second amendment rights as Alpert!
I'm actually from LA, went to school at UCSD.üëç  Trump has said some dumb things, but its hard to deny that he has helped POC with his policies. And you know Biden is no longer a moderate. He needs the left to win this election. Otherwise "Trump-haters" is his only base.
I'm with about Trump. I don't like always like his antics either. He also says things I don't agree with or give me pause. But this is bigger than how I feel about one man. This is about the future of America.
Oh Come ON S. E.  He could pick a tin can and it would be better than Trump and Pence.  If you say differently, you are just looking for excuses to vote for Trump and absolve yourself from responsibility.  PFFFTTTT
This should be a wake-up call for all those people that only hate Trump cause you think he's a "racist". If you're going to apply that term to one, then be fair and apply it to the other. And if you're Black and this doesn't give you pause, you're only confirming what Biden said.

More than 2 years, tens of millions of $$ in taxpayer money wasted found nothing. How many times in the past 3+ years have we heard some version of "this is the beginning of the downfall for Trump". Yet WE'RE the conspiracy theorists. That's like poop telling a fart it stinks.
Trump 2020!
Now do Trump please.
REVEALED: New York prosecutors got Trump's records from Deutsche Bank  via    , nervous yet?? #TrumpIsALaughingStock
I'm not defending Joe Biden because he chose this route...but come on y'all. Make this shit make sense when it comes to the alternative.  Kanye x Trump. Cut the shit bo
What would be wonderful  If Trump, through all this, found that HE CANT do it on his own, or with the support of the powerful men in the world, evil or not  but gives up, and puts it in the Lords hands repents and bows that would be a win
Get another doctor and not one who went to trump university.
Donald J. Trump
Sadly,  is right about #HatchAct in that it does not apply to him.  But read between the lines. He is willing to do whatever he can get away with. Trump is a criminal in every sense of the word.
WHAT ABOUT US AMERICANS THAT DID NOT GET FIRST STIMULUS CHECK &amp; BROKE? F**K YALL while  does NOT BACK PREZ TRUMP OR AMERICANS WHILE WE STARVE! He‚Äôs cute tho, look how cute his cheeks r when he obeys camp Pain KILLING OF CHRISTIANS JEWS &amp; JC FOLLOWERS!
Yes. Marxism is evil, undermines everything good about humanity and turns it into a degenerate cesspool where ppl must create chaos, revert to hyperbolic rhetoric and get overwhelmed with Trump Derangement and create a false reality to support their wild claims.
. must go
A painful lesson to those who thought Trump was a man of the people.  Anyone who may get close to him is required to be tested and get amazingly fast test results.  He refuses to support large scale rapid testing for all and endorse mask wearing #DumpTrumpDayNov3
The AG as recently as Wednesday posted online about her efforts to counter the Trump administration's actions on the census and abortion.
That‚Äôs too bad. She has a great story and I think she can handle Pence. And if Trump is trying to run as the law and order candidate, it seems like she‚Äôd be a great foil for his b.s. But, I‚Äôm a Never Trumper. I guess I‚Äôm out of touch with the base.
and I call Pence a dissapointment as a decent human being.  Is it possible he's a Trump programmed robot?  #BrownNosePence
as a former Republican, I cannot support the Trump takeover of the party and turning it into a loyalty party to a sociopathic and keptocratic meglomaniac #LincolnVoter
why are news organizations giving Trump coverage for his  "coronavirus briefing" when he's using it to further spew his conspiracy propaganda?  give equal time to Biden for messaging his campaign #TrumpForPrison2020
Yes  that doesn't necessarily mean Trump  maybe, don't know  When I see Trump repent, that will be a good day he seems like a Freemason
Care to explain this?
The Letitia James announcement is NOT about Trump according to several reputable journalists. Booo.
Evidence of Biden's cognitive issues: - Trump says so - Stumbling over words sometimes (which I do 15x/day)  Evidence of Trumps cognitive issues: - Stumbling over words - Basic bizarre concepts (inject disinfectant) - Arm/leg loss of control  - Difficulty drinking - Paranoia
LeBron James on President Trump turning off NBA games over protests: 'We could care less' "LeBron James on President Trump turning off NBA games over protests: 'We could care less'"
I don't care about earning your respect. I care about informing so when your house of cards topples and you repeat Trump's lies about "it not being fair or legal." The biggest political swing in our lifetimes is about to happen because more people than not know Trump is terrible.
Check this out: 83% of parents prefer online learning or hybrid learning over in-person schooling. Hard to imagine things getting better for Trump if he goes against that.
McCain's husband is a right wing conservative who espouses libertarian ideology. Neither will vote for a Dem that wants to undo all the damage trump has done to the federal gov. Today's GOP wants a neutered federal gov; one that refuses to intervene in civil rights cases.

when has Trump allowed others to speak - he finally found his match
How can you say that about Biden and get support Trump? Who rambles much more and looks like an idiot in all of his interviews? Talking about winning, spreading false information, just to stick to his narrative? Please.
I NEVER THOUGHT Id SAY THIS, WE NEED U MORE THAN EVER RIGHT NOW! PUT $$$$$ BEHIND ME. I won‚Äôt be weak like  is letting our police /military be bullied &amp; do NOTHING about BLM terrorism!  WE WANT DNA TESTS OF PRES TRUMP &amp;  &amp;ALL USA GOVT! THEY DEAD?
White people are the worst and I'm also not surprised. I'm still convinced Trump secures a second term for that reason.
Kubus:  Patriotism, sensible immigration plan, Poland 1st agenda, build nation for inhabitants  Coulter, Trump, Carlson, MAGA:  Patriotism, sensible immigration plan, America 1st agenda, build nation for inhabitants   *Only difference: USA had slaves 200 yrs ago &amp; aren‚Äôt allowed.
You sound like a Trump supporter. This is exactly the stance immigration hawks like Tucker Carlson and Anne Coulter have.
This is a click bait headline. As always, I suggest you read the article.    Second sentence:  "Overall, the poll found that 43 percent of voters would choose Biden in a present-day matchup whereas 40 would choose Trump.‚Äù BLOTUS is only ahead with midwestern, white, old, men.
She‚Äôs basically supporting everything Trump stands for. Build a country from within. Have national pride and love your country
Youre missing the point. Trump is like Poland &amp; Hungary &amp; wants to limit immigration &amp; just like Poland &amp; Hungary wants to build the nation within &amp; have the best quality of life for the inhabitants. You going to Poland are basically endorsing everything Trump supporters desire.
I cannot stand Trump but this is outrageous. The acquiescence of the entire Democrat establishment and, especially, the MSM is depressing. Where are the patriots?
BECAUSE I DO! I ain‚Äôt showing you unless you concede it to be true and do not attempt to discredit it. These are MY emails with execs at Fox News. I have 4 of them. I know your tactics all too well. For instance, tell me the last negative Trump story that wasn‚Äôt fake news.
What you are witnessing is called "scapegoating."  I'll help you with the definition.  President Trump has failed so badly with managing the Coronavirus, that he is trying to rename it the China Virus so that people will blame China and not him.  Thankfully, most get that.
Yes, I'm aware that the Pres. calls the virus the Chinese Virus, but that is not the virus' name. No one else in the world calls it that. It's name is Coronavirus.  One could call it Trump virus for it killing 154k Americans on his watch I guess?   I still prefer the real name.
trump right now...All the factors? Perhaps I misunderstood your tweet because Trump is pissing on people‚Äôs back and tell them it‚Äôs raining, scary part is people believe him.
Also CIA pumped over $1 Billion into Syria, some ending up in the hands of Al Nusra
I hate GWB as much as the next guy, but please stop with the stupid bull sh!t.    Next you'll tell us Trump killed 150,000 people with the China Virus because he told them to drink bleach.

First you drink the Kool-Aid, then you masturbate Trump tweets
There are several reasons, I‚Äôm sure, but among them is that Trump probably can‚Äôt remember any details, and the particulars would escape him rather easily. He never had the ability to discuss details intelligently, but he‚Äôd be completely out of his element with this.
Of course a Trump supporter says all democrats are racist, but fails to recognize how unbelievably racist the man he supports is.
Thread by  You all know why Trump has now left the White House - being seen off by the entire WH staff before he traveled to Oe he won't be back for awhile - to go to his resort in Bedminster, NJ, right? Everybody focuses on SPYGATE SPYGAT‚Ä¶
Pushed news on my phone.  Falwell stepped down because of unzipped pants photos.  And two months ago, he had to apologize for racial insensitivity.  So, he is following in the footsteps of trump.

Actually that was Hillary who cheated by paying for debate questions and the fake Russia dossier trying to win. Looks like cheaters don't win after all. Btw, thank Hillary for increase taxes to pay for 3yr investigation to prove she cheated but blamed Trump. Smh
It‚Äôs not a red or blue issue. Trump invoked DPA for creation of ventilators and PPE after states had to go through bidding wars b/w themselves for necesssry equipment. Obama left a pandemic playbook (which Trump ignored) and created a pandemic task force (Trump disbanded this).
The trump administration had 3 &amp; 1/2 years to replenish that. Trump admin also disbanded the pandemic task force that was housed at the WH, which could‚Äôve been in charge of this. They also ignored the pandemic playbook by the obama admin that would have addressed this.
Trump will make America super GREAT again if the Democrats will just get out of the way
They need life in prison! Go Trump
The EO on TikTok is coming into focus  One thing becomes clear: The potential TikTok ban isn't really about TikTok.-- certainly seems more about escalating action against China    Possibly because of this  China working against Trump's reelection

Underreported is that Zuckerberg had two private dinners with trump at WH.  Zuckerberg refuses to say what was discussed during those events.
Wow. That was only a year ago? Trump years are long and excruciating, but even more so for the victims of ICE. This was one of his more inhumane acts, timed as children started a new school year.
trump EO against TikTok--In order, WH says TikTok captures vast swaths of info from users, incl location data &amp; Internet search history.     They began US svc 08/02/18 what has changed in 2 yrs 2 make this urgent now?  This is personal or a distraction.
‚ÄúFor President Trump to attack my faith is shameful,‚Äù Biden said in a statement. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs beneath the office he holds and it‚Äôs beneath the dignity the American people so rightly expect and deserve from their leaders."

You have blamed Trump for actions of officers he has no control over, while excusing the actions of politicians who do have control over the officers.  You can feel foolish, but I have asked for evidence that Trump's language has influenced any of the attacks &amp; have gotten none.
They are the ones in control of their city. Trump has zero control over the NYPD. The only people who can do anything about it, if they don't agree, are the city and the state. BTW, they both said the arrest should have happened, just not like that.   But ... "Orangeman Bad!"
Ok.   NYPD (a police department in a state and city that is overwhelmingly Democrat) arrests someone for destruction of property in NYC, but it's all because Trump is mean to the Chinese Communist Party.   Got it.
That was the NYPD.... Again, not Trump...
It was carried out by NYPD. Comrade DeBlasio is the mayor of NYC. Andrew "nursing home eradicator" Cuomo is the progressive governor.   The NY state assembly is 106-42 Democrat over Republican.   These were City police in a Democrat dominated state. But Trump tyranny?
If Trump was the 46th president do you think he'd have given them 46 Days?  I do!
I am still not sure Trump isn‚Äôt going to sacrifice Pence and pick Haley. It would give him both a COVID scapegoat and a woman on the ticket to match Biden.   That said, Biden could pick some rancid meat as his running mate and still have my vote.  #Biden2020
The DemocRATs wrote that law to 're-enslave' black men about the time they founded the KKK.  Come on man, the same DemocRATs formed BLM the new and improved KKK.  Only one who has done any prison reform since LBJ's Great Society destroyed the black family?  President Trump
Dictators don‚Äôt allow violent riots in their streets.  Dictators don‚Äôt allow district judges to tell them what to do, yet Trump has given in to every nationwide injunction issued. Even those overturned in appellate courts.   So tell me, how has Trump acted like a dictator?
Again, how would you condemn China?  Do you agree that the Communists in China deserve to be condemned?  Do you agree, that Trump has very little influence in Democrat bastions such as San Francisco where we see urban youths engaging in racist attacks against Asian Americans?

Trump's dreams of a vaccine as his October Surprise aren't rooted in reality   there are so many anti-Vaxxers who oppose vaccines of any kind, any #COVID19 vaccine would have to be truly safe &amp; effective to convince them &amp; still they may say no
I don‚Äôt use Tik Tok, but it seems to me, if it‚Äôs a real emergency than waiting 45 days to start, would suggest otherwise. Just another Trump action to divert the news cycle.
And this one can be blamed on Trump to I guess.
I‚Äôm sure the left can find a way to blame Trump for this.

It‚Äôs more that just Trump who isn‚Äôt watching.
You still haven't figured out why anyone would vote for Trump? It's simply because the Democrats are so abhorrent.  As it's been for so many of the recent elections, many see Trump as the lesser of two evils. There may be some "Trump cultists", but he was elected by moderates.

..And nothing of value was lost. :x   Taking the L to kill Tencent's influence to me, however petty that may sound, is the only good thing Trump has ever decided to blunder into.  If half of organized gaming cannot survive without a politically motivated Chinese company, tough.

The basis of democracy is the ability of protest. They weren‚Äôt rioting. Trump sending in secret police was an authoritatrian move to prevent people from their constitutional right to assemble.

Crazy Joe is in capable of learning from his mistakes.  He still believes, with notable exceptions 'you aint black' if you are voting for Trump.
Gonna get your book.  We can have differences in policy and how to execute them, and disagree with decency.   #Trump is not only an indecent person, he has made it so that now the whole concept of American democracy is at stake.
Why, it appears the GOP has not only embraced the policies of hate, voter suppression, lies, and denial, but encourages them. Why should anyone trust the GOP. Your father was a great man and he stood up to Trump and the GOP was silent.
Dead Team Trump: Please continue to make mental acuity the cornerstone of your campaign.

You underestimate Trump's evil. Connect the dots, Joy. He doesn't care about the 160K deaths since they are disproportionately black and brown Americans. As a racist, fascist, he views it as a coincidental, handy genocide.
The majority of people still fully committed to voting for Trump are doing it mainly because they LOVE that it pisses certain people off. Has nothing to do with politics, what might benefit them personally -- none of that. Just that it pisses certain people off.

LIE - By 2016 President Obama brought the unemployment rate down for AfricanAmer from16% to 5% left by Bush in 2009. Trump makes claims his policies were the result, when it was obvious rates were still dropping when Obama left office.üëÅ-DELTA-10-Tango

If you told me 20 years ago that the 2020 election would be between Biden and Trump, I'd wonder if the country was nuts?   And I'd be right, too!
Even if it is a plan for Trump, I got no problem with that, Joe Biden, The clintons, Bill Gates, Obama. Etc need to be a as far away as bc possible
It's a diversion from everything else that's going wrong here. Unfortunately, that only works when the person directing the diversion has any amount of credibility, which Trump doesn't.  This is a simple (albeit large and catastrophic) ammonium nitrate explosion.

Trump should sign an 'Executive Order' shutting down all of Twitter.  I sold all my shares a couple of weeks go when it got over $35.

Obama created the recovery from the disastrous years from the previous Republican administration. The longest monthly job creation began under Obama and continued until Trump fucked up the Coronavirus response. Unemployment was declining every year starting under Obama 2/

Fauci just needs to say fuck it and spend time with his family. This is getting stupid that people would listen to Donald Trump instead of a man who has served under five presidents.

Exactly. Democrats have turned over every stone and pebble looking for something. Trump's been investigated so much everyone knows all his dark secrets trying to unseat his presidency. If Hillary can't find it then it doesn't exist

Biden lacks of policy and ideas, Trump has a big chance to win and probably he will, because Electoral college ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, so focus on those states in which he only needs two or three points to win.
He failed just like he failed on getting his love Kim jung un to stop building nuclear weapons. mr deplorable unethical trump will never admit to this failure...it is because he loves dictatorship and is eyeing a dictatorship position. It will not happen in the USA.

That was me, too. Was for Scott Walker, then Marco Rubio, then Ted Cruz. Wouldn't vote for Hillary, couldn't vote for Trump, ended up voting for Evan McMullin (talk about a wasted vote!). This time? Will crawl through glass to vote for President Trump - the Dems are that bad...
You‚Äôre clearly stuck with your opinion. I never said Trump has done nothing good, but he has done things much much worse than any President ever has. He won‚Äôt even go under oath, even when impeached because he has no respect for our institutions and no respect for the rule of law
The opinion of other countries is a minor concern. America first = Trump 2020!

Joe Biden should refuse to debate Trump until he releases his tax returns. If you look at the polls Trump needs these debates more than Biden does. If Biden doesn‚Äôt debate Trump that‚Äôs arguably more harmful to Trump than Biden.

Good. I‚Äôm sure he spoke with trump to get clarification on the virtues of morality.
I do wish Trump has a better grasp on the facts. Goddam it seems like he just reads what is in front of him and has no real connection to it. But, at least he can read and think in semi-complete sentences. Even if they often make no sense.

Disappeared? What the hell are you on about with this talking point? He's been doing events and giving speeches on a weekly basis. Besides, why fight with Trump over the airwaves when Trump continues to damage his own political standing just by talking?
So are you saying that working against your own government under any administration is okay? Trump would have been fine with it because he fires anyone trying to safeguard our democracy and promotes and embraces those who engage in criminal activity.

Safe to say that  is floundering badly in his reelection campaign. The fact that his staff doesn't care to see it, will only serve to help  win in a landslide
Remember that  said this was an attack, without facts to back that claim up. Trump is dangerous.  Fact-checkers conclude Beirut explosion was not nuclear blast and Lebanon cites ammonium nitrate stored in warehouse as the cause

Biden lacks of policy and ideas, Trump has a big chance to win and probably he will, because Electoral college ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, so focus on those states in which he only needs two or three points to win.
He failed just like he failed on getting his love Kim jung un to stop building nuclear weapons. mr deplorable unethical trump will never admit to this failure...it is because he loves dictatorship and is eyeing a dictatorship position. It will not happen in the USA.
I don't know. Because nothing good can happen, probably not. The only silver lining in this election cycle would be the two brain addled, racist ramblings of Biden v Trump. We probably won't even get that.

White people are the worst and I'm also not surprised. I'm still convinced Trump secures a second term for that reason.

What you are witnessing is called "scapegoating."  I'll help you with the definition.  President Trump has failed so badly with managing the Coronavirus, that he is trying to rename it the China Virus so that people will blame China and not him.  Thankfully, most get that.
Yes, I'm aware that the Pres. calls the virus the Chinese Virus, but that is not the virus' name. No one else in the world calls it that. It's name is Coronavirus.  One could call it Trump virus for it killing 154k Americans on his watch I guess?   I still prefer the real name.

Joe Biden should refuse to debate Trump until he releases his tax returns. If you look at the polls Trump needs these debates more than Biden does. If Biden doesn‚Äôt debate Trump that‚Äôs arguably more harmful to Trump than Biden.

And btw, Trump is a HUGE national security risk. He breaks protocol for no reason, ignores U.S. intelligence briefs, and flirts with our adversaries. 100% agree that he is dangerous. I just also believe that people with access to sensitive info need to be careful - not impulsive.

Do you actually believe that? Because nothing the GOP has done lately could be considered libertarian. Hell, most of them are considered conservatives anymore. They are a cult that follows Trump into the abyss.
Imagine going from a top news station to a sell out propaganda pushing, trump hating oped that gets laughed at by every other news agency.
This tells just how unhinged the Democratic Party has become. They‚Äôll stand up Charles Manson and his followers (Bush and his acolytes) as representative of an honorable party with integrity. Why? Trump Derangement Syndrome.
These people have regained full credibility after helping lead this nation into a war we‚Äôre still mired in. Why? Trump Derangement Syndrome. These people have forfeited America‚Äôs future with the sinkhole they created in the Middle East, and still they‚Äôre favored ober progressives
This is what I call Trump Derangement Syndrome. Michelle Obama fondly hugs the guy who stole the WH in 2000 and started multiple illegal wars, not mention handing the governments treasury to his rich buddies. We have ex Bush officiados &amp; war mongering conservatives all over MSNBC
But hey, at least they were nice and polite as they royally fucked the American people. Not like the cruel, obnoxious Trump who passed the same policies, but is so personally toxic as a human being. THIS is the party of sociopaths Biden is so eager to work with.
According to Biden, Obama, and the Democratic establishment this is the GOP they want to return after Trump leaves. You know, that honorable party who was polite as they stole elections, started  illegal wars, and handed over government functions and tax revenue to big business.

So we don't have one member in the #Democratic party willing to tell us the briefing. What's the worse that can happen if they disclose it. This makes no sense that trump can classify things to help him and we are in the dark.
Plan. After trump wins, strike a deal with The entire pacific coast, including Mexico, supporting democratic secession from the union. They‚Äôve floated the idea already. However, in doing so we could give Dems what they want, to include no wall. And they can live in shit together

Trump‚Äôs adminstration is the most corrupt in history. Just look at the number of indictments and convictions (and the head of crime family overturns them). He will say anything to divert attention from the pandemic he‚Äôs mismanaged.
Trump will win by a landslide and you will be looking for a new career.
I will go on the record again. Biden will not be on the ballot for President. He will be replaced, most likely he skips the debates...the Dems install someone after that doesn‚Äôt have to debate Trump.

The fact any state outside the reddest of the red has Trump behind in single digits should be alarming to Democrats, especially after 2016. But they‚Äôre so beholden to their corporate and wealthy donors they scared as hell to cross them.
Let me help you decode anyone calling themselves a swing voter, they support Trump but will no way in hell admit it. Which means the polls mean nothing, much like they didn‚Äôt in 2016. Democrats ignore this at their own peril.
Exactly. You mean like the polls that had Hillary overwhelmingly beating Trump. Now that was some great science there!

Well my ability to prognosticat is not very good. You think Trump is terrible. Do you honestly believe Biden the dementia patient is better? You're not punishing the GOP if you would vote for Pence.  Do think Biden won't resign? You have to be voting for his VP, or not at all.

tRUMP has zero credibility. HE was a part of the greatest political crime of the Century and  the GOP knew EVERYTHING! tRUMP colluded with Russia , China and Ukraine. Ask HIM under oath. DEMOCRATS should start playing the REPUBLICAN game!
One minor correction.   The only person who makes tRUMP look bad is tRUMP himself!   When he starts telling more lies to cover up the other lies he already told he always f*cks things up!
Some fundamental changes to the parties are needed. The party does not control who runs, the people select the candidate based on the rules. The candidate rights the platform. I know why Trump in 16 Why Biden in 20? Dem voters were going to send a socialist or a dementia patient?They know.  Seniors are running from trump. They realize trump does not care if seniors get sick and die.They also know trump doesn't care if grand kids or kids are dead. Lord help us.

Trump comes across as a buffoon. We all know that. Joe ain‚Äôt exactly acing these appearances either, and the pressure on Biden is minuscule compared to Trump. He should be knocking these appearances out of the park but...
Word is that Israel attacked Lebanon. If true Trump's lie about the generals saying Beirut was attacked makes sense because it came from Jared. Trump would never admit that.

I don't care about earning your respect. I care about informing so when your house of cards topples and you repeat Trump's lies about "it not being fair or legal." The biggest political swing in our lifetimes is about to happen because more people than not know Trump is terrible.
Check this out: 83% of parents prefer online learning or hybrid learning over in-person schooling. Hard to imagine things getting better for Trump if he goes against that.

Youre missing the point. Trump is like Poland &amp; Hungary &amp; wants to limit immigration &amp; just like Poland &amp; Hungary wants to build the nation within &amp; have the best quality of life for the inhabitants. You going to Poland are basically endorsing everything Trump supporters desire.
I cannot stand Trump but this is outrageous. The acquiescence of the entire Democrat establishment and, especially, the MSM is depressing. Where are the patriots?
BECAUSE I DO! I ain‚Äôt showing you unless you concede it to be true and do not attempt to discredit it. These are MY emails with execs at Fox News. I have 4 of them. I know your tactics all too well. For instance, tell me the last negative Trump story that wasn‚Äôt fake news.
What you are witnessing is called "scapegoating."  I'll help you with the definition.  President Trump has failed so badly with managing the Coronavirus, that he is trying to rename it the China Virus so that people will blame China and not him.  Thankfully, most get that.
Yes, I'm aware that the Pres. calls the virus the Chinese Virus, but that is not the virus' name. No one else in the world calls it that. It's name is Coronavirus.  One could call it Trump virus for it killing 154k Americans on his watch I guess?   I still prefer the real name.

Well my ability to prognosticat is not very good. You think Trump is terrible. Do you honestly believe Biden the dementia patient is better? You're not punishing the GOP if you would vote for Pence.  Do think Biden won't resign? You have to be voting for his VP, or not at all.
This is a great video that will fall on deaf ears to those that need to see it. Trump is purely a con man and all his actions have been to enrich himself. But his supporters don't care and don't realize they have also been conned.

Joe Biden should refuse to debate Trump until he releases his tax returns. If you look at the polls Trump needs these debates more than Biden does. If Biden doesn‚Äôt debate Trump that‚Äôs arguably more harmful to Trump than Biden.
trump always says he will do something in ‚Äútwo weeks‚Äù and yet nothing ever happens.  Not only is trump illiterate but he cannot even tell time or keep from telling lies which he‚Äôs done over 42 thousand times.  Tiny children don‚Äôt lie that much.

Dear hypocrit, please stop. Trump is going down and he HAS to. He's killing people with his stupidity and you're too brainwashed to see that. EVERYTHING he does/says is TOXIC.
This is my point Joseph, only right media is telling you this.   Think about this in terms of common sense, okay? Be objective for a minute. In what world can you record rioting footage of your own America (Trump's) and then use that footage saying it would be Biden's America?

Trump voters, my friend. The polls though
"Let's see if all" is improper/fragemented grammar. Loved Trump's softball-question laden Fox &amp; Proven Liars interview this morning that he COMPLETELY whiffed on. "Hey folks, if you thought it couldn't get any worse for Trump after the Chris Wallace interview, I give you AXIOS!"
And yet STILL Trump is the worst president, by far. At least 120k deaths he's now responsible for, solely. Stupidity does not an excuse make.

Same reason Trump wants the 100% M&amp;E deduction as the bill is seen as must-pass and so anything that they can sneak in, now's the time, whether or not it has anything to do with COVID-19. Especially since Trump's veto threat is empty; he can't afford to be obviously the killer.
Trump's understanding of conservatism is basically just enough to do Rush Limbaugh's (or Tucker Carlson's or Sean Hannity's) act on steroids, without much underlying understanding of the conservative/GOP policy priorities needed to inform those acts.
IMHO: Dems need to give up on getting back the full SALT deduction no matter how much their donor class wants it back, and the GOP needs to cave on state &amp; local assistance‚Äîmake it a no-interest loan so it scores as zero net spending.
I pray this will backfire on them. Trump has destroyed so many lives. I pray people are paying attention this time around.

Trump was asking a question in lieu of the fraudulent mail-in voting that has taken place in NY.  Only Congress can delay the election and he knows that.  Would you rather have an honest election or one that we know will be fraudulent? That is the question he is really asking.

The lefties who wanna VBNMW won‚Äôt actually do anything to help Biden get ellected they just wanna shame people who will do otherwise because it feeds into their superiority in the ‚Äúdiscourse.‚Äù An impotent thing when your most signifigant political action is voting.
He just endorsed Biden/Harris.
Fight in brothers. It‚Äôs just a warm up if Biden wins which would be a cold day in hell. But if the libs find a way to cheat there will be civil war in this country like you never seen. Then tell me who is going to get the best down not the right.
No the left are the raciest ones. Biden I will only pick a African American woman. That‚Äôs discrimination and Harris is descendent of slave owners all facts. So you tell me who the raciest are and hypocrites.
Biden-Harris biggest fraud in history Biden broke the Equal Pay Act of 1963 Saying he pick a African American woman. Discrimination! Harris is not African American. Harris is a descendent of a family who owned 86 slaves. Who are the Raciest &amp; Hypocrites? Report the truth
If he loses, he will be escorted out of the White House by the USSS on the moment Biden is sworn in.
Never thought he'd endorse Biden
He's obviously voting for Biden then
Where are Pelosi and Schumer? Have they decided to let Biden handle all responsibility for dissent?

Don't be surprised if that is exactly when shootings will start, esp if Trump claims the Biden victory was illegitimate.  I also wouldn't be shocked if something happened before the election which precipitates Trump calling for martial law.  I say the future is unpredictable.
So think of it this way. Biden Harris win. And gop wins house. Kevin McCarthy is now speaker. Biden ‚Äúdies‚Äù and Harris becomes president. Kevin does not become Vice President. Harris gets to choose her VP. Which is a highly unlikely scenario.
I know this is from May 2020 but... Seems kinda odd...and convenient...and scary af. So, is how Harris/Biden can b polling ahead of  even tho VP Biden refuses to answer even 1 simple question? Seems like a way to interfere in &amp; steal an electionü§îüò≥

Deane Bonner has been recovering from an attack of vertigo over the last couple of weeks. When the former head of the Cobb NAACP heard the news that Joe Biden¬†asked Kamala Harris to be his running mate, she felt a jolt.
Fucker never made it here before he went the knee again. I would have chosen, him or Tulsi or yang. Trump is my fourth pick. Staying home is my 5th. Biden was never gonna get it from me.
The first domino has fallen. Of course, he‚Äôll end up as a highly paid CNN legal analyst. And if Biden wins, the investigation will end.

It's too bad for you Obama isn't the one running against Trump. Joe Biden is. He has 8.3 million followers. 78 million less than Trump. Bahaha!
If you‚Äôre going to go do hard against mail-in voting, you need to vote in person. That‚Äôs my opinion on the matter.  I honestly don‚Äôt care what Obama or Biden did or didn‚Äôt do lol
President Trump talks with the media more then any other President ever. Biden comes out to accuse Trump for all kinds of things makes all kinds statements &amp; accusations talks like he is some kind of leader then walks away from the Mike without taking even one softball question.
We know Biden did not pick Harris for her political skills she has non. He picked her to be his Pit Bull attack dog. He knew she attack lie make stuff up about Trump &amp; basically be ruthlessl towards him. She is there to do nothing but attack him &amp; lie 24/7 along with the media.

You don‚Äôt have to be crazy about him.  Ask yourself if you want 4 more years of trump and then happily vote for Biden.
Trump is blamed for everything so if that rapist Joe Biden (someone that is the reason for mass incarceration of black people) wins I will blame him for everything. If the Braves lose. If my dog dies. If I break a bone.
Did Mike Pence just say that he‚Äôs going to beat Biden‚Äôs meat??
First Biden does not know what day it is. Harris is about the biggest hypocrite there is.  Biden probably does not even know who his running mate is. If he was asked a question he probably answer a question from two days ago &amp; Harris will just make up a pure lie.
Their tactic is to lie and smear and just make up total BS about Trump and his White House then duck and run.  Like the Taliban they make a surprise ambush then run away. Well that‚Äôs what Biden &amp; Harris are doing.
What do you expect the Dems lie about everything along with the left wing media.  Now Biden and Harris are on a totally lying smear campaign.  But they won‚Äôt take even softball question from the media.

I'll take a chance on the USPS. Images of the mailbag scene from Christmas on 34th St, all for Biden/Harris.
the fact that some people are choosing to not vote over both trump and Biden doesn‚Äôt sit right with me
Wow. Such desperation from the Biden camp.
She is a big part of their plans. What I see is Biden gets elected and takes demands from Nancy then he has to step down because of health problems Kamala takes over and appointments Nancy as VP then somehow Nancy takes over and then you have hell on earth.

I will add I don't expect schools to stay shut down forever.  I just expect them to open and operate safely for all.  Based on verifiable photos we've seen from the past week, I think it's safe to say these schools have many improvements to make.
Anyone with sense would be upset at someone attempting to down play the potential spread from kids to adults.  Especially when it happened to them.  If your ACTUAL argument is there is such a small chance that it doesn't worth shut downs, ok.  But the possibility IS there.
Now if you have some proof to disprove my Covid results or otherwise, I‚Äôm all ears. Otherwise, I‚Äôd suggest taking some classes on how to hold a civil discussion instead of utilizing ones profile description to get out of a conversation.

The COVID result, the fact that I got it from a kid playing organized sports, or both?
I just honestly want to know how Biden got the nomination lol. Like, I honestly want to know how democrats could look at their candidates, and go for him. Like sure, he was Obama‚Äôs VP, and everyone loved Obama, but that was 11 years ago. Times have changed
Go to Antifa website and it takes you right to Joe Biden‚Äôs campaign. So it shows Biden supports Antifa and BLM outside of being a Racies. I thought this was Anerica and his pick was going to be a Black Female. If Trump said that the media would go berserk.
So.... are you saying you‚Äôre not voting for Biden?
Biden did the most raciest thing he could possibly do. In this country we pick people based on experience not race. But Biden picked a VP based on Gender and  color. So he said he would pick a woman of color. So it just shows he is a bigger raciest then thought.
The designation of who is fash is meaningless, it‚Äôs a bullshit term that gets thrown around to much. Also Biden‚Äôs been trying to and had bragged about cutting social security for ages. They‚Äôre not different. There‚Äôs a market reason the libs wanna cut it.

please call Biden-Hair Ass out on their lies. Biden speech today is despicable. Can‚Äôt let them win. Please remind people she is not Afro American
Katie people listening to Biden right now are screaming at their screens. Don‚Äôt let them get away with the lies they are spreading.
Im not a republican but my parents are. They live in Pennsylvania and theyre voting for Biden time. How he handled Covid is the reason why. They‚Äôre older so they‚Äôre higher risk and they dont feel like Trump is taking it seriously.

Biden can‚Äôt do it. Body and mind won‚Äôt allow it.
Don‚Äôt fall for it!!! Don‚Äôt let him draw support from Biden. We must be unified to defeat Trump.
Biden and Harris will most likely win (as long as Biden remains out of the public eye). Harris will replace him pretty early on and run for re-election in 2024. We won't have a chance to address the real issues until 2028 but by then things will likely be too late.
Kamala is running along side KKK Supporting Joe Biden. What an inclusive ticket the Democrats have arranged.
How many of you really believe Biden had anything to do with selecting Kamala Harris? Yeah, me either...

Kamala as Biden's VP pick?  What do you suppose she was thinking??
No they wont be.  Theyre sick of being trapped in the house because of your mismanagement of Covid.  They want out of the house and that means voting for Biden.
Joe Biden didn't pick anyone, he was picking his nose when the Deep State chose Heels Up Harris
Honestly doesn't matter...Joe can debate or not...you can have Kamala or not...BIDEN WILL NOT EVER WIN!!!
Think I‚Äôm gonna skip this years presidential election, tired of choosing the lesser of two evils! I hate Kamala Harris and I hate Trump, Biden is just a dumbass in the way

Anybody believe Biden had anything to do with the selection?
Post a couple Pro Biden Tweets, you should be fine.
Hold up, both of you. The "I would veto m4a" line is worthy of criticism because to VETO it means it already got THROUGH congress. That would be trashing a big win. Biden remains a better option than Trump. It's colossally stupid for him to threaten veto on prog legislation tho!
Yeah, because those  ratings are through the roof. Biden does online town halls and gets 19 viewers. Unless  gives a press conference detailing her rise to the top - Willie Brown - no one would watch.
Kamala Harris is the First Indian American to be selected to run for President after she gets rid of Mindless Joe Biden!!! And I thought they said they were going to nominate a Black Woman. Oh well, four more years...‚Ä¶...
‚ÄúHe (Biden) caves to the extreme left whenever he needs to. Harris is way to the left of what Biden used to be, of course at the moment they‚Äôre kind of in sync. Dick Morris
It only makes sense a raciest Biden pick another raciest for his VP pick.  Just shows he stays true to his raciest values.
Anyone but Trump  (by anyone I mean Biden, shut up Kanye)
Intelligent people will research that video showing Joe Biden saying the N word and will learn that he was criticizing the words of a racist bigot.
This literally makes 0 sense, Biden and Harris are literally republicans wearing paper thin Democrat suitsüòÇ

Well that was quick!  Bypassed by Biden, Abrams likely to focus on 2022 rematch against Kemp
And now CNN is setting the stage to admit that Biden isn't fit for office in February. They'll begin pushing for him to step aside then.
Kamala Harris also laughed about separating children from their parents in prison. Her and Joe Biden want to take away AR-15s away from the American people.  already exposed this woman on the debate stage. How do people celebrate her.
Congratulations!!!   I am so happy, words cannot express my feelings !! A Biden / Harris ticket is phenomenal!! The two of you are the dynamic duo of hope!!!! I can‚Äôt wait to go out and vote for the both of you!!
Fairly powerless VP? Have you seen Joe Biden? I don't give him a year before he's removed from office under the 25th. She will end up President if they win.  Better she be neither.
Really doesn't matter who Biden picked...
sure ain‚Äôt learn about biden‚Äôs crime bill in school. not surprised.. bc i ain‚Äôt kno bout none of this.
was biden my first pick? no. am i thrilled with him picking harris? no. will i vote for them because doing anything else will result in 4 more years of trump? yes i absolutely will bc i refuse to let my frustrations with the ticket get us 4 more years of corruption and hatred.

The suspense is over. Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden announced on Tuesday afternoon that Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) is his vice presidential running mate.
This GOP line doesn't seem to stick on Biden or Harris....for gods sake woman - Harris was an Prosecutor / Attorney General - her policy - prosecutor record are center right. She backed MFA in primary and Joe wants ACA. COME ON LOL

So you‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs better to vote for Biden who‚Äôs receiving millions than Jorgensen who‚Äôs received 4000 ok

i agree...after his next term. Look at facts, how many peace treaties did Biden/Obama do? Prison reform? Cutting medication pricing(very big for my family)? tax cuts? The economy would be crazy big right now if it wasn't for COVID.
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS PICKED A STRONG WOMAN THAT HAS HIS BACK, HAVE THE AMERICA PEOPLE BACKS NO MATTER WHAT RACE THEY ARE!!  SENATORS HARRIS YOU WILL HELP VP BIDEN BRING AMERICA OUT OF HELLLLLLLLLLLL WHERE TRUMP AND HIS CURRUPT ENABLERS HAS PUT US!!! MAY GOD BLESS YOU SISTER!!
If we had an honest media Biden would be polling at about 30% or less. Only the far left extremist would be supporting him.
SISTER HARRIS YOUR MOTHER LIVES IN YOUR HEART,SHE'S ALWAYS WITH YOU &amp; PROTECTING YOU!!!! SHE IS VERY PROUD OF YOU AS I AM!! DON'T LET ANYONE DICTATE TO YOU WHAT YOU CAN AND CAN'T DO!! YOU ARE A CHILD OF GOD!! YOU ARE STRONG, BRILLIANT!! YOU WILL HELP BRO. BIDEN WIN THIS ELECTION
didnt Biden screw it up worse? And he is supposed to be her partner.
this is a nuanced and divisive issue and ppl are making good points on why you should or should not vote for the biden/harris ticket. but this thread is very relevant.
I mean, at least Biden is going after swing states. Hillary couldn't be assed to speak to the plebs, as there were rich donors to talk to.
Is it really easy? Tucker is easy. Commala is a bit more of a challenge. But don't throw shade when biden can't do it correctly.  Plus I bet a dollar biden screws it again.
Leaders in the Chattahoochee Valley are reacting to the news of former Vice President Joe Biden announcing Senator Kamala Harris as his vice presidential running mate.

Biden is counting on folks like you who are ill informed. Please dig deeper for the truth. I know it is difficult to find because the MSM is biased. The democrat party wants to send the innocent preborn to death and that is horrific.
Lee also trots out the socialist straw man but Biden and most Democrats are not socialists. If they were, Biden would not be the nominee.

Within minutes of the presumptive Democratic nominee's announcement Tuesday, false information was circulating on social media, claiming that Harris had called Biden a "racist" and that she is not eligible to be president.
BIDEN WILL NOT MAKE IT FOR THE NEXT 4 YEARS!!üò± HE'S ALREADY HAD A BRAIN STROKE! LOOK IN HIS EYES!
...the fact we have to pick between two different scum bags should say enough about the current state of our nation. A lot of people are supporting Biden just so Trump isn‚Äôt the president anymore, and I the homophobic and racist isn‚Äôt from the actual person but their policies.
Wow cannot believe Im about to have to block so many WHITE people for immediately being pieces of shit after Kamala was picked as the VP. Im all in for the Biden/Harris ticket
I mean, that‚Äôs a big reason why I personally don‚Äôt like Biden. So to say that the reasons he‚Äôs ‚Äúdemonized‚Äù are not based in truth is very shortsighted and letting your bias cloud your judgement. There are many legit reasons to dislike Biden, just like trump. More so for Trump tho
She‚Äôs so nasty, damn good choice. Until she dropped out she was getting this 69 year old southern white boys vote. I‚Äôm damned proud Joe picked her. Great choice!!!! She could be President and It shows Biden‚Äôs good judgement.
know Joe Biden ad sierra club.
Are you crazy.  He was not the one to get sued for housing discrimination you and your father were!!!! enough said . joe biden black voter not you!!!!!!
I am not trying to justify anything for Trump. I was however pointing out the hypocrisy of the original post of the media clipping parts of Biden's videos and using them out of context being wrong but the same is done to Trump and there is nothing wrong with that.
I applaud Shaun King for supporting Biden and Harris. Putting aside your personal feelings for the greater good (Defeating Trump) is what we all need.
From the start, some Biden advisers saw Harris as a logical choice. She was among the party's most popular figures, a deft debater and a fundraising juggernaut.
She‚Äôs going to bat for the idea that women are capable and qualified, not necessarily for Biden.
No centrist would want Biden or Trump. Honestly both are just serving their corporate donors and not the people.
I'll vote for trump or not at all tbh. I was grudgingly voting for Biden after he was picked by the DNC (not the american people) to be the nominee. Now Harris was only wanted by Wall Street, not voters.   Its shameful to think Biden will be any different from Trump as president.

Bernie lost the progressive vote as soon as he bent the knee for Biden and gave up everything he stood for.
Sadly they know that progressives will grudgingly vote Biden so they chose Harris specifically as a slap in the face to progressive views instead of shoring up the vote. They already know their eggs are in one basket and want to stomp out all the resistance to their corruption
Honestly if you are a progressive, neither Biden nor Trump will give you anything that you want and they want you to lose hope.
is very much against the people. The Kamala pick was also just another slap in the face to any progressive who tries to convince themselves that Biden is even a little bit forward thinking with the likes of Warren or Sanders whispering in his ear.
Thoughts on Kamala VP Pick: Biden is absolutely just a figure head with no real policies that he has other than whatever Wall street tells him to do. So with Kamala being his VP, her policy will ultimately dictate his. She has a shitty history from when she was a prosecutor &amp; 1/2
He certainly is not Christlike. I think Biden is Christlike.
Kamala Harris, congratulations but how are you voting on take our guns away when blacks are killing blacks,#1 crime in America always to this day. You and Biden are a joke,leave our country and know what opressions about,from a white God Fearing loving man that despises you
Look, don‚Äôt vote for Biden just because you hate Trump. Biden is senile and is as corrupt as they come. Also don‚Äôt get me started in Kamala Harris. What I‚Äôm trying to get at is just vote for Jo if you hate Trump.
Congrats on becoming Biden's running partner. #KamalaHarrisForVP
After reflection and a quick informal social media review concerning Biden's choice of Kamala Harris, I have determined that people who weren't going to vote for Biden still aren't and people who supported Biden still do.
So tell me Rick, you voting for Biden this year? Really? You are going to support a candidate who believes its ok to murder babies in the womb?

Mama doesn‚Äôt like Pence being alone with women, so Biden can chaperone.
Not crazy about her but then I don't like anyone.  She was the obvious pick when Biden said he would pick a minority woman. Her primary performance was underwhelming, she won't add her state to Biden column, but she will help secure black voters and progressives.
Congratulations President Trump‚Ñ¢ on Candidate Joe Biden's¬© naming of Kamala Harris¬Æ as V.P. pick.
He legit thinks they just named Kamala from the 80s WWF as Biden's VP.  Also, apropos of nothing, my phone tried to change Biden to Vixen, so I think my phone is drunk.
I‚Äôm excited for Kamala Harris. Biden is still CREEPY AF but I‚Äôll take my chance with him.
That's exactly what the debate will be like...Biden will be given the questions and his staff will put the answers on cue cards!!!

Biden lost the candidacy in 2016 to a person who then lost to Trump its hugely egotistical of him for un and steal votes from Jo. You see how that logic works out?
1. She gets into the debates and destroys Trump and Biden and wins in a landslide
How have I shown this by not voting for Biden?
I‚Äôm not trying to rationalize anything I think you‚Äôre mad because there‚Äôs a candidate better than Biden
Biden and Trump are and I support neither
No you‚Äôre right but continuing corporate subsidies, continuing the war in the Middle East, gun control, continuing the war on drugs, continuing the militarization of the police and many other things are impossible enough for me to not vote for Biden or Trump
Mathematically she can though she‚Äôs on enough ballots to hit 270 so let‚Äôs get her on the debate stage then Trump and Biden can prove why they are the better candidate
You keep saying that but ya know I just don‚Äôt believe it maybe you should keep repeating it over and over instead of providing a reason for me to vote for Biden other than he‚Äôs not Trump
I wouldn‚Äôt vote for Biden anyways I‚Äôm not siphoning votes from anyone and if you believe I am then you‚Äôre admitting that Jo‚Äôs policies are better than Biden‚Äôs but #BlueNoMatterWho ammiright
I am not comparing Trump to Biden. I am stating that the politicians that make the laws are the ones to blame since they promise the same thing every two and four years and never deliver what they promise. They were doing it before Trump and it will continue after
And it‚Äôs not supporting trump because Biden and nobody else is entitled to your vote
I like to hear your plan on this Pandemic not some babble about Joe Biden.

I still think had it not been Biden, Kamala would have been the consensus. She was the most qualified outside of Warren.
A Biden presidency would be much more like a despot than the allegatations from the Left that Trump is. Biden is his ticket now, and not a single press conference this week has he taken questions. Contrast that with Trump, who if anything, is too accessible and transparent!
5.  I do believe this actually is a devious plan for them. Get supposed ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù Biden to fool everybody, he then wins, and drops out a year later and there is your President Harris. You all better turn out to vote for Trump, and better convince your family, friends etc too!

love u your tweets movies I thought of good tag for Biden n Harris  Joe n Hoe
We know Biden did not pick Harris for her political skills she has non. He picked her to be his Pit Bull attack dog. He knew she attack lie make stuff up about Trump &amp; basically be ruthlessl towards him. She is there to do nothing but attack him &amp; lie 24/7 along with the media.
Tucker Carlson revealed the scariest truth about Joe Biden selecting Kamala Harris as his VP  via
"I don‚Äôt think he really cares about what a 30-something Pod Save America host thinks about him, and that honestly might be why he‚Äôs the nominee.‚Äù
You don‚Äôt have to be crazy about him.  Ask yourself if you want 4 more years of trump and then happily vote for Biden.
Did Mike Pence just say that he‚Äôs going to beat Biden‚Äôs meat??
First Biden does not know what day it is. Harris is about the biggest hypocrite there is.  Biden probably does not even know who his running mate is. If he was asked a question he probably answer a question from two days ago &amp; Harris will just make up a pure lie.
Their tactic is to lie and smear and just make up total BS about Trump and his White House then duck and run.  Like the Taliban they make a surprise ambush then run away. Well that‚Äôs what Biden &amp; Harris are doing.
What do you expect the Dems lie about everything along with the left wing media.  Now Biden and Harris are on a totally lying smear campaign.  But they won‚Äôt take even softball question from the media.

You‚Äôd think she‚Äôd put her country over her party. She knows Joe Biden well and knows that he‚Äôd be an outstanding President. She also knows that her father would have already endorsed him and would have likely been his Secretary of Defense.
I'll take a chance on the USPS. Images of the mailbag scene from Christmas on 34th St, all for Biden/Harris.
Wow. Such desperation from the Biden camp.
She is a big part of their plans. What I see is Biden gets elected and takes demands from Nancy then he has to step down because of health problems Kamala takes over and appointments Nancy as VP then somehow Nancy takes over and then you have hell on earth.

They should have stood up when Biden tapped Kamala then.
Personally I am thrilled that the ticket is Biden and Harris. Not that I would want them to win and not that I think that ticket can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt win, but considering we very well could have been looking at Sanders/Abrams or something like that I think we‚Äôve dodged a bullet.
And Biden mispronounced his running mate‚Äôs name. ü§î But then, maybe it was victory for him to even remember it.

Trump on Biden-Harris:  ‚ÄúThey don't want to have cows, they don't want to have any form of animals."  Trump is confusing Biden-Harris for Bart Simpson.
when it come this presidential election wanna be with yall but the differences between a biden platform and a trump one are significant enough for me to show up. if we get a plan to just deplatform the executive branch by november ill be there in a heartbeat, tho
I‚Äùve been calling Fauci ‚ÄúHerr Fauci‚Äù for his intoxicity on unelected power he‚Äôs been given by the media and Democrats...but now we have to add  to be addressed as well as ‚ÄúHerr Biden‚Äù since he wants to be the mask police apparently if he wins with a national mandate
Those of you who know me, know I am in favor of VOLUNTARY mask use (and or in a case where a PRIVATE business requires it such as airlines). To do a federal mandate on this is police state facism. If Biden wins, here comes the mask GESTAPO

What is Jeanine Pirro saying? Why would she say something so cruel, regarding Biden?  Why does she have a platform anywhere?
Did you forget about Tara Reade or Kamala's affair with Willie Brown. What about Hunter Biden? How about all the photos &amp; videos of JB getting handsy with little girls? ü§î
Team Biden and Kamala let‚Äôs make history
I have an 8 &amp; 11 yr old girl. It doesn't take Kamala running for VP to make them feel strong and confident. I have raised them to know how capable they are. Kamala is not a good example. &amp; Biden definitely isn't.
You are Dem operative and everyone knows it. To ever say you are a conservative is just a joke. You know Biden will be humiliated on debate stage
I don't think you people actually understand our rigged ass voting system.  Votes against Biden/Harris AND Trump won't have electorate pull.  Then what? He fucks us to death?  If you really wanted someone else, the work to be done was the last years - in a still frigged system üí©

Hey. I know logic and practicality escape you, and thats ok, but can you sell on Biden/Harris? Just let me ask you four (4) "why" questions and see if you can sway my vote to destroy this country. How 'bout it?
I will add I don't expect schools to stay shut down forever.  I just expect them to open and operate safely for all.  Based on verifiable photos we've seen from the past week, I think it's safe to say these schools have many improvements to make.
Anyone with sense would be upset at someone attempting to down play the potential spread from kids to adults.  Especially when it happened to them.  If your ACTUAL argument is there is such a small chance that it doesn't worth shut downs, ok.  But the possibility IS there.
Now if you have some proof to disprove my Covid results or otherwise, I‚Äôm all ears. Otherwise, I‚Äôd suggest taking some classes on how to hold a civil discussion instead of utilizing ones profile description to get out of a conversation.
If you took just another minute to click that twitch link, you‚Äôd see videos clear as day with my face.   I‚Äôm not one of these bots you been dealing with, I have receipts. Do the math yourself if you need to verify my comments about just getting over Covid. Let‚Äôs stay on topic.
The COVID result, the fact that I got it from a kid playing organized sports, or both?
I just honestly want to know how Biden got the nomination lol. Like, I honestly want to know how democrats could look at their candidates, and go for him. Like sure, he was Obama‚Äôs VP, and everyone loved Obama, but that was 11 years ago. Times have changed
Go to Antifa website and it takes you right to Joe Biden‚Äôs campaign. So it shows Biden supports Antifa and BLM outside of being a Racies. I thought this was Anerica and his pick was going to be a Black Female. If Trump said that the media would go berserk.
So.... are you saying you‚Äôre not voting for Biden?
Biden did the most raciest thing he could possibly do. In this country we pick people based on experience not race. But Biden picked a VP based on Gender and  color. So he said he would pick a woman of color. So it just shows he is a bigger raciest then thought.
I just got over a stint with COVID. I can confirm children do have a high enough ‚Äúviral load‚Äù to infect others because that‚Äôs how we got it.
That‚Äôs all the Biden campaign could afford to pay!
well if you go to search bar and type  it takes you to Biden s website. Wow #RIGGEDELECTION
Looking forward to the day when the Biden administrations AG subpoenas you for the criminal investigation of Trump that you most likely participated in.
please call Biden-Hair Ass out on their lies. Biden speech today is despicable. Can‚Äôt let them win. Please remind people she is not Afro American
Katie people listening to Biden right now are screaming at their screens. Don‚Äôt let them get away with the lies they are spreading.
Im not a republican but my parents are. They live in Pennsylvania and theyre voting for Biden time. How he handled Covid is the reason why. They‚Äôre older so they‚Äôre higher risk and they dont feel like Trump is taking it seriously.
A perspective by the  (National Shooting Sports Foundation) on Kamala Harris and gun control.
Biden can‚Äôt do it. Body and mind won‚Äôt allow it.
Don‚Äôt fall for it!!! Don‚Äôt let him draw support from Biden. We must be unified to defeat Trump.
Biden and Harris will most likely win (as long as Biden remains out of the public eye). Harris will replace him pretty early on and run for re-election in 2024. We won't have a chance to address the real issues until 2028 but by then things will likely be too late.
Kamala is running along side KKK Supporting Joe Biden. What an inclusive ticket the Democrats have arranged.
How many of you really believe Biden had anything to do with selecting Kamala Harris? Yeah, me either...
It‚Äôs a different between MAGA people and those who like Biden/Harris. Don‚Äôt give me that both are mean line. Do you then, sit it out.

Jason Nichols  watching you on Fox and all I have to say is: "can you please get off the narrative that Trump is a racist" Look at the facts, he has done more for blacks than Biden or Harris has done and if he was such a racist why did he donate to her campaign?
No they wont be.  Theyre sick of being trapped in the house because of your mismanagement of Covid.  They want out of the house and that means voting for Biden.
Joe Biden didn't pick anyone, he was picking his nose when the Deep State chose Heels Up Harris
Honestly doesn't matter...Joe can debate or not...you can have Kamala or not...BIDEN WILL NOT EVER WIN!!!
Think I‚Äôm gonna skip this years presidential election, tired of choosing the lesser of two evils! I hate Kamala Harris and I hate Trump, Biden is just a dumbass in the way
IF YALL WANT TO VOTE FOR TRUMP THAT IS ALL YOU GOT TO SAY. Don‚Äôt hide under ‚Äúanti-Biden‚Äù.
You sound scared.... #placeholderjoe never planned on debate. Joe isn‚Äôt even campaigning.  He read from a script while taking to Kamala. We see Biden. He‚Äôs a big boy running for President- Time to step out in front of Americans and earn the vote. Dems planning #chaos
Dream on. It‚Äôs ok we know Biden doesn‚Äôt want to come out to play. #basementpresidentialdebates2020
They are going to have to be careful going after a black(?)female!  Stay on her record-Trump turn her attacks on him into him pointing out Biden‚Äôs many weaknesses-let Pence deal with Harris!  Just keep listing her record!
Anybody believe Biden had anything to do with the selection?
Post a couple Pro Biden Tweets, you should be fine.
Hold up, both of you. The "I would veto m4a" line is worthy of criticism because to VETO it means it already got THROUGH congress. That would be trashing a big win. Biden remains a better option than Trump. It's colossally stupid for him to threaten veto on prog legislation tho!
Yeah, because those  ratings are through the roof. Biden does online town halls and gets 19 viewers. Unless  gives a press conference detailing her rise to the top - Willie Brown - no one would watch.
Kamala Harris is the First Indian American to be selected to run for President after she gets rid of Mindless Joe Biden!!! And I thought they said they were going to nominate a Black Woman. Oh well, four more years...‚Ä¶...
‚ÄúHe (Biden) caves to the extreme left whenever he needs to. Harris is way to the left of what Biden used to be, of course at the moment they‚Äôre kind of in sync. Dick Morris
John Kasich  you think Joe Biden is a man of deep faith? If he were he would not believe and support abortion, removal of prayer from school and wanting to teach Islam and so many more liberal views that go against God.
You overshot your shot, I said I care, I‚Äôm just not hell bent over politics. I know all about BOTH Biden/Kamala, I‚Äôve interviewed them both just like Trump/Pence, though I interviewed VP. Neither has a strategy in place on bettering the US. All have 80+ days to have a plan. üëàüèæ
Remember, Biden (and the Clintons) LOVED ol KKK Robert Byrd...he was their ‚Äúmentor‚Äù...proof the old bigots never ‚Äúswitched and became Republican‚Äù....nope, they decided best way to stay in power was to use minorities by keeping them down with government dependence #NeverBiden
..man, these super deep conservatives/GOP voters are HOTüî• today, not at Biden, b/c he picked a black woman named Kamala Harris as his VP candidate. My blocking game also be HOTüî•as well w/trolls thinking they can throw rocks &amp; hide their hands. I‚Äôm not the one you want! üëèüèæüíØ
Rand is spot on!!! And it is funny (and sad) how the Establishment Obama/Clinton/Biden Democrats squashed Tulsi...Tulsi a military veteran who while I disagreed with on 90 percent of the issues at least was honest...even a bit Nationalist
5. Biden has shown he bows to pressure by picking Kamala. Biden claims to be a ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù but a moderate would never pick Harris. And Biden‚Äôs plan is to ‚Äúwin‚Äù and then resign and let Harris take over. #NeverBidenNeverHarris
It‚Äôs not only that. They just wasn‚Äôt expecting the one woman that they did not want to see be his running mate become his running mate because they are fearful of the power/backing (support system) Biden and Harris will have together w/the ppl, &amp; now, Trump supporters hella mad!
4. Also, Trump despite being called since day 1 ‚Äúa dictator‚Äù has shown what federalism is, he‚Äôs let governors mostly run their states during the crisis and assisted them where needed which is how it is supposed to be! Biden would lock everything down permanently and hide
Claudia....THEY BIG MAD today! What shook them...a BLACK woman they don‚Äôt like is Biden‚Äôs VP candidate and they are fearing this is the end for them! You hate to see it! üëèüèæ
It only makes sense a raciest Biden pick another raciest for his VP pick.  Just shows he stays true to his raciest values.
Anyone but Trump  (by anyone I mean Biden, shut up Kanye)
Just a reminder that voting for Biden and Harris isn‚Äôt just about the presidency. It‚Äôs also about getting better cabinet leaders. A neurosurgeon is head of HUD and the  current secretary of education doesn‚Äôt care about kids getting sick at school from COVID. We need better.
Intelligent people will research that video showing Joe Biden saying the N word and will learn that he was criticizing the words of a racist bigot.
Biden chose k harris thus assuring the re - election of Trump Pence.  Thanks for the Peace of mind. Sleepy joe.
Not only that, but Biden would be the 1st VP to win the White House as President since George H.W. Bush did in 1989.
Did Biden have any chances???

Now, Biden, put   over education please.  needs to go. Senator Warren would be the best for education....she will rebuild the education system.
...what‚Äôs your re-election plan? (that‚Äôs not attacking Biden/Harris)
Biden will not be the nominee. He will be gone.
Well that was quick!  Bypassed by Biden, Abrams likely to focus on 2022 rematch against Kemp
Kamala Harris also laughed about separating children from their parents in prison. Her and Joe Biden want to take away AR-15s away from the American people.  already exposed this woman on the debate stage. How do people celebrate her.
Congratulations!!!   I am so happy, words cannot express my feelings !! A Biden / Harris ticket is phenomenal!! The two of you are the dynamic duo of hope!!!! I can‚Äôt wait to go out and vote for the both of you!!
Really doesn't matter who Biden picked...

was biden my first pick? no. am i thrilled with him picking harris? no. will i vote for them because doing anything else will result in 4 more years of trump? yes i absolutely will bc i refuse to let my frustrations with the ticket get us 4 more years of corruption and hatred.

Is a Biden/Harris victory going to make it easier for the Left to win Democratic Primaries?   I'm just saying, if you are a Progressive Democrat, that should be a VERY HIGH PRIORITY.
Right now, the Left's major problem is that we don't get past PRIMARIES.  That doesn't get better with Biden and Harris dictating the ethic from the top of the party.

Kamala Harris can‚Äôt escape the wicked witch of the West phenomenology. She‚Äôs been type-cast for that role. Joe Biden can‚Äôt escape Barney Fife typecast. He‚Äôs played Barney all of his life. Barney was never meant to be sheriff. Joe was never meant to be president.
Biden looks like crap. He‚Äôs fading away. Everyday he loses more brain cells and his world of possibilities narrows into a basement and a record player.

Gives an argument about why you shouldn't elect anti-populist Dems. Empower folks like Neal-- and Biden/Harris will bring them in by the busloads-- you can't underestimate how many people will whack Left to get in their good graces.
And he won't have the House for the next 2 either... and not the next 4 if he starts doing to things you're talking about... Of course when Biden/Harris start doing those things, the #Resistance will cheer - and that's exactly why the oligarchs gave us these four years of Trump.
must be fired from Fox News for the VERY thinly veiled threat to Joe Biden's life.  #FireJeaninePirro

Yo what are you talking about? Biden has a whole plans for reform on his website y‚Äôall mofos just don‚Äôt read anything. Go ahead and vote for the man who destroyed this country, ignored a pandemic, and continues to uphold a legal system that targets African americans.....like wtf
Before we get too comfortable about Biden's lead, remember Trump's approval rating is about where Harry Truman's was at this point in his presidency--and we didn't elect a President Dewey
Honestly, four years of Trump and two open primaries in 2024 is better than 4-16 years of the Biden/Harris oligarchs controlling the Democratic Party and no open primary again until Buttigieg is near Biden‚Äôs age.

She knows if Biden wins, he wont finish a full term and she'll be stepping in.  #VoteTrump2020
No, the reason Harris got the job is she is qualified. She has the resume and relevant campaign experience. Plus, Biden trusts her bc she worked with his son. The headlines about her race and gender are bc that is what makes the pick historic. See the difference?

part of this was about trying to get Biden elected,or at least get mail in voting passed,they wanted to make sure COVID wouldn't go away pre-election,also just more of keeping segregation of races,more we're segregated,easier to control..why prisons are so segregated
Craniums have nothing to do with attention training. Check out FMRI studies with attention training. Get your mind off Biden‚Äôs racist comments. ‚ÄúBlack people with few exceptions lack diversity. ‚Äú Joe Biden.
Liberals: OK but once Biden wins everyone has to shut up and do Republican stuff or they‚Äôll make us lose again!!! We‚Äôre absolute fucking idiots who love to eat our own butts and no one else‚Äôs!
Harris is a fake, a fraud. She‚Äôs not authentic. Biden should have picked someone authentic.
Pelosi and Biden tried to undo Trump's travel ban that stopped 20k infected Wuhan citizens per day starting 1/31/2020. The Dem govs killed 80k nursing home patients. The economy recovery is V-shaped. Security is front and center. Trump is the only pathway to security.

Joe Biden humiliates Trump amid his attacks on Kamala Harris  via

In fact, (my mistake) there is data about Warren voters' second choice. It shows a similar number of her supporters would have gone to Sanders as would have gone to Biden.
Fwiw, we dont have data on who Warren voters would have chosen for their second choice. Many of them jumped ship to Biden when she quit because they didnt like Bernie. Evidence that all of Warren's supporters would have gone to Bernie is anecdotal and likely inaccurate.
If Trump‚Äôs immigration plan is -100, Obama/Biden‚Äôs was what a -70? And the best Democratic candidate on the Primary stage was maybe a +10? So is it better to have Biden for 4-8 years, or a wide open primary in both parties where immigration can be a central issue in 2024?

"You can push Biden and Harris to the Left!!"  Biden is dumb, and Harris is smug.   We may need to admit that it's simply easier to fight Trump than it is to "convince" company Dems.
Harris and Biden are trying to use Black Americans like personal slaves. Then they are going to strip them of security and enjoy the carnage. Horrific! Trump is the only path to security!

All this bs about Biden/Harris being so radical. You know what's radical? Fucking anonymous cops in the streets. Appointing fucking crooks and thieves to every possible govt job. Fucking firing inspectors general. Pardoning your fucking pals. That's fucking radical.
Biden is a lying Idiot. You are correct that he advised Obama not to take out Bin Laden. Just worthless, doesn‚Äôt he know it‚Äôs all on record?
I‚Äôm so dead that ppl think we are hating Biden Harris just to hate!! It‚Äôs not too much to ask to want a candidate who‚Äôs a genuinely good person who doesn‚Äôt have a history of creating or upholding racist policies to target the communities they swear to protect! I‚Äôll still vote tho

My dog's fucking voting for Biden
The power has been out in Joe Biden‚Äôs mind for a long time. Let‚Äôs draw him out of the basement and see how he does.
The fix for a rigged election is already in motion. I bet they are planning on Biden stepping aside as his fitness for office is questioned. With DNC chairman pushing that she is ready to govern on day 1, something is up. Today was awkward
If you think Democrats like Biden and Harris are socialists starting a class war, just wait another 4 or 8 years, and you'll have the real thing. A real progressive tax structure will provide for this country's future.
She is ready on day one because Biden is unfit and mentally impaired, and the party will ask him to step aside? #MAGA

Harris wants to step over Biden‚Äôs dead body to rule America with her iron BLM Bolshevik fist. She‚Äôll defund the police, take your guns, and let the peaceful Bolsheviks deliver historical justice. She won‚Äôt offer protection. She‚Äôll enjoy the carnage.
‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt black unless you vote for me,‚Äù Joe Biden said. ‚ÄúBlack Americans have no diversity.‚Äù
The confederate Dems have sided with the BLM Bolsheviks. They want to defund the police and burn America down, one community at a time. Trump is the Lincoln of our time. Biden looks like crap, Jeff Davis.
1/3  I wrote this bit on subjective freedom and late modernity, before Harris was picked as Biden's VP.
Harris is a witch that few would want to live under. Biden is in his last hour of life. Harris could become the next Xi or the next Hitler. It all depends how her Socialist party might devolve.
Out of all the great choices we had at the beginning of the primary race, I can‚Äôt believe we ended up with a Biden/Harris ticket. Casting my ballot is going to make my jaw hurt.
LIVE VIDEO: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris appear together in Delaware
I‚Äôm really going to be clenching my teeth when I fill in that bubble next to Biden and Harris.
Has anyone else found the pro-Loeffler ads targeting Collins to be a bit... WEIRD? Collins is about as conservative as you get and it seems the pro-Loeffler folks are targeting people who don't know that. I dunno. It's like the same as trying to get socialism to stick to Biden.
That‚Äôs a strong selling point for Biden
Trump was nominated by the GOP which bent over backwards to gift him the nomination despite his lack of anything close to majority support from the party voters. He‚Äôs done nothing but continue the substantive policies Obama-Biden gave us.
What does a single vote for Biden change? How do you expect us to ever abolish the 2-party system (that is not actually a thing, and exists entirely a result of our unwillingness to use our voices to challenge it) if we continue to support it with the little power we wield.
Trump exists so that we will run into the arms of fascists like Kamala Harris. Everything Trump has done is the logical extension of the policies that Biden helped implement as VP. If we allow ourselves to vote out of fear, we‚Äôve already lost.
I‚Äôm not a huge fan, and probably won‚Äôt be voting at all, but she‚Äôs a far better candidate than Biden, Harris, Trump, or Pence, and I don‚Äôt have to worry about her failings because she won‚Äôt be elected. I have no faith in the LP, but we need to build momentum for change.
She never backstabbed him either? She didn't owe anyone an endorsement. She saw the writing on the wall before y'all and decided she could do more good advising Biden than in helping a sinking Bernie campaign.
Y'all are bad at politics. Bernie didn't lose because of Warren, but because the centrist candidates came together around Biden. Either Warren was never going to win so she should have dropped out, or her endorsement was important enough to help Bernie win. You can't have both.
To be fair, the hill isn‚Äôt much steeper than the one they climbed four years ago. But we all misjudge reality - like thinking this is a contest without a predestined outcome, or that there‚Äôs a difference between the people who gave us Trump and Biden.
So you‚Äôre suggesting that my vote for Biden can change things, but my vote for  or my decision to stay home can‚Äôt? Because that‚Äôs some serious sophistry for someone throwing around ‚Äúself-serving rationalizations for doing nothing‚Äù at others.
It‚Äôs not nonsense, it‚Äôs the way the system works, man. You can argue that libertarians shouldn‚Äôt actively campaign against Biden/for Trump, and I‚Äôd agree, but you can‚Äôt act like you support liberty, and then use your tiny voice to cast in with the lot and support the status quo.
Or maybe you recognize that Biden served in one of the worst administrations in the history of the world re: immigration and foreign policy, and you realize your lone vote has no impact beyond its value as a signal to others, and you don‚Äôt want to signal support for imperialists.
I agree with you in general but I did the same thing in 2016 and voted for Hillary. Four years later and I'd rather vote my conscious. I still might vote Biden but as of now I plan to write in Bernie. I really doubt Biden wins Georgia anyways, although it may be more competitive.
i know this isn‚Äôt the first time i‚Äôve said it, but i‚Äôd KILL for Biden to be the super scary radical leftist that Fox keeps trying to scare its viewers into believing he is. the dude said he‚Äôd veto Medicare for All. on god what the fuck do you think a leftist is
gotta say. it‚Äôll never not be amusing how hard Fox and Trump and all them keep trying to push that Biden is ‚Äúembracing the radical left‚Äù and that picking Kamala means he‚Äôs ‚Äúdropping the label of moderate‚Äù. bruh. he‚Äôs a centrist whose VP nom is a cop. fuck you mean?
I don‚Äôt think biden can convince anyone who‚Äôs red that he‚Äôs not a socialist through soundbites and messaging. He‚Äôs just gotta hope to drive up turnout and I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs particularly good at that comparatively
I‚Äôm tired of the Trump bashing... is he the most experienced, qualified or educated president we‚Äôve ever had? Not even close. Is he a better option over Joe Biden.... yes. This is a pb&amp;j vs steak and mays conversation.
Y‚Äôall screaming ‚Äúvote blue no matter who‚Äù and saying that there are no better options than Biden and Harris are so pathetic to me. You would sacrifice your agency, ideals, and honor to a pack of old politicians because you can‚Äôt think of anything better? Disgusting
Good luck with second term trump! I'm sure that will be much better for you than Biden and the lady that voted with Bernie 95% of the time.
What I want to know is how many 2016 Trump voters or 2016 abstainers are voting Biden this time?  Otherwise you‚Äôre not a data point that gives any indication of how 2020 will be different from 2016.

You really think Biden will even make it to inauguration?
Important difference: that was Clinton‚Äôs chance on Election Day, while it‚Äôs Biden‚Äôs chance today. If the election were held today, Biden would have a 93% chance
I‚Äôll translate Bill speak:  Biden is senile and can‚Äôt complete a sentence.  Trump will trounce him.  Let‚Äôs not have that happen
As for nothing tying Trump to Russia, don‚Äôt be ridiculous. He‚Äôs literally had business dealings and private meetings and private phone lines set up with them. There‚Äôs as many ties there as Biden has to China, so at BEST it‚Äôs a wash üôÉ
Hahaha what are you even talking about?   Are you saying private meetings shouldn‚Äôt exist by government leadership? Or it‚Äôs okay if there‚Äôs no wrongdoing found? If the former, Trump is in the wrong. If the latter, then you can‚Äôt blame Biden as no wrongdoing has been found.
A vote for Biden and Harris is a vote for damning yourself to Pete Buttigieg on television for the rest of your life.
I have never been less enthused about the options on offer. But I of course will be voting Biden/Harris regardless, because that shit matters for people's actual lives.   And we cannot survive another four years of 45.

Clinton had a 71% chance on Election Day. Biden has a 71% chance 3 months out. If the election were today, the model would give Biden a 93% chance

So-called ‚Äúpartial birth abortions‚Äù have not been legal since 2003, and Biden has never been a cheerleader for them.   Keep trying,
Interesting choice on Biden‚Äôs part. Seems as though he didn‚Äôt consider this well. As much as I like Harris, this pick will not get him the votes he is looking for. Moderates don‚Äôt like her for Green New Deal &amp; Bernie‚Äôs Boys don‚Äôt because Biden is too centrist.
Kamala Harris Brings Extreme Gun Control Position to Biden Ticket  via
Ah‚ÄîJust was reminded: Biden never SAID he doesn‚Äôt hold grudges with respect to Harris. That quote came from notes he had at a press conference in anticipation of a question never asked. The notes were captured on camera...
It will happen like this. October 10th, Biden will wake up not knowing where he is. He‚Äôll stumble and fall. They‚Äôll rush him to the hospital under Code Stroke protocol. His neurologist will diagnose as severe dementia. We‚Äôll never hear from Biden again.
Behold: As the King of Madness &amp; Queen of Duplicity insouciance subdues and atrophies minds of the feeble. A splendid show of contrition without any requisite of remorse. So let‚Äôs rejoice in this anachronistic matrimony and welcome Biden‚Äôs new Cajoling Consortium of Thaumaturges.

I need someone to tell me why it's going to be easier to organize under Biden/Harris, rather than Trump/Pence.
This makes no sense at all.  Obama chose a very unthreatening Joe Biden as VP.  Haig had already shown us that Sec of State is not ‚Äúin charge.‚Äù   SOS is a great job but not the #2 job.
Biden looks like crap and sounds like crap. There is no makeup that will cover his Dementia. Joe will never pass the Montreal Cognitive Test. He‚Äôs got to take the test. Remembering 5 things will be impossible. Go Trump! The best empirical mind of our time.
Biden looks like crap. He‚Äôs living his last hour.
They‚Äôll do the opposite. Biden is on record saying the 94 crime bill didn‚Äôt go far enough to lock people up and saying busting out of district kids would ‚Äúturn our schools into a racial jungle‚Äù Pair that with her record in Oakland incarcerating black people. That‚Äôs what they push
To be clear I do not like Biden or Kamala and this ticket IS trash but expecting Bernie to come out and bash it, risking dividing the left and further jeopardizing the chances of voting Trump out, is moronic
Really? Who was the Catholic during the Obama-Biden years?
Lol I‚Äôm sorry what did y‚Äôall want the man to tweet? "Biden sucks ACAB" like??? He‚Äôs a politician who votes left why would he sabotage the left‚Äôs only chance at getting trump out by tweeting anything other than support????
Because it's Biden.
In the last four days, I've seen more "elections don't matter"-style posts on my social media feed than I have in the last 8 years.  They all come from people trying to get folks to vote for Biden.

Okay so if you‚Äôre a liberal going by your weird screech logic this means you can‚Äôt vote for Biden
That right there reminds us even more why we don't need to vote for Biden-Harris. Looking forward to watching brainless, clueless celebrities melt down with the other snowflakes after their pedophile presidental favorite and useless vice presidential favorite lose. #Trump2020.
I am a little bit curious about what the "defund the police" black feminists are going to do with the "Yaaassss Queen" black feminists over a Biden/Harris ticket.
Trump will only spew lies about Biden/Harris. Ignore it and focus on fighting voter suppression in your city/county/state. That is the real threat we're up against.
Rice will become the greatest political criminal in American history. By not choosing Rice, Biden gave the greenlight to scapegoat Rice for Obamagate. The question. Is Rice smart enough to save herself?  Durham‚Äôs door is open.
I agree with Mimi! Happy and with emotions that I had not quite anticipated! Biden/Harris
A Biden/Harris ticket gives us 4 more years of Trump I‚Äôm afraid. The Democrats can‚Äôt pretend to be for progressive policies with these two. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre trying to appeal to moderate Republicans who don‚Äôt like Trump. Being anti-Trump isn‚Äôt enough. It wasn‚Äôt in 2016.
I don‚Äôt like anything about our current political system. I hate the Biden is a rapist. I hate that Harris was a prosecutor. But unless you have another way to start digging us out of the mire, then I don‚Äôt really want to hear it.
Stacey Abrams says she‚Äôs really Joe Biden‚Äôs pick for VP.
I‚Äôm pissed too, but y‚Äôall niggas still better vote Biden/Harris.

Joe Biden didn‚Äôt pick shit. The dnc appointed their real candidate.
And if we being real.... Biden is older so... please tell me you know where I‚Äôm going with this so I don‚Äôt have to say it
If that‚Äôs the alternative, I‚Äôll take it over what Biden/Harris will bring for the next 12-16 years, possibly the next 2 with full control of Congress. (I‚Äôm not suggesting anyone vote for ‚Äúthe alternative‚Äù when there are actually multiple alternatives both on and off the ballot.)
Joe Biden really picked the worst VP there is lol get ready for 4 more years of trump

What is the alternative to voting Biden/Harris without being complicit in policies I disagree with?   I recognize this tweet isn‚Äôt speaking to me, but I like to think I consider other people/demographics and their livelihoods before I vote.
Yes. Vote Biden/Harris. We've learned that neoliberalism is better than fascism.
It matters to Black Americans who lack diversity according to Biden. It matters to the Monolith.
K-Harris has a problem. No one likes her. Biden has a problem. Harris knows he‚Äôs a demented old white guy who‚Äôs a racist at heart. Harris is no Obama. She‚Äôs the wicked witch of the West.
We need the Dems to have to negotiate with the left side of the party, rather than with the GOP. We need more AOCs. Leverage. Shift the negotiation table. Run left candidates in safe blue districts. If you don't like Biden/Harris, then pick a senate race to sponsor.
Perfect pick to neutralize the claim that Biden wants to defund the police. Since, ya know, Kamala is a cop. üôÑ
Cannot think of a worse female running mate Biden could‚Äôve chosen

Two-faced Harris agrees to wet nurse Biden‚Äôs second infancy. But she will not give up her Senate seat. Sounds like she knows what‚Äôs coming.

Good choice   will be an awesome running mate!
With #KamalaHarris now #Biden‚Äôs VP, lets hope she will honor her campaign commitment to #MedicareForAll and push Biden to give all Americans equal access to health care.  With millions losing jobs and what health insurance they had, Medicare For All is more crucial than ever.

Rice loses her bid for VP. She is out. Biden and Obama know what they did. Rice does too. Rice needs to watch her back.

EVERYBODY supports some form of Universal healthcare. Ya'll aren't special because you call it M4A, which is basically a bernie bro talking point to distance from Obamacare which is what the majority of the party is expecting to be recovered under Biden.
Wow, Trump's brother dies of Covid 19 and all Trump can say is Biden will be a better president than him. Crazzzy day in the white house.
Let's get Biden elected then get him impeached and have the first woman of color become president
Ok? Biden can‚Äôt even string together two coherent thoughts. Worked with ABI patients for 5 years. Biden is 100a% suffering from a cognitive deterioration. Oh and he inappropriately touches kids on camera over and over again. You‚Äôre gonna vote for that? ü§®

Joe Biden, with all of his faults, would've stayed by his brothers side on his death bed rather than golf. Jog on mate!
At least Rudy was for law and order. You will be mad at the republicans for not forcing down your throat that communism will never work in the US if Biden, I mean Kamala is elected president.
Also they disapprove of police being militarized and lengthy prison sentences for blacks w/ minor offenses. These two things were headed by Biden  w/the crime bill. Biden can call it a "racial jungle" then 20 yrs later run for oval! That  letter "D" is a golden tix for anything
Furthermore bernie was begging for my vote and I cast it for biden just like many I know, kiss my ass
Biden was my next to last choice in the primary. I believe that, due to our electoral college system, only a binary choice is possible. Future elections and a needed national mask mandate can only happen if Trump is defeated. Voting for Biden is my last hope and yours too.
y‚Äôall know if you don‚Äôt vote for Biden we‚Äôre going to turn into an actual fascist nation. tr*mp cannot be trusted!!!!!!!!!!!!! i recognize my privilege in being able to say that. but like......................... this deadass is life or death

That's a fucking lie and u know it, it was obviously always gonna be between biden and Sanders,  after south Carolina,  black voters especially older voter chose biden over Sanders,  the other's dropped out so sanders the independent didn't win and I was glad
#BidenHarris2020   Biden votes to lock up black people
What you mean, i voted for biden over Sanders,  but if Sanders got the nomination then I'd vote for him, but di you, enjoy republican presidents and a conservative Supreme Court for the foreseeable future,  its on you
i think it has to be felix biederman to write it because he is the only one who has the definitive understanding of who biden is and the place he occupies in american history
been doing more thinking on this article and my thoughts on biden have evolved to the point where i believe that he is one of the most compelling and tragic figures in american history. he has to win this election so somebody can write the robert caro style biography of him

3. Then in 16, again the Super Delegates swayed to Hillary over Bernie...now in 20, they knew Bernie would once again lock it up, so they once again did the establiahment‚Äôs bidding and got Pocahontas to split the Bernie vote to destroy him and get Biden the senile in
They‚Äôre still doing this bit!  Anyway Jill Biden never got canned from the AV Club for publishing a fawning review for something that hadn‚Äôt been released yet so I think we can give her this one
2. (Contd) to nominate their candidate. Bernie would‚Äôve gotten the nomination again, but the old guard called up everybody to get behind Biden. There is nothing ‚ÄúDemocratic‚Äù about the ‚ÄúDemocratic Party‚Äù. Think about it..in 08 the Super Delegates swayed to Obama from Hillary....
Thread: Even  ‚Äòs Chris Wallace, a Democrat, is getting mad that Biden refuses to go on the hot seat as Trump always does. There is no more hiding him, Biden is a senile old man that has zero business running for President. Once again, the Dems rigged their process
I just watched your interview with Steven Moore, Horrible. Allow people to answer. Cutting them off, makes you look like a bully. I agree with your points but you annoyed me by not letting him respond. Go Biden!
Trump very well knows that by mail-in-voting will favor democrats more, he is trying every trick to stop that by stopping the funding to USPS, removing the postal blue boxes at counties...still one cannot stop Biden-Harris winning in Nov 2020.
Biden is already backing off the public option plan before the election has even happened.   I swear if I see one more liberal tell me Biden believes healthcare is a human right I‚Äôm going to write in Ralph Nader in Nov.
How many questions did Biden answer today?
And if that isn't enuf here is the real reason why they're losing money! One more thing to add to the changes we can implement if Biden/Harris wins in November. Think about all of this as you vote in November ...

With Biden as President?  Haha.  The only way sane or normal will happen is if both current parties are dismantled.  Term limits, and clean House and Senate.  But it will never happen.
Haha makes me laugh. Since when Biden started caring about blacks.? #JoeBiden #kamalaHarrisisafraud

Joe Biden has my vote and respect. Kamala Harris has my respect and approval. The pair are phenomenal!!
Biden had his son put on the board of a Ukrainian energy company being paid 500K a year, that's profiteering. His history demonstrates extreme racism. And both are against reparations. They need to start appealing to black ppl and the left
I'm on it. Biden it is.
Harris and Biden's legacies with black people show that both despise us quite a bit
Joe Biden said when it was known that he would be the Democratic candidate for president, that he would select a woman of color to be his VP. He in fact chose Kamala Harris because of her race and gender. I guess it wasn‚Äôt the content of her character, but the color of her skin.
"She is on a Joe Biden ticket and not a Bernie Sanders ticket."
It's just Biden campaign ad fodder day after day after day
It‚Äôs so gross. Bernie sees the good in everyone, to the point where him not going harder at Biden cost him the nomination and his backing Kamala has made a lot of the left understandably critical of him. Centrist and libs need to leave him alone. No one messes with pawpaw but us
i‚Äôm not saying i support trump, or biden... or kanye. everyone is fucking trash.
Biden literally does this every week already.
That depends on who is controlling the military. If Biden(kamala) is controlling the military,  he she  will definitely use them against US citizens who rebel against them. America will be over and controlled by Anarchy and BLM.
Sure, it could be, I don't say who will win, I just want to clarify to our allies and friends that we will be with them if Biden wins. :D

Neither Obama or Biden would let this country's economy crumble, and let the unemployment rate be the worst it's been since the great depression.

Was hoping some serious arrest would go down before the election like James Comey or something like that. Probably not likely. There is so much public knowledge about Biden's perverse behavior I don't know what could entail. I do believe this will be the most fraudulent election

I think Trump has been cognitively consistent for 4 years. You might say ok, consistently stupid, but still consistent. Biden today compared to Biden 4 years ago seems like there has been somewhat of a decline, he has more trouble finding words, and there is just something else.
Don't care what you want to see. You aren't nothing to Trump supporters.  Trump 2020.  Dems are racist to Black Americans. We don't think the same Joe Biden
He just endorsed Biden/Harris.
Biden Hillary Obama traitors to America
But others will vote for Biden out of pragmatism.  It is easier to push Democrats left than it is to resist a move to the right under Republicans, due to Democrats having no fundamental principles whatsoever.  Well-liked third party candidates on both sides throw it into chaos.
Biden, Pelosi, and Schumer will you work for free for the American people. Truly fulfill your promise to serve the people! You‚Äôre multi-millionaire...I‚Äôll wait for your answers

Good thing no pundits based their vote on whom Biden picked for VP! How dense would that have been?ü§°
Wow. Just as bad from the far left.  They were ok with Biden and now they're unleashing their fury on both Harris AND Biden.   Something seems manufactured about this. I've seen the shitty memes.
Fight in brothers. It‚Äôs just a warm up if Biden wins which would be a cold day in hell. But if the libs find a way to cheat there will be civil war in this country like you never seen. Then tell me who is going to get the best down not the right.
I see a lot more people hyping themselves up that Trump is going to try and steal the election then talking about Biden having a chance.
ü§îüëâüèøGotta hope Biden has a spot saved for Beto in his administration. It's the only excuse I can think for leaving him off this list.
No the left are the raciest ones. Biden I will only pick a African American woman. That‚Äôs discrimination and Harris is descendent of slave owners all facts. So you tell me who the raciest are and hypocrites.
so y‚Äôall just going to sit here and pretend like what he said was informative or helpful in any type of way he actually made fun of black people right in their faces damn the audacity Biden
Yang, Gabbard, and Buttigieg were the only candidates I had enough respect for to maybe give them a chance against Trump. Right now a vote for Trump is a vote against Biden just like a vote for Biden is a vote against Trump.
NPR ran a story about the Biden team supposedly leaning toward not even trying to prosecute him or his admin if they win and honest to god the mind reels. God knows I moan about this party but if they explicitly ran on nailing these ppl to the wall I‚Äôd canvas in a hazmat suit
Kinda like ‚Äúlock her up‚Äù, but Clinton has never been charged with a crime.  Yet, many around the Trump campaign have been convicted. Like Trump just said Obama and Biden committed treason, by ‚Äúspying‚Äù on his campaign. No one will be charged. You know why? Because Trump is a liar.
Blame the Democrats for giving Yang like 10 seconds of time in the debates and Gabbard even less. Exaggerating, but the reality is that while I plan to vote Trump, I donated to both their campaigns bc they were not far left and also Biden is losing his marbles man.
Biden is a white supremacist sir  Blacks live in a complete system of white supremacy in America no matter which political party is in office  are we done?

Still can‚Äôt believe y‚Äôall got on here with the nerve to slander Kamala like she won‚Äôt do more good for us than Biden probably will lol
It did change things slightly. And idc what Joe Biden says, we aren‚Äôt going back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù bc too many of us have been radicalized during this and won‚Äôt just let the status quo be enough. My bad, that went on longer than I expected.
pretty sure more people rightly blame biden and bill clinton for the crime bill than they do hillary  but who knows there's probably a lot of loons who do it to hillary too
Wrong... Biden the senile rapist chose her because she is would easily integrate into his campaign; he could have chosen Warren and that would‚Äôve been a fine choice! But, no Warren is wilful do gooder, something that wouldn‚Äôt have quite settled with Senile Joe...
I wouldn‚Äôt answer that call.  It‚Äôs a robocall at best.  Though Biden‚Äôs administration may be calling and inviting the entire Chump Klan to answer for their litany of crimes.

Obama knew of Biden‚Äôs worthlessness for 8 years. Exactly why he orchestrated Biden‚Äôs nomination. Needed to have a firm grasp on the puppet‚Äôs strings.

Those excited by Biden/Harris are not the target audience.  It‚Äôs for those in the progressive/leftist movement who hate them for their complicity in racism/capitalism/sexism/imperialism, but willing to support them against Trump/Pence who are worse.
Because the media made the entire election about beating Donald Trump instead of substantive policy issues. They portrayed Biden as the safe candidate and Bernie as the risky candidate. That was the number one issue for voters.
Dude... I‚Äôm disappointed how hard it is for you to argue about the question I asked without the whataboutism with Biden. This has nothing to do with him.

Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate  I figure she's lied her whole life.  This is nothing new for her.  She is a great liar.  To bad the facts are in print.
It‚Äôs not like Biden got lucky here ‚Ä¶ he said it because the writing was already on the wall.  needs a reckoning on how they weigh the totality of evidence
"Take a look at my record man!" -Biden üëáüëáüëá
There was one Biden boat...
Childish stunt that will backfire....like everything else. Joe Biden could care less. #BidenHarris2020
Trump is only 3 years younger than Biden. He claimed it was difficult to pass a basic cognitive test, and examples of his constant mispronunciations, terrible memory, rambling, and ignorance are widely available on YT.  He fails your own standards.
Now do that "insert something fabricated by Fox News that has nothing to do with the topic" Joe Biden did.
Biden will get far better ratings.
Sanders would have been a candidate who'd boldly say, "Trump is dangerous, but we need to address systemic issues that exist beyond Trump." But instead we have a Biden candidacy that says, "Ignore systemic issues (that we plan to profit from), Trump is all that matters."
And frankly I'm sick and tired of reading stupid opinions. So I don't care how much you think Trump is Hitler, the fact is Joe Biden is worse and there are 4 candidates who can win. If you cant figure out who to vote for, just don't fucking vote.

Thinking that the left will pressure or even hold the Biden administration accountable is very laughable. Look at how the Democrats behaved during the primary, and you still think we'll hold them accountable? Never going to happen.
Do you think anyone who's watching the Convention hasn't already decided for Biden? Why this political theater for no effect? I just don't see it being worthwhile
I don‚Äôt like Biden, and I‚Äôm not voting for him. You‚Äôre both racist and anti-black.
#ImpeachTrumpAgain .  He‚Äôll be prosecuted by Biden‚Äôs AG, Klobachur or Schiff.
Besides choosing Hillary Clinton, I think Kamala Harris was the most polarizing choice Biden could have made.  If Trump drops Pence, grabs Nikki Haley for VP then pushes a few policies further left - this thing goes into Vegas ‚Äúpick-em‚Äù mode.   Anything can happen.   #NikkiHaley

Fighting Joe Biden will be like fighting against the wall. No budging no matter how much you want. Look at the primary. They will not budge.

How did 2018 turn out. Biden isn‚Äôt Hillary. He‚Äôs more likable.
it felt like early on in the primaries that progressive policies were being touted by candidates but they all backtracked, now we're here with joe biden and kamala lmao.
I'm not pro Biden or pro Trumo on pro black. A negro believes showing support to politicians who are openly hostile will earn favor in truth they are merely still slaves to white america and still will never be accepted.
"The political rot and depravity will continue to eat away at the soul of the nation, spawning what anthropologists call crisis cults ‚Äî movements led by demagogues that prey on an unbearable psychological and financial distress"  Biden won't solve anything
I have a plan. Trump supporters go in person and Biden supporters mail in ballots. And go...

Harris 'electrifies' West Indian voters giving Biden an edge in Florida: Kamala Harris is an incredible political force that will energize communities of color across the nation &amp; power Joe Biden into the White House &amp; trump into the trash heap of history
Of course you would vote for the administration that has helped us advance further.  Also, Biden is blamed to much for the crime bill. I remember A LOT of black leaders: essie Jackson, Deloris Tucker, Rev. Butts &amp;  many others wanted something done to stop the violence.

Jennifer this piece is perfection. Joe Biden is the epitome of the ‚Äúconnect‚Äù, and as fellow connector, this is why I have always loved him and wanted him to be the nominee from the start. He‚Äôs real. He‚Äôs decent. He‚Äôs empathetic. The opposite of Trump.
And the FDA is entirely made up of leftist commies trying to elect brain dead biden.   They are biased to the point of recommending the killing millions of covid patients. The FDA is immoral and incompetent.
In late June, Joe Biden claimed President Donald Trump¬†‚Äúwants to cut off money for the post office so they cannot deliver mail-in ballots.‚Äù At the time, we¬†wrote¬†that‚Ä¶[he] had no evidence‚Ä¶‚Äîbut now he does.
I several states and Biden infected so many people with corona virus by making them vote in person instead of postponing or voting by mail  He killed a lot of people and no one is holding him accountable for those specific death of elderly poll workers
A vote for anyone other than Trump or Biden is a vote against Trump and Biden. Trump and Biden will only collect the votes they earn. And if Biden gets less, it‚Äôs because he hasn‚Äôt earned them ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Specially since even with his light appearances Biden is still averaging like 1 unforced gaffe a week.
maybe, idk i don‚Äôt habe much faith in an outright support of a GND by kamala post election frankly, and i see biden as just bill clinton 2.  democrats are tired of the constant political news and just want a guy who isn‚Äôt republican to make the news stop being so scary.
Over the next week, Georgia Democrats will pressure Biden to live up to running mate Kamala Harris‚Äô challenge to deliver ‚Äúmore than a victory‚Äù in November by competing in a state that Republicans have carried in every White House vote since 1996. #gapol
and not to mention more progressive policies essentially were told to fuck off by nominating biden so that‚Äôs pretty depressing  cant wait to hear the same phrase ‚Äúwe can do progressive policies next election we need to defeat the GOP right now!‚Äù in 2024 again
Because self-respect and preserving your dignity are more difficult than settling for less. Especially as a group. If we (Biden supporters) come out of this mess with a victory, there‚Äôs going to be a lot of Republican finger-pointing.
Oh that's right he's playing shadow elect for Biden.
There will be 50 seperate elections on election night. Biden may lead big nationally, but it‚Äôs not that big in each individual state.
trump is actively destroying the postal service to suppress voting, something he had claimed openly which nothing will happen about and frankly the damage to the postsl service will probably remain after biden is president because all his voters will have checked out of politics
ive honestly been clocking out of the election a bit frankly  it‚Äôs just depressing seeing every democrat poster worshipping biden  this sucks so much
Biden talking about his policy for the Erdogan Kurdish situation.   Imagine hearing the first clear US foreign policy discussion in 4 years and calling it 'iNcOhErENt'. State of these comments.
When the first ad on a YouTube video is anti-Biden
I sense a little jealousy that you didn‚Äôt get invited to ride on a boat. Some people work hard and save up enough money own buy one. What do Biden supporters do for fun?
can you PLEASE remix the VPs statement that ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got some red meat for you. we‚Äôre not gonna let Biden and Harris cut our meat‚Äù it will be hilarious
Lol, you remember that time Biden worked in the White House for 8 years, right???
the likelihood of kamala using secret police to kidnap people off the streets, whether she‚Äôs a super cop or not, is low. There are things happening under Trump that just plain will not happen with Biden. It makes 0 sense to not vote for him and still call yourself progressive.
Biden only does what his handlers tell him too. I would do a laugh emogie....bit it's too sad. The guy is in old age and is being used. Sad he does not have the balls to be his own man. Guess he deserves it for being a puss all his life. Gosh....idk where i stand on this really.
People are saying that the election could tighten. What if it doesn't? What if Biden's lead continues to widen?
If one #FoxNews poll shows that more people are voting for #Biden but another poll says more people think their neighbors are voting for #Trump then all that tells us is that more Biden supporters hate their neighbors. Think about it.
Oh look, these are the police that Joe Biden wants to give more money to as incentive to not beat citizens over the head and do there job. Clearly more funding is what is needed here...gtfoh. #DefundThePolice

He brought it on himself. Republicans insist on talking about Biden‚Äôs supposed mental unfitness despite the *plentiful* ammunition that exists against Trump. It is the weirdest path of attack, which I can only assume originated from Trump‚Äôs tendency to project his weaknesses.
Someone please make a #meme of a Biden Boat Parade with one row boat (no oars), and maybe a canoe or two.
Just wait until a liberal judge orders states to count these votes to help Biden.
Pretty sure Kamala and Biden welcome the birther attacks as a useful distraction from talking about their records.
One GA organization got 50,000 more Black MEN to participate in the primaries for Biden.  I told you, Republicans: There‚Äôs an ENTIRE VOTING BLOC ready to hear your pitch.  But trust ... they will make their demands. They want TANGIBLES, not some Congressional Committee meeting!
Well, I'm not sure how else to interpret "we're blamed for not voting". There's nothing in that statement that says you're not going to continue that action. Anyway, I hope you'll vote against actual fascism this November by holding your nose and choosing Biden.
From January 2020 promoted by Erdogan‚Äôs lovers angery at Biden. Not sure whom Erdogan prefers. Trump or Biden. His ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù with Putin is pragmatic after being abandoned by Obama. He prefers NATO support over Putin, or Trump chaos but he may not get NATO support with Biden

like the only option is to use biden to stall for time basically and it would derail a lot of the fascist momentum tr*mp managed to get
So think of it this way. Biden Harris win. And gop wins house. Kevin McCarthy is now speaker. Biden ‚Äúdies‚Äù and Harris becomes president. Kevin does not become Vice President. Harris gets to choose her VP. Which is a highly unlikely scenario.

I went thru this dudes tweets since the beginning of Aug and he barely had a negative thing to say about Trump and there plenty to go after him on for the last two weeks. He made sure to attack Biden/Harris. That Howie dude does the same thing. Attack democrats is their mission.
You're being played dude. Every one of Joe Biden's supporters are being played. Trump was talking about very fine people on both sides of the statue debate. He condemned white nationalists and neo-nazis.
And yet if Trump wins, every democrat is going to say they are sure it is due to fraud, there could be no other way. And so, of course, it will be important to remove him by force, and install Biden no matter what.

I wish someone who knows everything to make list what President did I last 5 months and what Biden did for country. Trump: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12......##
Biden an anti Israel Presidential candidate, has Hutzpah.On Trumps historic Middle East peace agreement, claiming as VP he laid the ground work. What Biden, Obama did was sell out Israel at the UN! Obstaining on a vote condemning Israel!  Allowing Israel to be called  criminals.
Has there been a time in history, when Presidential, And Vice Presidential candidates, can have a press conference, say anything, with impunity? Biden, Harris are the answer. Make accusations, and leave without taking any questions.
Biden blames Trump for all of the lost lives due to COVID.  So by his rationale, if he had been President and didn‚Äôt close the borders (as he ridiculed Trump for doing) he would have been responsible for 1-2 Million American lives lost!
Has Joe Biden, or Donald Trump for that matter, taken a stance that I‚Äôm not aware of on transitioning children?
Vote for Biden because he is decent, qualified, experienced and can restore NORMALCY to this country... you don‚Äôt have to like or love someone to hire them to do a job for you.  Americans need to GROW UP!
History has been made! Congratulations Kamala Harris on becoming the VP nominee. You represent every woman of color. I know you will do us proud!!!  #pwreign #politics #BlackWomen #BlackWomenLeadVP #BlackGirlMagic
Biden asking to ware mask but nothing about Distancing. Because he wants to make sure the Rioters and looters face cover but still can burn and steal.
Biden wants mask for 3 month. We were right he wants to keep this virus live with mask no matter what so he can stay in basement not answering any questions. #Basement President
I will gripe about Biden  I might even say stuff about Kamala  (Probably not since she is the first smart move Democrats have made this entire election cycle)  But I‚Äôm certainly not voting for more fascism racism and mass death  So vote like lives are on the line because they are
We will see. your known quantity (Biden) doesn‚Äôt know where or who he is. #BLEXIT
There are many more senerios she missed. 1- dems push mail in voting and results are tainted. Leading to dem protest then confrontation with Trump supporters, and basically civil war. 2- Biden wins Trump leaves but half don't accept results and civil war.  Either way, violence.
Exactly. Not even Biden/Harris can tell you how. And they won‚Äôt. They‚Äôre betting on fear mongering for their votes. Not actual solutions. #BLEXIT2020 #BLEXIT
By selecting #KamalaHarris Joe Biden is assured of the Black votes, women's votes, perhaps East Indian votes (after having derided the E. Indian accent of owners of 7-Eleven &amp; gas station managers), may also get the votes of Arab people who have a similar sounding name as Kamal.
Biden appears like he's looking forward to the pudding cup they promised him for showing up.
Still wondering how a person who calls Biden a segregationist,now says he‚Äôs the person to heal the nation.Also wonder how a person who couldn‚Äôt make it to the Dems IA Caucus,now thinks she should be a step away from the Presidency.Wake up America,Or we‚Äôll be Venezuela
Biden and Harris at their first joint fundraising event spoke without telling a lie.  How is that for a change!   O'Donnel -The last word.
Can you translate what Biden was saying? Your candidate loves to fondle children and is a child molester.
Biden who?
And Biden still leading. WTF
I don‚Äôt pick Biden ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Hey  &amp;  so, how will Joe Biden actually enforce the mask mandate &amp; jail people?  They are defunding the police, right?  Great way to continue to spread #Covid_19 : put together in a small space a bunch of people who didn't wear a mask. #halfbaked
All of us #NastyWomenVote and we'll vote for Biden/Harris!
Brett I hope if And when you interview Biden , you treat, and ask him the same very tough questions you asked of Jared Kudhner!
. You have this election in the bag. You‚Äôre only thing that stands between us and four more years of total incompetence. Hopefully this call for a three month mask mandate while OUTDOORS is not a sign of even dumber ideas to follow.
I am SO PROUD of you both, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. I was in tears when I looked at the two of you dancing with the young people. And yes, the two of you will bring REAL LEADERSHIP back to America. It is what American people have been craving! THANK YOU! ONE LOVE! Aliciadine
So, Joe Biden wants to FORCE everybody to wear a mask? He sounds like a authoritarian to me...
Let's hope this age group does not vote for Biden. If they are stupid they may, but let us hope not. Just saying.  La Mega 96.5

I'm pro-Bernie but am voting for Biden. The issue that progressives have is that Harris may be treated as the inevitable nominee if she runs for Pres after being incumbent VP with the "how dare anyone primary her" mentality even if she is technically not the incumbent. Same as 16
I saw Joe Biden on a couple of episodes of Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego on YouTube.  Your friend Barbara Bush was on another episode of that show.
You can‚Äôt have it both ways. Do Biden/Harris want to abolish the police or do they want to ‚Äúmass incarcerate America‚Äù? This is such terrible messaging it‚Äôs laughable
You have Biden winning?
This whole rumour of Biden‚Äôs dementia and demise is something I only see on Fox News, and even there it is just opinion people saying they have heard this from unnamed sources. To me it smells like Fox trying to start a rumour to aid Trump in the election.
I agree. There are so many more, and clearer, reasons to object to her and the Biden/Harris ticket.
Sounds like Biden also disrespected his socialist VP as per WP
Why is it totally OK if Biden (HER RUNNING MATE) mangles her name but you find it offensive if a conservative host, without malice, mispronounces it?  You clowns in the biased media are the disrespectful.

The fact that you see Biden/Harris as worse than Trump/Pence is instructive. For many of us, Trump‚Äôs moral, temperamental, ethical and mental unfitness for office represents an unacceptable risk to the republic and outweighs any other consideration.
Fact check... Clinton (and Biden) were the DIRECT catalyst for Mass Incarcerations.
What I'm confused a out is why these idiots seem to think Joe Biden will not be able to complete his term??? I'm mean if the lard ass, fast food never does a day of exercise ,can't walk down a ramp unassisted, or hold a glass of freakin water can manage! Biden will be FINE

Hillary called trump supporters deplorable. Biden said if you have a hard time deciding between me or trump then you ain‚Äôt black. Idk about the Harris quote haven‚Äôt heard it before.
How on earth did you come to such a ridiculous conclusion?Are you unaware of what is happening in America right now?She‚Äôs actually a great pick for Biden &amp; will help him win.3/4 of America hate trump &amp; even his own party is pulling away from him, albeit quietly. Educate yourself!
TFW  gets to debate Joe Biden.
So Biden is better on economy?
So excited to support our Biden/Harris dream team!!
I honestly don‚Äôt see how someone can vote for Biden especially with Harris. Moreover, taking polls at face value is a fools game.
The Democratic base is getting stronger and wiser. And now with the Democratic ticket of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and ALL of the EXPERIENCE they each bring, we are NOW ENERGIZED! It may be a difficult race, BUT IN THE END WE WILL WIN!

Pretty much is the plan‚Ä¶ Biden is just a front.
I am so excited to support the #BidenHarris ticket. Joe Biden is running to restore the soul of our country. To win this fight he picked a strong fighter- Kamala Harris has spent decades defending our constitution and protecting the most vulnerable among us. I am ready!
Biden/Harris is the ticket of austerity and foreign provocations. There will be the usual miserable moaning( 'there is no money for social programs') as the defense budget steadily climbs.
This suburban "housewife" will be voting for Joe Biden as will the other three people in my family.
There are now hundreds, if not thousands of people on my facebook, who are both Biden and Trump supporters. While I asked Trump supporters to NOT COMMENT because my facebook is a site to support Biden/Harris 2020 only, they still felt the need to comment. RESPECT MUST BE EARNED!
A really important watch for anyone like me who is disappointed in every presidential ticket up this year. TL:DR- This won't bring change, it will beat Trump. Change is still a fight.  Let's talk about the Biden Harris campaign and what it means for us....
No she doesn't, dork. I guess Biden's Catholicism is being conveniently forgotten then?
I didn‚Äôt know that Joe Biden is Catholic.  John F. Kennedy was the first Catholic president we had.  I do know that Biden was an ACME SenateNet agent.
Ronna McDaniel lies as much as Trump. Obviously they fear this Biden/Harris ticket.
Is this a safe space? *whispers* I wish Biden picked Stacey Abrams instead
Republicans are clearly worried about the Biden/Harris ticket. The ridiculous assertions being made by Trump &amp; Ronna McDaniel are lol pathetic.
The big concern for me is that it seems apparent that at least some of Biden's crew, if not Biden himself, resents feeling like they had to choose someone like Harris--she's headed into a pretty toxic workplace with backstabbers aplenty.
I do not want to see civil war here by any means... But we have to face the fact we are already at war.. we are having a virus used against us and everything else..  Is the silent majority going to remain asleep if Biden does win and there is voter fruad or doubt on results?
I do know I haven't seen a single Biden flag, yard sign or sticker anywhere
God is calling on you Joe Biden to make the fabric of America right! To show people from ALL walks of life that the United States of America is a beacon for those seeking a better life! I proudly stand behind you and pray for you daily that you will have STRENGTH to GET IT DONE!
Isn‚Äôt Biden Catholic?
Interesting. No, really. Something to keep banging the drum on. I am also concerned about these republican "allies". However, I have more faith in Biden.
Biden's Catholic
The whole Tara Reade thing self-imploded without Biden doing a thing. We're supposed to give the accuser the benefit of the doubt. I believed Reade too until all her lies and grifts came out. No one has yet to prove that Trump's 2 dozenl0 accusers were lying.
D'oh! You're right. Biden is a practicing Catholic of the non pedophilia type.   No wonder Tobin overlooks this. He prefers Catholics who place brown babies in cages and white babies on laps.
Glad to vote against him. Now, who had more blacks incarcerated in the US, Kamala Harris or Joe Biden?
Btw, Fig Newton, how are Trumpy‚Äôs golf cart rides going?? Biden was out riding a bike to stay in shape while Trumpy rode around a golf course while hundreds of thousands are dying. I guess Trumpy knows ‚Äúwhale‚Äù is a shape, even though actual whales are in better shape than him.
She's literally willing to throw away what little rights she has left, and for what? Trump has been systematically removing every right gained under Obama/Biden &amp; yet she seems to be okay with that. If he gets to stack SCOTUS, it's all over, &amp; again, she's apparently ok with that
Its interesting how these anti-Kamala and anti-Biden replies always blow up while its the middle of the night in the US. Putin's scared.
I put a picture of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on my Facebook page, encouraging people to support them. I STATED CLEARLY IN NO UNCERTAIN terms that if you are a TRUMP SUPPORTER, YOU ARE NOT TO LEAVE A COMMENT ON MY SITE! Do you Trump Supporters read? Or are you ignorant like HIM?
Historic wisdom states that people do not vote based on the bottom of the ticket. I don‚Äôt think that holds true for this election. I was voting for  but I do feel better with  on the ticket. It shows that Biden respects her knowledge despite differences.
Want some truth? Harris went after Biden and he didn't go all fragile, male ego, snowflaking on a podium over it. He decided she should be a voice in his campaign and his government. Gee, imagine that. Y'all might want to man up &amp; see if it's possible for you to grow some balls

The reality that conservatives are trying to paint is harder to by with Biden.
Just from my short time living in Georgia it's wild. I've legit seen Biden stuff in Alpharetta. Not a *lot*, but damn sure more than I ever expected before moving out here with my preconceived notions.
Kamala Harris challenged Joe Biden in a debate and made him a better man. Rather than hold a grudge, he picked her as his running mate. This tells a lot about the man Joe Biden is - together they will make this country proud. I just contributed to their campaign. #BidenHarris2020
Everyone knows Biden is the beard for Harris. He‚Äôs gone in less than 12 months.
Did she not call joe Biden a racist? Ah I forgot we can just throw around that term nowadays.
I stand by what I said. Nobody outside of his base believes that Joe Biden is a Marxist.

If Biden wins and Kamala Harris becomes our VP, it will be an Obama moment for me #BidenHarris2020 #happytears
Not crazy about Biden, but the fact he‚Äôs actually listening to progressives and changing his policies for them hasr thinking that he‚Äôs definitely better than Trump
Really? Biden holds his faith dearly, you can‚Äôt determine is he is or isn‚Äôt Catholic. Plus, you‚Äôve lived without one in the whole house for 3 years... that‚Äôs... Sad.

Thank God Biden didn't chose Bottoms maybe now she'll take care of Atlanta as she elected to do. However in my opinion I doubt she will
Don‚Äôt forget that Kamala is a Law &amp; Order VP. Something  knows nothing about. I know Biden will pick a real Attorney General.
It's kinda weird.  was not my pick among Dem Presidential candidates. But she was my #1 pick for Biden's VP. She checks all the boxes. Great pick!

But when majority of voters don‚Äôt think Biden will finish a first term, it‚Äôs a play that could work.
If you claim you‚Äôre anti-trump but the first thing you did when Biden announced his VP pick is find dirt on Kamala Harris, you‚Äôre not anti-trump.
I don‚Äôt know how anyone who is serious about police reform could possibly vote for a Biden/Harris ticket. He wrote and she enforced the laws that led to mass incarceration of black men.   Jo Jorgensen is an option.

Unfortunately we are at a point where the candidates aren‚Äôt great, but Trump is definitely much much worse than Biden. The focus should be getting Trump out of office and by voting third-party or writing in someone‚Äôs name is just going to help re-elect Trump. But you do you.
You are too kind.  Biden is a known repeat liar.  He has told many whoppers such as his academic record.  He and his entire family are also crooks!
Nothing original about joe Biden.
Let‚Äôs be clear, Harris doesn‚Äôt support Biden.  She is using Biden, which is hard to criticize because he is simply a road block to her being President.He‚Äôs not well. Furthermore, Biden has no policy integrity and neither does she.They will get along fine before his 2 week notice.

Wow an historical event!!! The press said something critical of ‚Å¶ . Rumors have it another one might follow some time In September!
Biden might let him off.   The state of NY won‚Äôt.
Republicans for Biden in Georgia I ask that you vote down ballot and select #BryantforPSC #gapol
Vote for Biden
Doesn't fit the Biden Campaign controlled media narrative.
I‚Äôm voting for Biden bc I want to actually help people. For me, not voting or voting for third party (which - be real. Will never get elected) is telling people in need that my own individual ideas about utopic politics are more important than their livelihoods.
speaking of liars.  Now do Lying Biden.  Oh that‚Äôs right he‚Äôs on your team so you just turn a blind eye to his 50 years of lies.
And it‚Äôs been China, China, China the whole time.  Biden is unfit for office.
Biden said he would Force you to keep your mask on at all times.. And use the Federal Government to enforce it.. What kind of America do you all want...??   The One that's for the American People , Black, White &amp; Brown ,,and want to see you all do well..  Or Biden's AmeriChina
Major US postal workers union endorses Biden for president
you literally don‚Äôt have to vote for biden/harris... why tell the dnc that we‚Äôll vote blue no matter how much they disregard the people they *claim* to represent
The only age demographic where Trump is ahead of Biden is age 60 and older. That is the age demographic that would be most likely to vote by mail. It does strike me as a flawed strategy
Biden‚Äôs Mask Mandate Is a Ploy to Keep Him in the Basement
Maybe because they expected some level of maturity from us.  Accept their votes for Biden and shake their hands. When trump and his sycophants are gone, then we can discuss political philosophy. Until then, realize you are an adult and act like one.
Looks like the post office is dead while these fools are still debating about a crime bill. If Donald Trump win again remember you said you couldn't vote for Biden because of a crime bill and Harris is a cop who locked up criminals but wasn't supposed to lock up black criminals.
Restore dignity to the office of the Presidency.  Never Trump, Never Biden.  I‚Äôll be writing in.  Not for sale 2020.
Come on Biden show that leadership and get the democrats together, so shit can get done! Or do you have to ask your new wife, ahem I mean VP.
TRUMP on ISRAEL-UAE Deal: Joe Biden ‚ÄòDoesn‚Äôt Even Know the Names of the ...
‚Å¶ kettle kettle black black. #liar #COVID19 #covididiot
Let's think about that: James- "One of the smartest in the world" &amp; sides with Trump. Robert- One of the _____ in the world &amp; sides with Biden.
Things sure are different.  Back in the day, of Biden, Trump, Nancy and of probably 80 percent of Congress , the health of the auto makers told much of the story for the entire society.  Now I don't know.  Trump thinks its wall street, but not from my seat.
What does JOE BIDEN offer VOTERS ??
Oh my God !!! Hillary is back, "to help Joe Biden, in any way possible"????
Now more than ever it's true:  "It's not who votes that counts, it's who counts the votes"  Only way Biden wins is if the whole process is a fraud.
She‚Äôs garbage and it was a horrible pick Biden... This pick just elected trump another 5 yrs
I‚Äôm so angry about what‚Äôs happening to our Postal Service. We are being destroyed by villians ‚Äî right before our eyes. I don‚Äôt give a shit about Biden-Harris in November ‚Äî where are our patriots and heroes RIGHT NOW!
I don't think I get their defense. Since Biden said "little brown and black girls" could be inspired to have a higher office. It's ok to diminish a brown WOMAN?
Oh oh... actually I kind of like that she is coming out... no one likes her, not even the leftist democrats... this will help a Trump to garner more votes for him...  Hillary Clinton says she's ready to serve in Biden administration
Bless your heart, he's the President of the United States I doubt  covers his press conferences.     Has nothing to do with the Biden Campaign using my tax dollars to extend his 45 year career shaking down the American People.
'Q' is now the 'Tea Party' boogey man of 2020.    Defund   make the Biden Campaign pay for their own propoganda.
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden's Running Mate | National Review
. lead story was Biden suggesting a mask mandate (üò≤) rather rather than the record number of deaths. They're even bringing back Benghazi and Ferguson leading up to the election.   (Changing the channel before Nielsen ratings notices I watched. )
üòÇ yeah right, Biden doesn‚Äôt know what the hell is going on, I doubt he knows what day it is or where he‚Äôs at when he wakes up In the morning
Seizing on Masks as a Campaign Issue, Calls for Mandate. He doesn't get it. Not every situation requires a mask. Expert review reveals social distancing and using masks when distancing not feasible, plus wash hands. The best defense for COVID19
So Biden is Right wing? How far Left are you?  As for Dems, there are 2 kinds: The corporatists (think establishment), as you mentioned, and the communists (think AOC).
JOE BIDEN: Seeks National Mask Mandate
Reagan was 77 when he left office. Biden is 77 NOW, and already sounding mentally worse than Reagan ever did. Even the MSM may not be able to cover for him much longer.
I‚Äôm going be honored to üó≥ for you President Biden &amp; Vice President Harris in November 2020 Election...
#TheMaskedSinger  is over...Now, its the masked American  and according to biden, you should NEVER be unmasked
Absolutely not.  Look at a comparison of approval ratings between Hillary and Biden.
In what way is she moderate? Her views on immigration are radical. She is (and has been) authoritarian. She called Biden a segregationist and a sexual assailant when up against him and is now on the same ticket. Calling someone ‚Äúnasty‚Äù isn‚Äôt sexist and if you think it is, maybe..
#baitandswitch.    Vote for Biden, get Harris at inauguration......
.‚Å¶ blasts #KamalaHarris for NOW siding with  on #TaraReade allegations
#MasksOffAmerica.  Ok, so Joe Biden says ALL Americans have to wear a mask for a minimum 3 mos...Does that mean illegal immigrants in america do not have to wear mask???isnt that racist???
Joe #Biden was mentioned 17 times more at President #Trump's"#Coronavirus Briefing," than the actual virus in a 43 minute press conference there were two minutes and forty-eight seconds addressed #Covid19 and 37 minutes and 15 seconds on Joe Biden.  No new information was given.
The only war being lost is the Biden Campaign's floundering around looking for an issue...
Biden is a Moderate like I'm a Host at a Cheesecake Factory. (I haven't worked there in years.)
The USA will be rejoicing when VP Biden is elected President on Nov 3,2020
He is just looking for cover. He wants to hide out in the basement until the election is over.
The polls showing Biden ahead are laughable!
WoW! Hopefully they can avoid ole pervs like Chicken Joe Biden?
Kamala Harris exacerbates Biden‚Äôs existing problem with religious voters. He must work to reassure them.  there are many religions, &amp; we all don't vote b/c of our religion. I belong to an Orthodox Jewish synagogue, does that make me a "religious voter"?
Democratic Party Nominee: Joe Biden
Does it really matter, of all the vile things he‚Äôs done, it still doesn‚Äôt make one bit of diffrence. Nothing gets done, nothing will. I‚Äôll vote for Biden, hopefully he wins, and trump will write a book, and make more money, and laugh in our faces.
Why are you attacking Joe Biden. SMH
Lol.  Feels like I wouldn‚Äôt have a problem with Biden if I did
Except it‚Äôs not propaganda.  Biden has literally talked about enjoying kids rubbing up his legs. That‚Äôs not propaganda. That‚Äôs someone who doesn‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs acceptable and what‚Äôs not
So I guess Trump is gonna win again since it‚Äôs apparently so morally corrupt to vote for Biden. Nice.
I don‚Äôt drink orange kool aid tho. I got no problem with people attacking trump for the pos he is. It‚Äôs the pretending Biden isn‚Äôt also a pos I have a problem with
Just an FYI.  Hating Biden doesn‚Äôt mean I like trump.  I hate trump too ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
How does Biden‚Äôs policy make him equally dangerous??? Where are his ties to the KKK??? What are his conflicting billionaire-business-owner interests??? What are his connections with foreign governments??? What bigoted hateful misinformation is he promoting to our country???
Well that wasn‚Äôt part of the metaphor for a reason. By that logic you‚Äôre insinuating that a Biden presidency could potentially make everything worse than it would be if we stuck with Trump.
Because with Biden there is at least a CHANCE for something better than this!!!! If you were sick and someone offered you a pill, saying, ‚ÄúThis may make you feel better or it may do nothing at all,‚Äù are you gonna turn it down simply because it‚Äôs not a guaranteed cure???
At the very least, even if Biden ended up being the exact same as Trump, at least we tried to get something better. If we end up with Trump again we already know what we‚Äôre stuck with.
I‚Äôm confused why you‚Äôre asking me to give a specific outline of why or how Biden is different than Trump as if it isn‚Äôt completely obvious???? I obviously can‚Äôt ‚Äúprove‚Äù anything to you, we‚Äôd both have to wait and see.
Every 8 year old should be angry at Biden.  And every 8 year old should be angry at people thinking it‚Äôs ok he gropes them
We can only either have Biden or Trump. Choosing to have Biden rather than Trump does NOT mean that I fully support and agree with everything Biden/Harris say and do, it means I‚Äôm just choosing one over the other. But not choosing IS choosing to let others decide for you.
Again it seems like you‚Äôre insinuating that Biden is JUST as bad as Trump which doesn‚Äôt make any sense to me and if that‚Äôs really how you see it then idk what to tell you.
Joe "HITLER" Biden calls for Nationwide MASK Mandate. Fuck Him !!!! Have you forgotten Obama &amp; his Joe Biden. The Swine Flu for you dummies. They ignored it &amp; people died ????
If you really don‚Äôt see any difference between electing Biden versus TRUMP I really don‚Äôt know what to tell you. True, voting is not going to fix our problems but if Trump is our president for 4 more years it‚Äôs going to be a LOT harder for us to make the radical changes we need.
Biden and Trump are the only candidates that have a possibility of winning at this point. Either your vote supports Biden or your vote (or lack there-of) is indirectly supporting Trump. Regardless of everything else, ONE of them is going to be elected and you can‚Äôt not choose.
I‚Äôm not asking for general explanations, I‚Äôm asking for the people saying they aren‚Äôt going to vote to explain why they‚Äôre ok with letting Trump win again and why that‚Äôs apparently a better option than electing Biden.
The Corporate Media have made so much money hounding Trump for 4 years. Do they want that to end? CNN will collapse. MSNBC will collapse. WaPo will lose half their readers. Will an October Surprise actually come in AGAINST Biden?
I‚Äôm genuinely trying to understand. Do you really believe that electing Biden is no better than passively electing Trump for 4 more years??
I'm confused. Is  a radical leftist secretly pulling  strings to further a socialist agenda, or a moderate that's going to alienate the base and cost Biden the election? #BidenHarris
PENCE ON OFFENSE: ‚ÄúMore jobs under Trump-Pence since May than all of Oba...
Which tweet writer wrote this? Have you been close enough to the Biden for a hair sniff or a weird grab type hug?
Her best friend is Jill Biden?
Hillary &amp; Harris, only better chance, Biden will back out at convention. We‚Äôre just talking about swing states, but I think Trump Pence will still win electoral.
But when Biden did it, the Very Next day, it was just a gaffe. Just ol Joe being Joe.
What is your plan, for everyone to not vote??? Ok then what happens when Trump wins again??? You won‚Äôt elect to hurt our people but you will let Trump get elected again??? Biden would hurt our people but Trump won‚Äôt continue to??? I‚Äôm just trying to understand.
How is the Biden accusation credible but not the 25 allegations against Trump not?
Sounds like you hear only what you want to hear.  Biden listens to others. He evaluates and he's not afraid to change his mind if their ideas are better.
But Biden has a cognitive decline?  What the f is he talking about?
Universal Basic Income and Medicare for all if Biden gets elected.    Democracy dies with the DemocRATs.  Mail in voting, it's not who votes that count it's who counts the votes.  Always was, always will be.
I don't see why it can't be both. Its not like they are stopping Biden by making the world know progressives exist in the party.
Wow. You might want to read what I said again and note that I am a actively trying to help Biden and get people not to vote 3rd party. The DNC isn't making it easy. They added Yang to speak at the DNC convention so it looks like the actual goal of this tweet has been achieved.
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate
Y‚Äôall are so sanctimonious and insufferable      ‚ÄòRescued Again By Joe Biden‚Äô: Tucker Carlson Thanks Biden For Saving Him On Kamala Harris Name Mispronunciation  via
I got cousins who has been in and out of jail since they were 14. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris didn't force them to go around robbing people and stealing cars. At some point we have to stop blaming other people for decisions that we made.
Sounding nervous, Donnie! Biden for the win November 3! 81 more days!
That's what happens when you buy a Biden ticket
The thought of Biden winning is beyond my imagination.  We somehow survived a President who hated America and was a radical Marxist/Communist, but Harris is far worse!
VP Biden and Sen Harris are the folks to do that. They will remind our partners in the world they are our friends and allies. They will and do embrace diversity and the amazing strength it brings to our nation. I will not sit by and ignore your hate, I will vote Blue.
You mean you can vote for Kamala Harris? Biden's days are clearly numbered. I expect a William Henry Harrison presidency from him.
another Lie by Biden
It makes her Indian!!! She was a horrible choice... Lots of Black people will not vote this year because of that pick... Biden lost the electionüòÇüòÇ
So they need to stop saying she‚Äôs African American... She was a horrible choice and this will lose the election for Biden
Biden is the lesser evil but still evil.
I‚Äôm pissed just waiting 3 weeks for a book sent from within my own state. If I was waiting on meds or a check, and I wasn‚Äôt already voting for Biden, it would be enough to change my mind. #TrumpKillsUSPS
It definitely is a slap in the face. You‚Äôd rather another 4 years of a literal Anti Christ instead of just sucking it up and voting for Biden/Harris. I personally don‚Äôt like her views but as VP she won‚Äôt have that much power.
homophobic and taken America back in policy virtually faster than any president. There‚Äôs no telling how much damage can be done in another four years. Biden *also* sucks but we just gotta keep holding ppl accountable to that for the next elections (at every level) we can elect-
Bruh!  Kamala Harris is getting so much more scrutiny because she is a woman. I *DO NOT* agree with what she has done and she should be held accountable while in office by us paying attention to what she and Biden are doing. But guys... trump and pence are racist,sexist-
Biden-Harris, Osoff, Blackman, Bryant are your leaders for a real future and everyone in Georgia should vote these names on November 3rd #gapol
He clearly wasn‚Äôt talking about us, but YES! I am voting for Biden Harris.
- you gotta give up the title of ‚ÄúSlow Joe Biden‚Äù I thought of a new name for him because he‚Äôs easily manipulated so it‚Äôs gotta be ‚ÄúPlay-Doh Joe‚Äù ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Do yawl really think Biden made the selection for his VP? Really? Come on now . He probably saw the selected name the first time he read his queue card script he read from whil talking with her.
Wings n things and I went big for 9.97? Biden ain‚Äôt gonna have prices like this ijs
You must be young.... I'm guessing 20s lol the she was enforcing a crime bill that the cbc help write along with Biden
Biden thinks he picked Elizabeth Warren as VP. ASK HIM WHO HE PICKED.
Biden, Harris lash Trump in introduction of historic VP pick
Yeah congrats for sleeping your way to the top Kamala!!  With married men no less. And suddenly Biden is not a racist sexual assaulter like you called him only months ago?
Yeah congrats for sleeping your way to the top Kamala!!  With married men no less. And suddenly Biden is not a racist sexual assaulter like you called him only months ago?  You libs would have no standards if not for double standards!
Let us not forget she made it tougher for miniorites and put a lot away just like biden did with his 1994 criminal justice bill.
What is sad is someone who is a pimp for the DNC acting like he has any morals or integrity?  Note your channel has no news of Biden's many gaffes - why? Because you are in the anal cavity of the DNC?
Stop worrying about the Dems and pack your boxes! We putting u out as soon as the counts r in! U sold your vp slot to the KKK, Biden &amp; Barris have a true work ethics behind them. History in the making #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica #DumpTrump2020
Fake Flake will be irrelevant after Trump destroys the Marxist duo of Chicken Joe Biden &amp; Kamal-toad Hairasz?
And I keep seeing all these people talking about how seeing Biden/Harris renews their faith in America and makes them feel pride in their country again. Really?? Seeing 2 corrupt cops being morons makes you feel more patriotic but the riots and protests of the last several months
It‚Äôs time for the right wing, extremist, fascist reign of  to end. Vote Biden/Harris &amp; end the carnage inflicted by Trump.
Joe Biden is a sexual predatory and almost as corrupt and incompetent as Trump. We should not be excited to vote for him. Kamala Harris imprisoned thousands of Black people on non-violent marijuana charges and she keeps them in prison for as long as possible to use them as slaves
You realize Biden is only 3 years older than Trump right?
Hey y‚Äôall. I am so tired of seeing all these tweets praising Biden/Harris. Like they don‚Äôt give a shit about you. We don‚Äôt have to love the democratic nominee the same way the right does. We need to hold them accountable for their action the same way we do with the right.
This is a tactical error. Soaring rhetoric from Biden-Harris followed by Trump languidly reading statistics.
Joe Biden Selects Kamala Harris as Running Mate -
Why would the stock market crash if Biden was elected President? It didn‚Äôt crash when he was elected Vice-President.
Biden introduces VP choice Harris; much history, no crowd
I never listen to never politicians; definitely not a combo like Biden and Harris.
Biden and Harris finally shut up.
We've been starved for this. Leaders, actual leaders.
Joe Biden is Presidential.
Biden is talking to us right now. Trump reads to us lol.   Seriously, he‚Äôs looking into the crowd &amp; we feel more confident that it‚Äôs genuine.  take notes on how to address your people my friend!
This suburbanite is voting Biden/Harris 2020
HAPPENING NOW: Biden and Harris have finally stepped out, in matching blue suits too.

LIVE: Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris TOGETHER for the 1st time as running mates
Remember THESE Kamala Harris moments? | Five videos show why the Biden V...
Former  US  V.P.  &amp; US   Senator   Joseph   R.  Biden   made   a   excellent  decision   to  pick  U S  Senator  Kamala  Harris (D-CA)  for  his  running  mate !#BIDENHARRIS2020
Biden is forgivening student loans. They slow as hellüò≠
Media shows its bias &amp; hypocrisy by refusing to as ‚Å¶ health related. questions
Yeah Fr it‚Äôs pretty sad Trump and Biden are our two options. But ig #SettleForBiden
Harris released a detailed plan to invest in HBCUs and black entrepreneurship. She formed a task force to combat racial and ethnic disparities in COVID. Biden says he will provide $300 mil in grants to cities that reduce discriminatory zoning regs. There‚Äôs much MUCH more too.
If any one person could give me a viable alternative to Biden/Harris I would immediately voice my support for it but the reality is that they are our ONLY option other than Trump. I hate it just as much as everyone else but that‚Äôs the reality.
Believe it or not I have the exact same feelings as you do towards the corrupt democrats, but as much as I hate it, Biden is the ONLY alternative option to Trump, no one else is going to be elected. We have to choose one or the other.
One of my biggest foreign policy questions about a Biden presidency would be whether he‚Äôd reintroduce ‚Äúthe pivot‚Äù away from China like Obama started to do at the end of his term. Foreign policy side of Twitter, let‚Äôs discuss. üëçüèº
I can't believe you fell for that LIE!!! Biden does NOT support defunding.   Do you even know what defunding means?!?
A day care center minutes before Joe Biden arrives ....
I just think we need more than 3 months to organize in support for a third-party candidate if it‚Äòs to be successful. I‚Äôm sure that will be exactly what we do as soon as this election is over and we‚Äôll have years to plan, but I‚Äôd like to be doing so under Biden rather than Trump.
You‚Äôre SO woke that you‚Äôre not voting for Biden/Harris but not woke enough to outline an alternative plan when people ask???? Ok so how about instead you just shut thE FUCK UPPPPPP!!!!
I don‚Äôt really want Biden/Harris either but until one of you geniuses can make an actual PLAN of action go viral rather than a complaint, they‚Äôre our only option other than Trump.
To say the election is over now is like saying the baseball game was over after the 1st inning.  Wait till Biden is Live and Uncensored on the debate stage.
I can't wait for Biden live and uncensored at a debate stage near you!!
Hey, all of my people (#Team43 ü§†) came out in support of Biden... and that‚Äôs a known known!   ü§£üçª
If you vote for joe biden unfollow me thanks
Who is Kamala Harris? A look at Joe Biden's vice presidential running mate
You know thats who the Dems are really putting up there...right? Biden didn‚Äôt choose her. Lol
Biden-Harris(Obama) sees this and thinks, "Hiw can we send the mullahs MORE CASH?"
Breakfast Club Reacts To Joe Biden Picking Kamala Harris As Running Mate
Forces in the country, and within the Democratic Party, were indeed pushing Biden toward a history-making pick--&gt;&gt;
me: biden and harris are great indicators of how little people in power actually care about those they claim to represent neoliberals:
This is bull shit on it‚Äôs face, Biden is a life long Catholic. What pray tell is Trump Bishop?
No I will not! Biden/Harris 2020 #RidinWithBiden
Good luck with this Lola but I fear it‚Äôs like spitting in the wind. Can you find some that aren‚Äôt regular voters to come to the Biden side?
You were my first choice, but Kamala Harris was my 2nd. Look forward to campaigning hard for Biden/Harris 2020 and Abrams for Governor 2024!
i support whoever i vote for. it‚Äôs wild to me that you‚Äôd ‚Äúblame‚Äù voters instead of the oppressive system biden does not care about progressivism unless it‚Äôs convenient. what about him implies he listens? choosing a cop vp or saying ‚Äúnothing will fundamentally change‚Äù if he‚Äôs pres
ü§î Misogyny from where? Certainly not the same people who were willing to accept Palin as VP.  Unless just standing against a Biden/Harris ticket is now equal to misogyny.
Oh Liz, you already had your talking points ready to go before Kamala Harris was named Biden‚Äôs running mate. All you had to do was insert her name Grade for you = F, for thoroughly lacking originality.
Just because the Biden Campaign controlled press does not report it, doesn't mean it did not happen.  Every DemocRAT supports this terrorism.  Every one of them.  If they live in your house, kick them to the street.
Notice how the wording has changed. The fake NYT diverging from the "African American" necessity to "Person of color". Their nuance is telling.  Kamala Harris Is Biden‚Äôs Choice for Vice President
It makes you wonder about the principles of the left.  Another example would be Harris herself calling Biden a racist and an abuser of women, but then accepting the nomination. Accusations only matter during the primaries ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Defund  another article which proves it is just the propoganda wing of the Biden Campaign.  Taxpayers should not be forced to pay for this crap.  The DemocRATS need to fund their own crap.
You'll be waiting a long time since you refuse to accept any new information, like the covid plan from January or the fact that Joe Biden's chief of staff Ron Klain ran point on Ebola virus.  Remember when there was a scary disease you didn't get because they did their job
What is Trump doing (and not just talking about doing)  One thing Joe Biden would do is open up the Obamacare exchanges for a special enrollment period for the newly unemployed.  Trump has not done that. Lynnie-Karen
I am currently quarantined in my house because my MAGAT father had a fever and I don't want to give this disease to the people I love.  I am a suburban housewife who is unsafe and Ridin' with Biden
You have to win first: What Joe Biden's pick of Kamala Harris tells us about Biden
Yes!  I don't see any boat parades for Biden!
This women was just accusing Biden of felonious crimes and now she‚Äôs praising him. Why I‚Äôll never care for these political figures..
It may be snark, stating Biden is not catholic because of his stance on abortion?  Maybe.
i‚Äôm with you on that! all candidates deserve a place on the debate stage. she‚Äôd probably tear biden &amp; trump to pieces. she‚Äôs super smart and well spoken
You ppl are just the Nazi party of the US, it‚Äôs fine cause I know you already know this. But America is tired, so tired. I hope Biden doesn‚Äôt pardon Trump. He won‚Äôt be President forever and trump foundation will be what sends him to prison.
Ummmmm, Biden is as Catholic as the Pope.
Kamala hates Biden and you know it. Come back with something witty..The left‚Äôs hypocrisy knows no boundaries..
HRC was and is rotten to the core, Biden is gonna piggy back on 8 years behind obama to win it all just watch lol
In Biden's defense, if you had to pick your VP among all the Dems, who is a good choice?
That sounds like Biden.
How Biden selected Kamala Harris as his running mate
Would a President Biden put #KamalaHarris in charge of the gulags he's pressured to open up?
BREAKING: Joe Biden selects Sen. Kamala Harris as vice presidential running mate - TheBlaze

Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate, first Black woman
It‚Äôs as if this bishop from a tiny diocese just excommunicated Biden. Should we tell him that‚Äôs not how it works?
but whatever i guess, now i cant support them bc a biden bro was toxic on the internet :(
Watching  while making dinner. YT asks me, ‚ÄúCan you take a poll to help our advertisers?‚Äù  üôÑ OK, YT. ‚ÄúWhich do you have a more unfavorable opinion of, Trump or Biden?‚Äù ‚ÄúTrump.‚Äù YT then proceeds to show me 2 Trump ads in the next 10 minutes. Slap your algorithm, YouTube.
We aren‚Äôt enemies, my dudes. But we are in an aggressively boiling melting pot that‚Äôs going to bubble over any minute now. I don‚Äôt know if Biden or Kamala are going to be our wooden spoon, but I do know they aren‚Äôt our saviors
There‚Äôs a reason the left isn‚Äôt excited about Biden. Mans ain‚Äôt it
Biden will make the order to arrest us if we don‚Äôt take the vsccine
It could have been a Joe Lieberman rebooted, I would still vote for Joe Biden!
Tulsi should‚Äôve been Biden‚Äôs VP pick. #VPHarris #BidenVP
Biden and Harris=Birris or #BirristheVirus
Right you are. I‚Äôm not a fan of either Biden or Kamala, but they can‚Äôt do much worse than the current administration...we REALLY got screwed on this and the last election...
Warren is too fake and soft. I can't get over warren lying her way through life about the Indian stuff. I don't see how Biden stands a chance. The debates are gonna be a total shit show
My homie that works in DC was telling me she was the one they didn't want Biden to pick because it gonna be hard to attack her.
Kamala was an absolute dumpster fire as a presidential candidate and an unpopular AG in a liberal state. People in her own Party can‚Äôt stand her. Tulsi Gabbard was the move. Biden screwed up.
I think this analysis goes to the exact point for the Dems having picked Kamala as the VP. Biden is clearly unable physically and mentally  to campaign and even less of running the country. It‚Äôs now basically Donald Trump vs. Kamala Harris for president
‚ÄúThe current president is a science denying, racist, pedophile enabling, drug addicted murderer responsible for over 150,000 deaths BUT I am not happy about voting for Biden/Harris.‚Äù
biden better not drop out before the debates..
Don't get the Kamala choice. Tulsi would have been a much better choice. Still a bit too radical for me. Can't see this working out for Biden at all.
Biden's late to THAT party.
Ma‚Äôam, So proud of you and happy for your selection. Way to go, you will make a great team. I know you and Joe Biden will return our nation to the right path.
Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate, first Black woman
Yes, President Obama, let‚Äôs win this thing!  Our country needs healing and it needs healing fast!  I pray God uses Biden and Kamala in a mighty way!
She did accuse Biden of racism.  It was harsh.
I am guessing Secretary of State.  It will be a Kamal + Abrams ticket when Biden steps down.
Abrams will be the Secretary of State. So when Biden steps down in 2021, Kamala, P and Abrams, VP

Joe Biden announces George Soros‚Äô Vice President pick... There I fixed it for you.
So our choices in the next election are Joe Biden and The Syracuse Orangeman. Yeah I'm going to go downtown and see if I can get a crack head to run so I can have someone I feel can make a good decision.
Congratulations Senator Kamala Harris!! You and VP Biden will certainly get my vote!!
Neither did Biden‚Äôs the first two times. In fact, now that I think of it, the first two and a quarter times.
I‚Äôm on auto donate to Biden but I donated some more!!
So Soros finally told Biden who his replacement is.
Biden probably forgot about it üòÇ
In a move designed not to expand his base ‚Å¶ taps #KamalaHarrisForVP....
Truth: I was anxious. Worried Biden would choose wrong. I am so relieved and happy!!!! #BidenHarris2020
I first knocked doors for Michelle Nunn. I gave to Hillary's campaign. I knocked doors again for Stacey Abrams. I gave more than ever before to Warren in this primary. I'm progressive as fuck and I am telling y'all, Biden/Harris is a ticket we all can support without reservation.
I feel you bruh but the overthrow won't come until we are old n gone...it will be MJ (my 5 year old) that will be apart of that revolution. Biden cabinet will say another about what the nxt 4 going to be like...Sanders and Warren from what im hearing will be apart of it.
your ratings are so bad you didn‚Äôt even get live coverage of your daily lie fest. The celebration of Kamala being named Biden‚Äôs running mate was much more important &amp; news worthy.
Flashback: ‚Å¶ said she believed women who accused ‚Å¶ of inappropriate touching
I think its a solid win...funny enough its blk men thats not happy with this pick smh..we are the lowest voting block anyways....as long as the black women vote in high number like they been doing Biden wins.
Thanks for reiterating what a great choice this is! I can‚Äôt wait to cast my vote for Biden/Harris - by mail!
Oh you misunderstand me. I‚Äôm don‚Äôt plan to rely on Biden for much. Restructuring our elections process imo is going to have to be something the people do, trickle up change if you will. I just think the priority is to get Donnie gone if we want any sort of positive change.
BREAKING: Harris selected as Biden‚Äôs VP pick
Still think Biden doesn‚Äôt have the black vote?! Think again  And, please stop digging around in the mud and throwing it at them. They‚Äôre a great ticket and YOU KNOW IT! The higher they go, THE LOWER YOU GO! ü§¢
Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
Too bad Biden can‚Äôt speak though
There is the ticket  Harris: 'I believe' Biden accusers
Suspect Biden VP announcement timed opposite this hearing. Dems want this out of news cycle
and joe biden choosing a black woman just to prove he‚Äôs not racist or sexist when he‚Äôs said so much racist shit and i 100% believe tara reade.....like what the fuck
I really enjoyed Woody Harrelson's Biden, too.
Joe Biden made the perfect choice with this pick. She‚Äôll be an awesome VP, inspiring heir apparent and brutal campaigner. We saw her eat Biden‚Äôs still beating heart on the debate stage. Now we get to see her go after Donnie.
i am so sad,,, i have to unfollow you bc the shittiness of biden has increased by so much,,, thank you for the jokes back when it wasn‚Äôt reality üíó

Representation matters #BlackLivesMatter #BidenHarris2020
Of course. Of course. Of course. Biden picks the only person as his running mate that would make me even less excited to vote for him.
Biden picked Kamala Harris as his running mate ??? Oh baby trump finna win
Joe Biden really picked Kamala Harris I think he trying to lose because as a black man Joe signed that war on drugs bill in 90s and now picks a woman that was locking black men up for sport in the 2000s. Bernie I need you bro ü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Outstanding pick! No question that  on the ticket helps Biden win down here in Georgia! #gapol
Biden chose Kamala Harris, whom I have read up on, and she is a lawyer, has a long record of respect for the law, and I think she wants access to the law to be more universal.

BREAKING: Per CNN, Biden could make his announcement as early as today.
Preparing for Biden announcement. Some people already know. We have to wait.
Kasich - I use to admire your stance on many issues but to now think you'd support Biden, who hasn't anything left in his head, for president is too much.  Now, if you will forgive me as I forever turn my back to you.

Endorsing Biden.  Speaking first night of convention.
He said WW2 instead of WW1. That's a verbal slip. It did impact the war's resolution. And it got going in early 1918, not late 1917, but that's minutiae. 90% of Americans can't name the years around WW1. And a high % of Biden supporters are willfully ignorant of his dementia.
These are Biden's leading VP contenders? I haven't seen this much baggage since the last time I was at an airport...
Oh sure, keep bringing up Trump's "grab em by the pussy" line like it was literal yet make every excuse for Biden saying nigger years ago. What hypocrites. Btw, Ben Shapiro's joking about that stupid song was one of the most hilarious things I've seen all year! üòÇ
I saw the video too.  Don't know why the agent didn't empty his sidearm into the guy.  'Death by Cop' is what the Biden voter was looking for.

That's for Biden
Idiot. Acosta is the WH correspondent.  With attention to the PRES.   Biden isn‚Äôt president yet.
No, you are an idiot for blindly believing deplorable unethical trump. Biden and Harris are a great team!
Oh I agree, they don't want Biden to speak freely without a script. But you'd be lying if you said Trump didn't ever go off his script and stumble through to get back to script and sometimes say rather ridiculous things.

Biden an anti Israel Presidential candidate, has Hutzpah.On Trumps historic Middle East peace agreement, claiming as VP he laid the ground work. What Biden, Obama did was sell out Israel at the UN! Obstaining on a vote condemning Israel!  Allowing Israel to be called  criminals.
Has there been a time in history, when Presidential, And Vice Presidential candidates, can have a press conference, say anything, with impunity? Biden, Harris are the answer. Make accusations, and leave without taking any questions.
I will gripe about Biden  I might even say stuff about Kamala  (Probably not since she is the first smart move Democrats have made this entire election cycle)  But I‚Äôm certainly not voting for more fascism racism and mass death  So vote like lives are on the line because they are
By selecting #KamalaHarris Joe Biden is assured of the Black votes, women's votes, perhaps East Indian votes (after having derided the E. Indian accent of owners of 7-Eleven &amp; gas station managers), may also get the votes of Arab people who have a similar sounding name as Kamal.
Biden and Harris at their first joint fundraising event spoke without telling a lie.  How is that for a change!   O'Donnel -The last word.
Biden better buckle up because he‚Äôs got a big mess to clean up. And the only way to clean up this time is real change. Americans deserve healthcare and to be able to vote from the safety and comfort of our homes! Let Trump close our post office we‚Äôll use our computers finally!

So, Joe Biden wants to FORCE everybody to wear a mask? He sounds like a authoritarian to me...
Kamala Harris said she believed Biden's accusers, she is now forever tied to a sexual assaulter.
With all due respect. Why can't  biden finish his term?? Who has made this determination?
wake up America!! This guy wants a Nationwide Mask Mandate and won‚Äôt even answer press questions! This is what a Biden presidency looks likeüò≥ Biden is weak!!
I saw Joe Biden on a couple of episodes of Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego on YouTube.  Your friend Barbara Bush was on another episode of that show.
You can‚Äôt have it both ways. Do Biden/Harris want to abolish the police or do they want to ‚Äúmass incarcerate America‚Äù? This is such terrible messaging it‚Äôs laughable
This whole rumour of Biden‚Äôs dementia and demise is something I only see on Fox News, and even there it is just opinion people saying they have heard this from unnamed sources. To me it smells like Fox trying to start a rumour to aid Trump in the election.
Sounds like Biden also disrespected his socialist VP as per WP

Just like how people still support Obama and still want Hillary to be president, with all this real evidence coming out. Even their own people are throwing them under the bus as we twit, and now you see Biden as the great and powerful one. He really seems capable to you?
His own White House staff will be voting for Biden. They see it up front
What Republicans see = True  What Democrats see = False  it‚Äôs a Conservative meme so they truly think Trump is their Messiah but never work through their shadows in therapy so they project their faults onto others  my lefty feed contains MUCH Biden criticism but I‚Äôll vote for him

I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve learned anything definitive their ability to spread, except maybe they make up a higher % of asymptomatic spreading (i.e GA schools). What we do know is they can‚Äôt spread while learning remote with families following strict social distancing guidelines.
I‚Äôm hopeful it‚Äôs less dangerous but I also believe we‚Äôre still too in the infancy of our understanding of COVID to know. Even if it is less dangerous, kids can still spread like everyone else. And I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve taken the proper steps to have the BK employees back either.
Wait... is he campaigning for Biden now?
Didn‚Äôt say they shut down earlier, they didn‚Äôt. I do believe their shut down restrictions were more strict and enforced which helped get things under ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù. For GA where I live, we shut down and have opened up based on no signs we should have.
Yeah, ummm....this election is &lt;12 weeks away. People are vastly overestimating the chance of some massive overhaul happening
You forget that all those countries shut down and took the initial wave of cases seriously, the US did not. It was a coordinated effort to do what was necessary to stop the spread and then open slowly and with restrictions. We never got step 1 right.
Of course she is! She is a ü§• her ideas and values are absurd! The contentious relationship she and Biden have will be very interesting! She will speak for him and take over! He is an empty vessel! She is a power hungry woman who will say whatever she thinks people want to hearü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

The fact that you see Biden/Harris as worse than Trump/Pence is instructive. For many of us, Trump‚Äôs moral, temperamental, ethical and mental unfitness for office represents an unacceptable risk to the republic and outweighs any other consideration.

Pretty much is the plan‚Ä¶ Biden is just a front.
I am so excited to support the #BidenHarris ticket. Joe Biden is running to restore the soul of our country. To win this fight he picked a strong fighter- Kamala Harris has spent decades defending our constitution and protecting the most vulnerable among us. I am ready!
Biden/Harris is the ticket of austerity and foreign provocations. There will be the usual miserable moaning( 'there is no money for social programs') as the defense budget steadily climbs.
This suburban "housewife" will be voting for Joe Biden as will the other three people in my family.
There are now hundreds, if not thousands of people on my facebook, who are both Biden and Trump supporters. While I asked Trump supporters to NOT COMMENT because my facebook is a site to support Biden/Harris 2020 only, they still felt the need to comment. RESPECT MUST BE EARNED!

D'oh! You're right. Biden is a practicing Catholic of the non pedophilia type.   No wonder Tobin overlooks this. He prefers Catholics who place brown babies in cages and white babies on laps.

Biden/Harris makes Mondale/Ferraro look exciting..not a compliment btw.
This is true whether you want Trump to win or not. Biden backed himself into a corner and failed to gain any centrist footing in the process.

I loved Bernie and Elizabeth. But I'm not sure they'd be in the same position that Biden is now....
It was an honor to be on Senator Kamala Harris' Georgia Leadership Team.   It was an honor to support her then and is an honor to support her as VP. She is extremely qualified for this position and makes an amazing team with Biden.  Let's do this! #BidenHarris2020 #gapol

But when majority of voters don‚Äôt think Biden will finish a first term, it‚Äôs a play that could work.
If you claim you‚Äôre anti-trump but the first thing you did when Biden announced his VP pick is find dirt on Kamala Harris, you‚Äôre not anti-trump.
I don‚Äôt know how anyone who is serious about police reform could possibly vote for a Biden/Harris ticket. He wrote and she enforced the laws that led to mass incarceration of black men.   Jo Jorgensen is an option.

Hunter Biden settled $450K in tax debt within 6 days last month. Last year, he said he was too broke to pay child support.Biden was my next to last choice in the primary. I believe that, due to our electoral college system, only a binary choice is possible. Future elections and a needed national mask mandate can only happen if Trump is defeated.

No, you are an idiot for blindly believing deplorable unethical trump. Biden and Harris are a great team!
I think Trump has been cognitively consistent for 4 years. You might say ok, consistently stupid, but still consistent. Biden today compared to Biden 4 years ago seems like there has been somewhat of a decline, he has more trouble finding words, and there is just something else.
He just endorsed Biden/Harris.
I don't know any vets supporting Biden either, especially combat vets..  Just because you made it through basic and got med boarded from AIT doesn't mean you have bragging rights...ü§£  There is alot of stolen Valor, and POGs acting like they were in a ranger bat...
Fight in brothers. It‚Äôs just a warm up if Biden wins which would be a cold day in hell. But if the libs find a way to cheat there will be civil war in this country like you never seen. Then tell me who is going to get the best down not the right.
No the left are the raciest ones. Biden I will only pick a African American woman. That‚Äôs discrimination and Harris is descendent of slave owners all facts. So you tell me who the raciest are and hypocrites.
Yang, Gabbard, and Buttigieg were the only candidates I had enough respect for to maybe give them a chance against Trump. Right now a vote for Trump is a vote against Biden just like a vote for Biden is a vote against Trump.
Blame the Democrats for giving Yang like 10 seconds of time in the debates and Gabbard even less. Exaggerating, but the reality is that while I plan to vote Trump, I donated to both their campaigns bc they were not far left and also Biden is losing his marbles man.
Biden-Harris biggest fraud in history Biden broke the Equal Pay Act of 1963 Saying he pick a African American woman. Discrimination! Harris is not African American. Harris is a descendent of a family who owned 86 slaves. Who are the Raciest &amp; Hypocrites? Report the truth
If he loses, he will be escorted out of the White House by the USSS on the moment Biden is sworn in.
Never thought he'd endorse Biden
Biden screwed up on VP pick, I can't vote for Kamala. I am opposed to not voting, that is ultimately a vote for the winner. Abstaining only had meaning in parliamentary proceedings. Trump is a jerk and the GOP needs to be punished.  Maybe I go with the Constitution Party.
He's obviously voting for Biden then

So think of it this way. Biden Harris win. And gop wins house. Kevin McCarthy is now speaker. Biden ‚Äúdies‚Äù and Harris becomes president. Kevin does not become Vice President. Harris gets to choose her VP. Which is a highly unlikely scenario.
I know this is from May 2020 but... Seems kinda odd...and convenient...and scary af. So, is how Harris/Biden can b polling ahead of  even tho VP Biden refuses to answer even 1 simple question? Seems like a way to interfere in &amp; steal an electionü§îüò≥

Because of the green new deal they decided to run BIden off solar power which only gives him so much time before he needs recharge.  They should consider lithium batteries for longer life so he can take questions.
Biden will win we already know that. Your done
Trumps fine. Biden is not.
Seriously, I would like to hear one thing that Biden is going to do that has convinced you to vote for him!  He has been in political office for 50 years ans has done nothing.
Biden is leading in the polls now, according to the media. So if Trump wins, will you assume fraud? And, because of the assumed fraud, would you approve of forcefully removing him from office?
Biden being a guaranteed win was an exaggeration, I assumed that would be obvious since every media outlet shows him in the lead (like they did Hillary in 2016) but if my exaggeration was taken at face value that was not my intent. No media outlets have him at 100% chance.
And yet if Trump wins, every democrat is going to say they are sure it is due to fraud, there could be no other way. And so, of course, it will be important to remove him by force, and install Biden no matter what.
What I find funny about the situation is Dems that simply cannot fathom another legitimate Trump victory. Doesn't matter how much you say that Trump voters are silent until the booth. All they know is what the media tells them, which is Biden is a guaranteed win. It's crazy/sad.

First Biden does not know what day it is. Harris is about the biggest hypocrite there is.  Biden probably does not even know who his running mate is. If he was asked a question he probably answer a question from two days ago &amp; Harris will just make up a pure lie.
Their tactic is to lie and smear and just make up total BS about Trump and his White House then duck and run.  Like the Taliban they make a surprise ambush then run away. Well that‚Äôs what Biden &amp; Harris are doing.

Biden did the most raciest thing he could possibly do. In this country we pick people based on experience not race. But Biden picked a VP based on Gender and  color. So he said he would pick a woman of color. So it just shows he is a bigger raciest then thought.

I do have kids (one with asthma) and am enrolling them in a virtual school for this year because I don‚Äôt have confidence the public school systems will be given the proper tools to curb the spread.
I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve learned anything definitive their ability to spread, except maybe they make up a higher % of asymptomatic spreading (i.e GA schools). What we do know is they can‚Äôt spread while learning remote with families following strict social distancing guidelines.
Everybody it's important to always have a sort of healthy fearful caution, if the data says things are getting worse then they are, but if it says they're getting better then the data is wrong  although sneak peek if Biden wins things might get better you'll have to wait and see
I‚Äôm hopeful it‚Äôs less dangerous but I also believe we‚Äôre still too in the infancy of our understanding of COVID to know. Even if it is less dangerous, kids can still spread like everyone else. And I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve taken the proper steps to have the BK employees back either.
Im not a republican but my parents are. They live in Pennsylvania and theyre voting for Biden time. How he handled Covid is the reason why. They‚Äôre older so they‚Äôre higher risk and they dont feel like Trump is taking it seriously.
Wait... is he campaigning for Biden now?
Didn‚Äôt say they shut down earlier, they didn‚Äôt. I do believe their shut down restrictions were more strict and enforced which helped get things under ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù. For GA where I live, we shut down and have opened up based on no signs we should have.
You were saying,
A perspective by the  (National Shooting Sports Foundation) on Kamala Harris and gun control.
You forget that all those countries shut down and took the initial wave of cases seriously, the US did not. It was a coordinated effort to do what was necessary to stop the spread and then open slowly and with restrictions. We never got step 1 right.
Biden can‚Äôt do it. Body and mind won‚Äôt allow it.
Don‚Äôt fall for it!!! Don‚Äôt let him draw support from Biden. We must be unified to defeat Trump.
Biden and Harris will most likely win (as long as Biden remains out of the public eye). Harris will replace him pretty early on and run for re-election in 2024. We won't have a chance to address the real issues until 2028 but by then things will likely be too late.
Kamala is running along side KKK Supporting Joe Biden. What an inclusive ticket the Democrats have arranged.
How many of you really believe Biden had anything to do with selecting Kamala Harris? Yeah, me either...
We are ALL IN Joe Biden! LET'S GO! BIDEN/HARRIS IN 2020!
What I'm confused a out is why these idiots seem to think Joe Biden will not be able to complete his term??? I'm mean if the lard ass, fast food never does a day of exercise ,can't walk down a ramp unassisted, or hold a glass of freakin water can manage! Biden will be FINE

Biden didn‚Äôt select Kamala fat left told him to pick her since she is real far left. Remember she said she wants to destroy Second Addendum  in first hundred days.
No they wont be.  Theyre sick of being trapped in the house because of your mismanagement of Covid.  They want out of the house and that means voting for Biden.
And in the mean time you are helping trump win reelection. You are helping RBG to be replaced by a right wing nut job. Biden wasnt my first choice either but he's my ride or die now because the next president will either be biden or trump.
Joe Biden didn't pick anyone, he was picking his nose when the Deep State chose Heels Up Harris
Honestly doesn't matter...Joe can debate or not...you can have Kamala or not...BIDEN WILL NOT EVER WIN!!!
TFW  gets to debate Joe Biden.

Think I‚Äôm gonna skip this years presidential election, tired of choosing the lesser of two evils! I hate Kamala Harris and I hate Trump, Biden is just a dumbass in the way
I honestly don‚Äôt see how someone can vote for Biden especially with Harris. Moreover, taking polls at face value is a fools game.
The Democratic base is getting stronger and wiser. And now with the Democratic ticket of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and ALL of the EXPERIENCE they each bring, we are NOW ENERGIZED! It may be a difficult race, BUT IN THE END WE WILL WIN!
So Biden gets more than 400 EVs?
It‚Äôs ok not to like trump. But I believe he loves his country more than you hate him and he will do what he thinks is best for me and you like it or not . I couldn‚Äôt imagine Biden at the wheel . His problem would be , he wouldn‚Äôt know he is at the wheel

Why Trump may struggle to run against a Biden-Harris ticket  via
Post a couple Pro Biden Tweets, you should be fine.
Hold up, both of you. The "I would veto m4a" line is worthy of criticism because to VETO it means it already got THROUGH congress. That would be trashing a big win. Biden remains a better option than Trump. It's colossally stupid for him to threaten veto on prog legislation tho!
Second-greatest day. Seeing him refuse to concede but be ignored after Biden wins in a landslide will be almost as good as seeing him gone from the White House before Jan. 20 because he doesn't want to participate in Biden's inauguration.
Yeah, because those  ratings are through the roof. Biden does online town halls and gets 19 viewers. Unless  gives a press conference detailing her rise to the top - Willie Brown - no one would watch.
Glad to vote against him. Now, who had more blacks incarcerated in the US, Kamala Harris or Joe Biden?
Kamala Harris is the First Indian American to be selected to run for President after she gets rid of Mindless Joe Biden!!! And I thought they said they were going to nominate a Black Woman. Oh well, four more years...‚Ä¶...
I put a picture of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on my Facebook page, encouraging people to support them. I STATED CLEARLY IN NO UNCERTAIN terms that if you are a TRUMP SUPPORTER, YOU ARE NOT TO LEAVE A COMMENT ON MY SITE! Do you Trump Supporters read? Or are you ignorant like HIM?

I honestly don‚Äôt see a Biden victory after the Harris pick.
Biden represents Obama's legacy, there are enough blacks that will vote for him for him for that reason alone. He doesn't need help there. Kamala is there to appeal to suburban women. And counter Trump's Law and Order message.

Nobody is crazy about Biden we all had other candidates in mind but four more years of Trump we can‚Äôt survive that. There is no perfect candidate but this election is too important to not not vote or third party. Bite the bulletin vote Biden and them him accountable to policy.
That clip right there is full proof that Biden didn‚Äôt make the VP pick...
‚Äúpersonally spent time with leaders of both Israel and the UAE,‚Äù Michael Doran scoffed that ‚Äúthe biggest memory the Emiratis have of their time together with Biden‚Äù was when he had to apologize after accusing them publicly of having funded and armed jihadists in Syria.
Biden an anti Israel Presidential candidate, has Hutzpah.On Trumps historic Middle East peace agreement, claiming as VP he laid the ground work. What Biden, Obama did was sell out Israel at the UN! Obstaining on a vote condemning Israel!  Allowing Israel to be called  criminals.
Has there been a time in history, when Presidential, And Vice Presidential candidates, can have a press conference, say anything, with impunity? Biden, Harris are the answer. Make accusations, and leave without taking any questions.
Biden blames Trump for all of the lost lives due to COVID.  So by his rationale, if he had been President and didn‚Äôt close the borders (as he ridiculed Trump for doing) he would have been responsible for 1-2 Million American lives lost!
Has Joe Biden, or Donald Trump for that matter, taken a stance that I‚Äôm not aware of on transitioning children?
Vote for Biden because he is decent, qualified, experienced and can restore NORMALCY to this country... you don‚Äôt have to like or love someone to hire them to do a job for you.  Americans need to GROW UP!
History has been made! Congratulations Kamala Harris on becoming the VP nominee. You represent every woman of color. I know you will do us proud!!!  #pwreign #politics #BlackWomen #BlackWomenLeadVP #BlackGirlMagic
Biden asking to ware mask but nothing about Distancing. Because he wants to make sure the Rioters and looters face cover but still can burn and steal.
Biden wants mask for 3 month. We were right he wants to keep this virus live with mask no matter what so he can stay in basement not answering any questions. #Basement President
I will gripe about Biden  I might even say stuff about Kamala  (Probably not since she is the first smart move Democrats have made this entire election cycle)  But I‚Äôm certainly not voting for more fascism racism and mass death  So vote like lives are on the line because they are
We will see. your known quantity (Biden) doesn‚Äôt know where or who he is. #BLEXIT
There are many more senerios she missed. 1- dems push mail in voting and results are tainted. Leading to dem protest then confrontation with Trump supporters, and basically civil war. 2- Biden wins Trump leaves but half don't accept results and civil war.  Either way, violence.
Exactly. Not even Biden/Harris can tell you how. And they won‚Äôt. They‚Äôre betting on fear mongering for their votes. Not actual solutions. #BLEXIT2020 #BLEXIT
By selecting #KamalaHarris Joe Biden is assured of the Black votes, women's votes, perhaps East Indian votes (after having derided the E. Indian accent of owners of 7-Eleven &amp; gas station managers), may also get the votes of Arab people who have a similar sounding name as Kamal.

Can you translate what Biden was saying? Your candidate loves to fondle children and is a child molester.
And Biden still leading. WTF
Hey  &amp;  so, how will Joe Biden actually enforce the mask mandate &amp; jail people?  They are defunding the police, right?  Great way to continue to spread #Covid_19 : put together in a small space a bunch of people who didn't wear a mask. #halfbaked

It‚Äôs a condensed convention and not everyone could be up there. Beto isn‚Äôt there either or Katie Porter so many I would have loved to see or hear. They had to pick key ones that would be most impactful to Biden and Kamala to win. It‚Äôs nothing personal.
Brett I hope if And when you interview Biden , you treat, and ask him the same very tough questions you asked of Jared Kudhner!
. You have this election in the bag. You‚Äôre only thing that stands between us and four more years of total incompetence. Hopefully this call for a three month mask mandate while OUTDOORS is not a sign of even dumber ideas to follow.
I only listen to real leaders who believe in science and follow advice of experts. That‚Äôs why I am ignoring this  IMPOTUS Dotard and listening to Biden and will also be voting for him to take over for this ü§° in November.
Only Trump could kill 160,000+ Americans. Biden wouldn‚Äôt do that
So, Joe Biden wants to FORCE everybody to wear a mask? He sounds like a authoritarian to me...

Disagree. As someone who has lived in Ohio Kasich is popular with both Dem &amp; GOP. If him talking can sway voters in this very key state it could be the thing we need to get Ohio blue. Biden knows what he is doing. This is about the whole party beating Trump in Nov.
I missed the Biden &amp; Harris debut today.  What did I miss?
Honestly he should be. Having a GOP at the convention going to vote for the Dem is huge and he is popular in a very key swing state of Ohio. Him speaking to explain why he is picking Biden over his own party in hopes of swaying others is very important and deserves time.

Yikes.  This can‚Äôt help their relationship...
Fired up and ready to go again!!! Biden/Harris 2020!!!
You bet! We support Biden/Harris!
The GOP is dead in America! We're supporting Biden/Harris!
You're a ride and crude embarrassment to the people you are supposed to be serving. We will be supporting Biden/Harris!
We are happy about that! Proud to support Biden/Harris!!
If you think Biden‚Äôs platform is ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not the other guy‚Äù you‚Äôre not paying attention. Parties come and go but there will always be two. I didn‚Äôt vote for Biden in the primary, and I stand by that decision, but I will not be complicit in giving this fascist wannabe another term
The reality that conservatives are trying to paint is harder to by with Biden.
Just from my short time living in Georgia it's wild. I've legit seen Biden stuff in Alpharetta. Not a *lot*, but damn sure more than I ever expected before moving out here with my preconceived notions.
I stand by what I said. Nobody outside of his base believes that Joe Biden is a Marxist.
If Biden wins and Kamala Harris becomes our VP, it will be an Obama moment for me #BidenHarris2020 #happytears
Really? Biden holds his faith dearly, you can‚Äôt determine is he is or isn‚Äôt Catholic. Plus, you‚Äôve lived without one in the whole house for 3 years... that‚Äôs... Sad.
A brave, bold choice for sure. This should encourage Americans from any background to run for office and make their voice heard! It will be interesting to see how this campaign pans out. #KamalaHarrisForVP
Biden/Harris &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Trump/Pence  Voting third party is the same as voting for Trump. This shouldn‚Äôt even be a conversation
I loved Bernie and Elizabeth. But I'm not sure they'd be in the same position that Biden is now....
Thank God Biden didn't chose Bottoms maybe now she'll take care of Atlanta as she elected to do. However in my opinion I doubt she will
Don‚Äôt forget that Kamala is a Law &amp; Order VP. Something  knows nothing about. I know Biden will pick a real Attorney General.
It's kinda weird.  was not my pick among Dem Presidential candidates. But she was my #1 pick for Biden's VP. She checks all the boxes. Great pick!
You‚Äôre so inspiring. I had hoped it was you, but will show up to do my part for Team Biden in November.
If you claim you‚Äôre anti-trump but the first thing you did when Biden announced his VP pick is find dirt on Kamala Harris, you‚Äôre not anti-trump.
I don‚Äôt know how anyone who is serious about police reform could possibly vote for a Biden/Harris ticket. He wrote and she enforced the laws that led to mass incarceration of black men.   Jo Jorgensen is an option.
She has accused Biden of being a racist, said she believes his accusers(sexual harassment)-in addition to her filthy war on poor people while DA. What a great pick üòÇ
I guess #phonyKamala doesn't ‚Äúbelieve‚Äù Joe Biden‚Äôs sexual assault accusers anymore...ü§î
What‚Äôs wrong with Kamala Harris? Probably better than Biden himself.
Yes. But now they are best friends. Just like Obama and Biden.
I am definitely voting for Biden/Harris...we need to move on from the caveman mentality!
Since 2016? How many women aborted for him? He used to be pro-choice until he decided to hijack the Republican Party. He has no values, no political ideology. The guy is simply playing Americans. Biden is a better Christian
Please. We are between a rock and a hard place. Trump is the hardest place. As a Sanders supporter, I beg you, make that choice for Biden because I fear that we may not have another chance. üò∞üëäüôèüí™
This exactly. Harris isn't perfect, but she's a whole lot better than pretty much all our other options atm, and she sure af is better than keeping our current president in office. And even Biden is better than what we have now. Not by much, but still.

Will start gofundme for bail money hang on lol
Biden takes no questions, gives no interviews that are not preprogrammed. He appears only in very short, controlled segments, but visibly suffers from dementia, with its characteristic hair trigger angry outbursts.  The Leftist Media protects him.  I tremble for our future.
I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôre being tongue-in-cheek here, Scott, but many a truth is said in jest.   2021 is likely to be worse than 2020. If Biden wins, we‚Äôll be longing for 2020.

Biden literally is offering NOTHING period. He‚Äôs running a Hillary 2.0 campaign of I‚Äôm better than Satan. That‚Äôs it. I don‚Äôt expect him to support a  $2000 ubi, cause he‚Äôs a corporate tool. But the least they can do is offer at least $750-1000/mo ubi til the pandemic ends. Nope!

Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate
I pray to god Kamala Harris proves me wrong and she does everything humanly possible to push Biden to systemic, structural change to restore power back to the people and lift up their lives. History since Clintonism infected the party tells me she won‚Äôt, as Obama didn‚Äôt.
For Obama, a textbook narcissist, Biden was always perceived as a buffoon who couldn‚Äôt protect Obama‚Äôs precious legacy. Obama embraced Joe only to preclude a Pres. Sanders, with the understanding Harris, Obama‚Äôs acolyte, would have extraordinary power even before Joe steps aside.
I wouldn‚Äôt call Biden/Harris that.... maybe some other words but okay!

If you think we were doing any better economically before Trump your a retard. That‚Äôs the tweet. Kamala Harris is a fraud do your research she might be worse then Joe ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt make sense‚Äù Biden.
Old but true. Not sexist. Biden is also a phoney, painting himself as a Progressive AND a Moderate like he can actually be both.
Which means a quicker demise w/Trump or the continual, slow march off the cliff w/Biden. That‚Äôs the choice we face in November. We know this bc Biden has told us nothing will fundamentally change under his administration except better decorum. Almost time to say good night Lucy!
This is the continued future of America with Trump or Biden. This is the predictable result of decades of neoliberal policies by both parties. But as I‚Äôve said many times we deserve this corrupted government and all of the damage we get. We are the architects of our own demise.
Ok. After not voting for Biden/Harris &amp; leaving to chance that Trumpandemic might be re-elected, what‚Äôs the move? Not necessarily your plan but the plan of someone who is thinking this way &amp; spewing misinformation about this candidate? Are you voting for Trump by default?
Kamala Harris was hand picked by the Democratic establishment so she can become president when Joe Biden dies in office if he gets elected. I don't have facts to back this up, but I wouldn't be surprised if that was the case.
Biden is such a beta donk
Vote Biden.  45 must be defeated no matter what. Not voting or voting third party just helps 45.
Some one will be in office in November. A knee will be on our neck in November. Biden doesn‚Äôt have the thirst for murder like Trump. He‚Äôs lost too much( family). We‚Äôre faced to look into a man‚Äôs eyes &amp; see his heart. Or do nothing. For our children. Not even for us.
All that I can say is that I‚Äôve seen Trump. Forget about him being racist &amp; his lineage to the KKK he‚Äôs radically incompetent. With that being said by the process of elimination I‚Äôm voting for Biden &amp; Harris so as to not leave open the possibility that #Trumpandemic continues.
Doug....do you include your 3 children on calls of a political nature?  Please remind me....what office/position in the US Govt does Hunter Biden hold?  Attacking the child of a candidate...hmm, definitely not Christian. So...your kids are fair game also?  #gapol #GAsen #GAGOP
Birds of a feather lose together. Biden could have picked the Pope as a running mate and he would still lose because he sold out his country when he committed treason giving Iran a sworn enemy billions of our dollars.
Its the truth tho isn't it? Biden made a big deal about wanting to pick someone based on their gender and race. Why? Its also obvious that the  is counting on ppl voting for her instead of him.

Just one person but my wife took her Biden sticker off her car last night.
How Biden decided on Harris   Joe decided nothing He Was told to pick her.
Before Joe Biden named Sen. Kamala Harris his running mate, women‚Äôs groups were readying a campaign of their own: shutting down sexist coverage and disinformation about a vice presidential nominee.
It‚Äôs particularly nice because she might very well be at the top of the ticket in 2024 if Biden wins this time.
How it happened: Inside Biden‚Äôs search for a running mate
their allegiance is to china and russia and iran! FOLLOW THE MONEY! how much has china (chinese) contributed to harris? or biden? we know of the $billion (contract) china gave to hunter's company and the $.5 million/year russia paid hunter for ? years BUT......
Ole Joe kept saying he wanted to find his Joe Biden someone he could trust so he picked someone that called him a racist. #smh
I'm not sure I would have known if I didn't go down a rabbit hole as to the legal question of whether Obama could be Biden's VP which led me to the clause in the 12th amendment
All I know, don't criticize anything about protesting injustice. Will Travis have Biden on is show or was the interview with 45 was a campaign stump?
NO! harris is a liar and and a criminal! she was in on the coup to overthrow the President and should be arrested as a traitor along with ALL involved in the coup! The United States will become like chicago and san fransisco if biden/harris are placed in office!
it's ALREADY been decided! biden/harris will win by a landslide! there will be a 110% to 125% voter turnout and 135% will vote straight demonrat ticket! there will be at least 11.5 million non-citizen try to vote and 14million will be demonrat votes!
joe biden had no say in the choice! pelosi and the "squad" made THAT decision! IF biden/harris are chosen,harris will be president,either as biden's replacement or biden doing everything harris tells him! if this happens rename America san francisco
IT'S RACIST! BOTH biden and harris are 100% RACISTS! BUT, since they are democrats, it is overlooked and ignored!
Bryson, I think you know this already, but we don‚Äôt really have the time to say what Kamala Harris is.  No doubt about it...she is just a bad choice.  What were Biden‚Äôs handlers thinking
I am going to take a chance and offer an OPINION!I predict that there will be a landslide victory for biden/harris! In some areas there will be from 110% and 120% of registered voters vote for biden/harris.There will be at least 11million non-citizens attempt to vote.
Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate
This is an important moment in history, and I am proud to be a part of it. With  support, Biden/Harris will win this thing in a landslide. This gives many people hope that these last 4 years of hell will be over soon. #BidenHarris2020 #BidenVP #Obama
Why do you care you already said your not voting for #Biden.
Wow.... Just fucking wow! Mr. President. Do you mean for us to understand that YOU sir have never been Nasty or Disrespectfull to anyone? WTF! Maybe IDK, just Maybe Joe Biden actually appreciates others opinions. Not just his own. #BidenHarris2020 #donaldtrump2020
I mean facts are facts.. idk how anyone can put up a defense against what‚Äôs she‚Äôs done and not acknowledged for it. Biden is trash but he at least owned up to it. Harris became the worst part of the system and did nothing to help it. Prosecutors are truly the end all be all.
Biden just as bad as trump but y‚Äôall ain‚Äôt ready yo talk about that. I don‚Äôt talk about politics though. Argue with yaself üíØ
What a joke!!!!!biden has to have a women fight for him .... so sad
We‚Äôre America is going to get this party started by riding with Biden/Harris!
In choosing Harris, Biden is embracing a former rival from the Democratic primary who is familiar with the unique rigor of a national campaign.
This is fake. It shows Biden ahead. I don‚Äôt believe that for a second.
I'm not excited but I will vote for them. I think Biden was kinda backed in a corner with that pick. I was a  or  fan. She didn't have but 5% of our vote when she was running.

I can't tell you Tweeps how proud I am of Biden's pick. I adore Kamala, I'm cryingüò≠
You really think BIDEN selected Guatemala Harris???  No...it was the ‚Äúhandlers‚Äù who keep him locked up in the basement.
Interesting how everyone is celebrating Biden/Harris as if they've already won. That needs to stop. It was people acting like that with Clinton/Kaine that ut us in this situation to begin with. Celebrate AFTER a win, not before.
I‚Äôm an American who believes that black lives do matter. For that reason, I could NEVER vote for Biden. He helped write the 1994 crime bill that locked up black fathers (over pot &amp; stupid crap) &amp; Kamala spent her career locking up black Americans. I‚Äôm voting for President Trump.
That can't be Biden in that picture he's not sniffing anyone
Biden wins he steps down by ground hogs day, guaranteed

"Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate"
Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his running mate  ‚Äî She will be a good running mate even though she was not my top choice.  Biden made a safe pick.
Biden isn‚Äôt the first politician to tap Kamala.
The excitement of seeing Biden and Harris running together to get us out of this pandemic mess.  I want to stop the bleeding of our soul. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether they‚Äôre conservative or progressive, they matter to me.
EXACTLY! Even if she did, Biden's obviously "over it," so why should they even care? I think this clearly shows that they're so scared out of their wits; they're scrambling for "traction," &amp; "grasping-at-straws!"
Wasn‚Äôt Harris always Obama‚Äôs candidate, back when he was discouraging Biden (‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to do this, Joe‚Äù)?  But Harris couldn‚Äôt even win the Democrat Primary; so, Obama plotted this bait and switch.  #VoteRedToSaveAmerica   #HarrisIsTooRadical
Joe Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris as his 2020 vice presidential running mate
Wow! She couldn't even wait a day before shelling out the blatant lies &amp; "projectionist- innuendos." "Biden, an "empty shell?" Woman please! Sorry, but #45 is the "emptiest shell' on the beach!" I see she's learned well from her "evil, repugnant, script-flipping, cult-leader!"
Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate
So, you're saying #45 is a better pick? Have you lost your ever-loving mind? Biden could've picked "Charles Manson" as his running mate, &amp; I still wouldn't vote for #45, &amp; that, "pitiful, brown-nosing, no-account, yes-man, of a hypocrite, Pence!
I think Harris will bring the energy in spades that they claim Biden is lacking. It‚Äôs a shame she can‚Äôt debate Trump!
So does anyone else think that #BidenHarris2020 is merely a Democrat ploy to get her into the White House and then have Poor, Creepy ol' Joe Biden deemed unfit for president? #Trump2020 #MAGA2020
And if she fails to respond to our demands &amp; push Biden hard for concessions she‚Äôll all but know she need not even suit up for ‚Äò24. As  said on  show, progressives are on the rise. The monied interests are scared shitless now. 3 or 4 more big wins  &amp; they‚Äôll fold
has this exactly right. I‚Äôm not Voting in support of Biden, but hand the office to the person who can be accountable and will respond to pressure. Harris wants to run for Pres. The more and relentless pressure will have a definite impact on her in 2024.

I do not have to believe that Trump is a saint to judge that Biden is much the worse sinner. I detest Franklin Roosevelt, but I would never support Hitler against him.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Trump is Satan as far as I‚Äôm concerned and HAS to be removed. But that doesn‚Äôt mean this country was all daisies and roses under the previous 4+ decades run by Democratic and Republican neoliberals, which includes Biden‚Äôs policy influences as well.
If you don‚Äôt believe Biden is a bait &amp; switch guy I suggest you take off the rose colored glasses &amp; do some research on his 40+ year political career. Your children‚Äôs future depends on you being a more informed voter. Anyone taking these people at their word in 2020 is troubling.
Young people backed Bernie over Biden for a reason, because they‚Äôre informed on the issues affecting their present &amp; future. After witnessing 30+ years of Clintonism running this party, and understanding Biden as a full throated supporter of Clintonism, my cynicism is warranted.
Now you understand where I‚Äôm at in this election. I‚Äôm cynical because the facts dictate I be. The money &amp; power in the Democratic Party didn‚Äôt line up behind Biden &amp; against Bernie because they believe he‚Äôll do the right thing &amp;:pass progressive policies. We‚Äôll have to make him.
I will vote for Biden because he‚Äôs not the Satan in the White House. Would I love it if he fought for the policies hes putting out, yes. But I‚Äôm prepared to go to battle with him if he doesn‚Äôt. There‚Äôs no more going home the day after the election, the stakes are way too high.
Dude, you just said that "Obama is a idiot". Go back and look at your comments. As far as Joe Biden, I don't give a rat's ass if he chose Roger Rabbit as his VP, I'm voting for him!!

I really like her, so it sucks to have to say this: She‚Äôs not the right choice for this election.   Biden has a shot at the presidency almost solely because of the African-American demographic. They want true representation in office and that needs to happen with a black woman.
No one can believe your lies; Biden &amp; Obama were in the White House eight years (2009-2016) and nothing happen to your guns or the 2nd amendment. It would take a real dumb ass to believe Trump‚Äôs BS.

Biden risks alienating young Black voters after race remarks
As  said on #seeingamerica , she‚Äôs voting for the person she wants to hold accountable. Make no mistake, with Biden‚Äôs well documented affinity to neoliberalism and general conservative disposition on, we‚Äôre going to have to fight like hell to win this battle.
I want Biden to win. But if we think that‚Äôs all it‚Äôll take to correct the fundamental, structural problems this nation faces, you‚Äôd better think again. As Hannah Nicole Jones said on Megan Rapiopnoes new show, Seeing America, her worst fear is people will go home if Biden wins.
Now, predictably, the establishment came together to force in the nation a Bidendy nomination to try and restore the system as it existed before 1/20/17, as Biden proudly proclaims that his only goal as president. And the failure to understand THEY caused Trump continues.
Joe Biden‚Äôs controversial remarks about race this week risk alienating young Black voters who despise President Donald Trump but are not inspired by his Democratic rival.

You think Biden isn't racist? Anyone who says Trump is mentally incompetent, but supports Biden has serious issues (hypocrisy). What did Obama do for black ppl? Trump had lowest black unemployment &amp; undid Bidens law which prisoned more black people way too long. Learn history.
Yeah, right...Russia would rather have a very strong Donald Trump in office rather than a weak, addled, puppet like Joe Biden.  Have a hard time believing that.
Biden is a big supporter of abortion .. this is against the teachings of his church,Strong supporter of same sex marriages,and all this transgender stuff, against the teaching of the church..Had his fingers up in the private parts of a underage girl... he should be horse whipped

I think both push narratives. Also Obama had 8 yrs without any problems. Pelosi and Biden 40-50... so why can‚Äôt Trump have 8? November is around the corner. Vote him out. I will still support your president because at the end of the day I am an American. Peace to you!

What if Trump and Biden are the same bird?
Yes, but she‚Äôs right before Biden. That seems to suggest something. I get letting others speak who might not be chosen, but isn‚Äôt it customary for the VP nominee to basically introduce the presidential nominee?
Biden did not write this, had to his assistant an caregiver that did !!!! LMAO #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver
Just make sure Biden gets to the Debates.
The plandemic.  If Biden wins in November it will quietly fade away.  Who wants to bet it?
Biden and Trump can't even form complete sentences.
Biden? I was talking about Trump. But Biden didn't produce then either. I never said no influence, you can read. President* look I can find typos too Amash is a Libertarian now...
Trump was not very successful. Biden had awful results, you're blind.
Check LP presidential election since 2012 and notice the curve. Biden/Trump have done nothing helpful in more than 24 years. She's a college professor.
Wow.  Biden, Obama, Killary, Pelosi.    The Fraudulent Four.  Corruption at its finest.   You‚Äôve been brainwashed sweetheart
But China wants Biden so bad.  Wonder why?  He‚Äôs a puppet.  They will have full control.
Turn him loose.  Don‚Äôt let Biden skip the debates.
Biden isnt worthy of anybody's vote.What hopefully the majority of American voters will do on (or possibly before) Nov. 3rd, 2020 &amp; will become true when Biden/Harris replace Trump/Pence on Jan. 20, 2021:
If you're a voter in the U.S. staying a live long to say and actually do to cast a ballot against Trump/Pence and for Biden/Harris on or before (if definitely needed) November 3rd, 2020!

That's for Biden
I am voting in person for biden
I think Trump has been cognitively consistent for 4 years. You might say ok, consistently stupid, but still consistent. Biden today compared to Biden 4 years ago seems like there has been somewhat of a decline, he has more trouble finding words, and there is just something else.
Yang, Gabbard, and Buttigieg were the only candidates I had enough respect for to maybe give them a chance against Trump. Right now a vote for Trump is a vote against Biden just like a vote for Biden is a vote against Trump.
Blame the Democrats for giving Yang like 10 seconds of time in the debates and Gabbard even less. Exaggerating, but the reality is that while I plan to vote Trump, I donated to both their campaigns bc they were not far left and also Biden is losing his marbles man.
I mean, if Trump gets 70million and Biden gets 100 it will be obvious
Biden screwed up on VP pick, I can't vote for Kamala. I am opposed to not voting, that is ultimately a vote for the winner. Abstaining only had meaning in parliamentary proceedings. Trump is a jerk and the GOP needs to be punished.  Maybe I go with the Constitution Party.
We will know when Florida counts, if Biden wins FL, Trump is toast.
While this is plausible, #NewHampshire, although very close in 16, has not shown that same inclination in 20. More importantly, the polls out of #Florida have been stubbornly consistent, showing #Biden ahead, comfortably outside margin of error.
Over the next week, Georgia Democrats will pressure Biden to live up to running mate Kamala Harris‚Äô challenge to deliver ‚Äúmore than a victory‚Äù in November by competing in a state that Republicans have carried in every White House vote since 1996. #gapol

Biden released his taxes. Trump should, too. Buzz off, Greta.

This should tell you everything you need to know about Trump's efforts to kill the US Postal Service!! This is authoritarian fascism, pure and simple. Watch the video with the article! #TRE45ON #TraitorTrump #FascismIsHere
Biden is leading in the polls now, according to the media. So if Trump wins, will you assume fraud? And, because of the assumed fraud, would you approve of forcefully removing him from office?
Biden being a guaranteed win was an exaggeration, I assumed that would be obvious since every media outlet shows him in the lead (like they did Hillary in 2016) but if my exaggeration was taken at face value that was not my intent. No media outlets have him at 100% chance.
And yet if Trump wins, every democrat is going to say they are sure it is due to fraud, there could be no other way. And so, of course, it will be important to remove him by force, and install Biden no matter what.
What I find funny about the situation is Dems that simply cannot fathom another legitimate Trump victory. Doesn't matter how much you say that Trump voters are silent until the booth. All they know is what the media tells them, which is Biden is a guaranteed win. It's crazy/sad.
No, he picked Joe Biden. Such delusional poppcock. That and your statement on USPS

Yea so your answer choices don‚Äôt even mention Biden and they are worded in a skewed manner which makes this poll incredibly biased.  This is why people don‚Äôt trust GOP/conservative polls.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm no liberal snowflake‚Äù is by no means an indictment on Biden. You‚Äôre a disgrace

Biden and Kamala gave away the secret.  Authoritarian Government over reach resulting in a totalitarian tyrannical police state
Genuinely curious, what about Biden do you think would classify him as fascist?
I mean what‚Äôs the better approach? I can keep talking about leftist ideas and convincing people I know and online that they‚Äôre the way to go until a revolution/collapse happens and vote Biden to reduce harm in the meantime. Or what? I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a better option
Dictator want to be? Biden and Karen....I mean Kamala want to have a national mandate on mask. There is no Constitutional power to mandate this or enforce it and reeks of fascism
I basically agree with this. But when that system does get torn down, we‚Äôre going to need a new system that‚Äôs better rather than worse. That‚Äôs why we need to keep pushing society left until it happens. If electing Biden is a step left, then I think it‚Äôs one we have to take
Biden better buckle up because he‚Äôs got a big mess to clean up. And the only way to clean up this time is real change. Americans deserve healthcare and to be able to vote from the safety and comfort of our homes! Let Trump close our post office we‚Äôll use our computers finally!

Gave Joe 8 years to bring back jobs and he failed. He was for the Paris agreement that allowed China to pollute the earth at a historical rate. Joe Biden never fixed police violence
You don't have to constantly worry as a news channel that you are going to be broadcasting lies, and potentially life threatening ones, to the public when Biden and Harris are speaking. With Trump it's almost a certainty that it will happen
The Trump people who have been trying to question  competency can't be feeling too confident about how that attack will stick after watching Biden's speech introducing  as his VP pick. Biden's cognitive abilities are significantly better than Trump's
Thank you and I too appreciate the respectful conversation as well! I wish you and your family the best and especially in navigating the school year and hope things go well!
Biden is taking no prisoners..... #SpecialReport #BidenHarris2020
Biden is going in..... I‚Äôm excited to vote for him in November. He‚Äôs serving trump on a platter.
I do have kids (one with asthma) and am enrolling them in a virtual school for this year because I don‚Äôt have confidence the public school systems will be given the proper tools to curb the spread.
I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve learned anything definitive their ability to spread, except maybe they make up a higher % of asymptomatic spreading (i.e GA schools). What we do know is they can‚Äôt spread while learning remote with families following strict social distancing guidelines.
Everybody it's important to always have a sort of healthy fearful caution, if the data says things are getting worse then they are, but if it says they're getting better then the data is wrong  although sneak peek if Biden wins things might get better you'll have to wait and see
I‚Äôm hopeful it‚Äôs less dangerous but I also believe we‚Äôre still too in the infancy of our understanding of COVID to know. Even if it is less dangerous, kids can still spread like everyone else. And I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve taken the proper steps to have the BK employees back either.
Didn‚Äôt say they shut down earlier, they didn‚Äôt. I do believe their shut down restrictions were more strict and enforced which helped get things under ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù. For GA where I live, we shut down and have opened up based on no signs we should have.
Lol. Last time I seen this poll Biden was up by 20 points
You forget that all those countries shut down and took the initial wave of cases seriously, the US did not. It was a coordinated effort to do what was necessary to stop the spread and then open slowly and with restrictions. We never got step 1 right.

Second-greatest day. Seeing him refuse to concede but be ignored after Biden wins in a landslide will be almost as good as seeing him gone from the White House before Jan. 20 because he doesn't want to participate in Biden's inauguration.
Biden represents Obama's legacy, there are enough blacks that will vote for him for him for that reason alone. He doesn't need help there. Kamala is there to appeal to suburban women. And counter Trump's Law and Order message.
Bottoms. Why don‚Äôt you do your job as Mayor of Atlanta and quit worrying about Joe Biden. You‚Äôre responsible for an eight year old females death. If you are so smart and we know you are. Straighten Atlanta out
You overshot your shot, I said I care, I‚Äôm just not hell bent over politics. I know all about BOTH Biden/Kamala, I‚Äôve interviewed them both just like Trump/Pence, though I interviewed VP. Neither has a strategy in place on bettering the US. All have 80+ days to have a plan. üëàüèæ
They both won though. Biden won the D primary and Trump won the R primary. It's not actually big news.
..man, these super deep conservatives/GOP voters are HOTüî• today, not at Biden, b/c he picked a black woman named Kamala Harris as his VP candidate. My blocking game also be HOTüî•as well w/trolls thinking they can throw rocks &amp; hide their hands. I‚Äôm not the one you want! üëèüèæüíØ

I value your opinion so i want to know why Biden is the clear cut favorite for you now that kamala is on board but we can talk about it another day. Maybe you know something i don‚Äôt. So I find it intriguing. It‚Äôs others that feel the same way as you do.

Not only that, but Biden would be the 1st VP to win the White House as President since George H.W. Bush did in 1989.
For all the complaining about leaks, the Biden team picked a VP and staffed up the office without any actual leaks to the media. Not even last minute leaks from the camps of those not chosen. That's impressive.
This is true whether you want Trump to win or not. Biden backed himself into a corner and failed to gain any centrist footing in the process.

Biden did not let emotion fuel his decision. As Trump should know it is good business. Trump is all emotion and makes bad choices because of it
That's impressive; I wouldn't have thought it would be possible to come up with that incoherent a message, but you managed it. What are you trying to say, that Biden's a racist? That he's a cuck and she's a shrew? That they're both commies? Dang, y'all are bad at this.

That's not the genius strategy you think it is, Fredo. People want progressive policy change, especially increasing taxes on rich crooks such as yourself. She's a better candidate in the general than she was in the primary, possibly better than Biden.
As a prosecutor she will be able to debate Trump better than Biden.
People are desperate for an end to chaos. Trump's camp can't describe Biden as boring and mediocre; people would prefer that. So they have to pretend he threatens a worse kind of chaos. It's not going to stick because it's silly on its face, but it's all they've got.

I still believe that the most likely scenario is that Biden's lead in the polls narrows to ~5% by Election Day, and although he wins the popular vote (and I would predict more than Hillary did, maybe 4 instead of 3 million votes) Trump is still re-elected.
Hoping Biden's choice is a big hit and makes Trump jealous, so he dumps Pence for a dollar-store version of Biden's pick.

If Biden won‚Äôt take questions from the press now while trying to win an election...  He sure as hell won‚Äôt answer questions if elected.
Because of the green new deal they decided to run BIden off solar power which only gives him so much time before he needs recharge.  They should consider lithium batteries for longer life so he can take questions.

Biden an anti Israel Presidential candidate, has Hutzpah.On Trumps historic Middle East peace agreement, claiming as VP he laid the ground work. What Biden, Obama did was sell out Israel at the UN! Obstaining on a vote condemning Israel!  Allowing Israel to be called  criminals.
Has there been a time in history, when Presidential, And Vice Presidential candidates, can have a press conference, say anything, with impunity? Biden, Harris are the answer. Make accusations, and leave without taking any questions.
Biden blames Trump for all of the lost lives due to COVID.  So by his rationale, if he had been President and didn‚Äôt close the borders (as he ridiculed Trump for doing) he would have been responsible for 1-2 Million American lives lost!
Has Joe Biden, or Donald Trump for that matter, taken a stance that I‚Äôm not aware of on transitioning children?

Biden wants mask for 3 month. We were right he wants to keep this virus live with mask no matter what so he can stay in basement not answering any questions. #Basement President
I will gripe about Biden  I might even say stuff about Kamala  (Probably not since she is the first smart move Democrats have made this entire election cycle)  But I‚Äôm certainly not voting for more fascism racism and mass death  So vote like lives are on the line because they are
We will see. your known quantity (Biden) doesn‚Äôt know where or who he is. #BLEXIT
There are many more senerios she missed. 1- dems push mail in voting and results are tainted. Leading to dem protest then confrontation with Trump supporters, and basically civil war. 2- Biden wins Trump leaves but half don't accept results and civil war.  Either way, violence.
Exactly. Not even Biden/Harris can tell you how. And they won‚Äôt. They‚Äôre betting on fear mongering for their votes. Not actual solutions. #BLEXIT2020 #BLEXIT
By selecting #KamalaHarris Joe Biden is assured of the Black votes, women's votes, perhaps East Indian votes (after having derided the E. Indian accent of owners of 7-Eleven &amp; gas station managers), may also get the votes of Arab people who have a similar sounding name as Kamal.
Biden appears like he's looking forward to the pudding cup they promised him for showing up.
Still wondering how a person who calls Biden a segregationist,now says he‚Äôs the person to heal the nation.Also wonder how a person who couldn‚Äôt make it to the Dems IA Caucus,now thinks she should be a step away from the Presidency.Wake up America,Or we‚Äôll be Venezuela
Can you translate what Biden was saying? Your candidate loves to fondle children and is a child molester.
And Biden still leading. WTF
Hey  &amp;  so, how will Joe Biden actually enforce the mask mandate &amp; jail people?  They are defunding the police, right?  Great way to continue to spread #Covid_19 : put together in a small space a bunch of people who didn't wear a mask. #halfbaked
All of us #NastyWomenVote and we'll vote for Biden/Harris!
Brett I hope if And when you interview Biden , you treat, and ask him the same very tough questions you asked of Jared Kudhner!
. You have this election in the bag. You‚Äôre only thing that stands between us and four more years of total incompetence. Hopefully this call for a three month mask mandate while OUTDOORS is not a sign of even dumber ideas to follow.
Real question. Asking cuz I‚Äôd like to know. Why is this president so afraid of mail in ballots? If everyone is eligible, why would it be harmful to HIS campaign &amp; not Biden‚Äôs?
People want it to rhyme with Pamela, but that‚Äôs WRONG!   Even Joe Biden sometimes says it Camela.  says it wrong EVERY TIME man! Time to get it right!  Comma-La Karma y‚Äôall.  Kamala isn‚Äôt hard to say. So say it right.
If Biden stays in his basement why do we need masks.
So, Joe Biden wants to FORCE everybody to wear a mask? He sounds like a authoritarian to me...

This whole rumour of Biden‚Äôs dementia and demise is something I only see on Fox News, and even there it is just opinion people saying they have heard this from unnamed sources. To me it smells like Fox trying to start a rumour to aid Trump in the election.
I agree. There are so many more, and clearer, reasons to object to her and the Biden/Harris ticket.
Why is it totally OK if Biden (HER RUNNING MATE) mangles her name but you find it offensive if a conservative host, without malice, mispronounces it?  You clowns in the biased media are the disrespectful.
So TwitLer is just going to let Joe Biden lie and do nothing about it? Interesting.  But think about it: If TwitLer corrects this PROVABLE lie, then it will expose the MSM and Left for constantly repeating this, and we know TwitLER won't do anything to upset the Left.

I do have kids (one with asthma) and am enrolling them in a virtual school for this year because I don‚Äôt have confidence the public school systems will be given the proper tools to curb the spread.
links you directly to Joe Biden‚Äôs page. If Biden wins Soros and anarchy win. It will be the downfall of America
I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve learned anything definitive their ability to spread, except maybe they make up a higher % of asymptomatic spreading (i.e GA schools). What we do know is they can‚Äôt spread while learning remote with families following strict social distancing guidelines.
I‚Äôm hopeful it‚Äôs less dangerous but I also believe we‚Äôre still too in the infancy of our understanding of COVID to know. Even if it is less dangerous, kids can still spread like everyone else. And I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve taken the proper steps to have the BK employees back either.
Didn‚Äôt say they shut down earlier, they didn‚Äôt. I do believe their shut down restrictions were more strict and enforced which helped get things under ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù. For GA where I live, we shut down and have opened up based on no signs we should have.
Yeah, ummm....this election is &lt;12 weeks away. People are vastly overestimating the chance of some massive overhaul happening
You were saying,
You forget that all those countries shut down and took the initial wave of cases seriously, the US did not. It was a coordinated effort to do what was necessary to stop the spread and then open slowly and with restrictions. We never got step 1 right.
The fact that you see Biden/Harris as worse than Trump/Pence is instructive. For many of us, Trump‚Äôs moral, temperamental, ethical and mental unfitness for office represents an unacceptable risk to the republic and outweighs any other consideration.
Fact check... Clinton (and Biden) were the DIRECT catalyst for Mass Incarcerations.

Because, Biden is much better for this country than Trump is.
And in the mean time you are helping trump win reelection. You are helping RBG to be replaced by a right wing nut job. Biden wasnt my first choice either but he's my ride or die now because the next president will either be biden or trump.

Biden/Harris is the ticket of austerity and foreign provocations. There will be the usual miserable moaning( 'there is no money for social programs') as the defense budget steadily climbs.
This suburban "housewife" will be voting for Joe Biden as will the other three people in my family.

Interesting. No, really. Something to keep banging the drum on. I am also concerned about these republican "allies". However, I have more faith in Biden.
The whole Tara Reade thing self-imploded without Biden doing a thing. We're supposed to give the accuser the benefit of the doubt. I believed Reade too until all her lies and grifts came out. No one has yet to prove that Trump's 2 dozenl0 accusers were lying.
Glad to vote against him. Now, who had more blacks incarcerated in the US, Kamala Harris or Joe Biden?
She's literally willing to throw away what little rights she has left, and for what? Trump has been systematically removing every right gained under Obama/Biden &amp; yet she seems to be okay with that. If he gets to stack SCOTUS, it's all over, &amp; again, she's apparently ok with that
Its interesting how these anti-Kamala and anti-Biden replies always blow up while its the middle of the night in the US. Putin's scared.
Historic wisdom states that people do not vote based on the bottom of the ticket. I don‚Äôt think that holds true for this election. I was voting for  but I do feel better with  on the ticket. It shows that Biden respects her knowledge despite differences.
Want some truth? Harris went after Biden and he didn't go all fragile, male ego, snowflaking on a podium over it. He decided she should be a voice in his campaign and his government. Gee, imagine that. Y'all might want to man up &amp; see if it's possible for you to grow some balls
I honestly don‚Äôt see a Biden victory after the Harris pick.
Biden represents Obama's legacy, there are enough blacks that will vote for him for him for that reason alone. He doesn't need help there. Kamala is there to appeal to suburban women. And counter Trump's Law and Order message.

She was def the best candidate for presidency,  i predicted this from day 1. Too bad Biden will get slain in a debate. He doesn't represent the party. Party should run the best candidate that represents the following, Good night sleepy Joe, Landslide , good night!
Biden should have picked Tulsi.  Then I would have been worried.  Not so much now.  Either way,  is the winner.

Just from my short time living in Georgia it's wild. I've legit seen Biden stuff in Alpharetta. Not a *lot*, but damn sure more than I ever expected before moving out here with my preconceived notions.
Kamala Harris challenged Joe Biden in a debate and made him a better man. Rather than hold a grudge, he picked her as his running mate. This tells a lot about the man Joe Biden is - together they will make this country proud. I just contributed to their campaign. #BidenHarris2020

Don‚Äôt forget that Kamala is a Law &amp; Order VP. Something  knows nothing about. I know Biden will pick a real Attorney General.
This is a big deal. I want to be in a Democratic Party where candidates aren‚Äôt afraid to be challenged on their record, including on race issues.  The fact that Biden chose Harris after their conflict during debates signals that we are a party committed to reflection and growth.
It's kinda weird.  was not my pick among Dem Presidential candidates. But she was my #1 pick for Biden's VP. She checks all the boxes. Great pick!
You‚Äôre so inspiring. I had hoped it was you, but will show up to do my part for Team Biden in November.
Biden did not let emotion fuel his decision. As Trump should know it is good business. Trump is all emotion and makes bad choices because of it
If you claim you‚Äôre anti-trump but the first thing you did when Biden announced his VP pick is find dirt on Kamala Harris, you‚Äôre not anti-trump.
I don‚Äôt know how anyone who is serious about police reform could possibly vote for a Biden/Harris ticket. He wrote and she enforced the laws that led to mass incarceration of black men.   Jo Jorgensen is an option.
She has accused Biden of being a racist, said she believes his accusers(sexual harassment)-in addition to her filthy war on poor people while DA. What a great pick üòÇ

Since 2016? How many women aborted for him? He used to be pro-choice until he decided to hijack the Republican Party. He has no values, no political ideology. The guy is simply playing Americans. Biden is a better Christian
Please. We are between a rock and a hard place. Trump is the hardest place. As a Sanders supporter, I beg you, make that choice for Biden because I fear that we may not have another chance. üò∞üëäüôèüí™
This exactly. Harris isn't perfect, but she's a whole lot better than pretty much all our other options atm, and she sure af is better than keeping our current president in office. And even Biden is better than what we have now. Not by much, but still.

If Biden is elected what is the over/under number of moths before the 25th amendment is invoked? I say 6.
Not Biden.
I mean, Biden is racist so.... that‚Äôs where it stops for me. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

That's for Biden
No, you are an idiot for blindly believing deplorable unethical trump. Biden and Harris are a great team!
I don't know any vets supporting Biden either, especially combat vets..  Just because you made it through basic and got med boarded from AIT doesn't mean you have bragging rights...ü§£  There is alot of stolen Valor, and POGs acting like they were in a ranger bat...
Biden screwed up on VP pick, I can't vote for Kamala. I am opposed to not voting, that is ultimately a vote for the winner. Abstaining only had meaning in parliamentary proceedings. Trump is a jerk and the GOP needs to be punished.  Maybe I go with the Constitution Party.
Very well said, Biden doesn't have the balls to stand up to violent protesters, rioters, or looters, and why in the world would you want to defund the police? They are the ones protecting us and keeping violent criminals and drugs out our neighborhoods.
Believe me. Biden/Harris would consider this.
I‚Äôm staying right here and FIGHTING for this country!!! Fuck them!
I wonder what "Favor" she gave Biden in return for him choosing her....I bet we can all guess

What if Biden has picked Michelle Obama to be VP? That would have put Barack back in the White House as the VP First Gentleman !DOPE!
Biden released his taxes. Trump should, too. Buzz off, Greta.
If Biden won‚Äôt take questions from the press now while trying to win an election...  He sure as hell won‚Äôt answer questions if elected.
Because of the green new deal they decided to run BIden off solar power which only gives him so much time before he needs recharge.  They should consider lithium batteries for longer life so he can take questions.

And YOUR party makes a MOCKERY of ALL Americans and of the country, itself, in forcing a demented old man in Biden on us like we‚Äôre all too stupid to see it.
Biden asking to ware mask but nothing about Distancing. Because he wants to make sure the Rioters and looters face cover but still can burn and steal.
Biden wants mask for 3 month. We were right he wants to keep this virus live with mask no matter what so he can stay in basement not answering any questions. #Basement President
There are many more senerios she missed. 1- dems push mail in voting and results are tainted. Leading to dem protest then confrontation with Trump supporters, and basically civil war. 2- Biden wins Trump leaves but half don't accept results and civil war.  Either way, violence.
Biden appears like he's looking forward to the pudding cup they promised him for showing up.
Still wondering how a person who calls Biden a segregationist,now says he‚Äôs the person to heal the nation.Also wonder how a person who couldn‚Äôt make it to the Dems IA Caucus,now thinks she should be a step away from the Presidency.Wake up America,Or we‚Äôll be Venezuela
Biden better buckle up because he‚Äôs got a big mess to clean up. And the only way to clean up this time is real change. Americans deserve healthcare and to be able to vote from the safety and comfort of our homes! Let Trump close our post office we‚Äôll use our computers finally!

I saw Joe Biden on a couple of episodes of Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego on YouTube.  Your friend Barbara Bush was on another episode of that show.

I agree. There are so many more, and clearer, reasons to object to her and the Biden/Harris ticket.
So TwitLer is just going to let Joe Biden lie and do nothing about it? Interesting.  But think about it: If TwitLer corrects this PROVABLE lie, then it will expose the MSM and Left for constantly repeating this, and we know TwitLER won't do anything to upset the Left.

I got a theory Trump told Kanye to run for President so he could take away some black votes from Biden.. Politics is one big ass scheme.
I see the hate Biden campaign program is shaping up. It is hilarious, though, that the Cultists latch onto an imaginary defect while ignoring Trump‚Äôs obvious mental deficiencies.
I was going to say (taking nothing away from Joe Biden, who does look presidential), so would most of us compared to the moron in the WH.
At least Kanye still has his mind!  In actually feel sorry for Biden.  His handlers are abusing him on the National stage and it‚Äôs recognized as some kind of normal.  SMH
You don't have to constantly worry as a news channel that you are going to be broadcasting lies, and potentially life threatening ones, to the public when Biden and Harris are speaking. With Trump it's almost a certainty that it will happen
The Trump people who have been trying to question  competency can't be feeling too confident about how that attack will stick after watching Biden's speech introducing  as his VP pick. Biden's cognitive abilities are significantly better than Trump's

I do have kids (one with asthma) and am enrolling them in a virtual school for this year because I don‚Äôt have confidence the public school systems will be given the proper tools to curb the spread.
I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve learned anything definitive their ability to spread, except maybe they make up a higher % of asymptomatic spreading (i.e GA schools). What we do know is they can‚Äôt spread while learning remote with families following strict social distancing guidelines.
I‚Äôm hopeful it‚Äôs less dangerous but I also believe we‚Äôre still too in the infancy of our understanding of COVID to know. Even if it is less dangerous, kids can still spread like everyone else. And I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve taken the proper steps to have the BK employees back either.
Wait... is he campaigning for Biden now?
Didn‚Äôt say they shut down earlier, they didn‚Äôt. I do believe their shut down restrictions were more strict and enforced which helped get things under ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù. For GA where I live, we shut down and have opened up based on no signs we should have.
You were saying,
You forget that all those countries shut down and took the initial wave of cases seriously, the US did not. It was a coordinated effort to do what was necessary to stop the spread and then open slowly and with restrictions. We never got step 1 right.
We are ALL IN Joe Biden! LET'S GO! BIDEN/HARRIS IN 2020!
What I'm confused a out is why these idiots seem to think Joe Biden will not be able to complete his term??? I'm mean if the lard ass, fast food never does a day of exercise ,can't walk down a ramp unassisted, or hold a glass of freakin water can manage! Biden will be FINE

Biden didn‚Äôt select Kamala fat left told him to pick her since she is real far left. Remember she said she wants to destroy Second Addendum  in first hundred days.
And in the mean time you are helping trump win reelection. You are helping RBG to be replaced by a right wing nut job. Biden wasnt my first choice either but he's my ride or die now because the next president will either be biden or trump.
TFW  gets to debate Joe Biden.
So Biden is better on economy?
I honestly don‚Äôt see how someone can vote for Biden especially with Harris. Moreover, taking polls at face value is a fools game.
The Democratic base is getting stronger and wiser. And now with the Democratic ticket of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and ALL of the EXPERIENCE they each bring, we are NOW ENERGIZED! It may be a difficult race, BUT IN THE END WE WILL WIN!
So Biden gets more than 400 EVs?
There are now hundreds, if not thousands of people on my facebook, who are both Biden and Trump supporters. While I asked Trump supporters to NOT COMMENT because my facebook is a site to support Biden/Harris 2020 only, they still felt the need to comment. RESPECT MUST BE EARNED!

Historic wisdom states that people do not vote based on the bottom of the ticket. I don‚Äôt think that holds true for this election. I was voting for  but I do feel better with  on the ticket. It shows that Biden respects her knowledge despite differences.
I honestly don‚Äôt see a Biden victory after the Harris pick.
Biden represents Obama's legacy, there are enough blacks that will vote for him for him for that reason alone. He doesn't need help there. Kamala is there to appeal to suburban women. And counter Trump's Law and Order message.

Haha pop your Sh√¨t! Kamala put Biden over the top now huh?? Why is that because she suppose to be a sister or because she actually did or plan to do something to help benefit black ppl?
Brilliant.  In Biden‚Äôs own words...
For all the complaining about leaks, the Biden team picked a VP and staffed up the office without any actual leaks to the media. Not even last minute leaks from the camps of those not chosen. That's impressive.
Yikes.  This can‚Äôt help their relationship...
This is true whether you want Trump to win or not. Biden backed himself into a corner and failed to gain any centrist footing in the process.

They changed it to Slow Joe for some reason. Cue infinite footage of Trump creeping down a ramp and Biden jogging up it.
As far as I can follow, Kamala is a racist because she called out Biden for being a racist and now she's a phony because she's sucking up to a racist. The whiplash between pretending racism doesn't exist and calling people racists really has to drive up their chiropractor bills.
Kamala Harris challenged Joe Biden in a debate and made him a better man. Rather than hold a grudge, he picked her as his running mate. This tells a lot about the man Joe Biden is - together they will make this country proud. I just contributed to their campaign. #BidenHarris2020

She‚Äôs no joke, she just thinks Biden supports segregation, believes he sexually assaulted those women, oh and she was smoking weed in college while listening to Tupac and Snoop, despite graduating at least 6 years before either released their first album.
Thank God Biden didn't chose Bottoms maybe now she'll take care of Atlanta as she elected to do. However in my opinion I doubt she will

Don‚Äôt forget that Kamala is a Law &amp; Order VP. Something  knows nothing about. I know Biden will pick a real Attorney General.
This is a big deal. I want to be in a Democratic Party where candidates aren‚Äôt afraid to be challenged on their record, including on race issues.  The fact that Biden chose Harris after their conflict during debates signals that we are a party committed to reflection and growth.
Biden was only able to pick one candidate. Not everyone is going to be happy.   Please remember ...  When #ResistersUnite  We grow #StrongerTogether  United as #OneVoice1  Committed to #VoteBlueNoMatterWho  And to #FlipTheSenateBlue  #BidenHarris2020

But when majority of voters don‚Äôt think Biden will finish a first term, it‚Äôs a play that could work.
Biden did not let emotion fuel his decision. As Trump should know it is good business. Trump is all emotion and makes bad choices because of it
That's impressive; I wouldn't have thought it would be possible to come up with that incoherent a message, but you managed it. What are you trying to say, that Biden's a racist? That he's a cuck and she's a shrew? That they're both commies? Dang, y'all are bad at this.
When you start leading the American people by wearing your mask consistently and daily, let us know. Otherwise, pay attention to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to see what REAL LEADERSHIP looks like. Compared to your record, a 2 year old could win! LOSER IN CHIEF/BUNKER BABY!
That's not the genius strategy you think it is, Fredo. People want progressive policy change, especially increasing taxes on rich crooks such as yourself. She's a better candidate in the general than she was in the primary, possibly better than Biden.
As a prosecutor she will be able to debate Trump better than Biden.
People are desperate for an end to chaos. Trump's camp can't describe Biden as boring and mediocre; people would prefer that. So they have to pretend he threatens a worse kind of chaos. It's not going to stick because it's silly on its face, but it's all they've got.
LMAO!!! You sound scared as hell!!! #BidenHarris2020 #Biden #Kamala
Proposed: Make the second of the three debates Prez vs. VP. Biden-Pence would put everyone to sleep, but Trump-Harris would be something you'd record and burn onto DVD.
I am definitely voting for Biden/Harris...we need to move on from the caveman mentality!
Since 2016? How many women aborted for him? He used to be pro-choice until he decided to hijack the Republican Party. He has no values, no political ideology. The guy is simply playing Americans. Biden is a better Christian
This exactly. Harris isn't perfect, but she's a whole lot better than pretty much all our other options atm, and she sure af is better than keeping our current president in office. And even Biden is better than what we have now. Not by much, but still.
Dang, Biden announces his VP pick, and almost immediately I see people who aren‚Äôt happy with it being told they need to fall in line. The Democratic party isn‚Äôt owed the progressive vote, y‚Äôall.
You were never going to vote for Biden anyway. Sit all the way down.
End of the day. We have to be on they side anyway. Our lives will be better with her and Biden
Desperate Trump...  I bet Biden knows that the 2nd world war ended in 1945.. #thickasshit

And he lied his way through it.  How about Anita Hill and how he treated her?  "Poor kids are just as smart as white kids"
Again, What about all the lying Biden has done his entire career?  Just going to ignore that question?  You would eat a turd sandwich from Biden and tell him how good it tastes.  You are being played!!!  And too stupid to know any better.
So you are conveniently ignoring Biden's history of lies?  Instead, try to deflect and bring up Trump.  Biden has a history of lying.  He does the same things you don't like about Trump.  And Biden also avoided service in Vietnam.  Just doesn't get pushed by the media.
What? Joe Biden lie? You tell me.
Funny you mention Joe Biden and lies together.  Yeah, he is the paragon of truth, NOT.    People just want to overlook his lies now.  Forced him out of a Presidential primary in the past over his lies.  Now, he is the "savior" of the Democrats.  Shows you how low they have sunk.
2032.  Biden for 4, Kamala for 8, AOC for 8.   has the heart and wisdom....but not enough experience---yet.  #TrumpFailedAmerica
Is it not as obvious to you as it is to me that he just really DOES NOT WANT TO BE ELECTED? Come on!! Biden is trying to throw this ... he wants out. #duh #byebye #begone
I'm amazed at those who tout Joe Biden and his political record as getting back to 'normal' politics.
The hamfistedness and incompetence is nowhere on display better than openly signaling they're doing this now, giving Biden and the Democrats nearly 3 months to counter the strategy. Trump should really ask his boss Vlad for some more subtle election rigging strategies.
Exactly. It‚Äôs literally the same exact quote Harris used when commenting on Biden‚Äôs racism. the quote you two said was her saying he wasn‚Äôt racist. You know, the original point of this whole thread. Thanks for affirming.
Democrats don't want Joe Biden out campaigning because he'll be sniffing your daughters.
Ah but your good friend and a great guy Robin Williams told the truth about Biden so shame on you for twisting the story.
And how many morons think Biden is even aware of what is going on?  He is still waiting to see who he names as his VP candidate.

Boy who else is excited for Cop-ala Harris as VP.  What a pick in the summer were we are talking about police reform, Biden chooses somebody who put many into the system.
They shouldn't. I would, however, like a bishop to tell Biden he can't call himself Catholic anymore.
It'd be fun to see if they would fall for something like "Biden is considering dark horse candidate State Sen. Judith Zaffirini for veep to reach out to the Hispanic community."
Hypocritical to demand a particular race or gender.  Black male leaders warn Biden ‚Äòwill lose‚Äô election if he doesn't name Black female running mate

Hunter Biden: MIA?!? What the HELLO?!?
My opinion only! How dare ‚ÄúBiden‚Äù place ‚Äúhis ‚Äú election on Ms. Harris ! In my view she should be running for office not a weak bitty man. Sorry Biden that‚Äôs just the way ‚ÄúI‚Äùfeel... you thank we don‚Äôt see what your pulling you need to have a talk with your Boss ‚ÄúPresident Obama.
Please vote early so you can‚Äôt see Biden and Harris‚Äô dumbfuckery on displayüòÇ
Biden/Harris not taking questions because they don‚Äôt have original plan on Covid 19. They copied and trying to take credit and blame Trump and lied. They framed their attacks well, though. Most people are smart enough to see through the lies.
I‚Äôm sure hose who forced her onto Biden will cover it!
Mr Biden can you explain your policy?? Nope no questions today folks just bullshit platitudes for the base!!!!
Vote for Biden‚Äìif you‚Äôre racist.

To those people who say they are surprised that Biden picked Kamala after the way she went after him during the debates I say that speaks to his character, that he's able to overlook personal grievances to do what's best for the country!
Biden is entering the ‚Äúracial jungle.‚Äù #KampalaHarris
Harris destroys the ticket. She‚Äôs a bigger joke than Biden. Farewell, Democrats!
Trump will win for sure. No one likes Kamala. She has already been rejected by her own party for President. Biden will have to step down for mental incompetence so she‚Äôs who they‚Äôre pushing to run the country.
Democratic Party said Bernie couldn‚Äôt win cause Trump would say he Radical Left...Now he doing it with Biden and Kamala lol....We tried to tell y‚Äôall that they would spew that regardless

I just thought you were quoting things you don‚Äôt like about Trump. You want to talk about Trump‚Äôs mental state but Biden is truly in the throes of an actual mental breakdown. We all know it. It‚Äôs sad.
Just like Joe Biden ‚Äúslipped‚Äù about Obama‚Äôs new view on gay marriage. Calculated.
Funny how you analyze every single word he says, looking for a mistake. Yet Joe Biden speaks nothing but mistakes and you ignore it completely. You people are a joke.
Exactly.  whiffed on the perfect set-up today when he didn‚Äôt zing her about the fact that Biden will need the questions prior to the debate!!
