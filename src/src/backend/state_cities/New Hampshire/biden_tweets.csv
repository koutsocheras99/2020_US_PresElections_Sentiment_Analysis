Is Ron Johnson, a US Senator in cahoots with the Russians to help steal the election for Trump, by trying to discredit Joe Biden, where the F*CK is the FBI? This is the United States if true Ron Johnson is a piece of 💩. #GOPComplicitTraitors
Instagram claims “bug” favored Donald Trump over Joe Biden  #Facebook #Election2020
Why is it that all you tweets now reference Joe Biden in one form or another.... scared ? Desperate ? Or as I think .... Both! Your time pretending to be something you’re clearly not up too is coming to a close
You probably heard about Joe Biden within the last year. He has been in office close to 50. He along with others are flat out dismissive of black voters. Remember he said Obama was different-he was clean and articulate. CLEAN? Joe cares nothing about blacks
Well she is 80. Trump/Biden shouldn’t be running this country either in their mid 70’s but I digress.
Trump is racist. But as VP....you can’t say that. Sounds like Biden has moved on from her and I hope that’s true.
With everything that is going on, trying to chill with my coffee. Listening to Stevie Nick's music, was thinking about the election and Trump. And this is what came on... And I saw Trump's reflection in a snow covered hill Until a LANDSLIDE brought it down. Smile. Vote Biden.
I enjoy mocking Trump as much as anyone but I just can't get behind the "thighland" thing.  He simply misspoke and quickly corrected himself. Not unlike when Biden recently misspoke and said "millions" when he meant "thousands" and immediately corrected his mistake.
I feel bad for her, but our Country had 'high grade' depression for eight long years during #Obama / #Biden. Stagnant economy Poor race relations Increased government dependency etc...
According to Trump today, Joe Biden wants to “hurt God”. Are we living in a Shin Megami Tensei game and I’m just now figuring it out?   Also, Biden... if you need another member for the party I’m IN.
I've been more and more thinking I like  .  Hey, if anyone in the Biden campaign is listening, Duckworth is a good choice.
I agree. I will not exhale until I see Biden's hand on that bible, reciting the oath of office.
We are ...trying to take guns away and there are court case going on right now with Obama gate, Biden, Sonos, Clinton's, etc...
When Biden is safely inaugurated we can all sit back and breathe a collective sigh of relief. But then we have to get right to work to repair the damage Trump inflicted.
That can’t be right how can Biden choose Rice.  What a ticket of half wits.
This just in Trump claims if elected Biden plans to peg God
I think that’s bullshit...... I wouldn’t be shocked at 35-40% but 50% seems a bit much given how he’s dealt with protests and Covid. He’s a horrible human being and Ild like to think anyone with a brain would vote for Biden.
#joebiden accidentally says what all Liberals think!! Watch !!  Biden raises eyebrows with remark contrasting African American, Latino diversity  #FoxNews
"I'm not trying to proselytize, I'm not trying to convince you to be, to share my religious views. For me it ...gives me some reason to have hope and purpose," Biden said to grieving pastor who'd lost his wife  you mean this Godly man?
He talks about Joe Biden yet he can’t finish one damn sentence
As much as I would despise a President Biden, I will NOT Vote for Trump should he not “recognize our right to Vape flavored eliquid”. I am sick of state/federal interference of our personal rights and our freedoms as Americans. #TrumpMustAct
#Unemployment #Pandemic #CorruptPoliticians #coronavirus #AgendaPolicies #Ignorance #Hatred  #carelessness #Elections #Economy #Trump #Biden #OldWhiteMen Is it a wonder we’re all #Fucked?
Biden has a lot of experience with that his whole family are on drugs Usually you say what is true about yourself so maybe we should stop calling him senile &amp; call him a COKEHEAD Cocaine overdose may result in brain damage That explains everything 👎😀🇺🇸
Whoa! How does he get a pass on his racist babble? We really have had a first-hand look into the mind of Biden of the past few months.
Because democrats know they’re not really nominating Joe Biden. Their nominating his VP pick. I’m calling it now. Shortly after getting into office if he wins he will resign it’s something will happen where he has to leave office.
Gee, I thought you #nhdems would be bragging about the #Diversity of Hispanics like #CrookedJoe Biden did today. #nhpolitics
Does anyone really believe that Joe Biden is the face of abolition of police and seizure of guns?
Allan Lichtman has predicted the winner of every election since 1984 predicts Biden... So there's that lol
Wait...Biden is black???🤔
Shit, Joe Biden's that powerful? I'd be afraid to vote AGAINST him in that case
The Biden strategy: throw a few staff in last minute, &amp; pump out bad ads to try fool voters.   has been here for a year.  820k voters contacts later... we’ve been persuading voters &amp; building the infrastructure to *actually turn them out to vote*.   #nhpolitics
Not required to release your taxes to become President. Trump didn’t “get away with” anything like moron Bill Kristin (smarter than the rest of us) writes. #CrookedJoe Biden is senile &amp;  now comes the excuses for not debating Trump.  Plan now is fraud mail-in voting #nhpolitics
🆘 If this stupidity actually does happen&amp; Social Workers are sent to Domestic Disturbances , Hostage Situations,etc.Are the purveyors of this “Woke”action prepared for the body count &amp; wounds that these folks potentially face.
Val Demmings, former police chief so Biden can say he is law &amp; order while fellow #dems burn down America, Demmings also helps in FL &amp; not as dumb as Bass, Rice, Duckworth...
I can relate to this #CrookedJoe Biden ad. I/we’ve been repeatedly lied to by #dems about everything. #Immigration #Obamacare #Iran...when have #dems told America the truth? #nhpolitics #tcot #tlot
I never would have thought it but that’s the man of steel. Does anyone think that Biden could handle that? Ofcourse, the Dems won’t do that to him nor would the Republicans stoop so low. #Trump2020Landslide
The picture is of Biden praying in the AME church in Charleston where he went to mark the anniversary of the massacre of 9 people at a Bible Study. But to the Trump minions, that's a sign of weakness.  Also - note the comments asserting Biden is senile? Russian-driven nonsense.
Why must Biden be so combative? This certainly isn't the first time he escalated a relatively benign question into full on confrontation.   He would be well served to remain as calm &amp; composed as often as possible to highlight the distinction between him and Trump.
Planned because Democrats know Joe Biden cannot debate.  He can't  even get one sentence out without stumbling and mixing words up.
Biden's campaign should set the debates to only 3 with a condition. Trump must release his tax returns. If a week prior to the 1st debate, the tax returns are not released, that debate is cancelled. 1 week prior to the next debate, if the returns are not released, cancelled etc.
He is a prime example of what drinking can do to your brain Donald Trump should play the commercial with the egg frying in the pan Show the egg this is Trump Then crack it in the pan this is Biden LOL 👎😀🇺🇸
Its NOT a weapon.  I want to make sure this man is mentally competent.  A bad choice by Biden may lead to to terrible consequences for our kids and grandkids in the future.
Susan Rice &amp; Joe Biden will be OOMPA LOOMPA &amp; DOOMPA DUMMEE 👎😀🇺🇸
Joe Biden couldn't interview himself, he'd get into an argument.
EXACTLY!!!  The Democrats have something up their sleeve. They’re not gonna put Biden out there and risk losing the election
From when Obama was president!!  Biden will make it great again.  Guess what?  They don't have Twitter in prison!!!
Like everywhere else in the country, in the more rural areas of the state, Trump definitely has more, but in the more urban areas, (here that would be cities like Manchester and Nashua), it’s more split, with Biden having a few more.  At least from my observations
I like your optimism about New Hampshire, but as one who lives just over the border from there, I see an awful lot of Biden signs up there. Signs are split pretty evenly between him and Trump.
Just heard that Joe Biden will not accept the nomination in Milwaukee and it sounds like Donald Trump won't accept the nomination in Charlotte and/or Jacksonville. Hot take: in 2024, one of the parties will just hold their convention in front of a green screen
Even Robin Williams knew Biden wasn't all there back then!!!
Once again Biden lies and gets caught....
Is it bad I didn't even know Biden for VP for 8 years?
Hey Bob....it’s not that hard to watch the video that was PROVIDED FOR YOU  You didn’t have to “google” anything....just watch it for yourself  Can you think for yourself??  Or are you a mini-Biden??
..The only way Biden wins the election is through massive voting fraud. He's not engaging, he's displaying signs of dementia and doesn't know where he is half the time.....Americans see this...

Many MANY of us are scared to death over Trump. The only thing scarier is Biden. Will there ever be another worthy candidate? No one out there is any good at all. No one!
If Biden wins the tone of coverage will change on covid. The science won't change but you'll see more optimistic outlooks on it
You’re comparing winning millions of dollars... to a voting for a guy who will neither put millions in your pocket or give a shit about you. Regardless if it’s Biden or Trump. Terrible tweet/comparison.
Biden should also stop listening to old white racists and just pick a black woman, any black woman for his VP, now! Kamala, Susan, Kiesha, it doesn't matter. The WS will squeal like pigs no matter who it is.
No way. Get Biden out of the basement
When, and it will happen, Biden debates Trump and he comes off as competent, coherent, and prepared (and yes, occasionally tongue-tied) a bunch of the Trump supporters who have never actually heard Joe speak are going to be asking themselves why they were pushing for more debates
I’m sick and tired of this idea that we have to pick a side. My sister likes Trump and her AR-15. She’s gonna teach my daughter to shoot it.  Nothing you or the internet or Trump or Biden ever tells me will overcome my 42 years of living and seeing how good and kind she is.
You know who is stupid? #CrookedJoe Biden.
This tweet was not meant for you...it’s for normal people that understand that a system that makes us choose between Trump and Biden is broken. If you don’t understand why Biden is ultimately no better than Trump, it’s because you’re not questioning enough. Have a nice day.
I know someone who talks about how "dumb" Joe Biden is, because he disagrees with the ideas/positions/proposals. Conversely, this is demonstration of a spectacular level of incompetence on basic logic. As  you need to 'get it' more than this.  is great
Biden has interviews, not as many as Trump, but he's not POTUS.   But you probably rely on the doctored videos and chatter about his senility. That's fake news.   I encourage you to watch Biden for a complete conversation. He may not be a smooth speaker but he's coherent. Really.
Disappointing not being able to discern between a Racist and a Fascist.  I agree Trump is a Fascist and a Racist. And Joe Biden....I don't believe to be Racist..that's good.  But excuse me, make no mistake when it comes to economics.....He is a Fascist.  Economics 101   🐂 or 🐻
Making a mountain out of a molehill, I see...  Look, Biden could choose Socko the Sock Puppet, and I'd still vote for him. This is a non-issue.  #BidenSocko2020
I think the return of the Covid briefings are helping, too. And I think people  are getting a little nervous about Biden the more they learn about him and his positions, and the more the civil unrest continues. Anything can happen now.  It’s a toss-up at this point.
I still have to give the edge to Biden in the #PresidentialElection,  but Trump has certainly narrowed the gap.  Battleground state polls are tightening.  The change in leadership at the top of the campaign has seemed to help; more serious, focused relevant messaging
Biden opted out of  the "best choice" when he announced it will be a woman, then a black woman. By that I mean he took a pool of dozens if not more of qualified individuals and narrowed it  down to 5-6. Their top quality, woman and black. A bit racist and dumb
Why not. The Democratic nominee has two criteria for his Vice President. A woman, and a black  woman. So he is picking a vo because -1- she's a woman and 2- A black woman....sound racist but no...not when Joe Biden says it..
No, hit pieces because they are being considered for VP. Why are they being considered? Because they are woman, and black. Sound racist? Sure does but it's ok that is what Joe Biden says.
First presidential like decision he limitis his VP choice to less than 10 % of population...but it is better to be politically correct.   Biden Campaign Says He Is So Close To A VP Pick He Can Smell Her  via

Please do Joe Biden next? Let’s see how keen an intellect he has-( what’s left of it)
Biden hasn’t been in front of this many in his entire campaign-
Biden hasn’t been in front of that many in total this campaign-
As the polls settle in Biden's favor, Democrats refuse to be optimistic. We need to stay alert and keep working, but we should also stop punishing ourselves for jinxing Hillary in 2016.
And Trump is the one who would lie in a debate? Biden is about as dishonest as they come
I don’t want ‘debates’. Not because I worry about Biden, but because I don’t think they’re valuable, and it’s just more airtime for Trump.
I hope someone from Biden’s campaign say they are going to take the “whine” away from the President!
🆘 IMO,RBG is hanging on in the hopes Joe Biden wins the Presidential Election . If so she will leave SCOTUS so Biden can appoint a LIBERAL Justice. Then Biden will follow up &amp; try the FDR tactic  to “Pack the Supreme Court”  ✅🇺🇸
Exactly they show chains on a pick up truck &amp; then Biden getting into a group of Black people &amp; starts talking about attacking a black person with a chain how ridiculous is that &amp; how obviously guilty of who he hangs around with we should call him KKK Joe 👎😀🇺🇸
Take pictures of the “Made in China” tag. My brother turned a guy into a potential Biden voter over it the other day after using it as a starting point for their conversation.
Well don't forget #JoeBiden brother. In fact we should do a complete investigation of EVERYONE close to #JoeBiden.  Perhaps a past 30 year in depth review of all Biden's family, friends, and big campaign contributors is in order. I've got a feelng people close to Joe get rich!
You cannot be serious? With all the pressure not to debate Biden has to. But thanks for the laugh
This from a person who is going to vote for Biden.
So Senate control may well come down to #MEsen. There's only been 2 public polls taken of that race, and in those, Gideon holds a 45% to 40.5% lead on Collins on average. Given that Biden is gonna win Maine decisively and that Collins isn't clearing Trump's share of support...
RE: #NCsen. The last 4 polls of the race (taken from 7/7 to 7/31) show Cunningham up 49.3%-39.8% on average, and he's outperforming Biden across the board. Looking more like a "Lean D" race atm, which combined with AZ and CO would get Ds to 49 Senate seats...
Biden wins N.Carolina. Think Trump wins Georgia by SLIMMEST of margins. Maybe 10,000.
Yes we will, by voting for Joe Biden. #TrumpVirus

Biden wants either her or Susan Rice  The DNC wants Rep Bass!   That’s what the friction is. Biden’s “choice” vs what the DNC wants!
Joe Biden 2020 for president❤️❤️❤️
Just like you, I don't know shit about Biden's VP list...but I don't claim to know, so there's that...lol
Dems need to win the Senate. President Biden then adds 2 seats to SCOTUS. Leader Schumer invokes the nuclear option to confirm. Problem solved.
Wouldn't it be poetic justice if  became Biden's SecDef?!

They’re going to do second waves of shutdowns around election season because they want to make sure Trump and Biden don’t get to have a 1v1 debate, I see trump losing this election season because of that reason. May the best candidate win #positivity 😀
You are correct. Biden needs come down on the right side of this and that's to choose Kamala.
This shows that Biden was going to withhold money if a prosecutor needed to get fired.
But Biden isnt even preferable to Trump. There's a very good case to be made that he's worse.
The Biden campaign knows about Bass’s history with the Brigade, which began as a joint venture of the Castro government and Students for a Democratic Society, the leftist, antiwar organization that gave birth to the Weather Underground terrorist group.
Why is it Binary now specifically? Hes not starting wars like Obama and Bush did. He has been great at keeping peace with North Korea.  I don't trust Biden on EITHER of those issues and without a doubt foreign intervention is the most important issue in this election.  #VoteGold

So UNH's survey of New Hampshire has... -Biden up 53%/40% on Trump -Gov. Sununu (R) up by like 30% -Sen. Shaheen (D) up almost 20% I think it's possible Biden's lead in NH may be a bit smaller right now than this (maybe like 8-10% or so,) but the rest checks out decently well.
The vp will be serving at Least 2 years of Biden’s term -that pick alone could derail his election-
Joe Biden IS dementia personified!
What stupid Republican hasn’t down played this virus!!  downplayed it!! You all are just killing yourselves. Gonna make it hopefully easier for Biden to win in November. Darwin at his finest!!

Well ya. 1000 officers isn’t necessary for 300 ppl. Biden also has secret service. Nice headline for those who don’t read the article
I think it underscores that this race hasn't been about Biden, and still isn't really. It's about if people want trump back in or not... and right now, it sure doesn't look like they do. COVID and the BLM protests helped push Trump's JAs back to where they have been for awhile.

How does that not tip the scales in favor of Biden?
Dueling antagonists. China says 没有 to Trump; Russia says nyet to Biden. Who cares, as long as they stay on the sidelines and don't meddle.
Im shook biden just went on a rasist rant talking about black people think all alike I cant with either canidates
I'm not accusing anyone of anything. You're all just proving my point nicely. Trump's "racism" turns on subjective interpretation of what he says. Biden's racism is objectively racist.
I wouldn't be too sure of Biden winning the most votes.
Biden was heard to say :" Gee wiz man,"
Hey what if I told you that neither Biden nor Trump actually take their religious beliefs all that seriously, and saying that Catholics *must* vote for one or the other is a ridiculous false dichotomy
Another piece of fake news to disrespect our President! Put some celebrities in it because they know everything right?You people are as brainwashed as Biden! Go ahead and vote for someone that can't even put a sentence together unless someone orchestrates it for him!  Vote Trump!
If Trump could get Biden to say some thing nice about religion , God or rebuke the liberals in the media who are anti religion , then it would be a public service.
Well she is 80. Trump/Biden shouldn’t be running this country either in their mid 70’s but I digress.
Trump is racist. But as VP....you can’t say that. Sounds like Biden has moved on from her and I hope that’s true.
how can Biden have any blacks in his administration when he can not tell one from another ?
My point is that when Trump says very fine people you have to assume that he is talking about white supremacists. You have to  subjectively assign the most racist meaning to it. You don't have to assume anything with biden's racism.
Trump never said that poor kids are just as smart and talented as white kids. See Trump's supposed "racism" is subjective, determined by people who either hate him or look for racism in everything. Biden's racism is objective, overt racism.
Aside from that Biden admitted it in an interview lol
Biden faces backlash for comparing diversity in African American, Latino communities  Biden has always supported the African American Community! #TrumpIsARacist
I feel bad for her, but our Country had 'high grade' depression for eight long years during #Obama / #Biden. Stagnant economy Poor race relations Increased government dependency etc...
In November we will. That is as long as Joe Biden is POTUS
And before you think it because I hate trump, I do, but that's not it. I would feel the same for any president, especially one as old and questionable as trump or Biden. No pres should have unchecked power.
If the VP doesn't come from the Progressive side, Biden's in trouble. He doesn't even know it.
When President Johnson sent young blacks to Vietnam , it was murder and he lost all claim to his humanity. When Bill Clinton talked to leaders on the phone while being s----ed off by an aid or extorted money for his foundation it was immoral, as it was for Biden with what he did.
Oh the good old days , when Biden got naked in front of the woman voters , and extorted money for his son, or defended the KKK
2 fearless interviews for Trump , 0 "You on drugs, all blacks are the same " for Biden .

Historian who has accurately called every election since 1984 says Biden will beat Trump in 2020 race
My opinion is the same that you are trying to make of Biden. I don't think Trunp is a racist, but he has said some insensitive things.
The things that you're quoting are racist only if you look for race in everything. What Biden had said are objectively racist.   Also technically the Haiti and shit hole country comments would be xenophobic, not racist.
Biden also said he doesn't want his kids living in a racial jungle.
No but Biden did say "poor people are just as smart as white people"  Also the Mexican quote is not accurate. He said some of the illegal immigrants coming from Mexico are rapists. He did not say Mexicans are rapists.
I was referring to Biden
CNN is propoganda. All news outlets are propoganda.  There is a comparison. Trump has never said anything overtly racist. Biden has on many occasions said openly racist things.    Either way. Your comment said Biden isn't racist, but you just admitted he was.
That can’t be right how can Biden choose Rice.  What a ticket of half wits.
If elected president, Joe Biden will do God like he did Corn Pop.
You're telling me, in a year that ANY Democrat can beat Donald Trump, Joe Biden is the man?? The best?? 👌
I’ll walk barefoot on glass to vote for Joe Biden, but boy do I want her to be the VP!
I'll not lecturing. I'm just trying to help you shake those delusions. If you believe Trump is racist but Biden isn't, youre clearly delusional.
Agree it’s an outlier just not a huge one. 40% is what McConnell’s Democratic rivals traditionally get. Also nationally undecideds are breaking towards Biden but in a deep red state undecideds will break towards Trump. They disagree with Trump but are. primed to hate liberals
Well, it is true. There is no "if." Biden and Obama built the cages. But hey don't let facts get in the way of your tantrum.

This is not just Trump v. Biden. This is Trump v. united    Biden has twice as many gen election wins than Trump. Obama/Biden ticket carried NH twice, Trump lost. (If you include FITN both Trump &amp; Biden are tied)   won 6 of last 7 (86%) prez races.   #nhpolitics
Biden has a lot of experience with that his whole family are on drugs Usually you say what is true about yourself so maybe we should stop calling him senile &amp; call him a COKEHEAD Cocaine overdose may result in brain damage That explains everything 👎😀🇺🇸
I tell my friends all the time Trump isn't going to make it till Nov election he is going to resign  and have Pence Pardon him and His whole family that's why Rudy has been around to make that deal I bet its been talked about for a long time Trump can't take chance Biden beats
Does anyone really believe that Joe Biden is the face of abolition of police and seizure of guns?
Oh no! First Obama didnt do it and now Biden will? I don’t believe it
And Susan Rice being considered for Biden's VP? She's married to a top ABC exec.
Absolutely.  It is simply nuts and way out of hand.  I am so angry with the democratic leadership.  They only want this violence to continue b/ they somehow think it will help Biden get into office.  WRONG!!  I am an independent who loves Trump!
It's wild how many people on this thread are asking what our alternative is. Get involved in your state legislative races. Make sure you vote in (Progressive) people that won't cow-tow to biden OR trump. Veto-proof majorities in both houses, the exec is far less consequential.
The only thing that convinces me that Joe Biden is still alive is that he keeps saying crazy shit.
Can #Biden be anymore racist? He says the most racist statements repeatedly. #CNN #MSNBC #NYTimes #Wapo
Biden view on African Americans. Crack addicts, not black if don’t vote for him, not smart “like white kids” and limited on thoughts and opinion🤔
It makes me physically ill that  would not be standing up and screaming she is voting for Biden. I loved her father and believe he would be screaming to vote for Biden.
Shouldn't the White House Medical team examine Biden? How can someone with obvious mental issues be allowed to run for President of the USA?
I think  should not debate  it would be a total embarrassment for the Biden family. This isn’t funny it’s actually tragic. Trumps counter punches might make Biden fall down and pass out. #TragicBiden

So running on defunding police is a real winning strategy for Biden then.
No. She said, “during the Biden-Obama administration.”  He said, “You made me President.”  We don’t need to make up shit, there’s plenty of material to work with.
If Biden get's 90 percent of the vote on election day , will dems admit that is impossible therefore we need a do over or demand Trump leave office anyway ?

Since he said he wishes a child rapist well I have doubts about Biden also!
This tweet was not meant for you...it’s for normal people that understand that a system that makes us choose between Trump and Biden is broken. If you don’t understand why Biden is ultimately no better than Trump, it’s because you’re not questioning enough. Have a nice day.
Biden 2020  Nice try Eric!
I know someone who talks about how "dumb" Joe Biden is, because he disagrees with the ideas/positions/proposals. Conversely, this is demonstration of a spectacular level of incompetence on basic logic. As  you need to 'get it' more than this.  is great
When Biden wished a child rapist WELL twice I was DONE with him! I am voting for the other guy!
All those bad things are because of Covid. Biden called Trump a Xenophobe for closing the borders. Trump prevented millions of deaths &amp; a worse crash. Joe would've destroyed the country overnight. Stop watching Fake News &amp; get some facts!
Serious question: Especially if Joe Biden is seriously considering serving only one term, doesn't it make sense to choose a VP who would want to boost their profile so that we have a younger candidate who can win the Presidency in 2024?

Why do they feel the need to overdo it so much. Is this along the lines of "Thou doth protest too much"? I have 1 2x2 inch Biden sticker on my car.

Biden would nationalize TicTok
So Senate control may well come down to #MEsen. There's only been 2 public polls taken of that race, and in those, Gideon holds a 45% to 40.5% lead on Collins on average. Given that Biden is gonna win Maine decisively and that Collins isn't clearing Trump's share of support...
RE: #NCsen. The last 4 polls of the race (taken from 7/7 to 7/31) show Cunningham up 49.3%-39.8% on average, and he's outperforming Biden across the board. Looking more like a "Lean D" race atm, which combined with AZ and CO would get Ds to 49 Senate seats...

Kamala Harris has done more to promote, fund raise and get Biden’s message out than anyone else. So all the has beens a please stop.
This shows that Biden was going to withhold money if a prosecutor needed to get fired.
Ignoring concerns about the threats to women’s civil rights, Joe Biden promises to use the Equality Act to promote a long list of transgender rights that will eclipse women’s rights and the rights of people of faith if he is elected.

She is doing her job , which is to tear the country apart so Biden wins and Biden can pretend to rebuild it.

Well ya. 1000 officers isn’t necessary for 300 ppl. Biden also has secret service. Nice headline for those who don’t read the article
I think it underscores that this race hasn't been about Biden, and still isn't really. It's about if people want trump back in or not... and right now, it sure doesn't look like they do. COVID and the BLM protests helped push Trump's JAs back to where they have been for awhile.

I'm voting for Biden even if he picks a guy working at a Maryland carwash....
No, I would not. Personally, I'm voting for Biden regardless of who he picks. But I fear some others would be scared off by Warren because they'll view the VP as the president-in-waiting (more so than normal).
If Trump did lie in a debate, Biden probably couldn't correct him anyway. You need to remember real facts and truth to confront the opposite. You can't confront an untruth by just saying it is untruth. And, remember Joe said, “We choose truth over facts.” Truth without facts? OK

President Trump has taken questions at the end of all his press conferences the last several days since the VP announcement. (He almost always does anyway.)  Biden and Harris have taken a grand total of zero at their three events together so far.  🤔
now you just need somone to tweet from your account like Biden does 😆
Vote for Biden so Trump doesn’t turn our country into an autocracy.
It will be fun the day after the election to see the sure thing of Biden go down ( which Harris has done) to defeat you know like your last sure thing Hillary
This is complete and utter nonsense. Let's get specific: In what way is America gone forever if Biden wins the election? We'll still have our Constitution with all of its checks and balances and we'll still have our votes to hold leadership accountable. 1/2
Oh Hillary that is just not true! The postal service is does need some changes. The reality is that even if the money the money you and your wackos would not allow time to make the changes needed for this election. It certainly was not a priority under The Obama &amp; Biden administr
It is not because Kamala Harris is a woman, or because she is not white, that people like me have an issue with her, and might be perceived as “freaking out” about her.  It’s 1) her views on the issues, and 2) considering Biden’s age and evident cognitive decline, the reality...
I copied this; following the announcement of the historic peace deal between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden made the astonishing claim that the Obama admin was partially responsible for preparing the way for the deal.
I agree - I can’t stand Trump but I won’t vote for Biden either because of this. I will blank the ballot for the second presidential election in a row.
That’s the Biden campaign calling to see if thegg th should remind you to vote on Election Day
I dont know if I should like biden or not.  But at this point, anything is far better than tru.p
It’s funny everyone is using my  comment about Biden being an EMPTY VESSEL They did this with a lot of my words like ABOLISH &amp; TROJAN HORSE LOL 😀🇺🇸
It seems like if Biden loses we’re not getting a better candidate next time. No valid reason not to vote for Biden.
I am making this clear now. If you consider yourself a leftists, democrat, liberal, socialist, soc-dem, etc... and you don’t vote for Biden as well as advocate for an independent; You are a rat fuck, piece of shit, privelaged mouth breather who has no business talking politics.
Stop complaining about Biden when the alternative is 10x worse.
Biden and Harris are smoking up some weed right now, coming up with their Crime Bill for 2021. I guess November 3rd is just a test to find out if it's true that poor kids are just as bright as white kids.
I love the implication that Schumer is somehow a stronger personality than Biden. I mean, who looks at Chuck Schumer and thinks, There's a charisma machine.
Lol 😂 , that tweet was about Biden taking credit for the UAE / Israel peace deal .   ✅🇺🇸
Fours years and Dems come up with  this Team? Lol. Biden wow he will get the Dems excited.
Trump will exit as he should, though by picking Biden dem moved the date to 2024.
Another lie!!!  Biden/Harris 2020!
I'm Joe Biden, vote for me. All the magic today that JFK had in 64.
I can't imagine Joe Biden taking this kind of heat from the press...then again I cant imagine the press asking Joe Biden tough  question
Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks  #FoxNews
Plagiary knock this stuff out  For the debates I am hopeful they Michael Buffer to come stage. Yelling Lets get ready to Rumble. Make Biden and the President shake hands. Have the moderator come and give them the rules.  POTUS goes back to his podium. Joe is looking boxing gluvs
Biden is a lost cause. I bet overnight when Biden is sleeping they slip on ear buds and sublimely tell him the facts as they see it.
The longer people say that the less a chance change will every come I like Biden 12 years ago but he is clearly not at the top of his game
I thought their names were “Braindead Biden and Heels High Harris”!
There is simply no greater moral or human rights  issue in our time than abortion.  It kills more innocent people than anything else.  I hope people understand the gravity of this issue, and think long and hard before voting for Biden/Harris or anyone of any political party...
...would be the most pro-choice, pro-abortion one ever.  The differences could not be more stark.  For those of us who believe in the sanctity of all human life from womb to tomb, the prospects of a Biden/ Harris Presidency should cause us grave concern.
In this election you will see the greatest disparity in terms of candidates positions on abortion than ever before.  The record clearly shows Trump/Pence is the most pro-life, anti-abortion administration since Roe v Wade, and it also shows a Biden/Harris administration...
I had my doubts about Biden’s Catholicism already with his stance on abortion, but his selection of someone like Harris, confirms my belief that he does not take it very seriously.
But upon reflection, I think that speaks to the reality that everyone is thinking right now, that Kamala would really be the President if they are elected, considering Biden’s age and clearly evident cognitive decline.
Wtfiswrongwithyou? Trump is a confirmed pathological liar. Saying Biden is a liar is mighty funny coming from a JPS trump supporter. Bless your brain
The thousands that lined the streets in Ohio recently wasn’t a rally, either....and all they wanted to do was wave to a freakin car that rode by...  You can ignore the truth all you want, and live in your fantasyland...but it’s 4 more years, n Biden choosing Harris guaranteed it
That is fake because if she was really looking for the truth she wouldn’t run with corrupt Biden
She has no brain like Biden They should name their ticket DUMB &amp; DUMBER 😀🇺🇸👎
Are you that out of touch?  The DNC was calling her a Russian spy, Assad apologist, etc. A two time veteran who has had extensive background checks and security clearances.  The second she “endorsed” Biden it all went away.  Hmmm🤔
Biden cannot fly? Is it out of fear? Did Biden see a gremlin on the wing of the plane?
Is he taking the same road Hillary took to-the White House? 4 years and the best you do is Biden and Harris??? Trump will be re-elected and it’s the Dems fault-
Stop name calling with Biden.  POTUS you come off as a bully. Your base or core voters will not stray because you stopped assaulting a mentally ill senior.  Do not shoot at Camela. She is not Hilarity. Nor is she Black. A person of color does not mean black.
How is Joe Biden going to run for President after he's charged with treason?...He'll run from his jail cell like Eugene Dibs did. #MAGA
If Joe Biden dies in late in October, what happens on election day?
Business Insider Fox News host baselessly claims that 'something's going to happen' to Joe Biden, forcing her colleague to walk her comment back    Biden will feign a stroke late in October.
I, too, am a HUGE fan of Amtrak, my favorite way to travel, well, second to bikes.  (Why Is Joe Biden Called "Amtrak Joe"? | Amtrak Joe Meaning
As a right-leaning political outsider, Kamala Harris as VP makes no sense to me.  1: CA is a safe state for Biden  2: She has little-to-no momentum in the primaries  3: BLM is reinvigorated and she locked people up for non-violent marijuana charges The Donald should be thrilled
They're gearing up to send more black men to prison. A Biden Harris ticket would essentially guarantee that the US will never not be the most incarcerated country on the planet. This is such an unbelievably dark election for the people and history of America. There's so much evil
Looking forward to watching these two - and many other inspiring Democrats - at the 2020 Democratic National Convention next week!  #DemConvention  Join me in supporting Joe Biden via
She’s absolutely the safe choice. We saw what an all white ticket did the last time and neither of their polices are left enough to upset the moderates and independents. Biden isn’t left enough for most dems, me included. I’m so much less excited than I was when Hillary ran :/
Biden can't speak.
Perhaps but history is against her - George HW Bush was only VP since Martin Van Biden to become president after his predecessor competed his term
Enough said about Biden. What a leader.
Sorry if this sounds like fluff as refreshing as listening to Biden and Harris was, it was also refreshing to see how much their spouses really seem to love them.
The DNC working with Jill Biden have come up with a plan to help Joe in campaign events when he leaves his basement. Here is a picture of that effort
So that is what Biden and her have in common.
Skip the debates? It because we have seen Biden for for so long he we need to see him in a debate. I will retire in a year. I was 10 when he first won office.
The saddest thing will be if Biden wins. Then it is the fault of all the fools who voted for him!!
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris introduce their presidential ticket in Delaware
Just set up my weekly recurring contribution to #BidenHarris2020! - Join me in supporting Joe Biden via
Trump should get Biden to admit his corruption
If this comes to pass I still won’t vote for that racist Biden, but I won’t vote for Trump either. I’ll stay home or write in someone that actually cares about personal freedom and responsibility. #FuckThePower
Clearly Joe Biden didn't select Kamala Harris (period).
Um Biden IS Catholic 🤨
You thinking this is a good line of attack in Biden is hilarious. #DumpTrump2020  #BidenHarris2020  #BlueTsunami2020
pushing radical politics online and voting for biden/harris is kinda like...       💭 🤔  bragging about how much you love spicy food and pulling taco bell picante out your purse
This is a big hit. She will say I was just there for hope.   Question, Camal did you come out and say you an apologize for acting with out care about the truth?  Bet you did not. Go smoke a bone and you and Biden can listen to music that won't be written for 3 years. HASHAHAHAH
Are you talking about yourself?  Biden/Harris 2020😇😇😇
Treating our poorer citizens as lesser citizens speaks volumes about you and your whole administration. All Americans do not matter to you. Icant wait to vote for Biden/Harris. #DumpTrump2020  #BidenHarris2020  #BlueTsunami2020
I’m not questioning her qualifications. Just the selection by Biden.
Yeah I’m not that naive to junk that it’s all the candidate. But all the talking points today has tried to paint the picture that it was Biden who is bringing her in.   But after all the animosity during the campaign it just doesn’t seem like it’s a blend of ideas here.
So these turds think it's okay that Fearless Leader can conduct policy via Twitter, but Biden can't announce his pick online? OK, got it...😏
Both could be an option but don’t feed me the line that it was all Biden.
Honest question.   Did Biden really pick Harris or did the DNC pick Harris for Biden?
What bullshit. #CrookedJoe picked #Catholic hater Kamala Harris for VP. Send Harris &amp; Herono asked a Trump nominee to resign from the Kights of Columbus but Biden is #Catholic? : Biden Plays the Catholic Card
I have a good title for Harris &amp; Biden The ROOSTER &amp; The Canary Get it rooster becomes she’s a cocksucker &amp; canary because it is a bird that is used to die Its life has no valu like JOkE 👎😀🇺🇸
Donald Trump isn’t going to go after policy issues. He’s going to go after the context of Joe Biden’s and Kamala Harris’ character. Donald Trump is and always will be weak.
Nail, meet head! So well said. Thank God those white fossils didn't bbn prevail. I also hope Obama keeps his ear in Biden cuz, well, Biden...
I supported bernie but never got t hff e bernie bro meme. I WILL and DO support Biden and always was gonna support any Dem. Love Kamala too. This is t hff e most important election of our lives
With respect, the “America as you know it will be gone forever” is nothing more than scaremongering. There is nothing extreme about Biden, and all of the constitutional checks and balances will still be in place. Trump’s divisiveness as a tactic must be repudiated loudly in Nov.
Biden is the candidate-Dems got that wrong as well-
No way! It hurts like hell. He is such a nice guy. Reminds me of a Hispanic co worker who thinks Biden is evil. They are lost to Putins propaganda and the dark web. We must shut those down! Fox news needs to be sued for slander. Outrageous!
I hope and pray you will have a prominent role in the Biden admin. I also dream of an all black administration one day. I believe the saving of this country will come from ur black citizens. I for one am ready
Just compromise. Something is better than nothing.  Why is that so hard? After biden wins, you can kick ass but you are losing this argument.  I'm a Bernie supporter and now  Biden/Harris "bro". Dont make is suffer to get at tRump. Please! Pretty please Speaker!
The same reason they picked her for VP She is another empty vessel like Joe Biden They don’t have to worry about her going rogue like Barack Obama 👎😀🇺🇸
History was made today 8-11-2020: the first African American woman - of Jamaican and SouthAsian descent - will be the running mate to #Biden, the presumptive Democratic Nominee for President of the United States. Kamala's mother was a trailblazer herself! #WomenSupportingWomen
Biden: "Let's Remember when America was Great"
Biden has picked Kamala Harris as his running mate. I'm hip with it.
Fox's Cavuto fact-checks Trump camp claim that Harris called Biden racist: 'She never did'
This how Joe Biden started out?
I’ll say this, as DA -  record is problematic. As a US Senator her voting record and advocacy on policy issues satisfy me thoroughly - and certainly moreso than Biden’s.  I’ve settled for Biden.  I’ll vote for Harris.
Ridiculous. Neither Biden nor Harris support socialism. This life-long GOP voter (until Trump) will never support the current GOP ticket, nor will I vote for anybody who doesn’t distance themselves from Trump.
BIDEN-HARRIS ticket is awful!!!!  VOTERS: yeah, but the alternative is T...   VOTERS WILL REJECT THE BIDEN-HARRIS TICKET
Biden/Harris a Winning Ticket! We’re ready for November! Couldn’t be happier with this choice! Team Biden for the WIN! ❤️
Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
BREAKING: My Trump-voting Republican father said he thinks Kamala is a good pick. He likes that Biden and Harris competed hard then patched things up, and that she's not hard left. Also, she's pretty. (Doh)
“Kamala” James Harris dies on Sunday, Kamala Harris is chosen as VP running mate on Tuesday. #illuminati
It should be noted that Trump was not mentioned once in this press release as the alternative to Biden-Harris. Most likely because he’s exceptionally unpopular in NH. #nhpolitics
Doesn’t matter if Biden wins or loses  Stacey imagines herself in that position-so she must be
In other breaking news Stacey Abrams has resigned her Imaginary Governors job to accept the imaginary VP  position Biden didn’t offer her.#StaceymyVP
In other breaking news Stacey Abrams has resigned her Imaginary Governors job to accept the imaginary VP  position Biden didn’t offer her.#StaceymyVP
Biden would be pressured. Women would have beaten it him down for his choice. Now watch this scene no women are allowed, but the women pretend to be men.
Biden chose harris...if they win were fucked
I’m so excited that Kamal Harris is Joe Biden’s pick!  I think she is amazing!!!  #ByeDon
🆘 To be sure My Friends the Democrats , Leftists and Socialists will use this Biden/Harris duo to create Rhetoric, Advertisements and negative Commercials to go after any  campaign responses as Racism , anti Elderly and Misogynist ! Be prepared 🧨! ✅🇺🇸
Congratulations to VP Nominee #KamalaHarris. Biden-Kamala 2020! #KamalaHarrisForVP #Kamala #BidenHarris2020  Below  is a picture I managed to get with our presumptive VP Nominee, Kamala Harris, at a rally in NashuaNH last spring!
Joe Biden helped write the 1994 crime bill and Kamala Harris made a career of locking people up for marijuana offenses. So there’s the systematic change you all wanted, I guess?
well it should help #CrookedJoe Biden win California. #RaceCard
and doesn't help him in any state he needs help.  CA was already in the bag for Biden...can't wait to see the ads showing her fucking her married boss for a job...literally...
OMG...between Biden picking Harris and the NCAA cancelling football, Trump is going to be in the corner in the fetal position.
This is Biden’s America....Trump is trying to stop it from spreading.  If you don’t understand THAT fact, then you really should stop posting such nonsense...
🆘 We Now know that Joe Biden under his current mental state”Will DO WHAT he is TOLD!”Prominent Black businessmen ORDERED Biden to pick a Black Woman to be his VP running mate in Nov or lose the election!So if Biden Wins Harris will be Second in line and could become POTUS ✅🇺🇸
#VPPick  I’m a little surprised; I thought it was going to be #SusanRice . I’m not sure how Kamala helps Biden in the swing states.  It will be interesting to see how/ if this pic helps or hurts him.
Kamala Harris on the ticket with Biden just made my day! First time in a long time that I screamed for happiness and not frustration at the 📺.
Kamala Harris Is Biden’s Choice for Vice President
And you know this for a fact? Even if you have seen Joe Biden tax plan whic I highly doubt, you aren’t smart enough to crunch the numbers! So quit taking out of your behind!
Imagine if Biden pledged to only consider a man? If you think that would be sexist, you agree that Biden saying the same about only choosing a woman is too.
Yet he still has followers. Truly baffles me. We need a landslide for Biden.
Depends on who wins the US election.  Biden: I’ll stay Trump: let me know the fastest way to learn mandarin and cantonese
Biden doesn't hate God, I believe he is Catholic, and I am as well. We believe in God and his only begotten son Jesus Christ. By the way John F Kennedy was also Irish Catholic. I had a picture of John and Jackie with little John outside a Chapel. Trump is an illegitimate POTUS.
No American wants to see social security defunded. Vote Biden. 🗳 #nhpolitics #VoteTrumpOut
If America wants Barack Obama to be president for another 8 years then vote for Joe Biden 👎😀🇺🇸
TDS keeps the LGBTQ community from the truth about Joe Biden. He'll tell you whatever you want to hear. He's as fake as CNN "news".
Joe Biden is so racist it's unbelievable!!!!👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿😲
You mean Biden/Rice
YES!!!!! Another incredible N.H. Primary alum is rising in the ranks! Turn PA Biden Blue,
Biden could nominate Ivanka as his VP and I’d still vote for him. ❤️
If for no other reason, a vote for Joe Biden is vote to get rid of AG Jaba the Hutt!
I voted for Susan Rice cuz she’d be the worst but Val Demmings would be Biden’s best pick.
We can’t let Biden destroy America
WTF is wrong with u. FYI, Biden hasn't won yet. If u compromised and told Americans in 100 days u and the next admin will fill those gaps, you would get support. But, you hate of Trump (which I hate too) is making us all suffer. You are a loser to us.
Love you, Amy, but if he’s Biden, please call them Harris and Warren. Or say Joe. Words matter, and first names signal reduced respect (when juxtaposed with surnames).
I did no such thing, oh You meant Joe Biden
I love Bernie Sanders with all my heart, but if people vote for Bernie this November simply because he’s on the ballot... that would divide Biden’s votes. Do NOT vote Bernie in Nov. I wish it could have been different but it’s not. We can’t have any more of Trump. #VoteBiden2020
Honestly, whether Biden is up 7% or 9/10% nationally doesn't make a world of difference when it comes to the outcome. He would win solidly in any of these scenarios, only places where it'd make a difference would be like GA/TX/OH/IA/ME-2 etc after Biden's already at 334 EVs.
BIDEN SUPPORTS KKK
I know I don't much about you but I have been rooting for you to be picked by Joe Biden as his running mate.I believe you're are very qualified, intelligent and at the same time a beautiful woman in &amp; out.Your dreams are valid and may God bless you.
I don’t care who the VP is, Biden has my vote. ❤️
This will be money very well spent. The GOP is so out of touch with what our country actually needs. Go BIDEN!
Your party nominated Biden, this should the #1 reason why you're far from overconfident.
He acting like Biden  by saying he comes from a blue collar family Scaramucci is an idiot 👎😀🇺🇸
"It's shocking that Joe Biden would even consider putting communist Karen Bass a heartbeat away from the presidency – but that’s exactly what he’s doing."
She talks like Biden have them talk at the same time to get a complete sentence 👎😀🇺🇸
🆘NOW we know there is a 200 mph Electric Corvette coming thanks to Joe LMAO 🤣 .That was a GM Competitive  Secret Joe !        IF by some miracle Joe gets Elected in Nov:    Joe will have the SECRET NUCLEAR CODES  🤦‍♀️ Xi Jinping 🇨🇳 standing by 😱.
They way Biden is campaigning, he welcomes any distraction!
I don't VOTE for IMPEACHED assholes, he can stick radical left up where the sun don't shine. Biden will hurt the Bible and hurt God. What an F--in imbecile. #KanyeConJob
I don’t think Biden choosing his VP based on Gender and Race matters to #Dems/#NHDems at all. #nhpolitics
And... Jeff Dunham / Ventriloquist, a guy who gets paid for playing with puppets. Hmmm...🙄 Sounds like that could be right up Joe Biden's alley, free hugs &amp; puppets🤢🤮
Is Joe Biden Mentally There?  via  “Wait what”? 😂😂😂
No...I think Biden should hang Trump’s mug shot!
I voted for the guy and I will again Biden would be an even worse choice
You won’t be safe in #CrookedJoe Biden’s Amerika! #nhpolitics #tlot
Sounds like you, Trump - being against God!!! Biden is very religious AND KIND!!
If you want people to like you, this is not the way!!  Biden 2020!
Pls.  It’s not Biden running for president. It’s HIS squad
Looks like Biden is pedaling away from Chris Wallace.
Biden wears the same glasses as you showed. Aviators is what I think is the proper name. But I am not sure.
Going for the Biden look?
The fact that I have cancelled Netflix should not be misinterpreted as a precursor to an announcement that I am Biden's pick for VP.
Oh Biden does that all on his own every time that he speaks
#nhpolitics #CrookedJoe Biden? Really?
Move along folk, nothing to see here:  Biden gaffes ignored by MSNBC's primetime shows for 3 straight nights  #FoxNews
The only person that Biden could pick as his running mate that would lose my vote- Trump.   In which case I'm just swimming to Portugal.
Hey Donnie. I think you miscalculated the Kanye West situation. I believe he will take votes away from you, not sleepy Joe. Republicans that don’t want to vote for you or Biden will vote for Kanye. Another miscalculation on your part.
This " I can't believe I have to say this..." on Biden tweets is becoming so frequent it reminds me of  #ToddlerInChief posts or this bit
How is it racist to say some people say this person will cause Biden problems?. I'm talking about a possible candidate for VP. So any discussion of a candidates negative points is racist? Don't think so,
If Biden raise taxes the rich, what do u think will happen. The rich will pass that tax down to us, the poorer people. That could mean lower wage increases, job cuts, higher prices, a ripple effect back down to us. Raising taxes on the rich is a joke. People like u r fooled by it
🆘Joe! TAX or CONFISCATE the Remittances those Illegals are sending back to their home countries &amp; if you want them to have Health Insurance Fund it through Illegal’s Remittances !Leave Citizens Taxpayer Dollars Alone!Drop Out Joe!  ✅🇺🇸
Joe,did you know there are about 48 million African American Citizens  and around 27 million Hispanic Citizens/59 million Hispanics in total in US ? You managed to Isolate yourself from 14 .6 % of America . You need to drop out now ✅🇺🇸
But China and Iran don’t want Trump? Is Biden weak with them? You guys are idiots
FATHER the SLEEPER has AWAKEN....Donald Trump, WE come for you! How can this be, Because BIDEN is the KWISATCH HADERACH. #TrumpKillsSeniors
Is Ron Johnson, a US Senator in cahoots with the Russians to help steal the election for Trump, by trying to discredit Joe Biden, where the F*CK is the FBI? This is the United States if true Ron Johnson is a piece of 💩. #GOPComplicitTraitors
Instagram claims “bug” favored Donald Trump over Joe Biden  #Facebook #Election2020
Why is it that all you tweets now reference Joe Biden in one form or another.... scared ? Desperate ? Or as I think .... Both! Your time pretending to be something you’re clearly not up too is coming to a close
You probably heard about Joe Biden within the last year. He has been in office close to 50. He along with others are flat out dismissive of black voters. Remember he said Obama was different-he was clean and articulate. CLEAN? Joe cares nothing about blacks
Well she is 80. Trump/Biden shouldn’t be running this country either in their mid 70’s but I digress.
Trump is racist. But as VP....you can’t say that. Sounds like Biden has moved on from her and I hope that’s true.
With everything that is going on, trying to chill with my coffee. Listening to Stevie Nick's music, was thinking about the election and Trump. And this is what came on... And I saw Trump's reflection in a snow covered hill Until a LANDSLIDE brought it down. Smile. Vote Biden.
I enjoy mocking Trump as much as anyone but I just can't get behind the "thighland" thing.  He simply misspoke and quickly corrected himself. Not unlike when Biden recently misspoke and said "millions" when he meant "thousands" and immediately corrected his mistake.
I feel bad for her, but our Country had 'high grade' depression for eight long years during #Obama / #Biden. Stagnant economy Poor race relations Increased government dependency etc...
According to Trump today, Joe Biden wants to “hurt God”. Are we living in a Shin Megami Tensei game and I’m just now figuring it out?   Also, Biden... if you need another member for the party I’m IN.
I've been more and more thinking I like  .  Hey, if anyone in the Biden campaign is listening, Duckworth is a good choice.
I agree. I will not exhale until I see Biden's hand on that bible, reciting the oath of office.
We are ...trying to take guns away and there are court case going on right now with Obama gate, Biden, Sonos, Clinton's, etc...
When Biden is safely inaugurated we can all sit back and breathe a collective sigh of relief. But then we have to get right to work to repair the damage Trump inflicted.
That can’t be right how can Biden choose Rice.  What a ticket of half wits.
This just in Trump claims if elected Biden plans to peg God
I think that’s bullshit...... I wouldn’t be shocked at 35-40% but 50% seems a bit much given how he’s dealt with protests and Covid. He’s a horrible human being and Ild like to think anyone with a brain would vote for Biden.
#joebiden accidentally says what all Liberals think!! Watch !!  Biden raises eyebrows with remark contrasting African American, Latino diversity  #FoxNews
"I'm not trying to proselytize, I'm not trying to convince you to be, to share my religious views. For me it ...gives me some reason to have hope and purpose," Biden said to grieving pastor who'd lost his wife  you mean this Godly man?
He talks about Joe Biden yet he can’t finish one damn sentence
As much as I would despise a President Biden, I will NOT Vote for Trump should he not “recognize our right to Vape flavored eliquid”. I am sick of state/federal interference of our personal rights and our freedoms as Americans. #TrumpMustAct
#Unemployment #Pandemic #CorruptPoliticians #coronavirus #AgendaPolicies #Ignorance #Hatred  #carelessness #Elections #Economy #Trump #Biden #OldWhiteMen Is it a wonder we’re all #Fucked?
Biden has a lot of experience with that his whole family are on drugs Usually you say what is true about yourself so maybe we should stop calling him senile &amp; call him a COKEHEAD Cocaine overdose may result in brain damage That explains everything 👎😀🇺🇸
Whoa! How does he get a pass on his racist babble? We really have had a first-hand look into the mind of Biden of the past few months.
Because democrats know they’re not really nominating Joe Biden. Their nominating his VP pick. I’m calling it now. Shortly after getting into office if he wins he will resign it’s something will happen where he has to leave office.
Gee, I thought you #nhdems would be bragging about the #Diversity of Hispanics like #CrookedJoe Biden did today. #nhpolitics
Does anyone really believe that Joe Biden is the face of abolition of police and seizure of guns?
Allan Lichtman has predicted the winner of every election since 1984 predicts Biden... So there's that lol
Wait...Biden is black???🤔
Shit, Joe Biden's that powerful? I'd be afraid to vote AGAINST him in that case21 yrs ago Jen O’Malley Dillon arrived in Manchester to coordinate out of state volunteers for Gore’s 2000 NH Primary Campaign. She was the hardest working, most talented member of the entire staff. The Biden Harris campaign is in great hands. #nhpolitics
NBA says photographer who posted offensive Kamala Harris meme is no longer in bubble
Maybe if our President and the Post Master General weren’t sabotaging it, mail in voting would be a viable option. It’s not. Mask up, go to the polls, and vote Biden.
In struggle to land a blow on Biden, Trump toys with nickname change | Article [AMP] | Reuters
I use my real picture in my profile
Biden doesn't support prosecuting the last administration. Keeps him out of jail when he's done. (Nudge, nudge, wink, wink, ya know what I mean?)
Literally never said that. Another lying politician. I thought Biden was racist kamala? Remember you believe Biden’s accusers? Flip flop bs.
They “got on board” because they’re opportunistic ass-kissers. They’ll shank Biden if they think it’s in their interest.
Good point. I didn't vote for the worst POTUS in American history. I'm voting for Biden/Harris
Although I’m off at college, today I received my “swag” for the Democratic National Convention this upcoming week! I’m excited to attend my first convention, even though it is online, and help Joe Biden win in November! #DemConvention  #mepolitics #joebiden
Yeah president Trump got the job done something Obama and Biden couldn’t
That is a lie! Biden has had 50years to suggest change. Not a word
The Postal Service Union just endorsed Biden. #TrumpKillsUSPS #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
"I believe the debates should now involve a Biden v Trump map test." This would be awesome. A simple test on major countries of the world. There can be no doubt who would win that...without cheating. Trump would cheat.
Please share.    "Vote Republican November 3rd, 2020, and the Democrat dreams of gun confiscation will be gone as the stage is set in the Democrat party.   Biden steps down for health issues and Harris becomes President.  #nhpolitics
(And thinking about Joe Biden catching all their shows)
Biden's "Book of Trump's Lies". I have to ask, hownmany volumes?
This is complete and utter nonsense. Let's get specific: In what way is America gone forever if Biden wins the election? We'll still have our Constitution with all of its checks and balances and we'll still have our votes to hold leadership accountable. 1/2
Infowars needs a “Biden For Prison” T-shirt.
Biden has been complicit in helping the Communist Party of China shape the culture according to Communist values and beliefs. It is likely that this influence on our media will continue to expand here in our own country if Biden is elected president.
Boy I wish Biden would hold an event like this. What a man you are, congratuations😉😉😉
Now we know why they had to stop the dem primary mid run, then blackmail the other candidates to withdraw so Biden would not have to speak.
It was a reporter who asked about VP not being a citizen not Trump, what a set up, some reporter should ask Biden if he  lies or if his VP is a citizen, or what he meant by this that or anything.
Oh Hillary that is just not true! The postal service is does need some changes. The reality is that even if the money the money you and your wackos would not allow time to make the changes needed for this election. It certainly was not a priority under The Obama &amp; Biden administr
So it's offensive if Trump says it, but not if Newsweek says it? Wouldn't matter to me even if she is eligible under the 14th Amendment. I wouldn't vote for her or Biden.
I remember that so well, Trump was sworn in. It was so memorable. Or where you suggesting Biden being sworn in? Biden will see that crowd, leaning over to someone close, and whisper, what's the big occasion? Then Kamala will be told, you don't need knee pads for this promotion.
That’s the Biden campaign calling to see if thegg th should remind you to vote on Election Day
Look, I’d rather give Biden a try than give you 4 more years! Do you know how many people would leave now if they could?
Mine went up under Trump. Let’s give Biden a try.
It’s funny everyone is using my  comment about Biden being an EMPTY VESSEL They did this with a lot of my words like ABOLISH &amp; TROJAN HORSE LOL 😀🇺🇸
😮😮😮  Biden raised an impressive $81 million in the entire month of May...
I am making this clear now. If you consider yourself a leftists, democrat, liberal, socialist, soc-dem, etc... and you don’t vote for Biden as well as advocate for an independent; You are a rat fuck, piece of shit, privelaged mouth breather who has no business talking politics.
You do NOT represent my America!! Its either Trump, God, freedom, Capitalism,  or Biden, losing freedoms, being arrested for religion and Communism!!
That’s ok because California will go Biden/Harris.
It has been clear to me since the Senate voted not to remove Trump, that it is up to we the people to remove them and Trump.  In order to do this, we must unite and vote for Biden.
Your correct, I voted for POTUS Obama and I'm voting Biden/Harris on November 3rd from NH
Absolutely cannot wrap my head around how disturbingly low the bar has to be to consider Biden a “lesser” evil. This guy destroyed millions of lives, probably tens of millions if you count his foreign policy work and people are just like “pobody’s nerfect”
We need Biden pick a ruthless AG
Biden should have picked Bofa to be his vp
One Tough Question For DOJ If Biden Is Elected: Whether To Prosecute Trump
Biden has asked people to be patriotic to end the #trumpvirus . 1000 dead people a day for 17 days. What number would you recommend a mask you disgusting animal. Our families are dying! It’s a piece of cloth!
Trump just said that biden politicized the pandemic... But he called it a Democrat hoax like... Are you fucking serious?
Trump on Biden wanting masks... joe wants you in the basement. I don’t have one of those basement shaped masks from  yet?
Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks  #FoxNews
Bernie could barely win Vermont.  Polls gave us Biden and Harris.    Not Bernie and AOC.
Yet your party has Biden as the presumptive nominee, out of all the others in the running. How does that square with your distain for "white privilege"?  Time to drop this BS.
That's if we even keep being a country. If Biden wins, I'm not going to make the false statement. That I would leave the country. Instead, I would just hope my state, NH, secedes. Cut off that vortex of crippling fed. debt.
Let me know when she calls Biden a motherfucker that's apples to apples
BaaaHaaaHaaa  I watched Biden than trump yesterday. Biden was coherent, clear, and strong. Trump was slurred, confused and scared.
Yeah, I really can't have it with "both sides are just as bad" this time. I'm not excited about Biden in the slightest but fuck man, we've had concentration camps and secret police among so many other terrible things these past 4 years, it's obvious who's worse in this situation.
Don't you just wish his father wore a condom that night?
He chose Booker because Biden has praised Booker's policies on housing on his own website and said that he is going to expand those policies. Even though factually incorrect, it's not a leap to assume that Booker would be in charge or heavily involved.
I have no idea. Maybe because on Biden's website he said that he was going to enact housing strategies proposed by Booker and Clyburn? I have no idea why.
She leaked that there's going to be a hit on Biden.
Fox News host claims that 'something's going to happen' to Joe Biden - Business Insider
That is fake because if she was really looking for the truth she wouldn’t run with corrupt Biden
She has no brain like Biden They should name their ticket DUMB &amp; DUMBER 😀🇺🇸👎
Analysis: Fox News cuts away from subdued and repetitive Trump for Biden and Harris joint appearance
Because Joe Biden repeated the hoax again tonight
This is gross, judge Jeanine talking about Biden will not be on the ticket,  retweeting tweets with comments about cadavers and joe dropping dead. Seriously Crazy shit.
CNN ripped Tucker Carlson apart for pronouncing her name the same way. Calling him racist and disrespectful toward black people. Biden does it literally the next day. Crickets.
is retweeting tweets that have comments like, brain dead, cadaver, drop dead about Biden. The least I can do is retweet this!
I think the Biden/Harris ticket is the worse all time 🤔🤔🤔         Prove me wrong
“It’s time to stop acting like the presidency is the only office that matters.”   With all the excitement around the historic Biden/Harris ticket (!!), I hope y’all didn’t forget about tomorrow’s virtual reception for   SEE YOU ‘THERE’!  #nhpolitics
Joe Biden is a single term president. He is too old to run again. Kamala Harris’s negative upbringing to power hopefully is because she had to play by what she was given for political gains. We should have a better candidate options in 4 years. This is the first step !
#TrumpKillsUSPS  we all need to pack our GO bags and head to Biden’s new house when trump does not get the hell out.
Promising to speed up the insolvency of SocSec and Medicare is a sure fire way of getting those elderly retirees in FL to turn out in droves, just probably not with the results Trump is banking on. The Biden campaign should just run Trump’s own words on a loop.
Who is donating to Biden besides China?
Well today's was a great ad for Biden. We went from a coherent speach from Biden to drunk uncle at Thanksgiving
even fox was afraid to report Biden was crying on the stage as Harris spoke of his son,,,,,the good one.
Biden gave us our Health Plan that already covers Pre Existing Conditions. Trump trying to eliminate Social Security and Medicare
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris just finished their first time speaking as candidates.   If you missed it I will tell you what you DID NOT MISS.   Neither called anyone a childish name as we are so use to hearing. It was positive and committed to what they plan to achieve.
Join the fight with  in New Hampshire:   #Youthvote #nhpolitics
Biden and Harris set for first joint event as running mates  via
Trump should get Biden to admit his corruption
Get your Biden-Harris gear!!!
What year does this person think it is?? He could have announced the corpse of Hubert Humphrey and I’d rally behind them. But the first Black and first Asian woman to be on the ticket? I’m over the moon! Bet this person would have liked if Biden picked a dead, white guy, though.
Clearly Joe Biden didn't select Kamala Harris (period).
LOL Trump was counting on Biden picking Bass for the same reason he was desperate to run against Bernie Sanders over Biden.
Um Biden IS Catholic 🤨
That's a terrible take. There can be no doubt by any serious observer that Joe  Biden would chew up and spit out Donald Trump in a debate.
We were honored to have had opportunity to hear from Senator Harris at our Flag Day Celebration in June and we are ready to go to work to to see a Biden and Harris victory this November!
Just imagine, for a second, what the last four years might have been like if Donald Trump or anyone in his administration knew literally anything about China
Kamala Harris as VP will be impactful but can we also just take a minute to reflect upon how lucky we will be to have Dr. Jill Biden as our First Lady.  #WomenSupportingWomen #WomenInPolitics #BidenHarris2020 #VOTE #BlueWave2020

Joe Biden Picks Kamala Harris for Vice President | The Tonight Show  via
“Another of  qualities is the capacity to grow + change. Back in the early 90s, he voted for DOMA. But as VP, his support for marriage equality came at a critical moment, when other leaders hesitated to speak out.” #nhpolitics
In 2018,  was 99% sure that two Democrats he would not be supporting were Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. My how things have changed.
Didn’t Kamala Harris call Joe Biden a racist and say that she believed his accusers? 🧐
Yeah Biden will sign the laws, she’ll enforce them, just like old times.
See, this is how effective govt can be again. Ask, and in less than 12 hours Biden/Harris delivers.
I have a good title for Harris &amp; Biden The ROOSTER &amp; The Canary Get it rooster becomes she’s a cocksucker &amp; canary because it is a bird that is used to die Its life has no valu like JOkE 👎😀🇺🇸
Yup. Now "if you don't vote for us you're racist and sexist." There was no other reason that Biden HAD to pick a woman of color.
With respect, the “America as you know it will be gone forever” is nothing more than scaremongering. There is nothing extreme about Biden, and all of the constitutional checks and balances will still be in place. Trump’s divisiveness as a tactic must be repudiated loudly in Nov.
A white dude who worked on the Clinton campaign just said I was “whitesplaining” racism when talking about Biden’s past and how Harris attacked him on it in that debate 🤨
I think using NH signs from 8 past conventions as the backdrop for the NH delegation’s morning zoom caucus will add a bit of convention excitement. Not that  need to get any more excited than we are! Biden/Harris!! #nhpolitics
Sorry, watch a video of him from 2016 and one from recently. He had dropped. Keep in mind I'm not a huge Biden fan, I have no agenda here. But trump had taken a downward turn
The same reason they picked her for VP She is another empty vessel like Joe Biden They don’t have to worry about her going rogue like Barack Obama 👎😀🇺🇸
History was made today 8-11-2020: the first African American woman - of Jamaican and SouthAsian descent - will be the running mate to #Biden, the presumptive Democratic Nominee for President of the United States. Kamala's mother was a trailblazer herself! #WomenSupportingWomen
This how Joe Biden started out?
President Biden. VP Kamala. Senate Majority Leader Warren.  I MEAN COME ON.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden  #BidenHarris #BidenHarris2020
Ridiculous. Neither Biden nor Harris support socialism. This life-long GOP voter (until Trump) will never support the current GOP ticket, nor will I vote for anybody who doesn’t distance themselves from Trump.
As long as you don't Force anything, you still got my vote. But know wavering, I get any word your forcing vaccines, and I'll buy the whole town Biden signs.
She was really impressive! Really excited by Biden/Harris!
Far left radical? Seriously have you met Biden? #TrumpFailedAmerica #TrumpHatesWomen #Trumpisacrybaby #TrumpIsARacist
But that doesn’t make Biden competent. It’s a valid concern.
Remember when Kamala Harris said she believed women who accused Biden of inappropriate touching?
Flashback: #KamalaHarris said she believed women who accused #Biden of inappropriate touching #BidenHarris2020 #lol #Metoo
would not vote for her but I can see her as pres more than I can see Biden.
Just so we're very clear.  Biden &amp; Harris were not in the most corrupt administration in American history, didn't destroy the economy, let 160,000 Americans die or inflame the streets of America by being racists, nope that's the impeached Trump &amp; his toady Pence. #nhpolitics
Biden/Harris 2020 I'm all in.
Hey Peter should we start quoting the brilliant Joe Biden?
This is a c/p pitch for the Hillary 2016 campaign, no? Or yes, but Hillary was perceived as a b*tch so this is different? The overton window moves faster than this pick (or Biden for that matter).
Now the narrative becomes if you don't vote for Biden Harris you're a racist.
Gonna be interesting to see the Trump campaign continue trying to push the Biden wants to defund the police line after Biden picked one for VP.
With the news of Biden's #VPPick, it is time to bring this back. Tulsi &gt; Kamala Harris. #BidenHarris2020 #KamalaHarrisForVP
Who's got the Biden Harris lawn signs? I need one!
What a joke.  I first met Joe Biden in Manchester in 1980. For 40 years Joe Biden has been a strong and consistent friend of NH. But I can imagine how shook you are about the   ticket winning NH big! #nhpolitics
Where am I in the Biden picture?
Biden chose harris...if they win were fucked
She did say that she believes Biden's sexual accusers though.
Awesome news.  Awesome choice. Awesome ticket.  Let's do this!  Biden-Harris 2020
And... she *is* to Biden’s left. So while it’s not a huge nod to the left... it’s not, oh... Pete.
Very happy for the Democratic ticket of Biden/Harris! I was lucky enough to meet both spouses of the future President and Vice-President!
I’m sorry but I utterly despise Harris. She’s an unapologetic authoritarian who will step on and destroy anyone she can for power. Her record as a prosecutor is atrocious. I will never ever vote for Trump, but this just made voting for Biden a lot harder for me. We’ll see.
Biden's pick causes DOW to go down over 100 points,

Biden + Harris, two Democrats responsible for incarcerating more black men than every current Republican combined.

I’m not crying but I’m not clapping either. This is basically the choice between suicide or lifelong depression and general anxiety disorder. Clearly Trump is going to kill us. Biden Harris are just going to make us wish we were dead. But I will #VoteBlueNoMatterWho
Does the least harm to the Biden ticket.  Rice would have fed the Benghazi lunatics. And Warren is a) also old, b) white, and c) too far to Biden’s left for Biden to be happy.   Not the ticket I wanted, but that got decided long ago.  Predictable.  Trump must go, so... ok.
They just posted some Biden/Harris swag and I saved the image
Dad just called to tell me that he, my stepmom &amp; their dog are all very excited about Biden picking Harris (I could hear the dog barking and my stepmom yelling "Yeah!!") He said: "Pence won't know what hit him in the debate and we'll get rid of that crook Trump!" #nhpolitics
Great.  Can we move on now?  lol  BIDEN 2020
President Biden, Vice President Harris, 2020 - 2024.

CNN reporting that Joe Biden has selected Kamala Harris as his running mate
Kamala Harris picked by Joe Biden as running mate
There it is. Biden's VP pick is one of his challengers from the 2020 Primary.
Joe Biden selects Kamala Harris as his running mate
Are we really going to find out Today or Tomorrow. All day yesterday they said Biden was going to announce her but that never happened. #Biden2020 #RidenWithBiden2020
So if this started off with the GOP signaling to black people that they think they’re stupid and will vote for Kanye over Biden, and ends with the GOP getting Kanye sent to prison, does that help or hurt their standing with minority voters?
I think you mistyped that. It was supposed to be "top advisers told Joe Biden this morning who his VP pick is."
Biden should show up at the press conference and make the announcement there!  (with a mask on of course)
I do not care if Biden's plan is to sleep the entire time!  We need to unite, break voter turnout records and vote Trump out!  Every single message should at least mention getting registered and vote.  NH Democrats must turn out in record numbers on 11/3!
Voting for Biden
Like Biden, lots of meds.
Imagine if Biden pledged to only consider a man? If you think that would be sexist, you agree that Biden saying the same about only choosing a woman is too.
Karine Jean-Pierre will be Biden’s Running Mate’s Chief Of Staff.
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO IT IS!  VOTE FOR BIDEN!
If Mr. Biden were my parishioner, I would have to follow the example of those brave priests who have denied him Communion.
Or, just spitballing, Biden wouldn't stand up and say he's not taking responsibility, and actually take responsibility, like a real leader, and do something about covid.
“GYM” Jordan the masochist and it would only take one good punch and hed be knocked out, by a woman nonetheless.   Sexual misconduct should never have allowed him to get this far.   We need people that are above reproach like Joe Biden !
If America wants Barack Obama to be president for another 8 years then vote for Joe Biden 👎😀🇺🇸
Obama, without question!    Next to Obama, 2nd would be President Biden and 3rd would be Hillary Clinton!
Biden’s V.P. Pick Is Said to Be Imminent
Wait you said you're voting for Biden but you have no tolerance for stupidity, deranged leadership confused message and destroying the constitution.   So which is it?
Can I order two Biden/Warren 2020 yard signs?
YES!!!!! Another incredible N.H. Primary alum is rising in the ranks! Turn PA Biden Blue,
Where Joe Biden lives and where Donald Trump holds campaign speeches are two completely unrelated things but you knew that didn’t you?
And what does my race have to do with anything?
Biden's plan? Let Trump talk.
Obama wasn't a Progressive either. He was a centrist. You just don't understand the terms. Cops are fine, but with a current progressive effort to defund police departments and get cops under control in America, a cop might not be the best person to do it.
I'd rather watch a loop of Biden on his bicycle. #RidinWithBiden2020
Democrats must have a reckoning with their past not ours. Slavery, KKK, Jim Crow, Biden’s crime bill, ect. Only then can America heal.
I love Bernie Sanders with all my heart, but if people vote for Bernie this November simply because he’s on the ballot... that would divide Biden’s votes. Do NOT vote Bernie in Nov. I wish it could have been different but it’s not. We can’t have any more of Trump. #VoteBiden2020
Shitcago isn’t Joe Biden’s Zoo! 🙄
Aided/abetted by U media clowns becuz  doesn’t put up with your non stop anti American bs. Lies, hoax’s and anti American rhetoric piled upon us by  has caught up, now go ahead push Alzheimer’s Biden and shit on us some more. #Trump2020Landslide
Honestly, whether Biden is up 7% or 9/10% nationally doesn't make a world of difference when it comes to the outcome. He would win solidly in any of these scenarios, only places where it'd make a difference would be like GA/TX/OH/IA/ME-2 etc after Biden's already at 334 EVs.
She's a COP! She spent her career LOCKING PEOPLE UP. I don't like that. That's not progressive. I don't need to do research because I've been watching for the past 50 years. Progressive is a platform she does not support so STFU!
BIDEN SUPPORTS KKK
The stakes could not be higher in November. It is going to take us all rallying around the Democratic ticket to save the soul of our nation.   I hope you will tune in to the Democratic Convention next week and do everything you can to elect Joe Biden in November!
Joe Biden will reestablish America leading by example and put us in a position to address the challenges ahead.
Joe Biden has plans filled with actionable policies to address racial inequities in criminal justice, housing, health care, and so many more areas in a real way.   The current president does not.
Joe Biden knows how to get our economy back, distribute an eventual COVID vaccine, and prevent the spread of future epidemics.   The current president does not.
No...Joe Biden is a sick old man that will turn the country over to the far left. You know so much about Trump, why not Biden ?
Sounds like Biden's advice to his son
BTW I’m a huge AOC supporter and will be thrilled to see her as part of Biden’s administration. Cuz that’s how we evolve ya know?
If you buy that she's a progressive. More than Bernie or EW? I call bullshit. Kamala Harrtis is a centrist.
Trump better be ready for the debate because Biden is faking it.
im not paying Joe Biden to speak from  HIS Basement i am paying for the Trader and chief  to talk from white house TAX Dollars
Nope.  More than anything, I’m voting to *remove* Trump.   Biden is, eh, acceptable. And he could select something found forgotten the back of the fridge and I’d still vote for him.  Does it matter? A hell of a lot, yes. In so many ways. But won’t change my vote.   Will not.
I don’t care who the VP is, Biden has my vote. ❤️
#Biden doing the traitor thing again. I want a president that does not salute communist countries!
We can not let this happen! An American president spending our tax dollars on Americans is just once again proving how crazy Biden is! #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
You lost all your credibility when you tried to say with a straight face that Biden is in a better mental state than Trump.
Ok.  But do you think that, in terms of mental competence, it is worse to mispronounce words like Trump, or not know where you are, what you're doing, what your name is, or who your wife is, like Biden
Ok again fine. But regardless of your opinion of Trump at least be honest and recognize that Joe Biden barely knows what's going on.
He has legitimately not known what state, city, or location he was in multiple times. He has literally forgotten his name. You don't like Trump, fine. But you're just being dishonest or willfully ignorant if you think Biden is in a better mental state.
Great point. Trump mispronounces a couple words. Biden hasn't known where he was, or what he was running for, or even that his name was Joe Biden on multiple occasions. Definitely the same.
I thought this was from the Biden campaign: #RIPKamala 😶
Her only weakness, as I saw it was health care, but that has to be worked from a position of power. No one can say how to pay medicare for all until they can view all the revenue streams. Would you rather give a friend $ to buy food or to buy a gun?
Never Trumpers are being paid huge dollars to support Biden.
Biden and his elite friends force poor black children into failing schools. Why?
He acting like Biden  by saying he comes from a blue collar family Scaramucci is an idiot 👎😀🇺🇸
She talks like Biden have them talk at the same time to get a complete sentence 👎😀🇺🇸
Now we know why he's voting Biden.
President Trump supports religious freedom, while Biden goes to pander.
LOL! President Biden!
If Kanye Somehow Stays in the Presidential Race, It'll Hurt Trump, Not Biden  via
They way Biden is campaigning, he welcomes any distraction!
Making ridiculous mistakes is not the same as literally not knowing where you are. Lesser of two evils I know. Although Trump is not the smartest tool in the shed, Biden is starting to not know what is even going on.
Right. Just like the assumption should be that Biden can't run a country because he forgets where he is or what he is talking about more often than not.
Trump can't ride a bike? Is that supposed to be a big win for you? Did you "get him." Quick question. Is Biden still making horrifically racist comments on a daily basis on live TV?
Thought it was Biden
Is Joe Biden Actually Trying To “Hurt God?” Trump Says He Is, So It Must Be True Erin Corbett August 6, 2020, 5:35 PM  NO—Joe Biden would never ever try to hurt God.  Trump has come up with more lies over 30,000 in 3 years
Thanks for saying. I think it is high time for a Progressive to have a seat at the table. Bernie supporters are still licking their wounds from 2016, let alone 2019. We had 8 years of centrists with Obama/Biden and the people are ready to have a voice that considers the people.❣️
Is Trump just trying to get votes away from Biden by introducing a “wildcard” nominee? Like is Kanye the new Jill Stein?
It's OK, he's Looking for the correct Progressive for the job!?! 😳  Why Joe Biden Keeps Missing His Own V.P. Deadlines
I voted for the guy and I will again Biden would be an even worse choice
Yep, but you have to remember that he’s only capable of thinking 10 minutes ahead. All he cares about is getting re-elected. By the time people realize what the truth is, it’ll be too late. If he’s still president, he’ll invent another scheme. If not, he’ll blame  Biden.
Being genuine here, what convinces you that Biden is going to win? I seem to have no hope we're going to get Trump out :/. ESPECIALLY given the sloppy campaigning - I feel like their doomed to repeat the same mistake 4 years ago
That plus the fact Trump simply does not know how to debate. He will make stuff up and Biden will be ready for it and slam the door on it. Then Trump will get frustrated and start with the insults and again, Biden will be ready and put an end to that. This should be spectacular!
Does anyone know about a secret deal between Obama/Biden between a high ranking sexual abusing priest in the Vatican and China that was shut down by Trump but will be reinstated if Biden wins. Just hearing about it, very complicated and sick !
Oh Biden does that all on his own every time that he speaks
Move along folk, nothing to see here:  Biden gaffes ignored by MSNBC's primetime shows for 3 straight nights  #FoxNews
Biden doing something criminal! Treason.
After Biden's comments on Black diversity, some worry blunders could impact support
How do any of Biden’s policies matter more then having a rapist in office? A man with no morals, pretending to be religious after constantly saying he is not and wishing well to pedophiles. How do you sleep at night?
My question, this followers purge - did it affect a single liberal? Can't imagine Biden's real number is over 17, so...
This " I can't believe I have to say this..." on Biden tweets is becoming so frequent it reminds me of  #ToddlerInChief posts or this bit
Yes, Saint Joe Biden, didn't he give the eulogy for kkk leader Robert Byrd AND call him a mentor AND friend? The reason for the President's blm comment is not the movement itself but the ppl associated with it that breed the hate and chaos. Nice try tho😆
Nope. The VP pick is the one move Biden can make that will dominate the news cycle   Why play his Ace now?  Only political junkies care about the VP drama.  60% of public only cares about Covid and the Economy. I wouldn’t even do it until Labor Day unless Trump closes within 6%
I am  getting tweets from Biden people attacking Trump for doing this. I hope they keep attacking him like this as it is the only way the word will get out to all the media.
While this from the  is the most explicit, the entire coverage of Biden’s potential running mate has been equally sexist.  But, YIKES.
Instagram Displayed Negative Related Hashtags For Biden, But Hid Them For Trump
I likely am, I don't see it getting better with Biden. I'm not sold he wants change, and the DNC just wants a status quo puppet. The economy, tariffs to get cash back and investing locally were pros, but he is an ass. And Biden seems like he has alzheimers which could be very sad
Have you not seen Biden's track record? His crime bill, pro-segregation stances, racist statements as of late? I'm not telling anyone who is and isn't racist, just pointing out this man surely is no straight arrow
🤣 I didn't vote in Trump, but back to my main point since you didn't read it the first time: IT DOESN'T GET BETTER UNDER BIDEN.
I wish I could be a wash out for one of the worst teams in the NFL, but instead I'm privy to knowing how big of a POS Biden is.
Biden has continually proven he's a racist shill. Nothing gets better under Biden.
Glad to see how much you love looking at other people's taxes, perhaps you should get a job at the IRS . Perhaps Biden's son would  like to show us his taxes. Also kids sometime read this site so we avoid 4 letter words.
How can there not be a similar argument for whether Trump is all there or not? Given that they both might be in mental decline -- maybe -- there's also the wealth of evidence of Trump's corruption where there is none for Biden. How does that not tip the scales in favor of Biden?
Dueling antagonists. China says 没有 to Trump; Russia says nyet to Biden. Who cares, as long as they stay on the sidelines and don't meddle.
Im shook biden just went on a rasist rant talking about black people think all alike I cant with either canidates
I'm not accusing anyone of anything. You're all just proving my point nicely. Trump's "racism" turns on subjective interpretation of what he says. Biden's racism is objectively racist.
I wouldn't be too sure of Biden winning the most votes.
Biden was heard to say :" Gee wiz man,"
Hey what if I told you that neither Biden nor Trump actually take their religious beliefs all that seriously, and saying that Catholics *must* vote for one or the other is a ridiculous false dichotomy
Another piece of fake news to disrespect our President! Put some celebrities in it because they know everything right?You people are as brainwashed as Biden! Go ahead and vote for someone that can't even put a sentence together unless someone orchestrates it for him!  Vote Trump!
If Trump could get Biden to say some thing nice about religion , God or rebuke the liberals in the media who are anti religion , then it would be a public service.
Well she is 80. Trump/Biden shouldn’t be running this country either in their mid 70’s but I digress.
Trump is racist. But as VP....you can’t say that. Sounds like Biden has moved on from her and I hope that’s true.
how can Biden have any blacks in his administration when he can not tell one from another ?
My point is that when Trump says very fine people you have to assume that he is talking about white supremacists. You have to  subjectively assign the most racist meaning to it. You don't have to assume anything with biden's racism.
Trump never said that poor kids are just as smart and talented as white kids. See Trump's supposed "racism" is subjective, determined by people who either hate him or look for racism in everything. Biden's racism is objective, overt racism.
Aside from that Biden admitted it in an interview lol
Biden faces backlash for comparing diversity in African American, Latino communities  Biden has always supported the African American Community! #TrumpIsARacist
I feel bad for her, but our Country had 'high grade' depression for eight long years during #Obama / #Biden. Stagnant economy Poor race relations Increased government dependency etc...
In November we will. That is as long as Joe Biden is POTUS
And before you think it because I hate trump, I do, but that's not it. I would feel the same for any president, especially one as old and questionable as trump or Biden. No pres should have unchecked power.
If the VP doesn't come from the Progressive side, Biden's in trouble. He doesn't even know it.
When President Johnson sent young blacks to Vietnam , it was murder and he lost all claim to his humanity. When Bill Clinton talked to leaders on the phone while being s----ed off by an aid or extorted money for his foundation it was immoral, as it was for Biden with what he did.
Oh the good old days , when Biden got naked in front of the woman voters , and extorted money for his son, or defended the KKK
2 fearless interviews for Trump , 0 "You on drugs, all blacks are the same " for Biden .
Biden is against blankets and toaster!
Trump Moves to Ban TikTok...  Teens deliver presidency to Biden.
Nah. My employer, my family and my fiance won't expect me to apologize for not wanting Biden to be president. And my fiance is a Biden supporter. Crazy right.
Lol I don't need your forgiveness. And I'm ready either way. I don't think he's going to lose, but if he does so be it. I'm not going to cry about it for the 3 months until Biden's VP takes over.
Well I've seen all the liberal propoganda outlets you get your news from. As fun as this is. I'm done here. Have a good night and good luck with Biden
#Biden believes he owns the Black community. #Biden2020 can not be anymore racist.
Historian who has accurately called every election since 1984 says Biden will beat Trump in 2020 race
My opinion is the same that you are trying to make of Biden. I don't think Trunp is a racist, but he has said some insensitive things.
The things that you're quoting are racist only if you look for race in everything. What Biden had said are objectively racist.   Also technically the Haiti and shit hole country comments would be xenophobic, not racist.
Biden also said he doesn't want his kids living in a racial jungle.
No but Biden did say "poor people are just as smart as white people"  Also the Mexican quote is not accurate. He said some of the illegal immigrants coming from Mexico are rapists. He did not say Mexicans are rapists.
I was referring to Biden
CNN is propoganda. All news outlets are propoganda.  There is a comparison. Trump has never said anything overtly racist. Biden has on many occasions said openly racist things.    Either way. Your comment said Biden isn't racist, but you just admitted he was.
That can’t be right how can Biden choose Rice.  What a ticket of half wits.
If elected president, Joe Biden will do God like he did Corn Pop.
You're telling me, in a year that ANY Democrat can beat Donald Trump, Joe Biden is the man?? The best?? 👌
I’ll walk barefoot on glass to vote for Joe Biden, but boy do I want her to be the VP!
I'll not lecturing. I'm just trying to help you shake those delusions. If you believe Trump is racist but Biden isn't, youre clearly delusional.
Agree it’s an outlier just not a huge one. 40% is what McConnell’s Democratic rivals traditionally get. Also nationally undecideds are breaking towards Biden but in a deep red state undecideds will break towards Trump. They disagree with Trump but are. primed to hate liberals
Well, it is true. There is no "if." Biden and Obama built the cages. But hey don't let facts get in the way of your tantrum.
#joebiden accidentally says what all Liberals think!! Watch !!  Biden raises eyebrows with remark contrasting African American, Latino diversity  #FoxNews
Biden will hurt sandal sales and he hates tables.
I’m pretty sure we can just swap out Biden for Chuck Norris in all those memes if he can hurt god.
Biden Is going to hurt hats. We will never recover.
He talks about Joe Biden yet he can’t finish one damn sentence
Biden is against Mac and cheese . Biden is against flip flops. Biden is against air conditioning.  has lost his freaking mind.
Under which pretext will Joe Biden be removed as a candidate?
This is not just Trump v. Biden. This is Trump v. united    Biden has twice as many gen election wins than Trump. Obama/Biden ticket carried NH twice, Trump lost. (If you include FITN both Trump &amp; Biden are tied)   won 6 of last 7 (86%) prez races.   #nhpolitics
Biden has a lot of experience with that his whole family are on drugs Usually you say what is true about yourself so maybe we should stop calling him senile &amp; call him a COKEHEAD Cocaine overdose may result in brain damage That explains everything 👎😀🇺🇸
I tell my friends all the time Trump isn't going to make it till Nov election he is going to resign  and have Pence Pardon him and His whole family that's why Rudy has been around to make that deal I bet its been talked about for a long time Trump can't take chance Biden beats
Does anyone really believe that Joe Biden is the face of abolition of police and seizure of guns?
Oh no! First Obama didnt do it and now Biden will? I don’t believe it
Absolutely.  It is simply nuts and way out of hand.  I am so angry with the democratic leadership.  They only want this violence to continue b/ they somehow think it will help Biden get into office.  WRONG!!  I am an independent who loves Trump!81% of people saying they'll vote by mail are Biden supporters.  67% of people saying they'll vote in person are Trump supporters.  Even Donald Trump can do that math.
Hick would be running way behind biden, but he wins narrowly anyway. it looks like bullock probably wins to get the Dems to 51... IA looks like it’s going down to the wire, so another narrow Iowa election might happen-carrying echoes of the dem primary so many months before
I see Bernie signs more than I see Biden signs  I also see Trump signs more than any other #Trump2020
🤢🤮 what about the “I believe Joe Biden’s accusers” which was said...  NOT DURING A DEBATE!!  I guess what she’s telling us is not to believe anything she says during a debate because... “it’s a debate”
Good point. I didn't vote for the worst POTUS in American history. I'm voting for Biden/Harris
No-one is safe from the utter contempt that Joe Biden has for actual people
The one unambiguously good thing about Joe Biden is how thoroughly he owns the Pod Save bros and their Democratic Insider grift by ignoring them every single day.
You are a despicable piece of tyrranic filth. I hope Biden eviscerates you in November and you wind up in prison for the damage you have done to this country for the past four years.
What are the rules? Kamala Harris is born of 2 immigrants, not citizens at that time, making her ineligible to be President, correct? I’m asking. Should Biden have to step down (if he by a miracle won), Pelosi (if Dems retain the House) would then become President? Right?! Yikes!
Biden Has Broken a Longstanding American Tradition &amp; May Cost Him the Election

Dementia Donnie thinks he’s Biden now?
Your ignorance and incompetence has ruined this country, but Biden will fix is just like Obama repaired the wreckage Bush left.
When Biden is elected I hope these people can get the mental healthcare they desperately need.
Your correct, I voted for POTUS Obama and I'm voting Biden/Harris on November 3rd from NH
Truthfully, I believe she is looking at it short term for the relief everyone needs, but playing longball on a Biden/Harris administration doing a tax structure before Reagan and his Trickle Down
the election for president is for more than just NH, it's for the entire country. Biden/Harris would be better for the country overall even if they didn't focus on NH as much.
I mean, do you need any clearer indication of how Kamala Harris will say whatever she needs to say to get coverage than this? She's the perfect Biden VP in that she stands for nothing but protecting a viciously carceral state
Many of my fellow postal workers voted for Trump. Over 600,000 employees affected. Those are lots of votes that could go for Biden now.
Shit maybe Kamala Harris and Joe Biden will win in November
How did Politico know Kamala Harris was Joe Biden’s VP pick back in July when he probably still doesn’t know who he picked.
There was a reason that Obama and Biden's pants always had worn knees. I mean this figuratively, of course.

Great speech from Joe Biden. Terrific speech from Kamala Harris. Sometime you can feel the chemistry, this is good chemistry, Biden-Harris.  ⁦Just what America needs.  ⁦ #nhpolitics #JoeBiden2020 #BidenHarris2020
Biden said one of the reasons he chose Harris, in a word: “possibilities.”
Report: Harris Wasn't Biden's First Choice
Another Devastating Biden Ad from Team Trump
You’re not kidding. “vote Blue, we have scientists rather than the My Pillow guy!” and “Biden can drink water with one hand!” Oh how far we’ve fallen in less than 4 years.
Kamala Harris as VP will be impactful but can we also just take a minute to reflect upon how lucky we will be to have Dr. Jill Biden as our First Lady.  #WomenSupportingWomen #WomenInPolitics #BidenHarris2020 #VOTE #BlueWave2020
Kamala blasted Biden with fatal historical points, but yesterday just laughed and said it was a debate! Haha. There is no doubt that she is very intelligent, but also no doubt that she will lie, and accept anything, if it is in her personal best interest. She is not principled.
I'm not overly religious, but Biden is definitely Catholic.  Get your facts straight!
YES. YES.  YES.  Biden’s choice proves he’s neither afraid nor threatened to embrace those with different views from his own - GREAT choice!
Biden's VP pick slow jammed the news on  as a Presidential Candidate.  Let's watch, shall we? 😁
The game is on, for the next three months, and I've lost my patience for trying to be conversational with stupidity. The future of this country rests on voting Trump &amp; minion out, and if you're anti Trump, and still bashing Biden/Harris, you're helping their cause.
#Bioheatfuel  on #GSBiofuels: What the Kamala Harris VP Pick Means for Biden’s Energy and Climate Platform
Kamala Harris: A Tireless Champion For Health Care   Today, Vice President Joseph Biden announced Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate. Brad Woodhouse, Executive Director of Protect Our Care, released the following statement in response:
Hell, I would vote for Joe Biden if his veep pick was a juggling mime.  Whatever it takes to get  the f*ck out of the White House.
Ask about the Biden charges please
Not sure 🤔 Biden is a placeholder to be replaced at the last minute due to “health problems” I suspected Michelle Obama to be put in his place. Now, I’m not sure who will actually be running for President?

Me two, and I am proud that I can tell my daughters I am voting for Biden-Harris
Let the campaign begin, Biden-Harris. Hope is alive
the joe biden store website is down LMFAOOOOOOO
literally RIGHT after my friend and i were discussing the VP and i was about to get into the shower mr biden sends me a mf text
Incredible that we went through months of Veepstakes where multiple women were publicly hung out to dry by an extremely sexist process only to arrive at the choice everyone assumed Biden would make in March.
In 2008 the ticket of Barack Obama &amp; Joe Biden looked like America. In 2020 the team of Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris looks even more like America (Mr. President &amp; Madam Vice President)  #JoeBiden2020 #nhpolitics
I am anxiously waiting to cast my ballot for the Biden-Harris ticket!!  will make an incredible Vice President will do a great job wiping the debate stage with Pence.
If you are referring to Biden, I don't believe it says that.
Not nice. Biden is an asshole! I don't wish him harm. He can do that on his own.
Google "Joe Biden naked at pool" and find the US News and World Report article.
Have you googled the Biden material? I checked it before I posted.
Worships him? You really don't get the argument...and probably don't want to. Between Biden and Trump, Biden would be so terrible for the American public as he really cannot think well and clearly looks like he is in stage 3 of the Reisberg Scale.
It’s serious mental illness &amp; I had no idea it was such an epidemic here. Biden will make sure they get the help they need though.
Biden can’t win being the anti Trump. He has to detail a vision worth replacing an incumbent. People are loathe to change from the devil they know without solid promise of a better future.
Big Numbers, Electoral Map 334 - BIDEN        125 - trump              79- undecided
This week  touted a "data-driven campaign. (  Also this week  sent a mailer with a wrong address for a ballot app, couldn't even say who the mailers went to &amp; now we know many Dems received them. (  #nhpolitics
Hopefully all of us!  And ditto here--no matter who Biden picks for veep, he's got my vote.

2020 Election Predictions: If Trump wins: COVID "crisis" continues indefinitely If Biden wins: COVD ends within a week so he gets credit for economic rebound. If  wins: media forgets about COVID, spends years figuring out how the duopoly was ended. #LetHerDebate
Please Rob, get real. The Democrats have rendered our votes useless in recent years! Bernie had more votes than HRC, yet they pushed her down our throats. Now 4 years later, they're doing the same thing but with Biden. His temper won't win him any favors - not for the people!!

Definitely a tactic.   If he stays quiet the media will be bored and perhaps focus on Biden’s blunders one right after the other 🤦‍♂️
Really cannot recommend this piece enough. Re-read it again and again. It is a truly damning indictment of one of the many ways Joe Biden is an utterly inadequate avatar for this current moment. He is an insulting solution to our really urgent problems.

I'll say it until I'm #BlueNoMatterWho in the face: Joe Biden is a spectaculary unqualified and destitute choice as an antidote to Trump. He will improve this country in exactly one way and make it worse in so many others.
This article by  on how the  campaign has engaged in a racist and sexist public talent show for its VP slot is spectacularly good. As she predicted months ago, the campaign has hung every woman it is considering out to dry.
Quite funny when Biden said he's not far left. He must be lying.

Oh no! First Obama didnt do it and now Biden will? I don’t believe it
He’ll never legalize the weed. I almost didn’t vote for Obama in ‘08 because of Biden, but I needed health insurance and my boss didn’t have an employee plan.  I couldn’t buy my own because I had “back pain within the past 10 years”.
