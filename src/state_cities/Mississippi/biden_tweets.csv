He has been a part of the swamp for decades, he comes off much more competent than the Biden.   His politics are even better than the leftist puppet Biden has becomel
. Roman Catholics are voting for Trump en masse.  Biden and Pelosi’s claims of faith don’t matter.  They’re avowed secularists, clearly.  Kamala Harris will pay for her transgressions against the Knights of Columbus if she’s nominated.
Joe Biden got the keys to the Indians twitter or what?
. I worry about the Pacific Supply Chain if Biden is elected.  The only U.S. Pacific port that isn’t deep Blue politically is Coos Bay, Oregon.
is racist garbage! Biden will still get 99 percent of the African American vote.
and this is someone who is so delusional to believe Biden is a good candidate, or even really mentally incapable of serving out his term. Let him come out and answer questions on policy, on how he would address the Pandemic, on Policing issues. Not through press releases
Trump campaign ad manipulates three images to put Biden in a ‘basement’
I absolutely love Ana! She is a huge Joe Biden supporter and she will be great in this role!
So the “GRABBER” thinks he can speak for AAs. Not offended by what Biden said but I am offended by what you just implied. You don’t think for AAs, and we know you hate them. SOBs, Cent Park 5, don’t rent to (C) coloreds, no AAs counting your money, the suburbs, etc....
I read the transcript of Biden’s original garbled remarks. I see what he was imprecisely trying to say. I see why Black citizens could take offense. He apologized. He clarified.  What else can he do? This bullshit Dennis is doing is just that.
Biden should ask him at the debate if he was thinking of Stormie Daniels when he misspoke Thighland.
Biden said a racist thing
That's pretty much right. Trumpers try to claim Biden has low mental abilities, while Trump flutters around like a deranged cuckoo bird.
Just have questions selected,  let President Trump answer and play videos of biden o the topics
I would crawl over broken glass. I would wait however long it takes to cast a vote for Biden #RidenWithBiden2020
If Joe Biden does not debate, ask a group of reporters to select questions and just playback Joe's stupid gaffes about the subject.
It is a damn shame that they are promoting and pushing Joe Biden,who obviously has dementia. That's elderly abuse. He will not debate you because it will expose the shell of a person he is.

Commission rejects President Trump's push to add debate against Biden
I keep seeing y'all tweet out that short Biden clip. I understand y'all don't like the guy but y'all keep falling for that same shit.
Joe Biden lost his wife and a child in an accident after he first became a senator. More recently, he lost a son to brain cancer. I bet he has prayed to God a million times or more.  I know this: Only God can answer prayer. Only God gets to choose who is against Him!
Your dear leader benefits from an economy that Obama built. BTW black unemployment had the biggest drop under Obama. Facts! What Biden hasn’t  done is refer to AA’s as SOBs and ask for the death penalty for five innocent ppl or not rent to “C’s”.
I say to Joe Biden it’s Easy to be a Bleedinfheart when your giving Away Taxpayers Money. Illegal people should Get ZERO from our Government except a criminal charge and put on the Mexican side of the Wall that President Trump is building!!!  That’s IT !!!
Biden is a fucking shit show

So Tickle Me Biden has a catchphrase too?
Joe Biden, builder of the Godhammer
Trump dissed your father. Biden went on the View and comforted you after you cried over your father’s cancer diagnosis. The choice is clear.
Look, if Biden can hurt God we don't want to risk his wrath, is all I'm saying.
WHO GAVE BIDEN MY GODSLAYER BLADE?!
I want Biden to pick a VP just so the Twitter pundits will give it a rest for five minutes.
Y’all really want me to vote for Biden for the sake of getting Trump out? Them really my options...
Little biden is a dingy and a maroon
There were like 51 democratic debates and Biden was just fine. They keep trying to make this an issue and it's not.
Trump campaign ad against Joe Biden contains a number of doctored images, CNN and WaPo report
I’ve basically come to the point in the election year where all I do is watch Biden gag reels. It’s magically awful haha.
Wow!  What’s Biden’s platform? Who is being polled? I know of no one who has been polled. Wake up American. Biden’s position has changed on many things. He isn’t the Joe Biden we have known.
We really about to be forced to vote for joe Biden
This is not your normal presidential race.
This is not your normal presidential race.
“You can test too much”    “Read the manuals”       I can care less how much Biden has fallen off over the years, he isnt this dumb.
Joe Biden will not come to Milwaukee for DNC
Can’t say that idea is better.  He isn’t. The whole Democratic Party is corrupt.. if you are not voting Trump then you either are voting Biden and abortion, LGBTQ and open borders etc. I am in no way saying Trump is a moral man. He has done more than the Democrats.
Former Vice President Joe Biden is no longer traveling to Milwaukee to accept the Democratic presidential nomination, according to a report.
Democrats are going to use the enept post office to try to  the election ,but people are wishing up on Joe Biden and know he would be a disaster for our country as we as his progressive radical liberal VP choice .
Joe Biden will.
It’s weird... I’ve seen neither Trump nor Biden signs... anywhere....
Triggered much? Did you actually watch Biden’s interview on talking about defund the police?
Biden gone pick a black woman running mate and thats gonna be their reason to do nothing for black people, another symbolic victory
Easy, they’ve never actually watched a Biden speech.  They’ve seen a couple edited FB clips and run w it.
I surely will do just that. Biden in 2020!
when he got elected after the bus interview with Billy Bush coming out, he pretty much was set for 4 years. It just falls on people to get out and vote. That 3rd party sh*t ain't going to cut it this time. Either you vote Biden or pretty much guarantee 4 more years of Trump.
Biden has been in Washington for 30 plus years.  Not what’s needed.
they need to debate like now. i just wanna see trump destroy biden
Here’s something: if you’re a Democrat don’t demonize Trump supporters. There are reasons why they voted for him.  Trumpeters: don’t demonize Dems because there are reasons why people want to vote for Biden.  🤷‍♂️
We could have 20 debates and Joe Biden would mop Donald Trump's ass all over the stage.
I think it’ll be to Biden’s advantage if there’s no audience. The Orange buffoon plays to a crowd. I hope he creeps up on Joe like he did HRC in 2016 and Joe throat punches him.
We All know that Joe Biden CAN’T handle the World Stage. I don’t know what kind of BS these Lowlife Democrats are trying to Pull but it’s BAD I do know that. No American would actually think that she’ll of a man could be President of this Country there’s a Master Plan
Those slick ads are gonna have Joe Biden in them the SECOND ole dude gets in there

Sad but true. I do NOT like Biden or his politics, but some sort of dementia ultimately afflicts - what is it, one of three aging or aged adults (and some younger ones, too)? So at a human level, not a political one,  I feel great compassion for him.
If Biden wins, many of may have to leave.
As Joe Biden nears the announcement of his vice presidential choice, the top contenders and their advocates are making final appeals.
Not everything is political. Someone could put a Biden flag on a boat and pass by also. I know there are not many Biden supporters with boats but any of them could do it...
. Right, let’s all vote for Biden.  We can tank Wall Street with ballot harvesting and kill Main Street with the virus.
Unfollowed, per your request. Biden is in full-scale dementia - there are videos showinig helpers holding his elbow to guide him on the street. You REALLY want a senile puppet int he WH? Really?
I am getting older 61 years.  I feel bad Biden is losing his memory and cognitive assets but to me, he shouldn’t run for Pres. The people around him are using him and his wife Jill is No. 1 idiot!!!
Vote for JOE BIDEN!
A UNION WORKER'S RESPONSE TO JOE BIDEN (back in March before he had totally lost it), on taking our AR-14s (?) and AR-16s (?) and 100-round clips (?), none of which exists except in poor Biden's demented state:
This is such a lame attempt to give the Biden team cover for even considering skipping the debates.   I can’t imagine a legit scenario where the three presidential debates don’t happen. Biden knows he has to debate Trump.
Conflabulation - Joe Biden
So  went to Cuba with the Venceremos Brigade and spoke at the opening of a new Scientology center in her district a decade ago.  No matter whom  chooses I am sure we will hear blown-out-of-proportion negatives about them.  If you support Biden, chill out.
One week into trump's presidency he started taking credit for the economy. He hadn't signed one bill. Hadn't passed any new legislation at that time. As usual he hijacked the accomplishment of someone else and claimed it as his own. Biden will fix his mess like Obama fixed Bush's
Haven't heard anything from Tulsi Gabbard in quite a while. Anyone know which rock she is hiding under, after having endorsed a senile idiot like Joe Biden for President?
Biden told reporters this week that he would “have a choice in the first week of August.”

Don’t believe it? See the WSJ article “the Biden Manifesto”
I remember in the spring/early summer, Biden said August 1. Tomorrow is August 1.
I really wish it was this guy instead of Joe Biden :(
Thanks for having me,  I’m glad to see  working to level the playing field for Black farmers. We can #BuildBackBetter together.
Fuck yeah guess I'm voting for Biden  BLOOD AND CHAOS 2020
Good, but let’s stay consistent and ban all racists. Including Joe Biden!
Best column I've seen in a while: "Before Mr. Biden’s transformation, the question facing voters was 'Do you support Donald Trump?' The question now is, 'Are you willing to endanger the economy and your freedom to end the Trump presidency?'” via
You did not seriously think the DNC would let Biden appear in public for an extended period? What if he had to have a conversation, or even change his diaper?
Well, Joe Biden can still have rally’s!
why do you never talk about Joe Biden , always talking about Trump it’s not funny ....
Imagine not voting for trump because he’s racist and sexist and turning around to vote for Biden. It’s just silly at this point.
you gonna apologize to Biden now?
THERE IS NO DEBATE!!!
I remember when Obama said just a few months ago that Joe Biden just doesn’t have (IT)! But I guess Joes it must have been COVID 19! So now Obama backs sleepy Joe 😴!
It’s ridiculous considering how many runs Joe Biden made.
Since Biden has clearly said he will be in office most likely one term, Harris as VP opens her up  for President for the next two terms and that scares the crap out of them. A female POC as POTUS!! This is a polite way of telling her to stay in her place!
I believe Biden will take NC. Not sure on GA yet.
The Black woman is "too ambitious" for daring to run for POTUS once. Meanwhile, Biden unsuccessfully ran for POTUS multiple times before Obama picked him and was never once referred to as "too ambitious"
LMAO that Joe Biden is advertising on my YouTube channel for my new song "Welfare Worker" You can't make this S up!   #Merica #MAGA2020 #TrumpTrain
I don’t know about the rest of you Taxpayers but Joe Biden wants to Forgive Collage Loans for the very people who are Burning our Country Flag and Toppling History. Not ME !!!
We’re dealing with an existential threat right now known as Donald Trump. Whether it’s Biden, Sanders or Warren, it will take either one a while to clean up the mess. We’re gonna play catch-up with the pandemic for months. That has to be addressed before we can do anything else.
I wanted someone that would push an agenda like FDR and that person was Warren.   Now that she is outta the race - let me say this, and knowing first hand directly the dysfunction with this administration   Biden would get us back to having a functional government
2/Biden will, at least, deliver some goods, even if it’s not all of what we want. He also won’t allow the pandemic to go unchecked.
1/That’s what they don’t seem too get. Biden sounds more progressive now than I thought he would. Yes, I rather he be a Sanders/Warren progressive, and I want corporate money out of politics, but we’ll get absolutely none of what we want with Trump.
A vote for anyone other than Biden is a vote for Trump.
As the fourth pillar of Joe Biden’s Build Back Better Agenda, he is announcing how he will make a direct investment to advance racial equity as part of our nation’s economic recovery. Learn more:
I have to. I didn’t use any of those tropes. I understand that non stop negative backfires. LP CAN do this so let’s try to have perspective is my point.  For what reason do Dems listen? They are already voting Biden. My point. These are vanity exercises ... good ones.. but.
With fewer than 100 days until the presidential election, presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden has announced he will choose his running mate next week.Fuck Joe Biden

Hidin’ Biden: “There Will Not Be Another Foot of Wall Construction in My Administration”…In 2006, He Supported a Border Wall
It's not an effective term for people who claim to want to unite the left. And there are just socially accepted topics to be a 'wokescold', many of the people who use it will shame people for supporting a 'rapist' if they vote Biden, for instance. Point is lots of people display—
Imagine how much time Biden can devote to trying to remember what he’s trying to get elected for. And how to tie his shoes.
Very true. I didn’t vote for Trump or Obama but can certainly acknowledge the good and bad both have done. I also won’t be voting from Trump or Biden. I haven’t voted a D or R since 2004.
Every answer will begin with “that’s a good question and let me tell you why that’s a good question “. Biden will somewhat answer the question and Trump will ramble on incoherently while patting himself on the back. I feel a headache coming on already.
Guess who's 78? Joe Biden
Getting real tired of these networks  tearing down strong women for the sake of talking points. FOH with that bullshit. In the end, we should all be rallying behind Biden to remove Mango Mussolini.
I give Biden a 20% chance of finishing his term. This vp pick is maybe the most important one ever. They likely will be president before ‘24.
The decision will be to hide it, insist on mail in ballots to lock todays poll numbers in place combined with "ballot harvesting", &amp; cancel the debates due to covid to prevent America from seeing the real state of Joe Biden
If Trump wins, riots. If Biden wins, krystalnach &amp; a pogrom against anything not leftist.
I wonder if the kid from Arkansas has met his grandfather and if it will be raised a Biden?
So true. Yet Tulsi stayed in longer then everyone else except Bernie and Biden and only got 2 delegates. They honestly just embarrass themselves
If Elected, Biden Will Reinstate Obama’s AFFH Rule Which Trump Just Canceled…It Would Allow Low-Income Housing in Suburbs
Disagree in strategy Tom. If elected,  Biden is a 1 term president. He has 2 jobs: 1) stop the trainwreck 2) pick the next President as his VP.   I don't think Kamala checks off #2.
That blank look on Biden is why they bar him from the car keys

Biden is senile..pass it on
Joe Biden and Bill Clinton showed everyone how they felt about the black and Latino communities in 1994 with the 1994 crime Bill. After Clinton signed the Bill Biden wrote! Tell me more how democrats love people of color
If your right and maybe you are, Why is Biden the best you have to offer, If your serious about us and what we deserve then step up and present someone that's competent. We do deserve better, Your shoving a racist man with no leadership ability down our throats and its scary
Wow, the lies have an extra hint of desperation these days...he will “outlaw religion” and “hurt God?” There are literally dozens of pictures of Biden praying, and I’m pretty sure the only times Trump went to church were for his multiple marriages.

I really hope we get to see trump and Biden debate. It would without a doubt be pure comedy gold. One egotistical, narcissistic moron and one confused, delusion, dementia patient arguing over things neither one of them know anything about couldn’t not be entertaining.
Not true I clicked on it and I’m not voting Biden
It's leftist mentality (feminism, blaming white males for everything wrong in the world) that has led to this. Sounds like she is probably going to vote for biden.

No, he isn't.  If you research, you'll find out that he was talking about medical testing, not cognitive testing. We have a fool and a moron as President and you are subtly suggesting that Biden take a cognitive test? Come on CNN, have President take a narcissistic behavior test.
Biden Denies Ever Taking a Cognitive Test After Claiming That He’s ‘Tested Constantly’.
It’s more sophisticated that average Americans realize for sure. Hard core Trump supporters are being fed the opposite info. That Biden supporters are determined to steal the election for the deep state. They’re sewing civil war.
Ahhhhh, Hillary came out of her cave. How's Biden doing? Is he sharing his jello? Guess since her media croonies aren't reporting on Bill she thinks it's safe now.

I predicted this after Joe Biden became the last one standing (with difficulty). Check out all the Obama sycophants surrounding old man Joe.
Joe Biden sent his own children to an elite private school, and parades as the Black Lives Matter candidate, yet his policies are openly hostile to the educational choices that offer the best chance for minority advancement.
Actually China is closer to Facism than Communism with their One China platform. Sounds a lot like hitler. Which makes their biggest supporter, Joe Biden, Mussolini.
Two other polls released today show Biden with double digit   leads, 56% to 43% Biden favorability and 53% to 42% Biden favorability. Something just doesn't jive here...
Judd, you seem well informed and a very smart man. Tell me something.  Today Rasmussen Polling has Trump's favorability at 51%, Biden at 47%?  How can that be even remotely possible? Are Americans truly that stupid and that ignorant? Is Rasmussen only polling closeted racists?
Actually, Joe Biden is only the figurehead. The man in charge would actually be Barrack Obama. Take a look at the people running the Biden campaign. There can never be a debate because everyone would see and hear that Biden is incapable of performing the duties of President.
Watch and see,Biden won’t debate!
So that's why Biden's ties with Ukraine was never headlined? Because he's rich...or is it because he's in politics? You're saying you've never heard of a rich person being charged with any crime's...ever?

What would a Joe Biden victory mean for world diplomacy?
If you vote for Joe Biden you are also voting for the Communist Chinese Government.
Also many believe that Biden if he won wouldn’t finish out his term, so his lack of good VP candidates is of real concern.  The whole I’d vote for a can of tuna thing isn’t how most democrats think, that’s just the few on twitter
They’ve seen how majority of the left is moving far left.  They don’t like trump at all as a person  but he’s a better choice than Biden, they don’t want the AOCs and Omar’s anywhere near presidential power

I agree, biden does need to be put away. But I don't want to know how you know he is a limp dick. Guess y'all have been sniffing on each other.
Everyone is focused on the death toll from covid. Has anyone considered the death toll of an election if biden wins? Just food for thought.
I just watched a 2 term black president tell mourners that John Lewis didn't do enough to secure racial equality (I won't have a straight face for quite awhile - I'll have to stop watching clips of Biden too). 😎
Oh yeah, he’ll get a pardon for the obstruction, never be charged for milking the presidency, and a dozen other federal crimes, but he will be indicted for tax fraud and money laundering. But don’t sweat it though. He’ll be out and you’ll be focused on destroying Biden by then.
I think there should be a counter/notice for every time Biden answers his remote when his cell phone rings. Come on Twitter, you can figure it out, right?
😂😂😂😂 you think Biden is gonna win 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Name one actually bad thing about Biden...
Yes, they are. It is amusing that they don't recognize why most people see them that way. They actually think that they are normal. And why Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden think that they are normal.

Biden support is soft. If he starts to go under his support will dump him fast
Trump will murder Biden in the debate.
*3 months into presidency* “president biden has reportedly signed an executive order removing the need for passwords. says that they are too hard to remember and can’t get into any of his accounts anymore.”
At this point Biden knows we don’t have a choice but to vote for him. NO CHOICE. It’s basically like he’s running against himself.
Keep in mind, Joe Biden has been running for president since 1987. And still... only 106 references to him as "too ambitious." If I include articles that mention Hillary Clinton, it goes up to 154.  13/
I searched  for "Candidate Name" + "too ambitious." Here are the results:  Al Gore: 18 Joe Biden: 106* John Kerry: 112 G.W. Bush: 150 Mitt Romney: 176 Donald Trump: 380* Barack Obama: 707* Hillary Clinton: 1,166  *Excludes ones that refer to Hillary Clinton
I'm not too concerned about any of this having an effect on Biden's decision. He's been in the game long enough, he knows how it's played.
Kind of like that Politico from the other day where Chris Dodd said she shouldn't be VP because she was mean to Biden at a debate one time.
Important to note that these are literally just Biden donors/allies who are all mad about Harris for Reasons and don't want her to be VP.
Just wondering if they have ever asked the same question of Biden supporters????
I see what you’re saying. But there is just no way I’m voting for Biden and whatever corrupt POS gets named his running mate😂 Bc we all now that senile son of a bitch won’t last two weeks
With fewer than 100 days until the presidential election, presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden has announced he will choose his running mate next week.US officials: Russia denigrating Biden ahead of election
I agree, but suppose we turn out and they inform us in a couple days that Biden lost? What then? Because if we allow a second term Putin may teach him how to never have to leave office. What do we do then? I hope it doesn’t happen, but if it does……
Quit being cruel to Biden...
Biden will never be president... stop wishing...
Biden:  “don’t make me call Corn Pop”  “Hey little girl, do you want to feel my legs?”  “Wow, you smell good.”  “Who stole my pudding?”  “Whose house am I in?”
Biden:  “well, you smooth talking negros better get your act together. Cause you ain’t black unless you vote for my old white butt”  Public: “wow, that seems really racist. We better ask a professional.  Rev. Sharpton, what do you think?”  Al: “it’s ok. That honky is a democrat”
If you claim to be a Republican and you vote for Joe Biden....  Your not a Republican.  Your not a conservative.  Don’t lie to people. Just admit you call yourself a Republican but are really a big govt progressive who is happy with keeping the DC game alive
No AG Barr arrest on Obama or Biden. They're above the law.
Trump will and is cheating to try and become a two term illegitimate president. But the stable people will not allow this to happen, trump will lose in the largest landslide Biden victory.
This is a shameful attack on a good man, no one believes trump; however this is a bridge too far. Trump does not deserve to be anywhere near Vice President Biden. Trump is sick and needs to be hospitalized!
Electing more and more democrats. American has some serious issues that’s been around long before trump. Don’t u wanna make this a better place for all? Biden can’t do that on his own. It’s our responsibility. Kicking back letting elected officials do whatever is what got us here
No AG Barr arrest on Biden. Democrats are above the law.
Wow.  And you still claim to be a “conservative”?  You know the debates will expose Biden to a national audience and they will see that you and the democrats are pushing a dementia patient for the most powerful position in the world.  If this happens why even have elections?
Hahahahaha   You said logical and Biden in the same sentence.
Excuse me but should I vote for him (Biden) because he was Obama’s Vice President? Should I vote for him because if I dont it will be a vote for Trump? Somebody anybody help me out here..
If you are voting for Joe Biden May I ask why?
Biden has too many old, white men like himself involved in the process and it’s not a good look. I will support whoever he chooses but I think he needs someone younger than Bass. In 2024 she’ll be 70– aren’t we ready to pick someone younger than that to run for POTUS in 2024?
Yes. I like Joe Biden as President.
Joe Biden will have to earn my vote. He must change his policies. At this point it is what it is. 🤷🏾‍♀️You are NOT worthy of the Black vote and how dare you attack Joe Biden’s faith. Fact: You stoke fear and racial divisions with your racist rhetoricYou are a Demagogue and you will be defeated in November. The virus is winning because of the choices you have made.
Please “silence” Biden.
One of the coolest byproducts of this is that it's forcing Christian supporters of Biden/Trump to discuss pros/cons Biblically.  Had a very painful discussion, no argument with a "woman be quiet" believer this morning.  Just dawned on me that a female VP will just kill him?!?!

Why doesn’t Biden denounce burning bibles?
So biden calls trump out for stopping  flights and now biden is saying trump did not do enough earlier 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  How do you support such   Democrats and Republicans are the same. They just take from opposite pockets
Oh you mean the poor kids and the white kids? You know... the thing??? 🤣🤣🤣 Trump has done more for minorities than any other president. As Biden put it, y'all believe the "truth" instead of facts. What a sad sad world we live in.
And how do y'all think Biden would have handled this? Remember... Trump was the one called a xenophobe for stopping those flights. He said he wished we could do something like those things to get rid of it. And the advice at the time was to save masks for first responders.
This is disrespectful on so many levels. Biden cannot hide his disdain for the Black community.
Biden just said racist remarks today. So Ohio wants that? No
Why is Biden for killing babies then? God is against murder I guess Biden is for it.
Biden didn’t come out against burning bibles!!
You think Biden goes to bed without watching Colbert? Hah.
Monday is what I think but I’m entering my official guess as Saturday at like 7am EST because Biden probably mows his lawn then. Waking me up. Fucking old dudes, man.
I don’t understand the question. Do people really not know what this means? There’s so many things you can say about Biden but remembering his dad’s driving fondly is weird? Oof. How embarrassing to be so sheltered and DSA? A group supposedly for the worker?
She claims Biden would talk down to her during meetings but it turned out she worked in the mailroom, a position she would not have been in meeting with him or have daily contact with him.
She worked in the mail room and was fired for throwing mail away. She never had daily contact with Biden.
Biden must be pretty powerful if he can hurt God tbf.
Because he’s Joe Biden. Now open pdf.
Tell me again how it's a good idea for Biden to debate Trump. Remember what I said would happen? Yeah this shit right here is a perfect example. Foot in mouth. He has always been this way folks! Smdh 🙄
#trump2020 I can’t wait to see all the Biden supporters cry when trump wins again in November 🤣
Trump does not want mail in voting because he is afraid of being voted out, but couldn't his small band of supporters do the same thing to out vote Biden? Trump doesn't want mail in voting because RUSSIA needs the votes done electronically in order to hack the system!

No need for a debate. Biden's got this.
Obama-Biden did NOT spy on the Rump Campaign. FAKE News and we have the facts to prove my Rump AH wrong!!!
Doesn't matter what Trump says. It's what Biden might say that I'm worried about.
Yeah I dunno. Joe ”Gaff Machine” Biden on the debate stage seems like an unnecessary risk considering current polling. 🤔
I dunno. They seem desperate for debates (prolly bc they expect Biden will put this foot in his mouth like he usually does) but Trump doesn't want to release the returns. Would be interesting to see what they decided to do if Joe gave that ultimatum.
Biden should make all debates contingent upon Trump releasing his tax returns. 💡
Lmao ppl hating on Trump and so naive how ridiculous Biden is talking.. shows ppl voting for Biden is completely oblivious and doesn’t care for the future of our country.. Go Trump!! Going to destroy Biden when they debate
If you are still voting for Biden then you ain’t American..
With all regards to our Democratic friends, how could they, in true conscience, vote for Mr. Biden?
Not voting for Biden is a vote for trump so not voting for trump is a vote for Biden!
There are pictures of Biden fingering Tara Reade???! Or are you referring to him touching the shoulders of a woman? To go from that to fingering is a big leap. 🤦🏾‍♀️
Humm🤔, Bozo! Just out for herself...much like Biden! Twins?!?
“Biden can’t speak” says Mr. Intellectually Challenged.
Doesn't matter what Biden would do in such an interview.  All Biden has to do is NOT be Trump and let Trump be Trump.  That is the winning strategy.
I never fully trusted  and yes, her voting record is problematic - and her support for #Biden even more so. But IMO she's still far better than Yang.
Every Response Biden makes during the debates should begin, "Mr. Trump, didn't you previously say...."  Let the debates focus on what Trump has said and NOT done during the last 3.5 years.
Is What's Happening in NYC a Glimpse into Joe Biden's America?
You are making fun of a one letter typo while you are voting for Biden. lol can’t make this stuff up.
Shhh don't want to upset the Biden folks. They are super sensitive little bishes 😉
C'mon - what's the real reason you won't watch?  Anything to do with having your belief system replaced with a little TRUTH?  I hear Biden's gonna narrate some of it - but the slur makes it hard to figure out what he's saying.
Biden remembers who had his back and who didn't. Trust.
A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn’t pretty  via
Isn’t that crazy  I was only doing it because I’m sick of all the black lives matter mask and Biden mask and nothing being said propaganda is propaganda! But I mean not a hour into my shift and take that off!! Because someone complained on it!! What!! I said! That’s
We can’t win if we can’t support who we want to support and it’s not right!! Biden mask can be worn BLM mask can be worn but no trump mask!
Surely 4 more years of Trump will fix that! You’re right! If you think Biden was my choice you’re wrong. I just live in the constant reality of -NOW-.  You realize tourniquets can and often result in amputation but they keep you alive right?
Biden is a liar, he would raise taxes even higher than that!!!
Exactly where did Krystal tell us to vote for #Biden?
I'm sorry if I wasn't clear. Due to the upcoming election, there are a lot of "oppo dumps" containing unfavorable information about various folks who may be Joe Biden's selection for VP candidate. A video of one of those candidates praising Scientology recently came out. 1/2
Voting for Biden,  owned by China, mentality unfit to  be President! Open Borders,  Higher taxes, green new deal, Went so far left, This guy is a racist Smells and touches little girls Hair.. Trump will smoke him...#TrumpPence2020KAG
Never watched an episode of Hannity in my life, no media is trustworthy anymore. Read for yourself. No Trump isn’t ideal, but good luck convincing anyone competent that Biden is better.
Biden couldn't run a KFC 🤣
She doesn't actually name #Biden in that video, but she does in this tweet:
What specifically?  Tell us accurately what of the Biden agenda is going  to harm us and how.  Go ahead...I'll wait.
Big deal.  We fill stadiums with rock bands and sports events.  And you don't get it do you?  All Biden has to do to win is NOT be Trump.  That's  it.  That's  why people  will vote for Biden.
I have to say, she and Biden seem to have an great chemistry, but to have her as Attorney General would be an excellent move. She knows the law, stands by it and has the lady balls to be great at it.
CNN: Three people charged in Twitter hack that hit Biden and Obama.   via
😂😂😂 Biden the Marxist.
Thanks again Nancy for stalling, not working with republicans and waiting until the last damn minute to negotiate. You and your pathetic party really care about the American people. I pray Biden loses big to Trump .
You got to remember a lot people on the left were behind Sanders and not Biden. And we all saw what the DNC did. That's why they have Biden instead of Sanders. But deep down i dont think they really do hate America.
In any case, the response to either #Trump or #Biden is identical. #Revolution
God help us if Biden wins. But he's getting so bad, they will probably remove him, and insert who they really want last minute. One who was not voted in.
Lol I’m going to feel bad for Biden going against Trump when the presidential debate starts.. yet again I’m not..this guy is going to get destroyed lmao.. Go Trump!!
If #Biden even wins.
Also, credit where credit is due: #AyannaPresley, Warrenite 🐍 though she was, has also not endorsed #Biden so far. I have not been a fan of Presley, and still am not, but I hope she will follow #RashidaTlaib in explicitly declining to endorse #Biden.
There's actually a lot of truth to this. I read an article about "comfort" and while Sanders may have had a more disruptive message of necessary change, people want "comfort" like Biden, exactly like "elect him and everything will be OK again"
Some Biden allies wage a shadow campaign to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president
what do you think about the theory it's also partially coming from Dr. Biden
should not only refuse to endorse #Biden, she should defect to the #GreenParty.
Biden's notes: ‘Do not hold grudges’ against Kamala Harris    Can you imagine a president who doesn't hold grudges?  Seems that should be a prerequisite.   what an incredible team for the USA!

Joe Biden hired  and  in one week. That IS progressive, my friends!
The state-run postal service that we are told to trust with our ballots is endorsing candidates and pushing a very partisan message? Even telling their 300,000 union members that their jobs could be at risk if Biden is not elected. Interesting..
Its getting to the point where these clowns need to be told that Facebook’s not there super secret racism playhouse. Idiot🤡 Virginia mayor asked to resign for saying Biden would pick 'Aunt Jemima' as VP  (Via AJC)
Vote for Biden. And stop thinking you have to be “crazy about” your candidate.
I guess there’s nothing in Biden’s either lol
Millennium Millie Weaver was just arrested (for burglary? with a grand jury indictment before arrested? probably one of the niceties of the Patriot Act?). Do not have to wait for Biden to worry. This is happening under Trump.

Ultimately, none of this matters.   Undecided or swing voters have turned off vast majority of press. These voters will watch debates, look for big speeches or major moments in October...and 95% of those will be Trump or Biden.
Why exactly is the obvious news worthy? They'd rather watch the nation decline with Trump than it improving with Biden.
After President Donald Trump attacked his challenger Joe Biden over affordable housing, Democrats have slammed his statements as racist.

Harris makes case against Trump in first speech as Biden's running mate
he Mississippi Democratic Party is responding to Senator Kamala Harris being chosen to be the running mate of former Vice President Joe Biden.
What did they use for Mississippi, which currently has no flag? My guess: a sweaty cape once worn by Elvis, bought by Biden at a flea market in 1985.
I also think that it’s interesting that the Kamala and Biden walk off song was “move on up” by Curtis mayfield - which was also sampled by Kanye West for “Touch The Sky.” Who some have called Trump’s shadow running mate. I don’t think it’s intentional but still funny.
And yet, I can hear the Stelter’s, Cilliza’s, and Navarro’s of this world having multiple orgasms over the unserious allegations. Plus, it’s more clear now, Biden is a placeholder.
It’s weird to see people being unable to hold hands and hug in this announcement and official bringing together of Biden and Harris. It looks like a blind first date that went well but “I still don’t know you like that... yet.”
Biden can literally call someone coon and you’d still vote for him 😂😂. The way the right and left uses blacks is hilarious .
YES.  And she will be next POTUS after Biden, I believe.
We’re working hard for you at 4 ! It’s the ticket that many people are talking about. We have reaction to the Biden-Harris ticket. Later the outlook on college football. We have the answers.

I feel like she’s going to do a great job as VP, she will definitely keep Biden in check.

We, sir, will not have a democracy unless Trump is voted back in! Biden will have us running socialism up a flag pole!
At this point all we can do is get Trump out, survive 4years until we can get meaningful candidates.   I don’t have high expectations for Biden/Kamala if elected, but I guess we have to make due like we always have.
Let’s keep it a buck. We hitched our wagon to Biden, the weakest candidate, even though he did NOTHING to earn our vote besides stand next to President Obama.   So weak that he NEEDED a woman of color (Kamala) on the ticket with him and his chances are STILL shaky.
What I meant was that Biden wasn’t my first choice to win the Democratic candidate nomination, it was originally Bernie Sanders. But I’m going to vote for him now because we got to get what’s already in the White House OUT of the White House.

I’m curious what 4 more years of “this” even is? I haven’t actually seen an argument that doesn’t consist of “he’s racist” and “he’s sexist” which is laughable to use as an excuse for Biden.
Presumptive Democratic Presidential Nominee Joe Biden announced Kamala Harris as his running mate on Tuesday. But who is Harris, exactly? Here’s what you need to know about the VP nominee:
It’s gonna need a deep cleaning, a sanitization, and an exorcism.  The Biden’s will have to stay in Blair House.
I’m not sure Biden counts, because he was never formally a candidate. You can’t lose if you don’t play.  I think the answer is no. Mondale (1984), Bush (1988), and Gore (2000) all had to fight for their nominations, but they got them.
Oh before I go to bed I hope y'all die mad about that question Harris hit Biden with in primary.   She wasn't wrong and she was nicer than I would've been.   In fact she was nicer than I was on here at the time.   #KamalaHarrisForVP #HarrisBiden2020
is she radical left /Biden is not going anywhere
How Biden selected Kamala Harris as his running mate
You can’t ask for diversity and complain when we get it. Just say you don’t want a strong black woman in office as a vp. Forget what they’ve done in the past , look at what Trump is doing in the present. Biden &amp; Harris would be a huge upgrade.
Trump might go after Biden.. he won’t remember the next day but I’m sure it will happen..

At The End Of The Day, That Ballot In November Will Say Trump And Biden ! Bump The VP Choice. Y’all Got One Job In November, MAKE IT HAPPEN ‼️💙
Absolutely.  I wanted Warren but she was knocked out early and voted for Bernie. But I will vote for Biden/Harris if it means beating Trump.
Congratulations Senator.  You and Joe Biden have my unwavering support.

Biden is Catholic!? Just because he supports Pro-choice that doesn't negate his faith. As a Catholic myself, that should be something that is on an individual and their faith.
It would be a counter strike via left wing super-pacs that feel as if the ticket is not Liberal enough. They don't have to be Pro-Trump to be Anti-Biden/Harris
You say she is lying.  So you don’t believe women??  How convenient how Biden’s accuser is lying but Trump’s are not.  Look, you are going to support your guy and I’m going to support mine. May the best man win.  I’m out!✌️
I’d rather go for the lesser of the two evils. Biden wasn’t my first choice either.
Biden has also been accused of sexual assault and Kamala Harris has publicly stated that she believes his accusers, so like I have said...everyone politician has something. You have decided that there are things you are willing to ignore or overlook.
I'm over it  Vote for Biden or don't and get on with it.  You don't have to actively work to tank the campaign because you're in your white dude feelings.
How about y'all tell us how y'all really feel about Biden's pick🤣🤣🤣
I know; my reasoning is that Biden would subsequently be in a position to fill it, and could choose Warren.

Kamala Harris has been selected to be Biden’s running mate. How do you feel ?
I accept Kamala as the the vp. She has her flaws, but then again, I believe any other candidate Biden could've picked would also have flaws. She's not my choice but im not upset about it. Just a little dissapointed.
At a debate Kamala chewed him up. Yet Biden chose a critic and a straight talker to be his VP. Strong leaders like dissenting voices.  (and Oh she is a strong woman too)
Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate    Twitter had #VPpick as a trend and upon clicking it I was shown only a few tweets that were vulgar racism and sexism attacks on Kamala.   I think Twitter  is broken.

So she doesn’t think Biden is a racist anymore?
Some of y'all praise  on a Monday and throw  under the bus on a Tuesday. Weird to see. REMINDER: Twitter isn't the Real world. Only 17% of Wisconsinites polled wanted to "defund the police" in today's Marquette poll. GREAT PICK BIDEN!
Joe Biden picks California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
This is what is needed in the White House though is it not?   Have a VP to hold the president accountable instead of blindly following everything he does. I originally wished Biden would pick a right-leaning moderate as VP to help unify ever-so-slightly.  Kamala isn’t a bad #2.

Hidin' Biden? I would have gone with "Tickle Me Biden" but that also works too.
How about Obama spying on trump all the Biden’s should be investigated and locked up with Hillary
Slow maybe he’s not scared of his shadow and run and hide in his basement like biden it shows strength not stupidity we need a president that has courage not stupidity 👇
My VP pick? Karl Malone. Biden needs someone with some consistency and reach. With "The Mailman" you get that, and since the USPS is an election year issue, the nickname helps. Plus, he's from Louisiana, helping with southern votes, and COULD finally turn Utah.
And they give Biden a pass when he consistently loses his place in the middle of his own sentences, and they even try to justify his nonsensical word salads which are often reeking of racism.
I’ll still vote for Biden in the fall, like we have a choice, but I will burn the establishment down for the next midterms and draft  to primary them in 2024, because no one in the running to be VP would be so disloyal to run against them in 24 if they weren’t picked.
She never said he didn't, she just basically told Eric that while he was busy laughing at what Robin said about Biden , he should look at what he said about Trump ,too.
Wow! That Biden kid is carrying quite a bit of baggage. 😳
Where’s their masks? Doesn’t matter when you’re on Biden’s short bus!
It’s 100% true and you know it! You’re just to left to face the facts! Biden has twonyears tops before he’s full blown lost!
Now do Joe Biden...
We don’t own the Biden residence. The WH is publicly owned and shouldn’t be politicized.  Plus it’s illegal.
It could be a snail, I’m still voting for Biden.
kamala harris is not a good person stop pushing biden to pick her as vp you blind bastards
I’d vote for Biden if he picked a can of tuna fish.
Mr. Jay White.  He's complaining about not having any options other than Biden.  I'm saying, what has Trump done that's made his life worse the last 4 yrs.
If  picks Whitmer, well, it won’t be good, if he picks anyone other than Harris, I’ll be done with the party establishment 4 good, I’ll vote for Biden in November, but I’ll be working for the drafting of candidacy of  in 2024 for President. #ChooseUnity #ChooseWisely
You say I'm not black enough if I don't vote for Biden, and then they say I'm a know sellout if I sided for Trump. I don't like neither one of them Mfs. And, for my vote it really doesn't matter. Because it's basis on popular and electoral shit that is rigged. .....🧑🧑💩🤡
He’s a biden voter
Don’t confuse aging for not seeming bright. Biden knows how it works. Notice he doesn’t take the obvious shots at Mitch, chances are if elected he’s gonna have to finesse a Republican Senate.
I was a Harris supporter, but she couldn’t meet her moment when she had the opportunity. Also, there seems to have been some issues with Maya(her sister) and her campaign staff. Also a female Obama doesn’t work, I like her at DOJ that’s the dream job in a Biden administration.
Below I will list a variety of Presidential candidates as well as what party they're running as and a link to their platform. I was originally planning on waiting for Biden to choose a running mate but apparently that's never going to happen.
Yeah. Biden would have an alert  on the highway when he forgets who he is and where he is going
Still being a sore, insecure loser, I see? Joe Biden needs to do better, but tell your fellow Republicans to do WAYYYY better.
She’s whacko! He literal extended the federal unemployment for all of the Michiganders she put in the unemployment portal! She’s just pissed he’s leading from the front and not sniffing Biden’s rear end!
If the ACC cancels, Biden could try to pick up Notre Dame.
The VP pick is  decision.  Tweets that divide the party around that choice are counterproductive - especially as he has said he has made up his mind.  To defeat Trump, we should stand united behind the Biden and her ticket.  #Whomever.
I doubt any will see this, but, I am a 60ish black male. Anybody else think Biden could sharpen his image up a bit with a haircut. ( i.e. tapered around ears and neck? ) I realize it has nothing to do with character, but the hair bothers me.
Just cause I’m black who said anything about Biden
I believe Trump’s presence on the right emboldens an equally authoritarian response from the left. If he’s left in office they’ll be no room for left-center or right-center. That’s the importance of Biden in this case.
Every country on earth except Russia would prefer Joe Biden
I’m not ignorant of our voting system. Republicans and democrats will both destroy America, just in different ways.   Just curious where do you get 1.3% from? You can’t blame people voting 3rd party for Biden’s potential loss. If he can’t get the votes to win then that’s on him.
If I didn’t vote for her, it wouldn’t make a difference. I just wouldn’t be voting in that case. I’m not going to vote for someone (Biden/Trump) who are extremely questionable, who’s policies I don’t agree with, and who perpetrate the same corrupt political machine in the States.
U.S. intelligence assessed that China is hoping President Donald Trump does not win reelection, while Russia is working to denigrate Democrat Joe Biden.

#LetHerSpeak at the debates! She missed one morning campaign rally in Jackson MS and was back on the trail that afternoon in Hattiesburg.  Meanwhile Biden is MIA and trump hides in the bunker signing unconstitutional orders. #voteVold #LetHerDebate
You can easily same the same for any other candidate. Voting for Biden or Trump won’t accomplish anything more than it would voting for her. It’s not about making a statement as much as me voting for someone who I consciously agree with. A vote for someone is simply a vote.
I never suggested that Biden didn't help write the Crime bill.  Biden didn't make racist District Attorney push 3 strike rules. Biden didn't make states across country adopt three strike rules. Our criminal justice system has needed rehauling  for years. I practiced criminal law.
You really think Joe Biden will do a good job? He doesn’t even know what fucking day it is! Also, why is an article about providing more made in a America products prompting you to profess your hatred for America? We need less liberal cancer like you in this country!
West himself has hinted he may be in the race to detract from Biden. When an interviewer from Forbes suggested as much in a text message Thursday, West responded, “I’m not denying it.”

How can anyone - progressive or not - want a person with senile dementia like Joe Biden to have his hand on a nuclear trigger?
The Left are masters.   Clinton had a vulnerability. Russia, The uranium, speaking fees, foundation.  The solution, call Trump a Russian. They are doing it again.  Why? Because Biden has been an agent of every country but America and his family have made millions for his betrayal
and   could just get up and batter Biden in a Debate for a Better America.   The Press could not resist the eyeballs it would bring.
Any day Biden just tell us who the Veep is! Today is your chance to steal the wind from trumptard
Sex is good but have you ever imagined Biden making Hillary Clinton Secy of State again and seeing her walking into the UN with Susan Rice and Samantha Power on her flanks. Putin would faint!!!! The bitch is BACK! 😍
Never mentioned Biden, he talked about the present political climate from the perspective of what LEWIS wanted for America. Stop with the snake oil.
Really it’s fuck trump AND biden
He has been a part of the swamp for decades, he comes off much more competent than the Biden.   His politics are even better than the leftist puppet Biden has becomel
. Roman Catholics are voting for Trump en masse.  Biden and Pelosi’s claims of faith don’t matter.  They’re avowed secularists, clearly.  Kamala Harris will pay for her transgressions against the Knights of Columbus if she’s nominated.
Joe Biden got the keys to the Indians twitter or what?
. I worry about the Pacific Supply Chain if Biden is elected.  The only U.S. Pacific port that isn’t deep Blue politically is Coos Bay, Oregon.
is racist garbage! Biden will still get 99 percent of the African American vote.
and this is someone who is so delusional to believe Biden is a good candidate, or even really mentally incapable of serving out his term. Let him come out and answer questions on policy, on how he would address the Pandemic, on Policing issues. Not through press releases
Trump campaign ad manipulates three images to put Biden in a ‘basement’
I absolutely love Ana! She is a huge Joe Biden supporter and she will be great in this role!
So the “GRABBER” thinks he can speak for AAs. Not offended by what Biden said but I am offended by what you just implied. You don’t think for AAs, and we know you hate them. SOBs, Cent Park 5, don’t rent to (C) coloreds, no AAs counting your money, the suburbs, etc....
I read the transcript of Biden’s original garbled remarks. I see what he was imprecisely trying to say. I see why Black citizens could take offense. He apologized. He clarified.  What else can he do? This bullshit Dennis is doing is just that.
Biden should ask him at the debate if he was thinking of Stormie Daniels when he misspoke Thighland.
Biden said a racist thing
That's pretty much right. Trumpers try to claim Biden has low mental abilities, while Trump flutters around like a deranged cuckoo bird.
Just have questions selected,  let President Trump answer and play videos of biden o the topics
I would crawl over broken glass. I would wait however long it takes to cast a vote for Biden #RidenWithBiden2020
If Joe Biden does not debate, ask a group of reporters to select questions and just playback Joe's stupid gaffes about the subject.
It is a damn shame that they are promoting and pushing Joe Biden,who obviously has dementia. That's elderly abuse. He will not debate you because it will expose the shell of a person he is.

I keep seeing y'all tweet out that short Biden clip. I understand y'all don't like the guy but y'all keep falling for that same shit.
Joe Biden lost his wife and a child in an accident after he first became a senator. More recently, he lost a son to brain cancer. I bet he has prayed to God a million times or more.  I know this: Only God can answer prayer. Only God gets to choose who is against Him!
Your dear leader benefits from an economy that Obama built. BTW black unemployment had the biggest drop under Obama. Facts! What Biden hasn’t  done is refer to AA’s as SOBs and ask for the death penalty for five innocent ppl or not rent to “C’s”.
I say to Joe Biden it’s Easy to be a Bleedinfheart when your giving Away Taxpayers Money. Illegal people should Get ZERO from our Government except a criminal charge and put on the Mexican side of the Wall that President Trump is building!!!  That’s IT !!!
Biden is a fucking shit show

Joe Biden, builder of the Godhammer
Trump dissed your father. Biden went on the View and comforted you after you cried over your father’s cancer diagnosis. The choice is clear.
Look, if Biden can hurt God we don't want to risk his wrath, is all I'm saying.

My wife went to the WH to accept an award from Biden and came back extremely impressed.  Said he's either incredibly sharp or really good at digesting a briefing, which is basically the same.
The horns were honking!! Thumbs were Up as I was putting out yard signs in support of Joe #Biden and #Kamala Harris for president and vice president and #MikeEspy for Mississippi US Senate. Tyranny has arrived in…
The best thing for Biden is to stay in his basement.
Biden could have added Jesus of Nazareth to the ticket and Liz Cheney would still tweet this about HIM.
Correct me if I’m wrong. Both Biden &amp; Harris are now receiving National Security Daily Briefs? Unlike  they will actually READ them! I’m feeling safer already.
Biden is the polar opposite of Trump! #BidenHarris2020
Some Progressive Political Activists Are Not Happy That Biden Picked Harris
When the Harris nomination came across the TV, I broke down and cried. Not because she was my first choice (she wasn’t) but because after nearly 4 yrs of abuse from  , we FINALLY have a strong ticket to elect Biden for president. #BidenHarris2020 I’m thrilled!
So if you’re not voting for Biden/Harris WHO TF are you voting for?
Fairly certain Biden thinks he got a new caregiver today

I knew Biden would not hold it against her.  Not like she was going to turn him down when it paves the way for her in 2024 as incumbent.  Only question was if he could get the nom.

Voters in SF demanded that of prosecutors before Harris.  SF has long had a progressive sheriff, too.  As AG, Harris fought to uphold every death verdict.  She was complicit in DA misconduct. 9th Cir called her on it.  I'll vote for Biden anyway. But Harris has no fixed principle

This actually would be smart because, if we’re honest, Biden doesn’t really inspire on his own merit.
trump has to go! Future President Biden could pick a rock for VP and I would still vote for him. Let’s be honest though, a rock would be more intelligent than Pence.

We can have a "sleep over" and camp out. You know!  To see if their Biden will save them from an ass whooping any better than our Donald will save your sign.
John Roberts just let Obama EO for DACA stand. Why would he choose illegals over US citizens in need? Bad optics for Biden  if Dems  sue to take $ to save people from eviction and loss of income in pandemic. Really a heartless look

Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden’s Running Mate.
The Democratic Party is filled with liars. The reality is exactly the opposite. Not only did the Obama administration not lay any groundwork for this deal, they actively worked against it by appeasing Iran and empowering them in the region.

I will vote for Biden/Harris! 🗽🌊
Posting this aimed at Mississippians is a waste of time. Most of us know who we are voting for because it’s either you hate Trump so you pick Biden, or you love Trump so you pick Trump. Trying to dig deeper than that is useless at this point.
Imagine how history is gonna remember you...it's gonna be pretty ugly.  Now imagine how history is going to remember Trump...it's gonna be Biblical. You do realize when this is over, Obama and Biden will be recognized as criminals? Are you going to say, that you didn't know?

😂 Biden knows how to come in &amp; lead America through a recovery. We are going to need a recovery following the mess tRump has made. He ran the deficit up trillions of dollars - tax cut for billionaire donors, no healthcare, no infrastructure, just 30 miles of falling down fence.

Who or What Exactly Is Running Against Trump? The inner-Biden at 77 is turning out to be an unabashed bigot in the age of “cancel culture” and thought crimes that has apparently declared him immune from the opprobrium reserved for any such speech.
Because they don't post anything negative to Joe Biden. Twitter and all other social media has their priorities. Children are on that list.

No sir. Donald inherited the Obama-Biden era economy and brags that he got it in order. Please do some research on this.
If they are that stupid, let them vote for a documented racist and fool, Donald Trump... Donald Trump mocks, criticizes and ridicules and he becomes more popular. Biden says virtually nothing that is significant and the press makes a mountain out of molehill.. Do your job media.
Joe Biden is doing a wonderful job of denigrating himself.

When I heard Trump saying that Biden is coming after your guns and religion, I  laughed. When he said that Biden hates and wants to hurt god, I was completely dumbfounded by the desperation of the blasphemer-in-chief. How do religious Republicans stand for this?

Because we know that Joe Biden needs assistance to clean himself after going to the bathroom.
Biden doesn't know what planet he's on.  Why hasn't our Party given us someone we can stand behind, instead you've given us a racist old politician with no leadership ability and has never accomplished anything in 40 years. WHY? Please offer us a worthy candidate.

If your right and maybe you are, Why is Biden the best you have to offer, If your serious about us and what we deserve then step up and present someone that's competent. We do deserve better, Your shoving a racist man with no leadership ability down our throats and its scary
Wow, the lies have an extra hint of desperation these days...he will “outlaw religion” and “hurt God?” There are literally dozens of pictures of Biden praying, and I’m pretty sure the only times Trump went to church were for his multiple marriages.Only way he may improves my life is the lack of environmentalism and sustainability under him GROWS under Biden in a few years when I’m done with my degree and there’s plenty of job opportunity.
And yet, using a large platform   you proudly proclaimed you would not be voting for Biden over his....policies? Man, wtf JackO, how can you defend this position seeing the direction of the country the last four years? It’s a two horse race my guy
Does this mean he will close and put out of business the rest of outdoor dining restaurants, too? What about people jogging/biking/playing outside? This is crazy! Masks should be worn when social distancing is not possible. Biden will collapse our country.
FOX needs to start calling out Biden daily and pressuring him to do an interview with Bret Baier or Harris Faulkner
Biden would have taken out Corn Pop
After President Donald Trump attacked his challenger Joe Biden over affordable housing, Democrats have slammed his statements as racist.
Trump and Biden singing "It's 5 o'clock somewhere" together at the first debate would really unite the country, IMO.
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden's Running Mate | National Review
Who said it doesn't matter...but what I did say is that Trump winning does not make Biden/Harris suffer but it makes the rest of us suffer
Second stimulus check: Where Biden, Harris stand on COVID payment proposals
It's not very good and some of those voices don't even sound like Biden
She was phone banking and called a Black grandmother, asking if she would vote for Biden-Harris. The 91-year-old woman burst into tears, because it was the first time she'd learned Joe Biden had picked Kamala Harris—a black woman. Read the thread.
The bishop said it is the "first time in a while" there hasn't been a Catholic. So please explain how Biden isn't Catholic but Tim Kaine, Paul Ryan, John Kerry, etc. are.
Biden’s new VP called college kids stupid. Most college kids vote Democrat. Really think she is going to listen to them? No she’s not!
he Mississippi Democratic Party is responding to Senator Kamala Harris being chosen to be the running mate of former Vice President Joe Biden.
I won't say the primaries are "rigged" because 1) Biden was popular and might have gotten it even if we had same day/ranked choice voting and 2) I don't believe the Dems are that organized.
I mean, our primary system is totally screwed up and a lot of people didn't get a chance to vote for their preferred candidate. But it doesn't matter because Biden/Harris is who we have, so VOTE
I WAS WRONG: I searched "Hillary Clinton"+"baggage," but not "Hillary Rodham." She actually SURPASSES George W:  Hillary: 28,595 Bush 43: 21,017 Trump: 15,273 E. Dole: 4,438 Biden: 3,478 Condi Rice: 2,879 Bernie: 2,488 Palin: 2,371 Warren: 1,585   33/
Because Biden reminded people that Trump called white supremacists fine people? Ok.
Now it’s personal, huh? It wasn’t personal when they made things up about Biden’s son, I guess. And what hoax? It’s what Trump said.
Biden must have forgot to take his meds at the right time and they are waiting for him to be mildly coherent before walking him out. They should just let Heelz Up Harris come out and fluff the crowd. #PeePadsAndKneePads #maga #BidenHarris2020
Watch Live: Biden, Harris to make unusual campaign debut in virus era
Kinda thought Peterson would hang on for more one cycle then bite the dust in a Biden midterm. But it doesn't look good for him now.
WATCH: Viral video of man hanging off a semi driving down the interstate. Plus, we break down Joe Biden’s VP pick. Newsfeed Now is streaming live. Watch Newsfeed Now here:
I’ve seen a few tweets lately addressing Biden’s Catholicism vs Trump’s...whatever his supposed religiosity is (mainlineish Protestantism, maybe?). My standpoint: neither man has a strong claim to Christianity, so it’s a silly argument.
Unless they’re trying to pull the more radical progressives who ain’t exactly enamored with Biden back into showing up and voting. Problem is Harris is not wholly attractive to such folks.
Some of yall are down playing Biden and Harris and don’t know the difference between the 3 branches of govt. Please sit this conversation out.
First question to Harris..You said Joe Biden is a racist and you believed his accusers of sexual assault what has changed?
Think Reagan (Trump) vs Mondale (Biden) in 84...
Presumptive Democratic Presidential Nominee Joe Biden announced Kamala Harris as his running mate on Tuesday. But who is Harris, exactly? Here’s what you need to know about the VP nominee:
People using “Joe Biden is racist” as a reason to keep Trump in office when Trump’s dad was a whole ass KKK member.   It’s giving me delusional.
Incredibly, Elizabeth Warren, who has only served as a senator since 2013 and ran for president once, already has half as many "baggage" stories as Joe Biden, and trails Bernie (a 30-year congressman/senator+2x POTUS candidate) by fewer than 1,000 results. 22/
Incredibly, Elizabeth Dole, the wife of 1996 GOP nominee Bob Dole, has 1,000 more "baggage" stories than 3x POTUS candidate Biden. She has 2x as many baggage stories as 2x POTUS candidate Bernie, who has been in Congress since 1991.  She merely *considered* running in 2000. 19/
Joe Biden, who has been in the U.S. Senate since the 1970s and run for president three times now (&amp; spent four years as VP) has about ⅙ as many "baggage" stories as Hillary Clinton, who came into the national spotlight as Dem nominee Bill Clinton's spouse in 1992. 18/
And yes, there are articles about men's baggage. I searched  for [candidate first+last name] + [baggage]  Bush 43: 21,017 Hillary: 19,943 Trump: 15,273 E. Dole: 4,438 Biden: 3,478 Condoleezza Rice: 2,879 Bernie: 2,488 Sarah Palin: 2,371 Warren: 1,585  16/
Shades of 84 election, with Biden playing the role of Mondale
Trump is to Reagan as Biden is to Mondale
Kamala Harris is "mopie [sic], depressing, nasty" &amp; "will be more baggage for the very frail Biden to carry," writes New York radio host   I'm reminded of the time Donald Trump, another blatant sexist, called Hillary Clinton a "nasty woman" during a 2016 debate. 12/
Now, Kamala is also racking up the "baggage" headlines. Shortly after Biden's announcement, the Washington Times ran this treasure on the left.  But hey, at least it's "Kamala's Baggage." In 2016, the Examiner wrote about "Bill's Clinton's Baggage for Hillary." (right) 3/
Whoever is pulling his strings picked her because of her skin color. We all know Joe Biden is Alzheimer’s to the past of no return!
at this point, it’s either Biden or Trump and honestly i’ll rather deal with Biden for the next 4 years than having to deal with Trump’s bullshit
biden just blew me.
Question: Do you think Sen. Kamala Harris as Biden's V.P. nominee will help him by firing up his base, or hurt him with moderates who see them as too liberal, or make little difference? #BidenHarris2020
Choose better phrasing. “Taps” isn’t a great choice given the sexual connotations... “In Historic Pick, Joe Biden Taps Kamala Harris To Be His Running Mate”
Pre-emptive grievance politics on the left is something.   Biden announced Kamala Harris, who will be the first Black or Asian VP nom for a major party.  The rush to lament how you'll now be "smeared as a racist &amp; sexist, akin to Hitler" for the next 4-12 years is... interesting.
Joe Biden can barely put two sentences together! How’s he going to do anything? He is absolutely NOT what our country needs!!! Trump has done more for this country in the last four years than that man has done in his entire life!!
A Kamala day keeps the Biden away.
Biden picks Kamala Harris for VP. She will be the first African American woman nominated for VP by a Major Party. Kamala Harris will join Sarah Palin and Geraldine Ferraro on the short list of woman nominated by a major party for Vice President.
Say his name! His name is Bernell Tremmell and he died simply for his political beliefs. Say his name! He doesn’t fit blm’s agenda so the left will fail to acknowledge his existence. If this was reversed and he had a Biden sign there would be chaos. Double standards are SAD!
Hey   I'm having trouble deciding on a Biden/Harris' ticket name. Your a sharp guy.   'Sleepy Joe &amp; Kamala Blow' Or 'Basement Biden &amp; Heels up Harris'  Go take the poll
I think we can all agree we should probably settle on the official name of the Biden/Harris ticket. #maga #wwg1wga
She has been a VP contender since she  endorsed Biden. Harris is the first Black woman and Asian American person on a major-party presidential ticket.
Live Coverage: Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
#BREAKING: Biden selects Kamala Harris as running mate&gt;&gt;
JUST IN: Joe Biden has chosen California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate.
True for this election, but kind of bigger than usual when you consider Biden would not run as an incumbent (probably)
Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden is expected to announce his pick for vice president, as early as today, according to CNN.
I dont get the acceptance speech controversy? Didn't Dr Fauci tell us all to stay home if we didn't have to go out?  Where does Mr Trump live?  Would they be pissed if Biden gave his speech from his basement? #maga
Obama/Biden had complete control with a super majority for two years to pass anything he wanted and all he barely do was ACA
Gosh, I just can't figure out why people don't have a visceral hatred for Biden like they did for Clinton, it's such a mystery.
Biden in 1985 used the N word to refer to remarks another person made. In 2020, TCU’s head football coach said the word in the same context to tell a player the team will not use that word. The same people voting for Joe Biden are the same people that want TCU’s head coach fired.
He knows Biden is a bad investment
Biden's campaign refuses to comment on his search, but his team has been in recent contact with a small group of finalists that includes at least four women of color.
Scaramuchi is a nut. Supports Biden because it is best for the republican party he says. I say, the hell with both parties, do what is best for the American people.
Bullshit Biden
I do not care how you feel about Biden, VOTE FOR BIDEN
Vote Biden and he will let you play with the hair on his leg.
If Biden were going to pick a white woman, it would probably be a good idea for him to pick one with more experience than that so as not to piss off the groups that handed him the nomination.
They always say if Trump acted a week earlier how many lives would have been saved.... how many would have died if he waited weeks like Biden would have
Oooohhhh.   Lol I’m kidding. You can obviously vote for whoever. But 🤮 at the choices we have between Trump/Biden
We all know Biden didn’t write this, because nowhere in that tweet thread do the words “look fat, here’s the deal” appear.
I am glad you are viewing somethings Biden stands for and says. Do not understand how Christians can back candidates that support anti-christian groups and individuals.
Hey, why don’t you tell us more about Biden hurting the Bible and hurting God... 😂😂😂😂😂 So tell me how Biden is supposed to hurt the “all powerful creator of all”.. First off stop pretending you’re religious, second let’s focus on reality and not fictional characters.. 🖕🏼
Biden again praises Latino diversity as being 'unlike the African American community'   He is an Ass. I am Latino. We all migrated from parts of Europe or Africa or Asia where we landed and set up roots may be different but we are the same
WATCH: President Donald Trump accused former Vice President Joe Biden of wanting to 'hurt God' during a stop in Ohio on Thursday.
WATCH: President Donald Trump accused former Vice President Joe Biden of wanting to 'hurt God' during a stop in Ohio on Thursday.
Lol, right? How powerful must Biden be if he can hurt God?
Everyone is talking about Harris and her policies today and I think it's gonna be really funny if Biden doesn't pick her.Vote for Biden anyway.
I like having a fair and free election that would give Biden a chance to be president. Kamala being the VP nomination means nothing if trump steaks another election.
That’s cool. The trump one is made in China, and Biden’s made by union workers.
Not surprised.  Didn’t his son and Hunter Biden have some “dealings” together?
This is not new and the reason why the GOP is losing members by the thousands. Reasonable people find it appalling what trump has done and now represents the GOP. True republicans must now vote for Biden and Harris to reclaim decency for American!
No no Trump every thinking person will vote for Biden and Harris and there are more that 90% of the thinking population. Trump will lose in a landslide and that includes the popular vote and electoral college. Resign s a name s  a be yourself the embarrassment
Man I’m scared to fucking vote 🥴🥴🥴 who the hell yall voting for... cause Biden crooked too 🤦🏾‍♂️
Exactly how the country will look 6 months into Biden/Harris administration
“You ain’t black”-joe biden
We the people feel sorry for you trump. You are sick and need help. The country is better than you and your pathetic followers think, we are moving forward together without you. Biden and Harris 2020.
Electing Biden won’t be easy. After we finish celebrating Biden’s VP pick, we should get back to fighting for our right to have a free, open, and fair election. Did you ever think we would be using these words in reference to an American election? We acting like we’ve won already
Yeah, they’re gonna be a problem should Biden win.
Didn’t take long to get the establishment teat suckers to start screaming about NO DEBATES.  Next from you and your ilk is....  Biden should just step aside and let Harris be the pick.  Mail in voting.
I agree that just because you don’t think Trump is doing a good job makes you bad.  I do think that if you believe that Joe Biden can do a better job it just makes you cuckoo 🤪
Look at how racist Joe Biden has been for years. You ain’t black if you don’t vote for me. So  if you don’t vote Dem you not blk. Typical lib attitude.
What has Biden done in his decades in office. Nothing. Lowest blk unemployment tax cuts deregulations. Look at what’s happening in lib Dem states. Really??
Great show Joy I am over the moon with excitement seeing Kamala Harris selected as the next Vice President. Howard University and an AKA, Biden will restore this nation to respect and with Sen Harris this restoration will happen soon.
Hallelujah! Congrats Ms Harris! Biden/Harris!! Winner Winner Chicken Dinner!!!!
Joe Biden is on the cusp of announcing the biggest, and possibly most consequential, decision of his political career with the unveiling of his running mate.
Doug Jones is the kind of Senator the US needs more of; he has stood by his principles (including voting to impeach) and voted his conscience, knowing it would hurt his re-election chances. I hope he has a spot in the Biden administration.
The Russians are incapable of denegrating Biden worse than he does himself...!
Since he running as a republican wouldn’t he take away votes for trump there are still a few misguided Blacks who support trump. Informed people regardless of color are voting for Biden. Trump must be soundly defeated!
Nothing can make me vote for trump. The only 2 things that would make me not vote for joe Biden is if he dies before the election or if we were to find out he’s a pediphile. Other than those, I’m riding with joe.
Joe Biden ? Yeah right 😂😂
US officials: Russia denigrating Biden ahead of election
I agree, but suppose we turn out and they inform us in a couple days that Biden lost? What then? Because if we allow a second term Putin may teach him how to never have to leave office. What do we do then? I hope it doesn’t happen, but if it does……
Quit being cruel to Biden...
Biden will never be president... stop wishing...
Biden:  “don’t make me call Corn Pop”  “Hey little girl, do you want to feel my legs?”  “Wow, you smell good.”  “Who stole my pudding?”  “Whose house am I in?”
Biden:  “well, you smooth talking negros better get your act together. Cause you ain’t black unless you vote for my old white butt”  Public: “wow, that seems really racist. We better ask a professional.  Rev. Sharpton, what do you think?”  Al: “it’s ok. That honky is a democrat”
If you claim to be a Republican and you vote for Joe Biden....  Your not a Republican.  Your not a conservative.  Don’t lie to people. Just admit you call yourself a Republican but are really a big govt progressive who is happy with keeping the DC game alive
No AG Barr arrest on Obama or Biden. They're above the law.
Trump will and is cheating to try and become a two term illegitimate president. But the stable people will not allow this to happen, trump will lose in the largest landslide Biden victory.
This is a shameful attack on a good man, no one believes trump; however this is a bridge too far. Trump does not deserve to be anywhere near Vice President Biden. Trump is sick and needs to be hospitalized!There’s another pic of him with his hand on a cops knee. Biden is just touchy feely.
Look at #KHive in the news y'all!
Biden already said he’ll defund the police
Someone help me put the dots together:  postal union endorses Biden, USPS says it cannot guarantee delivery of mail-in ballots, then dims want to give USPS a bunch of money... 🤔.  What you talkin about Willis?
President Trump Schools Biden on Historic Middle East Peace Deal
Here's What Rush Limbaugh Says Joe Biden's Mask Mandate is Really All About
What is this copy and paste you said the same exact thing Joe Biden Said you people cannot think for yourself wait a minute you’re thinking for Joe God help us you need to repent put Jesus first
The left loves throwing the racism card out to anyone who doesn't share their views. The Dems have went so far left there's not much other choice but to vote the other way. Biden should've selected Tulsi Gabbard, who is more moderate, to sway more votes from the middle and right.
SCORING BIDEN AND TRUMP ON RELIGION
Harris’ policies do not speak to the needs of the many families in Mississippi whose loved ones are incarcerated in #ParchmanPrison and others throughout this State. Biden’s policies always have favored #MassIncarceration. They both are “tough on crime”.
Suspicious signs of a sudden spate of paid "trolls" (professional liars) advocating for #Biden and #Harris, using the socialist rose symbol 🌹 and the #GreenParty sunflower symbol 🌻 to disarm opposition. Don't be fooled. Engage as hostile, or report (as fake) and block.
This has been the Achilles heel of the  Instead of pushing the  to provide their constituents with viable candidates who share their interests, establishment Dems within  force us to accept the status quo. This will ultimately be Biden’s undoing
Joe Biden wins we will not have a nation we will be sold our soul if we vote for him
Yeah if you vote early you will not see Joe Biden make a fool of him Self in the debate
Are you ok? This woman is the one running for president not Biden!!
The fact is, when you push bomber Bernie who was voting to bomb brown people, voted for that same crime bill and funding Biden did, and was even more culpable of carceral injustice, your hypocrisy and misogynoir is revealed.
I'm voting for Joe Biden.
She is as lost as BIDEN and KAMALIE.
Yeah - her Secret Service escorts will help keep Biden from wandering off and getting lost - has to be easier than supporting her limp body and trying to make it look like she was self-propelled.
I almost agree - his and Obama's policies for the area were so bad and destructive that they welcomed a sane President Trump having a hand on the tiller...
Amazing - he teams up with a former prostitute and now they come up with a quick, Un-Constitutional signal to show us how they would run things...and they're stupid enough to think it plays well with Feds micromanaging everyone ...
Kamala:It’s good to see you Biden.. Biden: it’s get to see tha tha that yo yo you your here too.. I ca ca Kant wait to wo wo warwk twogether in th this elec el election
has some nerve saying Biden is politicizing the virus 🤦🏻‍♀️🤬. #POSPOTUS
Biden is sitting back and letting trump hang himself.
Trump says football is an essential business, but the USPS is not. Trump admitted that stoking fear is his way of doing things. There is only one decision. Vote Biden/Harris.
can't wait. How about you?       Breaking: Biden/Harris Campaign Calls For National Mandatory Face Mask Mandate
She admitted to voting for Biden as VP in both ‘08 and ‘12. Stop the BS.
Who has Biden accused of fingering him in a hallway that doesn’t exist.
Surprise: 'Minnesota Freedom Fund' Supported by Biden Aides Bails Out Accused Murderer, Convicted Rapist
After Calling For Major Mandate, Biden and Harris Hurry Off Stage to Avoid Questions
Direct action is great but if you’re White living in a majority white, liberal state in the NE don’t tell me how voting for Biden is like cutting off your leg instead of your arm. You’re a willful idiot. You talk that game about direct action and revolution while living in MAINE?
She originally made claims that he Biden would say inappropriate things to her during meetings. And made her uncomfortable when he touched her. Turns out she worked in the mailroom and she oils not have been in meetings with him.
It was made clear her private personnel records would not be with Biden’s. She’s avoiding requesting from the right agency because she has never filed a complaint.
But when she went to request her records she went to Univ of Delaware where Biden’s records are kept. Of course her request was denied. And she tweeted about the denial. It fits the story she’s trying to portray of being railroaded from having her story investigated.
And her personnel records are separate from Biden’s. Her information is confidential and wouldn’t be with his records. SHE has to request any of her records from Senate.
And yes originally she did say she file a written complaint. But after Biden said he would release his records, she changed her story and said she never mentioned rape or assault in any complaint she filed.
How about you give us a date of the attack. How about you give us a location. How about you go to the Senate for your personnel records rather that Univ of Delaware when it was made clear that your confidential records wouldn’t be with Biden’s records.
‘She goes with her gut': Mississippians react to Kamala Harris being chosen as Biden’s running mate
Mispronouncing Kamala's Name Is Racist...Until Biden Does It
I suspect there may be more genuine open-mindedness among Trumpezoids than among Dems trying to convince themselves that Biden and Harris will really help matters.
Jesus fucking Christ. We need Biden now. I am 100% for intervention here. Die mad if you disagree.
Yeah Great Bill, how about a ban on reporting all of Biden’s scary record  ?  Couldn’t hurt
Also, you know, Billy!  Harris supports and approves, Biden, right!  Well then, she is pro abusing a mentally lacking, possibly Alzheimers!? And treatment like that is considered ELDER ABUSE!!     Can you imagine... HOW SHE WILL TREAT THE REST OF OUR, INCAPACITATED AMERICANS??
Donald Trump is a fascist. Droning has increased and even become less regulated under him. Less vulnerable people will die under Biden. That’s objective fact no matter how much he sucks. You’re delusional otherwise.
Biden/Harris just lost
Her and Biden r made for each other and deserve each other.
Lol not shocked.. Joe Biden is just as evil.. he’s the type that wears a face mask in his car by himself
y’all know the difference between biden and trump and if you don’t you’re just that damn stupid 😑
Biden/Harris. America’s dream team.
&amp; 3 months out from the election is kinda a shit time to get that started. If we all truly felt this way about our choices why are these our choices? It’s a reflection of us as people. Fuck joe Biden but if he gets trump out of office &amp; we can start to gain the ground needed
I don’t see that being pushed at all I just see constant shitting on Biden &amp; Harris. It would be fucking amazing if we could not vote for the old racist/rapist democrat or republican at all this time, but we need to do more to get people on board with that type of thinking first.
A lot of you people are bitching about Biden &amp; Harris, but what are you going to do vote for trump? Or are you going to for Jorgensen? Either way you keep him in office, the only way to not have Biden nor trump in office is to kill the mindset of a 2 party system.
Good choice, Mr. Biden.

The Biden/Harris Ticket: The Day One Questions Answered
Biden/Harris  I’m so stoked.
Me too bc not voting for Biden is a vote for trump and not voting for trump is a vote for Biden.
no disrespect.  no offense...if we vote Democrat it will be for you. Not Joe Biden. Come on man he can't even answer a question much less be the answer America needs. If anything he will make things worse.
Lmaooooo “Biden just picked Kamala as his running mate 2 days after WWF Kamala passed away. Stay woke.”
Anyone have the joe biden in a Newport suit meme? #wwg1wga #QAnons  #meme
Clearly people don’t pay attention to or care what Biden has said and done or not done willful ignorance shows it’s ugly head
The most horrifying thing about this choice is that #Biden cannot last out a 4-year presidential term in the cognitive shape he's in, and may not last out the campaign season. This is effectively #Harris vs #Trump. #KamalaForDictator
Like Kamala saying she believes in Biden’s accuser three months ago but now is his buddy and vp canidate. That’s what silences victims
So far Kamala is tied with COVID-19, with Biden and murder hornets trailing.
By way of nominating Biden and Harris, two of the worst offenders of state endorsed poc imprisonment methods, the DNC essentially nominated Jorgenson.
So BIden is now kinda like Ted Cruz when Trump called Cruz's wife crazy and ugly and accused Cruz's father of being involved in the Kennedy assassination.
More have died with the regular flues than with this.  This was just another plot to try and bring Trump down.  The power hungry will stop at nothing to try and get One World Order.  Only the ignorant and those seeking Power will be voting for Biden whose Dementia is so apparent
I got it at 3:49cst. Well after the news. TBF the servers used to send out a mass text like that have to relay through other systems and it could have gotten backlogged. This may not be on the Biden end of the technology and just a bottleneck.
She’s the best choice. Trump can’t attack Biden anymore for wanting to “dismantle” the police because she’s the former AG of California. Susan Rice would have brought up Benghazi all over again. She’s a strong pick for the centrists who are on the fence.
Yep, has the background but has to understand that VP means VP.  Advise Biden and make sure he wins at his endeavors as POTUS.
Biden selects Kamala Harris as his running mate.
It’s gonna be rice. It’s the absolute silliest choice. Least CAMPAIGN experience. Tons of baggage. Joe’s instincts are garbage and DiFi was an early Joe endorser and apparently isn’t a big KDH fan. It fits the bullet points. Biden is dense, Clyburn and DiFi are happy.
And it was revealed she can request her own records thru Senate. Biden cannot give say to release her personnel records. She has to do it. But she went to Univ. of Delaware where Biden Senate records are.
And Biden spoke on this stating that he would release any pertaining personell records back when she claimed she made a written complaint back when it happened. Then she reversed saying she never did.
Anyone who doubts the deterioration of Joe Biden needs to see this...should remove all doubt...
GET ME BIDEN ON THE PHONE I WANT TO HAVE A WORD
I don't think it would be presumptuous at all to announce a few key cabinet posts. It allows the public to compare and contrast what a Biden admin would look like against the Trump faux-admin.
that shit actually became a lot easier to do when they started filming using so much green screen, spies have a lot more trouble snapping pics on sets, and all the scripts like quadruple watermarked with each person's copy unique identifier.  In conclusion Joe Biden is CGI
Biden hasn't said a single word about tax increases, except to say he will raise taxes on incomes over $400,000 and that multi-million dollar corps who pay nothing now would have to start.  Your tweet smacks of desperation.  Laughable.
I think Biden has a very strong chance of losing no matter who he picks. For the first time in my life I don’t believe the data even a little bit
It's hilarious how the Biden folks refuse to admit that his campaign was a zombie before black women saved it. They get so upset they can't even form sentences as can be seen in that video! Bless their hearts!
Wow! Joe Biden is a idiot! #Trump2020
Yes! Joe Biden's campaign has a debt that needs to be paid to black women and it's past due. They here to collect!
Who cares?  Biden and VP will both losers in November!
And Biden’s brain is fried!
This could be Biden’s Sister Soulja moment if he came at this hard, but the Democrats think they can hide him, hold the ball, and run the clock out.
I think it already has. Biden’s lead in the RCP average has dropped three points in a month.
Willie Brown:  "Harris is a tested and proven campaigner who will work her backside off to get Biden elected." ironic phraseology...
Around July 7th Biden was at 51.1% and Trump was at 41.5%. Fast forward to today and Biden fell to 49.9% while Trump climbed to 42.1%. But please tell me again how the VP choice doesn't matter. 🙄  #BidenHarris2020

CNN Guest: There Are No Left-Wing Outlets That Exist to Tear Down Trump
Authorities told her she herself (Tara Reade) would only have the power to request her personnel records from the Senate even if she had made a report. Confidentiality laws. She intentionally requested records at University of Delaware where Biden's records are.
Very hard to investigate if she cannot give a date of the attack. She originally claimed to have reported the incident but when Biden stated he would release any personnel records she then claimed she didn't make a report.
100’s?   Count Biden’s parade today. You may get closer.
Yeah it’s a real mystery as to why Sanders never attacked Biden for praising George Wallace.
He says he won't choose until he gets his pudding - then, as they wipe his chin, he forgets he had pudding and demands pudding before he chooses...
I thought Senile Joe was corralled into choosing a 'woman of color'. I guess Kamala would work - she has enough melanin to call herself "Black" - and a side bonus is she doesn't seem to mind being groped by older men to get ahead...just ask Willie Brown.
I say Biden is a Lying Dog-Faced Pony Soldier...
Jim Crow Joe Biden could become the next President of The United States. And all he did was sit by the water cooler during the primaries. And sit in his basement during the campaign. The Democratic movement offers No Hope and No Change. We need a Progressive Movement.
This was the Back Bay Biloxi MS Trump Boat Parade today. We had the National Anthem to start the day off and  not 1 single Biden flag in sight. Thousands of Trump boats/ Flags building  not 1 some single Biden/ Socialist flag in sight.,,,#Trump2020
USPS is the most corrupt institution and the mailmen are brainwashed Biden supporters. #boycotttheelection to show your support for  and the RIGHT party
Best picture of the day showing how many of us Deplorables were at the Back Bay Biloxi Trump Boat Parade!! Thousands of Trump Flags, not 1 Biden. Also, no rioting, no looting and best of all, a Great time was had by ever single person that attended. #Trump2020 #winning2020

Zoom in and pan around....not 1 single Biden flag, not 1. But thousands of boats with 1,000’s of Trump flags of all kinds. Fake Media won’t show this. #winning2020 #landslide2020 #nobidenhereatthisparade.
Right here in my home town!  We love Trump down South!  Biden has nothing!
This dude total biden bot.
They act surprised - Biden has a long history of racist activities and inane comments...as he deteriorates mentally, his filter is eroding...
About the time they realized Trump shaved 3 points off of Biden’s lead in a month.
They all met with Biden recently I guarantee it (well not Liz ofc)

Here’s your IQ Test. What’s your take on Joe Biden?
Like what? Tara Reade still cannot give a date of this so called attack or even a location. She claimed to be in meetings with Biden and it turns out she worked in the mailroom and had no day to day contact with him. Stop the lunacy.
Y’all blaming Biden for Reades housing insecurity and financial instability. She lied to get into law school. Maybe that’s what’s affecting her ability to get work. Not Biden. Not Biden supporters.
You are NOT worthy of the Black vote and how dare you attack Joe Biden’s faith. Fact: You stoke fear and racial divisions with your racist rhetoricYou are a Demagogue and you will be defeated in November. The virus is winning because of the choices you have made.
Please “silence” Biden.
One of the coolest byproducts of this is that it's forcing Christian supporters of Biden/Trump to discuss pros/cons Biblically.  Had a very painful discussion, no argument with a "woman be quiet" believer this morning.  Just dawned on me that a female VP will just kill him?!?!

Why doesn’t Biden denounce burning bibles?
So biden calls trump out for stopping  flights and now biden is saying trump did not do enough earlier 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  How do you support such   Democrats and Republicans are the same. They just take from opposite pockets
Oh you mean the poor kids and the white kids? You know... the thing??? 🤣🤣🤣 Trump has done more for minorities than any other president. As Biden put it, y'all believe the "truth" instead of facts. What a sad sad world we live in.
And how do y'all think Biden would have handled this? Remember... Trump was the one called a xenophobe for stopping those flights. He said he wished we could do something like those things to get rid of it. And the advice at the time was to save masks for first responders.
This is disrespectful on so many levels. Biden cannot hide his disdain for the Black community.
Biden just said racist remarks today. So Ohio wants that? No
Why is Biden for killing babies then? God is against murder I guess Biden is for it.
Biden didn’t come out against burning bibles!!
You think Biden goes to bed without watching Colbert? Hah.
Monday is what I think but I’m entering my official guess as Saturday at like 7am EST because Biden probably mows his lawn then. Waking me up. Fucking old dudes, man.
I don’t understand the question. Do people really not know what this means? There’s so many things you can say about Biden but remembering his dad’s driving fondly is weird? Oof. How embarrassing to be so sheltered and DSA? A group supposedly for the worker?
She claims Biden would talk down to her during meetings but it turned out she worked in the mailroom, a position she would not have been in meeting with him or have daily contact with him.
She worked in the mail room and was fired for throwing mail away. She never had daily contact with Biden.
Biden must be pretty powerful if he can hurt God tbf.
Because he’s Joe Biden. Now open pdf.
