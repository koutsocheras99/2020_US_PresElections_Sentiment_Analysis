I see. Thanks 🙏 I would also assume they'd pick a side - Biden
Wait biden has potential ! 🤣🤣🤣
He might actually be an improvement over Cheeto turd - but I think I’ll stay with Biden#KanyeWest
Not voting for Biden because you don't like his VP selection is like watching Trump set fire to your house while Biden is standing in your front yard with a fire hose and you are sending him away because you didn't like the color of his pants.
You support Biden?
i am ok i am impressed with biden so far, he appears to be reading his daily briefings and utilizing the info to secure his campaign like blocking chinese apps on company (campaign) phones
I'm losing followers faster than Biden is losing black supporters after every  interview. 😡
Gaffes like "Yosemenight" for Yosemite and "Thighland" for Thailand? At least Biden has a command of basic geography, let alone geopolitics.
Da noive. Rubio and other Republicans warn Democrats from "weaponizing...for political purposes" Director of National Intelligence report that Russia is trying to "denigrate" Biden to help trump win.
is that why biden banned tiktok and chinese apps? as he is aware of this intelligence?
LOL, as usual, Biden is against something that he vociferously supported during his long career as a politician.
i will vote for biden regardless, i am hoping he picks a candidate without legal nor intelligence issues
I wish loosing loved ones on noone and truly hope Joe Biden has piece in his heart.  But the dude still has issues.  He sniffs little girls!!!   I almost feel bad for him.
great choice by Biden for voter outreach
BIDEN WILL BE THE NATIONS NEXT PRESIDENT GOD WILLING🙏🏽
"The Klan is needed today as never before and I am anxious to see its rebirth here in West Virginia"--Robert Byrd “Poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids” — Joe Biden Ever read The Southern Manifesto? Biden brags about owning the table it was signed on.
Biden doesn't deserve the Black Vote.  Remember he didn't want his kids in schools with blacks and says if you don't vote for him, you're not black.
What you posted is an absolute lie. Joe Biden is not a devout Catholic, because if he was, then he would believe in the tenants of the Catholic Church regarding abortion. He has consistently advocated for a woman's right to choose.
Joe Biden doesn’t have dementia. He’s a lifelong stutterer and he admits it. Trump, on the other hand, is being driven to his own insanity by his enormous hubris. Much like a tragic Greek protagonist, his pride will ultimately be his downfall.
Stormy711 Be sure to fact Creepy Joe Biden to, if he remembers where he is , “what was the question?” “Running for the Senate!  Make sure he can get Q&amp;A’s (like Donna Brazile &amp; gave Killary in the 2016 Debate, make sure ANSWERS ARE WRITTEN DOWN!
We LOVE 💕 YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP2020🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸! I PRAY YOU WILL WIN AGAIN!! It scares me to death if Joe Biden has any small chance of winning! I’m a PROUD CHRISTIAN, and not afraid to say it! I wish you would use GOD &amp; the BIBLE only be used  appropriate times.
While my heart aches that his family &amp; the DNC are subjecting Biden to such abject cruelty of this presidential run, Biden and the leftists in the DemocRAT party must be crushed on Election Day. No less than the future of this nation is at stake.
First of all I don’t think Joe Biden has done those things. But, remember the Catholics go to confession. So, that would be the answer. His slate is wiped clean. Trump on the other hand. Well I think we all can draw our on conclusion on that one. Me; does he believe in God??
I love him!
Now do Joe Biden!# Trump2020
Brian Williams was the heir apparent to the Rather/Brokaw/Jennings lineage and he fucked it up.   So he  retooled, said YOLO, and he brings all that gravitas and skill by batting cleanup every night on MSNBC.   The guy's a treasure.
#BLM #AntifaDomesticTerrorists  May go after  after his statement.. He's going to keep on till he pisses them all the way off.. Joe Biden should be scared because they're violent and they don't give a damn who you are.. they're coming to your  neighborhood   Lol
I love the excitement... The support.. this is genuine.. Joe Biden will never understand what it feels like to be loved by your supporters.. their side is Evil &amp; corrupt..GODLESS. Full of lies &amp; deceit.
Joe Biden was never worthy of the black vote. He’s taken them for granted his entire career, and now it’s finally being exposed.
Now, let's do Joe Biden!
Most Americans Reject Delaying the 2020 Presidential Election – Research Co. Biden up 10.
Biden is out of touch in his basement
You’re playing to people fears and making stuff up... that’s not Biden’s position on guns. Have more respect for your followers intelligence...

Why are people suddenly saying this...heard that comment from two people this week.The only reason we may not hear about Covid for a few days is cause we’ll be celebrating Mr Biden’s presidential win!
How can ANY person, LGBT or not, vote for cognitively impaired Biden?!
Biden surely has known who his pick is for weeks. This is silly.
Trump also used his trip to Ohio to talk trade, telling workers at a plant, 'I will stand up to the foreign trade cheaters and violators that hate our country.'
You know, I can’t help but see all of you claiming you are going to vote for Biden. Voting for him just means you are voting for Trump. How can Jo Jorgensen win if you throw your vote away like that?  I’m voting for the woman who isn’t a credibly accused sexual predator.
Problem is Biden is constantly doing it and constantly having to apologize. Means the apologies aren’t real, he’s just pandering.
Why are you guys so sensitive. I’m a trump supporter and I think that the trump jokes were hilarious! But god forbid we make fun of Biden
Kanye West hinted that his presidential campaign is designed to spoil former Vice President Joe Biden’s bid to unseat President Trump this November, according to a new report
I would crawl over broken glass coated in salt to vote for Biden
How many interviews did Melania Trump do in place of   None. It’s insulting to the American people for a Presidential candidate to hide and refuse to answer basic questions. Jill Biden isn’t running for office. #AreYouAJunkie
Biden is a Christian not fake like your Trump!!
notice what a gutless wonder Comrade Bernie turned out to be again? Gave hilly a run for her money,'16 then bent over and faded like a limp dick for some DNC payoff cash. did the same thing for Biden, much earlier, but I guess campaigning for Joey wasn't part of the deal. 👇👁️
You ain't Black, if you don't group think.  Vote for KKK senator Bird that Biden thought was the best thing since sliced bread.
Joey (his handlers) say the choice for VP will be announced by biden on Aug. 17. Many are guessing it will be Harris, if so, since biden is such a clusterfuck, it figures that Kamala will be featured prominently, doing most of the 'campaigning" for the ticket.
This after trump says, "Biden hurts God." No, really.
“As bad as Biden might be”.    That says it all, really.
Funny  In a couple days, Trump R’s will gaslight country, saying, “vote Trump because Biden is socialist and will mess with the market”
Stupid enough to think Joe Biden could somehow just do away with God?
The rapper's paperwork to make ballots has been aided by Republicans in Colorado, Wisconsin, Ohio, Arkansas and Vermont.
Got a cousin that lives in Niceville. We fly out Trump flag, and I have only seen 1 Biden sign anywhere around here, Trump signs and flags everywhere! Life is grand!
who is also demented as fuck oh wait are we talking about trump or biden
This tweet comes soon after he says he loves the Constitution more than Biden...  hashtag not how it works
yes 😩😩👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 daddy joe biden will save us fwom the big bad cowona 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
So that means Republicans that don't like Trump will vote him...Because Democrats will still going to vote for a Democrat..Biden
Never Trump means Biden and that is bad for America
I understand she worked for fox and is Republican...But if she still in the " It depends on Biden V.P. pick"  phase ..After "All" Trump has done and is doing...Then she was never going to vote for Biden anyways..
He will try anything to win, his new thing is that Joe Biden will hurt God.  Yea right
But Biden is going to hurt G-d, y'all.
Trump Outraised Biden In July and Not by a Small Amount
Maybe that’s how the election should be decided with a winner take all race between Biden and Trump!
Then you don't really want to vote for Biden
I'm all for letting Kanye debate! But instead of Trump &amp; Biden, could we have a full on rap-battle debate with Kanye and Lin-Manuel?
Wow. Biden can hurt God!

But she doesn't think Biden is? 😂😂 The narrative is so blatantly obvious it's hilarious
And they call Joe Biden nuts....
It’s like he gets cue cards with bullet points of what he thinks the voters want and then goes out and says, “Biden hates...”
Breaking: Joe Biden plans to use Vulcan Death grip on God, let AOC rule the 9 realms at his side.
Is Biden a doddering fool or is he somehow powerful enough to "hurt God"?  Get your nonsense argument straight,
The progressive movement has real traction now and is gaining ground with every election. So, the establishment ain't what it used to be. True, it's not dead yet, but I prefer to remain open to hopeful possibilities. If Biden has the support of a flipped Senate, he can do a lot!
Biden would never get the bonus points for remembering them in order!! Several questions later no less!
Biden might be more Catholic than the last Pope.
I believe this is my favorite picture of Biden. A man who knows to pray.💗
Someone mail this to Joe Biden’s house once a week.
It's pretty hilarious to criticize Biden for implying that black Americans are a homogeneous group while at the same time claiming to speak for "our people" as if they are a homogeneous group.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
It's not as simple as all that. People are more than their views on the issues. They are also defined by their integrity, and Biden's principles are deep-seated. He is not going to give Trump a free pass for his many crimes.
You'll be inspired again just by listening. Obama was and is an inspiring leader. I think Joe Biden is and will be also
Biden could take a dump on national TV and I’d still vote for him.
This guy is a tool bag if you vote Biden please do not be friends with me
I gave them both money. Miss them both. I am voting for Biden, but he was not in my top five.
the biden campaign now needs to come down hard on this,  the magas lost an attack vector and the administration unwittingly caused the investigation to be revealed
You could promise me a million dollars and I would still vote for Joe Biden.
I’m attending The National Education Association’s event, “Virtual Town Hall on Reopening Schools with Jill Biden and NEA President Lily Eskelsen García” – sign up now to join me! #StrongPublicSchools
There is literally nothing Trump could say in a debate that would make me reconsider voting for Joe Biden, even for a second.
At least Joe Biden could quote his favorite verse and knows there is not a book called "Two Corinthians."
Trust me both sides want it, I feel Trump has been selected to bring in Police State. Running Biden so he's reelected.
Biden could make an ad about being able to eat a cheese sandwich and I would still take him over trump. Our country needs stability and leadership. Biden will bring that until we can get 2 viable choices for change in 2024.
true patriots, vote Biden no mattter what! as i will!

No he won’t and no he isn’t.  I live in and travel all over Pa.  no Biden signs.  Trump signs everywhere.
All Biden has to do is talk sense and facts. Trump will bluster and call him names. If does he say anything in response, demand his sources.
Corn Row Biden hanging with his old nemesis, Corn Pop.
Hopefully with Mr Biden many of us will be spared your pain and heartbreak. Sorry for the loss of your daughter, losing a child is painful, losing a child the way you did I cannot imagine your pain.
I think it's up to Biden.
Did I or did I not state that this entire event was cooked up by Trump and the GOP to divert votes from Biden? Kanye has been a huge Trump supporter. Suddenly, he wants to run against him? No f'ing way. It's all a scam existing solely to steal Biden votes. Don't fall for it.
And they have to know that more Republicans will vote for him ..Taking votes away from Trump...Not Biden
Hillary planned Biden. She’s waiting in wings to SAVE
Jimmy boy isc easily confused &amp; can’t find his ass with either hand. Expecting any more from him is like expecting Joe Biden Or Bill Clinton to stop fondling young Girls.
Sir! It's not the Trump campaign! For example, during the Democratic debates, anyone with an open-mind could realize that Joe Biden was struggling with his speech! In some interviews, that's happening too. Lastly, why is he rejecting an interview with Chris Wallace if he is okay?
i feel like trump and kanye have been planning this all along. they don’t want Biden to win and they know that Kanye isn’t gonna win so we’re gonna be stuck with Trump for another four years. very nice 👍🏻 and cool 😎
I can criticize Trump for being many things: thin-skinned, childish, arrogant, condescending, a bully, a conspiracy theorist; but the fact that Trump supporters go after Biden for losing his mind when Trump isn't too far behind in that category isn't a good strategy.

They are already saying Russia is trying to rig this election. Can you imagine if trump beats Biden that they will push another Russia hoax on everybody cause they didn't win again
I'm probably gonna get banned soon so just gonna put this out there- I think when it's time for Biden to debate  he will then test positive for covid19 allowing him to avoid the Trump beat down and remain in his basement until election
He could literally be a cheese sandwich with a Biden pin and I would rather vote for him
one thing about Biden, his dentures are dazzling, that smile just lights up the room. 🙄
and biden continues to disappoint with apparently ANOTHER attempt of consequence-lacking "rEfOrM"  ill take reform over nothing any day, but at the same time how will give that reform WEIGHT and CONSEQUENCE for officers who do not follow those new policies?
this is amazing, i never dreamed back in 1988 when i was old enough to vote,  that i would be interacting with the account of a living VP (joe biden)!
Riden with Biden!!!!!
Trump Campaign Savages Basement Biden in New Ad, "Alone. Hiding. Diminished." (VIDEO)  via
"Trump campaign ad against Joe Biden contains a number of doctored images, CNN and WaPo report"
But trump will not refuse to leave. Many strategists believe he will set up a cable network, steal Fox loyalists, rant for two hours a day how he was robbed and attack Biden, and try to run himself or through his children in 2024. This is most in keeping with trump's nature.
Would you be opposed to a live televised cognitive test performed by Trump and Biden?  If so, why?  BTW, rejecting same based upon a claim that same is just a 'stunt' (or similar inference) will be deemed as conceding that Trump would do far better than Biden in that test.
Then no charges until Biden in office.
And they keep saying NOBODY is above the law. Then why isn't Hillary, Holder, Rice, Yates, Comey, Brennan, Clapper and others in jail if that is true? Oh I forgot Obama. Reason they want Biden in so he can spit out pardons like there's no tomorrow.
this is my answer to Joe Biden. I love your commentary &amp; how you tear libs apart. Keep it up my brother! Mike, Allentown, Pa.
campaign lying again by altering photos/videos of Mr. Biden. #TrumpCantKeepItUp
I was hoping Biden would invite Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal and have them sit on either side of Hunter Biden in the guest area.   Then he could point and say, "There's Hunter!" and watch Trump turn all red and soil himself.
*coffee break thoughts*  Why is it weak for Biden to speak from Delaware but strong for Trump to speak from DC?  *petty coffee break thoughts*   Gee, I hope Wisconsinites will vote for Biden even if he doesn't go there.

Serious question, is there any real chance that this pulls enough votes from Biden to make a difference?  I can't imagine anyone who takes the time to vote arriving and pulling the lever (or better yet, taking the time to mail in the ballot) for Kanye...
is mentally unstable to be  period. He should take a test.
Back to work today.  Sad because top boss made a Joe Biden joke, which lets me know he still hasn't seen the light yet.  Don't understand it because he is very intelligent.  Starting to wonder if I am wrong.
1987 Joe was later caught plagiarizing again while a US Senator running for President.  “Biden had lifted phrases and mannerisms from a British Labour Party politician while making closing remarks at a debate.” WaPo = source. Note the soft wording - lifted. Synonyms-stole/theived
1987-  acknowledged ''a mistake'' in his youth. He plagiarized a law review article for a paper he wrote in his first year at law school. RE: Joe CHEATED - in a disciple where truth telling &amp; obeying the law/rules is the preeminent objective. That’s the real Joe Biden.
Biden was un-good before during &amp; after college. He was such a bad lawyer he managed real estate after graduating!
I just KNOW Biden's critics on the left will accuse him of "rushing the vetting process." They won't be satisfied unless their golden girl is his running mate.
I want Cheetolini out and Biden will at least do something to heal instead of continue to tear this country apart
Biden couldn’t pass a driving test now if he tried
Robin Williams – Rambling Joe Biden  via
Whoever Biden picks as his running mate in the next week or two is not going to be everyone's 1st choice. She's going to get the full misogynistic treatment that awaits so many public women. Think carefully before you post hot-takes or memes or images. Eyes on the prize, please.
If you were part of the Democrat establishment, you’d probably try to weasel Joe Biden out of the debates. They’ve kept him in a basement while   has done the real work of our country. #Trump2020
Yo- he's agreed to 3 debates-  they are waiting on Trump - Once again the Alt Right Creeps get it wrong
i will vote for biden regardless of who he picks, however, we want him to win as decisively as possible and have the cleanest staff on his administration as possible

Sister Toldjah  I guess you missed this huh?
I live in the lehigh valley area I cant see Biden winning out here
If Biden tries to get out of debating Trump trump should automatically win by default Biden should be proclaimed disqualified and Trump automatically becomes president for four more years if you can’t debate you can’t be president
I hope she is as outraged at the Trump campaign buying ads to try and cancel Joe Biden’s bid for the presidency
Can it be any more obvious that Biden obviously is not capable of standing on a debate stage with President Trump he can’t even do an interview with Chris Wallace getting softball questions obviously hiding Biden don’t have all of his marbles

i hope biden's first response team sees the amplification attempt and also the sabotage attempt of using possibly legally tainted candidates
Operation “let him talk” is working out well for Joe Biden.
it seems that people are trying to sabotage biden
But we're going to take OUR country back from the likes of Trump. Many of these Trumpers who have let out all their ugly behaviors are doing it because they feel emboldened by Trump. When he's gone they won't feel emboldened to spew their hate. Biden has a big job ahead!
I have to say...I am so proud to come from a State that hails so many Patriots. In 8 MONTHS of this year, I have NOT seen ONE Biden sticker, ONE yard sign. And our awesome Governor Abbott not only allows our police to do their job, he EXPECTS it. Thank you, Gov. Abbott!!🇺🇸
Trump's new line of attack on Biden is an old campaign standby
Because Biden has been in politics for 40 + years and hasn't done shit except line his pockets as well as hid kids.
It’s amazing that for months conservatives have been predicting that Biden will skip out on the debates  And right on queue his media allies are laying all the groundwork for it
I don't need reasons not to vote for Trump. I need a few reasons to vote for Biden. Just a few.

Man.    You guys are so up the creek this time.    Joe Biden was the least liberal of all the candidates.   You can try to paint him however you want, but no one but your base is going to believe that he's some crazy Marxist.
Biden speaks and is speaking rather eloquently. Have you heard either of them speaking recently?  Trump is in some serious trouble. Trump is going to lose badly, but that's not the half of it, he'll be "destroyed"personally&amp;  in questionable "business" by revelations on his taxes
Y’all chose BIDEN as your candidate.  And you ask that question?  Nobody - NOBODY - in politics believes he has any chance. The whole thing is a joke.  McCain stood a better chance than Biden does, and McCain was there because it was “his turn.”  This is Biden’s turn. He’ll lose.
It is obvious that the dirty Democrats are so desperate there is no way in hell they will allow Joe Biden to get on the stage and debate President Trump The Democrats think the American people are stupid let’s prove these filthy animal wrong and vote red November
The only person who doesn't have a guess who the VP pick will be is Joe Biden. He's waiting to be told.

Oh! So you're making excuses for Joe Biden's horrible behavior! Democrats are so hypocritical. Believe all women-even Joe Biden said so- until Joe Biden is accused of rape. They attack Trump for his behavior toward women while defending Biden's! If Trump is wrong, so is Biden!

I dont think biden has a chance in anywhere but the major cities in pa
Biden said, “We’ve had racists, and they’ve existed, they’ve tried to get elected president. He’s (Trump) the first one that has.”  But as Charlamagne points out, that’s a lie. In fact, 12 American presidents were even slave owners.

I don’t even know if Biden will beat trump. I live in Pa and all I see are trump signs. I think they’re are voters who will vote for him regardless of his stupidity. Biden will pick a female of color because he needs the votes, but I don’t think it’s enough for him to win
When Biden was younger he had no problem with speaking. He stutters because his brain can't think quickly and if you can't think quickly you don't need to be elected into the most powerful position.

Everyone saying biden is gonna cheat with mail in voting, but honestly It will be Donald trump the one who will be cheating. Why do you think he doesn't fund the post office in these covid relief bills ? Why do you think he appointed his own person to be in charge of the P.O
I am voting against trump regardless, but heard persuasive argument to not debate.  They wont debate real issues because trump just lies about everything, however. With no crowd to cheer him on with his zingers????  That gives biden an advantage.
Oh definitely not irrelevant. It's just that the "Biden should pick a black woman" quip by white folks isn't helping anyone.  It'll be historical, &amp; noteworthy, but tweets like Griffin's or Klobuchar's is more about them getting attention than suggesting the best candidate.
It wouldn't be the first time we've expanded/rearranged political powers &amp; norms though &amp; won't be the last.  But it would appear very very fishy globally &amp; domestically if Biden didn't run again &amp; the de facto chief  investigator of fraud in the opposing party was the favorite.

Man your twitter feed has a lot of pro Biden promos I’m impressed
Good name calling try this name on for size President Biden
That kind of reasoning is how we ended up in this mess. As a Republican Senator you could either join the POTUS and McConnell or be ostracized as a traitor to the party. They chose wrong. Biden has unprecedented support from groups never even imagined, he needs to choose wisely.
No, Bernie never wanted to win. Bernie, is in Democratic party, to stop the left wing from forming a third party. He corrals them into, voting for Hilary or Biden. Bernie is a democrat trust me, zero backbone. 2016 he agreed well before convention to not attack hillary.
Sleepy Biden like you call him is going to sweep the floor with you come Election Day. Your loosing voters. Get off Twitter and go do something productive for once. Get off Obama’s, and Hillary’s ass already you HATER.
My take is that Karen Bass is more likely.  Head of the Congressional Black Caucus, former Speaker of the CA Assembly.  She’s a safer bet than Harris for Biden, and helps him avoid the ire of the Berniecrats who loathe Harris.  Profile in Courage Award for her work 2008-10.
LOL 😂🤣 I see what you did there!  Humorous.  Too bad that sense of humor doesn't extend to the Cheeto Faced Twat Waffle   As for Biden, just navigate over to  to find out if you're correct  Use of fingers and thumbs required of course. Do the "I'm not a Robot" thing 🤣
Biden could not take a piss next to TRUMP!
Then if Biden doesn’t win WE CONTEST THE ELECTION. It has been said that voter fraud is much easier to detect NOT easier to commit fraud.  So if the fraud is done by his people it should be easy to prove.
Someone said other VP candidates were dropping oppo on Bass.  But I'm convinced team Biden is doing it after building her up so that it looks like they have no choice but to make "safe" pick in Harris.
You did not beat Obama, you didn't even beat Biden. Obama would have cleaned your clock far worse than Biden will. Resign already!

Biden is only  4% to 5% ahead of Trump in the fake polls  ,remember back in 2014 during the indy ref the polls had the yes movement ahead and look how that turned out
I'll do you one better.   My biggest concern (assuming Biden wins) is that, by failing to implement left-leaning policies that could destroy Trumpism root &amp; branch, Biden loses to fitter/happier/more productive Trump 2.0 in 2024.    &amp; that's when fascist nightmare REALLY begins.
His entire early career took off because he had housing integration as one of his primary policies which endeared him to the black voters of DE.  Several references throughout the article.   Again, not a fan of his busing stance, but the facts don't lie.
Definitely not wanting to debate which group is more diverse, I am just disappointed in Biden making the comparison. I feel it's a legitimate concern he needs to respect the diversity of thought in the black community, and this isn't the first time. Hoping he will finally grow.
That was my question. How can trump continue to assert exec priv after he’s out of office if Biden says to McGahn that nothing he might testify to is privileged?
dude. if biden said it instead of trump - even in a theoretically identical context - you’d be hooting and howling that his brain is broken. (you’d be 100% correct. biden’s brain is a dumpster fire!)  so just admit you are reflexively being a lapdog making excuses for trump.
No one who would vote for Kanye was ever going to vote to begin with, let alone vote for Biden.

Both are poor choices. However political necessity demands that we remove Trump ASAP. Biden is the only choice. This demonstrates the bankruptcy of the political system which depends on stupidity and ignorance to elect a government!

If Joe Biden had made any comparison to the Jewish Community to the Hispanic community they would call him anti semetic and he wouldnt be running for president, but cause it's black people y'all understand and riding for Biden. Smh you wonder why?
Trumpy says Biden is radical, wants to take yr guns and "hurt God". Fact is the radical left now is armed. And if you believe in God, you'd know God can't be hurt. Esp not by the Dems. Way too disorganized, and also to attack God you need balls. #DumpTrump2020 #WritingCommunity

Clyburn: Trump Campaign Is Helping Kanye West to Get on State Ballots to Take Biden Votes  via
So, they want Black voters for Biden to vote for him. I I don't really know how Black people feel, being old and white. I watch TV, I know how famous Black people are thinking, but not how middle-class Black voters do.  Its not real, do they know that? He's manic, unwell, sad.
He will get destroyed in this, but he might take some votes away from Biden. They don't care about destroying West, they just care about cheating.
I actually think this is wrong. They've made Biden out to be essentially incapable of forming a coherent thought and hung their hat on Trump's debate skills (which don't actually exist) allowing Trump to disembowel Biden on national television and leapfrog into the lead.
Infuriating! Trump allies, experienced in voter suppression, are working to get Kanye West on the ballot in several key battleground states as an attempt to siphon votes from Biden:  #Election2020 #KanyeWest

I dont like politicians. But pressuring them is good.   Pressuring them creates better policies. I don’t see enough pressure on Biden and Im concerned. Greatly.
If  chose a toaster oven for his running mate he should still get your vote. Given the horrific havoc and destruction that  has wrought upon our country how can you possibly say that voting for Biden depends on who he selects for his running mate?!
Biden is a total idiot and a scumbag
If that's true then Biden should be dying to debate him, instead of going out of his way to avoid facing Trump in any debates
I heard his rebuttal,  on what he didn't mean. Still unanswered Mr. Biden, is What did you mean?
Hell no. That’s why I’m voting for Joe Biden.
Wheeler is pathetic, trying to make common cause with animals trying to kill his police officers by setting the police station on fire. It is a battle of wills, and he has lost.  The predators can smell his fear. A Biden victory will do nothing to satiate these thugs.

I think major problem with kamala harris is that no one actually likes her as we saw when she didn't even make it to Iowa and  was losing in her home state. She's definitely moderate/conservative though and biden IS courting the Republican vote so maybe she the best for that.
If Biden could hurt God, that would mean he's more powerful than God and that He needs our protection (by voting for trumpy), right?
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden faces new scrutiny over how he discusses race and ethnicity after drawing distinctions between Black and Latino populations in the United States.
I just hate how comfortable we’ve made Joe Biden. At least Hillary felt some pressure to be more progressive with certain policies. Obviously most of us were still voting for her but there was more accountability to me.

I think there's a difference between criticizing Biden for the next four years and criticizing him for the next three months.  There are a lot of disaffected supporters of other candidates and some Republicans who sort of want to vote for Joe, but it won't take much to deter them
As for history, don't post something praising Biden when he has not done a single thing to work towards the goals you claim he's in favor of. That shows a lack of historical knowledge.
Instead of continuously assuring Joe Biden that he has our vote we need to pressure him for better policies. Nobody is entitled to a vote.   And if anybody says that “Trump is worse” Im going to block you. BIDEN needs better policies.
Here’s hoping that Biden doesn’t choose Palin as his VP. …heh.
A. Biden is hiding in his basement. It's a fact. You don't have to be a Trump supporter to want him to be more involved in his own campaign. B. It is Trump Derangement Syndrome to want war just to spite Trump, which is what you want.  Facts aren't attacks.

Biden and Obama people think just like the Game of Thrones writers, like if only the tyrant can be deposed and the "right person and name" can get elected instead everything will be perfectly fine
Are you referring to Biden?
BIden sounds bad ass
So my Green vote is a vote for someone, not against someone else. I don't magically get 3 votes because I vote for Hawkins. It's on Biden to convince me to do otherwise.
I can just easily say "Voting Green is a vote for Biden". Facts are that Biden created Trump and helped give him dictatorial powers during the 40 years he was an elected official. Biden even put Scalia and Thomas in the SCOTUS. Trump is at least trying to get out of Afghanistan.
You don't get it. Also, shouldn't you be off badmouthing Joe Biden and the Democrats?   Admit it, even if Biden picked Bass, who brings nothing to the ticket politically, you still wouldn't support him. So again - who cares about your opinion?

I’m not trying to have a “discussion” with you.  This isnt a “dialogue.”  Idgaf abt your feelings. I’m not offering you a MF’ing cookie for doing the *bare MF’ing minimum* to stop fascism.  If you’re voting for Biden; STFU &amp; vote.  Grown folks dont give af if you’re “excited.” 🤷🏿‍♂️
there's no version of better that this election will create, period.   but i understand wanting Biden's racism over Trump's.

As an old white woman, I am unfamiliar with most of African American, Black cultures here in America. So, hearing that Kanye wants to peel votes away from Biden, I realize I have no idea if that is possible. Is that possible, that people will not see he is not well, manic, so sad
Civil rights lawyer Leo Terrell was a bit more direct in his recent interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity, declaring Biden a “racist." He added that the former vice president has "the mindset of a plantation owner."
Based on Trump still having decent ratings on the economy in polls. He still leads Biden on that issue in most polls, makes me think a slight economic rebound between now and election day won't help him much. That's already baked in.
I hate to be the bearer of bad news but Joe Biden is not getting elected president
And don't forget about his racist tweet biden did yesterday bit I guess it doesn't fit this jackals Peter King narrative
If i see one more white person who posted a bunch of BLM stuff then say "ur being selfish and u r privileged if you think its a better idea to vote third party than biden" when it is right in front of their eyes that it doesnt matter... electric chair
Saying you're not voting for Trump is not the same thing as saying that you are voting for Biden.
I think we should definitely keep trying to appease the deadend Bernie cultists who vilify the Democratic party at every opportunity and have sworn they won't vote for Biden no matter what.
34 minutes ago, you posted that you wouldn't be voting for Biden.  No matter what he does, you deadend Socialists won't support him, so why should anyone care about your opinion?
Not all of them are Racist; some #ProLifers .. but it is sad that they voted &amp; supported one..!! ~ I phone bank 4 #BacktoBlue PA DEMS &amp; I have chatted with quite a few Republicans, many who are voting Biden. Others  were respectful, but wouldn't discuss who they were supporting
Just because I’m going to vote for him does not mean I’m not going to hold him accountable when he says stupid things.  I think Biden would be better off just keeping his mouth shut and just continuing to allow Trump to dig his own tomb.
a vote for biden is a vote for MORE THAN HIM. the president is a tiny little part of the whole governmental process. he is able to appoint sc justices, important gov officials etc. THIS IS MORE THAN JUST PRESIDENCY. if you dont fuck with biden fine. but think of the WHOLE PICTURE
Nice double move.  You say Biden is not a racist then to on to confirm that he is a racist.
I don’t see Biden schmovin, he gon lose
Correction: If Biden is elected president, he will hurt *a* bible.
talks about a rigged election and that mail in ballots are fraudulent. So we can assume if for some reason trump wins that the election was rigged.  Afterall that's all he's talking about.  Or does it mean its only rigged if Biden wins?

We're discussing Joe Biden so your comments are not relevant. But God bless you &amp; your family!
Diaper Donnie's latest desperate ploy is attacking Biden as "anti-God." Biden is a serious Catholic; Trump is a fraud (remember "Two Corinthians"?). Here is what the National Catholic Register said:
At the very least being left and undecided gives us some leverage over Biden's platform. Biden is untrustworthy (to say the least) so any remaining leverage the left has should be used tactically. It's not much but it's all we have in a general election in our duopoly.
Joe Biden will announce his selection for VP. WE WILL ALL HAVE OPINIONS. But, if we don’t accept, embrace and drive forward with strength and heart, we will have 4 more years of Trump. Do any of you  really want that?
The godless POS in the WH is desperate.  Trying to get a rise from Biden in the worst way possible.
Biden literally cannot stop himself from being racist.
I'm voting Hawkins and down-ballot third-party candidates. People unfriend me since I live in a swing state, but I'm done voting out of fear. Honestly, Trump is the lesser evil since people actually pay attention to him and he is trying to get out of 2 wars. Biden wants more.
He probably will take a few thousand votes from Biden in each state, but black voters, especially black women, have shown they are the most practical Dem constituency. This won't be a Stein repeat with young white leftists wasting their votes.
Idk, politicians like Biden and Even Biden himself are the reason America are in this damn mess.    It’s literally damned if i do, damned if i don’t
Reading this sheet, it seems like basically the entire RCP tightening is due to HarrisX going from Biden +10 to Biden +3 (plus Rasmussen, which you don't have on your sheet).

Stupid Tweet .. b/c Biden chose to run.. Matter of fact he ran for President the same year that Pres. Obama chose him to be his running mate..!!!  (2008)
Trump losing is not a guarantee. Biden up 3% nationally &amp; within the margin of error in several swing states ain't gonna cut it.
Can you imagine supporting trump and calling Joe Biden racist lol. Joe is not educated on race. He can be ignorant - trump is hateful and ignorant. trump enjoys hurting people and his supporters enjoy when he hurts anyone who isn’t white right wing nut cult “Christians”.
Please don’t fall for the foolishness..only two choices Biden or the Devil..
So is Biden going to accept the nomination and then back out 24 hours later?
I chuckle when i see Trump call Biden “Sleepy Joe”
Imagine thinking Joe Biden would be a great president. Like he, at MOST, is an "I fucking guess" kinda candidate
Absurdly cruel and unusual. The 5 justices who voted to uphold the life sentence of a 62 year old man for attempting to steal hedge clippers are not fit to serve on the highest court in the state, however low that bar may be. Biden should pledge to pardon.
you probably won't "read" this but Biden is a devout Catholic, you are a #FakeChristian and #Biblicalidiot.
Well lets see, a third generation racist is call out Biden for something  he said during an interview with black and brown reporters. I haven't seen anything by these people that wiuld suggest they were upset with it. The trump money came from slum landlord owned properties.
Neither is joe biden so its a lose lose either fucking way
I hate Kanye West, his primary agenda is to gain more attention and steal votes from Biden.
... for Trump if the election was held today. So no, the black vote isnt the problem. Just like it wasn't the problem when Hillary got the majority vote by 3 million.   Also, we have to stop acting like Biden is this great white hope and soooooooo much better than Trump. He's not
Biden thinks he needs the “black vote”. So even if shallow, he’s working for it.  Trump thinks he already has it or will have it by default of folks not choosing Biden. It’s the same complacency that cost Hillary the election.
I'm glad you're mad. Biden can't be pushed. My dude wants to increase funding to police. He has a history of trying to cut social programs and he's also a racist. 4 years of Trump or 8 years of Biden/whatever corporate scum is his VP? I won't be responsible for either. Good luck.
It’s not if you change the channel, they’re bringing on doctors non stop to talk about how much Biden is losing it. There is no such thing as “the media” in the US
How are Biden's "clarifications" any better than what he originally said? He proves time and time again he is NOT the one the lead on racial issues...or anything, really. Hope you're happy, liberals.

Don’t go by what one guy says. Don’t get complacent. Get active.   Here’s where you can volunteer to make phone calls for Joe Biden:
I'm sure trump will outdo Biden with a lot of "beautiful" "the greatest" "no president has done more than me", meanwhile Biden will do something trump never gave a thought to...a plan for the Pandemic, a plan for infrastructure. All trump gave was lip service
“here’s the Deal...” there will be plenty of material for Commics if Biden is allowed to speak and answer questions.  No shortage of laughs (or tears ), on either side.
Did you see what Biden said not only once but twice yesterday which was completely unacceptable. The problem with him is continually puts his foot in his mouth. He'll get a pass only because Trump is so bad
Of course this is designed to hurt Biden. But the people can’t be fooled... let’s hope
Biden is definitely a pedophile if he likes little kids rubbing his legs. Don’t defend him.
It’s not just Latinos voting for Biden cuz the Democrats sucks at Politics.  We’re all in that boat.
new podcast episode out now as you can tell by the title it’s alot of joe biden slander ao tune it
You know why  is worse than  ? He's the reason for the saying keep your friends close keep your enemies closer. You know Trumps a soulless bigot . But Biden pretends to care and cater to colored communities when he's directly destroyed them for decades.
You really need to get over yourself. If you are supporting Biden then you are supporting a female Vice President running the country, you are undermining the democratic process.
What Joe Biden meant,, I think, was that African Americans are mostly all from the USA, and Hispanics can come from many different countries, and Mexican culture is different from Puerto Rican culture or Venezuelan culture. I listened to it a few times, I think this is it.
Before mocking Joe Biden, Trump needs to learn how to pronounce the name of the National Parks at the very least. Yosemite is not Yo semite. Unless of course he's planning on renaming it to Yo semite National Park.

Biden is the best you can do?  Of course Trump has a path to being re-elected.
It’s makes so much sense for Biden to pick a black women for VP. White people write history. He will be Abe Lincoln to future generations but it also makes sense right now. Plus, knowing Joe, he will have to apologize 2 or 3 more times for saying something dumb. Just do it.
Here is a pic of Biden after someone told him his incredibly racist statement was racist.

Biden really cannot enforce something like that, which intervenes in a company and goes against free speech; Twitter itself is the entity that has the power to manage that, just as it *could* today, if it wanted to.
Trump wants Biden to take the same test that he took and brags about passing it. The test in question is easy to pass for anyone who doesn't have dementia. Unless Biden's doctor recommends that he takes the test there's no need for him to do so. #Biden #TrumpIsALaughingStock

You could be right. This is why I'm surprised Warren has kinda disappeared from the conversation. She's extremely popular and appears to have a good relationship with Biden.
The whole Democratic party is not worthy of the black vote or any other persons vote.  They're all a disgrace and Joe Biden is an old school Democrat who in his demented state can't help but let the cat out of the bag demonstrating how that party feels about Americans.

bro, joe biden carries himself like a toddler talking about his favorite hot wheelz
VP Biden is trying to choose a VP with the same chemistry. I don’t believe now or previous 45x he’s gonna match this ‘God Thang’! 🙏🏽❤️
also trump has lawsuits for discrimination against him when he ran casinos and hotels. biden has made some bad comments but no where near as bad as trump
Someone edited that clip. He actually said, "the polls for Biden look great."
Yep, because Obama knew African Americans would vote for him anyway. Biden's voting record is.... interesting to say the least.
Fake NeverTrumper! I guess that she can ignore the 160k deaths, impeachment, more impeachable offenses everyday, alleged rapist judges, end of the rule of law, kids in cages, etc. If Biden picks Lindsay Lohan, even crazier, Dina Lohan, it is still better than Trump.
Im okay with Susan Rice as VP. Biden will make Kamala the AG.
Biden's birthplace. Because he's from Scranton, they want us to believe he's a "blue collar" politician. He ripped corporate haven Delaware for 36 years, those interests are who he truly represents.
Joe Biden is enough of a balanced mulligan to take a pretty solid bet for most people.  I know what we have is not working.
I will say Biden won’t appoint union busters to the NLRB ( as Trump has ) , he won’t attack reproductive rights and he’ll probably pick a marginally better SCOTUS nominee but he’s so inadequate overall .
Gotta respect the Joe Biden campaign plan of let Trump continue shooting himself in the foot while doing/saying almost nothing.

A debate is only fair for the American People to see, hear, and judge the candidates before voting begins.  After all, it's not like Joe Biden has a exhausting travel schedule, no instead in the Basement, wrapped in a Snuggy, drinking ensure and eating pudding pops.
The second we vote for Biden, we give them consent to screw the Left again. Biden &amp; hack politicians like him created Trump. He doesn't deserve our vote or support.

My take on Biden is he gets no quarter , no slack . Once the Trump nightmare is over there’s no grace period .

Ain’t no way he’s voting for Biden. No one should since he’s so obviously lost his mind
Just like how Biden said you ain’t black if you don’t vote for him? isn’t that an attempt to shame african anericans into voting for him? who is he to try and dictate how a whole race decides to vote?
Just bite the bullet and vote. Biden has oatmeal brain but that administration will competent and that’s all we can really ask for at this point.
Joe Biden as a freshman senator, said he would not have any interest in the stock market. To this day, that is the case. No stock. How is he so 'owned by corporate interests'  exactly?
I like you, friend, but I can’t be quiet about Biden being racist. Whyte people have got to stop giving passes to racism because it’s convenient. Biden is a racist.  If you want to argue he’s stil a better vote, then do that, but don’t brush off valid criticisms of racism for it.

Wanna beat Trump,  Fire your crappy strategists and hire me. Your people suck. Biden sucks. Your whole plan of attack on Donald Trump sucks
don't get me started on various church leaders or friggen Bibi Netanyahu . . . Trump's assertions yesterday about Biden &amp; how he's the one protecting G-d etc is very much him falsely anointing himself as G-d's champion speaking 4 G-d, etc.
Bingo and he doesn’t attack American ideals, values and institutions or honorable people.  And he cares about people other than himself. You could write a book about how much better Biden is than Trump. A whole series of books.
He is a republican,  right? Why on Earth would a Democrat vote for him? Wouldn't he take votes away from Donald??? Also, Biden voters are not insane, or stupid. He is manic. He will crash without his meds, sooner or later. This is such a waste of oxygen, in the media, its August
I would vote for Joe Budden before I vote for Joe Biden
Lol Biden said we are diverse- not all of us need to jump walls to make a living, Earl
You’re right, it is so important not to misrepresent or exaggerate racism. Which is why it is also important not to pretend like Biden hasn’t said a lot of racist comments. I’m not arguing about climate because that ain’t the point here. The point is, we need to criticize our own

Nobody cares if you like Biden or not. It’s just lazy to say we have two bad candidates when they are near polar opposites. It’s just lazy. Say Biden wasn’t your first choice of a D nominee but the false equivalence between him and Trump is so old and without merit. Grow up.
90 days out Biden is positioned with about the same lead as Clinton in 2016. It feels like we need more than occasional Medium statements at this point in time, don’t you think?
Clock is ticking Adolf... have the missus get The Rose Garden fixed up for The Biden’s for January 2021.
Trump will have attacks ready for no matter who the VP nominee is and the media will gladly play along attacking a female pol. So Biden should just pick the one he thinks would be the best partner/future POTUS and do the least harm. Biden and Obama had lunch together weekly.
Biden definitely does not have the "x factor." I think what she's referring to isn't so much about corporatism as it is so much about being relatable, and articulate enough to be able to deliver your point affectively enough to catch the attention of those unfamiliar with them
Biden is also starting up shit too, saying that Latinos are more diverse than Black Americans/ADOS, so he will not win due to that too. He’s still butt sore that we’re asking for our reparations. I hope he loses at this point.

I see the enthusiasm too Eric but, alas, it's for Joe Biden. Right now it looks it would amount to a Biden landslide of a magnitude of 334 to 413 electoral votes (270 are required to win). What polls were you reciting Eric?
How old are you?  Perhaps you're not aware of #JoeBiden's long history of not taking responsibility or criticism at all. Then trying to spin it away.   Believe Acts, not words: 45 yrs of #Biden racism, countless lies, corruption &amp; grift.  Biden's 45 yrs vs Trump's 3.5 yrs?
I want Biden to win but there is a basic problem with that map they put up : They didn't show leaning vs solid. Anywhere where Biden even had a 0.01% advantage was colored in blue for Biden. State polls have a MOE of 3-4%, so unless Biden has a lead of 4+% it really shouldn't be
It's a stupid phrase used by stupid people. You can discuss why Biden earned so many Black votes without acting like Black people are a monolith, using a phrase that doesn't make sense.

They are. n = 200 is not enough to have an accurate poll. I don't think anyone is questioning Biden's solid position in Michigan, plenty of other polls have shown that (like this one). But n = 200 is straight trash, MOE of 6.9%.
And when it came down to the top two, one of those candidates was Bernie, the only good old white dude we had to offer, and shit still somehow came down to Biden.  This is all coming from someone who absolutely refused to vote Hillary in 2016. Shut up about it already.
"Damn so you really rooting for Biden the dementia patient over Trump?"  Ard dickhead what other choices you got? Oh wait we had a whole primary with plenty of other viable candidates that weren't old white dudes actually were good picking and yall yeeted every last one.

Trump: Supports Nazis, defends the KKK, and attacks BLM protestors with armed stormtroopers.  Joe Biden: Put his foot in his mouth about the diversity of the black community.  Trump supporters: See! Biden is racist!

I think they're having the first fight of the Biden administration. If the GOP thought goosing the economy could help their chances this fall they'd be printing money, but they're moving on.
He is a rich man with access and privilege who is willing to hurt or allow to be hurt countless Black and brown lives for his own benefit. This isn't about whether Biden cares about Black folk, it's about Kanye not caring.  All skinfolk ain't kinfolk!

Trump has nothing to run on. His resume as president is abysmal. So he as decided to not run on a platform of "Vote for me" and instead say "Vote against Biden". It's a sign that Trump has nothing.
cringe atheist musing: it is intriguing, the extent to which god in the old testament is portrayed as fundamentally human, with human tendencies, a human face, and even a human body. maybe trump wasn't entirely off about biden being able to "hurt god".
You just described a racist, Ari. If you yourself made that “junkie” comment you’d rightfully be labeled a racist and Fox News would no longer keep you as a contributor. They’d get rid of you in less than an hour. It’s racist to say things like that. Biden does not get a pass.
As opposed to now, when federal agents are arresting protestors alongside a 10.2% unemployment rate?  You can’t act like things are good now, so if Biden wins 2020 you can complain he wrecked Trump’s country. The country is a wreck literate right now.
Biden is a racist, he can’t hide it, his record proves it, and his apologies are empty...
Fuck Joe Biden, if im voting its for the nigga yall hate. Facts.
So for the record, are liberals happy just electing Trump with a better social media team? Can't really see how this isn't what Biden is at this point or any point tbh.  Democrats have plans like "More access to HMOs for Covid patients!" and "Cheaper lawyers for the homeless!"

Biden said the African American community lacks diversity. What he meant was it was controlled, and that is factual. Obama picked Biden as his VP because he was a Average Joe, which is another term for Silent majority. Trump is in your face, Biden is behind your back.
Biden told us what every Democrat, from Antifa to Al Sharpton, thinks of Black people.
The real reason people object to Biden’s veep choices is that they’re bored and need to fill a voracious 24/7 news cycle with something.

Kanye is literally a black version of Trump. Zero political qualifications...thinks money will make him above the law...constant infantile meltdowns... Uncontrollable narcissism..  No thanks  We've had enough already. Shoulda maybe ran in 2016 🤷
This is literally my outlook, Torrey. If we manage to remove Trump, we in no way can let Biden off the hook and allow the Democrats to do whatever they wish. Trump has to go no matter what, though.
Although Joe Biden is a genuinely good human being, his tendency toward faux pas is well known. He must not get into the loose trump ad libs. Joe has legitimate goals for this country, so he will have to be more careful with his messaging.
Can't be sure. It's hard to know what Biden's up to down in that basement.
Biden could pick an empty chair as his running mate and I will still vote for him.
He was afraid if he stayed in until the convention that he would be blamed for the implosion and eventual loss.  He still believes that Biden winning is preferable to Trump winning, but he faced an incredibly biased race and let that a belief scare him out of attacking Biden.
PSS. I also credit my Catholic education for giving a starting vocabulary to the innate moral  compass based in empathy and compassion. I think Biden lives by it more than Trump does... by a mile. I also think most Americans see that.
How does anyone take this campaign seriously after running a transcendent campaign with the elegant and polished Obama.  This election is between Trump and whoever Biden is the point man for. It ain't Biden. No way no how.

No Joe Biden doesn't but if you really think Trump retardo style posts are going to make people believe this you need to try harder.
That is incredibly unlikely. Me getting stuck by lightning before November is more likely than Biden picking a Leftist.   He'll almost certainly pick a "moderate" approved by his corporate donors—to whom he promised that "nothing will fundamentally change".
Biden will pardon them all and say we need to move on. That is my greatest fear at this point. It will only embolden the GOP in the future if he does that. Not prosecuting finance execs after the 2008 crash did just that and here we are again at financial collapse.
So why did Junior self-publish his book attacking Biden?
Joe Biden has a poor record in DC, on top of the fact that using video footage of his own words and stumbles is more than enough to paint him as the wrong choice for voters.   The President doesn’t have to resort to such deeply personal attacks.

Even for a president known for his blunt criticism, Trump's remarks stood out and they signaled how contentious the campaign may get over the coming months.
Good morning Mrs. Harris, this is Howard U. Alumni Doug Payne. dpayne5 I would like to submit the song in this video to the Biden Campaign, but I need an email.
So the President made a bizarre statement yesterday. He claimed that  wants to “hurt God” and that he’s “against God &amp; against Guns”.    I must say the comment was a little defamatory considering that Joe Biden is a devout Catholic.
Hello Mr. Cooper, I would like to submit a song to the Biden Campaign, but I need a contact email. My email is dpayne5
Joe Biden’s policies destroyed the black community
tbh i think that game theory simulation of how all that might play out was quite interesting.
I would like to submit the song in this video to the Biden Campaign.
He could be watching Biden as POTUS from the Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora. Previously a hospital for the criminally insane, it would be a perfect place for him to spend the rest of his days.
I know Christian Walker. He loves Joe Biden❤️❤️This is simply a joke!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
How come all these people are disenfranchised? How come Obama didn't fix it, by law? Are you saying Biden is more progressive than Obama? If Obama didn't fix it why would Biden? This is already a dictatorship. Public opinion doesn't make policy. I refuse to participate.
Stop! To vote for trump because of a Biden vp pick is foolish. Remember trump’s vp is Pence.
Atleast Biden has experience and first hand knowledge of what it’s like to be in office being the VP for 8 years
I think they’re putting Biden out there now to fail so they can replace him. This could explain the delay in picking a VP candidate &amp; his announcement that he isn’t going to Milwaukee. With today’s climate? Michelle O would be almost unbeatable. Her election would be framed
Hannity hammers Biden after Democrat's latest race-related gaffe  via
Joe Biden please don't hurt God
Nope. They can fuck off. Btw, Biden said he's gonna increase police spending. Is that antifacsist? Is that what the moment calls for? I don't participate in organizations that don't share my values. I don't participate in processes where the fix is in.
you are so wrong Chris, but I know you think you know everything! By the way did you even get one interview with Joe Biden yet? Why aren't you pushing harder for that? You are part of the fake news right? If not prove it

And Biden’s strategy seems to be yours back in South Bend: shit on Black people and hope they keep to their Stockholm Syndrome. I don’t vote for racists. #votegreen2020
Expect daily apologies from Joe Biden.  Biden's handlers realize keeping Joe on a leash probably won't work.
You do realize the Russian invesitagin was actually a hoax and Obama Biden and FBI are all being invesitage and Trump was found to do no wrong doing right?
Depends. If they’re reasonable, we keep talking to them. If they’re dug in, they deserve to be harangued bc it’s a dangerous, self-indulgent, smug choice. If Angela Davis can vote for Biden so can they.
Biden wants god to die!
Biden will destroy YOUR GOD !!!! Also , random retweet of disinformation or a tweet of someone with a ✔️ that no one knows. Trumpist prophaganda peddlers really. Sad shame.  and now , oil, most fantastic time for oil in the history of oil!!! BUY OIL BABY!
Biden is a Final Fantasy protagonist?
I literally just yelled out “JOE BIDEN IS A FUCKING REPUBLICAN” and realized my window was open...and it’s 4am.
A modest proposal for anyone who doesn't like Trump: just shut up about Joe Biden's flaws until after the election, and if you absolutely have to criticize him, never forget to close with a reminder of how much worse Trump is on every score. It happens to be true, so just do it.
How is Joe Biden the pick for those who hate Trump? This is exactly what you blame and condemn Trump of. Joe Biden Says All Black People Are The Same!
I’m sorry but I see no difference between Biden and Trump 🤷🏽‍♂️
I hope this flies to, and i'll say good night with it unless it doesn't go. What i like here, It looks even more like Biden will get  ablue senate.
Biden had over 4 decades to fight for these things and even now spends all his time shitting on Black people and hiding in a basement. His priorities are not on this list. He’s already boasted about trying to cut Medicare/SSI and gave Bush a medal for war. No thanks.
I hope this flies too, and I'll say good night with it unless it doesn't go. What i like here, I think all of these debate changes would benifit Biden.
I hope this flies too, with typos fixed. What i like here, the best thing here is to, swamp the polls for Biden.
I hope this flies too, the long Trailer newsletter. What I like here, Biden and the debates, the back and forth over his platform, pro-Biden ads, increaded democratic turnout, and more.
Say what you will about Joe Biden, but the guy's got a cool car
Joe Biden clarifies that yes indeed he is a moron
Fam you telling me I gotta vote for Biden? I can’t skip this election???

Joe Biden’s ideal campaign strategy at this point should just be to stay locked in his home, have other people make ads for him, and then just stick a pre-recorded “My name is Joe Biden and I approve this message” at the end.
I hope this flies. What I like here, The commision on debates says no to Trump wanting to debate Biden a fourth time, Biden has only agreed to three. AP via
The choice is Biden or four more years of Trump. Really, is there a question there?
Man, Biden ain’t losing his mind. I’m actually disappointed in the ageism going on. You drag Ruth Ginsberg on a campaign tour, where her daily schedule is always changing, she’s gonna exhaust too. But let her sit down and do her job - she’s good.
I hope this flies. What i like here, I wouldn't beeleive this video at all about Biden, it seems deceptivly edited. AP via
LOCK HIM UP...claiming he loves Jesus &amp; Biden is Anti-God!!   WTF??
“I want to vote for Biden. It will come down to how many of you click on my clickbait because I am gross.”
Joe Biden is a decent man. Its Biden regardless of anything he says or anyone he picks for VP
I'm voting for Biden no matter who is the VP. I don't understand the drama. The same thing happened to Hilary and look what we got. People stop with the pick, pick, pick
My vote for Biden is in stone. He’s got my vote even if his Vp was the horses ass, a horses ass is better than trump
FFS.  Yeah, y’all will pressure Biden to do what you want, AFTER you cede your vote (power) to him.  Real smart, 🤡.
Well Joe Biden is openly racist you really can't shield that!
Who had on their 2020 BINGO Card: Trying to convince Bernie Bros to vote for Biden would be harder than convincing the KKK and Neo-Nazis? Wow... Just wow! #ByeDon2020 #FeelTheBern
And tbh I think if any race is going to vote for Kanye (esp among young voters) it’s going to be white voters who are very far left &amp; still actively attack Biden because they have the privilege of being able to survive 4 more yrs. BIPOC don’t have that privilege, and we know it.
Seems unwise to draw an equivalence between Biden's decline and Trump's; Joe gaffes sometimes but he acquitted himself reasonably well in the debates. Trump couldn't read a chart deeply enough to explain what the statistics actually showed, which took Swan a fraction of a second.
I think the conversation about why Kanye’s run is problematic is being framed entirely incorrectly. We need to worry about how it will affect the younger voters, not black voters. Biden wasn’t winning youngest voting block in primary, I fear they will vote Kanye as “protest”.
Biden is the most direct anti-Trump vote. If my vote goes to opposing Trump, not voting and voting 3rd party are worth less than that in ensuring Trump's loss.  I can't imagine a good future where Trump gets a second term. It's naive accelerationism to think we'd bounce back.
cuz that girl hates Trump so she will vote for Biden !!! its like a trend with these young know it all kids these days.and sadly they are the ones that going to suffer the most if Trump looses
Well, we all know that HRC is overqualified for any of them. And even if she had done the SoS job before I don’t think she would refuse if Biden were to offer her the job + she could really help restore our country’s image around the globe.
Biden is on some Ron burgundy shit
If Bernie or someone like Nina Turner was the nom. Absolutely. I'm gonna leave my ballot blank, down ballot and all, and then throw it in the dumpster because Joe Biden is our nominee and the entire establishment fought to stop people from getting healthcare and an education.
Biden scraps plans to travel to Milwaukee for nomination acceptance, citing coronavirus concerns
That did severely impact the black community without doing further damage through mass incarceration.  But ultimately they didn’t have support from people like Biden and were forced to take the “lesser evil” bill of Biden’s to avoid a potentially worse one from republicans /2
Uh, no. That would be Hillary &amp; the DNC.   The entire Russian collusion began in 2016 with the #Democrats   Look it up. HIllary &amp; DNC. Fusion GPS. Steele Dossier.  Mueller Rpt. All BS. And it backfired.  No to #Democrats No to #Biden
... so Biden’s strategy should focus more on Trump’s bad actions, not not his speaking gaffes. You showed a video of Trump saying “I invite Jews, Muslims, &amp; Christians to join us in a quest for lasting peace &amp; God bless us all”. What’s wrong with that?
It warms my heart that I know relatively unengaged, uninformed independent voters who hate Trump that will never vote for Joe Biden for being a creeper. Good job Dems!
Biden apologized to African Americans and white folks all under the post pattin him up and forgiving him. THATS NOT YOUR FUCKING PLACE. Now lil redbox done blocked me.
I’m a big fan of your show but wasn’t a fan of your opening tonight in talking w/  You focused on Trump’s mocking Biden’s mental acuity &amp; gave many examples of Trump’s spoken gaffes. Biden doesn’t need to play the I’m smarter game. We already know that.
Team Trump is losing this race. Biden doesn’t have to do anything and can say whatever racist comes to his cobwebbed mind. Team Trump needs a shot of adrenaline and fast!
Expose and Biden in the same sentence is creepy.
it's another episode of "biden is raysus!" brought to you by the same people that say black lives don't matter.
Also, Obama and Biden became close personal friends over 8 years and still are now.
you already legitimized their opinion by chasing out bernie sanders because he “wouldn’t get the swing voters” like biden. so its your fault. your decision and now you have to live with it. too bad, because i’d have voted for sanders but i won’t vote for joe.
I truly dislike that almost every republican assumes that all democrats love Biden. We do not.
You could literally play a legit game of “who said it: Trump or Biden?”
I think you should put the bottle down,  you've had enough to drink.  That last tweet looked like Joe Biden tweeted it for you.
Biden will really gonna convince hundreds of thousands of dumb 18 year olds to vote if one of his campaign promises is to unban TikTok
Trump is so much better for God..   BBC News - US election 2020: Trump says opponent Biden will 'hurt God'
Furthermore, in 4 years Biden can either choose to run again if he's healthy, or choose to sit out the primary if he isn't. Obama did it this time, and all he has to do is invoke the Obama precedent and no one will question is and if Kamala complains it will definitely backfire.
Biden was not in office until 1973. He was hand picked VP for 8 years to the only Black president. All major civil rights leaders endorse him.
I wanna expand on this for a second. Kamala isn't the nominee because she sucked in the debates and she sucked at campaigning. Being Biden's Selena Meyer for 4 years (He doesn't like her and won't keep her close, and she can't complain publicly about it) won't change that.
I think that a year from now in a Biden administration the world will still be worse off than it is today. It will be MUCH better off than if Trump is re-elected but still, the decline of everything feels inexorable in the short term. Things will get worse before they get better.
Barry’s picking the ticket. Waiting to C if Biden can make it. If not, he’ll choose a 2 B/F tic. He’ll then have the right pair to continue his 16 yr plan.  Hillary screwed him by losing. Michael &amp; Rice?  Trump has 2 win this election, if not, America as we know it is finished!
"Tell us how you really feel Joe Biden!" says
Damn bro didn't know joe Biden has been president beforeChina is trying to get Biden elected, so thats the counter punch
Since (arguably) Joe Biden lacks quantity of voter enthusiasm in comparison to his rival, would  bring that enthusiasm out?   #BidenHarris2020
No true Catholic should be voting for Biden. Its that simple.
I would rather work with China as well, Biden needs to be elected
If Biden wins, it will be a nightmare that all of us get to enjoy!
Surpriiiize!! Surprize!!! (Gomer Pyle 😊) Russia trying to undermine Biden in election, White House intelligence report says
Help us elect Matt and Joe Biden by phone banking with the campaign! Will you join us?
First of all none of those girls and women look uncomfortable so you failed on that one and two Biden is respectful to women. Get your fucking facts straight MAGAT
What’s interesting to me is that republicans will bash Biden for the crime bill and why it was so bad for America, but believe that this ruling is justified. It really makes no sense. This man should be free.
All I can say is that yesterday BOTH Trump and Biden made fools of themselves. These upcoming debates are gonna be shit show.
I’m a Democrat.  Biden was not my first choice for a variety of reasons.  But when it’s Biden versus the demented sociopathic racist xenophobic grifting money laundering mobbed up treasonweasel ? No contest.
2/2...how would it, in any way, help her achieve the presidency by not trying to make the Biden administration super successful?
Trump really trying to make Biden seem cool to me
What, and get sucked into a conversation about Hunter Biden? Or, Uranium One? Or some other nonsense? No, thank you.
👍 OR 😡 Should there be more presidential debates, and should they be held earlier? What do you think?
Coronavirus doesn't have press conferences. The virus is not a political issue.  Donald Trump has felt that the virus is political. Because of this, science never played a roll in decision making.   And never will. That's why we need Joe Biden president. Otherwise 👇 makes sense.
I believe we would have still lost lives, but I also believe he wouldn’t have ignored the scientists and politicized a mask. I think we’d most likely have a rrsting plan and well any plan other than ‘wishing it away’.
#ThursdayThought  and  are what we get when  quit,the  sold their soul to the president and the  had their people back down for Biden. My children have learned about how lowsy both parties are and how rigged we are. #ThanksObama

Commission rejects President Trump's push to add debate against Biden
The NY AG isn’t part of the Biden Campaign though, they’re just doing their job and busting an allegedly fraudulent non-profit. Though I agree the political ramifications for the election are a bit unfortunate.
Trump claims Biden is 'against God' and will 'hurt the Bible'
Damn. I am definitely voting for Biden now. He’s more powerful than God!
God cant be murdered and Biden is a devout Christian
Today Trump said Biden could “hurt God”  is this true?   If so, my favorite worship song “Awesome God” is a lie.
Sleepy Joe Biden is sacrificing the votes of one minority to another minority why can’t people simply see-through his racist comments?!
Why the hell is Juan Williams on the Five? This idiot needs to hangout with Biden!!
Since she endorsed him, who has been more committed to Biden's run than Kamala?
I REALLY want Kamala Harris and I think Biden would be a fool not to choose her. That said, no way I'd risk the damage another 4 years of Trump would do to this country by sitting out or voting 3rd party because he didn't choose the person I wanted.
No doubt a project of the Biden administration.
Trump forgot which state Biden was supposed to have forgotten he was in.
Biden owes you NOTHING you orange YAMTITS oh and you can kiss Christian voters goodbye because I just got a hold of this and its going all over Twitter
Did Trump just start a war against Biden and Catholicism?   Going to be nice to see Muslims and Christians become united against Trump as he continues to use religion as nothing more than a political tools. #VoteBlueNoMatterWho #ResistersUnitedVote
Trump is desperate, just throwing out any negative garbage. Next month he will claim Biden was sent by the Martians.
Biden should just stay quiet for 88 more days.... this is like watching a fish on the deck

Biden called for jailing white supremacist. Does he include Trump in that? Love this bold strategy. #Biden2020
Have a seriously hard time believing the IA poll. Tho margin of error is 3.5%--which means that Iowa could be a statistical tie.  Unless there's some major sea change, Biden will handily win MI and MN. WI also seems very probable, as does PA, in which case Biden becomes prez.
Biden can’t even pronounce the word testament.
He's comin' out of hiding and dropping the American people one of his patented Biden Gaff's This election is going to be a shit show on all sides.
Biden still clinging to 50% nationally and remains ahead in key swing states. But don't get complacent.
Joe Biden, will travel to China, drop his pants and bend over, he’ll even dispense the KY Jelly.
If Biden is so confident in beating you in the debates, he should be excited to move up one of the debates.
OK - So Hunter and Joe Biden traveled to China, and slipped a bioweapon into their carry-ons? Brought it back to United States and released it in Washington state?  You know of course that most *respected* virologists dismiss the bioweapon/lab theory.
Don't care when or if debates are held. I will vote Biden and Dems all the way. Without a job, Repubs will have time to remember who they work for. Sure hope they won't need to apply for unemployment to survive
Agree.  Biden &amp; the entire administration will be very busy reversing trump's disaster's which includes our world reputation.
It’s hilarious that you think racism, inappropriate behavior, plagiarism, and nepotism are somehow charges that will stick to Biden. There’s not a single thing of which you can accuse him which Trump hasn’t *provably* done in spades. 😂😂😂
Definitely entering a different stage of election year. I have seen two different new ads from the Biden campaign in the last 1/2 hour. Both positive ads which is refreshing. #necivgov
I think you’ve mistaken Biden for Trump, who can’t stand up straight, walk down a ramp, or lift a glass of water - not to mention when his brain short circuits and he can’t pronounce words. It’s sad the GOP is doing this to an obese old man who is clearly ill.
If I had a chance of proposing or signing legislation which might affect them I would.  But you’re a hypocrite if you don’t think Trump did, because I’m sure you’d lose your mind if Biden didn’t.
When Trump loses and people complain about Biden or his policies just reply with "It is what it is".  #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #RidinWithBiden #VoteHimOut
We all know that people like her will embrace the racist rhetoric that their president encourages.  Once Biden wins they will slink back into their holes because ignorance won't be tolerated. 'Karens' won't be free to spout hate without swift consequence. Thank you for trying ❤
Biden afraid? You mean, IN THE LEAD! Trump only one afraid. Afraid to release tax returns. Lol!! Maybe a color bar graph would help!! LOL!!! #MoronInChief
The American Postal Workers Union endorsed Biden, that has nothing to do with the postmaster general.
What do you think?
Biden actually cares for people and doesnt think about himself. Tom we have had over 161,000 Americans die from the coronavirus and Trump has done nothing about it. You can rebuild the economy but you cant rebuild people's lives.
Not that Biden is much better but educate yourselves
I guess I was right about Kayne West running for pres to siphon African American voters from Biden. A Republican lawyer and his cohorts have started to gather signatures to put Kayne West on the ballot. Will Democratic voters stay with Biden or shift to West?
Biden confidants reportedly see VP list narrowed down to 2 | Fox News -
He will use any chart that shows him 'winning' I fear his briefings only give him positive spins so he doesnt get angry. His only words to 156000+ dying is to say 'it is what it is'. We are in more danger due to his ego. VOTE BIDEN to protect more lives and empathy to our dead

you gonna mess with Biden huh, well here is Cruella De Trump for you and Pence as her dog
Biden is a right winger you idiot.
Still: Trump currently has a 12% chance of winning the EC. That's not zero, people. Don't get complacent.   Convince your Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Florida, and North Carolina relatives and friends to vote for Biden.
No matter how we end up having to vote, Joe Biden will be out next President.
Robin Williams doing Joe Biden. I wish he was still around to roast him these days!
Keep Joe Biden off the air as much as possible. We are stuck with him (thanks dirty corporate Dems🖕🏾) it's the very least the campaign can do for this country. The very least.
Biden says he will not travel to Milwaukee to accept the democratic nomination. What does than mean? The old switcheroo?

Sounds good.  He is the only choice. America is collapsing. Biden has my vote.
If Trump were trailing in Iowa that would be earth-shattering. Most recent Monmouth per  has Biden and Trump in a dead-even tie in Iowa (47-47).
I'll be on board if Biden nominates a stapler.
Fuck yeah. It’s time to hit back and it back hard. We have two choices, and Biden is best for America  🇺🇸
Shame on you  for following the Trump fear mongering playbook saying Joe Biden is being swept up by the radical left just now on WITF. You know better.
That fact that the Trump administration is continously attempting to paint Joe Biden's mental acuity as "defective" using Donald Trump as their reference point is a slap in the face to alzheimer's patients everywhere.
While I wish he were out there more, what Biden’s doing is clearly working. From their perspective, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.
Btw, y'all are gonna lose whether or not Biden takes the stage.  Gnaw on that for a while.
Trump sucks. Biden sucks. I love being a teenager and growing up in a country of people who vote for men like them. Neither of them is apt to be president. They’re both delusional. Can this nightmare just be over already??? Fuck.  #fucktrump #fuckbiden #fuckvotingblue

Trump writes Biden’s effective debate rebuttals.
I agree Dr Biden would be a great First Lady. What is it Melania is doing???
Every day he gives Biden ammo for the debates. This included. Love it!
Yes! The Republicans are killing people right now and Biden wants to protect and expand the Affordable Care Act, while continuing to protect the rights of the LGBT Community and has extremely liberal energy and environmental justice plans! The two parties are exactly the same!!
Biden has a long history of holding his own and even excelling in one-on-one debates. Including, most recently, with Bernie Sanders. If covid is the overbearing topic (and it should be), Trump is toast.
Thing is, I do not think Biden has a problem at all. Trump is clearly an imbecile, though.
Maybe daddy ought to take a que from Biden. Every time your daddy opens his mouth it shows how in competent he is
Well, if Biden wins, Obama will be president again.
Biden understands that "events" are a major source od the spread of SARS-COV-2 unlike your #COVIDIOT45 who needs his fans to cheer him loudly even if it kills them. Remember Herman Cain. #TulsaTrumpRally #TrumpRallyFail So keep on holding your events, ya'll.

YEAH LEAVE THE USA I DONT GIVE A FUCK ANYMORE, THE SOONER YOU LEAVE THE SOONER BIDEN TAKES OFFICE!!!!! #GoAwayTrump #WeDontWantYouHere #FlytheCoop
In 2016 Trump could attack all the time because he had no record.  Now he has a record that Biden can attack him on.  Biden needs to have some good come backs for all the lies that Trump will be spewing.    In the end,I'd be surprised if Trump shows up.  Biden is better on policy
So much said about an October surprise to bring Biden down but I'm hoping for an October surprise to absolutely drown trump. Trump Org investigation, Tiffany Doe vs trump, whistle blower re: Russia.  Whatever, let it happen!
Also it’s not just the signs. I don’t see as much movement in opinions as polls/pundits are indicating. I’m skeptical. Of the few people I know that are not voting for Trump who did in 2016 - they are not moving to Biden.
Duh... do we even know if Biden is still kicking?
Is it?   Just saying I have personally only seen two Biden signs but a plethora of Trump flags and signs. Friends have seen some for Biden but it’s still not in any large numbers. #necivgov
Seriously, what's all the hand wringing about Biden announcing his VP nom? It's just August 3rd, not September 3rd.
Biden’s delay in choosing a running mate intensifies jockeying between potential picks -
Hubby and I spent our weekend riding motorcycle across Pa and Md. Counted 3 Biden signs in Pa and two in Md. LOTS of American flags and Trump signs everywhere!  Don't buy the lie that Trump is losing....he will win in 2020!
Saw a huge sign in a dem yard with a tiny Biden sign...the huge sign said,  "Vote Blue No Matter Who." Dems know Biden wont be their nominee. #DemsAreDestroyingAmerica
Still waiting on those 1000s of pictures you promised showing Biden in compromising pictures w/women - doing things “worse than” what the 25 accusers of Trump have attested to...
“”This entire election season is something a democracy expert would worry about.””  It is. And we are. And so should every American.
I live in Lancaster county, and while there are Trump signs here, there are not nearly as many as there were four years ago.  And I see a lot of Biden signs.   Yard signs are purely anecdotal, though.  Polls are more accurate than counting signs.
An even bigger problem is there is little chance Biden makes it 8 years. I don’t just don’t see any of the women on that list as Presidential, or our next President following Biden. Obviously any of them are better than trump, but that’s not saying much.
Who is Biden’s VP Pick? #JoeBiden2020 #vp
Even blood red Nebraska winking at Joe Biden...
We know Joe! You do know that your name is Joe Biden, correct?
I’d vote for Biden if he selected Herman Cain as VP.
Again, the date of the announcement is irrelevant. The fact that Biden has been silent regarding the continued misogyny toward these women is the issue. He doesn't have to reveal his VP to make a statement against this dragging.
A Trump presidency has proven to be disastrous. We will never be "normal" under Trump's leadership. We must vote for Biden in November.
But Joe Biden is too cozy with China?
Did you come back for some more humiliation? We know  Biden's not off golfing somewhere on our dime.
I dont agree with this at all, DO YOU WANT TO GET OUT OF THE CORONAVIRUS MESS?!?!?! BIDEN IS THE ONLY MAN WITH THE RIGHT MIND TO GET US OUT OF THIS MESS
For  all of you who believe the lies about Biden, shame on you. Thats all the accusations against him are, LIES to divide people and I know Trumpers are all behind this. #Biden2020Landslide #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #BlueWave2020
#Resisters lets get Biden #1 on this poll. Retweet the hell outta this
give up the election to Biden
There is very little that could happen that would lead to me not voting for Biden
Let’s face the facts... Biden is nothing more than a place holder. He’s a crusty old lifelong politician that stayed in the game to make corrupt deals for his personal gain. He’d sell out America for the first deal he can make.
Source? Please share. His economy plan seems pretty good. Also, if Trump’s claim is true and it’s a copy of his plan why would there be less under Biden but not Trump?
As creepy as Biden.
Will do.  Vote Biden!
Naw that what you’d do.....you can’t remember anything you say, can’t remember who your running against or what ya running for....remember this “I’m going to beat Joe Biden” yea YOU SAID THAT!! Your incompetent and worse choice ever!! Trump will beat you!
Bitch I can do this all day because your not changing how I view Trump. I am against him times infinity, so if you wanna be an idiot and vote for him be my guest. I want change and I want this coronavirus under control so I will vote Biden no matter what.
If you wanna make Biden so bad well here is a thing for you MAGATS!!! BIDEN ISNT A #BunkerBitch and doesnt put up a wall around the white house. Your attraction to Trump shows your thirst for power and control, thats what all Trump supporters want.
Let's put it this way:  It would be sad to see Biden try to have a battle of wits with an unarmed man.
I dot care who is Biden’s Veep I’m voting for Trump.
Thank you very much.  When Biden wins I need to figure out how to put a smile on his face. LOL
I had someone arguing with me how bad Biden is.  I told them I am a one issue voter, vote out Trump.   Biden is creepy. I don't care.  Biden is too old. I don't care.  Biden has been in DC too long.  I don't care.  They get angry when you tell them your only issue is "Not Trump"
Has there ever been a presidential candidate as invisible as Biden this close to an election? The only opinions I consistently see are pro vs anti-trump. Nothing that is pro vs anti-Biden. As a marketer, current political election strategy is so fascinating.
If the Biden campaign is smart (and I think it is), it won't be Bottoms, and it won't be Rice.
Please Zeus, do not let President Biden let it go and move on to “heal” the country. We need a commission! I will be “healed” when I see members of the Crime Family in prison!
Many times Trump mentioned in the Epstein documents, and way more docs to be released. One thing certain, no mention of Biden. But Trump and his associates were closely connected to Epstein. Sad. Bigly.
Choosing Nina Turner as VP would be the wisest decision Biden could make. And because it is wise, we know it won't happen.
Hey joe Biden stop fucking around and select  as next on line.
Short of endorsing Biden it's #toolittetoolate
I feel like political ads for instance are like...soooo slanderous in their own nature. Why do I keep seeing these YouTube ads of clearly chopped up audio of Biden saying “Yes, absolutely yes” about defunding the police and some little kid saying “mommy I’m scared”
Im so glad we have Biden. Can't The wait for the debates. Biden will definately overwhelm Trump with his quick wit and his command of the facts.
No one should have to call him out. It's appalling that Biden hasn't put a stop to it and there's nothing wrong with expecting our candidate to step up against misogyny. I don't think anyone has campaigned harder for Joe than Kamala. She deserves better from him.
Ed Rendell's take on Biden's VP choice is about as useful and relevant as Rick Santorum's take on the same.
I saw a Biden ad on MSNBC last night and in a brief second they show Biden jogging down a ramp.  I literally LOL'ed.  So subtle but effective.
AP FACT CHECK: Trump wholly distorts Biden on immigration  #diasporalaw #immigration #inmigracion #immigrationreform #immigrationlawyer #immigrationattorney #immigrationservices #immigrationstories #immigrationrights #latism #uslatino
“We’ll be back on the air shortly, even more forcefully exposing Joe Biden as a puppet of the radical left wing.”  This is a campaign strategy that has already gone over like a lead balloon.
Hey, he's the one that will be running this country if Biden wins.   #ObamaGateIsReal
Thats a good question. Maybe team Biden couldn't prep his lookalike in time? Or maybe they didn't want him to have to answer any questions?  #WheresHunter
The questions now  is what we will do once Trumpism is rejected in the Tsunami that will hit the GOP in November.  How will we use the four years of a Biden Presidency to rebuild our party into something better?  We’ve lost our way.   We let the ugliest among  us,  define  us.
I guess one of the big questions is after Trumpism is rejected in a humiliating Tsunami in November, how will we use the next four years of a Biden Presidency to rebuild the GOP back into something Abe Lincoln would be proud of?  We let the ugly among us define us.  What now?
Yes we are gonna wing BIG!! What are u gonna be doing when Biden takes over?
Hillary was awful at getting the people on the fence to vote for her.  I'm not saying Biden is good, but Trump is awful too.
Had a Trumper try to convince me not to voter for Biden.  Told him I was a 1 issue voter, I want Trump out of office.  Biden too old? Don't care.  Biden sniffs girls hair? Don't care. Biden son and Burisma? Don't care.  They really get frustrated when you tell them you don't care
I do not like Biden... I will vote for him as a default, but I just hate Trump. Your typical democrat insults don’t work on me... I don’t care...in fact you got nothing so you are making this is fun..enjoy the knowledge I am dropping on you. You argued with the wrong Republican..
Regan’s ghost hates trump too..no respect from my Republican Party?!!! I heard Bush is gonna vote Biden too... beautiful thing.. not because I like Biden, but because I hate a trump
Joe Biden says Trump's failure to lead is responsible for historic economic slump
JOHN SOLOMON’S BOOK DIGS DEEP INTO OBAMA INTEL   Obama &amp; Biden played &amp; seen as FOOLS
Under Obama and Biden, the immune system was a complete disaster.  We built the strongest immune system in history. But I don't get credit.  Must be my personality.
He knows that when Joe Biden takes office, one of the first agenda items will be to investigate the last 4 years of the Trump presidency, his family, his associates... everything.  For all that we know now, just wait until we discover what we don't.
All Democrats, including Biden, are against the murder of trump supporters. There isn’t a need for murder since they will take care of it themselves.
I find it funny in these trump commercials of “Joe Biden’s America” that they’re showing literal footage of Trumps America...
Wonder if Biden will just ask Obama to be his VP
DEFINITELY! Watching the F&amp;M polls this morning, 50% of people said if the election was today, they’d vote for Biden. Only 41% Trump and the rest undecided or neither. 🤞🏻
I just don’t understand how they can be so stupid? “This will be Biden’s America.” K well it is the current America which is under trump sooo 🤔🤨
When trump’s ads show videos of chaos and says that this will be Biden’s America...do you morons not realize that that is trump’s current America? 🤨
Spanky is going out of his way to make sure that Putin gets whatever he wants. Biden should have him thoroughly investigated when he wins the election in November.
Joshua: A strange game. The only winning move is not to play.
It is so obvious that Biden is just a pawn! WAKE UP AMERICA!
They should be. She'd be a disaster.US officials: Russia denigrating Biden ahead of election
Joe Biden: Everything you need to know about the 2020 presidential candidate - ABC News  Great summary of a Joe Biden’s accomplishments and negatives. I don’t like everything about him, but then I don’t agree with ANY politician 100% of the time.
I don't give a wailing coyote what other counties think. I'm voting for Joe Biden and truly believe that whatever comes of his presidency can only be good for this country. We have had enough of authoritarian rule and drool.
No, but I would certainly give it my best shot to vote Biden in. There's no more room in my head for Trump. He has already been there, rent free, for far too long.
How is this possible. Trump is a psychotic fuck job. And hes catching Biden. Fox News: 2020 polls tighten: Trump narrows gap with Biden as campaign chief credits coronavirus briefings.   via
The Associated Press: US officials: Russia denigrating Biden ahead of election.   via
I think good Republicans still exist in this world and that all of them will vote for Biden. They are the elephants running out in the creek. That is an amazing video.
These "speculations" border on negligent journalism. Both Russia and China have their preferences, sure, but this is an obvious 'hit' piece against Biden and his son 'Hunter,' 'planted' unknowingly by US Intelligence. China cares about thing, American political disorder.
Oh pleeease. Joe Biden didn’t write this. His handlers are racing around putting out Joe’s fires.
#BREAKING: US intelligence warns about election interference by China, Russia, Iran and says Russia is using a range of measures to denigrate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.
Phony Biden is an insult to all of humanity
Great historical look-back at VP picks and outcomes. Will it be a balancing act, successor, or a vote grabber?
Liberalism is a lie, built on accusing others of exactly what they are. Joe Biden said blacks are not black unless they vote for him, Biden just said blacks have no diversity of thought or culture. The guy is a racist, speaks racism, and he’s YOUR guy!
All of the women mentioned as VP contenders are well qualified, intelligent and sane. None are rapists, bigots or narcissistic. I’ll fully support whoever Joe Biden chooses.
So besides the declining mental health I hope anyone else who is contemplating voting Biden is also okay with massive tax hikes. Just one more reason I am giving my vote to one of the most patriotic presidents ever. #Trump2020
FWIW, Donald Trump is correct that what Joe Biden said was hurtful. However, Donald Trump does not in any way give a shit about it other than placing himself on the good side.
If you're racing to the bottom,  you're winning with Biden. What was that fake "go low, go high" drivel. Stay to your principles libs .. CANCEL Biden, he's clearly racist. Biden = KKK, just 50yrs later! Ain't nothing Trump's done, ALL Joe, 30330
Hey  one of your “influencers” is doubling down on Joe Biden’s racist comments. I just wanted to make your incredibly diverse organization aware of it. I hope you think twice before interacting with people who believe all “black” people come from the same place.
He never apologized. Racists don’t apologize for saying racist stuff. Joe Biden is a sick man.
Biden says a lot of racist stuff. Biden has a very racist past. If trump ever said half the racist stuff Biden did then he would actually be a racist, like Joe Biden is.
This is trumps fault? You TDS sufferers live in a strange world. Joe Biden said more racist stuff yesterday, which seems to be the only thing he says that is comprehensible, then there is the other stuff...  yet you are still voting for him. What does that say about you?
Could joe Biden even give a state of the Union??!
That's because Biden/Democrats aren't running against DJT, they are running against the fundamental principles of America. The media doesn't cover it. So he has to.
Joe Biden can’t do an interview without a racist comment -
There is no way one could make some of this shit up. Biden’s remark re: Latinos and African Americans. And of course the protesters are suing because they want to have excellent protective gear so they can protest peacefully. We could keep going
Playing electoral defense, Trump claims Biden opposes God
needs to be in a Biden Administration!  She has the integrity and the experience to do a great job at DOJ.
You are voting for Biden. Who is hiding in his basement. And when he does speak he either says crazy racist things or things that are nonsense. What does this say about you?
Biden campaign responds to Trump's 'hurt God' attack: 'Biden's faith is at the core of who he is'
If y'all wanna say Joe Biden is racist that's fine but include "and Trump" in that sentence and change that is to an are...we wouldn't want your grammar failing you on here now would we
He gets more bizarre as each day passes. Biden is none of what Trump says, and Trump is none of what he claims himself to be.
No! I will vote by Absentee ballot to vote him out! Think COVID-19. I just hope when I return to the Republican Party that we still have a reason to exist because Biden is really going to fuck up our country. I will be really sad to see freedom die for good. 😔😔😔
So you're going to vote for trump if you don't like Biden's vp pick. Got it
LOL BOF III was the truth all along and Biden is a secret dragon
This is a real Issue for both sides, I'm glad to see it elevated RN. I've talked about this before as Foreign Interference becomes, once again, a major concern in a bipolar World. Bureaucrats will need more scrutiny Across the Board.
Unemployed Americans for Biden vote out the bums
Biden served with the first black president trump gassed black voters at BLM protests
Wrong all black voters support Biden
A Trump ad doctored photos of Biden to make him seem alone
Kanye West needs care and attention for the obvious mental struggles he is facing.  The GOP is using him as a tool to siphon black votes from Biden.  Not only are they abusing a person with a mental illness, they also show racial prejudice in their assumptions of black voters.
Trump will roast Biden. It’s in his blood lol
The only thing that would give me pause about voting for Joe Biden is if he named you as VP. Grifter.
Here I agree put in Bernie Trump admitted he feared running against Bernie more than Joe Biden. Trump was relieved that he was facing Joe Biden instead. So the D.N.C. played into his hands.
Biden has a laundry list of bad choices in Washington. His racist comments and his voting record alone hang him. To debate with Trump would be an act of political Suicide.
Thats not good. #DNC wake up.. #Democrats #Biden too many people wont vote for Biden. And that's bad. We need another more effective candidate maybe Bernie Sanders
My fears are coming True. Too many people are saying they don't want to #Vote for Trump. But will because they refuse to vote for #Biden this to me is very very bad. We have to remove Trump. I dont care who does it. He has to be voted out. We need a new candidate.
Well,  she is running for president.  And she doesn't get millions from the government like Trump and Biden.
Biden has no black vote.
Like I said before. You're only gonna get black demo that normally don't vote and Republicans that can't stomach Trump anymore. I truly believe you're helping Biden. And that's great
Virginia mayor urged to resign after allegedly saying Joe Biden picked 'Aunt Jemima' as his VP
It’s not my fault the Democratic Party put its full throated support behind this old white guy...they had 30 options and pushed this guy down our throats...So now math needs to be done...Biden has to court old white people, men, Reagan Democrats, and some minorities. (1/2)
Nothing  more AMERICAN than Baseball, Chevrolet and Joe Biden 🇺🇸
The only reason dead beat Biden is leading is due to the fact his competitor is worse. Biden is still just a do nothing leader.. Sad
Trump will eat Biden alive sorry to say his voting record on Capitol Hill will come back to haunt him as will his racist comments. It will all come down to how much hatred of Trump there is to vote in Biden and look the other way. Many blacks cannot and are going to Trump.
Republican operatives are currently trying to submit signatures for Kanye (a person who needs medical help for mental health issues) so he can run for president and hurt Biden.  That is called influencing the election, something Trump is so "adamant" shouldn't happen   BS
Joe Biden won't travel to Milwaukee to accept Democratic nomination
Joe Biden is a devout Catholic. And what the hell does the Catholic Church care about the second amendment? If anything, they’re for gun control.
Joe Biden is Catholic.
There is absolutely nothing Biden could say that comes close to the stupidity that comes from the mouth of trump.
It’s official....Biden has lost his marbles.
I also broke the Republican rules I donated to Joe Biden's Campaign and I don't even like the guy. But anything is better than Trump. I am terrified to be an American Citizen today.
Health officials in Wisconsin have informed the Democratic National Convention Committee that speakers for the 2020 Democratic convention should no longer travel to Milwaukee due to the coronavirus.
All eyes are on Erie County for 2020. It’s not easy campaigning during a pandemic.  Here is what I had to say to the Washington Post while they were in Erie last week →
As always throw those Zogby polls in the trash.  Sure, they're good for Biden, but there's no way Jorgensen is getting 4% or Hawkins 2%.
You are missing the point. I want Biden too. If Trump thinks he can tie his loss up in the courts he will be quite surprised when Pelosi becomes president while the courts decide.
Hannity: Democrats worried Biden is too feeble to take on Trump  via  this is more worrisome than laughable at times. This man should not be allowed to be president
Omg I'm dying right now   SO..  I saw a single tweet without this context AT ALL and was assuming it was about Biden but also just had to many similar convos too quickly on too little sleep
POLITICO: 'Never Trump' Republicans team with progressives to convert the president's religious base.   via
You honestly believe this? Biden is the poster child for term limits and big government, he's useless and corrupt, his kids are corrupt oh and he's a creepy pedophile and general creepy old man and participated in the scandals under Obama.
Hmmm 51% approval rating currenty? Yea Biden isn't right for the job he's going to ruin the economy by regulating it to death, bankrupt normal Americans with his universal health care scheme, and oh yea His corrupt kids and all the scandals he participated in under Obama
Should I or Should I not make a donation to Joe Biden's Campaign?
Kinda like Joe Biden? You could say that about Joe any time of the day.
I honestly believe IF Joe Biden is elected he will "step down" soon after innagarattion and his running mate,  whoever that is will be president and AOC or one of those other wackos will be vp.... God help us
Leftists will see this tweet and be like: "Is he saying he's gonna remove term limits and rule eternally????"  yeah that's crazy and all but I don't see you complaining about people like Nancy Pelosi or Joe Biden who have been in office for half of their lives
Hey Dems I'll vote for Biden but you gotta promise me you keep RBG's seat empty so Amy Coney Barret can be appointed in 4-8 years.   Deal?
You should be more worried about the Ukraine connection to this blast Mr Biden
This is a sneak peak into the debates. Yes, Biden is going to almost choke away an upper hand by speaking, but kickback from others is always welcomed.
Is this a Biden endorsement?
The pathway to Biden’s victory and winning Pennsylvania is right through #PA16.
Will he remember the codes for the Arsenal?? Serious question. Cc: Biden.
Elect Joe Biden for President 🇺🇸❣️
They'd better not interview her. Hold out for Biden. People need to see the real Biden.
If I get credit for my Biden/Trump prediction in 2015 I posted earlier this week, gotta give props to you again too.
And the next day the virus is gone. (Only if Biden wins)
No doubt one thing I want to get clear bro is that when I criticize him I’m not saying “I love Biden”. But man trump needs to stop talking😂
Another poll with Biden ahead in Texas 🤠
Right on, John. A good blunt piece. Who would ever think of debating Adolph Hitler? Never in a million years does Joe Biden need a debate. Tell Trump to buzz off and yell in a closet.
Just because a mf doesn’t like Trump doesn’t mean they like Biden either.
This thread is legendary... #ElizabethWarren #VP #Biden
Maybe he's just very confident in Biden lol #wishfulthinking
Ouch. I attack his ego on most of tweets. And I attack his policy over simple mistakes everyone makes. I hate him as much as you do I promise, but criticizing him for mistakes Biden is likely to also make hurts the cause. Focus on his tyranny and blatant stupidity, not typos.
I see an occasional Biden sign or bumper sticker. There's still some knee jerk democrats left in my area.
I’m attending Joe Biden for President’s event, “Irish Americans for Biden Virtual Rally” – sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
Fairview Township residents search Facebook for “Fairview for Biden” to join the movement to turn a red town blue!
Yes, but the white males are already in the polls with knowledge that Biden plans to choose a woman. They may not change too much. I say, give Trump more time, and he'll really mess up. We had an emergency team and he disbanded it. Now he's against the one we do have. Stable?
The irony isn’t lost on me, I just don’t care. I know that my not caring is ironic in itself, yeah.  Being given several good choices in the primary and still going with Joe fucking Biden gives me a pretty clear picture at least of the Democrats in this country. The rest, well...
Mooooo-ve over #GOP, here comes Biden. Nice cows!
Yep. Been saying this for a long time. Wheel Biden through the election. If he wins, shortly thereafter he steps down due to health. VP becomes POTUS. Their plan continues. Can't let them do this
I'm thinking Biden +7 is the right number
My favorite thing to happen in weeks is in listening to Mike Kelly's tele-townhall and hearing someone ask about Democrats "fixing the election" because he sees so many Joe Biden yard signs😂😂😂
Ahhhh In Facebook jail yet again for speaking out against #America And #Trump. Both are pretty fucking pathetic right now. Look Im A #Sanders Supporter We dont exactly kiss ass. We Kick it when it needs it. Looking like Ill be forced to vote #Biden Not thrilled
Elections cannot be Delayed. The Administration stating this Months ago, off-handedly on a TV Appearance, was a major Blunder &amp; forced Potus to "bait" opposition Against what many took to be a genuine statement on Strategy. Another Campaign Blunder.
Nah. I’ve been saying since last fall. They’re gonna pull Biden last minute and it’ll be Hillary/Michelle.
The pick should be running for President not Biden. He's as racist as they come. He chooses a woman of color he is just using her to gain his own ends. Yet most are blind to this reality
FACT.  No one will be voting Biden, they be voting for his running mate.
My  signs are getting noticed in #EriePA - thanks  We need more &amp; we need to have courage to stake them in our front yards without fear of #MAGA enthusiasts taking it as an invitation to fight.  Great insights,  #GoJoe2020
This makes me sad bc this is exactly how trump won in the first place but I get not wanting to vote for Biden Hes trash too
I’m from Pennsylvania. I’m voting for Joe Biden.
Biden &amp; the Dems cruelly take advantage of African Americans, because they are automatically expected to vote Democrat so they think they don’t have to earn their vote. It’s a damn shame. You can hear it in Biden’s voice. #wakeup
Takes advantage because blacks apparently according to Joe Biden have to vote Democrat🤦🏻‍♂️
I am patiently waiting for a Biden Trump debate that I believe the Democrats will not allow to happen. Biden will bleed out in a debate before Trump gets to say a damn word.
If Biden was the vaccine his brain wouldn’t be leaving him
Hey idk what world you live in but Biden is the child sniffing &amp; unwanted massage giver🤦🏻‍♂️
Biden Supporters are smart. Trump will eat him alive. 😂
I cant say im thrilled with Biden. But i will likely vote for him. I am a Sanders supporter. And the way Bernie was Trashed by the DNC i can not respect that at all. This primary was rigged. I Do not respect the DNC after this. Im voting to get rid of trump. But i am not happy
Sadly Joe Biden will do just as bad if not worse, Race relations will really deteriorate with Biden in the White House. So if you are Racist Vote Joe Biden to get what you want. 👍
All they do is complain about Biden. And back Trump. Their rhetoric is horrifying when you listen to them.  Its almost like they agree with trump being a murderer.. All of them try to justify hate for BLM. And antifa is a terror group to them. Where has truth gone. America doomed
Joe Biden doesn't know what day of the week it is.
Can you explain what Biden is talking about here? This is the guy you are voting for to run our country. You are abusing an elderly person because you ave so much anger in your heart for our president.
He got us out of Obama’s depression in a few months. He fixed horrible trade deals with nafta and China. He has kept the socialist attack at bay. What has Biden done? Does he even know what office he is running for???
If we elect Biden, we will get 4-8 years more of Barrack Obama. We already had 8 years of Obama.
I hope so.   Cause I've seen dozens and dozens of Trump signs and less than a handful of Biden
That fact that people are suffering, yet are willing to vote for Biden [or trump] is disconcerting. They seem oblivious as to why the middle/lower classes are suffering. You vote for same-same, you get same-same.
I certainly am. Biden will be Green [party] with envy.
I didn’t send you one from the pandemic because there aren’t any that exist 😂 Biden hasn’t held a rally in over four months because he isn’t trying to kill people
You said “nOw Do A bIdEn RaLlY” so you got one 😂 Biden isn’t holding any right now because he isn’t trying to kill people!
Think democrats are stuck with Biden its too late.
I am poor, on SSDI and live month to month but I am a loyal Conservative.  I only went Democrat to Vote for Bernie Sanders. I will Vote Biden over COVID-19 for health reasons then back to my party.
Biden is eating into Trump's Rust Belt base - CNN  via
Let’s just see how Biden does in the debate and then we can all have our cruel little comments. See if his Fanbase still is large enough after that
Biden Supporters Hope to See Erie County Swing Blue this Election Year
I put my "Pennsylvania for Biden " sign in my front yard two weeks ago.
Joe Biden is senile. Socialists will run this country while he reads what they write for him on a teleprompter. You may hate trump, but why do you like Biden? And yes, America was never stronger pre covid. New York’s response to covid is the real issues, hate on coumo.
I'm seeing biden signs and stickers everywhere
Biden criticizes Trump's every move, from pandemic handling to foreign policy, with statements that are long on platitudes and short on facts. Biden needs to challenge Trump to a public debate where each candidate's position can be explained in detail.
Politics aside it’s real shitty that Barack Obama used a funeral for a political campaign to try to help pathetic Joe Biden. I mean shit we can’t even put politics aside to honor the dead SMH. This could’ve been an opportunity for “the best speaker” to unify us &amp; instead divides
Is Joe Biden really as dumb as he sounds. He makes absolutely no sense
Would be best for Biden not to Debate Trump. He should stay far away from it. Trump will call him on his record in Washington, on his extremely racist dialogue so Biden should hide. Trump wants a debate he smells blood in the water, Trump will grind him up.
Tammy's still got It!   "Tammy Duckworth Is Nothing and Everything Like Joe Biden."
Easy fix, Congressman, simply make a statement that "The Church" is not a church and a Biden administration should take prompt steps to strip it of its tax-exempt status.
Political analyst makes plea for Biden not to debate Trump
What Happened to Stacey Abrams Will Happen to Joe Biden
The Joe Biden Brand shampoo OF kids smell can only be purchased in DC.
Nope unless they have good strong policies but then with the traitorous Marxist Left it is possible?   If Biden Wins then yes super possible as they will end the Electoral College and strip small populated States of their rights to a say in politics.
If that proves to be true and that happened it would be bigger than the Watergate scandal and highly worthy of Prison for Obama and Joe Biden as well as Hillary Clinton and top ranking dirty cops in the FBI. Bordering on Treason this must be fully investigated and prosecuted!
What Biden's handlers are doing to him is elder abuse. The polling is already tightening. Wait till the debates.
You make fun of Trump's crowd and then justify why Biden couldn't fill a phone booth. BTW...
And yet it is still about 10 times the size of any *crowd Biden could draw.
Erie county considered a bellwether county, meaning it could be a good indicator of who wins the election this year.
I can see why the average dem voter thinks he's a strong candidate. My parents keeps saying Biden will mop the floor with Trump in a debate and I had no idea why they would think that. Now I see that they are expecting this guy to show up.
I'm one of those new PA Republicans. Trump signs all over my city, have yet to see even one for Biden.
So if Trump wins I will not have Committed suicide because I voted for Joe Biden then I am clear of all Suicidal choices if he wins and I can die of COVID-19 knowing I did not cause it. If that makes sense in a corny way?
COVID-19 he did fumble this ball, is the reason I will vote for Biden Because If I vote Trump and he wins then I in a sense committed Suicide. I want Trump to win but I do not want to pull a suicide lever.
I don't give a shit what people have you work for it and earn it then all is good as long as it is legal. If I hate a person it will be for their attitude not their skin color, skin color hate is what racism is. And that is not me and I support Trump. But on COVID-19 I go Biden.
Biden should challenge Trump to a debate regarding corona virus policies. That way both candidates can explain their policies in detail.
Is Trump threatening America with war if Joe Biden wins?
It's not an opinion. Biden and the Democrap party do not stand for the issues that I feel strongly about. Why would I continue to vote for one? It's asinine to continue to vote for status quo.
Not supporting Biden is not supporting Biden.
Sorry, no. That not voting for Biden is a vote for Trump bullshit is just that, bullshit. A vote for Trump is a vote for Trump. I'll be voting Green again this year. So my vote for the Green party candidate is a vote for the Green party candidate.
There are enough people on the left who will vote for the letter in ( ) after a name regardless of who that is. Also, I have no doubt some registered Republicans will be voting for Biden. Middle of the road liberals aren't going to be an issue.
Joe Biden is a Trojan horse full stop. #MAGA
"Radical Identity Politics," in my opinion, uses a mix of Identity and Leninism to bring Governments to heel.   Obama isn't doing this RN, but the WSJ is pointing out that he's getting close. Scary as he'll be at the TOP of the Biden ticket.

Weatherford cartoon: Biden and China
Just need Joe Biden to stay alive until then.
If they can manage to get enough votes to pass both chambers and land on President Biden's desk he could sign the bill making the popular vote the law of the land. If they can pull this off the country is lost. Then only New York, California, Texas &amp; Florida votes will count.
He was living his life as a free American, making his own decisions and deciding what personal risks to take. He was not hiding in his basement like Biden. People get the virus every day. If I am one of them, I want to get it at a Trump rally—not at a Satancratic riot.
He had a delicious Joe Biden at the Kingswood Community Center. That's a joke, I don't know where I am.
Based on polls, Biden is 95 days away from humiliating Trump and his followers and they're going to impeach him again now?
Devin Nunes declines to say whether he received foreign information meant to damage Biden
What did Biden do to you? Here I'm clueless?
Biden! Because I'm saying I'm voting for Biden to avoid scrutiny while actually voting Trump.
FIRST: Trump and the entire GOP began to tank in the polls. Here in PA, Trump is trailing Biden by 7 points and I’m within single digits of Mike Kelly.  (THREAD)
You mean the Biden that people are saying that he's going senile Biden? GTFO with your conspiracy theory!
I hope it is only real Americans are true Blue Republicans! And Everything but COVID-19 Trump got right. But for my health I must vote Biden but if Trump wins I'm content. I just don't want to pull a suicide lever. COVID-19  is my true enemy! 😔😔😔
Do you ever do real work? Or do you just tweet your life away while Americans are dying because you dont know how to lead?  Joe Biden knows so much more than you. He knows how to serve his county, no bonespurs for him! He also loves America. You only love you.
I thought picking between Trump and Hillary was rough, but Biden and Trump might be worse. How is Biden the best the democratic party has to offer? Out political system is a joke.
NO CHANCE!! Biden 2020 🇺🇸

Just another stab at Trump. Democrats are so full of Hatred they are backing a White Supremacist for the Presidency in Joe Biden.   I will go and vote Joe Biden on November 3, 2020 over COVID-19. But I do not like Biden, I never will and if he wins I will cry.
It’s not Trump’s America you dunce. It’s Democrat run cities, so you have proven our point that you are evil. Able to watch your own cities burn for political gain because Biden is a terrible candidate... shame on you.
Yet on Biden's record you should look it up. If you claim Black Lives Matter than you would not be voting for Biden because his whole career has been set against people of color. His 1994 Crime Bill with the well known Racist Strom Thurmond proves that.
Haha, you're so scared to lose to Biden
Biden is a racist, you cannot see that. He is spinning blacks like a top. Selecting a woman of color to be his running mate is manipulating the black voter despite all his past racist statements, gestures and gaffes.
I’m one of your biggest fans would love a response and your opinion on if you think the Democrats will actually somehow let Joe Biden slide and get out of debating? I’d love to see it because there’s no way Trump would not just destroy him
Bad mistake on his part this virus is an Aerosolized pathogen which makes it highly contagious, is why the spikes in cases are so high. Wear the mask it's better than nothing. Also we must Vote Biden because Trump is not approaching this Virus seriously.
So go to the polls and vote and when you do and Die not my problem. I will vote for Joe Biden over COVID-19 if I can vote by mail if not I vote for no one. It's not worth my life.
it seems like the only commercials I can't skip on Youtube are ones trashing Joe Biden and trying to install fear into people. That's annoying, guess I'll just stop watching YouTube for awhile.
I heard that too and I hope to God that happens because they could be a smaller version of what happens to America if Joe Biden gets elected. We can’t let the left take the Senate and the White House.
How long are we gonna do this song and dance? This does not prove he is racist what this is is a block on the planned attack on the suburbs from Joe Biden. I’m sorry but who thinks low income housing in the middle of the suburban neighborhoods is a good idea
Thank you for not allowing Biden’s terrible attack on the suburbs to go through
This also shows they are not confident that Biden can win without special help so no one should pay attention to the polls saying he’s ahead. Why suggest the need to change the voting method to a method that could lead to more fraud unless you weren’t confident in your candidate.
Is there a particular reason we do not hear anything regarding Biden sexually assaulting the staff worker or how he had the prosecutor fired in the Ukraine or he was going to withhold money. Thought maybe I was dreaming and this was unreal
You are is delusional and the rest laughed what they did to borrow yesterday was ridiculous especially when he has for a bathroom break you people are so delusional no one in their right mind would ever elect Joe Biden let alone his running mate Kamala Harris let’s face it
Enjoy it now because it’ll never last Biden doesn’t have a brain let alone any running mate that’s were talking about and if it’s Kamala Harris the hate towards her is worse than the hate towards Trump can’t wait for you people when Trump wins reelection what are you gonna do joy
Trump is a great President just not on COVID-19 but everything else he is spot on. With Joe Biden you will put a racist in office. "I do not want my kids growing up in a jungle, a racial Jungle." 1977 Joe Biden on Desegregation debate.
So true Biden made that claim but hell they ignore all his racist gaffes anyhow!
Yep welcome to the New CCP. Once Biden wins freedom of speech is dead in America, quite possibly worse. Look for a Coup to overthrow our Government system.
Honestly not sure who to vote for. I vote for county more then party.   I am not a huge Trump fan but Joe Biden literally did not know what city he was in today or what year it was.   Just can’t believe these two are the best we have.   #usa #maybethingsgetbetterin2024
A strong Vice President. If Trump is re-elected the next four years will be hell and anything he does could effect us (particularly young people) for years to come. Please, just consider voting for Biden. Thanks for taking the time to read this.
I'm gonna vote like biden Is 50 points behind
The next president will be choosing her replacement. The court is already stacked with conservative justices. That replacement and the make-up of the court will effect you and all young people for decades. Also, unlike Trump, Biden will surround himself with strong people. And
I have sons in their early 20s. I absolutely understand what you’re saying. Many conversations with them about this exact issue. And yeah, I’m not thrilled with Biden either. That being said, please look at the bigger picture. RBG isn’t going to be able to work for much longer.
wait, isn't that kinda what most VP's do, even Biden?Biden a racist?
...about different things," Biden said. "You go to Florida, you find a very different attitude about immigration than you do in Arizona. So it's a very diverse community."  which is true.  that's why outliers like idiots like Diamond and Silk stood out for being lackies.
of course Donnie et al don't actually quote Biden because they know they are lying  This is what Biden said ""Unlike the African American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly diverse attitudes ...
says the man who lauds nazis and white supremacists, and poor thing couldn't make it to John Lewis' funeral since he was having a temper tantrum.      So, is Biden "sleep" or does he threaten god?    what a moron.  #NobodyLikesTrump

Biden Insults Black Americans — Again
you have to stop referring to  as a Trojan horse.  While I do think he's a cover for something more sinister, the Trojan horse was at least appealing.  Biden is far from appealing.
It's almost like he doesn't even understand the concept of God. The Biden campaign could just run with it and use it as his new slogan. Joe Biden. Stronger than God.
No one cares about Biden simply mispronouncing a word, climate clisis was funny. We care that he can't even say he is mentally fit. That out of nowhere anytime he's talking to a black person he calls them a junkie, or says they ain't black, or says he knows about roaches.

Thing is, I dunno what Trump has left in his bag of tricks. He's hit Biden with everything - health, sexual assault, communism, religion, racism...all of the lies failed. He's running out of time.
Gods know I'm no campaign manager expert, but it seems to me that every attack Trump has launched at Biden has failed. Unemployment is a mess. A lot of people are about to get evicted. Covid-19 doesn't take days off.  Trump needs a new plan, fast.
and protect you from the bible killing, gawd threatening, Jeebus hating Joe Biden...
well now Jebus, yesterday Trump indicated that Biden wants to hurt you...and the bible.
Trump: Biden is weak! Biden is confused! Biden is old!  Also Trump: Biden will murder GOD! One of these things is not like the other.
I don't think Donny has the balls to actually organize a hit on Biden tho. Hes too big a coward for that.  I could see Trump just quitting the race tho.
Dude can't even read. This is why I'm not afraid of Biden debating this clown.

Y'all worried about Biden's fart while Trump shits in your dinner.
I renew my proposal to do this arbitration style. Trump picks a moderator, Biden picks a moderator, then the two moderators pick a third. Easy, fair and fun.
I'm calling it now - Trump won't attend any presidential debates. He knows Biden would wipe the floor with him, and he's a coward.
Biden can’t even speak without falling all over himself. Trump will capitalize on that and fluster Biden even more. Trump is a POS, but he doesn’t get nervous. Joe does. You’re being delusional if you think trump won’t exploit that.
Biden should stay out of it. By all means clear the road for state and district litigators to pursue their cases free from any obstruction at fed level (I.e. congressional Republicans), but otherwise keep the president out of it.
R u talking about Biden or Trump. ALL softball ?s for Biden
Boo, love of mine, Uncle Bernie, you literally just gave 10 reasons with “Trump” in every single one. You know deep down, Biden doesn’t have a damn thing to offer.
You’re conflating “supporting” with “voting”. Millions of people will vote for Biden not necessarily because they “support” him, but simply because they hate trump. See 2016 as an example.
Biden seems to get sloppy when the interviewer is a Black Man. He gets comfortable then seems to stumble into a gaffe. His team needs to address this tendency.
Get to work, Biden Bros!
Don't forget when Trump is constantly blaming the "invisible enemy" on China that it was Trump, not Obama or Biden or China, TRUMP that disbanded our pandemic response team and our scientists in China that could have prevented this.  It seems he is appeasing this "enemy" as well.
Wait- you want people who don’t support Biden to make phone calls for him? Have you thought that through?
Again I have to ask myself if Trump is doing this to justify arresting Biden, Hillary or Obama before Nov. Because even Donny knows he's losing right now, and crazy/stupid/desperate people tend to the extreme.

Biden isn't hiding, he knows that Trump is a giant dumpster fire desperately looking for the next big distraction. He's not going to make it easy for Donny to puke on his shoes and change the subject.
Biden was VP for 8 years. He knows how to run a presidential election, and hold his own in a high stakes political campaign.  So I really don't know why conservatives are pushing this latest story, because it doesn't stand up for even a nanosecond.
That is indeed, really scary. The US Constitution makes it clear that Joe Biden would not complete his first term whether by 25th amendment removal or natural causes that succession goes to the Vice President.  However, who would actually be running the government prior to that?

The Coronavirus is a Communist Chinese pandemic that was funded by Obama-Biden-Fauci-Gates who gave money to the Wuhan Laboratory. Democrats Governors murdered &amp; accounted for up to half of all the CV-19 deaths by forcing infected patients into the nursing homes.

For reference, this was Gov. Tom Wolf’s map in the 2018 midterms.  He won comfortably by a bigger margin than Biden will, so subtract 5-7% from Wolf’s vote share in each county, and that’s likely what Biden needs to get.
Also, Joe Biden is an Irish Catholic kid born in Scranton, and if you know anything about Scranton, you know that means a lot.  For that matter, Dr. Jill Biden’s from Montgomery County herself, which may help Joe a bit in the Philly burbs.
I’m not aware of much polling at that level.  What I can say is that areas like this swung from voting for Trump (or very nearly doing so, in Lackawanna’s case) in 2016 to voting for Gov. Wolf (D) and Sen. Casey (D) in 2018.  If Biden can replicate that, he’s good.
Of course it’s possible Biden could win PA a different way — through strong appeal to suburban voters, instead of peeling off just enough rural ancestral Dems.  For Path #2, you’d want high turnout &amp; big margins in Delaware, Chester, Montgomery, Lehigh, &amp; Northampton.
A lot comes down to turnout in big counties &amp; keeping Trump’s margin in check in rural PA.  For bellwethers, see if Biden wins counties like Lackawanna (Scranton) &amp; Erie by a decent bit.  If he does that, it‘s mean he’s winning just enough blue-collar ancestral Dems to win PA.

Uninstalling twitter for a minute.   My regular timeline is "Chile sucks, rapists walk free every day, we're all going to die" and my academic timeline is "Biden sucks, Trump sucks, Penn State is having us sign a "please give me COVID and kill me" document, wtf."  Bye.  So bye.
I’m trumps mind, he is God. So yeah, Biden will hurt God
If trump doesn’t cracks 15% would you agree that if you dont vote for biden then you aint black?
Thread by  A completely deranged Trump claims Joe Biden will "hurt God" if elected president…
talking to strangers isn't that fun tbh like what if they're boring or a biden supporter🤢
I don't see either claiming disbanding the NRA would destroy the 2a. Trump was talking about Biden getting elected and the other called it an "assault" on the 2a.
For the first time since 1967 I am not into the US Presidential election, yet must say BIDEN -- a burnt toast.  This world demands American MUSCLE  and for obvious reasons to stand up to ISLAMISM &amp; CHINIMISM!  And this comes from a diehard liberal, now a realist or something!
For a long time my strategy was just to shut up and let the right and the true believers embarrass themselves into obscurity. That was before I understood those ideologies exist solely in the absence of shame and humility. Biden will be photographed washing leper’s feet soon.
Biden is a history for Indian Americans!
So what you’re telling me is a country of 300+ million people the best two people we can put up for election is Donald trump and Joe Biden

This comment / question was horrendous ! Joe Biden really laid out this in the open of just how crazy &amp; ignorant he really is !!! WTH is the outrage ?? 🤬🤬🤬 if trump would have said this ... there would be more riots &amp; looting ... double standard hypocrisy !
I responded to Biden’s post earlier and seem to have annoyed the gun nuts.  In general, reading comprehension and awareness of history are not their strong points.
If you think Joe Biden is anywhere close to a communist you are a moron
Biden don’t need to debate trump! Trump needs Biden to debate him so he can misinform again and flat out make up all kinds of b.s. ! Don’t debate him period what’s he gonna talk about? Trump will play trumps greatest fear mongering hits. Let  him debate himself!
Awesome. One of many reasons I’m voting for Biden. Good man.
If Biden doesn’t pick a VP soon I would like the nominate myself. Thank you.
I know they’re only doing this because they don’t have anything else, but why? As far as anyone under the age of 60 is concerned they’re the same age. And questioning Biden’s mental acuity only makes me compare it to Trump’s. Trump loses every time.
GOP is mistaken here. Nobody who was going to vote for Biden will vote for Kanye. He's just going to split the "Very Stable Genius" vote with Trump.
Sure.  Do you find it ironic that the USPS union has endorsed Biden?

Still confused as to why anyone other than himself wants him on the ballot. Nobody would flip from Biden to him, &amp; he’s so close to tRump politically, he could take some votes away from him. Unless they’re trying to set up a scapegoat for a return in 2024 with one of the sons.
well i guess that means Biden's got my vote sealed up
Can't vote for Biden -- I don't see how a senile old man can serve as president -- time to get real folks.
A lot of trump supporters weren’t happy with your interview on HBO, they saw you get your ass whipped by facts checks right to your face in real time. How’s it feel getting called out on all your lies and bullshit? Maga hats will burn, and they will vote Biden or not vote at all
Whoever Joe Biden picks as Vice President will be the President within 2 years of the election. Biden’s obvious Dementia will get bad to the point where he can no longer lead and he will voluntarily resign and give the office to his VP, most likely Kamala Harris. Calling it now.
Biden does not have to do a single interview. Daddyo beats himself!
Watching him debate Biden will age me 50 years at the minimum
Apparently you have no direct experience dealing with a family member struggling with dementia. Both my parents have it. On the other hand my husband’s parents do not. Big difference. Trump has it Biden does not.
Trump beats himself everyday. Biden doesn't need to do a thing!

“VPing while black” that’s a new one.  Could  possibly get any more racist?   Whoever he ends up picking, Biden at the very least put a lot of consideration into multiple choices.
... qualified people that should have won the primary over him.  I even had one claim “Well Biden hasn’t done anything about the virus either” - ignoring that he’s not the one in charge of the Executive Branch nor is he even in any office at all right now.
That time Joe Biden said "I'm gonna beat Joe Biden". 😂
Huh. Didn't see Biden's name mentioned once is that thread.
We needed a President Jimmy Carter to give us a President Ronald Reagan.   Now, we are going through a President Donald Trump to give us a President Joe Biden.   Hope is on the way!

You’d prefer a conman with over 20 sexual assault and misconduct allegations, who’s been know to hang with Epstein? Who wishes Jizzlane Maxwell “well”? If this is your reason for voting against Biden, I hope you see the better reasons to vote against trump.

I'll vote for Biden regardless of who he picks. But my preference is Kamala or Val.
If we can get him to debate Trump, Trump will make him so confused he will cry.  Of course his handlers won’t allow that. Now you know why the liberal governors what this virus to go on till Nov.  Biden doesn’t have to talk in public.
Of what? The corrupt left? Didn’t you get fired from CBS Dan? You really think people want to hear from you. If Biden has the balls to debate Trump (he doesn’t), I predict Trump will make him cry.

You’re going to lose so bad that you won’t accept defeat, you will hold dear to your belief that the whole world was out against you, but you’ll be wrong, it’s the American people who are sick of your shit that will be voicing their disappointment in you by voting Biden! #biden

This is the behavior you have normalized in America. You are the absolute worst president and I hope Biden doesn’t hang your picture on the wall where it doesn’t deserve to be.
All of this.  Biden knows he's the gateway President. I would think Presidential aspirations would be a bonus.  ESPECIALLY when packaged with someone who has been the best surrogate he has had this campaign.
Difference is Va and NY aren’t really in play in November. Wolf has been strong with suburban voters that need to go Biden. No reason to do anything to piss them off. Too much at stakeChina is the economic powerhouse of the world right now, and they know that Biden will bring predictability and lack of change, so they can stay on top.  Putin is nostalgic for the days of the Cold War, and having a puppet in the WH is in his own interests.  Either way, we lose.
What kind of drugs are you on? Biden can’t even change his own diaper
If you want to make the case for ACA with Biden I will give you that. He will bandaid it. But getting healthcare like the rest of the developed world has will not be accomplished under either a Trump or Biden administrator.

endured a less than loving childhood. I have more faith in him than BIDEN, simply because he has a child he loves. I think he wants to prove to himself he can fix the broken problems in our country. I see the age of Aquarius working. #SaveTheChildren
😂😂😂😂. He is not going to let the legacy Obama/Biden ACA die. He said if it were to cross his desk he would veto it. So our chances with Trump and Biden are exactly the same when it comes to M4A.. zero.
SAVE THE CHILDREN  Have Bernie join on some of your policies, and get his voters to join you. We are the largest group! Sitting around NOT WANTING BIDEN.
Has anyone else noticed that whenever Trump shows off his stupidity (Yo Semite, Thighland, etc.), the Trump camp immediately goes on the attack against Biden's supposed "cognitive decline"?
HERE IS THE DEAL, DNC you look like idiots running Biden still, he is literally too mentally decayed. You should have pushed Bernie through. We are sick of Biden saying ding bat statements.
Well, Biden is against Trump...  and Trump believes that he IS God.
How many more times will Biden have to apologize for his racist bullshit before November? 🙃
Oh wow are we going to start that again... do you do anything but try to scare people ... just like your commercials were you try to scare people into believing what Biden’s presidency will look like when in FACT your showing pictures of your OWN PRESIDENCY worst president ever..

Never worried about Biden even when my job went to Mexico
I don't think Biden ever specified a POC, just a woman.
Of course Biden doesn’t want to debate he’s going to get destroyed Especially for the inappropriate touching a little girls
And FWIW, I don't want it to be Warren, either.  Just my gut feeling because Bernie's following is big enough to sway the election.  2016 proved that, and Biden certainly knows that.
Why the hell would you Tweet about your popularity in Frorida while nearly 200 people are dying there each day from covid and the relatives and children are praying for so many others? Republicans with hearts, and Christians, now have to vote Biden because of your daily hate.
I can’t wait for trump to bring up the improper touching of little girls by Biden in the debates. We’re all going to be like
No one there will be happy. A bunch of Christians being told they have to vote for a man who hates them, Tweets hate for veterans and allows their relatives to die in Florida, Texas, and more, and who allowed 140,000 to die. Some won't vote, some will vote Biden out of conscience
Why are they renominating such a horrible human being? They are giving people who are about real issues, like abortion, no choice except a hateful man who allowed 140,000 adults to die (more to come too). As a result kind hearted Christians now must vote Biden. No choice

This is the first time a VP pick had so much importance. Because of Biden's age/health. This VP has good chance of stepping in or running "24."  Still say Biden should not have suggested anything until he made pick. Too bad, he can't go back.

make it go vital - “30/70 Trump”. Followed by he wants to govern 30% of the country and Biden wants to govern 70% and 30%   Make it go virul at all of your media taking points.
A vote for Biden is a vote for a Marxist takeover. #Trump2020 #KAG

Biden has no good VP choices in the field under consideration
Do you listen to Biden try to make any sense when he opens his mouth. Freakin Pelosi is drunk and slurs every damn word. Again, just shut up!
I recently responded to a phone poll asking who I would choose between Biden/Trump and Biden/Pence. Maybe this is why  doesn't want votes reported.
No! Stop it!  This attitude will not solve anything!  I’m not saying I’m enthused about him, but if we don’t say “Vote Biden” then Trump will win!  Pick the future you want!
MAGAts will go down hard Nov. 3. Can't wait to see  and your crime family escorted from White House in cuffs. No bail! Your day is coming...and soon! Biden 2020!!
Forget “Sleepy Joe”. Need to use “Hiding Biden”.  He and the Press are scared to have #HidingBiden being exposed to questions, public &amp; scrutiny.   will whip #HidingBiden  in a debate.
TikTok is going to be banned by Trump. Trump is an asshole, and sure I don't use TikTok and was planning on voting for Biden anyway instead of the scumbag cheeto known as TheDonald... "As a Gen Z" fuck you Trump, you sack of shit taking way people's fun during the pandemic.
you are like doggy doo once its on your shoe  its impossible to get it off...it has to wear off and trust me you've worn off Americans shoes everyone that loves Trump is rejoicing you endorsed Biden,, one idiot helping another its so cosmopolitan.
even if Biden gets to be president,you still never  will.

you can only be talking about Joe Biden and YES, that sick, racist criminal will certainly get his ass kicked on November 3, despite the fact that Demoncrats are doing everything imaginable to cause election confusion, so they can CLAIM they won and incite mass rioting. we see U
Omg Biden needs to drop out
So we let Trump kill us all or we live and March March on Biden! I wasn't going to vote for Joe but I need to live to fight for our Bernie Platform! Oh I agree with Nina Turner Completely!
We should because it is going to be overwhelming victory for Joe Biden  and many, many Democrats around the country. And, you made it happen.

Biden 2020: Nothing better exemplifies the diverse and racially appropriate culture of this country than an old, rich, white man, credibly accused of sexual harassment multiple times whose been in politics in D.C. for 48 years.  Textbook definition of progress.
Joe Biden is the uncle who forgets the nieces and nephews names at family gatherings. Trump is the uncle who stares at his nieces ass all day, shits himself and blames the dog
And yet, today  floated the idea of delaying the November election today. Biden, it seems, knows how the president thinks better than Turley.
President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, have very different plans for the next four years.
And you really believe Joe Biden is the answer I guess that explains why you rehearse in the shed
I mean I think these are hilarious.   Biden 2020: If you don't vote for me you ain't black!
“This is what Biden’s America without police will look like. Look at the anarchy!!!” Uhhhh this is America with police. They haven’t magically disappearedHey I'm white and I'm Ridin with Biden
As much as I despise Biden and want Trump to win, at the absolute peak he flips every swing state, which is like a 2% chance of happening. I'd give him a 50/50 of keeping every state for 2016. We will never see a R or D win 49 states given the national discourse.
Biden at best flips PA, WI, MI plus what Hillary won in 2016.
Are Democrats going to just sit back while Trump is literally saying Biden is against God.
Joe Biden is literally everything the Democrats want to paint Trump as.
As much as Trump and McCain disagree, Biden ideologically stands against all the principles McCain enshrined.

Does Biden even know what he is saying. Bring on the debate.
Since he's set to announce it soon, apparently, which woman do you think Biden will ultimately end up choosing?
Disenchanted Seniors for Biden
Cue terrible Republicans suddenly caring about the debt again. Screw you I pray Biden raises taxes on the rich and spends so much money.
It doesn't matter if he leaves the WH or not. He is no longer president on 1/20/21  noon. Biden can assume the duties from his basement.
Use zoom. Mr Biden would be totally baffled by the mute button and Mr  Trumps head wouldn't fit in the frame. Ha
I think Biden picks Harris on Wednesday but if it's not Harris I will support whoever the Vice Presidential nominee is.
she's not evil. Now Biden, Clinton, Harris, and Obama, well perhaps.
Biden hasn't released 40+ years of Senate records, which he has sealed Dec 31 2019. What is he hiding?
Biden said in May that he hoped to name his pick around Aug. 1 and told reporters this week that he would “have a choice in the first week of August.”
Trump has done more good for black employment than any president in our history. Also prison reform,which Has been a major issue since Biden pushed for stricter enforcement against blacks.
Do real evangelicals support Biden &amp; others who support abortion on demand through the 9th month of pregnancy? How about not creating jobs to help minorities, just keep them enslaved on welfare &amp; generationally indebted to Democratic Party?
if he gets his way, yes. However, DON'T VOTE BIDEN so we don't run that risk
1.  Defund USPS (make mail-in voting tough) 2.  Fail the American people on virus response (make voting feel unsafe) 3.  Kill all election security Bill's 4.  Try to delay the election when all else fails  Biden is far from perfect but my god does human decency have any role
And Trump is why we will elect Biden.
If Biden does not pick Kamala Harris  it does not mean he is a fucking racist. JFC enough from some of the #KHIVE people.

Here is the fact-check from
Answer this question honestly and do not go beyond what is being asked: Who is the better HUMAN BEING, Trump or Biden?
we did better than Biden, and more social distancing with ours!
Why do people keep asking this? If he loses the election, on January 20th he is no longer president. Biden can operate from his basement and he is still the president.😂🤪😂🤪 According to reports China is helping Biden.
Stop. This is not a difficult decision. You vote for Biden.
Politics aside, I do find it interesting that China and Iran would want Biden over Trump and Russia would want Trump.  You’d think those three countries would want the same person.
...or whatever thing Trump's people decide to release to distract people from Volume 5.  Since they don't have any dirt on Biden and their attempts to make shit up about him have gone nowhere, they could do something similar to the Access Hollywood stunt.
You must really be an ignorant person when it comes to this pos of a man.  He's always been a racist from then in 1977 to the 1994 crime bill to right now in the shit he says. But you go ahead defend the racist democratic party.
Trump's Rant About How Joe Biden Will Kill God Was Insane But Clarifying - Esquire
Russia Continues Interfering in Election to Help Trump, U.S. Intelligence Says
I don’t know exactly what Biden said, but I do know I’m not the least bit concerned about it. My focus is on getting Twitler (and McConnell) out office. Full stop.
via  you know ⁦ will harp on China part of this story within a peep about Russia
Did you forget to say that it also shows that Iran and China are helping Biden, or was that purposeful and biased of you?

Bro what stats do you have on the economics getting worst for black people? All your really saying is you don’t like him.. and the privatization of prisons he was not an elected official . It was a business move ... Biden has been in politics for 30+ years and NOTHING good
imagine waiting in a line for 8 hours during covid to vote for Biden lol
pay attention...........
via   Putin only wants ⁦ bc he’s a fool. They laugh at how easily he can be manipulated. That’s pathetic.
under a biden administration malarkey will carry similarly heavy penalties
need to get Biden on TV more, he's digging his own hole. Do the democrat's have another candidate? You may end up running unaposed.
Thr Left doesn’t care about God or the Military or the constitution until there’s something in it for them? Trump says Biden wants to hurt (the concept of) God and they go bonkers but I remember in 2012 when the dems tried to unsert GOD into the platform and they booed #biden
I’m old enough to remember when Greg said Biden wouldn’t be the nominee. Now he’s regurgitating the same desperate shit with absolutely no evidence to back up his dumb ass comment!
If any of this were true, Mitt would know that Joe Biden, dead for days, (think Weekend at Bernie's) is a far superior choice than the absolute idiot in the Oval now.
What’s gone change for black people when Biden wins lol
I swear to God the next #Trump ad that comes on the air here in #Pennsylvania is going to be #Biden calling to euthanize all puppies and kittens.  The Trump campaign is getting that desperate. I probably just planted the idea in their heads...
these are the same clowns that claim trump NEVER SAYS ANYTHING RACIST, but want us to believe that Biden is a racist!🤣🤣🤣 you can’t make this shit up
We don’t need you to debate Joe Biden. Your actions speak louder than words you mispronounce. Everyone sees you are a walking, talking disaster. #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica

I’m attending Joe Biden for President’s event, “Biden National Volunteer Call with Special Guests” – sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
Joe Biden has said in the past he wants a tax break for the people in the top 1% of the world in earnings. Let that sink in...
Exactly, Biden needs to take the cognitive test now
By doing what he accused Biden of.... making a generalization about Black people   “Black culture is the most appropriated culture in the world. It’s a culture that places emphasis in degeneracy”
Joe Biden explicitly said he doesn't give a damn about the economic struggles of our generation, and you want us to just shut up and get in line?
Joe Biden has done more bad towards black people than Donald trump. But CNN ain’t tell you that so it didn’t happen
Just in case it's not clear, that racist is Biden. Trump is also a racist and there is a zero percent chance that I would ever vote for him.
1. That’s a deflection to my comment about Trump.  2. Nearly anyone else would be better than Trump, especially Biden.  3. I disagree with the premise of your statement, he is not a closet racist.  But it’s a fact that Trump is an open racist, which you don’t seem to mind.
you only come on Fox when Joe Biden some some shut about blacks. YOU ARE SILENT WHEN TRUMP MAKES EVERY RACIST STATEMENT UNDER THE SUN. You’re a fraud dude!!#Biden2020

I think Biden could come out and say “I’m y’all niggas last option”.. Y’all would still vote for em 😂😂😂
Just the fact that Putin &amp; his  Communist Government want  to destroy Joe Biden, should   be enough to convince you   that TRUMP IS A PUTIN PUPPET!! A useful idiot!
Please keep believing this. Having fake confidence like this is exactly what we need for Biden to win in a landslide
Odd. Only thing I’ve seen is so-called short listers saying they’ll do everything possible to help Biden, regardless of choice. Begging, figuratively or literally? Don’t think so. Analysts have created cable demand. And fair/wise or not, ageism is perceived as EW weakness.
I heard Biden was bin-Ladens inside guy and actually planned 9/11.  I’m just saying.  It’s amazing what you’ll find when you fall down a Reddit rabbit hole.............
Remember you ain't BLACK if you vote for Trump. That's what Biden says..
SPREADING LIES ON BIDEN- looks fake- REPORT
My hope is that Biden will bring together the best and brightest Democratic leaders who will listen to the concerns of the people and govern according.
I get it. You don’t like Trump. He’s pompous and unpolished. He’s not at all a typical politician. He’s not presidential. I have voted R every year except 2016 when I voted L. But no way can ANYONE “conservative” vote for Biden. I don’t buy it.
So your stance is Biden is a racist but Trump is more of a racist?
Interesting that you think I’m shilling for Biden - I’m not. Just pointing out that he’s ignoring legislative history in his bronalysis
Pennsylvania is a Republican State. NOBODY here likes Democrats lmao, Go to ANY pub, Any Street Corner and shout "Biden For President" lol, 9 out of 10 people will say "Hell No" nobody wants that Pedo Kid Sniffer as a President are you Kidding me hahaha. Fuck News Media Liars.
I am using the fact that Donny sat on his oversized butt when the pandemic got here. Then he made excuse after excuse while pointing fingers at everyone. Now, no-one listens to him. We listen to real Dr’s and Scientist.  As does Biden. That’s where my vote is.
Oh, are you voting for Biden?
We are looking to Biden for sanity.
Certainly more stable than it is today. Biden isn't going to fawn over India like Trump.
"Could god create a stone so heavy that not even he could lift it?" "No, but Joe Biden could."
Although I don’t call Biden’s clarifying statement an apology....
Wasn’t a lecture. It was a correction. Biden said Black people. Saint HLN said he did not. He doesn’t need to be offended.
Faith is demonstrated in actions. Biden supports many anti-Christian policies.
This is racist AF 'Biden replied to the question from CBS News correspondent Errol Barnett, who is Black, by saying “That’s like saying to you, before you got on this program if you had taken a test were you taking cocaine or not. What do you think, huh? Are you a junkie?"'
"vote blue no matter who"
Watch out for the next Trump ads about the Chinese &amp; Iranians wanting Biden.   Intelligence community's top election official: China and Iran don't want Trump to win reelection, Russia working against Biden
Intelligence community's top election official: China and Iran don't want Trump to win reelection, Russia working against Biden
Oh yeah, definitely, but it's not as extreme a case as it is here. Certainly no one thought the Cheney or Biden picks meant they'd be the nominees in '08 or '16 (and 1% chance they'd be nominees in '04 or '12).
what are you going to do about the intelligence reporting that Russia is denigrating VP BIDEN - candidate for President? Where is your soul? Where is your integrity?
Can someone pls create a meme that says “I’m Joe Biden, and I’m told to approve this message.” 😂😂😂
GOP senators lead by Ron Johnson are actively disseminating Russian propaganda to attack Biden.
Can someone please make a meme that says “I’m Joe Biden, and I’m told to approve this messge”  😂 #JoeBiden #Biden2020 #Biden #WalkAwayFromDemocrats #WalkAwayCampaign
Hell yeah it does. Good luck gettin Biden for an interview
At Lewis’ funeral, Obama gave a campaign speech for Biden, attacking Trump, so...
Biden's record itself, denigrates him. Biden's inability to keep his hands and nose to himself, denigrates him.
Opinion:  As a staunch conservative who has voted Republican in past elections, I don’t take this lightly. I don’t agree with everything that Biden supports, nor am I 100% comfortable with the direction he wants to take the country.
Republicans voting for Biden is no Republican at all. A Biden admin would likely be most progressive, anti-American one in history. Just read unity platform.
Your point? It's Trumps right to attack Biden on the facts..So it's simple you don't like what's being said...lstop going to the White House &amp; stop going to briefings I'm sure there are plenty of Democratic/Leftists lies you can embellish with your mediocre skills as a "reporter"

Well vote for the cat-- Not Joe Biden😏
I like her she has tons of experience and she and Biden have a good work history . Makes sense . Regardless of who he picks Boone will be completely satisfied .
I should note that this is basically Biden’s approach to trans rights and he’s explicitly said so on numerous occasions
What a scathing attack on Biden’s part!!! 😂😂 he’s out of line! Goodness!
Knight, Halper, and BrieBrie aren't "Mainstream Media personalities".  They're far lefties... just like you.  And they stopped talking about Reade when it became abundantly clear Reade was lying.  and ps.  Biden isn't going to lose to Trump.
Has anyone thought about what the inauguration will look like? What about the acceptance speech? What about  and  first dance as President &amp; First Lady? Well if it can’t be a “ normal “ festivity with Covid - we will take that first dance from the Biden home 😊💙
I've read so much about "Kanye stealing black voters from Biden" but...what black person who plans on voting for Kanye was gonna vote for Biden? Even Chance stepped away from Ye.
Joe Biden’s next campaign move
In the end, i doubt Biden takes Texas. But the reality is that if Trafalgar has him at +6, the real number is much lower. Trump now has to defend Texas. Whereas Texas doesn't factor into Biden's path to 270... just his path to 400.
Trump's Insane Rant That Joe Biden Is 'Against God' Speaks Volumes
You just know the "person of color" Joe Biden picks to be his VP running is going to be Elizabeth Warren. So, when he steps aside, as has already been planned, the first black women to be president will be a white woman.
There wont be a vaccine or cure in January. So what do we do with them until August ‘21 is the question. Politicians say Jan so they can do: Biden wins “trump caused ur kid to not be able to play and im fixing it doe next fall” Trump wins “trump messed this up and its his fault”
Shucks Megan. I will forever think of you as I enjoy mine.
Um really...so now African Americans need Joe Biden to freaking guide them. Can’t even believe this guy has a chance
Criticize Biden all day long. There’s a lot to criticize.  Now say you’ll vote for him anyway, without enthusiasm, despite everything.
Do you think he meant that Trump supporters have not left their home states?  It's been confirmed that Trump leads with 'those without a college degree' and Biden is leading with 'those with a college degree.'
That’s possible. I’ll keep a sharp eye and ear out for any whisper of a suggestion that it’s worthwhile to vote for Biden against the raging fascist in power despite everything. If you have any links that’d set me straight I’d be grateful.
It doesn’t sound like it at all. If there’s been any content at all about how Biden sucks, “BUT...” I’ve totally missed it amid all the reveling in false equivalencies. One might easily get the mistaken impression BB’s all about accelerationism.
I am in PA and know it will be a battleground state. I will vote for Biden. I don't want to, but I feel we will have small gains from the current dumpster fire in the White House and once he picks his VP, that should let us see who is really going to run things.
This white lady is and I recommend all white people stand up and vote for Biden.
I hope you’re right because if Biden wins we all doomed. Just weird he’s favored and has been favored..
A. Delegates are bound on first vote and cannot change their vote.  Biden has ~2600. It's over.  B. I believe credible women, regardless of the person they accuse.   Tara Reade has been proven to be a liar, has lost all credibility, and is rightly being ignored now.  C. See A.
No one needs anyone to like Biden, stan for Biden, or find affinity with Biden. We need you to use Biden as the only crowbar available to remove the actual fascist and put us ina position where reform OR revolution is still possible.
Oh yes and we will go pack and pay the highest payment to United Nations as far as Biden is concerned. Every  president before just kicked the can down the road. That is the reason we are not the greatest of friends now with other countries as they don't pay their damn fair share
Yeah but if you don't want to vote Biden suddenly they're screaming about baby jails
They are stupid, I agree with you. They are not Biden voters. You want me to refer to neo-nazi Trump voters. Let's see why wins. I will take this guy over Neo-Nazi anyday.
“Trump is worse” is not a legitimate defense of racist comments, sorry. Especially considering what Biden said is actually way more racist than anything Trump has said. Also, your infographics are impressive for a third grader.
I mean Joe Biden is quoted saying that we shouldn’t integrate schools because they would turn into “jungles”. But go off liberal.

Wa chu tokin bout MSNBC? Trump attempts to paint Biden as a racist? Hell Trump doesn’t need to do anything, Joe’s doing it himself with the racist remarks you don’t want to recognize. A black woman VP for a potential racist President, holy crap, you kidding?
But he has been slow to criticize the president, while attacking Biden, who he says is “not special.”  When asked about his efforts to undermine the former vice president, West admitted: “I’m not denying it; I just told you.”
You got in essence 2 choices. Joe Biden &amp; Trump! Biden just declared that blacks were not diverse like latinos. Wait...what did he say? So...you got Biden who cant remember what he ate for breakfast &amp; Trump who cant stay off twitter. Dems had 8 yrs to get a candidate. Epic fail!
Well put. This is about where I'm at too. Although every time I see a Biden ad I have to ask myself, again, can I really pull the lever for this guy?

Yep. There's liberals who hate Biden and conservatives who hate Trump.
I still haven't made up my mind if "not Trump" means "Biden". But even if I decide to vote for Biden, I'll still be critical of his many, many flaws.   Best case scenario, his election would be a four year pause and then we'll probably get more fascism.
The race will be called by midnight on November 3rd.  That's how large of a victory Biden will have.  It will take a few days to get the final count... but Biden will be north of 270 electoral votes by midnight.

I think you may be having the same memory loss as Biden... Trump is great on debate stage. Performed well with large group of GOP candidates &amp; especially the one vs. Hillary was excellent.
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣 I don’t know what polls you are looking at, but the REAL POLLS show Vice President Joe Biden is LEADING by DOUBLE DIGITS
You’re rating it “mostly true” since Biden has been in basements.
Joe Biden and the Liberal Party have always been racist!!! They look at people as their slaves period and through taxation they have made us all slaves why do you think they're always trying to raise taxes🤔🤔 they are wolves in sheep's clothing👈
Heck just have a stage with a TV across from Trump. Play clips of Biden discussing Bernie's (excuse me) his socialist platform &amp; then let Trump talk about how each one will be devasting to America, what he plans to do instead ✅ It would be brilliant
Great story.

Obama/Biden were the best President/VP combination of your lifetime.
He’s only trying to run to take votes away from Biden for trump. He’s in on it!
I think this is where we’re talking past each other. I took it as Biden saying Blacks weren’t individuals and we all think the same. Not how we vote politically.
Biden is worthy of all the votes and it looks like he is getting them all    #BYEBYETRUMP AND FAMILY
I unfortunately live in PA, a swing state. I hate it but Ill be voting for Biden and then officially unregistering from the Democratic Party. (I know I could do that now, but I’ll need it on Election Day to wash the taste out of my mouth)
This is BS.  is a shameless hack.  Waiting for his post in the Biden admin.  Problem is Biden is gonna lose big time.
Call it what you want. "Team Obama", "Team Biden", "Team Get Trump The Fuck Out Of Office", "Team Goo Gone", the list goes on.  Whatever it may be, as long as it involves dismissing Trump, I am part of the Team! Who else?!
Um.. he's down over 6 million jobs since the day he took office. Obama/Biden created 11.5 million. Oops!
Screaming "Russia stole the election" for three years has only given the right the justification to act exactly like the left is acting if Biden wins.  Good job there.  We're toast either way.

Hey you may think its funny...  but Biden doesn't even know where he is most days... I think this test would be way too complicated for him.
Biden is a lost old soul. It’s sad. His racism is clear. His brain is not. #ElderlyAbuse
Wrong. His base would eat it up and undecideds would think it makes him look presidential.  Especially compared to Biden doing his acceptance speech from his basement bunker.
And trump got 398k votes and all the democrats combined got higher votes. Are you saying Biden might win Tennessee?
It's a damn shame that Joe Biden is the best the Democrats could find to run for President.   If you don't think he's the Best, then why would you part of a party that doesn't put it's best candidate forward?
Right. That’s what I meant. By all means, they all should be questioned. Who was polled. The method (landline, in person, online, etc). I’m not voting for Trump but I’m also not necessarily convinced Biden beating him in every poll means anything come Election Day.
of course they are angry trump is trying to destroy our country. just imagine how angry you’re going to be when Biden wins. Then you’ll know how they feel.
Well thank god Biden is a devout Catholic I was beginning to worry that the presidency would totally lose touch with an organization that habitually sexually assaults children and does nothing about it. I guess DJT was just doing that bit himself!
So you're taking every word the Biden says LITERALLY???  Stop the bullshit.
So we are still down 18 million jobs, 6 months later? Thanks. Makes my vote easier for Biden.
Even if you believe Trump's misrepresentation and took offense to Biden's statement yesterday, how is Trump claiming a single "Black vote" hive mind any different?
Biden is a undercover racist bitch and a pedophile
Joe Biden is facing new scrutiny over how he discusses race and ethnicity after drawing distinctions between Black and Hispanic populations.
Agree...we (Americans) should not be allowed to leave the country. I apologize for the douche that somehow got elected. Biden 2020 ❤️
And Biden is “well”?
I'm glad Biden is against Trump's kind of energy. Wish everyone was.
Joe Biden is off them beans
As an American and a Biden supporter...thank you for this. Please remember we are almost over this 4 year nightmare (fingers crossed)
We all must support Joe Biden and whomever he chooses as his Vice President ❣️💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙

Biden is more worthy than you.
I’m mailing in my vote for Biden.  You, Donny, nobody can stop me.
I dont think youre the guy who decides where the black vote, or any vote for that matter goes although biden is an idiot he didn't actively hurt members of the black community in Seattle let alone across the rest of the country
Biden just told the truth 💯🤷🏾‍♂️
Joe Biden's breath smells like shoe leather. That is all.
THE VIOLENT RADICAL LEFT ARE TAKING OVER &amp; JOE BIDEN SIDES WITH THEM. IS...  via
Not a pandemic. The rest of world is moving on, all except U.S. Suspect after election it won’t be as contagious/prevalent. Of course, when Trump wins again there will sure to be an uptick in cases. It’s how the dems work and  won’t get his spot in Biden admin
They'll just use what-about-ism and bring up Hunter Biden or Chelsea Clinton.
A look into Joe Biden's America
Really? Do you think God wants abortions? Or how about a return to the Obama/Biden hatred for Israel?
Here is your America under Joe Biden. Criminals will flourish
No doubt about it. A Catholic Priest said in his sermon last week that one party stands for God. One does not. Democrats like Joe Biden "call themselves Catholic" he said, but they stand with the atheist movement of Antifa and BLM. All Christians must vote Republican.
No question about Biden and racism. He backed both Obama &amp; Holder as they desperately tried to divide our nation.
Well, I mean, any day that Biden would announce its would be possible that Trump would do or say something stupid.
Hillary was hated and a polarizing figure. Joe Biden is not.  Plus, Donald Trump's actions as president are no longer just theoretical.  It is that simple as that.
Biden was never worthy of anyone's vote!
Who wrote the clarification for ‘can’t put a logical sentence together’ for bunker boy Biden? It’s so apparent when you read what he initially said. What a joke, and there are people out there who’ll defend his actions and support him. Can’t fix stupid
Biden Stepped in it!  Monolithic Blacks v Hispanics!  What a Choice for President! Two Old White guys, without a Clue, nor care about the plight of POC, Woman, or the Future of this Nation!  One Must Go; One I Don't Know!
What does the stock market do when Biden is elected in months?
I do not understand Biden's family standing by and watching Joe make a fool out of himself. It is sad.
Biden is the harbinger of mass incarceration. Millennials/Gen Z lived experienced it in a way the older generations (you) didn't. We're not with you and you'll need us to be if you want Biden to win so.. yall better do more than punch down.
Trump or Biden, union or not, useless people like you will be sitting at home collecting UBI in the next few years wondering if it was the robots or China who took your job. Either one will probably do it better.
I trust Michael obama more than joe biden
Sorry that’s Biden’s song now
Like I said you can search it but there’s already been documented depositions and filed legal documents showing that Obama knew and orchestrated it with Biden. When I’m done working I can pull it and send it or ask  he saves them lol
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is expected to name his running mate in the next two weeks.
That should be Biden’s slogan “I can hurt God”
Biden Interview Gets Worse, With A Question About How He’s Going To Deal With China  #realDonaldTrump via
Joe Biden is a racist. Pass it on
So Biden is pro life now? You’ve got a scoop!
Trump said Biden ‘hurt God.’ Biden has spent his life drawing from his Catholic faith.
"[Joe Biden] is following the radical left agenda," accused President Trump during a speech in Ohio.  "Take away your guns, destroy your Second Amendment, no religion, no anything, hurt the Bible, hurt God. He’s against God. He’s against guns."
Joe Biden will give God a wet willie. Joe Biden will reply with eyeroll gifs to God's Facebook posts. Joe Biden will put cantaloupe in God's fruit salad even though he knows God doesn't like it.
Mine is fro yo
Joe Biden is far more worthy of the black vote that is Donald Trump, our racist-in-chief.
No one might not be able to convince you about Trump, But Biden shows racism in this clip
Love how Biden’s camp is scared to debate
People hate Trump so much, that this idiot Biden can say anything and they think its ok. Has anyone come to the realization that Biden is senile for God sake!!!! At least evaluate your own candidate before voting.
Never once have I told you, or got mad at you 4 who you choose to vote for or support. I don't have the right to. Your vote is your choice and belongs to you. Not about to act like an 8 year old child towards you, because you choose to vote for Biden. I demand the same in return.
Blacks vote in near lockstep.  What he said is correct.  The black community is owned by Democrats.  They do what they're told when they're told by Dems. I take more offense to the fact that we can't even muster a word of criticism against Biden within the community.
Hes a distraction the purpose of which is to leech votes from Biden
Just released,  #Joe #Biden's new #campaign #logo...
Forget Trump’s taxes. I want Obama, Clinton, Biden and Pelosi taxes first.
Neither Biden, not many others, are in favor of abortion. He’s personally opposed to abortion, but pro-choice, pro-Constitution (as in separation of church and state) and pro-Christian doctrine (as in judge not lest ye be judged)
Not seeing very many Trump signs in the Pittsburgh, PA area....there are more Biden signs.  Did see a "Hillary for Jail" bumper sticker on a pickup truck recently 🙄. You are correct though....#Cult45 will turn out.
CHURCH and state is about RELIGION. Biden’s statement is about his FAITH. Faith is not religion. One can believe in a Higher Power without having religion.
This situation is so disturbing because mental illness is serious. Republicans using him to take votes away from Biden is shameful. It’s hard to control someone who suffers from Bipolar and goes off of their meds constantly.  This can’t be legal under these conditions
US election poll reveals more than two thirds of Brits want Joe Biden to beat Donald Trump - but many don't think he will
Have your say: Who will win the US presidential election?
bernie, the socialist activist with the most racially diverse base and record-breaking donations and campaign turnout, is actually the evil racist misogynistic demon. biden, however, is "politically black"
It was awesome!
biden gets away with it because the bourgeois class makes the rules, and are above the rules. the "we can't have an old white guy" liberal rule somehow only really worked against the anti-capitalist candidate
Biden reminds me of Mayor Adam West from Family Guy. This is not a good thing.  #weareDOOMED
Biden’s slogan would 100% be “It’s hip to be square, Jack!”
Only Biden voters are black
Whoa, who do you think you are threatening to hurt God like that? Joe Biden?
Joshua, thank you so much for tweeting that out! Biden has morals.  Pray he wins.🙏🙏🙏🌊🌊💙💙
And people claim Biden is the one with dimensia lmao this sounds like me giving a speech in high school
BREAKING: In a surprising move, Joe Biden has tapped blue eyed soul singer, Huey Lewis, from the sensational 80s band “Huey Lewis and the News” for VP
I like how between her &amp; Biden if anyone questions them they get flustered and mad and totally unable to answer the question.
Debate could be great, Trump might end up doing a Tik Tok dance with Biden droning on about his favorite cars in the 60’s or something.
Tbh when I saw this on a story, I was ready to break loose and raise hell, but then I heard their harmonies at the end...😡😑  Straight up where is the Biden equivalent?   Caveat: I am allowed to post music with messaging I dont believe in. Tryna pop that bubble, feel me?
bernie and socialism were slandered for years as class reductionist white bros who do literal violence to women and people of color (erasing all the socialist women and POC). it was all a humongous scam and served to give us hillary as nominee, trump as president, and now biden
And just to clarify recent (on the tarmac yesterday) rhetoric, even without the  Joe Biden is not going to come and take your guns.
Oh there will be plenty to strike under a biden admin
Trump really went off the rails on Joe Biden yesterday. Where does he come up with things such as, “Biden hates God”? Came out of nowhere after he warned ppl that Biden would immediately take their guns. He sounds and looks half-crazed.
Biden doesn’t know what day it is.  And the only reason he would have no inditements is because they would cover up as they always have.  He should be in jail.
This ☝️ , under the Biden administration we need to rapidly mobilize and protest, support and phonebank progressives, counter leftist opposition and make the bootlickers fuck around and find out
Both candidates suck...but people need the debates. We’ve gotta see what Biden has or doesn’t have. He should be rearing to go to prove he’s ready.
Let’s do a side by side comparison of Trump &amp; Biden regarding physical health, cognitive ability &amp; work ethic. My money is on the “Orange Man”.
A young lady I know wrote:  Any vote not for Biden is one for Trump.   Write-Ins, Kanye’s and not voting at all = Trump votes.
Joe Biden’s statement on  Faith in response to Trump’s comments yesterday.  This is what Presidential sounds like in case you’ve forgotten.
We need  for Biden too.
Twitter is running cover for Joe Biden's racism.  No surprise.
That is what the left is against. And now Biden is their puppet. Truth can be painful. That’s when truth is most important.
What, exactly, is Biden "leading"?
I love the way you have ruined lives and become a DICTATOR. You and Mrs Doubtfire dont care about lives, you care for what Biden will give you if he is elected.
I’d walk across a mile of LEGO’s barefoot to vote for Biden!
If  was leading in the polls...
😂😂😂😂😂 You don’t see how this idiot is being played by trump and his cabal? He’s only on the ballots to take votes away from Biden. Fools!
nbd just the casual evil of the biden campaign bringing on this repulsive death squad-endorsing ghoul. i'm part nicaraguan, i have family there and have visited multiple times. this is doing the opposite of "revving up" my latino vote

Once in a blue moon, when all the stars line up, Joe Biden makes a really good point. Man it doesn’t happen often enough, though.
Your narrative is a simple-minded one that has been programmed into you with lies. It's really sad that people fall for this stuff.
the fact that all you republican ghouls are cool with Biden, tells everyone all they need to know about Biden.
😂😂😂 have you not seen Trump in the past several months.  Yikes.  🤦🤦 The blinders on people from the media they consume is sad. Trump has to actually alter Biden pictures.
Biden calls Trump's 'hurt God' attack 'shameful'
So. Joe Biden is not worth saving. Didnt you see his interview with the  He totally disrespected your own people. So either he's battling dementia or he's simply unfit to lead. Pick your poison, but it's outrageous you haven't said anything about it.
How the hell do you make any sense of  China policy? He’s going to give them everything and expect them to play by the rules. His answer was horrible!
For followers of CNN, MSNBC, are you watching ‘listening’ from his own Biden mouth, words. Is this disparaging the ‘black community’?  If you don’t think so then the phrase applies, “you can’t fix stupid.”
Joe Biden spends three tweets attempting to “clarify” his offensive comments earlier - comments that you may have missed if you’re an MSNBC viewer (covered zero times on TV) or CNN viewer (covered 1 time) or CNN reader (no article on the website)...
The Biden handlers really picked a song for the Corvette ad that sounds like music dying just a guy barely pulling off plucking the open E string out of a blown out bedroom mini amp
Has CNN, MSNBC shared this to all of their followers especially those of color? Might be wrong but I’ve not seen it. Asking a black reporter if he’s taken a cocaine test &amp; a junkie when reporter asked of Biden’s cognitive test. What an insult to blacks.
Ana Navarro? Where’s Chuck Rocha???
And Thighland...daahh. And he calls Joe Biden sleepy joe...pot calling the kettle black
Trump is not going to win Texas by 5% if Ted Cruz only won 2 years ago by 2.6%. Trump is hated by Texans more than Cruz, and Texas has only been getting bluer since the 2018 election. I predict a Biden win in Texas of around 3%, barring an "October surprise" or surprise scandal.
Uh...speak for yourself. Mark my words: Biden will win Texas. I predict a result of roughly 50-47 Biden. Trump being +5 in Texas makes absolutely no sense, given that Beto O'Rourke only lost by 2.6. Texas has NOT being getting redder over the past 2 years; very much the opposite.
Sorry buddy, Biden only gets interviewed by REAL JOURNALISTS!! Not a HACK like harris..
you’re making Biden sound great to me when you say he’s against god and whatever your kind of energy is (I’m assuming coal)
Interesting that the #metoo movement was against Trump...and so is Biden. The country was in full lockdown on the date of the empty courtyard. It's called thinking. You should try it before commenting. Engage brain first...unless you don't have one.
Between voter suppression and machine hacks, that's a very tough state for Biden to win. Ditto TX and GA.
Biden could be in a permanent vegetative state..... and he'd still be more coherent than Trump.  As long as you support Trump, you can't make an effective argument about anyone else's "cognitive decline".
Wouldn't it be hilarious if West got more votes than Trump, but lost to Biden? I think they are expecting a bit much with West as a candidate. Thinking anyone will support West is an insult to their intelligence.
Your TDS is incurable! Enjoy your tax hikes and the destruction of your retirement accounts under Biden. Bye!
biden: “black people are the same with notable exceptions”  media: “joe clarified his comments on african americans”  trump: “thighland”  media: “our president can’t even expesss simple words! he’s incompetent and shows signs of xenophobia? more at 4”
You worship snake dancer evangelists . Joe Biden is a practicing Catholic.
Funny when joe Biden came to Lancaster he was greeted with about 10 biden supporters.. and hundreds of TRUMP supporters were around them .. he must of felt like a fool 🤡 TRUMP SUPPORTERS IN 2020 have doubled since 2016 ... I hope the dems become extinct after this election!
NRA members just need to vote him out. Let’s talk about the billions the Biden family got from Ukraine.
another reason for open boarders and no wall so they make the latino vote more important then the black vote smh
Kanye West indicates he is running for president to siphon votes from Joe Biden
We LOVE you, President Trump! You’re always real and honest. So refreshing. You’re a breath of fresh air, unlike stale #PhonyJoe   (Feel free to use that new nickname for Biden:)
I don’t really care for him, I’d vote for anyone over trump but he puts his foot in his mouth a lot.  I know I wanted Kamala to win the presidential race but I just wish there were better options than Biden.
Joe Biden is THE most racist presidential candidate in American history
Joe Biden is THE most racist politician in American political history.
Trump was impeached.   Biden is stupid.  Congress found that impeaching Trump was never warranted.  Biden is still stupid.  Now, lets see if Karin can learn.  I am not optimistic.
These statements should make him ineligible to run based solely ob character. He is not if "good character" to represent our country.
So the actual Joe Biden will say things then some other people are going to come on twitter and “clarify” *cough* it for us dumb folk. Just a reality that’s a little getting used to but we’ll get used to it
Joe Biden walked back his racist remarks, not remembering that he spoke.
Somebody ask Joe Biden to rank the races
My first job was in a nursing home and I watched my pappy go through it for seven years.  I take care of hubby's mom and grandma now. Grandma is slipping into Alzheimer's.  I don't like Biden. But this is really... cruel. Him being paraded around when he needs medical care.
The movie the Candidate with Will Farrell and Zack Galifinankis also seemed far fetched   And Trump said Biden “hates god” and Biden has no idea what he ever says   How long before a baby is punched ?
How is Joe Biden the fucking nominee? I don’t hate the guy, but fuck. If Trump wins, it’s because Democrats are stupid as fuck. And also republicans have lost their moral compasses.
Joe Biden sniffs children... all people do is relax. Watching their hypnotic screens. People need to recognize  is not a hero. NOT being trump is not a reason to be prez. Why are “liberals” so quick to defend joe... media brainwash?
I bet tons of these “Never Trumpers” still decide to vote for him at the last minute no matter who Biden picks... and the Dems will have lost a significant portion of progressive/independent support by trying to cater to these far right imbeciles...
You think the virus is going to mysteriously disappear, when Biden is president? The media won’t cover it. But it will still be here. And white liberals will rush to get the vaccine. Which IMO, is dumb as fvck. Taking a rushed vaccine? I’d rather wear a mask for another year
Hillary outspent trump. And true money shouldn’t be in politics. But if that’s the case Biden wouldn’t have made it to Iowa without billionaires
I hope his staff is smart enough to be working on a decent deepfake Biden to govern us for the next four years
"put that on everything" ~ Joe Biden
Joe "God Puncher" Biden sounds like a badass president to me
Biden picking Rice is because he wants that same simpatico he had with Obama. I don’t think he’d have as much with Harris-though she’s still my first choice.
I'm voting for Biden even if his VP choice is Barron's pet rock.
Retweet the hell out of this.  Biden has been a racist his entire life.
Trump says Biden is 'against God'  via  So god is for guns?? He doesn’t even make sense??

I mean, seriously, as a country the best we have are Trump and Biden? That’s more embarrassing than anything either of these knuckleheads are doing.  #Decision2020
I see . . . and then you formed Nuestro PAC, to focus on Latino outreach. And because Joe Biden selected Ana Navarro to do that instead of you, you're now upset.  I get it. You don't actually care about policies.
i remember back in like january saying to friends like, oh, biden will never get it, and i don't want him to, but i'm morbidly curious to see two rot brained old guys yell at each other for two hours. and then the finger on the monkey's paw curled
Wait, didn't you join that group of Bernie campaign leaders who are trying you shove Joe Biden down out throats? "A Future To Believe In," right? Now called "America's Promise"?  Do you actually care about anything specific, or only about things you get paid to care about?
So Joe Biden says one questionable thing and everyone's like "he's crazy and shouldn't be president" like Trump doesn't exist or something
3) Joe Biden takes a cognitive test.  The American public deserves to know.
Biden is literally a fucking moron
Biden seems the least likely to rage push "the button" of the three, just my opinion though I guess. You are right they are all nuts, senile or both though.

For Trump, the Ohio trip was kicking off a long weekend of fundraising that comes as Biden has chipped away at Trump’s financial advantage with the race entering its final three months.
It’s obvious.   And it’s sad.   The only reason Joe Biden will get the nomination is because the National Democratic elites had to find a way to stop
Surprisingly I was in a really small rural town in Ohio and saw 3 Biden yard signs compared to 1 trump. I was so surprised.
Hey, #VoteBlueNoMatterWho crowd! Tell me again about how getting rid of Trump is the biggest priority, and *then* we can focus on moving Joe Biden to the left!
This would be "hard to watch" if Biden were a friend or relative of mine. He is neither; he is a loaded weapon aimed at me by a dangerous clique.
We are heading for disaster if Joe Biden is elected.... Conservatives to include the ones who have never voted before need to show up at the voting booths in NOV! No Excuses! We are looking Evil dead in its face with the Democratic Party...
Joe Biden’s an Irish Catholic. I’m pretty sure he doesn’t plan to hurt God.
Seriously, Joe Biden has freaking  dimentia. He couldn’t fix anything because he’d forget what he’s working on. It’s seriously sad that he’s the Democrats candidate,  was at least a contender that wanted to spur entrepreneurship and have fintechs pay us for our data.
I swear to GOD. First white liberals say, “Biden said nothing wrong.” And yet it’s the same white liberals accepting his apology. WTF. If Biden asked liberals to eat shit, telling them it was pudding, they’d eat it up with a smile on their faces. #DumbLiberals  #RacistJoe
Did Trump just unintentionally give most of the Gen Z and gamer votes to Biden?  It sounds like Trump just unintentionally gave most of the Gen Z and gamer votes to Biden. 🤔🤔🤔
honestly idk if there's a clear answer for trump v biden and so im just gonna vote third party and let the chips fall where they may

Typed someone who is not joe Biden

I don't even particularly like Biden either just pointing out the logic.
Does he mean all the black people on the continent of Africa all think the same?  Is this what Joe Biden believes?  Is this the best Democrats can do with all their diversification preaching all the time?
i worry that a biden admin stalls out progress left because many people's imaginations begin and end at electing democratic presidents, and biden is no progressive. he'll make many trump crises bipartisan failures (economy, covid) and pave the way for competent fascist in 2024
depends on your metrics for "harm", i think a biden administration lulls to sleep many liberals who right now are active and agitated about important issues, while keeping the right energized - it's something we saw with obama. biden is arguably more of an FP hawk than trump too
A Biden/Rice ticket is so damn uninspiring. It makes perfect sense that the  would choose such a team. It’s a neoliberal wet dream. 🤮   #NothingWillFundamentallyChange
Wait did Trump say Catholics are not religious? Is it 1960 and people are afraid Biden is going to be taking orders from the Pope?

Biden could say he hates black people and has spent the past 40 years molesting children, and he’d still get 49% of the vote
Fellow Pittsburgh area here and unfortunately there are tons of Trump signs in the towns outside. I haven’t been into the city since Covid started, but in my town 15 miles out there are several, 2 on my block. I’ve yet to see a single Biden anything around here...
Let's see.. Obama/Biden 11.5 million jobs created, ended Great Recession, Started longest streak of economic and job growth in history.  Putin/Trump  8 million jobs lost in 4 years, created another Great Recession, ended the longest streak of economic and job growth he inherited.
Please do not vote for joe Biden or Donald trump as a joke. You are taking votes away from Kanye west
A Republican for Biden is a useful idiot
is this the most you're going to do after that insanely disrespect Joe Biden interview? You retweet this drivel without any accountability?
Joe Biden to god (apparently.)
So, if Trump was sent by god, and Biden can hurt god, that should mean Biden is more powerful than trump.
PRESIDENT TRUMP YOU RUN A 50% CHANCE OF LOSING THE ELECTION BECAUSE DEMOCRATS USING THIS TIK TOK APP TO PUNCH THEIR BIDEN CANDIDATE. THEY DIVERTING FROM TWITTER, FACEBOOK, AND USING PLACIER AND TIK TOK.  THIS IS A GREAT TIP FOR YOU SIR. BEST OF LUCK MAGA 2020 TRUMP!
One thing I really respect about Biden is even though he misspeaks and says dumb shit ALOT, he’s willing to man up and admit his mistakes. Says a lot about the man’s character.
Biden has a stutter. It’s well documented. Yes he says stupid shit. But trump literally said Yo-Semite. Like wtf.
then trump will call him "brundlefly biden" for the rest of the campaign but loses his momentum after loosing a pushup contest a week later. we all die of covid in October
Trump crushed the debates in 2016.  Biden might have two working brain cells.  Trump isn't worried about debating Biden.
🤣😂🤣 u serious? Joe Biden is trash. 🤡🌎
personally i would believe the things from joe biden's twitter account, which he definitely runs and comes up with posts for, as opposed to the words out of his mouth, which he clearly cannot be held responsible for

if you two broke from your party and ran together you would be unstoppable.  Atleast your put the broken shit out there. We need leaders who fix problems not add to them Trump and Biden both suck. And we don't need the Democrat Pedo empire running shit.
I’m starting to think this guy just regularly Ctrl + C someone’s sharp comment on Trump and Ctrl + V Biden’s name over it..because his remarks always fit Trump perfectly😅
You're watching Joe Biden right???? 😂😂😂 YOU'VE GOT TO BE JOKING
Can you show the video clip of ‘bunker boy Biden’ this morning &amp; his racist remark to the black interviewer this morning? While at it what he compared blacks to Hispanics. AGAIN, racist! Oh we can’t do that, but many blacks are getting wise to this RACIST!
That is a gross mischaracterization of how badly Biden disrespects Black Americans every time he is asked a question. He's a racist. They're not gaffes. That's what's in that man's soul coming out. And I really hate how so-called Black media keep wiping his ass about it
Hey guess what don don you held the Bible upside down the whole world is laughing at you please do not make yourself look like an ass anymore trust me do not challenge Joe Biden and his Christianity because you're going to lose your angelicals.
Yes- the senile monster will lose. And on January 20th, we inaugurate Biden.
Biden also said that officers should shoot blacks in the legs instead of kill shots.... and when a black girl asked, “what advice would you give me if I was your daughter?” He instinctually said “well you wouldn’t be my daughter”  We need more diverse perspectives in the world.
Jim, let’s talk about ‘bunker boy Biden’ since you won’t. Didn’t he once again criticize blacks again this morning, again? How many times must bunker boy slam blacks before you and your Fake station expose this RACIST? Oh not you guys
Yes. I worked my ASS off so Biden could defeat Sanders, &amp; Dems could appeal to moderate GOP &amp; independent voters. If Rice is chosen over Harris, I'd feel as if all of my work was for nothing. Without even getting into all the problems w/Rice, it would kill the unifying message.
Meanwhile catching up on the politics of the day, Biden will 'hurt God'?!?! Some levels of dumbfuckery pushed out there are just beyond any logical human being.
If fools like Chevy think Black people are in better hands with  despite his racist past &amp; current racist statements then Johnson should NOT be an alderman anywhere.
I want to believe your father would not have thought twice about voting for Joe Biden.  Never Trump will be never Republican until Republicans take back their party. Doesn’t look like it’s gonna happen this year.
Not even Bernie Sanders himself brought progressives to the polls. Hence why Biden is the nominee.
He is joking, because he thinks demented racist Biden is better than the “racist” trump
Omg, Joe Biden will follow me, that's beyond my wildest dreams!
Yall. Joe Biden said he didnt mean to let the racism show in his soul.
I don't think we'll be on the road to recovery until Biden takes office. Until then, we're in trouble.
Commission rejects President Trump's push to add debate against Biden
Biden has dementia and everyone knows it! He’s also a racist!
Pretty sure I saw the guy on the right in a PA attack ad against Biden.
BIDEN WAS REFERRING TO DON LEMON.  Don Lemon confused a elephant with a lion when talking about the test.
I fucking called it. Maybe more of my friends will start listening to me now that more and more shit I have claimed has come true. Kanye gives 0 fucks about winning. They just don't want Trump to lose....the question here is why?
Thirsty interview on  but you failed to mention  RACIST comparison of AFRICAN AMERICANS vs latinos thought process. Don't be Stephen from Django!  WI Official Blasts Republicans for Working with Kanye to Steal Votes from Biden
I thought that Biden ad was kinda weak. The message was right but the delivery was as inoffensive as possible. Biden needs to make it very clear that the only way back to walking outside without a mask is a vote for Biden, which also has the benefit of being totally true...
Also, what’s your take on that Joe Biden comment today? No hashtags? No twitter blue checks or BLM folks talking about it constantly? Don’t you see the hypocrisy?
is becoming more unhinged. We are watching daily as his mental health declines. When the president says Biden is going to hurt God, hurt the Bible, and the pandemic will disappear, someone needs to seriously question his fitness to stay in office
Joe Biden 2020: Against God
Holy shit. 'Hurt God"? Joe Biden is metal af.
I think I'm going to watch the Cartoon Network until November so I don't have to watch endless Biden commercials. #tucker
trump planted this fucking idiot!!!!!
But didn’t Trump just say today that Biden would “hurt God”, that seems pretty strong and kinda spits in the face of the whole “Sleepy Joe” narrative.
‘Hell, no. I’m not resigning,’ says Virginia mayor after racist post regarding Biden | WTOP   Here’s conservative humor attempt again. Something a 12 yr old would think is funny
But you’re on the fence, depending on Biden’s choice of VP. 🧐
Hey  the only thing I can think is that you’re quarantined in your basement for the past month. There’s  a problem with Covid, the Senate is sitting on the House bill to extend relief, the President has no idea that Yosemite is a Park, and that Biden will hurt God.
Joe Biden blowing the lead of the century 🤦🏽‍♀️ Somebody shut his ass up
Joe Biden hurting "God" is the best thing I've ever heard about Joe Biden and while I would have voted for him anyway, I'm now slightly more enthusiastic to do so.
Biden puts a wall between religion and politics like he should, is all. Catholic politicians don’t need to try to end abortion or anything because they serve their constituents.
I’m glad you’re okay and have to give you credit for being so ill yet still finding the time to angry tweet at Bernie Sanders for not exiting race and his supporters for not falling in line to back Joe Biden because of non issues like everyone having healthcare during a pandemic.

The current president is far more mentally gone than Biden.
Please don't vote for Biden if you are American   #Biden
Even Joe Biden supports President Trump! sheesh
Cupp claims she will vote for Biden if he chooses Harris, but not if he chooses Rice, but gives no reasoning as to why, rendering it a useless opinion. Even if she had, her reasoning is absurd.
Be Honest - Did your choice for President make you cringe today? #Biden #BidenWarren2020 #Trump2020Landslide #TRUMP #MAGA2020 #USA #HurtGod #AfricanAmericans  #America #Vote2020 #COVID19 #Vote #Republicans #Democrats #President #MailInVoting #Fraud
Just grabbed this from a Republican friend who said.she's voting Biden.
I love how the media is like “Joe Biden said something stupid again” as if we don’t actively have a president with 0 experience who can’t pronounce Thailand &amp; is actively decimating our democracy/ human rights every single fucking day (this tweet was fueled by 🥃)
the twitter left nitpicks every Biden gaffe to rationalize not voting for him in November. We'll be keeping tabs on y'all
according to joe biden, i think the same as all black folks in america. apparently he thinks black people have no diversity of thought. oh wait, but i guess that doesn’t apply to me because i’m voting for trump. so, “i ain’t black”.
"If you look at the full video and transcript, it's clear that VP Biden was referring to diversity of attitudes among Latinos from different Latin American countries. The video that is circulating is conveniently cut to make this about racial diversity" ---

Can we just admit that Trump saying Biden wants to hurt God is that is actually a mainstream conservative view about everyone on the left.
If Biden wins I’ll be so shocked!!
Just today in Ohio,  said Joe Biden was "against God and against the Bible. He will hurt the Bible, hurt God, hurt EVERYTHING!!" This man couldn't be more off the rails, let alone DESPERATE! VOTE HIM OUT!!  #Biden2020 #VoteBlue #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
Come on man!  Look fat, if Biden had brain aneurisms it doesn’t mean his mental fill...err, his mental fill...err..his mental fitness is compromised.
Wow you dont at all? Thats surprising. I do have to admit, thats a huge advabtage to being in the military. I literally served with people from all parts of the country. Yeah i did hear that. My interpretation was he's (Biden) going to hurt christianity as a whole.
Isn’t Whitlock saying Biden is right?
How can Joe Biden have 90% of the African American vote when he talks down to them all the time?
I mean regardless of what you think about Trump, Biden, or religion ... come the fuck on, here.
This ☝🏻for every time someone says Biden is a little “off.”
I don't think Biden is evil
Awful yet again from Joe Biden. Why is it ok to let the rich and powerful off the hook but not the rest of us??
Biden is evil?
Are you shielding Biden by not airing his interview with the  ?
I encourage every senior to at least read Biden’s plans for when he becomes president. Know the issues, know the truth. Our grandchildren on counting on us to do the right thing!
I guess Biden has gone full John Lennon... no religion...
. if your dude is showing up on the ballot just to siphon votes from Biden, there's no explanation or apology that's going to cover what's going to happen to millions of people in this country.  Be a mom, a wife, and the intelligent woman you are and step up.
Don't really think  is in any position to bad mouth Joe Biden. There's NO comparison between the two of them. Biden has a wealth of political experience and he's playing with a full deck!
Right now it means: “I’m voting for a Biden”..
⁦ ⁦ ⁦ ⁦ ⁦ ⁦ I AGREE!
She's depressed because she and her husband are being exposed-- especially with Biden. Who knew they were covering for him as well all this time. WTF?
We're riding with Biden👍✔🇺🇸
I saw my first biden flag on the side of a highway. I've seen way more trump flags than biden.
"the biden operatives aren't hiding the truth of his brain decay well enough, fire them"
If Joe Biden is going to give his acceptance speech in his home state of Delaware, then trump should give his acceptance speech in Florida and not at the White House. Who agrees with me? #JoeBiden
Biden will ‘Hurt God’ but that sumbitch has read the Good Book &amp; practices it’s teachings. Meanwhile inside dumbass’s head
If he’s a Trump supporter he’d be running to siphon minority votes from Biden
If Biden is elected the trees will no longer turn pretty colors in the fall.
I wasn't aware of Joe Biden making such a comparison.
Howdy I'm racist Joe Biden
Really? Because I benefited from the tax cuts (and I’m middle class), and my local businesses benefited from regulatory cuts. My son is working non-stop because of Trump’s energy policies and job creation. Go blow smoke up somebody else’s butt. Biden will raise taxes.
And some are out of candidate Biden's mouth..
Imagine Biden is so powerful he could hurt God! How many times a day do you think trumps campaign managers throw their hands up in the air over the stupid things he says!
You Republicans need to recall Wolf or #ImpeachTomWolf .... Wolf's Tyranny has gone on way to long. This was to be a 2 week shut down Period. Wolf is taking this to next year. He's holding out to see if Biden wins to save his butt. Wolf was promised Federal money from Biden.
What a train wreck a debate will be between Biden and Trump. One has no brain and the other seems to have lost his.
That actually sounds kinda great.  Biden it is! #25thAmendmentNow
This is the problem w/ journalism for exclusives/virality's sake. Forbes scored an intervivew (by text) w/  who says literally nothing of factual or contextual value. At this point, talking to Kanye can't be expected to lend context to...Kanye
Almost as bad as Biden's statement today claiming the Black community isn't diverse. Time to put him back in the basement?
Trump, the rascist-in-chief who called for the death penalty for the Central Park Five long before they were exonerated, and whose family was fined for refusing to rent to black people, can’t hold a candle to Biden’s decades long fight for racial equality.
"Biden brigade"/"KHive."  It was to be expected that after this long in quarantine, madness would set in.
Biden said Obama was clean and well spoken. With zero sarcasm. Catch up champ Joe is a racist.
Is Biden really against God?
Honestly that sounds like the every media outlet/blue check on twitter. All they do is insult, blame, put down, lie, brag and deflect...I asked how he’s divisive, like an example? Joe Biden just said today “African American community isn’t diverse” imagine Trump saying that.
The funny thing? Despite Biden's lead, there are some who don't think he will be the nominee for the Democrats.
Aren’t you concerned about Biden’s senility, dementia, and extreme racism? Not to mention his insanity.
has no religion and for him to imply that Biden has none is just laughable, Biden would never have kids locked in cages, there certainly wouldn't be almost 160,000 people dead, Biden didn't pay off porn stars and cheat on his wife right after she had a baby.
Oxygen Thief #Nevertrump  is on  comparing dementia victim and Chinese Communist Party agent Joe Biden to  This is why it's the first time in 3 months I've watched this Paul Ryan bullshit.
So Biden and citi bank will choose who will be president? Hard pass. You might support oligarchy, but I don’t.
I don’t know.. Joe Biden would be pretty badass if he could hurt God
Does Biden’s public health insurance option raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000 a year?
#Democrats chose radical #Biden. You do the math.
would rather Joe Biden continue to show genuine concern for ALL the people by holding virtual rallies&amp; debates accessible to all by network transmission
Maybe Biden is the best candidate
Does it mean Never Biden?
Prediction: Trump is trying to ditch the debates and all this bluster about debates from his camp is their attempt to blame Biden when Trump opts out of the presidential debates.
Trump, two weeks from now: “Remember that time Joe Biden shit himself on stage?” *audibly shits himself on stage*  “That would be, like, very embarrassing.”  **Maskless crowd goes nuts as shit runs down his leg and onto the stage.**
Joe “Christ Puncher” Biden.
yo biden sounds based
Joe Biden can HURT GOD? Holy shit!  Can he like, twist God's arm until God fixes the pandemic (and ends poverty, just for good measure)? If so, I think I can probably convince some people to vote Biden.
the NYT is complicit through its iron defense of the status quo during a decade of growing populism. the NYT has power to set mainstream narratives, and it uses that power to defend capitalism and the bourgeoisie's interests. that's how we got to trump, and now trump v biden.
The idea that Biden will lose votes over his VP pick is ridiculous. Like all these people will jump ship and vote Trump. 😂
Biden’s ad just complained about cutting school funding if they do not reopen. My question is, why would the schools need the money if they do not open? It’s not a difficult concept.
He has no idea that if Jesus was a registered voter he'd vote for Biden! Boy, would that chap his ass! Then he'd be making statements on how Jesus' ratings were tanking and that no one likes him anymore. LMAO 🤣
Trump really said “He can hurt God” Joe Biden powerful as hell
Biden is the Neal Brennan of politics
So US Evangelicals think Joe Biden is "against God" because he's Catholic but were willing to vote for practicing LDS/Mormon Mitt Romney in 2012?!  Conversations about right-wing radicalization are so necessary in the times we live in.
Says the man who has NO religious connection about Biden who is a life-long Catholic.🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
Trump’s remarks stood out and they signaled how contentious the campaign may get over the coming months.
Next call I get im recording for my own amusement. Conversely here’s how the Biden campaign has been reaching out.   And others have had similar interactions. Seems like they have real people on the ground who care about their country more than their party.
I’ve never seen a Biden sticker at all...not on a car, not in a yard, not in a window. Western PA...unfortunately I see wayyyy too many Trump signs 🤮
Sure !! Can a journalist ask Biden wheres hunter??
Plus Biden's probably got some genuine support in PA and MI, working class Joe etc. etc., so that's two states closer to wining.
Oh for the love of pete, what leftist are on the national ballot? Joe Biden is about as moderate as you get. You are buying into the misinformation brought to you by trump and hostile actors.
Biden would basically have to completely bomb his candidacy (e.g., awful debates, scandals, etc.) or have some kind of "October surprise" for him to lose Texas this year. News happens fast, but if the election were held today, Biden would win the state.
Not from anyone I know.  Biden doesn’t even know where he is.
I don't think voter suppression will be enough for the GOP this time, as Biden will win TX by ~3 pts. If Hawley &amp; Cotton are the GOP's future, then they're toast. Texas suburbanites, who make up the most of the state's voters, are anti-Trump. They want folks like Bush &amp; Romney.
Trump may not know that Joe Biden is Catholic. Seriously. I am a Catholic, and an aging one, and I can’t remember my last brush with anti-Catholic bigotry.
Interesting. I’m Catholic and I didn’t know that.   But maybe we could televise a live Bible Bowl between Trump and Biden to see who knows more about the Bible.   Then a Spelling Bee.  Then a 100 yard dash.
Good point Basement Biden.
Barack Obama he's different He's clean and neat He's not like the rest of them  Who said this Joe Biden or Donald Trump?
I totally blew the secret! I thought October was when Biden was supposed to hurt all the ghosts, ghouls, and goblins! I can't get my shit straight. 🙄
Ask trump how many times he has been to church over the past 4-5 years, then ask Biden! God wouldn’t give trump the time of day!
He knows Joe Biden is too honorable a man to stoop to trumps level and fight about faith and religion, so he will continue to lie to the uneducated voters.
No, once again, parties like to cast their opponents as devils. So Trump makes a silly declaration like that. But, you may say Biden is a good Catholic and a man of God but I know a few parishes that would refuse to give him communion due to his pro-abortion stance.
And he says Biden is against guns too. Ummm...why does Trump seem so certain that God would be in favor of guns?
I still can’t believe all of the promising democratic candidates we had and we ended up with Biden 😂😂😂
recent polls have shown that Republican turnout will be lower than usual this year. A candidate like Romney gives conservative voters an option other than Trump. So, rather than staying home or reluctantly voting for Biden, they would have more incentive to vote for an actual
Biden, and may attempt to get a pardon from Pence on his way out the door.   At any rate, look at the possible benefit for the GOP in nominating someone else, like Romney. It would guarantee a Trump defeat, and it could very likely save them quite a few congressional seats, as
Mark my words — Biden will win Texas by ~3 points. See you on November 3.
I like how Trump keeps stumping on the "Biden is against God" &amp; "Biden is against guns". I'm pretty certain that, should he exist, God would be anti-gun.
Trump had no respect for your father or for you either. Vote Trump out. Change the US for the better by voting for Biden. He at least thought of your Dad.
Trump campaign ad features doctored images of Joe Biden 'in his basement, alone' - USA TODAY
If I know anything, it's that  just likes having a good time!
Catholic priest was correct to deny communion to Joe Biden — here's why
Can someone make a meme of Biden with God in a headlock?  Please????
Look man, if Biden is powerful enough to hurt God, we should all be terrified but we should also want someone with that kind of strength leading this country. Don’t you agree?  BTW I’m Buddhist &amp; this is the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard. And that’s saying a lot in Trump terms
Symone Sanders breaking her back to defend Joe Biden
I think it says a lot about 2020 that the single most effective campaign ad I’ve seen this year is one whose sole purpose appears to be to remind me how much Joe Biden loves ice cream.
Voting for both Biden and Trump make me uncomfortable. Like Nina turner said it’s either half a bowl of shit (Biden)or a full bowl of shit(Trump). I don’t want to eat shit.
I doubt he’ll do it as President.  Feminist pressure groups have swung Casey to the right side of the issue here in Pennsylvania, and I’m sure they’ll do the same with Biden.
You mean to say, you’ll still vote for Trump if you don’t like Biden’s VP pick? Even though ALL of them are more qualified than Trump? Doesn’t make sense. SMH.
Joe Biden may be a Catholic in name, but he represents zero Catholic values. And I pray that he one day returns to those ideals that we Catholics hold true.
Biden can't measure up to the task nor the whole Democrat party
Key question is surely how the left wing candidate managed to lose a primary to someone as weak as Biden. Yet the possibility that his ideas might not be that popular, or that his messaging turned voters off doesn’t even seem to have entered his supporters heads.
thigh land!  Your opening monologue was about Biden goofs.  Those who live in glass houses should not throw rocks!
Joe Biden is not that Awesome
I think you are grasping there. Both parties like to scare voters into voting for them. Every year Dems claim that Republicans will take away Social Security but it never happens. Even when the GOP has both the legislature and the White House. Biden was trying to scare Blacks
You said many stupid lying things over the years and now you said Biden 'will hurt God.' If you haven't hurt God no one has. You've locked kids in cages, you've lied about Covid, you've made fun of the disabled, you've cheated on your wives. I could go on and on.
He must be, biden says racist stuff all of the time! He answered it for you!    etc., etc. #bidenisaracist #racist #racism #TrumpLandslide2020  #joebiden
Are you kidding me with your lies about Biden not wanting to debate your daddy? Joe CANNOT WAIT to debate him! Your dad can't hold his own unless he has a teleprompter in front of him. Do us a favor and just go away along with all the Trumps in the WH on Jan 20th.
"Joe Biden can kick God's ass"  this message paid for by the campaign for Donald Trump
Obama did a campaign speech for Biden at a funeral!! Real classy!
Trump says Biden is against God sounds exactly what Satan would say( keep on digging that hole trump).
Well, at least they agree on something. 🤷‍♂️
Trump is now claiming that if Biden is elected, he will actually "hurt god". Little does Trump know, Biden's first stop is beating up Santa Claus before his Inauguration in January.
Trump just says stupid things and is just an all around asshole how he handles situations. Biden's actual mental health is something everyone should think about when voting for him. Because from Nov til Jan (if elected) things can turn south real quick when it comes to that stuff
Live at Madison Square Garden this Saturday: Boxing is back!  In a twelve round grudge match long in the making,  it's corporate cut-out and rambunctious mediocrity "Sleepy" Joe Biden vs The creator of all that is and will ever be The "Almighty" God. Tickets are limited. Act now.
Can he pass a Bible test? I bet Biden has been to church a thousand times more than Trump.
It's obvious that the Left and our tech overlords have zero confidence in Biden. 🤣
It sounds like something you’d holler out in a death metal song? (My husband listens to a lot of black/death metal. It’s pretty perky stuff. Wonder if we could get any of those guys to write Biden a sweet anthem?)
Wisconsin Official Blasts Republicans for Working with Kanye to Steal Votes from Biden
He really needs to stop making Biden sound metal
Weird how we aren’t going to vote for Biden either. You called us a cult, but aren’t following the leader of said cult. Weird how you dumb fvcks have been wrong #YouAintBlackBidenIt funny because they are still more intelligible than anything Biden would actually say.
Joe Biden could shoot me on 5th ave and I’d still vote for him. By absentee ballot, obviously.
Time will tell Geary. And no haven’t been sleeping at a Holiday inn express However most in my area are being used for the homeless so there’s been lots of visits to them for those of us on the front lines tending to them. Kick back in that easy chair like Biden and take a nap.
Tell me one politician that’s truthful all the time.  One lie is too much so all of them in my eyes are guilty.  If you don’t see both sides playing games then truly you have dementia like Biden.
I agree with this take. Biden would never do an interview like that. Trump is going to roast Biden in the debates if they don’t switch him out
JASON MILLER PLAYED ROLE OF CATHOLIC PRIEST IN 1973 MOVIE "THE EXORCIST" !  JASON MILLER GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE IN SCRANTON, PA. !!  FORMER VP OF USA JOE BIDEN WAS BORN IN SCRANTON, PA. 1942 !!!
Biden is Jewish Catholic Zionist Evangelical Yeshua Ha Mashicha 👾
Biden has been a republican with a d after his name for 50 years. Establishment dems are moderate republicans. I've seen Joes commercials. He's going to fix the problems he directly caused his whole career? Yeah right. We live in a fascist state. Have to take it back.
I’ve had my best years the past 2 years.  But I’d like to hear from someone who who’s things different then I.  I don’t share the same feelings of Biden as you do so I’m trying to understand why people would prefer a man with dementia leading the free world.
What’s Biden hiding????   Do a debate this month!!!!  STOP HIDING!  Senator what is being hiding from the American voters?
What’s Biden hiding????   Do a debate this month!!!!  STOP HIDING!
What’s Biden hiding????   Do a debate this month!!!!  STOP HIDING!
Damage Control Day for the Biden twitters. Hurry up, you better write more for them.
Really? Lol. As a guy who hates both.. I think I feel like a rocket scientist when I hear Joe Biden talk.
How do you feel when Biden speaks?
Joe Biden is not a racist, because Joe Biden was President Obama’s VP for 8 years!
trump is about as religious as he is articulate.   the only trick in his book is to project his issues into others.   “I’m a corrupt piece of shit so I’ll call Hillary crooked” “I’m a liar so I’ll call Ted a liar” “I’m a racist so I’ll call Biden a racist”  His insults=admissions
They’re using him to siphon off black voters from Biden...😢
Tell children the truth. The perpetually Dem-run big cities, with D mayors, D councils, D police officials have a serious problem with systemic racism they have never done anything about. Party of racism from slavery to today. Heck, Biden supported Robert Exalted Cyclops Byrd.
You really need to watch the CSPAN videos of Biden. He gets off on the power he has. He loves groping &amp; sniffing kids and knows he can get away with it. F-ing sick. Meanwhile, Trump said there are some women who love rich celebs and will let them do anything. Big difference.
"You ain't black, or diverse. Also, poor kids are as smart as white kids, and I don't know how to use the tweety thingamabobber."  - - Joe Biden, actually
Yes, and Trump was best buds with that Exalted Cyclops in the Senate. Oh wait, that was Biden who supported his segregationist legislation.
Comey is but one of MANY involved with those crimes. Obama should be in prison. And Biden. And Yates. And the FBI lovebirds. Etc.
Lol. The social media ninjas of Joe Biden. Retire in Peace Former VP Biden.
Dr. Biden, respectively, you are pushing a man that’s not 100%.  As a strong minded woman and a wife/mother.  How do you support your husband when all of us see his condition.  Do you not care about how he looks and how your family is viewed supporting this?  Very sad.
Senator why is VP Biden hiding!  Did you get out because you didn’t want to support his health issue?   His wife and family supports him to go through this.  He looks terrible.
He's misleading, as usual. Biden has said he doesn't want to take all guns away but doesn't see the need for the average person to own an AK47. I haven't done enough research into defunding the police, but from what I've seen so far, it does not shut them down.
still better then Biden and his cognitive decline.
I completely agree with Joe Biden! Joe Biden was Obama’s VP, so if Joe Biden were a racist, it would hace been exposed back then.
I forget, how many mistresses has Joe Biden had?!? I’ve lost count.
You can't blame just Biden voters-- he wasn't going to win the nomination until the Party stepped in and forced everyone else (excluding Sanders, who isn't "really" a Democrat) out... The problem is the Parties. They are like the mafia.
White privilege at its finest. This election is bigger than you and your beliefs. Its about saving this country. Take one for the team (America) and just vote for biden
Joe Biden said nothing wrong!
Yes. Biden again said some dumb shit.   This we know. 🙄  The difference between him &amp; Trump is Biden is open minded enough to receive correction and education. Change can come with an open mind.
Okay stop I'm already voting for Biden
If you listened to Mr. Biden, you would learn he doesn't want to take away all guns. If a person needs an AK47 in their neighborhood for protection,  it's time to move.
He's making Biden out to be an awful person. Don't worry Trump, even if the shit you're saying isn't lies, we've had practice dealing with horrible people in office over the past 4 years.
Well Obama wanted to put restrictions on guns but still supported the second amendment, Biden wants to put in a buy back program and if you don’t, you have to register them. The fear is in not registering every gun and magazine, him attempting to take your guns
Obama and Biden don’t have the same political stance on guns so why would you compare them?
the idea that Trump is so bad that Biden is a good option boggles my mind.  Folks, we have 2 bad options...  again.
you will not likely see anything embarrassing or concerning about Biden from other media outlets.
Everytime you think Biden has done something stupid just look back at Trumps past and he can match it
If you have no idea "what Biden stands for", you have not been paying attention. You can certainly wait to cast your vote, nothing is stopping you. But tens of millions of us are sending our mail-in ballots in on the first day they'll be accepted. We've seen enough.
What's wrong with  brain?
Is Biden trying to bring out the Kanye vote?
Ban Joesph Biden and save the USA
He departed Scranton at 3 yrs old and only comes back to suck votes, unfortunately the rag newspaper we have here Scranton Times Tribune is the little sister to The NY Times and back this loser. We don’t want or need biden in Scranton or the USA
I can't even imagine the uproar we'd experience from the media if Trump said this same exact statement. Or any of the other racist statements made by Joe. But since it's Biden... 🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗
Biden's very first campaign ad was an absolute lie about something Trump said-- a lie that every media organization admits was a lie but a LIE that Biden still repeats and stands by. So, please, lecture us some more about facts...
Yes it does, their entire party is “how it looks, not what will help our country” Biden is controlled by the extreme leftest in the party, he does this because he wants power, Pelosi does the same thing they both would “kill” the country to gain them power.
There is no other option, Biden’s history as a senator and VP is dismal . The entire DNC brags about murdering infants born/unborn, they care nothing about elder citizens but illigals give them everything. President Trump proved that he is great for the USA. 3 NOV 20 TRUMP
And he says Biden isn't capable.
Biden's mental ability? Should we "person, woman, man, camera, TV" this or just rewatch the  interview? Both show Trump's lack of mental ability.  Swan face scale to this post: #6
He doesn’t want the cameras to show thats not actually Joe Biden
2/ The complaint about the picture's usage is an example of your intellectual dishonesty unless you also decried Biden's LYING ad that jumpstarted his campaign.
1/2 It's called ADVERTISING! If Biden was alone in a basement when the photo was taken there would be no photo because there would have been no photographer.
I have absolutely no problem with what Joe Biden said.
MAKE AMERICA LAUGH AGAIN! Joe Biden Laughing uncontrollably on ABC over being imitated by Jason Sudeikis  via
I do not believe Biden and Trump’s campaigns are knocking on any doors this year, because of the pandemic.
Joe Biden is just a bunch of malarkey
Biden, sorry to say is not firing on all cylinders and this could be a bigger issue for all Americans. The grass isn’t always greener on the other side and there’s a lot of concern of who is truly going to run us should he be elected.
i went to college in new england and plan to move out in a year. ♥️ thanks for the advice! i’ll make sure my biden 2020 sign out front is nice and clean just for you ♥️
i’ve lived here my whole life and i promise i see plenty of Biden signs and support everywhere. we just don’t belong to a cult and mass buy his merch and wear it like it’s the only thing we own ♥️
Your governance is a click bait??? Hahaha..you should be ashamed. Peoples work, school, social well being and retirement are on the line and you play carnival barker? See senior citizens..you aren't tech people and Biden isn't interested in you.
He does realize Biden is catholic  doesn't he ?
That might be a dangerous pitfall.  Can only imagine how Trump, et al would turn that into "Biden is scared", "sleepy Joe"....etc.
To be fair... Biden hasn’t ever had these problems with stuttering on other campaigns. The man is slipping. Let’s be real here. Joe Biden has LOVED the sound of his own voice forever. I listened to him at a dinner yammer on for 2 hours once about 4 years ago. He ain’t the same!
trump campaign flailing in every direction!!  The harder they push, the better Joe Biden appears.  So keep at it.
Hypothetical- if Biden were on death row would his defense using last 2 weeks of media clips, save him from the long walk? Scary to think he's trying to run things- could deflect any legal/ ethical challenge with- he's sick. If needed.
I just saw kids running down the street with a Biden sign, pretty sure they stole it from someone’s yard.
Senator Bernie What is true reason why Biden won’t be going to Milwaukee?  The American Voters need to know why he’s hiding and what is truly being covered up.  This is BS and you know it.
Senator - why is VP Biden hiding???  Now he won’t go to Milwaukee- what is going on with him?  C19 is such an excuse to not do.  What do you know about this please do tell.  American Voters need to know is he’s stable enough to be considered for the highest role in our country.
The man gets a costume MAGA beanie and we was totally a Democrat. Its weird, how the majority of people are leaning towards Biden, but this guy, oh no, he sees the truth and voting Trump. Lmfao
Anyone who thinks otherwise has their head up their ass. Of course Biden is hiding!
Revolutionary Communist Party leader backs Biden -  -
Will do. I'll vote for Biden. And I'll do it by mail just to piss off you and your goose stepping minions.
Am amazing concession that the Dem nominee is not able to handle interviews.... But he can handle running thre country?  The open secret is that Biden won't be running the country, people will be running Biden.
Honestly, Trump could gain so much support by using an EO to set a rolling monthly stimulus payment to Americans in place of a partisan fight every 3months. Biden team would absolutely hate Trump doing the right thing lol.
The Greek-Turkish conflict is probably not high on Trump’s agenda. Having said this, I reiterate that regardless of who’s in charge, the result would be the same. Anything Biden might say is just to pay lip service and get some Greek-American votes and money.
You had 4 years to make it great again and you put us in a nightmare!!! You’re fired! It is what it is! Biden 2020
Different subject. WTF do you like Joe Biden??
Tara...the reality is Former VP Biden isn’t going to remember what happened back then let alone todays date.  If you truly have proof, you need to bring it to the table NOW for American Voters to see.
Then what's the point? The GOP is irredeemable b/c they'd vote for a racist idiot even if Biden signed a blood oath just to keep the chair warm for the next Repub?  I've read the Tweet 20 times, and I can see several things you might be getting at, but none make much sense.
Joe Basement Biden is afraid to leave his basement.
VP Biden - people are dying to see you debate .... this month!
VP Biden - it’s time to debate.  Stop hiding.
Compare it to Biden's interview with the non-Legacy journalists.  Oh, wait...
Have you met Biden? P.s. us backwoods Pocono people are so dumb that we don't let people crap on our sidewalks..get lost nut.
I just made it 7002!  Is there a door prize???
Maybe they’re afraid that is Biden that would not make any sense. The idea of a debate to be President of the United States is common sense.
You got it. Biden is a fool and being lead around by the radical democrats
It was terrible how they treated President Trump, it was also shameful how the media covered up for Obama and Biden so the people of the USA could not judge Obama/Biden on what they did that hurt the USA so much for the 8 terrible years. THE MEDIA is the true enemy anymore.
Axios interview. OMG.  I’m thanking you for allowing this eye popping interview to air. Biden needs to keep this on a loop!
He's saving that for Joe Biden! #TrumpHasNoPlan
Joe has a far more stable and far more consistent lead. He's also up in areas and demographics Clinton wasn't.  A lot can change before Election Day, but right now, Biden has it.
Why would Biden supporters go to a Trump rally? #TrumpIsLosing
Dude, my dream is for Biden to win, so Trump would then refuse to accept the results, saying it was 'rigged' and claiming 'voter fraud'.  This would continue until Inauguration Day, where Trump would still refuse, and have to be escorted out of the WH by the military.
Erase the name Biden.  Now add Trumps name .
Hey intern who handles the account for  You do realize not having your boss debate just confirms that you all know he'll get exposed, right? Muhammad Ali didn't become the Greatest by never stepping in the ring. #Biden #DebateTrump #COVID19
What a total douchebag. Biden has never said anything about debates. He’s agreed to 3. Trump want to delay Election Day. Such bad actors.
Because we know Trump blames Obama for everything from killing the dinosaurs to the sun blowing up, I'm hoping for at least 1 "Thanks Obama" from Biden. My life will be complete. #ThanksObama
Banana 🍌 you’re slipping away from what she’s saying.    She’s commenting on Biden’s cognitive ability or lack there of, not on Trumps fam. Let’s be honest Biden’s condition needs to be brought to greater light instead of hiding it from the American voters.
Yes pigs 🐖 are flying.  I agree with you Ed Krassenstein regarding debating.    I can’t wait for the debates either.   VP Biden has been sheltered &amp; doing all he can to stay out of the debate arena to avoid all uncontrollable questions/ discussions.  Get out there VP Biden.
Why would you see Biden supporters they don’t wanna come out and risk spreading the virus to see you
I'm not perfectly sure who the right pick for VP is.   He certainly has a great group to choose from.  I do know this however, no matter who Biden finally decides upon, WE MUST UNITE BEHIND THEM BOTH!!!!  No room for error in this campaign.  We have to show a UNITED front!!
Trump approval back to 51% and supporters 70% more enthusiastic than Biden’s
they are running out the clock with a lead.  they just have to play it safe.  avoid as many questions as possible.  pick a non-crazy vp, who could credibly be president in a couple years if Biden declines.
That’s a total cop out. Let’s not act like Biden won the DNC primary by himself. He had no money or enthusiasm. He was dead in the water. The DNC made all the candidates drop out and consolidated the moderates to Biden’s campaign to crush Bernie Sanders. He’s in trouble..
And Cuomo is Herod, Pelosi is a drunk, Biden is an idiot, Obama is the Worst President Ever (WPE), and Schumer was/is the snake in the garden of Eden.
What, maybe Michelle is jealous of Cortez and will take biden and Barry and bang their empty heads together like Moe used to do to Larry and Curley
Some of us saw it. Hence him losing by a massive margin in the popular polling.  Unfortunately one thing we didn't see if how fuckin dumb a frighteningly large portion America really is..... Biden needs to invest HEAVILY in education
Dear bigoted Scranton, PA area Pastor Randall Bloem, a vote for Joe Biden is a vote against covering up great evil. A vote for Donald Trump is a vote for covering up great evil! #Biden2020 #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
is doing everything he can but its amazing that rotten Dems do shit to back him! Trump has made this country economically stable and safe with the best defense! He cleaned up well from #Obama. Those that want Biden, you are friggin brain dead
I didn’t think the democrats would ever role out a candidate hated more than Hillary...then Joe Biden said, hold my beer.
I love to see ‘Biden winning in the polls’ It makes our certainty of a Trump win especially delicious!
And sadly, his supporters believe this. My dad is a supporter and I’m pretty sure he will be saying this to me to try to get me to not vote for Biden.
So exactly why was mission control calling them Bob and Doug? We can, but Joe Biden can't? Wow we are high and mighty today, aren't we?
She says while having zero information on Joe Biden’s thoughts.
Has anyone ever seen a Joe Biden mask? Anyone?
and you’ve resorted to name-calling. I don’t like Biden either, pal. I just don’t want this country in constant crisis any longer. I’ll head out now considering you’ve turned to immaturity. Hopefully you check out all the factual articles I’ve sent you ♥️ have a good day
Your depends must be stronger than ever considering how much youve been shitting yourself over Biden destroying you in November
everything you described is happening in Trumps America and Biden has never said he wants to defund police. that’s a scare tactic your president is using against old white people like you ♥️
I don't need to see any debates for me to vote for Joe Biden!
Is he promoting Biden with that slogan now?
Did he ever trademark that? Because it should definitely be Biden's slogan this year. #Biden2020Landslide
Really curious:  who do you want to be Biden’s VP?  #BidenVP
Riden with Biden
Biden’s tax agenda will truly strain our system especially if we allow everyone in from all around the world.  Free education free medical subsidized rent and jobs most Americans don’t want to do.  Middle class will be abolished as we give away our paychecks to the social system.
Your plan is to raise taxes, so long to the middle class and the housing market will crash former VP Biden
I want whoever Biden picks.😊
I hope everyone is following Biden he needs to increase his followers on social media.
He could die during a debate and Im still voting for Biden
“Biden will almost certainly be a one term President. If he makes it the entire term. He’s very old...” FUCK THAT. Completely disgusting thing to let someone say with no pushback at all. What a joke.
turned off the “99 Days to the Election” episode. You allowing  to multiple times make disgusting negative comments about Joe Biden’s Age/Health/Cognitive function was an insult. You not pushing back at all when he said (paraphrase)
Creatures like those two never give credit to the ones whose lives are on the line, such as the police and our great military members. Biden/Obama only elevate individuals who try to tear apart the fabric that makes the USA. Great, therefor I consider Biden and Obama SCUM
I’m with you!  I wish people would stop telling Biden what he MUST do and just leave him to make HIS own choice.😊
Biden will be the problem for normal people? Not the fascist wannabe dictator in the White House now? I was under the impression that Trump letting his white supremacist friends run amok that that would be the problem for normal people. Thank you for clearing that up for me. 🤨
Keep America great!  Oh wait. Yeah, very bad unemployment #s, and pandemic is killing a thousand people a day again because he wanted all the states opened!  Lies about Biden is definitely the next play.
If you fly our great flag,please don’t disrespect it by putting a Biden sign on the property. It is like oil and water.
What is least worse option for Trumps ego?  1.  Gets HUMILIATED by a Biden in the popular &amp; electoral vote &amp; cries rigged  2. He wins &amp; gets removed from office by Dem controlled House &amp; Senate.   3. He bows out now saying its unfair?
Good, wish we had on here, Scranton , pa not the home of joe Biden that’s somewhere in Delaware
Joe Biden on 4 Nov 20
See that’s what a leader does not come up with fake tears like Obama and Biden did neorealism than once.
E. The media.  Trump has not been good for America's health, but I think the media gave us Trump.  Left and right media gave us Trump.   Clinton was fine.  Biden hasn't done anything.  We survived Obama.  Trump &amp; Trumpishness is toxic beyond policy.
Joe Biden’s America is Trumps America already buddy
That's why I am endorsing  for President.
I had the honor of serving in the Obama-Biden administration.  knows we need more family-sustaining wages, more affordable childcare, and a bridge between education today and the economy of the future. He has first-hand knowledge of our problems and of our opportunities.
I guess trying to portray Joe “I wrote the Crime Bill” Biden as a Marxist Trojan horse isn’t working
From a man who mocks Joe Biden on a daily basis. Very few people in this country do more to fracture the Body of Christ than Raymond Arroyo.
Former President Obama With much do respect sir you used your speech today to do a political campaign. Script reading, that’s not like you or are you available for hire now?   You still have been asked why didn’t you endorse Biden from the start??? Do tell sir.
😂 Honestly, I wouldn’t be surprised if they tried to go with more of a Twitter thing and say”Like” for Biden and “Retweet” for Trump.
Just more work for Biden to re-instate them in January.  No worries.
Voting for Biden!
Interesting ... Some Biden allies wage a shadow campaign to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president
I'm in #PA07.  My guess is Biden +2.  That would be about a 3-point swing from 2016.
Biden just has to sit in the basement and let the Orange Man keep digging his own grave, which he's doing with alarming speed.  He's embraced white flight, sex with demons, and proposed moving an election that he has no Constitutional authority to do.   And its only Thursday.

If you ever run for the office of POTUS, I'd volunteer for you. I was hoping to see Tulsi succeed, even if it was on Biden's ticket, but she makes way too much sense for US populace.
Biden won’t pick Kamala because she’s Black though.. I will be very shocked if he chooses her as VP.
And if Joe Biden was your Uncle you would keep the kids away from him, at all costs.He might actually be an improvement over Cheeto turd - but I think I’ll stay with Biden#KanyeWest
Not voting for Biden because you don't like his VP selection is like watching Trump set fire to your house while Biden is standing in your front yard with a fire hose and you are sending him away because you didn't like the color of his pants.
i am ok i am impressed with biden so far, he appears to be reading his daily briefings and utilizing the info to secure his campaign like blocking chinese apps on company (campaign) phones
Gaffes like "Yosemenight" for Yosemite and "Thighland" for Thailand? At least Biden has a command of basic geography, let alone geopolitics.
Da noive. Rubio and other Republicans warn Democrats from "weaponizing...for political purposes" Director of National Intelligence report that Russia is trying to "denigrate" Biden to help trump win.
is that why biden banned tiktok and chinese apps? as he is aware of this intelligence?
i will vote for biden regardless, i am hoping he picks a candidate without legal nor intelligence issues
BIDEN WILL BE THE NATIONS NEXT PRESIDENT GOD WILLING🙏🏽
Joe Biden doesn’t have dementia. He’s a lifelong stutterer and he admits it. Trump, on the other hand, is being driven to his own insanity by his enormous hubris. Much like a tragic Greek protagonist, his pride will ultimately be his downfall.
Now do Joe Biden!# Trump2020
Joe Biden was never worthy of the black vote. He’s taken them for granted his entire career, and now it’s finally being exposed.
Now, let's do Joe Biden!
Most Americans Reject Delaying the 2020 Presidential Election – Research Co. Biden up 10.
Biden is out of touch in his basement
You’re playing to people fears and making stuff up... that’s not Biden’s position on guns. Have more respect for your followers intelligence...
This is what Obama and Biden tried to cover up along with the FBI...
This is what Obama and Biden tried to cover up along with the FBI...
Why are people suddenly saying this...heard that comment from two people this week.The only reason we may not hear about Covid for a few days is cause we’ll be celebrating Mr Biden’s presidential win!
Everyone needs to watch the   show last nite. I was in tears Lmao at him showing #Trump say Biden hates the Bible, don't like god then Trump saying Yo-Semite, Thyland w/ the Th not Thialand, and the Oranges not Origins. It so embarrassing, that this clown is President
You know, I can’t help but see all of you claiming you are going to vote for Biden. Voting for him just means you are voting for Trump. How can Jo Jorgensen win if you throw your vote away like that?  I’m voting for the woman who isn’t a credibly accused sexual predator.
Problem is Biden is constantly doing it and constantly having to apologize. Means the apologies aren’t real, he’s just pandering.
Why are you guys so sensitive. I’m a trump supporter and I think that the trump jokes were hilarious! But god forbid we make fun of Biden
I would crawl over broken glass coated in salt to vote for Biden
How many interviews did Melania Trump do in place of   None. It’s insulting to the American people for a Presidential candidate to hide and refuse to answer basic questions. Jill Biden isn’t running for office. #AreYouAJunkie
Biden is a Christian not fake like your Trump!!
You ain't Black, if you don't group think.  Vote for KKK senator Bird that Biden thought was the best thing since sliced bread.
This after trump says, "Biden hurts God." No, really.
Funny  In a couple days, Trump R’s will gaslight country, saying, “vote Trump because Biden is socialist and will mess with the market”
This tweet comes soon after he says he loves the Constitution more than Biden...  hashtag not how it works
So that means Republicans that don't like Trump will vote him...Because Democrats will still going to vote for a Democrat..Biden
Never Trump means Biden and that is bad for America
I understand she worked for fox and is Republican...But if she still in the " It depends on Biden V.P. pick"  phase ..After "All" Trump has done and is doing...Then she was never going to vote for Biden anyways..
But Biden is going to hurt G-d, y'all.
Then you don't really want to vote for Biden
Wow. Biden can hurt God!
And they call Joe Biden nuts....
It’s like he gets cue cards with bullet points of what he thinks the voters want and then goes out and says, “Biden hates...”
Is Biden a doddering fool or is he somehow powerful enough to "hurt God"?  Get your nonsense argument straight,
The progressive movement has real traction now and is gaining ground with every election. So, the establishment ain't what it used to be. True, it's not dead yet, but I prefer to remain open to hopeful possibilities. If Biden has the support of a flipped Senate, he can do a lot!
Biden might be more Catholic than the last Pope.
I believe this is my favorite picture of Biden. A man who knows to pray.💗
Someone mail this to Joe Biden’s house once a week.
It's not as simple as all that. People are more than their views on the issues. They are also defined by their integrity, and Biden's principles are deep-seated. He is not going to give Trump a free pass for his many crimes.
This guy is a tool bag if you vote Biden please do not be friends with me
I gave them both money. Miss them both. I am voting for Biden, but he was not in my top five.
the biden campaign now needs to come down hard on this,  the magas lost an attack vector and the administration unwittingly caused the investigation to be revealed
I’m attending The National Education Association’s event, “Virtual Town Hall on Reopening Schools with Jill Biden and NEA President Lily Eskelsen García” – sign up now to join me! #StrongPublicSchools
There is literally nothing Trump could say in a debate that would make me reconsider voting for Joe Biden, even for a second.
At least Joe Biden could quote his favorite verse and knows there is not a book called "Two Corinthians."
Trust me both sides want it, I feel Trump has been selected to bring in Police State. Running Biden so he's reelected.
Biden could make an ad about being able to eat a cheese sandwich and I would still take him over trump. Our country needs stability and leadership. Biden will bring that until we can get 2 viable choices for change in 2024.
true patriots, vote Biden no mattter what! as i will!
anyone who is for ethical and lawful law enforcement with increased funding to achieve better outcomes and for cleaning the govts house of communists (including voting out trump) should be for biden.  He is my guy :)

No he won’t and no he isn’t.  I live in and travel all over Pa.  no Biden signs.  Trump signs everywhere.
Hopefully with Mr Biden many of us will be spared your pain and heartbreak. Sorry for the loss of your daughter, losing a child is painful, losing a child the way you did I cannot imagine your pain.
I think it's up to Biden.
And they have to know that more Republicans will vote for him ..Taking votes away from Trump...Not Biden
Sir! It's not the Trump campaign! For example, during the Democratic debates, anyone with an open-mind could realize that Joe Biden was struggling with his speech! In some interviews, that's happening too. Lastly, why is he rejecting an interview with Chris Wallace if he is okay?
I can criticize Trump for being many things: thin-skinned, childish, arrogant, condescending, a bully, a conspiracy theorist; but the fact that Trump supporters go after Biden for losing his mind when Trump isn't too far behind in that category isn't a good strategy.
They are already saying Russia is trying to rig this election. Can you imagine if trump beats Biden that they will push another Russia hoax on everybody cause they didn't win again
He could literally be a cheese sandwich with a Biden pin and I would rather vote for him
and biden continues to disappoint with apparently ANOTHER attempt of consequence-lacking "rEfOrM"  ill take reform over nothing any day, but at the same time how will give that reform WEIGHT and CONSEQUENCE for officers who do not follow those new policies?
this is amazing, i never dreamed back in 1988 when i was old enough to vote,  that i would be interacting with the account of a living VP (joe biden)!
Riden with Biden!!!!!
But trump will not refuse to leave. Many strategists believe he will set up a cable network, steal Fox loyalists, rant for two hours a day how he was robbed and attack Biden, and try to run himself or through his children in 2024. This is most in keeping with trump's nature.
Would you be opposed to a live televised cognitive test performed by Trump and Biden?  If so, why?  BTW, rejecting same based upon a claim that same is just a 'stunt' (or similar inference) will be deemed as conceding that Trump would do far better than Biden in that test.
Then no charges until Biden in office.
this is my answer to Joe Biden. I love your commentary &amp; how you tear libs apart. Keep it up my brother! Mike, Allentown, Pa.
campaign lying again by altering photos/videos of Mr. Biden. #TrumpCantKeepItUp
*coffee break thoughts*  Why is it weak for Biden to speak from Delaware but strong for Trump to speak from DC?  *petty coffee break thoughts*   Gee, I hope Wisconsinites will vote for Biden even if he doesn't go there.
I am voting for Joe Biden no matter who his VP pick is! I trust his judgment and whoever is not VP will be needed in the cabinet because we need all these intelligent people to fix trump’s mess!
Serious question, is there any real chance that this pulls enough votes from Biden to make a difference?  I can't imagine anyone who takes the time to vote arriving and pulling the lever (or better yet, taking the time to mail in the ballot) for Kanye...
is mentally unstable to be  period. He should take a test.
Whoever Biden picks as his running mate in the next week or two is not going to be everyone's 1st choice. She's going to get the full misogynistic treatment that awaits so many public women. Think carefully before you post hot-takes or memes or images. Eyes on the prize, please.
If you were part of the Democrat establishment, you’d probably try to weasel Joe Biden out of the debates. They’ve kept him in a basement while   has done the real work of our country. #Trump2020
i will vote for biden regardless of who he picks, however, we want him to win as decisively as possible and have the cleanest staff on his administration as possible
Remember Peter Fonda / On Golden Pond?  He’s reincarnated as Joe Biden 😲
Trump's interview debacle sends a warning for the fall campaign
I live in the lehigh valley area I cant see Biden winning out here
If Biden tries to get out of debating Trump trump should automatically win by default Biden should be proclaimed disqualified and Trump automatically becomes president for four more years if you can’t debate you can’t be president
Can it be any more obvious that Biden obviously is not capable of standing on a debate stage with President Trump he can’t even do an interview with Chris Wallace getting softball questions obviously hiding Biden don’t have all of his marbles
Better yet buy a roll of stamps and mail 100 ‘Biden for President’ bumper stickers to the White House.
Try to understand Joe Biden!
Joe Biden is no better!
Mr. Biden, during the Presidential debates, please just bring a video projector and play the responses from  from this  interview.  Do not say a word during your time, just be ready to press play from time to time.
Tucker: In a normal year, Biden's VP options wouldn't be qualified  via
Joe Biden has plenty of time on his hands when his home health care aides and Visiting Angels leave for the day.
this gives us a pretty good idea of biden's thinking.  a unity platform
No you’re still wrong. I don’t watch fox, or any news network for that matter and I also don’t do what the President says. Yeah sure he’s got my vote though cause I don’t wanna see Biden in there.
i hope biden's first response team sees the amplification attempt and also the sabotage attempt of using possibly legally tainted candidates
it seems that people are trying to sabotage biden
Because Biden has been in politics for 40 + years and hasn't done shit except line his pockets as well as hid kids.
It’s amazing that for months conservatives have been predicting that Biden will skip out on the debates  And right on queue his media allies are laying all the groundwork for it
I don't need reasons not to vote for Trump. I need a few reasons to vote for Biden. Just a few.
Trump Wants A Do-Over In A New York Congressional District...  Get Ready Heil Trump Will Be Interfering In Every Election...  Let's Send A Strong Message That Trump Needs To Go By Voting Biden In A Landslide...
If Biden does debate Trump. He should do it with live fact checkers.
It is obvious that the dirty Democrats are so desperate there is no way in hell they will allow Joe Biden to get on the stage and debate President Trump The Democrats think the American people are stupid let’s prove these filthy animal wrong and vote red November
Just FYI for those who either support or don’t support  We MUST keep him OUT of The
Joe Biden has been wrong on every major foreign policy decision in 40+ years, and Susan Rice would simply prop up those errors. Their bad decisions are what got   elected. #TuckerCarlson
Makes sense! I’m sure the grand wizard of the KKK supports Biden also!
True. trump will sue when he loses, lose the lawsuit, and then buy and yak it up about how he was robbed as well as spout conspiracy theories and try for 2024 nomination.  Trump Doesn’t Like What He Sees in the Crystal Ball
And if Biden loses they will come up with another excuse and 4 more years of not excepting the results after accusing trump of not excepting the results.
The auto industry would not exist if not for Obama/Biden. What has Trump done that benefited #DearMichigan ?
Joe Biden's state of mind is so.bad that even touching a keyborad is a challenge. Trump, on the other hand, can hold his own!
I am a woman that is not against Trump! I support Trump because he supports law and order:He supports the police!  Democrats, on the other hand, are supporting lawlessness! I want my family to live in a safe country, not in a country run by anarchists, criminals and a weak Biden!
I suggest we all mail 'Vote for Biden' bumper stickers  to Donald Trump at the White House.
311 (Electoral Votes for Biden)  Am I trying too hard?
Biden cheated the United States.
All I’m saying is if you vote for joe Biden, we did this already, it wasn’t the worst 8 years and there is a serious possibility we won’t have to talk about politics for like 4 years. Wouldn’t that be neat? Remember talking about other stuff?
Why would Biden supporters be out to see you? Duh and by thousands and thousands I assume in Trump speak maybe 100 people. You will lose no matter how much you lie.
I do think that Joe Biden raped Tara Reade because other people have confirmed her story: the Larry King Tape, the ex-neighbor, the ex-colleague, a court doc., etc. Now, I think Joe Biden might not truly remember it because he seems to suffer from dementia, which affects memory!
Oh! So you're making excuses for Joe Biden's horrible behavior! Democrats are so hypocritical. Believe all women-even Joe Biden said so- until Joe Biden is accused of rape. They attack Trump for his behavior toward women while defending Biden's! If Trump is wrong, so is Biden!
I do! Remember: Even Joe Biden said to believe her!
Decency? Joe Biden has been accused of rape! He has also said that he loved kids jumping on his lap! People can also see him kissing, touching, sniffing etc.women and.children! In my country, we consider men who act like that "perverts!"
Like a poor Biden Adminstration won’t reflect on the VP who is a member of it? This is a ridiculous take.
The fallacy of the silver bullet vaccine. Another reason why we need someone who cares enough to see this pandemic through: Joe Biden.
Just thank God that Biden isn't driving!#KAG2020
Pennsylvania here. 4 more years. Finish off the swamp. Jail for Hillary, Biden and the former FBI criminal officials etc.
I'd be OK with it if someone resurrected Mata Hari and Biden named her. Anyone but Trump and company in the WH
I dont think biden has a chance in anywhere but the major cities in pa
My sister: lori r u still voting 4 trump? Me: of course. I've been a huge supporter since the escalator ride, ? Sis: oh I like biden! Me: do u have rocks in ur head. Did u c all that DT did 4 NY? Sis: oh but the luv guv! Me: ur crazy, let me explain. At least she hates deBlasio
You’re idiot dude! You haven’t heard anything! I believe that’s what they’re saying about your boy! But even if it’s true, I’ll vote for Biden anyway before voting for Trump! My beautiful niece who is Downs Syndrome is better qualified then Trump! #facts
Ignore trumps October dump on Biden!
That really sucks because trump and Biden debate would be fucking funny
No worries Biden will. BIDEN2020!!!

I don’t care if he gets it or not, do want Joe Biden to beat him and then want trump the hell out of the White House!
I don’t even know if Biden will beat trump. I live in Pa and all I see are trump signs. I think they’re are voters who will vote for him regardless of his stupidity. Biden will pick a female of color because he needs the votes, but I don’t think it’s enough for him to win
Yeah but we're talking about Biden RN sweety
I'm not resting until I see Joe Biden's hand on a bible in January.
Because Trump v Obama only exists in Trump’s delusions. His opponent is Joe Biden and he will beat Trump like a drum! 🥁
The people in Joe Biden's camp  have shown their far left inclinations by having a Castro follower, Karen Bass, in his short list for VP! This was not a mistake because they vetted her and knew exactly where her sympathies lay! The people.around Joe Biden are far left activists!
Beijing Biden that is fucking great 😂😂😂😂
But let’s talk about Hunter Biden! 😒
See the all the president Trump haterz in here lmaooo... y’all mad cuz the president ain’t cought up and Bill Clinton is!!! He been crooked!! Him and Joe slow ass Biden help lock up half of America! Fckm Both!!!#BillClintonIsAPedo
Still, with all Donald Trump's issues, Joe Biden is no match for him! Joe Biden looks frail while Trump looks strong, physically and mentally!
And we won’t. Biden 2020🇺🇸
Everyone saying biden is gonna cheat with mail in voting, but honestly It will be Donald trump the one who will be cheating. Why do you think he doesn't fund the post office in these covid relief bills ? Why do you think he appointed his own person to be in charge of the P.O
I am voting against trump regardless, but heard persuasive argument to not debate.  They wont debate real issues because trump just lies about everything, however. With no crowd to cheer him on with his zingers????  That gives biden an advantage.
It’s painfully obvious to me that  is the right pick. I hope the Biden people don’t try to out smart themselves.
This is a complete failure on behalf of Team Biden. They better clean this up pronto.
Yes!  Ready to vote Biden!!
Man your twitter feed has a lot of pro Biden promos I’m impressed
Good name calling try this name on for size President Biden
No, Bernie never wanted to win. Bernie, is in Democratic party, to stop the left wing from forming a third party. He corrals them into, voting for Hilary or Biden. Bernie is a democrat trust me, zero backbone. 2016 he agreed well before convention to not attack hillary.
Sleepy Biden like you call him is going to sweep the floor with you come Election Day. Your loosing voters. Get off Twitter and go do something productive for once. Get off Obama’s, and Hillary’s ass already you HATER.
My take is that Karen Bass is more likely.  Head of the Congressional Black Caucus, former Speaker of the CA Assembly.  She’s a safer bet than Harris for Biden, and helps him avoid the ire of the Berniecrats who loathe Harris.  Profile in Courage Award for her work 2008-10.
Biden could not take a piss next to TRUMP!
You did not beat Obama, you didn't even beat Biden. Obama would have cleaned your clock far worse than Biden will. Resign already!

Only deficits under Democratic administrations are bad.  The GOP deficits are patriotic.  Need to get rid of the filibuster because the GOP will use deficits as an excuse to block any Biden initiative that requires investment.
It's a good thing Joe Biden isn't ambitious.
I’ve donated, attended online events and celebrated a few of his policies, but if Biden continues this he will get no more help from me outside of my vote. The welcoming of Kasich and the comments of Dodd shows they are not understanding this moment - at all.
I am so so riled up about this. The fact that Biden has these assholes in his inner circle making decisions about the campaign is absolutely disgusting. And the fact that it has ended up in multiple news outlets makes it worse.

maybe, but I'd bet less than you think. I think its a real short list of folks who are on the fence with Biden but would be swayed by VP. Most folks on the left at this point know either they won't be feeding the machine or they can't sit by with Trump as the opponent.
It will be such a landslide for Biden that you will absolutely know on election night.

I am using Biden so that I can understand why there is seemingly a disconnect here.
B/c Biden will be at a mass gathering where there essentially is no social distancing.  Yet, Mr. Biden is staying in his basement because of social distancing.  But the protesters do not socially distance and you claim there's no spike.  Do you understand the conflict now?
Assuming you statement is accurate, then it can only logically (and scientifically) assumed that there now exists no material impediment for Mr. Biden to be physically present at his political rallies and speeches.  If not, why not (i.e.please distinguish).
Was this a eulogy???? Or a commercial for Biden?

This is mainly who I am taking about. He is on the selection committee. He has been named in most of the leaks. So yes, surrogates. Donors going to donor, but to say they don’t have some control over this is false.

What Biden said was politically and ethically true. Black American only apply to descendants of slaves. Period. Latinos can be Mexicans, Puerto Ricans or from a number of other countries, no clarification needed.
Biden campaign has agreed to rules of the three debates scheduled, Trump campaign has not, WHY?
Biden, being the decent, moral person he is apologized for his mis-statement, unlike you a low class thug!
And  saying Biden hates and will just God is not offensive to you? Biden is a devout Catholic, unlike Trumps history of adultry, grabbing women by genitala, paying off porn star and playing bunny.
The I assume also no excuses for this?  Biden has one of the most racist records in politics.  Try doing some reading.
Rofl,  he supports none of those things...  Biden on the other hand. Is a kid touching pedophile and a racist
What is wrong with  In an interview he said  was a Civil Rights Activist. Trump said that Biden hates GOD. I hope this is going to be on an Unfiltered show. The stupidity of these guys. Trump's base believes this crap.
Yeah. The first Black president was so upset by that he never worked with Biden. Oh wait
What does that have to do with what Biden said?  He said that Latinos are more culturally diverse then African Americans.  Which is completely false.

Like Biden has ever done anything except vote for segregation and screwed up every speech he has made.  The dude has zero ability to govern
We care about the VP because that will be the president.  Biden has serious mental issues.  Mark my words,  saw it with my mom,  he has a year or two of being lucid left.  We need to know who the VP is.

Trump is unable to debate mentally. His brain’s fried. I don’t see him agreeing to any. He will make something up about not liking the format. However, if somehow they do have one, Biden should walk in the 23 women that accused Trump of sexual assault and sit them near the stage.
Biden should not debate with Trump.  65% don't like Donald so just get them to vote.  This is why Trump keeps talking about mail ins.  Now he is controlling the USPS.  Sure of power never ends.

Biden supporter? Idk, even if they might have the betterment of the people in mind depending on who you talk to, their proposed solutions for a better world under capitalism are way too flawed and fallacious and kinda bootlicky for my tastes, for at the end of the day, Biden's
I loved his comments of disgust in Biden partisan polictizing the virus.  Haha. I mean he did create the mask partisan line.
'Wearing the mask is less about you contracting the virus,' Joe Biden said. 'It’s about preventing other people from getting sick.
I don’t understand how y’all mfs just can’t seem to be satisfied. You hate Trump and already fed up wit Biden, y’all need one way tickets
Joe Biden has sexually harassed women and children, etc. and was accused of rape by Tara Reade.He was a senator then. Ex- Presidents Bill Clinton, John F.Kennedy, Franklin D. Roosevelt were all adulterers while in the White House! All Democrats! So spare me the hypocrisy!

Hmmm...they do realize the election hasn't taken place yet, right? I mean, maybe Biden doesn't know.

How about we all do our part to save the United States Postal Service?  Let us all send 100 'Vote Biden' postcards to the White House.  Better yet we should send registered letters asking Donald to resign to the White House.  #PostmasterGeneral

I can't wait to see the debates. I will be honest, I didn't like the sparring she did with Biden. However, I respect them both for getting past it and focusing on the bigger prize. I think he deliberately picked someone to be President next due to his age. VOTE VOTE VOTE!
That is not going to happen with this fool in office. I suggest that Drs as a group vote Biden/Harris to get him out of our lives, to save lives.

Check out Biden’s positions. I know he is an trans ally. And believe he will stick to his positions.
No, Sir! Trump couldn't have said that! We are talking about the draft during Vietnam War. Some of my friends got deferments, just like Trump, because they were in college! In addition, bone spurs is considered a disability for service. Both Trump and Biden got five deferments!

Biden/Harris is Clinton/Kaine all over again.
Matt Gates is just another useless piece of garbage who does nothing to help anyone but himself. Joe Biden is proving to everyone how well he can speak. And there is a connection between Kamala andJoe. Does Gaetz think trump cares about him at all!
They are already building a narrative for why they lost when the real reason is that they are pandering for rightwing votes they won't get because Biden won't commit to appointing pro-life SCOTUS judges (I mean, there's still time, but #VoteBlueNoMatterWho right?)
Kamala, now running for President (when Biden retires) was either lying or totally taken in by the #jussiesmolletthoax.  Do we really want some1 so easily buffaloed to be OUR face in dealing with foreign nations?   Sure the foreigners will ❤️it: they'll take advantage of us again
They won't. They are unable to see the difference between Trump and Biden. They are obviously blind.

Both Trump and Biden have, of course, been publicly attacked at various points in their career by women.   Trump regularly demeans, belittles and insults them.   Biden took the woman who landed the most solid punches and asked her to be hit top wingman.   Pick your fighter.

Biden will have to come out of the hole he is in eventually! Lol!
Yes watching two people who know how to put coherent thoughts together and express them so well,gives us hope!And Mr Biden didn’t push her aside and start speaking before she finished her speech. So wonderful to see the rapport!
First, I did not vote for Trump, but I might this time! Second, if Trump's daughter had been abused- like you say- they wouldn't have the beautiful relationship that they have today! If you look at Biden's video, children are seen squirming! That's the big  difference!

Honestly,  surprised Biden is allowed in school zones.
The Greatest Headline We've Seen For Quite A Long Time!  What A Relief!

Biden and Harris take no questions  from media, not surprising this will be led by MEDIA not Buden or Harris.
I totally agree ,James.Scary  304 electoral votes Biden 245
If Trump wins, you'll need to be able to present a Harris/Biden campaign poster, button, sign, sticker to speak to me again.
Its historic alright...biden can't even speak.
Hahahahaha...”if and WHEN Biden steps aside”!!!!  Mush for brains Biden is done before he even starts!
That's funny- You start with A lie and I show you the truth, now you're depressed. I'm sure you have a safe space to go to- you'll be fine  PS  You ever met Biden?  Or Trump?

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris Speak as Democratic Ticket | Now This
I have not seen a single soul say this, because it would be messed up and twisted. Fox News however apparently thinks something is going to happen to Biden in the next two months. 🤷🏻‍♀️
It's been 2 days since Kamala Harris news broke and I'm already tired of it !! I'll tell ya what will probably happen. Probably Oct. and Biden will  be found to Not be able/fit to be able to continue to run. They, Dems will replace Biden with Harris as presidential candidate !!
So you're gonna vote for a sexual predator/ racist in Biden, or is she a liar? And if she's a liar, you're gonna vote for someone that lies about sex crimes and racism?
Biden has long had strong relations with the African American community and often talks on the trail about serving as vice president to the country’s first black president, says  College political analyst Chris Borick.
so true, thought Joey's upper denture was going to fall out today, Biden/Kamala is enough to gag a maggot. 👇🙄
Hillary raised about $1 Billion in 2016 and lost.  It's not the money, it's the political philosophy; in that respect, Biden will lose bigly (but Dems will predicably resist introspection, and blame everyone else but themselves for their loss).
Threatening a U.S. Presidential candidate?  . What are you going to do about this? Fox News is threatening Joe Biden. A woman whose friends with sex traffickers?
No, America isn't fine with that, to the extent that Dems are also involved with the same activities that you insinuate are nefarious.  America wasn't "fine" with electing Hillary President of the US b/c of Dem hypocrisy, and the same holds true w/ Biden in 2020.  Get real.
Why would Biden decide to step aside? I think he should be very careful now that his running mate has been named.

If Biden is the best the Democrat party has to offer then it will be destroyed when Trump finishes 4 more years.  Just move to the Communist party and be a high ranking member if you join soon early
I have no respect for women who use men to get ahead! When you're a strong woman in your own right, you don't do that! Kamala Harris said that she supported the women who accused Joe Biden of sexual harassmen. She also accused him  of racism! However, she is now his running mate!
Why would little Black and brown girls feel overlooked and undervalued? Is that how Joe.Biden thinks of them? That's such a racist thing to say!  By the way, hasn't Joe Biden noticed that Harris is light- skinned? Does he know her mother is Indian, father Jamaican? Surreal!
I think that’s the biggest fear is, that although Biden wasn’t my first choice, I still will be voting for him NO matter what. And with the votes that are going to him how the “followers” of the ol’ cheeto are going to feel.
BIDEN DID NOT PUT HIS KIDS ON THE BUS. THE AFRICAN AMERICAN.  KIDS.  SHAME ON YOU BIDEN.   TRYMP 2020
Its funny that Biden / Harris go against basically everything that Democrats claim to stand for, but.. anything but Trump, eh? Even if its the same or worse even.
This is what Biden meant when he said he beat Trump like a Drum....
Where are you watching the dotard? It appears both   and  both smartly decided not to show his rally so that real news about Biden/Harris could be covered.

Too bad you believe the fake news and don't even bother to find out what he said, but I guess that is par for the course for someone voting for the Communist supported candidate.   Yep, the US Communist party endorsed Biden

I could swear biden was endorsing her
thought the same thing, frankly was surprised that biden made it though a full speech. 👇👁️

Are you saying vote for Trump or Biden?
Kamala Harris is a 2%er. Only 2% of Democrats supported her Presidential campaign.  And she believe Biden preyed on women and is a racist
#WATCH:   appear together in #Delaware. See their event live soon on   #Election2020
I am so happy you picked Kamala Harris for your Vice Presidential running mate. I was praying it would be her since the TV appearances. She is very intellectual and has a very nice personality and chacter. I will be voting for both. Good LuckVice President, Joseph Biden. 👏🏻😇🙏
Biden and Harris will appear together Wednesday at a high school in Biden’s Delaware hometown to discuss their shared vision for how to defeat President Trump.
In 30 years of voting, I have NEVER voted for a Democrat for President. I’m voting for Biden/Harris in 2020 just to ensure there IS a presidential election in 2024
I don't care about the race or gender of a candidate. I don't care that Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris as his running mate! My concern is about who's going to be strong on keeping the US secure in the face of this "Defund the Police" movement which Harris is okay with!
I see that as a separate issue. The fact is that the Lincoln Project, a Republican group, published a Biden-Harris campaign video, a good one, within an hour or so of the announcement. I applaud that, and I'm not worried about what George's wife was doing at that same time.
Harris thought Biden racist, his star shines brighter in racist homes.
When Obama was president y’all loved Biden lol
Joe Biden is purely CGI animation
It's been hard watching the "News' today. in re Harris, dems had a hard enough time pitching Biden, but Kamala?
afternoon sir, best news, the market/DOW is doing well, that in it's self is a very good sign, that despite everything that's going on, the economy is doing well.. Biden/Harris, being frank, is just an unpleasant distraction for the next 80+ days, the ticket is doomed.
DISTRACTION!!!  Trump pulls the racist card to get the attention back on him and not Biden/Kamala.
WATCH: Chris Borick, Director of the  College Institute of Public Opinion, speaks to  about Joe Biden's choice of Kamala Harris for VP.
Systemic change takes time. And progress will be more difficult with four more years of Trump, than with Biden as president, in my opinion. It's an uphill battle either way, but more so with Trump continuing in office. All just my own opinion, of course. We each get to have them.
Well, let's see! Joe Biden loves children jumping on his lap, sexually harasses women and.children - lots of pictures and videos to support this- and let's not forget that Tara Reade said he raped her when he was a senator. So, why are you voting for a sexual harasser and rapist?
Yes, he did. That's why I'm not a duopoly fan. And, there are also major factual differences between a Trump Administration and a Biden Administration that matter a significant majority of Americans.
If elected, which part of the Biden/Harris radical left agenda will trigger republicans the most?
Ok. That’s why he stopped incoming travel from China and Europe and the MSM and Biden criticized him for it, even calling him racist.  You can’t see past your hatred of  Trump.
The mistakes that Trump has made are minor compared to what  would make. Nobody is perfect, but Joe Biden would take that to the extreme.
Did He Say That In Russian?
Biden announced that his VP pick is Kamala Harris. This is not bad news. Her representation can bring a warmth to the politics of today; she will push both progressive and moderate ideals; she will work for all people. We need people like Kamala Harris, so let's fight for her!
That's actually Joe Biden in the picture!
Frankly,  should be given any damned position she wants. She out fundraised all of the other VP candidates, Biden is adopting her policies with little or no attribution...enough of the silent women doing the hard work and getting no credit.
Biden want to take that claim
but Biden vowed to pick a woman
You need African-American votes to win. African-American voters didn't vibe off the cute gay guy, the genki grandma, the old guy with the crazy white hair, or the lady with the big teeth and shoulders. Biden got the key constituencies - which literally IS the point of primaries.
Kamala Harris  is not the first VP nominee  she's  Jamaican  and Asian NOT AFRICAN ! BIDEN STILL SHOWS HIS RACISM

Except Biden is definitely racist and also rubs all on women and little girls...  also Harris is completely crooked and has absolutely no business in the white house.
Not to mention she believes the Biden accusers of sexual assault
Oh yeah, this is the gift that will keep on giving, completely destroyed Biden calling him a segregationist is on record saying she believes Tara, and then decides to join with this what she calls a racist sexual predator, wow, I'm in awe
Yo how great would it be if center-right democrats like Biden, Harris, and Pelosi were actually the radical socialists the far right believes them to be?
Guess you got twittered, doesn’t play? Only law breakers can get out here, not the truth! Besides biden wouldn’t be president for about 6 months then pew pew time if not already from fraudulent election! IMO Prepare!
I voted for Gore, Kerry, Obama (twice), and Clinton. I'll be voting for Biden, too. Democrats rarely win when their base feels they "have to" vote for their candidate rather than genuinely wanting to, so maybe ease up on the "you have to vote Biden" rhetoric?
I like her!  I'm so happy about Kamala I haven't given much thought to Biden's cabinet, etc. However, I will, and I'm positive Joe and Kamala have it (almost) totally worked out

B/c there are going to be A LOT of talks about "What Biden wishes he could do"  and in a pandemic, that doesnt slow disease spread or oxygenate a patient's lungs and respiratory system. It's not gonna matter to the outcomes how he felt when he didnt do anything.
Biden isn't even in office yet.  You have your man in office. He isn't doing shit and doesn't give a damn if you die.   He himself said more will die it is what it is.  He isn't doing a thing.  Why get pissed at someone not in office when your is killing people with indifference
Nah watching that studdering babbling fool Biden try and debate Trump, oh man, that is if they even allow it
We want to pull google images? 😂 Ok here. (And a correction here is that he was actually "only" a cyclops of the KKK) that's also not Bidens daddy, that's Biden himself.  You must not be paying attention
Not a great endorsement for Biden. So his VP is brighter than he is?Trump and Pence will.trounce them in.debates
So the Democrats shut the left out of the convention.  And the platform.  And the ticket.  To "not scare" the Republicans who want to vote for Biden.  So they don't care about alienating the left? They don't need us?  This tent has grown unmanagably big. We need a new tent.

In her first public statement since Joe Biden named her as his vice presidential running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris says she’s “honored” to join the Democrats’ presumptive presidential nominee on the party’s November ticket.

Biden has been in government for 47 years and hasn’t done a thing. What makes you think being president is going to change that?
Not true at all. Biden was leading well before Covid.
yea its just soft serve ice cream lol idgaf if joe biden hands it to me
Biden could come out in his Pj’s like Clark Griswald eating a bagel, drinking an Irish coffee, take a shot of Jack, and still have more mental fitness and acuity than president dementia. I don’t even like Biden. A broken bicycle would probably be a better vote then Trump.
I think she's very aligned with Biden, making it a safe pick.  It's just that she's not a progressive by all means.

President Trump wasted no time attacking Sen. Kamala Harris as Joe Biden's running mate. But in 2014, he was donating to her political campaign.
Harris and Biden should constantly advertise Trump’s endorsement.

So I am happy about Joe Biden's VP pick.  I wanted her as President and who knows maybe she will end up as President eventually.
This map is obviously not predictive of actual voter support, since Biden is not on it and yet Biden is the nominee. I'm not sure what isn't clicking - "winning GE votes" is the game, and Bernie would not have won enough of them.
Joe Biden has prostituted himself to special interests and foreign powers for his entire career, so his choice of a transactional candidate for the Democrat VP slot is perfectly consistent with his “resume”. #TuckerCarlson
I'm somewhat optimistic about the Biden/Harris ticket.  I'm wildly enthusiastic that the speculation is over and it's announced.
If 5 million people think the same thing you just said and decide hey let's vote Jo, then neither Trump nor Biden wins

It's plausible Biden would score around 115. His presentation &amp; verbiage seem strong, but not stellar. Based on her success in the hardscrabble urban legal trenches, I suspect Kamela Harris would score higher &amp; may be set to play Chaney to his G. W. Bush.

No we need the debates to see Biden drool. If he can't come up with some excuse that is.
You are very right my friend. Only if they can prop Biden up until the election it will happen much faster. It's the only way they can get someone to be president who would never be able to achieve it through a legal election.
God did bless America,  Biden got in the race and he's going to beat you like a drum! You are the greatest danger to this country,  even more than gun violence. We can change people's behavior in reference to guns, but you on the other hand is trying to change our foundation.

Do you really think there will be debates? I can’t picture Trump’s team letting him on stage with Biden and no minder.
Can't even comment - Jill Biden should be ashamed of herself.

I hate to tell you this, but President Trump is purposefully sabotaging the post office so he could cheat in the election by preventing many of Joe Biden's from safely voting.
You better not let your boy the Mask Cop Biden see you
Qanon is not the new Tea Party. It's is hate group - an extreme right wing hate group who participate in hate crimes. If Biden wins then crawl back under the rocks from which they came. Or they're arrested &amp; marginalized.
No - you misunderstood. Hanity didn't suggest stopping those things in the MeidasTouch video. He was saying it about Democrats, MeidasTouch edited the video to appear as though he was saying it about Trump. He was not. He was saying it about Dems, about Joe Biden.

Seems to me it's the old moron that YOU elected that can't seem to handle this country and it's issues. All the bad is happening on Trump's watch. He is the failure. Trump is the LOSER. Nominating Biden has nothing to do with the lack of a high functioning government.

African Americans are the ones who gave Biden the key to the nomination! Without their huge turnout and votes in the south we wouldn’t be here. Why aren’t we talking about that?
Tell me, I understand people change, but Biden really does have a history of trying to freeze spending, at least, if not defund. What in his experience has changed that point of view? He just suddenly came to a realization? Claims of growth without context seem awfully empty.
I mean let's face it...Its either Biden or Trump.Does Biden have the policies I want?? Guess what..at least he has policies.Trump literally has nothing but his cold narcissistic pursuit 4 reelection ,at which he will stop at nothing to get.Who is actually in love with Biden?
I voted for Biden 2x with Obama i was gonna not say nothing. Cause i knew how big this was. But then he said you not black if you don’t vote for me, then he said Hispanics are more diverse. That was the straw for me

Est. sellouts dropped out quickly &amp; got on Biden's bandwagon after South Carolina in order to crush the progressive left. If Trump crushes them in November, I have no sympathy whatsoever. They get what they deserve.
The only reason to vote for Biden/Harris is that they would be a weaker regime to overthrow
Biden was telling people to vote at polling places in a pandemic &amp; he &amp; the Est. used it successfully to get Bernie to drop out. Now Obama &amp; the rest of them are crying about Trump cheating, hilarious.
Biden’s not a puppet...unlike Trump...Paul Manafort picked Mike Pence!  (Not sure there were too many folks eager to be Trump’s running mate anyway!) Biden could’ve chosen any one of those incredibly talented &amp; accomplished women...and you would have made the same false claim!
Not swing but presumably substantial Biden votes.
It’ll be the same with a facelift instead of orange hair, just as inarticulate, and Biden might gin up a war.
i don’t get it at all either. their internal polling must seem awfully fucking grim. because to my mind all it does is light a fire under the opposition. you fuck with the mail like this and even the most bitter swing state bernie busters like me are gonna cast a biden ballot.
Umm so, 2/3rd saying they are more likely to support Biden with Harris? That's great! 😆😊 Thank you for sharing this great news and high favor-ability of Kamala. 😊🙏
Obama &amp; Biden attacked your community. 3 million deportations. This is why Sanders crushed Biden with the Latino vote &amp; now credible reporting has stated that the Latino vote is not a part of the Biden team's path to victory.

Never really accused you of being a Biden supporter now did I? Never said you were gonna vote for Biden either. I mentioned Trump bashers and the Biden/Harris agenda.
Biden has been weirdly polling a little worse in PA than WI and MI. Though maybe to be expected since Trump won PA by more than the other 2 states. The PA loss was still most shocking to me in '16 cycle maybe because I'm from here and Clinton spent the time here.
I thought that was you Rockefeller👍 secrets' safe with me

You’re right, but the ideal situation is a Biden landslide with hopefully a small minority contending results. Please help spread useful voting info to make that happen.
Oh the ones saying American under Biden like it isn't America with him as prez?
Can you answer this question if Trump wins will Biden,Comma-la and all the socialist Dems go quietly? Or are we going to have another round of burning down cities, rioting and looting? I want a Democratic  politician to answer these questions!
In a way this suggests WI and MI are more likely to go Biden than PA. If he gets WI, MI, he only needs 1 more state.   Or every Clinton state + PA + MI + more conservative Maine CD and liberal Nebraska CD gets him to 270 exactly.
This is interesting so now maybe PA is the tipping point state and not WI, as everyone thought a year ago. Biden has gotten some great polls from WI lately.
Great price for betting Biden. Terrible price for betting Trump.
45 hasn’t said anything worse than that about black people but that nigga has said worse shit lol. It’s just hilarious how Biden thought that statement was the shit when he said it 😂
And do they think we’ll riot? NO ONE will fight on the streets for Joe Biden. No one will be tear gases for Biden’s claim on the presidency. We’re utterly fucked and everyone is acting like it’s all over on Nov. 3rd is fucking FOOLING THEMSELVES. #JoeBiden #USPS
any extra votes that tip the scale towards Biden are fake. Then it will be Bush v. Gore all over again. Where Gore sat down and refused to fight because “the handing off of power is too important to fight over like this, we may taint it.” That’s what Democrats will do in 2020 2/3

The dead give away that this is obviously satire isn't the cop asking about pronouns, rather that Joe Biden will still be alive in 2021.
Biden is sicker than I thought, how could anyone vote for a man who wants to take are rights, and are freedoms away. America is doomed if we put this mad man in the whitehouse.
Good people can be blinded and make bad decisions. It's a shame they're often also so blinded by their fear, they attack others for making different decisions with the same rationale. Difference is Biden voters are short-term thinkers, Hawkins voters are long-term thinkers.

It’s not “attacking Biden” not voting o the platform doesn’t have anything to do with voting on November 3rd you dolt. 🤦🏾‍♂️ You’re making Democrats look really bad with your ignorance.
Barr confessed on tv today that he is gonna try to pull a James Comey and release a false smear of Biden right before the election disguised as an investigation. It’s propaganda - how many media members will play along?
you are an evil woman and no black man should give you or Biden the time of day
IMAGINE MY SHOCK.
I love it when #BlueMAGA types say, "Biden is for X, look at his webpage!" Facts are, he's not campaigning on a single one of those things. He's campaigning on "morals". Sorry if I don't believe a webpage he probably didn't read himself.
I can't think of one member of Congress who treats the people as their bosses. They pay lip service to it, but they don't believe it. Biden made that clear when he responded to the manufacturing worker who dared question his proposed 2A policies ("I don't work for YOU!").
Biden is senile and Kamal is willing to do anything for power and fortune. They are useful idiots. They serve those who have a Marxist agenda thereby making them “marxists”. Just semantics and hair splitting. Their agenda is a Marxist one whether they are on board or not.

The sheer amount of damage that Trump can and countinues to do is way worse than anything Biden/Harris could possibly fuck up. We can deal with “potentials,” but when you see Trump actively destroying the Postal Service, there’s absolutely a huge difference between the two.

Harris VP choice signals tougher stance on pollution under Biden - Reuters
Keep voting for people like Biden, or Trump and they'll make sure you stay like that ;)
I can, Biden just said all Americans will be mandated to wear masks outside. That’s idiotic when Fauci himself said it’s almost impossible to get the virus outside unless you’re sitting side by side with someone for a long period of time. I can prove it all
If you’re unhappy with how things are being handled by the Tr*mp Administration, then you gotta VOTE him out.   I don’t know what kind of change you’re expecting by straight-up not voting. I don’t like Biden/Harris either but I’m not a dumbass.
Also, Trump hasn’t started any wars in the Middle East, killing thousands of innocent Muslims with drone assasinations and locking them up indefinitely. That was W and Obama. You think Biden is going to change any of that?
Postal carriers union endorses Biden, warns that 'survival' of USPS is at stake
"Biden for President" Say no more.  You like kid sniffers, huh?
You mean like Biden doubling down on his ‘94 crime bill that locked up so many black for the same crimes Hunter got a pass on? Kamala giggling about smoking weed while jailing everyone else for possession? Kamala suing to keep innocent black men in prison?
Y’all are more concerned about how much you like this woman than making sure that Biden Wins 🙃
So you’re ok with cities burning, police getting rocks and balloons filled with urine Thrown at them all while Biden backs the people doing it? Are you ok with that? Are you ok with shootings up over 70% in NY, Chicago and Philly? Are you ok with abolishing the Police.

How bout the dems donate their donations to the USPS, since they’re so concerned about people voting now. I’m sure it would help the postal system run thru the election and putting senile Joe Biden on tv really isn’t helping anyway.
just depressing. has biden even said anything in effort to fight back? i know bernie wouldn’t be taking this laying down. he’d be on every single news show, fired up, making sure we’re all fired up. and we’d mobilizing and marching en masse in response.

This point here.👆 even to the extent that Biden wants to, the very fact that he’s not leading a literal cult means he won’t be able to get away with many of the things Trump does on a daily basis.

What it does show is that rather than being enthusiastically pro-war, Biden's primary concern was navigating Dems through what he saw as a political minefield.

Yep Donald and crew have them believing Biden got Dementia.  GO FIGURE !!!
Bush would have the authorization one way or another, the only question is if Dems could force him to compromise in a meaningful way. He failed at that, then threw in with the war. Biden's not a guy for lonely stands on principle, certainly.

I think Biden's vote should be seen mostly in light of "Biden as old school political operator." He saw opposition to the war not just as a political trap for his future ambitions, but also as practically pointless.
Complaining without a solution does nothing. It’s Trump or other. That’s your choice. Unless you want four worse years, then vote Biden. There is no room for a spirited debate here.
Biden promotes mail-in voting, swipes at Trump over Florida primary ballot  via
The other thing is that Biden did make the same noises about voting in favor of the measure as the best way to avoid war that many of his Dem colleagues were making, at least in his speech from the floor. At other times he may have been more gung ho.
This NYT piece goes into some detail about Biden. One thing it makes clear is that Biden knew Trump had the votes, so he was trying to craft a compromise that would give him a narrower mandate with more congressional oversight.
when will you guys insist on Biden taking questions from the press conference not knowing what the questions are these soft gloves have to come off you guys are showing your true colors
Now for the reat.  How does a court tell Hillary she does not have to be deposed?  She needs to be questioned on the record.  They are hoping Biden wins so they all get away with it.
Biden is pushing for a mask mandate, so if masks work so well what is the problem, go vote, wear a mask.
But the larger point was not about Joe Biden in particular.
I'd have to look back on the specifics of that one. Biden's Iraq policies in general were...unfortunate. I'd have to check to see where he was on a spectrum from extremely reluctant support (like Kerry) to extremely enthusiastic (like Lieberman). You may be right.
Well there's a 53% chance we will according to the latest NPR presidential poll that shows Biden at 53%  at 42%.
According to a new poll by Pew Research Center 56% of biden supporters only support him because he isn’t Trump.   Only 9% do so because of his policy positions.    people don’t seem to genuinely like you very much 😂
there are really a few black folks out here saying they’d rather stay with Trump than get Biden and I just cannot wrap my brain around that..🥴🥴🥴lmaooooowtfiswrongwithyallooooooooooooooooooo

No James. We’re voting for Biden.
I hope this flies too. What i like here, and Biden and Harris knows, Trump is losing among all groups, and the way the Democcrats are fighting Trump defunding the USPS.
There is something worse than a hypocrite. A person who repeals 100+ environmental regulations when there's an active climate crisis going. People in "cancer ally" are dying at faster and faster rate. Pretending like biden isn't factually better than trump on environment is bs.
Still dont understand why the Dem nominee isnt Bernie Sanders? He is healthier than Biden and it is his plan. Let Americans figure out what world we are going to be right know.
Everyone’s face when forced to choose between Joe Biden and Donald Trump
I hate Biden/Harris as much as the next person but you’re kidding yourself if you think that losing your trump again will cause any kind of internal reckoning for the Democratic Party. They’d rather stay corrupt and lose to republicans than actually work for the people

Can’t wait for Joe Biden to get the Nobel Peace Prize for this deal.
You are so right. Biden has been cheating all of his adult life, he should not ever be president of our great United States.
Right! The cause is moderate Democratic agreement that mail should be privatized &amp; an entrenched opposition to expanding USPS services (ala postal banking) as a left pipe dream.  What evidence do you see that a Biden admin wouldn’t listen to those same noxious Obama-era nominees?
Trump develops a worldwide consortium of private and public efforts to develop treatments and vaccines.  Builds hospitals, massive testing fix, etc.    Biden demands Govs require masks (just like Trump) and Kamala swoons over Biden's "leadership".

Interesting how Biden and Harris completely avoided mentioning the current destruction of NYC.
You actively participate in Never Biden accounts - people who think Latinx should children continue to die and disappear because they want a revolution.   I own my ugliness at laughing at people who brag about putting themselves in harms way - own your ghoulishness.
Nice stretch LYIN BIDEN. You're already finished, you just don't know it yet.
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden’s Running Mate
I thought it interesting how Biden and Harris completely ignored the current destruction of American cities by Antifa and BLM,and, instead, attempted to blame Trump for the consequences of the China virus.
The reality is that the Democratic Party has been insulting our intelligence since they decided on Biden. The revolution is coming regardless of who is in charge. I think it’s important to let everyone know that the people are dissatisfied.
Biden and Harris claims President Trump lied about China. China didnt lie we did. Hmmmm. Biden is too friendly with China. China would love to see him win. POTUS calls them on their bullshit
then why did you go right to Biden and not make Biden come get you you're not fighting anyone with your strategy
I’m in tears bc the Trump administration thinks biden/Harris is the radical left

Hearings aren’t gonna do shit. The only way to give us some semblance of time to fix this is to vote in person for Joe Biden, and then pressure him to do everything he can to make sure these people never win an elections again

Ok but your policy differences are a HELL of a lot different than what’s happening right now. You can’t just stomp your feet because you don’t have what you want. The fact that you can’t see the major HUMAN differences between Trump and Biden is distressing.

Mr. Biden, it goes without saying that Donald Trump is the worst president in United States history. However, saying is not enough. Something must be done directly just stop trump from stealing November’s election.
He isn’t, not on the environment. Factually. And that’s an end to it.   You think trump is less “bought out” than Biden? Have you seen the amount of lobbyists in trump’s admin?   Biden is horrible but NEVER normalize trump while you’re critiquing Biden.
I wonder if the Biden campaign intentionally bought the timing of that ad Univision just ran. Biggest audience of the week for the network this afternoon.
I haven’t done anything. But I do want to restore the vra (unlike republicans and like every democrat). I also want to expand healthcare, raise the minimum wage, raise taxes on rich, and reform the police like joe Biden.
A hit dog hollers.
That this member of the House's "Squad" won so dramatically bodes well for a gradual move to the left in the DNC on the issue of Israel. I'm upset (tho not surprised) that Biden approved the Israel/UAE deal and makes no mention of the occupation of Palestine!

Biden is campaigning on the fine people hoax... He means not run by a racist (soul of the country) who's incompetent etc.. (not my opinion).

Funny holding a blue heart and not a baby.  Biden for abortion.
Biden+ may have won the nomination without the not-insignificant progressive wing but they absolutely will not win the general without us and our ability to turn out less engaged(esp young)people around us. Assuming otherwise is condescending at best and stupid at worst.
And our VA system is horrible! Wait until we see what Biden will take off us if he ever got in! He already said it!

Senator Kennedy On Harris Becoming Biden’s VP Pick: She’s AOC ‘Without The Bartending Experience’ (VIDEO)
So true. Biden as a Presidential candidate, former VP &amp; lifelong politician, and Kamala Harris as a sitting Senator certainly could have offered alternate plans/suggestions to deal more effectively with this global pandemic. That's IF they had any. Obviously not. #CricketsTillNow
The last thing Trump wants is even a show trial that would allow Biden or anyone else to argue with his case in public. I just expect campaign ads.   Funny thing, though... All fo that would happen after early voting had started.
go ahead &amp; vote for Biden 🤷🏾‍♂️
You forgot a few.  Pedos wants Biden Satan wants Biden
I find it really funny when replicants say Harris/Biden are super liberal like this shit isn't the most moderate center ticket they could have tried selling like ya'll okay over there with 1/2 a brain cell?
, read Mr. Biden's transcript. It is chilling to hear him say "it’s not about your rights, it’s about your responsibilities as an American". No potential president should suggest a plan that might conflict with our rights.
"elect dems and then hold them accountable" makes some sense when they promise to do good things. like if biden ran on medicare4all (i guess) u could hold him accountable to that. but he's promised not to sign it, even if it got passed. so where does the accountability come in?
like at this point if you're calling biden and harris mom and dad or sexualizing them you need to do some serious introspection like this country's inability to process anything that isn't framed like a movie is appalling lol
The NYT has seriously learned nothing.  Leads w/ "is she unpopular?" Then, calls her staff an "entourage." The headline they really wanted: "Disliked Diva is Biden's VP Pick"
Doesn’t surprise me Biden has children working for him
The rich white kids screaming Never Biden don’t use USPS, mommy and daddy make sure everything gets sent to their precious lil babies FedEx overnight.
Trump applying his COVID testing theory to democracy....“We have more Biden votes cause we counted more ballots.  If we didn’t count so many ballots we wouldn’t have so many votes for Biden”
So funny to think that Biden will win when Hilary couldn’t. She got blown out btw.
Copycat. You plagiarize just like Biden
Yeah. I always thought that part of Obama’s trepidation about Biden running in 2016 was that he didn’t want to see him go through getting destroyed by Hillary.
Trump over Biden
Sure but if you’re foreign and telling Americans that Trump and Biden are the same, you’re feeding the delusions of rich white kids over here.
To late to little, they already backed Biden.  IMO this is just a BS Tweet to make them look like their not behind anything. They Envision a Blockchain rite before the election and stole machines to even be able to use a Blockchain on!
The House could impeach. And then the Senate spends time doing the trial, we know the outcome and while the trial is ongoing, Biden loses Harris on the campaign trail while all she can do is sit quietly for most of it.
You can very easily argue for a general strike while ticking an “X” for Biden if the strike fails. “Reality isn’t turn based.”
Can't stand Gretchen Whitmer. No fan of Liz Warren. But when it becomes a disadvantage to be white have we really advanced to that "color blind" society that supposedly makes us truly great? And then there's that whole thing about ovaries.  via

So what about the biden allegations??? With your logic he’s guilty too right? Or is he innocent because there’s no evidence? But Trump is guilty because you don’t like him!   Makes total sense!!!! 🤡
Just saw a guy say he won’t be voting but it’s okay, he’s part of the revolution - not fighting or arming leftists, no no, the revolution needs food so he tends a lil garden and Tweets about how Biden has dementia, and that’s his big contribution.  The left is fucked lol.
You still cooning after the primary? Why didn't Obama &amp; Biden reverse the law, passed by the GOP, which has engineered the defunding of the USPS since 2005? They had the U.S. House &amp; a 60 seat supermajority in the U.S. Senate, thanks to Independents Lieberman &amp;

I'm Jewish, so apparently now I'm allowed to be in the Biden category I guess that overrules me being older, white, and not college educated
The media will make up some numbers along the lines of “95% of bw voted for Biden, while only 80% of bm did”. This will give the left a silver bullet to blame bm for Trump getting re-elected and for bw to completely disassociate themselves from bm politically.
Joe Biden joined politics at the age of 29, he has been senator for many years, before becoming your VP for 8 years. What more do you have to know about him before voting for this immensely successful liberal politician? #BidenHarris2020 #VoteForJoe
I can tell you what might happen after November 4th (?) if Biden loses, and it won’t be pretty. It doesn’t even have anything to do with Trump.
I’m gonna say this, and be done with it.  I’m voting for Biden X Harris. Periodt.   I’m not really interested in ignoring the past of both candidates, yet I want to vote them in and hold them accountable then.
Biden is frozen in a stupor.
Horrible example and you don’t know what pence believes. What you do know is that Harris  1. Believes Biden is a rapist and a racist and still is happy to work with him or  2. She doesn’t and is a complete liar and just said it to just try and win a job over someone.  #Trash

biden == trump people have brain worms
Joe Biden is racist and thinks putting a black face in a high place is enough for people to vote for him. And for some it does work, but for radicals or people who want to hold politicians accountable it is not enough. She is an extension of white supremacy also.
Biden as next FDR = horribly sick yet hidden from the public
Biden has no idea what he is saying and his running mate flip flops when it suits her pandering.
The fact that people are trying to run with this point that a normal politician (Joe Biden) and a fascist megalomaniac (Trump) are the means to the same end need to consider what side that view is supporting, cuz it’s not the one you seem to think you’re fighting for.
Anything Trump does at this point which would be considered good, Biden will take credit for. Biden couldn’t broker a deal between 2 6 year olds let a lone foreign leaders.
If you just lie about voter suppression (which would ironically hurt Biden more) you can convince yourself of anything
He doesn't haves to give further detail about sh*t.U want further details then why don't y'all ask Joe Biden why he suggested to the FBI that they should charge a 3 star General with the Logan Act n why was he n Obama being briefed on an investigation by the FBI director anyways?
And Biden should make no effort to appease progressives and try to earn their vote, rather, people should just stfu and support him even if he has nothing to offer them! Cool political ideas dude !
Obama disappointed me so much after I voted for him twice. As a Bernie type guy this article actually makes me for the first time really WANT to vote for Biden. I hope Biden values the loyalty Bernie gave him by quickly dropping out and endorsing him.  Great article.
The real revolutionaries are dead or jailed (mumia). The ones that have survived into modernity (free), comfy  doing press (YouTube shows) with “progressives”, telling you to vote for Biden, made a calculus to survive/parlay their infamy into celebrity.
I genuinely want to know. Are we telling people not to vote for Biden and therefore vote for Trump? Or are we telling them they shouldn’t vote for anyone and not care who’s in office?
If Biden wins his jail time will b quite short.

Friendly reminder that, while of course it’s absurd for progressive people to be excited about Biden and Kamala, even being able to think about not voting comes from a place of privilege. The presidential nominee runs deeper than just the position on the ballot
Not the first time Biden plagerized someone!
About time WTF !! Will any of those bad cops and treasonous scum who tried a coup attempt and lied 17 times to the FISA courts to spy on Trump be held accountable??? THEY ALL SHOULD BE IN JAIL ESPECIALLY COMEY, that weirdo and lover who got caught in their text messages, Biden 2

Kamala Harris' Popularity Surges Across Board After Biden Pick: Poll #SmartNews
Biden has answered questions throughout his 40 years of public service. It was day one of the Biden/Harris ticket. Biden has been in public service about the same amount of time that Trump has been a criminal.
Large solid red counties that may flip to Biden: Maricopa, AZ; Johnson, KS; Duval, FL; Virginia Beach, VA.  If it's a particularly good night for Biden, Tarrant, TX, too.
You can TRY to convince me to vote for Biden and Harris, but don’t gaslight me. They’re not progressive. They’re both centrists, conservative Democrats. Neoliberals. I’m an anarchist, find someone else to convince. I’ve been radicalized since I was homeless in elementary school
What rock were you sleeping under for 8yrs Obama n Biden did absolutely nothing for this country except try to racially divide
Why can't we believe in what we want to? Do we not have freedoms? Why would I want to follow a group that supports mask wearing another 3 months outside? Outside? Violent protests, in coercion with BLM and Antifa? Biden had his 8 years to make change.
I want Trump out of office so he can not appoint more conservative judges and strip more environmental regulations. The longer he’s in, the greater legacy he will leave that will take decades to fix.   That is the ONLY reason im voting for biden.
Vote for Biden
Thanks
I thought you were supposed to be a #Christian . The #Bible say in the  Thou shall not lie. What do you call this.
I really wonder how your life has been worse under Trump? Not including a global pandemic from China. Biden has been in politics for 47 years- now he is going to save the country with Harris by his side??? You can’t possibly believe that????? But really-how has ur life been worse
Have to vote Biden bro. Once trump is gone decent R's can rebuild the party and take it back. Voting anything but Biden ensures that doesn't happen.
The Biden team bailing out protesters is a false claim.  Mail in ballots are the way to go in the pandemic. Are you not at all concerned about public safety? Leave the anger alone for one moment and think.
Where did you get an n95 mask?
. Maybe you should worry about the 250k-400k patients you doctors kill every year by medical mistakes.  I bet you are going to vote for Biden too.
I think we need a two pronged approach: push back against journalists &amp; news outlets that give it space, &amp; a forceful, one-time response from Kamala Harris &amp; Joe Biden. I think Harris should get a federal judge to certify her citizenship—Chief Justice Roberts would be ideal.
Biden never said he was going to pick a Black woman for his VP. He said he was going to pick a woman. Both Gretchen Whitmer and Warren made the final 4 along with Susan Rice. Like how are you so ill informed about this, isn't it your job?
Whoa!! Feisty!! ObamaCare is pretty F’n Huge!! - Joe Biden

She said she endorsed Biden. Is this being reported anywhere? I mean, I wouldn’t be completely astonished but she came quickly out of the gate for Joe.
.  &amp;  More "anchor/reporters" at   must get a paycheck from  everything is Biden great and Trump bad.   is senile. He will be in a nursing home by Jan 2021.
IMO, the amount of "yeah, I guess I'm on board with Biden-Harris but let me first list all the ways they disappoint me" takes this week is all energy that should be spent on the USPS fiasco.   Republicans get in line and that's why they win.  GET IN FORMATION, DEMS.
Saw my first Biden sign in Philadelphia today.   It read “ByeDon 2020”
A political cartoonist might draw Joe Biden pulling on a leash with a pretty pitbull Kamala straining to go at Donald . She is more than twenty years younger than Joe, its good that she shows more energy sometimes, he is comfortable with her, and her connection to Beau bonds them
For someone who claims that Trump has been characterized incorrectly and pickedon by everyone, you certainly have spewed your share of name calling, misinformation and mis-characterizations of both Biden and Harris. I hope Trump is paying you enough for turning in your integrity.
In late June, Joe Biden claimed President Donald Trump “wants to cut off money for the post office so they cannot deliver mail-in ballots.” At the time, we wrote that Biden had no evidence of Trump’s ulterior motive — but now he does.
While the whole country fights to get our of this historic recession triggered by Trump's failures, this is from his top economic adviser: "You want to help the blue-collars, cut the corporate tax rate."
The arrogant who never give up thinking they are right and the stupid who take Trumps words face value. Just talked to trumpers in family. Discussed tax break with underlying hollowing SS  and Medicare. Had no clue. Shocked now angry. Another vote for Biden
What you have just said is morbidly inaccurate. Sure, they suck. They've done a lot of those things. Absolutely, but not all of those things and not to the extent Trump and his cronies have. They're not the same- at all. If Biden/Harris win we can't assume the fight is over.
Here’s some of what Obama/Biden did: cut unemployment from 10% to 4.7% over six years, provided health insurance to over 20 million uninsured Americans, Ended the war in Iraq, Ordered for the capture and killing of Osama Bin Laden,Passed the $787 billion America Recovery and

Obama knows that and still supports Biden so it’s fuck him to right?
I agree with you Geraldo. I would even go a step further and not even mention Biden’s name. I would say “The Leftist Candidate”. Biden would need to get out of the basement for people to know he is running. Trump makes him relevant. Without Trump,  doesn’t exist.
Newsflash #BidenHarris2020 voters, rather than browbeating undecideds why not browbeat #Biden into committing to enact #M4A?   That would go a way to making him more electable. 87% of the Democrat base wants it. We're in the middle of a pandemic with 160K+ dead.   Why won't he?
What did Joe Biden say on February 1st of this year?  Specifically about Trump's travel ban.
Will collapse? You know...."will" isnt past tense right?? You should say "has collapsed" and Biden wasnt president when it happened....🤨
Right between the eyes 🤜.
Now don’t nobody like Biden but ain’t nobody say anything when he was Obama Vice President 🤔
it's almost like Evans was just waiting for Biden to swoop in &amp; take M4A off the table...

Nate Silver: we've studied this for a very long time, and the conclusion we've come to is that Biden could win. Or Trump could win. Really this could go either way, because I qualify each result so much that I communicate nothing and am not capable of actually projecting results.
Plenty of anti-Biden ads running on streaming services here.
Like when Obama and Clinton were endorsed by police unions?  Biden was going to get the endorsements..which you had no problem with until Trump got them.  Hypocrisy much?
First anti Biden TV ad ive seen in Pennsylvania, saying he wants to ban fracking. I don’t think he actually does. But I warned the bad optics of that are not captured in “for / against fracking” polls
No im ticked because thats wrong, yes I am voting for Biden but im not going to leave people in the dirt. This virus doesnt care about politics and if we dont get it under control Dr. Fauci said it WILL BE WORSE than the Spanish Flu in 1918
I jog outdoors for exercise. Without a mask, keeping distance from others I'm for masks worn at indoor locations outside of the home. Or at outdoor events where there are a lot of people. But I hope Biden doesn't mean he wants us wearing masks outdoors at all times for 3 months.
You know im voting for the first time, im voting for Biden no matter what, but you must be prepared for ANYTHING Trump has to throw at us. I know his tactics, but with the new things coming out, we need to watch closely
Old Joe is about to get thrown under the bus.  This campaign is all about getting her into position to run president.  If I was a democrat I’d be pissed.   Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report
You are seeing what im saying, that we have to be prepared to back Biden and Harris no matter what happens. THIS IS A FIGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY BACK FROM A POWER HUNGRY NARCISSISTIC TO BE DICTATOR!!! BIDEN MUST WIN IF THE USA IS TO SURVIVE AS A NATION!!!
Biden will have the military remove him if he doesnt leave, thats the law btw if he isnt out by January 20th
No he is going to crash it even worse, read this article  its been his plan all along!!!!
Also Trump is going to crash the economy with crashing the DOW JONES when Biden wins and then blaming it on him
yeah but its going to be blackmailing Biden, and Trump refuses to leave office
Yeah the world is suffering due to Trump, America is waking up thank God so the hell will be over November 3rd. We need all the support for Biden and Harris as possible. Trump gonna blackmail them by crashing the DOW JONES after Biden takes office then blaming it on him.
It’s been 5 months now and these assholes can’t give us a reason to vote for Biden aside from shrieking about Trump.
The Biden mask campaign is smart--and not just from a public health stance. It's politically smart, because it puts Trump in a corner. Trump either has to agree with Biden, or contradict himself &amp; health authorities on mask wearing.
fivethirtyeight has biden likely to win in a bunch of those states, including: NC, Arizona, wisconsin. Even Florida. Thoughts??
It's utterly fitting that Governor "The-Constitution-is-above-my-pay-grade-Murphy" is co-chairing the Democratic convention.  is arguably the dumbest of Democrat Governors, therefore particularly qualified to introduce Harris and Biden.
“I don’t think he really cares about what a 30-something Pod Save America host thinks about him, and that honestly might be why he’s the nominee.”
Expect the national polls to narrow in the coming weeks/months. What matters is polling in key swing states, like MI, WI, PA. If Biden can win those 3 states, he'll win the presidency.
Before the rage, fear, and shame set in, the sting of Trump/Pence winning will be temporarily nullified by Biden/Harris losing.
I’m really taking aback by the # of conservatives (such as the guest) openly talking about how they don’t believe Biden will survive his 1st term or even make it to the election. The current POTUS is obese, eschews healthy food and exercise. Not the picture of health.
Rasmussen put Trump at 40% black support a few wks back. Trump won 2016 with 8% of the black vote.  No way is Basement Biden losing to POTUS.
Fact check: Trump promotes another birther lie, this time about Kamala Harris
Im a bad ass man for Biden
Joe Biden calls for a nationwide mask mandate as he pushes his plan to combat coronavirus: “It’s not about your rights. It’s about your responsibilities as an American.”
Let the ASSHOLES look into it. And then the truth will come out. The IDIOT is just trying to find anything he can wrong against BIDEN/HARRIS with the help of the R/Putin. Some guy I heard on radio was bitching about Harris lying wed. in her speech. What about Don everyday?
Given the binary choice of Trump and Biden, I’d choose Biden every time. #CountryOverParty

We will be able to breathe a sigh of relief when Biden takes office. Its been so depressing here in the USA since we cant have much other human contact. Its depressing and honestly I have meltdowns everynight cuz im ASHAMED of being an American
I see the pumping of her 'Indian heritage' is in full swing... wish I could have seen her do that during the primaries, she would have beaten Biden... lol
You have three choices. Sit out the election, vote for Trump, or vote for Biden. Our earth can’t take another 4 years of Trump.
Remember in 2008 when the media viewed the race between Barack Obama and John McCain as a very close race?  Yeah, 2020 is nothing like that.  Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are going to blow Donald Trump out of his bunker.
The context that the graph lacks is that Trump is literally using fascist's tactics. While Biden's centrism is maddening and his paternalistic nonsense is cringe worthy, he is not a fascist like Trump.   And that is the rub this election cycle.
From this moment forward, when I find myself thinking about trump or his idiotic behavior I will quickly switch to pouring good energy into Biden/Harris. Before there was no dream. No I can see a future!

Just when I think the gaping anal orifice can not do any more damage...he does. Let us all hope that Biden/Harris take back the WH and McConnell gets flushed down the political sewer of "hasbeen".
Again, please vote for Biden, but know that it may not make any difference, because he is blatantly saying he's sabotoging the elction on live TV. His administration recently established that they have no qualms about using a secret police force to intimidate and punish us.
The world has never laughed at the US as they do now. No major leader picks up your phone calls-all waiting for this nightmare to pass. Is Biden able to fix all the ties that you have broken? Doubt it, but at least he won't destroy what little that remains.
Trump on Biden: "He doesn't know anything, but he knew everything!"

Wow.  You people are fucking weird.  You believe stupid stuff.  The Recession began under the Bush presidency.  There was a recovery bill, but no provision for giving funds to individuals.  Obama-Biden then built the longest lasting economic expansion in us history.
Most people don’t enjoy interacting with those who disagree with them. The fact that Joe Biden was willing to select as his running mate someone who is not afraid to challenge him speaks volumes. Obviously he has the strength of character to process criticism - quite an asset.
"It's not clear how often Joe Biden is receiving these briefings, but even one weekly briefing would mean he's getting filled in more often than Donald Trump is lately, according to a HuffPost report."
How childish can Trumps campaign be. Not only is Biden still going to pass Trump &amp; beat him, he won't resort to cartoons to do it.
I love the sound of this headline. I hope that on November 3rd we all can say we absolutely hammered Trump. ----------------------------------  Read This: "Biden Welcomes Kamala, Who Absolutely Hammers Trump"

We Got a Black Woman on the Ticket. At Last.
I’m no fan of Biden but his platform calls for nationwide decriminalization of cannabis and expunging all cannabis-related convictions, and ending prison time for drug-use.
As a leftist, I’m not very enthused. Biden and Harris were near the bottom of my list (above Bloomberg). I’ll still be voting for them, though.
1) if you are talking about Biden it was not. In fact it was one of his more enthusiastic speeches. 2) I’m sooo happy to hear coherent sentences again! 3) your boi: covfefe, hamberder, Nambia, Yo Semite, ThighLand...

I’ll be voting Biden/Harris. There are ppl, some progressives particularly, who are frustrated &amp; disappointed, rightfully so in some ways. Listening &amp; understanding is more persuasive than shaming, insulting,&amp; belittling people. That’s not helpful for November or the future.
Now that Biden has picked Harris to be his VP thats going to change really quickly
Im right with you Kamala!!! LETS DEFEAT TRUMP ONCE AND FOR ALL AND NEVER LET HIM IN THE WHITE HOUSE AGAIN!!! #BidenHarris2020Landslide Im so glad Biden picked you because you got what it takes to get things DONE and DONE RIGHT
Thought Biden had a good shot at winning in November, but it is clear now that the Democratic party is split on supporting Biden as a canidate after his VP announcement.  Unity behind Republican party and lack of by democrats is a sure way to have Trump re-elected.
Yup, that's what I thought. Harris wasn't Biden's pick.
Yes. He absolutely does. I don’t understand why you think differently. You have three choices; sit out the election again, vote for Biden or vote for Trump. Which candidate gives you a better shot of including progressives?  Better to be on the inside than looking in..

same thing i made of the dems chosing biden in the first place.
The only reason I think Biden should debate Trump is because if he doesn't the GOP will say Joe was afraid. Get them up there and let Biden obliterate trump. Let trump show the world how smart Joe is.

BBC News - Biden's VP pick: Why Kamala Harris embraces her biracial roots
It’s so boring, and so predictable. No matter who Biden selected, they would be saying it was the worst possible pick, he’s an idiot, it ensures a Trump victory in November. #yawn
How will Joe Biden and Kamala Harris play with the far left that seems to be in firm control of the Democratic Party? Joe wrote the laws and Kamala enforced them. Doesn't that seem contradictory to the defund and eliminate police movements? It's going to be interesting to watch!
And this is interesting.   Ayaan Hirsi Ali calls out Biden for quoting Muhammad pronouncing Sharia law in remarks to Muslim voters
I’m pretty sure Biden could just sit there and slobber through an entire debate and the brainwashed Twitterites will tell us how and why Joe Biden won the argument. You people need help.
This is a conundrum. A person who has been disrespectful &amp; nasty to Joe Biden accuses another person of being nasty &amp; disrespectful to Joe Biden. Does this person like or dislike Joe Biden? Given a chance, would they attack or defend Joe? Are they a friend or foe?
Biden sucks, imo he was the worst option &amp; the establishment pushed him 2 the nom. He's makin a slam dunk win into a contest w/his gaffes. I'm no fan of Harris cuz of her cringe record in CA. BUT  1st: fascist dumbass &amp; bible nazi need 2 go. Vote'm out then fight 2 push B&amp;H left
I already got one ordered.
How Biden selected Kamala Harris as his running mate
If Biden wins, the second he is sworn in the 25th Amendment will remove him &amp; Harris will take over. The far left’s plan all along has been to get a black female in the White House. They can’t do it thru the campaign process so they used smoke &amp; mirrors (Biden) to get it done.

I wont be needing the tissues hun, you will be needing them America is waking up and tired of Trumps dictatorship!!! #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica

Guess who I thought Biden would pick
now do joe biden
Obama picked Biden to appease racists.
I can't wait to make fun of president Biden every day.
I hear ya man, but a vote against Biden no matter whether or not it’s for a legitimate 3rd party candidate( Definitely got to get away from a just a two party system and IMO we really need to but after this election cause it’s too late for 2020) is a vote for a Trump.
Dude...she fell inline just like everyone else and publicly backed Biden. This ain't the way to go about this. Dems out here trying to be aligned and people are talking about Tulsi??? Is this High School?
Biden certainly wasn’t my first choice that’s for sure, but I do kind of like Harris. Too early to tell though. I like her over Pence just in case both have dementia...
I think they both suck, but I think Biden is the lesser of two evils. At least he isn’t trying to delegitimize the vote and democracy. BS proganda. We’ve voted by mail since civil war. Trump votes by mail. To get a ballot you have to register. MIV can’t be altered like machines.

I just love  She was my primary vote. I can’t wait to see where she lands in the Biden/Harris administration.
both #CNN and #MSNBC are ignoring you to cover Biden's VP pick. How's the ego?
You picked  and  when you have #Bernie   Biden couldn't even pronounce her damn name. This is pathetic.
No, privilege is voting for someone like Biden who has made a career out of putting POC in jail and trying to cut benefits of poor people. Try again, Karen.
I can be excited for Kamala while still processing and grieving the fact that it’s Biden, right? 😖😬😏
I saw a column asking what we NeverTrump ex-Republicans want from Biden and Democrats in exchange for our support.  The answer? Nothing. Not a damn thing.
Wow.  Biden picking Kamela Harris make’s Trump’s stupid ploy with Kanye look pretty dumb.  Dont you realize our party is going to get hit by a political Tsunami of historical proportions come November?  And it’s our fault, for supporting a fool.
No now it is Biden/Harris 2020 go blue

So, like, is it plausible Biden forgot about the stuff going on with police? Even a little bit? That's my theory.

Kamala being the VP nominee is just another reason not to vote for Biden. The DNC continues to give us the finger and then they cry when we won’t vote for them.
and now she’s his running mate. these people all fucking suck
There go my dreams of the Biden-Fetterman ticket. Guess I owe some folks some coffee.
How long until Biden says “You go girl”.
Boo-yah! I can't get my Biden/Harris lawn sign fast enough.
Biden was never going to pick someone that is progressive. This isn't surprising. 🤷🏾‍♀️
Way To Go Biden
Biden was tired of Republicans trashing him for defunding the police, so he picked a cop as his running mate
I am thrilled! Biden/Harris2020!
The bottomline is that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will only work to serve working-class people in response to pressure from mass movements and people’s organizations. It’s our job to build those movements and organizations. Let’s go.
Love the VP pick by Biden. Great 1st round selection.
People could vote in person. A postal worker changed ballots already this year and the postal union endorsed Biden so...
Just reading on PBS app news, Lard Ass said that by choosing a woman as V.P Biden is insulting men. WHAT!!!
If Biden picks Kamala as VP I'm actually going to lose my mind
Biden hasn’t ruled anyone in, or out, it’s being done for him. I honestly don’t believe Biden knows what day it is, and I’ll bet he won’t debate anyone on stage in front of an audience.
Just had a 20 minute convo with a woman who voted for Trump. We talked about education &amp; healthcare. She said she is now probably going to vote for Biden. Anyway, phone banking is important and it’s how we’ll win!! 84 days left, folks. Have you signed up for a shift?
Just had this disc w/a coworker. I told him prob w/Susan Rice is her exp is in foreign affairs and Biden is fine in that area already. Need someone to compliment him w/domestic exp and who can work w/the Senate. I also think Kamala was asked by Obama to be AG &amp; she turned it down
Biden who?!Suggesting Biden is “far left” is lunacy. And yes, most Biden supporters want the lying racist with no focus, other than himself... out.   I would vote for almost any national Republican, if they were against Trump for the right reasons.
It doesn't matter how but you need to vote. No vote is wasted. Biden must win to save our country and the future of our country
“What is even Biden’s platform?” asks person not looking at the campaign website, reading interviews, or understanding the role the press plays in disseminating info
I hope you guys realize that every Democrat president since 1932 has left office with better economy and higher market than when they took office. Every single recession was after 8 years of Republican president. Look it up. You would rather have Biden

If Biden gets elected into office, I wear a black cap stating: Freedom is not Free" , he gets elected, my cap will change to: Welcome to Communism" with lady liberty broke in half!!
If Biden gets elected, we are going under as a nation. Biden was Obama vice president. He will continue with Obama legacy. The woman was picked by the Democrats in the house. Biden wanted someone else. Country will be f&amp;$ if Biden wins.
I just learned that Joe Biden bought my baby brother ice cream once. It’s still fuck Biden tho
Postal workers union Endorses Biden
Major US postal workers union endorses Biden for president
Bad guy for Biden
You gotta love "Friedman," who states that in a Trump arranged peace negotiation between Israel and the UAE that Biden is somehow a big winner.   ...OK.   It is pure partisanship.
When biden resigns
Want your old job back? Man, I miss you. I can not wait until I can say President Biden
Biden-Harris, the bellwethers of reform and progressive politics. Just say blue team good, orange man BAD. It would offend my intelligence less. Cause those two waffle more than a box of Eggos.
Make the RIGHT ONE!! Biden &amp; Harris 🇺🇸
When  is elected president, what sort of Supreme Court nominee will she pick? One that has actually read the constitution! #VoteForHer #LetHerSpeak #FridayFeeling
Trump is talking about Snowden in a transparent, cynical attempt to get left wing voters to support him over Biden. This avenue of attack is only available to him because Obama stupidly refused to pardon Snowden
When are we going to have a legitimate press Corp? This bunch challenged President Trump usurping power of state gov when implementing covid19 guidelines &amp; protest/riots. Biden/Harris make a mask mandate ignoring states w/hardly any covid cases! Press quiet!
I'm sure people had a chance to listen to Biden and could immediately notice the unmistakable difference. Biden shows us what's been missing. #BidenHarris   Biden expands lead over Trump to double digits: poll
And yet she will be running the country if the Dems get what they want because of Biden’s decline
One thing I like about Trump/Pence is that they totally trust and respect each other and say uplifting things about each other. This Biden/Harris combination is fake and distrustful, we know there is no comradery or trust between them.
I still see those awful America First action ads here but have seen very few official Trump ones.  Am bombarded with Biden ones.
Yet I don't care for the Pedophile rumors because most of Washington's politicians are Pedophiles. I'm more concerned about Biden's racist rhetoric through the years. That's my main concern because America is triggered now over race, Biden is a lit match put to gasoline.
Making up a word minimizes what this really is. It’s not “birtherism” it is... racism.
Sounds like Trump America. President Biden will have his work cut out for him
You have an interesting definition of justice. "While millions of Americans are crying out for criminal justice reform, Joe Biden has hired Kamala Harris, a candidate with an abysmal record of fighting for justice and working people."  #VoteForHer #LetHerSpeak
Ha Biden and Harris are the furthest a dem could be from socialism 😂 I wish they were socialists
Trump promotes another birther lie, this time about Kamala Harris
The Biden thread on the DSA messageboard is so cursed.
You didn't build that!
#SeanHannity Good montage of Joe Biden being completely inappropriate with women. Either he has no sense at all or he is a groper. The kind of man women avoid!
Oh I have a stepsister in Florida who's also voting Biden
My whole immediate family (PA): Biden
I can not wait until I can say President Biden
Biden looks like Jim Carey from the mask, and kamala Harris looks like Eric stoltz also ironically in Mask.
Oh we're back to Jade helm and the knockout game.    I said a few months ago, Biden winning is the ending of Empire Strikes Back, not the end of Return of the Jedi.

Can you believe it? We can as we have lived in Trump land for almost four years. He doesn’t care about people only himself and his millionaire friends. His supports are crazy and believe anything he says. I long for this countryto go back to normal and I hope Joe Biden wins!
This is enough of an election win for Trump, Biden has already issued a PR in support. Trump won Middle Eadtern Policy, NO RUSH!   Don't move further with SA! GREAT JOB! Remember what MBS is capable of and what leverage he already has on the US.  Israel will LOVE you even more...
So when are you going to endorse  You obviously aren't supporting Trump and you can't very well support Biden so what are you waiting for? #JoJorgensen2020 #ImWithHer #LetHerSpeak #Election2020 #LP2020
is correct.  I am simply saying that Biden did not choose based on qualifications.  I'm sure she is perfectly qualified.  He picked her simply because of the votes that she could get him.
Tlaib won't even endorse Biden, Rafe.
Biden calls for mandate everyone is to wear mask. Who the hell told him he was president
No! Biden is a racist so his wife must be as well or think alike in most ways. So it will be a downgrade.
Joe Biden had no more input than you or I in picking his VP. His mental decline prevents him making any but the simplest decisions. Harris was picked by the behind the scenes handlers who dress, feed, and keep Joe medicated enough for his rare public appearances.
Did you see the bumper sticker on the Biden "train"? It says "Your hair smells terrific".
It was refreshing, that the announcement by Joe Biden of Kamala Harris as his VP. There’s no name calling or bullying and especially the lying of facts ! No mention of this classy introduction. Thank You Joe, VOTE 💙
Why keep saying Biden has dementia when it's clear he doesn't?
With that said, that's my personal take on the matter and I'm not about to tell anyone what they should do with their vote, especially if they live somewhere like California or New York that's going to go to Biden whether they show up or not.
I also think it's important to note that whether you think Kamala Harris should or shouldn't be Biden's VP pick, she is a woman born to a South Asian mother and Jamaican father. This moment is huge in ways I've never even had to think about.
I honestly thought Biden was going to pick Tulsi Gabbard.  Oh. I almost forgot,  shes not a woman of color.
Trump showing off the workings of a love-hate relationship with Fox. The insults to MSNBC and CNN are old now. The ballots will be cast on November 3rd.  It's 81 days and 15 hours from now. He ought to be getting nervous, because Biden was full throttle yesterday.#BidenHarris2020
WATCH: New Trump ad hammers Biden/Harris over Joe&amp;#8217;s endless array of racial gaffes   This how you hate Just listen to how they think of us. Their should be no doubt in your mind now
I really don't think she can stand the calmness and focus that Joe Biden has. She sees it as a threat, and she's scared.
Nothing like wishing someone well. Maybe they should be talking about anyone else, just anyone. What a horrible thing to say about Joe Biden, implying that he gets sick or dies, or whatever. Pirro is a sick woman. Why does Fox News keep taking her back?
It just hit me why Trump was so obsessed with pointing out Harris attacking Biden during the debates. It's not because he's trying to sow contempt, it's because if he was talked back to like that he would lose his shit. Especially if the person who was critical of him was a woman
That leader isn't Joe Biden.

You do realize Biden can’t read or complete a sentence.
Yeah I’m gonna vote for Biden/Kamala. Yeah I’m gonna try to get people to vote for them. Yeah I’m going to continue to vocally criticize them and their horrid platform.
Herman Cain. Let him rest in peace. He was caught up in Trump's crazy ideas. It will be good to have Biden bring us back to reality. Maybe if Herman Cain had worn a mask, he could have had a few more years. Thank the anti-masker, Trump, for the poor example.
So what makes you quilifed more than Ben than sir? I do believe all he is a constitutional conservative as are you and I myself am as well with a libertarian streak. So I'm pretty sure we are all qualifed well at least more than Biden and Harris
Biden says campaign raised $26 million in one day since Harris joined the ticket
Yea and not alot of them are following we know what joe Biden is about and it's not good for the country
Nothing but the utmost respect for you my friend. In the 1 year of campaigning and subsequent 8 years in office Obama nor Biden ever thought of Erie.  has been here twice, sent federal $, and 5 cabinet members (I’ve got to meet 3). Your tweet is about Pittsburgh.

Harris makes case against Trump in first speech as Biden's running mate
It is not racist to ask this question. This is the second highest office in America. I expect Biden to pony up facts too.. If I were running for the office I would already have handed over proof to the press. Race has no issue here. only facts. Every leader should

No. A third party vote is a vote for the third party candidate, and against Biden and Trump. No rockets. No science.
As Al Davis said just win baby . Joe Biden is my favorite Vice President
You seem confused, I am by no means a liberal... a Classic Libertarian ok. Biden and Harris are a joke. The fact that CNN has gone all in and keeps telling us how much they raised in 24 hrs. This is a sh%t show.
Joe Biden's lies are legendary. He's still the same dishonest plagiarist...  via
Tucker is right. America will crash and burn and if you think the "Negro" under a Biden Presidency will fair better think again. The black community will see massive poverty. For not many fully understand how wealth operates in America and the world.
Trump and Biden seem to be playing a never ending game of "oh yeah,  hold my beer". Everytime you turn around they think up a new way to alienate voters.  Maybe they WANT you to vote  #ImWithHer #LetHerSpeak #Election2020
Joe Biden is completely tone deaf. Millions of people  #protesting against the police state and Biden picks a corrupt cop as a running mate. #VPPick #JoJorgensen2020 #LetHerSpeak
"I believe Joe Biden's Accusers." "18 - 24-year-olds are stupid."  Just two [of many] reasons to vote Green.
In many real ways just based on policy Trump will burn us down a lot faster, but Biden most certainly will not stop the burning. At best he will make it ... palatable
So you ask about short-term. There is no short-term. Radical changes are needed now end no one is willing to do them. Not Biden and Harris certainly. this is not purity, this is survival and I mean that quite literally and earnestly.
Like it’s okay that we are voting Biden-Harris but please understand that neither one of them are good people or have made good decisions in politics
We are in a shitty SHITTY position because we believe both candidates are wrong for the US, and however we vote (for Biden and ruining our integrity, for third-party and maybe giving Trump four more years) is EATING US ALIVE. And, yes, we're getting defensive about it.

Do you really want Trump to win? I don’t see where I have any choice but to vote Biden. I agree that Bass is more progressive than Harris. I don’t like everything about ANY candidate EVER, but I don’t think our country will survive 4 more years of Don the Con.

women on the view not addressing the issues of the day keep showing repeats of previous shows. No backbone or spine. Avoiding Kamala Harris issues costly choice for Biden.
It's amazing to see the immediate racist and misogynistic blowback from the far right over Kamala Harris being Biden's VP.  It's their playbook at this point: she's not black. She's instituting sharia law. She's a Marxist. She's not a citizen.  It's just disgusting.
Who is Kamala Harris? A look at Joe Biden's vice presidential running mate
She was picked because she's a "Woman" and a "Person of Color".  Biden focused on gender and race, just like he said he would do. I don't know about her "Qualifications", I haven't seen any.
Trump/Pence or Biden/Harris — these just different sides of the same coin, regardless of who win, do for self is my message
Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate
Notice that Biden did not pick an African American running mate. Plus notice also his absolutely open racist past. Even befriending very controversial racist legislators in government and refused to apologize for his friendships, his racist comments through his career.
And so begins the next wave of misogyny, racism, and all around stupidity. If you say Biden lost your vote because he chose Kamala Harris, come one. Admit that you just want to vote for Trump. Seriously. Kamala is more qualified than either Trump or Pence. FFS. So is a teapot.
I didn't know they were investigating Biden. It's about time they started hammering these pedophiles and Rapists in our Government!
These are legit reasons why I don't like Harris and why she was at the bottom of my Biden VP list...This night rattled here in was the beginning of the end of her campaign...That said, no matter who Biden picked I'm voting for him...I'm voting to get #FascistTrump out.
FUN FACT: Kamala is technically a Boomer, Biden is not
Not feeling how  on  is handling Kamala’s debate against Biden. I don’t remember Biden being critiqued on his debate and criticism against Obama 🤔. Why the double standards.
Maybe Trump could go biking with Biden.
Kamala Harris is not just a VP for black women, she is a VP for all American citizens of all genders and colors. We should see her as someone who will accept all of us, not just part of us, and someone who will work with Biden for all without bigotry.

Happy 83 days until the election. Read up on the Biden and Harris ticket. Be informed so that you can best make your decision and then VOTE.
I thought Biden was Catholic?
Harris Didnt even Poll over Andrew Yang in her own state. Biden just lost the election... Harris is weak and attack able. And they will tear her apart. The critical states ignored. #Wisconsin #Michigan #Pennsylvania #Minnesota Just one VP pick from that region would have made it
Sooo fucking True. this man was very Smart and he knew who the real enemy is. Neither Biden Or Trump will fix your world. educate yourselves stand up and take your shit back. They are both evil corporate pricks. #Howie2020

#Biden Harris 2020. I feel oh so good!
It's the same people who say "Biden is going to lose" or "Biden cannot win." Well no shit if you say that and don't support him that's going happen. Why not instead of just giving up lend him your vote. Maybe if you showed encouragement instead of giving up your vote would matter
One retweet I saw today said, to paraphrase, "whoever Biden picks as his VP is going to be bad."  Well not shit they're going to seem bad to you if you go into it like that. I am a pessimistic person, but the pessimism on the internet is another level. Nothing is ever good enough
You were my presidential pick all along! Congratulations!!! I'm so excited to have Biden/Harris unite and fix this country and bring it back to greatness!!! Best of luck!! You got this!!!! ❤🤍💙❤🤍💙❤🤍💙❤🤍💙

If Joe  Biden was truly part of the radical left then the radical left would embrace and endorse him. Like White Nationalists and the KKK embrace and endorse Donald Trump. #BidenHarris2020
Let me make one thing vehemently clear: I support Joe Biden. I trust him and believe he represents the Dems well. Once again, is he perfect? No. But he is a damn good choice. And I support Kamala Harris as his VP. I stand by this. I would stand by this if it wasn't against Trump.
Am I doing this out of fear for Trump? Heck yeah. Because I do not want to see someone who has utterly torn this country apart get re-elected. And I will gladly criticize Biden if he is elected and does something dumb as should be, but I am not going to laud it over him (9/?)
If Biden and his campaign is willing to get someone who went after him, imagine what other voices he can pick to fill out his cabinet. They definitely won't all be white yes-men who will rollover to whatever their boss demands them to do. Trust me, they really won't be (8/?)
Again: I. Am. Not. Saying. Don't. Criticize. In fact, Kamala did it to Biden, and Gabbard did it to Kamala. Do you not think they took that to heart? Did you also know that there are other members of the cabinet of the president, and they have voices too? (7/?)
As a Country we have something to give us happiness and joy❣️ Joe Biden and  V.P pick Kamala Harris 🇺🇸💙 #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica  #BidenHarris2020

Why do you think it took so long to pick someone? Waited as long as possible to give a name to open criticism of the most important VP pick of all time since Biden will not be president the entire 4 years if he wins
So awesome Biden and Harris #BidenHarris2020
#vppick Biden has chosen Kamala Harris as his vp pick. Remember her threat" we know who you are and we will be coming for you". Another democrat vendetta like Russia hoax and phoney fisa warrants.
there you have it a dictator in action. I am no fan of Kamala Harris but I will say this if and I say if she can be a real human and this goes for both Biden and Harris and not lie then That is a hole lot better than a want to be Dicktator with his head up his ass on Covid 19.
Stand up and applaud if you think that Biden/ Harris is the winning ticket in November
Man once we destroy the Dems and beat Harris oh I’m sorry I mean Biden we need to retake the house and retire Nancy Pelosi she is a disgrace. #Trump2020

President Trump should be sending Biden a thank you card for picking kamala Harris. I see a November landslide.
Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
Biden can’t unify the country the same way Trump can’t, because we have loads of hate in this country.  We need an alien invasion so that we can target our unified hate.  This would bring us together.  We do need to be sure the ETs aren’t just friendly visitors before we spew.
Unless the little guy is of color and In Prison. If thats the case she is a savage. Just ask people in California how good she is. Biden lost my vote over this one. They dynamic in America has to change. This is not change.
Fines crooks  he chose. yikes. Im not voting for that.  He had better picks. what the hell is this garbage. Susan Rice really experienced. Stacy Abrams WTF even Elizabeth Warren. But I hate to loose her in the Senate.  This is not a winning ticket. I think Biden just lost

Lol yes because Rasmussen who oversamples Republicans totally got them winning the House right 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️  PS, 51-49 still gives Biden all 10 EVs
Biden +2 in GA then Biden only +3 in MN.  Pretty much everyone can push their narrative today
It’s pretty messed up that the Democrats still wanna admit that the VP is actually going to be the President because they know Biden is not there
I love how people say stuff about Biden when it's more than likely trump is worse. He was literally hanging out with Epstein. But yet you think he is the only innocent person? Wow

If she's one of Biden's picks, you can be sure she's already engaged in the issues.
The VP becomes the legs of the president. Biden can facilitate foreign policy decisions, but Rice has the experience to negotiate them.
Joe Biden said if he's elected he's going to ..umm...ahh...he can't remember.
“How can you vote for Biden? Guys lost his mind!”
I agree. Trump should be put in a home. Biden on the other hand looks fit for his age and can actually pronounce words and put together complete sentences and doesn't cry every time someone says something about him he doesn't like. Trump is a pussy.
Could we just start over with two entirely new candidates?  I’ll vote Biden because I don’t think he’s an awful person.  That’s my bar...’not awful’.
The GOP can never insult Biden again
Definitely not an overnight battle. Trump or Biden have no advantage in this imo
But Biden is the one with cognitive decline
He nor anyone in the GOP can say anything about Biden again if this true
He complained about Biden
If Biden wins by 90%, that I could believe.
Yes, it does appear fraudulent. more and more reports say that all states may not be able to chip in $100. Money is being taken from FEMA to foot the bills. Who will put the stolen funds back in the Social Security trusts? People can see what he's doing. I'm voting for Biden.
Hahahhahahah yes ok - But your man Biden is Golden
Of course China wants Biden.  He will give back everything President Trump made China pay the United States and more. President Trump needs re election!!! Trump 2020.
Yes, that really rubbed me the wrong way, too. I'm guessing that Trump thinks God is just like him, and that if he is losing in the polls, God must be losing too, and hurting. Biden hurts God by taking Trump's votes. We don't live in a theocracy and Trump should be quiet.

Now, Gail. Just take a deep breath and focus. We only have 85 days. Stay interested and be tough. You'll make it. Treat yourself to something. When was the last time you had a root beer float or a banana split?  Life is worth living. Keep campaigning on Biden from twitter.😷😍🥰.
I love being blocked by idiot Democrats who cannot handle the truth they get triggered as soon as the truth comes out. JOE BIDEN  is as big of a Racist as they come!
No💗 I'll vote fir Biden no matter who the VP spot goes to💗
I see your point but the GOP are running ads in Pa using that term connecting the violence to  Biden. Funny Trump is the president when those videos were taken.
I'm believing that we will see an improvement when Biden is elected. Biden's smart not to say too much. Trump would twist his words or steal his ideas or both.
Wouldn't doubt it.  Biden dodged a huge bullet having a virtual convention, you know these idiots would show up in Milwaukee and try to reenact 1968.
When Biden wins and the real democracy is restored, then we can count on a better future. I don't think it will be easy. The Congress and America will test his mettle. I'm confident he will succeed, because he knows the REAL "all the best people".
The Biden camp should use this as another failure of Trumpism
I should add Biden could turn this around as another failure of Trumpism.  This isn't a protest, it's criminal activity.
Correct.  Makes me sick.  Biden should condemn.
Biden will have no problem getting white votes especially from racists. He has been anti-immigrant and has hated minorities every step of the way. Even now in selecting a running mate he will pick a woman of color. Using this person as a pawn on a chessboard.
Honestly if Joe Biden were to win the election he will need millions of black people to look the other way when pulling that lever. His punches against blacks have been coming since he took office in 1972. Biden will need a miracle. Black voters do not forget.
Oh I know.  They know they can't get their revolution with Biden.  It's just like how the Alex Jones / John Birch society benefited in growing their movement from Obama.  Bush was "good enough" for most conservatives.

Tom Arnold:  First thing is, get Biden &amp; Harris elected. Don't worry about anything else till we get Trump out of there, &amp; then the cards will fall. VOTE, VOTE, VOTE.
Tom: We don't realize how bad it is. We'll find out when Trump gets out of office. Rick: Will we? Every President has forgiven the sins of the previous Pres. Will Biden do anything different? Tom: They will turn on each other &amp; force the hand.
Tom Arnold:  Trump &amp; Kushner are helping Kanye West get on the ballot in Colorado to take votes away from Joe Biden.
Tom Arnold:  No, Mike Pence, Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris are not going to take away your meat. Anything Trump says is good for America is a lie. Everything Trump is doing now is to win the election.
Thank you Mr. President for your generosity &amp; giving up an easy life (well easier than politics LOL) to try to save our country that was in bad shape after eight disastrous years of Obama-Biden!
Biden is the ideal statesman ! LMAOF ! Maybe for China !

And I really don’t see how telling people that both options suck is going to help anyone right now. It sucks. I came close to voting third party in 2016. I get it. But right now it feels like we vote for Biden or we lose our democracy.
I don’t want Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Nope. I voted for Bernie in both the 2016 and 2020 primaries. It sucks that Biden is the only chance we have to get Trump out. But I cannot risk another 4 years of Trump. My daughter will be 12 before he’s gone.

Executives at the nation's two largest private prison companies have been donating large sums to President Donald Trump and Republican candidates.
I would be a lot more comfortable if it wasn't Biden. He's a creep. He is questionable in his conviction and where he stands. He is possibly a rapist. Not saying Trump isn't. I had really hoped 2020 would have turned out better.
Rush Limbaugh’s stellar guest host Todd Hermann would like to see someone ask Kooky Kamala if Segregation Joe Biden has every sniffed her hair. My question for Harris is “Do you regret having an affair with the married Mayor Willie Brown, &amp; have you apologized to his wife?”
Wow. Someone is scared. Guess what genius. We are taking America back and it begins with electing Biden/Harris 2020 to undo what you did. This pandemic was your responsibility. Instead you claimed it was a hoax and it would magically disappear. We are taking America back!
It's strange having a good conversation on twitter that isn't all angry (especially about politics). But yeah, I see your point. And I may end up voting for Biden, but it's a hard sell for me right now. I just wish that more people could talk about this stuff without yelling.

Calling Trump a dictator and then demanding people vote for Biden, lol.  Do you hear yourself? Should we just abolish the other political parties?
Biden and Trump agree on something.   I might faint
Where’s Biden besides cowering in his basement? Rush Limbaugh’s stellar guest host Todd Hermann wants someone to ask Kooky Kamala if Joe Biden has ever sniffed her hair! How about tv/internet ads of Biden inappropriately sniffing/ touching of young girls/women that is on the net?
To borrow a quote from my mother: Joe Biden needs to win this year, because otherwise I don't have anything to look forward to anymore.
I really wish Biden/Harris supporters, instead of engaging 10yr-old accounts with 9 followers, just block and move on. Don't give them your precious time. Just block and keep moving FORWARD.
If I don't want Trump or Biden because I don't want either in the office, then not voting for them is the same thing right? So since I cannot sacrifice my morals for either one, I'll at least support someone who I think needs it.

Biden’s actions speak for themselves. He is not a practicing or faithful Catholic. The Bishop is stating the obvious.
Any black person who seriously would vote for Kanye. Face it. They were never going to vote for Biden or Trump. So they’re irrelevant.

“Harris’ addition is not a great feminist achievement. Her decision to join Biden after accusing him of ­assault underscores, in a damning and irreversible way, how unseriously her party takes these issues when there are political ambitions at stake.”
In April 2019, Harris discussed the allegations against Biden, declaring of the accusers: “I believe them, and I respect them being able to tell their story and having the courage to do it.”
Amazing how this behavior doesn’t seem to bother National Democratic leaders. Like, you know, Biden.

Love you too, had hope you but I know you have much to give in other areas of a Biden Admin
Why do Democrats/Socialists like Joe Biden hold blacks in utter contempt?

Yay! Another election where we all get to choose between a douche and a turd sandwich. This is the second presidential election in a row I truly couldn’t care less who wins. Biden and Trump are both unfit for office. I love Taylor’s music but I can’t share in her enthusiasm.

Yay! Glad to know this. Makes me even more convinced to vote Biden/Harris!
Nope. She’s a Republican, but is working on Biden’s “Latino outreach”.
If being a racist and communist makes you a quality man, then Biden is the real deal.
I highly suggest you look into her record as a prosecutor before you endorse her. She locked up 1000’s upon 1000’s of people for nonviolent drug offenses. Plus she said she believes Biden’s accusers. So she’s either a liar or so egocentric that she’s cool to run with a rapist.

For this election, the leftist position is to vote for Biden.  Sorry, but a vote for a Green Party member is one less vote for Biden defeating Trump.    There's no basis for philosophical debates about the lesser of two evils when Trump is the incumbent.

Biden Top 10 Donors this year so far 60 million dollars! Trump so far 24 million 2016 Trump had over 40 million in big donors while Clinton had only 12 million, If its Big money that determines the election , then POTUS may need a Festivus Miracle.
republicans literally have every reason to make fun of the biden/harris ticket i can’t even defend it
You don’t seem to understand: I don’t OWE Biden or Trump my vote!! You’re supposed to vote for people you actually want to run the country. It’s the most important form of self expression. Trump and Biden are both awful, so I’m not voting for either.
To support my idea, Look at the amount of big ticket money given to Trump vs Biden   Wonder if Bruce "New world order, Ghost of Tom Joad" Springsteen is watching
The I dont know what I am talking about market analysis.  The market likes Joe Biden given who his big donors are and a top down driven model with control favors big corporations,  But Trumps bottom up works too, Problem is that the former favors wall Street over Main street, IMO
You know who else ran an epically bland campaign against a polarizing, corrupt and intellectually unserious candidate... and won? Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers, who defeated Republican grifter  Parallels abound.   #generalnews #feedly
Intrigued dissecting fonts in logos. The new variation of the Biden logo w/ running mate Harris uses typeface Decimal that was developed by the type foundry, Hoefler &amp; Co. that also created the typeface Gotham used in Obama's much heralded campaign logo.
I think maybe he’s aiming to become the first *dead* man to be nominated as Vice President on a major party ticket, replacing Pence and one-upping Biden on his groundbreaking pick.
Opinion | I thought it didn’t matter whether Joe Biden picked a Black woman. And then it happened. - The Washington Post
Picking her as running mate also shows the mental status of Biden!
Finally got to watch the full Biden/Harris rollout speeches and let me just say that for the first time in almost four years there are little cracks of sunlight that are starting to peek through the long ass night.
But he hasn’t done shit in 40 yrs. You think his dementia will help him? Unify the country. Thats on Obama and Biden who toreit apart. Since Trump was elected the left has fought him every step of the way. Accept the greatest president ever and that will unify America.
You too Bill. You would sell your soul to the devil to get rid of Trump. No presidential debates? Have you ever said that before. How about this. We have seen Biden for 40 yrs and he’s done nothing. Trump has done more than I can list here. We don’t need an election. Trump 2020
At least wait till they get rid of Biden, shouldn’t be long.
The level of disdain I have for the people who have decided to make a statement by not voting for Biden/Harris for Very Good Reasons™ is immeasurable. Idealists will idealize us into the ground until we’re all dead.
Joe Biden =/= his sons

Biden Kamala...this is great.... Im crying!
I am excited about the Biden-Harris ticket, but this is still funny - and true!!
In a press conference on August 11,  announced his running mate.  Here's what you need to know about the democratic Vice-Presidential nominee,   📰:  📸:
Add Adam Schiff and Ted Lieu to that list. The options Biden will have at DOJ are probably the deepest bench of talent at any position the Democrats have.
Just a thought: "We better hide Biden or were SUNK!"
They say the difference is that people who don’t like either candidate went heavily for Donald in 2016 and now they are almost all breaking for Biden.
Dead ass, every time... Every. Single. Time.. they replay the video of Biden offering Kamala the VP slot I start tearing up again... The catharsis is REAL.
WATCH: College Students Reject Kamala Harris as Biden VP Pick  via
It only makes it seem like Biden isn’t capable to debate. And don’t Americans deserve to see the candidates asked the same questions, see their behavior, and Hear their visions head-to-head?
Weird!  The black community is who chose both Biden and Harris so ....
To be fair, he does say "there’s a genuine difference between Biden’s position now and Clinton’s four years ago." The odds right now have to do with how much time is left. As we move forward, the odds will get better if Biden holds his lead in the polls.
I think it will go something like this... "I would like not having a bigoted, corrupt scumbag and his equally contemptible family running my country.  I will vote Biden/Harris."  Sounds about right.
At Biden's age it's technically called a Walking Mate. Can't be too careful
Agreed with everything up until that last sentence. I was ready to vote for Biden provided that he didn’t shit the bed on his VP choice (which given the other choices wasn’t a difficult ultimatum). That said, the bed has been shat.
Dude I’m literally writing you in over the Senile/Prison Labo- I mean the Biden/Harris ticket #WalkAway
I didn’t even have high expectations for the VP pick but Harris is definitely one of the worst possible choices (on par with Klobuchar or Pete). In conclusion I really shouldn’t expected anything from Biden’s campaign lmao
The first three quotes here are just scary. He addresses the majority like this how can someone act like Biden is any better than Trump. I’m not for trump, but what the hell is biden doing here for his campaign
Following and listening to far left activists has been highly educational. My biases and assumptions have been challenged daily. But not voting for Biden/Harris because “she’s a cop” is some rich delusional selfish 💩.

Amen!!!
Bar set so low-- it takes willful ignorance to think Biden/Harris are more destructive to our Republic than Trump.
I understand and agree with critique of her past as a DA, but the Presidential nominee is Joe Biden, so the outrage seems surprising. He was not gonna pick Ilhan Omar, Pramila Jayapal, AOC, etc. The very public list of options was not the hard left of the party.
I know I shouldn't be surprised, but what's the deal with the level of #Left outrage about Harris? She was not my candidate in the primary (nor was Biden), but there were certainly more conservative options for Biden to pick... The outrage just seems a bit performative to me
I’m supporting Joe Biden for president because he’ll be a steadfast advocate for our nation’s public school students and educators.   Will you pledge to support Joe, too?
For sure. Neither represent my views as a socialist, but Harris improves rather than detracts from Biden's ticket, for what it's worth... Just not Trump!
this may be an unpopular opinion but kamala harris repeatedly spoke ill of joe biden and called him racist several times, so it’s really not sittin well w my spirit that agreed to run as his vp. rant over thank u
It’s a harsh assumption to insinuate I believe all her achievement is summarized by a statement on a big reason why she’s most palatable to whites among the other Black women on Biden’s list. Like Abrams, Demings, and Bass, Harris is excellent. She also checks other key boxes.
John Kasich says 'conscience' compelled him to speak at DNC, GOP is 'my vehicle but never my master'
I mean, I don't know what people expected. The nominee is Joe Biden. I was hardly expecting him to revive and nominate Che Guevara...
Yet Biden was above that attack and picked her anyway. Take a lesson!
So vote Biden/Harris, and get ready to push for the policies we really want: Medicare for all including access to abortion, free public college, abolition, etc.
"Ms. Harris, 55, is the first Black woman and the first person of Indian descent to be nominated for national office by a major party, and only the fourth woman in history to be chosen for one of their presidential tickets."  #BidenHarris2020
Angela Davis has already said that Biden is the obvious pick, because the most likely to be pressured by leftist policies. She reminded us that our power was never in the voting booth.
Biden’s strategy has been clear - distance himself from leftists so Trump can’t throw that at him. In doing so he’s tried to stake out a middle ground between the 2 parties. Problem is, I don’t think there are many voters in that space.

I didn’t think anything could’ve made me consider not voting for Biden, but in true 2020 fashion, somthing did.
It’s cool. Biden is playing the long game. Has been the whole time
Wondering how  feels about this, knowing that Biden picked a cop as VP but also gets a free pizza from the best pizza spot in the world.
And just like that, my wallet opens back up to the Biden campaign.
kamala harris was the right choice at the end of the day!! very excited. Biden-Harris lets get to work!!
Trump won for sure now .... Biden / Harris
Biden is a liberal. They are everything they call the right. Yes including sexist and racist. With Joe tho you can add Pedophile.
BUT BIDEN IS WEAK ON URBAN TRANSIT!
How about how the media doesn't grill Biden at all so...

if you vote for biden you’re a pedo
She is bat shit crazy .... let her talk .... dems are turning  on her ..... she is helping Biden to stay hidden in his basement ..., probably ready to move to the 3rd floor  .... bunker style basement !
Biden is pathetic truly a nobody who does know anything or what dang day it is !! Scary mental joe !!
You know Biden is losing so you're using Russia, Russia, Russia as a preemptive excuse.
Every country but Russia would prefer Biden! He is not a loose cannon
Imagine being the Republican Party and actually putting out this list of Biden's spending priorities and thinking it's a bad thing...
I’m presently kind of obsessed with the idea of Biden challenging Trump to a live televised episode of Jeopardy. The spectacle would be impossible for Trump to pass up, right? Or is he actually at some level sufficiently conscious of his ignorance that he would deflect?
Not a chance, no way in hell do we ever want open borders, ICE abolished, police defunded, huge tax increases, our guns taken, The Green New Deal, and socialized single payer health insurance. A vote for Biden is a vote for insanity.
Still can't, ever, vote for Biden.
None if his ten reasons mentioned Biden. Plus, Bernie pledged to support whoever was the nominee. He is keeping his word.
2021 will be better than 2020 if Biden is elected. If not, then we are truly fucked.
Obvi I don’t think Biden is an ideal candidate but I also don’t have any illusions of moral superiority here so I’m not going to entertain “they’re both awful! arguments ✌🏻
I hate the old man competition happening between Biden and Trump right now. It’s like “would you call this man sleepy!!!???” and it’s Biden eating an ice cream cone next to a picture of Trump eating his ice cream out of a bowl.
jill biden is super cool and is going to be a great first lady
It feels like a lot of people don't believe that voter suppression and/or evictions/foreclosures due to COVID will be that big of an issue. Really depressing to see people getting optimistic about Biden winning, when this is staring us right in the face.

Can’t wait for President Biden to rewrite the tax code by decree.
Look, if Trump actually believes his BS about Biden suffering from dementia, by all means let *him* challenge Biden to a live broadcast matchup on Jeopardy.
Why are talking about Biden?
I can’t wait for the debate to see Biden challenge Trump to a push up contest.
The Biden campaign really knows how to get the millenial votes: merch
Or Biden should challenge Trump to a literal chess match … or a game of scrabble … or a spelling bee … or an IQ test … or literally any other competition that would in some way objectively measure their respective brainpower.
You know, you’ve got a point. I think Biden should challenge Trump to appear on “Jeopardy” with him. Now *that* would be TV worth watching!
Accepting it and looking weak? Fair point. Either way, *asking* would seem to benefit Biden.
Opinion | Trump’s own intelligence officials just undercut efforts to smear Joe Biden - The Washington Post
Biden will beat him in a debate like a drum!
Do you now see why I think the election is a landslide?  By the by, Biden has done nothing for my vote and supports very little of the policies I do. I support
What has transpired the past month. Arizona, Texas, and Florida have astounded with their ability to spread a deadly pandemic and not care. Nonetheless, the debates are gonna be funny. But joe Biden could literally sing Kumbayah and still win. It’s a gimme with the virus.
Trump: “Lock up all the immigrants without running water”  Biden: “Let’s play Raid: Shadow Legends. Start now for free.”
please stop saying Biden is not worthy of the black vote. Black voters will just oppose you for saying that! The less said the better! Please!
Finally, like my parents, trump can’t process new information or concepts involving multiple parts. For him the virus is about cases which we find from testing. He can’t grasp the simple facts beyond that. Biden does none of this. He walks fine. He talks fine. A bit of a stutter.
Please, for the love of all that is right and humane, vote for Joe Biden. If you understand politics at all, you must know, if you don’t, that only helps Trump and whomever you pick has no chance of winning.  Stop your hand wringing and step up!
change to Biden-Monhoff then
Difference between Biden and Trump is clear: One man owns up to his mistakes while the other doubles down. #RememberInNovember
Uninstalling twitter for a minute.   My regular timeline is "Chile sucks, rapists walk free every day, we're all going to die" and my academic timeline is "Biden sucks, Trump sucks, Penn State is having us sign a "please give me COVID and kill me" document, wtf."  Bye.  So bye.
I’m trumps mind, he is God. So yeah, Biden will hurt God
If trump doesn’t cracks 15% would you agree that if you dont vote for biden then you aint black?
Thread by  A completely deranged Trump claims Joe Biden will "hurt God" if elected president…
talking to strangers isn't that fun tbh like what if they're boring or a biden supporter🤢
I don't see either claiming disbanding the NRA would destroy the 2a. Trump was talking about Biden getting elected and the other called it an "assault" on the 2a.
For the first time since 1967 I am not into the US Presidential election, yet must say BIDEN -- a burnt toast.  This world demands American MUSCLE  and for obvious reasons to stand up to ISLAMISM &amp; CHINIMISM!  And this comes from a diehard liberal, now a realist or something!
For a long time my strategy was just to shut up and let the right and the true believers embarrass themselves into obscurity. That was before I understood those ideologies exist solely in the absence of shame and humility. Biden will be photographed washing leper’s feet soon.

At some point, whether Biden voters like it or not, need to acknowledge that many Bernie supporters vote on policy. We aren't Democrats, we are independents, and our votes aren't owed to any party.
What good faith? You came on to this thread spouting complete lies about M4A. Cheering on private insurance. Then you give us a list of Biden policies where half he voted against previously.
At this point your research on Biden seems doesn't go any further than his website. He has a history of horrific policies, votes, and hearings. The things he is purposing now are basically trying to right the wrongs of his past.
Are you aware the pipelines allowed under the Obama/Biden administration? The ones that contribute to carbon admissions? DAPL protestors probably wouldn't agree that Biden is good on the environment

Wait until everyone catches on to Biden’s &amp; Hillary’s island connection to Epstein.  is the first President to stir up enough attention to have something done. Now ask yourself why this isn’t on every media source. Seem focused destroying Trump. #SurvivingEpstein

i don't like it but anyone who votes strictly with conscience and not partisanship can not possibly hand Joe Biden the nuclear football,the fact that not one Democrat has called this to Americans attention shows what Washington has became GIVE ME A CANDIDATE after Trump serves..
This is not a lie Joe Biden shows what partisan politics really is he is suffering from advancing dementia,hes being kept out of situations where he has to think on his feet,he is being supported solely because hes a democrat ,not a qualified candidate. I never like Trump before.

she isnt African American and African Americans arnt buying this bs shes whiter inside than mike pence she never was forced to sit in the back of any bus and she lies worse than Trump Stacey was the pick! Time to vote for Trump in protest of Biden picking her!
so at the debate Kamala called Biden for what he is an old racist white man now hes a hero who can save America,,you cant pass this up!! No one could write a script for you this good!!
you called Biden for what he was at the debate and old racist white man now all of a sudden hes a hero? WE WONT FORGET COMES NOVEMBER
Biden picking you was political suicide,Stacey Abrams would have been his chance,you are NOT AFRICAN AMERICAN you wernt forced to the back of any bus and until it became politically attractive you never gave a shit about the BLM movement We see you for what you are!
Joe Biden is suffering from advanced dementia,You might as well as be as white as Pence. African Americans ant going to swallow your lily white im black lie. what you are is a hypocritical liar and we all can see that time for us to vote for Trump in protest

As a conservative I pray that we stop using the attack of “Harris/Biden are the real law and order candidates” this will lose us the election and it shouldn’t be true. A staple of Conservatism is being pro law enforcement, and on top of that this country needs law enforcement.
So did the Dems pick Kamala because they thought she would pull moderates or because she’ll be easy to control? Her time as AG was steeped in corruption and she outwardly accused Biden of being a racist segregationist and sexual predator. How does this work? Asking for a friend.

What an awful ticket, I get why people don’t vote for Trump but how in the hell can you vote for Biden.  I have nothing against Biden but goodness he’s lost his mind. He needs to retire and Harris was one of the worst choices
We need more politicians like  Love Bernie but.. You can’t say Harris will “fight for health care for all” when she’s against M4A. You can’t call Biden your “friend” when he fundamentally stands against the left’s entire agenda. Treat them like the slime they are.
Trump, "She was my number one draft pick"  Translation,  "Kamala is an easy target thats wearing a Biden skin suite."
Maxine Waters would have been an excellent choice if Biden was really trying to pander to us
It wouldn't have mattered who Biden picked as VP, Trump would have had something nasty to say about them.
You misspoke, Joe Biden didn’t pick his running mate.  😂😉
Whereas I (white dude) look at Biden wanting to pick someone for him to be what he was to Obama -- the last person in the room on decisions. And, given his age, he's picking a successor, someone who can be president on January 22nd or in 2024. And I'm excited by those reasons.

So Joe Biden chose the women whose Presidential campaign ended mostly because of her track record as a prosecutor to be his VP...in the middle of a national reckoning with a criminal justice she participated in...why can the Democratic Party not do something right for once 😩
Not a big fan of Harris, but Biden picking to team up with the person who months ago hit him square in the jaw on national TV is very much on brand and in keeping with the spirit of leadership we will need these next four years.
So Biden has picked Kamala Harris!  Can't say I'm thrilled.  She is a centrist so we can forget about Medicare for All et al.
She has been a VP contender since she  endorsed Biden. Harris is the first Black woman and Asian American person on a major-party presidential ticket.
Yeah well, I think we will have a better chance of getting the minimum done with Biden. I don’t think we have any shot getting anything we want with Trump.

Very, very excited that  is Biden’s pick. I wanted her for the big chair, but VP will do for now.
Democratic Presidential nominee and former vice president Joe Biden has selected Senator Kamala Harris of California to be his running mate.
Biden will lose if he picks her. Hillary's "WHAT DOES IT MATTER?!?" isn't the same as flat out lying for weeks &amp; throwing a guy in jail for a bad video  She's got "unmasking" baggage too. She was one of the initial people to unmask Trump's associates names on the Russiagate stuff
You’re positive??? Has the Biden campaign reached out at all?
I honestly hope it is Susan Rice. I really wanna see Biden appoint Kamala Harris as AG, then I’ll sit back with popcorn and an Old Fashion and watch her kick some corrupt republican ass! Are you listening Bill Barr?

The panel that vetted the potential VP picks has essentially disbanded, so it's now in Biden's hands, according to one report.
Taking race out of this equation it’s fair to say Biden wants a relationship like he had with Obama. That rules out some of the candidates being named.
It doesn’t matter who Biden picks for VP if he doesn’t win this year. 2024 is four years away. Get him across the finish line now then worry about grooming his Veep for the next election.

We don’t vote for the Veep in the primary, we vote for a presidential candidate. At some point if you voted for Biden in the primary you have to trust his judgment on who he selects. It is what it is. If you don’t like who he picks then vote for Trump or third party.
Salty? Kamala Harris Has Unfollowed Joe Biden on Twitter as VP Announcement Expected Soon
My dad is a Republican. He didn’t vote for Trump in 2016 and he’s voting for Biden in 2020. No preconditions. Ppl like my dad are who “you” should be going after, not ppl who want something in return for doing what’s right. One group is winnable &amp; the other is wasting our time.
What was their excuse four years ago when the squad didn’t exist? They hated Hillary? Flash forward to 2020: we like Biden who is a moderate dem but oh my golly gee the squad = socialism and Biden is weak willed? Give me a break. It’s going to be an excuse every single election.
You’re ignoring the point. When has Biden ever ushered in or advocated for socialism in the United States of America? He hasn’t. He never will. He’s never promised to do so. It’s a straw man’s argument.
They literally did though. Be honest, no one here is stupid. If it wasn’t the squad it would be another excuse. They aren’t going to vote for Biden. It is what it is.
4 more years of Biden. Maybe more.
Because they can justify their vote now. Oh I was going to vote for Biden but... it’s literally an excuse. You either put country first or you don’t. This country survived four years of Trump so republicans owe Biden the benefit of the doubt. His record isn’t steeped in socialism
Ok...but the squad is only  4 out of 435 elected members of Congress. Warren is 1 out of 100. No one can seriously believe that 5 members will control Biden.
This line of thought is stupid. Your lifelong republicans don’t despise Trump. Biden isn’t controlled by the squad, he isn’t ideologically aligned with the squad and they are only four voices in Congress.
He moves so slow!  Biden is a go getter in healthy shape, thank God!

You poor man...you were given the job to listen to Fox News opinion correspondents while Joe Biden and Kamala Harris gave their wonderful speech.
Joe Biden is such a good man.
Just come out and say black men are going to cuck your wife if Biden is elected.
Didn't he just say that Biden insulted a lot of men(I use term lightly) because he was committed to choosing a woman VP? So no it would just blow up in his face as everything else does.
In a Biden/Harris world.    Sad, sad situation
So, a Biden/Harris ticket eh Coach? they got as much chance as the  do to sweep the division #Steeler
Things that can all be true at the same time:  1. Biden and Harris are terrible.   2. Another 4 years of Trump would be far, far worse and more destructive.   3. If Biden/Harris win, there’s obviously still a lot of work to do.
People are so fixated on beating trump that I feel no one really dared to ask, "So what do we do once he's gone?" And given the what we have in biden and harris, what we are going to do is nothing much...imo

awww still not addressing me though. and yeah there’s allegations, but there’s no proof and Biden has said look into it then! and there’s no record of reed reporting anything
I stg, republicans on the Internet only have two jokes about Biden. It’s either “Oh he forgot” or something about sniffing the hair of the person he’s in a picture with.  Like, so hilarious. Where did you come up with that one, Linda?
Biden does have the high school dropout and felon vote locked up!
What are you counting on #CONORSCAM to do? Nothing like the norm?? And Biden administration?? Biden has been in politics forever and done NOTHING!!!
Pretty freaky isn't it.  I remember yours too that you posted.. I hope lightning strikes twice, I hope he blows Joe Biden away. I hope it's a triumphant landslide.
If Russia is helping trump. China is helping Biden.  I’ll support the party not controlled by a foreign power
Could you imagine this place if Biden was 20 years younger?
This candidate was 14 years old when he did these things. Biden is a sexual predator and you’ll allow him to run your party. Democrats are fvcking pathetic.
It’s a stutter remember. Just like Biden
Let’s hope everyone going in that was going to vote for Biden changes their mind appropriately if that ends up being the case. #VoterFraud
Last rime Biden held power I got $2k monthly premiums and now a $100k cancer bill. No thanks
So vote for Biden so he can surrender us to China?  No thanks
Now do Joe Biden..
White liberals did that by backing republican Biden and watching MSNBC
You go ahead and you get Covid and you’ll love how  biden doesn’t support M4A.
So go vote for Fascism! Biden/Harris are not socialists. I think you ought to stop FOLLOWING Resisters since you have this deranged view. Maybe you've been a trumper all along and decided recently to try to create doubt - chaos but it won't!
Since trump is doing everything he can to avoid debating Biden, i highly doubt he's gonna let Jehovah's android tangle with Kamala.
"We believe in fighting on the common ground!" The same people during the debates: "Omg, Tulsi is a russian spy! Omg Yang is a capitalist! Omg Bernie isn't a corporate shill status quo democrat like Biden or prison-state-warden Kamala Harris!"  Uh-huh.
Trump Campaign Busted For Manipulating Biden Photos  via
I am just fine. Stop following Fox and Breitbarf.
He would if he could, however a turnip has more life and brainpower than biden
Did they back Biden? Curtis C. Dunn says hi.
So either trump will cut it, or Biden win. I’ll pass.
So...someone the Dems didn’t want in 2016 (2%) is all that now? Someone taken down by a rookie politician (Tulsi) is competition for Pence? Someone who called Biden a racist &amp; also said she believes his accusers is a great choice? Smdh
Really Don, Trump is pushing the northern issue? All he said was he heard about it. Your an Ass, and this you know. How do you sleep at night. Don’t expect a response, just like Biden avoiding questions
If JB wins, and I didn't have PTSBD (Post Traumatic Scott Brown Syndrome) I'd say get her into the Biden admin. (Maybe run the audit, before moving on to Health care).  It'd also be nice if Kennedy didn't shoot himself in the foot.
You’ve got to see it through both lenses.
Trump wins by cheating. Why do you think he is attacking mail in voting&amp; the Postal Service. Is Biden a perfect candidate...nope....but I would at least trust him with my country. Trump is very clearly trying to destroy it. So vote for democracy......not evil. It's that simple.
If it takes care of fools like you yes.
But but...Biden got the endorsement from the communist party!!!!! LMAO
So Biden is against universal healthcare and that means I’m the problem? Fvck you.
Major US postal workers union endorses Biden for president #SmartNews
Let me get this straight, the potus (fuckface) tries to bribe a foreign nation to release lies about Joe Biden while withholding 400m  that was appropriated by Congress and gets impeached for it now is openly destroying usps to cheat to beat Joe Biden how da fuck is it happening
Come on Sarah !!! Joe Biden and Barack Obama are fucking terrible !! Just as bad as Trump just in different ways
Pee pads and knee pads 2020, screw Biden the potato from a proud Salty Army member!🇺🇸 #Trump2020Landslide
I think the idea is that Biden doesn’t have a key policy like Trump did which imo could hurt him, but i don’t know.
And when Biden wins, his AG had better do it!
You brought up Obama and Biden to being with the fuck?
All Trump voters go in person, Biden send yours in, we’ll see who wins! 🤣🥳 #Trump2020
I wonder why Trump is trying to shut the mail down.  I wonder why he got himself impeached to slime Biden.  I wonder why he is pulling out his stack of race cards again.   Must be a little worried about the polls.
Thank you to all of the postal workers for supporting Biden-Harris 2020, and not
And how is everything bad trumps fault! Biden has made more racist comments than all the republicans together
Kamala Harris’s only accomplishment as a Presidential candidate was gutting Joe Biden.......the self-immolation of the Democratic Party continues to amaze me.
For Black female leaders in Pittsburgh, Kamala Harris’ fight feels familiar  via
Or has his net worth gone down bc people said fuck you to him an don’t want to buy anything associated to him? But again non of this has to do with Biden or Obama but you continue to bring them up 😂
They can’t defend Trump so they rush to bash Biden or Obama every time.
“Recall how Gov. Ed Rendell rolled out the red carpet to the frackers. Recall how the Pennsylvania Democratic Party derailed Joe Sestak’s campaign for nomination to run for U.S. senator in 2016. This was likely due to Sestak’s call for a ban on fracking.”
Same time pedo Bill Clinton and sexual predator Biden.  But they’ve gotten away with for decades. So I’ll assume trump will too. Go figure.
Joe Biden had a committee he worked with. You’re being racist suggesting Obama picked a black women. But that’s not surprising coming from  a supporter of xenophobic narcissistic resident of the WH.
Honestly hes right. Even Stalin looks like a lib compared to Biden.
"Donald Trump was the national leader of the grotesque, racist birther movement with respect to President Obama and has sought to fuel racism and tear our nation apart on every single day of his presidency," said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the Biden campaign.
She looks dirty and evil.  People who know her don't like her.  She screwed her way to where she is today.  She probably gave Biden a BJ.
Come on Congress ... WTF are you waiting for ... unless you are seeking to aid and abet Biden's loss in November.

There are many stories being shared of how thoughtful and kind Kamala Harris has been to people. I found this story about Joe Biden deeply moving as well.   Biden-Harris is a duo of decency and kindness, competence and integrity. The contrast to Trump-Pence is in every dimension.

Saw hopefully soon to be President Joe Biden..he marched a few years ago in the Pittsburgh St Patrick's day parade....
I don’t say shit. They are in that group. Why you keep trying to race bait?  Do you think Black people supporting him somehow legitimizes a turd?  Does that make you feel better to keep bringing race into it?
he blocked me for saying i dont like joe biden keep up
Shoe fits.
I can’t wait for the left to get blamed for the inevitable midterm backlash against Biden that causes Dems to lose the House and Senate.
Just ask yourself if you want 4 more years.  There is NO WAY, NONE  that Biden if/when he gets elected will have this kind of effect on people.  Sorry, it was never ever this toxic
Zero Biden, really?  How did he make his money?
Far superior ticket that the one who has let over 168,000 Americans die and destroyed the economy Obama/Biden built.
I can’t wait to wear all this Joe Biden apparel just to troll the hell out of the MAGA clan.
Agree and I will take it a step further and say, if Joe Biden softens even a little in pursuing justice, I will want him impeached.
Former President Barack Obama has been very vocal about his support of his former Vice President Joe Biden’s presidential campaign.
I'm telling you right now, when I'm 77 (Joe Biden's age), don't listen to a goddamn fucking thing I say. I won't have good ideas
You get to have more taken from you after Biden wins theough corruption
Question Kamala, do you STILL believe the Biden accusers?
I dont endorse Kamala's past, but I will vote for her in November as well as encourage other people to do so in order that we can change America and the Earth's future. At least Biden and Harris acknowledge climate change is real and that's a start.
Do it. Agent orange is being a fascist, &amp; yes, biden’s a neolib nothing, but please can we save a little something please?
At least we know that Biden didn't pay someone to take his SATs like Trump.
I believe most women.  Reade's allegation about Biden changed significantly since she first came forward in 2019 that Biden made her uncomfortable by touching her neck, shoulders and hair. 2020 she said he also assaulted her by forcibly putting his fingers inside of her...
but i didn’t get my way 😢🤡 y’all look fucking stupid. vote for biden or don’t complain the next four years if trump gets re-elected
Give Trump and Biden the Cocteau Twins memory test  "Beetles and eggs and blues and bells and eggs and blues"
You're not a real Leftist if you want Biden and the   IT GOT EVEN BETTER!!! 😂😂😂
You're not a real Leftist if you want Biden.  DAMN, that's scarily accurate!
Amen. If Trump wins lefties are totally locked out. Biden is a moderate but he will be more open to lobbying.
I Received Some Info on Joe Biden That Every American Needs to Hear  via
It's not possible for a candidate like Bernie to advocate for working people within the Democratic Party. His 2 presidential runs proved that. Now he has to kiss Joe Biden's ass and become a parody of himself.
Yes I am reminded how fucking pathetic and immoral Republicans are. I never forget that.
Snitch on Obama and Biden because they would throw you under the bus
A Biden Harris win that legalizes 30 million illegals and open borders is the first and last step to ending SS. I bet you would celebrate that with all Democrats though. Why do you lot begrudge hard working Americans who foot the total bill  for SS? #CutPayrollTaxesNow

Now do Biden and Tara Reade
Are they wrong though? Very few on the (public/prominent) left are saying anything more than "vote for Biden, then hold him accountable somehow!"
also have to mention that the Obama/Biden administration built both the cages housing children (and adults) you’ve seen on the news AND the surveillance infrastructure that ICE uses now 🙃 which is why I will never accept at face value any claims that the Dems will be better
More like #Biden doesn’t even know his own name. Great deal  !
That was no gaffe. Was your accusation of Biden enforcing Sharia and endorsing the Muslim Brotherhood a gaffe? Beyond ridiculous.
Wow- your fact checking is incredible... On that note, have you addressed Biden’s complete lie when he said Trump called the white supremacy groups “fine people”.  Have you told your followers it’s totally false?
And Biden already claimed responsibility for the Obama Administration
Joe Biden, what a loser.
Are you serious? Democrats are nothing but place holders they never fight, “for the people.” If they aren’t going to fight for me under trump. What makes you think they’ll fight under Biden.
There are more of them than you think. My husband works with a lot of them here in Western PA. They tell him Harris is not legitimate &amp; Biden is going to be killed giving Pelosi the presidency. This is batshit crazy stuff. 😱
Yeah I watch his content sometimes and he’s not like... in favor of Biden. He doesn’t like him, but he’s in favor of damage reduction. At least from my understating.

Please let’s stop voter shaming?? If you can’t sympatize with those voting for Biden and those who can’t bring themselves to, you need to re-evaluate. Shaming people doesn’t change minds! Let’s move the fuck on. This is why we can’t get anything done.
There are only 3 black people in Iowa... and 2 of them are already voting for Biden/Harris.  I wouldn't worry about him being on the ballot in Iowa.
I’m attending Joe Biden for President’s event, “Make Calls Into Pennsylvania” – sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
Can’t wait to tell you liberals told you soZ When things get worse for everyone under Biden.
😂😂😂😂 You’re right one was a moderate and the others a conservative.  So Biden will be worse than Obama.
You may have misunderstood me. I'm going to vote for Biden and I think others should. I think some people are turned off because they wanted a lot more from the election than to just try to avoiding rapid acceleration towards fascism.
Joe Biden calls for a nationwide mask mandate as he pushes his plan to combat coronavirus
Biden repeating the 3rd grade does explain a lot.
1. So let’s see you democrats are saying we have no choice but to vote for Biden. Taking away our right to choose.  2. Democrats worked in bipartisan to defund and post office since the Bush error.  3. They won’t do there job to stop trump, enabling fascism. 👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻
They bought our government.  That’s why I don’t vote for corporate lackeys that think corporations are people.  I’ll make an exception this year though.  Ridin’ with Biden because the alternative is worse.  Should be his campaign slogan.
She looks so excited about the Biden/Harris ticket.
we’re all thinking it and i’m saying it: who the fuck is joe biden
I don't remember if they endorsed anyone in other recent elections but the postal union endorsed Biden today, so this is starting to badly backfire
If Biden loses it won’t be. Kamala will be seen as unelectable.
A lot of my friends are vets and they are all voting Biden/Harris!
He will be the next AG if Biden wins!! Can you imagine that assh with that power!
Trump’s War On Mail Backfires As Postal Workers Union Endorses Biden  via
I live in the rust belt. Biden is going for votes from blue color workers, which voted Trump last time, by bashing China in recent TV ads. Dems are big media and coastal elites these days. There's lots of talk about what fascism is in this thread so why vote this time?
I don’t understand how you chase after these Biden conspiracy theories when these things about trump are literally in front of your face.
Geezus. No good reason for this. So obvious GOP is looking to suppress Dem votes there. B4 Trump was elected (and after) he and his followers used to cry out “lock her up”. I think once Biden wins, we need to lock TRUMP up! (And a WHOLE LOT MORE of his administration)
No matter how you vote, either Biden or Trump will win. So if you want your vote to matter, pick which of the 2 you think will do less damage.  Trump has devastated America. I'm willing to give another administration a chance to prove itself better or also be a disappointment.
Does anyone think there's even a chance that Biden will be viewed as a better president than Obama was by themselves, the 2024 Democratic primary electorate, or the public at large?  Even the people who claim to be excited about him?
Many neoconservatives prefer Biden. Trump hasnt started any new wars. Obama/Biden supported regime change; Lybia, Syria,etc. Sent home more undocumented immigrants than any other administration. Dems take the most money from police unions. New VP pro police. Trump fascist? Biden?
Trump will escalate his lies that Obama and Biden are criminals. His followers will believe him. Those who oppose him will not. The apathetic masses in the middle will simply not vote, saying that both sides are corrupt. Low voter turnout will benefit Trump. Vote!
I try not to remember the shit you said because it’s not worth taking up any space. Senseless blather. I’d rather use it to watch republican Porn - Fox.... oh no I won’t watch that.  And it’s not kiddie porn so I am clearly not a Republican.
Let’s play a match game!   Can yo u match these goals for socialism with the Biden/Harris campaign platform below?   Looks like a perfect correlation !
And I’m sure you’ve also criticized Biden for only taking scripted questions from reporters chosen in advance also. 🙄🙄🙄🙄 #CNNisFakeNews
But reminded me again Which of them had the university scam ? Don’t recall a Biden University
Biden is unfit and establishment as they come i will write in tulsi and leave with my morals
and when NowThis drops an absolutely bone-chilling interview between a dying Ady Barkan and biden, where biden says (even after 100k dead to a virus in the US) no, he will not consider M4A, we at pod save america will call that a good talk between two people just disagreeing 🙃
You sit there and talk about the environment saying how Biden will be better and yet when he was VP it still got worse. So......no different than trump. Actions speak louder than words.
Bill you know it's the Harris-Biden ticket in reality......
A. Hillary's lead was never as big as Biden's current lead.  B. Trump wasn't an incumbent with a record.  He was the "change agent".  This time, he's the opposite.  C. Hillary was hated by a large percentage of the population.  Biden isn't.
And you’ll still vote for the next centrist. Hard pass. I’d rather fight trump for 4 more years than beg from biden
made a statement today! Once again he didn’t allow questions! He brought his nanny  that frees Jill Biden to speak remotely into his earpiece!
Phew, I was worried about Biden’s chances there for awhile.
Where can I buy one from Biden??
I can name two of Biden's policies:  1) I'm not Trump 2) I picked a Black woman for VP!
I’m not risking my like for joe Biden as he did for poor people post Super Tuesday
Biden and Harris don’t even support medicare 4 all
I hear you and I fully understand you, but what do you gain from telling others not to vote for him? If it's your personal choice that's fine.  said he won't vote for Biden either, but he isn't out there convincing others not to.
I've always said I will be voting for Biden,  but i will be dogging the hell about him till election day and beyond.
Women ARE empowered!  Your lies about rapes, pussy grabbing, raping young girls with Epstein plus wishing G. Maxwell his partner in crime to be well, kidnapping then caging children + allowing them to be sold by DeVos have ALL energized US women &amp; moms to VOTE FOR BIDEN &amp; KAMALA.
If God forbid Biden wins I’ll stand outside the White House on his first day declaring him a racist, misogynistic murderer.  What’s good for the goose is good for the gander.
Who do the white supremacists vote for? It ain’t Biden.
The world needs to be saved from itself. Don’t repeat history — vote Biden/Harris 2020 and then Harris/Whomever. #mvp #madamvicepresident
In one day Trump has answered more questions in a press conference than Joe Biden has in a year.
I am happy. Especially when I can watch a MAGAT get eviscersted by   I may have a Napoleon Complex (I don’t) but what do you call the syndrome where a bowling ball sits on that tiny twig of a neck?
I don’t know how to reach Trump supporters, since at this point I feel like they LIKE the fascism.  I don’t believe the current democrats will be able to prevent it again either, especially since Biden wants to return to the immediately preceding status quo
If you think Biden is fat left, you need a serious lesson in political theory.  He’s a centrist Republican.  Just like Obama was.  More in line with Ron Reagan than actually leftists.
Dr. Biden, is it possible the Congress can get FEDEX and UPS to accept mail-in ballots?
That “faceless” coward will chew your ass up and spit you out.  Significantly more well versed than I. The education will be much better. Meanwhile is that a pic of you in the profile?  I know it’s been manipulated to make yourself more attractive.....

That's it, I'm convinced. I'm voting for Hillary, err I mean Kamala, oh wait Biden is still first on the ticket? - no one ever
It’ll be sooner than two years if Biden wins, as there is no other way he will have been able to win without The Deep State and satanistic pedophiles working for him
Jill Biden?
Probably the bravest thing I have done in 2020 was putting a Biden bumper sticker on my car and then driving around Greensburg
Like u can support but uh maybe ,,,, criticize her track record. Theres a reason biden who wont defund police and hates universal health care chose her. It wasnt to have a contradicting voice
The take that Biden picking Harris was the obvious, safe move is lazy &amp; wrong.   Consider the recent Dem VP nominees: Gore, Lieberman, Edwards, Biden, Kaine. All to the right of the Pres candidate ideologically.   Harris is well to the left of Biden. I appreciate the gamble.
Geraldo, Trump knows she is running for VP but in reality she is running for President. Biden doesn’t even know when his nose is running. #TrusttheForce Geraldo
Drop some science Joe..... we will wait. 🤣🤣
Can anyone tell me: What did Biden do to help the USPS the 40+ years he has been in politics?
But they endorsed Biden so...
“Vote them in, then hold them accountable”  Excuse me? We can’t hold Trump accountable for ANYTHING. Biden and Harris will absolutely brush aside any criticism thrown their way, as they currently do now. I’m tired of their supporters lying to us about how things are gonna go down
Very few. I see more Bernie signs than Biden signs.
Vote for Biden.
How many convictions?  And why don’t you mention Joe Biden’s accuser?
Few people will vote for Biden/Kamala. Look at their presidential runs before Obama rigged it.  They want Trump to win because he is an idiot that will go balls to the wall for billionaires &amp; he doesnt care how unpopular he is.    If he knew history, he would be more fearful.
Clinesmith will drag this out until the election. If Biden wins, he'll give nothing and will be pardoned. If Trump wins, he'll sing like a bird.  It's that simple. Here's hoping for more than this in the near future.
Hoping for more but expecting something like this.  AG Barr doesn't come from the school of under-selling to exceed expectations.  I guess we take him at his word. BTW Clinesmith isn't going to say a word. He's banking on Biden winning then walking away.
'NYT' columnist says Biden won't be a 'troublemaker'-- when Israel needs to kill Palestinian children
I don’t know. My older sister claims if Biden wins she’s going to have to keep working. And she doesn’t know “what’s going to happen to this country- look at Chicago!”   Under Trump she so getting a raise(she’s referring to eliminating the payroll deductions). She’ll also be 62.
Ok just randomly clicked past  where I hear Chuckles gleefully saying how Ron Johnson is exposing Biden. What the actual fuck?
Biden has the widest lead in any election since 1996.  And the widest lead in any election by a non-incumbent since Reagan in 1980.  He has "locked it up"...as long as we have a free and fair election.  But since Trump is going to cheat, that's why it isn't "locked up" for sure.
If all Biden can muster is a public option instead of #MedicareForAll, voters would at least reward him for making it as big and bold as possible: - No deductible - Medicare billing rates - Auto-enroll uninsured Read more in our new  polling:
It's not spin. Trump has helped  private prisons, and those same entities financially back Trump. If Biden is elected, he'll have a difficult time if he intends to combat any deals the Trump Administration has already made.
Joe Biden started the vice presidential selection process by putting himself in a box. He pandered. He said he would pick a woman.  He did not say: I will pick the most-qualified person I can find. And if that person is a woman, great.  Via
and again was this asshole you worship quoting Joe Biden Trump falsely claims 1918 flu pandemic ended WWII... it started in 1939  via
And Biden did not have the appetite to run after the death of his son. His heart was not in it in 2016
That's because Trump didn't come out months in advance and say. I'm picking a white male to be my VP. Biden came out and said he was picking a woman, no matter what.
I second that. Pirro threatened Biden. That threat needs to be investigated.
You’re voting Biden/Harris right  ?
Not that they'd even challenge them or ask any snarky questions, imagine Joe Biden just answering a question...about anything.
I will believe it when I see it. I am still hopeful. You are right if Biden wins, it all goes away.
Hahahahaha. It’s so convenient to do it during a pandemic in an election year where people with functioning brains want a mail in option.  Only a true dolt would still endorse Trump.  I would vote for a ham sandwich over that idiot.  I’m holding my nose and voting Biden.
all I see is WHITE VANDALS burning shit up, but here you RACISTS are trying to blame BLACK PEOPLE!🖕🏿🖕🏿 exactly why we’re VOTING FOR BIDEN IN DROVES!! #BidenHarris2020Landslide

WHERE IS HUNTER BIDEN?
When Trump was asked by a reporter about lying to the American people Trump was like a deer caught in car headlights the Biden people should play the hell out of that clip
To bad he won’t get the letter. Even if he did get it before November 3rd 2020 it means nothing coming from you. When Biden/Harris are in office I hope they investigate every last one of you traitors that took something in exchange to look the other way on trumps crimes.
And Biden/Harris want to take our guns away.

My dad, a republican as long as I can remember, is voting for Biden. And I am taking that as a hopeful sign.
Vote for Biden
I voted for Bernie. I gave money to Bernie. Progressives have pushed Biden to adopt left-leaning positions he didn't have before. We need to keep pushing.   Bernie wasn't going to be able to fix anything by himself, either, and radical good changes rarely happen quickly.
Please please please would someone try to defend this as not the most racist thing Joe blow Biden has ever done in his 40+ years in the People’s House. #SMH
If you don't think a President Biden would appoint a better attorney general than Bill Barr, or a better Education Secretary than Betsy DeVos, to name just two disastrous choices, I can't add anything.   I understand he's a weak compromise. Life is a series of compromises.
Democrats -- especially people like Biden and Harris -- are extremely ill-equipped to fight it. But holy hell, Trump has stormtroopers on the ground. If he wins again, he and his minions will take it as mandate, and oppression by the police state will get magnitudes worse. 3/3
Could only IMAGINE the piss fit Democrats would throw if Mike Pence responded with that same answer about Obama, Biden and Holder.🤔
Biden doesnt like to be challenged either which is why he's so disrespectful to Black audiences-- not just to you because you dont challenge Biden. NO BLACK AGENDA NO VOTE  #REPARATIONS for #ADOS
These would be nice, but I'd be shocked if Biden or the Congressional Dem leadership did any of them. They seem to hold a dubious accelerationist-lite theory, that doing nothing to stop Trump from destroying the country will ultimately lead to his defeat.
Concerning private prison stocks...
Getting mad about Biden/Harris isn't being mad because I didn't get the color pony I wanted it's getting pissed off because I asked what's for dinner and got punched in the face and told to starve
I didn't say anyone said anything are u reading my replys? I'm definitely not ignorant on what happened I actually think your confusing Biden with Trump.  Biden is so far from being racist its funny and rapist not even close Trump, Bill Clinton and Jim Jordan all raped children

I'm still laughing that Biden chose Kamala Harris. I mean there were, realistically, no good choices (that he was going to pick) but my holy shit. Imagine whiffing that bad.
I’ve not seen this sentiment exactly, but plenty of Biden hate from those who hate a Trump too. He wasn’t my choice either and I’m not getting a Biden yard sign, but I’m not raggin’ on him now. Accept it, vote, move on.

I'm voting IN PERSON, best why For BOTH candidates, see us Trump supporters are very nice People, we want it Fair all the way Around &amp; if Biden wins I WONT Need a puppy to hold, i will except  Him as my President, i was raised to RESPECT
How was it preventable, except for China. Tell us how would you have prevented it? Probably won’t answer like Biden.
Just got an email about my story that said Kamala Harris is not Black and the only reason SHE HERSELF and the media says she's Black is to help Biden secure the Black vote LOL   Case and point.
Kamala doesn't even like you! She Wants you out &amp; then she wants To be President, please wake up Mr Biden, their using you!!! So Sad
Why are you showing this? Are you opposed to Biden? If so please unfollow me. I won't put up with this shit. Go vote for Trump.
Bold of anyone to assume Biden didn't throw his campaign in the trash with this VP pick

You know what Mrs. Warren, at Least your tactful, im a Trump Supporter &amp; I hate no one, Biden Should have picked You as VP
Brian Stelter: "When you see entire media companies essentially exist to tear down Joe Biden, is there an equivalent of that on the left, tearing down Trump?" CNN couldn't think of any.
I am in the same boat. I chose to vote for Biden because Trump is actually killing people with the way he has botched the virus
Funniest conspiracy theory I heard this morning: “Joe Biden is made out of Play-Doh!”  Actually lost my shit
I'm not saying Biden and Harris are good candidates but Trump said neo nazis are good people let's them do whatever,everything he says is lie,ripping America in half, doesn't care for anyone steps on everyone just to get reelected!Have some American Pride vote Biden or don't vote
“Biden, Harris receive first official briefings on COVID, economy”
Does she mean like she betrayed Biden's accusers? I mean, she DID say she believed them.....   F**king opportunist. Do anything to get "a head".
Who are you calling a rapist?  Biden didn't rape anyone Trump raped 7 kids under the age of 14 their are 5 criminal cases pending against him till he's no longer president and 2 civil cases that he's postponed 6x.  Theirs also a 14 year old girl testifying what he did to her...
There was actually a satirical article by  with that headline. Meanwhile, Biden has made racist comments for years.
China Joe biden wants you to wear a mask outside and he says it’s not about your rights but it actually is all about your rights. Vote for Trump in 2020 like your life depends upon it because it does and masks will be an everyday thing just like in china.
The words “Biden,” “Harris,” “both,” “got,” and “Covid” are a little too close for my liking in this headline
Yeah, I'd put them at right around 30% in 2020, which lends me to a ~9% lead for Biden.
Energy? She didn’t even make it to the first primary. More? Pretty sure Biden is going to win California. She brings nothing but leftism. Trump would be wise to focus on her and not Biden. Will win 48 states if he does
Somebody told me him over Biden bc he gave us money for unemployment 😭😭 he literally had no choice cus it’s a fucking PANDEMIC!
The people saying that either Hillary or Biden would have stopped this pandemic are stupid. You really think that if Hillary said "Wear a mask and stay home" these MAGA idiots would have listened? Or would you support their police state enforcements?
Probably the only good that has come from the past four years is that Trump has shown us the weaknesses in our laws!!!! Biden/ Harris must correct them all...so no one man can do to our Democracy what Trump is doing (should these things ever happen again!)
America was BETTER before Trump. He has ruined our country. Obama made it great and Biden will repair the damage done by Trump and punish Russia for interfering in our elections and having a bounty on our soldiers. #UrineTroubleTrump #cohenbook
A lot of people developed a lot of (false) hope from campaigns like Bernie's that openly speak about the need for revolution. Biden is a poor substitute.  It is easier to electoral politics than it is to radically transform material conditions or societal attitudes.
This confirms Biden cant make a decision on his own. PUPPET
That’s weird everything else seems to be Trump’s fault. Biden has been in government for over 45 years remind me again what he has accomplished???

Around The Table: Local Leaders Weigh In On Impact Of Joe Bi..
I didn't 4 years ago, and as far as I'm concerned Joe Biden, I think it's very sad that they went with him. Clearly he's not up for it, you can tell. Kamala Harris will probably have to do his debating form to, cuz Trump's not going to turn around and all the sudden be polite.
Actually that is a pretty good representation of Senator Biden. I can imagine him saying this. This is the guy who attacked busing.

I love that no one has a good, solid example of "what does Apostle Brimstone get out of voting for Donald Trump" yet.  So... What do I get out of voting for #Biden and the #BidenHarris ticket? Solid examples, only. No abstract garbage.
Yes I am, thanks. Biden and Harris are going to mop the floor with dementia Don and his lap dog Pence.
And if you live in a swing state where the Democraps desperately need your vote, &amp; you need M4A which they steadfastly refuse to provide or advocate for, then you can loudly and obnoxiously rub it in their face that you are NOT going to vote for Biden because you really need M4A.
Biden’s dementia seems a bit troubling. And his lifetime of corruption. And his groping of young girls. And his everlasting racism. Policy wise, it’s troubling to see him shift as far left as possible.
Was this a lie too, Kamala?
I learned so much in a few months from far left Twitter. And I still have a fuckton to learn. With libs and MAGA I see a lot of the same from both - the "you can't criticise Biden or Trump or your perspective matters little" kind of thing, and it makes me wanna blow a gasket lol
Wow your a complete moron and believe the words that come out of his mouth (actually fact check everything Trump says then you won't be so misinformed) Sanders was radical left and Biden wasn't 2 months ago what happened in those 2 months? Its just another lie from the President
Not just Jews, like Biden said ‘you don’t have to be a Jew to be a Zionist’
Biden wasnt the senator from DNB for no reason ( Delaware national bank). Don't forget the nothing will change hot mic moment at his wall st fundraiser at the beginning of the primary. Harris and mnuchin. Enough said there.
Did he ban flights from China and Europe? What did Joe Biden say when he did that? what was Nancy pelosi doing at the time?
Should he have shut the country down before or after Biden accused him of being a racist xenophobe for halting travel from China?
Or ya know, because CNN and MSNBC spent every waking second working for the Biden campaign to discredit Bernie and prop up Joe as the electable candidate. If Bernie was the nominee, it wouldnt be close rn. Instead we have Joe saying he would veto M4A during a pandemic
John is becoming more PATHETIC by the day. Can’t wait until biden wins, I pray he NEVER calls on JOHN THE HACK!

I appreciate all of these women for sharing stories about how they relate to Kamala Harris on levels beyond politics.   “We have to change the narrative and image of how people see Black women and girls...And I am hoping that Biden’s pick of Kamala will help to do that as well.”
Esther Bush, longtime CEO of  said her support for Harris goes beyond race, she simply feels she is qualified for the job. But she knows that there is still much work to do towards progress and fighting inequality in this country.
Hey, Biden is the one that set race and gender as part of the job requirement, not us. But keep supporting the racism and sexism of the Democrat party, that's all they have left.
Kathi Elliott of  thought of her mother after learning that Harris made history. Her mom Gwen Elliott was the first woman to be promoted to Sgt. with Pittsburgh police in the 70s. Kathi reflected on the trials that come with blazing trails.
Ok. So instead of addressing Biden’s obvious racism, you resort to name calling. Typical leftist dodge. Not impressed.
No wonder Biden is hidin'.  Hillary turned her icy gaze in his direction and said she is ready to "help" him.
Ask yourself do you want 4 more years of being the laughingstock of the world?  If the answer is no then vote Biden for stability
You’re all in for a guy who wants to sleep with his own daughter and likes to be peed on but the Biden supports are brain washed? $20 says you belong qanon also. You’re a funny Russian bot.
Barbara Johnson, director of race and gender equity at  also has Jamaican-born parents. She spoke to me about how people always assume she is African American and how Kamala Harris’ background resonated with her on a cultural level.
So according to u our tweet, Joe biden is racist, because he has already mispronounced it at least twice
Thank you Mr. Trump! If Biden is elected he will listen to these moranic scientists and try and stop our rocketing Covid numbers! He will likely believe the scientists on climate change too and try and make our air breathable! Fuck this!
“I love being able to tell my daughter that Kamala Harris is now a VP candidate. I love talking to her about different shades of Black women.”  spoke about how she used attacks and criticism of Harris as a teaching moment for her daughter.
Hilarious how you Trump supporters accuse Biden of things that Trump is much worse at. Like speaking.
Its funny how Trump voters predict gloom and doom, if Biden/Harris win in Nov., as if  his time in office was a walk in the park. It was a walk in the park alright. If said park has a Murder Hornet Plague.
Getting Out The Vote is vital! ✊  I’m also going to call my local Biden campaign headquarters to volunteer.    This pandemic makes everything more difficult but we can do this.
More so.  I think once biden comes out of the basement and has to actually answer questions, people are going to see just lost he is.
Let’s all just realize that at this point in this election cycle, and our world, THERE IS NO OTHER CHOICE. You either vote for Biden and Harris, or you are just as responsible for Trump getting re-elected. There are no other options
Biden will destroy this country. He'll abolish the second amendment and encourage looting of working-class suburban homes. It will become a Communist Country, then you could really say goodbye to Medicare and SS.
Prolly ain’t proof. With Biden, it is factual history. But he gets a pass.
And don’t even get me started on Biden’s treatment of women (and young girls!). The left is all over Trump for his misogyny &amp; sexism. But Biden gets a pass. Why is it ok? Is it cuz he’s all you have for a presidential candidate? Is this really the best y’all can do? Really?

167,200 Americans are dead from #TrumpVirus and Trump’s blaming Biden who has power to do NOTHING at the moment. I cannot wait to vote for Biden/Harris.

Powerful.
"Every single American should be wearing a mask when they're outside for the next three months, at a minimum. Every governor should mandate mandatory mask-wearing," Biden said. 🧐
Looked uncomfortable, especially when Biden stared plagiarizing Reagan, man this guy just keeps stepping in it. I dont think he'll be on the ticket in November.
Biden said such a rule has nothing to do with rights “but your responsibility as an American.”
And look at that. Biden so ready to deport immigrants. Obama deported more immigrants than trump has.
NEW: I spoke with prominent Black women leaders in Pittsburgh about how Kamala Harris' fight feels familiar to the overall Black woman experience in this country. Constant scrutiny, having to prove ourselves, and the debate over race and ethnicity 👇🏾
No thanks. Pushing Biden left ain’t going to work. Hard pass.
No evidence to back up claim green voters would vote Biden. Again you need to turn off CNN
How’s that Chinese interfering working to help Biden
There is no excitement for Joe in Pennsylvania. No yard signs. No pop up merchandise stores.  Last Sunday we were driving through three counties. Not one Biden yard sign but lots of Trump signs. Also we stopped at two merch stores. Business was really good at both.
They are relying on polls which screwed them last time, on top of cheating they have made no effort to stop. Do they really think Joe Biden is going to win by 20 but actually win by 2, so that is OK?
Where did this meat story come from??? I know that Joe Biden is destroying all suburbs, eliminating police, religion and anything related to God, but I hadn’t heard that I will be soon eating my last burger, lol. 167,000 and rising by over a thousand every day.
Trump assails, misrepresents Biden on mask mandate in partisan White House briefing
HOW can  spew this garbage?!?  Once again for those in  stable - Obama/Biden had a pandemic plan and a team to deal with one if needed.  Trump dismantled it and then ignored the virus altogether.  We know what happened.
Federal government cannot enforce immigration laws or defend federal property, but they can enforce a Joe Biden #MaskMandate. Does any understand how ridiculous this sounds - #youmightbealiberal

Wouldn't it have been nice if people used this account to push harm reduction and encourage mask wearing?  Maybe something learned from this tragedy? Nope.  Let's attack Biden instead. 🤦 Most disgusting people ever

Police state is where we are heading.  Lock down in blue states by Dem governors a test to see just how much  citizens can be controlled.  If Biden wins Oval Office we will pass go and collect $200.
Pence had a conservative radio show for years, so he knows exactly what he is doing every time he opens his mouth. It’s all suggestion &amp; innuendo. He could care less how much red meat you eat, but he wants you to think Biden/Harris want to make everyone Vegans.
Yeah no. Biden will just take us back to the days of the status quo. No actual change.
Not really. Leadership would be passing a Medicare for all system, ending the wars, legalizing marijuana, preventing mass evictions, etc. All things Biden doesn't support.
Cause that's all that we know to do. Respond with a clown face. Makes me take you all so much more seriously.
. Kamala Harris didn't have much support in her home state. The Left and Right can't stand her. Globalist like her, I guess. The first female president should be elected not appointed. Also, Biden is fooked.  I reject JoMala and am all in for Trump/ Pence 2020!
And don’t forget Biden/Harris for banning fracking, which takes PA off the table.
I don't think she's making them out to be saints. She's saying: Harris has done problematic shit. She hasn't done [trump's many terrible crimes]. Vote for biden/harris then hold them accountable.  Vote them in, then get on their asses about everything.
No self hate at all. Self awareness. It's not a betrayal or contradiction not to always support all things black. Unfortunately we've been mislead to believe such things.
Sure. I worry it stops at this though. I wanna see picky change. I don’t think we will usher Biden/Harris.   It’s like “thoughts and prayers” coming from people who don’t do anything to change policy. If it was coming from someone like Bernie then I don’t care at all cause he...
Not akin...it IS insider trading.  I hope to gawd when Biden wins, his first act is to arrest Trump!
nothing from Lawrence on the RACIST BIRTHER TROPE that Trump spewed about kamala today.  you exposed this clown for his PHONY OUTRAGE about Biden’s comments. You called his ass out for not holding trump to account, and you were absolutely right!
There is no rationalization. There is 4 years of trump or 4 years of Biden. Are you from America? Do you vote?  How old are you? You are like the child who hasn't realized that parents aren't perfect. It's just dawning on you that there is no such thing as a perfect person.
I think about him &amp; how i voted for him every time some enthusiastic person says "I'm voting Green Party instead of for Biden to get a third party to 5%." I know young people have to learn for themselves but this is one where i wish we could just say DON'T DO IT!

Where is hunter biden ? #WhereIsHunterBiden
I think it takes only an ounce of pragmatism to support voting Biden as a means to displace Trump. That's not praise of Biden as much as it is condemnation of Trump.  Angela Davis does indeed believe people should vote Biden, or did a month ago:
it will be Biden, the duly elected and sworn-in commander in chief, who gives the order.

Joe Biden and Senator Kamala Harris are calling for a three-month nationwide mask mandate to limit the spread of coronavirus.
Masks have now become so politically charged and are used as ridiculous virtue signaling. (See Joe Biden’s recent video). Requiring masks at this point (thanks to liberals’ insistence) are tantamount to violation of First Amendment speech and expression.
So just Trump lies? No one else, in the history of politics has ever lied? I mean, over Biden's and Pelosi's 30+ yrs in office, they never lied?

I think that Biden/Harris would do a much better job handling the COVID deal which is the biggest threat right now. So in that sense there would be a difference. Yeah, bottom of the barrel, I know.
Biden has a history of fondling and sniffing women, and Kamala's past is well known.  After the years of nonsense and stupid conspiracy theory aimed at Trump, this is fairly mild.
This is the canidate you clowns and the  propelled to the top. This poor man is losing his mind. But then I remember, to you morons, Joe Biden is still the smartest person in room in rooms filled with Democrats. You are all trash and #FakeNews
I despise both sides. But at least Trump &amp; his people haven't spent the past year cheating, gaslighting &amp; harassing the left. Trump sucks but he's managed to keep us out of new wars. Average people are not worse off. I'm not voting for Biden because Dems demand it. Not happening.

Biden is not strong enough, doesn’t command the respect of those around him and will not be able to hold back the tide of Progressivism.
Do you think the progressive movement has a better chance of molding Biden or trump?  That's your actual question. Nothing else
Why's that so funny. The absolute best thing you can do today to see that an actually offensive agenda is one day implemented is vote for Biden. Full stop. No debate. How much further left has Bernie pushed the party? We can keep doing this until we get what we want
But how will they be able to fund the biden/harris election campaign if they have to pay that much???
Joe Biden will never be President.
Joe Biden: "If you don't vote for me, you ain't black!" Any Blue Folks: "If you don't vote for Joe then you're an idiot!"  Kamala Harris: "If you don't vote for Joe, I'll imprison all your moms!"  This is the Democratic Party.
That gentleman should be Biden's press secretary.
Obama cut it from the Great Recession high 10% down to 4.7%. Riding the Obama/Biden expansion, Trump got it down to 3.5%, before he blew the pandemic response and took it up to over 14%. At 10.2 percent, it is still higher than the peak of the last Recession. What am I missing?
You are an absolutely delusional partisan hack if you can't acknowledge that Biden has blood on his hands on every issue you just named
“I mean I’m gonna vote for Biden because harm reduction, but-“ but nothing, they know they have your vote no matter what so you have no bargaining power. You will continue to get nothing.
If Joe Biden wants my vote he has to make a 9/11 joke.
The 2nd time a person of color (specifically the second time a Black person) is on the presumptive nomination ticket the GOP has gone full “not white so not American so not eligible” but go off about how voting for Biden/Harris is like voting for DJT and pence!! 🤡 🤡 🤡
I guess the only thing I like about her is that she isn’t Mike Pence, and the only thing I like about Biden is that he isn’t Trump. But again, “Like” is a strong word here. I despise them ALL. I just despise Biden-Harris just a wee bit less. What a shit show this country is. 😒
Bashing Kamala and Biden will divide the vote. Promoting 3rd party candidates divides the votes. I am depressed after talking with you and reading other red rose tweets. I had hope that we could vote trump out. I don't think this is possible anymore...
I highly doubt that. You're already spreading Russian propaganda about Biden. You'll keep doing it if he's POTUS. Don't be disingenuous.

It is not Biden’s responsibility to manage this pandemic. I wish it was! Only the person who is squatting in the White House has that power.
A genre of post that I do not enjoy is "Though they are far from perfect, I am voting for Biden/Harris. Here's why:" by people who were perfectly prepared to do that from the beginning without batting an eye

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris May Have Just Unveiled Their Campaign Strategy It's still amazing  to me that Kamala is running with FingersBiden after she denounced him a few years back when they were both running for POTUS. LGBT. John Breznican
Biden/Harris is pretty much the Democrats' last chance to stop the birth of a new reactionary movement that will marry large social spending expansions and an anti-corporate agenda to a far-right nationalist and theocratic agenda. ...oh, God.
By the same logic, a vote for not-Trump is a vote for Biden. So my vote for Hawkins is actually a vote for Biden. You’re welcome. End of conversation.
Shut up       Can’t you join Biden in the basement and stay there ?         You’re running for VP and you’re already trying to rule the roost!!    Typical

Biden will not ban fracking. He will close public lands to drilling. Nor does he want open borders - whatever open borders are. Like "socialism" it's open to interpretation.

We're so terrified of what the Republicans are going to say that we never spend any time thinking about how to punch back. And they say the same shit anyway. If they locked AOC in a closet for the next 3 months they'll still try and portray Biden as AOC or Bernie's puppet.
Biden-Harris and the entire Democratic Party need to really start hammering Trump on his USPS and mail-in voting attacks.   This is an issue where the vast majority of Americans will back them up on. Don’t leave it on the table.

I love these political ads where it’s anti Biden and anti Trump... I don’t freak with either one of them but who else we gon vote for? LeBron James? 👀
why does the channel 11 news cover the live trump press conferences when they are not talking about the coronavirus?  When he spends time trashing Biden and the Democrats is that really about the public health?
Now I know Tr/mp didn’t just say Biden‘s the one politicizing the virus when he’s the one using a corona briefing to attack Biden
What exactly has changed with the electoral college that would give Biden a advantage at this point?
I couldn't imagine listening to almost any of these people speak. I haven't watched a single Trump press conference, I'd probably never watch a Biden speech if he wins. Theres is little point.
Hey, stop splitting the left with your eyerolls. And while you're at it, unite behind Hawkins/Walker. Don't spoil the vote with a vote for Biden.
Why isn't Biden on board with the GND?
Followed all I wasn't following. #StrongerTogether #Resist
Yet you and the other left wing clowns at Comedy News Network and MSDNC never press Biden for repeatedly refusing to take questions. The rare time he does take questions they’re scripted and the journalists are chosen in advance.
So a vote for not-Biden is a vote for Trump? By the same logic, a vote for not-Trump is a vote for Biden. So I will vote Hawkins, which means I'm voting Biden. You're welcome.
Not Joe Biden
Look at joe Biden now wearing his fingers out on twitter What did he call president Trump a few months ago?   president Tweetie Bird !   Yet here he is now tweeting away every 3 seconds  How can I fucking  unfollow him??    I don’t follow him and yet all his damn tweets show up
If your life is so unaffected by DJT that a vote for Biden/Harris seems useless (or worse) to you, congratulations! You're better off than some, maybe many, Americans! And I'm not gonna tell you to vote, because clearly you aren't listening!
I was so pumped yesterday listening to Biden and Harris. Today I could throw something through the TV. 😣😣😣
The Biden outreach team is awesome I mean, Is it being called a Dipshit that wins you over or just the general voter shaming in an election decided by the electoral college and not the popular vote!!??
Notice the first thing the Harris Biden ticket talks about is a “nation wide mandate” That’s not scary to you? Second thing is to politicize the virus.

Attacking Biden/Harris on moral grounds seems almost as crazy as the most amoral president in history.
A One America "News" correspondent questioned Trump about an "Antifa" site that was redirecting to Biden's website. Who has ties to the website? You guessed it....RUSSIA.
I'm sorry, but I've never seen any president harrassed like this...and in the middle of a pandemic...and hes handled it well. He was voted in...and regardless of what democrats want he was not forced to step down...and I dont see Biden as having better leadership skills either
I see Biden is winning.
Poor tucker is desperate to prevent Biden from winning - what will he do when the president is no longer looking to him for advice and love?
The Democratic Party had this election in the bag, but gave into the same bullshit they always do. Now they have to prop up Biden, Weekend at Bernie's style, and hope for the best. It's just sad and it's the 18-35 demographic that will suffer the most.
Kamala saying "I believe these women" in public isn't holding Joe Biden accountable for anything though. Whats her rationale? Gonna stop him from fingerbanging interns from the inside of the administration?
I mean, that obv ain't gonna happen. But I'm not just gonna eat whatevers put in front of me either w/o a sniff. The Democrats been railing for years how Trump is the worst person on earth but the best they came up with was "Settle for Biden" and thats just not good enough for me
Wait what? Class struggle is a long haul, that's why we have to look past the loss of 2020-2024, which is a loss whether Trump or Biden wins. It's why we should vote Green to build an independent, working-class party for the long term.
Joe Biden doesn’t know where he’s at half the time. But yes!!! He’ll listen to the facts. 🤦‍♂️🙄

Not Just Yet President Biden calls for requiring all Americans to wear masks outdoors for 'at least' next three months. Somebody want to tell him to check with Harris first?
How can you look American people in the eye and lie! Over 16 million people are out of work, hungry, lost their health insurance! Obama/Biden saved our country from a housing crash, rebuilt our economy, left it to you and Trump, then you destroyed it! You sir are no Christian
Biden’s “experts” are liars and idiots
I think it’s totally disingenuous to at least not be sympathetic towards why people don’t want to vote for Biden. I understand disagreeing with it, but Jesus. Voter shaming isn’t going to win people over. It’s like YOU don’t want to win..?
You may not like Biden or Harris, and that’s your right, but they won’t try to destroy the United States Postal Service. Mail service isn’t partisan; both democrats and republicans use and depend on it. Save the USPS, vote Biden/Harris!

I’m all the people texting Biden volunteers back to tell them they suck. I’m a sane guy, just texting some random political normie and posting their polite answer here to prove....something?
said on Fox, Biden won't be on ballot election day--promoting violence toward a presidential candidate and dog whistling racists to remind them not to vote for a black person.

three things  1.  a lot of back people don't like Trump, but don't hate trump as much as progressive white people.  they may not vote for Trump, but they may not go out to vote 2.  Biden should have picked Booker  3.  Trump isnt going to win either way.
Kamala is a wonderful leftist and you progressives should be happy I picked her. She’s Bernie but black and sassy and young and can dance and checks all the boxes. Biden/Kamala is the greatest ticket in history.

Who are these naive people insisting that "We need to push Biden to the left."  Biden won't be pushed. He's taking lobbyist money 💰
Listen to how Joe Biden talks about black people in the present. He says they're all the same, they ain't black if they don't vote for him, even though he supported racist Exalted Cyclops Byrd's segregationist legislation.
The clip is literally right there, lady. Yet you insist. And racist? Ha. Biden: supported racist legislation of Exalted Cyclops Byrd, didn't want his kids raised in a racial jungle, and said poor kids are as bright as white kids.
Biden, fan of Exalted Cyclops Byrd? Supporter of his racist legislation, Joe also didn't want his kids to grow up in a racial jungle, although poor kids are as bright as white kids.
Outright lie, and we all know Joe Biden doesn't even know how to use Twitter.
Trump is making peace in the world today while Biden/Harris are still promoting more fear and control. Glad we're all waking up before it's too late.
You should just stop giving him all the free press. Falsehoods aren’t worth passing to the American people. Try covering the real truth from Biden &amp; Harris so that everyone could start to unite around something positive for a change.

If you are a progressive and vote for Biden, then DEMOCRATS NEVER HAVE TO LISTEN TO YOU.   DO YOU FUCKING UNDERSTAND?
What if he just delivers some middle of the road voters instead and those voters help give Biden a margin of victory sufficient enough to overcome the variety of frauds and dirty tricks trump will use to steal the election?  IMO the $$$ is for the votes, so just get the votes.
So Joe Biden wants to keep us safe and get rid of this horrible pandemic, and you're complaining about that.  You and Donald Trump don't care who lives and who dies.  I think I know who I'm voting for.
Joe Biden want you to work at for the next three months and if you don’t you’re going to be a boy . That’s only the beginning weight
A nationwide mask mandate only makes sense if your goal is to save lives &amp; limit the spread of a deadly virus that has long term health consequences that we don't yet understand  What scheme is Biden up to? Is he secretly plotting to save American lives from an unnecessary death?
You Mr. Biden should not ever mention the word SOUL, as a catholic that backs abortion you show what a hypocrite you are, and your voice pick is lower than you, if that is possible. Please Mr. Biden don’t come back to Scranton, Pa we don’t need you.
Two good ones Biden and Harris the best the dems have, so vote straight republican
That’s just another reason the vote straight republican, let all democrats move to Hati with Harris and Biden they can be dictators there

Just heard on my local news that Trump will be here on August 20th. Coincidence that he's coming to Biden's hometown on the night he accepts the nomination?
friendly reminder: refusing to vote or voting third party in a swing state just amplifies your privilege. I hate Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as most of us do, but people’s lives depend on getting Donald Trump the hell out of office.
My dad says he thinks "the plan" is for Biden to step down from his presidency shortly after going into office so that we get Harris as president. Assuming ofc DNC succeeds in snagging the win for Biden, which could still happen in all likelihood; I think it'll be close, like '16
1. This isn't 2016. 2. Trump is responsible for the deaths of 160,000+ Americans. 3. Did you see Biden speak earlier today? He was very coherent, he'll do fine at the convention. 4. Did you watch Biden and Bernie debate in March? I was team Bernie, but even I realize Biden won.
its less important from perspective that this election is a referendum on Trump.  If Bernie or Warren won the nomination the referendum would be on socialism.  But.. the dems wisely nominated Biden and so at it root this election is about whether you done with Trump or not.

It was refreshing to watch Biden and Harris speak without keeping their heads down as they read words by using their finger .
Biden getting choked up while Kamala talks about Beau is a great moment.
She is a liability not an asset. Can anyone really imagine her being president when Joe Biden is no longer capable?

Most of my neighbors are Trump supporters or we’re old school Dems that are sitting out this election. My best friends brother said I’m a Democrat and the party doesn't want me anymore he’s voting Trump. This article explains the situation in my area 💯%
Kamala isn't from a swing state, but according to these heatmaps they made, Kamala helps him in FL, MI, WI, MN, PA, GA, TX, AZ, CO, NM, NV, NC, NH and VA.  Not to mention, she'll help increase turnout among women and black voters, which are crucial for Biden to win over.

You’re not funny. Even if he does have cognitive deficits, (and we don’t know that he does) since when is making fun of someone for that appropriate?  Biden comes across as a kind, caring genuine person, the opposite of how people view you.
Dude I don't like either of their politics (now).   Trump is far worse. Biden will have a far superior cabinet.   This sort of post isn't journalism, isn't even commentary - Tim's trying to do fox news in the center by pissing everyone off, feeding kiddos to the alt right

Yes but this should happen ethically with actual plans to fight for the causes you and Biden talk about and if it goes in line with what needs to be changed than I wouldn’t mind voting either way

Biden screwed up again, if he pick Michelle ( she has no experience) biden could have won the Klingon vote , now who knows
i hear ya. But there won't be another pearl harbor in 2020.  Hillary isn't running.  Biden isn't scary. Pandemic crushed economy.  Trump is more toxic than when so many held their nose and voted for him before.  Only a vacant SCOTUS seat would save him.  I think.
he doesn't need to pull any voters off the fence.  just hit cruise control, play it safe. This election isn't about Biden, its a referendum on Trump.  If they nominated Bernie or Warren, it would be about policy. Dems did the one thing they needed to do, pick Biden.
Still riden with Biden
even 3rd party, you’re doing yourself and others around you an INJUSTICE. If you don’t think all politicians are shit that’s another conversation but we need to put our faith in the fact that we have to vote Biden if we want to continue to grow as a nation.
don’t even try to come for me right now because I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. I’m an educated voter, I’ve always used my voice against racists, transphobes, misogynists, COPS, etc but I’ve also said with my entire chest that I intend on voting for Biden.
Yeah she does a great impression of calling Biden a rapist and a racist. Oh wait.....
And just like that the idiotic Democrats forgot all about Joe Biden groping young women on national television. Pandering at its finest.

Yes, Joe did love Robert KKK Exalted Cyclops Byrd, and supported his segregationist legislation. Democrat Byrd was still in the Senate 10 years and 2 months ago. He died in office or he might still be there, and he'd support Biden.
Shows that he supports a woman who was tough on marijuana crimes. That’s who Biden picked.
Sorry but it’s Biden/Harris for me 🇺🇸

Wait I thought it was supposed to be a ploy to have Hillary as vp so Biden could step down 😂
Joe Biden did what he's done this whole campaign, he made a sensible move that will enable him to win. #BidenHarris2020
I thought joe Biden picked camila cabello as his running mate when I saw the news
Yep I need a Biden/Harris lawn sign instead of my Biden one 😍
And just like that with Biden picking Harris, who greatly contributed to the mass incarceration problem in America, as his VP he will no longer have my vote. Forget “Blue no matter who”, I have to be able to able to believe in a candidate and I do not believe in them.
I honestly don’t feel like a black woman was in Biden’s best interest which is so sad to say.
Merch! New! Now!  brb buying it all
So say if Joe Biden won. And them He someone unexpectedly died 👀 we'd have a female president 👁👄👁
Great VP choice for Biden! Kamala Harris will make an excellent Vice President!
Biden felt that pressure
Was so hoping Kamala Harris!!  Thrilled.   My wife and I have been saying Biden/ Harris since November.  Great ticket!
I don’t even work on the Biden campaign!! Everyone just text the number and we’ll all find out at the same time :)
Joe Biden thinks he can win the Presidency from his basement lol.
I guess the difference is Biden's commitment to picking a female running mate was some months ago. Additionally, I'd make the case that, based on Biden's campaign strengths and weaknesses, a lot of voters are anticipating what the VP candidate'll bring to the table. IMO of course
He's really trying to scare people. Sad part some people will believe him even though he's the one that was praising the Chinese in December not Joe Biden
if what is going on there is going on if/when Biden becomes president, he would do what?   That's a question I'd like an answer to.  Not just that he doesn't like it.  What would he do?
women in the suburbs, who held their nose and voted for trump, are either passing this time or going Biden.  He needs every point he can get.  Noem or Haley would be worth a few percentage points at least.  Pence brings no one in that isn't already for Trump.
if the first priority was winning and stopping Joe Biden... and forgetting what is polite or what is tradition, or what is nice, or what is fair, should Trump replace Pence and put a woman on his ticket and improve his chance of winning?
Just imagine if Joe Biden made that slip!!   trump would have shredded him to bits by now.

He just plays the media like a fiddle. Someone should call him out on his lies more often. Or just not even go to those press briefings. Biden needs more media time...
I think we all could agree it doesn’t really matter.  I have two Biden signs sitting in my front yard, but it could easily have been any of the other candidates the  party choose.  I just hate what we have now and anxious to get our normalcy back!  Btw, I was for Joe all along.
Why wouldn't it be Mayor Pete?  LGBT is, and has been, a higher priority for the Democratic party for some time.  Biden believes blacks all think alike and "you aint black" if you don't vote for me.  Why not keep presuming on their support and pick Mayor Pete?
I hope we all understand that we are voting for Biden because he’s our only choice.. a lesser of two evils so to speak.. dudes still a f’n creep
Trump would love to be running the Biden playbook of doing and saying absolutely nothing to win an election
The thing is, he does something like this every few days. You’d think you’d want to eliminate this issue by simply taking a few minutes and researching what’re you going to say. But this guy loves saying incorrect stuff. And yeah Biden says dumb stuff too.
Biden will step down as democratic nominee so that the DNC can hand select their candidate last moment
But please tell me more about Biden's dementia!
That's why there has been so much emphasis on Biden picking a black woman...
Democrat brutality!!! Slavery, KKK, Jim Crow, Senator Robert KKK Exalted Cyclops Byrd who died in office only 10 years ago, Biden. All Democratic Party! Biden supported Byrd's segregationist legislation, yet Biden has the nerve to say "you ain't black" unless you vote for him!
It’s kinda like Biden and his record player, out dated and takes up a lot of room.  With email/social media/zoom we simple don’t use USPS like before.  When you do go in employees all seem annoyed and all of the locations need a major remodeling.  Privatize &amp; rebuild if possible.
No matter.  Joe Biden is waiting to announce his VP pick at the same moment.  Take the wind from your sails.......learned it from you.
That’s exactly what he said. He never said Biden and would never
Then you should vote for Trump. Biden is against weed
why isn't  doing the Joe Biden bit every week on your show?
What the GOP doesn’t understand is Joe Biden owns his house in Wilmington. The White House belongs to the American people, not King Donald Trump.  A member of the Romney family should know the difference.
who is the competent person who will be helping Biden as he deteriorates?  I guess Susan Rice.
I would vote for Biden + inanimate carbon rod over the alternative. Hell, I'd vote for a ticket of 2 inanimate carbon rods
I would argue that the status of the country is one of the worst it’s been in 160 years. You think it can get worse than this? With all the morons Trump has fired and replaced with equal levels of idiocy, you don’t think Biden, who probably isn’t hitting on all cylinders cont..
YES, because Joe Biden was President Obama’s VP and Joe Biden was born in Scranton, PA.
What we have had has had long enough to fix their problems. If they wont fix it someone has to but that someone is still not trump or Biden
No shit they prefer Joe Biden lol. Him and Obama gave them the best deal they’ve ever had.
This salts the earth on Biden. Biden is going to have to force businesses that withheld 6m worth to pay up in January. Those businesses are not going to be recovered and have cash-on-hand to pay. So forfeit 6m of tax revenue or take struggling businesses thru legal process. /1
"Dear God, you know the thing. Amen." -- Joe Biden
Seriously. Biden supported Robert Exalted Cyclops Byrd's racist segregationist legislation. And Byrd died in office in 2010. Just 10 years ago. How do any black people support Joe "Racial Jungle" "You ain't black" Biden?!
Yep, as disgusting as Joe Biden and Bill Clinton.
No way this is real. “When you have media companies that are designed to take down Joe Biden”. WHO???? Every single fucking media company is run by liberals. This is absolutely insanity
If there is a less self-aware person alive, I might eat my drawers! Brian Stelter: Conservative media companies 'exist to tear down Joe Biden'
Can you imagine what the younger Biden might have felt about an older person in a similar situation?  Is this elder abuse? I too pray his handlers help him off this platform.
OMG this interview was freakin nuts! $1200, $800 $400. What a s#%^show. These are people making life decisions! Idiots in charge. Don’t ever talk about Biden gaffes!
“He’s against God,” said Trump yesterday, referring to Joe Biden. What a bad and sad political attack.
Democrats hate facts and are the biggest hypocrites ever,  they all wanted a wall at one time or another,  Biden tells a black man he's not black if he votes for Trump,  imagine if Trump said that
Wow you have to be young, and not smart,  don't know politics and don't know when someone is going against whatever party is in the way of helping people.. he have us tax cuts, not rich people,  lower and middle class,  you'll see taxes if Biden wins,  and gas at 4.90 a gallon
I’m guessing if Trump does it, Americans won’t lose their life savings paying for their co-pays and will, this time, get to keep their preferred doctors and choice of insurance.......unlike Obama and Biden’s false promises.
The virus is going away on November 4, but so will Joe Biden, to a nursing home

Biden doesn't really want to be President.
can you please stop ramming Biden commercials (that aren’t even close to factual) down my throat while I’m trying to enjoy  fight night/date night with my fiancé. Thanks a bunch. God Bless 🇺🇸
Watching it for decades Turned a blind eye to nothing. Citizens United is designed fascism I am poor Been my whole adult life College graduate saddled with debt Watched most of the middle class get shipped to China by Biden and the restToo bad you didnt feel like this in the 90s
I planned on voting in person even before this mess. Nothing will stop me from voting for Biden on 11/3.

So, is anyone surprised when the ICs say that Russia wants Trump to win but China/Iran want Biden to win, the media just buries the China/Iran assessment? Or that they refuse to honestly report on #Spygate? The legacy media are complicit. They truly are the #EnemyOfThePeople
to make Biden the nominee to prevent a possible Sanders nomination-- whom they would not be able to control (think Leftist Trump). Now, think about Biden's ties to China, and his rhetoric concerning China and Feinstein employing a Chinese spy for DECADES...
defeating him would be is if his economy faltered. Also remember, at the very beginnings of the global spread Biden was NOT on his way to winning the nomination, and in fact, the only reason he won it is because the "Party" intervened to have all challengers drop out of the race

Hi California for Biden. Hope all of you are doing well.   You know you see his condition and so does everyone else.  Your campaign manager is sheltering him and you defend a man that’s not 100%.  Your hate for Trump has no limits.   Hey everyone it’s Weekend at Biden’s.
Vote for Joe Biden
She’s correct hate to say it, but it would matter this time because if biden won and of course not the best pick for the country but has to be female and black&lt; biden then would resign due to ill heath and we have our 1st female president but TRUMP landslide will prevent that .
If Biden becomes president we won’t have a country, cannot let him or any of the demon democrats from holding any seats in Congress, it is up to US.
“A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for his radical left handlers”
“A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for great evil”

A church down the road from our home keeps posting anti-biden signs and I feel it need to maintain a thread of the signs:
It funny because they are still more intelligible than anything Biden would actually say.
Joe Biden could shoot me on 5th ave and I’d still vote for him. By absentee ballot, obviously.
Time will tell Geary. And no haven’t been sleeping at a Holiday inn express However most in my area are being used for the homeless so there’s been lots of visits to them for those of us on the front lines tending to them. Kick back in that easy chair like Biden and take a nap.
Tell me one politician that’s truthful all the time.  One lie is too much so all of them in my eyes are guilty.  If you don’t see both sides playing games then truly you have dementia like Biden.
I agree with this take. Biden would never do an interview like that. Trump is going to roast Biden in the debates if they don’t switch him out
Biden has been a republican with a d after his name for 50 years. Establishment dems are moderate republicans. I've seen Joes commercials. He's going to fix the problems he directly caused his whole career? Yeah right. We live in a fascist state. Have to take it back.
I’ve had my best years the past 2 years.  But I’d like to hear from someone who who’s things different then I.  I don’t share the same feelings of Biden as you do so I’m trying to understand why people would prefer a man with dementia leading the free world.
What’s Biden hiding????   Do a debate this month!!!!  STOP HIDING!  Senator what is being hiding from the American voters?
What’s Biden hiding????   Do a debate this month!!!!  STOP HIDING!

Damage Control Day for the Biden twitters. Hurry up, you better write more for them.
Really? Lol. As a guy who hates both.. I think I feel like a rocket scientist when I hear Joe Biden talk.
How do you feel when Biden speaks?
Joe Biden is not a racist, because Joe Biden was President Obama’s VP for 8 years!
trump is about as religious as he is articulate.   the only trick in his book is to project his issues into others.   “I’m a corrupt piece of shit so I’ll call Hillary crooked” “I’m a liar so I’ll call Ted a liar” “I’m a racist so I’ll call Biden a racist”  His insults=admissions
They’re using him to siphon off black voters from Biden...😢
Tell children the truth. The perpetually Dem-run big cities, with D mayors, D councils, D police officials have a serious problem with systemic racism they have never done anything about. Party of racism from slavery to today. Heck, Biden supported Robert Exalted Cyclops Byrd.
You really need to watch the CSPAN videos of Biden. He gets off on the power he has. He loves groping &amp; sniffing kids and knows he can get away with it. F-ing sick. Meanwhile, Trump said there are some women who love rich celebs and will let them do anything. Big difference.
"You ain't black, or diverse. Also, poor kids are as smart as white kids, and I don't know how to use the tweety thingamabobber."  - - Joe Biden, actually
Yes, and Trump was best buds with that Exalted Cyclops in the Senate. Oh wait, that was Biden who supported his segregationist legislation.
Comey is but one of MANY involved with those crimes. Obama should be in prison. And Biden. And Yates. And the FBI lovebirds. Etc.
Lol. The social media ninjas of Joe Biden. Retire in Peace Former VP Biden.
Dr. Biden, respectively, you are pushing a man that’s not 100%.  As a strong minded woman and a wife/mother.  How do you support your husband when all of us see his condition.  Do you not care about how he looks and how your family is viewed supporting this?  Very sad.
Senator why is VP Biden hiding!  Did you get out because you didn’t want to support his health issue?   His wife and family supports him to go through this.  He looks terrible.
He's misleading, as usual. Biden has said he doesn't want to take all guns away but doesn't see the need for the average person to own an AK47. I haven't done enough research into defunding the police, but from what I've seen so far, it does not shut them down.
still better then Biden and his cognitive decline.
I completely agree with Joe Biden! Joe Biden was Obama’s VP, so if Joe Biden were a racist, it would hace been exposed back then.
I forget, how many mistresses has Joe Biden had?!? I’ve lost count.
You can't blame just Biden voters-- he wasn't going to win the nomination until the Party stepped in and forced everyone else (excluding Sanders, who isn't "really" a Democrat) out... The problem is the Parties. They are like the mafia.
White privilege at its finest. This election is bigger than you and your beliefs. Its about saving this country. Take one for the team (America) and just vote for biden
Joe Biden said nothing wrong!
Okay stop I'm already voting for Biden
If you listened to Mr. Biden, you would learn he doesn't want to take away all guns. If a person needs an AK47 in their neighborhood for protection,  it's time to move.
He's making Biden out to be an awful person. Don't worry Trump, even if the shit you're saying isn't lies, we've had practice dealing with horrible people in office over the past 4 years.
Well Obama wanted to put restrictions on guns but still supported the second amendment, Biden wants to put in a buy back program and if you don’t, you have to register them. The fear is in not registering every gun and magazine, him attempting to take your guns
Obama and Biden don’t have the same political stance on guns so why would you compare them?
you will not likely see anything embarrassing or concerning about Biden from other media outlets.Poll: Biden Expands Lead; A Third Of Country Says It Won't Get Vaccinated : NPR
I was in the same boat but im in PA, crucial state. People ask me how can i vote for Biden, my reply, "im not, im voting for America".
And then put those stamps on a post card the says Vote for Biden and mail them to the White House.  Come on and let’s have some fun.
Neither of them are going to do anything about climate change, so we’re all screwed in ten years no matter what. Would be nice if minority groups got to live out their time being treated like people though.  Biden 2020. Slightly nicer while everything burns.
What kind of party won't negotiate and send a second stimulus to the American People. Your party joe biden, you don't give two shits about us, that's why you're gonna lose
When you realize Your wife probably going to divorce you.Biden and Harris are going to run the show,  Brother Hakeem Jeffries might possibly be the next AG, Cory Booker the Secretary of State and Elizabeth Warren as Treasury Secretar..And your going to jail. Confidence is a wish
They're signing legal documents ensuring certain things happen when Biden hands the presidency to her.

Harris said that she believed the woman who accused Joe Biden of sexual harassment! Now, she is showing love to Joe Biden because he elected her as his running mate, a man she believes to be guilty. This shows that she has no firm convictions. She is, basically, an opportunist!
Trump and Republicans..Want to take the new back from Biden and Harris,  So they are coming out today with some Durum report....Lmao...like that going to help them
This is the question every voter has asked since the first election, stop being ridiculous, if you regret voting for Trump, Biden it is! Full stop
Bill Clinton had an affair with an intern and was accused of rape by Juanita Broaddrick.Joe Biden is accused of sexual harassment and rape. Precisely, that's my point to Democrats! They criticize Trump over his morals, but they vote for candidates with moral failings too! Hello?
Joe Biden was on Parks and Rec. I can’t lie, that does mean something to me.
If Biden is enforcing sharia law he’s getting my vote 🤷🏿‍♂️
You might want to rethink what you just wrote, given that your statement appears to be a tacit acknowledgement that Biden would in fact do poorly on a mental cognition test.
I am worried about what Trump will do when Biden wins the election and he still has two months until the inauguration. I fear he will employ a scorched earth campaign out of spite. You think the  defunding is petty and brutal? Just wait.
This is fucking hilarious weather you like Biden or not
But if your point is Biden has some serious racial blindspots and isn't progressive enough when it comes to racial injustice, hey man, I'm there.
For sure, but tell it isn’t more fun sending Vote Biden to Trump.

or anti-capitalist; they just do not seem compatible in my book; most Biden supporters are just liberal pussies who wanna pretend day-in-and-day-out ad nauseum that Trump and the Republican Party are the only things rotting America from the inside out so 😋  Trump supporter? No.
still a capitalist who does not have the people's best interest in mind who has a damn prosecutor as his running mate; i just dont know abt this chief, the types of ppl who support Biden and the DNC and other normalcy candidates vs. people who are more radical or devoutly leftist
Biden supporter? Idk, even if they might have the betterment of the people in mind depending on who you talk to, their proposed solutions for a better world under capitalism are way too flawed and fallacious and kinda bootlicky for my tastes, for at the end of the day, Biden's
I loved his comments of disgust in Biden partisan polictizing the virus.  Haha. I mean he did create the mask partisan line.

First, I did not vote for Trump, but I might this time! Second, if Trump's daughter had been abused- like you say- they wouldn't have the beautiful relationship that they have today! If you look at Biden's video, children are seen squirming! That's the big  difference!

Biden has long had strong relations with the African American community and often talks on the trail about serving as vice president to the country’s first black president, says  College political analyst Chris Borick.
Hillary raised about $1 Billion in 2016 and lost.  It's not the money, it's the political philosophy; in that respect, Biden will lose bigly (but Dems will predicably resist introspection, and blame everyone else but themselves for their loss).
Threatening a U.S. Presidential candidate?  . What are you going to do about this? Fox News is threatening Joe Biden. A woman whose friends with sex traffickers?
No, America isn't fine with that, to the extent that Dems are also involved with the same activities that you insinuate are nefarious.  America wasn't "fine" with electing Hillary President of the US b/c of Dem hypocrisy, and the same holds true w/ Biden in 2020.  Get real.
Why would Biden decide to step aside? I think he should be very careful now that his running mate has been named.

Biden mispronounced her name today.
I have no respect for women who use men to get ahead! When you're a strong woman in your own right, you don't do that! Kamala Harris said that she supported the women who accused Joe Biden of sexual harassmen. She also accused him  of racism! However, she is now his running mate!
Why would little Black and brown girls feel overlooked and undervalued? Is that how Joe.Biden thinks of them? That's such a racist thing to say!  By the way, hasn't Joe Biden noticed that Harris is light- skinned? Does he know her mother is Indian, father Jamaican? Surreal!
I think that’s the biggest fear is, that although Biden wasn’t my first choice, I still will be voting for him NO matter what. And with the votes that are going to him how the “followers” of the ol’ cheeto are going to feel.

Biden and Harris - Live in Delaware, Now.     #BidenHarris2020
Biden is killing it!  Makes me proud to be an American again.
My husband, a life long Republican, is crying as we watch  introduce  as Vice President. Let’s get this done! Vote Biden/Harris 2020!
Are you saying vote for Trump or Biden?
#WATCH:   appear together in #Delaware. See their event live soon on   #Election2020
In 30 years of voting, I have NEVER voted for a Democrat for President. I’m voting for Biden/Harris in 2020 just to ensure there IS a presidential election in 2024
I don't care about the race or gender of a candidate. I don't care that Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris as his running mate! My concern is about who's going to be strong on keeping the US secure in the face of this "Defund the Police" movement which Harris is okay with!
I see that as a separate issue. The fact is that the Lincoln Project, a Republican group, published a Biden-Harris campaign video, a good one, within an hour or so of the announcement. I applaud that, and I'm not worried about what George's wife was doing at that same time.
Harris thought Biden racist, his star shines brighter in racist homes.
Joe Biden is purely CGI animation
WATCH: Chris Borick, Director of the  College Institute of Public Opinion, speaks to  about Joe Biden's choice of Kamala Harris for VP.
Systemic change takes time. And progress will be more difficult with four more years of Trump, than with Biden as president, in my opinion. It's an uphill battle either way, but more so with Trump continuing in office. All just my own opinion, of course. We each get to have them.
Well, let's see! Joe Biden loves children jumping on his lap, sexually harasses women and.children - lots of pictures and videos to support this- and let's not forget that Tara Reade said he raped her when he was a senator. So, why are you voting for a sexual harasser and rapist?
Yes, he did. That's why I'm not a duopoly fan. And, there are also major factual differences between a Trump Administration and a Biden Administration that matter a significant majority of Americans.
If elected, which part of the Biden/Harris radical left agenda will trigger republicans the most?
The mistakes that Trump has made are minor compared to what  would make. Nobody is perfect, but Joe Biden would take that to the extreme.
Biden announced that his VP pick is Kamala Harris. This is not bad news. Her representation can bring a warmth to the politics of today; she will push both progressive and moderate ideals; she will work for all people. We need people like Kamala Harris, so let's fight for her!
That's actually Joe Biden in the picture!
Frankly,  should be given any damned position she wants. She out fundraised all of the other VP candidates, Biden is adopting her policies with little or no attribution...enough of the silent women doing the hard work and getting no credit.
Yo how great would it be if center-right democrats like Biden, Harris, and Pelosi were actually the radical socialists the far right believes them to be?
I voted for Gore, Kerry, Obama (twice), and Clinton. I'll be voting for Biden, too. Democrats rarely win when their base feels they "have to" vote for their candidate rather than genuinely wanting to, so maybe ease up on the "you have to vote Biden" rhetoric?
Biden is a asskisser for China
Joe Biden Picks Kamala Harris as 2020 Running Mate - Mike Pence Will Fear Her
I'm a white progressive. Not voting for Biden/Harris. Am I an Uncle Tom too?
Cmon how could you say that, the left tells me biden is a devout catholic!
B/c there are going to be A LOT of talks about "What Biden wishes he could do"  and in a pandemic, that doesnt slow disease spread or oxygenate a patient's lungs and respiratory system. It's not gonna matter to the outcomes how he felt when he didnt do anything.
Biden isn't even in office yet.  You have your man in office. He isn't doing shit and doesn't give a damn if you die.   He himself said more will die it is what it is.  He isn't doing a thing.  Why get pissed at someone not in office when your is killing people with indifference
Not a great endorsement for Biden. So his VP is brighter than he is?Trump and Pence will.trounce them in.debates
So the Democrats shut the left out of the convention.  And the platform.  And the ticket.  To "not scare" the Republicans who want to vote for Biden.  So they don't care about alienating the left? They don't need us?  This tent has grown unmanagably big. We need a new tent.
But always right,Babs.China,Mexico,Biden,Comey,N.Korea,the economy....he keeps winning for USA
Why are people angry now, Elizabeth Warren can still be a major component of Mr. Biden’s cabinet. She is smart and strong and is on the right team, let’s stick together. I agree this election is too important to not pull together. Bernie and Elizabeth see it so must we
Uh, I think the opposite has happened, the GOP was taken over by the radical extreme right! Biden and Harris are moderates!
Just a reminder that Harris intentionally hid evidence from trials to keep innocent people in prison. Trump, Biden and Harris are all fine examples of authoritarian rule; this country will burn by the end of the decade because of all these politicians.
Biden has been in government for 47 years and hasn’t done a thing. What makes you think being president is going to change that?
Not true at all. Biden was leading well before Covid.
yea its just soft serve ice cream lol idgaf if joe biden hands it to me
Biden could come out in his Pj’s like Clark Griswald eating a bagel, drinking an Irish coffee, take a shot of Jack, and still have more mental fitness and acuity than president dementia. I don’t even like Biden. A broken bicycle would probably be a better vote then Trump.
I think she's very aligned with Biden, making it a safe pick.  It's just that she's not a progressive by all means.

Biden can’t debate Trump. So don’t worry
Harris and Biden should constantly advertise Trump’s endorsement.
Why are the people who are so vocal about sexual assault allegations ruining lives always the first who call you a hypocrite for voting for Biden? Don’t use victim stories for your personal agenda. That’s fucked up.
Trump Quickly Assails Harris, as Democrats Praise Her
Biden didn’t pick a lapdog like you.
Believe me...Now that this Administration and Bill Barr know that Biden and Harris will be privy to Classified Top Secrets and Getting Briefed on certain things...Know the paper shredders are working over time tonight in the White House...
Kinky Kamala in some way to reference her past relationship with Willie Brown then pondering what she did to earn the nod from Biden...
Joe Biden has prostituted himself to special interests and foreign powers for his entire career, so his choice of a transactional candidate for the Democrat VP slot is perfectly consistent with his “resume”. #TuckerCarlson
I'm impressed she actually beat Bernie. This is great. A nice balance to Joe Biden's centrism.   #BidenHarris  #AmericaOrTrump
Those people were not fully informed  and should not have come down on you. Discuss, yes. There’s was uncivil behavior. I am trans and just ordered my Biden-Harris tee shirt!
Joe Biden is trash too
The first election I’m old enough to vote in and I have to vote for Joe Biden. 🗣NEXT CALLER
And Obama isn't so...biden was catholic the first two times he was on the ticket is this dudes point?!?
Biden isn't dumb.  Why show the dumpster all his cards?  Dumpster is corrupt and will use anything against him.  Can't use what he doesn't have.  Biden needs to get in office then prove what he can do.  He can't be worse than the wanna be king.
Chairman Allen West's Statement on Kamala Harris as Joe Biden's Running Mate - Republican Party of Texas
The Trump campaign statement today wasted no time and referred to her as Phony Kamala because [they lied] she called Biden a racist.
No. Not really.  I dont believe trumps bull shit. He wants you scared of blacks moving i. Suburbs.  Haha. This is his america but pretends it will be bidens.  Haha.  And i care about my next fart more than i care about you.  Wasted voter for trump.  Haha. NJ goes to biden.
“One of the dumbest people I’ve met”??? I thought you only hired the best people? When exactly does the winning start? You make a fool of yourself every time you speak. You’re a failure and a fraud! Biden/Harrie 2020 🇺🇸🇺🇸
Republican, voted trump in 16.  I hate Biden but im voting for America.  And no doubts in my mind i could kick your ass.  And i dont write false statements.  I hope you are in Nj so your vote is wasted.. Biden already won NJ.
The 2 biggest problems in this country right now are cops and covid, and Biden has proven himself to clueless, incompetent, and potentially actively harmful on both fronts, in a way that shows that pretty much fuck all would change in the unlikely case that he does beat Trump.
At this point i don't know what would make me feel better about american voters, trump losing or biden losing.
How long until Biden refers to Kamala by a totally incorrect name?
I really don’t think she will. Biden is a strong supporter for us. And Harris has taken supportive positions both AG and Senator. Could she possibly be worse than trump? NO!
While there are democrats that agree with defunding the police.  Biden has stated more than once that is not what he wants or agrees with.  He has stated more than once he will not defund the police.  Stop the false rhetoric.
That's not true.  Biden is not for defunding the police.  He has stated it more than once.  He is for some reorganizing, education and other things.  However he is not, never was for defunding the police.  False rhetoric from the other side
I don't care who is in power as long as we become a country that values healthcare as a human right, higher education access to all who qualify and a database of firearms with common sense rescrictions. Will Biden/Harris value that over lobbyists? I doubt it but I hope Im wrong.
Nothing you just mentioned from Biden wirh help either of those two problems.
Kamala Harris Is Biden’s Choice for Vice President
Biden has been cutting deals with conservatives for 50 years. You do the research. No radical change on this ticket Mary.
Yes thank you! Biden/Harris 2020!

Kamala Harris selected by Joe Biden as vice-presidential running mate
This is exactly the sort of misdirection you'd expect from someone who's trying to distract someone else because he has been tapped to be Biden's VP
Again:. What, in *your* view (as a presumably Biden supporter) does Biden represent?  Or does he represent nothing to you by virtue of your failure/refusal to answer that question?
Here's you being totally ignorant, as well as a typical Biden supporter (actually, both are the same thing).
What does Biden "represent," in your view?
Biden’s been wrong in foreign policy for 40+ years, and can’t remember what his “policies” used to be. Empty vessel. It’s sad his family carts him around like home health care aides.
Biden’s been wrong on every major foreign policy decision in the last 40 years. That’s not a strength.
No we can't! That's Biden's job.
I hope Biden’s announcement is the same time #BunkerBoy presser.
This election is like the lesser of two evils. I’m not enthusiastic about Biden, but if you ask me what I’d rather have a  shot of fireball (not great, but I could keep it down) or some “Meth.” best believe, I’m going with the fireball. Lol
You know what's not better voting for Joe Biden
And they want to criticize Joe Biden.
Oh yes he misspokelike Biden does,meant WW1,said WW2,but a 30 seconds later corrected himself.
We could help save the post office and have a little fun by each of us mailing one hundred  ‘Vote Biden’ bumper stickers to the White House.
He will protect Medicare and Social Security.  He willwork to improve health coverage.  He will not cut taxes predominantly for the wealthy. He actually wants to listen to someone who thinks like me and not insult me. He has empathy.  You should vote for Biden too.
Biden’s not a boomer.  He’s a member of the Silent Generation.
If you have zero tolerance for stupidity, why are you voting for Biden?
No!  Absolutely wrong!  This means the campaign has to spend precious time with vetting each potential cabinet member.  Biden has 2 months to select his cabinet.  Don’t rush it for the sake of campaign optics.   Get the right people in charge.
Biden’s Veepstakes is the IRL version of the clickbait listicle where you have to advance through 40 pages of ads just to get to the ultimately anticlimactic answer that absolutely does not shock you.
Joe biden telling me he wont forget about me really put me at ease.....
Honest? Principled? Strong? I could go on. Come on man. I am a Democrat but won't vote for Biden.
Hey - it’s the left that wants everything to be shut down. If Biden can do it from his basement, Trump can do it from his house!
And Republicans think Joe Biden needs a test...Huh
Regardless of what the Bernie or Biden plans are...I know that it doesn't include multiple women suing them for sexual assault,  Telling women of color To go back where you come from,  or calling racist "Mighty fine people"...I know "My God" , would never okay that
They should all be charged with treason
Lucy you tell me to my face that Biden doesn't think that picking a gay man is functionally the same as picking a woman
Obama named Biden his running mate on August 23rdUh oh! Liberals better get over here! There's minorities here that absolutely loathe Joe Biden! I bet that's a no-no for you!!!!🤯🤯🤯
So we just went back to full ppe at work ..so happy labor day..here's your candy kids.. BIDEN WINS ....turkeys in the oven..open ur presents ppl  ....HAPPY SAY IT WITH ME NOW .... JUMANJI!!!!
.... I feel we need to have Latinos get more time to speak than most of the whites.  We don't want to alienate the Latino base, they are really important for Joe Biden winning the election as well.  2/2
We need Trump out of office ASAP. I will vote Biden and then fight for structural change because I also don’t believe the Biden/Harris is the ticket for change.
Republicans controlled both the House and the Senate for last 6 years during the Obama-Biden years. Republicans had the House in 2009, when Obama took over.

Biden dodges questions everyday.
the sheer amount of people that are like "yeah I would've preferred if it wasn't Biden/Harris but..." says so much
Yes I’m voting for joe Biden
Your Russian bots are active this morning. You fear Biden/Harris ticket. #UrineTroubleTrump
I am very excited.  Biden will be great. Kamala will be great.
No he is expecting a place in the Biden administration some where for being a good tyrant. Assuming the can steal this election. #maga
Here’s why I’m voting Biden/Harris!
No, he’s ‘calling’ E.T. The New World Order Machine behind Biden, that’s who wants the mandate.
I could care less about Trump vs Biden cus I’m not voting for either ( will get my vote) BUT I’m going to thoroughly enjoy the Trump vs Kamala 2-1/2 Month Twitter War!   Who has the popcorn???
While wearing a mask making a delivery of 30 cases into a kitchen my 02 saturation dropped to 90.1% so now don't where it unless asked Biden and Harris are DOPES#Dopes
She is only a prop for biden to get votes he only brought her on because of color talk about bigot lol People wait up
Biden will be in the White House after he wins in November.
Really disgusting
This would make it harder for Biden to sniff little girls and for Kamala to read people their Miranda rights
ABORTION ON DEMAND. Im gonna pop my tv remote out and start looking for the "abortion" button as soon as Biden is elected. Lets get it.
What should scare ALL AMERICANS is four more years of Trump! More death, destruction of Constitution, being laughing stock of world, blatant racism, VOTE BIDEN-HARRIS!
Trump is running scared. He knows his campaign doesn’t have an answer for the Biden/Harris ticket.

Omg you’re right!!! I’m switching my vote from Biden to Trump now! 🙄
I'm voting for Biden, not a White Supremacist like
It's legitimately good that we very well may have a black woman as vice president. That is a step in the right direction.   However, Kamala &amp; Biden have both historically been "tough on crime" and I dislike the message that sends when people are fighting so hard for change.
Anyone calling Kamala or Biden any kind of radical is (unfortunately) completely wrong. Republicans are either totally politically illiterate or purposefully obfuscating. Probably both.
The best thing about Kamala Harris being Biden's pick is the right attacking her for being "anti-cop" when she was literally a fucking prosecutor lmaooo
I guess you watched Biden/Harris presser. You are in deep shit. And you know it.
serious topic here: you either accept the fact that kamala harris is biden’s vp or you let trump win. it sucks but there is one option and one option only.
What happened to Kamala Harris believing joe Biden’s rape victims. That just water under the bridge now? Her tax plans are going to cripple people. They win middle class will lose
Yes she should run and Win with Biden!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I can assure you, gor ever 1 Biden sign, I see 15 Trump signs
I’m in PA, it is not gonna go to Biden.

6 ft. please.  Why is touchy Joe so close to our next to be great president.   Biden will now win and let K.H. do the thinking for him for 4 years if.
Isn’t the above comment the same for Biden? He does have sexual assault cases which Harris said she believes the accusers. Biden just said you ain’t black if you don’t vote for me and the Latino community is diverse unlike the African American population...isn’t that racist 🤷🏻‍♂️

Can’t wait til Biden finds out who they picked as his VP.  Ha ha. He is going to say “ Come on man, that’s the damn woman that tried to make a fool out of me on stage...  you guys must do better for me “
Kamala Harris most resembles me. She is a child of immigrant parents and grew up in America. Joe Biden grew up in a working class family in PA. Trumps father was a businessman and so was mine. He himself wasn’t in a small business. He started with a 1M head start
Didn't she call biden a racist? 😂 fuck America has the memory of a goldfish 😂😂😂 #bitcoin
Kamilla Harris and Joe Biden celebrating with  “Pat-A-Cake, Pat-A-Cake, a forgetful old man, pick a black candidate as fast as you can. Roll it, Pat it, and mark it with a “B”, you put me on your ticket because I’m darker than thee”

Popularity contest, Biden ain't it... Trump wins by a landslide... but  or  will get my vote lol #Bitcoin
There’s obviously no getting thru to you.The brain washing is complete, but I’ll explain it one more time. There isnt a person on the planet that “supports” abortion.Biden, I’m sure, wishes abortions weren’t necessary.Since you’re against contraceptions,you’re part of the problem
So in your world, both slavery and abortion are despised by the majority of the country. In your world, abortion is illegal but Biden wants to bring it back because he’s “pro-abortion”. Religious people have such child like brains.
So Biden created the abortion laws? He’s somehow “promoting” abortion? What religious people don’t understand is that NO ONE wants abortion. But since we don’t live in a perfect world, sane people would rather women have safe ones...not back alley ones.
Joe Biden doesn’t even know yet.
I’m trying to figure out why he’s not catholic. Has Biden gotten an abortion?

Sorry. Busy watching news abt future US President Joe Biden &amp; Vice-President Kamala Harris. It was much more uplifting and honest. It was joyful and beautiful. It gives us hope that in January 2021 things will begin to change - after a landslide for for Biden Harris in Nov 2020!
She is going to destroy Pence in the VP debate. Just like Biden will destroy Trump in the Presidential debates
Biden is king of virtue signaling. 😂😂😂 fuck the left and the right #bitcoin
I can be excited about Biden &amp; Harris while also maintaining the sense that we can do better. They weren’t our first choice, but they’re the better alternative by a long shot.
I see where you’re coming from there. Whole thing sucks. And you’re right this has been a shallow move from the moment he said “my vp will be a woman.” He’s pandering.  I think a Biden presidency is going to be stagnant at best. No matter who is VP.
Biden’s racist though 😒
Biden picks..
Biden gets only one term regardless is my feeling. He’s a filler we gotta start working on 24 as soon as he wins.
Interesting pick. She does not give Biden CA and she has enough of a record for the Trump camp to get some wedge issues. It probably does not matter--Biden is in a very strong position in that Trump's ceiling is so low but she is not whom I would have advised had I been asked.
If Biden/ Harris doesn’t win this election, it’s  for President in 2024. Let’s see how this plays out. AOC is the most influential politician outside of Trump in America right now. When she speaks people listen!
Biden is a much stronger candidate than Clinton. The Ds needed to nominate someone whose personality is in contrast to Trump's abrasive personality and Biden certainly fits the bill. He is stronger in industrial regions. He has a good shot at GA, TX, NC, and a great shot at FL.
"Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate on Tuesday, making history by selecting the first Black woman to compete on a major party’s presidential ticket." Black? I'm so white, I look like a ghost, but I might be more black than her.
Stupid pick. She is half Jamaican and half Indian, got less than 2% of the vote in running for the Presidential nomination, is from a state Biden will most likely win, ancestor was slave owner, slept with an old married man to get ahead, and women hate her. #rememmberkavanaugh

And Biden has been in office almost my whole life and hasn't accomplished anything.... so surely hes the best person to run the country, right?
Not where i am,  i am just outside Reading and all Trump here. Have yet to see a Biden sign.  I am sure they will come but zero so far
By Biden’s America he is referring to Biden saying NOTHING.against these riots and looting and referring g to the fact that this is all happening in democratic cities,  Biden’s party.  Pretty simple concept.
The democrats running those cities do nothing,  Biden says nothing.  Trump wants to help abd send in the guard but the democrats refuse to allow it.  What is hard to understand here?
In Biden's case it most definitely matters as there is zero chance he finishes a term. You're literally voting for the next president.
Yep,  not a single Biden one.  PA is solid red
“Her involvement is a strategic decision to energize young progressives without tying former Vice President Joe Biden too closely or directly with her agenda.”  So she’s a prop? A mascot? Help me out here,  Person who uses  phone for him?

Biden is not,  many in the democrat party are really damn close and the way they have let portland tear itself apart is shameful
Wallace didn’t mention a single statement for either side because there’s nothing for Trump and so many for Biden, it’s hard to choose the most insulting.
Poor Jailbird Jack.  His delusional world has Joe Biden as President, Obamagate a Conspiracy Theory, and The Clinton foundation as a legitimate organization.  The real world has Trump as a two term Prez, Tucker as credible, and the Clintons as Pedophiles.  Wake up Jack.

What Biden said was politically and ethically true. Black American only apply to descendants of slaves. Period. Latinos can be Mexicans, Puerto Ricans or from a number of other countries, no clarification needed.
Biden campaign has agreed to rules of the three debates scheduled, Trump campaign has not, WHY?
Biden, being the decent, moral person he is apologized for his mis-statement, unlike you a low class thug!
And  saying Biden hates and will just God is not offensive to you? Biden is a devout Catholic, unlike Trumps history of adultry, grabbing women by genitala, paying off porn star and playing bunny.
The I assume also no excuses for this?  Biden has one of the most racist records in politics.  Try doing some reading.
Rofl,  he supports none of those things...  Biden on the other hand. Is a kid touching pedophile and a racist
What is wrong with  In an interview he said  was a Civil Rights Activist. Trump said that Biden hates GOD. I hope this is going to be on an Unfiltered show. The stupidity of these guys. Trump's base believes this crap.
Yeah. The first Black president was so upset by that he never worked with Biden. Oh wait
What does that have to do with what Biden said?  He said that Latinos are more culturally diverse then African Americans.  Which is completely false.
Biden is losing it,  don’t read into his comments to much.
