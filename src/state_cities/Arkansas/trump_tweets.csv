I Thank God Eveydsy For My President Donald J Trump!!! God Bless Him and Family!!!!
Dude...have you ever heard of the #AffordableCareAct aka #ACA aka #Obamacare I'm from Trump country in rural Oklahoma. Even the Trump loving red hats in OK know they already have pre-existing conditions coverage. Are y'all stupid or are you hoping voters are?
Trump is so weak. Mark Meadows damn well knows what is in the ACA... So what is he trying to distract from? Most of the time when he does something this lame brained it is to distract...
Trump would know about puppets.
Trump told the "We Love Trump Because He Is Rich &amp; So Are We" members his Bedminster Golf Club in NJ who were mask less that they didn't have to follow the law because it was a peaceful protest. Like the virus knows this. Like to know how many are gasping for breath soon. Jerks
Why do we need Trump to sign a executive order to require insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions. If you have Obama care, you are already covered. What is this Trump care or some other bullshit.

I'm not a republican, but I understand the why's of the party, I just don't agree.    is a great Republican. 👏🏻His efforts to care for his citizens during this time. To leave affiliations behind, for the greater good. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻  Im sorry this is lost in the Trump era.

LMAO, Obama did replenish the stockpile. He dealt with three pandemics. Trump was in office over 3 years and did nothing. The “stockpile” being gone is 100% on Trump after 3 years. He ignored the pandemic protocol.
Dow TRIPLED UNDER OBAMA. 200% increase! It hasn’t even gone up 50% under Trump and it set records for the 10 biggest plummets in stock market history all because of Trump. Poison.
Meanwhile, not only is it stagnant under Trump, it’s actually DOWN 2000+ points from its high. Trump is just poison. That’s why he has so many bankruptcies.
As I said, it was the same trajectory it has been on for 10 years. Trump did nothing but crash it. As I pointed out, it went up 4000 points in 2016 after it had already been hitting record highs. In fact, it hit record highs almost every day Obama’s last two years.
Sorry facts don’t help you. Trump destroyed the great economy he inherited from Obama and Biden.
Iris running rampant in red states. All Trump. Herman Cain is dead thanks to Trump. Americans dying in record numbers...Trump’s response is “it is what it is.” I guess the politicizing by Trump to try to blame it on blue state governors didn’t work out so well, huh? 😉
LOL, GDP DOWN a record 33% under Trump. Unemployment back to double digits under Trump. Obama did better in his sleep. Even the stock market did better. Trump tried to take credit for Obama’s work and it bit him in his fat orange ass the first crisis he faced. 😂
LMAO, the Dow went up almost 4000 points (over 25%) Obama’s last year in office. You don’t know what the hell you are talking about. Unemployment and minority unemployment only went down a total of 1% under Trump until he screwed it up and sent it double digits.
Commission rejects President Trump's push to add debate against Biden
I love when people’s excuse for bad polls is ‘they’re just embarrassed to admit they’re voting for Trump’.   What?
Guess u haven't read the GOP Bill. The Senate is the chamber that did nothing. As usual. 2 months and nothing from Trump or the GOP. If that is your idea of leadership than u are part of the problem not the solution.
TRUMP PENCE 😃 😃 PROLIFE STOP ABORTION-KILLING NOW
Scamming people is literally objective one of the Trump organization so what's your point
The Bill has been on the desk of #MoscowMitch for ~10 weeks. The lack of leadership shown by Trump and the GOP is apparent.He has even said he can't get agreement from his own GOP caucus and will need Dem support. I know facts make your head hurt but "it is what it is".
Go Trump! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Middle Age Trump girl 🙋🏻‍♀️
Isn’t it amazing he can still demean and demoralize blacks and they still give him a pass, Trump has done more for blacks than any other president besides JFK, and the left hates him, I thought the left was for blacks,

Negative... and we all know it.  Why not do what’s right for the country... get over the hatred for Trump... end the race issues... and vote for the betterment of our Great America... not to bring it down and turn her into a 3rd world country.
Twitter, I see you're deleting people I've chosen to follow and people who've chosen to follow me.  I'm NOT deleting or unfollowing anyone and I seriously doubt anyone is deleting or unfollowing me.  I SUPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP &amp; WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. This CENSORSHIP must stop.
Americans have seen u sit on your hands for ~10 weeks and do nothing. U obviously have no solutions and Trump and your GOP cannot lead, so lets have Speaker Pelosi move forward with the leadership your caucus lacks. Just get the hell out of the way.
Trump
Despite the fact that Trump is an idiot... this solidifies my point that Thune has done NOTHING in the senate or house.  Trump doesn’t even know who he is when he’s been standing right behind #MoscowMitch for years.  #2 gop senator my a$$...
The governors of the red states? 😂  It was all on Trump. The “blame the governors of the blue states” ploy was a failed political strategy that killed a lot of Americans.
We had a much bigger boom than Trump under Obama. The Dow tripled. Unemployment dropped over 5%. We had much higher job creation. Trump never matched Obama’s GDP even before Covid-19.
God is President Trump’s backbone‼️ &amp; these Great United States needs to keep praying that God continues to guide him &amp; give him continuous strength🙏🙏🙏🙌🏻

She blocked me. She supports racist losers. Trump. The Confederacy.
I been thinking about it though...did he inherit Bush’s war like Trump inherited the good economic momentum Obama created? Trump done burnt it up but...he had residuals. Anyway, back to Obama It’s a thought.
How do u continue to absolve the President over this shit show? Are u sure you are American? NY is only a fraction of the problem and u are blind to the lack of leadership shown by Trump and the GOP on the national &amp; international stage. Must suck being U.
Why are they wasting any resources in Ark. He will pull as many crazies from Trump as Biden. Is Trumps internal polling showing Ark. is getting tight? Makes no sense.
Facebook, citing virus misinformation, deletes President Trump post
U said it like it happened. Go Trump
I get it, but do you want Pence to be in a position to pardon Trump? I don’t.
How many easier examples do we need?  Sued by the government for racism (he paid).  Took out an ad against the exonerated blacks in the Central Park Five.  His own lawyer testified under oath.   His own former black outreach ambassador Omarosa Manigault:
Trump is making me sick
If the case was weak, then Trump wouldn’t have paid. The DoJ was satisfied getting Trump to pay for his racism, which is exactly what they did.
Trump said that if he is innocent, he doesn’t settle. LOL
The fact that the Justice Department sued them AND the Trump’s paid a settlement makes it crystal clear that they were racist. Add to that the testimony under oath of Trump’s own attorney of his racism, it’s pretty cut and dry.
Another Trump victory!
Not convicted? They were sued. There’s not a conviction to occur. But Trump settled because he was guilty. Just like he did with Trump University.
Fred and Donald Trump literally got sued by the government for racism. Other than hate crimes, it doesn’t get much more racist than that.
The sad thing for me is that we had a chance to turn over all the swamp tables. But trump simply wouldn’t lead the republicans in Congress to do anything
Trump is promises made promises kept but democrats are seeing he has done that and are making sure he can’t come thru with more,democrats make promises and never keep them, he is making them look like what they are liars and cheaters,they promise you the moon but give food stamps
I’ve definitely had that problem before… But it was with Trump’s tweets😳😡😡
Even before Covid-19 Trump couldn’t match Obama’s growth. And he wasn’t smart or good enough to maintain the economy through the pandemic, while Obama was able to maintain economic growth through 3 pandemics.
Trump was accused BY A 13 YEAR OLD VICTIM of Epstein of rape.
Joe... President Trump is going to chew you up. Go back and watch the debates of 2016 of him and Killary.  This is what ALL Americans will be like, debate time.  I can not wait!
Trump bragged about gawking at the semi-naked teenagers on the Howard Stern Show. That was public knowledge.
I mean, he just wished Ghislaine Maxwell “well” just a couple weeks ago on national TV. So that’s true.
It has been leaked. It’s public knowledge. The Trump cult just ignores it. The majority of the country that actually follows news have known about it for a long time.
Well, Obama did take unemployment from 10% down to 4.6% and tripled the stock market and got 20 million more people health insurance. Meanwhile Trump, who you think somehow is qualified to do anything, has unemployment back up to double digits and hasn’t even hit 50% Dow growth.
Isn't that what we do with the Senate? You had 10 weeks to work out these details and all u did was ignore them. You don't give a fuck about the people. This shitshow is on you,Trump and the GOP. Speaker Pelosi has done her job.
None are edited. Trump was using Mar-a-Lago as a sex trafficking hub for both Epstein (who was living there) and himself, when he was trafficking underage illegals for his “modeling agency.”
LOL, those are brilliant compared to slurring Yo-Semite Trump. Trump is legit having strokes, which is why he’s having to take trips to Walter Reed and getting coumadin.

You can think it’s not difficult as well. I don’t think it’s difficult, either. But I’m not one of the ones that they’ve tried to disenfranchise like the exact examples I’ve sent you. But hey, you believe the bullshit that Trump tells you so why would I expect anything else?
Meddling????? But he’s completely fine with Russia, Saudis, etc helping Trump. Republicans have lost all sense of duty.
Yet when Trump set up his voter fraud commission in 2017 to investigate voter fraud because he lost the popular vote by a wide margin, they had to disband because they found nothing. Ironically, the Dems introduced an election security legislation which the GOP blocked. 🤷‍♂️
Weird, for some reason suddenly Trump doesn’t think it’s a problem in Florida...🤷‍♂️😂

Trump has been popular in KY. It’s not like there is a big lib presence there. It will easily go to Trump in the election and they will elect white (R) senators regardless of who is running. Even the most popular black politician of all time didn’t come close to winning KY.
Some guy I don’t even know unfollowed me because of an unsavory Trump tweet, I have made it!!!
I'm not seeing what you're seeing. It wasn't that great. He allowed Trump to ramble on and didn't press him on so many things. Plus, not a lot of fact checking. Chris Wallace did much better.
Isn’t it great “The Dumb Trump?”  Daddy just keeps talking and saying stupid shit and Biden just keeps quiet and let’s him dig his own hole!  Love it!

I’ve already shown you. Trump was well known as a pedophile. He bragged about going into teenagers changing rooms at the beauty pageants. He talked about wanting to fuck his own underage daughter. He’s been accused of rape by a 13 year old Epstein victim.
Evidence is what shut down Trump’s fake charity and fake university that he was lying and scamming people with. He’s having to try to fire the DAs investigating him. Yet the Clintons are still doing fine with no investigations. 🤷‍♂️
Evidence is what implicates Trump in everything. That’s why he got impeached, because of evidence. Whacky conspiracy theories that go nowhere is what makes Clinton tin-foil hatters go nuts. 😂
LOL  trying to shrug off actual existing accusations against Trump to push non-existent accusations against Bill. Pure comedy.
Of course. He died while in the custody of Trump’s DOJ right after Barr met with him in person. How much more do you need?
Yet, never successfully. None of the “lies” turn out to be lies, otherwise he would sue them for libel, which he doesn’t because he knows they are truths. Trump is the only person using NDAs to cover his corruption. Maxwell doesn’t have an NDA. Neither did Epstein.
They weren’t. Epstein was arrested in 2008 for pedophilia. Guess who let him off with a kush plea deal? Alex Acosta. Trump rewarded Acosta for helping his pedophile friend out by appointing him Labor Secretary.Everything trump destroyed... Health, economy, unity, dignity, peace, hope, respect, and Presidency.  Oh, First Lady too.

He's vulnerable to federal indictment until the statute of limitations runs on campaign finance violations. (Cohen went to prison for the porn star payoffs he did with Trump.) Trump needs to be re-elected or to resign before Jan 20 so President Pence can pardon him.

I am betting that Trump does not want the Repubs &amp; Dems to come together. He wants so badly to become a hero in the eyes of America. He is now considered to be a failure, a corrupt non-president, &amp; the GOP done. So he wants to ride in on a Trojan Horse and make an exec decision.
Translation, Democrats reduced price tag of their bill by 50% in order to get something passed, but Republicans are not willing to increase their bill by an equal amount to make sure Americans can survive this. Not exactly shocking.
Absolutely.  So important right now to pray for President Trump and his family and friends.  Apparently there is no limit to the Dems evilness.  I hope he will stay home with double SService and stay out of the public as much as possible.
Dear mr trump I'm 58 never voted this will be my frist time.your the best .but you need to start on ssi us old fork can't live on what were getting it the big talk with all of us old forks or disabled. Want more vote tell the American people your going to raise ssi.

Trump criticizes Biden for talking about the black community as if they are a non-diverse and monolithic group, yet uses the label “the black vote” so as to refer to them as a monolithic group of voters who all vote the same way. Donny, don’t act all high and mighty
Yup, indeed!  Trump is an inhuman, pompous fool!
He was probably over zealous, Trump is loved by lots of folks and not all are old white men. However, we can agree that throwing out wild tweets and blocking someone before they can reply is weak.
He would listen before trump would! He called for execution of 5 innocent black men. He called mexicans rapists,  asked  blacks what do you gave to lose? As if he know how shitty everyone life is. Name one thing has he criticized whites on? Its all the mexicans fault or blacks.
Ok let just say ill give you that? Ok voting rights gutted nothing from trump. Black lives matter he calls them terrorists.  Wont stand up against  white supremacist. Wont check banks on discrimination against blacks. And a whole slew of other things!
Can anyone show me a picture where Trump has went into the black community and talked with them or interviewed by black media or anything?
WHY would not authorities having allowed years of fake Russia and still being used for the 2020 election, NOT SECRETLY but OPENLY show in detail the evidence of their crookedness. If not,  O' BIDEN and company will be a cause of unfairness against Trump 2020. Don't be unfair!

And your man Trump dropped the ball when it hit the United States!! It is now the #TrumpVirus2020
That wasn't true in 2016, when evangelicals gave Trump their seal of approval.
I can't think of one on my ballot who has done that. Not voting for anyone who voluntarily identifies with the party that saw Trump for who he is and told Americans that he was the best they have to offer.
I hope no one is stupid enough to vote for this idiot. Nothing to do with his money except to try to tamper with the election. #Biden2020 #ScrewKanye #KanyeWest   Kanye West appears to admit his presidential campaign is a stunt to hurt Joe Biden
needs to give it a rest. She has more privilege than most people in this country will EVER see and to whine about being depressed by Trump is an exercise in self indulgence.
Attempts to explain this have been made, but they often start with a binary choice between Trump and a pro-choice Democrat, as if Trump was the one and only pro-life Republican.

Trump and West. Two delusional self promoters. Kanye is off his meds. What’s Trump’s excuse?
Well, Trump is Mortal.. Lets not play Satan.. However, there is little doubt that God has helped Trump. Millions are praying for him. And SATAN would love for Trump to forget that. The biggest trick he could pull would be to get the big head and then follow people off a cliff...
Poor Chris Wallace of Fox News... I think he has a problem like Biden. Only it is intentionally Stupid. Wallace is saying that Trump and Biden is equally bad abort statements and misstatements... IMPOSSIBLE, trumps talks a 1,000 times more Wallace is DUMMY!

The essence of trump’s incompetence is a lack of planning. He’s a “shoot from the hip” guy bcs he has no concept of planning. IDK if it’s a brain disorder or just ignorance, but it shows his incompetence.

Trump definitely ain't it!

my only response is that it really doesnt matter which brilliant woman of color Biden chooses I will vote for him, happily. We dont know who he will ultimately choose so we have to be good with the choice because removing tRump is the goal

President Trump,  Appreciate you briefings , however their sounding like a broken record. Americans need good news , not fluff. We need detailed infoconcerning vaccine . All we hear is you saying is it’s doing well . Eliminate our fear or justify it . Remember Franklin Roosevelt
Trump’s problem is that any criticism he lobs at Biden could be said about himself. That + the inability to intellectually debate issues is hamstringing his campaign.

MAJOR: Trump signs executive order declaring bank robbery a crime.
Trump campaign thought their ‘huge news’ on pre-existing conditions had Democrats cornered — but it backfired spectacularly -
Narrator: What Trump sycophants failed to add was at the same time he signed this toothless executive order, Trump is in court seeking to remove the very protection he was lying about supporting.

The police report as detailed by the news outlet is sketchy at best. No witnesses. Police called after she got home, not at the scene of the incident. Happened outside a busy grocery store. Victim can't name any identifying clues other than they were Trump supporters.
Trump is literally telling y’all he wants to be a dictator.
I’ve been damn near *screaming* this to my black co-workers, family members and acquaintances who keep saying Trump doesn’t have a chance at getting reelected. They seem to think that a large number who voted for him in ‘16 won’t vote for him again. Many will! It’s frustrating!

The sickness in the White House is infecting our society.
I am betting that Trump does not want the Repubs &amp; Dems to come together. He wants so badly to become a hero in the eyes of America. He is now considered to be a failure, a corrupt non-president, &amp; the GOP done. So he wants to ride in on a Trojan Horse and make an exec decision.
Translation, Democrats reduced price tag of their bill by 50% in order to get something passed, but Republicans are not willing to increase their bill by an equal amount to make sure Americans can survive this. Not exactly shocking.
Absolutely.  So important right now to pray for President Trump and his family and friends.  Apparently there is no limit to the Dems evilness.  I hope he will stay home with double SService and stay out of the public as much as possible.
Dear mr trump I'm 58 never voted this will be my frist time.your the best .but you need to start on ssi us old fork can't live on what were getting it the big talk with all of us old forks or disabled. Want more vote tell the American people your going to raise ssi.

This is another LIE by the LIAR IN CHIEF Donald Trump.
Trump criticizes Biden for talking about the black community as if they are a non-diverse and monolithic group, yet uses the label “the black vote” so as to refer to them as a monolithic group of voters who all vote the same way. Donny, don’t act all high and mighty
Yup, indeed!  Trump is an inhuman, pompous fool!
He was probably over zealous, Trump is loved by lots of folks and not all are old white men. However, we can agree that throwing out wild tweets and blocking someone before they can reply is weak.
He would listen before trump would! He called for execution of 5 innocent black men. He called mexicans rapists,  asked  blacks what do you gave to lose? As if he know how shitty everyone life is. Name one thing has he criticized whites on? Its all the mexicans fault or blacks.
Ok let just say ill give you that? Ok voting rights gutted nothing from trump. Black lives matter he calls them terrorists.  Wont stand up against  white supremacist. Wont check banks on discrimination against blacks. And a whole slew of other things!
Can anyone show me a picture where Trump has went into the black community and talked with them or interviewed by black media or anything?
WHY would not authorities having allowed years of fake Russia and still being used for the 2020 election, NOT SECRETLY but OPENLY show in detail the evidence of their crookedness. If not,  O' BIDEN and company will be a cause of unfairness against Trump 2020. Don't be unfair!

The essence of trump’s incompetence is a lack of planning. He’s a “shoot from the hip” guy bcs he has no concept of planning. IDK if it’s a brain disorder or just ignorance, but it shows his incompetence.

1/2: I agree that Trump and his enablers are responsible for the current mess.  But I also think Trump never gets elected in 2016 if not for very liberal Obama, and Obama doesn’t get elected if not for Bush, who doesn’t get elected if not for Clinton.
Trump definitely ain't it!
Trump is a desperate maniac. I feel no sadness for him. More like revulsion.

what’s going to happen if trump wins and he puts someone on scotus who reverses marriage equality? You ok with costing gay Americans the right to marry?! Get real. Most selfish people on the planet.
How so? Splitting the vote, taking votes that would otherwise go to Biden, is helping Trump win the election. If Trump wins the election, these kids, these babies, will spend another 4 years in cages. Get it now?

Trump is officially oppressing gamers.
I felt that way and didn’t vote for Trump in 2016 but, after seeing the Republican Party’s failure to call him out, I will never vote Republican again. They are all complicit.
The good Sisters of St. Agnes used to tell, us when we committed a mortal sin (read masturbation), it was like another stroke of the lash against Christ’s back. Maybe that’s what trump has in mind. Although I hardly think he knows much about catholic catechism.

my only response is that it really doesnt matter which brilliant woman of color Biden chooses I will vote for him, happily. We dont know who he will ultimately choose so we have to be good with the choice because removing tRump is the goal
Wasn't it Republicans that bitched about Obama using executive orders?  And OBAMA was being blocked my McConnell.  Trump has McConnell spinning upside down on his shell.

Trump is a danger to our country
Then they should get out and vote. WE did Trump to outselves by not getting out to vote.  We have no one to blame for Trump but our fellow citizens who failed to vote.
Trump is whacked!

Trump is an anti-christ.  He believes the world revolves around him.
Earlier this year, I introduced the SAVE Act to decrease our dependency on foreign nations like China for medical devices and life-saving pharmaceuticals.  Great to see  take action to bolster American made medical supplies and our supply chain.

President Trump,  Appreciate you briefings , however their sounding like a broken record. Americans need good news , not fluff. We need detailed infoconcerning vaccine . All we hear is you saying is it’s doing well . Eliminate our fear or justify it . Remember Franklin Roosevelt
Trump’s problem is that any criticism he lobs at Biden could be said about himself. That + the inability to intellectually debate issues is hamstringing his campaign.

"Important prongs of Trump’s legal arguments rest on the Supreme Court’s decision in Bush v. Gore (2000), an opinion that explicitly states its decision is 'limited to the present circumstances' and therefore should not be relied on by future courts."
"Trump has spent the past several months attacking states that try to make it easier to vote by mail — though he recently claimed that mail-in ballots in Florida are fine because 'Florida’s got a great Republican governor.'"

“Next week, Dr. Birx will visit Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Arkansas …to deliver aggressive, tailored and targeted guidance,” Trump said at a news conference. That should be interesting.

Oops he did it again. Poor old Joe. I still think the Democratic Party know he is only one with a chance to win against Trump. Then after he gets in they will say Poor old Joe we didn’t know. Then have his VP radical leftist replace him.
These cowardly Republicans aren't scared, they're terrified! It just now dawns on them that with eyes wide open, they have followed idiot Trump off a cliff.
He'll get dragged for it as more people are made aware. With Trump it would've been explicit not implied and he wouldn't be praising Latinos. Joe's campaign will have some cleaning up to do.

Totally agree. I’m no Trump fan, but Biden owes a debate on ideals and if his campaign are really afraid a debate will hurt Biden’s polling (which it probably will) then it’s clear they chose the wrong nominee.

Agreed on all points but the last. Campaign Tate was full-on Trump. I see this new long-winded, "it's all actually very complicated" style as a different voice that makes his inaction look thoughtful to win over rank-and-file. The slights are leftover seasoning for his base.

I find Reeves' Twitter evolution interesting. His language - long threads and appeals to "nuance" - are not Trumpian. The swipes are still there, but hedged in a way that still seems to score with moderates.  It's certainly generating lots of free media, which is Trump 101.
Why doesn't Trump just flash a sign saying ditto to all press questions? His answers are nothing but tinted and tainted garbage.
The progressive wing and the independents will vote for him or not vote at all. His pick won’t help with that. This election is not about anything except who shows up at the polls this time around. Biden is a horrible candidate, but the anyone but Trump crowd is pretty strong.
This game by trump is total BS! Our children will bring covid19 home to all of us!!
5/22: Trump at a press conference announces he is labeling churches as “essential” and calls for governors to allow their reopening, as well as threatening — without authority — to “override” any governors who fail to do so.
5/21: Trump claims falsely that he was “so early. A study suggesting that 36,000 lives could have been saved in the US by implementing social distancing a week earlier. He reportedly ignored security briefings on the coronavirus for weeks.
5/9: Although many states have yet to meet the minimum requirements for reopening based on the White House’s guidelines, Trump continues to push for the reopening of nonessential businesses.
Is this a parody account? When were Americans ever not productive? They were productive before the Reagan tax cuts, before the Bush tax cuts, before the trump tax cuts. I like parody accounts. Also, what’s wrong with healthcare for all?
4/30: The Trump administration allows federal “Stay at Home” guidelines to expire. 5/7: The US hits 75,000 reported Covid-19 deaths; the Trump administration elected to shelve detailed reopening guidelines from the CDC.
4/13: Trump claims to have the legal right to overrule governors’ shelter-in-place orders, asserting that the president’s “authority is total.” 4/15: The US hits 25,000 reported Covid-19 deaths. 4/28: The US hits 1 million confirmed Covid-19 cases.

Right..so who is to Blame? Under Trump a virus infected less than 5 million and under Obama 60 million people got infected. Who did better? The subject is about how the media has turned this political. We are fortunate to not have Obama in office because of the mortality of Covid

Unfortunately, national polls are just indicators of how most Americans feel about Biden v. Trump. That's not how we elect a president, and Republicans are hoping against hope that they can, for the third time this century, win without actually having to persuade the most voters.

Trump managed to make sure his CEO buddies and corporations got their share, now Democrat leaders want to protect the american workers &amp; families instead of fund Trumps pet projects. GOP coronavirus bill includes at least $7 billion for weapons programs

TRUMP IS SUCH A CONSPIRACY THEORISTS &amp; A BIGGER LIAR. HE WANTS TO BE SOMEBODY SPECIAL SO BAD THAT HE’D JUST MAKE UP A LIE IN AN EFFORT TO GET AHEAD OF A DEVELOPING STORY. I WANT TO KNOW WHO WERE THE GENERALS THAT SUGGESTED TO THE PRESIDENT THAT THE BEIRUT INCIDENT WAS AN ATTACK?
We're thinking of it wrong Here's Brian Kemp'S Daughter to let us how stringently Her father and trump have gone over the date to reopen the schools for us #ONEV1    #aNewNormal
At this point I could watch a video of Trump snorting coke off a hookers ass and still vote for that man in November
Honestly though, this will really help Trump win.
I guess I’m not a #LincolnVoter bc I cant vote for Biden. But as a Republican voter for 18 years, 2016 was the first time I didn’t vote for the Republican nominee. I for sure won’t be in 2020 either. As a Christian, Trump is the antithesis of everything I say I believe.
He can't admit he was wrong, it isn't in his DNA to admit he was WRONG.  Thousand of more people will die because Trump did NOTHING and will not do anything. He takes no responsibility and doesn't care. He will lie and distract, but never admit he screw up.
I do think we have to see, as a nation, that it's not just Trump, that he's the mirror in which a lot of us can see our own faces. It took a lot of people making atrocious decisions for a long time now to bring the country to this point.
Astonishingly, they think they can still play this cynical game, getting Mr. Trump in front of EWTN t-v cameras to natter on about Catholics as pro-life  —   When we can all see now with our own eyes just what "pro-life" has meant to them all along. It has meant zero. /4
Why does this keep coming up as a defense of Flynn? Obama was *president* when he told the Russian president that he'd have more flexibility after the 2012 election. Might have been cynical, but he wasn't undermining the authority of the sitting president as Flynn did for Trump.
is right - I can smell the rank hypocrisy of Womack's tweet through my phone.   Check out this thread if you wanna see whose side Womack chooses when he faced with doing the right thing or helping Trump get re-elected.
Watch the full "Axios on HBO" interview with President Trump    #VoteBlue2020
it’s because they don’t need to show up and vote for trump since he already won the primary
With Donald Trump, colorful and crazy are synonymous. Red-hats don't know the difference anyway.
How is it that Josh Hawley destroys Yates testimony; then Lindsey Graham claims he corruptly used the FISA BY accident... While Yates HAVE NO pity on Mike Flynn or any one including President Trump.... I wonder what Graham is  really doing? He had done great!
Under Trump, foster youth are no longer forgotten
Must be true since a trump supporter wrote a blog to trumpsplain it
This thread.   encyclopedic knowledge of the Russia investigation and everything surrounding it makes her live tweets indispensable.   Flynn is a liar and a criminal. Just the kind of person Trump likes and wants to help out.
GOP voter since 1984. The weirdness of the extreme Tea Party not getting called out worried me. Then Romney made 47% speech and I realized was writing off many loyal GOP voters. Then Trump happened. Viva Independence!
misplaced...if it didn't happen with Trump who seems to be a textbook case, then not with Joe and I don't care who his VP will be but that person will be more palatable than having Pence in the driver's seat. IMO...
You do realize Trump floated the idea of accepting from the white house right? How is this dofferent?
why do you think Joe is frail and not Trump? They're 3 years apart and Joe may make "gaffes" or misspeak or whatever, DJT flat lies and makes stuff up. Physically he's in bad shape too. You've seen his mechanics.
From the moment Trump was elected I thought about the Mule in Asimov's Foundation Trilogy. Perfect analogy! 😅😅#Azimov #foundation   The forgotten Trump-like terror lurking in a sci-fi classic  via
Do you guys ever watch/listen to any of Trump’s interviews? I have a suggestion. Watch the Swan Axios interview. Also Fox Wallace interview. If stumbling/yammering/lying/jibberish were a sport, Trump wins the Super Bowl, all the Olympic Gold Medals and every Open there is.
I may be lost but are you saying they think Trump is more centrist (than Biden) and therefore the lesser of 2 evils...?
How many people have left his administration? Does anyone stay? No wonder the delegates want no press at their "convention!" I think that they don't want Trump to represent that GOP.
says that Trump “should be banished to the dustbin of history”. The dustbin should also welcome his republican enablers in the Congress.
do you think that Russia can electronically manipulate votes? Maybe this is why Trump doesn't want ballots by mail. He has plan already set and ready to go. #askroland
So you do support trump, no new wars, and soldiers coming home.
MO voters heard their Republican leaders beg them not to expand Medicaid and did it anyway. Trump,  et al better hurry and kill Obamacare or else some more low-income workers might get to see a doctor. #sarcasm
Jimmy Fallon: Trump’s Latest Interview Made His Briefings Look Good
I mean, if anyone knows about Trump being a source, it would be you, Maggie.
Also, really annoyed at people who are excited to vote for Biden. Aside from ousting Trump, we’re settling - why are you excited?
points out that the All-Purpose Son-in-Law only gets things done for cronies -- the kind of nepotistic swamp draining that is 100% what Trump voters understood was the top priority, right?  Will Trump fire Jared like he did Parscale? #GOPvalues
Well the second part is true! But you know we wouldn't be in this horrible situation if we had a true leader, instead of Trump!!!! This is now the Trump Virus!!
the 30ish % of Trump supporters (his base) treat that support like worship - no room for dissenters. That has been evidenced time and again from pastors to lay persons..."he's the chosen one"...
your gop/trump hush and do what I say money wont save your seat in Maine... the #GoodPeopleOfMaine know what you are and will always be ...#goptraitor #sellout just resign and spend your "twilight years" in solitude and regret
And, with any luck, so will Trump.
Trump supporters are dumb and racist. No other reason to support him.
Trump brings bar graphs he cannot read to interviews. No one is trying to avoid a debate with him. He lives for public humiliation because he’s too stupid to realize every time he opens his mouth ignorance comes out.
No greater example of how much less prepared for a job a White man needs to be than a black man than  being followed up by Donald John Trump. I see it everyday. It’s been on display for 4 years.  The some of a gun couldn’t be a Mayor with his competency and skill.
Yes! Get RID of Trump!!
Y’all be on that false balancing shit, the mans a disaster, don’t soften the criticism. I’m friends with many republicans and have plenty of moderate left leaning views, I’m not an extremist, and I value their views tremendously even when I disagree, Trump is irredeemably awful!
Neil Young sues Trump campaign, deriding use of famous tunes
Get your squeeze balls ready because this will be a Trump landslide. Americans are sick of the Demonic Democratic agenda and the Bozos in charge! Trump 2020!
Ed, there’s hope!! I just saw a great ad against trump by a lady from The Villages. Keep an eye out for it.
Yet you retweet "grab em by the pussy" Donald Trump, a guy who has 22 women who filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against him?  At least Warnock admitted his estranged relationship with his wife.  Plus, medical officials didn't find injuries to her foot.  You're trolling
YO—SEM—Mite! WHAT IS THAT?A Muslim practicing the Jewish faith?A Jew practicing the Muslims’ Faith?TWO FAITHS STRUGGLING OVER THE WORD, HATE! No, that’s the 5th Grader, Donald Trump, who brags that everything he does is bigger &amp; better. His Reading is definitely not big or better
How bout that!  He's already read more books than tRump will ever read.
BREAKING: President Trump on DOJ Investigations into Obamagate: "I Do Hear It's Breathtaking What They Found" (VIDEO)
Where's the picture with her and trump?
Pres. Trump said the late congressman and civil rights legend John Lewis "made a big mistake" by not coming to his inauguration.
You seem to blame Trump for everything, but you don't want debates and insult millions of people for their opposing viewpoints. Joe Biden is a racist, rapist, created bills that disproportionately incarcerated thousands of black men and he has dementia.
Amazon buyers voted Pence,Trump,&amp; the GOP Senate out of office.
He's a "Christian" but has desecrated the first of the Ten Commandments every day of Trump's presidency. "Thou shall put no other Gods  before me." Everything Jason says and does, is to please Trump. Trump politicized the virus, so did Jason. In doing so, he hurt our state
I love Trump!
The Census will incomplete, therefore a failure by Trump and his incompetent political installs, dismal failures.
Finally after years of putting up with the trump cronies the media is calling them out for their shit FINALLY
Someone make this Trump doing this with all of Biden’s nonsense and you’d have your Oscar.
And remember states' revenues are already tanking due to the mismanagement &amp; absence of a coordinated federal response to COVID-19. Now, trump gets to decide how to distribute funds and assistance to states and localities.
It's got trump's campaign slogan front and center. It makes the wearer a walking billboard for the trump campaign.
Can we dub Monty Python over all Trump interviews from here on out?
why haven’t you had  featured on your show? At least Trump can take your constant criticism. He doesn’t care! Jimmy I’ve followed you since SNL years “Corksoakers” days on  .  don’t make Jimmy do this. It’s just content.
Go figure 😒 it's Donald Trump, that is his M.O.I’ve said this every since he said he was running.  This is a plan by trump. Get him in the ballot to pull votes from Biden.
It is only human nature..you can push and push but I have to tell you..Trump has a strong will and is determined more than ever..all this pushing makes one dig deeper into doing what’s right..he will continue the fight for this country...I believe it!
Yes.  is willing to put our educators and children in danger in hopes to hear “good boy” 🐕 from Trump.
I know you think your proving he doesn't mean what he says but do we really want a Trump executive order healthcare plan? Probably not.
I think a nice tight race is more fun. Either way Trump will call for a recount spending more taxpayer money on himself. #golf
I'm not sure what happened in Niger but are we sure he had nothing to do with the Romanian fake Trump supporting group on Facebook?
Then why aren't deaths or hospitalizations at zero because Trumps poison pill is readily available all over the US? Maybe it's because it's doesn't work. Stop enabling false cures so Trump can make money off American deaths.
You realize that over 150,000 people are dead because Trump is a failure right?  Right??
The real Donald Trump subsides and then continue to take two Ester-C tablets each day to keep your immune system strong Ester-C can be found on the VC shelf at Walmart and maybe at other stores also if it works for you too please pass it on to others
The real Donald Trump
What’s your point?  That wasn’t his statement.  Biden is not a good candidate.  It wasn’t about who is less likeable.  Trump is the better presidential candidate and it’s not really close.
Really. You would still vote for trump if he chooses a VP candidate you don’t agree with.  Did you agree with trump on his VP pick of pence
Hating Trump doesn’t mean you have to vote for Biden. They’re both pieces of shit. Look into the independent candidates
So my outrage is directed to people like you. You would rather write in a name and let Trump win again. I understand the importance of a VP but your thought process borders stupidity.
Who’s going to vote for Trump ‘just because’ it’s not Biden?
oh wow..projection, once again. trump is speaking of himself.
I would say Biden has been to church more times in the last year than trump has in his entire life
when and how did trump die? who won the 2020 election? when was #Med4All adopted? so many questions...
Tom Cotton issues threats and inappropriate comments against working americans increased by a magnitude of holy cow since Trump has been in office.
Well that's very true but the only way Trump is going to be taken out of office is if we vote November 3rd. The GOP is complicit &amp; will do absolutely nothing. It will be a hoax &amp; libs just hating on Trump. We have to vote this man out of office.
I don't think it's about Trump although I wouldn't complain if it is.  Perfect timing for them to charge Trump would be mid to late October 😉
I understand, but please vote Trump then. Love him or hate him we need him in the WH. Please reconsider. Have a blessed day.
Yes, but CA is what gave Hillary the popular vote in 2016. That has been used by Democrats to try to delegitimize Trump’s Presidency. It’s important the President wins both.
We really need to watch Illegal-fornia this time. If it wasn’t for that state Trump would have won the popular vote over Hillary Clinton. Democrats would not have won back the House in 2018 without the state either.
They really thought that Hillary was going to get it, then scrambled when she didn't. Nothing has been peaceful from the Democrat party since Trump took office..
Yes but just makes you wonder how much Graham is involved in all this...he talks a big game..expected much more from him..a failure to Trump and nothing but a showboat to the rest of us
The Latinx man running for Fayetteville City Council Ward 1 is a Trump supporter who has horrible opinions on the Undocumented Community and will not be getting my support. He shouldn’t get yours either.
Poor baby! Now she knows how Trump people felt during BO years.
The real one. Trump is unpredictable and I like that! Keeps other countries on their toes.
2020 has been so rough I’m listening to Christmas music in August. Needing that feeling Christmas brings. Also ready for Trump to be voted out.
They're concerned with working Americans taxes, and they want us to pay more, and more, and more. Trump's tariffs were working, alleviating the need for higher Taxes..
he is in trump's pocket. he doesn't care that children will die.
Why chucky and Donald Trump kinda look alike ?! I swear just give em Orange hair ..
That Land Grabbing Act was heavily Democrat sponsored, with some Republicans who colluded with them. Now they're claiming Trump is land-grabbing when it was their bill.. How's that work..🤔
Trump sounds like a clueless person trying to redeem an expired coupon for a nickel off a can of soup in a supermarket. #unbelievable #DumpTrump
Yes, and on the same day that Trump says, “It is what it is,” when asked about the deaths of Americans. 🙄 Priorities are so screwed up, people being considered “human capital stock.”  has been putting the economy ahead of people’s health and safety this whole time.
Trump will blame governors
That would be Trump overseeing it.  That's exactly what he said on the last PPP that came out. That he would be the oversight on distribution of funds.
My favorite part about the Trump Axios interview. Trump (when talking about Corona cases): “The US is lowest in numerous categories, we’re lower than the world!” Interviewer: “We’re lower than the world?!? What does that mean?”
I'm smart enough to demand #Med4All before I give him my vote. Getting rid of Trump is not a good enough reason for me to vote Biden.
there is only ONE reason to vote for Biden. to get rid of Trump. if Biden was smart, he would be for #Med4All - the only reason I would vote for him.
“It is what it is” - that is Trump’s response to 159,000 Americans dying of Covid-19.   Do you know where I’ve heard the phrase “it is what it is” the most?  On Judge Judy. When they interview the LOSER in the hallway after the case. They almost always say, “It is what it is.”
President Trump should be careful of what he signs. Big Democrat support for this, which should be a Big Red Flag. As usual there are republican colluders, that's the bipartisanship that we do not support...
No, the Axios interview is not going to change anybody's mind. But it's still nice when every now and then Trump gets a good interviewer, and I get to remind myself that I'm not crazy and the president really is just a doddering old fool.
America wake up Trump is a traitor and now he is murdering American citizens with his constant disinformation on COVID. Now he wants to infect all our children who will bring COVID home with them. JUST SAY NO!
Trump put his kid in the mix when he said Baron wants to go to school so he demanded all schools open. So all our children can get infected. Also Barons school refused to open so no, Barron isn't in school right now.
Thank you President Trump for all you do and all you TRY to do with no help from the rest of our government and the lying media. MAGA 2020
You just finding this out?  That was a given before they wrote the legislation and Trump signed it into law.  You just got to get smarter and ahead of them rather than always playing catch up.
I'm sorry but Donald Trump has NEVER had a grasp on reality.
Could it be that Trump calling this virus a hoax, anti-mask, poison pill cure, open the economy, open sporting events, open schools, open churches,  was louder than the voice of the CDC, who bent over to his disinformation?
Conservatives aren't wearing masks or social distancing and are literally fighting for the right to infect themselves and the rest of the country for Trump.
Overconfident? They bought the disinformation campaign spread by REPUBLICANS from top to bottom. Trump is trying to kill Americans. WTFU Trump cult, the rest of the country is wondering why you allowed yourself to become COVID spreaders.
Would that be like what a Trump family poll?  They just barely like him too.
for me to vote for Biden, I want #Med4ALL at the very least. if he can't do that, I will not give him my vote. I would actually vote for crazy trump right now if he gave us Medicare for All.
Absolutely not true. I’m not a Trump fan at all but impeached is not convicted. If I’m indicted but found not guilty or if the case is dismissed it’s as if it never happened in the eyes of the law. Same way with impeached but acquitted
I wanted my first tweet to be meaningful...  #MAGA.... by throwing out Trump ❤️🤍💙
I'm a Trump supporter and i am a  registered independent voter. #AmericanLivesMatter
The Trump Flotilla...😉🇺🇸👍
Trump and his flying monkeys keep promoting social gathering. Demanding the economy, schools and churches open while pushing propaganda on mask wearing. What did he say in the beginning about what happens if we let everybody get COVID?
Notice they're all indulging in the Legal Drug of choice...😒 God bless Trump for being a sober President..😉🇺🇸👍
We need to start asking ourselves why Trump wants the USA in a weakened state by continually pushing Americans to Social gather during COVID. Most local churches are steaming live services on Sunday so no, churches weren't shut down.
In direct comparison, yes.  My concern with Biden is to what degree he lets the mega progressives drive the legislation.  Free college, loan debt relief, allowing non citizens to vote, reversing trade reform, etc will do more damage than another 4 years of Trump.  (IMHO)
All I can say about Alexander Vindman is fuck this dude!..sorry for being blunt...and shame on the military leadership for failing to do an AR15-6 on this guy!..he has opened the door for so much..not my military anymore
De-Trump-ification
Her plan is over there with Trump's plan.  I have a plan, shut this shithole country down for 9-13 weeks.  Pay every citizen 2k per month.  Every citizen goes and cleans 2 days a week for that.  Something in return.  We need out of the box thinking while waiting for virus to go.
Tell Trump to fire their a$$es!
U. Donald Trump occupies Donald Trumps head. He could never break through his ego to communicate with anyone but his imaginary friends.
Trump got rid of the Fair Housing Rule to try to get suburban White votes — and also because he’s racist and detests poverty.  But he’ll keep the evangelical vote because he’s just so darn Christ-like.  “Love your neighbor as yourself” unless they’re poor.
Biden only looks ok b/c you’re comparing him to Trump.  He’s not even remotely competent, which why his handlers won’t let him be interviewed.  Covid is NOT the reason you don’t see him campaigning.  There are/were better choices for the Dem nominee.
Trump doesn't bow to Dictators. We had that disgrace for 8 long embarrassing years...
So Trump is removing our Troops and now Germany protesting without masks because of conspiracy group got them out there. Coincidence?
Nope, Trump actually blocked it. Terrifying precedent to set here
Never was, never will.  Not for Trump either.  First time in my life I feel like my vote hasn't been earned by either party.  It isn't free.  Sell me on your ideas.  What ideas?  How to make the rich get richer.  That isn't an idea.  It's a way of life in politics.  Both parties.
They've been desperate every since Trump announced he was running as a Republican candidate for president.
Yeah me too 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸TRUMP 2020🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
I do to their worthless 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸TRUMP 2020🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Typical trump supporters
Trump really everyday gives me a different reason to vote against him.
If Youtube didn’t do the same that TikTok did to Trump 😆
Trump and his republican flying monkeys are killing Americans by constantly sewing confusion about this virus and promoting his poison pill that has been shown over and over again to be ineffective. Corticosteroids is what helped these patients.
78% of COVID survivors end up with heart defects. Getting COVID is going to ruin these players whole careers. Let alone college sports. Why we keep following Trump &amp; Republicans into more cases and deaths I really don't know.
Oh my maybe we should wear dippers too so we don’t have to go in public restrooms and the virus doesn’t get in our ass or anywhere else you fucking idiots🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 TRUMP 2020🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
I’ll never watch or support NBA 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸TRUMP 2020🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Of course I care.  It’s just maddening that we have 340 million people here and these 2 idiots are what we have to choose from.  GOP screwed up 2016 nominating Trump. Now it’s the Dems turn to run make the same mistake
I have been interested in Trump Venezuela since I heard Lev Parnas say Bolton was really pissed about Rudy Giuliani's dealings with Venezuela. Its worse than Ukraine, I can feel it.
Apparently you don't speak GYM, he wants the good doctor to be quiet when Trump is bragging about drinking bleach, etc.  You just don't understand Gymspeak.
We already have them, but the GOP ignored everything in order to stay in power.  That is about to end.  We can Trump-proof.  It's called educated voters.  Teach civics in school again so the next gen understands the constitution and how it works.
Make no mistake. Trump isn't trying to get re-elected to be President. He's trying to get re-elected to stay out of prison.  He gives no shits about any of us. At all.
The more I look at what's happening, the more I keep going back to reading about the U.N.. Barry's hangout, because Communists are all about global government. Trump threw a wrench in their plans, then we got hit by the #PelosiVirus .🤔 OWG = NWO
Who do we think is getting this virus in the South? Trump is killing his supporters by pushing anti mask agenda, amongst opening the economy and schools.
Everyone isn't spreading it, people refusing to wear masks are getting it and spreading it. 78% of people who survive it have heart damage so great job being a flying monkey helping Trump to continue the spread.
And what will people like Mr. Axelrod say when Trump wins and wins BIG?
everyone else calls it the trump virus.

Somebody better order Trump some Sharpies. It’s hurricane season.
I am continually amused at those who think I’m a fan of Trump because I take exception the senile candidate that the Dems nominated.  Not a Trumper and didn’t  vote for him.  But the Dems screwed up royally by nominating Joe.  He could actually lose.
All he wanted to do was to make Americans secure and able to prosper again. His plan was working before we were hit by the #PelosiVirus .. If that hadn't happened, suspiciously when it did, Trump's re-election was secure. Now the Left uses it as a weapon.
It's now called U.N. Agenda 2030. Electing Trump for president threw a Huge wrench in their plans. Then came the #PelosiVirus and the Globalists are feeling empowered to make their move on the USA. If they win, people will never know Freedom again..😠
These idiots come out their inbred woodwork, don’t bother with facts, can’t admit that his skin color was and still is, their real problem with him. Trump has sold this country out to Russia, N. Korea, but you don’t see the outrage. Wonder why?
After going to the Trump Rally in Tulsa.
just found out my favorite teacher is a trump supporter not doing well at all luvGot to do that research!!
Reporter just said people at the Trump presser are breaking the NJ law by not wearing masks. Trump says this is a peaceful protest and not subject to mask rules. Right or wrong Trump throws this crap right back in reporters faces each day. People like that about Trump.
I feel like you went “all in” today with a king high flush and heard “call” and the republicans turned over the nut flush. Literally Biden hiding in a basement trying not to mess up this election. While you and Schumer got Trump re-elected this week
OH MY GOD UPDATE THE TRUMP EZ UP PLACE IS JUST A TRUMP MERCH TENT WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IS GOING ON WHY
Well I personally try not to get to involved in politics, but from what it seems, Joe Biden is constantly rambling and doesn’t seem like he knows what he is talking about, honestly I don’t think Trump is much better at all, but he is better imo. Thank you for asking respectfully!
Are you in favor of a TikTok ban?
As a republican, I do believe Trump would run this country better than Biden, but I do not believe that either are great leaders at all
Them darn testing machines are just like the 8 ball that answers a question. Trump 2020
Woo now don’t start spreading that science around here. Fake doctors, fake virus, fake fake fake. Woo go Trump. Science and doctors are dumb
PRAY NOW  If you read this, pray for President Trump. The enemy wants to remove him immediately. Pray against this assignment. We need him in 4 more years. Cover him in protection now.
i think august 27 is the simpsons episode where trump dies😭
But what if Trump issues executive order today about UI? That’s not helping the democrats support
Haley is just another Trump sychophant.
Yes your right. See the republicans along with Trump have found an opening to steal this election back. They had lost the unemployed but now they seem to be the only party serious about extending the benefit at all. They now offered 2 weeks at full $600 and it was rejected by dem
The working-class will vote for Trump the Moochers of America will vote for Biden
This man was big enough to admit he implied something other than what he was trying to say. Not once have I EVER heard Trump admit he was wrong or offer an apology in any way! Your stance makes no logical sense if your supporting Trump! Facts matter and he has proven his racism !
Intel: US says there’s no ‘winning side’ in Libya  via
My Trump supporting cousin simply, flatly denies that Trump is racist. It's impossible to argue with someone who thinks that way.
I’m back on the Trump train!!! Sorry I took a dip in liberal land. Found out they don’t give a f about the people on UI. Pelosi and her strategy cost me $1200 over the last 2 weeks because she wouldn’t take an extension
If you're referring to Trump, that is not what he said.! He had commented that places like Maryland, needed to be cleaned up.! They were rat-infested, and it's not right.!        The people agreed with him.!! The money is not going as it should.!
You were bought out years ago along with every other republican in office. Worry about your state! Sure, Trump daddy is talking you up because that’s how he controls you, but evidence shows you are failing your constituents miserably. You can tell you aren’t up for re-election.
I don’t give a f about all that other s. Pass the UI extension. Why did you deny 2 weeks of extensions. You cost me $1200. Trump going to issue executive action I’m gojng to have to vote for that orange dude. What is wrong with y’all
Does anyone know what executive actions the president is planning to take tomorrow. I can’t believe I’m sitting around hoping Donald Trump May actually try to help poor people tomorrow. #GTH2020
Does anyone have any idea what executive actions the president plans to take tomorrow? Can’t even believe I’m holding out hope that Donald Trump can somehow rescue the American people. 2020 can go to heck
She’s not doing Biden any favors by handing Trump the unemployed vote when he issues executive order on UI
This statement does not make you look smart I less you want Trump to be reelected. And that's not smart either.
just passed an ez up on the side of the road with blue life matter flags and trump flags and i almost threw up UR KIDDING I HATE IT HERE
Did Obama offer any? That's right, he didn't.!! Stop pushing the blame on Trump.!! The Democratic party is getting exactly what they want.!! Everyone broke, scared, complying with their BS!!
If you think schools should be reopening in the fall but decided that “homeschooling them is the best option for your family”, you don’t think the schools are safe, you just don’t want to admit Trump is wrong.
to    I love all the people trying to help our country. Support Trump! First time I have ever put stickers on my car! My face mask is awesome! I am doing all I can. People are meSm and flip me off and give me looks
Obama did nothing productive. Trump made America every great thing it is now!
Your Daddy dearest is handing Joe the job on a silver platter with his conspiracy theories and his sorry ass excuses on why he has failed America during this deadly pandemic crisis and every other crisis while he has been in office! Everything Trump touches fails!! #LiarInChief
I still think Trump will not debate.
The president said he wants to extend the $600 weekly benefit to unemployed Americans.
HOW SAD IS THIS? TRUMP SAYS: IT IS WHAT IT IS! WTF! HE HAS GOT TO GO!!
Just like Trump’s Tax Plan is disastrous for American workers or should I say Tax Scam?
It’s funny how reporters who support Trump are even laying the ground work for him to dispute the loss!🙄 MAIL IN VOTING ANS ABSENTEE VOTING ARE THE SAME THING!!!!
When Trump wins there will be a response to lots of things going on right now.
Gov Asa *the media wants your kids home not in school and you to be home not at work. This is all for Nov 3rd. If Biden wins the narrative will be turned to "how many have recovered not how many sick" If Trump wins it will be end of days talk as we have now but kicked up a notch
democrats bad, republicans good If you assume this simple-minded framework you can make a lot more sense of Trump's syphilitic ramblings.
The government won’t supply enough test kits to check staff and residents beyond an initial couple of rounds.
Trump is not just Politics.
Im not a Trump fan at all but listen to what he is saying. He didnt say Big deal about that. He was in mid sentence.
Hey, what does Trump’s chair taste like? I’d imagine it tastes like Cheetos, Goya beans, and leather, but I won’t know unless I ask someone who’s actually put their lips to his backside.
Literally it’s getting sad I have to even remove family members on social media because of their bigoted views. No one ever said someone was a racist because of their religion. We call you a racist because you’re a bigot. If you vote for trump your a racist. That’s it. #Resister
a sketch with Trump and Biden having a debate, the environment is exactly like a debate with moderators and everything but it turns out to be WWE Smackdown and the moderators provide professional commentary.
Better yet, how many people vote for Kanye because they hate trump and Biden is too sleepy to run a country? 🤔
Trump Says He'll Help with Funeral Costs for Slain Soldier Vanessa Guillen
Gov Asa Andrew from AP school reopen what is number to make you stop this stupid decision to open schools? Natl Gov Assoc meeting your goals and will this be a counter to Trump? The NGA is a strong voice to help set agenda nationally. I will be chair next year.
No Statesman like GOP leader to step up and take the lead? Any Democrat would be rebuffed? They'll just let the illness spread with no plan? No Statesmen left since the death of John McCain? (Except maybe Romney) Clearly GOP means Party over Country. And Trump isn't a Republican.
Maybe it’s just me. But I am excited to see Trump finally throw #DrBirx under the bus. I was really starting to wonder if her sleeping in the White House and then supporting the Trump admin was more than just politics. I was afraid of a presidential love triangle in the WH #2020
Trump is taking social security out of America this crook is going to continue doing this until we no longer have social security and Medicare. You think the coronavirus was bad.
⁦ I wanted to send this private, but couldn’t. I got my ⁦ cap. Love it, but saddened when I tore off the tag. It was made in China. I’m sure y’all are changing things. Trump rocks!
The south definitely supports President Trump and prolife. There are so liberals here but we outnumber them keep up the good work.
So since there are only two choices, you are helping Trump win, thus nullifying your own handle of socialist. Are you changing it to Nazi or communist since you are helping Trump?
You mean REAL TRUMP FACTS. Those are different than facts in the real world. Thank you President Obama!
The rich got richer under Trump. The poor stayed poor but they got something in return. They were given the right to spread their racist hate in open. They were empowered by Trump. Racism was no longer confined to their home living room but was set free on Main Street
So you are trying to turn people against Biden and toward Trump? And what exactly do you stand for again?
Nope,  Trump
You should really research before jumping aboard! Trump had nothing to do with JE after he was arrested.!! He helped bring down the evil.!!
If we lose trump this year I give it two years before our country’s a communist country.
Reminder, Obamacare and the Affordable Care Act are two different things to Trump and his cult.
Never has a president turned the military on the civilian population. If and president was forced with that decision they would have pain stakingly struggled with a decision like that. Trump relishes in it and immediately chooses to do the unfathomable. His supporters silent
That’s Trumps America. He empowers all the uneducated to speak. These people used to remain silent. Now they feel their hate is mainstream thanks to Trump. That easily makes him the worst president ever
You want to talk about the weather today, I’ll tell you how Trumps a draft dodger, you want to talk about how your wife left, I want to talk about how Trump raped a 13 year old, you want to talk about baseball, I want to talk about how Trumps the lousiest president in history.
wth that gotta do w/ trump? 😂
The FBI was repeatedly dropping the ball on investigating it because those the investigation would lead to control the FBI.  People like Trump know this.
So just because 2 trump supporters are wearing nazi masks that means all trump supporters are also Nazis?
It has been proven in some of the cases.🤦🏻‍♀️ Trump is doing what he said he would!  Cleaning out the swamp.!! Just as hydroxychloroquine, Trump told everyone it would work, but Demorats!! Don't want to hear of it.!! Why?
Wait, did Trump just endorse eating the rich? What is happening?
NEW DETAILS: Microsoft is in advanced talks to buy the U.S. operations of TikTok, the popular Chinese-owned video app that has been a source of national security and censorship concerns.
You usually only see Republicans that no longer hold office go against Trump.
Reminder that the Trump and his cult think Obamacare is bad and the Affordable Care Act is good.
Finally, I agree with something Trump said!!  'Nobody likes me,' Trump complains, as even his allies fade
Former co-worker. FB rants about the evils of the left and her love for Trump. Finally had it out on FB when I fact-checked her. I realized the friendship was always toxic and I'm better off. Anyone that you have to censor yourself for just to keep peace, not worth it.
I totally agree! MOSCOW MITCH AND LAZY LINDSEY HAVE TO BE ON THAT  PLANE WITH TRUMP! TOM COTTON TOO!!
It went POOF because he is clueless like everyone Trump surrounds himself with! He and his clueless cabinets members are responsible for 150,000 Americans death! They thought it was a hoax! Trump dismantled Obama’s pandemic team and replaced it with Kushner and his friends! POOF!
Don’t be president!!!.. please trump 2020
What!!! Are you serious !?! Did Donald Trump commute his sentence too? Geez what’s with that guy.
Trump for President again
Took his team to an NFC championship. Did you see that kid play at Nevada. The way he played football basically ushered in the QB option in college. Up until him it was an urban Meyer gimmick
“As far as TikTok is concerned, we’re banning them from the United States,” Trump said.
Every morning. I wake up and think. Today is the day I get on Twitter and find 0% support for the Trump agenda. I really thought the death of Herman Cain would be the nail in the coffin. The wake up call you guys desperately needed. But I’m afraid y’all are so numb it’s too late
Every morning I wake up and think today’s the day. The day I get on twitter and Trump and the conservatives have lost all support. I thought Herman Cain dying would be the nail in the coffin. But you people are so numb. Nothing will ever wake you up.
If Trump loses, let’s make him legally forced to live in the White House for all of Biden’s term. Imagine him having to remember his worst failure &amp; overhear Biden undo his laws and fix his screwups. I think that’d be torture for him, especially since we know he’ll never see jail
They let this dude back on Twitter. Go racist on someone else’s social media site. Can’t y’all just start an app called snowman. For all the white supremicists and Trump supporters. Y’all can spread your disinformation and fake facts over there on that platform. It’ll be biggly
Did you hear Obama speak? Omg it was so refreshing. Even listening to Bush and Clinton was so refreshing. I had almost forgotten how much dignity the office holds. Trump has got to go. Reagan, 2 Bushs, Clinton, Obama, and now this. I miss having an eloquent president
How does Trump have so many failed businesses and still call himself a great business mind
Why I hate Donald Trump  #ImpotusAmericanus.
PLEASE let them be in the same room with Obama off to the side so trump can’t help but see him!
I think you need to do a little research on the term “expert” or better yet look at the death count from Florida for the last 3 days and get ready. It’s coming to your community too. Your not immune
Although I am a republican I have never been the biggest fan of Donald Trump, however this is why we should want him for next year! He isnt stupid and he won’t defund our police!
Lots of us were counting on checks this month. Remember screw the unemployed but you still want your check. F U. No unemployment no stimulus
Every one said Herman Cain was a brilliant business mind. He’s dead today because he let politics cloud his good judgement
I feel sorry for them to be honest. They decided to get involved in politics and cost them their careers
You guys remember Colin Kaepernick. He had talent. But nobody wanted to deal with the PR.
So far everyone who I know in hospital administration says it wouldn’t matter if she was brilliant she’s a PR nightmare. They don’t want to deal with it.
I agree. Both sides had done this. Trump wanted a new FBI building put into the bill so his hotels value would go up. The democrats won’t pass a UI exten because they know once they do they’ll never get anything else passed. Like stimulus checks
That’s good. Because if she’s going to go look for unemployment she won’t find it. She can thank her party. I’m sure on the Dr salary she’s got some real bills to pay. $600 a week plus would’ve helped her tremendously
A thread that any statement that promotes basic human decency is anti-Trump and taken as such by his cult.

Yeah but he figures Trump will just take his sharpe &amp; draw a line through that section. He can still get fired you know. Once this gig is up he will be a has been, no one will elect him as dog catcher even.
Going from listening to Obama, Bush, and Clinton a few hours ago to Trump now during the briefing and I can’t believe this man is in the same company #dyingforTrump
Trump ruined our state, most of the hate that comes out of people’s mouths here came out of his first

So Ray!! If Trump supporters are racist!! That makes you a Pedophile.! 🤷🏻‍♀️
I’m with ya. And it was completely irresponsible of him, Trump, and everyone who went without a mask(or even with one). But it doesn’t warrant celebrating someone’s death, as a majority of the commentors to his tweet were doing.
Read the comments. I’m pro-BLM just like the guy who tweeted this. But you can’t tweet like he died because he supports Trump.  If it would’ve been a politician on the other side, a tweet like this wouldn’t have happened
Trump is a fascist - AND - NATO should have disbanded at the end of the Cold War. A poorly sourced Afghan government rumor about Russians should not be used to delay removing U.S. troops from Afghanistan.
Their logic is that if there is a handful of bad apples that are trump supporters then that automatically makes every single trump supporter racist, a white supremacist, and they hate every black person they see.
Probably? Beyond the scope of my knowledge. Still, i'm not resting my hopes on the effectiveness of the DeSantis and DeWine administrations or their willingness to stand up to the Trump administration.
No, and why would it?   If Trump is going to forego Democracy to keep his position, why would voting help?
contracted not long after attending Trump's rally in Tulsa... Can't be related, right?
Another RWNJ TRUMPER bites the dust. NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL WINNING. More Trump rally's are needed asap.
HERMAN CAIN GAVE HIS LIFE TO ATTEND A TRUMP RALLY INSIDE WITH NO DISTANCING OR MASKS. THAT RALLY CAUSED A SPIKE OF CASES IN TULSA WITHIN 1-2 WEEKS AFTER LOW ATTENDED RALLY. HOW MANY GAVE THEIR LIVES TO BE BORED OUR OF THEIR MINDS? TRUMP SHOULD BE PROSECUTED FOR MURDER!
Trump is the master at trolling and this will indeed give the media something to talk about for the next 24 hours. You really never know his long game or short game but its something we will never see again.
HEY TRUMPERS, TIRED OF WINNING YET.   DIE TRUMP!
President Trump floating the idea of delaying the elections. What do you think?
Does Trump realize 95% of all Americans hate him for his stupidity &amp; lack of leadership during this pandemic. Other than ULTRA GREEDY REPUBLICANS &amp; PROUD LOUDMOUTHED RACIST everyone else &amp; some of then JUST WISH YOU WOULD DIE so we can look forward to being normal again.
Trump needs to just DIE!
DIE TRUMP!
Just DIE Trump!
TRUMP'S NUMBER 1 IN SOMETHING. THE WORST ECONOMY 2ND QUARTER IN HISTORY. ONLY WAY I SEE THE USA GETTING A HANDLE ON THIS VIRUS &amp; THEN OUR ECONOMY BACK WORKING IS IF YOU JUST DIE!
Arkansas loves Trump! And You Judge  Jeanine❤️
And he was born in Hawaii, last I checked that wasn’t an Arabic country. And if other people’s words are enough, what about the 2 young women with protective orders against trump cited in the original Epstein case in regards to his sexual misconduct?
Trump literally just advocated for segregation, if you want to argue that it wasn’t racist segregation, fine. We’ll just call it what it is at it’s core aside from the racist implications, it’s another man from a rich family publicly expressing hate for the poor.
Trump just endorsed a doctor who said STDs were spread by people having sex with demons and witches in their dreams and that the cure for COVID was derived from Alien DNA saying she was a “brave warrior of truth”. And what evidence do you have Obama was Muslim?
Thats a gross assumption.  I'm 30, never graduated from college, and live in the south, but I never voted for Trump.
If anybody sees conspiracy theories from Trump about hydroxy chloroquine working or other people retweeting it, please report as spam! #TrumpVirus #TrumpThreatensAmerica #TraitorinChief #trumpdeathtoll150kYou go, man! Trump, Trump, Trump!

Amen. FOX Polls say Trump is down only ccx 2 in NC.
Yes, but that is fine. They are all endorsing Trump!
The key is to find the intellectually honest. If you like Trump and can’t criticize him. I can’t listen to you. If you hate Trump and can’t see ANY good in what he’s done, I feel the same.
The definition of a hypocrite is a Trump supporter trashing Clinton's morals.
No it's  not.  it's been used for ages, only become bad because Trump said it &amp; he votes by mail himself.  He is fooling people like you don't believe what trump say.  He is a bad person.  Don't follow him, please
who told you that?  No one but Trump and his base because they &amp; you believe everything he says when he lies daily.  He doesn't accept the truth no matter how it is presented. You are a copy cat. Don't do that, please
Tammy, you need to look at what is really being done not what Trump say is being done.He is a chronic lier and lie daily with over 150 thousand dead because he neglected his duties as a president. With false treatment offer.
Chris Ruddy, your head is so far up Trump's a ** until you can't see the truth.  Yes , he gave money to help but he had to be pressured and egg on to do it. On his own, he is clueless on what to do, then retreated some crap for a woman really sex with aliens.

Right. If hydroxycloroquine is the answer, then Trump would be correct and they just can't have him being correct. Listen up, America. Trump is correct! Hydroxycloroquine, zinc, and azithromax would probably  control the virus, then there would be no need for a vaccine!
Not saying that he loves Trump
Biden is as much of a criminal as trump is.I fuckin love your Biden artwork!  Please do the Donald too for balance &amp; to show just how shitty the 2 Corporate Imperialist "choices" truly are.  As Assange said of Hillary vs. Trump, "it's a choice between cholera &amp; malaria."

I think we’re screwed either way. Trump or Bidenz That’s why I’m praying so hard every night.
I don’t think trump or Biden should be running the country. Biden has been saying the whole time he needs a VP who can be POTUS day one. Obviously something is off with Joe. I don’t see him finishing a term &amp; Trump, I have a long list of reasons why I can’t get down with him. Ha
Not only is a typical stupid Trump lie, but, okay, yes it's less lethal for kids, but that's how they get to spread it to vulnerable parents and grandparents. A basic virus goal is to not kill the host so it can SPREAD.  Trump really is that stupid.
So trump is out there announcing things he doesn't have the authority to do and that he's running on Obamacare while trying to dismantle Obamacare 🤷🏾‍♂️  Sounds about right 🤦🏾‍♂️
The absolute best kind of person is the 64 year old, no sleeved Facebook guy who is genuinely saddened that he’s the only person who gets it, and cannot believe Trump doesn’t have a 💯 approval rating among both parties    also doesn’t believe  knows Epstein

Actually, I tend to think the Chinese want Trump to win. With their longer-term mindset, they will weather the tariffs in exchange for Trump’s damage to the US and more importantly the long-term damage he does to our allies and relationships.
As soon as Trump is gone CNN and the democratic establishment gotta go too
It’s August 7th, and President Trump and Congress still don’t have an adequate national testing strategy.
Trump is a fake. His grades were low. His billionaire status is because foreign Money kept him afloat. He is a moron. If that is cosmopolitan than that’s the only thing I agree with.
Gives Trump plausible deniability. "Yeah Pompeo told me he already took care of whatever that Russia thing was".
A federal judge has dismissed Oregon Cattlemen's Association's challenge of the Trump administration's Clean Water Act rule.
This may actually work to get the Trump administration to look onto election security. Since he may not be the only one to benefit he could be forced to act.

Trump mentioned HCQ during a presser &amp; the media and opposing party went nuts &amp; took an adversarial position. Then they dug in.  Let the medical community figure it out. Keep politics out of medicine.  HCQ: Rita Wilson Karen Whitsett Amy Klobuchar

WoW!!! Pretty Darn Nutz!!!The 7 Craziest Things Donald Trump Said in His Axios Interview Everyone Is Talking About | Vogue...
Just saw someone compare H1N1, which had 12,500 deaths over the course of one year in the US, to COVID, which has 159,000 deaths over the course of several months, to talk about how attacked Trump is 🙄
I can’t wait to see that Trump AXIOS interview be dramatized in 30 years and lose all the Oscars to other confused, old white men.
How Dare JFK and Brother BOBBY run this country without CONSENT of the DEEP STATE! HOW DARE PRESIDENT TRUMP RUN THIS COUNTRY WITHOUT CONSENT! LIke "GONE WITH THE WIND" QUITE FRANKLY MY DEAR, I  DON'T GIVE A DAMN! PRESIDENT  TRUMP and JFK are PATRIOTS! WWG1WGA 2Q2Q LANDSLIDE!
Lmao this is your “SMART”, powerful, , and “honest” republican leader. He can’t even understand what a proportion is and we were taught that in 4th grade. If you still fw Trump you’re dumber than he is.
Trump wants to put millions into the poorhouse. Kills hundreds of thousands due to virus inaction. The gop is a criminal organization
"The governor's MADE Trump do it!"
He lacks the capacity to be POTUS. Wise men know what they know &amp; know how to leverage others on what they dont know. He’s incapable of a lot of things which is unfortunate for the country. We’ve significantly lowered the standard for POTUS. “Trump being trump” is inexcusable!
if you guys make a top 10 most controversial things President Trump has done in his presidency, I'll stop badmouthing your content and subscribe
we look to you for current reports. Ive watched you for years. Compared to  your challenges to Trump all these years has been pathethc. DO SOMETHING!
President Trump OTOH has covid all squared away and it will soon just disappear..... poof......
Law enforcement that does this kind of shit, is politics over the oath of office. I served for 20 years. Never once did I put my political views out there for anyone to ask if I was being fair to everyone I served. If you support Trump, take the badge off and just become a thug.
When you read anything Trump says unless  is on the screen
When I see how Trump talks about Absentee voting versus Mail-in voting
Like wooden Trump nickels?
Trump is that arrogant! He thinks his lawyer's and position of power can keep him out of trouble....And yes the attacks on Biden are unfounded.
What a petty little bitch Donald Trump is. Axios exposed his blundering ass.
Trump was never going to win 2016. But to our horror he did.  I don’t want another fascist, warmongering, racist in 2024 or 2028.
Trump is polling at 28% in California. 😅
Are we sure trump even passed 6th grade? Such a stupid Individual (1)!!
Not sure I'd consider it Trump's finest. It's not that he doesn't have any solid points to make, but damned if I could figure out if he ever did.
Perhaps you saw the Trump Axios interview? Trump is demonstrating TDS without requiring any assistance.
Wait...is this real? Honest question haha. Seems like an SNL skit that they got Trump to show up for.
Cotton trying out Trump level grift is why we need a full reckoning of this administration now and after the election. Nothing short of an authentic and empowered truth and reconciliation commission will restore our democracy and dissuade others from following his blueprint.
INR! Watched the HBO interview c Swann and it's ludicrous. Trump is physically incapable of accepting that which doesn't fit his narrative. No wonder that his 30% base will never abandon him. They didn't quit Nixon either for most part.
Remember when trump told us that the warm weather would kill the virus in the summer and also that we should inject bleach into our bodies to combat the virus?  This President is a catastrophic American failure.
Trump thought he was quoting "We Are the World" song, but his memory could be better....
“The anti-relief faction, with its sudden warnings about deficits, is eager to revive the Tea Party spirit, and its would-be leaders are ur-Tea Partyers like Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.” Donald Trump strangled the GOP. These guys are the nails in its coffin.
What a pathetic asshole.
Perhaps there should have been some sort of orientation program to introduce Donald Trump to the country he is in charge of leading (which is still seems impossible btw). He might like it more if he knew anything about it - it is actually a pretty cool place.
Wow  is incredible. This is what patriotism looks like.   He was able to elicit some of Trump’s thoughts on mail in balloting which are truly terrifying:  A two-part strategy of dialing up mail in ballots and challenging the same process in key swing states. Scary.
That's nothing compared to all the allegations against Trump and the fact that he he has settled in so many of the said incidents to avoid further legal trouble
Again, the amount of spin coming from the Trump administration is appalling. Own up to the fact that you ruined our covid response. Better yet, how about you resign? Thanks.
Smooth, you get corrected on an issue so you change the entire subject so you can still complain about Trump when this conversation had nothing to do with the pandemic. God forbid you have to reevaluate the people you look up to.
Forget Tik Tok. Trump needs to go after that show Masha and the Bear. That’s a Russian show trying to brainwash kids for sure.
I know this is where professors say something about how this reminds them of their worst student - but I’ve never had this student. Trump is *exceptionally* ill equipped for &lt;sweeping gesture&gt; everything about this moment. Even after all this time, it is stunning.
#Karma and I don’t mean for the journalist                               Journalist covering Trump trip to Florida tests positive for coronavirus
It's funny you say this about Biden when trump has actually been accused of pedophilia and been linked to Jeffrey Epstein.
I've been wrong before, but who was the last Pres to lose 65+ vote and win the election? It might not be a Carter blow out, but Trump will be stomped in votes and electoral college.
Hes not trump
Trump saying the death toll “is what it is” &amp; his comments in regards to John Lewis really got under my skin. 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Trump’s in a tough spot. He has 2 show face 2 help his re-election chances but when he does interviews he shoot himself in the foot. Same 4 Biden but the only diff is most ppl dont like Trump &amp; lack confidence in him. it’s crazy that both candidates don’t need to talk 🤦🏾‍♂️
R u serious? Trump’s politics have slain enjoyment.
The U.S. Postal Service definitively said Monday that it had the capacity to handle the added volume of mail-in ballots in November's general election after President Donald Trump questioned its ability to do so.
160,000 dead with President Trump in charge. And more every day
I've got to do this, how many children will get the virus? How many parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters and others will fall I'll or die or both because this president is determined to force schools open! ENOUGH TRUMP, now your trying to kill us through our children!!!😠
Donald Trump is not a good person
a 👏🏻 vote 👏🏻 for 👏🏻 freddy 👏🏻 fazzbear 👏🏻 is 👏🏻 a 👏🏻 vote 👏🏻 for 👏🏻 trump 👏🏻
I watched 6 Caucasian frat boys hang up their Trump flag outside their house today as I drove by. It read “Trump! NO MORE BULLSHIT”. They were so proud of their flag...we need to vote y’all. #cantletthemwin
If your bipolar you are unfit to be president, am I wrong? so I believe he is simply maybe unintentionally aiding Trump by potentially stealing some votes from
“His university did everything right.” Your son’s probably crippled for life all for a game and to keep Trump from getting his feelings hurt, but sure Deb
Proof is in the data. Prople are so against trump they won't listen to him. So oh well i guess
PRESIDENT Trump mentioned HCQ last MARCH as a "POSSIBLE GAME CHANGER" to force the DIMocrats hand. They had a CHOICE of agreeing,  or PUSH OUT an off the shelf vaccine for MEGA BUCKS, or Collude with the MEDIA to silence reports of HCQ EFFICACY to keep their LOCKDOWNS!
DOCTOR SIMONE GOLD deserves our support! One of many voices being punished for advocating YOUR RIGHT TO HEAR the TRUTH! It's the MEDIA who censor, gives HALF FALSE NEGATIVE REPORTING about PRESIDENT TRUMP'S Presidency. These Doctors facing retaliation for their position on HCQ.
Trump tweeted a campaign ad that shows someone petting a dog  the 23 sec mark.  It's obvious we're supposed to think it's Trump.  Trump never touched Conan the dog. Here's the footage of that event:
Also remember that Trump didn't win the popular vote and that 2 or 3 electoral voters broke the rule that they were supposed to vote what their people voted for and were summarily fired afterwards. Hard to maintain trust in a system that can just break rules wherever they want.
Trump will be tweeting crazy shit soon.    you have a huge liability problem. He may be indicted before the election.
One thing is for certain above all else, our potus, tRump, is one hugely, misogynistic, bigoted asswipe! And I am being kind.
Anyone on the Trump campaign that thought it was a good idea for an ad to be someone holding signs was just asking for this.
No. Trump MUST BE SOUNDLY DEFEATED. Trump must be voted out or will merely be replaced by another psychopath fascist like DeSantis or Tom Cotton.  Complete repudiation of criminal cabal like that of W Bush regime.
I hear Biden is leading Trump by 100% in China. Maybe you could start there. China. You Kook!
This is Trump working hard.
I only have one expectation. That they not be a rabid mass murderous war pig....neither Trump nor Biden make this low bar
Holy shit. Trump has forced Dan Rather to tweet this roast. ❤️
That 96% approval rating that Trump claims he has within the Republican party is roughly the same percentage of Peoples Temple Cult members who died for Rev. Jim Jones in the Jamestown murder-suicide pact of 1978 (The event where cult members drank cyanide laced Kool-Aid).
“What’s the worst thing? You’ll be an ex-senator? They are the Trump Generation. It’s how they will be remembered. Like the segregationists of old.”
Trumpkins who think Trump will fight to bitter end need to remember his bankruptcies which means he SCREWED his creditors 3 times! Trump cares ONLY about Trump and he'll retreat to FL and Trump Inc. Rubes caveat emptor.
I'll be following advice of TRUSTED professionals, not antiscience goobers, not Trump or his bum-kissing hacks or criminally credulous anti-vaxxer bent spoon's. How the hell did we get here?
I don't think Trump will defy election result very long. Republican's won't have stomach for him after they get shellacked and unless it's razor thin result he's done.  This will be long delayed reckoning for imploding GOP.
This trump crime family has gotten away with so much. Time for a reckoning
the lady who told us that Trump is a great leader in the fight against COVID, now tells us there is a problem but plenty of reason to be optimistic.  She is a Trumplican fool.
Yeah!  The EPA has been almost eliminated under Trump.
“Free vaccine with every verified Trump vote”
Scare tactics in a pandemic, classic Trump
Would like to see if Trump legitimately has attention span to draw clock face WITH number placement. I believe he CAN, but he's never HAD to do anything.
#votebluetosaveamerica2020 America can’t survive 4 more of trump
This is troubling me: Trump and his enablers have strained democracy to the breaking point. Checks and balances have largely failed. How do we keep it from happening again? Trump is not the last unfit person to get elected president. There will be others.
No thanks from yours and Obama’s administration. Trump saw the importance of space for our countries safety and to further science. Funded  it not defund like your party thinks to do with police also.
y’all are pressed our tax payer dollars could go to help homeless people or provide abortion services, but not that we pay for Trump’s golfing trips??? (of which he’s spent over 365 days doing since taking office)
Trump (IMHO) isn't really that wealthy or particularly attractive, but he IS president. Fascism was good for many businesses in Nazi Germany- notice any parallels yet? Nazis don't have to rise from the dead for fascism to be dangerous.
Typical. Trump supporter getting in the way of science. #SplashDown
As somebody who works for Fox News in Fayetteville Arkansas Donald Trump is losing an every single pole
Thank you for the support of the American  People.  Please know that Trump is an idiot.
Yes I have heard of one lol. Hipocrisy? What makes you think that. Obama was anti American Trump is pro American. Yeah sorry bud not gonna support a corrupt president like Obama
Are you sure Trump and the Republican Party are not letting the virus run rampant as another way to suppress the vote across the nation, specifically the south? If they will close voting stations, slow the delivery of ballots at the post office, they will allow people to die.
If you do not want to let the left run things but want Trumpism out of your party, you are going to have to become a centrist right independent and vote against people who run for office who have Trump and current republican traits. Conservatism may never fully recover.
Curious if maybe Trump will "punt" to governors in such a way that makes them the "big bad oppressive gubmint'" while he remains "De oppresso liber".
Congratulations you just won the award for the dumbest tweet of the day. Do some research! A LOT of what Trump is trying to do is blocked or held up by the senate and or congress.
GOP so ashamed of what they’re doing to fuck America, they want to keep it a secret. If I were foisting that turd blossom on America, I’d want no press coverage either.
You being a jerk
Honestly Ray, it seems that Senate Republican's are so terrified of crossing Trump  for whatever reason.  You have NO idea how much I miss TOTN that gave voice to all of us.  Podcast?
I've read some dumb shit in my life but that Hugh Hewitt opinion on trump's record is the dumbest shit. Would someone near   let him know he has orange spray tan around his lips, that shit rubs off
I can count the dead Americans who died because your goddam sorry excuse for a president and his cowardly sycophantic gop cronies called Covid a hoax and refused to act until it was too late. Those deaths are on Trump’s hands. How’s that’s for dead, jackass.
This is William. He’s a trump lemming. He believes there’s a new civil war coming and he can’t wait for it to get here so he can play dress up with some “real men”.   William’s a dumb dumb. Don’t be a William.
VOTE DONALD TRUMP OUT!
When you talk about the effect of the 3rd party vote in 2000, you could tell them that in 2016, the 3rd party vote &gt; the difference between HRC and Trump in 13 states &amp; 1 district in NE=155 electoral votes. That’s more than 2x the effect in 2000. But that is still depressing.
I’ve been to a ribbon cutting ceremony celebrating the opening of a new section of freeway  that had a bigger crowd than Trump’s speech... and it was raining that day.
UNITED STATES CITIZENS said "ENOUGH", "I'M MAD AND NOT GOING TO TAKE IT ANYMORE!". WE VOTED IN PRESIDENT DONALD J TRUMP to dismantle the DEEP STATE'S CONTROL! PROSECUTE THE CABAL of the Shadow Government! Bring back CONSTITUTIONAL RULE OF LAW AND ORDER! WWG1WGA 2Q2Q LANDSLIDE!
NO COINCIDENCES! CDC, WHO, FOUNDATIONS MONEY, CHINA, DNC has much to account for! Fear is an EMOTION! PLANDEMIC is aa instrument of control of FEAR! ANTIFA/BLM MERCENARY RIOTERS are used to destroy President Trump's "Opportunity Zones" that made inroads developing inner cities.
This is the type of person that comes to mind when I think of trump supporters especially ones that agree with everything he’s done and support everything he’s done. This is the type of person Trump has unpowered “wonderful people” don’t be a blind Trump supporter
A bit overdue, but welcome
Unfortunately for Trump's unclever cabal of criminal idiots those of us in health care will such chaotic evil trixy Gollum manipulations not soon be forgetting my precious
OH TRUMP. yeah I 100% agree, he sucks and does care about us lmao
Milwaukee Police Officers don't want to go to a slaughter planned for them. Bernie Bros are going pay retribution for another 4 years of President Trump's presidency and NO BERNIE BURNING? Nesting shooters, that makes martyrdom of the ANTIFA/BLM MERCENARIES vs POLICE OFFICERS.
Wahhhhhh. Trump was colluding with russians agents. Russian intelligence was embedded in his campaign. Grow a pair Cornyn.
I hope for cause of death on every single person that has died because of COVID-19, it says “homicide by Donald J. Trump” because at this point you are choosing to ignore the facts and are murdering people. see you in November, pandemic or not.
Obama got flak for the color of his skin, but never for this kind of incompetence because he simply is not capable of being this awful. it’s hilarious how much it bothers trump
I dont support trump at all, but tik tok is on the extreme side of being an insecure, sketchy, data stealing app. Im not defending other apps or our terrible president, but progress is still progress.
Seems like many Trump supporters not previously right wing changed because of frustration that "system" would never change, thinking it would take a "maverick" billionaire. But a Manhattan playboy hustler con artist is what they got.
This makes me think- is Pence the master mind and Trump is spewing everything he crafted? Downright frightening!
Trump is for the people, not for socialism!!!!  God bless him!🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼  #Trump2020
Americans are in a fight for survival against their President.   America vs. Trump
This is the anti-tRump video, “The Liar Tweets Tonight” sung to the tune of “the Lion Sleeps Tonight”. It is certainlyworth a listen!In the US Trump has appointed a climate change denier and coal industry executive to head the environmental protection agency (EPA). This appointment is very Trumpian. Vultures now will have a free reign scavenging the park.
It’s already the law thanks to Obamacare. Trump thinks we are ignorant enough to believe him on this. How hypocritical.
Steve Jobs’s creation has turned into Tim Cook’s Apple, a triumph of method over magic.
And when Trump is voted out, Dejoy must be tried and convicted along with the rest of Trump’s criminal gang. No mercy for any of them!
America needs President Trump for 4 more years!! 🙏🏻🇺🇸
6 yrs ago I joined twitter. 6 months later they put me in jail for saying something bad. Took me 4 yrs to decide to rejoin. Only on here to support Trump, and other retired veterans!🇺🇸
Neither  or  are worthy of anyone’s votes.. vote 3rd party. Show them both that you are tired of the bullshit! Vote  I bet money neither has be cojones (esp Trump) to ask why a lifelong GOP is voting Libertarian
When's the last time Trump won a Nobel prize? or Congress impeached Obama?  We didn't deserve 160.000 dead because your hero was more concerned with getting flavored vaping products back on the market, than stopping a pandemic.
AzzO the Asinine Trump!
When's the last time Trump won a Nobel prize? Or Anyone impeached Obama?  We didn't deserve 160.000 dead because someone was more concerned with getting flavored vaping products back on the market. Than stopping a pandemic,
Make an album and donate all the proceeds to BLM or other organizations Trump hates. I would buy 10
What’s sad is i know people who will fall for this shite, hope they’re ready for a full on dictatorship bc the U.S. won’t survive another Trump term
I’m fine with this—good with it even! Navarro has been consistently anti-Trump from day one. Glad the campaign is showing it’s serious about winning in states like FL and TX, both places with lots of moderate and center-right oriented Latino voters.
Trump prolife not according to his puny legislation!
President Trump!! 🙏🏻🇺🇸🤟🏻
We too pray for you AzzO the Asinine Trump! Here is our prayer “May God Bless &amp; Keep AzzO the Asinine Trump, Far Away From Us!”
They will try to assasinate President Trump.  You can book it.  The people we are fighting are evil Sociopaths who will do anything for power, greed, and $$.
Tiktok is getting the most attention regarding Trump's executive order, but I don’t think most folks understand the implications and magnitude of WeChat being banned as well.  This is devastating to Chinese communities living in America and their families in China.
Proves AzzO the Asinine Trump is delusional if not
It's just past 1am, unlike tRump I'm actually going to get ready and WORK!  Be safe and have a great day #resistors!
Thighland is the proper pronunciation that natives use. Your entire argument is completely broken and not founded in logic , But what would we expect from a Trump hater.Trump will go down in history as the greatest US president, notwithstanding George Washington. That’s Fact.
Economy is garbage because the countries governor shut down their states for a virus that has a lower mortality rate than the flu. Unemployment is low because the economy was shut down. This has nothing to do with Trump. Trumps actions led to the lowest unemployment in history.
I actually can't leave the country currently because of the way Trump is dealing with COVID :/
Trump 2020!! 🇺🇸 MAGA! 😁
This mans avarice is only exceeded by Trump.
So sick &amp;/or dead kids &amp; Teachers is okay by you &amp; your pappy AzzO the Asinine Trump Right  AzzO Jr?
GOP as long as you support AzzO the Asinine Trump you will a nonentity!
Right now it does! All the GOP has done for 4 years is stick their heads up AzzO the Asinine Trump’s derrière or drink Hourly Disinfectant Martins or give yourselves Daily Disinfectant Enemas! So GOP FIX YOUR Party
Will Trump have students tested before each day at school? No, their lives and teachers’ lives aren’t important to him.
You really need to stop giving yourself those Daily Disinfectant Enemas! They exuberant delusions ignorance silliness and the ability to believe every damn lie that comes out the GOP &amp; AzzO the Asinine Trump’s derrière
Have you paid your child support or is AzzO the Asinine Trump going to pay it?
OMG you people really need to stop drinking those hourly Disinfectant Martinis! Those drinks exuberant delusions ignorance silliness and lying to oneself about AzzO the Asinine Trump!
As usual AzzO the Asinine Trump is so full of it! Give him an enema he would totally disappear!😏
So should AzzO the Asinine Trump!
TikTok, just attacked without probable cause by Trump for data mining, which even your browser does, is a popular advert site. Influencers give you the reach of a Superbowl commercial for the price of a pair of sneakers. Advert and web design are the new economic skills to have..
I doubt it Leo but let’s ask AzzO the Asinine Trump about Epstein!
AzzO the Asinine Trump once again denying his part in destroying the USA 🇺🇸 Americans will always have the object of their true love GUNS but know this if their violence gets anyone I love killed then I will take away their guns houses businesses &amp; they will spend time in jail
Rudy Patootie is just proving that he still has his head stuck up AzzO the Asinine Trump’s derrière!
Because unlike AzzO the Asinine Trump &amp; you Mattie Gazbag the follow the rules of evidence! So please
Since when is the GOP interested in bipartisanship? Oh I know when they realized AzzO the Asinine Trump is in real trouble &amp; he is about ready to take their lazy silly delusional racist misogynistic ignorant heartless selves with him! So please
No doubt about it! It’s Trump vs. Radical, Extremist, Antifa-Socialism.
Mainstream media would blow up if Trump said anything slightly racist 2 days in a row.
If Trump said this America would break the internet
Trump is coool! From  a Vietnam vet!
Oh hell no! It’s just AzzO the Asinine Trump spewing false news out of his derrière!
Oh please Gzimo who are you kidding! Your say your Anti-Trump how? Well BYW by your silly &amp; ignornt statement you just proved you are Pro-Trump!
Free President Trump 2020!! No BS from Twitter!
They will grab their pacifiers &amp; hide! Secretly many of AzzO the Asinine Trump’s Supporters know if they start a Civil War we will end it! It won’t be pretty either!
Trump 2020!! 😁🙏🏻🇺🇸
President Trump is 3 steps ahead of the (Obama/Biden/Clinton) criminal cabal.   It is destiny for him (and ultimately us) to take down the Deep-State thieves, pedos, and traffickers once and for all.  This will end up being the greatest story in American history.
‘We The People’ are with President Trump!! 😁🇺🇸
Roy Cooper is a Deep-Stater to the core.  He is carrying out his orders as a DNC anti-Trump puppet.
Yates is another Swamp 🐀.   Keep exposing &amp; draining these crooks President Trump!! 👊🏻🇺🇸
Facebook is just another Deep-State DNC controlled media propaganda outlet.  They are all-things anti-Trump.  Pathetic.
I in no way support Trump. But I do have concerns. AI and automation in the manufacturing and service industries is the future. When machines are producing and selling, and drones driving and delivering everything from groceries to garbage, what do displaced workers do?
Biden should agree only when trump releases his taxes.
This is what I was talking about.  It’s a ploy to help trump win.  Kanye doesn’t have a chance, but a split vote could leave trump with a chance of winning a second term.
Trump is so worried he’s losing that he is backing Kanye to steal votes to ensure he can win.  Don’t be stupid and allow him to do this.  #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica
The press corp should refuse to cover it. Tell the Trump to provide his own camera crew to provide a live feed. Let Fox and Oann carry it while all others just report on it.
President Barack Obama changed the world and gave people Hope, Trump robbed America of it's dignity and supercharged hatred, Vice president Joe Biden will build it back better!
President Barack Obama changed the world and gave people Hope, Trump robbed America of it's dignity and supercharged hatred, Vice president Joe Biden will build it back better!
Eric Trump President in 2024
Is it true your lips can only be removed from AzzO the Asinine Trump’s derrière by surgery?
My Family Tree Goes All the Way Up! Or I married my sister according to the Laws of Nazis ⬜️🗑&amp; AzzO the Asinine Trump!
Trump is coool!
Why haven’t you RESIGN AzzO the Asinine Trump?
That’s because of the disaster you have been to this country AzzO the Asinine Trump! RESIGN
That's correct.  I didn't create this act till persuade anyone.   I connect and follow those who have the clarity to #resist tRump on their own.
Yeah, “Yo-semite” is ridiculous, but don’t let it distract you from the fact that the Trump administration is a multinational cartel death cult.
Same for me, but give Trump time.
Oprah = a Deep-State puppet doing as she’s told.  Her owners told her to hate President Trump and anyone who supports him.  Pathetic!
I truly think when so called Christians like you (when you really are the CINO-Christian In Name Only) condemns like my family &amp; I for voting for Joe Biden instead of that racist misogynistic silly liar AzzO the Asinine Trump then it’s y’all that have sold your soul to the Devil
No doubt about it!! It’s Trump (and us).....vs. the radical, extremist, DNC/Antifa/BLM mob.
The Deep-State is very deep &amp; very wide.  Their main goal is to destroy the man who exposed their crimes, pedos, and trafficking.  They are after President Trump, our children, and all of us.
Maybe Trump will finally unseal the criminal Hussein Obama’s records.  We don’t even know who this fraud is.
Kinda like you meddle when anything but Texas is at issue? Trump could meddle in your election and talk about UFOs, Jerry Falwell’s girlfriend, and what it was like to grow up wealthy. Just ask him.
Without Florida, Trump needs to win WI, MI, OH, PA, NC, and AZ. He won these states in 2016 but is currently behind in all 6  With Florida, he could lose 2 of those 6 states and still have enough EVs to win
my favorite genre of lib tweet is “trump is just GAGGing in Putin’s cock xd!!” and “Sean hannity is trump’s favorite bottom haha” because get it ? being queer is still a bad hehe funny dehumanizing bludgeon for us to use, but it’s ok b/c gay ppl now nominally have rights
People are not happy with you AzzO the Asinine Trump &amp; your followers &amp; your enabler the GOP!
Trump hasn't lead in a single Florida poll since early March
I thought you said Vote by Mail is riddled with fraud! OMG AzzO the Asinine Trump!
This is horrible, prays and thoughts to Beirut.  We also apologize in advance for our nitwit tRump before he says or tweets something insensitive or stupid or both.
It's  childish and immature.  If tRump ever took the high road it would be an escalator with hand rails and a seat belt.
Your Independence you’re you kidding you have had your head stuck up Azz0 the Asinine Trump’s derrière from the get-go so
I can imagine this is how tRump explained his school grades with his dad.
You guys are in a major shutdown, plus the 🔥 you guys have had. It was heartbreaking to see all the animals that were killed. The USA is having a major widespread breakout, but none of our states are shut down. Trump is a disgrace to our country. Worst President, EVER!!!
Don’t count Trump Resigning either! Ignoramus!
What I call all Trump Supporters Turkey Buzzard Orcs &amp; She Orcs!
Of course Trump is a criminal, he's in the US government. The illuminati always picks criminals to lead the U.S.
I agree.  Let’s Scrap the Presidential Debates
If a vacancy occurred, it would all depend on how bad the polls look for repug senatorial candidates, or between Nov. and Jan., would depend on how many Repugs have lost their seats. They will turn on Trump if their seats are threatened. Vote early and vote Blue!
White women voted for Trump over Hillary in the past election...so... whats your point, there's a lot of wpp in this country and a lot of them make bad choices...
Nancy Reagan looks at Ronald the way Mike Pence looks at tRump - how did America make such a wrong turn?
Reporters not allowed at the Renomintation of tRump due to Covid but schools are being required to open- uh yeah sure, ok, whatever!  Hope  will have some folks there.
Hundreds of thousands of children live with a single parent or grandparent. When the kids infect and kill their caregiver, will trump just send the kids to the cages?
Stone is a convicted felon and a traitor. Why is anyone giving him a voice?  Trump has never had any intention of debating.
He's not running a business jackass, this is a country and trump has never made a successful business deal in his life, golf course isn't changing that
Voting for Trump will definitely take us further away from Medicare for all....
Sounds like he rockin with that Unbreakable army...and word on the street is...Them Niggas is like on some Brody Trump shit🤷🏽‍♂️🤔
At what GermanyTrump? Giving himself those Daily Disinfectant Enemas! On that I will agree! That’s because Obama &amp; all of know that they exuberant delusions ignorance silliness racism illiteracy heartless &amp; lying! That’s why you need to stop too Germany Trump!
OMG Eric Obama isn’t running against your pappy AzzO the Asinine Trump JOE BIDEN IS! And it’s your pappy that’s facing a so called bloodbath
Trump is coool! I have his sticker on my pick up window, right beside my US flag, Vietnam Veteran and Back the Blue sticker!
No dump trump
Did I not just say I defend neither trump nor Clinton. Did I not just say that
I think he tweeted about he will never forgive Trump if he banned Tik Tok.
God bless you, Trump!
The Repugs never give up. They have accused both Clintons of every crime imaginable for decades. Funny how not a single charge has ever been brought against either. Not during 8 yrs of Bush nor nearly 4 yrs of Trump. Never an ounce of proof. Just endless accusations.
Opinion: So, Trump is not really about law and order: Trump didn’t like rulings on DACA. So he’s defying them.
AzzO the Asinine Trump you have already managed to have jobs disappear! So please
Don’t believe you AzzO the Asinine Trump! Running scared aren’t you! Resign &amp; spare US 🇺🇸 this fake spewing!
Largest FL Police Union Votes Unanimously To Endorse Trump: Tired of Being a Punching Bag for the Left

USA survive another 4 years of AzzO the Asinine Trump
Granted, Trump banning tiktok because he got his feelings hurt by some teens is an over-statement. There are other issues at play. But the threat Tiktok poses to national security is also over-stated. There are other issues a play there as well.
It’s amazing that the same elected officials who  -didn’t understand how Facebook makes money -think Zuckerberg runs Twitter -have to have Twitch explained to them by  (and still don’t get it)  are internet security and social media experts now that Trump wants to ban Tiktok.
Russians manipulate social media with fake accounts and bot army to influence U.S. elections.  Trump: *Does nothing*  Teens make fun of Trump on Tiktok.  Trump:
One of President Trump’s greatest legacies will be all of the corruption, criminality, and evil that he bravely exposed within our very own government.   #DarkToLight #WWG1WGA
Amen!  Now do the same for the entire trump klan!
If you voted for Trump, I hope you eat a dick and choke on it
So you’re telling me that first trump got rid of flavored Juul pods and now he’s banning tik tok. Fuck my coping mechanisms I guess??????
Like so many others, Dr. Birx sold her soul to Trump.
The product team behind Instagram Reels hearing about Trump banning Tiktok right now... #TiktokBan
If we do care about our elderly like my 94 year old Daddy then you guys in the GOP &amp; AzzO the Asinine Trump will be HISTORY in November!
Really how? AzzO the Asinine Trump can’t obey a simple verdict from the Supreme Court! Please GOP give up the lies &amp; Azz0 the Asinine Trump Y’all look less delusional less racist less ignorant less silly! Promise!
Obama is not far left. He's moderately left. The same principle goes for both Bushes. They weren't that far right, but were moderately right. Trump's position depends on his tweets which can change hourly as can his views.
The F.B.I has known about this since 2011? Trump is taking the heat from far lefts, but why didn't this come to light during the Obama Admin.... if they knew about it?🤔
Actually, no.  I do believe all Trump Supporters are racist.
That seems to be a popular idea with a lot of MAGAs. Source is always someone’s cousin’s girlfriend who works at a hospital. Same idiots who believed Trump’s claim of hospital workers stealing and selling PPE supplies.
None of the above. Clear winner is still Trump.
Rumor has it that Giuliani is in preparations to hire him for the Trump campaign.
Fear of Losing His A$$ in Large Numbers! This is why AzzO the Asinine Trump is so against mail in ballots even though he has used them himself!
#EpsteinFiles the ppl in the US government are corrupt, Clinton, Trump among others.
Blame Dr. Fauci. Trump didn’t kill anyone.  Or hell go after China. That’s where it originated from. Also look at the deaths between democratic and republican states. That’s shocking! Their also saying even if you die in a motorcycle accident with Covid it’s still a Covid death.
I did pretty good the first few months. But the isolation and loneliness are hitting hard now and will be even worse soon. Unlike Trump, everyone around us can’t get tested everyday.  I don’t know how people who support him can live with themselves.
You sure are going to disappointed! Trump will win by a bigger margin than 2016! People are sick of all this crap in America, tired, mad, and we can’t wait to vote!
Betting trump won’t be delivering a eulogy for Herman Cain.
Would be nice to see you and trump actually do a day of real work. Yelling, smirking and tweeting don’t qualify.
I usually hate the disclaimer, but I kind of feel like Trump needs to put "Tweets are my own and don't represent the views of my employer." in his Twitter bio.
How can you not care about the lives of adults - no matter their politics or ethnicity or age - and be pro-life? You can’t. I can’t. Trump can’t. Period.
What has Nasty Pelosi and the dimcrats done for their millions, other than give Trump a hard time!
What has Nasty Pelosi done to her millions other than give Trump a hard time?
But we will be able to listen to Trump brag about what a great job he's doing this afternoon during his MAGA ral... I mean press conference.
Loved hearing the mourners at John Lewis’ funeral singing We Shall Overcome. It’s  an incredibly long battle, but our Black brothers &amp; sisters shall indeed do so. And so shall we all not only survive the Trump presidency but overcome it.
And he wouldn’t have snubbed a dead hero’s Capital viewing. Trump has now dishonored McCain, Lewis, family of Gold Star parents of Muslim U.S. soldier, and more but not of Putin, of course.
I called   &amp;  today to find out their stance on Trump's call to delay the election. None gave me an answer. This shouldn't take ANY consideration. Speak out against this shameful attempt to subvert democracy NOW!
RIGHT like im not gonna buy from b&amp;bw bc they fired that one manager for saying fuck trump or whatever, but warm vanilla sugar has a special place in my heart forever
yes I am sure if Herman Cain could come back to life he would say “that Trump rally was sure worth dying a painful death and possibly spreading it to other members of my family!”
Former presidential hopeful Herman Cain is dead after getting the coronavirus after going to Trump’s Tulsa rally. May Cain RIP. May the rest of us keep trying to survive this presidency.
AzzO the Asinine Trump is running scared! I hear you want to postpone the election! Hey maybe that’s the reason you let COVID go on &amp; on!
I told  last weekend I bet trump starts trying to get the election delayed. He thinks he’ll lose and can use absentee balloting as an excuse
Trump dis'ing his base
The left can’t do anything but complain.  They have not come up with any ideas.  All they can do is show their Trump hatred.  It gets old and boring to say the least.
Wonder if there will be six seconds of memorials for trump when he goes. That would be six too many.
Arkansas is Trump country
I hope our former presidents remember John Lewis stood on principle and refused to attend Trump’s inauguration.  They should follow his example by refusing to attend Trump’s funeral when the time comes. Just let Pence give him a “strong and decisive “ descent below.
Someone should also point that out to Trump.Tah dah! Trump gets it done again! 👍🇺🇸😊
Yes, I approve of President Trump's job performance for the past 3 1/2 years.  I do not approve of Congress' job performance for the past 3 1/2 years.
Everyone with insurance is under Obamacare. The ACA is legislation, not insurance. All insurance covers pre-existing conditions already because it is required by the legislation called the ACA, or Obamacare. The pre-existing condition requirement is trying to be removed by Trump.
TRUMP 2020🇺🇸🇺🇸
Most providers didn’t leave the ACA. The ACA is legislation, not an opt-in program. The ACA declares that insurance companies already have to cover pre-existing conditions, which is what Trump is trying to remove. It’s a meaningless EO.

YES TRUMP
Dementia Joe. Trump is the one who destroyed it.
It’s OK. The majority of people who voted in the 2016 elections knew that Trump was a colossal fuckup who would destroy the country. Our only surprise was that it took him 3 years to do it.
We intelligent people love how Trump’s colossal failures over three years into his term are blamed on Obama by his cultists. And that’s after Trump spent three years constantly trying to convince America that things were so perfect. 😂😂😂

President Trump to ban dealings with Chinese owners of TikTok, WeChat
agree that it is a bad move, but trump already stopped MAGA
LMAO, Obama did replenish the stockpile. He dealt with three pandemics. Trump was in office over 3 years and did nothing. The “stockpile” being gone is 100% on Trump after 3 years. He ignored the pandemic protocol.
Dow TRIPLED UNDER OBAMA. 200% increase! It hasn’t even gone up 50% under Trump and it set records for the 10 biggest plummets in stock market history all because of Trump. Poison.
Meanwhile, not only is it stagnant under Trump, it’s actually DOWN 2000+ points from its high. Trump is just poison. That’s why he has so many bankruptcies.
As I said, it was the same trajectory it has been on for 10 years. Trump did nothing but crash it. As I pointed out, it went up 4000 points in 2016 after it had already been hitting record highs. In fact, it hit record highs almost every day Obama’s last two years.
Sorry facts don’t help you. Trump destroyed the great economy he inherited from Obama and Biden.
Iris running rampant in red states. All Trump. Herman Cain is dead thanks to Trump. Americans dying in record numbers...Trump’s response is “it is what it is.” I guess the politicizing by Trump to try to blame it on blue state governors didn’t work out so well, huh? 😉
LOL, GDP DOWN a record 33% under Trump. Unemployment back to double digits under Trump. Obama did better in his sleep. Even the stock market did better. Trump tried to take credit for Obama’s work and it bit him in his fat orange ass the first crisis he faced. 😂
LMAO, the Dow went up almost 4000 points (over 25%) Obama’s last year in office. You don’t know what the hell you are talking about. Unemployment and minority unemployment only went down a total of 1% under Trump until he screwed it up and sent it double digits.
Commission rejects President Trump's push to add debate against Biden
I love when people’s excuse for bad polls is ‘they’re just embarrassed to admit they’re voting for Trump’.   What?
Guess u haven't read the GOP Bill. The Senate is the chamber that did nothing. As usual. 2 months and nothing from Trump or the GOP. If that is your idea of leadership than u are part of the problem not the solution.
TRUMP PENCE 😃 😃 PROLIFE STOP ABORTION-KILLING NOW
Scamming people is literally objective one of the Trump organization so what's your point
The Bill has been on the desk of #MoscowMitch for ~10 weeks. The lack of leadership shown by Trump and the GOP is apparent.He has even said he can't get agreement from his own GOP caucus and will need Dem support. I know facts make your head hurt but "it is what it is".
Go Trump! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Middle Age Trump girl 🙋🏻‍♀️
Isn’t it amazing he can still demean and demoralize blacks and they still give him a pass, Trump has done more for blacks than any other president besides JFK, and the left hates him, I thought the left was for blacks,

Negative... and we all know it.  Why not do what’s right for the country... get over the hatred for Trump... end the race issues... and vote for the betterment of our Great America... not to bring it down and turn her into a 3rd world country.
Twitter, I see you're deleting people I've chosen to follow and people who've chosen to follow me.  I'm NOT deleting or unfollowing anyone and I seriously doubt anyone is deleting or unfollowing me.  I SUPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP &amp; WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. This CENSORSHIP must stop.
Americans have seen u sit on your hands for ~10 weeks and do nothing. U obviously have no solutions and Trump and your GOP cannot lead, so lets have Speaker Pelosi move forward with the leadership your caucus lacks. Just get the hell out of the way.
Trump
Despite the fact that Trump is an idiot... this solidifies my point that Thune has done NOTHING in the senate or house.  Trump doesn’t even know who he is when he’s been standing right behind #MoscowMitch for years.  #2 gop senator my a$$...
The governors of the red states? 😂  It was all on Trump. The “blame the governors of the blue states” ploy was a failed political strategy that killed a lot of Americans.
We had a much bigger boom than Trump under Obama. The Dow tripled. Unemployment dropped over 5%. We had much higher job creation. Trump never matched Obama’s GDP even before Covid-19.
God is President Trump’s backbone‼️ &amp; these Great United States needs to keep praying that God continues to guide him &amp; give him continuous strength🙏🙏🙏🙌🏻

Suburban housewives = whites  Low income housing = blacks  Trump is pretty blatant.
She blocked me. She supports racist losers. Trump. The Confederacy.
I been thinking about it though...did he inherit Bush’s war like Trump inherited the good economic momentum Obama created? Trump done burnt it up but...he had residuals. Anyway, back to Obama It’s a thought.
How do u continue to absolve the President over this shit show? Are u sure you are American? NY is only a fraction of the problem and u are blind to the lack of leadership shown by Trump and the GOP on the national &amp; international stage. Must suck being U.
Why are they wasting any resources in Ark. He will pull as many crazies from Trump as Biden. Is Trumps internal polling showing Ark. is getting tight? Makes no sense.
Facebook, citing virus misinformation, deletes President Trump post
U said it like it happened. Go Trump
I get it, but do you want Pence to be in a position to pardon Trump? I don’t.
How many easier examples do we need?  Sued by the government for racism (he paid).  Took out an ad against the exonerated blacks in the Central Park Five.  His own lawyer testified under oath.   His own former black outreach ambassador Omarosa Manigault:
Serious question: Once Trump leaves office what would it take - who can bring charges - for him to be charged with crimes against humanity? I would love to see him tried before an international tribunal.
Trump is making me sick
If the case was weak, then Trump wouldn’t have paid. The DoJ was satisfied getting Trump to pay for his racism, which is exactly what they did.
Trump said that if he is innocent, he doesn’t settle. LOL
The fact that the Justice Department sued them AND the Trump’s paid a settlement makes it crystal clear that they were racist. Add to that the testimony under oath of Trump’s own attorney of his racism, it’s pretty cut and dry.
Another Trump victory!
Not convicted? They were sued. There’s not a conviction to occur. But Trump settled because he was guilty. Just like he did with Trump University.
Fred and Donald Trump literally got sued by the government for racism. Other than hate crimes, it doesn’t get much more racist than that.
BIG NEWS: President Trump is full of shit, will not be re-elected, and will be prosecuted for bank fraud and tax evasion.
The sad thing for me is that we had a chance to turn over all the swamp tables. But trump simply wouldn’t lead the republicans in Congress to do anything
Trump is promises made promises kept but democrats are seeing he has done that and are making sure he can’t come thru with more,democrats make promises and never keep them, he is making them look like what they are liars and cheaters,they promise you the moon but give food stamps
I’ve definitely had that problem before… But it was with Trump’s tweets😳😡😡
Even before Covid-19 Trump couldn’t match Obama’s growth. And he wasn’t smart or good enough to maintain the economy through the pandemic, while Obama was able to maintain economic growth through 3 pandemics.
Trump was accused BY A 13 YEAR OLD VICTIM of Epstein of rape.
Joe... President Trump is going to chew you up. Go back and watch the debates of 2016 of him and Killary.  This is what ALL Americans will be like, debate time.  I can not wait!
Trump bragged about gawking at the semi-naked teenagers on the Howard Stern Show. That was public knowledge.
I mean, he just wished Ghislaine Maxwell “well” just a couple weeks ago on national TV. So that’s true.
It has been leaked. It’s public knowledge. The Trump cult just ignores it. The majority of the country that actually follows news have known about it for a long time.
Well, Obama did take unemployment from 10% down to 4.6% and tripled the stock market and got 20 million more people health insurance. Meanwhile Trump, who you think somehow is qualified to do anything, has unemployment back up to double digits and hasn’t even hit 50% Dow growth.
Isn't that what we do with the Senate? You had 10 weeks to work out these details and all u did was ignore them. You don't give a fuck about the people. This shitshow is on you,Trump and the GOP. Speaker Pelosi has done her job.
None are edited. Trump was using Mar-a-Lago as a sex trafficking hub for both Epstein (who was living there) and himself, when he was trafficking underage illegals for his “modeling agency.”
LOL, those are brilliant compared to slurring Yo-Semite Trump. Trump is legit having strokes, which is why he’s having to take trips to Walter Reed and getting coumadin.
As long as William Barr leads the DOJ, a sitting president is above the law and can not be charged with any crimes.   We need to remove Barr, then impeach Trump for tax evasion and fraud.   It’s past time we Al Capone Trump! #AlCaponeTrump

You can think it’s not difficult as well. I don’t think it’s difficult, either. But I’m not one of the ones that they’ve tried to disenfranchise like the exact examples I’ve sent you. But hey, you believe the bullshit that Trump tells you so why would I expect anything else?
Meddling????? But he’s completely fine with Russia, Saudis, etc helping Trump. Republicans have lost all sense of duty.
Yet when Trump set up his voter fraud commission in 2017 to investigate voter fraud because he lost the popular vote by a wide margin, they had to disband because they found nothing. Ironically, the Dems introduced an election security legislation which the GOP blocked. 🤷‍♂️
Weird, for some reason suddenly Trump doesn’t think it’s a problem in Florida...🤷‍♂️😂

I'm not seeing what you're seeing. It wasn't that great. He allowed Trump to ramble on and didn't press him on so many things. Plus, not a lot of fact checking. Chris Wallace did much better.

Kamala Harris may did a wrong thing by accepting Joe Biden's nomination for Vice President. It may do more damage to her name than good and causing her the chance of becoming a USA President.
I was looking at the exchange rate with China in previous years and it was treasonous. So wrong, how can USA pay so much and China were pennies. Did Biden know about that and didn't do anything about the exchange rate? Can we trust him?
God picked Trump, who loves America.Trump didn't outsource jobs, but brought them back. Joe Biden plans to give millions of jobs away; Americans will lose jobs &amp; won't be able to pay mortgages &amp; lose our homes. Just like during Obama/Biden time. Do you want the repeat of that?

I do but right now we have big trouble inside this country.  Current news,  Harris as VP.  First, speech praise for Biden then, shots at President Trump.  With the Dems, no matter whom, it’s the same old, same old, since 2016.  Put any other Dems in her spot today, same old song.
Fox News "Judge" Jeanine Pirro:  "Something is going to happen to Joe Biden". Man if anybody said that about Donald Trump, the FBI would be knocking on your front door.
Ok now we all know the most fun new thing to do is make up mispronunciations of Ms Camel-la la Harris. You do realize that the moment poor Mr Biden places his hand on the Quran to be POTUS, if he wins,he will be whisked to THE Home!

Kamala ran for Senator as an American Indian.    She ran for President as that poor little black girl.     When she and Biden lose, what will she be?........unemployed.
CNN hasnt mentioned K Harris calling Biden a racist (because he is). Nor has CNN mentioned that Bill Clintons name is all over the Maxwell docs. CNN hasnt denounced BLM as they are a terrorist organization. CNN makes up lots kf lies. CNN is a problem.
Good choice. He was going to carry CA anyway, but she will bring energy.  Had Biden chosen a WF, he would've been doing damage control 4 weeks. Harris makes it harder to use the crime in the streets BS as the narrative. She can punch w/o seeming mean, vital for a woman candidate.
however, the chances of him being elected are slim to none. In that event it is political suicide for her to associate herself with Joe Biden
Of course it could be a shrewd move on her part if she thinks that is the only way she is likely to become president.  If Biden does get elected it’s a foregone conclusion that she will become president
Politically I think that Kamala Harris should have refused to be the VP pick. I thought she was smart enough not to allow herself to be played as Biden’s patsy simply because she is female. Guess I over estimated her intelligence.

We will see what kind of ad Joe Biden &amp; KHarris will bring forth.  In fact I do believe Trump reelection is secure, however, let us see the political war step forward. We want to see who is willing to win.

Here's What You Need To Know About Joe Biden's Running Mate, Kamala Harris
Kamala and her stupid giggling is the best gift the Biden campaign could have given us.    Mucus gracias!  #TrumpPence2020
I do agree with you on this. My feelings are on my sleeve about this stuff as it is. Biden is extremely status quo. No shock. But he’s still my choice. For my sanity at the very least.
Oh, I'm certainly not a fan of the Biden camp at all either. CNN gave him millions of free advertising during the primary. CNN goes in hand with what the DNC wants about as much as FOX goes in hand with what the RNC wants.
I've been pretty sure that's where it was headed for a while, too. Felt pretty sure that Warren had no shot. If Biden wins and Harris leaves the Senate, she'll be replaced by another democrat (most likely a more moderate one... blech) in California. Risk is greater with Warren
All of the choices that Biden was seriously considering were black women. No matter who he chose (Warren and Whitmer were never going to be picked), this was going to be the story. I prefer Harris in that she actually has supported some legit left policies, unlike Biden
I don't think the VP sets policy, but I do feel that the likelihood that Biden is only a one term president means that his VP decision was more of a "future of the party" choice than anything else. She's the immediate 2024 front-runner
Flipped to CNN. As expected, it's nothing but "First African American woman.." "First woman of Asian descent.." It's so irritating that this is considered more important than policy at all. We're right back to the "Biden's more electable" crap. Talk about policies at some point
In May of this year Kamala Harris was asked if she would accept VP slot with Biden.      She replied, “Joe would make a good running mate for her since he knows a lot about being VP”.
Honest question: has anyone else had trouble giving money to Joe Biden? I cannot bring myself to do it.
Harris, a 55-year-old first-term senator, is also one of the party’s most prominent figures and quickly became a top contender for the No. 2 spot after her own White House campaign ended.

Maybe you shouldn’t have endorsed Biden in the first place. They fucked you over, convince me they won’t fuck the rest of the country
Biden didn't suggest anything. He'd have to be able to construct a thought, which we all know that he can't. Sooooo...NEXT! #4MOREYEARS #Trump2020Landslide
That would be Pedophile Joe. Your Alzheimer's patient! You can keep dreaming tho. He doesn't have to lie to you. Biden does a good job of that! 😆 NOV. WILL BE AN EPIC WIN!! #4MOREYEARS #Trump2020Landslide
Biden got corrupted after he sat as vice Predident under Obama.  There were many others like that, curropted under Obama.  That is one way of bringing America down by immoralizing it's leaders. Lot were corrupted. Heard of pizza gate &amp; child trafficking. Popular terms that time

That's gonna cramp the Biden's style. Sick is right!
Must be why Biden is ducking and dodging debates. He doesn't want to embarrass Trump.

I completely understand not voting for him and not liking him surely you can’t consciously vote for Biden and think that dude is fit to run the country
What's to debate? The American people want Trump out! Biden doesn't have to debate. All Trump wants is the circus he would turn a debate into. He would get up and walk around in disrespect of Biden. That's all it would be. The American people now know  the real Trump.

Vote Biden. Don’t repeat your mistake
You can say that again. My stepmom is vehemently anti-Trump and will be voting for Biden and Harris this November. What an asshole. I am so glad I know the truth about  and  and
Donald Trump isn’t good at making himself “voteable” but he is extremely good at making other people seem extremely “unvotable.” Donal Trump is gonna EAT Biden alive for his Kamala pick.
4) this nonsense, I’ll take and I did take Trump over party, he has looked out for our best interest from day one, he has always loved this country as I do, every democrat I know are dispicable liars just in it for themselves and republicans, VOTE TRUMP!!! Leave the biden trash
1)Why do you think democrats didn’t complain they wanted that knowing it would get worse before elections and hope they could blame Trump, the democrat ticket is a direct result of the corrupt party biden has no chance he admitted he is in it for one term, this all to try and
He's far from perfect. He's better than Biden and the Dems.
Of course I voted for Hillary, just like the majority of voters did. And I will vote for Biden, just like the majority of voters will. And no, unlike just an entry on a flight log, I use actual incriminating evidence (video, accusations from victims, quotes from participants).
Joe Biden pronounced it the same way....
I have loved learning from you and if you think Trump is awesome or just ok or needs to be replaced or if Biden is awesome or just ok or should have been Bernie... honestly I just want to get published. And if your work helps me do that, think/post what you want.

I can’t understand how the people who have listened to Ku Klux word salad for the last four years have the fucking audacity to call Biden senile
Journos just making it up as they go along.  Anything to try and stay in that "Biden for Pres" lane.  Goodness.  They have no shame.  Harris isn't a small "c" conservative, that's an absolutely laughable thing to write.  She's a "Big PL", progressive liberal.  What a joke.
Ah you finally caught him!  Now listen to Biden, he is running for US senate!  You missed that didn’t u?   Your guy can’t put two coherent sentences together and Trump runs the world!
I held my nose and voted for Hillary b/c I recognize a narcissistic personality when I see one  This year I'm enthusiastically voting for Joe Biden not only because my initial judgment of Donald Trump was right, but b/c Biden is the right man to heal our country.  #LincolnVoter
My Brit buddy just passed me again and still laughing saying Harris is that all you got, I told him I have Trump the democrats have her, still he said is that all biden and harris hahahaha
Let’s be honest no one even cares about that debate. Trump will be bathing in Biden’s blood by the time it’s all over and Dems will be looking for a replacement. ( which im sure they’re actively already doing )
Biden is currently more likely to win... but it's not guaranteed.
pardon me, FIRST what we’re not gonna do is not manage to elect Biden in 2020 like some of y’all did with Hillary in 2016 just because she doesn’t check every one of your seventy set dream socialist boxes
Joe Biden is Catholic... And crap like this is one of the reasons I no longer am....
Pro-Life vs. Pro-Abortion is a clear choice for America this November. Biden has officially made clear he will not be moderate in his selection of nominees, Harris is radical about abortion.  and Pence are unquestionably the most Pro-Life pick. #Vote
It just doesn't make sense (even if it was just meant as sick burn on Biden), since there wouldn't have been a Catholic on the ticket in 08 and 12 either. And 92, 96, and 00 were also RC-free zones. Bizarre.

Also, since this is blowing up, I have another message. If you can vote, VOTE TRUMP OUT OF OFFICE!!!! Biden's not perfect, but he's not a narcissistic, egomaniacal, authoritarian wannabe! Vote on November 3 to get him out of office!
If it was Joe Biden that said that it would be fine. But Orange man says it and oh boy is he stupid
I thought the issue was whether a politician's wife is responsible for his behavior. I don't believe Biden has dementia, and I believe he is more mentally competent than the man who thought COVID would peak at 15 cases and can't pronounce Yosemite. He doesn't need my protection.
Yes, people can learn from their mistakes. But people who seek public office should know that every mistake they’ve made will be scrutinized.  Biden is less liberal than Hillary yet he didn’t vote Clinton in ‘16. It opens a window into Dan’s unprincipled, conspiratorial thinking.
Projecting again. You were the laughing stock of the world. Now, the world grieves for the US. You have failed miserably. There is no way anyone else, including Biden, would be worse than you. A tree stump would have done better!
first hand experience shaken down by the Clinton’s (twice) my dads law firm was Nixon’s attorney in event he went to impeachment trial. They “fired” Nixon. Biden’s corruption has been documented extensively. Hope my niece never writes about me. She knows nothing about what I do.
I guess Biden for president. 😒 habiendo tanta persona inteligente, decente en este pais, &amp; we are stuck with those 2 options ni modo. But we can’t have 45 back in office. But once AOC can run, ya’ll better believe we are fundraising, donating, raising heck &amp; making her president
What about investigating Obama -Biden; Biden being one of the most corrupt in history - up there with Nixon and Clinton.
That Kamala is *ACTUALLY* Joe Biden's MOTHER!
So Barr will be some guy trump barely knows unless he prosecutes President Obama &amp; Biden? Do I have the right take on that?

I believe so. I don’t have the stats but from observation only I don’t believe there is a discrepancy in live media coverage between POTUS and VP Biden. Not sure where to find the numbers on that though.
Us normal people have no clue either and can’t wait for the election when we can put a decent man in office Joe Biden and KAMALA Harris for VP.
Biden is a career politician. She called him a racist during her run. Odd they a pair now. All I'm saying
Trump is terrified of Kamala Harris. Biden Harris equals defeat to him. They will be unstoppable! Trump, get ready for a jail cell buddy!
Funny you should call anyone treasonous when you’re the biggest traitor this country has ever seen!! And your the president for heavens sakes. But not for long. We have a new 1 coming.... he’ll make AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!  JOE BIDEN &amp; KAMALA HARRIS 2020!!!!
We sure will when we vote Biden &amp; Harris into office!!!
We ARE READY!!!!! BIDEN HARRIS READY

I’ll probably be on FB and Twitter jail for a while but I’m tired of all the BS! If you don’t like Trump don’t like him if you vote for Joe Biden your a fucking moron. That’s what I have to say. It’s my freedom speech to say that. I’m sick to death of all the political talk (1)
I'm PROUD to stand with YOU!!! BIDEN-HARRIS
Since Dan recently decided to free me from Whitfield Twitter Jail, I’ll answer for him!  He “claims” he’s voting for Biden. I find that rather strange since he voted Jill Stein in 2016.

Absolutely! Go BIDEN-HARRIS 2020!!!

Geez dude, you should probably take some good sleeping pills and dream. Cuz Biden has been in office for over 40 years, and he hasn't accomplished ANYTHING.

What comparison is there? I mean surely you have some fact that Biden has hurt kids like Jordan.
Joe Biden radical socialist? Wow. He’s a few inches from being a Reagan Republican.

How refreshing. Biden/Harris. Two candidates. Two speeches. Real sentences. Honest emotion. Not disjointed word salad.

You miss the point I don’t care about Democrat or Republican, Trump or Biden. The whole US Constitution needs to be thrown away. Neither man (all white) that was in that room when it was written represents or stand for anything for black people
“ She's ready to lead on day one.”  And Joe Biden, you are not “ready to lead” due to dementia. Also, it looks like your party wants to lead the USA to more riots, looting &amp; racial tension.  #Blexit #Lexit
It’s not an assumption. Biden has been explicit that race and sex are deciding factors in his selection of a running mate.
It's hard to make his campaign against Joe Biden about "Mental Competence" when he can't pronounce common words and his greatest academic achievement to date has been the cognitive exam involving animal shapes and memorization.
Biden, Harris to make unusual campaign debut in virus era
Here go some evidence y’all looking for. I still have to vote for Biden but just check the thread out.
Not voting for Biden is voting for trump but not voting for trump is voting for Biden.
Joe Biden could be running with Carole Baskins and I would still vote for his ass idc
Right? This asshatery is why I won't be returning to the Catholic church anytime soon. But Biden never left and shouldn't have his faith so maligned.
Look, it absolutely sucks that some people view this as being stuck with two evils AGAIN. We didn't need a repeat of 2016. But if you genuinely believe *not voting at all* is better than voting Biden/Harris, I do not understand. If youre willing to explain that reasoning, dm me.
Prior to the  and  administration we did not have riots destroying entire city blocks, racial divide, men in women's restrooms, a dishonest FBI, etc.  Just imagine how horrible it will be after a Joe Biden  presidency.
A person I’m very close to openly supported Trump in 2016 and is now actively and openly supporting Biden/Harris even though people are giving her flack for it. Voters like her are some of the ones that will help flip this election for #BidenHarris2020
Out of all the brilliant and extraordinary people in America, we are forced to vote for either Biden or Trump to lead us as a country 🥴 WACK
The correlation between Joe Biden finalizing his VP pick and   “conveniently” being in the state of Delaware at the same time had me convinced he was going with the 🐐 #Marvy4USA
Let me say this . It’s not about Biden, Trump, Democrat , Republican. It’s about this country the hatred , racism, division, etc everything is setup to divide individuals, races, whatever it may be so it’s not about political parties with me.
Yes, and I wouldn't be surprised if Biden has read it.   (Trump doesn't need to read a stinkin' book. Especially not one about Lincoln, whose accomplishments were “always questionable.” According to the  Finest.)
Straight linear logic: Kamala Harris said Joe Biden was a “segregationist” so Kamala Harris by accepting his offer to be his VP is now an “Aunt Chloe” (Uncle Tom’s wife)
I Can't Wait For November To Get Here!!!!! Team Biden/Harris
The most heart warming thing right now is seeing my mother so excited for Joe and Kamala. In 2016 she never talked politics. Hell, in 2018 she hardly talked politics. Now, she’s putting up a Biden/Harris yard sign, buying t-shirts, and trying to figure out how else she can help.

I’ve always suspected a celebrity candidacy like West’s would likely take more votes away from a celebrity candidate like Trump than for traditional politician like Biden.
Now her platform is Biden’s. It’s fine. Her presidential campaign wasn’t great; she’ll improve as a candidate. As someone NOT eligible for Medicare, private ins SUCKS - she wasn’t wrong.
Basically my attitude. Would have preferred a rematch w/ Hillary tbh..preferred Bernie over Biden, but wasn’t enthusiastic about either Dem candidate (!!!). My dream ticket would be M.Obama/Yates but we know that story..😔

The truth of this pick has been stated by other Conservatives:  Biden did not pick Ms. Harris; the DNC picked her and told Biden she was HIS? pick.  He simply nodded his head and that's it!  Also, BLM demanded a black female be picked for VP.  Nuff said?

Also, if you read what Nate Silver said, it is that they modeled it and it showed Biden with a 90% chance, and Nate didn’t think that was accurate, so he created an uncertainty index. So, it basically became, “the math said X, and I didn’t like that, so here’s my opinion.”
No, she isn’t radical left (and this is why Biden picked her).  The camp followers they will sweep into the bureaucracy, however, will be.  Biden will be the SEIU’s president, all the way.

We talk about the hypocrisy of party loyalty in the R. Party all the time. I’d never discourage anyone from voting, but we cannot just expect ppl to vote for whomever just bc they’re a dem. If Biden fails to rack in voters that’s  his campaigns fault. Not the fault of voters.

I’m not a fan of Harris and won’t vote for Biden or her, but listening to these racists judge someone by the color of their skin and not by the content of their character is disgusting. #WalkAway #MAGA2020
It’s gonna be SO friggin’ AWESOME!!!  FINALLY, SOMETHING for me to look forward to!   Just like when  first ran for Congress, shortly after I moved to Tucson, I can hardly wait to open my checkbook! Every payday, I vow to take a little off the top for Biden/Harris.
Up early. As always. Mood: Good. I’m feeling.......... RELIEVED. Y’all do know that I thought Biden was going to f*ck it all up, LOL!!! I really did!  I am convinced that once he rolls out his cabinet picks, we are going to see THE most AWESOME group of WOMEN and MEN... SMH...

President  is attacked as a “threat to freedom of the press!” but takes more questions in a week from the press than Joe Biden has his entire campaign

OBVIOUSLY, the media acts PARTNERS with BIDEN and Company to save their behinds!
THIS  is why YOU LIES!   Only Trump worked to stop the spread of the virus at the beginning.. BIDEN, Harris , Pelosi and Schumer Condemned the blocking of China ending infected folk to America and some dems even partied in the streets to get them to come here...IDIOTS!
Thanks you Carmen
Bahahaha!!!!!  I’ll bet you can’t remember what you had for breakfast this morning.    Let me tell you what I remember:  1. You’ve lied repeatedly about your accomplishments. 2. You once dropped out of potus race over plagiarism and lies.   3. Hunter “HoDaddy” Biden in Ukraine.
THIS is the voice of an IDIOT... That is the idiotic idea that the USA have to wait on the world as China  BUYS other nations and the Biden family. It took Trump to say NO MORE and no waiting for decades for the world to agree. You Go Mr. President, You knew the truth!
Not just you, because the United States postal union has endorsed Joe Biden for president #VoterFraud. Girl you need more education before you open your mouth.

I'm not saying Trump is perfect, but many read headlines and watch biased coverage that puts a negative spin on everything he does. Did they cover the FBI lawyer that just pleas guilty for falsifying information to start Russia probe? Joe Biden is the biggest Racist.
I just can't understand how one has put together, over 40 years, the most damaging legislation towards the Black and LGBTQ community is held in higher esteem than Trump? Biden voted for the Defensive marriage act and ran on preventing gay marriage in 2008.
Not moving goalposts. ACA and GND are proposed solutions. That is fine. Challenge you to promote Biden by advocating the strength of those positions rather than accusing POTUS of every unsubstantiated crime under the sun or being disrespectful to people who choose to support him.
Biden doing what he does best.
Biden already has  a head start with Camel... I think Joe accidentally dropped the mike himself... so many camel jokes already. I would have loved to have seen Trump’s face when Biden called her Camel!!!😂😂😂😂

You are really commenting on Biden’s intelligence and sharpness? You bragged about performing well on a dementia screening test. Think about why you might have been given that test. It’s not standard, I assure you. Keep talking. You get dumber every day.
I never once said I was, now did I? I was commenting on this to say basically I wouldn’t trust Biden to be the best canidate. He’s not all there, it’s very clear. I’m more concerned for his health, honestly.

If it was Joe Biden that said that it would be fine. But Orange man says it and oh boy is he stupid
I thought the issue was whether a politician's wife is responsible for his behavior. I don't believe Biden has dementia, and I believe he is more mentally competent than the man who thought COVID would peak at 15 cases and can't pronounce Yosemite. He doesn't need my protection.
Yes, people can learn from their mistakes. But people who seek public office should know that every mistake they’ve made will be scrutinized.  Biden is less liberal than Hillary yet he didn’t vote Clinton in ‘16. It opens a window into Dan’s unprincipled, conspiratorial thinking.
Projecting again. You were the laughing stock of the world. Now, the world grieves for the US. You have failed miserably. There is no way anyone else, including Biden, would be worse than you. A tree stump would have done better!

Yo someone saw me shitting on the Biden VP announcement and was like “don’t act like there’s any better option than Biden/Harris”....  I’m not.  And that right there is the Fucking problem. That right there is literally the best possible scenario
What comparison is there? I mean surely you have some fact that Biden has hurt kids like Jordan.
Joe Biden radical socialist? Wow. He’s a few inches from being a Reagan Republican.

Biden, Harris to make unusual campaign debut in virus era
Oh I’ll definitely go Biden, just found it funny
How refreshing. Biden/Harris. Two candidates. Two speeches. Real sentences. Honest emotion. Not disjointed word salad.
The difference: Joe Biden is a breath of fresh air. Donald Trump is a gasp of hot air.
We the people hear their cry for justice. We stand with you. Our President isn’t up to the job but soon President Biden will act on our behalf to help your country in your time of need.❤️☮️❤️☮️
Such a pleasure to listen to someone  that sounds presidential.  Im voting Biden/Harris.

You miss the point I don’t care about Democrat or Republican, Trump or Biden. The whole US Constitution needs to be thrown away. Neither man (all white) that was in that room when it was written represents or stand for anything for black people
“ She's ready to lead on day one.”  And Joe Biden, you are not “ready to lead” due to dementia. Also, it looks like your party wants to lead the USA to more riots, looting &amp; racial tension.  #Blexit #Lexit
It’s not an assumption. Biden has been explicit that race and sex are deciding factors in his selection of a running mate.
It's hard to make his campaign against Joe Biden about "Mental Competence" when he can't pronounce common words and his greatest academic achievement to date has been the cognitive exam involving animal shapes and memorization.
Biden, Harris to make unusual campaign debut in virus era
Here go some evidence y’all looking for. I still have to vote for Biden but just check the thread out.
Not voting for Biden is voting for trump but not voting for trump is voting for Biden.
Joe Biden could be running with Carole Baskins and I would still vote for his ass idc
Right? This asshatery is why I won't be returning to the Catholic church anytime soon. But Biden never left and shouldn't have his faith so maligned.
Look, it absolutely sucks that some people view this as being stuck with two evils AGAIN. We didn't need a repeat of 2016. But if you genuinely believe *not voting at all* is better than voting Biden/Harris, I do not understand. If youre willing to explain that reasoning, dm me.
Prior to the  and  administration we did not have riots destroying entire city blocks, racial divide, men in women's restrooms, a dishonest FBI, etc.  Just imagine how horrible it will be after a Joe Biden  presidency.
A person I’m very close to openly supported Trump in 2016 and is now actively and openly supporting Biden/Harris even though people are giving her flack for it. Voters like her are some of the ones that will help flip this election for #BidenHarris2020
Out of all the brilliant and extraordinary people in America, we are forced to vote for either Biden or Trump to lead us as a country 🥴 WACK
The correlation between Joe Biden finalizing his VP pick and   “conveniently” being in the state of Delaware at the same time had me convinced he was going with the 🐐 #Marvy4USA
Let me say this . It’s not about Biden, Trump, Democrat , Republican. It’s about this country the hatred , racism, division, etc everything is setup to divide individuals, races, whatever it may be so it’s not about political parties with me.
Yes, and I wouldn't be surprised if Biden has read it.   (Trump doesn't need to read a stinkin' book. Especially not one about Lincoln, whose accomplishments were “always questionable.” According to the  Finest.)
Straight linear logic: Kamala Harris said Joe Biden was a “segregationist” so Kamala Harris by accepting his offer to be his VP is now an “Aunt Chloe” (Uncle Tom’s wife)
I Can't Wait For November To Get Here!!!!! Team Biden/Harris
The most heart warming thing right now is seeing my mother so excited for Joe and Kamala. In 2016 she never talked politics. Hell, in 2018 she hardly talked politics. Now, she’s putting up a Biden/Harris yard sign, buying t-shirts, and trying to figure out how else she can help.

Basically my attitude. Would have preferred a rematch w/ Hillary tbh..preferred Bernie over Biden, but wasn’t enthusiastic about either Dem candidate (!!!). My dream ticket would be M.Obama/Yates but we know that story..😔

Also, if you read what Nate Silver said, it is that they modeled it and it showed Biden with a 90% chance, and Nate didn’t think that was accurate, so he created an uncertainty index. So, it basically became, “the math said X, and I didn’t like that, so here’s my opinion.”
No, she isn’t radical left (and this is why Biden picked her).  The camp followers they will sweep into the bureaucracy, however, will be.  Biden will be the SEIU’s president, all the way.

Why Joe Biden Picked Kamala Harris - The Atlantic
Laughable. I’m a 73 year old White woman. When I heard Kamala was Biden’s choice I felt tears of happiness streaming down my face.❤️💃☮️
The funny part about all of this is that nothing can top the carnival of stupidity we’ve had to endure these last few years. Anything they say about Biden to me sounds like “pot meet kettle” at this point. 👍👍
Joe Biden acting like he just really for black people......
Please end the nightmare! If anyone can do it, it will be Biden/Harris!
Yup agreed. My wife and I are privileged to know many black women as you described. We are voting for four of them in various statewide elections.  Definitely like the VP choice of Kamela Harris.  Joe Biden would be the first to say he had a great group of women to select from!
Could have done better. Nobody ever said the woman or any candidate is perfect but she is highly qualified and deserves a chance. Same I feel with Biden. If nothing else y’all need to be looking at what they are advocating for today
Have you kept up with anything she’s done recently? Everyone keep speaking on times when most thought the tough on crime thing was the way to go.. this was years ago same excuse y’all want to use on Biden. &amp; as AG of course there will be things she
Worse than that. Biden doesn't have the cognitive ability to do it even with a teleprompter and/or his wife by his side.

Well someone posted that Ben Shapiro thinks Kamala is going to try to kill Biden. So that must be the new thing.
I don’t know one person of color who would seriously vote for him. He’s trying to take the black from Biden apparently.
So... I think what the implication here is that Hillary killed Epstein and Kamala is going to kill Biden?
Question. Can trump really syccessfully use videos of riots on the streets that are happening under his watch and legitimatelly use that against Biden? I suppose it could work for getting his base out, but I just don't see how that could compel anyone on the fence.
Whyyyyy is everyone falling all over themselves to acknowledge that a Biden/Harris ticket is “imperfect.” Tired of lame people hedging their bets to look omniscient. No one is perfect, but Biden/Harris is perfect. Get on fucking board.

Trump 'surprised' Biden picked Kamala Harris as running mate
I don’t think it’s needed, anywhere. Just thought it was funny. With Biden’s VP pick you guys ready to double down on your bets?
FWIW, it strikes me as possible that both could occur simultaneously.  A Biden administration will have the worst kind of far left loonies (he's basically signed up for the Green New Deal, and forget Betsy DeVos' Title IX changes) while indulging Harris' carceral impulses.
OK. So here’s my question. When Biden and Harris win, what happens to Harris‘s seat in the Senate? I know it depends on what state we are talking about so what happens in California?
He is a real price and she and Biden are gonna beat his orange ads all over the place!
I hope you are right... She brings almost as much baggage with her as Joe Biden.
If I was Biden I would’ve picked a mother to portray a pro family view during pandemic. He picked a childless woman.
I really don't want to see #TrumpIsNotWell debate VP Biden.  Trump couldn't tell the truth if he had to. Difficult to debate such a person without truth-checking throughout the whole debate!
the best part about biden and harris is that once they win this election, biden’s senile self will eventually HAVE to give up the pr*sidency to the vp........and we’ll have the first black female president 🤫 but i didnt tell yall that!
Can you imagine Biden getting the debated “3 am phone call” that was all the fuss when Hillary was running ?

Why do ppl have to defend voting for Biden when people are talking about how ridiculous the Democratic Party is? U can vote against Trump &amp; still talk about how fucking stupid the Democratic party is right now. Stop acting like ur part of a cult that u cant critically evaluate.
Name-calling, insults and the racist birther lie allowed Trump to rise like cream in the party that admires and rewards that kind of thing. But I rather doubt using his go-to insult for strong women on Harris is going to cost Biden any votes.
The scars of racial tension are deeeeper than republican//democrat and a lot of whites don’t understand that. Some are just feeling guilty about the overt racism we’ve seen in this recent era. The shit ain’t just come from nowhere tho and it won’t magically go away under Biden
No problem..I didn't vote for him the first time around. I can't vote for Biden. I like a lot of the things Trump has done...ALOT.... Since this is an equality thread and not a " Who you support for President" thread...I'm open for dialogue.

Quick read: Kamala Harris is a safe choice. Nobody who was really going to vote for Biden won't now. But she also won't flip any new blocs. It's a good veep pick for a candidate who believes he's already winning.
Is Kamala Harris who I wanted? Fuck no. She was the last on my list of potentials. But as expected, Biden picked her and it is what it is. I'm riding. #BidenHarris2020 #Democrats
My take is that it seemed that the obvious choice for Biden. No matter who gets elected, we advocate and agitate for our causes and hold power to account.

At this point, Joe Biden could get up on the stage at the convention and directly call me a prick and I’d still crawl thru broken glass covered in COVID on November 3 to vote for him. It’s just that important to change our country’s direction.
We all know the Dems project their intentions and beliefs on others.  In recent days both Biden and Hillary have projected the Dems desire to raid social security. This is clearly a talking point of the radical left and they should be challenged on it.
I can VOTE for that but I ain’t spendin’ on that. I’m not donating to any Biden/Pete sh*t or Biden/any old white milk, random, vaguely familiar D.C. insider career politician dude or even a Biden/Warren ticket.  I can’t donate MY hard earn money to that sh*t.
I may have to start donating to Biden’s campaign but I have to know who his VP pick is going to be, first.  My senate contributions are still in place, but, I want to get in on the POTUS race but don’t want to support some hack a$s establishment “beat Trump” ploy “just because.”

That BETTER be what’s going on, here, but like I’ve said 👏🏾 MA 👏🏾 NY 👏🏾 TIMES, I don’t put it past Joe Biden to f-ck up the pick and screw the pooch for a slam dunk 2020 landslide.
You are the problem Mr Biden by trying to incite people over this incident in which the officers have been cleared.  Why  do you continue to divide our people over race by continuing to blame law enforcement over this? I can only imagine what you might do if elected. God help us
Every accusation is an admission. Biden could ride his bike back in, he could squat &amp; dodge &amp; get back up again. He could run up &amp; down a ramp. #GOJOEBIDEN
Dude.  What if Biden forgets to tell the fellow to mail in his paperwork and he doesn't get put on ballot.   😂😂😂
One of the Trump klan will be on Fox tomorrow talking about Biden’s misspeaking and being confused. Yo-Semite!!
Biden thinks he is running against Biden...I actually feel sorry for him,  but no mercy vote for Biden in this family , Trump 2020!!!
Salty? Kamala Harris Has Unfollowed Joe Biden on Twitter as VP Announcement Expected Soon  via
I don’t if I said this today but Fuck Trump and Biden. 🤷🏾‍♂️
If Biden gets in, first thing that needs to be done is eliminate the "acting" position bullshit.  If someone quits or gets fired, a nonpartisan career employee needs to be in charge until CONGRESS approves a replacement.  This acting crap to get your cronies in has to be stopped.
Of course. They already bought the Biden’s and they want their monies worth.
Ok. Can we please have St. Pete come down for one hour. Just an hour and tell ya who passes the God test. Trump or Biden. Just an hour of your time , please?
There are a lot of good choices in talks for VP, and I’d be happy with most of them, but this really isn’t at all surprising for Warren or her base. She gets the job done.  Warren Has Raised the Most Money for Joe Biden Out of All VP Contenders
Conservatives aren’t going to win the election by running against things Joe Biden said 20,30 and 40 years ago. They’re running against Joe in 2020 not 1980.
I am Joe Biden and where’s my pants.
I have seen Jill Biden many times but heard her interviewed yesterday and she is very interesting. I was thinking she should run for VP! What a smart person with a lot of determination and compassion. I think she would make a great first lady. She has plenty of experience.
Minn. group that saw $$ surge, some from Biden staffers, bailed out alleged violent criminals: report  #FoxNews
We ain’t in China, Nancy. I wish Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi would move to China. Ridiculousness.
I would vote for Biden if he picked someone out of a lineup at the county jail. That being said. I really hope he picks  That being said I’m really excited about the list in general. That being said whoever is in charge can you message me. Need the date for my pool.
So Biden needs a black female VP running mate according to black leaders, OK, how bout Maxine Waters?
I know I'm going to catch three kinds of hell for this..................  " No, Mr. Biden! I don't want a hug!"
Biden/Obama did worse. If I told you one infected 60 million and one had 5 million infected, not discussing the deaths because over 74% happened in Democrat ran States, you would go with the 5 million. We are just fortunate that the same death rate wasn't falsely reported.
Honestly, I don't think Biden will serve 40 days...
me waiting in line to vote for joe biden in november
I will vote for Biden regardless of who he picks. I just hope it's not Kamala Harris. I'm not feeling her. I think Val Demings, Stacy Abrams, or Elizabeth Warren are far better. JMHO
We had 60 million infected by H1N1... just think if Governors like Cuomo sent them into nursing homes as well. We have 5 million infected and Obama/Biden had 60 million. I guess we are fortunate that not every death was blamed on H1N1 or it would have been worse... Thanks MSM.He is pro life and pro Israel and pro America First, Biden is not.
What a 💩 Biden is
Suck it up buttercup and vote for Biden.
And for half of those years Old Joe has wanted to Cut Social Security...
To hell with Biden, and Willy's hooker too...
He did not!! If things were great during their 8 years, why did Obama &amp; Biden blame Busch for everything their entire 8 years? You are as delusional as Biden.
Biden got something wrong? 🙀
And as a Patriot I will not vote for Biden / Harris for the benefit of this country
Seriously expect us to believe this? Should post the data of your poll with demographics and age ranges..I can write and post a poll showing anything without any data to reference...your poll is 💩💩
⁦ and ⁦ you call this leadership? I call it a failure to provide specifics to your mandate let alone not allowing questions...a leader is prepared to explain the 5 W’s!..this is staged political theatrics! Pathetic!
⁦ oh hell no will you mandate I wear a mask all the time!..you will never control my life or my choices..you hear me! Dumb ass fool
Neither do I. I’m not even talking about news though in my OP. It’s what people are posting and commenting in my FB feed. And there is a lot of it. My point was that while Harris/Biden’s records are not perfect, Trump supporters seem to look past his shady record.
Nate, curious about your thoughts on the Helmut Norpoth primary model and methodology. Seeing their prediction (91% trump, 9% Biden) shared quite a bit among conservative circles.
$5 he's in the Biden administration now. UN ambassador or something
Hey where is the social distancing...so she wore a mask yesterday walking side by side with Biden but now no mask and no social distancing. What bullshit  displays..just a power grab and says and does what it takes to move ahead..
No kidding!..I mean who the hell are they polling to show Biden is leading...absolute bs and lies!...just another way MSM is trying to persuade and disavow the public. You cannot tell me this is how mainstream America is voting let alone thinking.
What was that?
“Crowd” for Biden speech is equal to “Parking Lot Attendants” at Trump rallies.
You just described Biden! 😂 Trump2020
Please keep your promise to spend a billion to help elect Biden/Harris. Don't make us send Elizabeth to get it
all this pre-emptive scolding when Biden is going to capture middle aged white voters anyway
That koolaid you are drinking has gotten to you..the only nightmare has been Biden for 40 years in Federal government
Sure, wouldn't want to subject feeble minded Biden to any debate now would we? Might just show America how degraded the mental state of the Democrats candidate is..🤔
Everyone too weak of will to not be affected by liberal moral scolding about voting in November: just accept that Biden will win the white vote and nothing you say or do matters at all.
Look Spicy, none of us really give a flying fuck what you, the GOP or the New York Post thinks. Facts are that the Biden/Harris ticket is going to spank your asses all the way up and down the ballot.
The whole appeal of the Biden/Kamala ticket is that once they're elected you'll never have to care about BLM anymore.
LOLOL imagine thinking Joe Biden or Kamala Harris being even *remotely* Left. Biden is about as Radical as sex with socks on in the dark.
They're gonna pull out all the stops to keep Biden alive for the next 5 years, just so a woman will never be president.
Well ⁦ guess it goes to show you what sex does to help ones career..a great role model..thanks Democrats!..Red Wave in November 2020 is coming!
Biden is still going to win the white vote lmao
I ask White Democrats to quit attacking BIPOC who have their concerns on Biden or Harris. While most progressives will be voting for them because of what we’re up against, our feelings are valid and should not be ignored by your desires to have everyone vote Democrat.
What is today’s bigger news story?  Football decisions by Big 10 and PAC 10 or some random announcement from Biden about his VP?  I vote football!!  #wewanttowatchthemplay
I’m going to vote for Biden/Harris because of what is at stake, but it’s ok to be critical and not silent to the oppression of others.
The only way this could possibly be better is if Biden steps down on the convention floor, and they make Kamala the official nominee.
Biden already said he would VETO #Med4All
I can't believe Biden chose  as his running mate
I doubt Trump appoints Andrew to a post.  Oh wait.. you think choosing Harris helped Biden.  Nope.  Bad choice.
BREAKING: JOE BIDEN SELECTS KAMALA HARRIS AS HIS RUNNING MATE FOR THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.   Learn more here —-&gt;
Biden’s handlers made a tactics error.
Yeah I’m going to criticize anybody that hurts people. Democrat or Republican. I’m voting for Biden obviously because Undocumented lives are at stake but I won’t ignore facts.
Explain to me   Maybe I’m missing something. How can anyone in their right mind support Biden.
Hell yea... by trying to lockdown to slow the arrival to herd immunity, there’s 10 billion in annual sales awaiting Big Pharma.. 40-50 Billion in vaccine sales for the next president.  Biden cant wait to get a piece of that money.  The DC whores are lining up to get paid.
Whoever he picks on the short list is fine. It won't change my mind. I am voting for Biden. He doesn't need to reveal the pick until it's the right time. Don't give the GOP any ammunition. ❤
We can't let Joe Biden get into the White House...🤣
Should be used as a top campaign video clip against Biden.
Seltzer is such a joke. Like he's not gone on non-stop attacking President Trump since he's been in office. Oh my, little Brian is upset that other media would point out Biden's failing mental state..😉
Democrats upset that President Trump is making emergency decisions from one of his properties? A while back Nancy was stalling aid and talking about gourmet ice cream in her Mansion. Democrats have over used the social security scare to panic older voters.
So the Biden plan is to claim it's going to do what President Trump was already doing before Democrats power tripped on pandemic and stopped it??? Can you get a little more creative? Stop making claims that Democrats can't deliver on..😉
Wow, now if they find a Biden connection it would be over for Dems...
You expect this kind of misinformation from Democrats, lying is part of their nature...🤣🤣🤣 Truth is, Trump has more support now because of Biden..😉
He must work for Biden's campaign..🤣🤣🤣
This is exactly why Biden has waited to announce his VP. Don't give them anything until you have to. #WeHaveHerBack
I’ve said this every since he said he was running.  This is a plan by trump. Get him in the ballot to pull votes from Biden.Reporters hate you;except the ones you plant in the room so they can ask questions about Obama, Biden or anything else you want to gloat about.  And you NEVER actually answer the question. Also, you storm out like a baby 🍼
Using Fauci, Gates, Biden, Obama, Kamala, Clinton’s and many, many more to use COVID as a fear monger against the American people! People have lost everything while Blasio killed the elderly cramming ventilators down their throats
The debate over masks has moved to the presidential race.
A declaration of intent is not a confirmation of results, but the point stands that I believe we can hold Biden/Kamala more accountable than Trump by far. You may to disagree, but I made my point clear.
I may not want to vote for you or creepy Joe Biden....but I do want to say sorry that your brother is in the hospital. Hoping for rapid recovery. Light and love.
Who is saying this? I plan on blasting Biden's ass in office (and Kamala!). He's shit and deserves to be held accountable; however, I do think anything is better than Trump so I will support him into office. But yeah, no, this "I know what libtards are gonna do hurr durr" is 😂😂
'Every single American should be wearing a mask when they’re outside for the next three months at a minimum,’ the presumptive Democratic nominee said Thursday. What do you think&gt;&gt;
She is like Mitt Romney. Like the Dems, that live in Seattle. Portland. Chicago. NYC. What does Biden, say come on Jedi
Get Biden and Harris elected, and then drag them to the Left kicking and screaming.
Before y’all say Biden is gross too, we know. The sad part is they’re both bad, but unfortunately he’s the lesser of two evils, and at least he doesn’t lust about his daughter.
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his newly chosen running mate Kamala Harris campaigned together for the first time Wednesday. Here’s more&gt;&gt;
This Biden Harris announcement was not worth waiting 2 hours on. Total puke fest. Just a hint of things to come. Pandering racism medicare for all orange man bad. Going to be a great next 3 months.
The only ones that believe Biden and Harris are Far Left Socialists are Right Wingnuts.
All these celebrities have a lot to say about Biden &amp; kamala, but what about the elite pedophile ring? Or all the children that are going missing every single day? Where’s the concern about that? They’re just proving we have no reason to look up to them.
Even with this thread, I’ll vote Biden because the alternative is Trump, but anyone that screams to support Biden and Harris with no criticism can piss off. There’s plenty of legitimate criticism for both that they need to be taken to task on.
Vote for Biden then drag him and Harris to the Left kicking and screaming if necessary.
Let’s demand that the media tells about the pedophilia &amp; sex trafficking that happens every day Let’s demand that you &amp; other celebrities stop choosing to believe certain accusations &amp; not others How much of an uproar did Hollywood make about judge kavanaugh, but u endorse Biden
Hidin’ Joe Biden asked Phony Kamala Harris to join his failing Presidential campaign. The radical left is pushing Joe around and President Trump is standing up for America. Keep America Great!
Just when you thought the Biden campaign couldn’t possibly get any worse.
1. Biden said he wants to lock up all anarchists  2. Baby I’m an anarchist  3. Harris denied aid to trans women in prison  4. I’m a trans woman  5. Uh oh
How could anyone in their right mind think Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are fit to run our country? Mindblowing.
I love the Kamala pic but Biden could have picked potato salad with raisins in it and I’d still be excited about voting Trump out of office.
The problem with this statement is that America deserves better than Jack the Ripper. We also deserve better than Biden/Harris. Settling for less will always give us less and right now we need a whole lot.
Okay so can we agree Biden 2020 and Ocasio-Cortez 2028??
They aren’t saying Kamala shouldn’t accept they’re saying Biden shouldn’t have picked a prosecutor during the largest ever movement for police reform.
Biden selects K. Harris as running-mate. #Election2020
I’m not a fan of Joe Biden, but I AM HERE FOR KAMALA!!! 💙
BREAKING:
BREAKING: Joe Biden just lost the election 😂😂😂😂
Apparently Joe Biden still has enough of his mind left to not pick this disaster of a human being.
We NEED Joe Biden AND a Blue Senate and House to help us recover and move forward as ONE!
Joe Biden literally said that all black people are the same and think the same and that if you don't vote for him "you ain't black." Democrats think they OWN black votes...which shouldn't be surprising coming from the party that was pro-slavery.
I won’t enthusiastically vote for Biden. I will hold my nose and do so reluctantly and in protest as I believe the DNC has screwed Bernie twice now.
Where did I claim Biden was a “devout man of God”? I didn’t. The only points I raised were in response to things Trump said and did and nothing else. Trump claimed he was and his actions do not reflect this statement. He also claims to hate polls while bragging on their results.
Raise your hand if he’s better than Biden
We can't let corrupt Joe Biden destroy America.
You are absolutely insane. Your own Biden Obama administration ruled this was an assault on the officer. You again showed your lifelong racism towards black Americans this week and now at trying to stir up division again. Truly despicable.
As a republican I’m not a fan of Trump, but I’m REALLY not a fan of Biden, plus trump is funny so. Trump&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Biden
🤣🤣 Biden needs a nursing home.!
This is not white people! This is crazy Biden who has always talked down to other cultures, especially Black he, Pelosi and the Democrats HAVE NEVER done anything for any USA citizen. He’s a Pedo. You would have to be really crazy to vote Biden!
I feel like you went “all in” today with a king high flush and heard “call” and the republicans turned over the nut flush. Literally Biden hiding in a basement trying not to mess up this election. While you and Schumer got Trump re-elected this week
Well I personally try not to get to involved in politics, but from what it seems, Joe Biden is constantly rambling and doesn’t seem like he knows what he is talking about, honestly I don’t think Trump is much better at all, but he is better imo. Thank you for asking respectfully!
As a republican, I do believe Trump would run this country better than Biden, but I do not believe that either are great leaders at all
Pro-Trump bubble? 😂😂 The reality is that the government party you are applauding is the same party that sells aborted babies. Oh, my how does that work seeing as Biden is Catholic and all.  Christian? But you are okay with that.? Hypocrite much? 🤷🏻‍♀️
Why don’t you guys call up Schumer and Pelosi and let them know that if they don’t get this stimulus deal passed. Then all these ads and all the time you spent helping Biden won’t be worth a hill of beans come November.
The working-class will vote for Trump the Moochers of America will vote for Biden
Biden probably does not want to debate because there is a lack of adult diapers.
That's why they call him hiden Biden
The liberals are using the unemployed as a bargaining chip to get funding for their states. That’s the 100% truth to the matter. They aren’t negotiating. They are sticking to their position. Where is Biden? Where is anyone besides Pelosi and Schumer. They have miscalculated
We need a movement that shakes the ROOTS of AMERICA! Biden 2020!!If Biden wins the election there will be a record number of babies murdered in our country. God help us all!
Just because she didn't .......he won't have to go anywhere, Holl except back to the White House unless the Dems can cheat enough to push Biden through!🤔🤔🤔🤔😖😖😖😖
I would never vote for Biden or Harris!
They are still saying Biden leads Trump by 7. That is so hard for me to believe! I can't imagine that there is anyone who cares that little for America, but then I know a lot of Dems who seem to hate her! TRUMP 2020! VOTE RED ON NOV 3!
Bless Biden's heart, he only knows what his puppet masters know!
She's intelligent and cares about the  people of this country.  Hope you vote Biden-Harris 2020.
YES!  Fired up, ready to go vote the liar out and put Joe Biden in the White House!
Kamala Harris you were excellent today!  I contributed yesterday and today, and will work harder to do more.  You and Joe Biden are what the U.S. needs.  Don't let haters get in your head. LAUGH!, cause you are in theirs!
Yep!! Biden-Harris 2020!
KAMALA SAID: DO SOMETHING! I say: LET'S ALL VOTE BIDEN-HARRIS 2020!
I don’t care for Biden either but I’m damn sure not letting that dumb ass orange sit in office again
Excepting re-election campaigns? I mean, Gore ‘96, Biden ‘08, etc.
I just can’t vote for a baby killer. Plus i think principle and practicality need to be observed simultaneously. The lesser of 2 evils is not always a bad thing. We all know Jo has no chance. Trump is better than Biden.
So... Khamala openly said that she believes the rape accusers of Biden. Why would she get on a ticket with someone whom she believes to be a rapist? #landslide2020
Kamala Harris. Name some things that Joe Biden has done over the last 50 years to show he is fighting for us! That is a long long time and I can't think of even one!
I thought you had lost your mind for a moment. There will be no Biden-Harris Adm.
Truth is we have super shitty choices for the top two candidates. But, everyone that is ‘for’ Biden as a candidate, is all about whataboutisms. Nobody is voting FOR Biden, they are voting against Trump. That is dangerous.
Joe Biden announces  as his pick for VP running mate.
VP Kamala. Way to go Joe!    I picked the ⁦⁦ win two years before the 2016 election.   Now I’m calling for a double digit win for him this year. (Actually predicted it back in the spring.)
I'm on board!!!! BIDEN-HARRIS 2020! AND READY TO GET THAT LIAR Trump OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE! VOTE BIDEN-HARRIS 2020!
Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
So, a tweet announces Biden's pick? I find this very strange! Is Biden not able to even announce his running mate? I am very confused!!! VOTE RED ON NOV 3! TRUMP 2020!
Nope, Kamala Harris was just announced but not by Biden. .......strange!
Joe Biden hardest hit.
I honestly can’t tell whether you’re talking about Trump or Biden. I’m guessing Trump because it sounds like you want it to continue, but everything you’re saying also applies to Biden.Putting democrats (and many republicans) in a daily position of feeling that their very lives depend on Biden winning the election is perhaps the oddest of Trump’s campaign strategies.
You'll never see that under biden. In fact its the other way around. Haha. Creepy Joe aka Pedo Joe
Hey  you need to take  offline. He is spreading unproven Russian bullshit and trying to hurt Biden and his son. Johnson is a russian asset and needs to be removed from twitter.
I am for mail in ballots and absentee ballots....but I’ll say this.... I would and will crawl with a mask on to my polling place, if need be, to cast my vote for Biden/Harris.
This is ultimately why when people say their vote doesn't matter, it very much does. People may not like the choices of Biden and Harris but ultimately that's not all what's at stake. Barely winning elections guarantees gridlock  Moscow Mich happily xploitz.
So is Biden.
Just to be clear, it’s possible to not like Biden and Harris while also not being a fan of Trump... it’s our responsibility to stop having bad choices for president
You mean Vice President Joe Biden as of now. Don’t count your chickens before they hatch.  #PresidentJoe #PresidentBiden
The  reviewed all of Trump's television ads since June. Two-thirds contained clearly misleading claims or edited videos.
via  some good thoughts about Kamala’s family story. I’m hoping that she will share more of who she is and the family history that shaped her.
Only if Trump manages to steal it. Even China wants Biden to win because American instability rocks rest of world with uncertainty roiling their markets.
1) There has to be a POTUS. 2) There are only 2 real candidates. 3) You said you don't want 45, right? 4) Then vote for Biden.  #VoteByOct22 #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #VoteBlueNoMatterWho
So I notice a lot of folks out here simping for Julian Assange, an alleged rapist, because of his Wikileaks work.  But at the same time you folks are over here screeching inchoate about Biden and Trump because THEY'RE ALLEGEDLY RAPISTS TOO.   So pick a standard folks, please.
(ugh) What about...(don't do it)...you know (oh god don't)...Biden Thugs-N-Harmony
"The Q &amp; A period is useless if no one ever dares to ask real questions."  True, just like all of Biden's pressers - USELESS.
Many people are saying that Judge Pirro is full of shit. Including her fake news colleagues.
More accurately it’s Harris/Jill Biden, Soros, Pelosi, AOC, Waters, Schumer, Nadler,
from  "Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf told me in an interview for Axios on HBO that he 'would be concerned' about a President Biden."  And well he should be, because  will tell him "You're fired."
Regardless of whatever policies Biden is able to get approved
I realize. And Huckabee goes on air and questions Biden “as a man of faith” There is not a word to describe how inside out and upside down this world is
It would be nice to ask Biden to clarify. Did anyone do that or did they just nodded their head?
Fuck this election. Fuck Joe Biden. Fuck Trump.  #GeneralStrike #NewConstitution #DirectDemocracy
Fuck this election. Fuck Joe Biden. Fuck Trump.  #GeneralStrike #NewConstitution #DirectDemocracy
Does Biden wear a mask in the basement?  What an absolute joke!!!!
In general yes, but Biden is not mentally fit to lead in this instance which increases the importance of the VP choice. Biden and Harris couldn’t have been more different on the left, obviously the point for demographics...
Mike Milbury is the Joe Biden of NHL commentary.
So exactly what Biden &amp; Harris did yesterday? Prepared speeches attacking their opponents. It’s called campaigning.
What? How? When? Biden is not in charge. Where is the GOP that cared about it’s citizens and were once financial conservatives?
"Today, Israel and the United Arab Emirates have taken a historic step to bridge the deep divides of the Middle East." Joe Biden said. "The UAE's offer to publicly recognize the State of Israel is a welcome, brave, and badly-needed act of statesmanship."
Fox News host baselessly claims that 'something's going to happen' to Joe Biden, forcing her colleague to walk her comment back  via
is helping Trump all it can by reporting Trump's talks and scarcely mentioning Biden.  Congress is helping Trump by failing to pass legislation to protect national security. The Senate confirms every judge that will permit Trump to live the life of a criminal dictator.
Yeah, it's all "so confusing".  Joe Biden is calling the agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates “a historic step to bridge the deep divides of the Middle East.”  “a welcome, brave, and badly-needed act of statesmanship”
Joe Biden is calling the agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates “a historic step to bridge the deep divides of the Middle East.”  “a welcome, brave, and badly-needed act of statesmanship”
So you're saying the media &amp; Biden are all wrong about UAE?  Biden is calling the agreement between Israel &amp; the United Arab Emirates “a historic step to bridge the deep divides of the Middle East.” “a welcome, brave, &amp; badly-needed act of statesmanship”
Nothing could be worse for the stock market or the economy than Trump has been! #Fake If Biden wins, get ready for Trump to punish America #SmartNews

We need someone to take charge! This should have been mandated at the Federal level months ago.  Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks  #FoxNews
When the #MobBoss speaks  covers his every word.  When VP Biden speaks, they mention in passing that he has spoken, but other than a still picture, no coverage.  This is obviously one-sided coverage similar to 2016.
Biden will be the first President to haunt the White House before death

You need a spelling teacher. Biden can spell. You and Trump cannot. BidenHarris 2020.
Pro-tip for those of you apolitical people out there: you can go to your twitter settings and mute certain words (ie Biden, Trump, Kamala, Pence) for a set duration of time and you won’t see them on your timeline! Problem mostly solved 😎
Since none of his buddies went to the funeral seems sad they are using his account. RIP Herman Cain. Twitter Account Attacks Joe Biden and Kamala Harris From Beyond the Grave #SmartNews
My guy, no matter what side you vote, this is a horrible choice for the VP... do some research on her policy ideas and tell me you want to live in a country with her policies in place. Because ultimately if Biden is elected, she is in command.
Since I oppose war pig Biden &amp; his cop sidekick, I get attacked for having "white privelege".   Biden led the murder of a million brown Iraqis.  Ignoring his imperialistic mass murder is American privilege.
Then we have this, Biden with Byrd, great friends with former KKK member!! 🤔🤔
Jan 22nd, 2021, an independent prosecutor must be appointed to investigate the Trump administration and the members of the Republican Party that enriched themselves.  Biden must stay out of it so it doesn't look like or become a political retribution investigation.
I really wish that Biden/Harris would emphasize Trump admn management of the pandemic and the tax cuts for the 1% - these 2 issues alone would get them elected!!!
Can somebody please tell sycophantic Barbie  that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris aren’t in power yet.
Love how Kamala refers to Trump as “Trump” and calls him out for his lack of leadership.   Joe Biden, Kamala Harris appear together as running mates for first time Watch live: Joe Biden, Kamala Harris appear together as running mates for first time
Everyone who thinks Joe Biden is not mentally “all there” should go watch the speech he gave this evening introducing Kamala. Powerful speech delivered flawlessly and followed with a strong, inspiring speech from  Excited to watch this election play out.
You’re telling me that we have no better options than Biden/Kamala and Trump/Pence?   Also, abolish our for profit prison and criminal justice systems.
Great line: “Kamala Harris: For the People”
I honestly don't think Biden would finish his term if elected POTUS. I believe that's one of the reasons he took longer than anyone in history to announce his VP choice: they had to vet them more than normal.  Also, he's said as much himself. 3:45 mark
So does my wife and she is 100% for Biden/Harris.  This is a really stupid argument.
Biden has substantial leads in multiple swing states Clinton lost in 2016. Nothing perfectly certain, but unless big improvement for Trump by September, he WILL lose.
Since Joe Biden or Al Gore 😑
yeah they both evil but don't even act like Biden is on the same level of evil as trump.
For years  political writer for  has assigned arrows (up or down) to political figures. He offers his latest arrows for President Trump, former Vice-President Biden and Gov.  Hutchinson.
it's ok if you don't like Biden and Harris. you can bitch with like minded people. but if they're going to win, you need to vote and you need to keep your grievances to a minimum. they get shredded by the right every day ......it's fuck trump, and they're our only way out rn.
Yeah, Biden is so damn good that he's been in Congress for over 30+ years &amp; the VP as 8yrs and we still have (according to the Left): systemic racism white supremacy police brutality illegal immigration expanded the never ending wars  Awesome!
See this shit is why I don't like her, Biden I can deal with he's going to go do old white men shit. Obvious and easy to lean into. She's too much of a contrarian republican wet dream. I really wish he'd have picked Warren, fuck the optics and obvious black-pander with this one.
The best argument I have heard for Biden is he would be better to protest against.  Imperialist oligarchy demands low standards.
It infuriates me that Biden showing empathy and humility is seen as a flaw.
I don't post political issues, however the decision to select Kamala Harris as Bidens VP pick is going to eat at Trump like a chain saw cutting through a tree! Get registered, let your voice be heard and VOTE!!! BIDEN/HARRIS 2020!
All I can say about the ‘Biden / Harris’ ticket is... #TrumpPence2020 🇺🇸  We need a #RedTsunamiAcrossAmerica🇺🇸
Anyone else’s berner friends pissed about the VP nomination and think that Biden has lost the election because of it?
Yes, I'm familiar with how hard biden has screwed poc communities, and how much of a fucking bungler Harris is. I think we need to burn a federal building for every home stolen and flip a cop car for every family forced to live in their ride thanks to her letting the Nooch slip.
Regardless of how you feel about Kamala, don’t let that keep you from voting in November. Not voting for Biden is voting for Trump.
If you love America and love your rights as a citizen of the United States of America,  you cannot allow the leftist and socialist party win this election.  God forbid!!! Biden and Harris are evil.  Destruction of America would be inevitable!🙏🏼🇺🇸
Enemy from within, just like Biden!!!
Biden/Harris ?  Seriously?  What a disaster for America!!! Wake up, America!   God bless America and not allow evil leaders to rule this country!!! 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
I could vote for Biden/Harris if I didn't pledge my voice to Iraq War Orphans &amp; Occupied Palestinians.
no one is saying trump is better???sure he’s worse but that’s not gonna make me pretend that kamala &amp; biden aren’t both terrible people
To be fair, the mass uprisings are against exactly the kind of policies Biden has instituted throughout his political career as well.  They twinkies, yo
People are dying, yea, and war criminal Biden led the killing of a million iraqis. So what's your point?
The words "by now" are journalistic malpractice.  War criminal Biden  has always been committed to right wing neoliberal imperialism
Broke:  staying home bc you think biden/Harris is meh or bad  Woke:  doubling down on your involvement and advocacy, getting the white nationalists out of the White House, and organizing to hold the Democratic Party accountable if it gains power
Would be nice to see the memo to see what it says.  Democratic Party sets rules for criticizing Biden’s VP pick Kamala Harris -  -
Ok, for real, aside from 'literally anyone else' why Biden?
And he has explained that this cartoon has been on his desk for decades to remind himself that other people are going through a lot worse than you are at any given moment.
Donald Trump tries to destroy women who stand up to him. Joe Biden chose one to be his Vice President.
Trump calling anyone phony is a hypocrisy of gargantuan proportions. The fraud in chief has so many fraud charges against him Twitter would have to allow 5-8 full pages just to list them.  is a fraud, phony, liar, just to name a few. He is done! Biden/Harris 2020
BTW, there are no pint glasses available in the Biden/Harris online store.
BREAKING: Democratic nominee for president, Joe Biden, announces former democratic presidential candidate and renowned Houston-area Coven High Priestess, Marianne Williamson, to serve in the cabinet as the very first US Secretary of Love
it would be a better ticket if Joe Biden were her running mate...no one votes for the "great running mate"
Hours ago, VP Biden asking Sen Harris to join the ticket. Incredible image.  Also if you zoom in Biden’s phone looks like it’s been through hell and that is *so* relatable
This is the VP choice of a confident candidate, and campaign, who believe they are winning. And who believe that Biden will be sworn in as the 46th president. Here's why Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris as his VP - CNNPolitics
Outstanding choice. Smart, intelligent, great partner for Joe Biden.

MY THOUGHTS ON BIDEN’S VP CHOICE (THREAD)
hey where is the periscope about joe biden vp pick you said you would do one immediately if it was harris. You were right as hell dude.
Joe Biden just won the election by bringing Kamala Harris on board. I absolutely love her. #KamalaHarrisForVP
I just helped plan my 30th 2 years ago done ✅ won’t do another back to Biden/Harris
If you can’t get behind Biden, get behind Harris. If you can’t get behind Harris, get behind your vulnerable neighbor.  Trump is a colossal failure. We sent among the worst of us to govern us. He must be removed in November. We are poorer, sicker, more endangered than 4 years ago
Trump: Biden Is Insulting Men Everywhere by Picking Woman as Running Mate #SmartNews #WomanHater
I love Harris and Biden
I can't imagine a ticket I'd be less excited about than a Biden/Harris ticket.
That damned Joe Biden store just ate up my allowance for the month.
Biden chose Harris cause he likes Maya Rudolf more than Kate McKinnon.
Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate  via
This is the first time a Black woman has been selected for the position #NWArk #NWAnews
Really proud of the Biden campaign. They’re serious about winning.   Biden/Harris 2020
Geez Literally anyone could be a better option than Biden/Harris . Used to be a proud democrat now don’t even know if i can vote 🤢
Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
The Joe Biden store just got my monthly allowance and I'm all for it. The way the checkout was pausing I think a lot of people had the same idea.
I just ha e to believe, she and Biden taked much during this whole process. There is a plan.  is integral to that plan.
The Harris pick tells me the Biden campaign is serious about winning.   Which is something I haven’t felt from our national party in a long time.
“I can't wait to watch Mike Pence debate Kamala Harris“  VP debates mean...nothing.  It’s the Biden-Trump debates that carry weight: POTUS  I don’t think the debates will happen. I think Democrats will back out to protect Biden’s image. I hope I’m wrong. Very wrong. We’ll see.
Same here. WHEN Biden/Harris win the election, the floodgates will open! 😭
I am officially excited about something since the last election. Biden/Harris 2020! Let’s elect them in November!
President Biden. Vice President Harris. Senate Majority Leader Warren.
Today is a win for Black women!! Congrats Senator Kamala Harris on Biden's Vice President running mate selection!!! ✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿
‼️BREAKING:  announces  as his running mate for the #2020presidentialelection.   #NWAnews
Lol all of sudden I care again. Biden Harris 2020
i know, what a time for Joe Biden to sneak in that VP announcement…
Atp Im not even anticipating who Biden’s VP pick will be. I’ve waited too long to find out. I’ll just roll with whoever he (DNC) chooses 🤷🏾‍♂️
I’m voting For Biden so we can give this shit up
I was the same, I fully understand wanting a more progressive candidate, but if you are sick of what's happening in America then you need to be ridin with Biden.
I saw reports of Kamala unfollowed Biden on Twitter.
Everyone always asks who Biden's VP pick is. Nobody ever asks how Biden's VP pick is. 😥
How anti-climatic will it be if the US gets its first woman President because Biden wins and at some point has to resign due to health concerns? (I get that he's perfectly healthy for 78, but its a valid hypothetical)
Poll: Biden maintains 10-point national lead over Trump
About the only time  and  ever mention VP Biden is when they are reporting what nasty, lying thing Trump says about him.
And that is EXACTLY what I tell those who aren't big Biden fans: It is whom he will choose to be cabinet heads, to be advisors, to be researchers, etc. that I am voting for. So far, they seem to buy it!
A theory: Biden decided on her months ago but went through the process of meeting others because he wanted to be absolutely sure, and because the campaign wanted to misdirect everyone. She’s been too conspicuously absent from the conversation since nearly its beginning.
I have learned that Joe Biden’s pick is exactly the person you thought it would be and when it’s announced you should either be incredibly excited or neutral about it, but in no way disappointed because honestly who needs that right now?
If Biden wins Arkansas, I may run 🏃‍♀️ down the street screaming!
Y’all are actually voting for Biden? LMAOO
"the biden's vp pick" i'm so excited by the scoop i can't even type properly
I KNOW WHO THE BIDEN'S VP PICK IS  it's the girl reading this ❤️
I just searched biden______.com for most running mate combinations. No dice.
Biden will lose... by a lot. The dems destroying of America will end up destroying the chance to win. All the dems had to do was stay out of their own way...they couldn’t do it and it will cost them the election. It’s a shame
Biden will lose...by a lot. You can thank Antifa and BLM for your downfall.  Americans will not stand for Dems burning America to the ground. The hard truth is about the slap you across the forehead on Nov 3rd
The next VP must be a Black woman. Because the next president after POTUS Biden must be a Black woman.
Not a trump supporter. They are both clowns, the thought of Biden letting the convicts run and burn the country to the ground is unsettling. Democratic mayors and governors casted my vote. Unlike you, I’m able to swing either way without a bias position
Not one single thing in your left leaning article did it reference anything about race. Want to brush yourself off and take another swing at it?   Below specifically refers to race though oooooofffff! Talk about sticking your foot in your mouth 🤦
That statement doesn’t refer to race whatsoever. U want to brush yourself off and take another swing at it?  PS. Never said anything about Biden molesting children, we do however, have video/photos of Biden being very creepy around children
No way Biden wins. You gotta really hate America to vote for a joker who stands by and watches his people burn America. Oh and she says hi 👋  😂😂😂
I'll start watching them again after they institute the daily  Biden conferences.
Mask vs no mask   Fall sports vs no Fall sports   Virtual school vs traditional school  Trump vs Biden   Man everyone is assembling like this with their people or crew depending on what side your on. Going to he an epic showdown in the coming weeks and months.
We own one. Joe Biden owns the other
Do I think Biden will win if we work our asses off? yes. Do I think Trump will definitely win if we don’t? Yes. Can trump win by stealing the election, even if we work our asses off? Yes.
That really been my argument the whole time tho man. In relation to the Biden tweet. AA are disproportionately treated differently by police and I feel that is undisputable. But ya boy just got to work. Gonna have to carry this convo on later on
Joe Biden is proposing a federal Tax Credit Scholarship that would be even larger than the one championed by Donald Trump &amp; Betsy DeVos. Among other things, Biden's proposal would help lower-income families participate in education "pandemic pods" #SchoolChoiceBiddingWar
President Joe Biden, Vice President Daenerys Stormborn “Breaker of Chains, Mother of Dragons” Targaryen sounds very good to me personally
it’s absolutely hilarious that people think Joe Biden is anywhere near being a radical liberal
After Biden is inaugurated, I vote we cut bait on each &amp; every one of them. I am just sick to death of ignorance.
Obama alumni message boards buzzing with rumor that Joe Biden has inquired about whether “the gal with the dragons from the television, you know the one” was eligible to run as his VP.
Is ANYONE else even remotely bothered by the fact that Biden's VP running mate will be selected based on their sex and their skin color?   Just curious.   Sounds like the most racist &amp; sexist criteria on earth to me. 🤷   opinion
Biden is not bite, he is just a political lever to use in the long process of unfucking the things trump fucked up. Tool, not solution.
"Replacing Trump with Biden is like shitting your pants and then changing your shirt."
Is it true Joe Biden is set to name Bob Vance (Vance Refrigeration) as his running mate???
You forget Biden was VP when that administration did it. It survived
I'm thinking it was telling her not to siphon off votes from Biden.
Biden should just challenge Trump to a 3 mile walk. Honestly don't know if Trump has walked that far in years. It really requires Trumpian hubris to go after Biden as somehow being senile and infirm. Trump must be looking at himself in funhouse mirror.
Screaming the following into the void:  Trump *will* break laws to steal this election. Trump *will* drive the post office into the ground to steal this election.  Trump *is* working woth foreign powers to spread disinformation about Joe Biden.  1/x
Reporters writing their 20th headline this week about Biden's possible pick for VP.   THIS IS IT! HE'S ALMOST READY, GUYS!
Y’all need some patience, re: Joe Biden’s running mate.
The thought that any and all 45 has done thus far could be taken as precedent is enough to drive us to despair.  I'm very glad you weren't thinking Biden could be as low. Sorry for snarling!
You can bet  and  will carry every word of it then talk about it all day.  Joe Biden?  Who's he?  Very lopsided coverage, just like 2016.
What a brainwashed approach... did you not hear the interview where Biden said black people all think alike?? He represents just as much ignorance as Trump or worse because he doesn’t have the cognitive ability to lead the country. We need to expand outside of the two parties
Putin, Russia, Joe Biden, and the specific word denigrate. Been seeing these keywords in tweets a lot today. You a bit dude or just a shill?
I fuckin love your Biden artwork!  Please do the Donald too for balance &amp; to show just how shitty the 2 Corporate Imperialist "choices" truly are.  As Assange said of Hillary vs. Trump, "it's a choice between cholera &amp; malaria."
Arkansas won’t win any games this year. Won’t lose any either. Ain’t nobody playing football. Ain’t none of us having any fun until Joe Biden is the President of the United States
Is it true Joe Biden just announced that his running mate would be — and I’m quoting directly here — a “boss-ass ‘64 GTO with the Tri-Power carb”???
I don’t think trump or Biden should be running the country. Biden has been saying the whole time he needs a VP who can be POTUS day one. Obviously something is off with Joe. I don’t see him finishing a term &amp; Trump, I have a long list of reasons why I can’t get down with him. Ha
Why Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would be a disastrous duo in the year of George Floyd #SmartNews they are the #PerfectDuoInTheYearOfFloyd!!!!!! 🤬
I havent heard Biden say any of that &amp; I watch multiple news outlets every day. Biden is actually moderate &amp; doesnt push socialism like youre saying. Will he conform to the new left, thats TBD but I hope he doesnt go extreme bc he doesnt need to for success in the election.
Virginia mayor urged to resign after saying Biden picked ‘Aunt Jemima’ as his running mate  via
This straight white Democrat agrees with you. I’ll sulk if it’s not Harris but I’m still doing everything I can to get Biden in.
Our biggest #threat is Trump  ⁦ US officials: Russia denigrating Biden ahead of election #SmartNews
DON'T FALL FOR THE SCAM!  China wants Trump reelected.  They know the best way to help him is to make you believe they want Biden.  Don't be fooled!
Got a huge tip about who Joe Biden is picking as his VP and let me tell you:  you get a VP and you get a VP and you get a VP too.
Can you also explain away the Biden comment: “You’ve got more questions?' Biden replied. 'Well I tell you what, if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black.”
‘Sit down’: Trump buried in mockery and scorn for claiming Biden ‘no longer worthy of the Black Vote’ #SmartNews that and wants to take away GOD as a practicing Catholic! This guy just gets NOTHING rightLiterally my patience for neoliberal white women who pat their little Biden/Harris button with pride and think showing up to a BLM march lead by cops is at an all time fucking low.  You don’t give a fuck about black lives lmfao shut your ass up.
Biden definitely qualifies. 🥒
The statute of limitations won’t have run out by Jan. 20. Biden must have an AG ready that day to start filing charges against these criminals.
Stay strong folks! 👊🏻🙏🏻🇺🇸 We can defeat the Obama/Biden/Clinton criminal, trafficking, pedophilia cabal, their media, and crooked globalist partners.
If a Christian does any research into the Biden/Harris policies &amp; track record of voting, there is no way you could vote for these two crooks.
Let’s take down the entire Obama/Biden/Clinton Criminal, Trafficking, &amp; Pedophilia ring!!
We are witnessing the methodical dismantling of the Deep-State Obama/Biden/Clinton Criminal, Trafficking, and Pedophilia ring! #ObamaBidenClintonGate 🍿🥤
can’t wait to see joe biden’s reaction when he finds out he picked kamala harris
Vernon is spot on!  Biden &amp; Harris’ record with black/ brown Americans is horrendous!
Vote for Biden!
The choice is crystal clear: Trump = God, Faith &amp; Religious Freedom 🙏🏻🇺🇸  Biden = Remove God, Late-Term Abortion, No Police, Open Borders, Payments to Illegals, High Taxes.....
Biden &amp; Harris are Deep-State tyrants.  They are proven, verified, criminals from the Obama/Biden/Clinton Trafficking/ Pedophilia ring.
Kamala Harris is just another desperate, sick, Epsteiner.  She is a product of the Obama/Biden/Clinton criminal regime.
So I’m a child r*ape survivor and I am disappointed with fellow leftists, who preach all about mental health, attacking people who won’t vote for Biden on the basis of “harm reduction”.  I won’t vote at all if I try to vote Biden. I will have a panic attack in the parking lot.
And Joe Biden is trying to give credit for that to Obama!😂😂
Another truth...I just can not fathom why anyone can't see how well this President is conducting business for the American people! Perfect, no but still better than anything Biden ticket can bring!
Is it a wasted vote if you don’t vote for Biden? Please explain your side after you choose!
Franklin Graham warns Biden-Harris ticket ‘should be a great concern to all Christians’ - Fox News  via
If the Kanye West campaign is some not-so-secret plot to steal votes from Biden, why did he bother getting ballot access in Arkansas and Oklahoma?
I know the feeling it's crazy but unfortunately some of us is still in love with Obama. We are getting shame for not wanting to support Biden and Karma Sutra Harris.
Trump is coool! Nasty Pelosi will not be a goid president. That’s what will happen if Biden/Harris get elected!
And knocked Biden off snd Harris up!😂😂
It gets worst if a Black Man criticize Kamal Harris on her record alone, we are labeled a Misogynist. I called one bc I've been going in and refusing to support the Biden/Kamala ticket.
Me: we gotta vote for Biden. It sucks. But it is what it is right now.   Y’all: But what about...   Me: SHUT THE FUCK UP
Sen Harris, do you still believe the women who say Former VP Biden did something inappropriate to them?Do they still deserve to be heard? Like when you accused Justice Kavanaugh of inappropriate behavior? Or is this a case of #doublestandard #justwondering
Joe Biden is a 50-year corrupt, career, politician and a stone cold crook.
Harris is just another Obama/Biden/Clinton Cabal crook.
This presidency has been such an unconventional one. Plus Biden will come with a more &gt;&gt; progressive cabinet &lt;&lt; That’s so important. Plus I was talking to another PS friend and we think ppl have been so desensitized to the horror that has been this fucking presidency
Anyway, no one is saying that Biden is the optimal choice. In a perfect world, we could go third party &amp; say fuck these two old hags but that isn’t realistic. Is Biden problematic? Yes. But you have to take into account that Biden is not going to have all the leeway trump had —&gt;
This...this is y’all’s Presidential candidate? I know Biden isn’t much better but come on
Many of us live in states that have zero chance of breaking for biden, many others live in states that have zero chance of going to Trump.  I live in Arkansas the only way I can definitely waste my vote is to cast it for Biden. At least voting third party gives my vote meaning.
Maybe Biden should... he is the nominee
Americans: Defund the police!  Biden: *runs with a cop*
And that's where we get into a very grey area.  Some priests still allow Biden to participate in Mass and take Communion. Then there are some that don't, like you've pointed out.
Technically, Biden IS a Catholic.  This is totally different than saying he is in Communion with the Catholic Church.   Most non Catholics probably don't understand the difference.
It’s SO SO much bigger than not liking Biden and/or Kamala...it’s about children in cages, it’s about the future of title ix, it’s about funding for HBCU’s, it’s about reproductive rights, it’s about the future of the USSC for the rest of our LIFETIMES. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
✝️ 🙏🏼 abiding with Biden 🙏🏼 ✝️
Trying to figure out what the Biden camp is thinking.   Maybe they see a ground swell of push back against the protests going on across the country.  We'll restore "law and order".  It will play well with moderates on both sides.
Uhhhh, not that it matters, but I thought Biden was catholic.
Because Biden definitely isn't here cognitively for anything that taxing, kinda like the presidency itself...
Up thinking about this Biden-Harris ticket. So many non-Republican college students I know backed Elizabeth or Bernie. How are y'all feeling about Kamala as VP?
Whewweeeeeeee!  It's 1am, time to get ready for work! Biden and Harris is a great start to my day!  RAWR!!!!!!!!! 🦖  #BidenHarris2020
You really want to run this ad?  Aren’t you worried this will cause your base to vote for Biden? I mean, being a racist is what most of them love you for.  I think about the house I passed today w/ a Confederate flag next to a Trump sign, whatever will they do if they see this 😳
A Biden harris would be a good debate too
Biden picks another racist as his running mate. She locked up so many other blacks with her stupid anti drug laws.
Oh sure I think he just means that enthusiastic Warren supporters are frequently miscast as trenchant members of the party’s left when, for both policy and stylistic reasons, they’re often pretty mainstream. I personally went with Biden over Bernie after Warren dropped out.
Great, a cop... I'm sure that will appeal to... Republicans maybe... just like Biden. But there were definitely better choices. Her record, much like Bidens puts her pretty squarely on the wrong side of history, Btwn his crime bill and her prosecutorial career.
One of the things that infuriates me the most is the spectacle involved in the VP pick (not specifically Harris).  Like, rather than acting like it was a normal thing to pick from only women, y’all sucked Biden off as if he himself granted women liberty
I love how as soon as Biden announced Kamala Harris as his running mate, Maya Rudolph began trending. 😂 We’re ALL ready for those SNL skits!
Yeah, when I think of the radical left I too imagine *checks notes* Joe Biden and Kamala Harris
Mom is back on the ticket, boys and squirrels 😍🙌🏻
Consuming dem media at the moment is exhausting. If you genuinely think Biden will win Texas/Georgia I have beachfront property in Idaho to sell you
Damn, Biden really took like 4 months to pick the VP we all thought he’d pick anyways lmao
What do y’all think about Joe Biden and Kamala Harris?
Given that Biden was chosen by the Obama campaign for particular signalling, the Biden campaign choosing Harris is completely thematically sound.
Joe Biden picked her to be VP
Good thing Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris as his running mate!  We secured California!
I honestly feel like Joe Biden made a mistake picking Kamala as a VP &amp; we just might be stuck with Donald bitch for another 4 years.
If Biden announces his VP pick at 4:20pm I'll die! 🤟🏻
No thanks!!! .....and the Obama/Biden/Clinton cabal would get away with Treason, Sedition, $ Laundering, Human Trafficking, Pedophilia, and Murder just to name a few...
Joe Biden is a 50-year crook and con-man.  VP of the most corrupt, criminal regime in American history.
The Obama/Biden/Clinton criminal cabal was and is the most corrupt, evil, regime in American history.
I mean, they picked Biden to run for president, so....
Would love to hear them sing at Biden’s inauguration!
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
Did Biden remember to bring the cookies to you?
What a horrible crock of 💩, Biden oposes a single payer system that would provide universal coverage. The only people benefiting from his plan are insurance companies and prescription drug manufacturers
Straight from Joe Biden’s mouth. #CreepyJoe #QuidProJoe #YouAintBlack
All Obama/Biden/Clinton Criminal Cabal Thugs!!
The media is mum about the massive, exposed Obama/ Biden/ Clinton Trafficking/ Pedophilia ring.
Joe Biden thinks he owns all black voters.  Biden is a stone cold crook.  This thug has gotten ultra-wealthy scamming blacks for 50 years!
Stupidity cubed! Trying  to protect "China Joe" Biden!
Rice, Obama, and Biden are stone cold criminals who belong behind bars for a long, long time.
Biden and Bloomberg both only ran to undermine the Sanders campaign, neither of them care about the welfare the nation.
People: shouldn’t it bother you that Biden is old and not always sharp when speaking publicly?  Me:
Creepy Joe Biden &amp; the entire (Obama/Biden/Clinton) criminal cabal is owned by China 🇨🇳 and Iran 🇮🇷.  They sold their souls to these countries.
Shut down the Obama/Biden/Clinton Trafficking &amp; Pedophilia ring.  It’s gone on way too long!
What a crock of BS, Biden already told the rich and corporations that "nothing will change"... GTFOH with this platitudinal BS.
You know why? Who are the Traffickers? Obama/Biden/Clinton cabal ✅ Hollywood ✅ The Media ✅  Make sense now?
Obama/Biden/Clinton regime ✅ Hollywood ✅ The Media ✅
Biden will have no say in this.  The DNC will hand Creepy Joe a black woman.  You can book it.  They have already caved to the mob....and the infamous ‘Democrat Plantations’ will continue for them.
This $430M will be used to specifically fight the now notorious (Obama/Biden/Clinton Trafficking/ Pedophilia) ring.
Worse comes to worse, Biden fucks us over (kind of like we are now) and we try this again in 4 years 😩😩 I just can’t expect different results from the same situation
Muhfuckas talmbout how can you vote for Biden with the dumb shit he says?! Easy, he’s not Trump!!! 4 years of Trump has me in a desperate state of mind this election
The Obama/Biden/Clinton regime is one big lie. #Treason #Trafficking #Pedos #MoneyLaundering
All funded &amp; coordinated by the Obama/Biden/Clinton DNC.  A regime of Lawless Thugs.
Yes, probably because the only thing that makes Biden a Democrat is the D next to his name because it certainly isn't his record and definitely not his current policy platform
The difference is, and I know it’s hard but try to keep up, what Biden did was ILLEGAL.
Justice please come for Obama/Biden/Clinton criminal, trafficking, and pedo regime
To be fair, Clinton chose Tim Kaine to be her vice, not the other way around. Biden would be the first to choose a woman vice. Reading it the other way is twisting Dowd's words.
Empty platitudes, where are the policies that will let us achieve these goals? How can we have economic equity without criminal justice reform including the end of Marijuana prohibition, and Medicare for all. I don't believe for a second that Biden has plans that move us forward
Joe Biden: "I promise to raise taxes"  Literally
My emotional state is irrelevant. I try to cite facts, whether anyone takes me seriously or not. isn't my concern. Whomever Biden chooses I will defend but some will be easier than others. Some Democrats feel we shouldn't hash out our differences in public. I'm not one of them.
You see, if Biden wore a helmet, he would engage in more risky biking behavior, because of a false sense of security the helmet creates. Maybe he would also wear it incorrectly. Also, there are no good RCTs showing that helmets work.
This is funny that’s all I don’t care how long Biden takes to pick a veep
I'll vote for Camela Harris if Biden picks her, but without going into much detail. I would prefer someone who wasn't a prosecuting attorney. On the plus side I expect she'll use her courtroom lawyering skills to tear Mike Pence  a new one! Unfollow me if you like.
Biden is the System ✔️ Biden is the Establishment ✔️ Biden is the Deep-State ✔️ #A50YearConMan

Joe Biden is a 50-year, corrupt, liberal, Democrat, establishment elitist who thinks he owns the black vote! #ShowJoeHeDoesntOwnYou
Add the Mayor of Las Vegas to list of Mayors &amp; Governors who have sold their soul to the (Obama/Biden/Clinton) Criminal-Trafficking-Pedo cabal.
This is complete &amp; total DNC propaganda and lies.  Pathetic.  You should be behind bars right along with your Obama/Biden/Clinton criminal-trafficking-pedo cabal 🤮I want to help volunteer my time with this. I cannot donate at this time as the Biden campaign has me tapped out.  How do I sign up to be a volunteer ???  ?
The only reason that Democrats want mail in voting is so they can steal the election. They know Biden is not capable of winning so they want to try stealing it. Trump 2020 🇺🇲🇺🇲
What it doesn’t say is how many black voters would not have voted for biden earlier
Contrast: Biden was instrumental in making sure Iran got tons of cash &amp; eventually nukes. “the Iran talks could prove to be one of Biden's most important—and potentially one of his last—acts in politics.” Vs Israel peace deal. 🤔   #arpx
Harris Biden n Obama lie more
The one thing I can not wait for when we have a Biden/Harris administration is the Trump Crime Commission run by AG Glen Kirschner!   Everyone of these criminals and their accomplices need to pay for enabling this crook!
Vote Biden. Don’t repeat your mistake
You can say that again. My stepmom is vehemently anti-Trump and will be voting for Biden and Harris this November. What an asshole. I am so glad I know the truth about  and  and
Donald Trump isn’t good at making himself “voteable” but he is extremely good at making other people seem extremely “unvotable.” Donal Trump is gonna EAT Biden alive for his Kamala pick.
Why doesn’t Biden take questions. Get him off the TelePrompTer and let’s see him bumble his way.  You are all nothing but traitors. Go away.
Another Fox survey has Biden up by 7pts.  Who the hell do they survey?
Biden - Harris - Wrong for America.  Trump - Pence - Right for America...because, yes, the soul of our nation is at stake.  Trump 2020
This is what will happen if Biden becomes president. Control over our lives.
this is outrageous! I have donated to the Biden, Harris, BidenHarris campaigns as well as many Senatorial efforts. I have little $. But Bloomberg has never given money promised! AOC instead of him. I’m angry!
I learned from my vote in 2016 which is why I will vote for Biden in 2020.
4) this nonsense, I’ll take and I did take Trump over party, he has looked out for our best interest from day one, he has always loved this country as I do, every democrat I know are dispicable liars just in it for themselves and republicans, VOTE TRUMP!!! Leave the biden trash
1)Why do you think democrats didn’t complain they wanted that knowing it would get worse before elections and hope they could blame Trump, the democrat ticket is a direct result of the corrupt party biden has no chance he admitted he is in it for one term, this all to try and
She’s not a puppet like Biden and Harris
He's far from perfect. He's better than Biden and the Dems.
Wait isn’t Biden choosing Harris a symbol of how Joe DOESN’T prefer personal loyalty over all else? She did attack him during the primary debates.
Of course I voted for Hillary, just like the majority of voters did. And I will vote for Biden, just like the majority of voters will. And no, unlike just an entry on a flight log, I use actual incriminating evidence (video, accusations from victims, quotes from participants).
I will be voting for Biden because Trump is the most dangerous president I’ve seen in my lifetime.
Joe Biden pronounced it the same way....
Biden Harris - Wrong for America.  Trump 2020
I have loved learning from you and if you think Trump is awesome or just ok or needs to be replaced or if Biden is awesome or just ok or should have been Bernie... honestly I just want to get published. And if your work helps me do that, think/post what you want.
You mean where Harris will be speaking. Biden will just stand there and stutter incoherent sentences
'Kamala will challenge my assumptions, ask the hard questions."-great message by Biden! #BidenHarris2020
I can’t understand how the people who have listened to Ku Klux word salad for the last four years have the fucking audacity to call Biden senile
Journos just making it up as they go along.  Anything to try and stay in that "Biden for Pres" lane.  Goodness.  They have no shame.  Harris isn't a small "c" conservative, that's an absolutely laughable thing to write.  She's a "Big PL", progressive liberal.  What a joke.
Ah you finally caught him!  Now listen to Biden, he is running for US senate!  You missed that didn’t u?   Your guy can’t put two coherent sentences together and Trump runs the world!
I held my nose and voted for Hillary b/c I recognize a narcissistic personality when I see one  This year I'm enthusiastically voting for Joe Biden not only because my initial judgment of Donald Trump was right, but b/c Biden is the right man to heal our country.  #LincolnVoter
My Brit buddy just passed me again and still laughing saying Harris is that all you got, I told him I have Trump the democrats have her, still he said is that all biden and harris hahahaha
Let’s be honest no one even cares about that debate. Trump will be bathing in Biden’s blood by the time it’s all over and Dems will be looking for a replacement. ( which im sure they’re actively already doing )
Biden is currently more likely to win... but it's not guaranteed.
pardon me, FIRST what we’re not gonna do is not manage to elect Biden in 2020 like some of y’all did with Hillary in 2016 just because she doesn’t check every one of your seventy set dream socialist boxes
Joe Biden is Catholic... And crap like this is one of the reasons I no longer am....
With a mindless and ignorant statement criticizing Biden’s pick of Harris as running mate, Tom KKKotton demonstrates his bigotry and incompetence.
Pro-Life vs. Pro-Abortion is a clear choice for America this November. Biden has officially made clear he will not be moderate in his selection of nominees, Harris is radical about abortion.  and Pence are unquestionably the most Pro-Life pick. #Vote
It just doesn't make sense (even if it was just meant as sick burn on Biden), since there wouldn't have been a Catholic on the ticket in 08 and 12 either. And 92, 96, and 00 were also RC-free zones. Bizarre.
How Biden selected Kamala Harris as his running mate
Ummm...Joe Biden blew it for himself, he needs no help for anyone
not voting for joe biden is a vote for trump. idgaf what you say. refusing to not vote for biden bcuz he isn’t bernie is selfish. you might as well be a trump supporter. #BidenHarris2020
doesn’t report the news... therefore Chief’s of No News.  Listened them again today for nearly 2 hours. Zilch about BLM, riots, looting, Seattle, Chicago, NY, Portland, shooting  The White House...only protection of virus fear, Biden and hate of Trump. That’s it!
We believe in Biden-Harris 2020. Let’s kick ass together!
Biden was not my choice. I have really struggled feeling excited about the campaign until now.
I’m so excited!!! More so than with Biden.
Joe biden injecting his dead son as one of the reasons he picked the kneeler is a disgrace
Another historical moment....Kamala Harris is Biden’s VP Pick #HBCUMade #ifeelseen 👩🏾 #vote2020 🗳
Top political voices react to Biden picking Kamala Harris as running mate
Let’s be real man Biden had absolutely NOTHING to do with picking Harris
Joe Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
When I cast my vote in Arkansas for Biden instead of Warren while she is running, that was my exact thought. This is about saving the country....
No thanks. Enjoying the Biden/Harris ticket instead.
Molly are you as confident in a Biden/Trump debate?
Joe Biden did not select her...the Democratic Party did it got him for the reasons you gave and others.
Kamala Harris will be the first Black woman nominated for vice president by a major party. 🎊
If Joe Biden is elected we will have our first female President in Kamala Harris.
Harris Biden ticket has 3 votes from this family!   My republican husband is all in for Biden/Harris!
#BREAKING Joe Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
I'm ready!  Let's get to it! Biden/Harris 2020
Biden when he was told who his VP pick was
I guess you don't understand Commnism, Marxism.....you will have no freedoms honey when the Democrats get in. Can you list us 10 things Biden has done in the last 40+years....I am waiting...
My entertainment as I drive today? I listened to  for over an hour.  They all LOVE BIDEN and the virus. Can’t believe these people are Americans. I listened &gt; an hour, not one word mentioned about Black Lives Matter, rioting, looting, vandalism, Chicago nor Seattle.
I'm tired of people thinking joe biden will make things better.
Who do YOU think will be Biden's VP?

Oh also.  Does anyone else have about 5 different T-shirt’s waiting in your #Amazon acct ready to order?  Biden/Harris. Biden/rice. Biden/warren Biden/duckworth    Please tell me I’m not the only one #bidenvppick #BidenVPwatch
The debate has been won when I pointed out that Trump and his cultists’ irresponsibility are what are causing the virus to spread and kill. Nobody is dying from Joe Biden’s decision making, just Trump’s.
Breaking: Baby Nut to be announced as Biden's running mate
He NEVER said that!  Open your eyes and ears!  A vote for Biden is to kill America.
Biden Tells Staffers To Pick Any Black Person For VP 'Since They All Think The Same Anyway' | The Babylon Bee
"Biden has permitted his League of Mediocre White Men to run around dinging up a group of trailblazing female politicians, most of them Black, all of whom have plied paths unimaginably more challenging than any taken by these men." --Rebecca Traister
Biden trying to put words in order to tweet this
Ben Sasse wants to help the democrats and biden, I wonder what the democrats have on him
Looking forward to Biden’s VP pick this week!
You made the point of why it’s important. Biden riding his bike while Trump struggles to walk show Biden is in far better “condition.”Just like our economy, country and military will be once we #FireTrump Nov. 3.
Biden is.....
I’m pretty sure Shaun has told people not to vote for Biden on here before. I’d look it up, but he blocked me, so I can’t see any of his tweets anymore :(
I agree. Pelosi, Schumer, Biden should be running ads talking about the Social Security debacle in plain English.  —no more Mr. Nice Guy on this issue.   get off the damn political shows. Get Congressional Dems  on local news!
Hahaha can you imagine Joe Biden coming out in clown shoes?
just finished watching 2016 debate with Killary. Prophetic looking at your achievements the past 4 yrs. Excellence! Coaches watch game films in preparation for battle. As you prepare 4 election reflect &amp; enjoy!  We r behind you, hit Biden hard, if not harder!
Blacks for Trump. Women for Trump. Latinos for Trump. Trump is so polarizing and sexist and racist that the pro-Trump minority factions have to have labels to make it sound like they have some significant movement.  Meanwhile, it’s just People for Biden.
Everything about Biden concerns me.
Yep....anybody for Biden abortion-killing is LOST
Come on, man!  Even Biden doesn't speak Biden! 🤣
This won’t affect people already on SS -on the off chance anything even happens on this -if he messes with it permanently then people like me won’t have SS when I’m FRA. But don’t stress. My mom already called me and was freakin out.On a positive she’s voting for Biden now
Looking forward to when Biden uses E.O.’s to demand Germany and Japan unconditionally surrender and he can finally claim victory for WWII.
Explain how this will work #MoscowMitch should I not deduct withholding from payroll this week? I’m glad the leaderless GOP is now on board with deficits and EO. It’ll make Biden’s job easier cleaning up your mess.
While u were off gallivanting, Trump has attempted to neuter your congressional powers. I guess u are fine with Biden doing the same in 6 months. U reap what u sow Tommy.

Me in 2019: I hope we don’t pick Biden... I want someone I’m really excited about! (someone like   or   Me in 2020: OK... fine... Biden. I’m so exhausted... let’s just be done with this.
Biden might be mentally declining, but he had something to start with. The current leader is declining from basically nothing. I trust Biden will also surround himself with professionals with knowledge, unlike now.
Oh but if someone said something about Biden supporters like this, it would be a hate crime
Biden ....NEVER.
Biden is a liar.
Yes, I know that your screenshot is an article that doesn’t exist. If you want to see the Twilight Zone, produce an actual Biden article by “jeffiretruck
Trump War Room - Text TRUMP to 88022 on Twitter: "Uhh... did Joe Biden just say that Black people are all the same?  / Twitter
If you vote for Joe Biden, “You ain’t black.”
Everyone in this feed that says the left isn’t trying to take guns.   Yes they are.   You know it, you just can’t say it like your Boy Beto did.  Now Biden has said he will put Beto in charge of gun control.  His stance is hell yeah we’re gonna take em
Will Biden’s handler please remove him from this and just pick someone else to run against Trump.   You know how hard it is to make Bernie look like he has all his Stuff together?  Well that’s Biden.
I think Biden‘s comment is what the DNC has thought for hundreds of years … Which clearly they know nothing‼️‼️
Well it’s Biden or Trump lol
