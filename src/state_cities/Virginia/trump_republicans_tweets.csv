Pokemon Go to the polls lost Hillary Clinton the election and led us to Donald Trump
I just voted to stop the Justice Department from using any federal funds for the Trump Administration‚Äôs lawsuit to strike down the Affordable Care Act.  I came to Congress to #ProtectOurCare and that's exactly what I'll keep doing.
Yea I‚Äôll be voting to keep trump Sen Harris
You should have long ago stopped caring what Donald Trump tweets or says. He has no filter, he has no coherent worldview, and he also loves to troll his opponents. Get used to it, children.  His ACTIONS matter.
Trump seeking to postpone the 2020 election is admitting he is afraid of competition #Election2020 #runningscared
tRump and hannity. How many web pages aren‚Äôt loading here?
Carolyn, you want to read this. It is a transcript from Faux News. Hannity and tRump. Now tell me that tRump I‚Äôd more mentally fit than Biden.
No one had to put a stop to it Trump was just beating the Democrats
Looking at the makeup of this court it's a little scary 3 Clinton 4 Obama 2 bush + 2 Trump appointees on this court
President Trump says something mainstream media changes the quote and that all of sudden becomes fact
It is most certainly not out of Donald Trump's character to start a nuclear war out of spite.
Because they afraid it works and less people will die and that is exactly what they want.  They think if more people die less chances for Trump to win.  he will win in a landslide anyway.
Believe me Donald Trump knows he can't move the election without Congress okay and they won't do it because they're not smart enough to understand what the Constitution says so all he is doing is baiting the Democrats and they took it Hook Line &amp; Sinker
All in for Trump!!!  I see Trump as a mix of Andrew Jackson and Ronald Reagan üòÄ
Absolutely wrong.  Do not EVER ignore tRump.  Federal and state authorities need to swiftly and congruently apprehend, prosecute, and jail this man for his crimes against our country.  Period.
Trump floats idea of delaying the November election, a power granted to Congress, as he ramps up attacks on voting by mail
He kills friends/enemies/acquaintances with his failure. Wonder if his voters know they don't even rank on that list and are just fodder. Trump news ‚Äì live: President calls for 2020 election to be delayed as his ally Herman Cain dies
Thanks Jim for making a quick, ridiculous response to this. Trump says things like this to get the conversation started nationally so it becomes a hot topic. If it becomes popular enough, maybe congress will do something about it. Think before reacting
Hey dummy.  It appears your blind loyalty to that orangutan in the WH caused you to write a stupid opinion piece trashing Biden.  "Crossed a line"  Well, tRump crossed that line himself today.  Will look for your redaction ASAP.  kthnx
tRump just tweeted the possibility of delaying the election.  WTF?
i don't know who needs to hear this but...  I've just become aware that racists/trump supporters are creating Twitter accounts using Black people as their pfps with random Caucasian names for handles.  All I'm saying is... Bot or not, that fact makes me incredibly uncomfortable.
When asked about the reports &amp; intelligence that Russia had placed bounties on American soldiers?  Trump: "That's an issue that many people say is fake news."  He then talks about Chinese and Indian soldiers killed in a border skirmish, saying no one told him about the bounties.
Because Trump will get the credit for the cure!
If these people don't talk to friends, pollsters, or the media, then tell us how you can possibly know:   1) that they exist 2) that they're a majority 3) what they intend to do  I want to believe you, but I need solid reasons.
Let's not forget we ACTUALLY live in a Corporate Oligarchy and this history could prove catastrophic to Fox's future viability, once they country gets rid of this plague we call Trump and his cronies aka the GOP.
Thank you  - Trump continues to write  and  campaign ads so effectively!
This. 45 prefers a Doctor who believes in Demons and witchcraft over #fauci on Covid treatment. I‚Äôll say that again Demons and witchcraft over science.
They did not get there because he got things under control.  Whom should we have listened to? Trump???  Look how many he has killed in the mean time.  It is all on Trump.  Look at the Republican governors now and what are they doing?  Just what Northam did. Worse, look South.
I'm picturing a scene of Donald Trump's final moments that's just like the opening of CITIZEN KANE, except he's in a prison cell, and instead of dropping a snow globe he drops a "Greetings From Florida" postcard as he utters his last words: "Boat parade."

I can't wait for the  ad about Bill Barr lying about knowing about Trump's dumb tweets. And the Kush.
I heard that a long time ago when President Trump invited the people‚Äôs nation to the white house! Great job president Trump !
Because of Trump‚Äôs inability to lead, my children will miss at least a year of in-person schooling. What the actual hell.
Another day, another moment for  to show what a delusional, gullible fool he really is. It's both sad &amp; hilarious when someone has been brainwashed by F√ºhrer Trump.

Trump has told 25K lies. That‚Äôs insane. Cannot believe anything he says ever. Lies. Lies. Lies.
The #DNC is deciding platform - and understandably upsetting most progressives. I‚Äôm not sure, but I think the strategy is to be as middle of the road as possible to remove Trump - if he‚Äôs not- nothing progressive gets past the Supreme Court for generation.
What if Trump loses but refuses to leave office? Here's the worst-case scenario | US elections 2020 | The Guardian -
The DNC couldn‚Äôt find its ass with both hands. As soon as we get Trump out, we need to reform the party.
3rd trimester abortion. Are you for or against?  Is Jesus forbor against?  Are you inaign with Jesus?  Trump is against abortion.
Prob not. Nice guy, and a great VP for trump but that‚Äôs about it.
Remember this just means Trump is going to up the lies and attacks and use of divisive hateful tactics
Like, I'm sure it will look nice and all but they really picked the worst time to do this.  How will you defend that the right idea rn during a growing pandemic and record unemployment is to revamp the garden w/ taxpayer money.  They had 3 other years.

Right on the money "My main doubt about the current polling is that Trump is basically running against a candidate named 'Not Trump,'" says Bret Stephens. "Eventually he's going to have to become more visible, and that‚Äôs when the polls will really start to count."
excellent article in Wash Times 7/27/20. White GUILT elected Marxist BHO and it is rampant in USA now aided by Soros and his henchmen. If TRUMP is not elected our way of life as we know it will be lost.
Thanks for speaking up thanks for standing up God Bless America re-elect Donald Trump
That's fantastic. Donald Trump's only problem with the election will be election fraud and mail-in ballots
This is the best message we can put out there everyday after reelect Donald Trump
The right needs to let the people in Chicago know that we are the ones locking up the criminals not the left. Left the Sheltering the criminals the right is getting them off the streets. The real Donald Trump second term
‚ÄúSupporting Trump doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm racist.‚Äù Smh.
I do like the use of foreshadowing. See how he included the keys to Trump's jail cell on the desk, right next to his arrest warrant, and a copy of 'The Art of the Deal' that he'll take with him to prison?
Powerful piece by  "Now the faux populism of the Republican Party is about to give way to the real populism of angry and vengeful Democrats. And by all appearances, the Wall Street wiseguys don‚Äôt have a clue about what‚Äôs coming their way."
This is 100% posturing for a 2024 Republican primary. Hawley only has to act on this pledge if Trump is re-elected.
This is what Trump supports.
Literally the only difference between these two are that Trump isn't "cordial" and doesn't act "Presidential". They both still are and have cabinets full of war Hawks, shit trickle down economic theorists, and scapegoat minorities with the drug war.
Well... the Trump haters follow Trump, so they can up to date on his insane rambling lies. That‚Äôs why he has so many.
But the taxpayers have to pay for F√ºhrer Trump to golf.
This is the creation of Donald Trump
Is that supposed to be Reagan to Trump's front right? If so, it is funny because the Reagan library just sent the campaign a demand to stop using his image in its campaign ads.

Donald Trump is primarily, if not exclusively, a marketing man. He doesn't build things or solve problems, he convinces people of things.
But tRump didn‚Äôt change his tune. Til recently he has been downplaying the virus. When the south started to surge he got concerned. The man doesn‚Äôt have a clue.
I hope that Mary Trump will soon get mental help she needs
A vote for a third party is a vote for Trump.  You can tell yourself whatever you need to be able to sleep at night, but it is an abdication of responsibility, not an exercise of it.  We do not have a parliamentary system in America. The time for protest votes is the primary.
He was killed for views that didn‚Äôt match what some think every black person should believe. He was his own person of Integrity.             Respected Milwaukee community figure, Trump and Black Lives Matter supporter, fatally shot in front of own store

NOVEMBER THIRD IS THE DAY WE FIRE DONALD TRUMP
That‚Äôs the BLM and the progressive liberal America!! Vote Trump in Nov or we‚Äôll endure that kind of madness for years, that and over taxation for social welfare programs so people won‚Äôt have to work!!!
Thank you Donald Trump for being a president America would have been lost without you you will win the next election perhaps for years without having to fight fraud from the FBI and doj CIA you will be able to get done the thing if you want it to and the things we elected you to
That the Trump campaign is currently spending advertising dollars in sapphire blue Oregon instead of...you know...actual battleground states...tells you all you need to know about the Trump Campaign.
Could tRump repeat 5 random words. Not 5 he picked out of his ass as an example. Especially 5 words related to the situation he was in.
jim palmer and donald trump are the same age. one of them looks a lot better than the other. sounds a lot more lucid, too.
needs to walk these streets like she did crowded streets of Chinatown in March to show the world China was no threat. While Trump was shutting down air travel from China as she blasted his action. She‚Äôs a traitor to USA, violates her oath of office every day.
indeed and  nailed that reality long before most. Dems through their lap dog media tried to shut him down.  &amp; comrades called him a conspiracy theorist.Where were Republican leaders at that time? Asleep at the wheel while Trump tried to shut down China.
I would have said Trump for sure but I haven't seen him tweet about Fauci's pitch so who knows
I will vote for real Donald Trump as soon as early voting opens up in Virginia
Ummm..it is happening now under Trump.  Plus, stop spreading lies. Liar.
And you can be certain that the Trump organization is getting a kickback on their highly inflated, no-bid contract.
Seeing this, I'm reminded that Billy Bush got "canceled" for 3 years for his comparatively minor role in this while Trump got elected President.
Barbara was so fierce! Trump hasn‚Äôt changed a bit....he just talks slowerüòÇ
Listening to the Trump recital his tell is how more excited he gets when he moves past person and woman and gets to his faves - men, cameras and TV.

She is a Chinese surrogate a long with Chuck Schumer these people will do anything to keep Trump out even selling out our country to a Communist Party
Using the Trump virus slogan is simply an easy way for Nancy Pelosi to back China

You know who isn't going to school in person in the fall? Trump's school age soon
I sincerely hope  does not have grandparents that she can relate to tRump. If that were the case we all need to express empathy for her.
It‚Äôs all about hating Trump by any means. They are beyond sick. They are reaponsible for death of innocents, even children. Someday they will have to stand before their maker.
Now I see why Trump is a hit with the ladies.  So subtle.
What a typical dick Trump move
Does that mean everything is going according to plan??  So maybe Trump isn't doing that bad.
This is how you get 4 more years of Trump.  You've learned nothing.
Burger King Trump grills up another Big whopper!
An MSNBC Report stated yesterday that virtually all donations to Donald Trump's campaign end up purchasing merchandise and services from his own companies enriching him even more.
üôÑ at least Trump is not a politician and loves this country unlike the other two!
President Trump is correct this should not be tolerated in a Nemo ratio country to allow a small vocal minority to force their agenda on the majority law abiding citizens the politicians in these cities should be ashamed of themselves
The title of this article shouldn't be " ignores house ethics rules".  It should be: "Matt Gaetz used taxpayer dollars to hire a guy fired from the Trump Admin for attending a white supremacy event".

But you didn‚Äôt address that. You were referencing the ol‚Äô locker room talk. Not tRumps sexual predation. Men‚Äôs dirty talk has nothing to do with tRump raping a woman.
He‚Äôs not there because then the press will spend all their time trying to pit fauci and birx against him to suggest they are all in disagreement and trump not ‚Äúfollowing the science.‚Äù
Yes tRump dropped the ball. Completely, and that‚Äôs what matters. What Cuomo did or didnt do does not affect me.
What does this have to do with tRump being a sexual predator. Way to try to avoid that subject.
If it were ‚Äúsome woman‚Äù that would be one thing, but loads of women have complained of tRump‚Äôs actions. And we have heard him say he can just grab ‚Äòem by the üçë
That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs always been, just politics. Need to get back to lobbyists and contractors and old cronies. Trump was not part of that and the swamp has suffered.
You seem to have a rather unhealthy obsession with defending tRump against the sexual accusations he has had levied. Why would you die on this hill? Defending perverts is not a good look.
Why is tRump fighting to not provide DNA for Carroll‚Äôs  complaint? If it would clear him he‚Äôd jump on that.
The virus was not in Chinatown. It is not something that is resident in people of Chines ancestry. Visiting Chinatown at the Lunar New Year would not have exposed you to the virus. You‚Äôre an asshole if you simply equate China and virus like tRump.
Ask me who I'm voting for and I will tell you Donald Trump when you start asking about why I'm going to vote for Donald Trump I figure you just went stupid if you can't figure that out on your own and I stopped answering the polls

Trump / Pompeo = Hitler / Ribbentrop  They will go down in eternal shame.
the post-Trump era will be extremely noisy with these folks spending a lot of time/effort claiming they never really supported him (this will go on for years) ... they will point to their silence during his time in office as evidence for that
That's the most critical flaw for Trump actually  Presidents aren't Kings. Biden will (actually) surround himself with experienced, great people. Maybe we'll listen to scientists, economists, military leaders, epidemiologists...
Google him.  Watch him actually talk, not videos from Trump's Campaign.    He stumbles over his words from time to time but doesn't sound like a dude with dementia to me. I'd be worried more about a guy who is impressed with Person Woman Man Camera TV
Susan collins may raise two eyebrows on the one
Totally agreed. Trump is not a normal R. He's a threat to the basically all our norms, Liberal Democracy, the Pax Americana, more.  Normal R's are like Normal Dems, wrong sometimes but not wholly corrupt, ignorant and selfish

Social media will be de facto nationalized by the end of Trump's second term.  It begins with this:

The question for me is this: Putting another dent in the 2-party system is good for the long-term future.  Elected Trump again is (probably) good for the short-term.  My concern is that short-term thinking based on fear has put us in a quagmire of cycling Rs and Ds.
I guess we will all find out how many overtly racist policy nuggets team trump-miller can roll out between now and november. yesterday they ignore supreme court order on DACA. today they gut low income housing. tomorrow...

he praised trumps wall, hated Mexicans but you think he wasn't a trump supporter? okay buddy

Excuse me, this is Trump's America.
Bret, I normally agree with you, but we already have evidence that they aren't doing enforcing the law in a constitutional way, ask yourself based on the last few years what you know about the Trump administration . At best this meant to provoke more violence
.Trump rules: 1. He cannot be wrong 2. Revenge, even if no slight.3. Meanness. It shows absolute power. It‚Äôs fun.4. Lies r a must to twist narrative &amp; paramount to his reality. 5.There is no strategy except to ‚Äúwin‚Äù.This is reason he needs to constantly lie bc nothing is coherent
Trump is not smart. He is slightly dumb, but merciless and manipulative. His manipulation is powerful but not clever. Trump theme-it is all about him anything to benefit him goes. traitorous behavior is ok if it benefits him.
you really don‚Äôt have to retweet Trump, do you?
You should see the protests in Khabarovsk, Russia. These people want change, too. These Russians are sick of Putin.   They want Putin OUT just like we want the Hitler-wannabe Trump OUT.   These heinous tyrants will soon crumble. We must continue to do our part.

Just another example of Trump‚Äôs rapid mental decline. It‚Äôs discusting that Republicans want to vote a man with severe dementia into office just to push a political agenda! #ismelldementia #trumpissenile #biden2020
This is happening, solely, because trump sent in federal agents to arrest people, for literally no reason other than he‚Äôs a fascist and likes to see people suffer
Fixed it:              It is a new low for Trump to refer to the China  Virus.He didn‚Äôt require masks ever  &amp; imposed the Racist China travel ban.The only one to blame for this virus is Trump. Many have died. We should be unified on that front not playing political games with it.
I mean, trump didn‚Äôt starvation march the native Americans like Jackson, but he is locking children in cages at the border so it ain‚Äôt much better

Hey, Washington Post, if "Democracy Dies in Darkness" you guys need to turn the lights on. Demand Donald Trump resign. Enough already!
You are a monster for supporting Trump and letting him get by with all stunts he does. You should resign or be removed Lady G.
My extended family is a bunch of Trump supporters and apparently anti-maskers now too and I called a cousin out on it yesterday and she and a bunch of the rest of the family got mad about it and decided I'm a petulant little shit with no respect for anybody or something
RNC server hack. They're all compromised and Trump has the "goods" on all of them.
Ha! Maybe John Oliver is up to his old antics?President Trump‚Äôs suggestion that the election be delayed is not only dangerous (because it reveals his authoritarian impulses) and ineffectual (he has no constitutional power to change the date), it perpetuates a great untruth that undermines public...

Whatever happens with the results, Trump's term ends on Jan. 20 unless he wins re-election. That's in the Constitution. So if they want to bring lawsuits and drag this out, say hello to President Pelosi.

Sure. The problem is that Barr will LIE about it, just like he lied about the Mueller report and the fact that it found that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, Trump welcomed it, lied about it and obstructed the investigation into it.  THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
Oh, come on. You KNOW the impetus and motives are not the same.  This is not a ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù moment. Trump, at a minimum, is trying to poison the well by building a fraud narrative. He knows 40% of the country will fall for it, further dividing the country/undermining democracy.

Jonathan, Trump isn‚Äôt ‚Äúpushing‚Äù anything. He thinks with his mouth open, and often with his foot in it. If everything you did in a day was recorded, I‚Äôd bet I could find some fun things to share as well.
We're not rooting for the virus, we're begging for a competent, federal response that would save lives. Something Trump has proven he is utterly incapable of leading.
Trump isn't bright enough to troll anyone.
Does President Trump look racist?
Agreed. As in many things with Trump, I think this is a negotiating tactic. Stake out an extreme position, concede down to what you wanted in the first place.

Make no mistake, Democrats WILL STEAL this election if at all possible. They know they have no earthly chance of winning it against Trump. No agenda, anti-America and anti-white.
I figured August 1 was the date   would choose to abandon Trump after 4 years of bootlicking to try to save their worthless carcasses. I think its too late for you, enjoy the trash heap of history.
I don't know. He could have NOT GOTTEN BORED BY IT, and tried leading the nation. Here's a list I put together months ago of things Trump COULD have done. It has only grown since then.
What did Trump do?
Praise Trump! Praise him and his love! I would die for the Great Leader! I died in Tulsa, I died in Ohio, I died in Miami! I died for him! He gave me salvation, he protected Capitalism! I let my kids die for the Great Leader! I saw Herman Cain die for the Great Leader! Praise!
Well according to  he‚Äôs NOT responsible for Herman Cain‚Äôs death. Cain after all signed a waiver agreeing that #Trump would not be blamed if he caught COVID from the Tulsa rally.
The dates of federal elections are set by Congress, and the Constitution makes no provisions for a delay to the Jan. 20, 2021 presidential inauguration.
Facebook has repeatedly refused to hold Donald Trump to any sort of standard on its platform. It's time for federal regulators to investigate #Facebook and act!
Plus the news about Herman Cain will NOT help #Trump‚Äôs mood today. Baby Huey is gonna be extra pissy.
But an old man with dementia and who acts creepy is just not an adequate candidate for presidency. If a more sharp candidate was running then maybe trump wouldn‚Äôt win this year
I think he's trolling. Now it'll be all over the news all day. He knows he can't delay it, he also knows that the left will view (it has been reported) that he may try and delay it. I think he's playing into that just ..   shrug.. cause Trump is Trump. lol Troll in Chief.

Trump suggests delaying 2020 election
That's why the United States is the ONLY developed nation IN THE WORLD seeing these kinds of numbers? Trump may not accept any responsibility for anything that happens while he's president, but leadership ‚Äî¬†or the utter lack of it ‚Äî matters.
CV19 already earned  and Trump decided called that hoax. Well, he asked for it.
When protests are directed at the destruction of federal property, there may be a federal response. I don‚Äôt agree with what Trump did. I also don‚Äôt agree with a governor who makes no attempt to control the riots. These are NOT peaceful protests
Who‚Äôs own right now? It‚Äôs not about future or past. I‚Äôm speaking of now, trump administration are R, senate are majority R.... and go on... you can‚Äôt point at dems or R so bottom line, it‚Äôs pretty much it‚Äôs on R as right now.
Sadly, that great cost was wasted, totally wasted, because of Trump's abdication of any leadership. All we bought was time ‚Äî time that wasn't put to any good use. Now we're just as bad off as we were with the virus, with a shattered economy to boot.
#AGBillBarr intentionally obfuscated the condemning findings of the #MuellerReport to spare  from the ramifications of accepting #ForeignAssistance in 2016. ‚Äú#ObamaGate‚Äù is #Trump‚Äôs üêÇüí© excuse for his campaign team getting rolled up in the legit investigation.

All that hair dye must have eaten through...Trump does not have that kind of p-o-w-e-r.
Then why are you on her case when she says Joe Biden will increase our premiums? She's not helping Trump when she points out Joe Biden doesn't plan on doing anything about our healthcare system even in the middle of a pandemic.
Yeah, sure. But wait till Trump gets a hold of that sharpie for the forecast track ;-)
Thank Goodness she is nothing like her mom, pretty she can change at some point, after all Kellyanne had criticized Trump a couple of times.

The new USPS postmaster inspector general Louis Dejoy(major Trump donor) will cause delays by eliminating over time, stopping late mail trips, and any mail not delivered that day will be sent out next day or days. This will only increase fraud narrative.
Republicans are in a dark and racist place with trump supporters carrying guns and ak47 in Michigan talking about hanging and shooting ppl! White privileged has no ideal they are wrong ! But trump don‚Äôt care ! Vote this troll out!

Trump thinks he can moved the election!! No he cant!! Congress provides any similar power to the President or other federal officials to change this date outside of Congress‚Äôs regular legislative process,‚Äù

President Trump on Thursday floated the idea of delaying the 2020 election after making  unsubstantiated allegations that increased mail-in voting will result in fraud.   There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud through mail-in voting.

.....and? There's a thing called #Covid19 that's going around. In most cases, State Gov't has STOPPED all people from working and doing businesses. If State Gov's are forcing people to STOP working, how is it Trump's fault?   Think about that, Einstein.

Trumped up to deflect.
...in the pockets of billionaires. Who do you think would be immediately affected? Not the  people living their ‚Äúsuburban lifestyle dream.‚Äù Until it does. It is clear that trump, and people that support him have their favorite Americans and 0 empathy for anyone else.
Did you know that Central Park used to be a Black neighborhood? Check Anniston, AL. That‚Äôs a fun one. Because thats the kind of shit that trump wants to bring back. The deregulation of industrial pollutions, pretending to ‚Äúsave jobs‚Äù while killing Americans and putting money...
And White people came in and burned it down. Some even dropped bombs from private planes. This is where trump chose to hold his rally.
Can you tell me why he was banned, please? And also, you know that trump had his own jets and helicopters? Just a thought.

It‚Äôs been the Trump Pandemic since he dismantled the White House pandemic readiness/response team, denied its existence, called it Asian Flu &amp; a Democratic Hoax b4 it reached our shores, cut CDC Budget &amp; shafted the WHO.This clusterfuck is  debris field.
I would not spend a dime on this criminal who is fighting to stay out of prison for decades of corruption! Law &amp; Order = Trump 2020!!
This is a war from the left! They are trying to defend the corruption at all cost because they fear law and order!!! Trump 2020!
And interviewing Trump is a whole different beast... do you stop him and press and issue or let him keep talking bc he often talks his way into bigger reveals!
Can we just admit that Vladmir Putin is Trump‚Äôs real National Security Advisor? How can self respecting conservatives keep turning a blind eye to this?
Wow trump might as well resign after this one. You really got em man üòë
You'll love this article, it's full of Trump bashing and bashing of his supporters...and some inconvenient facts.
Claiming that he didn‚Äôt know the tweet where trump said stone had ‚Äúguts‚Äù because he doesn‚Äôt read tweets but that tweet was actually in the Mueller report. So he lied because he supposedly read the report. Unless he lied about that too.
Give to the Trump's campaign and you to can be somebody in a defunct administration.
And what exactly are the Democrats doing to make the world a better place if they defeat Trump? What comes next afterwards? What are they going to do to make our lives better?
For years people have been wondering what would happen if Trump simply ignored the Supreme Court's ruling(s). I guess we're about to find out.
I would think at least a few of those people would realize their vote helped push trump over the top.
I like trump.

No you stop. Maybe in your world people are crouching in the corner scared, but I'm seeing people in clubs, pool parties, popping bottles taking flights and turning up.  Dude people only care about Covid on Twitter and to call Trump a dumbass
Because masks protect other people not yourself, it can get in through your eyes as well, masks are to protect others   Also trump is stubborn and won't let the media tell him what to do, so at least he isn't a push over

We need a leader now dammit !!  Trump why are yiu pure out false rhetoric!!! Nothing is clear with over 150,000 our my Americans dead! Tears
There is none. The fact that Trump tweeted that shit like he did something majestic really has me floored.
Ok...this is my last tweet about race for 72 hours. I need to think about other things.  But that Trump tweet was a surefire political #dogwhistle.
This is worth a watch...  A democrat who supports President Trump‚Äôs policies letting MSNBC hosts have a taste of their despicable behavior.
Agree, 'Trump' republicans will identify a Republicans.   People who used to be Republicans but are not now due to reasons (trump or other)  aren't going to say they're democrats, they're going to identify as independents.

#hydroxychloroquine   One of many studies showing the same positive results.  Stop refusing to acknowledge this and start saving lives!
You Trump supporters fall for the old snake oil salesmen on a regular basis. Keep injecting the bleach...
Thank you for this! I hope Dave reads it. It's all the Trump admin has ever asked for in the cities and states where this is going down: Protect your people. Do your jobs!
You do realize that trump cant just make states go into lockdowns....that would be fascism, blame the states for not taking care of themselves
#hydroxycholoroquine   Why isn't this considered proof that this works?  Only because the left has decided it doesn't because Trump thinks it does. Pitiful for the American people who have died already.
But in no way the personal attorney Barr has become for Trump.
It will never be adequately maintained while  is in office, nor will the CDC, NHS, or WHO be supported/prepared. IMNSHO, Trump owns every single COVID-19 death, the suffering of every survivor ravaged by after effects, suffering of loved ones, the economic crisis
Not one red cent in the stimulus package for the FBI building. To affirm this would make u an accomplice to Trump‚Äôs corruption.

We Lost the Battle for the Republican Party‚Äôs Soul Long Ago
3-it's unlikely that all of those voters stick with Trump in 2020 or that we see 136k less voters than in 2012. MI's 2018 gubernatorial election had 4.2m votes cast (3m for Gov 2014, 4.5m in 16). Gov Whitmer had exactly 2k less votes than Clinton. I'm nervous, but confident
2-take away the 136k votes that disappeared (and assume that they ALL voted for Obama in 2012), and that means the delta between Obama and Trump's victories is around 350k. So either GOP was extra energized (no evidence), or ~350k voters voted for Trump who voted for Obama in 12.
1-He needs more than 15k in Detroit to not vote. Both candidates received 7k less votes than their party candidate in Oakland Co in 2016 v 2012. Wayne Co was 60k less and MI cast 136k less total votes. The vote shifted nearly 500k, total, to Trump from Obama (who won MI by 450k)
This, as much as anything, may decide the election.  via

Oh no, you can't look up the name of the officer who is defending federal property with patches that say he is police and is apart of a federal agency, must be secret forces hired by trump, also from the picture you sent,  not an occupying force they are on federal propertyüòëü§®

Best part is the FBI building is so they don't move. If they did move to a different location, a hotel is speculated to take its lot, which would be a direct competition to Trump's hotel there.   But the right doesn't give a shit about corruption or anything like that so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Um, duh? Why would anyone expect anything different? Trump wants to spin the data into ‚Äúit‚Äôs disappearing‚Äù. See? It‚Äôs gone. No more cases; just look at the numbers.
Trump ended the press conference with aplomb once the news reporter woman asked if alien DNA was being used in the COVID19 vaccine
Obama did fuck up the country in 2009 with the H1N1 flu.  He waited 6 months to declare it a pandemic.  Trump stopped incoming travel from infected China almost immediately and the left said he was stupid for doing that. Can't have it both ways.
Fauci is an insult to most doctors. His liberal left agenda is well-served by being the "expert" on covid-19.  Why does social media shut down all the videos of real doctors who say it's a lot of hype to destroy Trump? Truth hurts.
This is a Trump tour de force
I‚Äôm 67 and he‚Äôs definitely the most hated president in my lifetime. I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs bothering him. I recently viewed the video of Trump being booed at a Yankees game. He visibly winced. Our disapproval is getting through. Unfortunately, it hasn‚Äôt moved him to do his job.
probably more of the same.  democrats gonna go full on batshit crazy when Trump wins again
Because it‚Äôs misleading and dangerous, you should be ashamed of yourself, you and Trump.
Almost wished you, trump, and deathsantis took COVID seriously and stopped the spread?
So a trump is actually calling someone else, truly horrible?  I have no words.
Great üëç job Mr President üëè üëç Trump
This drug could literally save the life of a Democrat and they would still slam Trump for endorsing it.

Trump needs to take responsibility for his failed administration and stop trying to keep blaming oboma for the failures of his inept administration
Their motive was clear..sole reason for this hearing was to stage &amp; pump up their detestation for Trump &amp; his defeat &amp; to try &amp; demoralize AG Barr. How many times did we hear ‚ÄúI reclaim my time, Sir‚Äù, what a joke!
Firer and kick all of trump ppl out and disingenuous Barr at the top first!  Oh yea and disinfected everything and everybody!  The stinch!!
So now it turns out the mail is not being delivered like it always has all throughout  all of Hampton Rhodes. Trump is interfering with postal systems and interfering  with mail dilivery. ALARM ALARM .
Here's where we are today, July 28th, 2020.  Imagine where we'll be if Trump doesn't rein-in Fauci and/or Biden wins.

Bill Barr's willingness to do Trump's bidding should concern every single person who cares about the integrity of democracy in America. The AG's job is not to be the president's right-hand man.
Why should he worry about that?  Trump will be re-elected. You have no idea of his support everywhere.  #Trump2020Landslide
I'm one of those.   Sure, I had other candidates in mind, but anything is better than #CadetBoneSpurs  and I feel like biden will be very capable of at a MINIMUM undoing a bunch of the illegal bullshit trump did and help pass legislation protecting democracy.
More like so they can do EXACTLY what they've been doing, blaming Trump for the cases/deaths as preelection propaganda. NONE of which are his fault. #Trump2020LandslideVictory
I think he lied about discussions with Trump.
No I‚Äôm sick of Northam! He had a chance to do for us what Cuomo did for New York because he is a ‚Äúmedical profession‚Äù him and fauci really pissed me off bc they didn‚Äôt have the balls to stand firm and bow down to Trump
A small federal agency focused on preventing industrial disasters is on life support. Trump wants it gone.
Media would prefer folks die than Trump get any credit. Sad and pathetic
You are right.  "Biden shouldn't throw Trump a lifeline by granting him any debates". That's a losing proposition for Biden, and he (well, his handlers) damn well know it. #Trump2020
Russian bounties on Americans? Trump/Putin friends?
He's f***ing stupid . Has he thought about the house partys or the covid 19 partys . What does the restaurants have to do with it if people are social distancing . A damn fruit cake just like TRUMP

Outrageous!  Everything Trump and Republicans do is outrageous! During a pandemic that they made much, much worse, they continue to do all they can to hurt Americans and enrich Trump and themselves!üë†

As much as you want to convince me a Joe Biden presidency is better than 4 more years of Trump, we'll be stuck in the same situation in terms of healthcare. Both of them want to keep this barbaric system that is tied to our employment as we're seeing record number unemployment.

I think the sad part happens to be your weird belief that anything is wrong with him. I mean, I get it, Trump has absolutely no redeeming qualities and the intellectual fortitude of a gnat. So this is your only play, I truly understand. :)
Obama was a petty race-hustler who did his best to sow division and discord.   Obama use the IRS as weapons against conservatives and the FBI, FISA court and DOJ against Trump campaign and later incoming presidency.  Obama is the corrupt president in U.S. history.

And as far as I'm concerned, the American people will suffer no matter who wins, and there's no amount of shamming coming from you that will change that unfortunate reality. Biden or Trump, people will die from a lack of healthcare access.
All that hair dye must have eaten through...Trump does not have that kind of p-o-w-e-r.
Then why are you on her case when she says Joe Biden will increase our premiums? She's not helping Trump when she points out Joe Biden doesn't plan on doing anything about our healthcare system even in the middle of a pandemic.
Yeah, sure. But wait till Trump gets a hold of that sharpie for the forecast track ;-)
Thank Goodness she is nothing like her mom, pretty she can change at some point, after all Kellyanne had criticized Trump a couple of times.
Trump supporters want him to win in November right...so wouldn't it make sense to want to flatten the curve (i.e. wear masks and social distance) now before November so there is a big economy boom and support for him?? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
This is who Joe Biden and Kamala Harris attracts. I'll be damned if this is who we have to unite with in order to defeat Trump. A bunch of bitter, hateful, self-absorbed trolls that don't think we're actual people. We don't matter to them. They sound just like Republicans.

The truth to them is like God's Word is to demons. They don't want exposure or to answer for their crimes against America &amp; its people. Trump didn't play their game &amp; refused to be their puppet. Dems won't tolerate this &amp; Joe Biden is willing to be their puppet.
No TRUMP 2020 I'M VOTING FOR  Who's with me? Let's go Joe!!!!!
Trump tweets how he feels. It gives fuel to the fodder that are looking to get rid of him. Get a life.  Don't you have anything better to do.
That's during the pandemic not before. Everyone has been affected by it. Blame China &amp; the WHO for what they've done, not Trump.

Now that Trump has suggested it, it would be impossible even if it was wise.

Susan, you‚Äôre going down! You suck up to Trump, although some things ‚Äúconcern‚Äù you. He didn‚Äôt learn his lesson, but you‚Äôre about to learn yours. Buh bye. Don‚Äôt let Trump hit you in the ass on your way out.
wow, the article said absolutely nothing about why Trump was wrong.. makes me think he is right in this case
What even is Trump‚Äôs best? I don‚Äôt think he has one. Isn‚Äôt  his wife‚Äôs motto Be Best. Should have started with her husband. Another epic fail.
I have nothing nice to say about him. He was a sexual pervert. He enabled a sexual pervert Donald Trump. He spoke badly about people wearing masks during a pandemic, then suffering death himself. He got what he deserved‚Äîrotten hell Uncle Tom!

Trump goes flat out on all the issues that will lead to fascism and American degradation. It‚Äôs called Thursday.  Me and Sen Collins are holding our breath for a pivot on Friday.
Pretty much me when trump lie everyday!!
I never stated that a counter attack violated the War Powers Act, as long as proper notice is given.  A social media account, even if owned by the President, does not carry the same weight as an official document, notice, or EO. However, Trump seems to think otherwise.

President Trump told Congress that if it should arise he will notify them of a Declaration of war with Iran via his social media account, bypassing the War Powers Act of 1973.   A Declaration of war without Congressional approval, by definition, is an Executive order.
I would also like Biden to commit to ensuring that all future POTUS's, including himself, are unable to commit the wholesale obstruction of oversight and justice Trump/Barr have. That and making it clear to all those currently betraying our country that there WILL be a reconning.

Herman Cain died! Could it be he caught covid-19 at the Trump rally??
The only economic numbers that really concern me are those that affect the black community, and Trumps numbers compared to Obama's are night and day. I can point to specific things Trump did that had positive effects on black employment and ultimately black earnings

40 days Herman Cain walked through the valley of death, 40 days from his attending the "Spread the Hate and COVID Rally". This tweet didn't even have time to age, much less age poorly. I wonder what the other fine folks are thinking right now? Trump is not worth it people.
To stop Trump from cheating, demand in-person voting with ID! It's the only way to stop him!
The GDP fell a record 32.9%. Trump floated the idea of postponing the elections. Herman Caind died from Covid after not wearing a mask at Trump's Tulsa rally. My God! It's not even noon yet and I'm fvcking dizzy!!!üò≥üò≥üò£üò£
It would actually be GOOD for Susan Collins‚Äô political prospects to finally check Trump on his latest fascist nonsense, but she‚Äôs so deep in the weeds, I doubt she sees it. She only knows compliance.
That‚Äôs because u have a conscience. Trump doesn‚Äôt. No soul either.
I am institutionalist that believes Donald Trump can postpone the election if Bob Barr says so (check), the US Senate let‚Äôs him (check) and the press rolls over for him (check). You can whine about feckless DEMs in Congress but they won‚Äôt matter after those other things.
Which is why Donald Trump and his GOP are trying to suspend US elections and remain in office as a dictator
Esper is another pathetic piece of Trump garbage.
Wow. This didn‚Äôt age well. But then again, nothing a fascist like trump does ages well. How sad you are so inept at seeing the idiot behind the large tie.

Woah, Herman Cain dead from coronavirus.  2012's Donald Trump supported a flat federal income tax. (Terrible idea)  #9Nine9
Wow. Cain made the choice to attend, but Trump has blood on his hands. So sad...don‚Äôt wish this fate on anyone regardless of ideology.
At Trump‚Äôs Tulsa rally probably. He was not wearing a mask.
Trump killed this man.
And Trump is? You‚Äôre operating on a different platform.
Trump suggests delaying 2020 election, a move that can only be made by Congress
Trump killed Herman Cain.
Conservative Democrats are just itching for Trump to delay the election just so Pelosi could be president. I hate it here.
Yeah I'd say highly unlikely. Trump isn't self aware enough for this, plus dropping out would stain him equally as if he had lost in a landslide.  I mean the piece is all speculation anyway, so why not ask the question? But this headline, however, could use work
Trump is just trying to change the news cycle from him being the cause of Herman Cain's death anything else. If the media lets him do that they are culpable.
You‚Äôve Been Trumped Too: Documentary that Trump ‚Äòdoesn‚Äôt want you to see‚Äô to be released worldwide #SmartNews
Prayers to his family. But, he shouldn't have went that Trump rally without a mask.
Do you think Herman Cain was willing to die for Trump? Because that's what he has literally done. He went to Trump's Tulsa rally, got COVID-19, and died.
Dear President Trump: Please hold a Press Conference with the Suvivors of Covid, who used HCL+ZPAC. Hopefully, the media want ‚ÄúCensure‚Äù you. Thank You for being our President!
Trump wants to postpone the election just when the economy goes badly into the gutter. Trump Pence, most of the staff in the Wh and many members of Congress all vote by mail. Do you think Trump now thinks it will be fraudulent because Putin can have no impact on vote by mail?
President Trump, a suggestion for mail in voting so the chance that the Post Office might lose it could be avoided, have a drop box outside of each polling place that individuals can drop them off curb side.
Well,while Trump is floating delaying the elections, I would like to counter with speeding up the timeline. How‚Äôs August for everyone? Sound good? #DumpTrumpNow
Trump votes by mail but doesn‚Äôt want the rest of us to vote that way. It‚Äôs confusing!  Also, ballets start going out in early August, about two weeks.
Let's face the truth,  Trump is protecting his interests in Russia.  So he can build REALESTATE there When he leaves office

Let get this troll out !  Pelosi! Get ready. Absent a clear winner of the presidential election on January 20, the Speaker of the House would serve as Acting President under the current succession law. Trump may have to throw out of the WH!!
Trump is dangerous For Americans!
TRUMP IS PROTECTING HIS  RIGHT TO MAKE MONEY IN RUSSIA WHEN HE LEAVE OFFICE,  DAM AMERICA,  MONEY IS HIS GOD
Trump will not be there. He is not welcome.
Proof is, that Trump tweeted it, and I showed you the tweet. How in the possible world is that fake?
Does Donald Trump realise that delaying the election would just result in the Nancy Pelosi being sworn in as President on 20th January, rather than him remaining indefinitely?  Or is it too much to expect him to understand the US Constitution?   Oh yeah, of course it is‚Ä¶
Then say THAT, huge difference between economic contraction and horrible pandemic response.  And that's how Trump and his supporters always turn out right in these arguments because his detectors attack the wrong thing
The new USPS postmaster inspector general Louis Dejoy(major Trump donor) will cause delays by eliminating over time, stopping late mail trips, and any mail not delivered that day will be sent out next day or days. This will only increase fraud narrative.
Republicans are in a dark and racist place with trump supporters carrying guns and ak47 in Michigan talking about hanging and shooting ppl! White privileged has no ideal they are wrong ! But trump don‚Äôt care ! Vote this troll out!

My newest hot take on this: Defund the Police was unintentionally brilliant slogan because Trump has taken the bait on it and ran with campaign messaging around it that is so detached from reality it inflicts self harm.
I would not spend a dime on this criminal who is fighting to stay out of prison for decades of corruption! Law &amp; Order = Trump 2020!!
This is a war from the left! They are trying to defend the corruption at all cost because they fear law and order!!! Trump 2020!

For years people have been wondering what would happen if Trump simply ignored the Supreme Court's ruling(s). I guess we're about to find out.
I would think at least a few of those people would realize their vote helped push trump over the top.

3-it's unlikely that all of those voters stick with Trump in 2020 or that we see 136k less voters than in 2012. MI's 2018 gubernatorial election had 4.2m votes cast (3m for Gov 2014, 4.5m in 16). Gov Whitmer had exactly 2k less votes than Clinton. I'm nervous, but confident
2-take away the 136k votes that disappeared (and assume that they ALL voted for Obama in 2012), and that means the delta between Obama and Trump's victories is around 350k. So either GOP was extra energized (no evidence), or ~350k voters voted for Trump who voted for Obama in 12.
1-He needs more than 15k in Detroit to not vote. Both candidates received 7k less votes than their party candidate in Oakland Co in 2016 v 2012. Wayne Co was 60k less and MI cast 136k less total votes. The vote shifted nearly 500k, total, to Trump from Obama (who won MI by 450k)

The entire permanent establishment is doing everything they can to destroy Trump's chance for reelection.  That includes the GOP who know they're going to want to dine at the same DC restaurants while they live off taxpayer money after Trump is gone.
When are you going to stop kissing trump ass
Probably worried about two things: 1) Cubans in Florida who are ardently anti-socialist; and, 2) polls showing non-black minority approval for Trump skyrocketing.
Trump just stupid as hell but if ppl really paid attention he always tell da truth it just dont come off intelligently
I‚Äôm crying if Trump bans TikTok lol
Isn't that what the DOJ did to Donald Trump for the three years of the Russiagate hoax?
I have no trust in the Trump administration. I will be looking for independent medical experts to tell me the vaccine is safe and effective. That used to be the FDA, but someone else is going to have to vouch for their assessment this time.

Okay, but how are we supposed to know that? The men out of uniform aren‚Äôt identifying themselves. We know Trump already called for the ‚Äúfeds‚Äù to go to Chicago. For all we know, this wld indicate they‚Äôre in NY also.
Please don‚Äôt wear a mask mr. Trump.
Dr. Fauci is much more interesting on TV than Donald Trump.  The doctor's dry sense of humor is delightful, especially when compared with Trump's mean spirited attempts too elicit laughter.  This is just one reason #WhyIDontLikeTrump .  Everyone knows that #TrumpIsALoser
Trump at the debates 'CHYYYYYYY-nuh' 'Obama-gate' 'fake news' .  His platform is already on his website.
You're the only one holding down credibility for that publication for this one Knicks fan. Thanks KOC.
Trump standing there talking and his bootlicking ass kisses standing behind him nodding their heads. Nothing but feces coming out of his mouth. He's given up on doing anything about the pandemic(another failure) &amp; gone to "law and order." Pushing a BS drug that he has money in.
Holy mother of God, Trump's on a tear outside the White House this morning...

The clown is in full make up today &amp; railing about Democratic cities. Any one who would listen to a life long criminal talk about law and order is a damn fool. Trump has no credibility at all talking about law and order. He's failed at ever thing he tried as president. EVERYTHING

Hey  chill the fuck out! Do you want Trump to be president again?
A lot of Trump Supporters actually look like there‚Äôs something wrong with them
I've gotten to the point where I have on interest in saying anything about Trump. Even to disparage him is just a waste of my precious time. He doesn't deserve even to be addressed in any way. He's a total null set, an empty set unworthy of any energy. He has no standing. A void
This is exactly what the EU is saying about trump‚Äôs America! Closed their borders to us because trumplicans think that social distancing and wearing a mask is an infringement on their rights.

trump canceled the Florida RNC convention. 2 months after your tweet, Red Florida is getting worse with this ‚Äúblown out of proportion flu.‚Äù I guess all of those $millions from donors is just paying for trump‚Äôs ‚Äúfear porn.‚Äù Because it‚Äôs NOT paying for a convention!

President Trump wants to include $1.8 billion in a coronavirus aid bill to rebuild the FBI's headquarters. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he opposes the idea.
It so very clear that you have completely lost what simple mind you have. It‚Äôs people like you that makes Americans want Trump re-elected right now not in November. Your reality is a swirl of ridiculousness and folly. Even if you wanted to could never be an American. Phony!!
üòÜNC wanted him to take safety precautions so he moved it to Florida where they obviously don‚Äôt care as much about their citizens health. Then it got so bad in Florida trump said nevermind. üòÜüòÜüòÜYeah, he‚Äôs doing a bang up job! $millions from donors ‚Äúlost.‚Äù Rubes.

You‚Äôve all forgotten how that was so much more important to you than police brutality. You‚Äôve forgotten how trump told you not to forget your 2A, but when people are actually confronted with a tyrannical government: a president who takes military action on its own citizens...
We know you kiss Trump's ass but damn...who knew you love doing it!  Trump is CORRUPT and all of the GOP BUTKISSERS know it!  Hell you even talked about Trump when he was running for office.   Like RUSSIA has dirt on Trump...Trump has dirt on you...  WHAT DOE TRUMP HAVE ON YOU?

I know people in the military and they're pro Trump. Might not be representative of the whole military but I don't get the idea that the military folks I know are extremely weird
On one hand "whatever it takes" to get people to see the dangers of this adminstration, and what the GOP has been enabling.  On the other hand, wow this is what it took? I guess he'd have to personally hear Trump say the n-word in order to believe he's racist, too, huh?
Oh hell yeah I'm voting. First time in awhile. Too much at stake to let Trump get another 4 years.

You remain silent while the  regulations enacted to end racial discrimination in housing are scrapped. You voted against Voting Rights. Your homage is hypocritical
Got to wonder if low energy has to do with the dismal polling numbers. I know they were bad for Trump in 2016 as well, but the feeling of inevitable defeat has to squelch some firepower in the takes.

Trump has been failing ever since covid. This is the classic rock and a hard place.
I remember the days when we used to vote for people and not simply against a candidate. Biden offers nothing other than he isn't Trump. He doesn't even have a vp which we all know will end up running things.

How can anyone vote FOR him and not just against Trump
Have we decided to just abide Trump until the election? To let him continue these fascist abuses of power, and failure to respond to coronavirus?  People are dying.  Support orgs taking legal action against this administration now. Support or join the protests. Don't look away.

The Final Lap: TRUMP ALLEGED NEGATIVES
trump has one agenda himself &amp; staying as dictator in OUR W.H. Over 152,000 have died with families destroyed 4+million reported infections (that could be double) &amp; still he remains the source of chaos with his bigotry &amp; lies. Not another failed experiment with our children next
We don't care about what you say anymore. Say Goodbye. Your Fired Traitor. You chose Trump and broke your vow to America. RESIGN NOW. By the way. We're watching and this covid19 relief better not enrich a one of you.
"Not answering any questions," said Sen. Joni Ernst, an Iowa Republican also facing voters in a tough race, when asked about Trump's tweet.

One of trump‚Äôs cronies let the cat out of the bag, anyone before getting near the orange shitpile, gets tested, within minutes, results, unlike Americans where it can take 3-4 weeks for a results, if you can get a test.
Yes, let‚Äôs all vote for Trump. Who wanted to marry his daughter Ivanka, who raped underage girls, and wants incest and child rape to be legal.
Kind of amazing if trump doesn't come down with covid 19. He's as wreckless as ever about it. What would happen to the Republican nomination? Mike Pence? Who could they Nominate?
Trump supporters keeps getting dumber day by day.
Lmao s/o trump
So now we know what Trump was talking to Putin about? Ways to disrupt our democratic election process by stalling it. This is a crooked tactic that Putin used to win his election. I say ‚ÄúHELL TO THE NO‚Äù.!
Trump and this ‚Äúthe stimulus may be this and the stimulus may be that‚Äù shit is annoying. Is you giving us some coin or not Trump Daddy?
He's trying to trump it up üòÇ
Trump says second stimulus check could be 'way higher' than $1,200  #FoxBusiness
It‚Äôs not sad but could have been prevented. Not all, but a lot of Trump supporters believe that Dems and Health experts are making this political. This is the real deal. My dad got sick in April and I lost my grandmother last week.
Just registered to vote by mail. Fuck Donald Trump
We just need one cough from Trump on camera.. just one
#TexasCOVID     And one of Trump‚Äôs airplane cronies let the cat out of the bag, ‚Äúwe get tested when we get near‚Äù Bone Spurs,  almost instant results.  So how long does it take you to get a test?Any worries of losing a job, that job perk healthcare tied 2it?
That is Criminal and should be investigated along with all of trump's other shady deals.
EEUU: 'Democrats and Republicans alike quickly condemned the president‚Äôs tweet, many expressing alarm at the president‚Äôs apparent disregard for the limits of his power'

Herman Cain, 74, died after a battle with coronavirus.  On July 2, he was hospitalized in an Atlanta-area hospital, two weeks after attending President Donald Trump's rally in Tulsa.
If he was immunocompromised then he should have took the necessary precautions. He went to a Trump rally and downplayed coronavirus instead. Look what happened. RIP tho üôèüèæ
Esper is another pathetic piece of Trump garbage.
Trump suggests delaying 2020 election, a move that can only be made by Congress
Trump killed Herman Cain.
Trump is just trying to change the news cycle from him being the cause of Herman Cain's death anything else. If the media lets him do that they are culpable.
Do you think Herman Cain was willing to die for Trump? Because that's what he has literally done. He went to Trump's Tulsa rally, got COVID-19, and died.
Trump wants to postpone the election just when the economy goes badly into the gutter. Trump Pence, most of the staff in the Wh and many members of Congress all vote by mail. Do you think Trump now thinks it will be fraudulent because Putin can have no impact on vote by mail?
Why do Trump cultists always have to scream and tell and SHOCK!! tweet about everything? Without verified sources for anything?
Trump votes by mail but doesn‚Äôt want the rest of us to vote that way. It‚Äôs confusing!  Also, ballets start going out in early August, about two weeks.
[Trump delays the election and declines to leave when he loses]  "Ah! Well, nevertheless,"
The POS fake President is going to do anything like shutting down the postal service. There needs to be an immediate effort to bar his authority over the USPS to keep him from stealing the election. His hand picked Minion removed from it's control. Trump will lie, cheat, &amp; Steal.
So trump wants to delay the election, but still wants schools to open on time? I can‚Äôt wait to vote this moron out of office
Trump was way behind in the polls in 2016 and still won. TMZ is so quick to jump on the liberal ignorant bandwagon whenever it comes by. üòÜ
Wow, you're stupid if you think that's proof of actual voter fraud in an election. Of course, most Christian Trump supporters, like my family, would probably think it's real and not vote otherwise, so there is that.
Wow, 3000? Good luck keeping up! Had a ride myself but nothing like that. I'm still new here so I'm just trying to make some friends and share the love. Bless us all. If trump had his way only those who sing his praises would have this Freedom. Take care and make sure you vote üôè
We need to call out people being cruel on here. No one needs any more hurt added to their lives. trump has given out enough cruelty that so many are forced to endure. His diabolical treatment of minorities of all ages is beyond evil.

Trump counts on his supporters to be stupid enough to believe anything he says #NobodyLikesTrump
You don't have to be an investigative reporter to figure it out. Trump has a financial  interest in it. He sold $29M of it to some states before they proved it was useless or even harmful in the virus. He has stock in the company that makes it in one way or the other. Follow the
I'm a veteran who didn't join the Legion.   Trump is outrageously unqualified, for almost anything. He and those that support his authoritarian practice are a danger to our nation and the Constitution.

He ask for it. He's a real live dumb ass couldn't think of a nicer guy. Well yes I could, but he might have it &amp; wouldn't say anything &amp; infect people instead of admitting failure which is evident. Trump owns the virus. He flubbed it. Make him wear it. POS Gohmert deserves Covid.

I swear, he jerks off to a pic of trump every morning...  wtf is wrong with this guy?ü§îü§£üòÇ
My newest hot take on this: Defund the Police was unintentionally brilliant slogan because Trump has taken the bait on it and ran with campaign messaging around it that is so detached from reality it inflicts self harm.
Damn. Talk about a mea culpa. üëÄü§Ø  This is an excerpt?! Gonna be an intense book...
I felt your tweet in my bones. Last week when Trump finally said covid19 is real, the collective news media tripped over themselves framing his "new tone."  verbally side-eyeing all of them ("someone got him on script to say what we all already knew") kept me sane
I‚Äôm not as worried about FL OH or NC - no clue on NH; I‚Äôm somewhat more interested in NE2 and Maine2 tbh as though could eek Trump to 270
I‚Äôve come to now believe that PA is Trump‚Äôs most important state
When asked if a $1,200 direct payment to Americans was enough, Trump said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to see it may go higher than that, actually.‚Äù

We don't know if Trump hasn't tested positive. If he has he would never admit it. Just like he won't show his taxes. He could be infected and spreading the virus. We know that his "physician" will lie for him. To tell if he has the virus is to admit failure which is evident. LIAR

President Donald Trump said he takes no responsibility for any spike in people using disinfectants improperly after dangerously suggesting that ingesting it could serve as a coronavirus treatment.
With the United States now in a war against the coronavirus, President Trump has taken the opposite approach ‚Äî constantly blaming others and denying any responsibility for problems under his command.

l agree, its a mindset of dominance &amp; power over the more vulnerable. Sound like anyone we know? Yes, that right it's how trump governs &amp; wants his BASE to behave. Every chance he gets he calls for violence. A major tool for separating &amp; dividing the country
Smfh. Trump really one of the most vile, most disgusting creatures on the planet. Yall better vote in november and get his ass out of office. AND DONT GO VOTE FOR NO STUPID SHIT! This shit serious
America has to change we have to change for the better we have dug down into the garbage pail and pull Donald Trump the worst president in the entire history of the world him and his cronies should be ashamed be even near the White House.

John there were many people so "FRIEGHTENED" at the prospect Hillary would get elected they FOOLISHLY believed Trump is the lesser of the two evils, this year Biden gets that distinction.  People need to stop votng out of fear.
Leftists politicians are not. Corporate democrats and establishment dems maybe. Either way it‚Äôs a false equivalency. Trump is literally pardoning his friends and firing anyone he can that isn‚Äôt loyal to him. He is an authoritarian through and through.
Yeah it‚Äôs a pandemic people will die that‚Äôs unfortunate is what I said I didn‚Äôt say that I don‚Äôt wear a mask because I do 9 hours a day 6 days a week at work at Walmart so what I am saying is that you can‚Äôt say trump is responsible for COVID because China is and they should pay
And that‚Äôs just in winter 80,000 so we‚Äôre nowhere near that with COVID because all of last year the flu killed over 300,000 so how is that not serious. You gonna blame trump for the flu also? Probably. I‚Äôm a registered Democrat and I‚Äôm not voting for Biden because he‚Äôs a racist
You should learn to do some actual research the flu has killed more people this year than COVID-19 and I actually voted for Obama twice and Hillary in 2016 I just never had the hate for trump you and everyone else does. I‚Äôm a registered Democrat and joe Biden is a racist
The Democrats want to "save" with special recovery programs...that are renamed Federal programs Trump put in place...
In 99 days if trump is re-elected you and every other crazy liberal fanatics will shit a brick and lose your minds I can‚Äôt wait to see the anarchy it will cause. Especially since the other guy Biden is actually a real racist who said if you don‚Äôt vote for me u ain‚Äôt black
Figured, another trump kook.
That‚Äôs still not anywhere near how many people die from the flu in a year in the United States idiot and it‚Äôs a pandemic unfortunately people will die but you can‚Äôt blame trump for everything when China didn‚Äôt lock down as fast as they could they let it go on and they should pay

Yes Don, l believe that will be the future unless those that think trump knows what he is doing start to respect guidelines that can save 10's of thousands Wearing a mask is so simple yet in defiance they won't Selfish ignorance &amp; arrogance is all l can think of to explain stupid

I swear, he jerks off to a pic of trump every morning...  wtf is wrong with this guy?ü§îü§£üòÇ
My newest hot take on this: Defund the Police was unintentionally brilliant slogan because Trump has taken the bait on it and ran with campaign messaging around it that is so detached from reality it inflicts self harm.
Damn. Talk about a mea culpa. üëÄü§Ø  This is an excerpt?! Gonna be an intense book...
I felt your tweet in my bones. Last week when Trump finally said covid19 is real, the collective news media tripped over themselves framing his "new tone."  verbally side-eyeing all of them ("someone got him on script to say what we all already knew") kept me sane
I‚Äôm not as worried about FL OH or NC - no clue on NH; I‚Äôm somewhat more interested in NE2 and Maine2 tbh as though could eek Trump to 270
I‚Äôve come to now believe that PA is Trump‚Äôs most important state
When asked if a $1,200 direct payment to Americans was enough, Trump said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to see it may go higher than that, actually.‚Äù

We don't know if Trump hasn't tested positive. If he has he would never admit it. Just like he won't show his taxes. He could be infected and spreading the virus. We know that his "physician" will lie for him. To tell if he has the virus is to admit failure which is evident. LIAR

President Donald Trump said he takes no responsibility for any spike in people using disinfectants improperly after dangerously suggesting that ingesting it could serve as a coronavirus treatment.
With the United States now in a war against the coronavirus, President Trump has taken the opposite approach ‚Äî constantly blaming others and denying any responsibility for problems under his command.
‚ÄúI don't take responsibility at all,‚Äù Trump said defiantly, pointing to an unspecified ‚Äúset of circumstances‚Äù and ‚Äúrules, regulations and specifications from a different time.‚Äù

I've gotten to the point where I have on interest in saying anything about Trump. Even to disparage him is just a waste of my precious time. He doesn't deserve even to be addressed in any way. He's a total null set, an empty set unworthy of any energy. He has no standing. A void

Biden is a clown and a puppet.  Trump 2020
And yet every woman in the documentary never names Clinton as a participant in underage sex.  Trump, however, they name.  And Dershowitz.  I am sure Ghislaine Maxwell has all of the names.
You ask too much of here. She gave all when she tore up Trump‚Äôs speech. üòè
It didn't work for Wallace's presidential hopes, let us all pray that it doesn't work for Trump THIS TIME!
I need a computer...shit. ü§£ Let me know if you see Trump's name.
All these tweets about Democratic extremist are funny how soon we forget the terrorist attacks done by people from the right. I'm not a Trump supporter and I do not condone murder of anyone for their political beliefs.
Well...those Epstein and Maxwell documents have been released, and people are having A FIELD DAY!!! Trump will be on a bender for sure tonight and tomorrow!
Stay off the drugs.  Trump 2020.  Keep draining the swamp.
Trump‚Äôs metastatic stupidity is a given. But fucking Jared Kushner‚Äôs decision to let #TrumpVirus national testing plan get shelved because it initially hammered just blue states? Amoral. Criminal.
Journalists assignmemt. Talk to your inside contacts about Trumps internal polls. Are they as roses as Trump says or is it just more Trump bullshit.
I guess he bought the trump virus-hoax hoax. Sad.
Get us a cainadent worth voter time and turnout trump is going to bound us unless the dems get it straight fast!!!üíØüî®üéºüèàüëçüèªüçÄüí°üôè‚ù§Ô∏èüêüüíé‚ú®
Defending the indefensible. Trump has no morals. No character. He cares only about himself. How do you not get that still? -- Opinion | You have echoed lies and defended demagoguery. It must sting to still be defending Trump.
Oooh...now do Trump.
Way to backtrack. She "could have".   You are still so hung up on Hillary when trump is trying to undermine our democracy right in front of your face.
The electoral college elected Trump. The people did not.
Damn it I'm crying just watching this guy. How did we go from him to Trump????
I hate to echo Trump but Fauci's been wrong more than once &amp; consistent in erring against side of caution. Impossible to be free from political influence in his role even w/concerted effort.He has to be pragmatic, avoid being silenced.&amp; you're ignoring his preface"I don't think"
It's good he didn't because the last thing we needed is 1) the focus being less on Mr. Lewis and more about how Trump will act and 2) the media chomping at the bit to give him credit for something, anything.
Agreed 100 percent. It also shows the hypocrisy: Trump can go on the attack at a moment's notice with little to no pushback, but when he's rightfully called out on his nonsense, his worshipers want to cry foul. #ThinSkinned
Does ANYBODY have a link to them??? Trump's name has to be in them.
I don‚Äôt think we can assume anything. The entire constitution is more ambiguous vaguries than substantive rules. Trump has shown that most Of the ‚Äúrules‚Äù are more traditions. If congress and the courts don‚Äôt enforce anything who will?

You support Trump. I am sure Jesus Christ would not approve of Trump. You support a man who lies without impunity even when a pandemic wipes out Americans. Trump will lose &amp; he will take the GOP down with him. ETTD. Get some courage. Save America. Give up Putin. Give up Trump
you have killed over 150,000 americans, calling this virus a hoax. you are leaving in january, then will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, including those wicked kids of yours...
you will not escape the long arm of the law.  we are going to have you, in orange and behind bars. winning the election will have been your biggest downfall!!
No he is not I would vote for a statue before Trump who cares nothing they than himself
You‚Äôre the one that needs to leave before Trump and you minions completely destroy it.
I don't think military coup is what we need to be worried about. That's not the way slide into authoritarianism happens anymore, for the most part. It's a process that has been playing out in our recent history &amp; is far more common than we realize. See
He‚Äôs too far to the left. He wouldn‚Äôt get near the votes Trump will. Personally I don‚Äôt care who‚Äôs running, I‚Äôll vote blue. This country can‚Äôt stand another 4 years of Trump.
And Trump wants to try and delay the election which is unconstitutional. Talk about interfering with the integrity of an election
If your opponent is burying himself, stay on high ground, don't pick up a shovel! Firing up base counterproductive. Fox gleefully touts  Trump enthusiasm,  supporters more concerned to boot Trump. Works in your favor for those on the fence.
President Trump urges COVID-19 survivors to donate plasma  #politics
I‚Äôm totally sure Trump will be as mature and noble!!!!!!!
And yet Trump is President! Oh wait that means they DID accept it. Obama didn‚Äôt refuse to leave the WH! Wow he was actually at Trump‚Äôs inauguration! And met with him to give advice for a smooth handover of power! It was wonderful. Democracy!
Why is he talking about Trump? Sounds like something Trump does consistently.
It's about being able to say you were against Trump if/when he loses so you can rehab your image
Let's not get fucking ridiculous here. Trump has certainly contributed to the continued spread of COVID with his attempt at minimizing its dangers for political reasons.   Herman Cain was a 74 year old man. He made a choice and paid the price.  That's his ass and now his funeral.
Neither Biden nor trump speak in complete sentencesü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
No statement is made. As a courtesy, Biden might not even mention Trump in his inaugural address. One week later, Trump takes to Twitter to criticize the new admin and insists things would be different, had the election not been stolen. But despite his threats, he never litigates
W the absolute F???  Biden: ‚ÄúTrumps gonna suggest something crazy and illegal.‚Äù Trump: (suggests something crazy and illegal.‚Äù Turkey: ‚ÄúThese two guys are equally in the wrong!!!‚Äù
President Trump pushes plasma donation during visit to Red Cross headquarters  #politics
No, it would be a Speaker of the House, not Pence because Pence is part of the Trump administration.  He would only take overs if Trump resigned. üåéüåä
I.e., the evidence that Russia has and continues to interfere in our elections on Trump's behalf? I think there is a lot of basis for extrapolating a motive there too!
I just signed a  petition to  and  calling on them to include ending marijuana prohibition in their campaign platforms. Sign here:
Trump was the killer, his Tulsa rally was the gun, Covid was the bullet. Although Cain was begging to be the victim.
Someone is certainly hoping that Trump will grab them where the sun doesn't shine üôÑ
Obama is the foie gras we wish we had everday.  Trump is the hamburger helper that we try to tolerate.
Don‚Äôt tell that to Trump! Fake news üòÇ
The only problem with this thread is, I'm not sure Trump is this smart. It's definitely the way his instincts blow, and as we've all seen, it gets him quite far. Hopefully it's not far enough.
Partially true, but Cain chose to be a sycophant to Trump.
Yes, let me take parenting advice from the person who thinks Donald Trump Jr. is an ideal mate
Well I certainly wish he would resign. But pence would have to win the next election, because Trump wouldn‚Äôt be prosecuted before then. And I doubt parents could win five dollars in a lottery ticket
Did he call the Coronavirus a "Democrat hoax" too?  What a buffoon if he's supporting you Trump.  You are the biggest embarrassment this country has ever seen.
Just more proof of the dictatorship of Donald Trump
Only if Trump would have used a damn maker to black out covid and make it so it never arrived we wouldn‚Äôt be heaüòÇ
Watch our  townhall now and hear from some of the smart people I get to work with now to remove Trump and Trumpism from office this November. #LincolnProject
That‚Äôs exactly what Trump is hoping for. He wants a Civil War. And I believe he would do anything to get one. That way he can stay in control.
You should take your Trump loving a lying self and resign from Fox. You are a disgrace to the word  are also definitely not a journalist because journalists seek truth.
No but Cain made a grave mistake by denying science to appear more Trumpian. That may be even a more incriminating reflection of Donald Trump's pure evilness.
People are actually willingly and publicly Trump supporters ü•¥ wow that‚Äôs embarrassing
Stop blaming the Dems. Get rid of a new FBI building and business lunch writeoffs. Extend unemployment, eviction moratoriums, and expand food stamps. Do something for the people, not your rich cronies and Trump's ridiculous wants.
How are the republicans not him to trump being an autocrat? Do they not care about our elections?
Whether Democrats see that way I think it's just a fact that China prefers Biden, Russia prefers Trump. My intepretation is in part: China sees stable US govt in their interest, Putin the opposite. China rela. complex like everything POTUS needs to be able to manage complexity!
Not until after the election. You know the  would now take the position Trump‚Äôs nomination deserves a vote. Don‚Äôt even give those hypocrites an opportunity to show us their justification on not voting on Obama‚Äôs pick was a lie
40 days from the Trump Tulsa rally to death! Trump‚Äôs gift to the right wing radical Herman Cain! How many more rallys you gonna have Donnie Boy?
No, I didn't hear it, but I would have fallen out laughing just the same. Barron is a clone of the trump kids.
Yes and I‚Äôve decided to vote in person because of it.  Trump is going to try some dirty trick w the USPS and voted by mail.  I‚Äôll be at the polling station first thing in the morning w a mask on and watch my vote counted.
Ask the  where the tests are--the ones from  that trump refused to use in the U.S. We lost weeks of testing in February and March and we haven't caught up.     this lethal mess is all yours.
I'll do it, I'll do it! (thx to mary trump)
This assumes an election that the Republicans have not rigged, Trump showing maturity.   Congressional Republicans respecting law, and the DOJ acting in the interest of the people.    Fiction has to have SOME ground in reality to be believed.
Gotta watch vote counts from GA/FL/AZ.  Expect Kemp/Desantis/Ducey to bury any votes that result in Trump losing.
Sad Darwin Award winner and Trump enabler. He paid the ultimate price by following Trump‚Äôs #NoMask stupidity.
Republican senators propose $1,000 stimulus checks.                         Trump will reject it tho
Yes, we're blaming trump...and you. Ineffectual losers
He jus has the title but like any other job found out he couldn‚Äôt do it, now its time to fire and rehire. Trump üëÄkno what I‚Äôm talking about.
this  segment where experts gamed out every possible election outcome &amp; what happens if #Barr/#Trump/McConnell et al play hardball is terrifying. they are deliberately vague but it sounds like all scenarios --even decisive Trump loss--turn out badly
If I am someone who is considering a second vote for Trump, I am thinking-he wants to make election safer! No matter what he does they criticize! It's just a tweet! Focus dilutes narrative, appeals only to hardcore support.(A common theme)
Always happy to support  taking on the horrible policies of the Trump Administration. There is no logic or rationale behind this move except pettiness.
How about stopping voter restriction and voter fraud that occurs by limiting voting locations and other ways of limiting access for people of color??? Why not care as much about that?? And BTW, check out voting machines with Ivanka trump copyrights..WTH???
Can trump pls jus tell the Republicans to het off their asses pl. Trump do something
I go to bed every night praying to God that my country will survive Donald Trump and his supporters. I wake every morning with the hope that each new day brings me closer to voting that mofo out of office.  I hope and pray I am not alone.

maybe Trump should have sex with a demon alien? Then the witch doctor will like him and he can assault her because she believes in aliens and he likes alien sex.  whatever. poor poor donald.  woe's me....  let me play my tiny violin for him
Hey everyone, I'm not an expert, but I *think* trump knows when he's being hypocritical ("schools can open, but no election?!"), I think the thing is...he just doesn't care? And he's going to do things that benefit him regardless of the optics because...  HE DOESN'T CARE.
You know, I wonder if that guy on one of the CNN "Trump panels" in 2017 who enthusiastically said he was "proud" of Trump feels the same way in present day 2020.
According to the most recent ACS, the racial composition of Pennsylvania was: White: 80.85%, Black or African American: 11.13%, Asian: 3.35%. Trump audience? 100% White.
Donald Trump wants to send your kids to school but wants to push the election back so we can vote in person. Politicians are sending your kids to school while theirs will remain at home...they don‚Äôt care if you all die
Trump 2020, a summary
People need to be reminded that Roy Cohen was an Attorney for the NYC Mob when Trump met him.  Cohen was also Joe McCarthy's lead staff during the McCarthy era. To say Barr is Trump's Roy Cohen is to say that Barr is acting like a Mobster's Attorney!

Trump just SMH
Nobody‚Äôs buying your lies Trump
Article you linked talked about challenges of voting during the Covid epidemic. It didn‚Äôt say mail in was a bad idea. In person voting will also be more complicated this year. And Trump voted by mail last election. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening: he knows he‚Äôs going to lose.
I do not believe a word you say. Trump needs to get out of office now before he does any more destruction. You should have listened to witnesses. You should have convicted him. Your party is like the Radical Republicans during and after the Civil War. Get Putin.  Save America.
The idea that you see the problems+ dangers of trump, yet you might still vote for him reflects very poorly on you. Probably you‚Äôre scared of burning bridges or damaging your financial future, but please say ‚Äúno comment,‚Äù or ‚Äúthat‚Äôs personal,‚Äù rather than this nonsense.
I mean, cool... but THIS is where he feels convinced that Trump is a narcissistic fascist?
WE will never forget what Trump has done to this country!! He will be remembered as a shit stain in American history. üí©ü§°ü§¨
Boycotting Goya because the CEO said one complimentary thing about Trump. Meanwhile they donate millions of dollars, feed thousands of people through programs, etc.
I thought Biden spent some ad money in Texas?  Maybe Ohio spend is to counter trump's old lady/defund ad before that idea gets too ingrained.
This is a disgrace! Push back on trump‚Äôs voter fraud lies! Fraud from mail-in ballots is nearly non-existent. Every member of the press should be pushing back on these lies! He‚Äôs scheming with DOJ to try &amp; delay. Play hardball! #pressbriefing #VoterSuppression #COVID19
. WHY are you showing Trump live spewing  his campaign lies on TV??!!! STOP! Report any REAL FACTUAL info from this so -called briefing afterwards.
You are an abomination.  Defending the doctor who believes in demon sperm and alien DNA while avoiding the fact that Trump called for the election to be delayed today, undermining the Constitution.  You call yourself a ‚Äúconstitutional conservative‚Äù?  You are a fraud
Trump doesn‚Äôt feel loved by the people. He‚Äôs not going to make anything easy on us.
You're onto something. Many in both parties don't really know the parties have changed. TedCruz: it's an old lie that Dems are for bluecollar workers. It's Trump who is. Dems are silicon valley billionaires &amp; WallSt tycoons now.
Wait so is it safe to have both elections and open schools orrrrr...? #Trump #COVID__19

How dare HuffPost to decide that Trump's photo op has something to do with Barack Obama at a funeral. The HuffPost employees who put out tweets trying to undermine and smear the president of America are evil.
Donald Trump isn‚Äôt a man at all!
Oh yes, Educated One ... that type of elitist attitude worked so well for Democrats in 2016, didn't it?  Stay in school and work on expanding your vocabulary beyond F Trump.  Smh.
He straight up said Trump was George Wallace.
Tear him up  The right to vote was John Lewis‚Äô lifetime mission. The day of his funeral the current occupant of the White House floated postponing the election because he knows the end is coming. Enough is enough. In America we vote and losers leave! Trump‚Äôs leaving.
Trump deeply insulted Ted Cruz, too. Yet Cruz has moved on &amp; is being constructive, helpful. One moves on. The other goes toxic. Wisdom is mysterious.
Yes. I flipped off a guy the other day simply because he had a trump bumper sticker
I wonder if Trump will be invited to Herman Cain‚Äôs funeral.

Obama was trash, Trump is trash . Whose next
Constantly campaigning? Improving the country?  Trump's federal deregulation set our economy on fire until the China virus shut it down.  America prosperity is priority#1 -- he nailed it and will do it again.
In addition, considering how many vets work for the USPS, this is another case of screwing over vets, that group of citizens Trump pretends to care about so much.
Trumpists: Herman Caine had cancer, so his immune system was already weak   People with a functioning brain: More of a reason to not attend rallies during a pandemic  Trump supporters: it was individualism, his decision.   It was Trump‚Äôs decision to put ppl‚Äôs lives at risk
is a great actor! Don't see conservatives condemning trump for politicizing things! I guess conservatives hold others to higher standards than a president!
for the record I also think theres 0 chance either Trump or Biden knows what anarchism is in terms of ideology

Trump's accusations are quite clearly mad and baseless. But worth pointing out that we delayed local, mayoral and police &amp; crime commissioner elections in England because of Covid-19. They have been put back by 12 months.
To only pick on one of these, and I'm sorry to be so narrow, but isn't Solyndra simply a bad bet? Just like Trump's recent investment in Kodak may be a good or bad bet?
Please, he‚Äôs a Trump supporter. Anyone who supports trump is greedy, a liar &amp; a traitor. You are not in the real world if you think trump will be elected again. He‚Äôs an abomination. He cares about Putin more than Americans. The GOP will go down with trump.
He's transactional, like Trump (who questioned his birth certificate). He just loathes the man &amp; doesn't want him to be reelected. It IS galling to hear him smear our agents (who still protect him) just to persuade some votes. This stinks.
Obama continues to be one of the most toxic and divisive voices in American politics. He never misses an opportunity to lecture everyone, even if that means doing it during a damn eulogy. It‚Äôs exactly what drove people into Trump‚Äôs arms.
WEAR A MASK! Don‚Äôt support Trump anymore. It‚Äôs embarrassing how silent you are. GOP is a laughingstock. You allow this inept traitor to become president and you continue to support him. GOP will lose big in Nov. &amp; you would have earned it. History will not be kind.
I hope I see every Democrat on TV the next few days HAMMERING trump on this complete leadership failure!  What do you think repubs would do?
Herman Cain, a free man, made a free choice to go to the Trump rally.  He want other places and did many other things because, in spite of what Democrats are doing, he was still a free man. You‚Äôre just a jerk making political points about a dead conservative.
It‚Äôs obvious that Trump isn‚Äôt aware that the Speaker of the House, Pelosi would take over the Presidency. Trump hasn‚Äôt learned anything, he just impulsively Tweets &amp; reacts according to what he thinks is to his best advantage. #TrumpThreatensAmerica  #VoteBlueüåä
2K in Facebook add's is not Russian Interference. Hell Mexico and China interfere more than Russia could ever hope to. If you believe the same intelligence community that spied on Trump about Russian interference, you are an idiot! States control elections per the Constitution.

A lot of his followers are not real. Some researchers believe that upwards of 50% of Trump's followers are bots. This site says it's around 17 million bots
Very sad to have battled cancer only to sacrifice your life by ignoring a pandemic to lick the boots of a malignant narcissist who couldn't care less. Cain had compromised health, ignored CDC, and allowed COVID to take him out. Trump will see him as just a lost vote.
Barack and Trump are the yin and yang of great distractions.

While it may only be a suggestion, it is very dangerous because it will give some the idea that Trump can actually do such a thing.  Only state governments or Congress can change election dates, and none can alter the date when the next President's term begins.

Maybe as the day goes on, Trump will note it when he feels it‚Äôs the important thing to do. But what on earth could he say? Cain was following trump‚Äôs no mask crowd.
Trump is President. He messed this up. Other countries did better. All of them except maybe Brazil. Buck stops with Trump.
Yes, he was an Ardent supporter &amp; his death has been reported all day......not a peep about it from trump.
Well for one thing one is mandated by the Constitution. And for another the governor has legal authority to postpone it, and Trump doesn‚Äôt.
I hate that we‚Äôre in a timeline where we‚Äôre even having to debate whether or not Trump can and/or will try to push back the presidential election. I would like off this ride.
Don‚Äôt bother telling Wreck It Ralph that school, sports, and business weren‚Äôt forced closed during those crises either, but thank the good gov for helping Trump make his point. I believe his intention was to get ppl to say loud and often that then election must go as scheduled.
Fuck Donald Trump
LONG LIVE EMPEROR TRUMP.
I am confident that at least a third of the governors/BoE commissioners in the US would obey a personal order from Trump not to count or report election results on Nov 3.   I guess the saving grace is that those would mostly be areas dominated by GOP votes.
Trump is a traitor. You support him. Trump is a liar. You support him. Trump is a criminal. You support him. He lied &amp; denied the virus. You support him. His rhetoric is racist &amp; dividing. You support him. Kids in cages-you support him. GOP is complicit. How much RUS$ did you get

There is something poetic about dying from attending a trump rally days after gutting the fair housing act ... like the ending of some sort of dramatic republican opera.
I'm so glad that the Trump administration follows all laws?   Haven't we learned yet that Trump pushes boundaries up to the point that there is an effective counter force, regardless of laws?
Exactly‚ÄîTrump is inevitably going to step on a rake, then another, etc. But, his first term is a roadmap for someone who knows how to exercise power, and surround themself with a cabinet that knows how to implement it.
I‚Äôm honestly surprised they got any at all, that there was any money left after the white fat-cat Trump donors and mega churches got their handouts.
Don‚Äôt fall for trump‚Äôs tricks. Please carry  funeral live.
This should be the reaction to trump‚Äôs delaying-the-election play. He wants us to freak out. Instead, everyone should take it as an indication that he thinks he will lose. He would hate that narrative. He will love the freak-out narrative.

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever forgive the segment of America that voted for him‚Äîdespite the ocean of clear, well-documented evidence Trump would be a disaster.
NEVER! Trump would take a bullet for his followers. Every patriotic American actually. Not a chance he faltered
You want companies to be exempt from being sued on #coronavirus protections and to give Trump a new FBI buliding for 1.75 billion, but you delayed and don't want to give unemployed Americans what they deserve for something beyond their control..losing a job and trying to survive!
What Trump has done in his first term is create roadmap to autocracy for someone smarter and more ambitious‚Äîthe guardrails wrenched, the norms and institutions hammered into submission.
I watch Barr lie his ass off yesterday and u r telling ppl right side is for  John Lewis said come walk in my shoes then tell me why I need to fight Apso hard for freedom that trump and Mitch McConnell Is control.
Congratulations on being the first and only Republican in the country to go on record defending Trump‚Äôs tweet defying the US Constitution in calling for the delay of the 2020 Election!  Quite a hill you chose!
When you realize Trump only started acknowledging the seriousness of the pandemic so that he could use it as a reason to delay the election.
The smarter one enjoys lots of mental satisfaction. The hard-working one enjoys lots of fun physically by running around. You can also argue that China' Xi is the smart one while America's Trump is the hardworking one.
Amazing how far we have fallen by normalizing President Trump's attacks on the rule of law and Constitution.
I don‚Äôt want to see a single headline talking about Herman Cain dying of COVID unless ‚Äúafter attending Trump rally‚Äù is also included
Looks like the VA GOP is getting in lock step behind Trump's election tweet.
liberals: voting is the most important thing you can do trump: I think I might cancel the election
I literally said brown skin girls don‚Äôt cheat. I‚Äôm a brown girl so why would I include any other race üòÇ you believe in Trump so I know your brain can‚Äôt comprehend that much.
Trump hates John Lewis. Trump lowered the flag for exactly 3/5ths of a day upon Mr. Lewis' passing, and now shits on voting rights the day of his funeral. A funeral with 3 Presidents attending and speaking at. Trump is a vile, sick and sinister being.
President Trump suggested delaying the 2020 presidential election on Thursday, tweeting it will be ‚Äúthe most inaccurate and fraudulent election in history.‚Äù  #2020election #Election2020
True, as  citizens we are the ones in power. But it seems that  our power has been diluted and coopted and undermined to such a degree that many sane, reasonable, and in some cases even well-informed people will likely vote for Trump‚Äî again!!
Reminder that only a vote for Trump is a vote for Trump!! Bc that's literally how elections work!
A tragic, preventable loss of a "black voice" who bought into the Trump lies that COVID is political, that masks don't work, it's "just a flu." So simple--wear a mask, distance, wash hands. He would still be with us today had he not believed denying COVID/CDC was supporting Trump
I saw.  Would never happen because the paper would spontaneously combust.  TG trump didn't attend. No one needed to sully these beautiful tributes to John Lewis.
Don't ever ask or expect a Republican Senator or Representative to speak out vs trump's rantings
The Trump Tulsa campaign rally killed Herman Cain. Gotta love it.
It's good he's not there because the last thing we need is 1) the focus being less on Mr. Lewis and more about how Trump will act and 2) the media chomping at the bit to give him credit for something, anything.
Sad when anyone dies from Covid but when you actively dismiss the danger and ridicule masks, life comes at you pretty fast.  This deleted tweet didn't age well ‚ÄòMasks will not be mandatory at the event, which will be attended by President Trump. PEOPLE ARE FED UP!"
As Rep. J Lewis is remembered at funeral w Pres Obama, Bush &amp; Clinton in attendance, Trump spouts disinformation about mail-in voting, endorses pizza from Patio Pizza, again says he will 'massively' lower drug prices, complains about  etc. He is desperate.
could start a war or topple a dictator but Trump is dovish on that. To be fair Scott. Republicans talking about education and doing things about it the way they want to usually ends up looking just as bad when they talk about planned parenthood or roe vs wase. Losing proposition
‚ÄòAnother sign he has lost touch with reality,‚Äô  elected in anti-Trump wave in 2017, says of
Black people that support trump need to be drug tested....or have psych evaluation.
That's true, but I don't understand how voting for Trump helps get DeBlasio out of office.
How does voting for Trump do that if anything it will push Blue States and cities further to the left.
Attending a trump rally without a mask and then dying in a hospital where none of my family can visit me to own the libs
The GOP is a traitorous organization. Some of you took Russian money for your campaigns. You are as guilty as Trump. You are the party that supports a traitor, a liar, a criminal &amp; a sexual predator. You support a man who lied &amp; denied the Trump Virus. How do you live with that?
If y‚Äôall support anything trump has his name behind I hope you get them Forrest Whitaker‚Äôs on the back of yo neck! Seriously
Herman Cain dies after being hospitalized for COVID-19 - Business Insider -  #COVID19 #tcot #p2 #p21 #Trump
Trump is the chaos president. GOP is the leader of voting suppression. The GOP will be defeated soundly in Nov. Trump is done. He has proven himself to be inept at his job. He‚Äôs a liar and a traitor &amp; the GOP has supported him throughout. Trump will lose &amp; deservedly so. Traitor.
Virginia‚Äôs governor and two U.S. senators have urged President Trump to respond to the nation‚Äôs worst coronavirus outbreak that has occurred inside an immigrant detention center in Farmville.
If you truly can't stand Biden there is always staying home. Voting for Trump will only empower people like McConnell who made the 2005 Bankruptcy Bill possible and will do nothing to change it.
"I understand the point about not getting too overhyped about polling, but think about this for a second: Let's say Trump was LEADING in the polls and Biden's numbers were terrible. The talking points would be VERY different right about now."
NO, he is supporting big business, mainly his own, others are merely collatoral gains. Small business got a very, very, very small percentage of help from #GOP and Trump's stimulus.  And big business didn't use it to retain employees as they were required to. Call in the "loans"
If you're still angry at Trump for being orange and not for his grotesque policies and human rights violations, then you're probably not that much better. I can't believe after everything he's done you're still angry at his tiny hands and orange skin. Who cares?
You‚Äôre a trump supporter. Anything you have to say is invalid
UPDATE-  and   request a CDC team be sent to the Farmville ICE detention center. Nearly 93% of detainees are COVID-19 positive.

Lol.  He went to Trump‚Äôs Tulsa suoerspreader without a mask.  Like you care...
Period hope Trump knows I hate him and his administration can go be racist, homophobic and sexist somewhere else
Wanna say i did it me Trump member me your President hey over hea
Too bad he didn‚Äôt wear a mask. Trump told him not too wear a mask. It would look bad for Trump. Cain gave his life for Trump. The GOP allowed Trump to become president. Trump is a traitor &amp; a liar. You all have blood on your hands.
You do understand that trump and his core couldn‚Äôt care less about our laws and constitution.
You would think so but then again they are Republicans with Trump derangement syndrome. They all deranged af!
We can reopen schools completely, but can‚Äôt do one day of elections in November. Trump is desperate.
So #Trump wants the presidential elections postponed because of alleged unproven mail voting scams. Wonder if hes running scared and realises his time is up. Then again knowing what was voted for last time - maybe not!
Don't be distracted by #TrumpTrash acting like he can delay the election (he can't,     but take NOTE of the real issues in America:
And mr potato head speaks again, trump, a shameful representative of the USA
Trumps administration got me realizing that I don‚Äôt truly hate Republicans. I disagree with them on a lot of things but never hate. But trump my god I hate that fucking prick.
Northam, Virginia‚Äôs senators urge Trump to send CDC team to immigrant detention center in Farmville  #Virginia
The only reason HCQ is still a topic is because Trump jumped on it way too early and now his base wants to vindicate him as being correct.
The real question is the same as in every tinpot banana republic (which we are now) that is who or what is the military loyal to? If it‚Äôs tRump then we are done, if not.....
Does anyone else think that the #boycottfacebook movement is really a partisan attack against Trump supporters?
Herman Cain was adamant that masks were unnecessary when he attended Trump's Tulsa rally.  He was diagnosed COVID-19 shortly thereafter. Today, he's dead.  I would normally have sympathy for the dead. Normally.  Herman Cain killed himself.
Trump murdered 150k Americans. Believe that.
Trump never said he was happy Congressman Lewis died.
The Herman Cain news reminded me of this story from April. Trump is leading his followers off a cliff in real time.
Herman Cain went to a Trump rally...  And fuckin DIED!???
You support a traitor, a criminal, sexual predator and a LIAR. Fox will never be regarded w/respect  until you start telling the truth. Trump is a danger to our country. He stood in front of the whole world &amp; said that he believed Putin over our own intelligence agencies. Traitor
Meanwhile, not one more family is suddenly able to put food on the table or one more person is able to avoid COVID because of Trump's election day tweet.  But it's gonna hold the headlines and we're going to be told to be outraged one way or another.
But we'll see five says of breathless coverage of "Trump calls for election delay!" and talking heads arguing with each other and people putting elected officials on the spot in attempted gotcha moments.
Of course, they won't. Trump is "above" the law...LMAO...But he's not above GOD! The 2nd resurrection awaits him.  #TrumpIsAnIdiot
Trump's inane ramblings about delaying the election have successfully pushed the worst GDP drop in history off the metaphorical front page. I'd say well played, but you don't need to be good to manipulate the US media. Even an idiot like Trump can do it.
Even Trump Presidency has side effects - it drives the left crazy.
Trump always operates under the art of the deal.  This is no different.   And Democrats take the bait.  Every. Time.
8:46am - Trump tweets "Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???" - a decision he has no control over.  Two hours later - U.S. posts -32.9% annualized GDP collapse for Q2 2020.  Guess what's grabbing headlines?
The GOP's and Trump not so secret kink.
He still destroyed our public school system, made it cool for the government to spy on ppl, tanked the economy worst then trump, and got us into wars for no reason that made everything horrible. He gets no passes for his presidency
It was almost predetermined that Trump would tweet out something about voter suppression on the day of John Lewis‚Äôs funeral. #WeWillVote
Absolutely #WeWillVote out Trump
Bruh I feel terrible for chuckling at that man passing but the irony in it all...Herman Cain literally died on the Trump no mask hill..just not the hill to die on
After stomping on the Constitution and every other Democratic norm, now Trump wants to delay Election Day. It‚Äôs what a dictator does - an indefinite delay the length of which would be determined by Trump of course. He‚Äôs not done fleecing America.
When all but three of the diseases you list were contained before Obama was even elected and you use worldwide deaths instead of US only, you know you fucking lost.   Real total for 3 diseases over 8 years: ~12002  Trump extrapolates to over 300,000 dead in the same amount time
REMINDER: During the Wallace interview 7/19, Trump said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre signing a healthcare plan WITHIN 2 weeks, a full &amp; complete healthcare plan that the supreme court decision on DACA gave me the right to do."   Aug 2 is 2 wks, so let's see what he says  by Fri 7/31...bets? will be 0
Things Trump wants to distract from with his empty threats to delay the election:  - The rising Covid death toll that just passed 150,000 - The worst decline in US GDP ever  - Republicans letting unemployment benefits expire  We're voting him out on November 3. Period.
We mail taxes, gift cards, and the Hope Diamond by mail safely, but mail in ballots, unless you‚Äôre trump, is unsafe. Horseshit.
Every racist white person always retweets his awful ass like see, black people love Trump üò©üò©
So Herman Cain sacrificed himself for Trump. Cool.
This is one funeral Trump will attend.
Putting your faith in trump is putting your faith in death. You May want to have an unnecessary death but that‚Äôs none of my business.
Donald Trump‚Äôs presidency has been like taking a true/false test where all the answers are false
I like your optimism that things will work the way they were designed but I‚Äôm with  - Trump may be crazy but he‚Äôs crazy like a fox. Don‚Äôt underestimate him.
Some might look at these headlines and infer that Donald Trump literally killed the Republican Party.
Herman Caine probably caught Covid at Trump's Tulsa rally.  Hope the President is thinking about that today - but doubt it.
Trump Virus, you alone own this Virus
Black man denies the seriousness of Coronavirus and died after getting sick from a Trump rally?
You‚Äôve already had one Trump. Now it‚Äôs our turn...unfortunately.
Or. Trump is trying to distract from the horrible economic news and the death of Cain. It is a distraction. Focus on the immediate news of the day.
Joe Biden in April: Trump is probably going to try and delay the election to avoid an embarrassing loss  Republicans: Joe Biden is lying and and trying to incite fear  Trump: should we delay elections???  Republicans: ü§êüò∂üôà
It's so sad. Any time cults or extremists get their victims killed. How he could have followed Trump I'll never understand
Thank you for continuing to speak out. It's a disgrace what Trump and Pompeo have done to the State dept., stripping it of decades and decades of institutional knowledge. "The deep state" is a monstrous lie perpetuated on the American people by deeply compromised bad actors.
Will Democrats unequivocally accept 2020 election results even if mr. Trump gets re-elected? Will you? Or you will form some resistance like you did in 2016?
Good article in  by Adam Jortner  on Trump, antisemitism, and rumor:
Trump.. i didnt know him that well
Will Democrats unequivocally accept 2020 election results even if Trump gets re-elected? Will you? Or you will form some resistance like you did in 2016?
2016 REPUBLICANS: "Obama's gonna declare martial law and cancel the election!  That's terrible!"  2020 REPUBLICANS: "Trump's gonna declare martial law and cancel the election!  That's awesome!"
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
What say you  Too busy? I wonder how much of VA-1, one of the most heavily military and veteran populated districts in the country, votes by mail? I bet they want to make sure their vote counts. Constitution or Trump? You can‚Äôt have both anymore. #LincolnProject

Trump is going out of his way to achieve Vlad Putin‚Äôs goal of weakening Western Europe and creating chaos amongts the allies. The turncloak contrarian republican party is enabling this.

Yep. If Trump has a lead based on in-person votes, SCOTUS is just going to say don‚Äôt count the mail-ins or some crap.

That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. Biden will be a great president. He'll undo the horror that Trump has us in.
If Twitter doesn't lock trump out because of his latest outrageous statement about Nov, what good is their overview on inflammatory statements?
I don't hate him but I do disagree with his philosophy.  Biden is the only one who can defeat Trump.
There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud through mail-in voting, even in states with all-mail votes.

In r√©ponse to Trump...I am calling for moving the November elections up to the 2nd Tuesday in Sept. Let's getting the voting over before Covid takes off again in the fall &amp; let's just get this over with!
Democrats control the House of Representatives, and it's unlikely that they will vote to move the election at the behest of President Trump.
President Trump is proposing we break the law. Congress needs to push back immediately and end this now.   I think this has more to do with the poor economic numbers. Distraction?

We can't allow a wanna-be despot to seize absolute power in a nation built for the very purpose of avoiding tyranny. Trump will stop at nothing to stay in the White House &amp; continues to prove he can and will respond to "You can't do that" with "Watch me!"

Curious to see if trump's poll # continue to plummet, and if it can be tied to this ridiculous statement. I believe most suburbanites are horrified by this latest salvo to retain his base. I kind of need to believe most of us are outraged by his hurtful, racist actions.
Haha! just seen a crazy Trump supporter (maga bumper stickers all over his raggedy truck) get kicked out of a store because the idiot refused to wear a mask (mask signs on the door). Then asked the worker if she knew anyone who died from it? Smh

Only the privileged #SuburbsForBiden voted for him. Just kno u condemned the poor to die. I hope ur proud of yourselves. Prolly some #NeverBiden ppl that #Trump turned to him going right back to #NeverBiden lol
Trammell¬†also supported the Black Lives Matter movement and progressive Democrat Lena Taylor in her run for mayor. So if the conspiracy angle is what you are pushing it could go either way. or more than likely it is just a horrible crime
This kind of naked corruption is beyond anything even Nixon did. I won't accept it as normal. Nixon also had the benefit of being competent. Trump has mismanaged one of the worst crisis in this nation's history, and there's no indication he'll do better with the recovery.
I'm sorry to hear that. The bill passed with overwhelming Republican support from people like Mitch McConnell who have had tremendous power under Trump. Biden has endorsed Sen. Warren's bankruptcy reform plan. I haven't heard anything from Trump on this.
I voted for Warren in the primary and she will have a lot more influence in  Biden administration than a Trump one.

I think the sad part happens to be your weird belief that anything is wrong with him. I mean, I get it, Trump has absolutely no redeeming qualities and the intellectual fortitude of a gnat. So this is your only play, I truly understand. :)

OH MY GOD.  I‚Äôve seen tweets abt postal workers saying the mail was backing up &amp; was dubious..this crisis is being MANUFACTURED by Trump‚Äôs cronies!  Postal Service backlog sparks worries that ballot delivery could be delayed in Nov
Total set up for failure. Go, Trump. Typical.
Susan, you‚Äôre going down! You suck up to Trump, although some things ‚Äúconcern‚Äù you. He didn‚Äôt learn his lesson, but you‚Äôre about to learn yours. Buh bye. Don‚Äôt let Trump hit you in the ass on your way out.
Top story: Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That‚Äôs Unconstitutional.  see more
All of this is out of Trump‚Äôs control. This is an issue with congress and our government as a whole. Quit blaming shit on trump when he has nothing to do with it. Again you have presented zero facts on how trump isn‚Äôt a good candidate and instead continue to bash him.
wow, the article said absolutely nothing about why Trump was wrong.. makes me think he is right in this case
You have to remember who we are dealing with. Trump keeping stating mail in voting would be rigged. Come on America all that he said about Hilary , He was telling what he was doing. Now here's my question? Who is in charge of the USPS ,and think about who put him in that position
üòä  DOE recovered $200M of taxpayer üí∞ from the bogus $1Billion cash ‚Äúloan‚Äù Obama gave to solyndra #winning #TRUMP2020    via
What even is Trump‚Äôs best? I don‚Äôt think he has one. Isn‚Äôt  his wife‚Äôs motto Be Best. Should have started with her husband. Another epic fail.
Actually trump has created a better life for many people of every race. Why is race even brought into this. That‚Äôs why racism continues to become a problem in issues because you bring it up.
I have nothing nice to say about him. He was a sexual pervert. He enabled a sexual pervert Donald Trump. He spoke badly about people wearing masks during a pandemic, then suffering death himself. He got what he deserved‚Äîrotten hell Uncle Tom!
Oh I read it correctly, it just doesn‚Äôt make sense lmao. What will Biden give back? Trump has lowered unemployment, created jobs, the list goes on he is continually giving back to us. If you disagree I‚Äôd like to see the facts as to how he has taken away from society.
This is a real thing. I‚Äôve had a few packages sit in a Greeneville SC postal facility as long as two weeks. Never happened until Trump crony became postmaster.
Wrong answer. The established #asshat democrats started the culture war when Trump the outsider became president, because he‚Äôs running the country as a business, not as a politician. They vowed to impeach BEFORE the election. #fail #dweeb
TRIGGERED: MSNBC Hosts Melt Down Over Black Trump Supporters  via
Poor Mike Singletary. üò¢  Maybe someone should have warned him that everything Trump touches dies
And to try to continue his totalitarian rule. We will not have it!  Out, out, damn Trump!
I call BS.... they jumping bc trump not sharing the campaign money ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
The eye of the storm that is Trump is that he sincerely believes his interests are the national interests, de facto. The rest is circumstantial.
After living with the #TrumpVirus for the last 3 1‚ÅÑ2 years, we should change the motto to *God Help Us*. Because, as we face the inevitable rebuilding of America, it's gonna take a whole lot more than "Trust" to fix what Trump broke, it's gonna take a *Divine Miracle*!
I still think Trump will attempt to impose martial law at some point.
Mr President Trump, As a proud American and an Navy Veteran, I would love to thank you for your duty sir. Only a true American would do what you do for free! We can‚Äôt thank you enough. But I would like to tell you, no mail in voting. Democrats are going to rig it, you know it.
You have accomplished nothing in your life compared to Trump. WTF ?
New postal service head. Trump donor.
I can absolutely imagine Trump speaking at Herman Cain‚Äôs funeral.
U mean the same farmers that voted for trump and took welfare checks
Just say you have no good reason as to why Biden is the better candidate without bashing trump and his supporters.
Fucken asshole !! He didn‚Äôt have to die if trump didn‚Äôt have the rally !!!! Fucken period and facts
Trump goes flat out on all the issues that will lead to fascism and American degradation. It‚Äôs called Thursday.  Me and Sen Collins are holding our breath for a pivot on Friday.
Pretty much me when trump lie everyday!!
I never stated that a counter attack violated the War Powers Act, as long as proper notice is given.  A social media account, even if owned by the President, does not carry the same weight as an official document, notice, or EO. However, Trump seems to think otherwise.
Make no mistake, this is a hate crime inspired and encouraged by Trump's racist rhetoric on the Coronavirus.
please give me five good reasons how Biden is better without bashing Trump, because trust me nobody believes he‚Äôs the better choice. Trump has done far more for Americans than Biden has in his 30+ years of office. if he can make America better why hasn‚Äôt he tried to already?
Trump is directly responsible for this hate crime.
I have to explain why geographers care more about plants than animals, and I just keep reverting to Trump verbiage:  Plants are really, really great. All they do is win. We should all study plants. No one likes animals‚Äîthey are loooosers.  I‚Äôll be here all week. #sleepdeprived
Americans - real Americans - do not live in fear! This country was built by people who took great risks! üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
Are you seriously talking about a ‚Äúpeaceful‚Äù transfer of power? Obama and his minions illegally spied on Trump, liberals still haven‚Äôt accepted the 2016 election results almost four years later... don‚Äôt even get me started on the Constitution.
Co founder of the federalist calls trump out for his fascist tweet, asserts its grounds for impeachment.   I agree
Just think about what Soros will do when Trump wins again... you think it‚Äôs bad now?
Full grown man did what the fuck HE WANTED, trump didnt force him to come, and there is no proof he got it from there, people have free fucking will
Fearing Trump interference, FBI agents hid copies of Russia investigation docs
Trump's ICE thugs are at it again.
If Trump thinks the schools should be open for kids then I guess they should be open to vote duh!!!!
According to Trump, there is no emergency, remember he wants the kids back in school ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I'm definitely *NOT* a  cult member who believes *EVERY* single lie our  tells them and I'm not a spineless Republican.  I'm definitely not stupid enough to believe the over 20,000 lies Trump has told since taking office as I'm way smarter than that... .
That's true...because you can't hold a thought long enough to put a tweet together. It's Sad man, you can't even read from  a teleprompter without screwing it up. "Crimate Clisis" what the heck is that? And you're the best they have? ü§£üòÇ Silent Majority ü§´...Trump wins Easily.
Worst President ever! I gave him 8years and voting for him twice. Worst thing I‚Äôve ever done. Hillary was the icing on the cake. Screw the Democrats. I‚Äôm voting for Trump again. Trump 2020
Not to mention the never ending headache of What the hell is Trump talking about? Planes during the Revolution war?
I don't know...  I do know that  hasn't finished his physical and according to a friend of mine, our  has instructed people not to release the results of what has been completed until AFTER the election. Which leads to ask... what is Trump hiding... ü§î
Ah Melissa...ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Trump has absolutely ZERO authority to change the Election date, it IS UNconstitutional and ONLY Congress can make the call, even Republican leadership in the Senate says it will remain November 3rd, delete your tweet. You‚Äôre spreading misinformation AGAIN.
Maybe trump should be secluded (detained?) during the election results until Biden emerges as the clear winner...
We can at least negotiate better terms, Trump gets you nothing and maybe worse

Just because the media says President Trump is racist doesn‚Äôt make him a racist.
What is your point? Trump uses press conferences to attack people.
Despicable Worst POTUS Ever Obama Sinks To A New Low By Using A Funeral As A Political Platform. It's Always About Themselves &amp; No One Else. Democrats blast President Trump for tweet about changing election date
What is your point? Trump uses press conferences to attack people.
I‚Äôm wishing for a safe way to organize 155k human beings to lie down, properly spaced in one location such that Trump could get a real look at what that number represents in terms of bodies/people.  Who can help me?  Farm land property?  Ariel photo! #covid
it‚Äôs very likely Trump doesn‚Äôt even understand why he is undermining the Democracy!   Probable he has no knowledge of what that even means.  I keep waiting for a reporter to ask him a question like that.  What is a democracy to you Mr. Trump?#TrumpThreatensAmerica
So was Trump's but that didn't matter to Socialists who serve Satan. They want America to fall so then all nations will go against Israel as foretold in Revelations.
Those who serve on the side of evil will always promote evil. Praise God for men like you and Trump.
Next to Trump, he sounds like Alexander Hamilton.
With who? Bernie? He was leading before he dropped. But, honestly, they are probably just hoping for Trump to step in it.
President Trump holds White House news conference
Have you noticed in the last few days it Trump is walking in an unusual manner. Head down, shoulders slumped.
By this time tomorrow, he'll be claiming he never even said it. Bonus points if he uses the words "fake news" for anyone who reports that he said it.
It sounds like he was a good man. A good man is willing to revisit his mistakes. A good man listens to experts. Why he didn't take the advice of experts to mask up at Trump's rally is unknown, but I place a huge onus on Trump himself. Trump is a failure and complicit as HELL.
Start the process right after Congress's vacation. !!!!  I'm mad as hell and am NOT going to take it anymore!!! Trump's a charlatan, tax cheat, liar, law breaker...WHY IS HE STILL HERE???!!!?? Oh, yeh, thanks a hell of a lot, Republican WIMPS!!
President Trump told Congress that if it should arise he will notify them of a Declaration of war with Iran via his social media account, bypassing the War Powers Act of 1973.   A Declaration of war without Congressional approval, by definition, is an Executive order.
Don't put Donald Trump in the White House for another four years.  Put him in the toilet instead.
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Trump is a Clown.
Honestly though Parris, we can't even get FB and Twitter to remove Trump's racist tweets. Hate speech isn't seen as a priority by powerful white men in charge of social media platforms. Why? 1. Because what the consumer does doesn't effect them. 2. Hate speech traffic is still
Lmaoooo lets see what trump says about this üòÇ the NBA players don‚Äôt give a fuck if he‚Äôs the president
Trump distraction is working   The media took the bait. The economy is not the headline tonight.
Wait Trump ACTUALLY wants to delay the election?! Is he scared or something?
Facts check again!!!! Election is on November 3rd trump CAN NOT DELAY IT!!!!
And Herman Cain‚Äôs last public appearance before coming down with the Coronavirus was ...‚ÄùCain, the co-chairman of Black Voices for Trump, attended the president‚Äôs rally in Tulsa without a mask on June 20.‚Äù SOURCE FOX NEWS
Trump must hate how far he falls short of Obama as a leader and a Man.
You must be a trump supporter üòÇ. I literally showed u evidence of athletes referring to other male athletes by their number. If it‚Äôs right for them it‚Äôs right for the women
Trump is a mass murderer.

Trump is a danger to the public.
I don‚Äôt LIKE TRUMP!! Period
Just FYI over 40 million people voted by mail in 2016 and guess what it was republican states. Trump is tying to sow doubt in the outcome of he doesn‚Äôt win. He will try to litigate this to keep power. Mail in voting will he needed. If republicans cough up money
Maybe this one? ;)
No, it's YOUR fault, Trump.
Trump Floats Delaying The Election. It Would Require A Change In Law
Yes Trump team, getting him back in front of cameras will be great for his poll numbers. Bwahahahahahahahaha
The WHPC allowing Trump to spread lies and propaganda with no pushback.
Trump just now speaking about the resurgence of coronavirus as outlined in the Washington post: It‚Äôs just one of those things‚Ä¶ It didn‚Äôt work out so well.‚Äù #TrumpVirusDeathToll150K

Donald Trump want to send our kids back to School with out PPE. but want to move the Vote Day..  Donald Trump Stop lying you Vote by mail and your Family.
Yes, I know Olsen denounces Trump today and acknowledges that he criticized Biden - but he never actually apologizes to Biden.
Abandon Trump. If you have any sense at all. Burn your MAGA hats too.
Go to hell, Trump.
Donald Trump Needs To Stop lying Demcrats already pass the house bill , Republicans don't want it they said Demcrats give the American People too much money.
The feckless WHPC needs to call Trump a liar to his face.

Let's cut through all of the bullshit, this is what trump's really telling us...  #TrumpVirus #TrumpTraitor #Trump #TrumpHasNoCredibility #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
Trump rationalizing the number of Coronavirus deaths is vile.
Wtf!! This is trump fucken doing!!
Trump &amp; our current federal government r useless,
Trump just said he was sorry for the 150 thousand people that have died from coronavirus that‚Äôs the first inkling that he knows he‚Äôs in deep water or in deep shit and has to try to turn the tide.
Trump gets some support from above
Trump, you‚Äôre  about to lose your job! 11/03/2020
Hey! Mexico didn‚Äôt pay for it! Not even his buddies but Taxpayers did.
Yassssss!! This is trump being blankly racist üò°
Hey did you see what 0bammy did from the time Trump won until he took office? He used federal agencies to spy on US citizens. Good times. To be fair, he did it before Trump beat the snot out of Hildog too.
I actually think it started with indoctrinating our kids in universities from socialist teachers of which are very prevalent in these institutions as they couldn‚Äôt get a job anywhere else. But sure let‚Äôs blame trump. No different than the media Mark.
The USA suffers worst quarter plumbing ever as covid 19 surge and trump is talking about moving the fucken election üò≥!! Not even gonna happen I will stay in line 72 hours to vote his dump ass out of the WH! Period and Facts
Do not forget that this happened only months ago
Or we could remind voters that they have to vote on Election Day no matter what trump trumps up. Full stop. Barrage all communications with the vote and the date. No excuses. No do overs.
If Trump was watching the #JohnLewisMemorial during President Obama's eulogy I'm sure all he heard was, "You like me! You really like me!".  #ObamaWasBetterAtEverything
And trump  talking bout voting needs to be push back on this day  is so respectful. Sthu   John Lewis wouldn't  have it any other way
I'm actually tired of seeing you tweet... and to Lazy to block you just go away already. Nobody likes tRump but you so go on his page and kiss his hind parts some more with like minded baffons as yourself. Adults are speaking here go away
Delay voting. Trump tweeted this to distract from the fact that ‚ÄúThe U.S. economy shrank 9.5 percent from April through June, the largest quarterly decline since the government began publishing data 70 years ago‚Äù
But he was fine with Trump dumping on our intelligence community in a press conference with Putin. And he was fine with neo nazis being called very fine people. Guy has a strange idea of Americanism.
Anyone who's honest with themselves should agree.  The DNC should not want him debating... especially against Trump who loves to talk.
Yes we are...now everyone get out and vote...Trump 2020!
Oh Lindsey what the hell does Trump hold over your head?
Trump thinks if he can delay the election they‚Äôll find a cure for the virus and the economy will go back up and that will make people want to vote for him. He will do anything to prove he can win.
Poor Bev needs a safe space.....again. God Bless and remember President Trump is and always will be your President.
There are people that voted for Trump out of loyalty to their party and it got them killed during this pandemic. Did anyone really think that if a crisis ever hit the trump era that man would step up to the plate? Elections matter. Vote.
‚ñ™We are NOT winning the fight against COVID-19!  ‚ñ™It's NOT safe to attend a crowded rally‚Äîwith, or without a mask!  ‚ñ™It's sad (but NOT surprising) that a 74yr-old man, who was immunocompromised, died from COVID-19 after attending a Trump Rally, where he did NOT wear a mask!
Why don‚Äôt you tell us about all those Trump hotel deals you‚Äôve gotten done since Daddy‚Äôs been President first??
I don't know if I would honestly go that far respectfully, but I do think he is not helping anything right now by the language that he is using...just like I agree that Trump doesn't help with some of the language that he uses.
Appeals court will reconsider order to dismiss criminal case of former Trump aide Michael Flynn
Ummm, which polls is trump trailing in?
Such class. Or blasphemy

The cure for Covid might not exist yet. But the cure for Donald Trump sure as shit does. A kick in the ass with the iron boot, right out of the White House gates.
Oh #WeWillVote all right. In person on November 3rd or earlier if voting by mail. Trump is absolutely terrified.
I hate him so much i did not watch. Did he go after Trump?
Hay Jules. I know a snowflake when I hear one. Hope you like 4 more years of TRUMP!
Nothing Donald Trump orders should be implemented before the election, and not implemented when he loses!!!!!
Let's talk about Trump's call to suspend the elections....  via
has now jumped on the lie bandwagon. Forget that  was battling stage 4 cancer. All that matters was that he attended a Donald Trump rally. At some point everybody's going to get fed up with these lies.
I check every statement. Never had the real gains until Trump‚Äôs policies took hold.
Seeing kids develop the necessary skills for the next level should trump winning ...
It‚Äôs so obvious Obama is just itching to go to war with Trump while on the campaign trail for Biden, and I am here for ALL of it. üòé #ObamaEulogy
Trump's ego.
BUT you are you?! U ran from the liberal plantation fields to the republican kitchen to serve master his supper. Joe Biden and Donald Trump are the exact same. both are racist and sexual predators(one admitted on tape he sexually assaults women). be independent. #notwopartyshills
I‚Äôd be game, as long as we don‚Äôt discuss politics. Unbelievable you think  is a better option than   I‚Äôm a fiscal conservative, my 401k has gained $32k since January. Consistently positive since Trump‚Äôs policies took effect.
I would like to see no MAIL IN VOTING! Just a way these EVIL DEMOCRATS could sabotage the election. TRUMP 2020!!!!! And any other Republican on the ballot!
Chad seems to be full of Trump‚Äôs demon semen.
Wow! Trump‚Äôs Tulsa Rally is to blame. ‚Å¶ is a murderer.
Honest question: If COVID is curable with HCQ, and all of trump land knows this, why did Herman Cain have to die? Why didn‚Äôt he take HCQ w/ z-pack and zinc and cure himself? He had the resources to get it. Did he want to die, or is HCQ overhyped?
This reminds me of a passage in Mary Trump‚Äôs book about when Fred Sr. would wear a wig and dye his eyebrows &amp; mustache magenta!! His brain was on its way out...
They Love ‚ÄúLatinos for Trump‚Äù and ‚ÄúBlacks for Trump‚Äù it‚Äôs all about power and money, they talk about Liberals controlling our minds but yet THEY seek to influence Black and Latino voters to believe in the same radical ideals as them which is a threat towards their communities.
Trump doesn't have the authority to change the date of the election.  Nor does DOJ, Pompeo.  Only Congress does.
Mitch McConnell, Chuck Grassley, and Lindsey Graham *all*  say the election can't be delayed. Even if sitting behind the resolute desk, that's still gotta sting...and I'm okay with that.
This tweet of course comes AFTER Obama's moving eulogy to Rep John Lewis today.  Whenever Trump tries to be presidential, he simply imitates Obama and never even comes close to measuring up.
Obama, eulogizing John Lewis, takes aim at Trump over voting rights, protest response  via
Trump can't change the date of the election.  Only Congress can do that
Donald Trump is an idiot. Can‚Äôt just postpone an election. Come on man we are in a modern day dictatorship.  needs to be elected.
Nah how about you leave folks who have different views than you alone, plus I don‚Äôt buy that you‚Äôre not a Trump voter, Ain‚Äôt no way in the world you have a bunch of MAGA idiots following you and you don‚Äôt support a Trump in any fashion.
Donald Trump just lost the last talking point he had for the election: conservative columnist -
It's Evident Biden Is Confused But Real Americans Are Not. We Dont Want A Demented Socialist Racist Running Our Nation. Socialism Doesn't Work For The People It Enslaves Them. Keep America Free, Keep Trump!üá∫üá∏
Trump campaign reaches $2 million in unpaid security bills just as Mike Pence rallies with cops -
Fortunately, there are other Republicans who know the score...
We the people will not stand by and let Trump destroy the very fabric of this country. November 3rd is our time to elect a president that represents all the people.
RIP. You should have put on a mask! How many Trump supporters and emps have contacted COVID?
What we saw today was the good America, the kind America, the caring America....the exact opposite of Trump‚Äôs America.
Bummer. Karma, ya know. Trump can take credit for another death.

The man had cancer and in his 70s  Stop the false narrative  if the man wanted to die of coronavirus which he did not! So be it we have the right to die how we want   stop speaking up for the rest of Americans!   Go find your goggles and get off of President Trump‚Äôs page! Shill

But you won't vote because Biden and Trump are the same?  Isn't this how we got Trump 4 years ago? Are you better off now than you were 4 years ago?  Explain to me this smart dumb shit of not voting for the lesser of two evils lol.
It's Simple because it's not true. Trump brought Black unemployment to a historical low, Regan didn't nor did Obama, or Clinton.
Bombs of shit-  lies and deceit !   He has you guys so fooled in all the evil that he has done with Iraq and Iran none of you will ever acknowledge   if he wanted vote by mail so bad he could‚Äôve done it!  They blame trump - they can‚Äôt let it go! Projection not the president Obama

That‚Äôs fine. I mean if we do not get behind trump that‚Äôs what‚Äôs coming to America.
Vanessa Guillen's family deserved better than to be used by Trump like that.
Fuck NO! They will continue to follow trump and ALL will die of stupid !!
And as Trump tweets in support of a delayed election. Republican style.
Now there a real leader!!! Look trump look in the mirror u traitor amd see what your not
This is what honor smells like it's an american value and we all know who is not there Vladimir trump

Black lives my needs and practice civilian disobedient to defeat the message that trump supporter is trying to get out and you guys
President Trump floats idea of delaying November election
President Obama is speaking. Ignore Trump.
So not like a leader ever! Trump is a business man, a leader by nature. What did  lead before becoming POTUS? A senator is not a leader but a representative.
How can the Party be "reformed" with people, who would not stand up to Trump, still leading it....that is not reform it is just waiting for a smart authoritarian to come along to lead them towards the destruction of democracy
Pretty Brazen To Support A Racist Such As Biden.  Who Used The FBI To Spy &amp; Then Lie About Trump Colluding With Russia. No true American Can Blame Trump For Being Concerned About Dems Dirty Dealings With Votes. You Want To Legally Allow Illegals To Vote. You Corrupt Our System.
Two Term Trump Presidency = 2020‚Äôs 9/11 is my guess
I feel like that's a stretch to blame Trump for this one.
I have not put on a mask yet and do not plan on wearing one ever. All Trump did by wearing one was remove politics from the great mask debate, now it is based on personal research, choice, and freedom to choose.
So you‚Äôre ok with Trump just saying ‚Äúscrew it, I‚Äôm dictator?‚Äù That‚Äôs what you‚Äôre supporting.
Everyone don't forget that the president supports Dr. Immanuel's theories LMAO!!!!  All my Trump Supporters on this feed, please defend this guy or are you too embarrassed? #MADA-Make America Dumb Again.
Trump doesn't give a shit.
Do not tune into whatever nonsense Trump does today. It is John Lewis' day.
Trump and most of the GOP vote by mail and have been for years. Get ready to lose.
Cops For Trump has all the little bitches on twitter shitting themselves  So if all cops are bad....  All black people are bad right?  All Mexicans?  All immigrants?  All white people?  All men?  All women?  All the democrats?  All the republicans?
Trump using the family of Vanessa Guillen as a photo-op during the funeral of John Lewis. What a vile scumbag.
If you support Donald Trump, you support a 1 ton toddler twat, a colossal crybaby, and a dizzy dipshit. I pity you for betting on such a shitty horse. I'm sure you have your reason, pathetic though it must be. But as far as I'm concerned your leader can lead you right off a cliff
And would be alive today if he didn‚Äôt go to a Trump rally. Now that is just plain sad üòî

the Internet worked for the #Obamacampaign, credited with the first victory utilizing #socialmedia.
Hey, Johnny.  Did you remove your head from Trump's butt long enough to see his tweet this morning?
Watching the funeral of John Lewis &amp; realized that this is the first news show I‚Äôve watched in a long time that makes me feel proud -America‚Äôs tribute to him. This has been done as it should be, by some. The absence of Trump giving him any honor is appalling, but not surprising.
Donald Trump wants to try to postpone the election because he's a pre-emptive sore loser, and he knows the damage he has done to this country will be someone else's mess to clean up. He is incapable of doing the right thing. This has been proven numerous times.
Will we see an ad of Trump eating this pizza backwards, too?
Your Party Started The KKK, &amp; Throughout Our, History Have Done Nothing To Help Black Americans. Trump Has Always Fought For Blacks &amp; Jews. His Businesses Are A Diversity Of Races. He Brought Black Unemployment To An Historical Low. Your Party Created Chaos, Devastation &amp; Ruin.
Here‚Äôs the last photo of Cain, sacrificing his life for a Trump rally.
HOW MANY OF YOU BELIEVE THAT TRUMP IS BEING NICE TO PUTIN, SO THAT HE CAN BUILD TOWERS IN RUSSIA WHEN HE GET OUT OF OFFICE,  LET THAT SINK IN A MINUTE???????  WE NEED HIS TAX RETURNS???????
Trump campaign staff removed the social distancing placards from seats in the arena where Herman Cain likely caught COVID-19. Manslaughter, then?
Trump floats a ‚Äòdelay‚Äô in the election. None of his usual allies are on board.
You Call Yourselves Progressives Yet, You Are Setting America Back. Your Leaders Act Like Hitler &amp; Your Supporters Are Nazis. You've Allowed  &amp; Funded Killings Of Hundreds Of Americans Including Children. No Real American Wants Commies To Run Our Nation. Trump Will Keep Us Free.

Herman Cain, a minority, going to a Trump rally where he caught Covid-19, a virus that he tweeted he  was skeptical of then dying from that same virus the following day is literally 2020 in a nutshell.
Just wearing a Trump hat is terrorism there, forget actually having tone violent.
Trump still an ideal and says he thought of it ALL by HIMSELF! This man well not a man make me sick to my stomach!

Which is why Donald Trump and his GOP are trying to suspend US elections and remain in office as a dictator
I'm glad there's 100% proof and physical evidence that this man caught the coronavirus at a Trump rally. Way to keep pushing the hearsay and corroborating the story.
The Trump campaign is guilty of criminal negligence for the death of Herman Cain. They should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

Herman Cain went to the Trump rally in Tulsa and didn't wear a mask or social distance because he thought Covid-19 was a hoax. He caught Covid-19 there and died from Covid-19 today.
Conservative Democrats are just itching for Trump to delay the election just so Pelosi could be president. I hate it here.
Yeah I'd say highly unlikely. Trump isn't self aware enough for this, plus dropping out would stain him equally as if he had lost in a landslide.  I mean the piece is all speculation anyway, so why not ask the question? But this headline, however, could use work

Also, just throwing out my wild theory that Trump‚Äôs hostility to mail in voting may cost him the election. Seems the people most likely to vote by mail are the ones most at risk from Covid, elderly voters.
Proof is, that Trump tweeted it, and I showed you the tweet. How in the possible world is that fake?
Does Donald Trump realise that delaying the election would just result in the Nancy Pelosi being sworn in as President on 20th January, rather than him remaining indefinitely?  Or is it too much to expect him to understand the US Constitution?   Oh yeah, of course it is‚Ä¶
People.  Stop and think.  Why would Trump tweet something that absurd?  So we get mad and talk about it.   Ignore the bombthrowing, they‚Äôre up to something.  Keep your eye on that.
Yes. Trump and Pence's terms expire by law on 1/20/21. Absent a certified successor the job defaults to the Speaker.
The new USPS postmaster inspector general Louis Dejoy(major Trump donor) will cause delays by eliminating over time, stopping late mail trips, and any mail not delivered that day will be sent out next day or days. This will only increase fraud narrative.

Trump tells suburban voters they will 'no longer be bothered' by low-income housing
3-it's unlikely that all of those voters stick with Trump in 2020 or that we see 136k less voters than in 2012. MI's 2018 gubernatorial election had 4.2m votes cast (3m for Gov 2014, 4.5m in 16). Gov Whitmer had exactly 2k less votes than Clinton. I'm nervous, but confident
2-take away the 136k votes that disappeared (and assume that they ALL voted for Obama in 2012), and that means the delta between Obama and Trump's victories is around 350k. So either GOP was extra energized (no evidence), or ~350k voters voted for Trump who voted for Obama in 12.
I don't support Trump.
1-He needs more than 15k in Detroit to not vote. Both candidates received 7k less votes than their party candidate in Oakland Co in 2016 v 2012. Wayne Co was 60k less and MI cast 136k less total votes. The vote shifted nearly 500k, total, to Trump from Obama (who won MI by 450k)

Do not forget that this happened only months ago
Or we could remind voters that they have to vote on Election Day no matter what trump trumps up. Full stop. Barrage all communications with the vote and the date. No excuses. No do overs.
And trump  talking bout voting needs to be push back on this day  is so respectful. Sthu   John Lewis wouldn't  have it any other way
But he was fine with Trump dumping on our intelligence community in a press conference with Putin. And he was fine with neo nazis being called very fine people. Guy has a strange idea of Americanism.
Yes we are...now everyone get out and vote...Trump 2020!
Poor Bev needs a safe space.....again. God Bless and remember President Trump is and always will be your President.
There are people that voted for Trump out of loyalty to their party and it got them killed during this pandemic. Did anyone really think that if a crisis ever hit the trump era that man would step up to the plate? Elections matter. Vote.
Appeals court will reconsider order to dismiss criminal case of former Trump aide Michael Flynn
Let's talk about Trump's call to suspend the elections....  via

It‚Äôs so obvious Obama is just itching to go to war with Trump while on the campaign trail for Biden, and I am here for ALL of it. üòé #ObamaEulogy
I would like to see no MAIL IN VOTING! Just a way these EVIL DEMOCRATS could sabotage the election. TRUMP 2020!!!!! And any other Republican on the ballot!
Chad seems to be full of Trump‚Äôs demon semen.
Honest question: If COVID is curable with HCQ, and all of trump land knows this, why did Herman Cain have to die? Why didn‚Äôt he take HCQ w/ z-pack and zinc and cure himself? He had the resources to get it. Did he want to die, or is HCQ overhyped?
This reminds me of a passage in Mary Trump‚Äôs book about when Fred Sr. would wear a wig and dye his eyebrows &amp; mustache magenta!! His brain was on its way out...
They Love ‚ÄúLatinos for Trump‚Äù and ‚ÄúBlacks for Trump‚Äù it‚Äôs all about power and money, they talk about Liberals controlling our minds but yet THEY seek to influence Black and Latino voters to believe in the same radical ideals as them which is a threat towards their communities.
Mitch McConnell, Chuck Grassley, and Lindsey Graham *all*  say the election can't be delayed. Even if sitting behind the resolute desk, that's still gotta sting...and I'm okay with that.
Donald Trump is an idiot. Can‚Äôt just postpone an election. Come on man we are in a modern day dictatorship.  needs to be elected.
Nah how about you leave folks who have different views than you alone, plus I don‚Äôt buy that you‚Äôre not a Trump voter, Ain‚Äôt no way in the world you have a bunch of MAGA idiots following you and you don‚Äôt support a Trump in any fashion.
It's Evident Biden Is Confused But Real Americans Are Not. We Dont Want A Demented Socialist Racist Running Our Nation. Socialism Doesn't Work For The People It Enslaves Them. Keep America Free, Keep Trump!üá∫üá∏
RIP. You should have put on a mask! How many Trump supporters and emps have contacted COVID?
What we saw today was the good America, the kind America, the caring America....the exact opposite of Trump‚Äôs America.
Bummer. Karma, ya know. Trump can take credit for another death.
Herman Cain died! Could it be he caught covid-19 at the Trump rally??
The only economic numbers that really concern me are those that affect the black community, and Trumps numbers compared to Obama's are night and day. I can point to specific things Trump did that had positive effects on black employment and ultimately black earnings
When Trump leaves in January things will work out for you. IMO
Your First Lady ?? Not mines trump the troll wife
But you won't vote because Biden and Trump are the same?  Isn't this how we got Trump 4 years ago? Are you better off now than you were 4 years ago?  Explain to me this smart dumb shit of not voting for the lesser of two evils lol.
It's Simple because it's not true. Trump brought Black unemployment to a historical low, Regan didn't nor did Obama, or Clinton.
This Trump ad campaign is lit!! üî•üî• üî•üî•
Interesting how I haven't seen a single Trump voter defect for West 2020

Vanessa Guillen's family deserved better than to be used by Trump like that.
Fuck NO! They will continue to follow trump and ALL will die of stupid !!
And as Trump tweets in support of a delayed election. Republican style.
Co workers keep posting SNL jokes, Kamal Harris, and centrist dems ‚Äúquote tweets‚Äù as if neo liberalism isn‚Äôt the core reason why we got trump in the first place.

Pretty Brazen To Support A Racist Such As Biden.  Who Used The FBI To Spy &amp; Then Lie About Trump Colluding With Russia. No true American Can Blame Trump For Being Concerned About Dems Dirty Dealings With Votes. You Want To Legally Allow Illegals To Vote. You Corrupt Our System.
Two Term Trump Presidency = 2020‚Äôs 9/11 is my guess
Everyone don't forget that the president supports Dr. Immanuel's theories LMAO!!!!  All my Trump Supporters on this feed, please defend this guy or are you too embarrassed? #MADA-Make America Dumb Again.
Trump and most of the GOP vote by mail and have been for years. Get ready to lose.

This is not the time to be joking... But then again, it's trump... ü§•ü§î
Your Party Started The KKK, &amp; Throughout Our, History Have Done Nothing To Help Black Americans. Trump Has Always Fought For Blacks &amp; Jews. His Businesses Are A Diversity Of Races. He Brought Black Unemployment To An Historical Low. Your Party Created Chaos, Devastation &amp; Ruin.
Here‚Äôs the last photo of Cain, sacrificing his life for a Trump rally.
HOW MANY OF YOU BELIEVE THAT TRUMP IS BEING NICE TO PUTIN, SO THAT HE CAN BUILD TOWERS IN RUSSIA WHEN HE GET OUT OF OFFICE,  LET THAT SINK IN A MINUTE???????  WE NEED HIS TAX RETURNS???????
You Call Yourselves Progressives Yet, You Are Setting America Back. Your Leaders Act Like Hitler &amp; Your Supporters Are Nazis. You've Allowed  &amp; Funded Killings Of Hundreds Of Americans Including Children. No Real American Wants Commies To Run Our Nation. Trump Will Keep Us Free.
So is Cornyn acknowledging that maybe Trump is trying to distract from other news of the day like an historic GDP plunge?

Trump still an ideal and says he thought of it ALL by HIMSELF! This man well not a man make me sick to my stomach!
My governor coming out against Trump üëèüèª
I'm not saying that this was *definitely* the result of Cain having attended Trump's rally, because I don't think there's any way to say definitively that that IS where he got it, but I'm sure there'll be plenty of others who'll happily say it anyway.
I wonder what nickname Nancy Pelosi will come up with next for Trump after he said he would cancel the November election? Mr. I Keep Doing Fascist Things And Yet The Democrats Enable Me.
Omg! I'm reeling and it's not even noon! Future Trump historians will be asked which WEEK of Trump's presidency they specialize in!!!
I wish Dr. Falsi would make up his mind.
To stop Trump from cheating, demand in-person voting with ID! It's the only way to stop him!
40 days Herman Cain walked through the valley of death, 40 days from his attending the "Spread the Hate and COVID Rally". This tweet didn't even have time to age, much less age poorly. I wonder what the other fine folks are thinking right now? Trump is not worth it people.
To stop Trump from cheating, demand in-person voting with ID! It's the only way to stop him!
The GDP fell a record 32.9%. Trump floated the idea of postponing the elections. Herman Caind died from Covid after not wearing a mask at Trump's Tulsa rally. My God! It's not even noon yet and I'm fvcking dizzy!!!üò≥üò≥üò£üò£
That‚Äôs because u have a conscience. Trump doesn‚Äôt. No soul either.
Which is why Donald Trump and his GOP are trying to suspend US elections and remain in office as a dictator
Wow. This didn‚Äôt age well. But then again, nothing a fascist like trump does ages well. How sad you are so inept at seeing the idiot behind the large tie.
Trump Is Happy to Inform Suburban Voters That He Is Still a Racist  via

At Trump‚Äôs Tulsa rally probably. He was not wearing a mask.
Trump killed this man.
And Trump is? You‚Äôre operating on a different platform.
Conservative Democrats are just itching for Trump to delay the election just so Pelosi could be president. I hate it here.
Yeah I'd say highly unlikely. Trump isn't self aware enough for this, plus dropping out would stain him equally as if he had lost in a landslide.  I mean the piece is all speculation anyway, so why not ask the question? But this headline, however, could use work

President Trump, a suggestion for mail in voting so the chance that the Post Office might lose it could be avoided, have a drop box outside of each polling place that individuals can drop them off curb side.
Well,while Trump is floating delaying the elections, I would like to counter with speeding up the timeline. How‚Äôs August for everyone? Sound good? #DumpTrumpNow
Let's face the truth,  Trump is protecting his interests in Russia.  So he can build REALESTATE there When he leaves office
ARE YOU REGISTERED TO VOTE?!
Let get this troll out !  Pelosi! Get ready. Absent a clear winner of the presidential election on January 20, the Speaker of the House would serve as Acting President under the current succession law. Trump may have to throw out of the WH!!
Trump is dangerous For Americans!
TRUMP IS PROTECTING HIS  RIGHT TO MAKE MONEY IN RUSSIA WHEN HE LEAVE OFFICE,  DAM AMERICA,  MONEY IS HIS GOD
Trump will not be there. He is not welcome.
Proof is, that Trump tweeted it, and I showed you the tweet. How in the possible world is that fake?
Does Donald Trump realise that delaying the election would just result in the Nancy Pelosi being sworn in as President on 20th January, rather than him remaining indefinitely?  Or is it too much to expect him to understand the US Constitution?   Oh yeah, of course it is‚Ä¶
Then say THAT, huge difference between economic contraction and horrible pandemic response.  And that's how Trump and his supporters always turn out right in these arguments because his detectors attack the wrong thing
The new USPS postmaster inspector general Louis Dejoy(major Trump donor) will cause delays by eliminating over time, stopping late mail trips, and any mail not delivered that day will be sent out next day or days. This will only increase fraud narrative.
Republicans are in a dark and racist place with trump supporters carrying guns and ak47 in Michigan talking about hanging and shooting ppl! White privileged has no ideal they are wrong ! But trump don‚Äôt care ! Vote this troll out!
And here we go. What do you want to bet that if Occupant and DisBarr get their way, the election will be "delayed" indefinitely?
Trump is a snake in the grass and in the water ! Vote this fake and dangerous troll out of office! Please

Did you know that Central Park used to be a Black neighborhood? Check Anniston, AL. That‚Äôs a fun one. Because thats the kind of shit that trump wants to bring back. The deregulation of industrial pollutions, pretending to ‚Äúsave jobs‚Äù while killing Americans and putting money...
And White people came in and burned it down. Some even dropped bombs from private planes. This is where trump chose to hold his rally.
Can you tell me why he was banned, please? And also, you know that trump had his own jets and helicopters? Just a thought.

It‚Äôs not heartbreaking, what‚Äôs really heartbreaking is that you stand by white conservatives who honestly don‚Äôt give a damn about you other than your support for Trump, that‚Äôs just about it, if you weren‚Äôt a Trump voter, they would insult and stereotype you just like they do me.

This is a war from the left! They are trying to defend the corruption at all cost because they fear law and order!!! Trump 2020!
And interviewing Trump is a whole different beast... do you stop him and press and issue or let him keep talking bc he often talks his way into bigger reveals!
Wow trump might as well resign after this one. You really got em man üòë
You'll love this article, it's full of Trump bashing and bashing of his supporters...and some inconvenient facts.
Claiming that he didn‚Äôt know the tweet where trump said stone had ‚Äúguts‚Äù because he doesn‚Äôt read tweets but that tweet was actually in the Mueller report. So he lied because he supposedly read the report. Unless he lied about that too.
Give to the Trump's campaign and you to can be somebody in a defunct administration.
And what exactly are the Democrats doing to make the world a better place if they defeat Trump? What comes next afterwards? What are they going to do to make our lives better?
For years people have been wondering what would happen if Trump simply ignored the Supreme Court's ruling(s). I guess we're about to find out.
I would think at least a few of those people would realize their vote helped push trump over the top.

Trump TrollsTrump is undermining U.S. economic and security interests but also destroying the security of the southern hemisphere on trade, human rights, and democracy. Trump has failed in every count
economic development, trade integration, and multilateral cooperation were crucial. Instead Trump disdainful and dismissive attitude is the reason why China is destroying the eco system of the Galapagos islands.  Trump brazen mismanagement is doing tremendous damage
The problem is Trump has neglected Latin America with malice and prejudice, ad hoc policy responses, and blatant disinterest. The short-term pressures without any hint of a broader, long-term strategy. It has shown hostility on immigration and little concern for the issues
Does despising Netanyahu equate to contempt for Jews and Israel?  The world despises Trump. They support Americans and America.   Thank goodness they see the difference.  Not defending Justice Dems. They‚Äôre a bunch of white privileged jerks.

normally EC truly problematic but in this case better to have 15 or 20 elections for Trump 2 try 2 undermine than one big election.    If he wins a dispute in say Ohio maybe it won‚Äôt matter. If it‚Äôs one big election he will taint the whole thing. Like compartments in a sub.

Trump is now losing his conservative base. this can't be good for trump, but it is good for America.
Trump wants a delay for the election in November because he is not comfortable with fraudulent postal votes. Presumably he needs more time to get the fraudulent postal votes organised.
Well, yeah. The only thing the right cared about under Obama was the deficit and our national debt. They magically stopped caring the moment they were elected, despite the fact Trump's made the problem worse in the trillions.
When will Rudy get it? Trump's body count up 1.
Maybe Judd Trump could do a better job?!
That‚Äôs okay.  Under my hypothesis then, states w dem governors hold a presidential election &amp; send electoral ballots which are then counted by the house.  Hopefully trump won‚Äôt send national guard from red states into blues states to prevent voting either on 11/3 or 12/14.

Are people so stupid?  Reason is very simple.  Some big guns Invested heavily in the company that make hydroxycloroquine. So they are going to rec omens the shit even if it kills a few bastards.  But Trump followers never see the con. They are that stupid

They have never said a word about every atrocity trump has committed, no need to start now.
No they won't.  This is not up to Billy Barr to decide if postponing the election should be postponed.  Trump would just prefer it's cancelled.  No need to vote.  Just leave trump in power.
VOTE THEM ALL OUT. Republicans need to look deep in their souls and decide if they feel they are being represented when the only thing they care about is preserving their own personal wealth.   No need to help America in this Trump induced Worst Pandemic EVER is their fault.
Trump couldn't handle being upstaged by the last best President in American history, so he figured he'd make his obese presence available to try to upstage Obama.  It failed miserably.  We don't care what he had to say.
Trump breaks America every day he remains in office.  Little by little he makes America worse.

Senate Republicans know that election day can't come fast enough. Every day that passes reduces their chances of holding on to a majority. A delayed election would doom them more than they are doomed now. How long before they break with Trump completely?
it's no coincidence that trump installed a totally trumpy big money donor to run the USPS, the 1st time in history a non-postal person was installed as postmaster general.  Why? one more piece of trumps way of rigging the election.
Trump does not want a voting #papertrail Based on some of the scary stories I‚Äôve heard about the ease with which his henchmen can hack into and change electronic votes...is this why?
Will the GOP, aka Trumplandia, say trump can't change election day?  Or will the nod and say it's ok.  This can not happen.  Speak up america. Now.  Trump wants to put off the election like the Kentucky Derby?  This isn't going to happen.  Trump is not a dictator yet.
Putin backing Trump backing Brexit.
Trump will do anything to remain in power.  Even trying to end the election.  Not delay, end.  This is all insane nonsense and if the GOP is ok with this, they all must go.
Yes. Trump also intentionally created the ‚Äòchaos‚Äô by dumping uninvited, unaccountable, incompetent paramilitary forces into US cities.  I
Trump deemed it so.
Now he's openly discussing interfering in the election. I know some of you are burned out on politics - I get that - but this is extremely dangerous. He's called coronavirus a hoax, shrugged it off... and NOW he wants to use it to delay the election?
See the tolerant, loving, peaceful, fully inclusive left are out in force. Really sad news &amp; yet they take every opportunity to blame Trump.  Wonder if anyone prescribed him #Hydroxychloroquine  #Zinc
That's because you're delusional. Like it or not the Tory's won an 80 seat majority, labour were demolished. Describing a democratically elected government a "cabal" is exactly what Trump would do.
Trump wasn't invited.  Who'd want to hear him talk about John Lewis knowing every word would be a lie and after 30 seconds he would talk about how great trump himself really is.  No one wanted him there.  McCain didn't want him there.  No one wants him there.  Trump is a disease.
Obama is going to start speaking and Trump has to divert attention from that.
Herman proved how right he was.  Congrats to Herman for being a trump victim.
Guess you forgot that trump fired LTC Vindman (and his completely innocent twin brother) for standing up in Congress and telling the truth.  How the GOP wanted to unmask a 'whistleblower' and wanted him arrested.  Chucky, you're on the wrong side of history on this.  Go home.
Go tell Trump he killed Herman Cain.  "Stupid is as stupid does" is never more true at this moment, Herman died because of stupid.    Listening to donald trump can literally get you dead.

BBC News - Donald Trump suggests delay to 2020 US presidential election
You do realise that Congress decides when the election is held, and they are democratically elected politicians. Trump has no power to do this, but of course you know that but decided to be a keyboard hero.
If you voted for Donald Trump then the cap fits, wear it with a sense of shame.
The GOP hates decency.  They collectively embrace hate and vile speak.  They denounce decency and claim that white people are somehow better than others.  Their party revels in hate and racism.  Today, trump sits and stews in his own hate while America says goodbye to a patriot.
What is McConnell willing to do if Trump pushes his election delay forward?  What will McConnell do if Trump loses the election, but refuses to leave office on January 21, 2021?  Deeds, not words.
Trump watching George and Bill and Barack giving speeches for John Lewis and angry he wasn't invited.  Just like he wasn't invited to John McCains funeral.  He knows deep down people hate him and as much as he craves love he is totally and pathologically incapable of giving it.
He attended the Tulsa Trump Rally without a mask. He became ill and tested positive shortly after. Democrats wear masks because we don't view COVID-19 as a political yawning point. He exposed himself to a bunch of other non mask wearing idiots. You're running for public office?
This as the Chair of Black Voters for Trump dies from the out of control virus he likely picked up at the Tulsa rally - the one world health experts begged you not to have.  Coincidence?
How I'm getting by with the current political state: voting against Trump and knowing that even if he is re-elected, he can't be president ever again.
Putin will have no use for trump when he leave office.  you can bet putin will demand payment in full on all the loans and since putin is 100x worse than trump, he and his family better damn well pay them off or who knows what'll happen to them.  well, yes we do.
Trump would put us all in the wood chipper if he got a million dollars a head...
Assuming Joe Biden wins and is inaugurated as President, and immediately orders a nationwide mask wearing mandate, will trumpkins and the great right stupid protest in the street for their 'freedom of no mask wearing'?  I suspect they will, trump will keep spewing and covid grows
Look at this as a dangerous balloon being floated, yes. Look closely at the 2nd quarter GDP drop--32.9%--Trump is trying his best to draw attention away from that number.
The states control the elections.  I work them here in Virginia.  The counties and independent cities pay you, not the federal government.  Trump is in over his head here.
Same age as Trump.  Playing with fire...
100s of psychiatrists have said he is.  Mary Trump, who's a PH.d psychologist thinks he is. Many mental health professionals think he is. I think he is. The claim you can't make these assertions without an in-person diagnosis doesn't fit someone like trump because he's so public
The saddest thing (aside from the loss of a life) is that nothing will change for Trump, the GOP or his insane followers.....
Saying there's more context than him posting the doctor, hate it or not people associate supporting Trump with being racist cuz why else would you follow a racist unless you are one
I haven't said anything about either one but I also haven't seen any fans praising Chase for posting it, it's pretty obvious ur probably a Trump supporter too and we're mad when people talked bad about JDR for being one
Against any rational candidate Biden would lose. But Americans who are not totally tribal, like my wife, will vote for him to end the Trump madness.  We just pray he doesn't start another war, which ironically he is more likely to do than Trump.
Trump doesn't deserve to breathe the air we breathe
It‚Äôs time to remember Trump is not in charge of the federal gov. He‚Äôs in charge of one (1) co-equal branch. He has no authority over the elections. We must not give it to him.

This message shows the world Trump has no brains. No understanding of what the country is all about. What Americans need and want. 50% of American make less than $50,000 and can't afford houses more than $238,000
You should research properly you are basically creating more discrimination. More division. More inequality. The Trump policies are riddle with ignorance, idiocy and stupidity
Except Trump barely even tried to do anything except rage tweet. That guy is trying to do too much at a time. When did Trump have too many balls in the air?
my #goodnews is that I discovered some ancestors called Trump going back a couple of hundred years, and they aren‚Äôt related to him! At first I felt sick but the I realised those Trumps came from Germany and its his mother‚Äôs side which was British. Phew!
A blind man can see Trump is violating the constitution. A deaf man could hear the cries of 153,000 deaths. A mute man wants to decry the stupidity of Trump's goverment. Even a paraplegic man would want to run away from what is happening to America. Tragic u can't get it.
That is exactly the point elaborated so nicely by this piece. Trump does bizarre or offensive act - not news, whereas by contrast, Trump makes reasonable statement or action - news.
It shouldn't surprise me but it did, Trump is utterly unable to evaluate the validity of information.

All these wack jobs providing Trump with legal advice.  She makes Rudy look reasonable and intelligent.  SAD.
I feel this is a feature, rather than a big. At least in the eyes of the Trump admin.  Encourage far-right thugs to cosplay law enforcement, wait for the inevitable response in self defence to escalate the violence, proving a pretext to further martial law.
I'm all in with Yang, he'll be great for the US, but he is not on the ballot. The logic is go with the next best option at this point and that is Biden obviously.  Please explain the logic of 4 more years of Trump. #yang2024
I don't know what to say outside of Trump's people simply don't communicate well at all.  Not at all.

How awful! Imagine if Trump went around saying you were his favourite author. You'd have to publicly disavow his endorsement, like when Johnny Marr said David Cameron wasn't allowed to like The Smiths.
Personally, I agree with Trump's move to withdraw troops from Germany, but I'd make it permanent. Russia's GDP is less than $2 trillion, and Germany's alone is nearly $4 trillion. The EU's GDP is about $16 trillion. Why does Europe need us to defend it against Russia?
Unbelievable that McCaskill was a former Senator as being a moron. HCQ is a cheap drug only costing pennies per pill. Suggesting that Trump promotes it for Putin to make money is beyond laughable. Democrats must be a party of morons.
OMG, is anyone even marginally surprised?  Of course not. Ex-CIA director Brennan writes in upcoming memoir that Trump blocked access to records and notes
Democrats do want to debate issues. They use every opportunity to repeat their narratives like systemic racism, black lives matter, peaceful protests, pandemic, mail-voting and on and on. They do care whether they are just lying or misleading. All they want is Trump to look bad.
Imagine getting your book endorsed by Donald Trump. "Good book! The BEST! And the author is a very close friend of mine. Covfefe"

Absolutely spot on.  "Widespread misinformation is an enemy to freedom"  Which is why someone should take Twitter away from Trump, &amp; vet his speeches.  And why the UK should join the fight against Russian interference.
Once Trump has gone who will give us the insanity headlines?
once again it needs to be pointed out that Pres Trump didn‚Äôt crest this virus, so to blame him for 145k deaths is not correct, this virus started in Wuhan China, they lied about it, the govt as a whole screwed up with trump at the helm, place blame correctly

Dear Lincoln Project:  Take this ad, add in trump2016 when he said (a lot) "Vote for me, what have you got to lose" and this fits perfectly.  What have we got to lose?  Our life, our moms, dads, brothers, sisters, spouses, friends, lovers, we can't replace them. Trump killed us.
If you think Trump gives a shit you are mistaken. Trump did not care if he operated a University without a license and defrauded thousands of people.  Trump did not care how much taxes he cheated on  TRUMP NEVER cares how many die from Covid.
Trump has lied from day one.  It didn't have to be this way.
America has lost so much.  And while trump isn't 'responsible' for it coming here, he is 100% responsible for what it's done to us.  His failure to act has cost countless lives and the deaths continue as he goes to play golf every weekend.  The worst president in history?  YES.

Surviving Autocracy by Masha Gessen review ‚Äì with Trump, there is no shared reality
Don‚Äôt understand this. The 20th Amendment is crystal clear. Trump‚Äôs term of office ends in Jan 21, no ifs no buts. If there‚Äôs no election it‚Äôs up to the House, unless there‚Äôs no House election in which case rule of law has ended.
No, we just recognize that GW was a much better president and definitely a better person than Trump will ever be
One way or another, Donald Trump will leave DC in Jan. It‚Äôs up to him and his stooges if he‚Äôs upright when he does it. He has frayed the nerves of Americans to the point that we WILL remove him one way or another
Well Trump stands to be arrested after Jan 2021 and Pence‚Äôs career is over. A LOT of Congressional members are also toast in Nov. They will blame Trump but they drank the KoolAid
Herman Cain walked into that rally of his own accord knowing damned good and well it was dangerous. Trump‚Äôs stupid but Cain was stupid AND unlucky
Yes, states run all elections, including for federal office, though they must follow some federally set guidelines (where I think this talk is at least a little scary; exec branch has never unilaterally added/changed election guidelines and we don't know what/how Trump will try).
Wonder if Trump will attend any servicesü§î
But no state officials are in the presidential line of succession. If you're saying some states could still hold elections for federal office and Trump would have no non-violent way to stop them, I agree with that.
Trump: "Delay the election?" McConnell: ... Staffer: "Senator, if there is no election before January 3, Governor Beshear can just appoint Amy McGrath." McConnell: "F*ck that sh!t"
Constitution does not specify the date of any election, only the length of terms. Trump's term expires on January 20, 2021 at noon if there is no election, same for VP. All U.S. House terms expire on January 3, 2021 if there is no election, so the Speaker is out too in that case.
That‚Äôs why they resent TRUMP,BORIS ,AND BREXIT  and never have a good word to say about all three!!!!!
This is complete BS. They don't "have to run away from reporters." They can grow a spine and say Trump is wrong, full stop...and people like  (whom I used to respect), can step up and tell them to do just that. Instead, we get nonsense like this. Sickening. #WeWillVote
Now what do you think would happen if we the Republicans/conservatives went after everyone that support Obama and the Clinton‚Äôs. They would have it all over the news or what if we attacked Obama or Clinton‚Äôs the same way they do Trump we would be in jail.
Disagree. Donald Trump is the natural result of the Republican Party's last 60 years.
Imagine if Venezuela talked about suspending elections. The USA would organise a coup or invade them. #Trump

The most dangerous is what ive heard. Some of his staffers write letters to the UN AND HAGUE on the cases AGAINST TRUMP because Gohmert is named

New York Times dishonors the death of a man to take a petty dig at Trump.  Could you imagine if a Republican did this?  They'd pretend-rage about it for WEEKS.  They'd probably allude to white supremacy over it, too.
No one is happy he got sick and passed. We are sad that he bought into Trump‚Äôs bullshit lies, went to his super spreader rally and got sick.
I want you to imagine a world where you wake up on November 4th and you‚Äôre not worrying about Trump and Biden because you‚Äôre too busy celebrating the wins of Blair Walsingham, David Kim, Donna Imam, Jen Perelman, and all of our #YangGang candidates. We can make it happen team.

Is that why Trump won't release his College Transcript? Because he's so smart he doesn't want to show how great his grades were? Is that why Trump wasn't on the Dean's list --because his grades were so good he didn't make it on the Dean's list?
Trump‚Äôs new favorite doctor was sued for malpractice after patient died: report

The world is so insane that a salacious story comes out about Alan Dershowitz (you know the guy who defended President Trump in an impeachment trial just a few months ago) and it‚Äôs like 3rd page news and off of most Americans radar.

Trump has no idea of religion. They recognized him as a village idiot they could ride into the WH. They praise, compliment him, pray over him,hands touching him. These evangelicals conned the con. He thinks they love him. They are using him and look what they  built in the adm.
The election date is set in the  constitution and Trump has no control over it. It‚Äôs not useful to allow Trump to set the terms of imaginary debates.

Define Communist and explain why Bernie is one. At least they weren't so sad that they needed a dictator to win. Especially since Trump lost the popular by millions.
Remember in 2016 Trump asking black folks, "What have you got to lose?"
Fair question, but let's be clear...much of the Wehrmacht in WWII was conscripts. They weren't Nazi party members or in SS. As much as I despise Nazis, hate that Ambassador, &amp; the fascist Trump administration, it may actually be okay to cite these dead as example of war costs.
It's actually America vs. Putinism. A Trump win means our servicemen and women, our democracy, our countrymen and women are not safe.

There WAS inward migration to states like Texas and Arizona from California before Trump because of young people searching for cheap housing. They would have changed the political makeup but not sure it would be AS severe. It remains to be seen if Dems own suburbs or loaning them
It‚Äôs sad for America that these idiots are so #AntiTrump that are willing to ignore the FACT there was wide spread vote harvesting in 2018 and the ‚Å¶ will use mail in ballots to steal to steal 2020 election ü§®
Exactly, this is only because Trump is a losing horse. These people obviously don't care
workaround, where if Trump does something to try to stop elections, they hold a vote for Speaker that lasts past January 20th. I don't know how that would hold up, but, it seems far-fetched that this would be decided by court cases anyway.
It's not. But I have seen it used as an excuse as to why we still have an issue with racism and I fear that once Trump is gone some will claim a moral victory and ignore the issue. Progress has been made, but we still have a ways to go.
Trump has no clue how to do anything. He‚Äôs running scared and it‚Äôs adorable to see his silly zealots freaking out

No, Trump does not have a Christian bone in his body. He is the village idiot they found.All evangelicals had to do was praise&amp;compliment him&amp; tell him he was the chosen one,to ride him into the WH,These people conned the con,they control him &amp; the Presidency.
‚ÄúMueller's prosecutors thought Trump's financial records and tax returns went to possible motive, not intent, so they thought they didn't need the evidence.‚Äù   Oh.
Mary Trump. Does that count?
If everyone can enter ports of entry, which most do, why do we need a stupid wall at all? Aside from being a monument to Trump's massive ego and tiny "hands".
Quite a read from
Trump‚Äôs Law - everything will happen at the same time to make it seem that much more awful.   Sorry Murphy, it‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs law now. You understand.
‚Äúafter assembling the team that came up with..national testing plan, Kushner then appears to have decided...to scrap its proposal...Worried about the stock market&amp;his reelection prospects, Trump also feared that more testing would only lead to higher case counts &amp;..bad publicity‚Äù
When the Fed. stops propping markets up, when or before trump gets voted out, it should succumb to the force of gravity and plummet. It will probably be a long hard slog getting the economy back with obstruction by any remaining GOP miscreants. Economy may be fine, not s. market.
Thank trump
It is this simple - Trump doesn't really like elections &amp; he certainly doesn't like letting everyone vote. Democracy doesn't really work for the Republicans. With Putin as a mentor it's no wonder he would like to remain in office indefinitely

I don't think that particular reference is to Trump. His hotel chain isn't that large, and I don't think he has one in France.
With all going on in the US...   3mos out from the election, Trump makes clear his entire job is getting re-elected.   Nothing else is being allowed on his desk, by his order.  All strategists are at work, not attend to crises, but to find ways to convince voters to back him.
Trump hats are? Totally agree
I'd hate to do something that Trump thinks is "ridiculous and possibly illegal"! #TrumpHatesScience
As a candidate, Trump had me catfished, blacklisted, and my email hacked.  His people were then trafficking in my personal information.   This is who he is.  This is what he does.

If a gov postpones the vote, how would that impact that state's electoral votes?  If no vote, no slate of electors chosen, its votes aren't sent to Congress, and not considered in Electoral College?  Seems Trump-friendly govs would increase value of blue states electoral votes.
I do believe they blame Trump for everything. No, seriously.
Exactly. Gov. Cuomo never should have listened when Trump was downplaying #COVID19!
tuck &amp; trump both say terrible, vicious comments about Obama, Biden &amp; literally can not say ANYTHING criticizing putin - now why would that be?

My mail came at nearly 10pm last night. I felt so bad. Trump and his lap dogs are ruing what was an effective and efficient system.  They needed  funds. Instead of funsing them,he is doing is doing what he knows to do destroy them.That man deserves misery.
Slowly and surely as the tide rising conservatives pull away from the flaming wreckage of the Trump presidency.

The draft Democratic Party platform condemns the Trump administration's policy towards Venezuela and disavows "regime change" as U.S. policy, in a victory for the party's progressive wing.
Worth recalling: In 2015 Scarborough asked Trump why he admired Putin, a leader who ‚Äúkills journalists, political opponents, and invades countries.‚Äù Trump responses that the US was in no position to criticize Putin‚Äôs behavior bwcause ‚Äúour country does plenty of killing also.‚Äù
I‚Äôll never forget interviewing Herman Cain in Nevada in 2015 with  He was very excited about how the primary was going; especially excited about Trump. Never would have imagined this is how things would have gone.
Not many countries will allow you do to what Trump does as well. China also was not build on the same principal and how it was found was not the same revolution in the US. China went from a democracy to communist/dictatorship to capitalistic communism.
The Federalist Society is dyed-in-the-wool conservative: ‚ÄúThis latest tweet is fascistic and is itself grounds for the president‚Äôs immediate impeachment again by the House of Representatives and his removal from office by the Senate.‚Äù
Trump was recorded talking to Sen. James Inhofe about keeping Lee's name at military sites, and The New York Times got the tape.We see this incident very differently. I firmly believe that conservatives would LOSE THEIR MINDS if Hilary Clinton had been president and then mentioned delaying the upcoming election. We would call her a tyrant, but Trump? He‚Äôs just concerned for the process. I disagree.
Because he isn't Trump, he isn't insane, and he stands a better chance of winning than Howie Hawkins.  If you really want change, you win power by voting Dem. Voting green means you're in it for stubborn pride.

Get Ready for Trump's Second Term
The pandemic, which is not Trump's fault because he didn't create the virus. But he is certainly responsible for how America looks right now. Trump has done nothing to help mitigate the spread. Trump doesn't want a shut down economy because of the aforementioned market stuff.
Trump didn't just walk in and make the market better, overnight. But they think so. Which is not how it works. But they think it, so it's obviously true.   But what they don't see, what they fail to even remotely acknowledge, is the pitfalls of the market during the pandemic.
But the Trump people give ALL the credit to Trump. He is their Presidential God. When they say "the stock market is the best it's ever been" it's only the best because that's the one thing they can claim with Trump, which again, is a basic achievement.
Guess what, people made money with Obama too. Is that weird?   The people I know, friends and family, with a lot of money didn't just make money the last 4 years with Trump. They cashed in on Obama post-recession. Made money during Clinton and held together for most of Bush.
This is what Trump has done to his base; he's gaslighted and brainwashed millions with divisive rhetoric, empty content and at best, false pride for basic achievement. To them, Trump is the financial superhero because their bank accounts and portfolios have increased.
I asked a question about how Trump has handled the pandemic. His response wasn't based in facts; he immediately went to the stock market and said "America is respected again." I called him out on some of the inconsistencies with his answers and he stormed off in a fit of rage.
Last night at a bar (outside bar) a man, almost twice my age, and I got into a discussion about BLM, sports and ultimately Trump and politics. It must be stated that this man is a cheerleading pom pom waving MAGA to death Trump guy and I am not.

Trump is not a good business man. He‚Äôs a big business man. His empire, while impressive, was created from the exploitation of workers and smaller business he choked out to become so successful. For an economy to thrive, the middle class and poor need to be successful as well
you need to pass a bill to stop Trump from giving out any more pardons or executive orders. It‚Äôs time to shackle him!
Trump isn't the one talking crazy stuff like Biden that makes no sense.   Plus, should Trump win in 2020, he will be leaving in 2025. But if Biden wins, we'll have to put up with his mental illness for up to 8, and he will leave around 2029, or 2025 if we're lucky.
Add Bernell Trammell to that list.
Portland will be crying for him to federally fund what was once their city, and Trump will say "no."

That may depend on what the Biden campaign's internal polls look like. Is Trump's mishandling of the pandemic putting Biden far enough ahead that he it makes no difference to the downballot Dems which VP he picks?
Showing when Trump wasn't a jerk the media would acknowledge it...especially early on.  Had Trump not consistently picked fights with the media they may not have been as adversarial...BUT then that would not have suited Trump's purpose to demonize the press &amp; please the base.
Unless the GOP splinters in a Trump vacuum.
you don‚Äôt have ratings fool because you haven‚Äôt done anything but say open open open!  If you had said all weR masks in Jan? Then you‚Äôd get nice going Trump. No you put everyone down made huge blunders! Lined your pockets and lied!

She was amazing and called out the Trump  agenda for exactly what it is: racism!
they‚Äôve been doing this since Trump‚Äôs inauguration; have you been asleep or  have you been OK with it up to now? What changed; maybe you see that the greater law abiding public despises this and you‚Äôre afraid it‚Äôs going to hurt the left‚Äôs chances in November? Late.

President Trump shared multiple versions of the video with his 84 million Twitter followers Monday night.
hey bud you going to tell the truth that Outin is telling Trump how to become leader for life like he did? We all know what Trump is doing. Sadly Trump would be really hurt if he goes through with this!
Everyone should be worried. Polls show Trump losing. But he keeps raising the stakes. Barr is not afraid of being punished for abuse of power. Putin and Trump on the phone. Republicans shamelessly cut assistance to the people. They have a plan...God help us!
Make sure Barr takes the oath! If he doesn‚Äôt we don‚Äôt trust him to tell the truth! Ask him about ‚Äúwho knelt on Epstein‚Äôs neck‚Äù! We know he is a political hack for Trump. Have Sargent of arms shackle him if he doesn‚Äôt tell the truth!

The Trump admin built the greatest economy in this nation‚Äôs history. He will do it again.
Yep, once again blame Donald Trump for YOUR instigation's. When your Party presents a Bill which is negotiable, &amp; doesn't give away the farm, we, The American People, might just see something positive. All you've done so far is obstruct The President because YOU LOST THE ELECTION
He stabbed a black Trump supporter.  Thought black lives mattered?
It‚Äôs too late Trump destroyed evangelicals... he proved their hypocrisy REPEATEDLY.  They have ZERO CREDIBILITY
What‚Äôs funny is Trump was the first person to take action by closing our borders to China. He was then called a racist for doing so by the democrats. They were just as clueless as he was.
President Donald Trump in recent days suddenly acknowledged the gravity of the coronavirus pandemic. Here's a review of some of his statements on that and more from the past week.
I have many libertarian values, but I‚Äôm voting for Trump because I‚Äôm vehemently opposed to the recent rulings of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and am essentially voting for RBG‚Äôs replacement so Roberts is no longer the deciding vote.
I typed fast, lots of mistakes, damn spell check changes things. But I do believe you get my drift. Trump had buildings built and didn‚Äôt pay his workers. That‚Äôs not class, that shows you people are pure trash! Slave labor!
athletes kneel for God not you, you racist phough! Does it hurt your poor Trump love? You got filthy ruch off of athletes. You should be ashamed that athletes don‚Äôt want to be used by you white trash anymore! I kneel every time I go to church or a fellow soldier dies!
Never not voted.   You are foolish to believe Biden is any less cogent than Trump is. I realize that Trumpster's are parroting that line.  At their age, both have lost some of their edge.  Biden has always been a gaffe machine at any age but is more capable than Trump.
Nothing wrong with being anti-Trump when he's wrong...as is most often.  üôÇüôÇüôÇ
I didn't ascribe racism to any color.   I've never voted for a Dem in 40 years. I did not vote for Trump or HRC. I'm undecided about 2020 but it won't be Trump. GOP is no longer the party of Reagan. They have enabled Trump's imperialism and autocracy. Sad.
Comprehension is a prob for you. How many millions of people in this country are supporting Antifa???  Rassmussen reports most Americans consider it a "terrorist" org. Trump beats it like a dog to scare people. And your dumb if you believe every athlete supports them.   1/
I hate this stupid direct mail BS..."my TOP SUPPORTERS ONLY".  And it's not just Trump. All campaigns do it. I can't believe people fall for it.
Its just one of many false promises Trump made to america. Plus because hes using his own courses the money spent isnt even going to the economy
Funny video. I'm a conservative Evangelical (who is very anti-Trump). Many don't really grasp the vast differences of a very large tent but we have these in the tent for sure. As I defend liberals to them as "not hating the country". I defend them the same.  Misguided IMO though.
Police were ordered to stand down by their bitch boy Democrat mayor, Ted Wheeler.  But by all means, keep attacking Trump, and keep simping for do-naught Democrats.  Who am I to judge?
Do you really think Trump wants to sit down with Jake Tapper..i wouldn't even advise that
Oh you finally found science you like...of course it would be Trump inspired Science! Remember it was  who said it would ‚Äúmagically disappear‚Äù when the weather got warm. I know you are hunkered down in your basement bunker but its pretty warm in Florida &amp; Texas!

You don‚Äôt know Biden, Biden was not President you idiot! Trump is a President and he follows Putin‚Äôs lead. TRYMP lives the Saudis the ones that did 9/11. The Saudi‚Äôs planned and executed 9/11!!!!

I wonder if the  and Trump hating  "journalist"  put this up? He lives in Belfast after all
Trump is definitely going to win.  People need to take action in their own lives and become kart of the solution for themslves, their family and community.  Biden would be a disaster!  Definitely praying trump wins again, and he will by a landslide
When you're so woke, you stab a black Trump supporter, in the name of "anti-facism."  Idiot was previously arrested for CP, too.  Enough is enough. We need more feds in cities like Portland, where Wheeler enables these psychos.
A Black Trump supporter was just stabbed by an Antifa flunkie... and a convicted sex offender.
You're kidding right? That REALLY be fake news. Trump is killing us off by doing nothing about this pandemic &amp; won't protect the troops from Putin. Wonder how his convo with Putin went the other day? He doesn't talk to our allies as much as he talks to Putin.
I have a Donald Trump joke, but it‚Äôs written in word salad.
I‚Äôm saddened because he believed in everything Trump did. I told him Trump was a joke!
We need to impeach this liar! If he lies in his congressional hearing we need him to go straight to prison. No pardon, if Trump pardens him, keep him in jail!
The fact he's more focused on taking votes away from Biden lets you know he's working for Trump
. Can you address the idea of an undercount for Trump in the polls that are being released? Are they showing any indications that voters are just not stating their support for Trump? How is this something that can be determined?

There‚Äôs no way you went Democrat to Republican because of Trump.... that‚Äôs just bullshit
The more they attack Q, the more I think Q struck a nerve.  Why can't they attack Antifa? They're getting prepared for a "day of retribution" today. I had to notify Trump to send more federal troops.
144K is the current number of Covid deaths according to the CDC. And no one in charge seems to care.   But let's be honest, no one cared about the post 9/11 soldier deaths either.   Political agenda always wins.   Americans are pawns.   Wear a fucking mask and vote out Trump.
Not saying he‚Äôs racist but take this Pandemic  issue like it‚Äôs been a shit show he‚Äôs reactive not proactive and he‚Äôs in Trump back pocket
Lol yes go flames um I agree I think he‚Äôs like Trump he‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt care about much other then money
#8minutes someone dies of the Trump Virus!
Instead of seeing Trump's tax returns (AGAIN), I think we need to see Biden's senate records. IIRC, he had them sealed, to cover his ass from Tara's allegations.
He spent 4 months in a damned basement. Trump spent like 45 minutes in a bunker, yet HE'S the one called "Bunker Boy/Biatch."
This was what happened with the last president. Get people so dependent on welfare, that they lose all incentive to work. As a result, 94 million + were unemployed.  This was the "wonderful economy" they claimed Obama left Trump.  #ClowardPivenStrategy

Point me to where Biden people are seriously suggesting wooing MAGAts.  Do they mean Obama-Trump voters, or actual Trump cultists?
Like I said, the statement was poorly-worded.  Plus, I'm not the one turning this into an issue when a bunch of Twitter people (including you) have decided to spend an evening being outraged by this right after Trump sent stormtroopers to invade several cities.
Swing voters. (Duh.)  Everybody knows Trump voters are a lost cause. If you are seriously suggesting Biden is fishing for Trump voters, congratulations, you have lost the plot.
...Which doesn't change my point -- Biden isn't going to call Bush a racist if he wants to get the biggest number of voters to repudiate Trump as possible, no matter what Politics Twitter says.
Also -- even if Bush was a racist on par with Trump, which I personally doubt, as bad as Bush was -- if Biden wants to win the trust of white suburban voters, he is never going to call Bush a racist. That's just cold hard facts.
I think it's pretty obvious that was Biden meant was that Trump is the first racist president in *modern* history (the same way we credit Margaret Thatcher with being the longest-serving PM in *modern* history) and certain Twitter randos are complaining about it for... reasons.
You know he clearly meant the first racist president in *modern* history, right?  The same way people say Thatcher was the long-serving prime minister in *modern* history.  Are you really wasting your time on this while Trump and Barr are literally sending in stormtroopers?
So you really planning to spend the whole evening  criticizing Biden for not listing all the racist presidents we had before Trump, while Trump is literally sending stormtroopers into multiple cities?  This looks like time well spent.

Herman Cain had a choice. He chose to push Trump's "hoax" allegation. This isn't all on Trump. It's on his enablers too, like Herman Cain.
TeleTracking, which disruptively took over COVID hospital data reporting from CDC, has financial ties to NY real estate world &amp; the Trump org.
Trump is not a graceful loser. He looks for exits where he thinks he can save face. These are the two paths out that don‚Äôt involve becoming a ‚Äúloser,‚Äù to use his favorite insult.

President Trump suggested delaying the Nov. 3 presidential election as he pushed unsubstantiated allegations that increased mail-in voting due to the coronavirus pandemic will result in fraud.
U.S. Warns Russia on Bounties While Trump Cries ‚ÄòFake News‚Äô  #russianbounty
We're talking about delaying the election, not about right-wing talking points pretending there's a difference between absentee voting and mail-in ballots. You'd said that Trump would never try to delay the election. Now that Trump has tweeted just that, you're justifying it.
Hah! You've gone straight from Trump would never delay the election to it only makes sense to delay the election. Amazing!
‚ÄúThis reveals Trump‚Äôs totalitarian impulse. Never, ever in the history of the country has a President of the United States of America suggested that we delay an election.‚Äù - Steve Schmidt of
Tom Steyer and Michael Bloomberg could single handedly pay off all the court debt of Floridians whose voting rights are on the cusp of restoration and thus greatly increase the chances of a Biden Presidency, right? I mean, if they're all-in on defeating Trump...
He spent the morning tweeting like an eleven year old who just got phone privileges back. It's not like his schedule is full.   Maybe Trump doesn't want to talk about the WORST ECONOMIC DROP IN HISTORY.
He left out a word. Trump MEANT to say: ‚ÄúDelay the election until people CAN‚ÄôT properly, securely, and safely vote.‚Äù But, this isn‚Äôt Russian yet, Donald. #WeWillVote #YesTheyreRealFascists
When the going gets tough, Trump quits. He always has. I have a hard time believe he goes down fighting.  Plus, if he quits, he can have Pence pardon him.
trump has one tone. crazy. these journalists are clueless.
I think it‚Äôs time we can searate Republicans and Trump supporters into different categories
Then he'd have to admit he's been 100% wrong about COVID from the beginning. Trump only makes mistakes, he doesn't own them.
I am not sure what more it will take for those who doubt this, there is something seriously wrong psychologically with Donald Trump; if what Mary Trump recounted in her book "Too Much and Never Enough" has not made it sufficiently clear.
No. We still understand absentee voting is secure and safer for at wish voters. Trump is a fear monger trying to scare his moronic followers into a dictatorship.
Biden has some real guts; viewed one way, he's the first White Man to be POTUS after Obama. I count Trump as the last Neo Con. And NOW its time to account for decades of half-solutions : health/education, etc. Through the lens of social media!! 'OK guys, I know its been bad....'
An analogy is an invitation to think.  No analogy is perfect. We have to try to see what analogies are getting at and do our best to go there.  Sure there are problems with tests and standards. But there are problems with lack of standards and lack of tests.  Behold Trump.
Starting to think that if Trump had taken Covid seriously in February, maybe he wouldn't have so many threats, complaints, and constitutional issues today?

Trump has to be crapping a brick because Obama is getting more attention than he'll ever have.

Rutgers Expert Available to Discuss Trump‚Äôs Comments on Delayed Election
IU experts available to comment on President Trump's suggestion to delay 2020 election
Obama has something Trump will never have, character.
They haven't fully recovered from the last hurricane thanks to the ineptitude of Trump merely throwing paper towels and not providing financial assistance. All because Trump is  a racist.
Oh, Petal, you couldn't even find the table for over 2 months   You identify yourself as the Grim Reaper  You have no interest in American workers, you're there for the extra Pentagon funds and to protect Trump's hotel  We see you
Cue the stupid tweets from Trump while a respected president speaks.
This is insane. Is this another case of, 'I have no reason not to believe Putin?' Of course no words from Trump regarding this. He's saving all his words for supporters like Stone, Barr, and Manafort.
I see trump wants to delay the November election.   I have a counter offer.  How about we have it tomorrow.
Trump plans to address United Nations General Assembly in person
oh my god. trump, this is on you. your stupid tulsa rally.
At least then we will have justification, Trump will be president so not election interference, open season on rioters.
All Trump‚Äôs doing now is trying to distract from Obama‚Äôs eulogy for John Lewis
I've been Woke even BEFORE he Ran for Prez To Me Trump ain't Sh-t He'll NEVER Be Sh-t &amp; When he loses I Hope someone Gives him a Full Nut Crush w/ a Steel Toed Boot &amp; a Steel Baseball Bat to The Face  I don't Classify him as MY Leader I Classify him as DEAD Meat
Seems like Trump really doesn't want to talk about the WORST ECONOMIC DROP IN HISTORY.
Doesn't have to be. Trump doesn't want to talk about the WORST ECONOMIC DROP IN HISTORY.
On the other hand, we're all talking about this instead of the WORST ECONOMIC DROP IN HISTORY.   Why do we keep letting Trump control the narrative?
Ignore Trump's shiny distraction from the WORST ECONOMIC DROP IN HISTORY.
When is Obama giving a eulogy for John Lewis? I'm guessing that's when Trump will start...
Targeting unemployment to make sure there's enough grift to keep a hotel from competing with Trump's and to add to the bloated Pentagon budget.   Welfare for the rich. Bootstraps for the poor.   This is what Senate Republicons took 2 months to come up with? Criminal.
Some erosion among seniors for Trump. But yes, in the end, Trump is likely to carry them, sans Biden landslide.
I wonder what it‚Äôs like to vote for a president that you‚Äôre truly excited about and believe in. As someone who couldn‚Äôt vote until 2014, the only major candidates I‚Äôve ever been able to choose from are Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump and Joe Biden. I feel cheated.
Trump posed a question, hence the "???"  It was not a declarative statement.
I've received some questions about this today, but  new article does a great job of outlining why Trump can't delay the election. His term expires Jan 20th regardless, and after that the line of succession kicks in.
Amazing how much people are talking about the election date instead of the single largest quarter drop of GDP in US history. It‚Äôs almost as if Trump baited everyone to ignore what is really happening.
I predict the day after Biden is sworn in.....Indictments against Trump will be unsealed in the SDNY.
The Constitution means nothing to Trump  Source: the last four years
Over/under on how long before Trump signs an EO adding Herman Cain to the National Statue Garden of Great American Heroes?
Seems like Trump has successfully stopped us from discussing the abysmal numbers.  GDP drops 32.9% and we're freaking out about a thing Trump can't do.
I would challenge anyone to be able to say those three things non-ironically about Donald Trump at his funeral with a straight face.
Read the actual accounts of these detainments. People taken to the courthouse,   released because they didn't know why they were detained by Trump's Cosplay Mercenaries and there was no paperwork from the "authorities" who "detained" them.   Proactive arrests- still not a thing.
A Closer Look at Melania Trump‚Äôs Latest Cause: A Makeover of the White House Rose Garden
Being a Trump Apologist must be absolutely exhausting. Trump means what he says, speaks the truth. Until he doesn't. Or "didn't mean that" all the way to "didn't say that". üôÑ
Trump collapsed the economy and has allowed the death of 150,000 people and counting, and he‚Äôs running for reelection on a platform of ‚Äúmake American great again.‚Äù  I think we‚Äôre all too close to this to fully grasp the absurdity of it.
Our military leadership need to be prepared to physically remove Trump from power! ü§¨
There it is! Trump already has blackwater mercenaries doing his bidding, and a gutless GOP, so don‚Äôt assume he doesn‚Äôt have the authority! We will have to physically remove Trump!!!

Fuck trump
Best way to give the finger to Putin is to vote out loser Trump. #WeWillVote
New COVID hot spot. How many of those people will be dead in a month? Morons. And I'm not even considering their support for the trump-pence clowns.
Whoever's fit to do so could literally right a book with bullet points outlining the atrocities Trump committed over just the past year. Never mind the past 4. Never mind his entire life.
Given that Trump's only hope for winning in November is fraud (and since he believes mail-in voting is so fraudulent), you'd think he'd be all for the prospect and trying to figure out how he can rig it.
Yes the election delay tweet is dumb. No, I won‚Äôt be bothering to get worked up about it until more concrete and active steps are taken. Trump tweets dumb things all the time.
You excoriated Biden for suggesting that Trump would do this. Maybe you should apologize?
So much for attending a Trump rally!!!
Trump talking about the election isn‚Äôt the biggest news of the day. We are approaching an economic depression.
There is a non-zero chance this could happen. Or, more likely, that those prone to conspiracy theories will "patrol" polling places with guns to protect against the "fraud" Trump says is being perpetrated. Which in turn creates voter suppression.
Armed federal agents have kidnapped people off the streets without probable cause. So DHS has demonstrated they will follow orders without regard to constitutionality. Who is to say Trump won't declare an extralegal postponement and these agents won't interfere?
Are you kidding?  ?  You are seriously playing the "no one knows the facts" card here? What did Trump offer you in exchange for this nonsense?  When you act in support of someone with no credibility, Mike, you deplete your own credibility! Don't do this.
üò≥ He is dead becuse Trump needed a rally.
Note: this was in April.
We'd be better off without trump supporters.
Adjusted we‚Äôre about 10th worst in the entire world, we should be last place. We‚Äôre only beat mostly by places like Iraq, Iran, Kyrgyzstan, &amp; Guatemala. Completely embarrassing. Trump admin has failed. I definitely will be voting for Biden this year, not getting fooled again.
I feel like journalists/publications need to stop asking trump stuff like "will you accept the results of the election?" and writing clickbait headlines like "can trump actually delay the election?" he can't and entertaining it just gives it oxygen and legitimacy
i don't think we should discount trump, but if we're being as hard-nosed and serious as we present ourselves, we should ask questions like "what exactly are the legal and institutional pathways for this to happen" since those things matter.
Trump does know a lot about INACCURATE &amp; FRAUDULENT.
Very ironic post from a Trump supporter
Surely the answer is to make any election fair and accurate.   But why would you and Trump just give up when there's nearly 100 days to go. Why not put in place the systems necessary? After all this is the country that actually put a man on the moon. Over 50 years ago!
It could have been prevented in January and February but Republicans are still arguing about wearing a MF mask. Total leadership failure from the top. Now maybe people will understand why so many Trump businesses went bankrupt.
I agree with this. I like to think that Trump is performing a valuable service in making it all very visible now.  He runs the White House like a lemonade stand.
Is it too much to hope that even Trump fans won't support delaying an election?
For the love of God just kick Trump off Twitter already
"Democrats say that procedure requires Donald Trump to vacate the White House and relinquish his authority, because of laws. Republicans counter with 'nah.' Let's talk to some pundits from both sides."
Worst economic news in American history jsut reported. Trump: Look over there!
Segregated suburbs? Nope. Wealthy POC are tolerable, that makes him look inclusive. It‚Äôs poor people he can‚Äôt stand. If we must have the poor (after all, who would do our cleaning, yard work, etc?), let‚Äôs just warehouse them in ghettos where we don‚Äôt have to see them. Trump 101.
The dates of federal elections are enshrined in federal law and would require an act of Congress to change.
Not to mention in the middle of an ACTUAL CIVIL WAR. I loathe Trump‚Äôs opponents, but the dude has gotta go.
Psst...Trump can‚Äôt delay the election. He just doesn‚Äôt want you to think about how his failure to lead has crushed the economy.
Donald Trump, ‚Äúpresident‚Äù, isn‚Äôt doing his job. He must clear out. Arrest the Traitorous Republicans that are enabling him. If he can‚Äôt do it, the American people will in November. We will not rest until there is equal justice! Fixed it for you #Loser.
WTF Trump floats idea of delaying the November election, a power granted to Congress, as he ramps up attacks on voting by mail By John Wagner
21) Where the overwhelming Trump advantage we show may result from that alone, it may have another cause. It may demonstrate that Trump supporters are anxious to show up and sound off, due to passionate support, and Biden supporters may not feel so strongly or sound off so loud.
19) Second, our data suffers from an obvious selection bias. Now, obvious as this is, it may have a couple of different causes. One is boring, the other not quite so much so. Boring is just that our reach is far strong, right now, with Trump supporters than we Biden supporters.
16) Now let's look at the same timeframe for Trump.
My wife and I honeymooned in New Zealand - we traveled there the day Trump was inaugurated - I'd be lying if I said I haven't daydreamed that we never came back  January 20, 2021 can't come soon enough
. has rolled over for Trump‚Äôs assault on American values and irresponsible spending on nonsense like his ‚Äúwall.‚Äù Having betrayed everything he promised #VA05, now he pretends to believe in something?
bluechecks for the last six months: trumps gonna delay the election   us: are you fucking stupid he‚Äôs not allowed to do that  trump: floats the idea of delaying the election   bluechecks:
3) So, what exactly are you looking at? Having crunched up our numbers, we make a percentage based prediction. As of that day, the data we have, and the models we use to convert data into a prediction, we called 68% for Trump and 32% for Biden on our first day.
Trump is literally killing us.
Time out.  ‚Äòs voice is more relevant regarding removal of US Forces in Germany than Bolton, who had many opportunities to choose the wellbeing of America over the interests of a trump.
