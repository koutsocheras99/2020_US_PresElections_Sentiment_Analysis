At Lewis Funeral, Obama Calls Filibuster a ‘Jim Crow Relic’
You have echoed lies and defended demagoguery. It must sting to still be defending Trump.⁦ ⁦ signed 45236
🤣🤣🤣 Dude, don't be a Troll...get a life. TRUMP/PENCE 2020 🇺🇸✌
I feel bad for Cain. He ended up dying for Trump.
He was in remission in 2007, in complete remission for the requisite 5 years by 2012. He died, after a month of suffering, from COVID-19. You don’t have to look for comorbidity just because it makes Donald Trump look less tesponsible.
Trump defends doctor who claimed medicine is made from alien DNA and walks out of briefing mid question  Birds of a feather flock together, quack, quack, quack.
Vote that tired ass Trump out of office now!
Just, amazing!   Just because there are Trump flags and boat parades Pres. Trump is going to win by a landslide.   Trump is going to save us they tell me.  I would like to know what makes you so optimistic Trump wins BIG in November.   I am puzzled.
Doctor touted by Trump believes alien DNA is in medicine and demon dream sex is an actual problem
Imagine literally risking your life to go to a Trump rally and then actually dying because of it. I feel guilty and exposed by going to get my mail. #DyingForTrump
Deny...deny...deny all you want, but the man got Covid-19 at the trump rally! The timing adds up perfectly! 8 members of trump's staff tested positive. Cain refused to take precautions.
if pornhub said they would shut down their website if trump got re elected it would solve our issues
And vote Trump please  🇺🇸🇺🇸
Republicans became too power hungry and have screwed up their party. It will take a long time to rebuild after Trump is gone. No Tea Oarty &amp; no Trump party. What’s next for Republicans. Another $39 trillion in the hole.
This is hilarious. Kirk is a Trump fan and wrote something called "The MAGA Doctrine," and he's showing his racist colors by ripping on NBA players. Well done,
Is this a cure for Covid  that Trump is supporting?? !!
Anyone else feel a shift in the landscape of the Trump dictatorship today? #TrumpIsLosing #TrumpVirusDeathToll150K #ObamaWasBetterAtEverything  #Economiccollapse
IMO Trump IS using it as a rally call.
Are we just going to ignore the fact that Trump and his family all regularly vote by mail or...? 🤔🤣 #TrumpThreatensAmerica #TrumpMeltdown #TrumpIsALaughingStock #TrumpIsNotWell #TrumpVirus #Vote #VoteByMail #VoteTrumpOut
So the "I Want You All To Die' message didn't resonate with white suburban moms and old people. Sounds like NYT will need armies of "reporters" scouring heartland diners for Trump supporters who need to get their feels on.
The Coronavirus threat is still very real. But, so is having four more years of Donald Trump. Don’t sit this election out, or jeopardize your health. Vote via an absentee ballot in Ohio.  👉👉🗳  🗳👈👈
3MIL MORE Americans filed for unemployment in the last two weeks.  1.4MIL in the last seven days.  Over 30MIL are out of a job.  They said to me back in Feb-March "it won't be that bad because Trump will save us"  These are the same people who say he wins by a landslide.
Get your ballot ASAP, mail it the same day. Trump’s second election tweet was a signal that he will litigate any vote not tallied by November 3rd as illegitimate. And we will enter a constitutional crisis that will make 2000 look like a family squabble.
Hillary Clinton said to accept Donald Trump with an open mind.   Should Joe Biden win the election I will have an open mind.  Does not make me a con artist to exercise my right to vote.  Civic engagement matters more than ever.  America is on the wrong course.
The Dems let a raging monster into the house, now they're blaming Trump because it's shitting everywhere.
You either forget, or are clueless to how the Dems called Trump a racist for months for wanting to close the borders to prevent it from spreading. Dems did everything they could to prevent it. Then they spread the false narrative that Trump didn't act fast enough. You believe it
If there’s an attempt to delay or circumvent my constitutional right to a free and fair election, I will take up arms against the current Trump administration and forcefully remove them, as is my right as a free American citizen. I will lead a mighty uprising.
💪I🗽  ❤Love❤ 🇺🇸TRUMP🇺🇸 #TrumpPressConference #TrumpThreatensAmerica #Biden2020 #Trump2020
The election is delayed for Trump voters only. Pass it on. November 4 if you’re a Trump voter.
Died because of a rally organized by that same president, no less. Trump's campaign forced people to sign waivers because they knew some would almost assuredly get covid there and die. They didn't require masks and removed social distancing notices
I want a critical turning point in this country on many fronts now turning into a disaster.  We need unity and better race relations.  I am voting for Joe Biden as someone who voted for Trump because it's my civic duty to be part of a democracy that votes for change.
#Trump suggests delaying the vote “so people can properly, securely and safely vote” yet he thinks kids should go to school in the fall...never mind that in last 20 years over 250,000,000 votes have been cast by mail resulting in only 1,285 cases of proven voter fraud.#VoteByMail
I love Tucker.  I voted for President Obama twice. I voted so far once for President TRUMP. #TuckerCarlson #Election2020
You still think Trump colluded with Russia  don’t you
If the DNC was as powerful as Rose twitter leftists think it is, Donald Trump probably wouldn’t have won in the first place.
Wait wait wait?? 🤣🤣 you said you block trump supporters but yet you don’t block trump and yet your sitting here crying to a bunch of trump supporters 😂😂 oh god I’m 18 and have more sense and make more sense than joe Biden and his supporters 🤣🇺🇸🇺🇸
A lot of us have taken up day drinking
As I pointed out elsewhere, Trump is writing Joe Biden’s campaign ads. Project Lincoln understands the target audience intimately: Trump provides great copy.
Cripes. The only political donations I’ve given this year (look, I’ve got a kid in college) is to you guys, and I’m a off-the-charts liberal. But I have to do it again, because Project Lincoln is ripping Trump’s heart out.
Obama, Clinton and Bush to attend and take part in John Lewis funeral as Trump stays away
And so is Trump, obviously. We have no representation and no one fighting for us
I don’t have the numbers by district, but I’m pretty sure the Olympic Peninsula is an Obama-Trump district
Well yea...when a Trump donor running the USPS has "cost cutting" measures its gonna slow down the mail service.
Yep. August/September are going to be an important months for the GOP who have seats up for grabs. Some of them going to need to decide whether to break away from Trump publicly to save themselves.

I wouldn't believe or trust in any vaccine created up the regime of trump.
Joe Biden: Knock knock Donald Trump: Who's there? Joe Biden: Who's where?
Trump voters in 2016 had an average income of $72,000 a year.   His base is not the hillbillies the media finds and talks to, it’s the lawyers, doctors, managers, etc.   Like that couple on their front yards pointing guns at protestors.
Herman Cain is in that, um, demographic, if you will, of people that Trump really couldn't give less of a crap about if he were moved to try.  It's a category called "people who are not Donald Trump".
You know the Democrats actually don’t have much to do with this right? Like trump is just being his usual shit self
Ohio trump 2020
I’m going on record saying I’ve had endometriosis for 20+ years and haven’t had sex with a demon in my dreams or when awake. Wtf? Stella Immanuel, Trump’s New COVID-19 Doctor, Believes in Alien DNA, Demon Sperm, and Hydroxychloroquine
People who dont live in the us most likely have the worst opinions of trump lol. All they see is the 5 seconds of his speech the media wants them to.
And just to clear some things up, the "silent majority," voted for Hillary,  the Electoral college put Trump in the White House.
Thank you for your service!  Where did Trump pumps get this asinine idea that all "liberals" want destruction,  anarchy,  violence?  I'm an Independent,  voted for both parties in the past.  I cannot watch the daily shit show with Trump.   He's a danger to our democracy.
I never lied   Pres. Trump may lose the election.   I left MAGA because of hate towards me, &amp; my mental health  feeling more suicidal lately.  The pandemic and economy catering into a disaster has given me  time to think.  Problem is people like you freaking out over my honesty.
President Donald Trump met Thursday with the family of a soldier who investigators say was slain on the Texas Army base where she was stationed, saying it is a “terrible story” and that he would help with funeral expenses.

Imagine the outrage if Trump turned a funeral into a political rally to ignite his base...
If you have studied history in depth, you will understand what I am getting at. Considering the current economic and political situation due to the Pandemic,  what do you think it would have looked like if Trump had waited and ran his first campaign for 2020?
When you unfollow [YOU] are helping me trim the fat.   I do not need anything or anyone that bad.  I have already been on television. I started over in 2016 voting for Trump and broadcasting my support.  I will be just fine, in my life, if Biden or Pres. Trump wins the election.
Watching Netflix "Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich" It becomes apparent that the Majority of High Profile GOPs are Sexually Predators and thats what trump and putin have on them.
Please everyone report Trump’s tweets for voter misinformation.
To be fair, Homer Simpson makes Trump look bad...

This photo was taken at the Trump rally in Tulsa.That’s Herman Cain sitting in the Black section.  Oklahoma health officials reported record number of COVID-19 cases in the state,three weeks after President Donald…
Donald Trump is writing Joe Biden’s campaign ads, with brilliant distibution by an unlikely group of conservatives, The Lincoln Project.
is that the scheme is 1) not guaranteed to work and 2) guaranteed to cause chaos. if they defy the scheme, most will get to keep their seats will a lot less chaos. believe me this thread just terrified me but there's incentives in place, Trump's not smart enough to pull this off
#NotMyPresident   On a day when Mr Trump could have brought about HEALING &amp; RENEWAL, instead he takes a pass to please his Base.  #RestInPeaceSirJohnLewis
Trump is exponentially more capable than Joe Biden. Biden has dementia, and doesn’t even know what planet he’s on.
Why not let the Chinese and every other nation help us with a cure. Surly the Chinese are not as corrupt as Trump.
Democrats upset and blaming President Trump for the COVID spread. Blame your governors. If Trump were to make any national decisions, you all would have called him a DICTATOR.
So what happened at Trump’s press conference earlier...do I wanna know??😬
A “loophole” means that Trump is looking for a legal way to do it. When has Donald Trump been concerned with laws whatsoever?
The liberal socialist rears his 100 more votes for  Trump!!! We see u!
every GOP congress to come out and tell the voters to still vote on Nov 3 anyways, and trump has yet 2 defy the entire republican party. so the average trump rube might still see the election as illegitimate but vote anyways bc no one other than bill Barr has Trump's back on this
Opinion | What a tremendous burden it must be for you to still be defending Donald Trump - The Washington Post
That’s when they crawled out. They’re emboldened. And Trump is stoking the fires for civil war.
most republican politicians today have said they're opposed to delaying the election, and if trump pulls this shit Oct 30 they'll have the added incentive of knowing they'll lose reelection if Trump's base actually stays home, so it'll be within their own interests for (1)
I’m not a Trump fan, but I’m really getting sick of people thinking everything would be fine if only he wasn’t president.
Time to reign Trump in has long past.  You are now reaping what you  have sown.  Now, you have to fight for everything.  Leverage can be a bitch
No thank you. I’ll be in line since Trump’s got one of us packets running the USPS right now.
Thanks Trump.
Trump votes need to be able to take as much Hydroxychloroquine as they want. So unfair.
DOJ has been going after child porn and trafficking Trump's entire term. Sessions pushed the effort and it continues under Barr.
Doesn’t look like it. Wish he’d just go on the record. I’m an Army vet too, my sons were in Boy Scout Troop 6 in Cincy (same as he was), and I’m a constituent. Thanks to gerrymandering he is my district rep. and I deserve to know where he stands on Trump’s idea to pp the election
It's not secret information, but trump doesn't want you to know or it ruins his narrative.
main problem I see with this plan is that Trump's voters are really enthusiastic to vote for him and I don't see a possibility where they just decide not to show up to the polls
I’ve seen three.  And probably a thousand Trump signs.
Hurd voted to not impeach Trump for extorting a country to assist in an election

Papa John &amp; Trump  What is it with these self-destructive CRYBABIES? Papa John has tried everything to disparage the very people he once loved, his franchisees.  NOW WE HEAR DEAR-LEADER TRUMP IS THREATENING NOT TO LEAVE OUR WHITEHOUSE.  #CrazyWorld ✓
Obama did not spy on trump. Flynn, Papadopoulos, and Page, we can discuss, and go over what was monitored and why. And fast and furious was a screw up. A failure in a sting op. And the money was Irans, agreed upon by multiple nations. Now do trump.
A trump
Not in this scenario where the election is postponed. That's only in cases where neither is awarded a majority of the electors actually chosen by voters. Even then, enough delegations would likely be Dem that Trump wouldn't get 26 required. Then it goes to new Senate for VP. 😌
Trump blamed Obama for ebola. He's just recieving what he put out. Lol
Because trump blamed president Obama for the 3 people who died of Ebola. This is on him
Hey Trump, Are you to busy to go to a great mans funeral in John Lewis? Or just a big piece of shit Racist?
There is a difference between not being perfect and the MANY terrible things for which Trump is accused. And the incompetence that led to the loss of 150k lives in just SIX MONTHS. Any good he has done is completely out weighted by his failures.
Exactly. Trump was too busu bullying his sycophants into supporting his arrogant ignorance regarding a very real and serious public health emergency.
They also don’t want people to know because HCQ is cheap and out of patent. They can make billions of remdesivir, so why allow a cheaper alternative. These anti-Trump mobs eat it up too
Trump goes on TV saying "Democrats need to do this; Democrats need to do that."  D’s passed a 2nd stimulus bill on MAY 15th. Meanwhile R’s can’t even agree on a new bill within their own party!  Mr President, Dems already got their act together. Now get yours together and govern!
#Trump cannot delay a presidential election. The Constitution and law are perfectly clear. He's just paving the way for refusing to vacate after he has lost the election. As if that made any difference. I  can't wait for the video of him being politely but firmly evicted. Amen!
Look at Herman Cain saying FUCK YO MASK, FUCK YO MASK, Laughing &amp; giggling &amp; shit How many women You sexually assaulted today. And this all happened at the KLANS( I mean) Trump Rally. Stop fucking with the universe…
Reading this thread brings it home to me that, if Trump loses the election this November, millions of Americans will nevertheless insist that he "really did" win and that "mainstream media" is covering up the truth.
Trump’s grandfather⬇️ #TrumpLiesAmericansDie
Conservaties are now calling Trump a fascist and demanding his impeachment. That tweet might do more for Biden than Biden's done for Biden.  Might Try to Postpone the Election. That’s Unconstitutional.
who once stood with Trump at a campaign rally and said Trump "speaks for him" - and who has spent all of his time in the past 4 years being a Trump apologist in a gerrymandered district.  for cowardly selling out the residents of his home state.
Trump's school choice program?
I am allowed to ask questions to be more informed when I am unsure.  Does not mean I am not educated or a con artist - because I have shared reasonable concerns Pres. Trump could lose the election.  Means I am most authentic.  I appreciate my remaining support.
No she's correct. Trump blamed president Obama for Ebola, so this pandemic is on him.
You people blaming Trump are really foolish.  Shutting down for COVID 19 will surely blanket an economy...
If Democrats Force the American ppl to use mail in ballots President Trump will Lose.
John Lewis went through a whole lot in his life, still made it clear that he hated Trump and said it out loud, but I agree Rex the President should have and still could acknowledge the great John Lewis. I’m a republican and am proud to be one but a little humility goes a long ...
When a communist crook funded by a Nazi calls President Trump an authoritarian &amp; racist... project much there Bernie?
Sickening.  Degenerate  Blames Trump For Herman Cain’s Death  via
They want to blame Trump and call him racist for these deaths.
I think it’s funny Trump wants to delay the election this November so everybody can safely vote 😂 yeah ight. You don’t care about our safety.
We are going to reach pluperfect levels hitherto unheard of come 2032 when theirs articles about how well-spoken Trump was.
Why do Trump supporters continue to say this president is going to win by a landslide.  Are you sure friends?   I just do not see any path now for this president to win.  What are you seeing other than Trump flags, boat parades, &amp; tweets online reading he will win by a landslide.
Did Trump mentioned Tulsa and the no masks?
You're a  damn liar. The same Chinese Trump has been asking favors to help him win re-election? Infact China has become more powerful since the election of Donald Trump. What Trump and his administration have done was fighting stupid tariff wars. President Xi knows Trump is inept
ABSOLUTELY! If another President said about him what he implied about President Trump...Holy Shit Batman! What a backlash there would be!!! 🇺🇸✌
📢 Another nail in the Impeached President Trump's coffin.
I've heard trump from his own mouth bragging about walking in on undressed young girls and comments that sexualized his daughter. Never heard that from Biden. Why do you suppose trump hasn't turned over that court ordered dna sample yet for his pending rape case?
Bernie got screwed again. Fuck them, I voting Trump!
He knows the whole dirty scam they have been running and now he is taking them down. Why do you think they are fighting Trump so hard?
Hahaha "never criticized the GOP or Trump" yeah dude you must have spent days going back and reading everything I've ever posted or liked on here. Thanks for taking such an interest in everything I've ever said. You missed a lot though
Why do I continue to watch a Donald Trump press conference?    It's like watching your child trying to explain why they didn't break the recliner even though you sat right there and watched them do it.
My hubby just told me that when Trump had talked about this, Moscow Mitch said it's not going to happen.  He's spent millions of taxpayer money on himself or his family, personally. As POTUS, Pre-virus, his companies were making money.
Dude was the MAIN one calling COVID a hoax too w/ Trump smh 🤦🏽‍♂️
It’s amazing how ineptly Trump has tried to establish an autocracy, given that Vladamir Putin is his mentor.
I’m at the “no-fucks” state of the election cycle where I will absolutely tell you to your face that I think you are a big dumb idiot if you vote for trump or a third party candidate. I do. Why hide it? I can pretend publicly I don’t but in private I think you’re really stupid 🤷🏼‍♀️
Trump underminds our democracy every minute of every day. With your support.
Bars should’ve been closed. How you gonna have bars open but not churches 😂 shit is a mess bro. Trump supporters should be embarrassed. That man has handled all this shit so poorly
It is a good one, highly recommend you get a chance, you look at it, guarantee you this much you never look at Andy Griffith the same way again. And, pretty much explains Trump's whole con-artist game. He was a scoundrel in this one. 😷😎
We have President Trump because of the Obama Biden administration
Just got off a Zoom with Lincoln Project. Rick said you’re keeping a fund to combat trump’s legal BS. You know it’s going to happen. He’ll litigate, because he can’t win.
there is a zero percent chance trump doesn't challenge the election results if he loses.  that was a thinly veiled threat.    "litigation"  ya okay pal, fuck you
Why would Pres. Trump want to delay the election when he says things are great in this country. Corona virus will go away on it's own in the heat.  If things are so great in this country and the landslide support for his election win in Nov. - why the push to delay the election?
It’s conceivable that the  would say ‘just settle for Trump’ if he were never president and ran as a ‘moderate’ democrat.
They blame EVERYTHING on Trump. I heard the small earthquake in L.A. was  .... blamed on Trump
Trump literally tweeted yesterday about keeping poor and rich people apart
It was a Democratic Hoax, remember?  Now all these Trump Supporters are either dead or looking like a joke
If my speech students had ever delivered a speech in this Trump monotone, I would have given them a very, very low grade and lots of coaching!
My brother says Trump is greatest US president.  Ever.  Hard to learn that my brother is a moron.
Oh yeah it’s Trump trying to rig the election! That’s why every fricken election Democrat votes keep being found until the candidate wins! How come they never find Republican votes? #dirtydems
WATCH LIVE: President Trump holds a coronavirus press briefing  (Live stream is embedded in this article)
Why Trump read stuff like he never seen words before? Like the alphabet is new?
Oh I have plenty tweets saved that I will upload after Trump wins!
I believe that Trump said this to put the Democrats in the corner, and have to have the election which will be in person.  Then they will have to accept the results.  end of story.
This from the co-founder of the Federalist Society, and still NOTHING from you two  and
If the current trajectory continues on many fronts without a critical turning point Pres. Trump will lose the election --on the contrary to your adamant support and promoting him on your social media "that he will win by a landslide."  Things are not great in this country.
Remember kids, if Trump somehow delays the November election, the Constitution states his term will still end in January, and he will be replaced by the Speaker of the House of Representatives until an election occurs.    #NotMyPresident
Trump proposes delay federal elections until it's 'safe'—something he doesn't have the power to do
The near-universal rebuke of Trump's idea to delay the election gave me a rare bit of optimism today  #TrumpFailsAmerica
It was the man's biggest passion in life so yeah I'd say it's ok to talk about said persons biggest passion at their funeral.  Trump can eulogize Mr. Cain and talk about his ferocious opposition to masks and being willing to die for his beliefs too if he'd like
You know you can take practical steps to ending trafficking if you vote out its benefactors like Trump.
Ahhhhhh, so its more than just a Trump rally going on. You guys, stick to the narrative (and show some respect for Mr Caine)
I never said I was a Trump supporter. I'm just definitely not a Democrat supporter. I don't like either parties. I want a full on revolution of peace and love. An end to human trafficking and ritualistic sacrifice to demons. I just want to raise the consciousness of this planet
There's a hitch in his voice when he is about to deliver the line that will be seen as an attack on Trump.   Maybe it's just me but I like it. It makes me believe that his heart isn't behind the attack. That it's not who he is, just who he needs to be in the moment.
If Trump seriously wanted the reopening of schools, he would have taken the coronavirus  very seriously, instead of whining and calling it hoax. He finally waved the White flag and surrendered to COVID-19 and now want our children to return to school with no safety guidelines
It’s not just Trump. It’s also a third of our voting population, at least, who continue to cheer him. Even if he’s out of office Jan, we still have to deal with them.
Herman Cain died so that Trump could prove he can drink a glass of water with one hand. #dyingforTrump
We call it Trump.
These Trump-wears-a-mask news stories are like congratulating a toddler for using the potty instead of peeing all over the floor
Not for this corrupt dolt. Not while I'm still breathing and can do anything about it! Look, if it's close (not the scenario anticipated) we could have another Bush v. Gore and SCOTUS could side with Trump. But that's not the same as SCOTUS ruling for Biden and military mutinying
Have you ever seen a Republican group , let alone three, campaign against one of their own so hard like they have Trump? Lincoln Project Midas media Etc.?
So glad we have Trump and Melania in the White House, and not that one dude Barry and his husband Michael.
Mail in voting? Like the kind Trump does?
Y’all gon stop using the constitution as this “end all be all” idea...  Bc like I know that’s what they said it was but really cmon guys   We are smarter than this.   If Trump wants to delay this election, he will find a way.
Governors and the dems are most the blame right?  I mean Trump at first, but he quickly seen we needed to reopen
Thank you Erick for setting the record straight.Mika is no longer a journalist but rather a Trump attacker even at the cost of her own credibility 😔#BOO 👎
Trump pence McConnell.
tRump....... the tweeter in chief 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Don’t think you do
Curious, Where the the hell is Trump?! Why is he not at the funeral?! You know what, don't even answer that, nevermind, pitiful. RIP John RIP, 🙏
Who cares? Its all loser talk from LOSERS. Thats like losing your baseball game then saying "but we had more hits". No one cares dude, you LOST. You dems try to cling onto anything you can dont you, loser. Trump won, get over it.Let me guess... you think millionaire Trump is the champion of the working class?
Obviously, Trump was closer to Herman Cain more than we realized. I mean he popped just thinking about it. #skeetskeetyouidiot
Trump is having trouble breathing.    Looks tired.
President Trump is a blubbering doughboy bully who can't back up a word he says.
Of course it’s my birthday when trump states his newest steal the election scam. Guaranteeing I never forget the day he threatened to end free and fair elections. Welp, I guess everydays somebody’s birthday and everyday some new crazy shit we’ll never forget. Come on November.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, isn't doing his job. He must clear out...of the People's House.
Leave it to  to make me feel better. As sad as I am for the loss of John Lewis, President O helped get me back to what’s important and that’s voting and getting in to some good trouble! Also, the way he burns trump without even saying his name is what I live for. 👍
Grasping at straws. He is going down 11.03.20. Trump floats November election delay, but it won't happen (from
This is funny as shit, in ine tweet Trump told the Democrats if its so dangerous maybe we should delay it...only for them to throw a fit and nullify their argument.
I was watching hearing today. One asked about the interview w trump if he would except nov Elections out come. He said he’s not going to say yes or no!       Why doesn’t anyone understand he’s not going to play games with the fake news??? Or better yet he is playing their game!
LOL. Are you that willfully blind?  Trump has cut taxes &amp; is fighting to cut more taxes unlike previous administrations who have done nothing but add taxes of all sorts even labor tax is charged besides sales tax how crazy is that? Trump doesn't need our money he's already rich.
Newnow always on Trump's neck.
Yea that’s it you sound ignorant hey why’s Trump wearing a mask now ?
The fact a Trump acknowledges he has never once addressed Russian support monetarily and otherwise with Putin says it all.
Democrats, and MSM, don’t want a cure for the virus. They will sacrifice lives to bring down president trump.
On a road trip this week. Interesting that I haven't (yet) seen a Trump flag while riding through Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, and Kentucky.  Saw quite a few Confederate flags in Tennessee, but no Trump flags.
I’m excited about NC’s chances of turning blue (or bluer) this year. I believe our Gov. Roy Cooper will win again. Also, we have a strong chance of winning a US Senate seat with candidate Cal Cunningham. Joe is running neck and neck with Trump.
Don't forget everyone to display your patriotic colors in support for November Trump 2020 all the way!   Let him finish what he started drain the swamp build the wall rebuild our infrastructure reclaim the US for American citizens!!!
Trump has done more with out help and opposition at every turn then Obama did in a positive manner in 8 years. Trump is 100% for America ending our dependency on foreign countries. You need to open your eyes and quit depending on fake news in facts.
I’m voting for trump. Kentucky.
Thats untrue!   After terrist Obama ruined us &amp; set us up for long term failure you should be honored Trump even agreed to try and fix this mess of a country! Tell the house to get their stuff together &amp; work to real and common goals! Collectively for the US not foreign entities!
And, by not bringing it up, Putin knows he’s working from a position of strength when dealing with Trump.

Barr had just agreed earlier that it was true he had said “Trumps tweets made it difficult for him to do his job.”  How would Barr know the tweets caused him any difficulty if he doesn’t read Trump’s tweets???
what If I told you I’m friends with a rapist or a racist but that doesn’t matter bc he has done other good things 😂😂 Thats how stupid you Trump supporters sound. Straight up.
Because Trump lies about everything. Simple truth!

"And there, but for the grace of god, go I".  I have to make sure my own politics don't blind me as well.   I lean to the notion: if Trump likes it, then it is very likely wrong or actively harmful.   I gotta make sure there are other things I base my opinion on. Working on that.

Not surprising. It's quite like asking a hungry lion if it's going to devour it's prey. Trump is no more shocking to the world. #JohnLewis ❤️🙏🏽
Joe Biden could still lose this election

What a bunch of losers. If this is true, it's soooooo fitting for Trump.
Correct. Like electoral college. Trump won’t win Chicago NY or LA. Biden will have 3 million votes more. I’m just glad NY or LA dictate the election. Founding Fathetd were very intelligent. Trump will win the electoral college.

Which of these words is Donald Trump’s favorite?Its not just "norms" this is how the government is setup. It's setup this way for someone such as trump. For that very reason. Federal government cannot interfere with a state held election. The president can't postpone any election, for the prevention of a dictator.
Oh my god! Do you not know how government works? The point is moot, because trump cannot do anything to change the election date. That is decided by congress, not the president. And only each state decides their elections, not the federal government.

It needs to be an option. That’s all I’m saying. And we should try to make in person voting as safe as possible for those who want to do it that way. But Trump is spreading false claims about mail in fraud, and needing to delay the election, because why? Does he know he’s losing?

I believe even some of the Republicans in Congress found their guts long enough to say “Fuck that!” to Trump.  Of course that was only because they finally realized that he was trying to neuter them.
This record economic plunge is a direct result of the abject failure of the GOP, Trump and McConnell to make sure America was adequately prepared for a pandemic. It’s the result of Trump, McConnell and the GOP not giving a damn about you, me and every non-wealthy American. #shame

It’s very odd to see “Christians”grovel at the feet of Trump who just holds up a bible to show his Christianity and those same people say Obama who ALWAYS tells stories FROM the Bible is not a Christian. But I left Christianity a long time ago so.

When I first saw this, my immediate thought was “Surely he’s not smart enough to have this kind of foresight.” But if 2016 and and his presidency have taught us anything, it’s that Trump is brilliant when it comes to his own self preservation.

Yes, so much of Trump's schtick is just yelling really loud and seeing what foolishness sticks or distracts people from his incompetence. But eventually, some of y'all institutionalists might have to consider that institutional systems hold up only until they...don't.
People who keep saying things like “Trump can’t do such and such only Congress/the States can” forget that Trump and his minions do not care what the law is.

There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud through mail-in voting, even in states with all-mail votes.

People laughed out loud at anyone suggesting that he'd ever try to do this. Biden included when he suggested Trump would try it.   The current President floated the idea of delaying an election he is projected atm to lose. How is ANYONE with any objectivity left okay with that?
This is a distraction from the economic numbers.  Don't fall for it.  Everyone including Trump knows that there is no way at all that the election is going to be delayed.
That is really good projection there. Leftists have been fine with attacking Trump supporters. They even murdered one in Minneapolis. You probably approved of that one.

Thanks for sharing SB! I have seen a lot of people propping up Biden with BLM, which is why I originally asked these questions. People do this with every candidate at every level (i.e. Christians propping up Trump &amp; McConnell) and I think more people should realize this.
If you know anything about housing history you’ll understand the racist Trump cult is continuing America’s horrible legacy of white supremacy
Going out on a limb but there’s only one Trump.  And he’s not in Europe or Asia.
But back in the day isn't now. What Trump rescinded literally came from an administration in which Joe Biden was #2.  Why even make such a remark?
As long as it doesn't affect Trump!
2. Conservative pages, especially large ones, perform better than almost EVERY OTHER large pages, AND without social media (esp. FB) and it’s influence in 2016, Trump would not have been elected. “Liberal bias” might exist but not on the external side of FB. Numbers back that up.

Ya didn't care last time either.  You and Trump supports deserve each other.
No in won't shut the fuck up.  1. I don't think you voted for HRC. you've got Jill Stein / non-voter all over you.  2. People like you are to blame for Trump. 100%.
And there are sooooo many people that fit this description. Force them to pick a side and just may not go the way Trump thinks it will.
When people ask me what disgusts me most about Trump I have a hard time finding a single answer. But my Dad spoke proudly of “standing post” in the forest outside Garmisch in 1950 when they thought WWIII was imminent.  He would be horrified at how far we have fallen.

And Trumps policy is anti-union. Anti-working class. Etc. Just read the policy itself, it's not hard.  Trump as also been in charge for 4 years so you can see his actions as well.  Biden has been a private citizen and anytime things he did as VP you all say "that was Obama"

I never ceased to be amazed and confused by the extent to which Trump has been successful in selling his “I’m the victim” narrative. People project virtue on him and idealize him in a way I’ve never seen with any other POTUS. It’s wild to me

Trump is a complete moron. It shouldn’t be hard to expose him on camera. Why does any journalist play along, pretending that Trump in any way has the capability or interest in being President? Trump would have to bust it to reach half-assed level. Why don’t journos expose him?

Because overreaching leads to Trump.  Biden is where the voters are and that's how democracy works.
Absolutely right. The whole national GOP organization is responsible for this unprecedented mess ala traitor tRump. They need to be crushed at the polls.
Historically that doesn't happen. It's why minimum wage goes up, civil rights improve over time, environmental laws become more strict, etc.  What sets us back is when we do things that lead to guys like Trump in office. (like shitting on Biden the whole election cycle).
And the betrayal of our country and our allies continues by the bloody traitor in the White House. Where are the Republican Senators to hold him accountable? They have abdicated to the Russian ASSet tRump. Despicable.
If we have a public option for a bit, it'll be easier to move to a single payer.  If we have more female justices it prevents Roe from being overturned.  If we have more support for unions we can get better workers rights quicker.  Trump actively campaigns against those things.
That's all semantics what you consider the "wing" of the party.  Biden isnt in the 1% of progressivism but honestly, a huge margin of progressives are solidly supporting Biden.  Biden doesnt get you everything you want but it keeps you on track. Trump actively pulls you away.
Exclusive: Trump never raised Russia's Taliban bounties with Putin
Totally delusional traitor tRump.
Donald Trump bought ads on #Facebook making false statements about vote-by-mail in an effort to suppress the vote. I want key federal regulators to investigate.
Mr. Trump is and always has been a shyster.   He has been that way for most of hisife.

Indeed ... it wouldn’t surprise me if, with all this COVID spending and our nat’l debt heading up to $30 trillion, if the tea party made a resurgence   Granted, it’s not a sexy platform, but it’s grassroots  and would be more conservative than Trump
Trump stooge. Perfect.
President Trump says he did not address reports from U.S. intelligence agencies that said Russia paid bounties to the Taliban in exchange for the deaths of American soldiers in a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week.
Putin wants to dismantle NATO, and Trump is helping him. Where is the  outrage?
Silent Majority is real. I wear my trump mask to the store and I get many compliments each time.
Trump ignores the COVID virus even though it affects all Americans.  Reagan did not move fast on AIDS because it was believed, since then proven wrong, that it was a gay disease.  America in 2020 recognizes that they are people, unfortunately that attitude was not part of the 80s
Too embarrassed to publicly admit they support trump.
Reagan and Trump are not alike.  You may not agree with Reagan but he not want to divide our nation and would never call fellow Americans the ugly names that Trump calls other Americans.  Trump ignored COVID even though we know it affects all Americans.
Trump!!!
Why are you lying when we all can see the truth. We are in 2020, everything is exposed. We have the videos. Seems like you are a racist just like Trump and Barr.
One is anti fascist and the other anti police brutality that targets the Black community.  Antifa is there to counter pro trump white nationalist and other white supremicist groups.
Different systems, obviously, but I think Trump in Brazil is equal if not worse than Bolsonara. Both have authoritarian and crony corrupt lawless tendencies. Our system has mostly checked his worst impulses but those impulses are being laid bare under COVID.
Bolsonara is the Brazilian Trump.
Well, chatted with a couple friends on facebook, they both blocked me🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 They love trump to much...😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄 I've known them for 45 years...!! trump is dividing the best of friends...😄😁 Oh well.
Apparently Trump doesn't give a damn about Russia paying the Afghanistan terrorists money to kill Americans. That is disgusting and criminal. Where is our decency and honor?
Biden is leading by 10 points.  His strategy is to stay quiet and let trump talk—trump speaking is the best Biden for President commercial.
tRump, the traitorous Russian ASSet.
Is all you have left whataboutism? I mean, it's no more disputing things, it's just saying "whatabout this thing." Kinda just shows how bad Trump is that you can't even defend what he is doing.

Trump: “That was a phone call to discuss other issues.” Reminds us of  Neville Chamberlain: “A far away country of which we know nothing.” History has been tough on the latter - we shall see about the former.
Rocker Neil Young is “reconsidering” an earlier decision not to legally challenge the Trump administration for using his music at events.
"He had a right to have his voice, and he was so strong to do it alone," a longtime friend said. "We lost a man who cared about people, even if they were different than him."
I understand police have to support Trump because he is the closest option to them. But ultimately he hasn't done anything to help them either. All he has is twitter support. But I guess that is better than Biden by a long shot.
Sounds like someone doesn't wanna beat Trump.

Those were not just accusations. Those were facts. The guy clearly referred to the white house right away, so what else you needed to hear? More outrageous words telling yoi he's just a tool of Trump?!
The government doesn't have an unlimited amount of money.  With the way Trump is handling the virus we won't be rid of it for years and there's no way he'll let Congress keep handing out stimulus checks.
It’s really offensive.  They think their voters are dumb—Which based on what I’ve seen—is probably a decent estimate.  I think trump is doing a last second cash grab before he is voted out of office.
Because he has no idea what he's doing and 150,000 Americans have died.

You better hope so because it looks like Trump is gonna need all the help he can get.
Also, as long as we’re recording observations, Trump would never have been elected if you could still get Jello pudding pops. Because everyone would be much less angry. And smarter. And more willing to listen. And less willing to waste time on hacks.
As expected, Trump requiring covid numbers being sent to HHS instead of CDC resulted in IMMEDIATE lying about the facts. This disgusting monster has absolutely no limit to his dishonesty.

Wow dude. You want him to restrict a constitutionally protectes right?  Also, zero proof that protests are even causing any issues.   Finally, the Trump admin was the one that suggested this. Go complain to him. He's the reason ot got so bad here anyways.
Very minimal; considering he donates his salary every year, I’m willing to bet the last thing he is worried about is his stake in that company
Trump has tried to rebrand himself repeatedly. The former reality show star has been a failure as a human and as a businessman for his entire life. We still haven’t seen his taxes, as promised. Why?

LOL! Trump just got depantsed so hard he had to tuck tail and flee like a bitch. As President of the United States maybe he should show a little more care in what messages he broadcasts to the world.

Another sad victim of Trump's disinformation campaign calling coronavirus a hoax.
Trump is going to suffer a legendary annihilation no matter who Biden picks for vice president. And he's going to drag down the entire Republican party along with him. Which will be a very good thing because perhaps it can return more to a Reagan style party.

The Trump administration will begin allowing so-called "Dreamer" immigrants to renew their permits to remain and work in the U.S. for a year while it reviews a Supreme Court ruling.
It's going to take 8 years just to prosecute all the crimes Trump committed in 4.
I don't know why nobody follow up and asks what Trump did from the time he was elected until January.  If it was a problem, then it should have been fixed.  Sitting on it for 3 years is not the correct answer.
In the post-Trump world Republicans will use the Trump administration’s corruption and failures as proof government is inherently bad and you should vote for them instead of the government-loving Dems.
Big money fighting hard ...
If you view impact as preventing the changes trump would be able to make in his second term that would be generational in scope ie stacking the Supreme Court any number of other things, this is correct.

The Trump administration has formally asked the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to develop regulations that could apply to Facebook, Twitter and other such platforms.
Old man, you've lost your mind! You ain't just trippin'! You've fallen down and can't get up! You and that weasel trump probably invested in that useless crap.
My opinion is once America has decided which way to go, everyone else will follow or fight! Either way COVID has taken way too many unnecessarily! All for what! To dethrone Trump! They could t do it any other way than killing a SHIT TON of people! I thought the Clintons were bad!
And We get a BRAND NEW FBI Building during Covid-19!Thanks to Donald Trump!
This is beyond absurd. For all that the Executive, Legislative + Judicial branches have let us down in the time of Trump, none have failed more alarmingly than the political press. It’s not even limited to cable, since reporters for the most storied papers also appear in this.
Something else is in play here for Trump etc. because no one would honestly expect this to incentivize much at all Reason only 50% is deductible now: regardless of the topic/reason for a meal, a person would be eating anyway (personal expense).
Everyone in the world will see how orchestrated this pandemic was the minute the election is over! If Trump wins; then all hells going to break loose and the COVID shit will be pushed to the side! If Biden wins; there’s a cure by January! The Virus disappears! In my opinion!
The vaccines they are working on now will not work on the mutated virus of today. It was developed to fight the unmutated virus. But, trump will claim success anyway.

Whaaat? Trump lied?
Idiot.  Not the time.
He will be there.  He knows that he is untouchable for the time being and also believes that he can score points for Trump.  None of it really matters because when Trump loses he will grant Barr a pardon prior to leaving office.  Barr can then work  and nobody will care.

What does that have to do with Trump's advisor Dr. Birk's recommendation?
I didn’t blame it on Trump. I said it took place in his Presidency. The reasons why are numerous   And my comment was not about division, it was about how people define themselves by politics, not others   But my point is the same. I am sorry if I offended him with my kidding
It should be a front page story every day. Trump has done nothing to help the states, intercepting shipments of PPE, trying to profit from every angle. Historical disgrace.
Imagine if Trump had said that about Obama? Hell would've broken loose, disrespectful, she's lost her mind, but that's ok because Trump will be reelected for 4 more years,

Guess I’m blind then 🤷🏼‍♂️ love ya bro but for as strong as I am against Trump, you’re doubling down even stronger against Biden. I’m not enthused about him, but I don’t buy the doom and gloom rhetoric. I’ve heard it all my life, and it goes back WAY further than the 90s. It’s hype
I know you’re convinced bro. Otherwise you wouldn’t have said it. As much as I dislike Trump, even I am not saying he will “destroy America”, because I think America is stronger than that. People have told me a Dem POTUS would “destroy America” all my life. Never happened 🤷🏼‍♂️
You should work on reading comprehension. I didn’t blame it on Trump. I said it happened while he was President  And your response to me just validated what I said
this cannot be real #wtfock #WTF
Good thing Trump and his staff wear masks all the time.
The “right” suggested for 8 years that Obama wasn’t even an American (led by Trump). In fact Trump rose to prominence by daily criticisms of Obama on Fox. Mitch said on day one his job was to make Obama fail   The idea that GOP is blameless is total nonsense

What's your point? The Trump campaign illegally used Reagan in advertising. They were told to stop. It only becomes a big deal if Trump continues to violate the law.
You're right, Reagan is absolutely rolling over in his grave. Trump has distorted the GOP beyond recognition. It may take a while, but hopefully the Republican party will find its way again after Trump.
Social media has become the target of a dueling attack ad campaign being waged online by the sitting president and his election rival. They’re shooting the messenger while giving it lots of money.

Trump's should have. If Obama's wasn't up to par they should have done one that was. They had many meetings with South Korea. They could have collaborated on it. They didn't. They failed us. Period.
Of course. After denying that they gave it, now they are pretending it wasn't comprehensive enough. A. If you hate Obama so much, why are you relying on him to solve a problem. B. Solve your own fucking problem The buck never stops with Trump for you guys, does it?
If you notice the date, it was created in December of 2016 to turn over to the new administration. Trump literally walked us right into a pandemic because he hated President Obama.
Just curious, since you voted for Johnson, did you expect the GOP to roll over with Trump to the degree they did?
but he's a Democrat right, he was one of the good Trump advisers, right guys? (obv sarcasm)
Bottom line is he diseased hatred that Trump and his follower have toward Obama led to him junking a legit and functional plan that would have saved American lives. You can blame Fox News for that, the Tea party, racsim, or Trump or all of them. But you can't blame Obama.
Here comes a ton of them. You ready?
That is no excuse.
Omgosh! Is trump lactating? WTF?!
It was a 69 page playbook that basically stated to do exactly what SK did. Trump, wanting to be the opposite of Obama, did the opposite and people died.
You're right. Obama is gone. But they had a plan I. Place that mirrored what SK did. That plan was scrapped by Trump.
This isn't about Obama. Our federal govt, including Trump now that he runs it, should have learned from MERS and had a plan in place. They did not. They chose to drag their feet and do exactly the opposite of what South Korea did and people died.

Hey,  Foundation - you just asked Trump to stop using Reagan's name and likeness for fundraising; you might want to have a word with this person as well...
Yes. We failed. The Trump admin failed. Obama wasn't president during this and hadn't been for 3 years. If Obama didn't have something in place (he did) it is still incumbent on the current admin to response better. They didn't. They failed us.

Why is it that everything is blame on Trump. He didn't make the protesters steal and burn down businesses but he get blame for ir he didn't make that police kill George Floyd but he got blame for it.
One of my earliest and most serious problems with Trump was the way he weakened our alliances and cuddled up to dictators.
Do you believe Trump was on a path to reelection before Covid?  If honest I don't think you did.  The economy was simply a continuation of what was inherited as opposed to what Obama inherited.  Tax breaks?  We saw the same trickle down failure with RR and took Clinton to cleanup
We shall see how that translates to actual votes.  I agree wholeheartedly with his point that Trump now has a record and it's that record of failure that will be his demise in November.  Can't say drain the swamp when all that's been done is pardon the felons and appoint future 1

Come on! We all know that given the choice he would rather go to a sad barely attended Trump rally, than spend years more with his family and friends. He got just what he wanted. Bless his heart.

Trump took credit for the super hot economy when he took office. Now, with 33% drop in GDP, his ability to make decisions to spur growth is shown to be fraudent. #Biden2020
I've been huffing lysol spray disinfectant from a kitchen garbage bag, for good measure I'm gonna swill down a 16 oz glass of clorox bleach. thank goodness for president trump's rock solid, scientific medical advice. 🤮
Trump 2020
Empathy is non existent with fuzzy head. Does anyone think he has any remorse for Mr. Cain dying after attending his get Covid-19 event? Hell no! He won't be losing any sleep over the dead Americans the Trump Virus has caused.
And if you die from attending trump tulsa rally, remember you signed a waiver.
It's only close right now. After the debates, the margin will widen significantly in Trump's favor.
I k ow people that get so excited to dress for surgery
Waiting for the Donald Trump tweet about the NBA kneeling....
Donald Trump was not a racist until he was elected. Liberals, in desperate need of a narrative, seemed to forget that he had many black political friends and even dated a black woman.  Am I smelling desperation from white liberals?
It’s interesting to me that Trump has the second highest approval rating on Coronavirus in Kentucky of any state in America (only Alabama higher)  Yet Beshear also has the 10th highest approval rate on Coronavirus of any Governor in America   In Kentucky we are just happy I guess
Listening to President Obama, a genuine, intelligent, compassionate, honest, respectful man earlier today, and then, having to listen to a rambling, deceitful, lying conman make believe president, nearly unbearable. Trump should have been removed long ago.  #TrumpWorsensDaily
Unfortunately, it may depend on if you are a Republican or Democrat. There are a lot of people who are devoted Trump followers and will continue to follow his example no matter how many people die. It's the mask and social distancing. Some people just want to have fun + ignore it
For those of you who always write me and say “Trump is going to win!”, I would add this  A man who thinks he is winning (or is winning) does not publicly float the idea of delaying the election
Seriously. Like trump is going to give it a factual response if asked.
Kentucky!!!  TRUMP 2020!
why do trump supporters make liking trump their whole personality? like they all have flags, hats, shirts, etc. with trump 2020 on them. they’re legit a cult
Whenever you lend your credibility to Trump, he is sure to burn you. You are there now.
Biden has a tough road to undo everything Trump has done to our country
This is on you and trump.  No one else.  The House passed a bill a couple of months ago that YOU have failed to act on.  Your false statements are not believed.  You are a lying traitor who should have left office a long time ago.  Blood is on YOUR hands
Trump knows stuff. If they get away with the mail-in voting . The results form the election we're going to be a debacle like no other.  He's just playing his hand 😁
So Trump says it’s safe to open schools but too unsafe to have an election?
if you’re still a trump guy right now you can get yourself hands-free hard at the thought of getting to vote for him again, this is nonsense
He was not atJohnnLewis Funeral wherebClinton, Bush and Obama all gavevremarks and were well received. They have class and grace. Trump does not!
Donald Trump should resign.  Pass it on
That was exhausting to listen to. He is exhausting. Glad you kept him on track about answering the question about Trump's tweet this morning. He's disgusting, trying to play that off.

Just when I couldn’t hate another human more than I hated trump yesterday, it goes to a new level today
Have the rest of you resisters noticed that now Trump is saying...it’s not workers fault they’re out of work, it’s China’s fault”? He believes if he says that line enough Americans won’t blame him for the Covid dumpster fire he created——China did. So they’ll vote for him. SAD
Really.  In “Lawrence of Arabia” the “it is written” was altered by some direct action.  Like, you know, doing the hard thing.  Trump/GOP are not interested in doing the hard thing.   And people die because of it.
Trying to avoid anything Trump???
Serves Trump right!!!
I’m done. #BLM #covid19 #Trump #GETOUTOFOURHOUSE
With Trump as president, the whole world is jail.
Well he’s scum #Trump
Why is  and  airing trump?  Are they trying to prove to us he is crazy?  We already knew that
It puts the Biden on its skin or it gets the Trump again!
Thank God for Mitch McConnell and President Trump.
Yeah, it did!!!🤭  Obama's jab at Trump gets standing ovation
They sure don't hide their hatred for Trump 🙄
Trump will win regardless of how many people vote for Biden. It’ll be a repeat of the 2016 election.
Herman Cain passed away from the Trump virus
I love how Trump plays the Democrats like a fish before he sets the hook. Bravo!!
Everything Trump touches dies
Yeah, but I have a hard time respecting anyone who took this long. It shouldn’t have been hard.  His line is probably drawn more because of new polls than anything. Trump vote obviously lost cause.
He shouldn't have caught a "Democratic hoax". He shouldn't have died from "it's just the flu". Who in leadership has been spreading these lies and telling people they don't need masks? Oh yeah, Trump. He believed Trump, he caught it, and now he's dead.
Trump wanting to delay the election is just the very beginning of him trying to cheat and steal the election .... again.
To clear any confusion... Trump wants to delay the election to avoid mail in voting which will end up in fraudulent voting.
Trump always tests the waters.  Like how he said he could fire Mueller before he tried to fire Mueller.  This was a dance rehearsal to see if he had any weak links on his side.  Trump found even Lindsey Graham unwilling to move the election.
He is a Trump supporter so...
Herman Cain made his own decisions so blaming President Trump for the communist Chinese delivered Covid-19 is as ignorant as blaming the post office for the poisoned seeds being sent to Americans from communist China.
Stop with the election being postponed  Everytime you keep it going you're showing you got played. Trump plays Twitter tactics , smarten up!  Orchestrated Choas is the plan
He hasn’t though &amp; has a mass amount of supporters. Very loyal supporters who are all around us. Biden doesn’t have the following to immediately win this, and he isn’t gaining them quickly. People can’t stand him either and every Independent vote is a vote for Trump...
You hate it here? Then follow Trump’s words and go back to where you came from. Isn’t that how it’s supposed to work?
Where was Trump today?  A national treasure has been lost and he's nowhere to be found-sad!  America is in pain!  "The story that began in Troy isn't ending here today"  #axiospm

#FascistTrump can't legally change the election date, but his desire denotes his willingness, and work already done, to obstruct the election any way he can get away with. Remove Trump by Force Now. Remove Trump by Force Now. Remove Trump by Force Now. Remove Trump by Force Now.
just look at recent history, voter harvesting has been the staple of the Republican Party not the Democrats!!! Just look at the last election and Russian meddling with Trump’s approval. We don’t know how many votes were harvested!!!
In response to  response to Trump’s “delay the election” tweet, I tweeted “Thank you, possible President Pelosi.”  I’m no expert, but I know some things. And I research some things.   Some responses from Twitter Scholars...
Is he now trump's black?
Y’all r funny! Don’t know how to take a joke ! Lol trump is not wanting to be a dictator!
thinks that he can Tweet a delay in the national election.  WRONG!  Only Congress can do that, but why would they? Becuz DJT says mail-in voting is fraudulent? Without ANY evidence?  The election on Nov 3rd should not just defeat Trump, it should CRUSH trumpism!
Holy fuck.  You would never get Trump to focus long enough to get through the questionnaire.   They ask a lot of questions to donate blood. Trump isn’t good with questions.
#FascistTrump's tweet about the election really should not be let go. It is as bad as it sounds, even if he hasn't the legal authority to do it. But it portends obstruction of the election to come. So... Remove Trump by Force Now. Or it's getting really BAD. And soon.
There is nothing more important than voting trump out of office in November.
Did you see what Trump said today? He wants to delay the November election...I feel like we're in his fav place, Moscow

Can y'all just stop backing trump already? He's like, objectively horrible

Awesome! My soul needed to hear President Obama. My TV volume was turned up so that his voice would permeate the entire house. So tired of the ignorance, intolerance, hatred and lies we get from Trump and his enablers these days.
Don't be ridiculous. Trump can so get out of his basement. And then he lies about being IN the basement! His IQ is marginal &amp; his cognitive abilities are severely diminished. He believes a cognition test is an intelligence test &amp; he brags about passing it. It was SO hard!
And count on Pompeo to run for president come 2024. STAY VIGILANT PEOPLE - THIS DOES NOT END WITH TRUMP!!
Trump 2020. America needs him more than ever
Donald Trump should resign.  Pass it on.
Can you imagine trump in the crowd at the church?? Sniffling, fidgeting, pretending to not listen, wondering if his funeral will have a bigger crowd. He definitely was not needed at this service.
And he could have been alive today, especially if they practiced social distancing. Does anyone think Trump is remorseful or even cares? If you do, you haven't been paying attention.

Q: Respond to Trump's suggestion to delay the November election? Beshear: I don't believe we should delay the election. We should have no excuse absentee ballots, early voting, and more polling locations than we had in the primary.
Trump gave his base 2 conservative justices on SCOTUS, ~200 federal judges, tax cuts, deregulation (except for immigration), a trade war with China, and y’all think they’ll desert him b/c of #COVID19?  An impeachment, 30+ million jobs &amp; 250K deaths were simply labor costs.
Oh yeah, I do feel better. That speech especially his indictment of trump was spot on!
Exactly wont be like 2016 Trump will suffer an historic defeat in 2020.
has killed Herman Cain. He attended a Trump rally prior to testing positive for Covid &amp; died today of Covid. So Trump has personally killed 151,496 &amp; Mr Cain. Even though Cain was Republican I still call this #AmericanGenocide. He didn’t deserve to die
Trump can come in pretty strong against the living but is never disrespectful to the dead
Shame on you  if you even have the minimal amount of humanity to feel shame.   Trump is a million times the man you are you small, little man.
All Americans should still be terrified that Terrible Trump and his communist allies will do everything possible to cheat and steal the election. He has already set the stage by blaming the Democrats for trying to cheat.
Only Trump would say it’s safe to send our nation’s children to school in a couple weeks, but having the election in November would be unsafe

Ver, this surprises me from you, no? I’m quite sure you have patients, friends, residents, and staff who have and will vote for Pres Trump, and I’m sure you really don’t feel this way about them, right?  You’re awesome and tolerant to everyone, one president can’t change that
Too bad a Trump rally killed him then, wonder how many others died from that Tulsa Rally
How flipping ironic, telling him he believes “anything” when there is proof that trump/PressSec have done those things, when there is proof!! You’re the one who believes every word out of Emperor Tang’s mouth!
Of course he did Dirty Trick Trump. Everyone watched Obama and saw what a real A real President sounds like and were saddened to face the reality of an idiot in office  I want him to see this. We Miss Obama, we are sadder who we have now VOTE Nov 3 vote OUT Trump!
But running test on voter fraud, means there's nothing there and you're trying to find some. If you had proof of massive voter fraud, you'd show it. But ohbwait, didn't trump have a voter fraud commission? Yulp! Disbanded when found NO mass voter fraud!!!!
TRUMP said 2016 was rigged against him and that he'd lose bc it was rigged. Thereby she took it on herself to help stop the incorrectly alleged rigging, by casting additional ballot. Just like when trump said he'd pay legal fees for supporters who ruffed protestors  Rally's.
It’s obvious Donald Trump shouldn’t be at the #JohnLewisMemorial today. What’s not obvious is the shame our nation should feel that we have allowed a man so base, so immoral, so embarrassing that it’s right that he not be there to remain our President for over 3 years.

Football is hurt by covid.   So if Trump wants football, he should want to get rid of Covid.   To get rid of Covid you lockdown, Quarantine, mask up, strict social distance.  Trump should embrace the above guidelines and enact them nationally to increase his odds of reelection.
Y’all just sound desperate to protect Trump at this point. Pathetic.
Unfortunately for Trump, there is a moratorium of January 20th for when the Presidential term runs out. He nor Congress can change that. Congress could change the election date. With a Republican majority, it is a possibility.
Which was the result of the lack of response to the pandemic. The hoax, the thing that would just disappear, the thing the rest of the world has seemed to manage through much more successfully than what Trump did.
Any other pledges to vote on Election Day even if long lines, no matter how long it takes? Trump put a flunky as PO general  who vows to slow the mail down
Too fucking bad.. for him. He doesn’t have that power. We are going to give him Good Trouble, I pledge to vote regardless where I have to go, walk over glass, drive 20 miles , wait for hours to vote, whatever I have to vote. I now don’t trust the mail now a Trump PO gen flunky.

China is dirty, and untrustworthy. I hope that after Trump is re-elected, China admits the Democrat party was behind the plandemic.

Was it Trump that marched elderly to their deaths by sending covid patients to nursing homes?
Promoting that “fake news” gimmick was the smartest thing Trump ever did. It’s bullet-proof, works in every situation. Just like “it’s God’s plan” does for the evangelicals
He hasn't grown at all. It's just liberals are giving him a free pass because he's not on the Trump Train, anymore.
....and Economy on gas fumes, Hernan Cain is dead from Trump’s COVID Tulsa rally!
I would never say he "deserved it." The audacity of trump having that rally is another matter! However, may his death show the deniers that this is serious. May he rest in peace.
Delay elections? Hell no! Trump brought us to this point. This is his baby. Time for him to own up, man up and face the elections!
Herman was a trumper before there was a trump.
Donald Trump should resign
Yea, plus Trump campaign merch and many other things. The hypocrisy goes a million different ways. Singling out Lebron/the NBA when the almost entirety of the US sports world from HS’s to colleges to pros does the same, seems agenda driven from some folks, which isn’t shocking

#Trump needs the appearance of a strong economy to have a chance at re-election.  The #GDP (read: the economy) just fell 33% in Q2.   This is more bad news for Trump.  Is it possible -- hear me out -- that floating the idea of delaying the election IS A COMPLETE DISTRACTION?
What’s the over/under on a peaceful, drama-free transfer of power if Trump loses?
Trump raises idea of delaying election-I suppose I would too if I knew I wasn't going to win.
It’s happening - as anticipated years ago.  via
Trump’s tweet about the election = distraction from John Lewis’ funeral. Despicable low-life, desperate perspective from trump, and yet totally in character for him.
I agree.  Get a absentee ballot.  Together we can defeat Joe Biden!  He has to be crushed, humiliated, and driven from office, public life, and society and place in a nursing home's memory unit.  Glad to have you back on the Trump Train.
Why post lies? When he yells fake news and calls us radical.  Well posting lies is radical. Smh trump must go!! But he must go for what he has done.  Not stupid lies!
Trump supporters are the middle class Speaker Facelift!
Trump declares Fox News unwatchable
Trump's view is not only baseless, it is moot.
Yes, its shocking that the type of research that led to the manipulation of this virus was allowed! It was funded in part by the U.S. under Fauci and Obama originally and renewed by Trump.
I guess you think Trump has done a good job so far?
And it’s not,  He went to Trump’s rally and he died. That’s what happened. Sorry you don’t like it but that’s what happened.
SHHHH!  We are going to tell all the Trump supporters that the election is delayed.
Yes, delay the election until we can vote in person and be safe! When Trump does this Fauci will claim they have a cure the next day! No masks no lockdowns. Freedom returns to America. #Trump2020 🇺🇲

I have no problem with trump not being there.  He is not worthy.
I must've missed your concerned tweets when Trump couldn't put a glass of water to his face, had to be escorted down a 10° ramp at the Naval Academy graduation, or slurred his speech and rambled aimlessly at all of his conventions?
Ready to run through a wall to vote out Comrade Trump
Truth.  This didn’t have to happen.  Trump is reckless &amp; dangerous.
Herman Cain said Covid was a hoax, went to Trump’s Tulsa rally on Juneteenth without a mask, caught Covid there, and now he is dead.  Y’all, Covid is not political. Masks are not political. Your life is not political. Cain’s death needs to be a wakeup to the GOP.
I think in a show of bipartisan, Democrats should let Trump become king.
Take a knee. Give tRump the finger. Walk out the door. Not someone I want to be working for.
How so? U had Flynn telling Russia not to worry about sanctoins O imposed because they'd be relieved once tRump was in office.
I am absolutely appalled by the abortion industry. That wasn't Erick's original point.
Duuuude... he had people calling hiss wife a dude!  Did he go off on Twitter? No. Did he whine about it like tRump wines about Fauci's approval rating being higher than his?  No
If u think Trump cares about anything but himself, u r mistaken.
#JohnLewisMemorial so sad and pathetic that trump is too disrespectful and childish to honor this great man . Shame on him
I think it’s a bit of both. I don’t think Trump’s timing of outrageous bloody baiting comments is some genius he just has a sort of instinct for baiting the media.
Was wondering why dr birx showed up here over the weekend. We aren’t exactly a battleground state but that Trump sent her the “secure the bag” here makes a lot more sense than her having suddenly grown a conscience and reaching out on her own.
Anyone think that Trump brought up delaying the election to switch the focus off of how his rally killed Herman Cain?
Wow did you see this, Herman Cain possibly died from attending the Tulsa Trump rally...  What a bunch of idiots!
WTF does "running test on it" even mean?! You're doing the same BS vague scare tactics trump does, without a shred of evidence of large scale mass mail-in voter fraud (or voter fraud in general)
You believe that just because Emperor Tang says it? Where is the proof that it's not safe? Don't give me the special election BS that Trump pushes. 1) many reasons to toss ballots, 2) it shows fraud gets caught. 3) wasn't it GOP that were being fraudulent in 2016 for trump?
Any comments from Trump?
He lived a life of hate. Just read his writings. He followed Trump's lead of hate and stupidity. Just because you die doesn't make you beautiful. You reap what you sow.
I 'd guess going to Tulsa without that mask was a huge mistake.  Everything Trump touches dies.
Or even sooner, when the next Trump comes along, you'll join all the other liberals in rehabbing his image, like you've done with Bush the Simian.
'These 2 bills aren’t mateable': Republicans, Democrats at odds on a coronavirus stimulus deal as pressure builds
I won’t disagree with any of that but at the end it’s each person’s personal choices that count. Trump has blood on his hands as a whole for botching the entire pandemic but on a granular level we must own our choices.
Cain has threatened the lives of millions of people with families that love them. And yet here you are, slobbering over a monster. Mark my words, when he dies, you'll be gushing about how Trump, despite his flaws, was a human with a family that loved him.
I stopped drinking 2 years ago as well, for no other reason then I just lost interest in it.   I did however cry and day drink on Trump’s Inauguration Day.   On Biden’s Inauguration Day I might bake cookies and happy cry.

This isn't anti-Trump or pro-Biden. I hope all Americans, regardless of party, see that delaying the election isn't a partisan issue - but about the fundamentals of our nation. This is a red line that Americans - no matter the motives - must say "No further."
With 1 tweet, President Trump has changed the news cycle. He lives rent free in the heads of millions.
NPR just reported Herman Cain died from Covid 19 that he contracted when attending thr Trump Tally in Tulsa, OK.
We know why Trump won. The difference between Never Trumpers and the rest of the party is that Never Trumpers think the electeds should lead the party to its best version rather than cowering before angry voters when they are determined to go down a dead end road.
Not anymore that Cuomo killed people in retired homes. People are adults and should own their actions. I hate Trump but he didn’t kill Cain. Cain killed Cain.
If Trump would have worn a mask. Cain would have worn a mask. This is on Trump which is why he’s distracting with the “postpone election” crap.
Have you begun plans to delay the fall election, consistent with President Trump's tweet today, and what sort of dates are you considering for Kentucky voters?
Okay, so these need to be on cars and stuff and not sitting in a box on my desk, so I cut the price some and it's still free shipping if you can use a dozen or more. Make some noise before this nitwit tries in earnest to cancel the election.
I’m sure it’s not gone unnoticed that  declined to attend  funeral today. It can be taken it’s because Lewis was a Democrat but more importantly because he was African American. John Lewis stood for kindness, humility and fairness.  TRUMP DOES NOT...
Death of Herman Cain lies with Trump &amp; the maskless rally in Tulsa..he will be voted out in November..i for one cannot wait
The former GOP presidential candidate was diagnosed with coronavirus in early July after attending a Trump presidential rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in late June.
That is why he should not have been dancing around at the Trump really with no mask in close proximity to others. 🤦🏾‍♀️
He was a human being with a family and people who loved him who was perfectly fine with destroying the lives of other human beings with families that loved them.  This is why in 10 years, people like you will be slobbering over Trump when the next worst president comes along.
And Trump killed him .
keep trying investigate trump
I'm sick of this Republicans are the mans man and own all the guns. I'm a Democrat from Kentucky. There are plenty of us and we've beeen hunting since birth. Trump supporters at this point in my opinion are just a bunch of toy soldiers to dumb to realize they are fascist
Black Trump-Supporting Lawmaker Turns the Table After MSNBC Host Asks if He's Paid to Support Trump
Herman Cain is not the "victim" of a disease.  He gambled with his own life and the lives of others, and he lost.   I hope he had fun at the Trump rally in Tulsa. The price of admittance, as it turns out, was pretty steep.
Trump really tweeted he might delay the election to distract us from the fact that our GPD has shrunk 30% in the second quarter of 2020. The worst economic numbers in history.
He has no power to do that. My guess is that he will try to do it as a symbolic gesture, but nothing will come of it.  Having said that, tRump will do EVERYTHING legal and illegal to disrupt the November election. We cannot take our eyes off of him or any of his supporters.
President Donald Trump is for the first time floating a “delay” to the Nov. 3 presidential election, as he makes unsubstantiated allegations that increased mail-in voting will result in fraud &gt;&gt;

There is no amount. Trump can kill thousands of peaceful citizens with federal agents and the gop will applaud. Trump could start beheadings and the gop will cheer. Trump has already disobeyed the sumpreme court..crickets.. so come on..what’s left?

Last month, Louis Gohmert literally started banging on the table and making loud grunting noises to try and drown out testimony of a Trump critic. And if you haven’t seen the GOP do the exact same things, you’ve been asleep for 10 years.
Low life Trump won’t attend the funeral. Yet even Bush which I’m sure also butted heads with Lewis will attend. That’s what classy, mature people do regardless of political affiliation. Trumps a racist no doubt.

Herman Cain Dead at 74 from COVID-19, Got Sick After Trump Tulsa Rally - TMZ
“Those are the incoherent, conspiracy theory ramblings of a lost candidate who is out of touch with reality.”  — #Trump campaign spokesman #TimMurtaugh, on ABC News on April 23, after #JoeBiden warned that President Trump would try to delay the election.
to  &amp; other vultures in politics, Cain wasn't a real person, just a token toy soldier to add to their MAGA army. His life &amp; death means nothing to them, yet they'll politicize it &amp; further dehumanize him. Trump thinks he's a king &amp; were all peasants #DictatorTrump
So Trump is criticized for not doing enough, but is demonized for suggesting something that has worked? Smh
The speaker... #Trump
Key takeaway here folks: “Don’t waste your time on  this Trump ploy”
Hi Judicial Watch let's talk about trump trying to delay the election.    Now that's something you could really work on!
Trump doesn't actually think he can move the election date. He wants us talking about this while his supporters guffaw  about the naive liberals, so he can distract us from the worst GDP drop in history and the death of Herman Cain from Covid caught at Trump's Tulsa rally.
As far as I'm concerned, Trump Death Day will be a holiday.
Actually this one is better
The disgusting things that Zuckerberg allows Trump and his minions to post on Facebook is why I no longer use Facebook.
Welp, Trump killed Herman Cain
Trump murdered Cain.  Cain did his best to encourage people not to socially distance or wear a mask. I wish I believed in Hell.
FYI.  Here is  (without a mask) at President #Trump’s campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.  Around two weeks later Cain tested positive for the #coronavirus and two days after that he was hospitalized in Atlanta after developing “serious” symptoms. #COVID19
Never ever be on the side saying “Trump would never do that”.
Herman Cain dies from #TrumpVirus after waiving his rights to sue #TrumpCampaign followed trump to the bitter end!  who's next?
Only thing worse than seeing Trump suggesting delaying the election is seeing "President Pelosi" trending. y'all really don't learn do you?
The Timeline: June 20 - Herman Cain goes to the Trump "Superspreader" Rally in Tulsa July 1 - Herman Cain first seeks medical attention for Covid July 28 - Herman Cain on oxygen but Getting Better July 30 - Herman Cain dies
Facts matter here. 1.) the GOP is actually the party that started seeking out voters to vote by mail to make it easier. 2.) there is no evidence that voting by mail leads to voter fraud. This is Trump either diverting from the economic news or creating an out when he loses.
If Trump had emerged as an "I will do anything to work with anyone and everyone to make sure Americans are protected" president it would have worked for him, he chose the wrong path. Denial &amp; divisions doomed him among many other things because Covid19 is 💯 on the ballot
🤯 He was at Trump’s Tulsa rally
Do not be distracted by the Twitter storm from tRump this morning. Pay attention to the economy! He is trying to distract from his abysmal failure re. economy and unemployment.  #ImpeachTrumpAgain  #COVIDResponseFailure
It’ll never happen.  There are too many Trump worshiping idiots.
Known/reported that is. Bet his family wish he hadn't waved rights to sue #TrumpCampMurdersOwn he's black so  figures that's just the cost of doing business. Not shedding a tear, he committed suicide for Trump!
Mask denial + a Trump rally literally killed a prominent republican. Had to keep owning the libs at any cost
It’ll never happen. Too many Trump worshiping idiots.
Hermain Cain got coronavirus at the Oklahoma Trump rally.
For Republicans it’s Trump and absolute power VS political exile and no power.  They all made their choice during the Impeachment as to what kind of country the GOP really believed in.
What an absolute shame. And Trump will give zero actual fucks
Trump Rally without a mask consequences SMDH
Herman Cain has died from Coronavirus tested positive after attending the trump rally in Oklahoma where chairs were zip tied together. Will republicans ever take coronavirus seriously
I didn't vote for Trump in 2016, but I've been forced to defend him from left wing lies since day 1. Up until Corona, our country was doing the best in my entire lifetime. Stop with the histrionics! Talk to people outside of your bubble and actually LISTEN for once.
Since facts aren’t your thing, &amp; yes, I’m in Louisville KY, a Dem city &amp; state! Omg! And my mail is being affected. Trump appointed a new PMG, we also have 40K postal emp on quarantine, over 20% of the entire USPS does overtime as is.
President Trump suggests delaying the presidential election in November over concerns of voter fraud and mail-in voting.
More likely Republicans will turn on you and ask you to delete your tweets critical of Trump.
Then Trump needs to build a bigger wall around that White House.
Trump is a racist who wants America to die! He only cares about himself and people who believe as he does. If you don’t they you basically don’t deserve to have anything according to trump!
And so it begins
Wow. Trump literally killed one of his few black supporters.
Wonder how many times a day Trump screams "DO SOMETHING, GODDAMMIT!" at nobody in particular these days. Kinda gives me a warm feeling thinking about it.
Dude straight up lost his life by being a token black guy and a Trump Rally.   Yikes

Trump floats delaying election over mail-in voting, legal experts say that power rests with Congress

Well thankfully his term ends 1/20/21 at 12:00 regardless of a delay in an election (even though Trump himself is stupid enough to not realize that). So even if he hunkers down in WH claiming he's still POTUS, he won't be. So since Pelosi is up for reelection, 1/2
Trump is anti American!
An inspector general out of Trump's own justice department said no. But this Durham Report, which probably will come out before the election, could shed more light. The notion of a sitting administration surveilling an incoming one is troubling.
Trump wants to tweet the ‘N’ word so bad. White people, esp. white evangelicals, he’s in office because you put him there. You are responsible for this racist tyrant. Black people refuse to be held responsible for getting him out of office. You put him in. You get him out!

With Trump suggesting delaying the election, I wonder what my therapist's rebuttal will be. She has been leaning heavily on neoliberal faith in institutions to ward off the threat of what is pretty much inevitable. She does it so that I don't get scared, but I don't need that.
Per  No presidential election has ever been delayed in U.S. history, including during the Civil War in 1864 and World War II in 1944. #Trump
Mr President at one time you asked for my opinion of this year's race for the presidency. I then stated that only you could beat Donald j trump. Sir with this last tweet you are doing just that.
If Trump does that, this country will be torn apart.  Trump won’t become a king, but this nation may not survive his attempt to become one.
So you want Trump gone too?
Don't change date, but don't allow mass mail in voting.

Trump is priming his base for his power grab
Trump, Biden, whoever. They are feathers of the same bird. And spoiler alert, they don’t give a crap about you or me.
When Trump makes statements like this you have to wonder... what is he trying to distract the media cycle from? Putin chats, Gislaine Maxwell, Coronavirus deaths, what corruption will be exposed today?
Trump is so corrupt.
Trump wants to delay the election because of COVID, without any authority to do so. Got me thinking - this response to the pandemic is exactly the reason why we NEED to have an election. Maybe have it early! It would arguably save lives - what’s everybody doing tomorrow?!
Trump does get paid by Putin and others for his criminal enterprise. This presidency is a money making business opportunity for trump. How can he let this cash cow go? Also there’s a lot of incentive not to disclose his financials.
The point is HCQ is not a dangerous drug like the media and loony left have framed it to fit their anti-Trump narrative. Why not try it as a preventative for CV19?
And BOOM! Just like that, Trump OWNS the news cycle once again
Trump is a total con artist. If people don't realize that by now they are beyond hope.

Here we go. 😔  Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so
Every single Republican politician should condemn Trump throwing out the possibility of delaying the election   He doesn’t have the power to do that (only Congress does) and if no election takes place, by law he leaves office in January (making Pelosi President)
Here it is, he is making his move for permanent power.  We cannot allow this to stand,  no matter what.  If we do,  we lose our democracy.  Full stop.
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 Absolutely. Trump needs to just stay president
President Trump floats election 'delay' amid claims of voting fraud
He can not delay the election. But I am betting the moment Biden his declared the winner, tRump declares Martial Law. That is if he has not done so before that.
I agree. I wish ted Cruz would've just won the primary bc he'd be president rn. I mean Hillary would've lost to a rock.  Probably by a larger margin too bc the rock wouldn't say the dumb stuff Trump says
Oh no it would be a shame if trump said the election date was later than it actually is oh no it would be terrible if a bunch of trump supporters believed him and missed the election oh no I hope that doesn't happen what a shame 🙄
Trump really talking about banning all social media platforms 😭
How many Dems promised to leave the USA when Trump was elected? How many of them actually left? You see they are all inflammatory rhetoric but no substantive action. They would take the money and refuse to leave. That’s who they are.
If Trump wasnt so dumb he'd have a clear path to victory... How do you fuck this up? Lol

He knows what he's doing when it comes to such things. Someone will be able to teach a hack of a college course just on Trump's tweets, their timing, aims, and outcomes. Fascinating.
I feel like I'm alone in this but I think Trump just leaves office as soon as the election is called if he loses. I don't see him hanging out until January.
Trump suggests a ‘delay’ in the November election. Well  Republicans, it is now that time, will it be party or Country?
Epic moment where Trump tweets about maybe delaying the election and Resistance libs are in his mentions telling him that he 'has no class' and is 'tacky'
How is it that we've got a vaccine coming soon and yet need to cancel the election? Trump has to pick one or the other. Also, he should know sowing seeds of political uncertainty is negative for stock prices and stock prices are all he has right now.

When you vote for someone with a limited scope of ambition, you get trump. He has one ambition - be rich (at any cost).

What is concerning is that he is a president. And if there is something seriously wrong with him that puts the country in serious trouble. If this is the case then trump should resign.
He’s a lying piece of shit bc nobody saw this jerk off ever wearing a face mask but saw a lot of trump ass kissing instead ✅
I don't know if IRS agents fit exactly into that category because what they do is considered legal. But again, the point is, Jesus didn't consider Matthew, Zacchaeus and others like him irredeemable. He knew they were open to what he was teaching.

for example, I took Remeron. An anti-depressant. It promptly killed all my white blood cells. I had a temp of 104. It took them 3 days to figure that out.  But it's still used and had helped many people today.  People need to get over the fact that Trump mentioned it.
You should be held responsible for ANY person who has been in contact with you and, ends up with Covid.  You are a disgrace. Who in the hell do you think wants to listen to your whining with Hannity? Having to listen to traitor tRump is enough for one day.
Everything that trump touches turns to shit &amp; everything trump does is done halfass which explains why our country is so FD up right now 🤬
Actually, I'm about the same.  But that's on me.  Not Donald Trump.  and to tell the truth, I'm the same for the past 10 years.  But again, it's not because of who is POTUS.  That said, I'm not about to hand over power to a man with dementia.  The fact you are tells about you.
Forget the virus which came from China, trump banded travel from China on Jan, 31, Biden critized trump for doing so, calling him a racist but I’m sure you care nothing for the facts, just total hatered of trump.
Same. He flipped on trump pretty quick, but I’m gonna wait and see if he actually supports Biden as president.  Never gonna forgive him for not paying child support, though.
Trump is doing a great job destroying America all by himself.
Trump and his team are trying to get AP to delete this picture.  Please DO NOT retweet or like this picture so it doesn’t spread.

I have about 15 min left to listen to on tomorrow's run, but already a relevant listen in light of Trump's Suburban Lifestyle Dream tweet today. 🏘️  *One of these market urbanism topics was actually my 2010 senior capstone project... 🛣️🏷️
Yeah we are taking good care of our air. Throwing tear gas around like its seriously going out of style. Come on the ground trump. Look for yourself
Marxism places the government in the hands of a few, where as the United States government is suppose to be in the hands of the individual.
NATO = A Country Club Trump cannot own
Trump has destroyed America from what it was 3 1/2 years ago, to what it is now.
100% in my home. POTUS Trump 100%
We have no problem with Republican conservatives. After all Project Lincoln guys are Republicans. And a lot of conservative Republicans are leaving trump. We have a problem with Trump.
Marco, and I'm talking directly to you Marco, what you are doing with Trump is not worth it.
He arrives within minutes of Donnie’s tweets. It does not matter what time of day/night. Does not matter what day. He tries to rally everyone behind trump. Another account is Craig, which is under RD’s. It is shameless self promotion. He is pathetic enough to toot his own horn.
Yeah, Trump made the USPS suck. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
It’s such juxtaposition today of Obama talking about community and how when him and Michelle were growing up there was such a sense of community in neighborhoods and looking after each other and how we should get back to that &amp; then Trump tweeting divisive dog whistles
Not at all, you remember "draining the swamp"? He meant "draining the treasury into Trump/Kushner bank accounts", also he's been doing some funny accounting with campaign funds that somehow wind up in his accounts too. AND, how much you want to bet the family has Kodak stock?
I’m linking the Houston Astros cheating scandal to Donald Trump somehow. Not sure how yet, maybe numerology.   I learned from some friends today that information is subjective and you can kind of just do what you want with it.   Donald = 6 Astros = 6 Altuve = 6
Nah. "Why cancel culture led me to vote Trump."
Trump, "Puty Patootie, if we get you back into the G8 and ignore those dead soldiers in Afghanistan, would I get my Trump Tower in Moscow? Huh ol' chum?"
Remind me, how many people are unemployed right now? Under tRump?
I will never forgive the   for allowing our country to be torn apart like trump has done
I’m prolly not . Tbh . Because there isn’t a clear motivation as long as it’s not trump.
Trump, "Sooooo, Putin, ol' pal, would you forgive my loan if I remove troops from Germany? I have to do it incrementally, of course, so the libruls don't catch on. Conservatives are too busy licking my boots and turning a blind eye, so we don't worry about that."
Suburban Lifestyle Dream is his post-presidency reality show on the Trump News Netwoek (TNN).
If you're not voting for  in November, then you're voting for trump. It's that simple.  If you want to reclaim democracy and decency for the country, then #JoeBidenForPresident2020 is the only option.  #NovemberIsComing
Then you're voting for trump.
Today I told an old high school teacher on Facebook that hydroxychloroquine is not a cure for COVID and she told me that I would rather see people die because I don’t like Trump and then unfriended me. So feeling pretty good about myself and pretty bad about the state of CAL!
What is there to love? What is there to love in child rapist like trump....among other things?!
Oh yes..virtue signaling. What a convenient way to maintain that "everyone all over the country feels" the same way as you, because those who claim otherwise are just putting on an act. Nope, I'm a homeowner, and I'm genuinely appalled by Trump's position (and your's).
Okay yeah that’s awful. The funny thing is almost that whole list on Hillary is just projection - all things Trump did at the time or would end up doing later.
And our commander in chief does nothing about it just like the #TrumpVirus killing America so what do we have to lose by having trump as president? Our life’s 🤬
Trump is the Mind Flayer and we are in the upside down.
Why do you think Trump votes by mail?
Shame on you for promoting a treatment that seems to be effective and inexpensive! How can anyone make money on it? Exposes the hypocrisy of the left that fights drug companies because they make too much money. And they can't dare credit Trump.
Whenever I see these junior grifters I think about that time at the end of one of the debates when Hillary &amp; Trump were asked to name one thing each liked about the other. Hillary took the high road &amp; said “his children”. I cannot imagine how difficult that must have been. Blech.
Is Trump really turning on Fox News? He is trying to lose. I predicted he’d resign but I’d say this is the equivalent.
Doing well, thanks president Trump!
You swooped in on the "newly disenfranchised" and pounced as they saw people rightfully elevate, who they didn't think deserved it... And in their minds, life as they know it ends when entitlement is jeopardized.....  Advantage - Trump, huh??
Agreed!  The “American Dream” should be real for everyone who puts in an honest day’s work! The essential workers during the COVID crisis are the workers who are excluded from Trump’s vision - we need to rebuild the middle class and give everyone a chance to live the dream!
So you're a Trump supporter?

He's bought into the entire Trump fraud scheme, not just Covid.  What is wrong with these people.
Looks like Trump is the one doing it here. He is trying to suppress voter turn out by scaring mail in voters. He is using scare tactics in this video to prevent people from voting. Imagine how scared he is of mail in voting. It is possible Putin cannot manipulate these votes.
‘Nobody Likes Me,’ tRump Complains, Renewing Defense of Dubious Science
Trump Eats Farts
I question Trump's understanding of what a Covid-19 relief bill is all about. Apparently, he doesn't see the people who are infected or care. He sees it as an opportunity to spend money on projects he wants.
Three presidents have faced the three biggest trials thrust against this nation, Washington, Lincoln and Trump.
You have to raise private money to build a working-class housing complex, but if you known Trump for years and want to start a generic drug company...here’s $765M!
#NobodyLikesTrump it’s me, I don’t like trump.
#DUMPTRUMP  so weird can #BRINKBACKOURFLAG   Please retweet to make trump mad!
That makes no sense.   Trump doesn’t want mail in voting but wants to control mail on voting?     That’s a no win argument
Trump found $765M for longtime associates to start a generic drug company, while congress is arguing over a few hundred bucks a month for the unemployed.
Biden and trump both suck vote 3rd party thanks for coming to my ted talk
You want to give 200 and the dems want to give 600! Trump wants a new FBI building because it will benefit his hotel. That’s what Congress doesn’t want to pay for. They want the money to go to the people that need it. You’re as CORRUPT as they come Moscow Mitch!
Trump is funneling money to longtime associates with government loans. A $765M loan underwritten by the federal government to start a generic drug company, but instead of starting a publicly owned entity, the money was handed over to capitalists with no experience making drugs.
President refuses to visit  or attend John Lewis #JohnLewis memorial or funeral because of  the signal he might be sending to his racist, white Supremacist buddies and white voters. His whole Presidency circles around the election!
Sleazy Biden is just a battering ram for the commie Dems. He will do whatever they want!  Everything dems accuse Trump of they've done themselves (bullying, lies, chaos). If you can't see that you're blind!  Am I doing this right?!

Republicans need to step up. Unfortunately I think many believe even if Trump wins the Marxists will burn America to the ground. If he doesn’t win the same. It’d be nice to have an alternative.

How can Eric Trump/anyone in Trump family possibly think Trump is firing with all cylinders?  He doesn’t appear,when speaking he is all there.  Little questions or comments set him off, dementia setting in? His left foot drags when he walks.  Hold water with 2 hands.
Trump’s racist tweet about a “Suburban Lifestyle Dream” is exactly why we must lead on a new Southern Strategy. The politics of hate, lies, and fear have crippled generations.  Our enemy is not one another, but a system that profits from poverty and inequity.  The real swamp.
Hey   while you are trying to sabotage mail in voting.  trump is urging his base to vote by mail in his campaign emails
They initially said that, to preserve the masks for health care workers. When they came out with the new guidelines, we needed to hit that hard. Instead, the mixed message and Trump not taking masks seriously, confused some people and made it political for others.
President Trump is giving Kodak almost a billion dollars to develop drugs, and I fear all we’ll get are pictures of pills.
So taking that housing away and halting building more will in fact just raise crime rates. But it won't be in your rich, lily white, suburban "dream" neighborhoods, so Trump doesn't care.
Trump claims this will lower crime. Higher rates of crime in low income areas are A. not as bad as people make out, and B. caused by societal issues we should be fixing. If anything, providing cheap housing to poor people means they are LESS pushed to commit crime to get by.
They need Pres Trump to lose. They can’t afford Covid-19 patients recover.
"low income housing" meaning "places where poor people live" which, to trump and his supporters, means "where the blacks are"  This is blatant racist dog whistling.
Is trump going further off the deep end because he is afraid of what is going to come out on the unsealed Epstein case?

How soon you forget, Matt. Or do you not associate with this?  Trump making fun of a disabled reporter.
JoeBiden: Donald Trump's instinct to constantly add fuel to the fire is the last thing our country needs right now.  We need leadership that will calm the waters and lower the temperature.
A non party magazine. What's interesting is that when libertarians list a second choice, they slightly more often go for a democrat. But, still, you won't find the LP endorsing Republicans. The closest you can get is our VP candidate in 2016 said he preferred Clinton over trump.
It's not MAGA people or even Trump saying such... it's medical doctors.   How about let people make their own decisions in consultation with their doctors? Why do want people to die unnecessarily?
Trump is a bad President. You people make it seem like people are looking for a reason to vote for this guy. People are not voting for him because he's a horrible President. He is completely unfit for the office and nothing Barr releases will change that.  It's Trump.
So Trump put America first eh. Because some countries are destroying the Earth, it's OK for us to destroy it for future generations. Trump's vision is so short sighted, that he is willing to destroy our future for the here and now.
cracked me up when speaking of Trump's Voodoo doctor, saying he kept talking about her "like a man possessed."  Well played, Anderson from CNN.
We know Trump is racist. It’s like saying the sun is hot. We know it. He’s gonna say something racist every day because that’s who he is. We need not act shocked when he’s racist. He’s a racist. That’s what racists do- racist shit.
F* Trump! He’s not a president. Never has been. He’s a figurehead for Putin. He has destroyed America for Putin. We will wait until November 3rd to officially kick trump to the curb.
trump said along the lines of “idk what country she comes from and what they do down there” talking ab dr stella sksksks. That’s what she gets lookin dumb😭😭
It's about punishing Donald Trump supporters and trying to make him look bad.
So I get that you don’t like trump?! Me neither.
He has bragged about all the money Russia spends on Trump properties. He's said it's tens of millions for apartments. His sons have bragged about Russian money too.  Also, he's gotten Russian money/loans through Deutsche Bank, the SDNY is investigating that.
Can someone FINALLY arrest these criminals in the Cadet Bonespurs regime, including Cadet Bonespurs himself!!  Lawless Trump administration makes its Supreme Court defiance official
Just want to remind everyone that Trump just appointed someone loyal to him as postmaster general. If anyone is going to cheat, it would be Trump and his corrupt administration.
Trump is the best ever... your point is invalid.
You really have to start questioning these things with  We are quickly approaching a point of no return with Trump and his cronies. They will not go away unless we make them go away.
Republicans will use any way possible to compromise the election! See how easy that was, and I didn't even need any proof. Just like you Matthew. BTW how is Russia doing compromising our elections like they did last time for Trump?
Trump didn’t mention anything about people of color in his tweet . There a lot diversity in the suburban neighborhoods.
Trump hair
He should be arrested and have a felony charge thrown at him....by real feds. Not by trump’s Boogaloo Militia.
Jfc, trump is a moron. If he is fooling this intelligent reporter by talking over him...he’s not. The entire world knows Russia used to be the Soviet Union. And trump u comprehend less than a nit on a fly on a dog. No insult to the nit.

I had zero intentions of voting for Biden but Trump is pushing me towards it with how bad he has gotten lately

He is as crazy as Trump!
One of the most jarring things about Trump as President is that he just SAYS OUTRIGHT all the terribly racist and classist sentiments that underlie decades of racist, classist laws in this country
Last time I checked Trump was President 🤔 And this is happening on his watch!
eat shit moron. Trump wins again and you keep eating double stacks ass wipe!!
Trump has not!!!!
okay instead of an election- and hear me out- trump and biden dual on the white house front lawn
At this point if you vote for Trump again you’re just like him.

Country over party. Trump has held every big banner, be it Democrat, Republican or Independent. Why, if he cheated in the 2016 election, would he call attention to it by saying it was "rigged"? No criminal would invite scrutiny to a crime he supposedly committed.
If trump at 10% then he needs to resign
He didn't mail it though, it was an absentee ballot taken directly from and back to the Palm Beach Elections Office personally by one of Trump's people. A designated representative.

Somebody please explain to this clown that his executive orders are not all powerful. Nearly everyone he has signed has been blocked by a judge for being unconstitutional. This isnt the dictatorship of Trump.
So your saying that a political commercial being censored is ok? In an election year? Only bc its for trump? Its ok? That would be the definition of silencing someone on the 1st amendment. Right?
How my ballot is going to look on November 3rd. -President-  •Donald J. Trump(R)                  ✅   -VP-Mike R. Pence   •Joesph R. Biden(D).                    -VP-Kamala D. Harris  •Kanye O. West(B)   -VP-Michelle Tidball
I want a pres who will fight for what he believes in. For too long repubs rolled over when someone said something bad about them. Look what it has gotten us. This country is unrecognizable from 30 years ago. Trump is the fighter I have been looking for not a dem abettor like you
You are either naive or corrupt. The last pres who was a paragon of virtue was Carter and he was a failure as pres.  Trump talks to much but he wants a strong America, middle class and military.   Evil? Unlimited abortion, open borders, riots, crime.. and you sir are aiding it.
#WednesdayWisdom just another #Trump day! #BigTechHearing
Aaaand there is this article:
Trump tells voters who live in suburbs they ‘will no longer be bothered’ by low-income housing
Has anyone in the media apologized for praising Trump's "new tone" yet?
As police in Milwaukee search for the person responsible for fatally shooting a Black Trump supporter outside of his business, officials say the community needs to know if the crime was politically motivated.
So those of us who vote for McConnell and Trump do not have a soul, a moral compass or a backbone and you do.  You have vastly overestimated yourself. You are not the middle. You are the fringe.
I understand why people feel led to this decision, but the same God they worshiped before Trump is the same God today with Trump as president. I hope that even though they’ve left the church, they’ve not deserted their faith.
Rex. There will be a lot of butt hurt people when Trump is walked out come Jan. Lmao
A Prudent De-Escalation  The Trump administration has struck a deal with Oregon to withdraw federal officers from downtown Portland, the Homeland Security Department says

No not really. Trump would never buy stock in a pharmaceutical company and then peddle a miracle drug to push the stock up and make money. Hes not a corrupt businessman, He’s the messiah.

Wow! What projection on my part? The russia collusion was not done by trump. It was by Biden for his son. They have it on tape. I mean seriously, you can't be so embroiled in this to not see that. But anyway, research. Always research. And good luck sweetie..
Really, how narcisssitic is Trump? I believe that he really doesn’t understand why his approval rating is lower than Dr. Fauci’s.
That being said, neither Trump nor Barr have the legal authority to designate them a terrorist organization.
#Barr is doing to the #Democrats what #Trump does daily. #BarrHearing
Could it be more obvious that trump has bought up stock in this medicine and is trying to make a buck?
Trump again pushes unproven drug as COVID-19 treatment
It is clear that the far left Dems are desperate- they constantly lie and censor.  Then, together with MSM, try to shout these accusations at the GOP.  Only Trump could battle this cacophony.
I am voting for Trump.
He’ll be a phenomenal job leading North Dakota!

Trump Your people are the ones attacking citizens before anyone does anything but talk!
Donald Trump, the so-called president of the United States, retweeted this nonsense. His cult actually believes what he says, even though he's obviously a blithering idiot. INVOKE THE 25TH!
If Trump was trending through nice things being said about him, he'd be ecstatic (since Twitter is his favourite thing ever!) But he's spitting his dummy out. A narcissist, there are so many of them in the public eye whether they be A-list or Z-list! They can't handle the truth.
They want to see all of those cities.
It could be since Twitter curates posts on a whim, so perhaps Trump is signaling that Twitter will soon get their 230 immunities revoked and be liable for anything posted here as a publisher.

People are acting so angry and ridiculous about having to wear a mask that you’d think we just asked all these white people to scrape their Trump stickers off their truck bumpers.

Y'all really love Trump that much, eh??

Trump is so  prejudice, it’s very evident in his tone and actions! He always answers questions under noisy propeller cause he thinks the people won’t hear what he answers that way he can define his lies
As long as it's not a mandatory vaccine, it's fine but Trump needs to slap Stephen Hahn and Anand Shah clean out of their chairs at the FDA. The study cited on HCQ efficacy was using mild/moderate cases and completely lacking the accompanying drugs that treat flu-like viruses.
Trump is twisting protester's arms to fire explosives and attack police? That's hardly the case. These people have voted democrat for 50 years and those politicians set the policy they're protesting against. They have no business seeking out cops to hate on.
It all comes down to turn-out. Period. When you look at the number of votes cast in primaries for an unopposed Trump....it should worry the Biden campaign.
This cannot stand, vote trump and his enablers out in November, before that stand up to these bullies

We are losing our humanity because of Trump
I figured with the same title.
Well you see it &amp; I see it but many hate Trump for being Trump and are missing the actual good he has done for this country. And to keep him means conservative Supreme Court justices. If we want to continue to live for God easily, vote Trump.
Oh, I think they will mandate it. Well IF Biden is president; if Trump is president then we keep our freedoms. I’m sticking with Malaria meds if I get it. They try to scare you with dude effects too boost vaccines, but anyone must take it if go somewhere like Haiti etc. It works.
A new poll finds that Biden's supporters are less enthusiastic than Trump's — both about the campaign itself and about their candidate.
Do you not see the Trump sign?  Do you not support free speech?  Do you not support locals rights to choose who to vote for? They are much more likely to know the candidates personally than someone in the DC bubble.
Just b/c mail in voting is good for rich folks like trump does not mean it's good for other folks
