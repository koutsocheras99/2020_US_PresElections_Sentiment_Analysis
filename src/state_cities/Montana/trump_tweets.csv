The turn of phrase 'orchestration of conspiracies' is common enough to be a cliche.  There's nothing sesquipedalian about it.  As for evidence that Trump has a prophylactic treatment of some sort, First Family facing White House staff believes that they've received it.

Other presidents didn't count workers returning from furlough as new jobs.  Why does Trump? Because without furloughed workers job creation is sorely in the negative.  Only a crook keeps a second pair of books for the jobs report.

Harry Reid warns of Trump’s mental state on CNN: ‘There’s something wrong with that man — he’s getting worse’
Those that said SARS-CoV-2 wasn't the product of husbandry gave the Trump Administration every excuse they needed to take no responsibility for the destruction it caused.
Trump fled to a bunker when he heard peaceable assemblers—many of whom were clergy—singing Kumbaya outside the Whitehouse.  Then he had them pepper-gassed and harassed by low-flying helicopters.  People started calling him #BunkerBoy or #BunkerBitch shortly thereafter.
"There is “good” news, in the Trump administration: The mail delays are so bad that two rock-solid Montana Republicans (Sen. Steve Daines &amp; Rep. Greg Gianforte) are complaining publicly, which means it’s a problem that might be addressed, rather than exacerbated, to own the Libs"
I wonder if the new republican plan is to let trump extend unemployment benefits and eviction moratorium via executive order, so they can blame #democrats for not coming to an agreement. Thereby distorting the truth and saying #drumpf saved us from a problem republicans created.
I stand by my analysis.  Trump is severely unwell.  He can't stand straight or still and must therefore either sit to pee or soak the facilities.
My Republican parents were never like Trump.  My dad did quite a bit of work in Colombia and I’d meet his Colombian co-workers when they came to Indiana.  I was in an advanced program in elementary in the black neighborhood of my hometown and that was never an issue.
That's what she was trying to say. She makes herself look so stupid. The Trump ppl don't know any other way but lies.
Could have used this guy while Republicans were systemically undermining voting rights all over the country before Trump but better late than never, I guess.
Trump is extremely vulnerable right now and she smells blood.  Kinda speaks to the notion that Pelosi isn’t feckless or whatever but that she simply waits until she sees opportunity to strike.
Well, I guess the upside at all this Twitter anger at McGrath is people felt the same way about Sinema and she’s now the Senator from Arizona who is 50-50 on votes while McSally votes with Trump 95% of the time.
Trump is responsible for every death from Covid. Every single one...
Ask yourself why she is trying to dodge that debate.  If she agreed with Trump, wouldn’t she just say it?
Furthermore, the Trump Administration's official policy statements are consistent with propaganda models developed by intelligence agencies to convince targets to deliberately expose themselves by underestimating threat and making exposure a matter of faith.
Where's Trump's HCQ RCT? Why did emergency guidelines issued by the FDA prohibit treatment outside of a hospital; it is not effective unless given early? Why are Republican legislatures like Ohio criminalizing HCQ?  Trump's HCQ policy doesn't jibe with the sounds his mouth makes.
Companies aren't adding jobs, employees are returning to work after hiatus.  That's not job creation.  You don't 'create a job' when an employee returns from a furlough.  Trump is misreporting as usual.
We get flu shots every year because there's no such thing as a general purpose vaccine.  Trump is afraid of moms singing Kumbaya, but not Covid-19?    There's no way for Trump to have a vaccine now without knowledge of the virus before it was released.  How did that happen?
Barr doesn't need a mask. He's received whatever prophylactic treatment Preibus, Hicks, and Spencer moved to Washington to receive. Trump has a cure.  He's just not sharing with the rest of us.
The numbers are phony.  Under previous presidents they wouldn't have even been counted.  They're not new jobs.  As with all Trump's previous jobs reports, any reported benefit is a consequence of misclassification errors.
President Trump has ordered a sweeping but vague ban on dealings with the Chinese owners of social media apps TikTok and WeChat. But what is WeChat, and why is it so controversial?
He looks a hell of a lot more capable in front of a camera than Trump.  Trump can't even stand and pee without getting it all over himself and the floor.
Stop doing Trump a favor by making it look like he was simply unprepared.  This hell we are all living through is by design.  They did this on purpose.
Maybe look into constitutional law... there are certain things the federal government is supposed to leave up to the states. Trump’s done that, so to blame him is just hate without cause.

One American is dying every 80 seconds from coronavirus as Trump shrugs off death toll: ‘It is what it is’  Nation’s grim death rate appears to be accelerating despite president’s demands to reopen schools and lessen restrictions surrounding Covid-19
You say Democrats, but the states that are effectively criminalizing HCQ are all Republican controlled.  And Trump still hasn't ordered up an RCT even though it is his *duty* to do so.  Why is that?
"deserves" is a tricky thing. I'd rather he be mentally sharp as ever and lose to Trump spectacularly, then he "get what he fucking deserves," with a trial and federal prison sentence after a guilty verdict for his treason.
Trump won't give aid to the states, whose budgets are depleted from coronavirus (massive tax revenue losses) but $18B to Arizona, only, whose votes are critical to his re-election.

Trump's inability to stay on a given subject, instead drifting off into now-familiar monologues of self-absorption, is demonstrated in every speech, interview, press briefing, televised cabinet event, and tweet.
There’s a sign outside Missoula that says “TRUMP 2020!!!” in 8 foot tall letters on one side and “GET YOUR TNT - EXPLOSIVES HERE!!” on the other and if it doesn’t show up in the beginning of a New Yorker piece someday I owe you 5 bucks.

Facebook’s fact-checkers have ruled claims in Trump ads are false — but no one is telling Facebook’s users. As long as the money rolls in they turn a blind eye and they exempted political ads. Might as well be 2016 interference but now from the candidate
You're right. Before that display of hostility, I'm sure those lockdown protestors did their homework on that reporter and determined he "lied about them all the time." I'm sure no one experiences that at a Trump rally merely for being a member of the press.
You should go to another Trump rally, only this time identify as a reporter rather than a Democrat. Would be interesting to see if they are just as welcoming.
❌ The White House did not falsify an image of U.S. President Donald Trump’s rally in Tampa, Florida, to “make the crowd bigger.”   ✅ And to answer your other question, Trump did misspell "Florida" in a widely circulated tweet. Read more at  👇

The Trump Administration moved to prohibit antigen testing early in the game. Historical analysts will note that it was a move that greatly increased transmission over long timescales. Increasing transmission has always been the goal of Trump's administrative action.

I thought about that when watching the interview but then realized Swan was Australian and they (Trump) probably thought no one in the States would see it.
She won't.  She campaigned on Accountability and then let Trump settle charity fraud through the civil system.  Rather than prison, Trump got to pay back a fraction of that which he stole to put out behind him.
Yes, I do believe Donald Trump would authorize proxy use of bioweapons against Iran or China.  He's already using them against American children.
Trump hates most of the US media who don't do exactly what he tells them. He would never give most non-conservative American news outlets an interview like this.

This is fucking frightening. Trump is saying “Why should ANY officer or law enforcement agent be identifiable?” We gonna start doing masks to hide their faces?

Exposure only matters to Trump if it carries a consequence. The only consequence I've seen Trump incur is a $2,000,000 civil judgement out of NY for a charity scam. That's a bargain for offenses that should have been presented to a Grand Jury for potential indictment.
Trump's perceived ineptitude is so omnidirectional in effect that it might as well be a ratchet. In a political landscape where power-holding Democrats refuse to take meaningful action of any kind, a move forward is strong move regardless of potential exposure.

Imho, it’s because the Dems don’t want to defeat the GOP. They need the GOP. But they do want to beat Trump/reign in some of the fascist tendencies. So their dream is for the GOP to get its house in order, get “back to normal.” That’s why they’re crazy for the Lincoln project.

The Trump Administration is weaponizing these children against their communities.
They see this outbreak as an opportunity to line their pockets, consolidate power, and cancel the will of anti-Trump voters.  They always have.  Why what would Mr. Ross still have a job?

My grandfather, who was the most Trump-like person in my family, got an engineering degree at Northwestern and went on to become a very successful businessman.  He was a Limbaugh guy.  Entitled, upper-middle class white guys are not a new phenomenon.
Republicans who have been “so surprised” about the rise of Donald Trump are going to need to explain how they missed Rush Limbaugh for all these years.  Limbaugh’s cultural reaction laid the foundation for Trump.
Until Trump's approval rating is at or below 20%, I'm going to go ahead and say we live in a failed, racist society.
President Donald Trump is making big claims about cutting drug prices and about a COVID-19 treatment. Here's a look at that and more from the past week.

It’s easy to see how Trump won with the idiots you encounter on this site. This country deserves what it gets.Trump lies
Trump brags that "what we did at Bears Ears" is conservation! Trumps entire speech is just absurd! but IGNORANT MAGATS BELIEVE Trump's SHIT when a 3rd grader could see the absurdity!
Dainrs isn't just dishonest- HE SOLD OUT DEMOCRACY IN USA to his buddy Putin &amp; helped his king, Trump MURDER 170, 000 Americans &amp; counting. It's disgusting that Montanans, claiming to be "patriots, constitutionalists &amp; conservatives" defy EVERY principle they claim to uphold.
Rachel Maddow did a story about how the Trump campaign is involved in getting Kanye on the ballot. Me thinks I smell a rat.
Good points, but  really needs some credit for shackling himself to Trump
GOP has been in on it all along &amp; what baffles me is that people trash Trump all day long, deservedly, while GOP is just if not more guilty of murdering 170,000 Americans &amp; making USA a SHITHOLE COUNTRY.
I wonder what the total amount of our tax dollars is that tRump has spent for personal use and campaign events?
Agreed, wrote this earlier: Congress and Trump: Pass a #COVID19 #economy bipartisan bill: --PPP renewal, direct payments, #unemploymentextension, SNAP --$105B for education --#evictionmoratorium --testing $ --$200B to local govts, $10B for USPS.  This shouldn't be that hard.
40 Million out of work due to your colloidal bungling of the Trump Virus.  Worst unemployment since Great Depression.  Fail. #TrumpDeathToll160K
You know as well as we all do, Trump #OrangeStain Trump happened to us. It must be exorcised in November, then hauled off to the hoosgow.
Well, the study you quickly dismissed shows 34% of those with a post-graduate degree support Trump.  What I struggle to understand is how an educated veteran like yourself is okay with how Trump interprets scientific data and ignores intel that shows Russian bounties.
The endorsement of an impeached, racist, incompetent buffoon whose bungling of the Trump Virus has caused 160,000 American deaths is not helpful!😂😂😂😂 #TrumpIsACompleteFailure  #TrumpDeathToll160K
Trump announces Friday night news conference at Bedminster Golf Club — as mask-less members sip wine: report
The top counterintelligence official in the U.S. government warned Friday of ongoing interference and influence efforts by China, Russia and Iran.
I know you're not serious.  Source:   Bottom line: The less educated you are, the more you support Trump and the right.  How embarrassing for you.
I would put blame first and foremost on Donald Trump, Daines' bearhugging of him, and the fact this will be a referendum on an administration that...ummm--isn't doing well. The rest is really marginal.
Few will accept Trump's treason: (1) slow the mail, in hope that some mail-in ballets won't make it in time; (2) wanting &amp; having people vote on machines WITH NO PAPER TRAIL:  Trump's best pals, the RUSSIANS, LOVE THAT.  IS there a person with human decency that could vote Trump?
Yep! The time between Nov 3 and Jan 20 will feel like 4 more years of Trump although I believe shortly after Nov 3 there will be a mass exodus from HMS Trumptanic. This may hamper, hopefully, his ability to do significant damage during that time span. 🤞
Which one or ones of Trump's turkeys is on the chopping block today???

Trump isn't conservative.  Reagan rolls over in his grave on a daily basis.
A New York judge has dismissed president Donald Trump’s attempt to delay a defamation lawsuit brought against him by a woman who accused him of rape.
Because you support Trump.  He hasn't done a single thing about the intel showing Russian bounties on the heads of American soldiers.  You're a disgrace to this country.
We already know Trump and his cult followers are chumps.  Tell me something I don't know.
"Comrade"?  Trump is the one who knows about Russian bounties on the heads of American soldiers.  It's Comrade Trump.
Right!? Why is Trump so racist?
1. Unemployment rate for black Americans is 15% 2. Black business startups have not risen 400% (LOL  3. Wages have been growing since the recession ( 4. Trump isn't the only president to sign prison reform (
The unemployment rate for black Americans is 15%.  Trump enjoys a substantial 7% approval rate from that group.
Joe Biden eulogiesed senator bird a former kkk leader saying what a wonderful person and mentor he was.  Don't think trump ever did that
Playing electoral defense, Trump claims Biden opposes God...
Is anyone really surprised about Trump’s theology? Quite frankly, I’m more concerned about theological and cultural literacy within the church, not in the White House.
Lmao and you call yourself a Christian and support Trump.  That’s absolutely hilarious. You couldn’t be more of a joke and a fake Christian.
Trump’s presidency is a cancer on America.  160,000 dead Americans due to his denials, delays and lies; millions protesting in the streets due to his racism; and 40,000,000 Americans out of work due to his gross incompetence. Epic Fail. #TrumpFailedAmerica #TrumpTraitor
It’s called the Trump Virus because your denials (hoax, don’t worry it will go away), delays (PPE, ventilators) and lies (drink bleach) resulted in 160,000 dead Americans.  50,000 new cases and 2,000 deaths each day now.  Criminal.  Disgusting. #TrumpVirus  #PresidentDeath

Won’t pass anyway. Congress is full of libs and Trump is President. 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏽🤷‍♀️
you give these despots to much credit they have no souls to give- they're charlatans- snake oil salesmen just like Trump. Their God is $$$
You’ll never win a “Trump’s less racist than Biden” argument. It’s just too easy. We’ll stick to  what’s important.  160K Americans are dead. Trumps response: “it is what it is”.  If that’s okay with either of you, seek medical attention immediately.
Lying to stoke fear won’t work.  People are not motivated by fear or incompetence or hate.  They want good policies, decency and honesty.  Trump has none of these. Biden has these and much more.   #TrumpKillsAmericans  #Biden2020
No, go look at unemployment numbers under Obama and compare them to Trump.  Guess what unemployment is now.
This interview was last December. It's interesting to see how much more clearly Ms. Westover's speculation has been defined since COVID-19.

Trump advisers hesitated to give military options and warned adversaries over fears he might start a war
According to the same poll 63% of Americans favor automatic voter registration.  Do you have a clue as to why Trump and Republicans would have an issue with that?
Shall we go into Republican voter suppression tactics over the years?  We can start with voter ID, which Trump is a big fan of
Yeah... It's looking more and more like we're not going to get a debate. Sleepy  and the crew will somehow make it a "hazard" to have the debates. Trump will be made out to be the bad guy for "puting people in danger" all to protect Biden. Very sad actually. #Fairfight
You act like the media is putting words in Trump's mouth/Twitter account.  Show me where that's happened.
Let's clear something up. Do you think Trump is racist?

Read up on your history.   Trump could have used ANY OTHER PHRASE. HE DIDN'T. IT HAS RACIAL CONNOTATIONS and it was in response to black people protesting.
Shit, she won't even defend her own father to trump.
Thank you. You've finally acknowledged Trump is a racist, because of the racist shit he's said.
I said he might be a little racist because he says dumb shit. This account  has massive hard-on for Trump, as if he isn't racist.   I got receipts. Are you ready? We'll start with...  "when the looting starts, the shooting starts"  Any idea who initially said that?
Deirdre, stop deflecting. This is about Trump.  Do you think Trump is racist?
Let's unpack:  1) "CNN propagandists" - C'mon. That's just dumb to say and you sound like a Trump puppet (who's a serial liar) 2) Biden isn't inherently racist. He may say dumb shit, and he might be a little racist, but if you're comparing him to Trump, there's no comparison.
If you work at  now would be a good time to evaluate your priorities.  Will you look back with pride on your contributions to an org that actively supports right wing propaganda?
Lol.  Biden is Catholic.  Trump is desperate. #TrumpDeathToll160K

Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, an early advocate among Republicans of wearing masks and other pandemic precautions, tested positive Thursday for the coronavirus just ahead of a planned meeting with President Donald Trump.
The New York prosecutors who are seeking Trump’s tax records have also subpoenaed his longtime lender, a sign that their criminal investigation into Trump’s business practices is more wide-ranging than previously known.

Yes, it would be a gift to Trump, but dissolution of a thoroughly corrupt corporation (non-profit or otherwise) is entirely appropriate. Virtually every state's incorporation laws include such provisions -- we've just become used to law enforcement being soft on corporate crime.

Isn’t that the point ? Eliminate Americans that won’t vote for trump, Jared and trump all but said exactly that!
Apparently not since you've ignored all Trump's acts and only care about what he claims to have done (aka speeches).
Yet #GarrettFoster dies because a white supremacist wants to run over people and shoot others and like a hero he tried to help. Yet the white supremacist isn’t in jail either. Sounds like trump was right! A white supremacist could shoot someone on 5th ave and get away with it!
And?? That is normal for trump. #TrumpCrimeFamily and America is letting get away with everything! Sooooo when are Americans going to stand up against him?
Yep. Exactly.  Question for you disabled vet: how do you feel about Russians selling arms to the Taliban? Do you think Trump should question Putin about that and the intel about Russian bounties on the heads of American soldiers?

You have to remember: you're getting your information from Trump, a serial liar. He has zero credibility and he's not saying anything under oath.  I don't think you fully understand the gravity of the penalty of perjury.

Trump falsely says kids are 'almost immune' from Covid-19...Trump argued on Wednesday that children should return to US schools because they’re “almost” or “virtually immune” from the coronavirus.
I listen to things objectively. It doesn't matter what I want to hear. The truth hurts sometimes.  That's a real life interview of Donald Trump.  You should watch it.
Trump: #COVID__19 "will go away like things go away."   Hey #libertarians, call your office.  and his hands off policy is giving you a bad name--and causing deaths, and closing schools and businesses....
As Sally Yates testified today, it is a lie to say the Trump campaign was spied on
She testified under oath. She can't lie.  You, however, are on Twitter and so far up Trump's ass you can lie at will.
The answer Fauci is looking for is obvious- The  role model who should lead  USA into correct action on CV pandemic instead LIES, sabatoges, disrupts, corrupts any &amp; all CV actions &amp; messages causing deaths &amp; suffering of millions. Until Trump resigns this nightmare continues.

Trump's anti-immigration rhetoric during the pandemic has done little to budge public opinion on other immigration policies, the poll found. Most of Trump's policies, including his border wall, remain unpopular except among Republicans.
In an abrupt reversal, President Donald Trump is encouraging voters in the critical swing state of Florida to vote by mail after months of criticizing the practice — and while his campaign and the GOP challenge Nevada over its new vote-by-mail law.
Question: do all Trump supporters have to have their self-awareness surgically removed? Or does it fade away naturally.
Morning news headlines... One saying that Trump is suing NV over plans to have a mail-in election, followed by another headline that Trump is encouraging FL voters to vote by mail.   🙃 Okeedokee.🖕

I know Trump has been a shit show this week, but lets not lose sight of the fact that George Floyd, Brianna Taylor, and many others have been murdered by the police. No changes have been made. Its imperative we win the WH and the Senate so changes can be enacted.

I should add, that the only plausible value of the Electoral College was to correct electoral errors.  Given that it managed to install Trump despite the flashing red lights from the IC, I'd say that value is nil.
The electoral college must go.  Like race, it's a tool used by  and  to divide America.  Besides being sociopathic, abandoning Blue states means abandoning 22M Trump voters from 2016.  This is how we are polarized.

Trump always accuses others of the crimes he commits. He has accused you and Obama of spying on him. He is requesting funding for a West Wing remodel. The first thing to do when you get into that office in January is to have the place swept for listening devices.

Don't forget it was sold at a loss to Putin. Trump never makes money on anything he sells.
No. He doesn’t. He prolly wants to blame kids in cages on Trump but those are policies in place from the Obama administration. Then he will point to police brutality. Which the numbers haven’t changed under Trump in either direction. Just block him

trump’s elite proletariat .... it is what it is, let them eat cake. A homogenous group of milky white rich people there to fawn their dictator because he is making them richer.
Trump taking credit for something Obama did 10 years ago wbk
Um, I heart the Rambo, and Trump ain't no Rambo
Don't vote for trump.
A couple of tons actually. Was diagnosed with severe anxiety at age of 14. I’m 49 now. Have lost a grand baby( was 8 days old ), and my oldest daughter(32). Add Trump into that mix and you get almost insanity when it comes to anxiety. So I feel with you!!
Oh an Biden hates the Bible and hates god. But Trump carries a bible wherever he goes. But when asked what his favorite passage was, he could only answer with” oh that’s very personal to me, so I can’t talk about it”. What a total ASSBAG!!!
What difference does my religion make? Besides, if you think Trump upholds Christian values then I question your understanding of those values.
From your mouth to G-d’sears... #DumpTrump2020 History professor who has accurately predicted every election since 1984 says Trump will lose
They also have a clear audit trail so results and totals can be verified!!! I truly believe the Russians messed with totals a touch here and there and trump is illegitimate. I think that’s why he’s fighting so hard against mail in.
Do your research thise pics are pre Trump.  The EO's are his
Spare us. All you’ve done is carry water for Trump, Montana is ready for you to be gone.
Do you ever wonder if President Trump had used reverse psychology from the beginning what he could have gotten the Dems to do for us???  :-D
President Trump has ordered a sweeping but vague ban on dealings with the Chinese owners of social media apps TikTok and WeChat. But what is WeChat, and why is it so controversial?
Trump 2020
Please, just for once would you shut the bragometer down? You have absolutely nothing to boast about. You have taken a healthy economy left to you by Obama and flushed it down the toilet. You will not deal with trump virus. You lie every time you open your mouth.
Lot of this is very interesting and time will tell. The hands folding thing could be true but Cuomo’s nipple ring display as a sign of submission to Trump seems like another stretch to me. 😂
The Jill Stein narrative is so dumb. Way more people voted for Gary Johnson than her so if we're re-allocating third party votes, Trump is likely to do even better.
The orders take effect in 45 days and could bar the popular apps from the Apple and Google app stores, effectively removing them from U.S. distribution.
Really? So if you don’t like his pick, you’re voting for trump? What’s wrong with you?
I really don’t think Trump gets sacred
I’m not getting that vaccine...

I have not seen a Joe Biden yard sign but a did see a yard sign in Hurricane Utah that said “Anybody but Trump!”
That’s the big news? I thought it was going to be about Donald Trump.. very disappointing
She's going to vote for Trump either way.
By doing everything trump does........
But many others will vote Trump 🤣
As a article today asked: Don’t you think we would have already had a stimulus package by now if trump &amp; company’s portfolios were way down instead of way up ? You think they are caring when their stks are up ? Not.
If a Democrat was in office and handling everything the way trump is, would you say they are doing a good job and support the job they are doing?
trump’s policies put putin first and America hanging on for November.
0% chance Trump knows that Thailand used be Siam.
Also a debate hasn’t really shifter the state of a race since ‘76 w ford’s sphere of influence comment. There have been bad performances but nothing that fundamentally changed the race. Biden did ok against Bernie and I would consider stinky Bernie a better debater than trump.
It is true to some degree. Its the fact that Biden said it! My Lord, if President Trump had said that I shuttered to think what would happen. #Blexit #walkaway #Trump2020
Does it mean Never Trump is a vote for Biden?
How convenient for trump.
trump has cognitively checked out. Does he ever do his homework? Biden is a very devout Catholic and trump has no religion.
This is the same kind of logic that gave us "testing causes cases" from the folks who flunked Object Permanence 101 at Trump University's School of Very Stable Geniuses.
All trump supporters need to stand in line all day on Nov. 3rd to get their vaccine! The rest of us who choose to get vaccinated can go on the 4th.
Trump wants people to die!!!
You wish.  They are all above the law.  If Trump is not reelected, the investigations will all go away.  What does it matter now???
That's what trump calls progress! His brain is screwed!! Loosing is WINNING!!
DeWine took the test as part of standard protocol before meeting President Trump at an airport in Cleveland.
You hear trump try to read, speak and pronounce words lately? Total cognitive train wreck.
trump is a racist. Pass it on.
The Kanye that trump said he had nothing to with getting him on the ballot? The trump that lies every time he opens his tiny mouth?
trump is the biggest racist in our country.
Can I turn in Trump?
But what about all the trashy Trump branded clothing and accessories that are made in China?  Will he sign an executive order on that?

Of course...even if it hasn’t been fully tested trump will move mountains to get vaccine on/before Nov. 3 because his polling numbers are in the toilet.

When trump downplays the significance of #JohnLewis because of something as petty as not attending his inauguration you can be 💯% assured he doesn’t give a shit about *anyone* who doesn’t kiss his ass. We can all phuck off &amp; die for all he cares #DictatorTrump #TrumpVirus
You are so disingenuous.  Bi Partisan Huh? I’ve been watching your highly partisan hyperbolic ads full of divisive hatred for the Democrats of Montana.   You can’t have it both ways, you committed yourself to carrying water for Trump. This is your bed, lie in it.
says “Trump is super smart, speaks intelligently on matters in an appropriate way, and thinks he is in good shape.” Also agrees with Trump’s assertion that exercise wears out your body battery.
And keeps his mouth shut about Trump, who daily shows mental instability. Stupid fuck just can’t keep his mouth shut. Falls for crackpot conspiracies and repeats to his brain dead listeners.
Huh? Hillary? Joe? And your talking about Trump?
Did ya hear trump speaking to #commonsense! As if he ever had any!!! Obama was FINE!!!
A little brain comment from a Trump supporter. Thats rich
A hyperbolic strawman. Just stupid.  “It is what it is” ~President Trump speaking on more than 160,000 dead Americans!
"Quit fucking worrying"!?!?!? He is literally saying that he is going to take away legally owned property from millions of Americans who have never committed a crime. Would you worry if Trump promised to take your fucking car away??????
What happens if we give Trump a #DumbassVaccine?
Trump has that title!!
I don't know Trump is pretty much an expert on lots of things...women, how to run a large and moderately unsuccessful business, immigration, world affairs. Guy has like a PhD in like 10-15 disciplines😂
That is totally illegal and we as a nation need to use our collective voice and scream NO to trump using the WH for a political party speech. The WH is the people’s house.
What has this country come to? trump incites this anger and hatred in his base. They are like a pack of rabid dogs doing his bidding. Dr. Fauci does not deserve this treatment, he has been honest in trying to inform us about the virus.
Think about this...when trump tosses his 9 iron in the sand trap for the last time there won’t be an eulogy. And the only people attending his funeral will be his corrupt family.
#LincolnVoter  I was raised in a strong Republican family. I will not vote Republican as I see trump trying to take total control of our country and he has no boundaries. The Republican Party is no longer conservative, it is trumpanian and there is a huge difference.
Man, this is like every Trump press conference he has ever done.

Yes, this kind of epic failure can only be accomplished by trump. I would agree with that.
Reformed and regenerated. Give me a break. He is a false prophet to all you bible worshippers. You have lost all your morality in the name of "conservative values". 10 years ago no conservative would come near Trump but now you all worship him.
Trump supporter.   That’s very polite.    I of course have many different things to call them.
Trump lies in your face.
Hahahaha Hahahaha Yeah right. If anything it will siphon votes from trump.
Lmao typical trump supporter.. can’t defend trump.. always blaming others. Pathetic 😂
Biden is a better man.. trump is a turd dressed up in lipstick.. his supporters are nothing more than hypocrites.. you love him so much please defend this tweet.. I need a laugh
😂😂 Trump can’t even pronounce Yosemite
I’m curious on how trump supporters can defend him after this tweet. #FUCKTRUMP
Tell trump!
Says a Trump supporter.
You forgot "out". Vote Trump OUT for a better world.
I do my best not to take this guys literally on most things he says but we should be worried he is clearly showing he wants the US to be run by a Trump always. That’s some dictator shit.
Did... did.. did trump just actually go like full up "eternal leader?"
Without facts, trump lies again. He likes bigly bombs.
Trump has a 90% chance of winning and the markets know it.
You actually think Trump is going to lose? All that’s happening is the Dems are creating doubt that they can’t lose so when Trump wins again the snowflakes will be pissed.  Heck 50/50 Biden even survives until Nov.  His health is not good.
You did an amazing job and your interview could be the key to voters getting rid of trump.
If trump said it, consider the source and veracity.

The appeal Christianity holds for Trump isn't that Trump's myriad sins are forgiven by his supposed belief in Christ, it's that all of them excused - encouraged, even - by his followers.
Daines and Sen. Cory Gardner, R-CO, are credited with convincing Trump to support the legislation at a White House meeting this year, even though Trump has repeatedly tried to slash spending for the Land and Water Conservation Fund in his budget proposals.

For those wondering, The Lincoln project are Republicans who think Trump is a terrible human being, and if youre still for Trump cause “yer not a lib”, then you’re just as dumb as the president and fee validation cause he’s the first president you could relate to.
I'm guessing a lot of the people polled aren't being truthful because of what happened in 2016 and are intentionally lying about who they support.  I voted Dem down the ticket in my open primaries, but I can't wait to vote for Trump in November.
hey bitch why do you touch up that growth on your face its you ain't it.  Second of all you suck at your job. President Trump is better  American then any hack working at fake news CNN

I just researched the Kinsey report 1941. For the sake of god why president is that allowed in publication and also a format for education in the schools? This rabbit hole is deep. How can you prosecute ghislaine maxwell and allow this teaching in schools? Explain President trump

Link one instance where Trump is anti-abortion.
I agree with all of that and I think he would’ve gotten nothing done. Although it pains me to admit it, I think gene wouldn’t have been electable while I think bernie would’ve Beaten trump by a decent Margin. That’s a reflection more on trump than Bernie though
“Folks in rural areas reported lower trust across all sources, with the exception of President Trump."
No. He doesn’t have the brain matter to debate a pile of 💩, let alone President Trump!!
Trump is a moron so I'd be hesitant to quote him in support of an argument.
I think fear has a lot to do with it. Fear and desperation. And some people just buying into Trump’s bullshit. But I think it’s mostly people who just desperately want a quick fix.

Trump has literally not passed one ioda of policy since he’s been in office. Executive orders are not policy. They’re smoke screens. There is literally no policy he has advanced to make us better. Provided tax cuts to corporates, deregulated the environment, added some judges. 🤷‍♂️
US "democracy" should be eroded along with the rest of it.  Biden also chastises Trump for some of the few good things he's proposed like reducing troop levels in Asia and Europe.
Of Iraq/were largely happy with the result. Their brand of conservatism is just as cruel and vile as any, but they’ve found their way into the hearts of a number of liberals over a shared hatred of Trump. I’m not asking you to change any of your beliefs, but it would mean a lot

A great new book... Get Trump to drive past grassy knolls...
A comparison of reactions of Obama's victory compared to Trump's might just drive trump over the edge. That'd be a shame.
you blame Trump for all of the covid deaths because he didn't do enough. And now after state officials closed private businesses, to protect people, you blame Trump for people being out of work, after he encouraged states to reopen businesses. You have issues dude
BAN #TIKTOK #MAGA THANK YOU president trump

Fauci 53%, Trump less than half at 21%, yeah that some mix drop.
Trump doesn't think about how tiktok has helped us so much through this pandemic like if you want to stop from getting hate from gen z then think about us cuz this pandemic is harder on us since we are so young and speeding our childhood by staying inside
Microsoft is trying to buy it because Trump says it’s out of country. Stan Microsoft 🥵
If Trump bans Tick Tok, PTP has a strong claim against him. Lazy drug fueled industrial music will not be so easily stopped.
"As far as TikTok is concerned, we’re banning them from the United States," President Trump told reporters on Friday.
What does this mean? No seriously can someone tell me what this means because I am freaking out that I didn't know Obama ran against Trump. I might have a serious mental or physical problem.
GFY. Better by a lot of beer. Trump will be humiliated and then he’s going to jail.

Looks like lunch-box Joe is a secret Trump supporter.
A Wyoming man has been found guilty of threatening to kill President Donald Trump.
The Trump administration is proposing to define what land and water can be declared as "habitat" for imperiled plants and animals - potentially excluding areas that species could use in the future.

No proof from legitimate studies that HDC works AT ALL. Social distancing and mask do have proof, but you didn’t want to respond to that, did you? I think you’re confusing Fauci with trump, are you going to watch trump throw out the first pitch on aug. 15? Oh wait, another lie.
Thank you, Dr trump for clarifying this. As usual, you remain uninformed and ignorant.
Whatever they come up with will be more lies. Just keep trump talking, he’s doing a great job of self-destructing.
So let me get this straight.   Covid-19 isnt harmful enough to: -keep people home -shut the country down for a short time.  -keep schools closed -financial asssistance  But..  Covid-19 IS scary enough that: -Trump tied people cant stay in jail -we need to delay the election?????
Trump suspends the election, President Chuck Grassley declares the People's Republic of Grassley (Or Grassland).
What is so sad is that you believe a man who’s cheated on every wife, slept with porn stars, covets his daughter, is the hero in all this. Trump &amp; Epstein were best buddies. The rumor is their falling out was because they were competing over taking someone’s virginity, allegedly.

And they say he’s racist! Get a load of these libtards in the comments. Thank you president trump for always standing  up for us !! We won’t be silenced
The pandemic is doing far more effective job as hurting Trump’s chances of reflection than the Lincoln Project is. Should we consider Covid-19 an ally? I know it’s probably going to kill hundreds of thousands of people in our country, but it’s really exposing Trump’s incompetence
What are you talking about? How are they allies? I know, they don’t like trump, but how are they allies? If it is an alliance in your mind, how helpful would it be if they just want another Bush type president? Also, we don’t need their help and should stop pretending we do.
Funny how all these people who have such little empathy all have Trump in their bios. Seems like they have something in common...
Will the election be delayed? No. But before the last one trump claimed fraud, If I don’t win the system is rigged! Then he lost the pop vote cuz of “illegals” and “dead people voting.” The numbers gotta be there ppl, let’s make it clear!#VoteBlueToSaveAmerica  #HitTheRoadTrump
Violent rates in my red city in a red state have steadily increasesed the last 3.5 years. It’s almost as if a Trump’s polices *haven’t* lowered crime.
Four more years of the corrupt and incompetent GOP?  The largest federal deficit in history, during a strong economy.  Before the GOP bungled the coronavirus response.  Before the GOP cratered the US economy.   Trump GOP is an embarrassment.
Google US Covid deaths. Google Trump disbanding pandemic response. You seem like a super caring person, so concerned with foreign deaths- why so little about Americans?
Lol. High level trolling by spelling “you’re” as “your. Well played sir, acting like a moronic Trump supporter is next level shit.
Hey Bill, how many times has President Trump said something tongue-in-cheek. He knows It Would Drive Democrats crazy to suggest this. After all Democrats released the virus.
tbh Trump knows what he's doing. But WHY does he want people do get sick and possibly die? What an asshole he is.
Oh Ya. He is and always will be THE MAN. Nomatter what Trump does or says , he can never take away from the fact that Obama did more for this country in 8 short years, than almost any President in history. And FUCKHEAD TRUMP HATES HIM FOR THAT. He’s never done anything for us
1- There is no mechanism for Trump to change anything about the way the election is conducted. That was done on purpose. 2- Trump's term expires 20 January 2021 regardless, so if there was no election, Nancy Pelosi would be acting president. Does Trump really want that?
"Soon after the government issued the bleak economic data, President Donald Trump diverted attention by suggesting a “delay” in the Nov. 3 presidential election, based on his unsubstantiated allegations that widespread mail-in voting will result in fraud."
Trump, his supporters, his gestapo, and those who deny the harm he's caused has damaged the US and its image.  They're nothing but fascist rats that are trying to destroy the United States.
Because it was a garbage narrative created by the Trump crew. Trumps GOP is inept and corrupt.
So... was being a Trump supporter worth it?
How many Trump voters does Trump plan to kill before the 2020 election?
To Trump “harmful” is an accelerant
If Obama said "delay the election" y'all trump supporters would demand him to be removed you fucking hypocrites
Beyblade predicted Trump.
I can never forgive white evangelicalism of the hell and misery they put this country through because of their support of Trump.
The dates of federal elections are enshrined in federal law and would require an act of Congress to change.
Constitution says he can't delay the election,   Also President Trump and Vice President Pence voted by mail
Donal Trump effectively rapes our democracy and American public daily - daily!  And we’re helpless.
The Trump administration is railing against a Montana senator for calling the federal government’s coronavirus response an “American failure."
I hope all the right wingers in this thread supporting Trump's fascist Stormtroopers arresting anti-racist demonstrators also support China's national security law in Hong Kong aimed at rioters who actually assaulted random and elderly citizens.
Does he even have better policies though?  Democrats have been trying to out-hawk Trump lately, including Joe.Trump is the Anti Christ
My mother was a devout Catholic who also lost a child, my sister. Her faith never wavered but grew.  What Trump said about   yesterday is blasphemous to all people who have had their faith tested and were made stronger by that test. 👇 My mom at 16.

This reporter really failed at his job. Rather than get to the heart of the matter (that Ghislaine Maxwell committed some really evil acts &amp; that tRump supports that), he just let tRump keep parroting the line “I wish her well”, then quickly changed the subject. Media fail!
tRump can’t debate. He can only attack and sling shit.

If Trump can do this then we know that he will try cheating again on the elections how is the government going to stop him from being able to cheat the people of the United States someone should be doing something to stop him
You think you can block Conservative views go ahead you ASSHOLE KEEP IT UP AND YOU WILL LOSE ALL! TRUMP 2020 you must think America doesn't see what you are doing? WE ARE NOT AS STUPID AS YOU SEEM TO THINK!!
You know...Trump wasn't saying that all those things he did for Blacks were good things. We are injecting "good" into his statement when his intention was the opposite. Hey, if his base can reinterpret him so can I.

Federal leaders are finally able to wrap up permanent financing of the Land &amp; Water Conservation Fund, with the President signing legislation into law today:
Trump is the one in the relationship who cheats, calls you a fat whore, and then says “calm down, you’re hysterical” and “I don’t see a problem here.”
President Trump to Sen. Daines a few minutes ago at signing of Great American Outdoors Act: "Say hello to the the people of Montana, they are pretty happy right now."
This one time... Trump read ah ah ah, you know...a book, a manual... a wordy thing. With words and information. So many words, you've never seen anything like it. It was written by White House Staffers for his eyes only.
So when Trump first started out is the new president he was so concerned about people not using the Postal Service I'm afraid that it was going to be shut down and now he wants to shut them down so we can't use mail-in votes how ironic
What if Trump has a plan to have all Democratic mail in votes list Joe, what happens then?
Trump is the living embodiment of what my 8th grade math teacher said: "Statistics don't lie, but liars can use statistics."  This interviewer IMMEDIATELY catches him on his BS.   Also, for the record, countries like South Korea kicked our tails in percentage of the pop tested.
There are a great many things I never questioned before Trump. This has been one hell of an eye opening nightmare. I'm thankful, in a way. Not for Trump himself, but for the fact that he's been such a monster, it's caused so many people...myself included... to wake up.
Trump is a fraud!

Trump’s not banning tiktok!!! He just needs to let it go and let it be!!
Good job TikTok for firing back at Trump 👏 thank you for doing so! He deserved it and had it coming to him! TikTok’s not going anywhere
Honestly, fuck trump. You really HAD to ban tiktok? One of the few things that brings me enjoyment! Fuck this noise.
Excellent point. Everything Trump’s minions do lead back to him though…they aren’t criminal masterminds.

Lord Trump the Protector of Our Liberties and Savior of America also sits at the right hand of God, why would he ever need to leave?  Are they still talking about doing that pesky election?  It's been cancelled, were you not aware?  Oh, maybe that isn't in the talking points yet.
Mail-in voting is the only sure way that we are going to beat Trump without him cheating he should be afraid he's on his way out
Of course Trump doesn't like it he can't cheat like he did in 2016
Anyone actually supporting Trump on this one? Anyone? Anyone at all? 🤓

Very great thread. If you’re saying that voting for Biden is better in a vacuum, you’re not wrong, but if you’re advocating for voting as the only means of change, then you don’t understand the situation we’re in right now.

But also, if Biden loses, we have four more years of Trump.
An election between Trump and Biden is just choosing a favorite oligarch. #Revolution
Those who refuse to vote for Biden/Harris are the ones with REAL political courage. They refuse to be bullied into voting for a racist war monger and a cop. I applaud you all. #DemExit #NeverBiden
Millions and millions of lives were ruined by Biden’s Iraq War vote, and not only is he receiving no punishment for his actions, he is being rewarded. FUCK THAT! FUCK THIS IMPERIALIST SHITHOLE COUNTRY! #NeverBiden #IraqiLivesMatter #DemExit
Biden doesn't even know if Kamala is his wife, sister or girlfriend,  and kamala is evil. We're screwed if thats hope!
Biden paved the way to Trump.
He should thank the healthcare industry whom all our politicians are beholden to, including Biden.
Always remember, democrats were willing to completely overlook the thousands killed and millions displaced by Biden’s vote for the illegal Iraq War.
I’m not saying I want them to sink Biden against Trump, I’m saying that, once Biden was the chosen nominee, these comments were effectively scrubbed from the public mind because the Party wanted them to be.
I ain’t voting for biden, give me all the smoke.
Watching Ava DuVernay’s documentary about systemic racism and mass-incarceration is now more depressing than ever given that I now know Ava supports the Biden/Harris mass incarceration ticket. Good god, liberals are toxic. #DemExit

Lol  Biden not making it and Harris still being #2
Every media outlet that covers the “president” live should be on a 5 sec delay - if he starts to attack  Biden/Harris cut the feed. Simple.
Trump also urges Americans to wear masks but opposes a national requirement. Plus: The NFL tries to virus-proof stadiums, and local school officials struggle with reopening difficulties.
Can’t wait for Biden/Harris to win, do absolutely nothing substantive to fix any of the massive structural problems, and then lose 100+ congressional seats in the 2022 midterm and get absolutely demolished by Tom Cotton/Nikki Haley in 2024. Hey, at least Orange Man gone, right?
Did Joe scarbrough just take the Biden story and decide, "f*ck it.. I'll just say this is Trump."????
You know what, Jeannine Piro and this idiotic outrage by liberals just raised an incredible point I hadn't considered... Biden may be solely  attempting to get Kamala elected. He'll drop out.
Biden voted for the illegal Iraq War, which killed thousands and displaced millions. But hey, who cares about Iraqis, right?!
It started with a tweet from Dr. Jill Biden. “Hey (Douglas Emhoff). Are you ready?” she asked. “Ready to work! Let’s go (Dr. Jill Biden)!” he wrote back. So who is Douglas Emhoff?
The bullshit will continue unabated regardless of who you vote for. For the 40th consecutive year the oligarchy will win BIG.  "Nothing will fundamentally change." -Joe Biden to donors.
Look up “Biden quid pro quo Ukraine”. Or do you choose to ignore that little diddy?
um, your argument was about a Biden presidency, not about governors...
For Biden to choose a VP that doesn’t meet the minimum quals spelled out in Constitution, after long vetting process of 11 candidates, he &amp; team would be totally incompetent (like Trump &amp; his team). And a dude  a 3rd tier law school is the only one to figure it out. Right. 1/2
Yeah! Who cares about all the Iraqis murdered, tortured and displaced by Biden’s Iraq War vote. Those people don’t matter. What matters is liberals feeling comfortable with the war monger in the White House.
Yeah, you Biden people truly have your fingers on the pulse.
BOY do I love to see Trump getting nervous seeing a powerful black woman take the VP spot for Biden. Women are powerful and are going to change the world.
You can’t oppose the oligarchy if you vote for it. Trump and Biden are both part of the ruling class. Stop affirming them.
Joe Biden was a segregationist. That was not a unification movement.
Biden doesn't even care!🤣
Get caught up with the morning's top headlines, the national weather forecast, today's celebrity birthdays and more.
I realize this election is (somehow) not a foregone conclusion despite a perfect storm of generically incumbent-destroying factors, but I want to add, I don’t think Trump’s campaign calling Biden and Harris “horrible” and “mean” is the stuff of champions
I have a whole rant about *how being Attorney General works* when it comes to Harris, but I know she has other troubling history, but the fact that Biden picked her actually gives me a lot of hope. She was one of his harshest critics in the early debates, and he still picked her.
Do Biden and Harris have troubling histories? Absolutely. Do I agree with them on everything? Of course not. Will I vote for them? Of. Fucking. Course. They may not be the best for the job, but they won’t actively joke about wanting me dead or willfully ignore a pandemic.
Ok I see a lot of folks are mad about Biden/Harris being the ticket, and I get it, it’s not my first choice either. I have concerns too. But here’s the biggest thing I feel right now: I don’t want to die. I am a chronically ill queer Jewish person, and I’m terrified.
Trump’s campaign is going to try to make Kamala seem radical so the more they can do stuff like this the better.  That’s how they beat Hillary.  So far, they haven’t been able to do it to Biden.  That’s how a progressive like Tammy Baldwin wins Wisconsin.
Come on man! Come on man? Joe? Joe is that you? Joe, your names NOT Scott Thomas. It's Joe Biden. Now, go back into your basement, take your meds and go sleepy-time....and Joe, try not to say "Come on Man, people will recognize it's you....\Engir enskir, engir rasistar!!!
What do you get when you cross Joe Biden and a Crocodile?  A- A dead Pedophile.
Democrats, especially under Obama/Biden helped build this country into a dictatorship. Obama rampaged throughout the world with extrajudicial killings, extraordinary rendition and dirty wars. It’s ironic that you think Joe will obstruct the march towards dictatorship.
Why Kamala Harris VP pick could cost Biden the election  #FoxBusiness - Well the Democratic party isn't the party I joined so this will not be a hard choice; do I want to defund the police? Do I like vandalism on the property? Intel moved to Texas -no
At this point, these tweets are just getting tiring. If you truly believed these things, you wouldn't have rolled over to Joe Biden.
Biden has pronounced Kamala at least 3 different ways lol, I feel for her, having a name no one can say or spell correctly.
Maya Rudolph, portrayer of Kamala Harris on "SNL," admits she could be busy ahead of the election after Harris was announced as Joe Biden's running mate.
That's a forced choice 2 way choice. Standard, non forced, including alternatives is Biden +9 which is right in line with other polls
It’s almost like you should’ve listened when we said we wouldn’t vote for Biden. Congratulations on your racist nominee
Fun fact: If you look at the vote totals in 2010, it was actually a low turnout election for both Democrats and Republicans.  2018 saw almost 10% more of the electorate turn out.  There’s no reason 2022 needs to be like 2010.  And no one thinks Biden’s a savior.
It’s not a coincidence they announced Karine Jean-Pierre as Kamala’s COS before announcing Kamala.  I think Kamala’s fine but Karine was the signal to progressives that Biden’s people are still paying attention.
I actually kind of think this is true.  Lest we forget, Obama had to clean up some of this stuff for Biden when Biden was his VP.  Nominate the Biden, take the ride.
MoveOn will literally be in the White House if Biden wins.
I see they’ve decided to try the failed Biden strategy again.
yeah Biden sucks and so does Harris, but if we work as a nation to hold them accountable we can make sure their policies work for all the people. plus, Trump sucks even more
Biden voted for the Iraq War and got thousands killed and millions displaced. Why are those lives completely ignored? Many Iraqis are dead because of Biden.
First look at my twitter feed this morning and it's basically everything you need to know to vote in 2020...  1) Kamala Harris 2) #Walk2EndAlz (alzheimers) 3) Joe Biden   That about sums it up
A radical job-killing agenda? Take a moment for introspection. Biden/Harris would have to work pretty hard to kill more jobs (and people) than the GOP has since March 2020. #mtpol #mtsen #GOPvirus
A group seeking to place rapper Kanye West's name on the Montana's presidential ballot this fall has spent the past few days gathering signatures from Yellowstone County residents, telling them their signature could help take votes away from Joe Biden.
Nothing  said is wrong and you know it. It was all true even BEFORE Trump got elected. Some of us will suck it up and vote for Biden. Is the goal to go back to the "before" Trump though? Fuck that shit.
4) if Biden loses, don't resign half-way through your term to become a reality TV star. That never ends well.
As a sickening, dangerous, often-bleached deadly virus yourself you should better understand Biden’s attempts to protect his health.

That’s actually hilarious. That’s just them crying in their beer (or wine) realizing their hopes and dreams have been dashed and crushed - they know Biden/Harris is a formidable team and are going to win in November.
Here are my real thoughts on Kamala Harris: she is a politician.  That’s a good thing and a bad thing.  It will be incumbent on progressives to push Biden and Harris to maximize policy outcomes.  But first we elect them.
Kamala attacked Biden on his record on policy. Policy is what political debate is about. Trump attacked on a personal level, his dad being involved in JFK assassination and insulting his wife. Cruz doesn't deserve any credit.
Warren is talking policy with Biden on a weekly basis and he’s already adopted a number of her policies.  This is literally the dumbest website in the history of the world.
The next step is electing Biden, getting majorities in Congress, and legislating.
Im not gonna vote for Trump nor am I going to vote for Biden. I don’t vote for racists or fascists or war mongers or neoliberals. Lefties screamed this in your faces before the primaries even started. You didn’t listen.
Biden’s vote got tens of thousands killed and displaced millions. Not to mention the torture program and all the psychotic black sites. Democrats spent the whole primaries whining about Bernie and somehow forgot about Iraq. That is a moral failing I will not support. I’m done.
Trump says if Biden wins we will have to learn to speak Chinese. Ni  hao . Already now ola and aloha. Some would consider learning another language intellectual. This country could use some culture after this orangeneck racist retard!
She can play Dr Jill Biden!
How Joe Biden kept his VP pick a secret
Kamala Harris named by Joe Biden as his VP pick #BidenHarris
Biden's mental deterioration is so fucking bad, no way he lasts a full four. I got 20 bucks on him publically calling someone an outdated slur from 30 years before he was born.
Biden legit is running a "supercop" as his vp during a time where theres mass unrest due to police violence. He doesn't want to win. We are doing a presidential election where neither candidate represents the will of the people, or want to actually be president.
Please vote for Joe Biden. Please don’t make America suffer with Trump again.
I genuinely wish Biden and Kamala were the monsters conservatives feared.
If it wasn't clear, I'll be voting for Biden and Harris.  Do I agree with them completely? Nope. Do I think they're the best hope we have to create a government that's on the right track? Yep.
Can’t believe we started with the most diverse set of candidates ever and we ended up with milktoast old establishment Biden and Harris 🙄
Fulfilling a debate promise, Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate
MSNBC: Kamala Harris is Biden’s pick as a running mate! Harris is married to a lawyer, has two step children, and her name means “lotus” in Sanskrit!  Women:
I appreciate your pragmatic approach. We will hold her &amp; Biden’s feet to a hot fire.
Honestly, I was hoping Biden would pick Tammy Duckworth but I also understand not many people value her experience coal-founding the GPS Caucus as much as I do. Such is the way politics often goes for a wonk.

I was holding out hope for a classic Biden switcheroo where he announces that he’s stepping down and it’s going to be Bernie and Angela Davis.

Biden picking Harris is Obama picking Biden.
He was waiting for the Biden Romney ticket, I guess?
Yeah wow Kamala probably shouldn't have done those things that Tulsa called her on. Not her fault that Kamala sucks or that Biden picked her.
Biden/Harris!! I love it! Thank you.
Biden mic dropping his VP pick!
Do you remember when Kamala Harris ripped Joe Biden a new one live on national TV and then later he was like, "OK, but I would like to lead this country with you" because that's the shit I'm here for.
We should have an enthusiastic conversation in the comments about how excited we are for Joe Biden to be president so Twitter will push this higher in the replies!

One night in February we went to the local Eagles and saw an oldies band play and at the end of their set they said, "Thank you! See you all in September!" And I think that's what the Biden VP announcement is going to be like.
My first Presidential vote was for McGovern. And you are correct- EVERY TIME Dems have been close to go more Left (which still isn’t “Left,” or more progressive) it gets stopped in it’s tracks. And this year, the same, the Dems and Americans fell back on “the white dad.” Biden👍
I remain confused about all the Kasich complaining.  Kasich is endorsing Joe Biden, not the other way around.  He represents an important bloc of swing voters Democrats are chasing.  It’s actually kind of a big deal he’s speaking at the convention.

This is exactly the point for me. It’s been very depressing seeing some leftists become laser focused on whether you should or shouldn’t vote for Biden, which is exactly what the establishment wants peoples’ energy focused on.
The Biden VP farce feels like if you were drowning and the lifeguard came to the edge of the water and shouted, “I’m going to help you! But first...I’ve got someone coming to help me...I think you’ll be really excited about who it is...any guesses???”
It’s awkward when Joe Biden pretends to be a protector of social security. #DemExit #SocialSecurity
I’m with you, Betsy. I’m disappointed in the choice, but I’m in. I don’t feel my vote matters though, but Biden’s got it. My anti-Daines, anti-Gianforte, anti-Rosendale  votes are crucial, though. I hope people don’t get so caught up in Trump that they lose sight of that.
Even if that were true, Milano is fine with millions of Americans having no healthcare, that includes those with mental illness. Biden said he would veto #MedicareForAll. Such a threat doesn’t effect a rich person like Milano.
Wrong. We need WAAAAAAAAAY less privileged, liberals. In fact, Milano is pure toxicity. She supports a racist, war monger like Biden. Democrats have zero moral credibility.
Did Biden remember that you had a great time with your friends and your loved ones?
Biden’s gonna unveil his VP and it’s gonna be a mirror and the announcer will say, “That’s right, America, Joe wants YOU by his side this November!” and then they’ll cut to a commercial for one of those sit down bathtubs.
Irony is the Democrats still want black peoples to do what they told (vote for racist Biden or you not black)
Yea Biden go!!!!!
Yeah, I don’t like Zephyr Teachout anymore.  She’s also the one who pushed a corruption narrative against Biden in the primary that Bernie himself disavowed.  Complete Leftist hack.
Biden was a United States Senator since the ‘70s and Vice President of the United States.  He’s running against a bankruptcy-prone, former reality TV host who is one of the most corrupt, incompetent, hated presidents in history.

Well, one reason you go with Biden is that his consistently superior polling against Trump means he has more margin for error than anyone else.  And Republicans just handed Democrats a tricky situation, particularly since the press isn’t talking about the legality.
That would be an interesting podcast.  You should hash out where you guys think Biden could possibly find common ground with Republicans.  Keep in mind, they walked away from market-based solutions to global warming and now call it a hoax.
The GOP may have nominated Romney in 2012 but Obama’s election broke their brains.  Lest you forget, Romney promised to be a hard-liner on immigration.  All the sane Republicans either left the party or are voting for Biden.  This is not your father’s Republican Party.
At least Bernie had policy. Biden just says C’mon Man while pushing bad 90s politics.
Why is everyone sleeping on Big Gretch for VP if that’s the only person we know Biden has had an in-person meeting with?
I’m curious how Biden’s whole plan of doing absolutely nothing will play out.
Imagine trying to impugn Nina Turner on behalf of Joe Biden and thinking you are the one with any amount of decency. Liberals are dangerous racism enablers.
I LOVE my Bernie stan frens. They are extremely valuable to my community. This is absolutely not a fact. He didn't have the intersectional buy-in to beat Joe Biden, a man few people like or trust. Yes, Biden used the system to do it, but GOP/Cambridge would go so much harder.
Biden won't know, it will be the rest of the demonrats!
What I think is insensitive and potentially alienating is speculation that any voter won’t/can’t look at Biden’s overall record and draw their conclusions rather than decide in the moment based on a media driven gaffe narrative.
Lol! Trying to do damage control on Biden’s outdated and idiotic stance on marijuana legalization?

I know this has been said before, but if Democrats are concerned about Kanye West siphoning off votes from Biden, isn't that more a reflection of their candidate and platform rather than a reflection of Republican election strategy?
Occurs to me that we are already so used to Russian interference that we almost discount it but this "new" info that China and Iran favor Biden is a Trump head-fake? How will the average mouth-breathing three-toothed MAGAt react to hearing that "Eye-ran wants Biden t' win !" ??
Biden will malfunction with these responses in a debate.
It's ridiculously simple:  add Medicare for All to his platform. 87% of Dems want it &amp; 67% of all registered voters want it. Why not?!
Joe Biden is the nominee, folks.  And he won bigger than Hillary in 2016.  The Democratic electorate is pragmatized.  The Iraq War both radicalized and pragmatized me in the Aughts.  Supported the progressive in the 2004 primary and Kerry in the general.
Dodd, yes.  But I don’t think Rendell is in Biden’s inner circle.
Legionnaires' disease is not being misdiagnosed as COVID-19, and a missile wasn't responsible for the massive explosion in Beirut. Here are the facts.
Is he letting them?  Rendell is an idiot who Hillary also had to clean up after in 2016.  Some people are arguing that they themselves are jockeying for relevance.  Didn’t Biden make Rendell and Dodd backtrack?
I don’t like Axelrod but this a good point and one of Biden’s strengths as VP.In her first media interview since becoming Joe Biden’s running mate, Kamala Harris stressed Friday the importance of voting, vowing to fight suppression efforts.

I'm gonna start by saying I love you but have a serious question for ya. Do you feel the same way about Joe Biden's many accusers that did for Dr. ford? Should your same logic be applied to Biden?
One Tough Question For DOJ If Biden Is Elected: Whether To Prosecute Trump
put some wings on it and we can one up Jesus on this one. for jumping a Biden.. I mean shark.
you know why the image show the tsunami's are not hitting the white house? yep, Biden's not in there yet, there waiting for him.   all those people serving more time in prison cuz of him are wishing that on him &amp; his house.
alert! sarcasm detected!  Still better then biden's small pp type stuff. also Yes I could have done better with blender. still funny tho.
Your fear is warranted.  Biden and Harris will soon bring decency, honesty and competence back to the White House.  You are a failure as both a person and president. #TrumpDeathToll167K  #TrumpTraitor
😂😂😂 The guy who called the virus a hoax, refused to wear a mask and promised it would just disappear thinks voters will blame...Democrats? Joe Biden?
I don’t think so. Biden’s gonna do very well in Missoula, Gallatin, and Park, but he’ll underperform Tester and Bullock statewide. Without hitting 40% in some red eastern counties, there’s just no path to 47% statewide, and he’s not gonna do well enough in the East
Saint obama and saint biden got sh** done!  Lol
..also just as amazing &amp; forceful message of Biden/Harris goals, intentions. Justice, equality for all in contrast to fascist gop crap. So inspiring, hopeful!
The Lincoln Project fully endorses former Vice President Biden’s selection of Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate.
I understand your fear and lashing out.  It is fully warranted.    Biden and Harris will restore decency, honesty and capability, things you and your pal Trump know nothing about. #GymJordanKnew  #TrumpIsACompleteFailure  #Biden2020
I don't know how people aren't getting that. I'm not thrilled with Biden being the nominee. But I'll gladly take him any day of the week over what we've had these last 4 years and how much it will get in the next 4.
Social distancing. There are miles between enthusiastic Biden supporters.
Biden has nads?
And what reason could Biden possibly have for choosing Kamala that makes it so I shouldn’t vote for them? Trump is anti John Lewis so he is literally anti civil rights and a white supremacist. Whether she’s a token candidate or not she is a direct challenge to trump.
Obviously, Biden/Harris is the choice but it’s clear that left and leftleaning voters r not represented or r actively villified by both parties.     need to found own party and run against corporate democrats and rightwing Republicanparty
This is silly. Harris is a moderate like Biden in the classic sense that the founders designed for and radicals hate.
That’s fair. I expect Biden to be a pretty unpopular president so I bet she’ll draw a serious challenge unless she’s already president
Dude you can’t just say that fucking four years out. Biden could end up being immensely unpopular and Harris would face a challenge from the left and moderate wings in the primary. And the left will put up someone against her anyways
So basically your saying instead of Biden/Harris you'll endorse/embrace racism, misogyny, corruption, white supremacism, ignorance, TREASON, Russian election interference, isolationism, authoritarianism and everything anti-American, anti-democracy and anti-Constitution.
No I wouldn’t vote for biden regardless of his VP
Biden just lost the election for himself lmao
I think the Harris pick hurts Biden more than helps. That’s if he even made the pick himself 🤣
About the only person that Biden could have announced that would have lost my vote at this point is someone from the Trump admin. Biden &amp; Trump Jr... Biden &amp; Barr.. Surprisingly, 2020 did not decide to go that dystopian.  Sure. I wish I could feel excited, but.. 🤷‍♀️
Biden- Harris!!! So excited!!! #prouddemocrat #BidenHarris2020

Joe Biden is so mf stupid I’m so annoyed
I would never vote for the ticket, but with  selection of  she has more of a chance than anyone has had of legitimately becoming the first female President in U.S. history...until  sweeps in at the 11th hour to replace Biden. #CallingIt
Yes we know Joe Biden has an issue with personal space.
If you had “Biden turns Veepstakes into an episode of Maury” on 2020 bingo, time to check that one off
I really hope Biden chose a WOC - a big mistake if he doesn't.
My daughter’s bike. She’s been waiting for Biden’s historic VP pick announcement before she takes it out of the garage.... Imminent?
Politics by rumor, "some say."  would rather insult, or focus on himself, than wrestle w/real issues impacting real families and businesses: testing, tracing, PPP loans, etc.  All talk, insults, and narcissizing.   Do your job.
When Biden gets elected Republicans are going to suddenly lose their sh*t over the budget deficit.
New Biden campaign shirts. I'll take one.
Hahahaaaaa there's nothing radical about Biden
Medhi, they don't give a fuck.  Everyone should ignore their faux outrage next time they call out Biden for a slip of the tongue.
Another Biden commercial!!
The comments by Pelosi, Biden, Duckworth, et al perfectly encapsulate why the  repeatedly fail nationally. Triangulating may win polls, while losing elections.
"China would prefer Joe Biden." -Crazy Nancy Pelosi  Sounds like a Chinese representative advocating for the interests of the Communist Party.   But, of course they prefer him. He would bend over backwards for them, backstabbing the American people. #Trump2020Landslide
You're not alone. I'm in Montana, have Biden stickers on my cars, and have had more than a few make supporting comments on them. I didn't know you could get Bullock signs. Stay safe! #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica
wait so biden is announcing his vp tomorrow? but what will you all tweet about now??
Thanks for a great stream!  Tonight's show on Biden's last stand, Antifa attacking grandma in Portland and getting beaten in Colorado, an under-reported police shooting in Phoenix, and much more:
Joe Biden tears down himself. He’s a shit human being. I’m done with this bipartisan bs. Wouldn’t it be nice if we were arguing which presidential candidate was the best, rather than fighting over who is worse? What a novel idea!
Let’s keep the momentum even if Biden wins!
Tough call, the animosity is fierce, more than usual.  Yard signs don’t win elections, though they are a cultural signifier.  Wouldn’t do Biden, it makes no difference in Montana.  And riles folks. Bullock needs crossover R votes, it’ll help though marginally. Ask your neighbors
Tonight we're talking Biden's last stand and his unhideable brain rot, Antifa taking on grandmas in Portland and getting beaten in Colorado suburbia, and much more, LIVE at 9 ET!  YouTube:  DLive:
Yesterday Kiki and I went to Walmart just for pickles. A guy walks by us without a mask and yelling: “If you support Biden, you support child sex!” How the fuck did he managed to get into the store without mask? And why is that Walmart security did absolutely nothing?

Biden is a much better person and it’s not even close
#VoteOutRacism Biden made more stricter laws &amp; Increasing the time they spend in time. Might effect those kids too. He also falsely pardoned a kkk member. so let also #VoteHypocritesOut, Like most Democrats, there action r messing up the county, they swore a oath 2 protect, 👇
"We rely on "truth" over facts." -Sleepy Joe Biden
This is a Joe Biden Voter.
The top counterintelligence official in the U.S. government warned Friday of ongoing interference and influence efforts by China, Russia and Iran.
I know you're not serious.  Source:   Bottom line: The less educated you are, the more you support Trump and the right.  How embarrassing for you.Hmm, it's worth considering how it could affect China at least.  Knowing Biden, he could say something before November that pisses me off enough to where he loses my meaningless Montana vote.
The other options are to vote third party or to not vote at all, even if Trump and Biden were equally bad then it wouldn't make a difference which of them you voted for.
In terms of trade specifically, I think Biden is better than Trump.  In regards to China, Bloomberg was honestly better than either of them.
If Biden had picked Susan Rice I was planning to vote for Jo Jorgensen.
If I'm being honest, I think there is some significance to a South Asian American having the VP slot on the ticket.  Also the Iran Deal and the overall opposition to the trade war with China (even if Biden is hostile to China in other ways).  Do you think it matters that much?
I just kept seeing these "Angela Davis supports Biden" posts, after watching the video of her statement it seemed blown out of proportion to me, she criticized him plenty, she just said she was voting for him to get Trump out.  I understand the argument against this, but still.
One problem I have with this argument is it kind of ignores how large a role money plays in elections.  You could say that you're helping Trump if you don't donate all of your disposable income to Biden.
Worst this cancels each other out, but my main concern between them is foreign policy differences.  There have been a few instances where it seems Trump might scale back the hawkishness, but it never seems to materialize.  The Iran Deal and ending trade wars are why I lean Biden.
If you actually listen to what Angela Davis is saying it makes some sense, this whole "Angela Davis supports Biden" thing is being blown out of proportion.
I actually donated $15 to Biden the other day after a right wing Uber driver pissed me off with a rant about how the virus is a hoax to stop Trump from winning.
Honestly I plan to vote for Biden now, mostly because Harris was a better VP pick than some of the other possibilities and it's tipped my opinion in favor of Biden winning.  If his running mate was Klobuchar there is no way I would have voted for it.
Overall agree, although if you don't live in a swing state it doesn't make much difference.  I live in Montana, Trump is super popular in most of the state and there's pretty much zero chance of Biden getting it's three electoral votes.
It's a bit gray for me, I do think Trump is worse if you fully weigh them against each other, but when Biden and Dems try to "out hawk" him I feel like voting third party or have even at times considered Trump winning the preferable option.
Not that it matters much since I live in Montana, but I'm thinking I might vote for Biden at this point.  I didn't vote for Obama either time, voted third party in '08 and write-in for 2012, but still wanted him to beat McCain and Romney, so I understand the sentiment.
If I hear one more cunt try to push the vote third party shite NOW I will fucking lose my mind. A fascist is dismantling our mail service and stealing an election before your fucking eyes and you're going to let him do it. I hope anyone who isnt voting Biden pays that price
If you are referring to the Trump Virus, based on his ineptitude’s, his recent efforts to nix our Postal System long enough to cause perhaps millions of folks to risk their health to vote, the Trump part of his Virus might very well disappear at the poles w Biden’s win.
Let’s see. Doubts about Biden vs trump closing down our postal service, bribing foreign countries, lying &amp; cheating  in order to get re-elected. If we knew all the tricks Stone, Russia, Giuliani, etc have in mind, Obama’s doubts evaporate into thin air.
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden's Running Mate | National Review
I think Biden is going to step aside for medical reasons if he is elected leaving Harris to run the country
“Don’t underestimate Bidens ability to fuck things up“ Obama
People want to believe we can implement national mail in voting in 3 months and Donald Trump will dismantle the post office to stop it. They also think Billie Eilish will make Joe Biden president by singing songs about blowing your dad.
Trump answers a hundred questions per day ...  Biden can't answer ONE??  Is he really alsheimer?
Biden is Booster Gold at best
Biden is a one term president to get us back on track! Do everything you can to get trump OUT!!
This is implying Trump wins 2020?  You would think the question would be for 24 or for 28 if Biden wins.
Voted for Bob Barr in 2008, wished I hadn't after.  Was planning to vote for Jo until Biden picked Kamala.
We mandate that Biden be sent to Gitmo for treason and etc.  shut up Biden you’re me leader material OBVIOUSLY

in Biden’s America you can fuck the sand and sniff it all you want. Only if a new, fresh bunker #MAGA2020
From a Newsweek article last month, the potus is presently laying groundwork (tweets, postal policies, creating China chaos,etc) in order to accuse China of printing vast #’s of mail-in ballots if Biden wins, calling a Nat Emergency in order he stay the potus ( for life ?).
Alert Biden has never been able to mandate anything and he still cant and God willing never will.
While I wear a mask when I am inside with other people, requiring me to wear a mask "outside" when I am distanced is simply virtue signaling. Next command: You will all be Vegans! #mtpol || Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks
Trump also urges Americans to wear masks but opposes a national requirement. Plus: The NFL tries to virus-proof stadiums, and local school officials struggle with reopening difficulties.
'Antifa' website cited in conservative media attack on Biden is linked to — wait for it — Russia!👎😡🤬  “ in the domain name database  shows the site was registered in the Russian Federation from 2013 ...
It started with a tweet from Dr. Jill Biden. “Hey (Douglas Emhoff). Are you ready?” she asked. “Ready to work! Let’s go (Dr. Jill Biden)!” he wrote back. So who is Douglas Emhoff?
Another mouthful of nothing by Mr. Biden.
Hey Stable genius the spaghetti you are throwing against the wall it’s not cooked yet. #BIDEN/HARRIS 2020...#Damn you are scared.
Biden is a status quo US capitalist Imperialist, I don't think the term "fascist" really applies to him.  Also, I didn't want Bernie.
Our country is collapsing right now thanks to you. Biden can run circles around you, plus he can navigate ramps, drink bottled water and read.
This pretty much sums it up!!   If you vote for Biden you hate America!! #Trump2020LandslideVictory 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Biden will not be around long enough to see it.  If he is he’ll be incoherent.
Get caught up with the morning's top headlines, the national weather forecast, today's celebrity birthdays and more.
Yes, real people are dying out here. That’s why we hate your neoliberal picks. Kamala Harris has tortured people like me. Biden has always been ‘tough on crime’ in ways that hurt poor communities and refuses to save lives by allowing access to free healthcare.
And to be clear I'm not saying I accept the premise of a Biden victory being a marginally good thing, but that even if I did it would be a repugnant thing to me to compromise my beliefs to that extent. I simply will not do it. And I can't understand not having things like that.
Except biden is staunchly against medicare for all.
Progressives for Biden are easily the most infuriating people to argue with. Fuck the democratic party, let it crumble apart.
Alternatively you could stop playing their game and actually fight or even just vote for real change. I for one won't compromise my morality by voting for someone as reprehensible as biden and harris.
There are different reasons to vote for a candidate, I don't think it's so simple as to say someone's left card is revoked because they voted Biden.
Biden: you ain’t Black. *conservatives outrage* Biden: I’m selecting Kamala Harris for VP who is Black.  Conservatives: She isn’t Black. 🙄

Weaponizing religion: Trump's attacks on Biden's faith, calling him 'against God'!👎😡🤬  Donald Trump defended questioning the faith of his main political rival, doubling down on calling former Vice President Joe Biden "against God".   Read more:
He is literally the only person to run for President named Joe Biden. Thank you to the Elias sports bureau for that fact
Obama: Hope  Biden: cmon man, this can get better if we really try, or if general conditions improve, now is the time to look at the glass as half full. You know who is full of it? Trump. Full of malarkey.  Harris: kill me please
Yes! More of this please!  Fill up my feed with good soundbites from Biden and Harris
Almost 4 years we have waited for this election. Nearly 4 years of holding on to hope that, americans will wake up and demand real change. settling for Biden and Harris is not real change. idk how much hope there is to hold on to anymore.
Maya Rudolph, portrayer of Kamala Harris on "SNL," admits she could be busy ahead of the election after Harris was announced as Joe Biden's running mate.
I hope that berreta is a revolver, otherwise according to Biden's gun control plans, it will cost you $200 a year in taxes just to keep it. If it holds more than 10 rounds, you'll also pay $300 a year for each magazine that you own. I'm sure that you'll just turn it in though
I can tell you Joe Biden hates Kamala’s guts. You will see it on stage.
You're right!!! It doesn't matter if Joe "you ain't black" Biden is a racist, at least he isn't named Trump.
Joe "you ain't black" Biden will fix all of the country's problems. The 40+ years in politics just hasn't been enough time for him to achieve it yet
I know you don't want us to see how bad it is for your guy Biden. It's easy to see through your malarkey.
But you are against the community if you support Biden and Harris. I say this as someone in the community.
You're still on that? Biden put forth civil forfeiture, legally allowing cops to steal from people. He was pro-segregation. He pushed for harsher treatment of drug users. Yes, Orange Man is indeed bad. So is Biden. I refuse to pick any evil.
Her and Joe "you ain't black" Biden are totally going to win
It's not. You can't seriously believe that, right? We're leftists. We hate Trump as well as Biden and Harris. Because neoliberal capitalism is destroying the world and they all uphold it.
Biden and his son
Lol, Right? I just listened to my boss the other day give me a whole speech on how fucking Biden is a "radical leftist" as I struggled to keep a straight face.
There's no way that Joe "you ain't black" Biden is racist.
We will take your guns so you can't shoot Biden for sniffing your child.
Biden's game in picking Harris was to prove that he isn't actually a leftist to gain centrist voters. Yet, Trump still calls Biden and Harris radical leftists. Trump is literally doing Biden's bidding for him, if I hear about their leftist healthcare plan I might just get excited

Kamala "you don't have the right to own a gun" Harris is just as bad for the constitution as you tried to be, and Joe "you ain't black" Biden is just as bad.
That's right!!! Joe "you ain't black" Biden will save the world
A group seeking to place rapper Kanye West's name on the Montana's presidential ballot this fall has spent the past few days gathering signatures from Yellowstone County residents, telling them their signature could help take votes away from Joe Biden.
Biden will just veto it, like he promised.
Dude, Biden already said nothing will change. Believe him.
The problem you have is that the more the voters see of Biden and Harris the more they will see 2 normal, rational, very smart and likeable people. People will quickly see through your unhinged narrative for what it is: lies, lies, and more lies.
No one is. Even Biden didn't out-debate Kamala. Let's be honest.

This link just redirects to the main Biden site now?
I might vote for Biden/Harris, I'm not sure yet.  I live in Montana and my Presidential vote doesn't matter much anyway. The Libertarian Party candidate has decent foreign policy views, but I already donated $40 to her campaign, which probably amounts to more than a vote for her.
And Joe "you ain't black" Biden will continue the great legacy of LBJ
Deep breath everybody!!! . No candidate was going to make everyone happy. If we stick together we can win in November.  And Biden/Harris is infinitely better than Trump/Pence
#KamalaHarris  was supported by less them 5% of the Democratic Party for President and #Biden picks her as his VP. That kind of decision making does not instill a lot of confidence or speak very highly of his cognitive abilities.
I think that Joe "can I smell your daughter" Biden made the right decision with Kamala "you don't have the right to own a gun" Harris.
Here's the thing. The way American government is set up, we don't really have the option to vote for good or bad. We have the option to vote for sucks and sucks less. Biden/Harris is the "sucks less" option we have. Stop being petulant children and let's get this thing won.
On Nov. 3, America gets Her house back that trump has held hostage ... Team Biden/Harris
Kamala is the son Joe Biden always wanted Hunter to be.
Just heard cnn say Kamala is family to Joe, and family is important to the Biden’s.”  Really...They’re going with that talking point, but if fam is important to #HidenBiden then, #WheresHunter ?
Being anti-Biden and pro-trump are totally different things. It's ok to think Trump is an asshat, but also believe that voting for Biden is a very bad idea.
are we sure Biden isn't literally deaf at this point
The debates are so overhyped. A debate hasn’t fundamentally changed the race since 76 and whose mind will it really change. Biden also proved that he can hold his own and trump really is not a good debater
It took two drafts to get Biden to call Harris a servant instead of "the help"
Great strategy. People like you are the biggest threat to Biden winning. Push away the leftists and you lose, that's what happened in 2016 and it will happen again and again until you learn.
Ya know, I wad never going to vote Biden. It was simply never going to happen, but this? This makes me so much more sure in that stance.
Look mate I'm voting Biden, but I'm not going to make things up. Liberals are not progressives. If you are progressive, you are not liberal.
I wanna see  in Biden’s cabinet 🤷🏾‍♂️
Hah, Biden picked the cop, I shouldn't be surprised he's no different to the back the blue shitheads.

In 2008 Obama used a Greeco-Roman motif to impose gravitas. In 2020 Biden will use one because it reminds him of his childhood.  Because he is old
Ugh. If 42 percent of MY supporters couldn't commit to voting for Biden over Trump, it might cause me to choose humility and introspection.
"Old doddering men" is clearly the theme of this election.
Biden’s VP pic is critical to advance to the presidency in 2024 or 2028 - I have no concern with Biden’s age.
How come the exes of male politicians don't write op eds on what the candidate should or should not do.  Just yuck.   Kamala Harris’ ex suggests she ‘politely decline’ if asked to be Biden’s VP
Three of Wyoming’s top elected officials are calling for presidential candidate Joe Biden and current President Donald Trump to hold a debate in Wyoming.
Joe Biden better stay away from Mexico
Biden is going to rip Trump apart at the debate. I just can't wait!!
I say that all the time. But it's for stupid people, not for what Biden says when they call him on the carpet.
Here's the deal...we have binary elections in this country no matter how many candidates are in the mix. You don't like Biden, fine. Whoever else you vote for is a vote for Trump. You can go pout in a corner about it, but that's the way it is.
I will vote Biden even if he picks my dog, Buck for VP.
So Stelter is extremely offended by the “negative partisanship” from the right that Biden is “falling apart” but the left including elected officials calling Trump and his supporters Nazis for 4 years? I don’t remember Seltzer’s show calling out that negative partisanship.
That'd be great, but unfortunately her politics are closer to that of Bernie Sanders so even if she was American, she wouldn't have a chance at getting Biden's pick.
Biden has dementia and is a pedophile. Honestly can’t believe that’s who the Dems picked. I mean if it were Tulsi or Kamala I’d be worried but this will be straight entertainment
Trumps a stable genius. Biden is a kid sniffer.
I absolutely would adore a Trump Biden debate. It would be even more of a schlonging than he gave HRC. ‘Because you’d be in jail’ comment might make a comeback.
Really and in the same week that Biden said black people aren’t diverse? What’s funnier is I bet you didn’t even know Biden said that which proves the fragile bubble your thoughts circle in.
You are a lost soul if you think Biden would even stand against Trump in a debate. Why do the Dems want to cancel the debates then? Biden can’t even remember what state he is in.
1. Who cares so he can ride a bike if this is actually Biden, why the mask? 2. This was tweeted by one the the Krass brothers who have been kicked off of Twitter permanently. 3. Why would a wife not identify her actual husband?

If elected, will Joe Biden still be unable to travel? How can he do his job?
Well she's not that dumb, but she is planning on being VP if Biden wins. Whoever is picked as Biden's running mate is deep states pick for POTUS.
Based off Biden’s Hispanic comments lately, I would not be surprised if he picks someone like Veronica escobar to try and flip Texas
He would if he knew for sure it would be a net drain on Biden, but that's not assured with you.
Joe Biden will be really excited to find out who he selected.
I think that sentiment was more popular in 2016, a lot of anti-Trump people including myself did not think he had a serious shot at the Presidency. Whereas there was more liberal and left wing support for third parties then, now it's more "Never Trump" Republican support of Biden
The issue would be getting voters at large to think that.  Agree Biden is bad, but the majority of Democratic primary voters apparently thought otherwise.

Oh an Biden hates the Bible and hates god. But Trump carries a bible wherever he goes. But when asked what his favorite passage was, he could only answer with” oh that’s very personal to me, so I can’t talk about it”. What a total ASSBAG!!!
Nope not you at all. See I thought it was just me lol. He’s getting redder and redder each time he speaks. Cuz he knows all his bullshit about Biden ISNT working. “Biden doesn’t believe in the Bible , Biden hates God”. Does he really think we believe this shit.

Bubba,  your bravery has defined how I will pursue my Presidency after Biden goes missing in the woods.
Joe Biden for president
Yeah, I don't know if she was up there among my favorites in the primary (I was hoping for that Warren/Castro ticket), but I certainly liked her a lot better than Biden himself, so I'm looking forward to her kicking ass during all this. Fingers crossed and knock wood, etc.
Biden been hiding ?
Why do tRump supporters continue to support the myth that “Joe Biden doesn’t know where he is half the time”? Oh,I know!✋🏻it’s because their M.O. is to project their “God’s” faults onto others. So you can be sure if they’re pointing a finger at Biden, 3 are pointing back  them.
What a racist statement.  Blacks have done a lot for Biden, but, Biden hasn’t done anything for the blacks in 40 years. Maxine Waters: Biden ‘can’t go home without a Black woman being VP’
