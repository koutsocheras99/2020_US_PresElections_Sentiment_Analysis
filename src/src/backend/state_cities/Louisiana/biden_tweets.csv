“Russia once again is interfering”   WELL HUNTER BIDEN
I also realized that most of trump’s supporters to do not follow him on Twitter. This makes a lot of sense to me. It is impossible for a sane person to follow him and still think he is fit to be president. Same for Biden.
Is This Biden's Running Mate? Susan Rice Dumps Netflix Stock
If Trump has a press conference, and his only word is “Up.”, Biden will say, “If I’m elected president, down.” because his whole platform is getting Trump out of office.
And please tell me what the president has done to hurt black Americans. He’s had 3 years in office, Biden has had 40. I promise you, Biden has don far more damage.
You really believe that if Biden did opposite, that people would have just gone along with it? You believe Biden would have not lost as many people under his watch? You must not understand how viruses, or people, operate.
You believe he does all that because he told you he does it. Biden has voted in the past in a way that hurt black Americans. Now we expect him to change because he said he would? I don’t buy it. Let’s just reset the government. It’s badly needed.
Please tell me what Joe Biden could have done to lower those numbers. It’s a virus. People would still have acted the way they are now. People would die no matter who is in office. To blame one man for that is asinine.
But he did say that, so we just gonna ignore it now? Let’s call both candidates on ALL their bs, not play favoritism. Biden caught proper heat for that comment. It’s going to come back up, trust me.
It seems to me that the left doesn’t want to win this, or they are trying to force their real pick through. Biden’s platform is “We need to get Trump out of office.” There were many better candidates than Biden available but the left got their guy 🤷🏻‍♂️
I’ll echo what a lot of people are thinking. Biden has had decades in Congress, and now all of a sudden “I’m going to do this and that if I’m elected.” Not to mention he is almost 80. We need to re-evaluate all of Congress and the White House, the status quo isn’t working...
It was marginally tolerable when Biden was attempting to cosplay even giving a damn about overtures to the Left 2 months ago.  But now, when Biden is now officially to the Right of even Reagan on most issues?  "Most progressive candidate ever"???  You sure Biden's the senile one?
Joe Biden is a fool. In way over his head. Hillary and now Joe? What’s up w Dems?
It all goes back to Bernie Sanders surrendering all of his momentum and stabbing his "revolution" in the back just to gain some clout with his old friends Biden and Schumer.  If he had gone Indy Left &amp; aggressively fought for #PeoplesStimulus, things would be radically different.
Your just blatantly Support Joe Biden racist comments by ignoring it. I can understand maybe one comment but he does it all the time. By ignoring it you embolden The DemocRATS to be racist with no consequences from you. So your just as guilty as saying it yourself.
No. Your mom’s basement creepy secret agent “q”. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂. Get ready, Biden’s gonna be you and your mom’s President. You can be Trump’s pen pal, and maybe even get to meet his friend big Bubba. You and your mom can have conjugal visits.
Biden cares about Black votes.  Trump cares about Black people.
Dr Dooley, as a Bernie Sanders supporter, do you feel that Senator Sanders &amp; Joe Biden more closely align with regards to their political positions, or do you feel that Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders are more on the same page?
Biden Claims That ‘Unlike’ The Black Community, ‘The Latino Community … Is Incredibly Diverse’ - The Daily Caller
Supporting abortion, sodomite marriage, which he officiated, automatically excommunicates Biden from the Church. See canon 915.  For those who disagree you don’t have the foggiest about Catholicism, and should just stop making foolish remarks about an apostate
And he claims to be Catholic! What a crock! He supports abortions &amp; same sex marriage - not only strongly anti-Catholic but also anti-Christian. 'Joe Biden Has Said Nothing’: CatholicVote Demands Biden Condemn Anti-Catholic Attacks  via
This is exactly what we're up against. He needs to resign, or be recalled.
Biden THIS WEEK: “"... unlike the African American community with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things.”
And here I’m thinking that you would vote for Biden if he picked Rice instead of Harris.  🤷🏻‍♂️. Sometimes I honestly don’t think you get yourself.
and....Joe Biden still is racist towards black radio/talk show host
LoL. Just like you/yall and Democrats.  They got yall burning  businesses, hurt in elderly, spitting and throwing piss and shit at cops, siding with communists, lying and openly makin shit up on social media and Biden/Pelosi  hv total yrs in govtis 84 yrs.
There’s actual lawsuits against trump. Show me any court cases or people coming out saying Biden is a pedophile and molested them.
Show me any credible evidence of Biden being a pedophile. I’ll show you all the credible words from trump himself he’s actually a terrible person.
No HE makes it worse on himself.
wow has he talked to God: “you know, I’ve worked on fighting abortion and so you got a big win there . I need some help on Biden though. Maybe a health problem. He’s not good for you. God needs a winner. Biden will hurt you and that book you wrote. Like nothing you’ve ever seen.”
August 6 #TrumpLies the agnostic materialist atheist said a Biden President "would hurt the Bible and God".  Donald keeps underlining that he is a substantive babbler and his errors make Joe seem like the good old gentlemen sometimes garbling but always caring #EmpathyIsComing
but he keeps denying as nobody has opened smoothly. College Football is delaying, Major League Baseball is spotty, and only the NBA seems to be running a schedule.  Predictions of 300,000 dead before inauguration makes for an unbelievable Trump swearing in.  Biden's lead holds
I talk to all the black people Sandeee. They vote for Biden.
#BREAKING: Man who insults African Americans nearly every day criticizes Biden for insulting African Americans... once.
Only a fool would vote for Biden after him continuously showing you how he feel about you for the past 40yrs
He’s right!! I mean, can Joe Biden say “Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV”??!!
being a devout Catholic means you actually believe and hold true all of what the Church of Jesus Christ teaches. The list of the dogmas of the faith that Biden doesn't hold or believe is too long for twitter.  He is an apostate and has been excommunicated see Canon law 915
Should be asking Joe Biden this question.
So are you saying all African Americans are the same? I’ve been to Africa hell no their not the same, so are you saying if your black your an African American, no that’s damn stupid.  Must be Biden thing
Fake News Interference 🥵
Let’s get this clear, I won’t be happy about voting for Joe Biden. But I shall be celebrating that I didn’t vote Donald Trump! 🥳 🎉
After all first Biden will determine if your Black enough to be Black and since they all be the same he can then ignore their diversity. Do you see what a damn RACIST he actually is yet???
I’m still voting Biden cause fuck Trump.
Imagine thinking Biden is the radical left
You won’t see Biden supporters waving flags and cheering for freedom on America Streets..🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Your boyfriend is going down! Biden 2020. Trump prison 2021. Those financials will me made public re: US Supreme Court. Keep drinking the rancid covid koolaid.
The more this goes on, the more it seems likely that Jill Biden will be the surprise candidate.  She's has a Doctorate and has never stopped working.  And she's the one holding him up and speaking for him.
Biden was a deckhand on Noah’s ark
“John McCain was friends with Joe Biden for 40 years. They worked together even when they disagreed. Biden eulogized McCain.   Trump repeatedly insulted him. “
Michelle’s depression is brought on by FEAR, not from COVID19, instead, it’s the thought that she and Hussein could see jail time. The facts are damning and prove directly that he and Biden knew of the Russia Collusion HOAX and participated.
At WH today #TrumpLies , who suggested disinfectant for injecting “into the body” and wonders if a nuclear weapon could stop a hurricane, and said in March “15 people have the virus so it’s going to be over soon” is trying to say Biden makes mid-statements! 😂😂😂

Joe Biden has more Godly in his pinky than you have in your whole body!! He’s caring, loving of and to others, empathetic, intelligent, unlike you Hateful, Pathetic and just down right Dumb ....
I don’t know, but if Joe Biden could hurt God, I’d be pretty careful about getting on his bad side. Just sayin’, Donnie.
Joe Biden such a joke 😂

You mean doom America to becoming a socialist 💩hole. Look at all the riots going on that will be nationwide if Joe Biden is elected. A literal second civil war.
Both Joe Biden and Donald Trump have the same weakness: Their mouth.   All they needed to do was shut up.
Lock and load this is what America will look like soon if we don’t get control of the shit going on in our nation. Don’t think so? Look at what they did to general Flynn can you imagine what they do the rest of us unfettered if Biden wins? Far fetched? No it isn’t
Waiting on the results of Joe Biden's  cognitive test is more like it. We all know he isn't fit for office hell wasn't fit to be VP .
Joe Biden has the IQ of a duck fart   🦆 💨
You are a monster voting for biden to get nuclear codes
Joe Biden is a Reagan/Trumpster Democrat.  You can have him, Democrats.
Donald Trump is willing to sacrifice Kanye West to remain President. This Presidential campaignby Kanye will further damage his mental wellbeing and help siphon voters away from Biden. The only person who wins in this scenario is Trump.

I swear Biden reminds me of Si from Duck Dynasty. But not as cool
You also thought that Hillary would be president today. Trump is going to win in a landslide. Biden is a shell of a man and has no appeal whatsoever and he hasn't even announced who his VP pick that will chase away supporters. See you sky-screaming again in 90 days or so
The list is way to long. How about ole Joe Biden. He’s a real go getter.
No, that would be Biden’s campaign! TRUMP 2020🇺🇸
Why is it his fault! That’s ridiculous, no one could have done a better job, especially Biden! Go back and see how many people died of H1N1 under Obama/Biden!
You were a better candidate than Biden and you got smoked. Just sayin’
Biden is on a CNS depressant, or it’s a side effect of some medication he’s taking. Notice the slurred speech
Thinking about debates between the two reminded me of when my 14-yo was matched against a 6-yo phenom in junior tennis years ago. The 14-yo can’t win - either beats or loses to a little kid. I’m just not sure who’s the teenager and who’s the 6-yo between Trump and Biden 😂.
Trump did something nice for Joe Biden...

OK....just because Sanders caucuses with the Democrats and has backed Biden, doesn't mean that he's not still a registered Independent. Why is he listed here as a Democrat?
Right....in the same way that getting wacked by the weak side of a Cat 5 hurricane eyewall instead of the stronger quadrant is "surviving"  the storm.  Nope, Biden is still a right-wing Democrat.
Wrong.  Electoral College votes are determined by states, who appoint their EC voters by virtue of Congressional district vote, not by counties.  Also...don't most national polls also have Biden up big nationally?
Have they created a Biden deepfake for the Presidential debates yet? No way he gets on stage with Trump, they’d have to inject amphetamines and cocaine into him before the debates #HighDoses
I posted the collage of Joe Biden w/ kids on FB &amp; had someone tell me that I am disgusting for suggesting he’s a pedophile w/o having evidence. 🙄😒

Okay, first, list how the US has been destroyed by Trump and Oence? And please, don’t say ignorant things like the virus and division. We all have seen that came from the Chinese, Obama/Biden and the left wing of the democrats.
Why Trump doesn't deserve a Biden debate  by
Joe Biden is a Facist and obviously do are you!
I would think it’s more like he AND Biden are elected. That way, he stays in office.
Sorry blame China but your a China Biden troll so probably not Pal
They still can. Biden is Dead weight too..👻
Biden... the weakest, most pathetic excuse for a Presidential Candidate in history!!! Can't wait to see what idiots vote for this joke of a candidate!  I guess if u vote for Joe... u must want his weak ass VP to be the leader of the free world! 👎🏻SAP

Girl I’m a combat vet, none of that is true. My daughter is an Air Force OSI, none of that is true. I’m an NRA member none of that is true. Biden want to do away with oil, tax EVERONE AT 75-90 percent. He says just rich there’s not enough money for the 93 trillion he plans on
And there is no way I can vote for Biden, because it’s not Biden it’s AOC and Bernie. Joe Biden is not there and they will destroy the US and turn it into Russia Bernie is a communist and was married in the CCCP
Then I guess we will see when the indictments start coming in I know the list of Democrats will be impressive including Bill Clinton, Joe Biden, Schiff, and from what I’ve seen at minimum 38 others. If the are Republicans on the list let them fall as well, se I don’t care who!
if Biden wins this election, this world is about to go to shit &amp; the economy will be done!!

We need to dissolve political parties all together so idiots like Joe Biden don't ever end up in government again.
Correct we can't let dementia Joe Biden have a single vote. we don't want the DNC to hand pick a VP that would become president a month after the election.
If Biden wins this fall I sincerely hope he continues to fund NASA in they way It has been funded these last 4 years &amp; I also hope he keeps Jim Bridenstine in charge. This guy is just phenomenal. What an awesome time we are in for space travel &amp; I hope we can’t keep it going.

both trump and biden show pedophilic and racist tendencies so voting for either of them is an affront to everyone affected by pedophilia and racism. you cannot do it with a clear conscience
Maybe on Joe Biden's islands next door .
While that moment, was nothing short of amazing and historic ... this Nov, with soooo much at stake, a Biden win will be a win for America and historic in its own way.
I hope you are on the very short list for VP! Like Biden-Harris 2020🙏
Go figure that! The left kept telling us that Chi-Na is our freind and Biden said “they’re not Bad folks, Folks”..👻🤔
maybe and Joe Biden's sub on the neighboring island.

I am not voting for that psycho either the fact that you think you have only two choices shows how brainwashed was YOU actually are trump is a failure our bubble economy and collapsing dollar prove that. And Biden will not help. Time to break the two parties up
Why do I need to explain anything about Joe Biden I didn’t vote for him and I won’t vote for him
What about that plane that went down around Poland that was carrying Russian generals that could also tie into Biden's bribery scheme.

Because you won't be president . DNC would replace you with the VP they picked for you and the VP they picked for that person. Just say it Nancy Pelosi is Joe Biden's VP pick.

Only Democrats would wail about "But, think of the SCOTUS! Kavanaugh! Gorsuch!", forgetting that Biden enabled Clarence Thomas by attacking Anita Hill and voted in Antonin Scalia; and that Obama SCOTUS appointees RBG &amp; Breyer have ruled with the Right on several key decisions.
Only Democrats expect us to scream loud about Trumpster and "Latinx kids in cages" while conveniently ignoring that the system of border camp prisons was established by "Black Progressive" Barack Obama, defended heartily by Bill and Hillary Clinton, and reinforced by Joe Biden.
Joe Biden  all pictures really except for the bottom left.
A debunked convo . However secret service couldn't  assign women to Joe Biden's detail because he would grope them or walk around the VP house when Jill wasn't around.
So you support losing your rights and freedom as well as nearly all your money  to socialism then communism then dictatorship? Because that's what will happen if Joe Biden would be elected then replaced  because of his condition with whoever the DNC picks as his VP .
No y'all lie and say Joe Biden is fit for office when clearly he wasn't even fit to be VP  in the last administration. And he is a pedophile sexual predator.

Normal DemocRATS candidate start to lean to the Center left but not Joe Biden he wants to be the most progressive president in history. That's not going to sell well to middle America or better known as fly over Country.
Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden got some kinda pack going on. That's why Joe pick up a lot of Bernie positions and policy the Far Left agenda.
He doesn't . But Congress and the senate do. Ask Nancy Pelosi about her credit card fiasco or Joe Biden about Ukraine which he has criminal charges pending there .
Biden,”if you don’t for me u ain’t black.”
Assuming that other races cannot live in the suburbs is racist. Vote Trump, even if u don’t you’re still black (play on words of what Biden said😂) also he has brought more jobs to multiple ethnic groups than any recent president. All the violence in the US is caused by liberals.
He did that Bc they didn’t the pay for it, like how y’all look at stuff he did a long time ago, but you’ll ignore the fact that Joe Biden signed for incarceration rate of blacks being raised.

The Democrats and MSM have no choice but to deflect blame from Biden and to protect him from himself  What other choice do that have?! Joe is IT All they can do now is keep the race as Trump vs Trump and hope the American ppl don’t notice how bankrupt the their  Party is
Wait... I thought Trump just said that Biden is anti-religion, anti-church and anti-God. Are you saying that he… LIED??!!
Do you think Biden can harm GOD ?  Desperately screaming the sky is falling is for Chicken Little not a POTUS. With every crazy accusation you popularity slips a bit . You're down to 37%  to 48% vs Biden . By election day it will be 35% to 50% .
Biden cannot remember his name or say one coherent sentence. How will he protect us.  I used to be Hillary supporter but independent now. Cannot recognize democratic party anymore

Team Obama=Team Biden=Team who gets  out of office.  It really doesn't matter what the name is..does it?  As long as we get the same result!
Biden shouldn't debate period and only if Trump releases his tax returns
Yep. They centered their entire personality and identity around a politician (gee, where have we seen that before?) so they cant handle that Biden won out, and so he's enemy #1. It doesnt matter what Trump does, because Biden is "literally the same and will do the same stuff".
Biden stop spreading your lies. Trump is the first president that has been fair across the board and this is from the middle class. You and Obama did nothing but made my life more expensive because of your Obamacare policy.

According to official Catholic doctrine, Biden should not be allowed access to the sacraments (e.g. Communion) given his active promotion of abortion. 60 years ago he would have been excommunicated by now.
Like videos of Biden speaking? Russia needs do nothing. Just let the cameras keep rolling Every time Biden speaks
It’s Perfect. She’s the only one who can make Biden’s foreign policy instincts looks smart.  Plus, since foreign policy is supposed to be one of his strong suits, but he’s having so much trouble expressing himself lately, he needs a VP pick to bolster his foreign policy message.
Like the tough questions they ask Biden,  are you wearing blue socks or black socks?
Yep, China owns Biden. Of course they want him to win.

so black people are now going to rush to vote for this #fakepresident because Biden made a mistake? #gtfoh, NO #BunkerBoy wants to get just enough of the black vote to eke out a win
President Biden! He&amp;President Obama brought us back after the Great Recession, so their track record is stellar. Ttump took over a continuously climbing economy and did fine...until he decided to LIE to us about...well, everything. But about this pandemic! Blood on his hands!!
How tha heck can she support joe Biden for president of America. Shows just how shitty of a mayor she is.
To hear them talk, they remind me of Biden. Watters' show used to amaze me when he would ask college aged people questions they should know the answer to...yet so many had no clue.🤪
Biden didn’t mention political parties in that statement. He said, “incredibly different attitudes about different things.” He’s saying black people tend to think alike. There is no truth in that.
Joe Biden reminds me of racist Democrats from my youth. Ooops, he IS one of the racist Democrats from my youth! He's not even trying to hide his racism anymore. We can't afford to hide our opposition!
I think maybe you're right. I'm not sure that anyone who would be voting for Biden might now vote for Kanye. Still, it would be better to just have him not be a part of the election altogether in order to eliminate as many bad outcomes as possible.
You mean pedophile biden
#VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare Whoever Biden picks will be be the best vetted candidate since Obama vetted Biden. To not vote for him based on his VP pick, is, in essence voting for the OrangeShitGibbon!
Seems the goal of the Trump team in hilighting these is to make it seem Biden isn’t really on the side of Black Americans. No way they vote for trump in large numbers, but maybe they don’t turn out. You are in trouble if this is your election strategy.
In order to justify Biden’s comments people are saying, “black people are too far removed from where they came from to be as diverse as Latinos.” Wtf does that even mean?
I find it amusing that Republican pundits think most Americans care about Biden's gaffes. If the choice is between Evil and a Gaffer, it's an easy decision.  Vote for the Gaffer: It's Important.
Joe Biden is the plantation owner who claims he not racist because he treats his slaves well.
donald trump really don't got no room to talk bout racism 😭😭 we gon get to u once we done w dis nigga biden, wait ya turn
Biden would struggle to keep from laughing at Donnie during a debate!! 🤣
Joe Biden is like the plantation owner who says he not racist because he treats his slaves well.
Not voting is a vote for Trump which is why the GOP has historically fought to suppress people’s right to vote. Biden could select Barney the dinosaur as his VP and I’d still vote for him over 4 more years of Trump destroying America.
Biden is literally a messiah compared with Trump, who is clearly the antichrist. Biden is here to save the world, he saved the country with Obama after the last republican idiot almost destroyed it...
This is your liberal demonic rat cities future with Biden and his pick of a Presidential WOC.
Hopefully the trial will happen next year, though I doubt Biden will do things that much differently.
If a person rides with Biden, another person brings up the crime bill, Biden supporter has an excuse rather than saying “I’m black and I know about the crime bill and I’m still gonna vote Biden.” Same goes the other way, what’s hard about being honest?
Not as a candidate but if you have evidence I am open to it. He never had a plan for HBCUs unlike Clinton. Even now he has no plan. Biden does.
Probably not quite as much, because Biden is a man, but yeah
We can criticize Biden AND still support him. We're not a damn cult. And no one is saying he can't win the election because of his gaffes. FFS.
please get me some wheat grass shots i have so many farts to push out on anyone who isnt voting for biden
(I was being very much sarcastic and making fun of the contradictory Trump-GOP fake attacks on Biden 😬, I agree w you 💯 %)
After reading the New Jim Crow, if you thought there was any chance I was voting for Biden, you are sadly mistaken.
The mayor's statement read in part:  "More than ever before, we need a steady partner in the White House who can relate to our experiences. I know for a fact that Joe Biden is that person."
Fair enough. I’ll vote for who i want for president since I’m there. I’ll write in a vote. Still not voting for Trump or Biden.
Joe desperately wanting to work for the sinking ship that is the Trump campaign.   Btw, you only take the DEMENTIA TEST IF PEOPLE AROUND YOU THINK YOU SUFFER FROM IT.   Each time Trump or his toadies point out that Biden hasn’t needed to take it, just magnify why Trump did.
Looking forward to seeing Biden at the next Pro-Life rally. I won't hold my breath.
Joe Biden can hurt God? Maybe that’s what we need in a president instead of the current guy who is afraid of stairs (and ramps) and can only put a hurt on a McDonald’s no.1 meal.
You, Joe Biden, is the one ignoring the advice of heath care professionals!  Go and have a test for diminishing mental capacity.  You obviously have some dementia issue going on!  VOTE DONALD TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT 2020! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
I really need to know what in the hell Kap accomplished by not voting?  I also guarantee that Biden has met with and will continue to meet with whatever candidate you wanted to win to make sure this country is better off than before.
Gonna start a political comedy band called Joe Biden and His Clarifying Comments
As long as Biden gets rid of Hope (Hicks) and all of Trump’s other evil minions, that is all we need as a country.
More like Team Tapioca! Biden will not be the democrap nominee, watch and see.
But why/how are the polls showing Biden ahead? It can’t be legit! I don’t see how any sane person would vote for him!
I seriously doubt Joe Biden could get rid of 1031 Exchanges, but if you watch this video you can clearly see why he should.
Lol. The people you think might be offended by this will still vote for Biden. And they definitely knew all these statistics and have probably watched The 13th on Netflix, so this isn’t news
WAKE UP DEMACRATS!! The far left has taken over your party!! Biden is and will be a puppet for these extremists!!!! We MUST STAND TOGETHER AND VOTE FOR TRUMP TO SAVE THE COUNTRY! He may not be the prez you want but he is the prez we NEED right now!!
omg it was GREAT!!!
If you saying "grab them by the pussy" didn't lose women or you saying you "like people that don't get caught" cause you to lose vets, he'll be ok. Don't let Joe Biden distract you from the fact we're voting Joe Biden
Joe Biden was an enabler. This system existed long before him.

Biden's Attempt To Explain Statement About Black Americans Lacking 'Diversity' Leaves More Questions Than Answers
I’m convinced Joe Biden actually wants us to vote for Trump..
Fuck Joe Biden!
but then again Biden ain’t no better.
He will still get it. Even though the proof is there that you did more for the black community than any other president, they will still vote Democrat. CNN &amp; MSNBC has them mind fucked. They actually believe that you a racist. Joe Biden can say the “N” word &amp; still get the votes.
Can we expect  of New Orleans to pass a resolution in support of Biden next?
The level of ignorance of Biden supporters never ceases to amaze me.
I choked on my coffee.   And then I started thinking about mapping candidates to FF characters. Trump's obvious. But Biden... Maybe Strago? Tellah? Kanye is Ultros, don't  me.
According to Trump, Joe Biden is both “weak” and “sleepy” and possesses unlimited super powers that can “hurt god”.
Yeah, ummm ya know.. because uuuuhhh that thing. Just umm know ya know that only Joe Biden can beat Joe Biden in November.
Oh but in the eyes of the MAGA’S their king can do no wrong.  With the daily bumfuzzles we bear, they point their fingers elsewhere.  The rhyme was unintentional, but hey... it worked.
Yeah!!! Good one!!!
Shoot. I fell asleep before the end. I didn’t realize he had such a sense of humor!!!  Bravo Brian!!!
Let’s not get too cocky. Many liberals won’t vote Biden, media favors Trump no matter what they say bc of “record ratings, and he’s got corruption on his side. I have seen this before. Even if he loses he won’t leave without a fight. Scary and sad. We have work to do.
Biden is no match for a hyper loud fat guy.
Checked Twitter this morning to find a lot of white liberals dismissing Biden’s offensive comments towards my Black community. I’m not even surprised. #BLEXIT #WalkAway
The MSM motto these days   ‘All the news and fact checked   facts fit to help Joe Biden’ That our side still wins elections  In this corrupted media environment is a testament to how much the Democrats suck
Evety American On 11/3/2020 Ask What  He's Done For The  American Worker? Before You Vote Look Up Corrupt Pay For Play Joe Biden's Record Of Selling Out America &amp; Screwing American  Workers💯 VOTE RED SAVE JOBS🙏
The hilarious thing about Kanye  being on some ballots is that when included in polls of those areas, actually stole way more votes from Trump than Biden. We're talking noticeable percentage points worth. So let the clown have his fun I guess
“I didn’t mean it when I said Blacks are all alike but Latinos aren’t.”  Would that apology make it all better if a Republican had said it?  Joe Biden clarifies comments comparing diversity in Latino and Black communities
All my Tweets on Biden coming back unserved
Yeah -but I think Clybourn legitimately fucked black America with his Biden endorsement. I can only speak from my own man on the street perspective-but doorknocking for Bernie in predominantly black downtown Richmond-many just following Clybourn‘s lead.
Biden skin is thin.. he will literally grab you and attack you verbally at the drop of a hat.. it might be the dementia
Ted Cruz is now demanding Joe Biden wrestle God.
Biden sure can pick em.
Manchin counters Obama on eliminating filibuster: 'I will do everything I can to prevent it'..this is how you know what Obama and Biden are up to. Get rid of the filibuster then only the extremes will rule..no bi partisanship will be the end of democracy as We know it. #Trump2020
Does anyone believe Biden will be in for the full 4 year term? Is it clear to everyone that he is just a pry-bar to ultimately get a more progressive candidate (specifically whomever he chooses as VP) in the Oval Office? Didn’t Biden himself indicate he will only do 1 term?
Chinese WeChat users fear being cut off from US friends - Breitbart    Tragedy Because Many Of Our Past President's &amp;  Joe Biden Have Been In Bed With China Anyone Could Be A Spy/Traitor How The Hell Would You Know With Fake Media! KAG2020💯
Nah you have to vote and you know that.  One thing we know is that Biden will put a hell of a staff around him who will run this country much more effectively and efficiently.  You owe that to your ancestors who died trying to give you that right, boss.
What are his policies? You are not voting for BIDEN you will be voting for his Vice President.. Patriots care about the Marxist terrorist organization.
“I want to vote for Biden but not on a Tuesday“.   “I want to vote for Biden but not if he’s got a black running mate“.   “I want to vote for Biden but not if he looks like he might win“.   Is this cognitive dissonance or what?
Biden acts like he can take black people for granted because like DNC he believes they are wholly owned subsidiaries of DNC and they must vote democrat because they are totally dependent on government.
Yeah, right  that’s why is’t so easy to find thousands of photos of him at church or with religious figures.
Didn't Obama AND Biden tell the world who these guys were? 😡
BIDEN SEEKS TO CONVERT FLORIDA'S LATINOS  A wise strategic objective. However, Joe was thinking like a White person of the past who view our nation ethnically. Biden's wiser approach would have been to use overtures that infer inclusion, without alienating loyal Black Americans.
JOE BIDEN IS MY CANDIDATE but Joe Biden thinks White.  This is the 40th Anniversary of Castro letting those who wanted to leave for the U.S. to do so. Castro check-mated the U.S. open door policy to Cubans by emptying his jails and insane asylums.
Anyone who has had a family member with dementia readily recognizes Joe Biden's dementia symptoms and that he is degrading rapidly. What are democrats thinking by knowingly nominating a man stricken with dementia for President?
And so is Joe Biden.  Welcome to 2020
All indications are that Joe Biden's dementia is progressing at an exponential rate and it's doubtful his handlers can continue to coverup his debilitation much longer.
Biden needs to be attacked.
Despite the fact there was never proof, they’ve been accusing Trump of racism since he announced his candidacy. Biden’s been proving is own racism on a regular basis, and they’re ignoring it.
Y’all make me sick. We really going to get Trump for another 4 years bc y’all hate Biden AND don’t vote. I hate it here.
Does she have to accept it? I wouldn't align myself with Biden or ANY democrat. I believe it's a matter of choice (and aligning oneself with Biden is a poor choice).
Sure. And my future hinges on stupid decisions like voting for anyone else but Biden. I like you, but seriously, now is not the time for this.
I hate Trump, he’s not the problem though. The structures that gave him to us are the problem. Biden personifies those structures. The last 4 years have been a reawakening of the left. Worst case, that continues. We are fucked; either way we will all die in a climate apocalypse
We reject Joe Biden stupidity. We also reject Trump racism. Both men are not good for America. We will vote for Joe but after he's elected start protecting him. Right now Trump must go.
is just too smooth. Like buttah. 😂
I agree. Hillary WON every debate against #trump and it accomplished NOTHING. I'm certain that Joe Biden would do well to steer clear of THAT trainwreck! #trump brings nothing to the debate except lunacy. Don't entertain his BS! #VoteTrumpOut2020
To me Biden has always been afraid of the two top female candidates who ran for president. If he was smart, and fair minded he would have picked either one by now.

The way I hate that we really have to pick between trump and biden like girl wtf am I suppose to do with this
REMEMBER: REPUBLICANS FINANCIALLY BACK MENTALLY ILL MEN! #TrumpIsMentallyIll #KanyeIsMentallyIll
So Joe Biden just said, essentially that “Black people are all alike”  Maybe the craziest thing he’s ever said  Of course White Liberals think that   That’s why the take the Black vote for granted &amp; never do anything to earn it  But most aren’t dumb enough to say it out loud
I don't think Biden had any leads in polls
All jokes aside, if the entire black electorate desires to stay home this November and cause Biden to lose the election, I just want the entire establishment to know that that’s on YOU, NOT the voters. Is this seriously supposed to be the “lesser evil” for me as a black man?
So all you've proven is that you're a horse's ass. The man compensates for a stutter. Just find some compassion, would you?
Michelle Obama should step up. And tell Joe Biden that you want the job as Vice President. You’re depriving yourself and your country. That’s why you’re depressed you know you would change everything and history would be grateful. 12 years of peace and happiness for Americans ❤️
JOE BIDEN CLARIFIES COMMENTS comparing diversity in Latino and African American communities.
Joe Biden has more faith &amp; Christianity in the tip of his little finger, than Donald Trump has in his entire body! #DonnieIsNotChristian!!!
Are ya sure he’s as bad as Biden? I think there both older then dirt but Biden can even get one sentence out
Biden is no different from Trump... No matter how you try to spin it.... I guess your spin make you feel better to vote for him...
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE Biden has shown the best reason why he should choose a Black woman as his vice-president. He is in needs of a strong black woman to help him. This is a time of racial awakening in America, it would be counter productive to have two whites as  Potus and Vice.
just learned a new Ohio term : Drop box I read an article that said there is a need for more Drop boxes Also Independents are breaking to Biden; this is important because independents usually break to the winners It’s Biden leading by one point Ohio will go blue!
I'm getting the strong feeling that the GOP operatives behind this don't actually know any Black people.  Going to be hilarious if Dems stay level and Trump drops from 8% to 7% of Black vote because those are the only Black voters who could shift in 2020.
Big Day for you Guys-Dumpy visited Ohio! Well Ohio is where Dumpy chose to say Biden hates God and the Bible Geez! Trump can’t quote 1verse from the Bible! What a Fraud! Now for the good news:Ohio is officially a swingstate;independents are breaking to Biden -tie
Agreed, but at least we don’t have to worry about Biden starting WW3 or holding the government hostage. He’s got dignity.
Haha, whatever you say, zealot. Biden with his corruption in the Ukraine and China with Hunter would be sooooo much better.   Sorry, I reached my limit of arguing with the unwashed ignorant. Bye
Biden is the lesser of two evils. I’m not voting for Biden, I’m voting against Trump and his cabinet of gremlins.
He is. God just can’t take anymore of Biden stumbling to speak. Biden is killing him with dementia. 😂😂😂
Black people as a group are not dumb enough to vote against our own self interests and &amp; we're not dumb enough to vote for a secondary fool. Kanye is there to siphon weak white votes from Biden. White people routinely vote against their self-interests as long as we're worse off.
Well, let’s see, steel mills closed, farms went bankrupt, prices went sky high, the economy was starting to dive.  Yea,  Biden might know how to actually negotiate a tariff agreement. Unlike this joke of a “Businessman” you elected #AmericaOrTrump  #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
Y’all are clowns and I WOULD NEVER be on this platform, or any platform, talking about my support of a such a person. Vote for Biden in silence. Pleathe.
Obama/Biden used the FDA to bludgeon businesses into the ground and said publicly that they were going to put industries out of business. But sure thing if it was to protect us. Not to benefit China or any other country that paid #ChinaJoe Joe and Barack didn't do anything for us
Yes what don't you understand about this. NO ONE is inspired by Biden but fuck Trump. That's where we've been at since January 2017.
Trump or Kanye have no political experience. Biden should be President over them based off his experience in politics alone.
Oh come on, S. E. Stop screwing around.  You know what has to be done as well as anyone.  #AmericaorTrump.    Anything less than a vote for Biden is failing your country.
Every time I think about the fact that we could’ve had Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders, but instead, we’re stuck with Biden...
If you’re placing a Vegas bet on the National Election, don’t put too much money on Biden!
How weak does Trump make the Christian God by saying a President Biden would hurt Him?  Or does Trump think Biden is an Odinson?
Biden: Unlike The African-American Community, The Latino Community Is An Incredibly Diverse Community
Trump vs Biden
... I think this is a serious question, so I’ll answer it seriously. No one believes Biden will be in for the full term. Many people believe he is just a pry-bar to ultimately get a more progressive candidate in the Oval Office. Even Biden has indicated he will do 1 term and go.
Trump: "He's a Socialist!!" Bernie: "Yeah, I am. So?"  Trump: "...Shit. I didn't have plan for that. You were supposed to deny it and be put on the defense."  We all know what's going to happen with Biden. You all are betting the farm on Trump fatigue. Good luck.
This is why I agree with those who propose if Biden wins a commission or special Congressional committee to investigate every single example of the Trump family's graft and corruption the last 4 years. Even if they are not all prosecuted, the public must know about the abuses.
Anyone who thinks that Biden should keep quiet lest he tell on himself is not your ally, FYI. They would rather you have a false opinion and vote the way they tell you. Authoritarian. Shameful.
Commission rejects President Trump's push to add debate against Biden
Maybe you can find the answer in Trump's bible in two corinthians. Only in Trump's bible you might find that Biden can hurt omnipotence.
I hate this response. Why shouldn't people know what Biden thinks? Hear him unfiltered? People who think voters should be kept ignorant about who they're voting for are absolutely disgusting.
Stop lying.  You have no intention of voting for Biden.  Wear your Trump flag proudly!!!!
I remember how smarmy Biden was during Justice Thomas confirmation hearing. NO respect for Black people then nor NOW!
I wish Joe Biden WOULD hurt God, that would be the most metal thing he’s ever done

Sorry   Biden's record of failure that spans 5 decades in politics and now more?   I'll be waiting for his VP pick, That's who runs the country if the Squad will allows her to.
WHY WHITES POLITICIANS SHOULDN'T COMPARE DIFFERENT BETWEEN PEOPLES OF COLOR  Joe Biden Dismisses Diversity in African American Community As He Launches Ad Targeting Black Voters.  Yet another example of the Democrats taking the Black vote for granted.
Donald Trump says there may be a vaccine around November 3rd, Election Day. It’s name is Joe Biden and he’s going to take out the virus.
He would probably reply by saying that God chose Trump to lead our country and that Biden is going against God's will in running against Trump.
Funny how it's all about "Joe Biden's America" but our current hellscape is literally Clay Higgins's America
And where’s Biden these days? #HidenBiden
For me this is a common decency issue. Attacking VP Biden’s religion- belief in God- demonstrates a lack of humanity. We cannot have someone like this running our country.

Is he saying Biden is an atheist
It’s a false equivalence though. Biden is a fairly sucky choice for the Democrat ticket, I acknowledge that. But Trump is the absolute nadir of American politicians. They’re not comparable.
Nope, just like we all don’t like Joe Biden
After four years of Biden, "he's better than Trump" may be impossible to say.
Joe Biden is a devout Catholic. His faith sustained him as he buried a wife and two children. He is certainly not "against God," as alleged by the guy who tear-gassed protestors to confiscate a church and mishandle a Bible for a photo op. Biden is a good man. His opponent is not.
Joe Biden is incompetent. But he's not a fascist. Stop expecting him to actually be a leader or be presidential. He's not that guy. Literally the only reason we need to elect him is to unseat the orange fool. He's just a figurehead. In office, it's his team that will matter.
This Biden guy sounds alright!
BEFORE the short hand hits noon on his first day, Biden will eat all toddlers, set all churches on fire and  throw all guns in the Bermuda triangle. BY HIMSELF, with one hand tied behind his back and wearing roller blades and booty huggers   OH LAWD what is we gone do!?
Biden you’ve been saying some pretty racist stuff as of late. People think if trump made those comments. If you don’t vote for joe then you ain’t black come on his words

Let me ask a few questions:  When President Obama and Vice President Biden were in office, did they take your guns away? NO! Did they take away your religion? NO! Did they take away your bibles? NO!   DONALD TRUMP IS A LIAR!
Joe Biden want to lose this race and he's doing a great job doing it. I said Joe need to shut up.
Bruh Biden didn't even give folks his bare minimum during this campaign. He just said hella racist shit and had y'all niggas defending him! Now that's some shit!
Look at this self-righteous crap. As I’ve said, we know Trump is a racist, traitorous, grifting, corrupt, fascist baby-cager. If you don’t vote for Biden that’s a vote for Trump.

Biden’s decline gets worse with each passing day.  I’m sure lots of Democrats are having buyer’s remorse. They just won’t admit it publicly.
Biden should have rolled with the idea that he would “hurt God” to get the coveted 18-30 year old metalhead vote
Where do I start? How about the fact that the dems don't denounce communist groups like BLM and ANTIFA, how about the fact that Bolshevik Bernie, AOC &amp; others are guiding &amp; fine tuning the Biden campaign.
Donald Trump calls Joe Biden “sleepy,” but Biden's  physician states that the 77-year-old is in good health and nowhere near slowing down.  Must be why Trump now thinks Joe can hurt God?💪💪
Donald Trump is more of a Jerry Jones type of racist..mtge type that feels like because he employs black ppl he can’t be racist but deep down, black folks he’s racist af   Joe Biden is more like a Drew Brees type of racist, he’ll surround himself with black ppl but he’ll go

Biden is committed to choosing an African American woman to the Court. Harris would be an excellent candidate for that, if the opportunity arises.

I highly doubt it. U just don't get it. In 2016 ppl voted for u cuz they didn't like Hillary &amp; thought that u would be the lesser of 2 evils. Now that ppl have seen u in action, most regret it. Some ppl will vote for Biden simply b/c he's not u. Ur braindead cult is all you got.

You’re wrong about the second one. Biden looks cool as hell in that video and dumb guy car stuff is absolutely relatable to the American working class. He’s got this in the bag.

It’s clear to me that Joe Biden has absolutely no respect for black people. His latest remark should give pause to all blacks who are planning to vote for him in November.
At least he can actually use one.  Biden forgets where he is .... oh wait, he was joking.
I believe Biden hates mike and Obama and used them to get to the top.
There’s also the fact that Biden could fart on camera and I’d still vote for him because he isn’t a fascist.
Exclusive: Kanye West Indicates That His Spoiler Campaign Is Indeed Designed To Hurt Biden
I wonder if Trump might be an asymptotic carrier of Covid ;ie DeWine down Herman Cain -dead ;Ted Cruz , Rand Paul all Rebuplicans btw Trump said:Biden wants to “hurt God’”, but I think God must wear a mask around Trump as he infects his own party
Um, this has nothing to do with the 2nd amendment this is about fraudulent behavior in a no -profit organization. Something you know a lot about. Trump charity us rife with fraud. Biden has never tried to take guns. That was you!
And Biden will also take away person, woman, man, camera, tv 🤦🏾‍♂️😂🤣😆
from    "BIDEN SAYS HE’LL SURRENDER 2 CHINA ON TRADE, SCRAP TARIFFS W/O ANY CONCESSIONS  ...yearns 2 go back 2 status quo."  Yearns(?)..Jason Miller who admitted paying prostitutes &amp; got mistress pregnant just B4 wife gave birth  Someone is yearning &amp; it's not Joe
Remember Biden called God - a thing?
And to answer your question...probably not, but perhaps so if Joe Biden got three fresh picks haha
This is about as big a non-gaff as any biden gaff will ever be. To anyone listening to the comment in good faith, It’s pretty clear what he meant.
If Mike Pence can be VP, then anybody can become VP!?!  He’s a disaster who takes zero accountability.  The media should not be treating Biden’s VP selection with more scrutiny than it would Pence!
Dems across the country are excited about   Thank you  for all you do, and for riding with Biden! #BBB #mayorsforbiden #bidenforLA #nola #nolavotes #vote
Thank goodness, maybe that will help people forget how biden called black kids "roaches" &amp; didn't want busing black kids to white schools so his (&amp; "our") kids wouldn't have to grow up in a "racial jungle."
Tom Elliott is a right wing hack. Fuck that guy.  Still voting for Biden.

Can we get a presidential candidate with some sense for once?! Please? Biden and Trump are trash, old, racist, senile, bigots, just ugh throw them BOTH away
Biden actually hates her.

Biden has already said that Butigege is going to be his gun czar and Butigege  has already said he is coming for all of your guns.  NO Fear mongering  there !!
Biden is racist
I did what I could within the parameters of the texting program and the responses I’m allowed to make. But I don’t think I did much to convince him. He kept saying Biden needs to do more to convince the younger generation. It made me really depressed. But I will keep texting.
Last 2 nights I’ve been texting for Biden. Last night I got an Ohio voter who said he was a socialist &amp; was planning on writing in Bernie in Nov. He didn’t see a lot of difference between Biden &amp; Trump. I really didn’t think these people actually existed, but apparently they do.
I hope we are not going to see thousands of photos of Biden doing church-y things for a kajillion years.  Because they should not take the gaslighter's bait and get distracted and diverted.
I’ve seen one house in New Orleans (garden district) with a Biden sign
But u can watch Biden who hates black people?   Lol
Your criticism of Biden is valid, but the account you're quote-tweeting belongs to a white supremacist who is an editor for a white supremacist "news" source. His motives are not good.
Of all the horrible events in 2020 I was reminded today that we will still be forced to endure a Biden/Trump “debate” and thus the worst is yet to come.
Joe Biden will do WHAT now???
If you're a Black person and what he said offended you...tell me what would it take for Biden to say or do that would drop your support of him? I'm betting on "nothing". Biden knows this, which is why he's empowered to say such things.
Black people are registered Democrats, Independents, Republicans and not party affiliated at all. Black people are rich, middle class, working class and poor. We are conservative, liberal and radical on a range of social issues.  I don’t know what else to say than Biden was WRONG
What Biden is saying (poorly) is that Black Americans, on the whole, are guaranteed to vote Blue. The Hispanic community...not so much. This is an attempt to rationalize why Biden does not have overwhelming support in their community.
Your criticism of Biden is valid, but the account you're quote-tweeting belongs to a white supremacist who is an editor for a white supremacist "news" source. His motives are not good.
Listen we (Democrats) may not agree with Biden... at all.. but we will NEVER vote for trump. Never.
🚨 🚨 🚨   Joe Biden thinks all black people think alike
Nope. I saw the whole clip and it doesn’t change the fact that what he said is disrespectful to Black people. If a conservative punk can use that against Biden that’s Biden’s fault.   But you go on and keep defending someone who doesn’t respect you. Be blessed sir. 👋🏾

Listen. If you see any tweets that are critical of Biden, please check to see who's tweeting them. The same old manipulation is happening that happened in 2016. It doesn't mean Biden is beyond criticism, but it behooves all of us to check the motives of people criticizing him.
Translation: She doesn't want to vote for Biden, and will find literally any excuse not to have to admit she wants to vote for Trump.
Not really government as such but how much they lost from the regime lol Would bet that Afro-Cubans vote more left wing than rich cuban exiles. The fake outrage around Biden s quote is dishonest shit. Good response should be making sure it does not take for guaranteed black vote

And they’re part of the Black community meaning that Black people- like Latinos- are diverse and not a monolith. Biden tried to differentiate the two on the basis of diversity and he’s WRONG.
This comment by BIDEN has nothing to do with TE. So because someone you don’t like posted it that makes BIDEN’s comment less trash?
Biden has attended more Church services in a month than Donnie has his entire life!!
Kinda looks like they photoshopped him onto Biden’s body
God has just replied to  regarding Biden.  "This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased"  Clears that up.....
Biden has spent exponentially more time in church than Trump has
If anyone wants to watch Biden's comments in context start around 29 minutes in on this link. He could have phrased it far better but he is talking about how many different places the Latino community comes from (Mexico, Venezuela, Cuba, etc)
Joe Biden will "hurt God"?  Ooooo  weeee....we've been waiting for this moment.
According to Trump.....Biden is against everything!  What a pile on.....
Democrats are going to lose in November and they deserve it. Joe Biden shouldn't have been the nominee
TE’s twitter feed is trash and this Biden comment is also trash. Both can be true at the same time.

So that’s the reason why you’re gonna vote Trump instead of Biden?
It's terrible that neither MSNBC nor CNN both to cover these repetitive racist statements Biden makes yet CNN covers even the slightest error Trump makes
There should be no response from Biden folks to anything Giuliani says. He has no defined role. Later, when it suits, Trump will say “he wasn’t part of the campaign.” This is how Trump handled Roger Stone.
Why does Joe Biden keep saying negative &amp; insulting things about black people? Sounds like a racist to me.

Sounds like Biden needs to appeal to more young black people. He's already got older black people. But he's shaky with younger black voters.
She’s absolutely right. The only good thing about Biden waiting this long to select is that it shields his pick from the attacks that’s already brewing. I believe the VP pick, hopefully Kamala, will get more negative attention than Trump and Biden. She will be the main target.
This entire thread started because you thought Biden was a good at foreign policy. As we can we now, you were “overwhelmed”
Sorry. I’m overwhelmed. If you can accept that as an excuse for Biden, then you can accept it from me
And if I did lie. I would just use the Biden playbook.  “I was overwhelmed. “ it’s better than the trump excuse, “fake news”
I’m not pushing anything. And I dislike  Biden as much as I dislike trump.  I can’t believe this is my choice for president.

I just learned that joe Biden lost his wife and daughter in a tragic accident..I tried to tell myself maybe he missed them so much that all these girls he is sniffing was a way to be closer to his loved ones lost..but I have seen the videos and he touches them inappropriately.
Biden admitted to it.  Trump didn’t.   Even Snopes, which left leaning says you are wrong
Are you saying that Biden is good at foreign policy, because the head of the cia/dia/fbi/nsa says he isn’t.  And these people all worked for Obama.
Trump has done everything he promised to do. Democrats  are just poor losers . Anyone that would vote for Biden has a screw loose. 👎👎
So he lied and he got caught.  Just like his son. The only person to get a Navy commission with a drug charge, then gets kicked out of the Navy for doing cocaine.  How does anyone get a job with a dishonorable discharge? Trump and Biden are the same person..... terrible

I’m not particularly interested in Biden falling prey to the same schoolyard bully taunts that resulted in Warren taking a DNA test. The test results are not the point in either case. It’s Trump attempting to have CONTROL over the process, the narrative, the opponent he fears.

Also, people claim someone took Trumps SAT tests.  It’s confirmed that Biden plagiarized most of his law school papers &amp; misrepresented his academic record.  This is why he dropped out of the race in ‘87. Because of his questionable character. They are the same exact person
Biden and Trump are literally the same exact person.  They are both senior citizens, who cannot complete a sentence. They were also both bad businessmen, then used their political and business connections to help their idiot kids.
He is literally considered the worst politician in the history of foreign policy.  Just because he was on the foreign policy committee doesn’t mean he was good at it. River Gates worked for Obama and Bush.... and he proves that Biden has always been on the wrong side

Great response in defense of Biden not needing a cognitive test that’s ageism.Fauci is 79 and Brilliant-year older than Biden . Trump’s doctor ordered he get a cognitive test-too bad there isn’t one for narcissism and ignorance
Take away the last paragraph... We cannot vote against our values... Not even against Trump.... Biden is for everything we stand against.
“Mr. Biden, please stop eating the crayon” is about how I expect it to go.  Hamster fell off the wheel a long time ago.
Biden doesn’t!  Good one!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN VOTE BIDEN 2020
Why in the world is it a headline that Joe Biden isn’t graveling in the middle of a fucking pandemic? Is the media carrying the stupid basement talk?
The sad part is that people will vote for Biden knowing he isn't fit for the position but their hatred for President Trump will override their better judgement and common sense.

All I want for Christmas is a #DemocraticSenate &amp; #Biden Administration
I don’t blame Biden why should he have to take a mental acuity test-because he’s old? Fauci is 79 a year older than Biden
Where are all the psychologists who nightly gave the public their views of Trump's cognitive ability now that Biden's gaffes are in the news?
Trump is NOT a "moron," he is just a stubborn ass! I'll be voting for Biden!
during a pandemic a ham sandwich could beat donald trump. unfortunately the democrats are not running a ham sandwich, they are running joe biden.

Virtual Joe Biden is running for President
Joe Biden answers questions just fine. Trump on the other hand is incoherent, delusional and seriously demented. You should seek help yourself if you can't see the difference.
BREAKING NEWS:❗️💥💥 Biden Infers that a BLACK reporter SHOULD take a COCAINE test before COMING on AIR 😳🤭😱🤡💥💥💥👇
Joe Biden asked a black journalist today if he'd been tested for cocaine &amp; was a junkie. What is BLM's reaction?  You like to read?  BLM activists targeted businesses including a Cuban restaurant owner for retaliation if they did not meet their demands.
Let me get this straight🤔 So, Kanye West is suppose to pull the African American vote from Joe Biden for 45👀  KAYNE WEST!!
Who's getting the plastic surgery to look like Biden?
Having to choose between voting Trump or Biden for President is like starving to death and being offered a poisionous poop sandwich to survive. Is this really our only option?
because as we all know...
Also should mention this part
I'm pretty convinced you could pick any random person off the street and give them the support Biden has and they'd be a stronger candidate.
I swear I thought Biden was doing a Biden impression when I watched this. He even pulls out another, "no I shouldn't say it" at the end there.
He said if the trump campaign goes hard at Hunter Biden, he will pay for scorched earth about Vanky and that knucklehead she is married to. I believe Michael Bloomberg.  That’s  why we are not hearing lies about the Bidens.  Especially Hunter.
Not sad at all.  Biden and Obama were big time criminals.  Just because he got dementia doesn't mean the crimes never happened.

Yeah Why the hell would Biden take a cognitive test?!!! The results are in  He has Dementia
Just keep in mind your alternative to Biden!
trumpsters, read this graph (if you can). trump did nothing to boost our economy! It was a Obama-Biden economy. They're going to do it again!
Now it is Comey and not Biden who brought up the Logan Act. What horseshit.
Biden sure loves that basement.
AP source: Biden will not go to Milwaukee to accept Democratic presidential nomination
I will hold my nose and vote for Joe Biden but I will also keep him and the Congress/Senate accountable.
Of course not, it would occur after 4 pm, Biden would be in sundowning mode. They wouldn't be able to deny his dementia
THERE IS THE HIGH PROBABILITY but then again, though he is our candidate, Biden is still a white male.  My preference would have been a women president &amp; with either being a person of color.  Considering these time, it will be a travesty to have two whites in those positions.

Wouldn’t the obvious and reasonable criticism with Rice be that Biden is looking to the past for guidance? Elections are supposed to be about the future.
Everything you said about trump is opinionated. Everything you said about Biden has been proven
But if he don’t vote for Biden, he ain’t black
Biden could piss himself on the debate stage while speaking in tongues drooling profusely and I would still vote for him. How’s that for a gaffe!

EDITORIAL: Surprise: Liberals urge Joe Biden to skip the debates  via
But no one, NO ONE should rest! It’s not enough to win the presidency. Dems must gain seats in the House &amp; take the Senate in order for Biden to govern. It’s looking like #MoscowMitch will win against McGrath. This is bad news. We must #VoteBlueNoMatterWho UP AND DOWN THE TICKET!
"Stumbled badly"?  Seems perfect to me. Biden argued that a person with a drug abuse problem presents symptoms. A test can confirm that.  A person with cognitive issues presents symptoms. A test can confirm that. Trump's doctor ordered the test, so symptoms presented.
Trump’s re-election strategy: Robert E. Lee type genocide. No moral person will vote for Trump. He’s still polling 8% among blacks which is greater than any republican since 1964 even after Floyd/COVID.   We must find this 8% &amp; educate them. 1% but 8%?
Get your ass out and vote for Biden.   This isn’t Maxims de Paris.  This is Roller Derby.
BIDEN: "No, I haven't taken a test. Why the hell would I take a test? C'mon man. That's like saying you, before you got in this program, if you take a test where you're taking cocaine or not, what do you think huh? Are you a junkie?" HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

They don't need to. Biden leads in the polls despite the fact that he stays quiet. Why? Because Trump's performance is doing Biden's campaign work for him. Look at Biden's low social media mentions:
Pence can't wave a wand and say "I hereby pardon you for all crimes in the future" Just don't charge him until Biden is sworn in. Pence can't pardon state crimes, only federal crimes. NY can still nab Trump for state crimes.

I highly doubt she stayed to antagonize Biden or deter him from accumulating delegates. I think she wanted to win (a race she had no chance of winning) or broker a convention deal (which she had no leverage for based on campaign performance).

Good lord, Trump is fully incoherent most of the time. You’re talking about Biden?? 😂
Yes! Biden doesn’t have to spend much on advertising. Trump advertises for Biden every time he opens his mouth but that Acios interview was WONDERFUL!
Lrt Look The two party system Sucks but PLEASE god do not let this line of thought stop you from voting this election PLEASE Biden as a PERSON is not much better than trump but on a POLITICAL level hes SO MUCH FUCKING BETTER because hes not gonna try and become a fucking DICTATOR

If Biden really adopts one progressive policy I’ll vote for him. Like if he made the case for a living wage and sweared to pass it or make it a priority I’d vote for him. Until then nah
Everyone is talking about why Biden should or should not debate Trump and I’m over here SCREAMING why can’t ALL candidates on the ballot debate?!? I wonder why both Rs and Ds fight to suppress legitimate opinions😡#2020Election
should pick the best #2 to heal the country in case, for some reason,  becomes unavailable. We need a Truman, not a Johnson (either of them). That is the best criteria for VP.

True. But it's also true that you should endorse monthly recurring stimulus payments immediately.
Trump killed 150,000 people. Biden killed 0. Trump is going to have to do more than knock.
Why would Biden need to do any interviews at all when Trump is such a spectacular disaster all on his own?

Hi Mr Evans, I'm a 3d year law student with campaign experience, thinking about taking the fall semester off to campaign for Biden. Any chance there are any paid staff positions to apply for?  I'd be happy to send resume/CV.
The sad (really sad) thing is if Sanders had trailed far down enough in the polls early on, he would have endorsed Warren and stridently campaign for her. He is doing it for Biden now -- that's who he is. That probably pisses Warren supporters off.  Saint Bernard indeed.
I'm just saying that Biden's words aren't insane; clearly cops are able to subdue suspects without shooting them 20 times in the back or choking them to death.
What am I lying about?   I feel like you're changing the subject, but I'll engage. This guy wasn't killed by cops. Clearly the police involved heeded Joe Biden's suggestions:
'Oh, Biden' makes a pleasant change from 'oh, his birth certificate' and 'oh, her emails'.
Voting for Biden is moving left. Please join us and enjoy the 4+ years of sanity to continue to progress this country towards universal healthcare, higher minimum wages and other important social programs. We need you bro.
Does Biden have American blood on his hands by screwing up the pandemic response LAMF??? No?  Ok. Vote Biden. Clear as FKN day, dude.

"We put together 46 minutes of Joe Biden nonsense."  *Checks every Trump speech* This was much easier. With all of the lying, misleading, making stuff up, breaking the Constitution constantly, and overall, just acting like a complete douche, I found...3 speeches I couldnt use. xD
Each trump interview is a Biden ad on its own.... he doesn’t need to spend a dime 😂
Its not that Trump will "win" any debate.  He will just outperform Joe in a way that Americans relate to - think professional wrestlers screaming into the camera. Biden will look weak, and pathetic.   They will both babble incoherently, but Trump will make it look intentional.
The Biden voters are lying. They don’t accept any vote they lose.
And we need Mattis, Kelly, Jeb and George, Mitt, to endorse Biden.
President Biden already took care of this. Go have another Big Mac.
I will still vote for Biden. Literally don’t care what Barr makes up
Biden accepted the debates already. Y’all can’t survive a day without lying.
Joe Biden simply loves government and all the power, wealth &amp; notoriety that comes to those who crawl their way to the top.
Dr. Jill is the ultimate authority in what Biden will do since she’s always at his side or in the background like a ‘familiar’ whispering in his ear or calming him down  The question is , is she going to pipe the answers in his ear ? And will they allow her next to Joe ?🧐
Per    FBI raids today relate to: Ihor Valeriyovych Kolomoyskyi.  He owns PrivatBank which is the controlling holder of Burisma. (Think Hunter Biden).  Subject is 16.6 million in illegal loans laundered and transferred to Hunter Biden. - EYES OPEN. BIG MOVEMENT.
There is no nuance to Trump or Biden. Joe Biden could eat kittens on national TV and I'd still pull the lever. You have also made a choice: racism, gift, sheer stupidity, and an economic contraction twice as large as the Great Depression are ok with you. Own it.

Yes, but he also is wrong about Florida. Seems the state is lean Biden as of right now. Biden was up with seniors there of late.
“To address the racial wealth gap, the opportunity gap, and the jobs gap for Latinos, Biden will launch a historic effort to empower small biz creation and expansion in economically disadvantaged areas — particularly for Latino-owned businesses and businesses owned by other POC.”
It's clear that "Yosemite" is a word that Trump doesn't recognize in text form. But please, tell me more about Joe Biden's mental decline.
When is Biden announcing his VP candidate ?
This might be the dumbest thing he's done in this whole "call the election into question" gambit he's running. He's now said Florida's count can be trusted (ostensibly because DeSantis and/or the FL Cong delegation begged him to). That means a Biden win there puts him on ice.

The fact that so many people hate this man and yet believe Donald Trump to be a man of God truly boggles my mind. Biden’s beliefs are not in lockstep with mine, but at least I can see signs of his faith. Trump only has faith in himself and money.

Kanye doesn't have to do that. Biden is doing a good sabotaging his own campaign
Biden shouldn't debate period and only if Trump releases his tax returns
Yep. They centered their entire personality and identity around a politician (gee, where have we seen that before?) so they cant handle that Biden won out, and so he's enemy #1. It doesnt matter what Trump does, because Biden is "literally the same and will do the same stuff".

It is insane Senate Republicans are going all in on a guy just getting dominated in the polls by Biden.
Funny, you just had a guest on that stated Biden would win the election easily. You actually believe that? Tell me you not that naive?
You really believe Joe Biden is prepared to be the President?  Seriously, we have to chose between the two of them. I am so tired of all of this fighting.   I am going to take a break from social media/ politics after reading this thread. Goodnight 🌙
This from a Biden voter. Sthu loser
Biden didn’t say, he would defund the police. More Republican scare tactics.
What is your problem with Biden &amp; his basement, bunker boy? Also, hello! You're only 3 yrs younger than he is &amp; he's not obese.
1) PERSON, MAN, WOMAN, CAMERA, TV 😂🤣 2) trump was already called out on Fox about Biden defunding the police. FAKE NEWS!
Unfortunately until Biden is elected we postal employees are fucked.  This is a disgrace
PERSON, MAN, WOMAN, CAMERA, TV 😂🤣#TrumpVirus tax cuts for the rich only &amp; trump already got called out on Fox for saying that Biden wanted to defund the police. Fake news! What else ya got?!
Biden doesn't have a cult. There's a difference. Both sides are fired up, but we don't threaten people with bodily harm for having to wear a mask, &amp; there's a lot more of us. So, if Putin doesn't cheat for his little puppet this time, he's gonna look like the ass that he is.
Only if God is punishing us. You will lose and be a sore loser. You will claim that Biden cheated some how. You really are a small, small person. I can’t say man because, you are not one.
YES LETS MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Wwu ave over 10,000,000 unemployed, over 152,000 dead. Parents can’t work, kids can’t go to school, thousands dying daily, food banks over run....WHAT THE FUCK IS GREAT IN AMERICA NOW! NOTHING! Need to try Biden. You have failed America!
Dont be fooled into the narrative that Trump will destroy Biden in a debate. Though true, the moderators will pull all the stop necessary to make Biden look normal in the conversations during the debate.
Can I demand a trial by combat for this election? I'd beat up Biden and Trump, be inaugurated, and then immediately step down, allowing VP Sanders to take the reins.
Nobody exposes the truth &amp; hypocrisy of Biden &amp; Obama the way you do! Spot on!!
Being as well informed as you are I’m sure you understand that Biden had a former stuttering issue and does every now and then.  Are you really making fun of that like an uninformed child might? Substance and respect of others are also what he has.
China balls Biden is the weakest man alive. Puppet head bobbin statue.

Yes he did.  All that mattered though. The thing here is Biden doesn't inspire that following, Beto did.  It's hard to know how the mix of disenchantment with the candidates on the left and the right will affect the outcome.  That will make for an interesting story in November.

Everything the lunatic does is counterproductive and harmful. I like many of Biden’s ideas and platforms—but even if I didn’t, I would vote for anyone over this narcissistic, ignorant, wannabe dictator.

Not now - what matters is replacing the SOB in the White House for now!  Personally, there's nothing wrong with a Centered candidate like Biden.  What matters is his VP pick, because that's the future.
Biden will accept the party's presidential nomination from his home in Delaware.
Look - Job Biden is a good man for the JOB!  Leftwing, Rightwing does it matter?  Joe is not much of a Leftist liberal, he more Centered!  However, I'll take a Rightwing Democrat candidate than a Leftist/Rightwing RACIST over the sh!t in our Whitehouse.  Now you know the GAME!
Isn’t it pretty damn obvious how racist #Biden is? He is always getting pissed at reporters who are not white. Wake up #democrats!!   #JoeBiden #JoeBidenIsARacist #racism #racist #racistJoe #RacistJoeBiden

Yes he did.  All that mattered though. The thing here is Biden doesn't inspire that following, Beto did.  It's hard to know how the mix of disenchantment with the candidates on the left and the right will affect the outcome.  That will make for an interesting story in November.

Joe Biden won't remember you voted for him...he smirked for years as he and his mentor Robert Byrd (former KKK) segregated schools.  He won't support Charter Schools either...leaving black families in failing schools.
Holy sh*t!! Did we get the bastard NOW?? Come on!!
What a tool. Shame on him.
You are correct.... we must work together to bring back law and order.   A peaceful country.   Dems have never accepted America’s choice of Donald Trump.   Joe Biden and his chaos will not be the answer.
Class?? Really?  That is a joke. Obama is a money and power hungry loser! Used his presidency for his personal gain, and how classy was it for him to use a funeral as a platform to campaign for Biden abd also try to divide the country just like he did for 8 year, no class Obama
I just don’t understand how anybody with an ounce of common sense can vote for #JoeBiden? It makes no sense whatsoever. I knew we had a lot of morons in the USA but I had no idea how many. If Biden wins, our country will crumble. #Biden

We are not safe NOW!! I don’t want a dictator, I want a president! Biden has my vote!!
Oh no, doesn’t she know that this means Biden loses now ?? :((
I have a question. Since 2020, how many times have you asked to interview Biden?
Biden actually helped contributed to more African American men being thrown in prison unjustfully and Trump went in and undid all his policies.  He’s liberating people!  Don’t be the fool stuck in chains.

Trump is gonna win again ON NOVEMBER 3RD! Biden won't concede though and will claim voter suppression. In the end you will all be crying just like you did in 2016 because you're a bunch of babies!
Biden supported Robert Byrd and even cried at his funeral. Robert Byrd, grand wizard in the KKK Robert Byrd. Wake up. Biden supports segregation and locking up thousands of non-violent poc to harsher sentences. 52 years in government and you think he will change?
Everything the lunatic does is counterproductive and harmful. I like many of Biden’s ideas and platforms—but even if I didn’t, I would vote for anyone over this narcissistic, ignorant, wannabe dictator.
I’m a lifelong Democrat and I agree with you!  I just wish he’d pick someone so people can whine and complain about it  - then get over it  and vote for Biden!

I dunno, I kinda feel it for the most part. I do think it’s unlikely Texas, Florida, Ohio, Iowa, and Georgia goes Biden so that makes a difference.

Who is afraid to debate? Biden has debated 12 times in the past year against MUCH more intelligent and articulate people than Dipshit Donnie. Trump is horrible in debates, because it shows how uniformed (ignorant) he really is

It's really not anyone's business who she commits to voting for, but honestly after watching Biden speak...How can anyone say he'd make a good leader??  Thanks for you're service
Biden would get several hours of extra time.
My big worry is Biden destroying the moon! Because then where we gonna go??
Def, but only because I want to see Biden, “Hurt the Bible. Hurt God,” like Trump said he would if he wins. The former won’t put up much of a fight (inanimate objects are notoriously lazy), but God is supposedly a badass.😏
I think that one of the debate moderators should ask each candidate for their favorite bible verse. Pretty certain Biden could do it. Trump? NEVER.
I love how every time Biden says some stupid crap, a handful of people come and say what he was trying to say is.... No just admit the dude says some dumba$$ crap
I wish I could vote for the Biden that Trump rambles about and not the actual Biden. Fake Biden sounds fucking awesome
Thank God. As it is, we must endure 3 debates between Joe Biden and a poo-flinging Orange orangutan. 😠

Top GOP senators give Trump the Biden probe he got impeached for trying to force on Ukraine
I think Kanye should be invited to the debates. Biden can just sit back and watch two narcissists brag about how great they are. Let America see their depravity up close.
It’s also a bit odd to think it will take away Biden voters.
Biden is just a puppet with tons of money behind him we the ppl he’s just a pawn in this and if wins will be run by two evil forces nancy and Obama GOD help us all

This is my reaction to most things people think Biden should do. He is ahead. Trump and COVID19 are doing the heavy lifting. Why rock the boat?
Can we have the version of Joe Biden that Trump keeps yodeling about? He sounds pretty good.
Exactly why Biden will lose in a landslide, zero energy regarding his campaign.
Biden released his tax returns and Trumpdid not. What is he hiding?
When do we move from....boy Biden makes a lot of racially related gaffes to Biden is a plain ol racist? With Trump they have to twist his words around to make his comments seem racist. Don't have to do that with Biden. Just cue the tape!
Biden's voters are too busy convincing themselves he is surely gonna win, rather than trying to learn from Clinton's mistakes.
What is Trump hiding in his taxes? Biden has released his - where is Trump’s?  I would be careful if I were you - we all know Trump really failed. Not a good look if he has to release it.
Like Obama's campaign speech for Biden while attacking Trump at John Lewis' funeral? Like that??
Not Biden !  Huh !
Everything you said was a LIE.  Biden has agreed to the debates. The non-partisan Commission on Presidential Debates announced only 3 debates which is the standard.  They said no to four. Not Biden.
I just hope that there are enough people out there that want to see 45 the hell out of office (in the right states) so that he's gone. We'll have to work on Biden afterwards, because he's definitely going to need some work.
This is a great credit to Joe Biden’s leadership. Proud to have the strong endorsement from one of the best mayors in the country.
Who is advising Trump to lower expectations for Biden in the debates? By September, if Biden shows up sober and completes one coherent sentence, he'll exceed the expectations Trump is setting with these idiotic attacks.
Seriously?  He could pick a shrub and I’d vote for Biden over Trump
“Yard signs don’t vote” is also a bit of conventional wisdom in campaign world now, especially among the types who would work for Biden, so even in the primaries they would have been pretty difficult to come by.

Joe Biden wrote the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act:  Bill Clinton's crime bill destroyed lives, and there's no point denying it
I’m going to be fair to Biden and say that they are around in metro Detroit now. The campaign won’t be giving them away in NYC, CA or IL and you can get them for free here. But, that people aren’t buying them in the bluest places is definitely a bad sign for enthusiasm.
I also heard Joe Biden wants to ban mom, apple pie, and Chevrolet.

So is Biden in the deep throws of dementia OR powerful enough to hurt God? I’m confused
Biden literally doesn’t support most of these concepts. Why are you so blatantly lying to the world? I cannot wait for  to represent Louisiana with honesty and integrity.

The only way I'm not voting for Joe Biden based on his VP is if his VP's last name is Trump.
Ooh, vote for me! Otherwise Biden will stop the release of this imaginary vaccine that isn't even done with intial trials yet! Fuck off,  We see what you're selling and we're not buying.
They are deeply concerned whether America can stomach 3 debates between Biden and a poo-flinging Orange orangutan, much less 4...
If you would decide against him because of his pick for VP, you don't want Trump.gone badly enough. It's either Biden regardless of which woman he chooses or another 4 years of Trump. Easy decision for me. Why not for you?
Folks this is what communism looks like. Vote for Biden and this is what the country will look like.
And Biden supported it. Just a reminder.
No, im just being a twitter troll, I'm voting for Biden. Never voted for Trump
You can’t please everyone. Actually Biden is probably the hardest candidate for Trump to run against. None of his labels are sticking. I would prefer Biden to just serve one term, however (something he has discussed.)
not the democrats forcing bernie out of a candidacy and turning around and campaigning "settle for biden" 💀💀💀
Trump claims Biden will "hurt God." This is a campaign in search of a message.
Joe Biden is both a mentally feeable puppet and strong enough to hurt God. Very clear messaging with 89 days to go.
Lock Joe Biden in a basement and tell him to shutup until the morning of Nov. 4.
Biden’s whole campaign is rooted in the expectation that BIPOC will vote blue on default. Decades of people voting Democratic as the lesser of two evils as lead them to thinking that they don’t need to do anything to win votes, it’s dangerous &amp; we can’t let them win this way
Joe Biden’s like “did I say this? Did I say any of this?”
You got me, let's just vote for Biden
joe biden ignoring his entire political career before 2008
I dont think Joe Biden needs anyone to gas him up in order for him to do retarded shit
Whooo boy is this a racist take from Biden 💀💀 Acting like the black community is some monolith while then saying another race isn’t and has diverse opinions IS A RACIST THING TO SAY. Biden lost black people under 40 by huge margins. Biden is just 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
It AMAZES me to no end that Dems really believe Biden IS a viable candidate!! I honestly don’t believe it’s humanly possible which is why I’m more positive than ever that they’re up to dirty tricks as usual!!

I really don’t care if it’s Polly purebred. I’ll vote for Biden or anyone that runs against Trump for president. #VoteBlueNoMatterWho2020 However, I must say I think Biden is a really great choice.
Biden Rally: March 9
“So you see, Biden is centrist right but not as right wing as Trump. And if we elect him, we can push him left of right and then his left will become right and the right will move left to make centrist more left than right. Right? Got it?”
#BarryPresgraves, the mayor of Luray, Facebook post: "Joe Biden has just announced Aunt Jemima as his VP pick." He took it down, but it’s still how he feels. He should resign immediately. How many more are out there, that think and speak like this behind closed doors?
Then the world will be in real problems. Biden is a very bad publicity for the US.  Never ever such an idiot
Opinion | If Biden wins, the post-Trump corruption purge will have to be epic
Disgusting how many djt signs &amp; f’ing FLAGS here (semi-rural, white, racist). But PA’s less gerrymandered than 2016. My district is now more red, but better results for state in 2018 (many more Dems to Congress than before). Pretty sure PA will go Biden.
All of those Biden supporters will change their minds if he wins in November. Suddenly Socialism will take over and ruin our lives. Knowing Americans there will be those who will fight Socialism.
Starting to wonder if Biden's team wants to throw the election on purpose.
Starting to think Biden wants to lose on purpose.
This is the perfect example of how delusional democratic voters are; the big quiet silent majority of Americans will see Joe Biden on TV and shake their heads and vote again, against !
News coming out of #NABJNAHJ20; Joe Biden is expected to announce his pick for Vice President later today
Press has written Trump's political obituary, but still lots of campaigning left.
Is that the extent of your campaign push? Misogynistic messaging followed by “please vote for Biden”?
Contributors at the NYT, WaPo, AND YOUR VERY OWN NETWORK had been advocating that Biden refuse to debate.  Stop gaslighting us.
Not working. It’s so obvious you morons got into a meeting and decided to push this whole “Dems are afraid to let Biden debate” narrative. He debated much smarter, more articulate candidates than Trump 12 times in the past year. Bring it. PS-pay your child support
I can see it now!  President Trump at the podium, VP Biden in his basement!!
Joe Biden Will Not Travel To DNC In Milwaukee To Accept Democratic Nomination
I think Kanye should be included in the debates. Biden can just sit back and watch two narcissists try to fight for the microphone. 😂
when it comes to the U.S voting next, what it boils down to is WHO is the 'lesser of two evils'? Last time trump was considered "it" over Clinton, like Johnson was over Corbyn here, this time WHO is the 'lesser evil'- Biden or trump? Tough call tbh...
No it’s not! It’s a Democrat Party attempt at a coup! They clearly KNOW that Biden can’t make it through a DEBATE. That’s why they have put it off until AFTER certain States had their”Mail-In Vote”!!
🙄 y’all are all absolutely idiots!! If you think that this man isn’t doing the best for America and think some DUMBFUCK aka BIDEN can do better, you all are completely hopeless! It sickens me to think this many people thinks Biden would do better—Fucking Unreal
MORE interesting to me is the fact that Biden &amp; the Dems pulled in $140 Million for July AND $141 Million for June! That is SOME “coincidence” there!  What are the odds of $140 Million almost exactly in a row? Someone is “laundering” $140 Million/month to the campaign!! 😂 1/2
Yet another night when  and his crime family (   have to worry about whether they're finally gonna get indicted the next day.  Sleep well, grifters! (Hunter Biden will be.)
Anyone who has been around Dementia of someone close to them knows Biden has Dementia. It is the same thing. Can't think and reason, confusion, and a lack of knowledge of their incompetance, misplaced emotions or no proper emotions. Sickening that his family is allowing this.
If Obama\Biden said some dumb sh*t like that, I'd call them a jackass. And if Joe or Barack, EVER said; as President they could "DO ANYTHING THEY WANTED", as trump's said many times. I'd be in front they WH demanding impeachment. You guys eat that treason for breakfast.

If you don’t vote for Biden, you’re going to be personally responsible for the Democratic Party failure to nominate a worthy candidate.

amazing footage of Biden squashing the mental deterioration narrative.
I am a 45 year Republican who does not recognize the party today.  We used to be compassionate conservatives and today the Trump and the party embarrasses me.  I will be voting for Joe Biden in November.
Well there is a well thought out intellectual argument folks. What would Joe Biden say and would anyone know what he said?
Most establishment media polls show President Donald Trump trailing in a matchup with Joe Biden, but a closer look at the data shows that these polls are built to discourage Trump voters from showing up.   Today’s polls look an awful lot like 2016.
They have been putting Biden in a TANNING BOOTH to try &amp; cover how unhealthy he looks lately! 😆  How insulting he was to compare a question on HIS clearly debilitated cognitive abilities to his Black interviewers “drug” habits!  “Are you a junkie man?”
Biden states he wants to debate. Dems need to let the man debate.
This could make a real difference in states where the race is close.
77-year-old Joe Biden on cognitive test: ‘Why the hell would I take a test?’
And you think voting for his opposition, Biden is not ‘turning on him’?  Do you think I’m the only one?    I am one person. I can’t get rid of him single handedly.  But I don’t let anyone think for me. Please don’t try.
Biden is deteriorating fast &amp; they’re not hiding it as well as they think they are! They think they can hide it long enough to win the election on his name then hand the spot to the VP, who Voters already REJECTED for the position.
Biden: “no I haven’t taken the test. Why the hell would I take a test? That’s like saying you, before you got in this program, if you take a test where you’re taking cocaine or not, what do you think huh? Are you a junkie”   Hahahahahaa
The dude used his funeral as a campaign ad for Biden, come on let’s be a little honest about it
Joe Rogan can go fuck himself. Joe Biden is fine. He might be old, but at least he's not a conspiracy theory spouting douche canoe.
If Biden wins - yes. No statute of limitations. We can apply the fines to the national debt.
Not all republicans are in favor of Trump. Some of us will be voting for Biden because the alternative is worse.  This dichotomous red/blue thinking is dividing our country.  It is absurd to believe all republicans are the same in their hearts and opinions.
You aren’t paying attention. Biden has held several press conferences in different locations. But I understand why you continue to lie about it - there are a lot of stupid, misguided people who believe you. I’m sure that gets you off.
I'm sure the GOP legislature will follow shock doctrine playbook and use pandemic to further defund LSU. The only way to balance those corporate stooges is with a strong union movement. Biden needs to be pressured to fulfill his promises to labor and outlaw right to work laws.
Hey Dan, Biden won't serve but 15days if elected. Then the VP will take over. My question is, does Pelosi move into the VP spot then?
Doesn't much matter what Biden does. Trump is the only issue!
ONLY $44 per week for me. Definitely made more working. So anyone going to hire me ??? Thought so! now extend my damn $600 so I can survive while looking for work. Or my vote WILL go to BIDEN  #COVID19
Most of us will be shocked if Biden actually debates Trump I think the liberal narrative will spin it so it isn't Bidens fault, but I'm betting we'll see no Trump/Biden debate and you guys will blame everything &amp; everyone but Biden. #TrumpBidenDebate #Debate2020

I really want Trump out. But I hate Biden too. I don't know.
Say NO to mail in voting.  If I want to send a Get Well card to a neighbor a couple miles away, it goes to the local post office, then to Shreveport, back to the local office and delivered maybe 2 days later.  Besides USPS endorsed Biden; It's now a conflict of interest.
And if Biden wins I think we will see Chinese troops here to help Biden crush conservatives. Either way Biden's Presidency will be a failure as he tries to force Americans to give up their freedoms.
Why would Biden do a single interview or debate between now and November?
The people have to know that this whole plannedemic, race riots and the killing of the criminal George Floyd  are the crises the Dems salivate for. Anything to destroy America because they hate one man. That's why dopey Biden's slogan is build back better.

Joe Biden can't make an actual coherent statement.... Biden haven't even laid out a decent plan. Except raise taxes by 3Trillion dollars. He already fucked up there.
So if there was no Donald Trump, Joe Biden wouldn’t have a campaign platform.
TBH we joke about TBG being stuffed &amp; placed into the bench when she starts napping &amp; drooling but I’m wondering if we may actually see that with Biden soon.  He is going down fast from the looks of him &amp; im not sure he will even last til Nov 3!!

True, but a Democratic Congress can find him contempt and a Biden DOJ can prosecute him in 2021.
Biden supporters are inside trying their hardest not to spread COVID-19
So THIS is where they have been headed with the Biden situation!
Under Biden’s rule with those fascists burning bibles and flags in the streets will spread and get worse.  Y’all better wake up to the dangerous point we are at if the dems get in power.  It’s not a joke.  This country is the best on this planet.  People have gotten so stupid.

regarding the lack of appetite by the Biden camp why not hold virtual town halls taking questions from Americans inviting    When he doesn’t show it’s a message in itself
My only complaint about this is that Trump shouldn’t be trailing or even close in polls to this dude.  Yet he most likely is.  Trump needs to widen his appeal bc I can’t imaging anyone really wants to vote for Biden.  Right now they just want to vote against Trump.
Do not vote for Biden.  It's simple; he is in severe mental decline and we cannot have a President in such a state as he.
Biden is neither leader nor politician. He’s a senior citizen suffering from dementia onset, and should be cared for by family. He can barely function. Anyone who cannot see this has hands over eyes.
Uh oh Biden is speaking again get the popcorn ! So when 7 Doctors came out and said what they are doing that they claim is healing corona patients that's not sciencey enough for ya?
The most true Covid/parks tweet out there. We got Trump’d. VOTE KNOPE AND BIDEN.
But yet he doesn’t push Biden for an interview .
Nonsense.  Biden is simply incapable of debating Trump. That is their fear. Trump has more positive accomplishments, by far, and Biden couldn’t defend his record even before his dementia.
Joe Biden cares about American values and American people?  What has he done in 40+ years in gov’t to prove that?
Appreciate your POV but don’t know how you can justify a vote for Biden.  Maybe by looking at Hunters success from hard work?

Ask your dad when it's his turn!  Clinton is not Biden! You can run against Clinton again and win. But Biden is kicking your butt!!!
Biden presidency would bring about the worst economic collapse and civil unrest in decades.  #Trump2020
Strongest economy in the world producing record job growth.  China virus hits.  Biden can’t lead a turd parade.  Trump will restore his economy
We need to decolonize Joe Biden.
100% untrue. Trump was losing to Biden in polls in 2019.
What about biden and Clinton?
Biden got plenty of money from blm donations
Biden is cognitively impaired.  Calling him names now that people are aware of his poor health is not good. I would focus on the Demon Rats who continue to abuse him
There are two groups of people. Those who depend on the narrative, and those who independently consider facts and information. For an ACTUAL, unbiased poll, compare President Trump's 84 million twitter followers to Joe Biden's 7 million.
I’m so sick of this narrative, what do you think would have happened under Obama?  He would not have even canceled flights early like Trump did b/c it was racist.  Joe Biden was even dogging him.  Nancy was in effing China town.  Millions would have been dead.
That thing Joe Biden said.
If you look up #imvoting4bidenbecause every single one of them start of with Bc trump (insert hate speech? And not with Bc I actually believe in Biden. That should tell you something
It doesnt matter who Biden picks. He and his mate will loser either way. So it doesnt really matter who he chooses his running mate.
Anything that is not a vote for Biden is a vote for Trump. If anyone wants 4 more years of this national nightmare then continue working towards the one realistic immediate solution we have. Vote for Biden or we starve, fight, and die needlessly. Get real.
Yes he should!  What is Biden going to do if another Leader is tough?
Joe Biden needs to put a black woman on the SCOTUS.
right and watch dems do a 180 if Biden wins and Antifa is still rioting
This took 10 seconds to pull up, however you can do your OWN research from there, you’d think you people have no idea how to even USE the damn internet!
If Joe Biden pees in my swimming pool I’m still voting for him.
If Biden picks Warren as VP I am gonna stop pretending Biden is the presidential nominee.
Hey! The Media is FINALLY catching on to the fact there are no Biden signs or stickers anywhere!! Lol
I think the democrats forget that there have been 120k coronavirus deaths since Biden won the nominated.  Who really has blood on their hands? #MAGA
It’ll all come out and it’s funny stupid Hillary didn’t show her head with her “ho” husband. How can Biden run a country when he has dementia?Can’t remember where he is or what office he’s running for.Guess because he ran for 48 years and didn’t get anything done.
100% Correct. Trump will win re-election! We Win, America Wins. Thank You Jesus. Our President will crush Biden.
If Biden runs buck naked down black lives matter plaza he'll still get my vote..... contingent on who his VP pick is........trump's gotta go!
Jesus wasn’t a Democrat tho but yes. I will believe that God has a purpose for joe Biden in office if he wins this election
Dems are already setting the stage to reject the election results if their voter fraud fails. If mail in voting plays a significant part and Biden wins, Americans will know it's fraud. If Trump wins, Dems will say he cheated. Either way we may be looking at serious civil unrest.
Biden also won't tell you to inject/ingest bleach or put light bulbs up your bum.
She can’t run in November when they kick Biden off the ticket
Mine too!  Harris|Biden 2020
No grey areas. If you're not for Biden, you're for the Despot. Third party or "independent" candidates are all working to get Trump reelected.
If this is facilitated by Joe Biden I"M OUT
Which is why Biden will not support it.
Hey, I don’t know why all you purists are so attached to eating, medical care, rent, and shit. You can do without those things under Biden just like you can under Trump. So you should just suck it up and vote for Biden so a few people can have brunch again.
“iF yOu dOn’t VoTe fOr BidEn yOu vOtEd fOr tRumP fiFtY tiMeS!”
Biden at the debate.
Agree. Problem for Biden is that the press will punish him disproportionately for refusing to debate.
There Joe goes projecting on to Trump what will happen if Biden is elected🤪
Who had sex meetings at Epstein’s island and killed innocent babies and  tried to overthrow a newly elected president- not trump - maybe Clinton - Obama - Biden - I could keep going -
And this business of the so called polls showing Biden ahead of Trump. I don't know who they've been polling but it sure was one sided.
IMO - if you want to win re-election, you need to get into issues like this to attract the non enthusiastic Biden ‘voters’ - you don’t need the media bias rants anymore etc - it’s a waste of time, everyone that is or would vote for you already agrees on that - widen your appeal
Biden has it all wrapped up in the basement
When Biden list all the things he would do/we should be doing - Trump is already doing! When Fauci was asked by CNN what else should the adminstration be doing his reponse was “nothing, we’re doing everything we should be”. Deaths are high partly due to our unhealthly society
It's what you or I would do. I'm not sure whether Biden's people are that smart, but we can hope so.
All this chaos and division are products of the Obama/Biden administration and Democrat desire for power. Joe Biden mentally deficient, he is a racist and the Democrat party is the party of racism. America will say NO to Joe.
An uprising is likely but if Biden is president then it's more likely it's a left-right uprising.
Stop calling grow men names.  President Biden has a family.  You don’t have heart.  You don’t care about anybody.  My God, save us this terrible man.
You're a total and complete fraud.  No republican would or should take Biden over Trump.
Joe Biden’s Year of Energy Extremism
I get the wait. Trump has his daily lies, conspiracies, and delusional events to keep the focus on him by the media. This keeps the media's attention for awhile on Biden.
Thing is, if Biden refuses to debate Trump, many in the political media will pummel him mercilessly for trashing one norm/tradition as they overlook/downplay the ten norms Trump smashes every week. Politics is an expectations game.
maybe the secret to getting young ppl to vote is Joe Biden saying he’ll bring back Tik Tok
Very well said!  Biden is a dirty, dement ignorant.
By Obama/Biden/intel community/Brennan/clapper.  He was a force on his own
Biden we are not worried.  We also know you won’t be President even if the dems cheat enough to give you the election.  You are just the figurehead.
Biden vetting team...well that qualifies her.
This is what the Democrats will do if Biden is "elected" in November.  If yoiu are a Christian, or a 2nd amendment supporter, or first amendment supporter, if you value freedom, you absolutely must vote to re-elect our President in Nov.  FAIL NOT to cast your vote.
Creepy Sleepy Biden!
Ya voting for biden..  you know he loves pizza and hotdogs...
Glad the biden and burisma scandal is coming to light.  Biden gas caused great harm to our country.  How many americans died because of hunter bidens actions in Ukraine?  Many are trying to find out. #MAGA
I get not supporting Biden, but how in the hell do they still hang with Trump after everything?
If Biden pulls an essentially unknown Scientology-apologist out of his butt for VP over all the known and good candidates, I just... I just don't even know where to start.
BECAUSE OF THE SORRY ASS MEDIA IN THE US. THEY DONT REPORT ON IT SO IT DOESNT HURT BIDENS CHANCE OF WINNING. I STILL THINK THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF BIDEN PICKING HILARY AS HIS VP. ITS THE DEMOCRATS DREAM FOR HILARY TO BE PRESIDENT EVEN THOUGH IT WOULD DESTROY US
Maybe he’s related to Biden
She’s hilarious. I wish she would also do Biden.
Bernie’s performance and an insurgent and ascendant left poised to win a sharply contested race with a small plurality of voters really did seem like a given. I was a Bernie supporter and thought he would beat Trump ina bizarre race. After this, I finally believe Biden could, too
Bill de Blasio Suggests Black Voters Do Not Know Enough About Joe Biden’s Record
I don’t think it was illegitimate to do! But getting everything to happen in the right order, within a three day span, while Buttigieg was still credibly ahead of Biden in the delegate race, took a great deal of coordination for everything to come together just right.
If I’m being honest, that was the first time I felt like Joe Biden might be able to beat Pres. Trump. He had a constituency, and they had sway. Finally, some signs of life from within the Democratic Party.
I think it takes a special kind of naïveté to look at every moderate and left-moderate running for the Democratic nomination endorsing Joe Biden within three days - aside from Elizabeth Warren, who needed to stay in the race to split the left - and think “Seems legit.”
McConnell sounds like a Paul Ryan when he talks about Democrats. He calls and treats Democrats like “colleagues.”   He acts like he does not care if Biden - Pelosi - Schumer run the country with help from AOC, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders,  and other leftists.  We voters do
You do realize, if Biden gets in, Flynn will not be exonerated, right?  New DOJ will go back after him for lying about lying. Same thing Sullivan is trying to do, but only needs a prosecutor to bring the charges.
I get it, there's a lot of really convincing video's on YouTube. Plus a lot of websites that if you don't look up independently sound real, but it's not. That's why mainstream won't touch it. Look outside your zone, that's why I know about the mistakes of Obama &amp; Biden.
Year 2021: BREAKING: President Biden at his inaugural address, “I will serve you all well as your senator, uh, president.”
So if Biden picks Karen Bass as VP that would mean that Scientology would finally take control of the White House so the final stage can begin.
Biden and his team deciding against picking Kamala Harris as VP would be amusing. If they instead pick some random woc with no broad name recognition that would be so cynical. It's such blatant tokenism, they just don't think of minorities as people.
Dan Rather also believes Biden is running for a Senate seat.Shut up Dan!
I don’t know WTF your response even means, but I’m assuming you agree that both Trump and Biden are horrible, right?
And Biden would likely be one term, don’t you think?
I wonder how long Joe Biden will keep us waiting before he reveals he chose George W. Bush as his VP pick?
The Latest Polling: Trump is losing every swing state!  GOP are you watching your party disappear before your eyes? If your grand strategy is stopping people from voting, you already lost!!!
If Biden wins he should extend the time once he takes office. Time to steamroll over the cheaters.
So it's out no more calling us conspiracy nut jobs lol we are another step closer to proving the left is the party of pure evil #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica #Biden is a mush brained dumbass who is so obviously being put there as a puppet it should be a side show #fighttheleft
Joe Biden wrote the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act - Clinton signed off on it:  #1994CrimeBill  Bill Clinton's crime bill destroyed lives, and there's no point denying it
Louder for my liberal, woke, BLM supporting, Biden loving, Christian hating and pro-choice friends
Joe Biden is a dement Dummy Joe Biden is very leftish Joe Biden will be a danger for the entire world
Joe Biden will get the COVID-19 under control,  can't wait.
Are mail in ballots how the Republicans have retained control of Ohio?  #WeWillVote #HumanityFirst New Yahoo News/YouGov poll: Most Trump voters say they will not accept the 2020 results if Biden wins because of mail-in ballots
Hunter Biden got $83G per month for Ukraine 'ceremonial' gig: report
Dude come out the basement and shine your fifth place trophies.    There’s a real world out there.   Joe Biden got no shot.   3 time loser.   Tell mommy hello for me.   NO SHOT joe Biden.   Really.
Trump will be lucky to win Florida, nonetheless Texas
Who the fuck cares about a supreme court justice. Biden voted for Clarance Thomas and denied her sexual assault. You really think Biden is going to be a forefront of change?
“Hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47. We're not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore." -Beto O’Rourke. “ OR this one from Biden ABOUT Beto: “take care of the gun problem, you’re going to be the one who leads this effort”
I've seen some people post that Biden is incompetent and has dementia. I can't rap my head around that logic.  Even if Biden does, I at least trust he won't flat out lie and that congress and the administration won't support those lies.  Look at positivity rate, this is debunked.

Joe Biden is expected to announce pick his running mate next week; all perceived frontrunners check the box for pro-abortion &amp; the LGBT agenda.  Given Mr. Biden issues with age and mental acuity, his VP choice is heir apparent, should he win in November.
No. That was a fake document used in the Epstein documentary. The actual witnesses are referred to as Jane Doe 1, Jane Doe 2, and Jane Doe 3.
I’ll have to wait 4 years to get a house if trump gets elected agin or 2 months if Biden some how wins 😂
Do not tell me that with these ridiculous games you want to vote for Biden!!!🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️By doing this, you are betraying America, you idiot #trump2020
Let's talk about Dear Leader's kids... #DumpTrump2020 #TrumpIsALaughingStock #JoeBidenJob #Biden
This could be right. Let Biden do the dirty work while they attack him for it. They will all certainly again become deficit hawks on Jan. 20.
But the Coronavirus is not going to get better before the election. The economy is not going to get better before the election. Trump’s mental decline is not going to get any better - EVER. This is NOT a regular election cycle. NOTHING that they throw at Biden is going to work.
i’ll be a damn fool to vote for joe biden
I’m Republican voting for Biden!  This country desperately needs better leadership to get us on our feet again!
Haha burn.  I can't even imagine how bad our economy will be under a biden presidency.  It will be 2015 crash all over again.
Your side cheated it’s ass and still loss.   4 years later your still mad and you come up with joe Biden.   Joe even you gotta know he can’t win.   He will be a 3 time loser.  Sad he’s the best y’all got. #gotnoshot.  Maga
Reality and history disprove this biden conspiracy. Shokin was ousted in 2014, with gop support (ironically ron johnson cosigned the letter) and the EU. The gop spent 2yrs on benghazi/emails. Trumps DOJ nvr opened an investigation for the last 3.5yrs. Bc biden did nothing wrong
Please Dr Fauci is just trying to slow this ghost virus down we need to work with him not against him ppl better wake up if Biden dies wins by cheating America will burn to the ground and the dam stunt evil Obama used a dead man for political agenda is Despicable call pass this o
If I were you, I wouldn't admit to voting for Trump, either. You must be furious that he's making his supporters look like such gullible chumps. I'm so sorry for you.  Don't worry about me. I'll be voting for Biden and I'm not a coward who's afraid to admit who I voted for.
Biden allies try to wreck Kamala Harris' vice presidential chances with tired, sexist attacks
And STILL no Biden signs anywhere!! Think they’ll figure out how badly they’re flaming out before November? 😂
The Future of American Liberalism
And you think Biden can win when he doesn’t even know where he is and he’s run 3 times and is a joke. You finally came out of the closet and endorcing him! OMG What a joke and you know damn well that he can’t be president! He can’t even complete a sentence!
She’s just making an assumption she knows is not true that she hopes will stick to some undecided dumb people.  Imagine how terrible you have to be to get beat by Joe Biden. 🤣🤣
Biden's Lies for Black (and White-Privilege Guilt) Votes
The economy was booming up until Covid. Honestly, can you picture Joe Biden running things.  I think it would Jill making the decisions.
A former two-term president can't be VP, but I don't know of any law that says a former First Lady can't be VP. How does Biden/Michelle Obama sound?
This is from April 24th.
Joe Biden might have to answer a question, he doesn’t know anyone died and he can’t leave the basement.
It might turn into a s**t show.  I think General Milley would likely side with Biden.
But vote for Biden who will be 86 in second term   😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wrong!!  Keep campaigning to be Biden’s VP. How hypocritical since you called him a racist. But then integrity has never been your strong suit.
John Lewis fought the segregationist policies of Woodrow Wilson whose legacy Joe Biden - Wilson 2.0 - fought to continue throughout his career.
Things change, trump USED to be slim and fit like Biden..........
"The poor kids are just as smart as the white kids" -Joe Biden. "If you don't vote for me, you ain't black" Joe Biden. Yea those aren't racist comments at all.
Kennedy’s a liar. He knows the moderates and progressives are in a heated fight over Biden’s platform and the moderates are winning. He knows Biden is not going to #DefundThePolice He says all this cuz he knows Hannity’s audience doesnt pay attention to details of Party platforms
I’m still scratching my head trying to figure out how Joe Biden even got the nomination when there were so many better, younger candidates. 🤷‍♂️
Pro-abortion groups have endorsed Joe Biden because his support for abortion is "compassionate."   By what standard have we decided that elective abortion is "compassionate”?
My scotch consumption has risen with each year of the rRump presidency. My liver will certainly appreciate the Biden presidency.
Unfortunately, no. If Biden were to die or become incapacitated, Obama would become president for an unconstitutional 3rd term. However, J Q Adams served in Congress, and W Taft on the Supreme Court after their presidencies, I believe.
U.S. Sen. James Inhofe put his phone to his ear when Trump called him the other day in a capitol hill restaurant, but left it on speaker. Nearby patrons heard the conversation, and one recorded it
JOE BIDEN 2020 PRESIDENTIAL RUN THEME SONG  via
Vote Biden. WE VIBIN'
Are you going to apologize to Biden? You do realize which side the conspiracies are running rampant on right?
Hunter Biden is a private US citizen. Your dad’s illegal effort to have him investigated by a foreign government failed. The press looked into his background &amp; found NOTHING. Now it’s time for YOU to be investigated. #trumpCrimeFamily
This is a totally normal tweet from the President of the United States during a once in a century pandemic and the worst economic news in the country's history. TOTALLY NORMAL. #DumpTrump #TrumpIsUnwell #TrumpIsANationalSecurityThreat #JoeBidenJob #Biden
Like, they’re trying to appeal to actual supporters of fucking FASCISM. While they do that, they go farther and father to the right and inevitably have the same policies as Trump does.  Even BIDEN called for the arrest of “anarchists”, ffs.
FOR REAL LMAOOO i follow conservative media closely just to see what they think about us and it’s sooooo fucking insane.  That Joe Biden is a communist, that even the most “centrist” democrats are communists.  Truly insane
I would much rather be under trump than biden
Warren is the better pick if they want to win, which is why Biden will pick Harris.
Susan Rice isn’t a unrealistic pick, she’s closest to Biden out of any candidate
It is no coincidence this recession began when biden wrapped of the democrat primary.   The markets are just reacting and showing us how devastating a democrat presidency would be.
Biden/ Nadless &amp; Biden/Cuomo! Other than that? Nope! 😂
I challenge anyone to post a clip of this #MSNBC shill asking JUST ONE Democrat member of Congress if they are a paid Biden spokesperson.
The one picture that's really Biden is him kissing a relative, who's the other guy you're trying to pass off as him? Doesn't even look like Joe, crank up your photoshop🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 BTW, I don't have to Photoshop pictures of trump with ivanka. I just don't have the stomach to post.
Twitter is ONCE AGAIN NOT POSTING MY TWEETS ABOUT BIDEN. It’s not hateful or dangerous. #RegulateTechIndustryNOW
Anyone else constantly depressed that this woman was passed over for Joe Fucking Biden
Louisiana!! And FYI, there are NO Biden yard signs but LOTS of Trump ones, much like the rest of the Country. 😂
Do the right thing. Endorse Biden.
Ask her about the yard signs &amp; bumper stickers in her area! So far multiple people across the Country are reporting NO Biden signs but plenty of Trump! 😂
Taped four shows today and five next week, whew! But these stories need to be told. Two families, one white and one black, both with children killed by blue. And a CPA and investment advisor join me to dissect Joe Biden's financial plan. Watch the shows via the link in my bio!
What’s the plan?  Let me guess, strike the girls hair Biden??!?!  Please tel me y’all got something else up your sleeve...... oh I almost forgot, KANYE!!!!
Joe Biden/Michelle ObamaWe don't need Good Ole Ben to tell us this. We already know it would happen.
Why do you keep bringing up Biden? I have never once said Biden would make a good president.
Good morning, America! How are the Democrat's and Biden and the others promising to destroy America today?
just out of curiosity, does Chris Wallace get paid extra to defend Biden? His comments this morning showed his bias against Trump. He was asked about Biden’s comments yet his answer was basically...”yeah but Trump...” (paraphrasing) 🙄
Biden faces backlash over racial diversity remark  Okay so one politician made a comment that makes you say "What?"|
Joe Biden know he is joke and he doing for his son to become President! Hunter Biden is crook like Democratic Congress look left side! Cheater! Joe Biden can’t beat President Trump at Debates! Joe prove it willing Debates President or chicken 💩!
Aren’t you kidding me! I’m voting for President Donald Trump! Why all Staion’s News, begging Joe Biden vs President Trump Debates because Little Joe Biden can’t handle it because Joe is a disgraceful dishonest Vp Democratic ! except Fox News! Demo Congress knew Biden broke LAWS!
Biden should say NO. Let Trump beg...
Biden is a Marxist just like everyone on your Racist network
You just said "Acts of immorality, or personal failings, don't disqualify a person." So Joe Biden's moral faults don't matter at all.
It's called the "Ross Perot Tactic". Go for it Bro. The Dem's play dirty. You play Dirtier. I called it. 👍👍Give it back at em.
So, according to your reasoning, the practicing Catholic Joe Biden would also be an instrument of God were he elected.
Biden was against Roe vs Wade when it first passed, primarily because of his Catholic upbringing. He changed his public opinion for political reasons. Trump was pro-Choice in 2000 before he decided to run for office; he changed his public opinion for political reasons.
"Walter" is saying what his "Jeff Dunham" is telling him to say. Because we/you know they don't even like each. No "Romancing the Stone" here.
please tell Juan that Biden is not a true catholic if he is pro abortion period
True. Not since Bush Sr. unless you count the National Guard. But Trump's "bone spur" deferrals were B.S. Biden's were for asthma, which wasn't much better. Just goes to show, it's a big club, and you &amp; I aren't in it.
let’s be clear  that’s not what Biden wants. that’s what the majority of my generation wants. it’ll come eventually, and i’m so glad you’ll still be alive to see it :)
This election, the Great American travel camper will be rolled to the voting site parking lot.   It not called “waiting in line” when your drinking  a beer.   Biden Tailgate 2020

Did Joe Biden make a post on your account?
Kanges West can run for office to siphone votes from Biden but an unknown girl from Tecas will get in BIG TROUBLE CUZ SHE IS AN OUTSIDER? Okay.... WE WILL SEE WHO IS THE ROGUE OREACHER AND WHONIS THE ROGUE DEEPSTATE. Tivk to the Tovk you Dumb Dummies!!!!
Well, it looks like he did say it. Well, we know Crackhead Hunter is one. This is why they Don't let him out of the basement or off his leash. Just imagine a debate where Trump would and will set him off. The Ehrman Rests.
Joe Biden believes he should follow, “stay home and be safe.”  🤔 Isn’t he campaigning for POTUS? I would think POTUS would be considered an “essential position. 🤷‍♂️
I don’t understand how anyone has any confidence in a joe biden presidency. How did we get to the point in which two geriatrics are chosen to lead the free world / have sole authority to enact a nuclear strike? #Election2020 #Unity2020
Biden because he missed the boat. He couldn't remember where it was docked. Maybe Obama? Because 💩floats and it's been scientifically proven. Maybe Clinton. Because she threatened everyone with "Suicide" if they didn't save her. 👍
When President Trump promise improve our future, Military, Mexico Border Wall, cut jobs regulation! On on than any President do their jobs! Biden failed to USA! Biden’s pocket to his family, Democratic Congress!
Biden is joke plus Sanders, AOC is under Biden’s ear! Immigrants free Medicare insurance, Medicare for all! Record is President Obama’s USA proverty includes black, USA, homeless! Biden, Obama paid 1.5 billion dollars to Iran! It’s should be USA Citizens!
Vote President Trump! President Trump is only one pull our Corporate factory back to USA, stronger Military, Military is nbr 2 in Nation! Biden will drain out for China! China make Biden’s pocket like Ukraine for his Hunter pocket riches! Not USA future!
Joe Biden wouldn’t face Chris Wallace’s Fox News! Second Biden want President Trump’s personal agreement but Biden’s Ukraine with his son Hunter’s illegal plus his father as well tied to President Obama’s cabinet! Biden will choke vs President Trump!
This Stelter has to be related to someone at CNN for real, to even have job. They must keep around for comic relief. The man is a true "Ding Dong".
She's in the Lead because she is the closet Flunky to Obama and that's what "The Neferious Forces" doing the picking want and oh yeah she's a Threat Alright.
Vote President Trump! Vp Biden is disgraceful dishonest liars for President! Wake up!
I didn't watch. Has Biden's talking Head do "his" interview yet?
Well when the argument is that Biden is “incoherent at best” and pointing out “gaffes” maybe wait a little while and not directly after Trump was shown struggling to read at a 3rd grade level.
Joe Biden will have to do that.
He's more then ducking. He's hunkered down more in his basement then Adolph was in his Bunker in Berlin near the end. We know he's weak. Ari Flishcer  pegged it last night on Hannity.
We have become a nation that turns on people for speaking truth.  How will we turn this around?  Yes vote Biden but I’m afraid we may have reached a point of no return.  I hate being a pessimist.
Why did you say you were voting for Biden???? Can’t be true!! Must have not heard you correctly!!
Biden assails Trump's 'bald-faced lies' about voting by mail  What was that again dude?
Trump will use emergency powers to remain in the White House if he loses election, warns House majority whip
I want to see a debate between  and  more than a debate Trump and Biden, because Trump doesn't debate, he stalks and attacks, and we all know that already.
Me: Project Monarch is real. The elite are using trauma-based mind control on children in order to program them. This directly relates to Epstein and all the pedogate related news.  Them: Hey man, that’s crazy. Vote Biden because he’s the lesser of two evils.
If you're trying to make the point that "All Democrats Bad" and therefore Biden is bad, then you missed a fundamental part of my argument and my perspective about how all this works.
That won't happen for several reasons. One he's already stepped on it with his pandering and patronizing. Two: there isn't anyone qualified for the position, including him and three: We don't want or need him. He's done enough damage.
What an embarrassment it would be “if” Joe Biden was elected President.  He wouldn’t even be able to find his way to the White House.
Because Joe Biden’s campaign know Joe Biden will flunked interview! Joe’s sucks everything feed back from Bernie Sanders, AOC
The Joe Biden presidency.
Bad News For Universal Studios Orlando!  via  Wait until after the election if Silver Main Biden gets selected. It will go poof.
We have very little time to overturn satan's structure of evil control that SPYGATE has worked on since 2009. If enough of the Electoral College is "persuaded", so to speak, to vote Biden in, America will be headed down a dark path. I pray that I can never prove this to be true.
Whoever Biden carefully picks will be MUCH better than who we have now. Pence is spineless and tRump is a lying crook who is only looking out for himself. If you love your country, you will vote for the best and decent man, Joe Biden. We cannot have 4 more years of this insanity!
It’s the “settle for Biden” for me
No, but you are talking about Trump while showing Biden telling a story about how he was onboard with State Department policy.
Right!? Biden hasn't done anything to earn my vote. Just because "he not Trump" or "vote blue no matter what" doesn't cut it. I want someone with great policies. Biden is just the blue version of Trump.
You better rethink support for Trump because the left with Biden wants to take Jesus away from the people, make it "offensive" to others to publicly worship Jesus, or to keep in schools. They'd rather teach islamic faith than Christian...insanity
Biden has gone through self esteem issues with his stutter and the loss of his son and I think those experiences make him more empathetic and human.
Attorney General when President Biden is sworn in?   is top on my list!
Still better than Biden
The former since the Democrats will do anything to get Silver Mane I mean Joe Biden POTUS.
I have only voted once in my 40 year life. Obama’s first presidency. I wanted to see a black man as President.   I will be casting the second vote of my life this year.   For Biden.
Excellent! Keep imploding.
Whom ever they pick for him. It will have to be a woman of color, or they will be all over him after saying that he would pick one. All that pandering and patronizing for naught.
If you’re willing to vote for Biden and destroy my community and the values of the people: WE AINT FRIENDS
You're welcome!  Now go vote for Biden! ;-}
Exactly my point. Let’s be quick to accuse but patient before exonerating anyone. Joe Biden, Donald Trump, not even Santa Claus has impunity.   Anyone &amp; Everyone Needs to be brought to Justice.
It's pretty sad when Obama has to use the funeral to campaign for Joe Biden.I bet John Lewis was honored to be  able to provide the spotlight for Obama to campaign for Joe Biden.I know the Dems are desperate, but this is disrespectful. Biden could not talk for himself?
Sad when they have to campaign for Biden at a Funeral.  I'm sure John Lewis felt so honored to be the spotlight for Joe Biden's Campaign.  Way to go you low life Demonrats.
He did that's why Mr.obama is the best president ever lived in the white House.And Biden will get his chance to do just that to be the Greatest
Tell me about Biden.
yea Biden is trying to steal it. Ass hole.
Don’t blame Trump blame the Communist who made us want change,you know one of them running for President this year Biden
I don’t worry about Biden one bit. He is a kind man who will surround himself with smart &amp; competent people with the common goal of putting America, her people and the environment first. Plus RBG can retire with peace of mind. I’m not worried AT ALL;I am happily in Joe’s camp!
Trump Keeps Attacking Biden For His Gaffes, But Has A Fair Share Of His ...  via

Mr. President  , any thoughts on corrupt, racist, slave-owning  as Biden's running mate?😂😂 #MAGA2020 #KAG2020
"Biden has officially committed to participating in the three scheduled presidential debates -- and Biden has repeatedly said he is eager to debate Trump even if the pandemic forces them to hold the event online rather than in person."
I think the correct word would be "Horrific", not historic. Biden and his little Socialist/Communist darling will put us back into the horse and buggy ages.
President Trump is the most pro-life President we’ve ever had. Did you know that Biden and Harris both support abortion for any reason up until birth. You might want to reconsider who Biden really is.
As in, if Biden was Trump he would take a marker to cross out anyone who didn’t vote for him on the map
I call this “If Biden was Trump”
Yeah, actually it is.  Life itself is the single issue, for without it all other right don’t exist.  Their is a hierarchy of right and life is first and foundational. Voting for Biden would be a mortal sin
If your for Biden then your wrong
NO MAIL-IN-BALLOTS.  Dems in office 30 years plus but Donald is the problem?  Chuck Schumer, 39 years in office - Nancy Pelosi, 33 years in office - Maxine Waters, 29 years in office - Joe Biden, 45 years in office - Bernie Sanders, 35 years in office - Donald Trump, 3 years
Someone needs to put Biden’s head on him STAT.

During a briefing by public health experts in Wilmington, Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, told reporters that all the nation's governors should require this.
No. I also never here anyone give a reason to support Biden other than against Trump.
Has anyone told Joe Biden he’s running for President?
So what's to say if we have mail in ballots that some post office man or woman can't steal 300 ballots and select Joe Biden?
Friendly reminder: There’s an information war going on right now. Twitter censors Trump’s tweets, but let Kamala and Biden blatantly lie on this platform.  .....and nobody’s doing a damn thing about it
You know damn well of we have mail in votes all someone has to do is steal the ballots and put a check mark by Biden
Too bad Biden/Harris wants to take it away and raises taxes! I really want to see them take away our right to bear arms
Now do Biden.
Whatever lady. You sound like a Trumper. I’m a proud Biden-Harris supporter Democrat . I’m sure they wouldn’t relish the fact that sickness has fallen on their opponents brother.
I’m an African-American female Democrat! I support Biden-Harris. Why do you keep saying that like it will make it true. I just expressed decency for another human being, his brother. I don’t like Trump.
You point is? The Biden's, Romney's, and Obama have stolen Billions from taxpayers.
Wow! I hope you someone shows mercy to you when you need it. I agree with you about Trump, but I’m not going to wish harm on anyone. 😢I’m for Biden but I still pray for Trump to have change in his heart  as well. #lightindarkness
Your other option is TRUMP/PENCE. The flaming hot cheeto devil and milk toast bread. If they get reelected they will burn this country to the ground. I don't care for Biden/Harris either, but I'd rather them because I think we can pressure them for policies we want.
Along with Biden..🤙🏻🇺🇸
Thays right Joe Biden is a liar and under indictment in the Ukraine
Biden isn't choosing anything himself......except what kind of pudding he's spoon fed
Yall get on my last damn nerve talking about this election. You’re either voting for Biden or not. All this BS talk about “why even bother; it’s already a lost cause.” Makes me fucking sick.
Is Biden coloring between the lines?
An Absentee ballot is different, Biden staffer
I’ve volunteered to make calls and texts for Biden campaign.  Bc I am in your boat too.
Elect Bill Clinton so Poppy Bush and Bob Dole won't hurt progressives any longer.  Elect Bill Clinton again so Dole-Kemp won't hurt progressives worse.  Elect Obama so McCain-Palin won't hurt progressives  Re-Elect Obama so Romney-Ryan won't hurt progressives  Re-Elect Biden so..
Sanders is less a fascist than Biden or Copmala or Hillary, but without a strong Indy Left to hold him accountable, even if he was elected POTUS he would nevertheless be pressured to enact fascist policy or get himself run.   It's not the players, it's the game.
Voting for  who does not, unlike Biden-Harris or Trumpster-Pence, support abandoning working people for cannon fodder of the 1%.  Also, building an Indy Left to replace the whole system.
But of course, even Cornel West ultimately succumbs to the "Gotta elect Biden-Harris to stop Trumpster!!!" bandwagon, because it's much more profitable to ride a mainstream bandwagon than to actually fight for radical change.  Again...  #NoOneWillSaveUsBUTUS
This is why Biden ultimately settled on nominating Copmala.  She gets the #HillbotPUMAs to whitewash what was soft Left opposition to Biden's politics, and neuters the Indy Left.  Hence, we get this apologia and tribute in response to NeoCON Louise Mensch.
Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden’s campaign likened Trump's comments and actions as "sabotage."
Sorry, but even if Kamala isn't what the Right is claiming her to be, she's still a neoliberal cop who opposes sex workers and jails poor Blacks.  You want to vote for her and Biden to stop Trumpster? Be my guest.  Don't flame on us Black Indy Leftists who choose other means.
If you want to tell me that we should only back Biden/Harris to stop Trumpster, then you damn well better also be backing Leftists in power replacing wingnuts and "centrists".   Otherwise, get outta my TL.
Oh yeah why did y'all pick Kamala Harris as VP for Joe Biden. She didn't do well in running for president. She didn't even bother to register in my State primary. My opinion they should of pick Bernie Sanders as VP running mate. Cause he was number 2 in primary well that's y'all
Them at all which is proven true just in this Twitter feed. Joe Biden blatantly lied to you yesterday about Charlottesville. I can debunk everything he said with a Transcript. They know you won't fact check them. All you see is Orange man bad like your in a deep hypnosis
Let’s not forget that literal members of the U.S. military came out with video evidence of U.F.O. ‘s; and that celebrities are sexually abusing kids. But by all means let’s talk about Donald Trump and Joe Biden👌🏻
I continue to be sickened, appalled, &amp; alarmed by not only Biden, but the parents that let their children near this man. As a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, I can tell you all the red flags are there!

Uh no, he ignored and moved on. But Trump unlike Biden answers all questions and never whys away. Poor Biden is not allowed to answer
No it's going to be a verbal bloodbath when Trump. ahnilates  Biden in debate and it will be the same when Pence debates "heels up" Harris.

Honestly this tweet can literally be an attack for Biden, Trump, Kamala, AND pence and that’s just sad
Joe Biden isn't even qualified to be a greeter at Walmart at this point. And Kamala needs to work in Las Vegas  doing the only thing she's good at.
Trump and Biden are both bus driver. Biden has purposely ran over a black person and said nothing. Trump has purposely ran over a black person and yelled our "20 points"
Biden should have law enforcement at the ready for the day of his inaug. to literally round up these traitorous hypocrits &amp; arrest them all.
Joe Biden declares a mandate by the federal government for you to wear a mask for at least three months if not indefinitely. Are you OK with this? Are you going to be OK when they mandate you must get the vaccine or you will not be able to buy, sell, trade, or go out in public?
How is she able to work at Fox and work for the Biden campaign at same time. Conflict???

wipe up.  Good luck Biden and Kamala.
Joe Biden can sure kiss my ass too. Fuck outta here with that shit

Joe Biden doesn't even remember what confidence means
Me: trying to explain to my parents what a pos Biden &amp; Harris are  My parents: automatically assuming I like trump &amp; pence   No, I dislike them all equally. Y I gotta pick sides. Let me see the bad in all of them.

That sounds like Biden would defer to the states &amp; municipalities on direct relief, &amp; would limit federal aid to either tax credits (expanded EITC or child care) or an accrued fund that locals/states would be able to tap to distribute such funds, limited by "deficit concerns".
Since Biden has publicly said previously that he opposes even the basic idea of #UBI because he prefers that the only means of earning income should be a job, I would assume that he's a solid "NO" on this.
We’ve imagined more things that are complete and total bullshit in the last 3 months than Joe Biden and Barack Obama did in their 8 years in office.
If they are threatening him, doesn’t Biden have secret service protection from his time as VP?
But I thought Biden was already the reincarnation of Marx, Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Fidel, and Che all wrapped into one. She pushes him even more to the left? Really?  #KamalaHarrisVP #BidenHarris2020 #GOP #AmericaOrTrump

You better send that to Biden; he just mangled her name, too.
Trump has pretty much eliminated daily intelligence briefings. Biden has already started receiving them.
In another year this might not be a plus, but kinda digging the ASMR quality of Joe Biden's speach.
*clears throat* YALL THE PLAN IS TO BE REALISTIC, KANYE IS NOT GOING TO WIN, A VOTE THAT IS NOT FOR JOE BIDEN IS A VOTE FOR TRUMP, AT THIS RATE WE WILL NEVER GET THIS CHEETO IN CHIEF OUT OF OFFICE!!!!!
Did Biden just use false lies to enforce his election? Charlottesville???!!! Wow. This is the wackiest speech ever.
Biden is screwed.
Wow, they really think that violence and destruction will convince people to vote Biden/Kamala, if the people want it to stop.
It’s sad to say but I’ll take ye over trump and Biden 😂

What is so funny and completely ironic about this tweet is that this is how Biden wanted to intergrate schools.  He supported integration through housing and not forced federal busing, but some nut job created a meme that not only misquotes Biden on federal busing programs, but
I see these comments, and I'm wondering are all you people who is looking for Jesus Christ at the polls going still let Trump run us into the ground. I'm not a fan of Biden or Harris, but Trump has fucked up sports, school, taxes, had the military attack civilians etc. #GTFOTRUMP
you think Biden beats Trump? No way possible. if they wanted a fair fight they would have let Bernie run against him. instead they made him drop out and “advise”.
Donald Trump gone beat Joe Biden by a landslide. May be the most lopsided victory in the history of the US. Do with that information what you will.
Did he just say that Biden was racist?? OMG!!!!!👀👀😂😂😂😂
Yet another reason . is a fake candidate trying to sabotage the election for Trump. It can't be any more obvious. Hey Kanye, have you been arrested for #ElectionFraud yet since you faked signatures to get on ballots?
prettier w/ a mask on #NewProfilePic  also Bernie 2020 now means Biden 2020
Kamala is gonna plant some weed on Biden and have him arrested
Friendly reminder: Clinton/Kaine were better candidates than Biden/Harris   #facts
Still haven’t met one person in real life that’s voting for Biden. I have met many people that voted for Hillary that are now voting for Trump. #KAG 🇺🇸
second thoughts on kamala: biden saw her as a safe, centrist choice and the republicans wouldn’t be able to say his administration was the gateway to a socialist america, but they would have done it with any one of the picks so why not go big?
So.....The defund the police side picked two cops - Biden and Harris - to lead them to victory?   You can’t make this stuff up, it’s 2020 y’all   🤯
Joe Biden couldn't have secret service assign women to his detail because he would grope them or purposely walk around naked in the VP house when Jill wasn't around and he owns Waters island next to Epstein's island with similar set up.
Trump's Unholy Cult, has no legs to stand on in this argument. Biden Is Catholic
not to mention biden knows he aint got the gas to hold out for four years so he KNOWS at some point kamala will be taking over. just preemptively putting a cop in charge of a nation actively fighting a police-state
"biden is electable! we just need to worry abt the centrist/right leaning vote!" *major historical events radicalize entire nation into leftists* *leftists dont vote for biden* "no wait" maybe he was never electable to begin with, and the only person to blame is dems themselves.
wheres all the leftist tweets abt how months of saying "biden is the electability candidate" was going on explicitly so that when biden lost the election due to not being electable at all they could then place the blame on leftists/bernie supporters bc i JUST saw it happen

Not trying to be too political but are Republicans seriously throwing shade at Kamala for what she said regarding Biden while in the same breath applauding folks like Cruz and Graham who said much harsher things about Trump only to become permanently attached to his sphincter?
Yet Biden stumbles, mumbles and fumbles through statements and interviews time and again, and you utter not a word.
Someone is quaking in their shoes! We all know how terrified Impeached 45 is of strong women. Now we know he is beyond terrified by a strong black woman. One that will lead w/Biden and put this country back on the right track. It's up to us not to abandon them as we did w/Obama

Guess we know where you stand with Biden......Benghazi got ya, bitch!
Of course Biden chose a fucking cop as VP during the most anti-cop year. What a embarrassment
Fuck. That.  There will be NO Left influence in a  Biden-Harris admin, if they manage to even win. This is closer to Bill Clinton's 3rd term than Barack Obama's 2nd.  Leave this party behind and build our own.  #DemExit
The big takeaway I got from this, is that if the Dems win, she may well become the defacto leader of the Democratic party, especially considering Biden has referred to himself as a "transition" candidate multiple times.
Joe Biden selects Kamala Harris as his running mate
That's the ticket: Joe Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris as his 2020 vice presidential running mate
Yall know Biden died in February and is a hologram, right?
Ben Shapiro can say what he wants but that doesn’t mean everyone is convinced by it. It’s really hard to paint Biden as a radical Marxist and centrist voters don’t buy it.
The Democrats that are jumping up and down praising this pick are out of line. We had plenty of chances to pick someone who can win and displays democratic values but no, we pick Biden and Harris. A serial groper and a woman of color who locks up black men for misdemeanors.
So Biden picked the absolute weakest possible running mate great nbd
Y’all fail to realize kamala the most aggressive to help Biden win. Either you wanna keep trump or deal with what the man picked. Fk what y’all talking bout.
Biden picked his running mate, but I’m sure that didn’t come as a surprise

Only positive about Copmala is that her recent advocacy for recurring $2K checks didn't disqualify her with Uncle Joe and the ruling right-wing establishment of the Democrats.  Problem is, she's still a cop. And....an sworn enemy of sex workers.  And a perfect foil for Biden.

Actually, Dore is partially sort of correct, since Biden himself has not really explicitly endorsed the #HeroesAct's provisions. We don't really know if he favors $600/wk up to January or not.
Of freedom and no puppet president which is why the DNC has picked Joe Biden .
No more and more people realize how Biden is mentally unfit for any office due to 2 surgeries for brain aneurisms back in the 80s. And the DNC are using him to handpick a president with the VP running mate.
Because I know they are rigged in favor of Biden . Plus when only 20 people attended a rally pre pandemic and the same amount watch a virtual one. Plus all y'all 🌊accounts work for Twitter.

When pressed by Errol Barnett of CBS News on whether he’d taken a cognitive test, Biden responded that the question was akin to asking the Black reporter if he would take a drug test to see if “you’re taking cocaine or not? ... Are you a junkie?”
No but they actually let him tweet and he suggested Trump is going to mine  Uranium in the Grand Canyon. Mark it Joe Biden officially lost his mind today and is mentally unfit .

Even totally dunk I can give you ideas that Joe Biden is a Bad idea to vote for. At least you know what you are getting with Trump. 🤔 Bottom line your not electing Joe Biden to be president just what ever deep State that can control Joe Biden.
If Joe Biden is practicing his Catholicism, I would suggest he get a new coach, because he’s obviously singing from the wrong Psaltar

Poor thing can’t handle what you dish roflmao btw I didn’t hear your complaint about Obama turning a funeral into a Biden/Dem rally
We really do have a defeatist attitude. Where’s your dignity, brotha? Biden said what he said because he knows we’re have his back, no matter what. This is weak
So your still in Support of Joe Biden no matter what. I can prove that Trump not a Racist you can't do that for Joe Biden.
Joe Biden know that no matter what he say or do black people still gone vote for him just because we not voting for Trump. it’s so sick
Democratic voters are eager to hear who former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, will pick to be his running mate.
1) They don't really care.  2) They think that with Biden in control and pulling the Democrats even further to the Right, they're safe to attack in '24.  3) They will rig the election, or simply ignore it. See Wisconsin.
They really don’t have to do anything, Biden himself is doing all the work for them..

Joe Biden was 10 years old when the state of Delaware banned public whipping.  Not sure whether this says more about Biden's age or how fucked up Delaware is.
why can’t we have someone making this kind of sense working on Biden’s campaign? Sigh
Aren't we getting a little ahead of ourselves here? She's the Democrat nominee for vice-president, and to project her as the front-runner for 2024 - or something happening to Biden is just speculating without tangible backup
Joe Biden should nominate Hillary Clinton to be the next Attorney General.
Only a coward sacrifices the future for immediate short term relief. If Biden wins we extend the neolib status quo at least another decade &amp; remind all the Obama/Trump voters why they switched leading to Trump 2.0 - better to suck up 4 more years &amp; get real change in 2024.
I have not seen one Biden bumper sticker, yard sign, shirts, hats or anything.   And when I ask my liberal friends what they like about him, I don’t get one reply.
So......another local tv station showing their never Trump side, why don’t you see why Biden won’t or can’t answer any questions? Huh?
I’m voting for her more than Biden.
BBC News - US 2020: Biden campaign says Trump 'abhorrent' for fuelling Harris conspiracy
Nope never too late, we always need more medics  Also a wild card, unsure of whether a Biden administration would roll back the Trump administration's policy or also shooting medics, or if that would continue. Given Obama's handling of Occupy I'm not optimistic but who knows
That's wild! She looked exactly, and I mean EXACTLY, like Joe Biden that whole time she was Obama's VP. WAIT. IF SHE CAN DO THAT, WE WILL NEVER KNOW IF ITS HER OR BIDEN IF THEY WIN!!!!  THAT'S F'D UP!!! 🔁🔀💥‼️
To be fair Biden is a Democrat, and given that Democrats cave to fucking everyone else he might be somewhat more likely to cave to the demands of the coming climate riots
In short, if you don't have the votes to get a Congress that can enact M4A, then there would be nothing Biden could do in order to implement it anyway.
I mean I wish Biden supported M4A. Maybe people who support M4A could elect a congress that would pass the bill and put it on his desk (with assurances it would be paid for, which was his requirement)   That doesn't mean I am not voting for him.
Kamala Harris and Joe Biden could do a live Internet donkey show, as a fundraiser, at this point, and I'm still voting for them.
Thanks for the shout out 🙂

That is not an answer. The post office has been down down down for over 20 years.  Obama/Biden did nothing.  Now all of a sudden it’s trump Trump trump!! So weird.  Do Democrats actually believe that people don’t see this? 🤔
also he intends to replace a physical border trump wants with a (more) hyper surveilled border, and intends to only end *for profit* detention centers of migrants. fuck Joe Biden

It's a sign!! Democracy will prevail...after Biden wins.
WE ALL KNOW THAT BIDEN IS DOODLING ON THE PAPERS IN FRONT OF HIM.
Hey mark!!! Why didn't Obama/Biden fix the post office 3 1/2 years ago? Bet I dont get a response. 🙄
Yes.  Why didn't Obama/biden fix it 3 1/2 yrs ago?
Perhaps it's because Biden and the dems aren't properly reaching out to those voters?  Bernie in 2016, tulsi, and yang, all were able to speak to them better.   Villifying them, lecturing to them about privilege, etc, doesn't get those voters on our side.
Or Biden,  that would be like the walking dead! Haha
Nope. Joe Biden did some things too. I don't like everything any president did in his personal life, I just know he has done more to help this country than most of them.

The difference here is that  “requested” a ballot, which request comes after certain protocol(s) are met and the ballot is registered. It is not the result of a “mass mailing.” C’mon, Mr. Biden, you’re misleading the public.  MASS MAILINGS are not legal nor safe.  🇺🇸USA🇺🇸

I can't believe somebody tried to use  Assata as a justification for voting for Biden in my mentions
Trump is not right of Reagan. Bushes were moderates, just like Clinton. Old Biden was moderate, but this isn't his policies. He's completely controlled by the progressive Marxist faction of the party now. And Biden's way more corrupt than Trump.
You are right except you can't vote for Joe Biden right? 🤔😭😂

Sick to death of being lectured about this. 1. I always vote, even in the other not popular elections. 2. I live in Louisiana. Trump has this state easily even with a fully operational postal system. 3. If Biden loses it's 💯 on the Democrats hands for appeasing the rich.
I wanted Tammy Duckworth. That boat has sailed so now I'm on Warship Biden/Harris😀
Racial tension is already here. If someone wears a "Biden" shirt he has nothing to fear any where in the country. If I wear a "MAGA" hat in many major cities I run the risk of being physically assaulted.

Biden and Harris are NOT allowed to enter the noble career of butchery!
Listen, I KNOW. Biden/Harris isn't the ticket we wanted. But this November if you want to prevent the WORST CRISIS we have EVER SEEN you NEED to engage in mass civil disobedience and disrupt all of society   Oh yeah and I guess if you're in a swing state try voting or whatever
I've also seen that bus analog about a hundred times too and I want to snarkily retort with "Well Joe Biden didn't believe in bussing"
Vote for Biden if you don't want anything to fundamentally change in this country.
Fuck anonymous ill go on any record with my views on this.  As a vet and a 18 yr letter carrier no one will bottle up my opinion.  Im very vocal about this.  Im going so far as telling Republicans on my route who i see that i need them to vote for Biden to preserve my job.

biden/harris are ignoring the two biggest demands of our country’s massive progressive movement, but it is the voters’ fault if they don’t go against their moral compass for a highly unappealing ticket. this is the greatest democracy in the world, baby.
See  your candidate,   was on the shortlist after all....  #hacksontap
I never advocated for Biden. I had one point. Trump did not permanently fund HBCUs. One program was permanently funded by Congress, less than 15% of all HBCU funding.
I have a question.   Why didn’t Obama/Biden save the post office?    Why does Trump have to do everything.   Serious answers only.
Fauci &amp;  didn’t make this happen. This is all on  He doesn’t take responsibility for the bungled response to the virus &amp; record unemployment BUT It’s his job to take responsibility. Joe Biden is not in a position of power where he could save us.
I’m voting for the Biden-Harris ticket to restore integrity and honor to the Presidency.
F no and it amazes me we have millions of Americans in a bubble that think these two are stars lol it’s playing out if Biden wins it will be the Obama administration all over again but the dems are really radical now
If that’s true then when &amp; if Biden is elected he will prosecute all of the crooks because this is punishable federal crime! I only have my craft material coming &amp; I’ll only lose some business but what about alll the people waiting for meds😕
Yes, we get it, Kamala Harris sucks. Don't let that distract you from the fact that Joe Biden also sucks.

That's a close one!  Kamala, Biden, Romney?  Too close to call!
As opposed to taking money from Russia (Hillary) and specifically Ukraine (Biden)?  Trump doesn't take a salary. He can't be bought, unlike Kamala who will blow you for the right job.  She acknowledges that in her affair with married Mayor Willie Brown.
I find those pod bros and their friends to be rather insufferable. They mocked and criticized him the whole way, and now look where Biden's at. They're not worth the trouble.
Just like Biden, Kamala is unethical and will do anything for power including sleeping with her married boss which she acknowledged and justified.  Both Biden and Kamala caused the increased incarceration of young blacks for non-violent misdemeanors.  Scam artists. #Blacks4Trump
If you don't know by now, then I feel sorry for you. If you don't vote for Biden, you support Trump.
Putin would be better than Biden.
(18/18) So yeah...hold Biden &amp; Harris accountable for addressing their past errors in judgement or character but don't for a second be pulling this crap where you're positioning them as a "bad" option when the alternative is SO much worse. Or do you want another 4 years of Trump?
(7/18) ...but in the absence of cooperation and collaboration, they aren't able to benefit from the others' perspectives or insights. I highly recommend everyone read Bill Bishop's "The Big Sort" if they have a problem with the Biden/Harris ticket being imperfect.
(6/18) Biden and Harris arent perfect but you what? They a helluva lot better options than the alternative and we should use their time in office to fight for real change on both sides of the aisle because there are ideas that both Republicans and Democrats have that are good...
(1/18) I don't get why ppl are so obsessed with finding every little thing that Biden or Harris did that didn't perfectly live up to the ideals of Now. I'm not pretending it didn't happen or that they shouldn't be pressured to improve on those past positions but...WTH?

I really don't think we could ever start a revolution without the liberals. there has to be some way we can show them how bad corporate democrats are. And that's my point, biden will not solve anything, which will show them that he does not care for the working people
I think that we need to take it down from the inside. elect biden, then show liberals how terrible he is too. this way democrats finally understand that the issue isn't trump, its both of our political parties.
This is such a joke you have someone 8 months debating how Biden isn’t the right pick for president then yesterday on tv saying he’s what real leadership looks like 🤮 it makes me so in raged that these people are allowed to just lie after lie and bubble people believe this crap
With you.  If kasich wants to help, he should campaign with biden in ohio. The convention is where dems say “This is who we are, these are our values”. Forcing women to give birth are not values we share.
Not everyone is “crazy” about Biden. But he and Kamala represent normalcy and progress. And Any vote other than for Biden is a vote for 4 more years of destruction &amp; death.

Let me be clear.  There are no ethical reasons to support or vote for #Trump.   There's only one ethical reason to vote for #Biden, and that's to eliminate Trump from office.  Even though that doesn't absolve him of criticism, remember that when addressing neoliberals.

How about the post office not going thru their money like they do...any other business is responsible for their finances. They are a private organization, not to mention the letter carriers union endorsed Joe Biden. Stop election fraud...vote in person, with an ID!!!!.
As soon as you bring up biden's rape allegations and kamala's cop history, they abandon ship.  Neo liberals are starting to get more predictable than maga.  Fuck em.
Should have thought about that before you backed biden.   Don't let the doorknob hit you on the way out, son
1- and the chicaneries of the DNC is the number one reason why more people chose biden. 2- if you had confidence that Biden would win, you wouldn't be worried about anyone calling him on his bullshit. Biden is not the default candidate.  Hit those phones, son.
Dear followers,  Anybody can get it.  Trump and Biden will be dunked on here.  If you have problems with this, you know where the unfollow button is.   I have spoken.
If you going to be on my timeline with that "fall in line" bullshyt, you're definitely going to have a bad time.   Trump is absolute garbage,but Biden is worthy of critique, and this is exactly what's going to go down here for the next four years at least.  Make your preparations
There is some truth in that, I'll admit. But I still think Biden is boring enough to not make the reaction back to the right as violent. If I'm wrong, I'm wrong. I just think the country would benefit from a sleepy 8 years.
Republicans have no game against Joe Biden or Kamala, so the best smears they can come up with are: "THEYRE the ones responsible for the racist "riots" and covid."  Even though it's obviously themselves. Biden isnt even in office yet, fucking damnable, moronic jackasses. 🙄
I mean there are a lot of people who support a vast majority of what the Biden platform stands for. To write that off because many of them would also like to see #M4A and #GND is frankly short sighted. But at the end of the day, yeah, one major party is better than the other.
I feel your pain..I told my husband if he doesn't vote for Biden, I will divorce his ass..LOL. I told him that Trump did not create the greatest economy and asked him how many stock shares that he is hiding because I haven't seen any LOL! So I told him to lay off the economy bit!
I get your frustration, we are all frustrated and beatdown with this psycho in office. I was GOP vtr (stupid) and am no longer. I do respect the progressives/Dems uniting and putting differences aside because getting Trump out is the main goal. Biden/Harris is the bus in a sense.
I do understand how you feel, I do get that honestly but voting for someone else other than Biden or not voting is a win for Trump. They are looking for us to be negative towards Biden/Harris as ammo. We need to get Trump out then move on to have someone else to run in 2024.
Vote for Biden because that is the ONLY way to get Trump out of office logically speaking. Then everyone can work on the next 4 years for their choice to run. In order to have that happen, we HAVE to get Trump OUT! Voting for someone else or not voting is giving Trump 4 more yrs.
I just heard Colbert say Biden/Harris is so centrist, that when he was young they would have been “considered Rockefeller Republicans.”  My head almost exploded.  Her Senate record is to the left of Sanders and Biden is at this point the most progressive POTUS candidate ever.
Why Blacks should Vote None Of The Above? Well both Biden and Trump are against Reparations for Foundational Black Americans and defunding the Police...so what are Blacks truly voting for...🤔
Endorse Biden. Put up or shut up.
He’s just Biden his time...😂
Blacks who are running to vote for #Biden only to get #Trump out of there just want to go back to sleep in that Post-Racial Dream Matrix...😴 #NoAntiBlackRacism
While you nit-pick all things you don’t like about Biden and Harris, remember that you voted for Obama who was against gay-marriage. It was only after Biden’s “gaffe” that he “evolved on his decision.”
Americans need to wakeup. With Biden in office, the only money Americans will have is what the government lets you have. People want everything free, how do you think the government is going to pay for it? Higher taxes, retirement money, property, and etc. Look at Cuba!
Black People: But #Biden &amp; #Harris said they're not going to do nothing SPECIFICALLY for Blacks.  Silly Negroes: Who cares...go vote!!!
That lil press conference today with liars Biden &amp; Kamala was just a preview. Two sociopathic baby killing, authoritarians with a lust for power and contempt for half the country. Tucker is right. They hate us &amp; they want to punish us for voting for DJT &amp; IF they get power 🇺🇲dies
It’ll end up being Biden at one of the debates. If they happen.
Pramila Jayapal - Political Change, Trump &amp; The 2020 Election | The Dail...  via  this is who is running for President not Joe Biden
it’s not that “joe biden doesn’t excite me” it’s that i feel like it is genuinely dangerous to type out what I think is going to happen in the next few months
Someone referred to Jill Biden as Lady Macbeth, a very ambitious woman!
If the DNC platform was Medicare for all, legal weed, and included outright pro-firearm language, Biden would drive record turnout and win by 300 electoral votes and 15 million popular votes.
Biden &amp;Harris want the United States to be ruled by United Nations.  Trump &amp; Pence want the United States to b Great And lead . Trump 2020🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Oh man, Eric Clapton Stan Twitter is EXTREMELY similar to Joe Biden Stan Twitter.   I'm a little mad at myself for even being surprised.
Virginia mayor urged to resign after saying Biden picked 'Aunt Jemima as his VP'   via
We are experiencing the 4th turning. Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden’s Running Mate
You mean like the ones they asked Biden today? Oh wait
Also Biden was not my 1st choice but at least he is trying to change. His new plan came to fruition directly with Sanders and Warren. Saying negative things about Dems is exactly what Trump wants.
Virginia mayor urged to resign after saying Biden picked 'Aunt Jemima as his VP'  via
A Forbes reporter pointed out to West that he won't be on the ballot in enough states to secure the Electoral College votes needed to win. "I’m not going to argue with you. Jesus is King." Pressed on the chance that he might take votes from Biden he replied, "I’m not denying it."
If you're ever called to be polled, make sure to tell them you'll be voting for Biden. It'll make November that much more painful for them!!
Sure, ok, I get what you say. I’ve not heard of Trump in the news lately groping, raping,etc. anyone. Biden is videoed grabbing little girls as they move away from him, touching them in any manner, making them uncomfortable. Surely, you see the difference. If not, # heresyoursign
That’s the issue here in Louisiana - liberals are scared to show their “liberal pride”. My mom has a Biden 2020 mask and we went to the store and some guy was calling her a fucking idiot and to get out of the country if she doesn’t like it here (she’s from here?) it’s intense.
Seems like Sedaris is talking about people who can't decide whether to vote for Trump or Biden. People not voting for either are pretty decided.
Why has the MSP not asked for Biden’s medical records. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Because the msm doesn't want to take the spotlight off of Kamala &amp; Biden.
If you’re gonna accuse Biden of something, you should at least try to accuse him of something he actually did, instead of just making up shit out of thin air &amp; throwing it out there. This is so ludicrous it’s Twilight Zone material. It just makes you look desperate &amp; foolish.
Live Campaign commercial* (For Biden)
Kamala Harris is still a cop and I will still not be voting for Joe Biden but best of luck to them
At this point, Joe Biden could fall out of Air Force One, break his neck, and have them stand him at the podium, like, “Weekend at Bernies,” and I’d still vote for him
I will absolutely risk getting this virus to cast my vote in person for Biden/Harris.
Biden’s President candidate run is the mask wearing President. He is using a worldwide pandemic for political gain but continues to not answer questions and say what it is that he would’ve done better besides wear a mask which most states have made it mandatory a month ago
Lmao and you think Biden and Kamala are going to “handle corruption” ? Biden has been at the center of the legalized bribery for decades.
I could go on and on come on Biden supports name some accomplishments in 50 years I’m waiting
But you notice they said for at least 3 months the dems are using covid for political gain. Biden nor any other democrat can say what they would have done better during this pandemic. The dems have one agenda no matter how many Americans they take down and it hasn’t changed.
You have no clue what Biden thinks about the virus. You would never care to even look to find out. You’re so busy covering trumps ass.   We need tests with the fast results if you want to open our country back up 💁🏻‍♀️
Obama 👏and👏Biden👏 built👏the👏cages👏. #WillfulIgnorance
Kabayashi Maru #FTW "Mr President, a #HarrisBiden vehicle has entered the #Whitehouse neutral zone".  "Hail them". "No response; Sir! they're arming CovidTorpedoes!" Trump "Lock FedPhasers on Hunter Biden's Swiss accounts!" "Sir they're withdrawing!" Trump "Fire!"
No respect at all. I don't see journalists hounding OBAMA OR BIDEN over the LIES they did!
2/2 "Joe Biden was right and could have saved THOUSANDS of grandma's while Donald Trump did nothing and now many are dead. Grandma can't afford another 4 years of Trump, early, mail-in vote #HarrisBiden today &amp; save grandma!" These lazy pricks can't even conceal their cons now!

I don’t think anyone is enthusiastic enough about Biden to cyber bully
I excitedly told her about Kamala. She does not know who she is, and knows nothing about Joe Biden. I can’t decide  if I want to inform her, or just tell her not to vote.
Can't you SEE through this setup!? 1. Aug 13th, #CreepyJoe demands continent wide masks to "save lives" 2. In 60 days, in key states, we get the MOTHER of All Corona Spikes! 3. In 61 days, ads begin rolling for #HarrisBiden showing THIS tape with the caption "Joe Biden was 1/2
I'd really like to know how the NoMatterWhos think I'm going to vote for Biden (or anyone else) when my mail-in ballot is definitely going to be lost or not counted. Guess I better write my Republican congressman a strongly worded letter about supporting USPS, huh?
All they spread is lies she criticized the president about the economy but yet he’s the one that’s trying to get it open. Biden/Harris policy is mask wearing which is a joke because most states made it mandatory a month ago
Bret can be such a dick sometimes. Biden’s people would never get treated like that if they went on
Trump might say "Fox is Fake News.  I believe Maria Bartiromo has me ahead of Biden?"  She's fantastic."
Lmao they say trump is behind Biden on policing in the pre polls.
Please chip in today to help all Americans afford to pay their bills and not be evicted by calling for the passage of  bill in the senate for $2000 monthly stimulus payments for the duration of this crisis.
Seriously that is all that you have you and Biden are a joke.
"China prefers Biden"  -
You can vote for a man who had kept his word and made America first and done everything he said he would are vote a guy in on his mask wearing policy. Lol if Americans are really think 50 year Biden would be better for our economy after covid they are smoking crack
Can someone in here honestly say that 50 year joe would be better for the economy then trump after covid and the next 4 years. With Biden we will be invaded at a civil war homeless broke drug addicts no guns no freedom no medical insurance in a war just totally fucked
Joe Biden has advocated cutting Social Security for 40 years  by
just switched my political party affiliation from democrat to the green party, took 5 minutes online, super easy.  fuck the beyond corrupt GOP and fuck the corrupt DNC (yes I'm still holding my nose and voting for biden and kamala the cop).  can't wait for ranked choice voting
I think it should be AOC, with Warren as an early endorser and mentor. If it ends up being Kamala, she should do what Biden was too afraid to do and pick a progressive VP: AOC!
Text from the Blacks for Trump team just now: "Racial injustice ends when Joe Biden retires from public service. Vote NO on Joe!"  I've fact checked this claim thoroughly. Here's what I found:
Because Biden looking for one.
When all else fails like your decisions and ignorance start cherry-picking and have zero facts to back your vote for Biden..enraged with your stupidity:) #Trump2020 don’t worry about the name calling nothing personal I’m love and war. If you are a women pardon my French

So you’ve already predicted Biden to win. Whatever
i don’t fw Biden but you crazy if you think i’m not gonna vote for buddy. Trump gotta go. It’s been a long 4 years
Biden is a fucking Pedophile.
That's not the point. I said they're not on the ballot in many states. Which is a fact and you said that's a lie.  Taking tips from Biden and trump?

Speaking as someone who WAS a moderate Republican (now just a moderate) some of you guys just don't get it. I'll vote for Biden unless he murders someone on stage. But there is a real danger of people who despise Trump but hate Democrats just sitting this one out.
I’m agreeing with you. That article was so well written and your compassion for truth compels me.   What can I do to help?   I’ll do anything outside of voting for creepy Biden, he is a Chinese asset.  No more Fox News for this guy. Well done.
It wouldn't surprise me if  were nominated for federal prison after Biden-Harris kicks his ass in November.
She walks like her 🍌 is 10x bigger then #biden probably why he sniffs kids, its olfactory viagra for "sniff the truth way biden sniffs the youth" about to have a weird orgy at bohemian grove #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
Listening to Biden and Harris gives me hope.
I find it particularly when people do this shit in states like Louisiana because it shows a clear misunderstanding of the electoral college. Like no amount of voting Biden is gonna make a difference down here so why even shame people? The state is gonna be red regardless.
FLASHBACK: Xi Jinping Took Joe Biden To A CCP Propaganda School  BEIJING BIDEN 🇨🇳  👇
Biden is going to lose anyway.
Biden and Harris are now trying to make covid and a vaccine a race thing. I baffles me that people still don’t have democrats figured out. Divide and destroy
Y’all. Offhand, do you know what Biden’s platform is? It’s been 8,389,124 years and I still don’t know 😭😭😭
Everyone still carrying on about this most states have made it mandatory trump does not control every state people. I would love to know what Biden would run on if there was no covid and they are now trying to make covid and the vaccine a race thing
So is Biden JS
Wait a second. Is Biden confused again and thinking he lives in China?
can joe biden read the room, copala harris? why her? anyways it’s better than trump, i hope.
Shouldn't we call a halt to purity tests until Biden is elected?

Biden is on tv calling on all governors to enact a mask mandate lasting at least 3 months!
IGers, this is for ALL the Voting Negroes looking for Change through Biden/Kamala!! Don't worry, IF, and I do mean IF they win, be Man/Woman enough to say: Bro. Keith X said that shit!!! Don't do like them cowards…
I'm torn on this legit criticism when neoliberal Biden/Harris is certainly preferable to Trump facism. Perhaps this should be saved for a later date, don't see how this helps now.
Biden-Harris and the Democrats need to couch this in terms of ACTIVE MILITARY voting. Anti Post Office is Anti Troops.
More and more and more lies and propaganda from team Trump for the brainwashed sheep who support him. Biden is about to be our president. The real patriots are rising to get rid of Despot Don.
“Biden doesn’t support M4A” yes but at least he isn’t trying to KICK people off insurance. He isn’t trying to eliminate Medicare and Social Security. Let’s be pragmatic. Not idealistic.
Biden wants to reign in private prisons. Kamala is pushing for a New Green Deal. Biden is calling for racing the marginal tax rate. I can agree, this isn’t the ideal situation for progressives. But I’m scratching my head wondering how re-electing Trump helps our goals.
Just talked to my staunch Republican mom. She's voting Biden/Harris.   I'll be in the backyard digging my grave because I am 💀💀💀
Hopefully the Biden campaign will do better
Patriots this Peace Deal has to go Viral. Obama and Biden spent Billions and couldn’t Acchive Peace . The Country’s did not trust the Obama ,Biden Administration. Just like Qsaid world piece is coming. Trump 2020!!!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
I hear that. Best pro-voting argument I heard was from AOC. She asked who do we want to have veto power &amp; power to appoint supreme court judges. On that front I can see why voting Biden would be harm reduction. But also electoral college means LA will be Republicans anyway so 🤷🏾‍♂️
Because a white male isn't getting chosen based on his race OR his sex. Biden specifically stated he wanted a women and a POC, rather than the best person for the job.
Did you know Ohio is a Bellweather state since 1860 Ohio has picked the winner except for Grover Cleveland, FDR and JFK That’s a damn good record I love my adopted state I know it will pick Joe Biden and Kamala Harris ! Don’t bet against the Buckeyes !!!
biden needs a proper meme team STAT
She also said she believed Tara Reid &amp; other women who accused Biden of sexual assault &amp; harassment.  Of course she believed Jussie Smollett too.
Black People are bashing Senator Harris more then Biden, please pay attention.
Yea biden supporters are so stupid.
Fun fact the fake news won’t tell you: this officer is an outspoken Joe Biden supporter.
Here some. good need news,Professor Alan Lichtman who predicted that Hillary Clinton would  lose and Trump would win His predictions have been on point for years. He also predicted that Trump would be impeached. He has predicted that Biden will win. Yay!
Why would a legitimate media outlet provide a platform for these slobbering wingnuts  ???  Fox News host claims that 'something's going to happen' to Joe Biden - Business Insider
There are 100 people. Nobody wants to listen to their lies.  Biden dis nothing for 8 years now he wants to fix everything
Fun fact: this officer supports Joe Biden. Thanks for the plug!
The only question the media will ask Biden today, if he comes out of the basement, is if he likes cats.
This is what Harris/Biden wants America last and fat pockets for the left
What people seem to forget in 2008 when the market crashed from the housing crisis Obama Biden gave the people $25 dollars but bailed out all the big banks and corporations they have 💩 to the people then the car dealers left to Mexico
If I thought voting for Biden and Kamala would make yall happy and shut up and stop whining for an hour I'd sign up to canvas the country. But I know that even when you win you'll still be whining and wanting to fight about something. Cause yall love to fight.
My family member is inexplicably afraid and convinced that there is some “plan” to elect joe Biden and then use the 25th amendment to make Nancy Pelosi the president... after *both* of their, what? Deaths?? Incapacitation?? Who can tell me where this conspiracy started??
On the bright side, Joe Biden is probably too old to be a 2 term president 🤗🤗
Nice try!  When Biden gets in we WILL make America great.
Biden won't get voted in anyway. #Trump2020LandslideVictory
🚨 Huge peace deal announced by   Obama &amp; Biden chose to deal with the world’s leading terrorism sponsor by sending them pallets of cash &amp; giving them an opening to make nukes.  Trump is uniting our allies to stand up to Iran &amp; protect Israel.  Stark contrast.
Yes Biden/Harris is supposed to win.   But never discount the power of the American caste system.  People will give up democracy before they give up race privilege.
Honestly love the 2010 Gmod aesthetic. Biden can't compete.
I suppose Biden will attack Trump for something so that the American people won't remember that the Obama/Biden Mid-East policy was to give vast sums to Iran and to let them have a nuke after ten years. Biden's policy of appeasement, just as happened with Munich, only brings war.
Biden is moving like his body is rented and he doesn’t know how it works going through the doorway. My God.. we live in odd times. These people are not progressives.
Those are constructive to you because you've bought into media narratives that more knowledgeable people know are fake. We don't want symbolic roles in a Biden administration.  We want free and fair elections, m4a, a GND, and wealth redistribution.
Biden has dead eyes. I think they want to show he knows how to use a telephone. The chick saying “Hi Kamala” sounds like she eats mayonnaise by the spoonful.  this is performative and gross.
I like to imagine, y’all imagine with me, that there’s massive vote for Biden/Harris in Florida so big they call it that night. Then a couple hours later N Carolina falls along with Michigan. Game over right? Champagne, bells ringing, celebration in the streets! Imagine it hard!
Think about how bad they all treated Sarah Palin a few years ago. Now they want to be nice. 🖕🏼 Harris and Biden they are terrorist to America
She's already leading in ways you need to. Please endorse her bill in the senate for $2k monthly stimulus payments.
Apparently you know nothing about Joe Biden. He doesn't live in gold plated mansions in the sky. Why? He's never been impressed with money. Probably an unreal concept for a trumpster.
I've heard this throughout this entire cycle. What are these people watching? What's so great about her debate skills? She once hit Biden, who thinks spelling "ooooo" in Cheerios is note-worthy.
I’d definitely feel better voting for you than Biden.
Yeah, trump will win in 2020 there really isn’t a doubt in my mind anymore. A trump voter will walk through fire to vote for him, more than half of potential Biden voters don’t give a shit about him or Harris.
Israel and UAE unite against Iran.  You know, the country that wants to nuke them and us; the country Obama/Biden sent Billions to appease.
I’m sure everyone remembers the college football seasons that were lost under the Obama-Biden administration...  (checks notes)  ...zero.
“She has accumulated enough experience in executive positions and as a legislator to provide competent backup. That may not sound inspiring, but it would be a contrast to the administration which the Biden/Harris ticket hopes to replace.” #BidenHarris2020
Should be Warren. Will be Biden or Harris.
You guys haven’t created sh*t. You rode the coat-tails of the Obama-Biden economy for a while until you screwed it up. Trump caused a recession in February with his idiotic tax breaks for the rich, then you bungled the coronavirus response and now 15+ million ppl are out of work.
Has she even congratulated Kamala Harris or endorsed Biden yet?
I mean people who entitled to vote for whoever they want. The DNC chose their hand and went against the movement. I’m not doing the whole Biden is just as bad. He isn’t. But people have the right to express their feelings.
Biden answered that question already.
As a businessman Trump used to be a NY Democrat and contributed to a ton of politicians until he found out how far left extreme they really were.  Kamala said she believed women like Tara Reid who said  Joe Biden sexually assaulted them.  She also said Biden has racist past.
1. Just curious John but Um WHY do you think it’s being canceled?   2. If Obama/Biden or any other allied leader were President instead of Trump, would the US still be on fire with COVID right now? If not, then we would still have football.   Soooooo the reason we don’t is Trump.
Tbh I’d vote for Joe Budden before Joe Biden
Fox's Jeanine Pirro predicts 'something will happen' to Biden before November and he won't be on ticket #SmartNews    Another false prophet Pirro
Biden might have worse PR/media team in history of politics. This added to innumerous virtual meeting gaffes is comical.
Hannity claims Biden picked Harris as running mate because she's 'a favorite of the radical far-left' #SmartNews    Hannity like always is full of crap
So what’s your solution? You have Biden or Trump to vote for in the fall. Nothing keeps us from pushing Biden to do better. But, there is no force in the world can make that sociopathic jackass Trump move one inch towards better. Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.
At a fundraiser Don Trump jr said :  Raise your hand if you think Biden made a WHORENDOUS pick for VP? This is trash talk beyond any trash talk I have ever heard!
I think Biden/Kamala have secret service protection now. These people know Trump will be defeated.
Harris is a joke just like Biden is a joke. If you go back in follow their votes and policies it’s a disaster everyone can use covid as an excuse to belittle  but he has been the greatest president in history and the man has held up and done everything he said!
Trump go win again, y’all to busy trying to find something bad on Biden and kamala y’all go cause division and unsurness amongst the democratic votes it’s 2016 all over again some people just don’t learn
I’m Riding for Biden!
Sometimes how he phrased stuff makes it tough on his team but the Biden crew is about to be going crazy - wait’ll Biden starts talking a lot in public lol
If we have a #fair, #honest, and #lawful #election;  I predict that #PresidentTrump will win--and #WIN #BIG. The mob/#LiesLiesLies party's claims of #prosperity ignore the eight anemic years of #Obama/#Biden and the boom period of #Trump/#Republicans-no mob/#LiesLiesLies #votes!
Don Trump jr said at a fundraiser: Raise your hand if you think Biden made a”Whorendous” pick for VP ? Can you believe this? Trash talk beyond any trash talk I’ve ever heard!!!!
Yes,  please look into threats against Joe Biden and Kamala. We're VERY concerned about the threats posed by people like
I wouldn't give a 2 stroke fuck if Biden picked Uncle Clifford as his running mate.  I'M VOTING TO GET TRUMP OUT
You have incredible gall questioning Vice President Biden’s faith for bringing Harris to the ticket. Y’all brought TRUMP to your ticket. 🤪 You laud your daughter for lying (something you also do regularly), and have a son who tortures dogs. You give a bad name to Christianity.
Oh, the tRumpers are tRolling! That Biden/Harris ticket is bothering them something fierce! They are crawling out the woodworks, rearing their nasty ugly antennae!
Look at this news article from The Daily Caller: ’Rescued Again By Joe Biden’: Tucker Carlson Thanks Biden For Saving Him On Kamala Harris Name Mispronunciation
Hey  Biden miss pronounced ka-mala too
“If elected, I’ll immediately reach out to Dr. Fauci &amp; ask him to continue his incredible service to our country,”
Guess the shareholders didn’t see it was as Biden’s VP  *****this tweet is in no way pro trump... Fuck Trump******
Trump is attacking Biden from the left and Kamala from the right
If twitter was bigger, Bern woulda beat Hillary who woulda beat Trump. Then Warren or Bern woulda beat Biden, or at least been his VP.... 0-6 lol
Second stimulus check: Where Biden, Harris stand on COVID payment proposals
Torches? This is hilarious. Is Babylon bee writing tweets for Biden now?
Kamala has a bill in the senate to help us get through this crisis by distributing $2,000 stimulus checks every month until this crisis is over. Will you endorse it to get the job done?
Fun fact: Donald Trump has refused to publicly denounce what’s happening in Hong Kong, while Joe Biden has. More lies from Donald the despot and the conservative snowflakes.
OK, enough about Harris. Just as so many VP candidates she will probably end up as another footnote in history anyway. Now lets talk about Biden's history &amp; policies writ large!
People in the US are sick, dying, and unemployed due to #COVID19, but thanks to  at least we can waste water in the shower again.
If Joe Biden was good enough for Leslie Knope, he’s good enough for me.
The left wing radicals are licking their chops doing interviews on how they can’t wait and if Biden wins he will bend to them all and do their bidding. Kamala all you got to do is look at San Fran it’s like nyc ruined
the left wing radicals will continue to lie for there agenda this video shows that. Pelosi just accused trump of a payroll tax cut scam and not being good but in 2012 she is all for it. Biden/Harris would be the worst decision in history
So if you’re mad that I’m not voting for a Biden-Harris ticket maybe ask yourself why it isn’t Harris in the top slot
I would actually vote for Kamala Harris if she was running for President but she’s not running for President. Joe Biden is running for President and I’m not voting for him.
disappointed the trump train didn’t run biden over, huge missed opportunity
🚨 NOT what Biden wanted to see:  Number of people filing unemployment DROPPED below a million for the first time since the pandemic started.  Dems &amp; so-called experts always bet against America.  But not Trump. He built the world’s strongest economy once—now he’s doing it again!
More fake news from the conservative Snowflakes. Here’s a fun thought: Why hasn’t the despot Donald Trump publicly condemned what’s happening in Hong Kong? Joe Biden has.
Biden Doesn't Even Know  Where He Is Most Days &amp;  He Lies His Azz Off Typical Corrupt Democrat💯 GodBlessAmerica🙏🇺🇸
Are u insane, no difference... u ethier vote for communism with biden r freedom with trump. Wakeup people this is no joke
lol when does Biden use “complete cogent sentences?” He speaks like he has dementia 😂
Dogs for Biden/Harris
Biden literally took the TRAIN to and from DC every day so that he could continue to parent his sons as a single father mourning the loss of his wife and baby girl.While doing this, he still sought to do the best by his constituents. What’ve YOU ever done?
Howard University community reacts to Kamala Harris as Biden's VP pick.   via
DAMN THE RULE OF LAW: Rudy Giuliani says, the U.S. Would Become ‘Banana Republic’ if Biden’s DOJ Prosecuted Trump.  But, previously, Trump's personal lawyer has persistently pushed for charges against Obama administration figures. What about rule of law?
Y'all think Biden is writing his own tweets...while alive?
Just clarifying,,,,, is Biden your “perfect” candidate???? R u sure????
I'm joe biden and I've lost my 5 ye old girlfriend.
Almost as quick as others went from “defund the police “ to “we have to vote for Biden, even though he said he won’t defund police and has a direct connection to upholding the institution of policing as we know it today and picked someone who has done the same as his vp
Most importantly, WE have to come out and vote not only for Biden/Harris but turn Senate to Dem, hold the House and go after Trumptwrs and bad players right and left up and down the ticket.
It’s really amusing to hear Trump defend Biden about the former debate with Kamala -on the busing issue! What this man baby doesn’t understand is that not all grown-ups hold grudges like the “nasty” little man he is . He can’t put his inflated ego aside for US
Morning 🇺🇸AzzKickingPatriots MAGA RunAway's Rise Up Kamala Ain't BLACK⏬ Biden Lied Promised VP Would Be Black American! Democrats Destroying🇺🇸 #1Enemy Fake DNC Media United To Kickazz Save Our Beloved Military,Police,ICE! NeverJoeBiden NeverKamalaHarris
Warning on Russia adds questions about Senate’s Biden probe
Kamala Harris just showed why Biden chose her as his running mate
If we Trump fans *are* taking another look at Biden, it’s a look of disgust!
So if Joe Biden grew up around black ppl he can too? Noted lol
Kanye West accuses Wisconsin Democrats spying on his campaign    America😎 Corrupt Democrats Trying Too Destroy Kanye West 💯 They Know He Will Take Votes From Corrupt Biden &amp; Trump Will Win Wisconsin! No Man Are Woman Can Stop Will Of  God🙏🇺🇸
Seniors trust Joe Biden  plus they feel betrayed by their smarmy governor and Trump -the management of COVId     Is number one on their minds they feel afraid 😱 and betrayed Perhaps this crisis will make them pay more attention to Trump desire to raid the SS fund
If conservatives knew just how conservative Joe Biden was, they would definitely vote for him over Trump.
Classy.
Joe Biden likes to let little kids rub the hair on his legs and sit them on his lap 🤔
Four years ago we were told to vote for Hillary or we would be responsible for electing trump. I voted for her, although I didn’t want to. She won the popular vote, then the electoral college decided to elected trump. So why should I vote for Biden?
That is why I’m voting green - Biden is like being in the eye of the storm, a brief repose before shit gets worse.
I loved the “we’ve added more jobs than Obama and Biden ever did.”... That’s like an investor losing $1,000,000 of your money, gaining back $500,000, and then telling you he’s got you more gains than anybody else ever has
I like how Biden and Harris aren’t spewing out a firehose of dumb fucking lies at me like I’m a one-cell organism that’s stupid enough to believe obvious bullshit. One day of it has been enough to elevate my mood a little.
Did you run a piece on Mike Pence's (or Joe Biden for that matter) legitimacy to be president? No? That's because it's racist sexist trash and you know it.
Dogs for Biden/Harris!
Opinion: Voters will be looking for more than just symbolism in Biden and Harris
As if Republicans are tuning in to this convention. What the DNC really needs to do- if they expect true progressives and Gen Z and millennials to settle for Biden- is give more time and a larger platform to the more progressive voices in the party.
Harris makes case against Trump in first speech as Biden's running mate
Joe Biden might not support #MedicareForAll but Kamala Harris does. I believe she’ll win that battle as VP. Let’s get to work. #BidenHarris2020
China if Trump, Civil if Biden
Proud of you girlfriend I am also a Tulane Alum We need to take no prisoners in this fight Trump is gonna look under every rock for dirt Also I hope our team of Biden-Harris does something about incarceration La. is number 1 in this area-disgrace - free our kids!
Biden, is too old. This is the best card he could use.
CNN Editor-at-Large: Biden May "Step Aside" for Kamala Harris
You're questioning Biden's faith while presenting as a "priest" - who just happens to have a wife &amp; kids?!?!   Get behind thee, Satan, and take 2020 with you.
““If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be My disciple.” Jesus expressed comparisons.  Biden/Harris vs Trump/Pence is like  superheroes vs anti-Christs.
I think he means that he needs Obama/Biden to take care of business to open schools safely because GOP's can't get the job done. Obama/Biden took care of business and got rid of bin Laden when Bush and GOP couldn't! Thanks DeSantis for the shoutout!
#45,       Get this negative failure out the way of the American people!  Our beloved #46 POTUS Joe Biden  and #46 VPOTUS Kamala Harris  takes the lead in 2020 to save the soul of our nation and restore dignity in America...
As Robert De Niro said “I hear things, I hear thing”. This Trump interview was recently on FOX. Trump did elaborate that Biden is “shot mentality”, but “I hear things”.
do i agree with everything that joe biden/ kamala has done or their beliefs? absolutely not. but i also understand that our country simply cannot handle another 4 years of the orange guy.
Make no mistake, he’s going to troll and burn this country down. We will have to vote Biden/Harris in office to make us better.
biden is racist lmao
did you not watch the video? i’m deeply offended at biden. tf?
Yes they can vote against your interests but as whole a states delegates have to vote upon majority rule. So if 1 electorate votes for kanye and 2 for Biden. Biden still wins. There’s never been a case where the e.c caused an crazy election.
Neither would ever do that.  Biden haters black ppl . He tried his best to stop desegregation
Because Biden can’t debate!  Come on man just say it!
Girl they both do the same thing. It’s scary bc Biden’s better at pretending. I thought Clinton was the lesser evil but she was even caught trafficking black children from Haiti
I’m burned out with the coverage of the Biden/Harris coupling! Her voice and laugh grates on my last nerve ala Hillary!
Does it require brains for Biden to say he doesn't want his kids to go to school in a "racial jungle"?  How about that if you don't vote for Master Biden, "you ain't black"?  Kamala's mom is from India &amp; her dad from Jamaica.  Not black. Neither are her husband or kids.  Phony.
Call me a “neo-liberal corporatist shill.” Couldn’t care less.  Biden/Harris 2020. “Your vote doesn’t matter. You live in Louisiana.”  Yes. It. Does. It matters. You do you. I’ll vote against Trump. Happily.
Think about it  Kamalla is 55  Biden is 77  Maybe she’s just playing the odds
As Kamala Harris Joins Biden Ticket, Wall Street Sighs in Relief - WSJ
Does Kamala still believe Tara Reid's accusation that Biden sexually assaulted her? She said she believed her.  Hmmm.  Well, we already know how low she'll go for a job. (Mayor Willie Brown)
Biden got him bothered.
Messa Joe Biden don’t care nor do he understand The plight of the so-called black people . Say no to Joe!!!
She is he. To Joe Biden for president. No we can’t!!! This is my humble opinion. Not hate speech!!!
Did she ask you to endorse her $2k monthly stimulus bill yet? If she hasn't yet, here's over 371,000 people who have.
Curious if internatl newpapers wud have anything to say about Biden/Harris. Front pages from  Many more carried pics of Putin and his virus "vaccine".
I liked that the Biden-Harris announcement used Curtis Mayfield's "Move On Up" as bed music; I hope they continue to do that.
I voted for 2 out of the 3 men you mentioned. Like you, I am delighted to be voting for Biden/Harris. So is every other sane American, I am convinced.
if people refuse to vote for the Biden/Harris ticket bc they don’t make enough concessions to the left, that is the BIDEN/HARRIS ticket’s fault. not voters. why do republicans understand this so much better than democrats?
Biden is suprisingly smart with the #Kamala pick. Identity politics always blinds people into thinking representation can create systemic change.
I’ll be voting for none of your business. I won’t be voting for an old creepy dimentia filled Biden and a phony Harris. She is more hated than Hillary Clinton. Only terrorists, idiots, and China will be voting for those communists.
Trump/Trumpist attacks on Biden-Harris are gross but bode well. “Hit me with your best shot” has never been more revealing.
Tate is trying to show you the hypocrisy of what they are doing. She is a phony and disingenuous. She called Biden a racist and said she believed his accusers. It doesn’t matter what race she is or claims to be. I don’t focus on race, Only character. And she has none.
Biden is a pedophile that’s the tweet
Show me where she called Biden racist. I can show u the racist tweets trump has sent out.
And the same age/experience contrast between McCain and Palin could be seen in the Democratic ticket. Yet when Biden was announced a few weeks earlier, his age was not mentioned once, even while his experience, six senate terms, and health problems are all discussed
We all have HOPE and FAITH in Team Biden/Harris will lead us Americans to a better and more prosperous United States of America. It's been time to get Trumpism out of the People's House! USA is the land of the Free and let's make that TRUTH again!
Its starting to feel like Christmas everyday! First Kamala as VP then the epic roll out of the Biden/Harris uppercut to Trump/ Pence today &amp; THIS book due in Sept!! CNN Exclusive: Details, title and cover revealed for Bob Woodward's upcoming book on Trump
*Sets your house on fire*  *Sets your money on fire*  *Sets your car on fire*  *Hands you a glass of water*  “We’ve done more to fight fires in the last 3 months than Joe Biden and Barack Obama did in their 8 years in office.”
So I pulled up the NYT front pages that covered the VP announcements of Kaine, Ryan, Palin, and Biden (7/15/16 cover for Pence seems to not be digitized). Lo and behold, a pattern could be discerned
Biden bet not lose , now that he’s picked the all madden team.. he gon fuck around and lose to the N.Y. Giants on pro.
Biden you forget. You are the one who loves the KKK
So Tucker is for Biden?  That sounds like a #VoteBidenHarris2020  campaign speech😂😂😂
when Biden announced that he would be picking a female VP, he unfairly put the focus on his running mate’s gender identity rather than on her record of service....which actually started making a lot of sense when he picked Kamala Harris lol
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden’s Running Mate
Joe Biden is aging..
Everyone is like "Are you voting for Trump then?" No, you should be able to openly criticize politicians ?? No one is voting for Biden &amp; Kamala because they WANT to -- it's sadly the lesser of two evils
It's been four, long years of horror, but there is light. Celebrate being human and listen to opera. Biden-Harris 2020  Beautiful opera arias, famous female opera singers  via
Just wondering CNN expect Republicans to hug and kiss Biden and Kamala the way Pelosi, Democrats, media has been hugging and kissing Trump since he announced his entry into politics?
This is wrong. AFFH just means if towns want federal HUD dollars, they have to make plans to end discriminatory housing. It was first implemented not by Biden but by Mitt Romney’s dad when he too realized that giving Fed Money to towns to stay segregated is a bad idea.
Accusers, plural. Right. You’re so full of s h I t.  But even Biden said he wanted to hear Reade out, that she deserved to be listened to, to have an investigation opened.   What happened to that??? 😂
I’m tryna get like you bro! I need those problems haha. I think the entire Dem base feels the same way about Biden as you do. It’s almost the same way it was in ‘16 but we need to be unified to take the White House. Let me know if you ever wanna do some commentary I’m ready haha
Of course, the fact that Wall Street does not see Kamala Harris as a threat is absolutely important -- "Wall Street’s warm welcome to Joe Biden’s running mate reflects a belief that tougher financial regulation isn’t a top priority"
Biden announces Kamala Harris as his running mate...
Just realized that the Biden vs Trump debates will be two old men yelling at clouds. No way to watch that shit sanely
If Joe Biden does end up winning, that would create a nice kind of symmetry by having that the last president come from the first state.
and you're not being realistic if you think that incrementalism is going to work, when it hasn't worked in the past 40 years of quid pro quo and compromise. You're cucked.  Your only argument is vote for Biden or else. Who's the idiot, again?
let’s be real even if biden chose a pile of bricks for VP i’d still vote biden/bricks2020
Ok  serious question, why do you support them ? Biden has been a politician for 40 years what is he going to do now? What has he done in 40 years ?
This is what’s about to happen under Biden Presidency
I think you’re confused, as usual. You’re thinking of Trump. No one has accused Vice President Biden of “sexual abuse,” If you’re truly an ally of Trump, you’d be foolish to bring up sexual abuse. A 13-year-old for God’s sake!
Im so mad at them videos cause trump be smoking biden 💀
Can’t wait to get my Biden Harris yard sign!
I agree. He wouldn't have taken the Biden-Harris campaign launch well at all. First, they're coming for HIS job, oval office, White House, Marine One, &amp; Air Force One. Next, they criticized him on national television. He would have gone ballistic, hence, the sedation.
You ain name nobody sooo vote Biden pls
That's not a threat.  Personally, I voted for Clinton after Bernie got shafted the first time. Hillary got the popular vote, and still lost the election. if you think not voting is a vote for Trump, you already think that Biden it can't beat Trump.
"make no mistake" yourself GOP- anybody who is on the fence does their homework and will see that your statement is exactly opposite of the truth. STFU Y'all are shitting your pants that she's on the ticket. She has energized the Biden Campaign 10-fold! #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Trump has pretty much eliminated daily intelligence briefings. Biden has already started receiving them.
Probably because Kanye wants nothing to do with Biden 😂😂😂
Yes I did. Biden/Harris makes trump look and sound stupid.
Y’all do know that Biden and Trump aren’t the only two candidates right?
If they think Biden and Harris are radical, whoa are they in for a surprise when they hear what a majority of Americans want...
I sure hope y’all are right. I see signs then I just feel like no one is going to have the balls to come forward. Biden blew Trumps ass away today. I loved everything he said. He makes trump really sound stupid!
Yup, #Biden has hung around Washington for 4 decades  But name something he accomplished
That is BS. Actually tens of millions of jobs will be created by Biden's plan. America is looking forward, leave Trumpism behind! Trump only created chaos, fear, hopelessness. One good thing Trump did was show us what NOT to do going forward! Recession began in Feb!
I agree, it was so disrespectful for Vice President Biden to mispronounce Ms. Harris’s name.He did it about 5 times today. Do you agree?
Did y’all morons report that the “Racist” Joe Biden miss pronounce “cam-a- la’s” (Kamala) name wrong!? U don’t have to answer b/c I already know the answer is [no] b/c y’all are a lying, racist,anti-American organization who denies history! The Democrats lost the Civil....
A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump
Same. I'm so scared. I felt like Chicken Little in 2016 because I kept telling people to worry more and I kept getting blown off. 😕 I won't be able to relax until Biden is actually sworn in.
Not a group of white men telling me that the sick feeling I get in my stomach when I think about voting Biden/Harris is only because of my privilege! It couldn’t be!
Life, besides Covid can't get any better. Now finish him off....Biden/Kamala!!
I have noticed that several times now when people are talking about Kamala Harris they keep saying that she is able to make the hard decisions!   Isn't that the President's job?  Are the Democrats planning to pull an article 25 on Joe Biden if he gets elected? Maybe  30 days a
I think so. The Qcumbers think that Biden is a Trojan Horse controlled by communist revolutionaries and that their plan is to install Kamala.   And these Q narratives seep into mainstream Republican rhetoric.
Y'all definitely aren't doing much investigation, I see. Biden caught pressure from multiple sources and veiled threats to choose very specifically.
People who say Trump is racist.  Are always quite as a mouse, when I ask what has he said or done?  Not☝️ person has been able to give me an answer!  Not one! I can quickly rattle off Biden’s racist remarks and actions. 🇺🇸 #TRUMP2020 #DonaldTrumpBelieves #donaldtrumpwins #USA
Biden and Harris believe the anarchists burning our cities are peaceful protesters and the police are clan members! With an attitude like that exactly how do they plan to restore law and order... and peace?
I’m really pleased Joe Biden has picked a radical Leftist as his running mate. I get all my information on YouTube from guys who talk faster than stenographers can type.
Dumb b- - ch we kno what she did for Biden he just forgot to tell everyone down on her knees again just like her beginnings
We are voting for Biden not Kamala Harris. If Biden win Kamala win.
Evidently, some prankster pointed ANTIFA DOT COM domain name at the Biden website, and all the QANON idiots are scrambling around like roaches thinking some witchcraft has happened. Funniest shit ever.
No.  Be a grown up and focus on your primary goal.  Do you plan to vote for Biden or not?  After the election you have years to try to influence the VP for whatever it is you think they are in charge of.
I AM the “radical left” and these candidates are not. I wish they were. Any news media outlet or commercial that tells you Biden or Harris are radical is down right BS propaganda pushing some other agenda. Keep that in mind when you choose who to believe.
Some knucklehead pointed that name at the Biden website.  It's been around since 2002, so who knows who registered it.  Somebody is having internet fun, that's all.
So Janet, are you just going to remain an ignorant liberal, or are will you admit you were wrong and Biden lied?  Don't bother. I know the answer. Liberals NEVER admit they're wrong.
I’ll never vote for Harris or Biden I’m voting for Farrakhan
If (when) something happens to Biden
Tucker Carlson is on fire tonight! On last night’s show he was chastised by a guest for mispronouncing Kamala Harris’ name! Today several MSM shows pointed this out as disrespectful!Joe Biden introduces her today  a presser and mispronounces her name! Lol 😂
Biden’s wife need to run for President with her y’all, we all know who truly wears the pants in the relationship anyways.😂 #AmeisterAmericaINC🇺🇸
Not a single person should be at all confident that Biden will win in November. Have we not learned the lessons? Polls are not prophecies. The events that will unfold between polls now and the election are unforeseeable. There are no grounds for assuming Democrats will win.
You’re the only one who cares where Hunter Biden is. The whole rest of America is wondering where the man is who is supposed to be coordinating the federal government response to #COVID19. That should be  but he’s busy watching TV. #GOPGenocide
Staggering how Biden and Kumoltta Harris just outright lie. Heels Up Harris said Trump ran Obama economy into ground. Now this. Are people really this stupid and uninformed?  Oh wait, some liberals might be reading this...
Enough already! Joe Biden only had two female presidential candidates to choose from. They're smarter than he is; &amp; he's intimidated by the swiftness of their feet. He can leave Beau out as an excuse for choosing a #POC. We'll see what she/media means HBCU/Black/African American.
Liberals have to fix everything, again. Biden/Harris are our only hope.  #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
I AM a suburban housewife. Biden/Harris &amp; every other Dem in 2020. Writing “Ditch Mitch” postcards to send to KY voters, donating to blue candidates in other states!
I AM a suburban housewife. Biden/Harris &amp; every other Dem in 2020. Writing “Ditch Mitch” postcards to send to KY voters, donating to blue candidates in other states!
if Biden wins.... Its kamala in 2024 and nobody going to be able to to say shit to black women about not supporting kamala for president. I'm the black ivy educated sun of blue collar black folk and I couldn't say shit to them about biden because he was Obama's man!
i guess in a way i...want trump to win... I know its not popular to say on the left, but from "harm reduction principles" it may do the least harm to democracy and the world..  Because i think if Biden wins we are fucked more long-term... At least we have a chance in 2024...
yeah ...so. my friends think i am a trump supporter cause i dont like Biden or Harris. I've come to accept its because they are actually and legitimately brainwashed  im one of those people who now just calls it and accepts its brainwashing
Do these people even know that this isn’t like a town mayor election? What the hell does Biden think he’s gaining with this woman, this is just complete entertainment television. If they’re going to cancel sports. What better to watch then the election debates. 🤯🤯😂😂
When Trump suddenly embraces anti-Catholicism and Biden starts campaigning in French:
Nice to meet you, as well!  I’m in Louisiana now, but I did graduate from A.I. in 1980... &amp; still have connections to the V.P. through the Biden Institute. 🙂
Don’t get it twisted even though I’m mad about Biden’s pick I AM STILL VOTING
She was. For sure. But we didn’t like Hillary enough and look what happened. Not voting is voting Trump, not voting Biden is voting Trump...I say just press the correct fucking button and focus on the equally, maybe more important local shit on your ballot
I keep hearing all about how... Biden chose Kamala Harris! Biden chose Kamala Harris! Biden chose Kamala Harris!  NOT SO! Chuck &amp; Nancy chose Kamala!  (btw: somebody needs to tell Joe)
Well, the KKK were Democrats, remember that. When Senator Robert Byrd dies (KKK recruiter), Hillary called him her mentor and Biden called him a great friend.  Anything else you'd like to add?  #BlacksforTrump
Where was biden , doing what as vp fir 8 yrs. What will he do now with kamala.  Most divisive people
F yes Judge! I believe America is but its sad people are staying quiet because they are scared of being attack. I say f them and bring it on. Biden’s campaign is covid but still hasn’t said what he would have done better. If there was no covid we would be having no debate
America, ask yourselves, what is more important? Kamala Harris as Biden's VP running mate, or WAP? Keep in mind, the only correct answer is WAP.
If Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren got together and had a baby it would be Joe Biden.
I’m wavering so much between suck it up and vote for biden and fuck you all I refuse to settle for biden and I don’t know which is more selfish
Biden said "build back better" if they win we are all doomed
Blue Wave is Riding with Biden and Harris. Let's get to work.
you clearly cared enough about Kanye to take time out your day to contact GAP 😂  Hey, instead of calling GAP to harass kanye, why don’t you spend that time knocking on doors or making calls for Biden? Get off Twitter and hit the phones.
Biden 2020 !! Campaign manager!!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Niggas must think biden and Harris gon write  the 2021 crime bill
Love these liberals telling us how Joe is going to unite the country. "They gonna put yall back in chains"
Dream Team ~Biden/Harris~
Joe Biden grabs little girls and makes them shutter. I’ll stay with Trump
Joe Biden doesn’t go back on his promises. The minute he promised his VP pick would be a woman, they should’ve known it wouldn’t be Pete.
Dream Team~Biden/Harris~
I’m really at a bad place when it comes to this election. I really don’t fw either sides. Say what you say at me but Biden and Kamala is just as fucked up as the fuck boys on the other side. Im still gone vote for joe but I don’t really support them either😔
We’ve had a nest of Carolina wrens on the porch. Today, E and I got to watch the babies leave. Mom and Dad have successfully herded them out of the yard and away from my cat. And I’ll be voting for Biden/Harris. So all is good for now.
Biden’s camp def played their hand w/ this one. A black woman VP, the teedy’s coming out in record numbers.
Joe Biden is the only one who needs to be satisfied with Kamala Harris' answer about the debate exchange.  Not you.
After watching the Biden Harris debut &amp; being so uplifted &amp; reassured, we are subjected to this horror. Bring on Nov 3rd.
I’d argue that if you don’t live in a swing state, voting for Biden/Harris is actively harmful. If the dems can count on your vote, no matter who they put up, they have no incentive to address your demands and you are giving up what little power your vote has.
Hello! We’ll see. But I have a feeling that the same about of black people that showed up to vote for Hillary and going to be the ones voting for Biden and a bunch of us will NOT vote at all.
Since yall dont want people to vote for Joe Biden, and you don't want them voting for 45, should we be voting for Jo Jorgensen or Howie Hawkins?
Biden got railroaded into selecting a POC, when the person he wanted was Gretchen Whitmer, who possibly could have gotten him Michigan. Kamala doesn't bring anything to the table. Under the table? Maybe. Let's ask Willie Brown.
I nominate you Biden/Harris Press Secretary
Biden supports late term abortion!  Thousands of years in purgatory!
I agree living through it was bad. BUT the govt wouldnt have to lock blacks under a "crime bill" if there were opportunities. As a result, Drugs and crime were high. Cant talk about future unless we heal the past. Plus Biden a pedo. And Kamala is not Black American.
They are running on lies; however, let's pray for Joe Biden's health
Biden actually reads the security report every time he gets it. (Not from Fox tv) Biden knows how to read!!!  Biden has empathy. Biden understands what it takes to run a country. Biden is a true patriot. trump is a shit stain on this country.
I’m act watching it on fox entertainment. I want to see what he says about today’s professional speech by Biden!!!!
I would much rather listen to Biden. Hell, I’d rather listen to a monkey babble instead of Trump.
Just chalk it up as Biden/Harris taking a shot at Kanye as well
If you’re not voting or not voting for Biden &amp; Harris please don’t ever speak to me in your life. That simply means you don’t care for humanity.
I don't know. I listen to Black Information Network on the radio. They are major BLM supporters  and they are praising the Biden/Harris ticket as a huge win for black Americans.
I can’t remember where I read the article, but the writer basically said ‘Joe Biden played second fiddle to a younger, less experienced black man with no issue. That’s all I need to know about him.’ I hope they work as a team through this.
I agree. Biden and Harris convincing BLM advocates that they have their interests at heart is a close second.
Your guy talks about POTUS &amp; the KKK but didn’t Joe Biden attend the funeral of a KKK leader? Oh, forgot u &amp; your fake news cohorts are hiding the fact that your guys hero was a leader of the k/k/k YALL SUCK &amp; SAD! Never vote Democrat again EVER!
I’m sorry did I miss this when Biden was VP   for EIGHT years???
Even FOX News has to admit that's an impressive basement Biden has.
Madam Vice President 🇺🇸💙🇺🇸BIDEN/HARRIS
The fact that having a POC in his campaign is defined as “using the race card” is ridiculous. Biden has gone through such tragedy but he and Kamala will still pull through
But did Biden and Harris do the one-handed glass of water thing?
I don’t like Harris or Biden but they are obviously the lesser of 2 evils.
Elizabeth Warren Secretary Of Education Biden going big on big
Oh no she didn’t. Obama and Biden didn’t do much of anything because West African countries did everything. They deal with Ebola outbreaks damn near every year and know how to contain it. Every once in a blue moon there’s an Ebola epidemic. China didn’t do their job.
this must be the most ridiculous thing I've seen from you. Instead of having true journalist like  or  after Biden's press conference you have never Trumper  SAD!
the reason why it tanked was because of Obama !!  did you see what happened with the stock market when biden announced that Harris was going to be his VP pick,  stocks fell over 100 points that tells me a lot
Anyone fact checking biden and harris like media does to Trump?
A historic day--finally, in a good way. So excited for Biden-Harris to right the ship of state so we can stop feeling like we're on the Titanic!
Cnn anchors are creaming their jeans talking about how fantastic Biden/Harris are when they hate on Trump every minute of every day- but hey, they’re not bias!
Under trump im making more money than I ever have, paying less taxes then ever and my IRA is higher than ever before, but Trump IS a jerk. Sooo- do I elect that guy/policies that help me who says stupid things or elect president (Biden) who will hurt all the things I care about?
THE SPORTS ANTIDOTE - THE RESET #9, tomorrow. "The Burden of Taking A Stand." This isn't about Trump v Biden, or Rebub vs Dem -- this about what's right vs. what's wrong, period. College FB is looking up to the #SEC like other countries do 2 America, for help. Also #MMA #Kamala

Joe Biden is in early stages of dementia. So it’s either Trump, a bipolar rapper, or a 80 year grandpa with dementia
Phony Kamla  believed the ones who accused Biden &amp; she was  about it. I don't think Biden would  choose her as VP, b/c they went after each other  the debates. Evidently It wasn't Biden who chose this arrogant, hateful witch for his VP, it was his "handlers".
What channel?  They are all showing Biden/Harris!!!!!!
What a total idiot to say Donal Trump is the cause of this virus and deaths!!!!! We can see she’ll say about anything to keep this position that Biden was forced to give her!
The whole premise of Biden's electability argument was that he appeals to moderates in lieu of the left. By haranguing lefties, you're admitting that was a lie and the only reason he was chosen is because the Dem establishment's real goal is just to protect the status quo.
You know what's fucking hysterical? Neither Trump or Pence can can call Biden or Harris out on their civil rights records. Irony is dead. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Imo, if Biden does decide to debate trump, he should kick trump's teeth out--with FACTS! The TRUTH! PROOF of trump's CORRUPTION and his WORSHIP of America's adversaries! As a nation, we are intelligent enough to recognize a threat to our democracy. donald trump is that threat!😳
Comparing Ebola to Covid is so disingenuous but I’m sure the media will call the Biden camp out on it right? From 2014-2016, around the entire world- less than 30,000 infected with Ebola. 20+ million so far have gotten Covid.
Has Pete Buttigieg met with Biden recently? It would be interesting for the Biden campaign to start announcing cabinet picks as part of a campaign strategy
Watching Biden and Harris! So exciting!! #BidenHarris2020
Didn’t she even state that she believed the women who accused Joe Biden of harassment? Joe Biden and Kamala Harris introduce their presidential ticket in Delaware
“New Orleans for sale”   The “suburban housewife” will be voting for me. They want safety &amp; are thrilled that I ended the long running program where low income housing would invade their neighborhood. Biden would reinstall it, in a bigger form, with Corey Booker in charge!- Trump
Biden/Harris going to win the election due to the extreme circumstances of 2020, learn all the wrong lessons, make very few changes and get absolutely worked by an actual Nazi in 2024
Fake news from team Trump. Biden is absolutely roasting your despot hero.
This is the same thing a socialist Biden administration would do to the entire American economy... Take from the middle class &amp; wealthy resulting in a fast evaporating tax base!  Live it up while you can, I guess.  Truly short sighted!
All IN WITH BIDEN &amp; HARRIS!
Lol. Biden Harris press conference.
Biden/Harris They are killing this speech💥💥
Kamala is a huge political blunder for Biden. - hugely unpopular (especially among POC) - doesn’t win him a state - has a weird obsession w/mass incarceration for blacks which is shown over and over with her record on marijuana and truency
Joseph Bartholemew Biden seems ready.
Joe Biden handing it over to Kamala Harris now. Listen if you aren’t already.
But Biden can say if you don’t vote for him, you ain’t black?
At this point if you’re saying Biden choosing Kamala Harris is what deters you from voting then you probably were never going to vote in the first place
Biden is giving a great speech.  I hope you are watching.
Biden putting me to sleep
In some weird way Biden is fucking with my head because I'm not used to hearing a politician speak in complete and cogent sentences. Like I think I've trained my brain to listen to moronic shit the last couple years.
"Donald Trump has already started with his attacks. Calling Kamala 'nasty'. Whining about how she’s 'mean' to his appointees."  "It’s no surprise. Whining is what Donald Trump does best...Is anyone surprised Donald Trump has a problem with a strong woman?"  Biden brings the heat!
Biden is getting worked up. He must've got a good night's sleep.
RIGHT WING MEDIA IS ALREADY HURLING RACIST, MISOGYNIST FIRE AT Kamala Harris  From abhorrent claims that she isn’t really Black to reliving the Brett Kavanaugh hearings, conservative outlets pounced on Joe Biden’s running-mate pick.
the funniest thing about this biden speech is him reading the teleprompters like there's actually a crowd in the room
KAMALA HARRIS WAS SILENT ABOUT THE PEDOPHILE JOE BIDEN AND HIS PUSSY GRABBING.
It's 2022. Biden/Harris are in office. I am placed on a DHS watchlist for asking the city to install a bus shelter. Things are back to normal.
Joe Biden laughing at Donald Trump is my favorite Joe Biden.
Hahaha  isn't showing the Biden Harris press conference
I can't wait for Joe Biden to be President so I can start calling him on his bullshit. Now's not the time. But I'll get him.

U right so we got 2 make sure we vote, I &amp; many others KNOW that if Biden/Harris win we r so f**ked. I luv ALL your post esp. when u speak up abt the horrific crimes happening 2 children all over this country. #WakeUpAmerica #MAGA2020 #Trump2020
Imagine Hunter Biden going on Fox to promote this. 🙃
i suppose, though the implications and legacies of voting for a biden/harris ticket or a trump/pence ticket do not bode well for me and i will do neither
he’s mostly joking cus i’m so anti biden lmfaooooo it’s just funny cus he’s like WHAT KIND OF SHIT IS THIS 😂😂😂😂
I’m not sure but the Biden supporters who all fallowed him this morning were trashing and unfollowing him so that’s probably why he changed again
Joe Biden Copies Bernie's Medicare For All Rhetoric, But Not the Actual ...  via   is a liar there is no such thing in this world as free you will pay some how. People look at the outta control medical insurance cost since Obamacare
Where the Biden joke tweet/video of them white boys strolling in aka letters ?? Tryna share this laugh with my momma
Sympathetic to the sentiment. But I remain skeptical of the follow through. The preliminaries seem to show people only talk Kamala is when she is facing a defamatory attack. I think people will be more beholden to refuting that, than holding the Biden/Harris admin accountable.
165,000 dead. Millions unemployed. National debt going crazy. And this fool said Biden would be a disaster. Are you crazy? We are in a recession already. Close to being in a depression. All due to Trump’s incompetence &amp; Republicans like Ted Cruz who supported Trump’s incompetence
Feel like Biden, who was going to lose in November anyway, chose Harris to piss of the left so that when he loses he can blame leftists.
Vote for who you want. But, y'all be real life excusing Trump's behavior, and holding Biden and Harris to a higher standard. He's literally on here telling white ppl to vote for him to keep ppl like you out of their neighborhoods. It's crazy
Queen and Biden bout to show up.
But she was chosen cause "black" not indian, dot nota feather kind. Lol.  So its already a biden farce. #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder #1wayOrNoWay #Hypocrite #FactsMatter
joe biden’s email subjects really make me feel some type of way
Biden and Harris are the tools we've been given to effect a specific change in a specific way. Vote. We can still be in the streets, it doesn't invalidate that. We can still fight to push further Left, this doesn't invalidate that. All this piss-taking is a wedge. Come together.
Believed Jussie Smollett &amp; Tara Reid Said "Eighteens to 24s are stupid." Lambasted Biden over racist past. Thinks men should compete athletically with girls. Green New Deal. Eliminate private health insurance. Got 2% of the vote in the primaries.  Open borders. There's more. :-(
if you live in a deeply red state just lie and tell people you are voting for Biden. That’s much easier than explaining the electoral college.
Didn't Kamala Harris say she believed Biden's accusers already?  You know the media won't go there now. They're in protection mode.
Here's the thing about Warren supporters (and I am one) criticizing the Democratic ticket and helping Trump win: Warren will have far more power in a Biden/Harris administration than she will in another Trump term. The best way to support her is to help her side win.
It’s so comforting reading about how a real president operates when a major decision needs to be made  that will affect the actual people of America. A virtual running mate search: How a personal connection led Joe Biden to pick Kamala Harris
Im Trader Joe BidenI wanted our ticket to be Biden/Klobuchar.
Probably the latter if she talks more about herself rather than Joe Biden. Or rather herself and Biden as a team.
Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden’s campaign likened Trump's comments and actions as "sabotage."
I’m happy to read that about the Biden signs.
Joe Biden will not win the presidential election, he will not even be close! However, if he did win his life expectancy would be six months or less and the chick would be the President .
Reminder that if you don’t vote for Biden/Harris , you will have Trump for another 4 years
HAHAHA NO CHANCE IN HELL Biden-Harris wins. This presidential ticket is a JOKE. Anyone that votes for this pair I would almost feel sorry for voting for a couple of incompetent idiots that can't tell the truth and have to advance their career with sexual favors is just sad.
#BIDEN just said masks prevent contracting #Rona #EXPODENTIALLY
Your job is to support BIDEN; but you can also add that your thoughts and feelings maybe different. You maybe able to lobby for a BETTER way. Before, you answer a question Read his PLANS.
Joe Biden never stuttered lady. Go watch his old videos. He's in early stages of dementia or alzheimer's
#WATCH: Steven Maxwell speaks with Stephen Handwerk, the Executive Director of the Louisiana Democrat party, about presidential candidate Joe Biden's pick of Kamala Harris for Vice President.
why is he speaking about the same points since last Friday?  He looks exhausted.  I hate this Trump.  He should be on the offensive and eviscerate Biden and Kamala today.  Quite low energy briefing.
Newsfeed Now: Man hangs off semi; Biden picks running mate.  #NewsfeedNow
This is y’all excuse for not voting: But,... where’s the lie????  #BidenHarris2020
Dr.Marshall, as an advisor to the Trump campaign, I hope you are honing in on Kamala Harris’ anti-catholic bona fides, and advising them how to smack the Biden campaign to win the Catholic vote (nominal catholics or not) due to her anti- catholic bigotry.

You’re too late, Biden

Biden and Harris should get a bus for consistency
I knew that was coming...Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate #2020PresidentialRace #SmartNews
Biden chooses Usain Bolt as his running mate cuz he’s “Hella fast”
I have trouble believing Biden is making any decisions on his own, this is elderly abuse to force someone , obviously non compass mentos, secondary diagnosis pedophilia, onto any platform and expect coherency.  His wife or family should shut the circus down.
I just saw a campaign ad for Biden.  The word “feelings “was used four times by a brown female whose mother had died . The mother was at least 75 years old and “she” just “felt “the president didn’t do a good job.  She felt like Trump was all the problem, THATS IT!!!
I don't need to know now!  I know I'm voting for Biden❤
You dipshits,Bernie personally called President Obama and asked him to stay out of primaries. President Obama honored his wishes. You all acting like the DNC voted we as a party voted. The majority choose VP Biden. No forced hand everyone made there choice.
Guess they made that specifically for Joe Biden
You need to panic cupcake, patriots want you, you owe people in high places that will murder you to collect.  You couldn’t deliver Hillary and you cannot deliver Biden!  Like a whitetail buck with a 🎯 birthmark,
I do too, without taking anything for granted, I think it will be a blood bath.  You know my ex is elected democrat, who is voting against Biden, like she voted against Hillary.  So says my 15 year old son , lol
One thing I believe is that when it comes to trump, it could always get worse. He could still continue to lose more voters to Biden.
Totally lmao at Biden thinking Tik Tok is a breath mint. Needed that laugh 😂
Biden did but  WILL give him a break. They’ll make excuses for him and blame
The fact that so many people hate this man and yet believe Donald Trump to be a man of God truly boggles my mind. Biden’s beliefs are not in lockstep with mine, but at least I can see signs of his faith. Trump only has faith in himself and money.
Options are Trump or Biden. There are no other options. Either GOP or Dems. If you don't vote GOP Wins. If you vote 3rd party GOP Wins. At this point less than a 100 days away if you not helping get Dems in, you're helping GOP.Joe Biden should nominate Hillary Clinton to be the next Attorney General.
I am not excited about Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. She Obama in a dress. No more Joe 😂
The difference here is that  “requested” a ballot, which request comes after certain protocol(s) are met and the ballot is registered. It is not the result of a “mass mailing.” C’mon, Mr. Biden, you’re misleading the public.  MASS MAILINGS are not legal nor safe.  🇺🇸USA🇺🇸
Racial tension is already here. If someone wears a "Biden" shirt he has nothing to fear any where in the country. If I wear a "MAGA" hat in many major cities I run the risk of being physically assaulted.
Fuck anonymous ill go on any record with my views on this.  As a vet and a 18 yr letter carrier no one will bottle up my opinion.  Im very vocal about this.  Im going so far as telling Republicans on my route who i see that i need them to vote for Biden to preserve my job.

(18/18) So yeah...hold Biden &amp; Harris accountable for addressing their past errors in judgement or character but don't for a second be pulling this crap where you're positioning them as a "bad" option when the alternative is SO much worse. Or do you want another 4 years of Trump?
(7/18) ...but in the absence of cooperation and collaboration, they aren't able to benefit from the others' perspectives or insights. I highly recommend everyone read Bill Bishop's "The Big Sort" if they have a problem with the Biden/Harris ticket being imperfect.
(6/18) Biden and Harris arent perfect but you what? They a helluva lot better options than the alternative and we should use their time in office to fight for real change on both sides of the aisle because there are ideas that both Republicans and Democrats have that are good...
(1/18) I don't get why ppl are so obsessed with finding every little thing that Biden or Harris did that didn't perfectly live up to the ideals of Now. I'm not pretending it didn't happen or that they shouldn't be pressured to improve on those past positions but...WTH?
If that’s what Biden and Bitch want, then they probably screwed each other.  Haha!! MAGA KAGA

He also said he would not get behind Biden or Harris but is now endorsing that ticket! He like almost all Democrats are hypocrites and liars!!
How about the post office not going thru their money like they do...any other business is responsible for their finances. They are a private organization, not to mention the letter carriers union endorsed Joe Biden. Stop election fraud...vote in person, with an ID!!!!.
That lil press conference today with liars Biden &amp; Kamala was just a preview. Two sociopathic baby killing, authoritarians with a lust for power and contempt for half the country. Tucker is right. They hate us &amp; they want to punish us for voting for DJT &amp; IF they get power 🇺🇲dies

🚨 Huge peace deal announced by   Obama &amp; Biden chose to deal with the world’s leading terrorism sponsor by sending them pallets of cash &amp; giving them an opening to make nukes.  Trump is uniting our allies to stand up to Iran &amp; protect Israel.  Stark contrast.
I suppose Biden will attack Trump for something so that the American people won't remember that the Obama/Biden Mid-East policy was to give vast sums to Iran and to let them have a nuke after ten years. Biden's policy of appeasement, just as happened with Munich, only brings war.
Biden might have worse PR/media team in history of politics. This added to innumerous virtual meeting gaffes is comical.
Yes,  please look into threats against Joe Biden and Kamala. We're VERY concerned about the threats posed by people like
OK, enough about Harris. Just as so many VP candidates she will probably end up as another footnote in history anyway. Now lets talk about Biden's history &amp; policies writ large!

Yes I did. Biden/Harris makes trump look and sound stupid.
I sure hope y’all are right. I see signs then I just feel like no one is going to have the balls to come forward. Biden blew Trumps ass away today. I loved everything he said. He makes trump really sound stupid!

Staggering how Biden and Kumoltta Harris just outright lie. Heels Up Harris said Trump ran Obama economy into ground. Now this. Are people really this stupid and uninformed?  Oh wait, some liberals might be reading this...
Love these liberals telling us how Joe is going to unite the country. "They gonna put yall back in chains"
They are running on lies; however, let's pray for Joe Biden's health
I’m act watching it on fox entertainment. I want to see what he says about today’s professional speech by Biden!!!!
I would much rather listen to Biden. Hell, I’d rather listen to a monkey babble instead of Trump.
I don't know. I listen to Black Information Network on the radio. They are major BLM supporters  and they are praising the Biden/Harris ticket as a huge win for black Americans.
I can’t remember where I read the article, but the writer basically said ‘Joe Biden played second fiddle to a younger, less experienced black man with no issue. That’s all I need to know about him.’ I hope they work as a team through this.
I agree. Biden and Harris convincing BLM advocates that they have their interests at heart is a close second.
What channel?  They are all showing Biden/Harris!!!!!!
Watching Biden and Harris! So exciting!! #BidenHarris2020
All IN WITH BIDEN &amp; HARRIS!

Get it. They are taking advantage of Kanye who is mentally ill to run hoping he takes votes from Biden.
Make no mistake: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are completely controlled by the radical left.  They’ll both do anything to please the Bernie Sanders wing of the party—they already proved that during the primaries.
Its ironic that that mainstream Dems from union families have the most to lose from Biden/Harris. They will lose their hard won health-care insurance to a government run plan.
Well this is one surburban housewife here in the south that will not be voting for you. I would feel much safer for the future is Biden/Harris won. But please keep believing otherwise.
Vegas odds on how long before Biden sniffs Kamala in public: Over/Under: 7 days.

Is anyone in the media going to point out that the Biden/Harris ticket is the most hostile pairing the DNC could put forward to the BLM movement? #BidenHarris2020
Same here. John Lewis urged Joe Biden to have a black woman as VP. To show they cared about what he thought, Biden, choose Kamala Harris.
The plan is for the Dems to steal the election with mail in votes! That’s why they are keeping Biden and picked Harris as VP, so they can give America a HIGE SLAP IN THE FACE!! They will “find” more votes until they win it all!!
Biden clearly didn’t read the room correctly
Conservative Catholics call on Biden to break 'deafening silence' on anti-Catholic vandalism, arson
It's not "bad faith spin" to question your tweet when your two scenarios are:  1) AOC challenges Kamala in 2024 after Biden steps down after one term  2) AOC challenges Kamala after she wins in 2024, after one term.
The elite think that we the people are stupid. Yesterday the Wrestler Kamala The giant died and Today Joe Biden name’s his running mates coincidence I think not.
No more Joe!!! We don’t want Joe Biden for president or his running mate. We have had enough of the Obamas in the White House. It’s not a black issue or a white issue it’s a right issue
I’m ready to go vote. Biden/Harris.
I like my kernels popped!!!go Biden/Harris
Is Biden not catholic? I’m shocked.
No want Joe Biden or his running mate
We have got to keep Joe Biden out of the White House. He selected female Barack Obama to be Vice President let’s start a campaign no more joe
Lady g  what do you make of all the ppl saying Harris thought Biden was not a good candidate then changed her tone later?
Biden choose this crazy for his VP today so much hatred YIKES... #dictator #democrat #farleft #wwg1wga #Trump2020
I can't wait to cast my vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for President and Vice President.   Time to get those trashy corrupt trumps out the White House. It's time to take our country back from those criminals in the White House and corrupt Republicans in the Senate.   Vote!
So, what do you think Trump would to Biden in a debate.
Which makes her a hypocrite for joing joe biden.   I wonder what it will cost... Btw we need her senate seat RED in cali
Riding with Biden!
"I believe them and I respect them being able to tell their story and having the courage to do it," Harris said at a presidential campaign event in Nevada.

We didn’t need any more proof that Joe Biden isn’t the so-called moderate he pretends to be—but we just got it. Just like him, Kamala Harris will say and do anything to please the radical left.
Biden has said he was picking an African-American woman for VP, and he actually chooses a Jamacan-Indian instead.  Does he really know what he did?
Kamala Harris should decline Biden offer. 🤷🏾‍♂️  Because one thing Kamala, she gon make sure somebody.......never mind.

He did? In what way? 3 debates scheduled, Biden to debate in the standard THREE.
Fox News shows Biden answering a question, following it with a joke, while riding a bike, and wearing a mask.  All while the current Fox News "opinion talk shows" talking points are "Biden is hiding in a basement and mentally impaired"
Fox News knows their base is dumb and can watch this segment, then literally 10 seconds later be told Biden is hiding in a basement, and they'll believe it. Their tiny goldfish brains are the reason they are Fox News viewers to begin with.
Intelligence officials provide details on Russian disinformation campaign against Biden: report -

So your going to vote for Biden who is not capable of running our country? You better open your eyes to what’s really happening in our country! Is this what you want for the future of your child?
Yes, where's  ?? Oh that's right, she's running a sham campaign for her mentally ill husband to undermine Biden😡. Sure, sure, she's an advocate for "prison reform". Only when it suits her agenda, though, amirite?

Are ya sure he’s as bad as Biden? I think there both older then dirt but Biden can even get one sentence out
He is. God just can’t take anymore of Biden stumbling to speak. Biden is killing him with dementia. 😂😂😂
Let me ask a few questions:  When President Obama and Vice President Biden were in office, did they take your guns away? NO! Did they take away your religion? NO! Did they take away your bibles? NO!   DONALD TRUMP IS A LIAR!
I highly doubt it. U just don't get it. In 2016 ppl voted for u cuz they didn't like Hillary &amp; thought that u would be the lesser of 2 evils. Now that ppl have seen u in action, most regret it. Some ppl will vote for Biden simply b/c he's not u. Ur braindead cult is all you got.
Remember Biden called God - a thing?
Democrats are going to lose in November and they deserve it. Joe Biden shouldn't have been the nominee
I think most people agree that Trump has said many problematic things. Why is it so hard to admit that Biden has as well?You liberals do realize that joe Biden dies not send out those teeets?!?! He dies not have the mental capacity to do it
No she will hang Biden

This week the Not Real News focuses on false news that spread about Sen. Kamala Harris after presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden announced Tuesday she would be his running mate.
Awe, look at  Biden he can repeat what governors, Fauci, cDC, WHO and Trump have been saying for months.
Biden has a history of racist comments during his 40 years in the Senate.
I think we’re just saying fuck the top period. They not for us Trump or Biden. That’s it,I don’t think we’re concerned with whatever everybody else wanna do.
Joe Biden is not the meme you love — this is the dark truth about his voting record | The Independent
Please enumerate Biden’s successes. I don’t know of any achievements he made in his 40 years!
Ironic. Race relations deteriorated under the Obama-Biden administration. That is a fact and easily fact checked.
Biden has a racist track record and  Harris prosecuted minor drug offenses that increased black incarceration! These are facts not conjecture!
By not voting for Biden you are voting for tRump! If you are not happy with how things are now, then be part of the change that this country desperately needs! What we have now is a dictator that is killing our country!
Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden’s campaign likened Trump's comments and actions as "sabotage."
2020 Biden Accomplishments 1. Ended the #MeToo movement 2.  Made the most racist statement in politics “you ain’t black unless you vote for me” and 3 selected a vp who believes Bidens accusers and who’s ancestors owned slaves.
Apparently the “racist” part is ”false.” Not necessarily. Harris’ comments about Biden would lead one to interpret her calling him a racist. So through your point of view she did and I agree.   These “fact checkers” are being way too pedantic on this one.

Pet sure that’s more people than we’re at the Biden/Harris rally the other night!! 🤣🤣🤣🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸✝️✝️✝️
You’re right.  National polls suggest 4points as Biden’s lead. HRC has the same lead at this point in time!
I’ve been predicting that the Biden/Harris administration is going to be hostile toward the disabled. This doesn’t comfort me any, I hope he isn’t brought on if they win.
Let me tell you this, Joe Biden will NEVER be President! How does it feel to know that you are nothing more than a token? Black and a woman that’s all they based your qualifications on, but you’re really NOT black so...... just because you’re a woman 😂
Pro-life movement leans into 2020 election to boost Trump, claiming issue 'has gone from liability to asset'
“It’s not about your rights”  This should be troubling to all. Our rights are protected by the Constitution. Biden doesn’t have the option to override our rights just because he thinks it’s our “responsibility.” He could say anything is our responsibility to deny us our rights.

Maybe Biden and Harris can pose for a pic with their pants unbuttoned holding a glass of "black water." I hear it's the latest in devout Christian leadership.
I can tell you this Catholic is voting for Biden and Kamala Harris!
I'm sure this question had absolutely nothing to do with trumpie saying yesterday that Biden should disavow antifa. Surely, this wasn't a plant!🤔
Voters opinions of Biden are clearly the least consequential thing in American politics right now, it does not matter one bit (unfortunately)
I agree with this, and I’ve gone back and forth between Jorgensen and Biden, but this honestly is NOT the year to vote 3rd party. 3rd party won’t win this year, and it’s splitting the Dem vote to ensure Trump wins.
Latest Polls Show Trump Closing on Biden

Legally there's nothing to prevent Hunter Biden being the next attorney general is there??
The reason why  Is blocking subpoenas for James Comey and John Brennan is bc he was in on the attempted coup. He was mad at trump for not giving him a cabinet position so he decided to help get Trump impeached. he was probably offered a position in the Biden cabinet
Do you believe the WOMEN accusing Biden of sexual assault?
You said "IT WAS A DEBATE" to justify your attacks on Biden. You also said you believed Biden's sexual assault accusers. So was it a debate or do you believe them? Using sexual assault victims for votes is unethical and gross!
Do tell what has Biden done in the last 47 years? How about this malleable VP Harris switching support! Your misinformed  and pathetic🤷‍♀️

That being said, it looks like Joe Biden’s symptoms are progressing. Stress will exacerbate it. As the disease progresses, watch for him to get easily agitated, difficulty with formulating words for responses. New surroundings will freak them out. Just observe.

This account of how Biden made his decision, the most important of his political career, is based on interviews with 10 people with direct knowledge of the vetting and selection process.
If Biden becomes president I am confident he will commit suicide within 6 months of taking office 😳

Better we had lost World War II and still be part of the Third Reich than have a Joe Biden Presidency!
She could be right.  Once Biden is declared incompetent, president Harris will need a VP.  Fits the narrative.
Congrats to a dynamic and human Presidential candidate Joe Biden for picking an equally accomplished running mate Kamala Harris.  Let’s go get’em!   Trump-Lock’em up!!!
So... Kamala supports and believes Joe Biden’s victims, but she’s gonna do everything in her power to get him in office? Because what’s better than an unabashed racist sexual predator? Oh right, a racist sexual predator that pretends he’s not one.

If Joe Rogan &amp; the Bros are committed to voting 45 out, which means voting for Biden, then I welcome their support just as I do Navarro’s. If Hispanic Dems believe 4 more years of 45 is best, they are amongst 29% of their own &amp; 13% of Black men who helped get us into this mess.
Twenty-nine percent of Latinos voted for 45 versus 8% of Blacks. Proof that Biden’s point has validity. Same point applies to the fact that 13% of Black men voted for 45 versus only 3% of Black women &amp; I welcome Navarro &amp; any others who will help regain the White House &amp; Senate.
She explains it so well.  Just listen to Joe Biden speak.... and the others.

Joe Biden is a child molester. This ought to be an issue. It’s not funny. It’s disgusting.

Its hard work trying to undo the many laws you (Biden) helped pass that put police in a position where they had to incarcerate nonviolent citizens.   It's hilarious you position yourself as a solution.  You are part of the problem.
Wake up sir. Trump can have any woman he wants and you think he wanted her? Do you also think the woman who accused Biden of attempting to finger her is telling the truth or is it one sided?
Trump allies have ears to hear Biden, eyes to see his actions which indicate his mental challenges. It's unethical for Democrats to promote him for president. Biden's family should be ashamed of putting him before the public to see his health issues making him an unfit candidate.
At least Trump took a few tough questions  Biden takes no tuff questions and if he does he calls the black reporter a “junkie”

And I think, correct me if I’m wrong, the original tweet dealt with what Biden said, not how he said it. You weren’t the one to suggest it had to do with his speech?
No I get it. You’re using your knowledge to excuse Biden’s behavior
About 8 years ago biden tore Ryan a new one at debate. You think he could do it now?
And if you think trump and Biden will approach that issue in the same way then you are delusional.
Let’s not forget Biden’s role as well!
I'm no fan of Trump.   Democrats have a huge open door, so they elect Joe Biden as their candidate. 👀  Why can't we have a high character, thoughtful, no racist option for President? Is that too much to ask?  This election, like last election, is a race to the bottom. #grieving
That guy got knocked the FFFUUUCCKK OUT! sweet. Wear a damn mask I mean come on this how it all begins and I’ve got a bad feeling gonna get worse from here especially if we re-elect the same orange POTUS. Biden is up there so I would say the VO nom could be the most important
They are in Hidin like Biden. They got nothing so they keep in their dark little holes like the cockroaches they are.
I would vote today if I could - for Biden!
Here’s another one from Biden- he’s disgusting
I dug up Biden’s ongoing truth. Your denial is typical.
Why would you only report on one side of the story.  The negative side to be exact. Put Trump aside, don’t really care but your have shared Nothing on Biden, Yates or Riots. Just being realistic and want the real story.
Vote for Biden, you get socialism.
This doesn’t even make sense. You’re starting to sound like Biden...deranged.
He said nothing about Catholics hating the Bible or being ignorant of scripture. He said Joe Biden is against the Bible, that is the same Joe Biden who has supported abortion for most of his adult life.
Biden sticks his foot in his mouth over and over
So Trump is a fascist because he won’t close down the country or Force a mask mandate or bc he won’t force the schools to stay closed down. There’s not one thing Joe Biden would have done better about this virus. Not One!!
Tbh both Trump and Biden is proving we need an age cap on government seats
Facts. That is only the tip of the iceberg. Joe Biden is trash.
I had no idea trump thought Biden is SO POWERFUL that he could hurt God? Trump must be terrified! We all know what a religious man trump is!  He actually stood in front of a church sign and held a Bible one time. I saw it with my own eyes just how much faith that man has...

This week the Not Real News focuses on false news that spread about Sen. Kamala Harris after presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden announced Tuesday she would be his running mate.
Awe, look at  Biden he can repeat what governors, Fauci, cDC, WHO and Trump have been saying for months.
Biden has a history of racist comments during his 40 years in the Senate.
I think we’re just saying fuck the top period. They not for us Trump or Biden. That’s it,I don’t think we’re concerned with whatever everybody else wanna do.
Joe Biden is not the meme you love — this is the dark truth about his voting record | The Independent
Please enumerate Biden’s successes. I don’t know of any achievements he made in his 40 years!
Ironic. Race relations deteriorated under the Obama-Biden administration. That is a fact and easily fact checked.
Biden has a racist track record and  Harris prosecuted minor drug offenses that increased black incarceration! These are facts not conjecture!
By not voting for Biden you are voting for tRump! If you are not happy with how things are now, then be part of the change that this country desperately needs! What we have now is a dictator that is killing our country!
Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden’s campaign likened Trump's comments and actions as "sabotage."
2020 Biden Accomplishments 1. Ended the #MeToo movement 2.  Made the most racist statement in politics “you ain’t black unless you vote for me” and 3 selected a vp who believes Bidens accusers and who’s ancestors owned slaves.
Apparently the “racist” part is ”false.” Not necessarily. Harris’ comments about Biden would lead one to interpret her calling him a racist. So through your point of view she did and I agree.   These “fact checkers” are being way too pedantic on this one.

You’re right.  National polls suggest 4points as Biden’s lead. HRC has the same lead at this point in time!
I’ve been predicting that the Biden/Harris administration is going to be hostile toward the disabled. This doesn’t comfort me any, I hope he isn’t brought on if they win.
Let me tell you this, Joe Biden will NEVER be President! How does it feel to know that you are nothing more than a token? Black and a woman that’s all they based your qualifications on, but you’re really NOT black so...... just because you’re a woman 😂
Pro-life movement leans into 2020 election to boost Trump, claiming issue 'has gone from liability to asset'
“It’s not about your rights”  This should be troubling to all. Our rights are protected by the Constitution. Biden doesn’t have the option to override our rights just because he thinks it’s our “responsibility.” He could say anything is our responsibility to deny us our rights.

Maybe Biden and Harris can pose for a pic with their pants unbuttoned holding a glass of "black water." I hear it's the latest in devout Christian leadership.
I can tell you this Catholic is voting for Biden and Kamala Harris!
I'm sure this question had absolutely nothing to do with trumpie saying yesterday that Biden should disavow antifa. Surely, this wasn't a plant!🤔
Voters opinions of Biden are clearly the least consequential thing in American politics right now, it does not matter one bit (unfortunately)
I agree with this, and I’ve gone back and forth between Jorgensen and Biden, but this honestly is NOT the year to vote 3rd party. 3rd party won’t win this year, and it’s splitting the Dem vote to ensure Trump wins.

Legally there's nothing to prevent Hunter Biden being the next attorney general is there??
The reason why  Is blocking subpoenas for James Comey and John Brennan is bc he was in on the attempted coup. He was mad at trump for not giving him a cabinet position so he decided to help get Trump impeached. he was probably offered a position in the Biden cabinet
Do you believe the WOMEN accusing Biden of sexual assault?
You said "IT WAS A DEBATE" to justify your attacks on Biden. You also said you believed Biden's sexual assault accusers. So was it a debate or do you believe them? Using sexual assault victims for votes is unethical and gross!
Do tell what has Biden done in the last 47 years? How about this malleable VP Harris switching support! Your misinformed  and pathetic🤷‍♀️

This account of how Biden made his decision, the most important of his political career, is based on interviews with 10 people with direct knowledge of the vetting and selection process.
If Biden becomes president I am confident he will commit suicide within 6 months of taking office 😳

Better we had lost World War II and still be part of the Third Reich than have a Joe Biden Presidency!
She could be right.  Once Biden is declared incompetent, president Harris will need a VP.  Fits the narrative.
Congrats to a dynamic and human Presidential candidate Joe Biden for picking an equally accomplished running mate Kamala Harris.  Let’s go get’em!   Trump-Lock’em up!!!
So... Kamala supports and believes Joe Biden’s victims, but she’s gonna do everything in her power to get him in office? Because what’s better than an unabashed racist sexual predator? Oh right, a racist sexual predator that pretends he’s not one.

If Joe Rogan &amp; the Bros are committed to voting 45 out, which means voting for Biden, then I welcome their support just as I do Navarro’s. If Hispanic Dems believe 4 more years of 45 is best, they are amongst 29% of their own &amp; 13% of Black men who helped get us into this mess.
Twenty-nine percent of Latinos voted for 45 versus 8% of Blacks. Proof that Biden’s point has validity. Same point applies to the fact that 13% of Black men voted for 45 versus only 3% of Black women &amp; I welcome Navarro &amp; any others who will help regain the White House &amp; Senate.

China &amp; all the dishonest Americans who have been receiving money from China at the expense of our government "would prefer Biden." Nancy included. Drain the swamp!
Its hard work trying to undo the many laws you (Biden) helped pass that put police in a position where they had to incarcerate nonviolent citizens.   It's hilarious you position yourself as a solution.  You are part of the problem.
Wake up sir. Trump can have any woman he wants and you think he wanted her? Do you also think the woman who accused Biden of attempting to finger her is telling the truth or is it one sided?
Trump allies have ears to hear Biden, eyes to see his actions which indicate his mental challenges. It's unethical for Democrats to promote him for president. Biden's family should be ashamed of putting him before the public to see his health issues making him an unfit candidate.
At least Trump took a few tough questions  Biden takes no tuff questions and if he does he calls the black reporter a “junkie”

Biden has had 45 yrs to make a difference and never solved anything. Just name one. He personifies the Establishment career politician that is the root of the problem.
That if ever President will never know he won. Biden can't zip his own pants. Poor sleepy Joe. Used by the demoncrats. Trump will continue to drain the swamp and save our children. You don't get it, try to read.  #Trump2020 #DraintheSwamp #SaveOurChildren

Biden done lost his bid to be President in 2020.
Mr. Biden why didn't you chose a tiger to defeat Trump in November? Elizabeth Warren should have being your #1 VP picked.
I felt proud watching Joe Biden and Kamala Harris rollout today. They were wonderful! Very proud and blessed to have them fighting for us
Black folks are truly slave minded sheep...where was all this talk about Harris before Biden announced her as his running mate?
Biden and Harris were wondeful today, but I doubt a ticket with God and Christ on it can  defeat cheaters to the extent we now know we r dealing with. Cheaters have infiltrated sports more and more. How often we see an overt miscall cost the real " winner" the game. Cheating wins
except it's more like Harris/Biden; we know who will really be running things
Harris, Biden said at a high school gymnasium in his hometown of WIlmington, Delaware, is “smart, she’s tough, she’s experienced, she’s a proven fighter for the backbone of this country.”
Did realize Tucker Carlson was a Biden/Harris fan until last night when he informed his audience that PresidentTrashCan's agenda is dead in the waters because of the BlueWaveTsunami coming November 3, 2020. Thanks Tucker!
PSA: The same political party that says boys who feel pretty can identify as girls &amp; compete in female sports, think drag queen storytime hour for kids is fine, &amp; believe in 182 different genders...are excited that Biden picked a VP that is a...wait for it...woman. *sad trombone*
Biden pushed 93 crime bill. Kamala put minorities in jail using it. Trump can say “they put your ass in jail, I got you out”

Screw that! Trump vs Biden and Pence vs Harris
Yeah I’m Taking Trump over Joe Biden
Minutes after Kamala Harris was announced as Joe Biden's running mate, sexist and false posts were circulating on social media.
It’s simple, a vote for Biden/Harris is a vote for communism and lawlessness.  A vote for Trump is a vote for our freedom and the right to continue to pursue the American dream.
Worst choice ever. I’m so excited. She even said Biden was racist
Wow, the Lincoln Project has already come out  with a wondeful ad. BIDEN AND HARRIS!!! Its wonderful. Traditional gops were not the same types as trump and his magas. I seldom agreed with their policy , but I did respect their character . They detest trump and their opp ads r gr8
He definitely is still a dangerous fraud, but at least he seems to now understand the need to beat Trump, unlike other progressive pundits like Crystal Ball, who tweeted out bullshit blaming Biden and Harris for most of the unfairness in our criminal justice system, smh.
Biden will not be President in 2020.
Joe Biden should have picked you as his VP he's going to regret it.
So I guess that means the Russians who supported Sanders campaign, and are still helping Trump, must also not like Biden’s VP Pick!
Kamala Harris literally called Joe Biden a racist and now she’s his running mate lol
I imagine u mute biden. By his own admission he makes gaffes  We r not flawless. If u expect that if me u think I am much better than I am
We have a team... maybe the strongest since Obama and Biden. I understand and relate to dems who did not favor this ticket. But all u should have to do is recall all the unnecessary lives lost bc of bozo bungling pandemic. And vote biden / harris . not being putin puppets helps
Joe Biden picking Kamala Harris as his VP is the equivalent of Palpatine picking Anakin as his Padawan. Biden will shock you, Harris will kill younglings.

#BREAKING Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate for 2020 Presidential Race
Joe Biden has selected his running mate.
Joe Biden is expected to announce his pick for vice president, as early as today, according to CNN.  #NationalNews
Kamala Harris might also be to whom he was referring when he promised to put the first black woman on scotus in RBG place and we know RBG will likely retire the moment Biden is announced to have won the WH
Thanks to John Kasich for speaking at our convention to implore fellow gops to vote Biden
As with a normal convention, Biden's acceptance speech will conclude the proceedings Thursday night. He is expected to speak live from his home state of Delaware, though the campaign has not announced a venue.
Biden wouldn't make a pimple on a pesidents ass
Sorry, but Biden’s Gaffes seem to have anti black stereotypes constantly laced in them. There is a difference.
If the occasional gaffe is your concern then surely Biden is a hard No for you.
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED Bravo, Ryan! There's only one way to ensure a Joe Biden defeat in 2020: sabotage mail-in ballots; close voting locations; scrub voter registration rolls; and, peel off BernieBros using a third party candidate. GOT IT!
Insane is thinking Joe biden would make a good president
I don't know if I've ever thought about it, but the utter lack of democracy in this process astounds me. Biden just gets to choose whoever he wants?? That's so much power in one person's hands
Fox News today; Bill Hemmer did Sean Combs seriously call white people Devils? Did he seriously call Biden a Devil too?
Byron York's Daily Memo: Actually, Joe Biden has plenty of time to announce VP
The VP choice may shift the focus of the race onto Biden -- not a place some Democrats are comfortable given his proclivity for gaffes and the lack of excitement behind his candidacy.
The point is that unlike your kid and Joe Biden, Trump is not in good enough shape to walk down a ramp without help, and there’s no way in hell he could ride a bike further than your 5 year old!
“Rion said that Derkach was just one of the people who have been giving her material.”  Andriy Derkach is a KGB-trained politician from a pro-Russian political party with the cheerful and apt nickname of ‘Ukrainian Putin’ — and he’s very proud of it.
Biden doesn’t wan’t to debate because he doesn’t know how stupid he’ll sound.   The Democratic party agrees. They know he’ll sound like a fucking idiot.   It’s sad to see an ill and elderly man being manipulated and abused like this.
Did you just reference polls? Polls were very certain in 2016 and they were very wrong. Biden is so unpopular that I believe hell win.
Yea. Half of the population supports Trump. He created the most powerful economy the world ever saw. He created so many jobs. My investments were growing at insane rates. (Still are). Biden is just an openly racist dementia patient.
Biden should be,what state am In,or is that my wife or my sister. 50 yrs in washington and hasnt done anything......
Biden is in no shape to debate trump,mentally
And how many do you think would be dead if Biden were President? We already know he was against the travel ban. And all of the things he said he would implement have already been implemented by Trump.
The old saying is if you every learned how to ride a bike you will never forget. It must be true because Biden forgets everything else!!!
Only that scum Biden 😡😡
Trump campaign adviser: 'Biden is actually a very good debater'
Democratic voters are eager to hear who former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, will pick to be his running mate --  #NationalNews #Politics
Hmmmm , I’m pretty sure Biden said Trump said drink bleach, but when asked where he got that info he didn’t clarify, but hey look it up yourself . It took me 3 mins to find before I just posted false info to sound smart!!
All I can do is laugh. Biden is not who the Demoncrats have prepped for POTUS. He's a decoy. Please sign an executive order for stimulus. Demoncrats don't care if we live or die.
He will ANNOUNCE impending vaccine with grandiose ways he will disseminate it. After Ukraine we know he was willing 4 them to simply make an ANNOUNCEMENT they were investigating biden. He didn't care wasnt no there there
It has been leaked that intell is seeing russian activity to disparage and undermine biden , while boosting trump. Surprised? They r working on an even bolder scale than in 2016.and people think he will be hurt by NRA when world dictators r working 4 him? Lol
Activists with GOP ties are working to get Kanye on the ballots.

Really? I only read the title but if its accurate, then I’ve lost some of the respect i have for your opinions and insight. He could pick Judge Janine or any other nightmare nominee and I would still advocate for you to vote for Biden bc its a binary choice and Trump must go!

President Trump says Joe Biden is against God.SOME IF HER PEOPLE WORK FOR BIDEN. THAT IS THE ONES STILL LIVING
Lol. Not since Reagan have we had a President who has done everything to advance America and the economy. Nice try by the way sulky Democrats trying to impeach him for dare bringing to light Biden's quid pro quo deal with Ukraine.

Trump is doing such at effective job at destroying the United States, don't see why people think Biden will be able to destroy it in a more effective fashion.
Ideologically speaking I agree. But the Democratic Party is being represented by power hungry globalists. Striking similarities between joe Biden and George bush jrs policies. I don’t see GWBjr as a good president. He got us involved in the Middle East. a known cluster fuck
If you needed one last, compelling reason to NOT vote Biden-Harris, here you go.
Straight from the pollster’s mouth: “Some might think this is evidence of shy Trump voters. But the more straightforward interpretation is that Biden supporters are a bit more likely to think there are a good number of Trump voters living next door.”

Word meanings are arbitrary.  Political terms are useful insofar as they indicate a meaningful difference. With Biden and Trump it's more easy to indicate differences in something like global warming. But in foreign policy both are right-wing hawks.
Who does Harris think she is she does not pick who sits as a judge watch Biden not fit they know the ringer will come in shortly sit back and watch America burn if don’t vote Trump
Maybe libs really think that they can now do the flawless argument of saying that not voting for the Biden/Harris ticket is racist.
What will Hillary do if Biden steps down and Pelosi becomes Harris' vp? She said she wanted to help in any way that she could. Would she be willing to be in the shadows while puppeting Harris? Would Harris allow it?
Wonder how many radlibs are shocked about leftists not suddenly bending over and lining up to support Biden after he picked a cop as VP.
Biden is a right-wing nationalist.
Remember that the US is racist enough to reelect Trump. It is also racist enough to elect Biden.
The Twitter SJWs not waiting until December to hold Biden/Harris accountable (which they deserve to be) is the “new Hillary emails” of 2020. You’re literally just shooting the cause in the foot.
You’re confusing the president with Nature.  And ya boy Biden been at it for what 40 plus years and done soooo much more.  Little girls all over the world just cringe knowing he fixing to put his hairy legs in a pool near them.... smh 🤦‍♂️
well ya but the Ukraine thing threatened Biden's political dynasty. clearly more important than literal fascism.

Hell no!!!  We the people deserve to see any presidential candidate discuss the issues with his opponent face to face. It’s disgusting to see you try to hide Biden’s true mental state.  It’s even worse thst his family allows this to continue.

Although I believe that Biden and Harris is what we need, I think they still should earn my vote and be criticized for their past, we need to know we can trust them with our future and be able to hold them accountable as well.
Everytime they come into leadership, we lose jobs, crime rates skyrocket, the cities and states get filthy, hates crimes start reoccurring (some of them wouldn't have jobs if they didn't exploit race - Al Sharpton, Kamala Harris, and Joe Biden), school performance declines!
I want to learn more as a human, but I’m confused about some of the double standards in this world. Are Biden’s comments just ignored?! Swept under the rug because politically he’s trying to win the vote of a race?! Teach me! DM me Ryan!
I feel safer with Trump/Pence than Biden:Harris!
I love how Harris is running for vp after completely trashing Biden in the primaries 🤣
Hillary Clinton says she's ready to serve in Biden administration Haven’t these clowns served us enough??
Agree with u 💯!  And Biden accepting the nomination next week - all his evil deeds and this is allowed - unbelievable! It sickens me !

Ignore it they may but the Israel-UAE deal isn’t going away  Now that so many members of the swamp have accepted prominent roles with the Biden campaign, they might want to consider where they went wrong - for the umpteenth time about Trump
Biden bails out his son Hunter with a billion dollars of U.S. taxpayers money and nobody says anything but let Trump get a little pee on him and he’s freaking Al Capone... I don’t remember when they made golden showers illegal...I also don’t think this ever happened!
The Supreme Court will not allow him to toss out valid mail in ballots. He can wail and scream all he wants but that’s not going to happen. There is also another scenario - Biden wins in-person votes (maybe by a slim margin) and Trump ends up needing mail in votes.
Do you think there’s any scenario, including tmassive foreign interference and indirect mail-in ballot tampering (USPS sabotage) and direct tampering (straight up interference from Fed govt), where Biden doesn’t win the popular vote anyways?
Joe Biden does not want to take our guns.   I just want my bump stocks back.  Wonder who took those away from me?

At what point do officials like Barr and DeJoy begin to factor in the chances of a Biden victory -- and their own possible prosecution for election-rigging crimes -- as they plot their responses to Trump's suggestions/hectoring?
Ppl be so stuck on not wanting to vote. Not agreeing with Biden and Harris which I’m not fond of either...but the fact Trump has made a wag for him to cheat again isn’t surprising. Scared ass.
I'm not following. Neither Biden nor Palin had Ivy League degrees and they were on major party tickets in 2008. There's a lot to celebrate about the Biden/Harris ticket, though. Maybe including that both candidates are grads of public undergrad/public law schools?
I hate Biden more than Trump.
Biden is a pervert!!!
Prediction: Trump dumps Pence and taps Nikki Haley as his VP candidate at his COVID press conference next Thursday to try to distract America from Biden's acceptance speech.   Another prediction: The only group this will energize is his base. Nobody else will care.

How about #JusticeForCannonHinnant instead of getting a shallow laugh? This is the bullshit you wanna tweet 😆 but nothing about all the pedos in y'alls isle either?well?  you're a coward. Biden sniffs kids on camera
I hope you didn't pay a lot for this video. The one of Biden on the train tracks was much more entertaining.
I think he underestimated Trump's chances last time, but I'm afraid we're going to see a lot more people scoffing at him and putting up their 99% Biden predictions
A FB friend posted: “I’ll eat expired, unrefrigerated sushi prepared in a hospital’s COVID ward by a homeless meth addict before I vote for Biden/Harris.” I agree! 🤣🤣🤣
Just wait til he learns that Biden might go after cheese next. We cannot let them cut the cheese.
If anybody even thinks about trying to defend this bs, delete yourself, because if you try to defend Trump's lawyer saying Kamala Harris (who was born in Oakland, CA) isn't American, you're an idiot and you're dead to me. Try Jesus...not me.
so is Biden.. 🤷🏽‍♀️
not a bunch of republicans ranting about Biden picking a VP based off of race. as if the GOP hasn’t picked white nominees the past 42 elections
Neither does Biden ) I mean if u have committed a federal offense- should u be allowed to run ?  Really ?  We need to know these things !
Because they realize that even if she wasn't their first pick, she and Joe Biden are our only hope to get rid of 45. If that's going to happen, we have to stick together. We can push for more progressive policy once the shit gibbon is out of office.  IT'S CALLED PRAGMATISM.
Donald trump sat back and let 140,000+ American citizens die under his nose.... how can Biden possibly be worse?!?
I sure hope ur right ! It’s just been dragging on to Long - I think The Who’s world is confused and needs so kind of truth to hold on too - and it needs to happen now - it’s getting to close to election time - and it’s a joke it they continue with this whole Biden - harris ticket
You have two choices Biden or Trump. Either way, you have to live with consequence of your vote or your failure to vote. The decision is yours. #vote2020
Good luck with that clown. Biden doesn't even know what day it is and his running mate doesn't know if she's Indian or African American. Y'all can't be this stupid to vote for ppl like that. Wait nvm, y'all really are that stupid.
He said not life shattering- we all know the investigation is wrapped up and there was federal crimes committed by Biden and Obama - get the info out - the more u keep it from us - the more ppl are going to say they have no evidence ‘
Trump be saying some ignorant shit but..... Biden a J O K E

So Biden is an autocrat
Interesting?  I’m curious about the statement he made about no active investigation into Biden and Obama at this time - does this leave the door open for it to happen 60 days before the election ?  We want to know this before the election not after - it doesn’t take 6 years .....
If Biden’s elected yes. Even then Dejoy would argue he took the actions to make USPS more cost effective. How would you prove otherwise?

So I saw Barr talking - What’s the deal with saying they expect no criminal investigation into Obama and Biden ?  I thought we were expecting this to happen ?  Very confusing information right now ! Anyone agree ??)

Even Democrats don’t like Kamala Harris. In the Democrat primary, she did not even make it to the Iowa Causes or the New Hampshire primary  If Democrats don’t like her, how does Biden expect Americans to like her.

Joe Biden &amp; his supporters on Joe's racist association with the klansmen sound a lot like Duke Metger &amp; Rhoadie in Tales from the Hood  0:56:22 mins  "We all, have a past. Its a better man who can learn from his failures. I know I have learned from mine and I'm better for it."
Democrats are welcoming the selection of California Senator Kamala Harris as the running mate of former Vice President Joe Biden for the upcoming presidential election.
just let there slip show! Biden for president? The puppeteer just revealed himself  busted!
While speaking together as running mates for the first time Wednesday, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris sharply criticized President Trump’s job performance during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Honestly, I’m ok with the comparisons to 2016. It may just be the Nick Saban fan in me, but you have to play like you’re down 50 no matter how much you’re up by. I want everyone feeling Trump will somehow win this thing until Biden actually beats him. Complacency begets defeat.
Bruh it’s been time to get Trumps orange ass and Biden’s Alzheimer’s ass the fuck out of here. Most importantly, PLEASE get the federal government the fuck out our everyday lives, they’ve been doing WAY too much for WAY too long
The racism was directed at all races including blacks.  Biden, by limiting the choice to a black woman participated in the less obvious form of racism that assumes that a black woman can’t make the cut on her own merit.  Joe believes this like most liberals but I do not...
Anyone who actually believes that Biden will only lose Texas by one percent is sipping too much happy juice.
Call hunter Biden.  The pass through from China to his old man.  That’s corruption
Not really.  Didn’t hear any.   V shape recovery.  15% gdp.  Market 28,000.  5.6 million new jobs in 3 months all while you mf trying to shut it down.  Oh drug companies paying dems off while trump battles them.  Surrender to China with Biden Harris.  No thanks
Before I turn in, I have 3 words for EVERYONE (not singling out anyone) who is hemming and hawing and complaining about the Biden/Harris ticket this cycle.  RUTH. BADER. GINSBURG.  The next president will pick her replacement.  Get out your feelings. Vote Blue Down the Ticket.
Kamala did not even make it to the Iowa caucus.  Kamala got so little support &amp; enthusiasm from Democrat voters during the primaries that she chose to drop out of the race in December, more than a month before the Iowa caucuses &amp; New Hampshire primary.
The "Who is Kamala Harris" series, Episode 4:
If I where Joe Biden, I’d take this as a threat. Clearly she can’t tell the future. She said the coronavirus would vanish into thin air. She supports Trump no matter the consequence. Can’t trust any of them after this!
They liked Biden better.
who would win in a fight NBA Youngboy and Donald Trump vs 6ix9ine and Biden?
picking biden or trump is like choosing between freezing to death or burning to death both are going to fucking blow
The death toll is largely the responsibility of idiots not following recommendations &amp; I guarantee you this wouldn't have been handled any better by Biden, maybe worse by Obama. One thing's for sure, they're better at looking good when they lie than Trump, but thats their life.
Pence preaching to the trump deathcult.  Moderate republicans and independents will still vote for biden/harris. Trump is guilty of negligent genocide
That's a big crowd for Biden.
If the Democratic Party had picked Bernie and Warren I would’ve reluctantly made It work. But Biden? Joseph? Y’all did that to y’all selves.
Kamala you are bouncing around like a narcissist. You are hell bent to rewrite the USA for your personal gain. Citizens do not like it, but  you push harder at all cost. We know you were hand picked by the Democrats in a planned plot to gain the presidency cus of Biden’s dementia
Biden works out!
Biden just lost  my vote.  Just what we need is more dishonesty in politics.  What happened to :  you believe that Biden is a sexual predator????
According to you &amp; Biden, Fauci was wrong on everything. Per Fauci’s own words, the President consistently implemented measures recommended by him. So if you’re not happy with the President’s performance on Covid, you can blame “never wrong” Fauci.
She is a TRUE NARCISSIST. She says what she thinks people want to hear. In 2 days she has been caught in lies. She is carrying herself like she is running for President. Democrats hand picked her to take the Presidency from Biden. Biden is not mentally stable
Atp it’s either you vote for Biden and Kamala or we getting Trump for another 4 years. Pick ya poison
Journslist are more interested in their own 15 mins of fame than objective reporting. And all politicans should have term limits. Biden has been in office 47yrs and now he’s the answer to all the problems? No he isn’t! Politicans get to much power when their in office for years.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣Joe Biden 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣far left 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
She is a liberal. Last year she said kids 18-21 are just plain stupid. Today she wants 15 y/o to vote. Democrats hand picked her behind the door cus she will be President. Biden will be made to step down cus he has Dementia. Biden thinks he is ok and capable. Do not fool yourself
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his newly chosen running mate Kamala Harris campaigned together for the first time.
The Senate Is America’s Most Structurally Racist Institution  via
You know what, you're right.  Biden would never make a rookie mistake like plagiarize the life story of a Parliament member.  He would never do something stupid like calling a major black candidate "clean and articulate", swearing on a hot mike, or flub his own website address.

'Open and shut': Kamala Harris argues case is clear against Trump in introduction as Biden's running mate
Lol, you people are too funny. You can talk yourselves into anything. Biden can barely get 1k on a national Facebook livestream, &amp; that is considering the media advertising these things in advance. It is going to be ugly on November 3rd. Well for some anyway. Others, not so much.
I live in a deep red state (LA) so thankfully I have the privilege of voting for whoever without impacting the election. But I don’t shame people that choose Biden. We all have different considerations to make, and nobody can decide what’s better for you. Only you can do that.
I have to respectfully disagree with the commenter. I'm an "R" &amp; I'm going to #VoteGold2020. After today's Veep announcement by Biden I'm guessing your support will skyrocket. One can only hope.
Mass Incarcerated #1994CrimeBill into Joe Biden and Bill Clinton's privatized political prison
Ah, yes, the two options  Biden and Trump  much like the two genders
Trump read from a prepared statement, as has every politician since the dawn of man.  Biden read a script for a phone call between him and one other person.  I know you know the difference.  You can stop gaslighting us now.
My son (who is NOT overly political) told me that he would wait in line for 8 hours AND push the “Biden” button with his tongue if he has to.
What did Obama say when Joe Biden told him he needed to talk to him?  I’m all ears...
Ukraine Prosecutors Intercepted $6 Million U.S. Dollars Intended to Bribe Officials to Stop Investigating Burisma
Don't forget: In 2009, Biden funneled $535 million of taxpayer money into Solyndra—a scam green energy company that failed.  His radical, job-killing energy plan created by Ocasio-Cortez will be Solyndra on steroids.

CONGRATS TO JAYCE ON HIS NEW GIG WITH JOE BIDEN   We'll miss you, you rascal.
Me too. As we will all do  The old, well, is old. So is Biden and not just in age. His ideas, and Harris’, are old. It sounded like a speech from the 80s
Wow, does anybody really believe that the economy was good under Obama/Biden? The other thing is that Kamala is blaming Trump for covid and the resulting bad economy that it has caused...Crazy me, here I thought China unleashed this on the world! Biden/Harris, campaign of lies..!
Why do I get the feeling I just watched a preschool graduation? Kamala and Biden 😴😪
Either you're uninformed about what Trump said about Charlottesville or you lied about Joe Biden lying about Trump.  Shame on you!
And thankfully the poorly thought out attacks on Biden mean if he sounds normal it seems like he sounds brilliant.
The problem: in attempt to dunk on Trump,  accidentally disproved Biden's entire thesis.

Y’all wasn’t saying shit bout Biden when he was fw Obama
y’all can say all the bad things about Trump but i still haven’t heard anything good about Biden. 😩
And the Democratic Party embraces Joe Biden for his comments......the point?
tbh i feel better with Trump re elected over Biden. at least Trump dfw RATS.
Biden just doomed his chance by selecting Harris

Keep it a stack, Joe Biden played a nice move getting Kamala to be his VP.
fuck Joe Biden and k harris. im rocking woth Kanye on this one.

Isn’t Joe Biden “pro slavery” ? Or am I wrong ?
But less than 24hrs ago he posted a negative campaign ad claiming Biden has a racism problem
🖕🏾🖕🏾Both Trump &amp; Biden. Baton Rouge how we feeling about Mayor Sharon Broome ? Tara Wicker looks pretty good to me ? Why didn’t anybody run for Attorney General against Hilar Moore. This what we need to be talking about.
The major bonus that I see is at least the influence from the party will be towards a more positive outlook in the legal system rather than how the judges have looked under trump’s presidency. Human rights issues are at risk and Biden is the only option to kinda hold onto them
Opinion | Kamala Harris was the safest, most experienced and most tested choice Biden could make
Agree but not betting Trump. will be closer than folks think in fact already tightening up a bit from highs seen last month. If you want to bet Biden wait it out a bit post Republican convention then buy till you can't buy no more
Y’all I’m too upset I have to vote for Biden in November 😭
Joe Biden has selected hard-left liberal U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris to be his running mate in the November election. Harris is known to oppose nearly every policy LFF supports, and her radical record proves it.
She's arrogant and silly.  She will be the demise of Joe Biden.
I don’t think this is about Biden and the 25th amendment but like.... isn’t it, though?
I guess trump is voting for a better candidate.....
Yeah, that all seems right. Just meant as a general point about the point estimates to scare out the overconfidence. True that the steadiness so far makes Biden's est more precise, though the time left in the campaign makes that more imprecise than the Nov 1 estimate for Clinton.
Whewwww I’m so happy i ain’t gotta talk about Kamala/Biden today. Don’t wanna say the wrong thing on tv and get cancelled 😪

This is gaslighting, folks. Look at any Biden speech since he secured the nomination and compare to any Trump speaking engagement. Trump is the incoherent one - and they know that. It’s all about manipulating you to believe Biden is somehow worse. Propaganda plain and simple.
In 538's models, Biden's likely advantage over Trump at this point is *identical* to Clinton's just before the election. Mind Fivey Fox's warning. This'll be a close election, as we've been saying all along. Trump is still in a position where he could plausibly win the EC vote.
Kamala Harris, huh? I guess that helps Joe Biden win California... 🤷‍♂️
You tried to help white supremacist Hillary Clinton steal the 2016 election. You have no journalistic integrity.   Joe Biden wrote the Clinton approved #1994CrimeBill:  Bill Clinton's crime bill destroyed lives, and there's no point denying it

*stares at you in Biden*
Joe Biden better dhs when he get in office 💪🏾
😂😂😂😂😂 Par for the course.  Biden/Harris the best we can do as DEMS?!?!  Oh lawd fissin to be 4 more for Trump. Thanks dems
We gotta choose between blatant overt racism with Trump or mildly veiled racism with Biden.
We laid down for our President and kept our mouths shut. We will not shut up this time. We won’t be ruled by the Democrats again. TRUMP/PENCE 2020. Pence will tear her up in a debate. Biden won’t debate Trump. If he does he will get tore up too.
I want to know what Biden/Harris will do to stop these murders. No more disingenuous vote shaming.
Pro-Lifers: Biden-Harris ‘Most Pro-Abortion Presidential Ticket in History’
She isn’t African American.  She is Indian/Jamaican!  Shows you that Biden/Democrats really don’t think an African American could do the job.  Blacks need to wake up and see how the Democrats are using you.
mane joe biden didn’t even know where he was at a press conference a couple weeks ago 🤣.
Trump voters aren’t a monolith, and a lot of them will probably be #NeverKamala, not pro-Trump.   The GOP has to hold their nose and vote for Trump because they want the R to win but they are corporate and Trump isn’t a puppet. The Romneys of the world might vote Biden.
Definitely gotta put Joe Biden in office ✊🏿
Biden is nowhere near as rich as trump, so if biden wins we will never get another round of stimulus checks.
Love this especially cause Biden was pro segregation LMAO
I wonder where the newfound Kamala Harris “supporters” were when she was in the primaries? It’s all Black Girl Magic/HBCU love/Divine 9 pride since she’s tapped to be Biden’s political caretaker, but where was y’all energy when she was running for Biden’s nomination? 🤔
Wow. I'm not sure I can identify the religion of most nominees. What's awhile? That would mean that Obama-Biden had no Catholics either. I'm a lifelong Catholic. What I want to see come through is the person's character, no matter what demographic they are a part of. Shameful.
I am voting for the Biden Harris ticket!
Well, Ryan... You won't get a better world if Donald Trump gets re-elected. If you fight to sink Biden/Harris, you're going to cause Trump to get re-elected. Then he's going to hurt this country much more than in his first term. Don't be part of the problem.
Between August 4 &amp;11, I’ve received 21 messages from Trump’s campaign team. None of those texts had mentioned Biden but the last 2. And those two messages came right after Biden picked Harris as his VP, &amp;some are asking “what’s powerful about it?” Trump’s camp knows. #BidenHarris
Cenk's comment have been getting better after Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris rather than Elizabeth Warren. It's amusing.
why are some sean astin fans so pressed that he supports biden/harris??
That is not nearly the whole point. The DNC heard the voices of change and told them to stfu; and if you don’t like it, vote for someone else.  News flash: people are going to vote for someone else, or not vote.  A voice for Biden is a voice for corporations.
How it happened: Inside Biden's search for a running mate.
President Donald Trump says he’s “a little surprised” that his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, has selected Kamala Harris as his running mate.
If biden wins, pompeo and barr will be sweating like 2 corrupt honey baked hams
I thought he did that by being Joe Biden..
Oh, I vote. I probably will even vote for Biden now that trans healthcare is being held hostage
Biden chose Kamala so he could get the black vote but that lady then did so much wrong to her own people like why would I vote for her? Fuck bruh this gonna be a tough one. They making trump look good.
Biden heard it. Unfortunately, those memories exceed his 45 second retention limit.
Kamala Harris joins the ranks of great presidents /Vice Presidents chosen to serve the USA. All were or are the lineages of immigrants. The choice of Kamala Harris as Joe Biden’s running mate will undoubtedly bring America closer to “we hold these truths to be self evident . . .”
So I finish this political twitter rant with this: 1. Don’t let anyone shame you for not wanting to vote for Biden/Harris 2. Don’t vote just to get a person out of office. Actually think about why you’re voting for someone 3. A third party vote =/= a vote for Trump
And another thing Harris is literally the worst vp Biden could’ve chose. She’s literally a cop who did horrible things to poc and poor people in California. Like make it make sense. She is the literal embodiment of Black representation is not always Black representation
I really find it funny how people who plan on voting for Biden/Harris can never tell you why they’re voting for them other than to get trump out. Like give me actual reasons. And don’t tell it’s because Biden was Obama’s vp bc we don’t like him either.
Then u brought up Biden lmao
What does Biden and Kamala Harris have anything to do with this conversation?
Now THAT is frightening!!!
I laughed SO hard when I started to read this headline:  “ Biden taps Kamala Harris”!!!!!! 😂  I have no doubt that THIS could possibly be true!!!
We're all entitled to our opinions, but Biden dominated the black vote before the dropouts. You can argue that it's more regional (southern/sunbelt voters preferred him), but in a crowded field, black voters wanted Biden.
She  is not black? Her mom is Jamaican and dad Indian from India? Democrats are pushing her in as Black to win the Black votes. Biden  does have dementia. She will be President if Democrats gets office. There should be an intense protocol  for who wants to qualify
If Biden was among the least popular, he wouldn't have handily won the Democratic nomination. In fact, he won more than 5x as many contests as the second place finisher.
She is not BLACK. Her mom is. Jamaican and her dad is Indian from India. Dems are pushing her through as BLACK, counting on BLACK votes to push Biden in and Karama will move from VP to President cus Biden has Dementia.
Dems are pushing her through as BLACK. She is not BLACK. Her mom is Jamaican and dad Indian from India. The lies have started on the first day cus she has not corrected and announced her real nationality. Dems are counting on black votes to Win Biden as Pres
I like how Biden just tried to intimate he's always stood against the big banks.  Wonder if any of the media will ask Senator MBNA about that next time they chat...
I want Karama to tell she is NOT BLACK?? She is riding in on a lie. BIDEN did not pick her. The Demonsts hand picked her and they do not want BLM or ANTIFA  to know she is Jamaican and Indian not black.
Possibly becoming the unelected President of the US came with “irrefutable evidence” that all of those women were making it up? I’ve seen video evidence of him GROPING them so you never know! 😝
Katana has already started lying like every politician does. She IS NOT BLACK. Her mother is Jamaican and her father Indian from INDIA.  Why is she not correcting the MEDIA. Biden and Karama are MISLEADING The BLACK POPULATION. Why is she not telling people?
Yes, that's exactly what is happening. When the black liberal community tells Biden that to get their votes he has to pick a black female running mate, that's what she's being chosen for- her color and her sex. Any other qualities she might have are secondary. THAT'S hateful.
i’ve heard so much worse about biden then i have about trump. but i honestly don’t really have an opinion on either. just all hearsay for me.
i haven’t really followed politics much. but what has showed up in my feeds and stuff has painted both biden and trump in a bad light. they both seem terrible. but honestly. i have no idea. no idea at all. i’m trying to not pay attention to it for as long as possible until i must
Other than the fact that Biden is a confirmed Catholic, this is another reason I find my faith in the Catholic Church waning. God does not play favorites, and bishops of all people should know that.
Are we taking bets as to when Biden steps down due to "health concerns" if elected?
Thinking about how Amy Klobuchar was pretty much certain to become Biden's VP, but the murder of George Floyd happened, and it turned out she was an accessory on the murder. Then the establishment dems started insisting Biden's VP had to be a woc just to block Elizabeth Warren.
Biden needed someone to help him lock up more black men.
Kudos on that, hope you vote Biden\Harris, so your Godchild has a chance....
Tennessee is #12 In new COVID-19 cases. What does Tennessee have to lose? Could Biden\Harris possibly do worse than trump\pence\blackburn? I don't think so.......

“ Bennett also questioned whether the Biden campaign will use the choice of Harris to "reach out" to police and law enforcement groups that may be tempted to endorse President Trump.” HARRIS??  After how the Democrats have ATTACKED them? 😂
Seeing as I’m 1 for 1 on the Biden administration’s executive officers, I’d like to see: Joyce Vance, Sally Yates, or Doug Jones for AG Susan Rice for State Anthony Fauci for HHS Elizabeth Warren for Treasury
So he picks the woman who SLEPT her way into her CAREER as his VP huh? 😂  Maybe Old Joe figures SHE won’t “bitch” about his “sniffing” habits?
Well if you want to say that neither Democrats nor Republicans at the White House Level have done much to vastly improve Black communities. What do you say about Biden being responsible for putting many Black people in FEDERAL prison? Again I just don’t Like Mrs. Harris’ politics
Agreed.  Why else would biden announce picking a black woman in advance if this wasn't the plan?  So predictable!
I believe that Biden is just a pawn that is used only to get into the White House. Kamala is the real candidate. Biden will be declared incompetent and removed from office. Then, in goes Harris. A democrat in the White House.
Y’all boy Biden has f*cked up more Black lives than almost any other politician Republican or Democrat but y’all want me to vote for him and Mrs. Harris. I f*ck around and not vote AGAIN 🥴
Left wing or right wing same bird it Joe Biden is just as fucked up as trump
Your not hurting my feelings. I don’t support either Trump or Biden. I don’t support anyone as President, House, Senate, or SCJ that’s over the age of 60.  Try something else.
God I hope so. America deserves better than crusty old Trump or Biden.
What to do? Joe Biden not the moderate he used to be. Revolutionary Communist Party, USA endorsing him. And Angela "We can pressure him" Davis. Plus Bernie Sanders, Beto O'Rourke and AOC claiming he's theirs. Now Kamala Harris: our next president when he resigns?
And Dr. Biden, as well!
News Flash,  crime is up, under trump. Law &amp; Order, Biden\Harris!
If they let us, we can do a lot. Biden has been using virtual phone banks, ActBlue has a texting network.  I can write in a persuasive manner. We all have skills that can be useful.
not biden AND kamala.......y’all rlly don’t want me to vote like at all at this point
Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate on Tuesday.

If y’all not gone vote for Biden, then who y’all voting for? I’m just trying to gauge how y’all gone split the vote
If that’s “HUGE”, just wait until you hear how Trump reads his scripts. 🙄😆 I’ll bet Joe Biden can pronounce “Yosemite” from his script.
Joe Manchin and Krysten Sinema are moderates. Murk and Collins are moderates. Heck, compared to Harris, Romney is a moderate.  I'm not annoyed that the Dems have a notably progressive VP, especially since Biden prefers to moderate. But be intellectually honest about her policies
How many times will joe Biden use Covid as an excuse to opt out of a debate.

If progressives want to win. Stop counting out the base of the party. Did I say 55% of Blacks live in the south?   I did. Remember it.   Biden won the nomination because he swept the south. Learn from the mistakes so we don’t repeat them.   I see a #NewBlackSouth #KeepPushing
I love Bernie. Voted for him in 2016 and 2020. You know who came to my state multiple times? Kamala Harris. Joe Biden.   I think Bernie came once.   You know who has come to Louisiana repeatedly? Trump.   He goes after the south. Democrats just give it to Republicans.
You called  a racist and a segregationist then you said you believed his accuser that Biden sexually assaulted her. How can you accept the VP nomination of such a vile, disgusting man?
He did his job today for the black community electing a black woman as VP (tokenism) even though that black women spent her entire career locking up black folks in California. I don’t even have to mention Biden &amp; his 94 crime bill. We still feeling those affects today.
Because we didn’t hold any of these candidates to have a black agenda they’re not obligated to do anything for black people. Now i ask you big brother. What reason does Biden have to fight for black folks when he already knew the majority is voting for him.
If Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are embracing the “Radical Left” that would actually be great!
Please let us know one good thing by Biden or Kamala Harris has done for the black community I think he was harsh on prison reform I cannot think of one positive thing of biting has ever done while he's been in elective office ...name one.. quit being a sheep
Like it or not, Joe Biden has spent decades building relationships. It’s paid off for him.   There is value is learning even from those we disagree with.   I don’t think Joe Biden nor Kamala Harris are perfect.   I know Donald Trump is hot garbage though.
Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate, first Black woman
To be fair, no matter which of the women Biden picked, she would be termed "unlikeable", "shrill" and other words I'm not going to repeat.
A lot of people talked about her record as a prosecutor but her job was to prosecute. It wasn't her fault that a lot of defendents were black. People got mad at Christopher Darden for prosecuting OJ but were at home saying he did it. That was their job.
Damn I was really gonna vote for Biden too but idk about that whole Biden/Harris  thing
Y’all think Kamala Harris still thinks Joe Biden is racist?
Blink twice if Biden is behind you smelling your hair, we’ll get help!
Y’all was gone complain about whoever Biden picked because it’s Biden. So just make sure you vote for him on November 3rd. Mmkay?
Sen. Kamala Harris being selected as Joe Biden’s running mate is historic.   As a Black man in America I celebrate Sen. Harris becoming the Vice Presidential nominee. She adds value to the ticket that could drastically change Biden’s campaign.
Typical Dems. Global pandemic? Here’s the guy who opposes M4A for president, oh and he told WI it was safe to vote even tho the CDC said no.   Nat’l unrest over police brutality? Biden says shoot zem in ze legs and fund the police. Oh, and a cop for VP.   #BidenHarris2020
The value she brings is a connection to a new generation of voters which TBH Biden - as a older guy needed. She also connects him to women and women of color which he also struggles with. I don't think you are really being serious in ur question but there ya go.
Liz Warren was my choice for president and then VP. While I’m saddened she won’t be on the ticket in November, my heart swells knowing this amazing woman is still out there supporting Biden/Harris while working hard for us! #BidenHarris #VPPick #BidenHarris2020
Biden won’t even come out of his basement...Trump takes a assassin attempt like he spilt his coffee!🤔🇺🇸
Hey, you guys need to cut Joe Biden some slack. He did the best he could after he discovered Ronald Reagan had rather inconveniently decided to shuffle off this mortal coil some time ago.
Biden consistency makes inconsistent actions
Biden know what he doing 😂 cause AKAs gone step 😂
Say what you will about what they've done or didn't do, at the very least they're both patriots. I cant say that I'm happy, but I also don't have the energy to be upset when so much is on the line. The stakes have changed, Biden/Harris 2020
Ok, Biden announced his VP pick. Now we can all return to our regularly scheduled loathing of the US government.
Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate
bad move biden
🗣 joe biden went got a afro american to lead us to the slaughter house.... i said what i said
Major alert!! 🚨🚨 Sen. Kamala Harris has been chosen as Biden’s VP!! #GeauxDems
Does Biden picking Harris give Trump a serious chance to turn things around and win in November? Seriously does that make swing voters run from Biden?
No one should be at all surprised at Biden’s VP pick. The entire election system is rigged from the very moment the “candidates” are rolled out.
this runs contrary to these recent pieces
I don’t trust the inside emotions of white people enough to trust in a Biden Victory at the polls. 🥴
How am I supposed to study for 2 cumulative finals tomorrow when  was just announced as Biden's VP?   Happiest day of my life since Nov. 9, 2016!!! 🥳   So much hope!!! #BidenHarris2020 👩🏾👨🏻‍🦳🇺🇸
I refuse to vote for Biden.
Biden and Harris 2020 I guess 😭🤟🏼
My ol lady just gave me point after point after point why Kamala is a good selection. Black women bout to make sure Biden win.
Lol Kampala was the worst pick possible and Biden took a nosedive straight into that poor decision
So since Biden got dementia we really about to have the first woman president who also black
Also don't tell people to shut up about this VP pick Biden is already an incredibly difficult candidate to get excited about and this does not help that, at all. We're allowed to be critical of our candidates.
BIDEN - HARRIS sounds like a center half pairing for Leeds United
Do you remember when Kamala Harris ripped Joe Biden a new one live on national TV and then later he was like, "Poo poo, pee pee poo poop pee poopy poop" because that's the shit I'm here for.
This is what my “Joe Biden Announces His Running Mate With A Rollerskating Musical” dream last week predicted (minus the rollerskating musical part).
JOE BIDEN HAS SELECTED KAMALA HARRIS AS HIS RUNNING MATE
So it’s Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, huh. *sigh*
Damn. Biden just picked one hell of a running vp.
Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate
“Bunker Biden”???? “Bunker” has already been reserved for Trump. Try to keep up Judge.
Neither for Biden so somebody better give us a new runner or i aint going😂
Me walking in to cast my vote for the Biden/Harris ticket in November.
#KamalaHarris is a Hypocrite: Condemns Biden as racist now accepts Vice Presidency.  She exposed racist #JoeBiden when the mainstream media, #donnabrazile and #rolandmartin made little mention of racist legislation he created. #1994CrimeBill #Biden4Abortion #JimCrowJoe
Swift Response from President Trump on Joe Biden’s VP choice
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.. crooked vs crooked
If you aren't voting for Biden because of Kamala, you weren't voting for Biden in the first place.
Biden taps Kamala Harris as running mate
Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate
Harris? Lmao I couldn't possibly be less excited for the democratic ticket this go around  Fuck it, a biden/harris bill might get centrists and establishment dems to vote, so it's "fine" I guess
Look, Biden is going to win the election. The Regime needs the country to go back to “hey, it’s all good” sleepwalking like Obama after Bush.
Not Biden choosing Kamala over Stacey....
Kamala Harris was the best pick for Joe Biden’s running mate. It will be interesting to see how this pans out.
She’s not black. Her family is from India. Biden lied again.
I could have agreed more. I feel like that would only make me hate Biden more if he gets elected.
Kamala Harris' record as a lawmaker is actually pretty decent, the problem is that Biden made the genius move of picking a cop as presidential candidate while people are massively protesting against cops in the USA.
i still dont trust Joe Biden. mmm shaky bium 😫
i hate to say it but....biden/harris 2020🇺🇸😒
BREAKING: Joe Biden announces Kamala Harris as running mate.
Who is Joe Biden?
Back when she was AG prosecuting low level drug offenses despite having smoked as a youth, blocking evidence that would have set a man free, and facilitating and encouraging the modern slave trade of prison labor? Oh yeah, she fits right in with Crime Bill Biden.
To whom it may concern:   Please send my Biden Harris bumper sticker ASAP. Thanks.
And there we go! Biden/Harris 2020!! Game on!
Congratulations to  !   Biden &amp; Harris 2020.
Joe Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris. I can’t wait until she debates pence. 💙 ￼

Good time for Biden to drop his VP, IF he’s not super confident in it
biden' my time 2020
Reports are Joe Biden to announce a VP candidate today. Joe's from Delaware. Not a big college football state.
Imagine how fragile your “masculinity” would have to be to be “insulted” by the bold possibility a Woman VPOTUS. 🙄  Trump says men may be "insulted" by Biden picking a woman for VP - Axios
REAL TALK:  Whoever Joe Biden’s picks for VP is the REAL presidential candidate.  Democratic Party is a joke.  #BidenVP #Trump2020
STOP IT. I'm already having trouble sleeping. Although that would presumably be a Biden win in the House.
Hey, could you all stop focusing on rent and groceries long enough to sit on pins and needles awaiting Biden to announce his VP pick? I mean, where are your priorities?
I am SO EXCITED to be so wildly disappointed when Biden finally announces his VP pick
Girl Biden picking a woman???????? WHO?!
Currently waiting for the Biden VP leak
So, there's an article saying Kamala Harris unfollowed Biden. The article itself, on a right-wing site, has an update saying she never followed Biden. Oops. And yet, the article with unchanged headline keeps being.   So much misogyny in the responses too.Fuck Joe Biden
How would Joe Biden protect the social Security benefits when he has vowed to spend $2 Trillion on Climate Change ?
Hey if you have older conservative relatives, especially if they live in a rural area, make sure they know what’s going on with the USPS. My Republican grandparents are PISSED and voting for Biden.
We are in a very vulnerable position as true Americans. The DEMs have very little time left. They will break any law. Do not concentrate on your friends that have told you that they are voting for Biden/Harris. They have no idea themselves who they would be putting in Power.
Healsup Harris is enjoying the attention of Biden sniff and touch routine.
Which is why he backed Hilary Clinton over Bernie Sanders in 2016.  Which is also why he immediately backed Joe Biden over Sanders, Castro, AND Warren this time.
The poor little bused girl, and by Joe according to her! Biden/Byrd
The mass incarceration of a target demographic is violence. Kamala Harris and Joe Biden have committed violence against our communities. We can not let them forget that.
The perfect Biden Gif.👍😂
Dr Claud Anderson on Kanye West, Kamala Harris and Joe Biden  via  This is a must watch video for my ppl✊🏾✊🏾!! We can &amp; must unite as a ppl to leave this world better than what our ancestors, parents &amp; even we ourselves are living through.
thanks for the follow. I keep working at it. Truth through humor. I think it's called observational humor if you're a liberal and you're a racist if you're a conservatives/Republican and Trump supporter. Joe Biden in his basement.😂
Who died and made Joe Biden king?
Need I continue to remind you. Biden had no say in his choice. He was told she was it and you will like it, mofo.
That was a different issue, and she didn't mislead Congress. She told Congress she was informed about Burisma and Biden's Son's involvement in a debriefing when she got the job. She didn't lie.
I would love to experience the privilege of choosing morality. Unfortunately, poor BIPOCs do not have that luxury in this country.   Not voting for Joe Biden = a vote for Trump and that is the [sad] fact.
Are you— you can not be serious.   There is a HUGE difference between Joe Biden winning and Donald Trump staying in office.
Biden/Harris is the only good choice this time. And Rob Anderson in my District.
No, the issue was a Presidential Impeachment.  It doesn't matter what Biden's son did in that context.  That would be a matter for an actual court, not Congress.
The GOP also called their own witnesses, they were only denied witnesses who they wanted to bring in for an entirely different matter.  It was about Trump's behavior not Biden's Son's behavior, so witnesses they wanted to talk about Biden's Son were denied.
Biden and Harris?
Biden announces Harris as his running mate. A little SNL humor.
Here's your original tweet after which I asked you to provide any court cases involving minors against Biden.
Just as strong as the "evidence" you have for Biden. Same shit... different side. You're a hypocrite.
Yes, I already saw the shitty compilation presented by the other guy. There is just as much "evidence" online about Trump. Please send references to the court cases involving minors against Joe Biden. Muchas gracias.
Please send references to the court cases involving minors against Joe Biden. Muchas gracias.
No Biden lies all the time and calls other people lying horse face pony soilders
Biden almost makes LBJ look like a Civil Rights Activist. Now we know who the inspiration for "Big Daddy" in "Django Unchained" was.
If you like what you see happening in America -all the hate, discord, being the No.1 country to harbor a raging pandemic with no leader to bring it under control, the environment being torn apart by rich people wanting to be richer - then don’t vote.If you want better,VOTE Biden!
Well thanks for taking time with me. I definitely am trying to change your mind about Trump  b/c he’s the only one left who believes in “We the People”. We won’t have to worry about immigration if Biden gets it cause we’ll be just like Cuba &amp; China &amp; Mexico, etc 😢  Thx again! ❤️

You know if Biden gets elected he won't be President long because his health and mental state is rapidly declining. So, Kamala might be our future President, &amp; mark my words, Black's will get reparations ( free monthly check) for something that was settled over 150 plus years ago
There is nothing baseless about this astute observation. She only stated what most of us already know. Epstein didn't kill himself either.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris running for president and VP is the comic relief we needed for 2020 🤣😂 #Trump2020
When the word “alleged” was used for R. Kelly y’all didn’t care and cancelled him without a second thought. But now that it’s Joe Biden it’s “oh we don’t know if he did that for a fact” save them double standards for someone else.
Biden/Harris doesn’t even seem fair.
I love this ticket, Biden and Harris yes yes
You are going to make us a socialist which becomes communist Country.  Tell the people the truth.  You &amp; Biden are lying through your teeth to the people.  God Bless President Trump &amp; God Bless America!! Trump 2020
I’m not believing what Biden and Harris are saying about the Trump administration.. I feel I’m in the Twilight Zone
What did they give Biden to make him be able to speak clearly and follow the prompt.  This is the first time I heard him be able to make a sentence.  The speech was a bunch of BS. He did not tell the people he was going to take away their choices, Freedom.
Sang in auto tune: iiiiiii don’t like joe biden
Joe Biden a pervert and Kamala Harris goes home a kisses a white man goodnight after a long day putting black people in jail for marijuana. I’ll pass on them too🏌🏾‍♂️
Isn't Harris the one who stated she believes Biden's accuser's and now she has defend him and doing a "Hillary" and enabling him. She has once again prostituted herself for the chance at power.
I’m one of those suburban wives, and I assure you I will be voting for Biden-Harris!
BREAKING: Wikileaks Posts 137 Documents on Kamala Harris Hours After She Is Named Joe Biden's Running Mate  via
Joe Biden didn't praise them Ms. McNinney, he expressed his dislike for them calling him son(white mans version of being called boy) he praised his skill for negotiating(superior to Witchey Poo 💩) &amp; ability to reach across the aisle to get things done for the ppl not party.

I don't either...
Mr. Tieso, the only way that Hillary would be in the picture is that if Biden would win in November. Yes, a few people have been struck by lightning twice &amp; Obama won twice, but the odds of Biden winning, well...just don't worry. Who is your Representative in Electoral College.
Biden should concern the Democratic Party. I think that Harris is a mute point. But that's me...
She supported gay marriage before Obama, Hillary or Biden.
New video by Breakfast Club Power 105.1 FM: How Important Is It For Joe Biden To Pick A Black Woman As His VP?
You mean to tell me there’s people that take Joe Biden seriously?
God forbid that Joe Biden is our next President. It will be the end of America the sequel. We lost the Panama Canal in 1977.
Biden screwed his African American supporters. He didn't pick an African American. Da Dah!
Remember when Kanye said he could beat Biden in write ins alone😩now look at us
Could the democratic party have picked two worse candidates than joe biden and kamala harris? sheeeeesh
As the late Mexican comedian Chespirito would say "She was just joking about what she said about Joe Biden."
So are we voting for Crusty Trump or Pedo Biden this year? Or Crazy Kanye ?!? #wearefucked
I know I was reaching but I wish Biden would have named Obama his vice
Does Biden know yet?😳😳🤔🤔🤔
Since she's willing to stand up to Biden, wouldn't that make her better than Mike Pence?  So, is this your way of endorsing her?
No, I wouldn't say that's true.  She is someone who ran to be President herself, and was willing to debate against him on stage.  She was higher on my hopeful President list than Biden himself was.  She's a solid choice.
Wow, so Biden is willing to pick someone who will Challenge him. Someone who isn't afraid to go toe to toe with him on important issues.  That's amazingly brave and wise of him.  You won me over, Biden/Harris 2020!
Great VP choice. Best VP choice since Biden.
Joe biden picked kamala Harris for vp. My kid could pick a booger better than that. GOOD LUCK FOLKS. #trump2020  #BidenHarris2020
I keep telling you, Biden hasn't picked anyone. She was picked for him.
I wonder if she still thinks he’s a racist? 🤔 And I wonder if Biden thought he was picking, Kamala Harris the wrestler?
Biden has picked anyone including his nose. His neferious Socialist/Communist agenda driven Democrat Handler's picked her.
Biden didn’t pick anybody. His handlers did.
Lol now y’all fake mad bout Biden picking Kamala Harris, of course it wasn’t gone be Michelle 🤦🏾‍♂️
She’s a JOKE!! No Biden vote for me!!!
Biden names Kamala Harris as running mate. Great Choice!
Biden/Harris ticket?!

Obviously meant WWI and all you “history experts” need to fact check your shit! WWI and the Spanish flu epidemic are most definitely linked! Joe Biden doesn’t even know where he is half the time!
Well he had my vote in 2016 and in 2020 ,he will only lose if Democrats are allowed to cheat by mail vote and tell Joe Biden absentee voting not the same as the fraud they want to perpetuate
What an exciting line up Biden has selected. He had to scrape the bottom of the barrel for these past losers. They are all “Has Beens.”  COME ON MAN!!!!!👎👎👎👎
Nothing like playing Racial Politics and resorting to political extortion.
The way Biden is dragging this out, his VP better be Beyoncé. Good God man just announce already.
If Biden wins ya'll deserve him.
Trying to buy that spot, are we? Isn't that unethical? Oh, I fogot it's Democrat's doing it, so it be good to go.
I’m really looking forward to who the replacements will be!  I can pretty much assure it won’t be Biden’s family or friends.
Wow, are you saying he wants a functional government that takes care of people's needs now and the future through ensuring people have a good education and having an Earth to live on?  I was on the fence before, but you convinced me.  Biden 2020 all the way!
If you take both political sides and see who's saying what, i don't think either of the two has a lead on a public perception of Mental Health.  One side thinks Trump is unfit, the other side things Biden is unfit.
It brings in to question why he needed such a test, and the way he described it opened up the door to a lot of mockery.   As much of any of Joe Biden's gaffes.
Perhaps, but I'm going to vote for the person most likely to surround himself with good people who are able and willing to run the Executive Branch.  To me, between the two, that's Biden.
If you were to compare just the two, they are both old white guys who have public image issues in regards to their mental health.  Biden has a stutter, and makes "gaffs", while Trump seems to not even have a basic understanding of most subjects, and cognitive issues.
To bad all their votes will be for Biden, even though they don’t know it.
He's not an option no matter if you believe in God or not. He is pure unadulterated Socialist/Communist Evil and they will destroy America should they gain total control. Nov is truly a war/fight for the heart and soul of the country
Everyone knows Biden sold America out
Joe Biden was born a natural born idiot and had a relapse.  🙇‍♀️What a shame that he really hates our black friends.  GO TRUMP!!!!! We will win!!!!!!
Funny week. First Trump supports Obamacare, then he supports Biden's past tax cut proposals. Are we sure Trump didn't switch to the Democratic party?
I feel sorry for the person that Biden chooses for a running mate.  That would be 4 long years of torture.
Here's a Conspiracy Theory they haven't floated yet, that neferious forces might "Scalia" Biden and he dies mysteriously in his sleep. Think about it?
The real sad thing is that the Real Joke is the Old White Man. He meant what he said, like he's in charge.
I think Biden was referring to Crackhead Hunter, when he made that comment about being a Junkie.
I’ll gladly take your $400 a week  Donald and still vote for Biden in November thank you
I’m not crazy about the girl but she has said repeatedly on The View and on twitter that she is voting for Biden.
She has said she will vote Biden on The View many times. Get your facts straight!
Joe Biden is the ring leader for being the biggest liar among the Democrats. He also has a lot of “relatives” too!!!!!!!
Spoken by a Russian asset. You are taking fake propaganda from Russia and weaponizing it in Congress to attack Biden. You are a traitor to American democracy.
He stepped on it again. Hell, he doesn't even know who they want to be President should they pull it off.
Kanye West's unlikely White House bid is getting help qualifying for presidential ballots in key states from Republicans around the country.
That's what they get paid to and if they were Fair and Unbaised they would show the uniformed masses what and who he really is and that they need to Wake Up.
It is my understanding that Biden is going to pick a female of color for his VP. I don’t care about race or sex. I want to know qualifications. Businesses are not allowed to discriminate by race or sex. Why are those DNC requirements?
President Trump believe what is right for our future, freedom by not taking advantage from China, Iran, Russia! That’s why Iran, China’s Coronavirus, Syria hadn’t dropped any nerves bomb! Pres Obama, Biden failed save lives at Syria twice! Syria President escapes  to Russia!
See what President Trump been fighting against China, Iran! Several times President Trump went back fought  China’s Tariffs and won! China couldn’t handle it still refused admit being responsible for Coronavirus, look what happened now! Countries died Biden will say we’re wrong!
This just end, Biden gets every vote under the age of 25 cause they all realize that running a government based on the views of the world's most popular imaginary friend is fuckin stupid. Separate church and state #Biden2020
Kidding me look at Joe Biden did at Ukraine’s for his son Hunter and made him richer plus Biden’s! Pres Obama knew Biden’s also Clinton’s doing! Look at FBI covered up by Comey, Strzok, McCabe! FBI bleached record for President Obama, Biden, Clinton, Rice spy Trump’s on 1/4/17!
Coronavirus is blame from China! Remember other countries is suffering! China is denied the responsible for Coronavirus! China, Iran is threat USA! President Trump is fight for our future plus it’s belong to USA! Biden gives China, we lose our future!
It is on MSNBC. Rachel Maddow did a lengthy segment on it. She even pointed directly at Grassley and Johnson as recipients of Russian lies to malign Biden.  They're in effect, Russian assets working on behalf of Trump.
That's what they get paid to do. There no such thing as Fair and Balanced in their narrative. That's what State Run Gobbelesque Media does.
Would someone please buy Joe Biden’s wife a new dress.  She is no Melanie Trump!‼️‼️
That sounds suspicious don't it?
We don't need Good Ole Ben to tell us this. We already know it would happen.
Why do you keep bringing up Biden? I have never once said Biden would make a good president.
Good morning, America! How are the Democrat's and Biden and the others promising to destroy America today?
just out of curiosity, does Chris Wallace get paid extra to defend Biden? His comments this morning showed his bias against Trump. He was asked about Biden’s comments yet his answer was basically...”yeah but Trump...” (paraphrasing) 🙄
Biden faces backlash over racial diversity remark  Okay so one politician made a comment that makes you say "What?"|
Joe Biden know he is joke and he doing for his son to become President! Hunter Biden is crook like Democratic Congress look left side! Cheater! Joe Biden can’t beat President Trump at Debates! Joe prove it willing Debates President or chicken 💩!
Aren’t you kidding me! I’m voting for President Donald Trump! Why all Staion’s News, begging Joe Biden vs President Trump Debates because Little Joe Biden can’t handle it because Joe is a disgraceful dishonest Vp Democratic ! except Fox News! Demo Congress knew Biden broke LAWS!
Biden should say NO. Let Trump beg...
Biden is a Marxist just like everyone on your Racist network
You just said "Acts of immorality, or personal failings, don't disqualify a person." So Joe Biden's moral faults don't matter at all.
It's called the "Ross Perot Tactic". Go for it Bro. The Dem's play dirty. You play Dirtier. I called it. 👍👍Give it back at em.
So, according to your reasoning, the practicing Catholic Joe Biden would also be an instrument of God were he elected.
Biden was against Roe vs Wade when it first passed, primarily because of his Catholic upbringing. He changed his public opinion for political reasons. Trump was pro-Choice in 2000 before he decided to run for office; he changed his public opinion for political reasons.
"Walter" is saying what his "Jeff Dunham" is telling him to say. Because we/you know they don't even like each. No "Romancing the Stone" here.
please tell Juan that Biden is not a true catholic if he is pro abortion period
True. Not since Bush Sr. unless you count the National Guard. But Trump's "bone spur" deferrals were B.S. Biden's were for asthma, which wasn't much better. Just goes to show, it's a big club, and you &amp; I aren't in it.
let’s be clear  that’s not what Biden wants. that’s what the majority of my generation wants. it’ll come eventually, and i’m so glad you’ll still be alive to see it :)
