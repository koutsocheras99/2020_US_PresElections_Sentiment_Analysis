Joe Biden’s VP pick
IKR .. Takes a lot of emotional intelligence to come up with that kind of response.  Such a great communicator, he could write for Biden.
#Election2020 Is Trump saying that Biden wants to put God on the disabled list?
Tough piece. To be sure, we libs know that y'all be attacking Biden on Day One. It is just a political alliance of convenience now. Even the #MSNBC GOP pundit class will return to attacking tan suits-- or sunglasses very soon.
Amen, Phil. And just as importantly, Biden will restore honesty to the White House. And hopefully sychophants like Higgins and his lying GOP colleagues will all be voted out of office.
They were not drugs they retested the substance and it wasn’t drugs but they are still trying to say she resisted arrest. Crooked Sheriffs Department! They need a FBI patterns and practices investigation after Biden wins this November!
He ordered federal agents to beat up and pepper spray priests and peaceful protestors so he could have a campaign photo op holding a Bible upside down outside a church that didn't want him there.  Now he thinks he has the "God" vote? Pathetic.
that’s just not reality. I’m sorry, but you gotta look beyond your media and social bubble and view exterior evidence. Look into Biden’s actual policy and judge it for yourself. Look into how actual socialists hate him for his middling approach. He’s not who you portray him as.
Biden is a very, very moderate Democrat. As a progressive, I can promise you he’s not a socialist at all, and it’s unfair to disregard his policy and generalize him with truly brutal dictators who hid under the name of communism
We need Biden signs.  I can probably give out at least 30 in my little precinct in Eagan.
When I hear the cable pundits, who weren't on Joe Biden's side when these primaries started, now say such glowing things about him, I just shout "I told you so!"  He IS the perfect candidate for this election and lot of us knew that. #deadlinewhitehouse
Biden has the power to hurt God?
#Election2020 The Yo Semite and Thighland guy thinks that Joe Biden is the one who can't keep it together.
Lad, are you calling Joe Biden a fat junkie?   At this rate i wouldnt be surprised if you claimed Joe is secretly Xi Jinping in a thin-suit. Y’all are weird istg
If Joe Biden can hurt God then he can probably will COVID-19 away using mind powers so he definitely has my vote.
This is exactly right. It's not Biden's job to put Trump in jail, and it's not his job to keep him out of jail.
We all know you don't have the balls to debate Biden.  But please proceed with these hissy fits.  It's hilarious. #Biden2020
Yes we are for Biden!
this is 5 months old but it is a compilation of Joe Biden's lies.
Solely to steal the Black votes from President-Elect Biden.
Portland looks like it does under trump. You can’t blame Biden for something that is happening under trump.
Joe Biden should be asking for an IMMEDIATE interview with
Only until Biden’s inauguration. I fear what Trump will try to do to punish Americans after the election and before he gets dragged out of the White House
As long as the the votes go to Joe Biden and gets this evil doer out of office! I’m all for it! He’s the biggest cheater and liar ever seen in the White House! Stupid to! Brags that he passed a Dementia test! Good boy! If we don’t test there wouldn’t be cases! Stupid Stupid!!

Andrew Yang Has A Debate Warning For Trump ― And A Bold Prediction For Biden #SmartNews
True enough. There's a lot of conspiracy theories in regards to their deaths, but a vast majority also believe it was a retaliation hit for laden after Biden leaked the Intel. The unit was also expecting retaliation after Biden leaked it, atleast from what I've read about it.
It’s going to be so much fun to see him gagged and cuffed hauled out of the White House after President Biden is sworn in.
We will drag u out by your feet! Well have the marshalls treat u like u have treated American protesters and remove your ass out of the White House! Your trying to undermined the right to vote in every way possible! Cuz your polls! Are down 15 points under Biden! You have failed
America was already divided before trump came into office, you can thank Obama for that. Secondly, between the two candidates trump is the only one who has an ounce of patriotism or have you forgotten that Biden signed the death warrants of the entire unit of SEAL team 6.
All thanks to Biden who publicly named the members of SEAL team 6 and signed their death warrants.
Traveling in northern WI this weekend, I finally saw a tiny, tiny ray of hope in one Biden yard sign amidst a sea of Trump signs. I hope there are some small town WI Biden supporters biding their time to #VoteBlue2020 🤞🤞🤞
Try to avoid the USPS, find election drop boxes in each &amp; ALL states. OR- VOTE super early.    Excited to talk with Biden’s field  leader tomorrow. I’ll see what I can do on a grassroots level with  - to MAKE EVERY VOTE COUNT! No suppression this time! All votes count!!
He has dimentia, And my father has Alzheimers. And the Democrats sadly are using him like a puppet to gain power. I feel sorry for Biden. I'm angry with Democrats for letting it go on this long over one man.
Trump seems to have stopped advertising in Minnesota so I'm guessing Biden is ahead by a lot more.
We need YOU Joe Biden!!!!
It’s alright man, no need to apologize. I didn’t know about your history and I don’t want to make you uncomfortable. I just wished to facilitate a civil discussion about Biden. You vote yourself conscious, but also remember to look at multiple sources and double check yourself.
I cannot pick just one... 1) President Barack Obama 2) First Lady Michelle Obama 3) Joe Biden 4) Ruth Bader Ginsberg  5)  John Lewis (I wish I had known him when he was alive.
but Biden won the popular democratic vote, and he will bring us closer to these goals by strongly strengthening Obamacare and fighting to get our country carbon neutral by 2030. I would prefer Bernie, but I realize Biden is still a strong step in the right direction.
To me it seems like you have a very black and white view of this. Biden is bad, and that’s not negotiable to you. This lack of listening to other viewpoints and name calling isn’t helping anyone. I want to fight climate change, I want Medicare for all, I want a progressive future
Please do tell me why I should vote for Biden. You can't mention Trump, Republicans, or anything else related. Only describe his platform, and how it would benefit America. Go ahead.
That’s anecdotal and only predicts the worst case scenario. At least Biden actually has a plan. Go to his website, read his recent plan, and then tell me how he’s equivalent to trump. I’d rather vote for a guy with a plan rather than a guy who doesn’t.
In a normal political environment, I would completely emphasize with your median stance; however, this is not a normal time. Attacking Biden is supporting Trump in the view of most democrats, including myself. Say what you want about Biden, but at least he will bring in experts.
You’d better believe Biden won’t be giving tax breaks to your billionaire buddies. They can pay their fair share. #bluewave #votehimout #trumptraitor
Biden was faded before he started
Reasons  should be VP  Besides being bad ass and wicked smart, she will bring joy and her fabulous laugh. She will challenge  and be a true partner. She will hold people accountable and support the Biden platform. No bad choices in VP roster #KHive
I’d like to see Biden right a giant wrong and put Merrick Garland on the SCOTUS. I favor Adam Schaffer’s for USAG, Mr. Yang at Commerce and Sen. Warren as Senate Majority Leader.
Also, she’s beautiful.
Please. Let’s get FakeJillBiden on Twitter! She and I would be besties.
They were just in Minnesota.  Fuck!
#Election2020 If Joe Biden wins I hope he makes it a priority to restore ethics in government and give violations of ethics some teeth.
Speaks.  Something Biden can’t do.
I’m not gonna bother arguing. I implore you; however, to look at the policy between Biden and Trump when it comes to race. You’ll see which one has a stronger anti-racist mindset. Look at what they say policy-wise, disregard your bias, then say who’s racist.
We need to move the general election up to the first Tuesday in September, Biden's Inauguration on Wednesday, and your arrest on Thursday.
You, sir, are a national treasure and a gift to all of us 🇺🇸
Joe Biden is not going to do what left wants he is doing what the corrupt establishment wants.
😂 congrats on the pay-out whichever Rivera/Riviera you go! $
Too bad you can’t travel right now internationally, or you could head to the French Riviera. Bad timing for your windfall 😂
I mean, to be fair, Biden’s policy is a lot more sound and detailed than trumps, no matter how you look at it. His goals are clear, and they mostly align with democratic beliefs. It ain’t too hard to getIKR .. Takes a lot of emotional intelligence to come up with that kind of response.  Such a great communicator, he could write for Biden.
SHAMEFUL THAT Sens. JOHNSON &amp; GRAHAM spreading FAKE NEWS from Russia on Joe Biden.
#Election2020 Is Trump saying that Biden wants to put God on the disabled list?
No way could Biden spell monolith or provide a definition.  Dementia Joe hasn't written a single tweet in the last year.  When he has to meet Trump on stage without a teleprompter, ear piece, or notes, it will be  GAME OVER!
Here is the fact. Biden will select the person who he thinks will help him win the election. I’m completely satisfied with all of the women currently on the short list. I’ll support whoever is selected. That said I prefer Sen Harris.
Read this whole thread. I’m not going to comment on the content, but simply that Joe Biden does not write his own tweets lol.
People are working for money! This is Biden and Obama’s biggest night mirror
Kare 11 what do you think sunrisers think of Biden’s massively racists comments yesterday?   Please ask
Kare11 are you going to ask sunrisers what they think of Biden’s incredibly racist comments yesterday?   Or does that not fit your narrative?   If trump said these words I can only imagine.....,.
Willing to lie to Congress. Guess he’s qualified to serve in the trump administration. Vote for Biden and get rid of all of these guys.
They were not drugs they retested the substance and it wasn’t drugs but they are still trying to say she resisted arrest. Crooked Sheriffs Department! They need a FBI patterns and practices investigation after Biden wins this November!
Biden said something stupid and owned it. Who knew this was possible?
#Election2020 The Yo Semite and Thighland guy thinks that Joe Biden is the one who can't keep it together.
I worked for Bernie's campaign and i am a Democratic socialist, but I can see past my privilege to know what 4 more years of Trump will do to us.  I don't like Biden, but we have 2 choices, and Biden will bring a respectable cabinet and jurors with him. We need that.
I’m a proud gun owner who refuses to vote for you.  We own guns to protect us from a tyrannical government.  I’m sure Biden would do no worse than your Portland stunt.  If he does, that’s why we have a second amendment.

this is 5 months old but it is a compilation of Joe Biden's lies.

By voting for Biden!
True. But I’m not going to endorse Biden until he picks his VP. He has waited way too long and people are getting tired of it. I’ll give him another week.
How stupid do you have to be to let almost 160,000 people die on your watch because you didn’t adequately address or prepare for the pandemic and still not understand what you have to do??! We can’t afford to have Presidents be this dangerously stupid and incompetent. Vote Biden.
Sorry but I’d still rather have Biden than Trump.  He’s 100000000000 times worse
.....for Joe Biden.
BIDEN FOUGHT FOR FUCKING SEGREGATION, HOW DOES HE EVEN HAVE SUPPORTERS TO BEGIN WITH???
You just sound stupid making a comment like that.  How about making a coherent argument?  Try to defend Biden's brain.  LOL
It's only scary to me that someone who seems reasonably intelligent like you can actually buy in to all the media propaganda. Trump had done an amazing job with the economy until the virus hit.  His running the country like a business has been successful, and yet, you want Biden?
Democrats are hoping for chaos, they know Biden has virtually no chance
Vote for Joe Biden and INTEGRITY.
As long as the the votes go to Joe Biden and gets this evil doer out of office! I’m all for it! He’s the biggest cheater and liar ever seen in the White House! Stupid to! Brags that he passed a Dementia test! Good boy! If we don’t test there wouldn’t be cases! Stupid Stupid!!
You mean Biden and his team might be better at this than random twitter person?
Let’s not show Biden can’t hold a regular conversation with anybody onless prompted?
Hey, um, Bernie:  You or your staff should have deleted this one.  Not that I care anymore, but if you are trying to sell Biden, this ain't the way to do it.  All of us can do a top ten Trump sucks list.  Make a GOOD top ten list for Biden without mentioning Trump.  I'll wait.
Your right Biden will be sleeping instead
We will drag u out by your feet! Well have the marshalls treat u like u have treated American protesters and remove your ass out of the White House! Your trying to undermined the right to vote in every way possible! Cuz your polls! Are down 15 points under Biden! You have failed
Biden doesn’t need to say another word between now and the election and he’ll still trounce Trump.   All Biden has to do is sit back and let Trump dig his own political grave by opening his mouth and saying the stupidest shit possible to know he’s not a leader.
I take it as a given that Biden will, as Obama and to a slightly lesser extent Clinton did, normalize the excesses of the previous administration.  Does anyone genuinely think that the winning team is going to just give up executive powers used by the previous administration?
Repeat after me:  I will do my homework and decide for myself what I think of Joe Biden's VP pick.  I will tell anyone who instructs me to do otherwise to fuck off.
Rice would get pelted for being one of the Libya intervention architects.  Biden's entire short list is women with huge liabilities.
It’s not a shortage of workers problem. It’s a top management problem which Biden can fix with a pen stroke.
And you want to blame Trump for lazy or stupid people?  What did Obama/Biden do to fix that for 8 years?? NOTHING.
What progress? I can’t think of anything trump has done that is progress. I hope it all goes away. That’s why we vote Biden 2020
I think a Pivot to Haley could be very problematic for Biden. No?
He has dimentia, And my father has Alzheimers. And the Democrats sadly are using him like a puppet to gain power. I feel sorry for Biden. I'm angry with Democrats for letting it go on this long over one man.
Please, please, please, tell me there are tapes.
Admit it!   Biden 2020
Please do tell me why I should vote for Biden. You can't mention Trump, Republicans, or anything else related. Only describe his platform, and how it would benefit America. Go ahead.
We’ve been waiting, Donnie, but frankly if after 3.5 years of your watch we are in a depression, dying of a plague, and in the midsts of rampant racism perhaps it’s time for a change. So I guess it’s Biden’s turn. Vote Biden 2020.
I hope President Biden has a spot for him. A real patriot!
Biden was faded before he started
A vote for anyone other than Biden is a vote for Trump.  Don’t vote 3rd party. You are wasting your vote and subjecting our country to 4 more years of the most dangerous unstable racist modern president we have ever had in history. Trump must go. Vote Biden. Don’t fuck this up.
Dogs are even better judges of character than monkeys. And everybody knows monkeys are excellent judges of character. 😂  But the only monkey Trump has ever had was on his back.  Biden 2020
Joe Biden for president
Also, she’s beautiful.
It's either Joe or Trump. Those are the only choices. I'm not a Biden fan either, but 1 rape allegation is not as bad as 30 rape allegations, charges for pedophilia and outspoken white supremacy. Choice between the 2 is clear.  We have to get Trump out. Then work on progress.
The ONLY way dems have a chance in November is to keep the virus deadly and uncontrollable in the meantime, and keeping schools closed even though no student anywhere has ever transmitted the virus to a teacher.  But, Biden will still have to debate Trump and then it's GAME OVER.
Please. Let’s get FakeJillBiden on Twitter! She and I would be besties.

I probably would but I would be wearing my Biden face mask.
I think your TDS is terminal.  It's a good thing Biden didn't enrich himself and his family by exploiting the Biden name in China and around the world.
Now that the trumpeter has floated the idea of postponing the election #WeWillVote November 3. And we will vote for Biden. 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊
Right because managing the free world is the same as serving in the military.  What rank did Biden achieve in the military?  Oh, yeah. What an idiot.
You can't delay the election dummy! Biden will wipe the floor with you and if you try to stay they will forcefully remove you! I can't wait!
And the shit flows freely from your mouth. Again it's like .0001% fraud from mail in voting EVER! I can't wait til Biden LEGITIMATELY CRUSHES you in November!
I agree. Susan Rice isn’t a politician. For VP we need someone with political skills and experience such as Harris. Susan Rice is an ideal choice for Secretary of State where her vast foreign policy experience will be most helpful to President Biden.
You, sir, are a national treasure and a gift to all of us 🇺🇸
Especially dumb argument given that Biden ran against Obama in the primary... and then was selected to be his VP. I guess it was ok for him to be ambitious.
Joe Biden is not going to do what left wants he is doing what the corrupt establishment wants.
😂 congrats on the pay-out whichever Rivera/Riviera you go! $
2) VP Biden didn’t run on M4A. He won the most votes and the most delegates. He ran on improving the ACA. He is the presumptive nominee. As frustrating as that must be for you, I’m sure you understand how elections work.
Too bad you can’t travel right now internationally, or you could head to the French Riviera. Bad timing for your windfall 😂
On the one hand, I agree it's uncomfortably close, on the other, the issues you state... and if these were the actual results in those states, that'd mean a win with somewhere above 320 EVs for Biden, so there's that
Obviously you didn't get the memo that we expect you to go on  in October and vouch for Joe Biden.As Biden would say cmon man. You really think you just thought of that? 😳
Kanye West should be ashamed to support a xenophobic racists! He evidently believe in the kkk theories that God made them superior to all others! That is absolutely  Asinine! He supposed to be a preacher_Really!?
I don't think that trip to Ohio is going to give him the boost he expected given the unhinged rant he unleashed against Joe Biden's faith and his ludicrous misunderstanding of how the constitution is amended. This man HAS no God but money.
Biden wants to stop all oil exploration drilling, fracking, and wants to shut down coal power plants. The guy is a clown!
Exactly. I am convinced the "pick is in".  It would be a glorious weekend for many if Biden made his pick known today.
Biden isn't worthy of anyone's vote!
Are we afraid of what the tRump camp might say about Rice? Biden will choose the best woman for VP....period!
Great strategy: Biden’s supporters are approving Trump BEFORE 03 Nov...
Omg she just throws out my thoughts cause I have maga in my bio. Why y’all do that? It’s not like I throw out your thoughts cause u a Biden supported. I actually listen to what u gotta say. Why everyone do this
The strategy will be ready after this Nov 3rd when Joe Biden gets elected
Biden's done for, good riddance.
Biden needs to choose a fucking capable adult that won't sell out the country for more money. It's not difficult. #VoteBiden
Maybe he should go to Thigh land.  What kind of moron continues to try to say Biden is some kind of gaffe machine when Trump is just walking around with his pants around his ankles every day?
You’ve actively listened to trump for the past 4 years and are at a loss at what comes out of BIDEN’S mouth??
Biden's out to lunch, gone!
We had a family member who exhibited these same behaviors. I would guess Joe Biden is about 24 months from being disabled by Dementia.
Biden is against GOD now? I bet he knows a scripture from the Bible, unlike Orange Face, gets more insane everyday.
Putin still has 90 days believe nothing the media says about Biden's lead. Vote as if your life depends on it REGARDLESS  Because this foremost needs to be a win Needs to be blow out in epic fashion Vote BLUE UP AND DOWN EVERY TICKET Give America the second chance we all deserve
He has to pick the one he thinks he can work the best with. He and Obama were a great working team. Biden deserves the same.
...and once Biden decides on his V.P., who will most likely be a WOC, watch the enthusiasm runneth over!
Seeing VP Biden in action will change a lot of minds!
Someone should remind him of that pic of Joe Biden in a church, praying, that his campaign doctored.
Thank u president Biden. You’re the man. ✔️

Professor who accurately predicted every election since 1984 says Biden will beat Trump - CBS News
Biden is in favor of the Green New Deal, which would destroy our economy.
America trusts Biden to steer us out of this mess.
If it wasnt for Covid19 and your Dem leaders lying over and over this economy would still be smoking hot,you are unfit to be President Mr Biden,the economy will crash,they will replace you with your VP as soon as you get sworn in because you cant handle the stress that Trump does
So partisan Twitter better Pray Biden wins because they will loose their Protections in  section 230  and the last few years has proven they deserve to pay for silencing us from free speech..
Biden's not all there, tough crap DemocRATS, Lmao
Trump is also wanting to defund the USPS, as well as try to tamper with the mail-in voting process.  If this is all happening, I have no choice to vote in-person at my polling station. I will just do that, and count my vote in for Biden.  Don't let this man tarnish your vote.
Joe Biden wins

Republicans are taking advantage of someone with an admitted mental health disorder in an effort to create a Jill Stein-like candidate and siphon black voters off Joe Biden.
That was an atrocious interview, he showed his true colors throughout. I'm betting heads will roll over allowing him to actually do it. He won't take responsibility, he never does, but he'll have to blame someone. We'll blame him.
There is nothing in the Constitution (I wish the  would send Carlson their pocket edition) that even remotely suggests any restriction on who Joe may select as his vice president. Nothing. Carlson is a fool. His  slurs are an insult to all Americans.
So do as I say, not as I do. So my way or the highway.  If I wanted my abusive asshole of a father, I would have voted him in. I however voted for Clinton and come November I will be voting for Biden.
Vice President Biden campaigns (mostly) from home because unlike your guy, Biden is actually concerned about people getting sick.  90 days. . . .
In Florida....LMAO....and when you lose Florida remember that.  Don't you dare say "we did an incredible job, but they found a way to be illegal....hope Biden calls in Special Forces after you lose to cleanup the WH and have you escorted out
This is like a really bad sitcom of this mongoloid of a president.  and still continues to downplay deaths of the Coronavirus, which means he doesn't care about people at all.  You'd have to be a utter fucking moron to vote for him at this point.  So please, vote for Biden.
Ok Sokol_kel, I take back everything I said in the other thread about debating Biden. I’d be ok with beating up Walz in a nursing home.
Biden is generous with other people's money! Wheres Hunter?
He doesn't want to lose more votes, so goes to mail-in voting which about 68% of the people have said they're going to do.  He makes it look fraudulent and blames Democrats.  He thinks he can knockout Muhammad Ali/Biden by punching and weaving and not get knocked out completely
Im not sure. Biden has nothing to lose. Trump does. It’s like a #1 college football team playing a trap game. No upside. #1 team wins, they didn’t prove anything. Bad team scores, does well, God forbid wins, then the sky is falling. Add moderators. Spin. Newscycle. Not worth it.
Published reports said that Kolomoisky had refused to set up a meeting with President Donald Trump’s ally Rudy Giuliani and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in an attempt to dig up dirt against Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden last year.
Vote for Biden!
And so it begins. Let’s Scrap the Presidential Debates
Yeah. Good point. There is surely no reason then that Biden can’t do the same thing.
If Biden's on the ballot he is who gets or doesn't get the vote. We don't vote for a VP who might become President through death.
I hope you're right, Biden would be a disaster.
Partial truth because Obama wasn't Republican ...at THIS point in time...OBAMA isn't a candidate at THIS point in time.  You're comparing to a non running Democrat, but not BIDEN at THIS point in time....your partial truth using specific phrases that don't relate to your opponent
Biden is garbage, #FourMoreYears for Trump is assured !!
So Dumb Donald Trump' said horrible things about Americans threatens violence because they peacefully protesting peacefully, called them thugs and criminals. Did nothing even addressing a rising death toll due to the Trump Virus.  In order to combat him show him vote Biden

Another good question is why Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi and other   Democrats that say they are Catholic, can be pro-abortion? As a Catholic, I want to know why they are allowed communion? Why are they not excommunicated?
Seriously! Where is this coming from? Obama announced Biden on Aug 23. 3 DAYS before the convention. Clinton announced Kaine on Jul 22. 2 DAYS before the convention. This is manufactured drama.
Biden won't be elected so who cares who he picks as VP?
The testing strategy will only come out when Biden gets elected this Nov
A vote for biden hopefully free the children.
Biden is too chicken to debate Trump.
Either way Biden's going down, the guy is a senile joke!
No problem with the deficit, just repeal that massive tax cut they gave to the already rich. That should be high up on President Biden's agenda. When people talk about equity in wealth distribution that is the exact opposite of what they mean. Except republicans, of course.
A non vote for Biden IS a vote for Trump. In a close election, actions like that are enough to give Trump another turn. Everything can be handled when Trump is gone. Everything. Saying otherwise is divisive and unhelpful when what we need is him gone, his party gone. Focus.
How come Biden is too chicken to debate Trump?
oh, BTW Biden supporters have been burning Bibles, you have anything to say about that?
Biden doesn’t know who Chris Wallace is!  Or does he?
Because Pres Trump has the people at heart...Biden and his lefties only care about themselves.
Biden wants to continue the apology tour that Obozo started.
Biden would continue the apology tour that Obama started.

Should we do like Biden and Obama and just stop testing? That’s exactly what they did during the last pandemic.
Just do like Biden and Obama. Stop testing.
Should just stop testing like Obama and Biden did during the Swine Flu pandemic.
It’s actually MUCH higher. You ignorant liberals over sample the 10% minority you project to be the majority on fake news. Just like when Hillary lost, Biden will lose. Why not conduct real polling? Oh because sleepy locked in the basement Joe would be down by 30% or more
It’ll be a great inauguration crowd regardless.  Bigger than Trump’s though that’s a pretty low bar.
You honestly think Biden has a say in this?  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"Our country is in burning turmoil, and the White House is eagerly fanning the flames. If we are to have a shot at quenching them, let alone beginning to repair the damage left behind, we will have to play the two-party game to its conclusion in November."

I'm glad he's gone, Biden will be the next to go.
Yikes 😬  But he can't do that though too, congress should and will definitely not do this.  But in other context, Trump will throw anything as a curveball for this election. Like possibly not wanting to accept if he loses.  So get out there, and vote for Biden. Please.
Want to bet? Biden will disappear in the ash heap of history, good riddance to the groping clown!
Nah, you not acknowledging you were talking out of your ass about chinese imports was what made you a clown-- this is just really weak sauce use to say Biden is in it with the Chinese. In the end I don't think he'd green light muslim concentration camps-- so that's good by me.

A Biden presidency won't help anyone except Hunter.
I mean maybe more with Biden and actuary tables I’ll be interested in who he picks, but basically as long as I believe they could be president... who cares?
How many VP picks actually matter? Cause frankly all I remember from Obama picking Biden was that he handled Palin well and beat Paul Ryan so badly on TV I was waiting for a corner man to throw the towel.
Yes, a source would be nice. If Biden did say it sure that would be distasteful, but taking the dreams of millions of Americans (of all races) away just to be spiteful. I don't know seems a little worse to me. 🤷🤷
This was purposely leaked to gauge the reaction of the masses. This was NO accident.
Biden has to do an outstanding job of fixing all that Trump broke because the mid terms are often hard on the new president's party, so the focus has to shift immediately for the DNC and all progressives after 1/21 to the 2022 elections. Great candidates, great policies.Watch it again you #Liar  Joe Biden is racist and Donald Trump is incompetent.  #VoteThirdParty
So you want to boycott the family and extended family of black man because he’s running for president, and you want to takeaway people’s ability to vote for him because I assume you’re worried he’ll take Black voters away from Biden? That sure sounds good and moral
Keeps making a pretty good argument for Biden I tell ya...
Okay nothing to see hear then...."Latinos are more diverse then the black communities"- joe biden.  Doesn't sound racist at all🐑🤫🤔🤣😂
Also show me the exact legal documents showing "Trump" not anyone else,  that he colluded with Russia.  If you say his associates were charged, then you prove in this picture that Biden is a Racist by association.
Explain why Biden is holding hands with a known racist.  Are you so 🧠 washed you cannot see?  This is a what is wrong with the left.  If this were Trump holding hands with the KKK you would never hear the end of it.  You haven't addressed the picture that is clearly relevant.
Blue wave the kkk will rise again with Biden!
11th Hour: Trump claims Biden is 'against God'. #ImpeachTrump #traitorinchief
Let’s be honest .. Biden ain’t write this shit lmao
They put a ridiculous amount of money and effort in 2018 midterms and still lost (with Ted Cruz’s senate seat being the only one that came close), and I don’t see Joe Biden being more popular than Beto in Texas or Dems being able to focus as much money or effort into Texas
Joe Biden will dethrone God.
Hmmm! Lemme see?      A) Joe Biden (definitely not my first choice) or     B) Donald Trump AND your ass  No offense to your ass, but I think I'll stick with A
If you pay close attention at 6:40, you'll notice Ileana runs for and wins AOC's congressional seat in 2028  But why would AOC not run for reelection in 2028?  What else could she be doing once she's constitutionally eligible to be president and Biden's done with his second term?

I’m entirely sure that your entire “debate plan” is to scream, call names, rage like a raving lunatic, and otherwise do anything in your power to trigger Mr. Biden’s stutter...so that you can post heavily edited propaganda films showing HIM to be as incompetent as you.
1) When asked if he’d veto M4A he punted - which isn’t the same as saying he’s definitely veto it.   2) His plan is better than what we have now because it would cover more people.   3) Did you know M4A ≠ universal healthcare?

Why bother debating Trump at all? Seems like very little upside for Biden and a lot of downside considering Biden can't spend the whole debate fact checking the president.
I couldn’t agree more. Biden needs a VP he can trust.
Biden needs someone he can trust. Kamla is not better than any of the other women. Let’s not hold the way Kamala attacked Biden as a model. She essentially called Biden a racist. She had to start her attack by saying she does think Biden is racist. Well that means you think he is
The narrative that people are opposed to Kamla as VP choice because she is ambitious is nonsense. All politicians are ambitious. It is about decency, respect for your colleagues. She knew Biden but attacked him personally that hurt him. None of the other candidates did that.

Allowing Trump to win is a fast track to a worse world. Dreaming the impossible dream will not only increase the risk, but if you were to succeed in making some small, meaningless dent in Biden's support could almost assure it.

Good! Nobody vote for Biden! We didn't nominate him.
And Biden is no different. REVOLUTION
Thanks, I'll have to do more research, I'm not nearly as worried as many Democrats are. This is the ultimate nuclear option and would result in the destruction of the United States. I don't believe there are many Republicans that would opt for this path over Biden.
And she called Biden a racist in the debates
Any thoughts about Secret Biden voters? Maybe wives turned off by Donnie but afraid to tell husbands, friends, etc? There is a LOT of pressure to stay on board in small towns, afraid to be called a "liberal".Isn’t that the same for Biden? We are not to judge
Renewed questions after he changed his climate plan to be more progressive? By who - the author of the article who doesn’t like Biden?
Friendly reminder: This is 2020, and Joe Biden is perfectly capable of screwing this up.
Real Americans need to vote Biden no matter who he chooses. The alternative is an unchecked Trump, who will only get crazier, more ruthless, lie more, and become more corrupt.
I also live in MN-in Duluth. I literally see NO Biden signs but I see trump signs on more and more cars but no one wants to put them on their yard. Except a few people. I’m trying to figure out how I can start something to get our governor out! Or how to start impeachment!

When did Biden withhold money? And Trump blocked dozens of people testifying, which made for a completely unfair trial. And even further, a few people did say in as many words that he withheld money in exchange for political dirt. Biden wasn’t guilty, so he didn’t block anyone.
I agree with you but it seems like he’s just not mentally there. I saw a thing where he thought Arizona was a city and that he told voters he was running for senate 😂 hopefully he’ll have a good VP because Biden’s brain isn’t making it 4 years
Chris Wallace is a Joke!!! Period!Chris Wallace says Trump wouldn't want more debates if he was leading in polls

Here's a hot take: Biden might be dumber than Trump.
Biden makes clear Trump wouldn't get any special favors to avoid criminal prosecution
Honest question: do democrats actually like Biden? Or are they just waiting to pick his running mate so they have someone they actually want in office once they can deem him unfit for office if he wins?   Whats the Biden appeal other than "he's not trump?" Not being snarky.

“Biden is ignoring science and the school re-opening protocols recommended by the CDC.”
In a normal election cycle this would be quite troubling for Biden.  But since the primary purpose of Trump’s campaign is the grift, a significant percentage of that $165 million is getting laundered through hotels, golf courses and fellow crooks rather than used to defeat Biden.
Girl, right??? I'm so pissed at what's been going on.  I live for the day Biden is sworn in as the 46th President and I can be proud to say I live here.
Wow. You people will believe anything. They were talking about Biden and whoever made this, put in Trump where they originally had Biden. Lol.

So you really don’t care about Biden, it’s just a ‘well he’s not Trump’ and that’s it? I asked pretty simple questions and your response is basically ‘I’m mad at you for asking questions’. Be prepared for Biden to win less votes than Clinton did, as that’s a distinct possibility.

Vote Biden to ‘restore the soul of America’???  Could it be ANY more meaningless? Is that gonna drive people younger than 70 to the polls? In this era of pandemic death/illness/unemployment, you’d think his #1 would address those. Global warming also, but he’s paid by oil, right?
Dear liberal,  Biden isn't a choice. He's almost 100% ideologically different than what America needs and wants. Has made almost all mistakes. Doesn't excite anyone. Has ideas I'm uncomfortable with that I'm not willing to just get over.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot  #TrumpHasNoPlan #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
I suppose we got some excited for Biden here too, but most left leaning people have some heavy criticisms of him and wish for a third option. Kinda like how 33% in that poll up there really csn’t settle on either candidate.
It showed that with the exclusive backing of the DNC he could carry a state (SC) that he can’t win in Nov.   Choosing Biden was the biggest mistake the DNC could’ve made. He’s literally no one’s first choice and the lack of actual support outside the DNC will doom his run.
yeah. Don’t knock on my door during a pandemic, dummy.

I am not a Biden fan either but 3rd party vote only helps Trump.  I am all for 3rd party but not in this election.  Trump is dangerous.  Biden isn't.
Even if Biden were as willfully ignorant and cognitively impaired as Trump — and he isn’t, but for the sake of argument let’s assume he is — Biden is NOT an inherently evil, selfish, egomaniacal sociopath incapable of a moment’s self-reflection or deference to others’ judgment.
46 Minutes Of Joe Biden Talking Nonsense  via   #Biden2020
There is no way this guy can win without major cheating or major Biden dirt dump at the last minute.
I will crawl over broken glass and through 3 inches of lemon juice with half a ton of salt mixed in to vote for Biden if I have to.
Pay attention to Biden’s VP pick. If he should become president (no chance in hell) his VP will slip into the presidency spot shortly afterward when Biden is deemed incompetent-
LMAO ok now you’re just trolling. He wished Maxwell well. They were all buds. Now stop calling Biden a pedophile if you’re going to try and defend ANY of this.
I think we should call it like it is, we're on the brink of a once in a generation landslide that could bring a solid Democrat majority to the Senate along with a presidency for Biden. Rather than just Biden, expand the goal to a 55+ D to 45- R Senate. That's change to work for.
This is Texas from the Economist's model. While the trend line is showing a slight trump lead (call it 1.5%) the majority of recent polls in Texas actually have Biden winning. The Economist is giving trump a boost to account for shy voters, if the pollsters are too, Biden wins.
I don’t want to see them. You can’t really debate with a psychopath any more than you can argue with a Trump Cult member. Biden’s strength would be in calmness and reason not the needed frontal assault for lies and failures.

It's amazing when Trump people call Biden a pedo when Trump was BFFs with Epstein and has so many rape allegations against him, at least one of which was by a child, that I had to stop counting.
If Biden wins Texas the electoral college vote is going to look like Bush vs. Dukakis.
No, Biden's ahead of trump by about 7 percentage points. The worst case polls in 2016 were off 3 to 5 points and they're looking for/adding in shy trump voters now so Biden's lead may actually be higher. As long as people turn out to vote it's going to be a lopsided election.
It's a joke that they're saying Wisconsin is a toss up. Wisconsin is leaning pretty heavily to Biden. It's more likely to go Biden than PA is. But they need to have a horse race and by pretending WI is a toss up they can create the illusion of one.
What if he comes back to Amy? Obviously, it won't be her but she'd make the a great VP. If I had a choice I would be suggesting Sen. Duckworth. Biden has said he'll be a transitional President and who better to transition to than Tammy Duckworth?

I'm not sure how you could possibly have misread that.   When we, progressives, criticize Biden, democrats screech that we must be supporting Trump.   There is no room on the Democratic party for criticism of the candidates.
Trump is obsessed with putting his name on things..  I am honestly surprised he hasnt commissioned a memorial to himself.   I hope Biden erases the Trump legacy from the White House and all documents like, you know, Trump did to Obama.
If Biden wins, we're going to know fairly early on the evening of November 3rd. To win, Trump must sweep FL, GA, NC, OH, and PA. If Biden wins just one of those 5 states, trump has no clear path to victory. He'd have to win WI or MI plus 4 of the previous 5.
He’s such a fast-talking liar. Good job by the interviewer; he’s in so deep with Trump and he can’t talk his way out. I liked her question about how much time he’s been spending on Burisma vs. COVID. Even he knew his focus on smearing Biden didn’t look good.
🤣🤣🤣 and we are supposed to believe his crooked wife that Joe Biden would be the best President for our country???? What a joke!
If Joe Biden wanted someone to insult his dead son, all he had to do was ask, seriously. I'm more than willing.
Think about this, like really think about this for a minute, this is so fucked up. Joe Biden just said he wants other people's sons to die because his son died.
So are you voting for Biden then?
His interview of him calling it "fake news" airs tomorrow. That better not be the final word on it before the election. It will make for a great Biden ad, if nothing else.
With Biden in there the post office will be fully operational #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
I'm not narrowing my choices like that for an election 4 years away. With the ages of Biden and Pelosi and others, we need a new generation of leaders to be elevated and the VP choice is a start.
No matter who he picks, it takes someone out of their current position of power.   My feeling is that Bidens choice becomes the 2024 party leader and default front runner and I think we need someone like her to follow Biden.
Do I have the answers?  Oh, fuck no.  Do I think Joe Biden has the answers?  Oh fuck no.  But I believe he also thinks the same, he doesn't have all the answers.  But he's willing to ask those who know about the answers, even if he doesn't know the questions. OGL?  Yeah, no.
Yup. That’s why the Bernie bro’s never Biden/trumpy voters scare me. Like, if there was ever an election to fall in line with the stupid two party election, it’s this one. IMHO
I’m basing mine of my 43 yrs of experience. I predicted trump would win over Hillary only because people really didn’t want a female president (🙄). For me, I don’t see him getting elected again. But things can change when Biden’s VP is announced. It’ll be interesting to see.
I mean, everyone could grow a backbone and demand Biden drop out. Otherwise, it's likely to happen again.
Logic challenged you say? I mean, I aced several philosophy classes and a calc class while barely opening the book. But I'm logic challenged because I recognize that Biden caused Trump, lol. You're a riot.
Good God, read what you said. You were outraged that someone would be angry about some of the shit Biden has said. He's running for fucking POTUS, not class clown.   Demand he drops out or we're all fucked. Again, not hyperbole in the slightest.
I started out civil, you're the one that turned into a raving lunatic when Biden was questioned.
This is the current  Party who wants Joe Biden in the White House
We're just gonna pretend like it's not very clear that Biden is a pedo with his kiddie sniffing and groping?  And don't fucking "BUT TRUMP" me. Yes, he's objectively disgusting, BUT SO IS BIDEN.
Uh, I'm not whining about losing the primary. I get it, you're too dense to understand much, but the reality is that we're mad that you idiots that aren't demanding Biden step down are going to end the country. We have reached a breaking point.
Your response is to keep doing the same fucking thing we've always done and hope something changes.   And I love how you Biden bots are the first to get nasty when someone dares even QUESTION Biden. It shows you're fully steeped in the establishment propaganda.
Lol, that's rich coming from the guy that's melting down.  People that bought into the bullshit electability argument that got Biden nominated.  Flip Congress and impeach Trump and his VP.   I mean, we could have just had a candidate everyone would have supported.
People voted for Biden because the entire media started screeching about "electability". Turns out, Biden is the one with an electability problem.
If you're willing to accept Biden in the current situation, you're insane.   That's not hyperbole.  Biden caused Trump. 2022 and 2024 are gonna make 2020 look like a cool summer day if Biden or Trump wins, it's just going to be different versions of the nightmare.
And again, you need to take your own advice here. Tell Biden to learn some empathy so he doesn't say, "I have no empathy for millennials.." when talking about us dealing with all the problems that he caused. Fuck off.
Stupid reference on a radio show? He told dude "if you ain't voting for me you ain't black" in response to "yeah, I'd love to have you back on the show I have more questions for you."  And Biden's history is actually fucking atrocious. Look it up.
Out of Bernie and Biden, only one of them is actually in a seat of power in the US. Which one is it again? Hmmm?
Please tell me how people could think trump is banning TikTok for political reasons even tho he’s more popular on there than Biden
Trump is more famous than Biden on TikTok
Dead serious. Look at any link and trace it back to it's source. It is Daily Caller.   The whole point of the story (even being true) was the "rising star" part. They wanted and created outrage and doubt towards the Biden team.   A grain of deceit into a truth is how it's done.
Trump is more famous on TikTok then Biden is why would he be mad
She was never a contender.   This article came from the Daily Caller. They call her a "rising star" and people went nuts.   There is no doubt at all that the Biden vetting team saw this long ago and she was off the list. We need to have more confidence in Biden's experience.
I have almost died multiple times in my life because of the trash policies of republicans and democrats like Biden.   Biden and friends caused Trump's rise. What the fuck makes you think Biden will do anything to help?
Stop fucking gaslighting people. You "moderates" are the reason that you'll lose, again. Think about what a slam dunk this presidency should be for anyone running against Trump and then remember that Biden might very well lose.   You don't think there's a reason for that?
Look, the reason that Trump won in the first place is because people like Biden ran the country into the ground with republican-lite policies for decades and allowed the right wing to smear the left as if Biden and friends were "left". Biden can't "fix" anything.
Ah, ya, trying to belittle someone that you need to vote for your candidate. That seems like a winning strategy. Tell me, that worked out great in '16, right?  Obama won in '08 despite 15% of Clinton supporters voting against him. It's almost like Clinton/Biden just suck.
That we can't have everything? We asked for a decent human being and you idiots settled on a kiddie sniffer that doesn't know where he is half the time.  The fact that every democrat hasn't demanded Biden drop is proof that y'all are no better than R's.
Riiiight. The person crying that Biden doesn't automatically get everyone's vote is calling other people a crybaby. Lol, that's rich.
Biden doesn't sell himself, that's why his handlers have largely kept him locked away. The worst thing for Joe is letting him speak.  His interview with the Breakfast Club? He has no empathy for millennials? Nothing will fundamentally change? That list just goes on and on.
He's not a continuation of a disaster? Who do you think is at fault for Trump winning to begin with? People like Biden. Why are you so blind?
Anyone that mentions Hunter Biden in the future gets this shoved down their throat.

The #KarenBass situation was created entirely by a right wing propaganda group and has been astoundingly successful.   Their goal had nothing to do with what she did, but to make you all doubt the process of Biden's vetting and choosing a VP.   And you all fell for it.
Can we please stop listening to right wing #propagandists when they pretend to give us inside info about Democratic campaigns?   Pretty please?  Does anyone really believe that Biden's vetting team didn't know this months ago?  She is not and never was a rising star for VP.

Less than a year ago, the Never Trump movement had been left for dead. Now  and others toll Trump daily, and will probably throw the election to Biden. Not that Biden needed any help.
Why is Biden and Obama so determined to get rid of the filibuster now? So they can do everything in your power to keep everything as close to the way it is right now as possible? There's nothing particularly radical in their platform that would require a filibuster proof majority

Without Dems in control of the Senate, immigration reform and any number of important issues will continue to languish in Congress.  Bills cannot make it to Pres Biden if they aren't brought up and passed in the Senate.  Vote Blue up and down the ballot.  🌊
By the numbers only, is Biden wrong though? Where does the black vote usually go?
hey Pete, Biden wants to get rid the 2nd amendment?  He is a gun owner right now. Has Trump ever been a fun owner?
I hate Biden but I'm still going to vote for him. Why? Because its going to be biden or trump and I for one don't want another 4 years of that walking shitstain destroying this country.  Also keep in mind its not just biden we are voting for -c-
People need to stop posting things about the shitty stuff Biden has said or done. Yes, we get it, he is not great by any means but crap like that is going to convince people to just not vote and every single vote not for Biden is one less trump needs to worry about.
Biden rarely makes any sense; this time is no exception.
It would be nice if Michelle Obama.  Would be Joe Biden running mate! She would make  a great VP and president!
Marc, I’m distressed about all the folks willing to vote for Trump, too.  We just *must* turn out every Biden voter.  Remind your friends to vote for “down ballot” races, too.  Can’t fix everything without Congress &amp; State Houses on board.  🌊

If anybody is going to sabotage Joe Biden it is Joe Biden
That doesn't mean they were right, either based on what we knew at the time or now, but why people believed what they did matters and we should seek to learn instead of condemn based on just so stories.

it does matter what Trump say about Biden,  its all stupid anyway.  The tactics of him trying to put Biden in  a bad light isnt working.  It pathetic and childish.  We adults know that.
It's a political loser. Joe Biden can see that. We're trying to win an election here.
TBH, the idea of Biden “hurting god” is a selling point. Weakening the toxic hold that religion has on this country is unequivocally good.  (Not that it’s true. The practicing Catholic is more religious than the guy who’s broken all ten commandments.)
Sorry Kanye and  this stupid stunt will only hurt you not Biden!  It’s already pulling more people away from you Don the Con so thanks for the Biden votes!

This is election is not a one-v-one battle. Biden and Trump are simply the spokespeople for two large but very, very different visions.   One vision relies on science, data, experience, and expertise. The other relies on “speaking your mind”, “thoughts”, and “prayers”
Dear fellow white people:  Stop focusing on Kanye's presidential run. Stop saying he'll peel away the Black vote. You know what you should focus on instead?  In a recent poll, 50% of white people said they still plan to vote Trump.  Focus on fucking that.
Joe Biden needs to STFU if he wants any chance of winning the election
Stunning so many have such little faith in the American voter, who assuredly understands Biden always has been, and is now more so,an empty suit. Also, after enduring 8 years of a guy’s incessant self-adulation echoed by a fawning media, the “braggadocio” label on POTUS is rich.

He just came out to say that he's doing this to hurt Joe Biden. Ergo it is not a serious campaign. And as someone who has been battling mental health issues my entire life, I just want him to get his mind healthy. Seems like he's been spiraling ever since his mom died.
However that can only happen if you are welcomed by the patriarchal society to do so.   I am seeing it happen with the conversation lately in terms of Joe Biden's VP pick, and  in particular.
I think people feel if the VP pick doesn’t inspire people it might make more sense for people to invest in more local campaigns with more inspiring candidates who will be more likely to turn out a lot of voters (who will then also hopefully vote for Biden…).
22% of lgbtq voters voted the incorrect way in 2016. 14% for Tr*mp and 8% for third party candidates. We can do better this time. There is no reason for us not to be voting for Joe Biden who is an ally and a supporter.

When your narcissism makes you think you’re God, of course Biden’s against you.
Black voters are smarter than you, Bill. Joe Biden will receive more than 90% of the Black vote, helping him breeze to a decisive, overwhelming victory.  Tiny Trump is going to lose &amp; lose badly. A year from now you'll be denying you ever supported Trump. #BetterTrollsPlease

It really bothers me to acknowledge the validity and probability of this statement.  HOWEVER, I truly believe that all of the possible female candidates have merit as potential VP’s.  I am hoping Biden chooses A. Klobuchar, K. Harris or E. Warren. Optics are essential right now.

I agree!!  We, as the black community, had 8 YEARS to get on top and Obama did NOTHING for blacks. He sat on his hands.  And now people think that IF Biden wins (with a token black female VP), HE is going to suddenly open the flood gates for blacks?? 🤣🤡🤣 #MAGA2020 #POTUS

Even if it doesn't matter that much, I do think Biden should wait on an announcement until Trump has committed on Pence.
People are working for money! This is Biden and Obama’s biggest night mirror
Do Not Pledge To support This feeble Unelectable Racist. Biden cant beat trump  We cant afford to lose so we cant afford to nominate feeble joe
That means if I don't vote for Trump I'm directly voting for Biden!
All of these women are more than qualified! Biden never said that he would necessarily choose a woman of color. His VP candidates are a milliom times better than what is in the WH at this time.
I grew up in Virginia. I'm 100% puerto rican. My friends' parents were always like, "Louie, you'd probably like this. It's real spicy." Me: I'm not Mexican, I'm Puerto Rican🤦‍♂️  That's what Biden meant in an anecdote.
If you don't vote for Joe Biden then "you ain't black."
Joe Biden supports #infanticide if a planned #abortion fails.  #Jesus would disapprove.
Even if Biden had all the questions and answers he would gaffe!😂😂😂😂
Joe Biden DENIED communion from the Catholic Church.
Trump: Biden is destroying love, god, ants, birds, bees, dogs and cats, trees and grass.   Biden: Person. Man. Woman. Camera. Thigh-land. 🤷‍♂️😆
The Trump attack on Biden's faith is beyond unacceptable. I can take his childish name calling and political differences but this might be one of his most offensive remarks to date. If you're a born again Christian and you're okay with this, it's time to examine your own faith.
So, if in 1994, if a younger Joe Biden hadn’t been woke yet, you ideology is that he couldn’t possibly have grown and corrected his way of thinking? He did serve with black president, maybe he has seen truth. #peoplechange #woke
I wonder if they use the term “God almighty” and also believe Biden could hurt him. Or if they believe the Bible is literally perfect after all the res robing hands through whom it’s come to us and yet Biden could hurt it.
Typical lyin Biden on his racist rants AGAIN!! As if he's going to be any better than Trump. He's just as dangerous, a genocidal nut job and yet the DNC shoves the old racist down our throats.
Yeah, this is why I stopped using RCP a while ago for anything other than finding individual polls. Biden may have lost a bit of ground, but this reeks of ignoring his best polls to fit a narrative.
So Biden is racist?  Wow did he take out a full page add in the NYT calling for the execution of 5 innocent black kids?  Because that should be disqualifying...right?
Trump is in electoral hot water. It could be even worse for him by November
you know damn well Trump is a racist like Joe Biden. SIT DOWN!!
"Most prolific, creative thinker" is a nice compliment to pay someone, but we know what Biden thinks about Warren's "prolific" thoughts, so I don't really see how this works.
Trump hits Biden for referring to blacks as a monolith by referring to blacks as a monolith 🤦🏾
Kanye thinks all Black people are fools. Black people know how important voting for BIDEN is. I feel very sorry for West. Mental illness is a tough thing to deal with
This time next year Biden is going to try to shake hands with a painting of Abe Lincoln after concluding some remarks on why his republican friends should allow hearings for his 78 year old supreme court nominee.
Alright, so we know that there will be a fundraiser the day of the announcement. So what’s Biden’s schedule looking like right now, which I know is subject to change? Is he clear tonight? Could it PLEASE be today? Anyway, #BidenHarris2020!
Wait a minute. Is Rob's dad Joe Biden? Would explain some things.
Trump: Voting for Biden will hurt God.   God: Come at me bro.
If Trump had said what Biden did say, can you deny it would have been on a continuous loop played all day/night long on CNN?
We don’t want Biden.... we just can’t suffer with  anymore. We’re literally dying a thousand a day. #DumpTrump2020
Why is that funny? No one said “Biden 2020” like the MAGA cult does all the fucking time. They said let black voters make their own decision my guy. Stop being so hateful.
It really says something about the Trump campaign that they look at images of Biden praying and think, “this looks like weakness, and it will play well with our base.”
Biden meant this:  Latinos are made up of Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Mexicans, El Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Columbians, Costa Ricans, etc  He meant nothing bad about black voters.
if people read up on Biden's history they would know that these aren't gaffes, he really means what he says and only regrets it when he gets a large amount of negative attention. Biden is disgraceful
Yes, I’m the stupid one. The one who knows that millions who voted for him in 2016 will not do so this time. The one who knows that millions more who chose not to vote for Clinton will for Biden.  Your Nazi tears on Nov 4 will be delicious.
Biden isn't worthy of anyone's vote!
BIDEN'S HAD SHITS BIGGER THAN GOD HE KILLS TIME WITH HIS BREATHE. THE KRAKEN IS A PIMP
COVID has given Biden an excuse to lie low. But he still has to pick a running-mate, accept his party's nomination, and handle the debates. Can he exhibit the mental capacity to cope with our current crises while debating Trump?  Patrick Buchanan writes:
Joe Biden Backtracks After Saying Black Communities Not As ‘Diverse’ As Latino Communities  via
Well now this is interesting...
This article puts it well-there are other options, but Harris has been the frontrunner all season for a reason-she’s by far the best candidate that Biden can choose considering her experience &amp; what voters are hoping for.
Trump's attempt to take advantage of Biden's remarks is laughable.  has to insult blacks about 5,000 more time to catch up with Trump. All the black gaffes do is guarantee Joe's running mate is a black woman.
Is Biden announcing today? About time. In a nonpandemic time, the Dem convention would have already happened, and we'd have known for weeks.
Exactly. You wanna look at politicians who made large contributions to the issues in our community look no further than Biden fam.  He's the one behind mass incarcerations.  Say what you want about Trump, voting for Biden is voting for our own mass incarcerations.
Joe should comment on Biden’s racist commentsz
And also that they can attack Biden for "being senile". There are tons of other things that are WAY more valid to attack Biden on. Plus Trump's insistence that the 1918 pandemic was in 1917 is just... Weird.
I don't support Trump please stop assuming I like that jackass.  Biden drafted the 94 crime bill which caused mass incarcerations of thousands of black men and did nothing to try and address it.  How much mass incarceration policy has Trump drafted to target black Americans?
Are we afraid of what the tRump camp might say about Rice? Biden will choose the best woman for VP....period!
It’s the same guy pleading Biden to skip any debates because “orange man bad”
NO, Joe Biden will NOT be your savior!
This is what happens when Biden speaks. That is why he won't debate.
What crazy shit will we see Biden do today? Get the popcorn.
You didn't answer the question.  Biden drafted mass incarceration policy which targeted black men and did nothing to fix it.  How much mass incarceration policy has Trump drafted?
He almost certainly has a lifelong learning disability impacting reading. (Similar Biden’s stutter.). The focus on his reading stumbles is dumb.
Biden is portrayed as a familiar face and reliable statesman in contrast with the volatile Trump. In reality, he promises to be the most liberal president in history, writes

Driving around my area I haven’t seen 1 Biden sign
Saw a house with a Biden sign and a BLM sign.   Read the damn room.   #denial
Joe Biden’s tweets are too coherent for him to have written himself. Ghostwriter.
It doesn't matter who the VP pick is, Republicans will dig up anything they can and if they can't find something they'll manufacture it.  Biden should pick the VP he wants and if he wants Susan Rice, so be it. It's his choice.
To blithely just recite that, just what happened, in that headline, somehow doesnt seem right.  Something more like "President resorts to absurd claims against Biden"
Biden drafted the 94 crime bill which caused thousands of black men to be mass incarcerated   How much mass incarceration policy has Trump drafted?
And Biden mass incarcerated thousands. Trump did it with mismanagement of a situation, Biden did his shit intentionally with legislature.  But by all means support the man behind mass incarcerations, some BLM ally you are.
I still am with  ! She is different enough from Biden and an intelligent, strong woman!
94 crime bill caused many mass incarcerations of black men.  Biden has been a legislator for 30 years since. Why didn't he do his job and draft legislature to address the mass incarcerations he caused?
Playing electoral defense, Trump claims Biden opposes God
A racist word has never left his lips to my knowledge and he already gets labeled along with his supporters. Biden apparently can say whatever he wants and get a free pass. Republicans have wrongly been accused of being the racist party when Dems are the real racists.
So glad you got it!!!!!! Thank you.

Why they've kept Biden out of public comment space for months.
I think that's why the whole biden is dumb argument doesn't work ...   Yo -semite Thigh-land  That's just the past two days ... lolol
I thought this campaign ‘didn’t consider Latinos important’ to their path to victory or whatever

Biden didn’t even write this tweet.
Two things are happening here. Neither is ok. Mr Biden is a vulnerable adult and being taken advantage of. Or he's doing this to stand out and get media coverage. MS Biden. Help your husband please. This is past the point of political. For God sakes.

Biden. He's lost so much in life. Wife and daughter is car accident. Two sons. He went into congress poor and came our poor.  He's what the country needs. A big hug.

That was Obama.  Sorry but you can't take a black mans work and credit Biden for it. I understand that's how this country was built but slavery ended in 1865 buddy.
Although I'm personally a black liberal, blacks come in all political ideologies, they don't have to vote for Biden, just like they don't have to vote for Trump.  They're entitled to Free Speech
I hope President Biden undoes the policies put in place by Senator Biden.    (Not kidding, I really hope he will undo some of them.)
I’m voting for Joe Biden this fall. I hope Trump loses.
I expect Trump to debate Biden.  He debated HIllary Clinton.
Biden's handlers will make excuses to get him out of any debates.  It's like a boxer who challenges the reigning champ suddenly getting a "training injury" a couple days before the fight.
Biden drafted the 94 crime bill which caused thousands of black men to be mass incarcerated   How much mass incarceration policy has Trump drafted?
Biden has been an elected official for almost 40 years. What meaningful legislature has he drafted besides mass incarceration policy.
Joe Biden is a racist.  Pass it on.
Good!!!  Biden is corrupt, has dementia, needs to debate Trump. Jim why don’t you ever report anything objectively? #Trump2020Landslide

This is your opinion. I think picking someone who isn't battle tested is unwise. I have read several pieces written by conservatives that are pro Rice. Maybe you aren't aware of Obama's relationship with Harris. I believe Obama will have a huge influence with Biden.
Yes, I do think Biden is racist. He's just less racist than Trump.
Joe Biden is off the helipad, he’s in the rocket, he’s reached low earth orbit, he’s ascending to a hyperbolic trajectory en route to Seoul, HE HAS ENTERED NORTH KOREA folks,
Joe Biden’s family should be ashamed for what they are putting a clearly sick man through. A really sad situation, no one has his best interests.
Amen, Phil. And just as importantly, Biden will restore honesty to the White House. And hopefully sychophants like Higgins and his lying GOP colleagues will all be voted out of office.
What i meant was i think trump doesnt need the debates. Biden making enough debate type gaffes without them. The karens may not care but i thinks blacks sure do as we see by the polls.

Lol biden dusnt write that tweet.
Richard Nixon seems like a progressive compared to what’s in the White House right now! I just want a Demo win. Whatever VP candidate can make that happen is my choice. I hope Biden’s campaign feels the same.
Lol Joe Biden said “y’all all niggas”  Fuck American democracy.
Biden is the man responsible for the 94 mass incarceration bill.  Look it up if you don't believe me.  Say what you want about Trump but at least he didn't draft legislature targeting our race for mass incarcerations.
Actually he is right on this one. Joe Biden needs to just stop talking.
He still has the legal right to do so. And honestly I don't blame him. After Bidens 94 crime bill and recent comments about black voters, fuck Biden.
Or possibly he has considered the outcome for people of color. I personally refuse to vote for Biden because of the 94 crime bill and his lack of effort to address the mass incarcerations he caused.  Trump's an idiot but at least he didn't draft black mass incarcerations.
Biden’s from Delaware b m. in PA) and Rice is from DC. That ticket doesn’t represent our country very well geographically.
This is their framing:  For Biden to win any of the debate, he must not make a single flub.  For Trump to win all the debates, he needs to "sound strong" *once.*
In a perfect world, you'd be right. But we dont get the option to joke about Biden being total garbage if we want to stand any chance of centrists and undecided voters voting for him. That's my take on this, idk.
him the whole night shutting down trumps rebuttals. The bar is so low for biden he could actually come out ok and then not debate again. In thar case it might help biden. Just a thought
So my new theory is are no debates really that bad? Biden is already saying dumber things by the day trump is using in ads. The polls are shifting away from biden and no debates will only hurt biden. I could see. Iden di one debate win cnn moderating and they would run cover for
Joe Biden looks like one of those super old white face golden retrievers who’s just barry hanging on.

Choosing to believe that centrists won't switch from Biden to Trump over his policies and outbursts is fucking pathetic! SEND TWEET!
Give it a rest Trump. You shouldn’t talk. All of your many crimes, yet you stole the election. Better watch your back when Biden gets elected. The courts are waiting for you.

Remember when Joe Biden humiliated Paul Ryan in a debate through sheer interruption and over talking alone?
Independents, U need to take a serious look at this candidate, Biden, who seems to constantly walk back what he says. I didn’t vote for Trump in 2016, &amp; I didn’t vote for Hillary either (but I voted). But this election is clear: it is TRUMP or the progressive left with crazy Joe.

Joe Biden can't help but expose who he truly is
I am a Democratic insider and I will tell you that he'll pick the least controversial VP that's palatable to moderate republicans (same reason Biden was picked by Obama). No one was especially familiar with Tim Kaine either. It's what democrats do.
The race without Biden, Bloomberg, Sanders, and Buttigieg, plus the half dozen miscellaneous reps and senators would have been very different, and much, much better.
, noon and night, by every media outlet, except rightwing media.   liberals and Democrats, all over the country would be ripping him up and down. let's just be real. Biden is so lucky Trump is so insanely awful, in every inconceivable way. All biden has to do is play dead!

Unlike the current occupant if the office, Biden understand the independence of the justice department.  the President has no place directing or commenting on their sctions.
If a senator thinks they’ll have a close relationship with Biden and he’s serious about being a bridge (I think he is) that definitely could make VP attractive.  I think Harris, Whitmer, Warren, or Gillibrand would be excellent choices.
Biden said the BLACK COMMUNITY isn't. That's the point.

There is no question that China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, Syria, ISIS, Al Qaeda and other U.S. enemies and adversaries are rooting for pushover #JoeBiden to win in this November’s presidential election.
He ordered federal agents to beat up and pepper spray priests and peaceful protestors so he could have a campaign photo op holding a Bible upside down outside a church that didn't want him there.  Now he thinks he has the "God" vote? Pathetic.
Never Trump =always Biden and whoever his VP is - soon to be leader of free world and largest economy in the world.  It’s just that simple.
A voter who says "I hate Trump but, gee, Biden makes these gaffes, so I guess I'll have to vote for Trump" is a fantasy that lives only in the minds of some in the media and pundits desperate to talk about something other than Trump.
Biden is portrayed as a familiar face and reliable statesman in contrast with the volatile Trump. In reality, he promises to be the most liberal president in history, writes   via
Joe Biden is bringing back the old timer version of the Democrats that are racist, pro-slavery, pro-segregation and fought in the Civil War to keep things that way.
This dude 👇🏽have been working tirelessly to not support Biden. Which is fine is that your thing. But don’t hate in Kanye then if he is basically doing the same thing with money. Don’t  me - fuck Kanye.
No. No conditions. No escape clauses. Compromise. Deal. Biden gets to do what he wants, at least in one term.
Too late. He’s been a racist for decades. He showed us who he is a long time ago.
Yeah, I unfollowed her a long time ago when she started calling Biden a rapist.
Have to retweet just because the Right gets its jollies from Biden gaffes
Maybe he should go to Thigh land.  What kind of moron continues to try to say Biden is some kind of gaffe machine when Trump is just walking around with his pants around his ankles every day?
You’ve actively listened to trump for the past 4 years and are at a loss at what comes out of BIDEN’S mouth??
I think you described Trump but used a few quotes from Biden which you didn’t understand the meaning of. I’m glad that the majority of Americans are able to reason better than you.
she seems to be the only former candidate who comprehends the real shituaTION..  Cory booker seems to get whats happening and who is really the bad guy, If Biden picks her as VP vote for Them...
Biden: I want to clarify something I said earlier by saying something completely new right now
But he'll wait until Jan 19th after passing as many un-American executive orders as possible in the previous 3 months. Biden will spend the next year undoing it all.
Joe Crow Biden you're racist, how many times you do have to apologise for being racist. We know your past.
People panicking over Biden being perceived as a lefty are forgetting 2016 and reverting to a mindless DC tic where “extremism” is the only sin. But Clinton didn’t lose because she was seen as top left-wing, she lost because the left never trusted her. And Trump exploited that.
Here’s the thing: WARREN AND WARREN ALONE helps Biden avoid this accusation. All the other VP contenders leave Biden wide open to accusations of being yet another Clintonite neoliberal.  (Biden himself is clearly aware of this, tacking left since getting the nomination!)
Biden's out to lunch, gone!
On the other hand, there’s an attack that HAS worked for Trump, in 2016, that Biden is obviously vulnerable to: that Democrats are hopelessly compromised neoliberal globalists, in hock to Wall Street. This works because progressives feel dispirited about both sides and stay home.
There was Pecos Bill, there was John Henry, there was Paul Bunyan, there was Joe Biden... He gave God a buddy shoulder-hug and broke his collarbone!
Biden is a clown 🤡
Any of Joe Biden's. Take your pick.
Is Warren an easier target for Trump? Sure, he’ll accuse the ticket of being lefty, but he’s doing that already and it doesn’t work. “Left-wing” isnt intrinsically terrifying to voters these days - it’s not 1984 - and besides, Biden is a known quantity.
“They are trying to catch Biden, he escaped the old folks home.”

When people hear Biden try to speak an entire sentence nobody will vote for him ... That's why the Biden support group don't want debates.
Biden is Catholic. That's like having a subscription to God+
Biden campaign responds to Trump's 'hurt God' attack: 'Biden's faith is at the core of who he is' - CNNPolitics
that’s just not reality. I’m sorry, but you gotta look beyond your media and social bubble and view exterior evidence. Look into Biden’s actual policy and judge it for yourself. Look into how actual socialists hate him for his middling approach. He’s not who you portray him as.
A couple of things.  I’ll admit, the original statement from Shithead never warranted a response, but Biden could have been directly asked.  In fact, the original statement only pandered to Shithead’s base; it won’t change the mind of undecided voters.
so  ran a story on  not voting for Biden. Just bc she won't vote for Trump, doesn't mean she would vote for Biden, despite her father's friendship with him. Their political ideologies are different, so of course she would write someone in or something.
Joe Biden is going to punch God right in the fucking face. Down he'll go, like Liston.
NBC has a reporter following 7 trump voters in Kent county Michigan, Detroit suburbs, I believe.   4 are voting for Biden, 3 aren't sure but one of the 3 said she couldn't stand the shape the country is in right now.
Exactly! President Obama &amp; First Lady Michelle  would’ve detected if Joe Biden was racist  all the time they spent together. I don’t believe he is
BBC News - US election 2020: Trump says opponent Biden will 'hurt God'    JP: God doesn't need Trump to defend Him or His Word
This attempt by GOP operatives to get Kanye on the ballot to dilute the Biden vote is so reprehensible on 2 counts. It smacks of demeaning, racist assumptions about Black voters, &amp; manipulates &amp; exploits a person who is in the midst of a recently disclosed mental health crisis.
I hope everyone realizes that the reason there is so much interest around Biden’s VP pick is that he universally is disliked. And people just want something good to cling to. And this is the guy who is going up against Trump is one of the most important elections ever.
Biden as President?
The Biden campaign should hire you
Biden is against GOD now? I bet he knows a scripture from the Bible, unlike Orange Face, gets more insane everyday.
If he follows through on this, I will be VERY curious/anxious to see who makes the shortlist for AG (assuming a Biden victory).
If you're too pure to vote for Biden, then stay the hell home and don't vote for Trump.
And if only she wanted to be Biden’s VP.
When VPs do get policy roles, it’s stuff that’s of personal interest to them—like Biden and cancer research—or cross governmental—like Gore and reinventing government.  A VP isn’t going to have a broad policy portfolio, especially if it overlaps with Cabinet responsibilities.
Another, and again a Biden role, as well as a Gore role, is sounding board.  Ideally any VP would serve this role and have that relationship with the president.
One role, and that Biden himself served, is as a kind of ombudsman—make sure the ARRA oversight is doing its job, handhold senators who aren’t getting the attention they want, be the sober cab at the Beer Summit
Walter, I think we just need to pray that the Holy Spirit comes running out from backstage and tags into that fight so that Mr. Biden won’t have an upper hand against all three.
Has Biden used cocaine? There might be a good reason he used that reference.
Thankfully it's my vote and not yours. I hope Biden's everything you hope for if he wins.
If you still have any respect for Cupp....  UPDATE....ya shouldn't.   If a pundit like her needs any reason to vote for Biden other than the other option is this dangerous madness they are a joke.
Agree, I think it will get a lot closer towards November. Plus, Biden needs a wide margin to combat the Trump corruption.
Trump is already putting American workers first.😃 Biden says he will sell us out to China again.😠
I'm voting for Biden, too, but this is tacit admission things are hopeless. Which I guess is fine for you, me,  and Caitlin.
Still can’t believe that Biden needs another few days to announce his vp when he has been given an enormous amount of extra time due to corona since he hasn’t been traveling and such. Like what did he do with that extra time????
He. Just. Cant. Stop. Saying. Stupid. Shit (and this time I don't mean Trump).  Get yer ass back to the basement!! For the love of god.  #biden #gaffemachine
I dont give a fuck about your takes Biden sucks but Trump is a full fledged fascist dictator. Let's focus people.
These are the rantings of a spiteful old man, whose brain has rotted away from his high fat, low exercise and Sudafed/Cocaine/Meth abusing lifestyle. He can only verbalize his emotions in simple ways like a caveman grunting out words. Fire bad! Biden Hate!
Trump is lying about Joe Biden. Lying remains a sin. It needs to be repudiated by Church leaders in the USA.
Because they are pumping in imaginary money to shore it up long enough for a Democrat to get into office, then they will pull the plug and blame Biden for "tanking the market"  leaving him in a bigger mess. This is all while they use insider trading to build their own personal $$
Biden gets it. Go for God’s knees.
Imagine being such a worthless candidate that even you can't stand in front of this idiot and a second term.  And, yet, we have Joe Biden, an even worse alternative.
Without COVID, Biden would be a cracker to eat dog food on.  Even Trump's ineptitude and callousness in handling anti-racist unrest wouldn't help Biden if that was all that was going on.
John McCain, defended the character of Barack Obama when a woman called him an Arab. I guarantee if John was living in this hell, he'd be campaigning 4 Joe Biden. I know that as a certainty as much as I know u will still tout ur daddy's good name as part of ur own credentials.
"No candidate better exemplifies Washington's charge than Biden. His story of triumph and tragedy is well-known. Biden never lost his Catholic faith. When his son, Beau, was dying of cancer, Joe and Jill Biden showed up at Mass at my church."

I wonder what his old buddy “Barry” thinks I these comments man Biden is a racist pos dementia or not who says shit like this
Trump cult members surely drink this up, however crudely worded. God is on our side, so by implication, who is for that anti-life Catholic Biden? Trump: "No religion, no anything, hurt the bible, hurt God. He's against God. He's against guns. He's against energy..."
So.... He's killed it with promises made, promises kept. Besides, your criticize Trump on his anunciation when Biden can't remember what office he's running for
Kanye isn’t going to take a single vote from Joe Biden.
His team is exactly the right answer. Biden isn’t some knight in shining armor, no matter how much some people want that. But he’s great at building a team and putting that team to work.
If he becomes President, I won't celebrate. Will prob go to a DSA meeting and talk to comrades about how to fight 4 yrs of neoliberalism under Biden. We would need to protest Biden more than Trump because neoliberalism is sneaky &amp; less obvious than the fascism we are seeing now.
There are a lot of factors that go into success in a primary, and it’s difficult to separate those factors out.  Without Biden, who would have led in SC?  Will Harris’s record as a prosecutor, which arguably hurt her in the primary, help in the general?
I believe  about his faith which is why I find it so odd that #prochoice folx are ready to accept his flip-flop on abortion.
I'm fine with Republicans complaining about Biden, they can get in line.
Idk I would call them contenders as most. I agree red or blue is stupid there should be more choices but in November we unfortunately gotta vote Biden.
Let’s be honest, this makes Biden sound 100% cooler than he actually is.
Can you imagine if you put Trump instead of Biden in this picture? Holy shit!! Fucking riots. 1/2 this population gets their information filtered by the Democrat media. It’s incredible the Republicans let them get away with this!
Trump should start a draft and watch Antifa and Biden voters run to Canada
No. Vote for Biden or re-elect Trump. Get a fucking clue.

Dude, Biden can’t remove an Amendment from the Constitution. The 2nd isn’t going anywhere. Stop trying to scare people and maybe focus on something more important like the pandemic and unemployment. #TrumpIsALaughingStock #TrumpIsLosing #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #TrumpIsAFailure
If nothing else Biden wants Florida in play  and regardless of what context she said it in or what she says now her previous comments about Cuba and Castro will sink any chances in Florida
He is one desperate man. Waiting for him to say Biden is the devil and that he can walk on water
Shouldn't you be paying your child support instead of fretting over Joe Biden who's mental acuity as far superior to Donald Trump's
It really is strange, given what we’re up against as a nation, that the question of governance has been fully omitted from the VP horse race coverage. Not only is it arguably the most important factor, it’s what Biden says he’s focusing on!
Mr. “Two Corinthians" paid off a porn star while married to his third wife and it’s Biden who's against God? Biden has always been a man of faith. A strong and devoted Catholic. He doesn’t need to hold a bible up in front of a church for a photo op to prove that.
He ssys Biden "is going to hurt God" and he wants 4 debates? Do Trumpets not see he is becoming unhinged???
There are hundreds of articles on Trump. Settle down.  If you don’t think what Biden said is concerning then it says a lot about you too.
Biden Campaign Cancels Trip Upstairs | The Babylon Bee
Don’t use the lord’s name in vain. That hurts God like Biden does...
Putin still has 90 days believe nothing the media says about Biden's lead. Vote as if your life depends on it REGARDLESS  Because this foremost needs to be a win Needs to be blow out in epic fashion Vote BLUE UP AND DOWN EVERY TICKET Give America the second chance we all deserve
Biden sucks. As of now, I'm probably voting for Trump.
If Biden doesn’t debate he is exhibiting reason he should not be elected - a leader isn’t afraid of a debate stage and America doesn’t need a fearful president.
I agree with the fact that their should be better education. And I totally agree two parties really suck and that more choices should be available. The fact is tho we are in America and no 3rd party candidate will win so we have to vote Biden, otherwise it’s a vote for Trump
You think Trump’s bad, wait until you hear Biden try and speak.
Biden up by 4. How is this possible?? The MEDIA. They will do anything to WIN.  You have to get your team on enemy turf. Go on MSNBC CNN and obliterate them. Finish them.
Biden is a very, very moderate Democrat. As a progressive, I can promise you he’s not a socialist at all, and it’s unfair to disregard his policy and generalize him with truly brutal dictators who hid under the name of communism
And there you have it: the full case for why Warren is pretty obviously the superior VP choice.   Obviously there's room to disagree, but for the most part, arguments I've seen in the media have been a lot less structured, even slapdash. I hope Biden is being more methodical.
between biden &amp; trump america is fucked
Finally, I'd add, right now there's a lot of ferment in the country over police reform specifically. The left of the party, already skeptical of Biden, is very keyed into the issue. Picking a former prosecutor is high-risk: it could be interpreted as an attack on these skeptics.
Prez admits I will send fed inspectors to each bridge no more victims offed  by lack of maint.  Elect Biden will raise taxes 77.25 %. To tear down bridges and seek more beavers.
It’s not how you vote, it’s the reality of it. A vote for anything but Biden is a vote for Trump
But ultimately, Warren probably has a bit of an edge here too: her popularity is focused among progressives and the young, where the most Biden-skeptical voters are. Harris tends to appeal to older and more moderate groups that already like Biden - people whose votes are secure.
Take it with a grain of salt, but, well, that's a decent poll for Biden... MN is +18 (!) points.
Biden is against rainbows and will hurt unicorns.
Finally, there's the effect of the VP on the election itself. This is by far the least important consideration, because: A. Biden is already way ahead B. Study after study shows that VPs don't really matter to swing voters.  (So of course, it's all pundits want to talk about.)
That gives Biden more room to work when leading an ideologically diverse party. It reassures progressives their voices are being heard and their perspectives considered, EVEN IF (as I'd expect) they don't win every argument. It's classic coalition building. No one else does this.
Biden cheers abortions. That’s super catholic of him.
So you’re saying everyone can be forgiven? Does that include Biden?
There’s a pageant-like feeling to this process. In Biden’s frame of mind he’s got it made- he’s the person to join, and he has all these women who want to boost him. Except that narrative has been driven by Biden’s camp and historical precedence.
Then, there's politics. Remember, the world doesn't end on Nov. 4. Biden will need to guide a party with major internal divisions through a harrowing period of reform and reconstruction - assuming he can end the crises in the first place.
Wow if this is possible, then I guess Biden is more powerful than we thought!
Warren isn't on the ticket because Сharlie Baker would appoint her replacement and Biden's not dumb enough  to introduce that as a variable when the majority party in the Senate is probably coming back at 50-51 seats. If it's 51 Dems, maaaaybe she gets a cabinet appointment.
On governance, the question is "Who is most likely to help Biden address the many cataclysms the US currently faces?" And here I think it's hard to argue anyone is in the same universe as Warren. She's the Democrats' most prolific, creative policy thinker.
You are right Dan.....Joe Biden’s phonier than 3$ bill
Really…it’s really going to come down to the VP pick?   Tell me this, S.E. would you vote for Pence over Biden? If yes, then sit down and be a terribly conflicted Republican who dislikes Trump’s tone, but values Party over Country.   You get to vote again in four years.
Worried about you-- says that Biden is going to hurt you. Please mark yourself safe!
I've never seen Joe Biden punch God. But one night many years ago I did see him beat Jesus at cribbage, so maybe that's what he was talking about...?
Been on the phone with my youth pastor Garamond having him talk me down. I swear, if Joe Biden beats up God, God's son Jesus and God's wife The Holy Spirit, I'll write in Jill Stein for president. Sick of this! C'mon, Joe!
That's why I don't get people on both the left and the center-right who say "well maybe Biden if he does (list of my policy preferences)." My first question when choosing a candidate is "are you a garbage person?" And I've used that to rule out Republicans AND Democrats alike.
My neighborhood in Minneapolis *apparently* went for Biden in the primary, even though the neighborhood is filled with Bernie signs and I've NEVER seen a Biden sign
"Badly needs" this is what people are getting wrong about the Veepstakes: Biden is winning, what he badly needs to do is not upset the applecart by picking someone who hasn't been through the media wringer of running for pres (like Abrams or Bass) in that sense Harris is fine.
So after everything Trump is done over $150,000 dead we're losing our global supremacy as China rises  Whether or not you'll vote for Biden comes down to his VP pick  You are part of the problem
Your weaseling claims are all based on stoking up fear. Biden will not take any guns, hes forgot more about the Bible than you have ever known, and he has empathy and compassion for the downtrodden. Words you are totally unfamiliar with. You’ll find words like that in the Bible.
if you vote for anyone other than joe biden you’re voting for this fat loser❤️
I thought this was the one who doesn't say stupid things.
I think Harris is basically a wash electorally - VPs generally don't matter, but she does alienate the people who are most skeptical of Biden. By the same token she's bad politically - she won't help bring progressives on board and will be seen as a snub by them.
I think you can argue about who is the best for Biden electorally (i.e., until Nov. 4), politically after Nov. 4 in terms of keeping the party united and on task, and who has the strongest governance and policy chops.
Actually if he has that kind of power wouldn’t be prudent to not provoke him? At least Biden has enough compassion to not just smite the fool.
Biden is a fake Catholic. He supports abortion completely.
Headline in the NY Post tomorrow. BIDEN KILLS GOD! ALL HOPE GONE!
Jill Biden is: * an educator  * a doctor * not a mail-order bride   Should I keep going?
45 knows how dumb the people are who follow him so all he has to say is “Biden is against god” and his sheep automatically think “45 is for god” 😭😂 I cannot with the ignorant!!!
Unbelievably tone deaf. Don't think this is some special kind of Biden goof-em-up. He's always been like this. Always.
Just make sure you don't jump ship when Biden destroys this country. I want you to be the first to go down with it
We need Biden signs.  I can probably give out at least 30 in my little precinct in Eagan.
I opened twitter to scroll a bit 3 separate times today and each time there was a new Biden gaffe.... I’m so done
I don't think I've seen you guys comment on a single one of Biden's gaffes......hypocrites.
He has to pick the one he thinks he can work the best with. He and Obama were a great working team. Biden deserves the same.
The Only Cognitive Test Biden Needs to Take: Debate Trump  via
Joe Biden: "most people don't know, unlike the African American community with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community, with incredibly different attitudes about different things"
So just like you do in your coverage of Biden cnn?
I understand that those are the key reasons that Bernie doesn’t appeal to older white moderates but they’ve deliberately ignored every red flag of Biden’s to a level that borders on delusion. This man is horrible at speaking and shows symptoms of dementia
He's telling us so we know how desperate Trump is to win including helping West take away votes from Biden. #CrookedTrump
I've seen your change.  My neighborhood was on fire a few months back.  I'll vote for Biden and be glad to do it. You can roast me as much as you want for that.
No, you have to vote for Biden regardless. Otherwise you’re helping Trump.

When I hear the cable pundits, who weren't on Joe Biden's side when these primaries started, now say such glowing things about him, I just shout "I told you so!"  He IS the perfect candidate for this election and lot of us knew that. #deadlinewhitehouse
I feel you. Fuck. I dunno. I guess which secret police do we want to fight against in 2021? I guess Biden’s secret police??? this place sucks 😫

Biden hates god. Really? trumpie's really reaching for the most far flung excuses.
Biden looks like a wounded animal. The wolves are hungary.
He did it on purpose to divide the Dem vote so it was easier for Biden to slide in there. He had no intention of winning he just stirred the pot up a little
“My Statement on the 55th Anniversary of the Voting Rights Act” by Joe Biden
President Donald Trump used his trip to Ohio to make a deeply personal attack on Joe Biden: "He's against God. He's against guns. He's against energy, our kind of energy. I don't think he's going to do too well in Ohio," Trump said.
Trump believes he is God  Biden beating Trump would hurt Trump  Therefore, Biden would hurt God
*Also, I'm waiting for the Joe Biden vs. God memes to start coming out. I need a good belly laugh. And if Biden actually *did* bust out some top-secret ninja move no one knew about and made it to round-2 before being vaporized... omg. Superbowl commercial.
Just saying  get Biden real plumbing your boy  might took it all by proxy.
"It’s these guys, with their habits and histories that have never really been held against them, and the fact that they are still somehow the ones weighing women’s political and personal value as the fate of the nation hangs in the balance." 🔥
Biden doesn't have to do anything  When your opponent, like Trump, is busy hitting himself in the balls you just stand aside and let him continue.
This is a very good point. And why Joe Biden is a stronger candidate in this election than many of us give him credit for. The attacks fall flat.
Biden associates giving him sniff of lavender so he goes back to sleep.
Hostility? What planet have you been living in? Under Trump there has been more economic gain for blacks than at any other time in our history. Biden isn’t ignorant he has dementia
Only rumor from women of villiage. Biden smashed his potty chair screaming it stinks.
well shit, now i have to vote for biden
Biden's Antifa handlers will close it down soon enough
Found something Biden may be able to defeat in a debate. 🤣
Obama will always be an icon for being the first black president, but he wasn’t a good president if we are being honest. Trump is so bad it makes people forget. I don’t trust Biden or any of his corporate democrat buddies
Both pieces are absolutely worth a read. And very depressing. I have been feeling the same way for weeks. Badly mishandled by Biden camp.
I disagree.  I feel the swell towards Biden was authentic, and unexpected.  All the usual forces had assumed he was washed up (and seemed to like it that way) before he surged.
LBJ and the Great Society. Need I say more. I'm sorry but all this bickering that the Dems are for minorities and Republicans are against it is hogwash. Demz are no more for Minorities than they are for votes. And I'm not voting for Trump. Though Biden isn't really any better.

Good point, Biden should only select a VP who beat him in the primary.    Really, candidates have a bunch of different strengths, and having some that let you win doesn’t mean that others don’t have strengths you want on your side.

If a God can be hurt by Joe Biden, is he really a God?
JOE BIDEN: “Unlike the African-American community, the Latino community is a incredibly diverse community"  How come the media doesn’t say Biden is a racist?   The same man who said “vote for me or you ain’t black”
Yeah maybe. Will he listen to those people? We will see. I’m voting for Biden, but I’m not happy bout it lol
You'd prefer a man who clearly takes pleasure in his own cruelty?  You don't have to like Biden.  But I'm glad we chose a moderate.  It makes a point, however imperfect.
It's okay, when Biden comes for his guns, Trump can escape to Thighland. 😂
Trump. No?  Biden?
When I hear people say things like “he’s senile, I can’t vote for him” I can’t help but think they’re talking about  but apparently people think this about Biden?
I say the same thing.  I also said the same thing with Bernie.  Bernie has been a legislator for almost as long as Biden. He's another one of the elected officials who does do Jackshit.
Has Biden clarified whether he is against God?
Oh No, Is Joe Biden Going To Spank The Lord Right On The Bottom?!
...and once Biden decides on his V.P., who will most likely be a WOC, watch the enthusiasm runneth over!
OTOH the GOP has gone all-in on Biden having cognitive issues.  If Biden clearly exceeds expectations (very coherent, not gaffe-less), it really sinks their boat.  I would think they would ask--why didnt we know this?
But they were all of them deceived, for another ring was made: in the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom, the dark lord Sauron forged, in secret, a master ring to control all others.  And apparently Joe Biden wears it? This guy...
hey Pete, Biden wants to get rid the 2nd amendment?  He is a gun owner right now. Has Trump ever been a fun owner?
I’m tired of Chris W. He’s always looking to say something negative about the President. What would our world look like under Biden &amp; Co? The fact that Biden is leading shows how the media has hated on him for 4 yrs. CW be part of the solution not the problem. A lot is at stake.
So he’s saying Biden is the true god cuz otherwise god can’t be hurt ?!?!  BrahminBiden 🤷🏽‍♂️
This makes Biden sound like a JRPG protag.
Biden has been refused Holy communion.   Biden has a complicated history with the Catholic Church. ... Morey said he denied Biden Communion because of the candidate's political ... has been barred from receiving Communion over his radical stance on abortion rights.

Not for anything?! Is Joe Biden a nihilist?!
Biden supports abortion. He is not a "devout Catholic".
Fox is really going down hill. I heard Trump beat him in fund raising for July, but you don't hear anything about that. I had to hear that from another source. Fox is probably  giving Biden additional advertising discounts over Trump as well.
#China is hoping #Biden wins because they can then do whatever they want and walk all over the US because Biden is owned by them. #Election2020
Bautista was a Progressive Catholic. Biden reminds me of the feckless progressive, who turned over Cuba to an Authoritarian Communist Regime.
Without even considering the possibility that there's real fraud at the top of the NRA, he's all in - and will likely end having to defend/dismiss LaPierre's misconduct/fraud creating more Biden ammunition on condoning corruption
I bet Biden wouldn't hold it upside down.
🙄 Yep... crime bill, establishment moderate-Democrat Biden is going to steal your guns. 🤣 And devout Catholic Biden is going to come between you and God.  Sure, Cheeto Trump. 😏
Funny, "oof" is often what I say when listening to Biden talk.
Team Trump's so hard up for something -ANYTHING- to attack Biden. They keep photoshopping real pics &amp; use them to lie.  But they're so dumb they nearly always get caught.  Like THIS time they pretended a photo was from Delaware. But Iowa guy - whose house it was in - caught them:
if this is true (unclear) i will be pledging my vote for joseph clancy biden in this years election
If you believe in the traditional, Christian, omnipotent God, I can confidently tell you that nothing Joe Biden is capable of will hurt it.  Or, if he can, you should probably pledge your allegiance because DAMN.
According to DHS, there are 9million legal permanent residents in the US that cannot vote.If  wants to give voting rights to illegal immigrants, maybe  should allow residents to vote. See how it plays out.
No Dem has taken away a gun, bullet, rights, ever. BIDEN has never said he would take away your guns.   they said OBAMA was going to take your guns too. Republicans especially trumpthug are desperate
Joe prefers belittling blacks as often as possible. "What you all know, but most people don't know, unlike the African American community with notable exceptions, the Latino community is incredibly diverse, with incredibly different attitudes about different things." -Joe Biden

So I’m no longer a Catholic. But when I was - if someone said this about me - I would have erupted in a rage. Biden is a life long Catholic and a decent man and there is depth to Trump’s depravity.
If I had to guess, I would say Biden picks:  1. Whitmer 2. Harris 3. Rice 4. Meghan McCain, or 5. The resurrected body of Strom Thurmond
Man Biden is going to be must watch TV for the Gaffes alone!
I'm glad MSNBC did a fact check on Biden's degree of God-againstness whilst also neglecting to report this
Trump still has the votes of the gullible and easily conned - they’re incredibly low hanging fruit for a guy like him.  I’ll give you that.    The rest of America plans to vote for Biden.
During the debate Trump is going to say something about Biden's gaffes. Biden is going to say he's had a stutter since he was a little kid, and ask what Trump's excuse is. Trump is going to storm off stage.
Then we should elect Biden immediately. If he's stronger than a god, surely he can banish a pandemic, right? 😉
Cheeto baby jesus is saying everything that he is, just substituted Joe Biden for his own name.
Biden is in a real pickle. Even though he is hidden his numbers are dropping and he is saying incredibly stupid things daily now. His run out the clock strategy is failing. They usually do
Trump: Biden will “hurt God”  Also Trump: Allow me to sign your copy of Playboy of which I am the feature
Then it’s a good thing Biden agrees with you.  “but he wouldn't stand in the way of a future Justice Department pursuing criminal charges against President Trump.”
They are all bad choices, however, one of them is notably worse than all the others. I hate this. I hated it when people went all Anti-Bush for political reasons, but I think this time is different. Biden (and the rest) are a bad choice, but Trump is a colossally bad choice.
As I said on another tweet..."hurt God"?  What? Does Joe Biden own a Hattori Hanzō sword or something?
Here’s one from July. The difference is much smaller than your other polls suggest. And when Biden, Sanders and Trump are polled together, Biden is ahead of Sanders, which seems important.
By not thinking about Biden for literally weeks at a time
My sentiments exactly. Can't fix anything until we put a pause on the downward spiral were being dragged through.   This is the part that makes me so frustrated to see libs/progs push so much anti Biden/anti left stuff...like we can totally deal with that starting 1pm on 1-20-21
Did he just claim Biden is strong enough to hurt God?
Sure.  If we could trust a Clinton guy, maybe we would listen.  Meanwhile Joe Biden is on tv saying that the whole Black community is one unit with no diversity at all, only a couple notable exceptions.  If you don't vote Joek, you aint black.
I've seen 1 Biden sign and an Any Adult 2020 sign in EP.

I am voting for him because he says Biden hates God and the Bible.
If Joe Biden can hurt God then he can probably will COVID-19 away using mind powers so he definitely has my vote.
I honestly don't listen to anything he says...because him, Trump, and Bernie are like 3 versions of the same person and I can't with the ancient white man bullshit.   I'm just hoping Biden picks a VP that's decent and then resigns or something so she can be president. 🤞
Trump Attacks on Biden:  ❌Flags didn't work ❌Statues didn't work ❌Defunding the police didn't work 😂Questioning mental fitness is self-parody ❓So now Biden wants to kill religion  The attacks are becoming less tangible and more desperate by the day.
I worked for Bernie's campaign and i am a Democratic socialist, but I can see past my privilege to know what 4 more years of Trump will do to us.  I don't like Biden, but we have 2 choices, and Biden will bring a respectable cabinet and jurors with him. We need that.
"God is dead"  -Joe Biden, probably
Biden better be careful. If he hurts God, Joe’s gonna have to answer to #CrossfitJesus
Bible, guns, god. Biden bad. Vote for me.
This is exactly right. It's not Biden's job to put Trump in jail, and it's not his job to keep him out of jail.
I doubt it - you shredded Reagan, both Bushes, Romney, etc. I’ll vote Biden to get the psycho out of the White House, but I have no illusions about what Dems would say about any good GOP President/candidate.
I didn't get my candidate either, but I'm damn sure voting Biden. A 3rd party vote won't "show" the DNC, and it won't be "their fucking problem". It's a vote for Trump; that will be all our problem. 4 more yrs of chaos, suffering is NOT a better choice than Biden.
This makes me want to vote for Biden more
So apparently Joe Biden is going to beat up God
Biden accused a reporter of being a cocaine junky yesterday. Stuff's getting crazy.
Trump claims Joe Biden will "hurt God" if elected president   🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. This is your leader 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡pos
I hate Biden but I'm still going to vote for him. Why? Because its going to be biden or trump and I for one don't want another 4 years of that walking shitstain destroying this country.  Also keep in mind its not just biden we are voting for -c-
Biden will be destroying God shortly so the fireballs from the sky during armageddon should do the trick
Why Won’t Democrats Just Come Out for Legalizing Marijuana? via
People need to stop posting things about the shitty stuff Biden has said or done. Yes, we get it, he is not great by any means but crap like that is going to convince people to just not vote and every single vote not for Biden is one less trump needs to worry about.
🤦‍♀️seriously? Biden is this best the Democrats have?
I drove to Yellowstone thru Montana, back thru Wyoming, saw hundreds of trump signs, 1 - Biden sign. 3,000 miles. Mighta missed a couple but..,
OMG Biden is just the WORST most AWFUL Democrat they could have fronted!   So... what do you suggest anyone do about this? You know, solid, concrete, act-on-em suggestions.
Then you don't really want to vote for Biden. A more truthful headline would be: holding your vote hostage unless Biden picks a VP you like.
Joe Biden is going to..."hurt the Bible?" Huh? He's just throwing scary words out there now. Biden eats children, vote for me!
They’re not really calling for the removal of election debates though; they’re calling for the removal of 2020 debates so Biden doesn’t have to speak in public.  They’ll be pro debates again if the 2024  candidate is cognizant.
Biden is definitely the radical left
Good platform for Biden imo
Someone should remind him of that pic of Joe Biden in a church, praying, that his campaign doctored.
Apparently Biden is “against God.” Is that, like, a policy position?
Robert Francis who pretended to be a Hispanic is Biden's gun-confiscation czar. #Election2020
Smart voters will say "Great! One less worry for President Biden come January 21st."  However, like the famous Adlai Stevenson quote, I'd prefer to have a majority of voters, not just the sm......never mind.
But heads up to the left, this is what they're going to do to Biden and a Democratic Congress. They're going to throw accusations as if they weren't guilty of far worse for 4 years. Don't have a short memory. But that doesn't mean President Biden shouldn't be held accountable.
Bernie is now Biden's economic czar. #Election2020
Was Biden's comment wrong? Yup. But it's laughable to watch Republicans try to act like an interview slip is the same thing as 4 years of ongoing evil from Trump. "Gotcha" only works if one side isn't basically Satan.
45 attacking Biden re religion is certainly a choice.  I just . . . cannot fathom . . . this reality.
yeah kinda funny - all Trumps ads misuse Biden photos where he's actually PRAYING. I've never seen this clown bow his head in prayer.  Yet I still know some evangelicals that think there was a prophecy  saying Trump was called by God to the WH.  Not by MY God that's for sure...
Lol wtf?????? Maybe this is why he won't disclose his favorite bible verses, he's sharpied "Joe Biden will Hurt God" all over it. Or was that The Art of the Deal? Not sure he knows the difference
Dem-aligned poll has Biden +18 in Minnesota. That’s now an outlier on the otherside to balance out that +3 from MC. Doesn’t really change my prior that Biden is probabily in thr +8-10 range right now in MN. Regardless, great to see as much data as possible for Minnesota!
If you vote for Biden, then you are truly a fake.. stop pretending. 🙄
Ahh yes, devout Catholic Joe Biden
What was their last national poll on that one?  Wasn’t it like Biden +20-something?  If so, this wouldn’t really shock me.
I’m a proud gun owner who refuses to vote for you.  We own guns to protect us from a tyrannical government.  I’m sure Biden would do no worse than your Portland stunt.  If he does, that’s why we have a second amendment.
The kind of dictatorship Trump wants can't exist with a heavily-armed citizenry.  Trump is far more likely to take your guns than Joe Biden, who understands and respects the constitution enough to preserve your 2A rights!  Trump will only trample those rights further.
"hurt God"?  Does Joe Biden have a Hattori Hanzō sword or something? #TrumpIsALaughingStock #TrumpVirus2020
"hurt God"?  Does Joe Biden have a Hattori Hanzō sword or something?
Because it’s contextual doesn’t make it accurate nor beyond reproach. Joe Biden has been nothing short of contemptuous towards African-Americans so I will critique him the way he has fashioned his policies and career towards us: as an enemy. Hopefully that clarifies things.
...his son Hunter Biden.
your thoughts after posting a similar Biden video today? Let's be honest, neither one is a good idea.
I doubt that God is worried about Joe Biden hurting him.
Biden’s running mate is critical AF, because he’ll need to step down... and they will need to take the reins.

Biden's gaffes aren't serious.  Who cares
While online spaces are probably what I have to thank to not be Stanning Biden or disengaging from politics completely, these spaces feel at best like echo chambers that skew my perceptions of offline space, and at worst, energy-sinks for infighting and Takes ad nauseumHi country is seeing a prime example under Biden

Did anyone really expect this pedophile to show up? He can't go anywhere as the dems need to keep an eye on him. Biden is a very sick man
Joe Biden is listening to extremist left I will bankrupt this country and turn it into another Venezuela
My favorite line from the piece: “This, by the way, isn’t written out of any concern that Donald Trump will prevail over Joe Biden in the debates; Mr. Biden has done just fine in a long string of such contests.” Sure.
And you can say the same thing about Biden. We got some great choices for President
If sleepy Joe Biden won the election we would lose America we will become like Venezuela
I find it extremely hard to believe that Biden was ever actually in the lead.
Can Biden go ahead and pick Bernie as his running mate so I feel better about voting for him?
In a way, isn't Joe Biden a lot like Bill Clinton? They both love young sex.
Yeah I doubt Biden’s vp will look at home like that
Nothing illegal happened there. Shokin wasn’t looking into Hunter Biden OR Burisma at the time Joe made that demand.  Also, Congress was briefed at the time, and the move was backed by all our allies. Even GOP Senators like Ron Johnson knew Shokin’s office had a corruption issue.
Biden didn’t do corrupt things. It was a political smear. You don’t just get to ask another country to investigate a political opponent for corruption just in case it’s there. You need cause to do so.
Joe Biden has proposed tax increases of more than $3 trillion over a decade. Here’s a look at the unfine print.  via  #kbrs and even after that the deficit will rise because his spending plan is more than $3T.
Progressive/Socialism-100% Absolutely the plan! “Team Biden” would, under the 25th amendment, declare “Dementia” Joe unfit to lead and POOF, the female Progressive VP and the rest of the squad take over the White House and America.
He did. He asked Ukraine to look into both Hunter Biden and the DNC server, which ironically for you, is ACTUALLY just a conspiracy theory.
And actually, he didn’t even need the dirt. All he wanted was the announcement of an investigation because he knew that’d be enough to hurt Biden.  Which is why Zelensky was ready to make that announcement until Trump got caught and was forced to release the aid.
I mean, if it was so legal and ok, why did his administration have to scramble to justify his withholding of aid AFTER he did it?  Why was Congress not informed like they're supposed to be?  Why did he ask Ukraine for dirt on Biden right before withholding the aid?

I don't think that trip to Ohio is going to give him the boost he expected given the unhinged rant he unleashed against Joe Biden's faith and his ludicrous misunderstanding of how the constitution is amended. This man HAS no God but money.
I agree. I never go after unless they say terrible things about BIDEN. BIDEN is a devout Catholic. I am too. trump isn’t even Christian
It’s not Biden it is trump and the trumpthugs
I would but trumpthugs just said BIDEN will hurt God. Fake evangelists say trump is god. They started it
I cannot wait to see how many people show up for BIDEN than trump
All of these women are more than qualified! Biden never said that he would necessarily choose a woman of color. His VP candidates are a milliom times better than what is in the WH at this time.
Kanye thinks all Black people are fools. Black people know how important voting for BIDEN is. I feel very sorry for West. Mental illness is a tough thing to deal with
Trump should implement a draft and watch Antifa and Biden voters run to Canada.  😂😂
This will not hurt BIDEN. you assume all black people will follow you you assume black people are stupid. You underestimate the Black Community. They know what it is going to take to take down trump
A couple of things.  I’ll admit, the original statement from Shithead never warranted a response, but Biden could have been directly asked.  In fact, the original statement only pandered to Shithead’s base; it won’t change the mind of undecided voters.
I believe  about his faith which is why I find it so odd that #prochoice folx are ready to accept his flip-flop on abortion.
Trump should start a draft and watch Antifa and Biden voters run to Canada
Putin still has 90 days believe nothing the media says about Biden's lead. Vote as if your life depends on it REGARDLESS  Because this foremost needs to be a win Needs to be blow out in epic fashion Vote BLUE UP AND DOWN EVERY TICKET Give America the second chance we all deserve
He has to pick the one he thinks he can work the best with. He and Obama were a great working team. Biden deserves the same.
Without even considering the possibility that there's real fraud at the top of the NRA, he's all in - and will likely end having to defend/dismiss LaPierre's misconduct/fraud creating more Biden ammunition on condoning corruption

That's okay. Biden will fix it all next year! He has a lot of crap to clean up in January. This is just a cover for big corps to pay less taxes disguised as a "perk" for wage earners.
If everyone has the expectation that Biden is going to die in office, I want some with actual running a Government experience. The state gave the same departments as the federal government with the exception of defense.
How can Fox call themselves news? I wonder what will happen to them when Biden wins?
But he's trying to do a Jill Stein move in the swing states. Pull enough votes away from Biden so Trump can chat and win. This is a farce and Mr West is a pawn in Trump's twisted plan to cheat. If he gets on ballots, this thing could get legs. We have to pay attention.
Technically I’ll take 50-50 because Democrats will take the African American &amp; Latino &amp; Asian votes by huge numbers so 50-50 guarantees a Biden win the way I see it!! #GlassHalfFull
Trump should implement the draft and half of Biden's voters would go to Canada

Apparently young black voters. He can take enough voters away from Biden to help Trump in swing states.  The cheating is beyond anything I could make up in my worst nightmares.
Well OBAMA and BIDEN NEVER HID IN THE White House bunkers. Baby trump!!!

Joe Biden has a Corvette. Doesn't that make you want to vote for him? WTF is this an 80s movie?
That was an atrocious interview, he showed his true colors throughout. I'm betting heads will roll over allowing him to actually do it. He won't take responsibility, he never does, but he'll have to blame someone. We'll blame him.
There is nothing in the Constitution (I wish the  would send Carlson their pocket edition) that even remotely suggests any restriction on who Joe may select as his vice president. Nothing. Carlson is a fool. His  slurs are an insult to all Americans.

So do as I say, not as I do. So my way or the highway.  If I wanted my abusive asshole of a father, I would have voted him in. I however voted for Clinton and come November I will be voting for Biden.
I'd say it's unbelievable...but 3.5 years in...is it November and is Biden president yet?
At this point Trump will probably refuse to do any debates, then put out ads saying Biden didn't want debates.
Ok Sokol_kel, I take back everything I said in the other thread about debating Biden. I’d be ok with beating up Walz in a nursing home.

He couldn’t do worse than trump. I wonder if trump will follow Biden all over the stage. I for one would be cheering for him to fall
Im not sure. Biden has nothing to lose. Trump does. It’s like a #1 college football team playing a trap game. No upside. #1 team wins, they didn’t prove anything. Bad team scores, does well, God forbid wins, then the sky is falling. Add moderators. Spin. Newscycle. Not worth it.

Where are the big increases. From Biden??  You however have stripped social security in your 2021 budget. How’s that gonna work?!!
We need ambitious and driven politicians in office to get things done. I think an ambitious woman is an incredible force! Obviously the men in this country have failed us. Most women make great leaders and Joe Biden knows that!
Yeah. Good point. There is surely no reason then that Biden can’t do the same thing.
Any vote against Biden helps Trump. We need the Dems to win in a landslide

Biden is nothing compared to what Hillary was.... so this is a easy victory for Trump. Trump 2020
Biden and his supporters did that by turning their backs on those of us without health coverage. #MedicareForAll
See, in the original reference, Trump had just ended a program that addressed inequality in housing, then said he's going to address income inequality. It doesn't make sense to plug Biden in, because he didn't do anything like that.
No problem with the deficit, just repeal that massive tax cut they gave to the already rich. That should be high up on President Biden's agenda. When people talk about equity in wealth distribution that is the exact opposite of what they mean. Except republicans, of course.
A non vote for Biden IS a vote for Trump. In a close election, actions like that are enough to give Trump another turn. Everything can be handled when Trump is gone. Everything. Saying otherwise is divisive and unhelpful when what we need is him gone, his party gone. Focus.
Biden doesn’t know who Chris Wallace is!  Or does he?
We will gladly drain the swamp. I've never seen such a bunch of swamp creatures like you and your administration. Vote Joe Biden Nov. 3rd.
Trump won't debate.  He would be a laughing stock!. Biden's intelligence and experience will cause Trump to look like a #COVIDIOT
Serious constitutional issues. DHS is out of control and one of the things President Biden must do is fix that.
#VoteRedToSaveAmerica2020 need 4 more years to clean up the Obama/Biden mess! 🇺🇸
Biden/TBA is still netter than Trump/Pence.
I guess I’m really not being clear. The Biden campaign is doing a disservice to all of the possible VP candidates. These women deserve the process to be without the misogynistic bull crap that is leaking out .what I was looking for was discipline for this serious task. Choose!
Just curious but what are the roadblocks to Biden appointees quickly being confirmed so we can clean out the republicans
It’ll be a great inauguration crowd regardless.  Bigger than Trump’s though that’s a pretty low bar.
Even if Biden did tweet, America wouldn't worry about it....ITS HIS POLICYS THAT WE WORRY ABOUT!!
Please show us where Biden said he would defund the police?! Trump was being interviewed and said Biden said that and then was shown the charter and it never says that. So please come with your proof that it was said and not just the lies that come out of Trumps mouth
He wants to register enough ex-felons to vote that the state swings into Joe Biden’s column in November—a goal he shares with left-wing billionaire megadonor George Soros.
Yeah Russians. You meant Biden right?
trump is an embarrassment to our Country. Biden knee in April that trump is corrupt
Can’t really blame Bush. That economy was all tied to Wall Street garbage mortgages. But OBAMA and Biden did turn a horrible situation around
Biden has to do an outstanding job of fixing all that Trump broke because the mid terms are often hard on the new president's party, so the focus has to shift immediately for the DNC and all progressives after 1/21 to the 2022 elections. Great candidates, great policies.
If he did that, he wouldn't have photos for his ads touting "Biden's America". Stupid idiot doesn't even realize that this is actually Trump's America and we all know it!

It will be an intra-party war, and Biden will have brought it upon the party himself. And if this year and 2018 are any indication, the movement of the party is to the left.  We need a Presidential ticket that acknowledges that.
And if Biden picks her, I'll be disappointed but I'll vote for him, but it'd be a slap in the face to progressives who want to work hard for him but want to know that we're heard.   We know we're not going to win everything, but give us *something* beyond lip service.
She's to the left of Biden on most issues, but it's not exactly hard to be to the left of Biden in the Democratic Party. He's not conservative, but he is moderate. And that's fine, that what the voters decided on, but a VP is meant to unite the party. Show me where she does that.
and her stance on antitrust in general is milquetoast.  Where are progressives who didn't want Biden supposed to find comfort in her as a VP nominee with Biden at the helm? I like Kamala, but let's not pretend that on the issues she's 100% progressive.

The "Joe Biden isn't competent enough to be president" thing is going great!
Yeah. Good point. There is surely no reason then that Biden can’t do the same thing.
We can't keep using Trump as the bar with which we determine how we hold our elected officials accountable. If Biden doesn't pick any progressives, we should demand better. That doesn't mean withholding votes, it means demanding better. Conflating the two isn't a good thing.
You didn’t see Biden supporters bc they’re smart enough to stay home. They know COVID is real.  Not sure you had big crowds tho but if it makes you feel better than.... yay you.
Another good question is why Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi and other   Democrats that say they are Catholic, can be pro-abortion? As a Catholic, I want to know why they are allowed communion? Why are they not excommunicated?
If Biden doesn't pick Warren, fine. I don't like it, but fine. If Biden doesn't pick Warren, runs on her language and plans, uses her for fundraising, wins and then doesn't give her or progressives any kind of elevation or position?  Fuck that, I don't want any part of that.

Biden is nothing compared to what Hillary was.... so this is a easy victory for Trump. Trump 2020
Biden and his supporters did that by turning their backs on those of us without health coverage. #MedicareForAll
See, in the original reference, Trump had just ended a program that addressed inequality in housing, then said he's going to address income inequality. It doesn't make sense to plug Biden in, because he didn't do anything like that.
No problem with the deficit, just repeal that massive tax cut they gave to the already rich. That should be high up on President Biden's agenda. When people talk about equity in wealth distribution that is the exact opposite of what they mean. Except republicans, of course.
A non vote for Biden IS a vote for Trump. In a close election, actions like that are enough to give Trump another turn. Everything can be handled when Trump is gone. Everything. Saying otherwise is divisive and unhelpful when what we need is him gone, his party gone. Focus.
Biden doesn’t know who Chris Wallace is!  Or does he?
Young voters and progressives didn't want Biden. We'll vote for him this year, but 2022 is where the decisions he makes now will come to roost. You want progressives out in 2022, volunteering and donating? Show us we have a place in the party.
We will gladly drain the swamp. I've never seen such a bunch of swamp creatures like you and your administration. Vote Joe Biden Nov. 3rd.
Serious constitutional issues. DHS is out of control and one of the things President Biden must do is fix that.
#VoteRedToSaveAmerica2020 need 4 more years to clean up the Obama/Biden mess! 🇺🇸
Biden/TBA is still netter than Trump/Pence.
I guess I’m really not being clear. The Biden campaign is doing a disservice to all of the possible VP candidates. These women deserve the process to be without the misogynistic bull crap that is leaking out .what I was looking for was discipline for this serious task. Choose!
Just curious but what are the roadblocks to Biden appointees quickly being confirmed so we can clean out the republicans
It’ll be a great inauguration crowd regardless.  Bigger than Trump’s though that’s a pretty low bar.
In a democracy, no one should be a kingmaker. I hope that Biden doesn't want to be one.
This is actually one reason that I think Warren will be the pick. I don't think Biden wants to decide the course of the party, and I'm not convinced that Warren will run in 2024. If she commits to that, it could be an incentive to Biden if he really doesn't want the coronation.

Yeah Russians. You meant Biden right?
I didn't screen cap but the Q's were CD5, likely vote screen, Trump 1-10, Biden 1-10, who you voted for in 2016, demo questions. No messaging.
It's a little troubling that people in the Biden camp would come out and say this in the press. It makes me worry about infighting.
Biden has to do an outstanding job of fixing all that Trump broke because the mid terms are often hard on the new president's party, so the focus has to shift immediately for the DNC and all progressives after 1/21 to the 2022 elections. Great candidates, great policies.

#Election2020 Is Trump saying that Biden wants to put God on the disabled list?
Wait, are you saying that Biden is not *soooo late with his VP pick* because he *just can't decide*, but that this is actually right around the time it usually happens?
I'm telling you, I have to vote for Biden, I'm not getting on the wrong side of a guy who can hurt God.
They were not drugs they retested the substance and it wasn’t drugs but they are still trying to say she resisted arrest. Crooked Sheriffs Department! They need a FBI patterns and practices investigation after Biden wins this November!
One of the reason this falls apart is that Trump -- who is an atheist, let's not pretend -- has no understanding of the language of faith. No Evangelical believes that Biden can hurt God, for God's sake.
Anyhow, no, it's not good you've had to move, but if you want The Nib to not completely implode, maybe don't run cartoons that would be considered hackishly anti-Biden by Ben Garrison.

this is 5 months old but it is a compilation of Joe Biden's lies.
Hey, I won't claim to know the future. Biden is terrible, so despite how bad Trump is, he could still win.  That said, Trump's approval is plummeting, and he is losing in the vast majority of polls. Not just by overall percentage, but state to state he is losing.
Sure. The fact that Biden hasn't been tested strongly indicates that his doctors do not think it's an open question.
As long as the the votes go to Joe Biden and gets this evil doer out of office! I’m all for it! He’s the biggest cheater and liar ever seen in the White House! Stupid to! Brags that he passed a Dementia test! Good boy! If we don’t test there wouldn’t be cases! Stupid Stupid!!
I just road bike 1200 miles in MN WI IA and IL, saw 100's of Trump signs! 2 Biden signs. Talked to 100 people at business and rally's NOT 1 Biden supporter ALL TRUMP 2020!
There is absolutely no chance Mr. Biden will debate. Not a single chance. No way.
But Joe Biden, master of speaking, would have owned this guy. Can’t wait for debates #Debate2020
If you think that is a bad leader imagine BIDEN answering ANYTHING. You haven’t seen ANYTHING yet 😂
It takes work. It's much easier to throw out, "Mr. President, can you say something mean about Joe Biden?"
Let’s not show Biden can’t hold a regular conversation with anybody onless prompted?
We will drag u out by your feet! Well have the marshalls treat u like u have treated American protesters and remove your ass out of the White House! Your trying to undermined the right to vote in every way possible! Cuz your polls! Are down 15 points under Biden! You have failed
The edited version shows the the questionable mental health of Biden. The unedited version shows the policy questions also. The views' cast tried to help him, but viewers need to decide. I decided the original version is worse.
Lol  Actually no you don't because the right and left paradigm is fake and it's just there to split and divide the country I am not voting are you kidding me????  It's a selection not an election.. Just the fact that BIDEN is a candidate at all SHOULD give people a red flag
He has dimentia, And my father has Alzheimers. And the Democrats sadly are using him like a puppet to gain power. I feel sorry for Biden. I'm angry with Democrats for letting it go on this long over one man.
I had 66 who liked trump and only 5 for Biden
If Biden issues an illegal order I would hope the DOJ would refuse to comply.
I’m not defending Trump or Biden though? Lol
The relevant information is not date, but proximity to convention, which traditionally has been the metric. And it's extremely rare for a VP to be selected too long before a convention.  Biden always said early August. It's August 2nd. Calm down.
Please do tell me why I should vote for Biden. You can't mention Trump, Republicans, or anything else related. Only describe his platform, and how it would benefit America. Go ahead.
Jesus Tapdancing Christ, there's no evidence that he's being indecisive. Reagan didn't announce Bush until after the 1980 RNC had started. Biden always said it would be August, and it's August 2nd.
This is really Biden, wearing a mask, sniffing his hair...
In retrospect, Joe Biden was exactly the right candidate. He's the one Democrat who absolutely can't be tied to the far left.
#Election2020 If Joe Biden wins I hope he makes it a priority to restore ethics in government and give violations of ethics some teeth.
I hate Biden, I'm not voting for either tbh. That said, if you think Trump has any chance at winning if the election was held tomorrow, you don't understand what people are going through. He has failed, and people are angry.
But that horrible Joe Biden who wrote the crime bill and locked up everyone and now wants to make crime legal was almost defeated!
Speaks.  Something Biden can’t do.
This is why we need the percontation point. It would be so much better if we could write, "I'm sure gonna be mad if AOC murders Biden to death⸮" and everyone realized we were not serious about whatever we were saying.
I just can't do it anymore. Someone please lock this guy up with Obama, Biden, and Hillary.....Please!
So we need a president who isn’t Joe “I don’t want my kids growing up in a racial jungle” Biden, got it.
Joe Biden is not going to do what left wants he is doing what the corrupt establishment wants.
My hot VP take remains that I will vote for Biden if he picks literally anyone for VP.
Vote for Biden? #BirkluvsTrump
Well, Joe Biden certainly was willing to share his notes. He just did it old school.YES,SOMETHING SMELLS. THE LIE HOUSE MUST BE FUMIGATED N THEN FUMIGATED N THEN FUMIGATED AND trumps REPULSIVE STINK MIGHT BE A LITTLE EASIER FOR BIDEN TO HANDLE WHEN HE ENTER INTO THE WHITE HOUSE AFTER WINNING THE 2020 ELECTION. THAT, BIDENS,WIN, WILL SMELL SO SWEET
SHAMEFUL THAT Sens. JOHNSON &amp; GRAHAM spreading FAKE NEWS from Russia on Joe Biden.
No way could Biden spell monolith or provide a definition.  Dementia Joe hasn't written a single tweet in the last year.  When he has to meet Trump on stage without a teleprompter, ear piece, or notes, it will be  GAME OVER!
We have huge problems in this country right now...Biden’s gaffes do not fall into the category of a problem. 🤨
Here is the fact. Biden will select the person who he thinks will help him win the election. I’m completely satisfied with all of the women currently on the short list. I’ll support whoever is selected. That said I prefer Sen Harris.
I hope he gets a pardon from President Biden.
Read this whole thread. I’m not going to comment on the content, but simply that Joe Biden does not write his own tweets lol.

Willing to lie to Congress. Guess he’s qualified to serve in the trump administration. Vote for Biden and get rid of all of these guys.
Biden said something stupid and owned it. Who knew this was possible?
I worked for Bernie's campaign and i am a Democratic socialist, but I can see past my privilege to know what 4 more years of Trump will do to us.  I don't like Biden, but we have 2 choices, and Biden will bring a respectable cabinet and jurors with him. We need that.
I’m a proud gun owner who refuses to vote for you.  We own guns to protect us from a tyrannical government.  I’m sure Biden would do no worse than your Portland stunt.  If he does, that’s why we have a second amendment.

We know a lot of former Republicans who are voting for Biden. Jim is not alone. #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica
Trump's actions make clear he believes Latinxs should be treated as second-class citizens.    knows when the Latinx community succeeds we all succeed. His agenda will empower Latinxs in Minnesota and make them true partners in charting our future.

You just sound stupid making a comment like that.  How about making a coherent argument?  Try to defend Biden's brain.  LOL
It's only scary to me that someone who seems reasonably intelligent like you can actually buy in to all the media propaganda. Trump had done an amazing job with the economy until the virus hit.  His running the country like a business has been successful, and yet, you want Biden?

Your right Biden will be sleeping instead
Biden doesn’t need to say another word between now and the election and he’ll still trounce Trump.   All Biden has to do is sit back and let Trump dig his own political grave by opening his mouth and saying the stupidest shit possible to know he’s not a leader.
I take it as a given that Biden will, as Obama and to a slightly lesser extent Clinton did, normalize the excesses of the previous administration.  Does anyone genuinely think that the winning team is going to just give up executive powers used by the previous administration?
Repeat after me:  I will do my homework and decide for myself what I think of Joe Biden's VP pick.  I will tell anyone who instructs me to do otherwise to fuck off.
Rice would get pelted for being one of the Libya intervention architects.  Biden's entire short list is women with huge liabilities.
Asking for some furry feline friends...can 😺 vote, too?
It’s not a shortage of workers problem. It’s a top management problem which Biden can fix with a pen stroke.

Admit it!   Biden 2020
VP pick will have zero impact on that. Far more important for progressive causes is to flip the Senate. Biden will sign progressive legislation if it reaches his desk. He’s no fool. But the most progressive president won’t accomplish anything with a GOP senate.
We’ve been waiting, Donnie, but frankly if after 3.5 years of your watch we are in a depression, dying of a plague, and in the midsts of rampant racism perhaps it’s time for a change. So I guess it’s Biden’s turn. Vote Biden 2020.
BIDEN HAS NEVER BEEN CHARGED WITH RAPING A 13 YR OLD. BIDEN HAS  NEVER BRAGGED ABOUT SNEAKING INTO A GIRLS LOCKER ROOM UNANNOUNCED. BIDEN NEVER FELT UP HIS DAUGHTER ON TV. DON'T PUT BIDEN N THAT SEX REVERT trump IN THE SAME SENTENCE.
I HOPE BIDEN PICKS KAMALA HARRIS A MOST QUALIFIED PERSON AND DOESN'T PICK  SOME  TURKEY SURPRISE.

Yes I will still vote Biden. But why not debate ? A semi-verbal 7 thgrader could crush Trump.
Why are they so keen on creating a drama? Remember what happened in 2016? This is not the time to divide the 🌊 wave. Kamala is more than qualified. Unless you’re so afraid of a Black woman becoming POTUS, should something happen to Biden 🤔

would be lucky to have Harris on the ticket. And if she's ambitious, so what? Biden, I believe, has indicated he will likely only serve one term. Please examine your biases. You've done the Dems a disfavor by badmouthing someone on a stellar VP short list.
Joe Biden for president
Also, she’s beautiful.
It's either Joe or Trump. Those are the only choices. I'm not a Biden fan either, but 1 rape allegation is not as bad as 30 rape allegations, charges for pedophilia and outspoken white supremacy. Choice between the 2 is clear.  We have to get Trump out. Then work on progress.
The ONLY way dems have a chance in November is to keep the virus deadly and uncontrollable in the meantime, and keeping schools closed even though no student anywhere has ever transmitted the virus to a teacher.  But, Biden will still have to debate Trump and then it's GAME OVER.

Right because managing the free world is the same as serving in the military.  What rank did Biden achieve in the military?  Oh, yeah. What an idiot.
You can't delay the election dummy! Biden will wipe the floor with you and if you try to stay they will forcefully remove you! I can't wait!
And the shit flows freely from your mouth. Again it's like .0001% fraud from mail in voting EVER! I can't wait til Biden LEGITIMATELY CRUSHES you in November!
I agree. Susan Rice isn’t a politician. For VP we need someone with political skills and experience such as Harris. Susan Rice is an ideal choice for Secretary of State where her vast foreign policy experience will be most helpful to President Biden.
If Joe Biden wants to lead, he needs to specifically decry the violence in Portland and Seattle and call on local officials to stop it, writes
In an ideal world, her criticism (“attacks”) of Biden would make her a valuable asset to his presidency bc she’d hold him accountable instead of being a sycophant.
This is bonkers. We need someone able and willing to step in at any moment. Hell, yes, she’d better want to be president. Who thinks Biden will even be alive to run for a second term? Good grief.
You, sir, are a national treasure and a gift to all of us 🇺🇸
And Biden will move them back.
If you hear Joe Biden promise to do something “on Day 1” if he wins, can we make it Day 2 so we can all get a good night’s sleep first?
Especially dumb argument given that Biden ran against Obama in the primary... and then was selected to be his VP. I guess it was ok for him to be ambitious.
😂 congrats on the pay-out whichever Rivera/Riviera you go! $
2) VP Biden didn’t run on M4A. He won the most votes and the most delegates. He ran on improving the ACA. He is the presumptive nominee. As frustrating as that must be for you, I’m sure you understand how elections work.
Too bad you can’t travel right now internationally, or you could head to the French Riviera. Bad timing for your windfall 😂
On the one hand, I agree it's uncomfortably close, on the other, the issues you state... and if these were the actual results in those states, that'd mean a win with somewhere above 320 EVs for Biden, so there's that
Biden doesn’t need a swing state if he picks a candidate that’s right for this moment. Rice helps carry Virgina and states through the south + Midwest. I like Harris but understand why the campaign may have hurt their relationship. The GOPs urgent scar tissue is self-inflicted.
We are on a powerful path to universal care and coverage, amplified by #COVID19. Our health care systems have failed, and the reform we need done will take hard work to overcome the roadblocks and barriers the GOP continues to put in front of us.
NOTHING could be worse than what now resides in the WH. I’ll vote for Biden even if he picks Rosie O’Donnell

My IDGAF what you think opinion--  The 1994 Crime bill was a good bill and was a driving force in reducing crime in this country. Biden can take credit, whatever, doesn't change the fact. For all of you thinking crime is bad now, the 80s &amp; 90s are calling and would like a word.
Biden already released his. Where's Trump's?
Well I mean trump thinks he’s god and Biden wants to take his job so in his mind taking his job means hurting god.
I’m black and I’m voting Biden.

Doesn’t sit well when anyone baselessly attacks someone else’s faith. That’s not okay. Joe Biden has been open about his faith for a long time. He’s lived it. Help me understand how a mortal man can “hurt God”. Nonsensical claims that Christians/men of faith simply do not make.

Said it before, Biden is 78 and grew up in a totally different era about civil rights/racial attitudes. What society thinks is racist now was normal for him. He may have "evolved" but some things are ingrained in his psyche
Biden is a 78 yr old man that grew up in a totally different atmosphere and attitudes towards race and he is also from a State bordering Dixie. Pretty sure this is who he is and the apology is not
I was gonna let Biden slide on hurting the Bible but then he went too far, even for this atheist, and hurt God.

You can view it how you want, but Joe Biden is still a horrible candidate.  I predict record low voter turn out, and a debacle, ie: Bush vs. Gore 2000.
I don't have money to gamble, but if i did, I'd say yeah Biden wins.  Not because he's good, but because of other factors, mainly Corona virus.
I did vote for him....but I don't see the enthusiasm that I did in 2016. Being real,  not being a sycophant.  Joe Biden sucks. I'm not voting for either. Give me a good 3rd party candidate, but that won't happen.
You won't be laughing when Biden wins.    and before you call me a "libtard", I voted for Trump and I support a lot of his policies, ie: 2nd amendment, lower taxes, less govt restrictions.  Unfortunately, his schtick got old a while ago.  The support is gone.

Joe Biden is a mental GIANT compared to ant brain djtrump.
Biden should refuse to debate Trump.   How can you debate someone who lies constantly and refuses to engage in any reasonable or coherent dialogue..  Biden should just stay on his own course of rebuttal to Trumps BS and provide direct feedback to honest journalists.
If Biden won't give Trump 3 debates, then I see 3 big rally's in Trumps future. MAGA!
What exactly do you think is gonna happen with Trump out of office? Do you think Biden is gonna usher in the new wave of progressive leaders? Suddenly shift to supporting M4A? Bring these corporations in line who’ve been stealing profits made off the backs of Americans forever?
If I had to pick someone, it would be Nina. I like her a lot in terms of what she did for Bernard and she’s nice to listen to talk.   All that being said, Biden is still a garbage candidate and even with the best possible VP pick he’s still not inspiring any confidence in me.
I’m sick of hearing how Trump is an existential threat, but nothing material has changed from before he was elected. What do they think is gonna happen after 1 term with flaccid tap water Joe Biden? [2/2]

4 more years of trump is such a non response to legitimate criticisms of biden. we vote biden in, then what? the GOP has already indicated they’re willing to be a force to stop any and all progress. the democrats are too chicken shit to do anything that doesn’t please corps.
I think Biden has stated it will absolutely be a woman.

Now the left is spinning a no debate between Biden and Trump because of Covid? Put them in glass bubbles in a studio and same for panel if media. Do it all online for that matter but yo7 have to have a debate.
cognitive decline of   is the real reason he shouldn’t debate Trump.  Plain and simple. Joe knows full well that it would and will be a disaster so he turns it around and blames Trump. In the end Biden will hide behind Covid and anything else so he doesn’t walk on stage

I didn’t get that sentiment at all from your initial tweet. 2 Qs and then I’m out—  1. Would you be ok with Trump as President for 4 more years?  2. Does anyone besides Joe Biden have a realistic chance to win?
This is election is not a one-v-one battle. Biden and Trump are simply the spokespeople for two large but very, very different visions.   One vision relies on science, data, experience, and expertise. The other relies on “speaking your mind”, “thoughts”, and “prayers”
I always said he never wanted to win in 2016 either.. and would say stupid stuff going "They will never vote for me now"..  well they did..  who knew.. but remember there is a hidden Trump vote out there, so be leary of the polls if Trump is within 5% of Biden in any poll.
Dear fellow white people:  Stop focusing on Kanye's presidential run. Stop saying he'll peel away the Black vote. You know what you should focus on instead?  In a recent poll, 50% of white people said they still plan to vote Trump.  Focus on fucking that.
Joe Biden needs to STFU if he wants any chance of winning the election

However that can only happen if you are welcomed by the patriarchal society to do so.   I am seeing it happen with the conversation lately in terms of Joe Biden's VP pick, and  in particular.
I think people feel if the VP pick doesn’t inspire people it might make more sense for people to invest in more local campaigns with more inspiring candidates who will be more likely to turn out a lot of voters (who will then also hopefully vote for Biden…).
22% of lgbtq voters voted the incorrect way in 2016. 14% for Tr*mp and 8% for third party candidates. We can do better this time. There is no reason for us not to be voting for Joe Biden who is an ally and a supporter.

When your narcissism makes you think you’re God, of course Biden’s against you.

And this right here is why we can't have nice things. Team Obama is trending because somebody said the quiet part out loud about who really owns Biden. But you don't care so long as somebody can lull you to sleep with gentle platitudes and propaganda.
Biden is above criticism? Why are you so prorective of Biden? No one can touch Joe? Gee, nice double standard,  hypocritical stance you have.
What’s the chance Biden is max headroom
Joe Biden supports killing babies! Not Catholic!
Is there 2 Joe Biden’s? Look at his earlobe, its not the same as it use to be... If I go missing you know why 👀😂
It’s absolutely patronizing for you to say “We need to vote” and to dismiss Biden’s legitimate problems with understanding the diversity of African-American experiences bc he’s old. Also please never use “disturbed” or “mental” like that, you’re being extremely rude.
Joe Biden: What I meant to say is that the African-American community is an obelisk not a monolith. An obelisk of diversity.
happy friday joe biden sucks
It really bothers me to acknowledge the validity and probability of this statement.  HOWEVER, I truly believe that all of the possible female candidates have merit as potential VP’s.  I am hoping Biden chooses A. Klobuchar, K. Harris or E. Warren. Optics are essential right now.
I don't trust Joe Biden as far as I can throw him.
Hold it! Trump forgot to say "Hoax" about Biden. “Take away your guns, destroy your Second Amendment. No religion, no anything. Hurt the Bible. Hurt God. He’s against God. He’s against guns. He’s against energy. Our kind of energy.”
I agree!!  We, as the black community, had 8 YEARS to get on top and Obama did NOTHING for blacks. He sat on his hands.  And now people think that IF Biden wins (with a token black female VP), HE is going to suddenly open the flood gates for blacks?? 🤣🤡🤣 #MAGA2020 #POTUS
You know Biden was not the President.  Right?
Even if it doesn't matter that much, I do think Biden should wait on an announcement until Trump has committed on Pence.
Do Not Pledge To support This feeble Unelectable Racist. Biden cant beat trump  We cant afford to lose so we cant afford to nominate feeble joe
That means if I don't vote for Trump I'm directly voting for Biden!
I grew up in Virginia. I'm 100% puerto rican. My friends' parents were always like, "Louie, you'd probably like this. It's real spicy." Me: I'm not Mexican, I'm Puerto Rican🤦‍♂️  That's what Biden meant in an anecdote.
If you don't vote for Joe Biden then "you ain't black."
Joe Biden supports #infanticide if a planned #abortion fails.  #Jesus would disapprove.
Even if Biden had all the questions and answers he would gaffe!😂😂😂😂
Joe Biden DENIED communion from the Catholic Church.
Trump: Biden is destroying love, god, ants, birds, bees, dogs and cats, trees and grass.   Biden: Person. Man. Woman. Camera. Thigh-land. 🤷‍♂️😆
The Trump attack on Biden's faith is beyond unacceptable. I can take his childish name calling and political differences but this might be one of his most offensive remarks to date. If you're a born again Christian and you're okay with this, it's time to examine your own faith.
So, if in 1994, if a younger Joe Biden hadn’t been woke yet, you ideology is that he couldn’t possibly have grown and corrected his way of thinking? He did serve with black president, maybe he has seen truth. #peoplechange #woke
I wonder if they use the term “God almighty” and also believe Biden could hurt him. Or if they believe the Bible is literally perfect after all the res robing hands through whom it’s come to us and yet Biden could hurt it.
Typical lyin Biden on his racist rants AGAIN!! As if he's going to be any better than Trump. He's just as dangerous, a genocidal nut job and yet the DNC shoves the old racist down our throats.
Yeah, this is why I stopped using RCP a while ago for anything other than finding individual polls. Biden may have lost a bit of ground, but this reeks of ignoring his best polls to fit a narrative.
So Biden is racist?  Wow did he take out a full page add in the NYT calling for the execution of 5 innocent black kids?  Because that should be disqualifying...right?
Trump is in electoral hot water. It could be even worse for him by November
you know damn well Trump is a racist like Joe Biden. SIT DOWN!!
"Most prolific, creative thinker" is a nice compliment to pay someone, but we know what Biden thinks about Warren's "prolific" thoughts, so I don't really see how this works.
Trump hits Biden for referring to blacks as a monolith by referring to blacks as a monolith 🤦🏾
This time next year Biden is going to try to shake hands with a painting of Abe Lincoln after concluding some remarks on why his republican friends should allow hearings for his 78 year old supreme court nominee.
Alright, so we know that there will be a fundraiser the day of the announcement. So what’s Biden’s schedule looking like right now, which I know is subject to change? Is he clear tonight? Could it PLEASE be today? Anyway, #BidenHarris2020!
Wait a minute. Is Rob's dad Joe Biden? Would explain some things.
Trump: Voting for Biden will hurt God.   God: Come at me bro.
If Trump had said what Biden did say, can you deny it would have been on a continuous loop played all day/night long on CNN?
We don’t want Biden.... we just can’t suffer with  anymore. We’re literally dying a thousand a day. #DumpTrump2020
Why is that funny? No one said “Biden 2020” like the MAGA cult does all the fucking time. They said let black voters make their own decision my guy. Stop being so hateful.
It really says something about the Trump campaign that they look at images of Biden praying and think, “this looks like weakness, and it will play well with our base.”
Biden meant this:  Latinos are made up of Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Mexicans, El Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Columbians, Costa Ricans, etc  He meant nothing bad about black voters.
if people read up on Biden's history they would know that these aren't gaffes, he really means what he says and only regrets it when he gets a large amount of negative attention. Biden is disgraceful
Yes, I’m the stupid one. The one who knows that millions who voted for him in 2016 will not do so this time. The one who knows that millions more who chose not to vote for Clinton will for Biden.  Your Nazi tears on Nov 4 will be delicious.
BIDEN'S HAD SHITS BIGGER THAN GOD HE KILLS TIME WITH HIS BREATHE. THE KRAKEN IS A PIMP
COVID has given Biden an excuse to lie low. But he still has to pick a running-mate, accept his party's nomination, and handle the debates. Can he exhibit the mental capacity to cope with our current crises while debating Trump?  Patrick Buchanan writes:
Joe Biden Backtracks After Saying Black Communities Not As ‘Diverse’ As Latino Communities  via
Well now this is interesting...
This article puts it well-there are other options, but Harris has been the frontrunner all season for a reason-she’s by far the best candidate that Biden can choose considering her experience &amp; what voters are hoping for.
Trump's attempt to take advantage of Biden's remarks is laughable.  has to insult blacks about 5,000 more time to catch up with Trump. All the black gaffes do is guarantee Joe's running mate is a black woman.
Exactly. You wanna look at politicians who made large contributions to the issues in our community look no further than Biden fam.  He's the one behind mass incarcerations.  Say what you want about Trump, voting for Biden is voting for our own mass incarcerations.
Joe should comment on Biden’s racist commentsz
I don't support Trump please stop assuming I like that jackass.  Biden drafted the 94 crime bill which caused mass incarcerations of thousands of black men and did nothing to try and address it.  How much mass incarceration policy has Trump drafted to target black Americans?
It’s the same guy pleading Biden to skip any debates because “orange man bad”
NO, Joe Biden will NOT be your savior!
This is what happens when Biden speaks. That is why he won't debate.
What crazy shit will we see Biden do today? Get the popcorn.
You didn't answer the question.  Biden drafted mass incarceration policy which targeted black men and did nothing to fix it.  How much mass incarceration policy has Trump drafted?
He almost certainly has a lifelong learning disability impacting reading. (Similar Biden’s stutter.). The focus on his reading stumbles is dumb.
Biden does not need Drugs for personal energy nor will he support fossil fuel ecosystem killers, unlike Don
Driving around my area I haven’t seen 1 Biden sign
Saw a house with a Biden sign and a BLM sign.   Read the damn room.   #denial
Joe Biden’s tweets are too coherent for him to have written himself. Ghostwriter.
It doesn't matter who the VP pick is, Republicans will dig up anything they can and if they can't find something they'll manufacture it.  Biden should pick the VP he wants and if he wants Susan Rice, so be it. It's his choice.
To blithely just recite that, just what happened, in that headline, somehow doesnt seem right.  Something more like "President resorts to absurd claims against Biden"
Biden drafted the 94 crime bill which caused thousands of black men to be mass incarcerated   How much mass incarceration policy has Trump drafted?
And Biden mass incarcerated thousands. Trump did it with mismanagement of a situation, Biden did his shit intentionally with legislature.  But by all means support the man behind mass incarcerations, some BLM ally you are.
I still am with  ! She is different enough from Biden and an intelligent, strong woman!
94 crime bill caused many mass incarcerations of black men.  Biden has been a legislator for 30 years since. Why didn't he do his job and draft legislature to address the mass incarcerations he caused?
Playing electoral defense, Trump claims Biden opposes God
A racist word has never left his lips to my knowledge and he already gets labeled along with his supporters. Biden apparently can say whatever he wants and get a free pass. Republicans have wrongly been accused of being the racist party when Dems are the real racists.
So glad you got it!!!!!! Thank you.
Trump Is Anxious That Joe Biden Is Going To Pick Kamala Harris For VP  via
Elder abuse to run Joe Biden for President.  George Soros' puppet masters would be running our country
Biden is against those who think they’re God like
. is so dishonest that it altered photos to falsely claim  is "hiding in his basement.” It is also so incompetent that it left in the knee of a person at the party Biden actually attended. At least they accurately portray Trump - dishonest and incompetent.
Why they've kept Biden out of public comment space for months.
I think that's why the whole biden is dumb argument doesn't work ...   Yo -semite Thigh-land  That's just the past two days ... lolol

Joe Biden endorses the murdering of the pre-born wicch is forbidden in the Bible, as well as by the Roman Catholic Church
In response to Geraldo Rivera's comment to #PresidentTrump  last night on Fox News about Joe Biden not being against the Bible because he is Catholic A person may claim to be Catholic, but if they don't follow the  the words of the Bible they are an atheist or at best a hypocrite
Biden didn’t even write this tweet.
Two things are happening here. Neither is ok. Mr Biden is a vulnerable adult and being taken advantage of. Or he's doing this to stand out and get media coverage. MS Biden. Help your husband please. This is past the point of political. For God sakes.

Biden. He's lost so much in life. Wife and daughter is car accident. Two sons. He went into congress poor and came our poor.  He's what the country needs. A big hug.

That was Obama.  Sorry but you can't take a black mans work and credit Biden for it. I understand that's how this country was built but slavery ended in 1865 buddy.
Although I'm personally a black liberal, blacks come in all political ideologies, they don't have to vote for Biden, just like they don't have to vote for Trump.  They're entitled to Free Speech
I hope President Biden undoes the policies put in place by Senator Biden.    (Not kidding, I really hope he will undo some of them.)
I’m voting for Joe Biden this fall. I hope Trump loses.
I expect Trump to debate Biden.  He debated HIllary Clinton.
Biden's handlers will make excuses to get him out of any debates.  It's like a boxer who challenges the reigning champ suddenly getting a "training injury" a couple days before the fight.
Biden drafted the 94 crime bill which caused thousands of black men to be mass incarcerated   How much mass incarceration policy has Trump drafted?
Biden has been an elected official for almost 40 years. What meaningful legislature has he drafted besides mass incarceration policy.
Joe Biden is a racist.  Pass it on.
Good!!!  Biden is corrupt, has dementia, needs to debate Trump. Jim why don’t you ever report anything objectively? #Trump2020Landslide
Yeah and Biden causes life sentences for non violent drug offenders. Biden did it with legislature, Trump made stupid comments.  let's not act like standing rock protesters weren't gassed during Bidens time as vice president.  What's worse Stupid comments or racist legislature?

This is your opinion. I think picking someone who isn't battle tested is unwise. I have read several pieces written by conservatives that are pro Rice. Maybe you aren't aware of Obama's relationship with Harris. I believe Obama will have a huge influence with Biden.
Yes, I do think Biden is racist. He's just less racist than Trump.
Joe Biden is off the helipad, he’s in the rocket, he’s reached low earth orbit, he’s ascending to a hyperbolic trajectory en route to Seoul, HE HAS ENTERED NORTH KOREA folks,
Joe Biden’s family should be ashamed for what they are putting a clearly sick man through. A really sad situation, no one has his best interests.
Amen, Phil. And just as importantly, Biden will restore honesty to the White House. And hopefully sychophants like Higgins and his lying GOP colleagues will all be voted out of office.
What i meant was i think trump doesnt need the debates. Biden making enough debate type gaffes without them. The karens may not care but i thinks blacks sure do as we see by the polls.
Where Clinton/Gore handed off the baton to Bush/Cheney  Where Bush/Cheney handed off the economy to Obama/Biden  The gift Obama/Biden handed on a silver platter to Trump/Pence  The giant bag of crap Trump/Pence, &amp; lets be fair-the entire GOP, are about to saddle  with
Lol biden dusnt write that tweet.
Richard Nixon seems like a progressive compared to what’s in the White House right now! I just want a Demo win. Whatever VP candidate can make that happen is my choice. I hope Biden’s campaign feels the same.
Lol Joe Biden said “y’all all niggas”  Fuck American democracy.
Biden is the man responsible for the 94 mass incarceration bill.  Look it up if you don't believe me.  Say what you want about Trump but at least he didn't draft legislature targeting our race for mass incarcerations.
Actually he is right on this one. Joe Biden needs to just stop talking.
He still has the legal right to do so. And honestly I don't blame him. After Bidens 94 crime bill and recent comments about black voters, fuck Biden.
Or possibly he has considered the outcome for people of color. I personally refuse to vote for Biden because of the 94 crime bill and his lack of effort to address the mass incarcerations he caused.  Trump's an idiot but at least he didn't draft black mass incarcerations.
Biden’s from Delaware b m. in PA) and Rice is from DC. That ticket doesn’t represent our country very well geographically.
This is their framing:  For Biden to win any of the debate, he must not make a single flub.  For Trump to win all the debates, he needs to "sound strong" *once.*
In a perfect world, you'd be right. But we dont get the option to joke about Biden being total garbage if we want to stand any chance of centrists and undecided voters voting for him. That's my take on this, idk.
him the whole night shutting down trumps rebuttals. The bar is so low for biden he could actually come out ok and then not debate again. In thar case it might help biden. Just a thought
So my new theory is are no debates really that bad? Biden is already saying dumber things by the day trump is using in ads. The polls are shifting away from biden and no debates will only hurt biden. I could see. Iden di one debate win cnn moderating and they would run cover for
Joe Biden looks like one of those super old white face golden retrievers who’s just barry hanging on.

Choosing to believe that centrists won't switch from Biden to Trump over his policies and outbursts is fucking pathetic! SEND TWEET!
Give it a rest Trump. You shouldn’t talk. All of your many crimes, yet you stole the election. Better watch your back when Biden gets elected. The courts are waiting for you.

Independents, U need to take a serious look at this candidate, Biden, who seems to constantly walk back what he says. I didn’t vote for Trump in 2016, &amp; I didn’t vote for Hillary either (but I voted). But this election is clear: it is TRUMP or the progressive left with crazy Joe.

Joe Biden can't help but expose who he truly is
I am a Democratic insider and I will tell you that he'll pick the least controversial VP that's palatable to moderate republicans (same reason Biden was picked by Obama). No one was especially familiar with Tim Kaine either. It's what democrats do.
The race without Biden, Bloomberg, Sanders, and Buttigieg, plus the half dozen miscellaneous reps and senators would have been very different, and much, much better.
, noon and night, by every media outlet, except rightwing media.   liberals and Democrats, all over the country would be ripping him up and down. let's just be real. Biden is so lucky Trump is so insanely awful, in every inconceivable way. All biden has to do is play dead!

I am not clicking on this bullshit bc I truly do not give a single fuck why this person might not vote Biden if she doesn't get her way despite knowing Trump is a psychopathic manchild responsible for 1000s of American deaths. I'm only here to say Fuck You, lady. Times infinity.
Unlike the current occupant if the office, Biden understand the independence of the justice department.  the President has no place directing or commenting on their sctions.
If a senator thinks they’ll have a close relationship with Biden and he’s serious about being a bridge (I think he is) that definitely could make VP attractive.  I think Harris, Whitmer, Warren, or Gillibrand would be excellent choices.
Biden said the BLACK COMMUNITY isn't. That's the point.

There is no question that China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, Syria, ISIS, Al Qaeda and other U.S. enemies and adversaries are rooting for pushover #JoeBiden to win in this November’s presidential election.
He ordered federal agents to beat up and pepper spray priests and peaceful protestors so he could have a campaign photo op holding a Bible upside down outside a church that didn't want him there.  Now he thinks he has the "God" vote? Pathetic.
A voter who says "I hate Trump but, gee, Biden makes these gaffes, so I guess I'll have to vote for Trump" is a fantasy that lives only in the minds of some in the media and pundits desperate to talk about something other than Trump.
Joe Biden is bringing back the old timer version of the Democrats that are racist, pro-slavery, pro-segregation and fought in the Civil War to keep things that way.
This dude 👇🏽have been working tirelessly to not support Biden. Which is fine is that your thing. But don’t hate in Kanye then if he is basically doing the same thing with money. Don’t  me - fuck Kanye.
No. No conditions. No escape clauses. Compromise. Deal. Biden gets to do what he wants, at least in one term.
Too late. He’s been a racist for decades. He showed us who he is a long time ago.
Yeah, I unfollowed her a long time ago when she started calling Biden a rapist.
I think you described Trump but used a few quotes from Biden which you didn’t understand the meaning of. I’m glad that the majority of Americans are able to reason better than you.

Joe Crow Biden you're racist, how many times you do have to apologise for being racist. We know your past.
People panicking over Biden being perceived as a lefty are forgetting 2016 and reverting to a mindless DC tic where “extremism” is the only sin. But Clinton didn’t lose because she was seen as top left-wing, she lost because the left never trusted her. And Trump exploited that.
Here’s the thing: WARREN AND WARREN ALONE helps Biden avoid this accusation. All the other VP contenders leave Biden wide open to accusations of being yet another Clintonite neoliberal.  (Biden himself is clearly aware of this, tacking left since getting the nomination!)
On the other hand, there’s an attack that HAS worked for Trump, in 2016, that Biden is obviously vulnerable to: that Democrats are hopelessly compromised neoliberal globalists, in hock to Wall Street. This works because progressives feel dispirited about both sides and stay home.
There was Pecos Bill, there was John Henry, there was Paul Bunyan, there was Joe Biden... He gave God a buddy shoulder-hug and broke his collarbone!
Biden is a clown 🤡
Any of Joe Biden's. Take your pick.
Is Warren an easier target for Trump? Sure, he’ll accuse the ticket of being lefty, but he’s doing that already and it doesn’t work. “Left-wing” isnt intrinsically terrifying to voters these days - it’s not 1984 - and besides, Biden is a known quantity.

Exactly! President Obama &amp; First Lady Michelle  would’ve detected if Joe Biden was racist  all the time they spent together. I don’t believe he is
I hope everyone realizes that the reason there is so much interest around Biden’s VP pick is that he universally is disliked. And people just want something good to cling to. And this is the guy who is going up against Trump is one of the most important elections ever.

If you're too pure to vote for Biden, then stay the hell home and don't vote for Trump.
And if only she wanted to be Biden’s VP.
When VPs do get policy roles, it’s stuff that’s of personal interest to them—like Biden and cancer research—or cross governmental—like Gore and reinventing government.  A VP isn’t going to have a broad policy portfolio, especially if it overlaps with Cabinet responsibilities.
Another, and again a Biden role, as well as a Gore role, is sounding board.  Ideally any VP would serve this role and have that relationship with the president.
One role, and that Biden himself served, is as a kind of ombudsman—make sure the ARRA oversight is doing its job, handhold senators who aren’t getting the attention they want, be the sober cab at the Beer Summit
Walter, I think we just need to pray that the Holy Spirit comes running out from backstage and tags into that fight so that Mr. Biden won’t have an upper hand against all three.
Has Biden used cocaine? There might be a good reason he used that reference.
Thankfully it's my vote and not yours. I hope Biden's everything you hope for if he wins.
If you still have any respect for Cupp....  UPDATE....ya shouldn't.   If a pundit like her needs any reason to vote for Biden other than the other option is this dangerous madness they are a joke.
Agree, I think it will get a lot closer towards November. Plus, Biden needs a wide margin to combat the Trump corruption.
Trump is already putting American workers first.😃 Biden says he will sell us out to China again.😠
I'm voting for Biden, too, but this is tacit admission things are hopeless. Which I guess is fine for you, me,  and Caitlin.
Still can’t believe that Biden needs another few days to announce his vp when he has been given an enormous amount of extra time due to corona since he hasn’t been traveling and such. Like what did he do with that extra time????
He. Just. Cant. Stop. Saying. Stupid. Shit (and this time I don't mean Trump).  Get yer ass back to the basement!! For the love of god.  #biden #gaffemachine
I dont give a fuck about your takes Biden sucks but Trump is a full fledged fascist dictator. Let's focus people.
These are the rantings of a spiteful old man, whose brain has rotted away from his high fat, low exercise and Sudafed/Cocaine/Meth abusing lifestyle. He can only verbalize his emotions in simple ways like a caveman grunting out words. Fire bad! Biden Hate!
Trump is lying about Joe Biden. Lying remains a sin. It needs to be repudiated by Church leaders in the USA.
Because they are pumping in imaginary money to shore it up long enough for a Democrat to get into office, then they will pull the plug and blame Biden for "tanking the market"  leaving him in a bigger mess. This is all while they use insider trading to build their own personal $$
Biden gets it. Go for God’s knees.
Imagine being such a worthless candidate that even you can't stand in front of this idiot and a second term.  And, yet, we have Joe Biden, an even worse alternative.
Without COVID, Biden would be a cracker to eat dog food on.  Even Trump's ineptitude and callousness in handling anti-racist unrest wouldn't help Biden if that was all that was going on.
John McCain, defended the character of Barack Obama when a woman called him an Arab. I guarantee if John was living in this hell, he'd be campaigning 4 Joe Biden. I know that as a certainty as much as I know u will still tout ur daddy's good name as part of ur own credentials.
"No candidate better exemplifies Washington's charge than Biden. His story of triumph and tragedy is well-known. Biden never lost his Catholic faith. When his son, Beau, was dying of cancer, Joe and Jill Biden showed up at Mass at my church."

I wonder what his old buddy “Barry” thinks I these comments man Biden is a racist pos dementia or not who says shit like this
Trump cult members surely drink this up, however crudely worded. God is on our side, so by implication, who is for that anti-life Catholic Biden? Trump: "No religion, no anything, hurt the bible, hurt God. He's against God. He's against guns. He's against energy..."
So.... He's killed it with promises made, promises kept. Besides, your criticize Trump on his anunciation when Biden can't remember what office he's running for
Kanye isn’t going to take a single vote from Joe Biden.
His team is exactly the right answer. Biden isn’t some knight in shining armor, no matter how much some people want that. But he’s great at building a team and putting that team to work.
If he becomes President, I won't celebrate. Will prob go to a DSA meeting and talk to comrades about how to fight 4 yrs of neoliberalism under Biden. We would need to protest Biden more than Trump because neoliberalism is sneaky &amp; less obvious than the fascism we are seeing now.
There are a lot of factors that go into success in a primary, and it’s difficult to separate those factors out.  Without Biden, who would have led in SC?  Will Harris’s record as a prosecutor, which arguably hurt her in the primary, help in the general?
I'm fine with Republicans complaining about Biden, they can get in line.
Idk I would call them contenders as most. I agree red or blue is stupid there should be more choices but in November we unfortunately gotta vote Biden.
Let’s be honest, this makes Biden sound 100% cooler than he actually is.
Can you imagine if you put Trump instead of Biden in this picture? Holy shit!! Fucking riots. 1/2 this population gets their information filtered by the Democrat media. It’s incredible the Republicans let them get away with this!
No. Vote for Biden or re-elect Trump. Get a fucking clue.

Dude, Biden can’t remove an Amendment from the Constitution. The 2nd isn’t going anywhere. Stop trying to scare people and maybe focus on something more important like the pandemic and unemployment. #TrumpIsALaughingStock #TrumpIsLosing #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #TrumpIsAFailure
If nothing else Biden wants Florida in play  and regardless of what context she said it in or what she says now her previous comments about Cuba and Castro will sink any chances in Florida
He is one desperate man. Waiting for him to say Biden is the devil and that he can walk on water
Shouldn't you be paying your child support instead of fretting over Joe Biden who's mental acuity as far superior to Donald Trump's
It really is strange, given what we’re up against as a nation, that the question of governance has been fully omitted from the VP horse race coverage. Not only is it arguably the most important factor, it’s what Biden says he’s focusing on!
Mr. “Two Corinthians" paid off a porn star while married to his third wife and it’s Biden who's against God? Biden has always been a man of faith. A strong and devoted Catholic. He doesn’t need to hold a bible up in front of a church for a photo op to prove that.
He ssys Biden "is going to hurt God" and he wants 4 debates? Do Trumpets not see he is becoming unhinged???
There are hundreds of articles on Trump. Settle down.  If you don’t think what Biden said is concerning then it says a lot about you too.
Biden Campaign Cancels Trip Upstairs | The Babylon Bee
Don’t use the lord’s name in vain. That hurts God like Biden does...
Biden sucks. As of now, I'm probably voting for Trump.
If Biden doesn’t debate he is exhibiting reason he should not be elected - a leader isn’t afraid of a debate stage and America doesn’t need a fearful president.
I agree with the fact that their should be better education. And I totally agree two parties really suck and that more choices should be available. The fact is tho we are in America and no 3rd party candidate will win so we have to vote Biden, otherwise it’s a vote for Trump
Biden up by 4. How is this possible?? The MEDIA. They will do anything to WIN.  You have to get your team on enemy turf. Go on MSNBC CNN and obliterate them. Finish them.
Biden is a very, very moderate Democrat. As a progressive, I can promise you he’s not a socialist at all, and it’s unfair to disregard his policy and generalize him with truly brutal dictators who hid under the name of communism
And there you have it: the full case for why Warren is pretty obviously the superior VP choice.   Obviously there's room to disagree, but for the most part, arguments I've seen in the media have been a lot less structured, even slapdash. I hope Biden is being more methodical.
between biden &amp; trump america is fucked
Finally, I'd add, right now there's a lot of ferment in the country over police reform specifically. The left of the party, already skeptical of Biden, is very keyed into the issue. Picking a former prosecutor is high-risk: it could be interpreted as an attack on these skeptics.
Prez admits I will send fed inspectors to each bridge no more victims offed  by lack of maint.  Elect Biden will raise taxes 77.25 %. To tear down bridges and seek more beavers.
It’s not how you vote, it’s the reality of it. A vote for anything but Biden is a vote for Trump
But ultimately, Warren probably has a bit of an edge here too: her popularity is focused among progressives and the young, where the most Biden-skeptical voters are. Harris tends to appeal to older and more moderate groups that already like Biden - people whose votes are secure.
Take it with a grain of salt, but, well, that's a decent poll for Biden... MN is +18 (!) points.
Biden is against rainbows and will hurt unicorns.
Finally, there's the effect of the VP on the election itself. This is by far the least important consideration, because: A. Biden is already way ahead B. Study after study shows that VPs don't really matter to swing voters.  (So of course, it's all pundits want to talk about.)
That gives Biden more room to work when leading an ideologically diverse party. It reassures progressives their voices are being heard and their perspectives considered, EVEN IF (as I'd expect) they don't win every argument. It's classic coalition building. No one else does this.
So you’re saying everyone can be forgiven? Does that include Biden?
There’s a pageant-like feeling to this process. In Biden’s frame of mind he’s got it made- he’s the person to join, and he has all these women who want to boost him. Except that narrative has been driven by Biden’s camp and historical precedence.
Then, there's politics. Remember, the world doesn't end on Nov. 4. Biden will need to guide a party with major internal divisions through a harrowing period of reform and reconstruction - assuming he can end the crises in the first place.
Wow if this is possible, then I guess Biden is more powerful than we thought!
Warren isn't on the ticket because Сharlie Baker would appoint her replacement and Biden's not dumb enough  to introduce that as a variable when the majority party in the Senate is probably coming back at 50-51 seats. If it's 51 Dems, maaaaybe she gets a cabinet appointment.
On governance, the question is "Who is most likely to help Biden address the many cataclysms the US currently faces?" And here I think it's hard to argue anyone is in the same universe as Warren. She's the Democrats' most prolific, creative policy thinker.
You are right Dan.....Joe Biden’s phonier than 3$ bill
Really…it’s really going to come down to the VP pick?   Tell me this, S.E. would you vote for Pence over Biden? If yes, then sit down and be a terribly conflicted Republican who dislikes Trump’s tone, but values Party over Country.   You get to vote again in four years.
Worried about you-- says that Biden is going to hurt you. Please mark yourself safe!
I've never seen Joe Biden punch God. But one night many years ago I did see him beat Jesus at cribbage, so maybe that's what he was talking about...?
Been on the phone with my youth pastor Garamond having him talk me down. I swear, if Joe Biden beats up God, God's son Jesus and God's wife The Holy Spirit, I'll write in Jill Stein for president. Sick of this! C'mon, Joe!
That's why I don't get people on both the left and the center-right who say "well maybe Biden if he does (list of my policy preferences)." My first question when choosing a candidate is "are you a garbage person?" And I've used that to rule out Republicans AND Democrats alike.
My neighborhood in Minneapolis *apparently* went for Biden in the primary, even though the neighborhood is filled with Bernie signs and I've NEVER seen a Biden sign
"Badly needs" this is what people are getting wrong about the Veepstakes: Biden is winning, what he badly needs to do is not upset the applecart by picking someone who hasn't been through the media wringer of running for pres (like Abrams or Bass) in that sense Harris is fine.
So after everything Trump is done over $150,000 dead we're losing our global supremacy as China rises  Whether or not you'll vote for Biden comes down to his VP pick  You are part of the problem
if you vote for anyone other than joe biden you’re voting for this fat loser❤️
I thought this was the one who doesn't say stupid things.
I think Harris is basically a wash electorally - VPs generally don't matter, but she does alienate the people who are most skeptical of Biden. By the same token she's bad politically - she won't help bring progressives on board and will be seen as a snub by them.
I think you can argue about who is the best for Biden electorally (i.e., until Nov. 4), politically after Nov. 4 in terms of keeping the party united and on task, and who has the strongest governance and policy chops.
Actually if he has that kind of power wouldn’t be prudent to not provoke him? At least Biden has enough compassion to not just smite the fool.
Biden is a fake Catholic. He supports abortion completely.
Headline in the NY Post tomorrow. BIDEN KILLS GOD! ALL HOPE GONE!
Jill Biden is: * an educator  * a doctor * not a mail-order bride   Should I keep going?
45 knows how dumb the people are who follow him so all he has to say is “Biden is against god” and his sheep automatically think “45 is for god” 😭😂 I cannot with the ignorant!!!
Unbelievably tone deaf. Don't think this is some special kind of Biden goof-em-up. He's always been like this. Always.
Just make sure you don't jump ship when Biden destroys this country. I want you to be the first to go down with it
We need Biden signs.  I can probably give out at least 30 in my little precinct in Eagan.
I opened twitter to scroll a bit 3 separate times today and each time there was a new Biden gaffe.... I’m so done
I don't think I've seen you guys comment on a single one of Biden's gaffes......hypocrites.
The Only Cognitive Test Biden Needs to Take: Debate Trump  via
So just like you do in your coverage of Biden cnn?
I understand that those are the key reasons that Bernie doesn’t appeal to older white moderates but they’ve deliberately ignored every red flag of Biden’s to a level that borders on delusion. This man is horrible at speaking and shows symptoms of dementia
He's telling us so we know how desperate Trump is to win including helping West take away votes from Biden. #CrookedTrump
I’d vote for a Biden/Carrot ticket. 2020 is not the year to fucking quibble over the VP selection.  JFC-don’t you get it yet?
I've seen your change.  My neighborhood was on fire a few months back.  I'll vote for Biden and be glad to do it. You can roast me as much as you want for that.
No, you have to vote for Biden regardless. Otherwise you’re helping Trump.
Exclusive: Kanye West indicates that his spoiler campaign is indeed designed to hurt Biden.  He doesn't care about our country either. He's working for the other narcissist.
New York AG seeks to dissolve NRA in new lawsuit! Not hiding their TRUE AGENDA any longer! If you are a Democrat Gun Owner, you may get a HUGE surprise, should the worst scenario happen and Biden wins! GOD Forbid!
When I hear the cable pundits, who weren't on Joe Biden's side when these primaries started, now say such glowing things about him, I just shout "I told you so!"  He IS the perfect candidate for this election and lot of us knew that. #deadlinewhitehouse
I feel you. Fuck. I dunno. I guess which secret police do we want to fight against in 2021? I guess Biden’s secret police??? this place sucks 😫
"The manipulations that white men make in order to advance themselves and their interests are normalized…but woe betide those very same women should they get too excited about their own advancement."   helping me get through this election cycle.
Biden hates god. Really? trumpie's really reaching for the most far flung excuses.
Biden looks like a wounded animal. The wolves are hungary.
He did it on purpose to divide the Dem vote so it was easier for Biden to slide in there. He had no intention of winning he just stirred the pot up a little
“My Statement on the 55th Anniversary of the Voting Rights Act” by Joe Biden
President Donald Trump used his trip to Ohio to make a deeply personal attack on Joe Biden: "He's against God. He's against guns. He's against energy, our kind of energy. I don't think he's going to do too well in Ohio," Trump said.
Trump believes he is God  Biden beating Trump would hurt Trump  Therefore, Biden would hurt God
*Also, I'm waiting for the Joe Biden vs. God memes to start coming out. I need a good belly laugh. And if Biden actually *did* bust out some top-secret ninja move no one knew about and made it to round-2 before being vaporized... omg. Superbowl commercial.
Just saying  get Biden real plumbing your boy  might took it all by proxy.
"It’s these guys, with their habits and histories that have never really been held against them, and the fact that they are still somehow the ones weighing women’s political and personal value as the fate of the nation hangs in the balance." 🔥
Biden doesn't have to do anything  When your opponent, like Trump, is busy hitting himself in the balls you just stand aside and let him continue.
This is a very good point. And why Joe Biden is a stronger candidate in this election than many of us give him credit for. The attacks fall flat.
Biden associates giving him sniff of lavender so he goes back to sleep.
Hostility? What planet have you been living in? Under Trump there has been more economic gain for blacks than at any other time in our history. Biden isn’t ignorant he has dementia
Only rumor from women of villiage. Biden smashed his potty chair screaming it stinks.
well shit, now i have to vote for biden
Biden's Antifa handlers will close it down soon enough
Found something Biden may be able to defeat in a debate. 🤣
Obama will always be an icon for being the first black president, but he wasn’t a good president if we are being honest. Trump is so bad it makes people forget. I don’t trust Biden or any of his corporate democrat buddies
Both pieces are absolutely worth a read. And very depressing. I have been feeling the same way for weeks. Badly mishandled by Biden camp.
I disagree.  I feel the swell towards Biden was authentic, and unexpected.  All the usual forces had assumed he was washed up (and seemed to like it that way) before he surged.
LBJ and the Great Society. Need I say more. I'm sorry but all this bickering that the Dems are for minorities and Republicans are against it is hogwash. Demz are no more for Minorities than they are for votes. And I'm not voting for Trump. Though Biden isn't really any better.
Biden has the power to hurt God?
And they wanna talk about Biden...ok
Bidens wife obviously makes decisions.  She will give him bread and  water in wine cellar.until she makes a decision. Not female devil.  Biden continue letting wife make decisions... Survive.
Good point, Biden should only select a VP who beat him in the primary.    Really, candidates have a bunch of different strengths, and having some that let you win doesn’t mean that others don’t have strengths you want on your side.
It's weird how much power Joe Biden has, that he can hurt God. Imagine what he could have done back when he was in his prime! :)

JOE BIDEN: “Unlike the African-American community, the Latino community is a incredibly diverse community"  How come the media doesn’t say Biden is a racist?   The same man who said “vote for me or you ain’t black”
Yeah maybe. Will he listen to those people? We will see. I’m voting for Biden, but I’m not happy bout it lol
You'd prefer a man who clearly takes pleasure in his own cruelty?  You don't have to like Biden.  But I'm glad we chose a moderate.  It makes a point, however imperfect.
It's okay, when Biden comes for his guns, Trump can escape to Thighland. 😂
When I hear people say things like “he’s senile, I can’t vote for him” I can’t help but think they’re talking about  but apparently people think this about Biden?
I say the same thing.  I also said the same thing with Bernie.  Bernie has been a legislator for almost as long as Biden. He's another one of the elected officials who does do Jackshit.
Has Biden clarified whether he is against God?
Oh No, Is Joe Biden Going To Spank The Lord Right On The Bottom?!
OTOH the GOP has gone all-in on Biden having cognitive issues.  If Biden clearly exceeds expectations (very coherent, not gaffe-less), it really sinks their boat.  I would think they would ask--why didnt we know this?
But they were all of them deceived, for another ring was made: in the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom, the dark lord Sauron forged, in secret, a master ring to control all others.  And apparently Joe Biden wears it? This guy...
I’m tired of Chris W. He’s always looking to say something negative about the President. What would our world look like under Biden &amp; Co? The fact that Biden is leading shows how the media has hated on him for 4 yrs. CW be part of the solution not the problem. A lot is at stake.
Oh thank you, Trump, for letting me know.  I didn’t know that Biden was was going to hurt God. That doesn’t sound very nice.  And here I was going to vote for him..... 🙄🤬😳
So he’s saying Biden is the true god cuz otherwise god can’t be hurt ?!?!  BrahminBiden 🤷🏽‍♂️
This makes Biden sound like a JRPG protag.
Biden has been refused Holy communion.   Biden has a complicated history with the Catholic Church. ... Morey said he denied Biden Communion because of the candidate's political ... has been barred from receiving Communion over his radical stance on abortion rights.
Joe Biden is a racist
I'm sure Biden super PACs are just fine? Facebook should be made to answer. Pull their 230. Quit dicking around.

Are we going to pretend like #Schmuckerberg isn't TRYING to get the #CovidiotInChief #TraitorTrump re-elected? 🤨
I don’t doubt it. I don’t know if that the only reason he lost, but it’s sure a part of it. And now we’re here and Biden is the nominee.
Lad, are you calling Joe Biden a fat junkie?   At this rate i wouldnt be surprised if you claimed Joe is secretly Xi Jinping in a thin-suit. Y’all are weird istg
Not for anything?! Is Joe Biden a nihilist?!
Biden supports abortion. He is not a "devout Catholic".
Fox is really going down hill. I heard Trump beat him in fund raising for July, but you don't hear anything about that. I had to hear that from another source. Fox is probably  giving Biden additional advertising discounts over Trump as well.
#China is hoping #Biden wins because they can then do whatever they want and walk all over the US because Biden is owned by them. #Election2020
Bautista was a Progressive Catholic. Biden reminds me of the feckless progressive, who turned over Cuba to an Authoritarian Communist Regime.What about the guy who predicted all but one correct, including correct about trump beating Clinton and Biden now?
Joe Biden’s VP pick
Biden will be lucky to win ANY state
IKR .. Takes a lot of emotional intelligence to come up with that kind of response.  Such a great communicator, he could write for Biden.
#Election2020 Is Trump saying that Biden wants to put God on the disabled list?
Wait, are you saying that Biden is not *soooo late with his VP pick* because he *just can't decide*, but that this is actually right around the time it usually happens?
No way could Biden spell monolith or provide a definition.  Dementia Joe hasn't written a single tweet in the last year.  When he has to meet Trump on stage without a teleprompter, ear piece, or notes, it will be  GAME OVER!
I'm telling you, I have to vote for Biden, I'm not getting on the wrong side of a guy who can hurt God.
Tough piece. To be sure, we libs know that y'all be attacking Biden on Day One. It is just a political alliance of convenience now. Even the #MSNBC GOP pundit class will return to attacking tan suits-- or sunglasses very soon.
They were not drugs they retested the substance and it wasn’t drugs but they are still trying to say she resisted arrest. Crooked Sheriffs Department! They need a FBI patterns and practices investigation after Biden wins this November!
One of the reason this falls apart is that Trump -- who is an atheist, let's not pretend -- has no understanding of the language of faith. No Evangelical believes that Biden can hurt God, for God's sake.
Biden said something stupid and owned it. Who knew this was possible?
Anyhow, no, it's not good you've had to move, but if you want The Nib to not completely implode, maybe don't run cartoons that would be considered hackishly anti-Biden by Ben Garrison.
that’s just not reality. I’m sorry, but you gotta look beyond your media and social bubble and view exterior evidence. Look into Biden’s actual policy and judge it for yourself. Look into how actual socialists hate him for his middling approach. He’s not who you portray him as.
You could debate John Biden a million times, I won't vote for you.
Biden is a very, very moderate Democrat. As a progressive, I can promise you he’s not a socialist at all, and it’s unfair to disregard his policy and generalize him with truly brutal dictators who hid under the name of communism

I’m a proud gun owner who refuses to vote for you.  We own guns to protect us from a tyrannical government.  I’m sure Biden would do no worse than your Portland stunt.  If he does, that’s why we have a second amendment.

He will immediately institute Hunter Biden as a Consultant at a grossly inflated salary with a large sign on bonus. LOOK! Here's the deal! That will fix those China guys!
this is 5 months old but it is a compilation of Joe Biden's lies.
Hey, I won't claim to know the future. Biden is terrible, so despite how bad Trump is, he could still win.  That said, Trump's approval is plummeting, and he is losing in the vast majority of polls. Not just by overall percentage, but state to state he is losing.
Portland looks like it does under trump. You can’t blame Biden for something that is happening under trump.
Joe Biden should be asking for an IMMEDIATE interview with
Sure. The fact that Biden hasn't been tested strongly indicates that his doctors do not think it's an open question.
You just sound stupid making a comment like that.  How about making a coherent argument?  Try to defend Biden's brain.  LOL
It's only scary to me that someone who seems reasonably intelligent like you can actually buy in to all the media propaganda. Trump had done an amazing job with the economy until the virus hit.  His running the country like a business has been successful, and yet, you want Biden?
Democrats are hoping for chaos, they know Biden has virtually no chance
Only until Biden’s inauguration. I fear what Trump will try to do to punish Americans after the election and before he gets dragged out of the White House
As long as the the votes go to Joe Biden and gets this evil doer out of office! I’m all for it! He’s the biggest cheater and liar ever seen in the White House! Stupid to! Brags that he passed a Dementia test! Good boy! If we don’t test there wouldn’t be cases! Stupid Stupid!!
I just road bike 1200 miles in MN WI IA and IL, saw 100's of Trump signs! 2 Biden signs. Talked to 100 people at business and rally's NOT 1 Biden supporter ALL TRUMP 2020!
There is absolutely no chance Mr. Biden will debate. Not a single chance. No way.
But Joe Biden, master of speaking, would have owned this guy. Can’t wait for debates #Debate2020
If you think that is a bad leader imagine BIDEN answering ANYTHING. You haven’t seen ANYTHING yet 😂
It takes work. It's much easier to throw out, "Mr. President, can you say something mean about Joe Biden?"
You mean Biden and his team might be better at this than random twitter person?
Let’s not show Biden can’t hold a regular conversation with anybody onless prompted?
Andrew Yang Has A Debate Warning For Trump ― And A Bold Prediction For Biden #SmartNews
True enough. There's a lot of conspiracy theories in regards to their deaths, but a vast majority also believe it was a retaliation hit for laden after Biden leaked the Intel. The unit was also expecting retaliation after Biden leaked it, atleast from what I've read about it.
We will drag u out by your feet! Well have the marshalls treat u like u have treated American protesters and remove your ass out of the White House! Your trying to undermined the right to vote in every way possible! Cuz your polls! Are down 15 points under Biden! You have failed
America was already divided before trump came into office, you can thank Obama for that. Secondly, between the two candidates trump is the only one who has an ounce of patriotism or have you forgotten that Biden signed the death warrants of the entire unit of SEAL team 6.
The edited version shows the the questionable mental health of Biden. The unedited version shows the policy questions also. The views' cast tried to help him, but viewers need to decide. I decided the original version is worse.
All thanks to Biden who publicly named the members of SEAL team 6 and signed their death warrants.
And you want to blame Trump for lazy or stupid people?  What did Obama/Biden do to fix that for 8 years?? NOTHING.
Try to avoid the USPS, find election drop boxes in each &amp; ALL states. OR- VOTE super early.    Excited to talk with Biden’s field  leader tomorrow. I’ll see what I can do on a grassroots level with  - to MAKE EVERY VOTE COUNT! No suppression this time! All votes count!!
He has dimentia, And my father has Alzheimers. And the Democrats sadly are using him like a puppet to gain power. I feel sorry for Biden. I'm angry with Democrats for letting it go on this long over one man.
I had 66 who liked trump and only 5 for Biden
Trump seems to have stopped advertising in Minnesota so I'm guessing Biden is ahead by a lot more.
If Biden issues an illegal order I would hope the DOJ would refuse to comply.
I’m not defending Trump or Biden though? Lol
We need YOU Joe Biden!!!!
It’s alright man, no need to apologize. I didn’t know about your history and I don’t want to make you uncomfortable. I just wished to facilitate a civil discussion about Biden. You vote yourself conscious, but also remember to look at multiple sources and double check yourself.
I cannot pick just one... 1) President Barack Obama 2) First Lady Michelle Obama 3) Joe Biden 4) Ruth Bader Ginsberg  5)  John Lewis (I wish I had known him when he was alive.
but Biden won the popular democratic vote, and he will bring us closer to these goals by strongly strengthening Obamacare and fighting to get our country carbon neutral by 2030. I would prefer Bernie, but I realize Biden is still a strong step in the right direction.
To me it seems like you have a very black and white view of this. Biden is bad, and that’s not negotiable to you. This lack of listening to other viewpoints and name calling isn’t helping anyone. I want to fight climate change, I want Medicare for all, I want a progressive future
The relevant information is not date, but proximity to convention, which traditionally has been the metric. And it's extremely rare for a VP to be selected too long before a convention.  Biden always said early August. It's August 2nd. Calm down.
Please do tell me why I should vote for Biden. You can't mention Trump, Republicans, or anything else related. Only describe his platform, and how it would benefit America. Go ahead.
Jesus Tapdancing Christ, there's no evidence that he's being indecisive. Reagan didn't announce Bush until after the 1980 RNC had started. Biden always said it would be August, and it's August 2nd.
That’s anecdotal and only predicts the worst case scenario. At least Biden actually has a plan. Go to his website, read his recent plan, and then tell me how he’s equivalent to trump. I’d rather vote for a guy with a plan rather than a guy who doesn’t.
In a normal political environment, I would completely emphasize with your median stance; however, this is not a normal time. Attacking Biden is supporting Trump in the view of most democrats, including myself. Say what you want about Biden, but at least he will bring in experts.
You’d better believe Biden won’t be giving tax breaks to your billionaire buddies. They can pay their fair share. #bluewave #votehimout #trumptraitor
Biden was faded before he started
Reasons  should be VP  Besides being bad ass and wicked smart, she will bring joy and her fabulous laugh. She will challenge  and be a true partner. She will hold people accountable and support the Biden platform. No bad choices in VP roster #KHive
I’d like to see Biden right a giant wrong and put Merrick Garland on the SCOTUS. I favor Adam Schaffer’s for USAG, Mr. Yang at Commerce and Sen. Warren as Senate Majority Leader.
Also, she’s beautiful.
In retrospect, Joe Biden was exactly the right candidate. He's the one Democrat who absolutely can't be tied to the far left.
The ONLY way dems have a chance in November is to keep the virus deadly and uncontrollable in the meantime, and keeping schools closed even though no student anywhere has ever transmitted the virus to a teacher.  But, Biden will still have to debate Trump and then it's GAME OVER.
Please. Let’s get FakeJillBiden on Twitter! She and I would be besties.
They were just in Minnesota.  Fuck!
#Election2020 If Joe Biden wins I hope he makes it a priority to restore ethics in government and give violations of ethics some teeth.
I hate Biden, I'm not voting for either tbh. That said, if you think Trump has any chance at winning if the election was held tomorrow, you don't understand what people are going through. He has failed, and people are angry.
But that horrible Joe Biden who wrote the crime bill and locked up everyone and now wants to make crime legal was almost defeated!
Speaks.  Something Biden can’t do.
This is why we need the percontation point. It would be so much better if we could write, "I'm sure gonna be mad if AOC murders Biden to death⸮" and everyone realized we were not serious about whatever we were saying.
I just can't do it anymore. Someone please lock this guy up with Obama, Biden, and Hillary.....Please!
I’m not gonna bother arguing. I implore you; however, to look at the policy between Biden and Trump when it comes to race. You’ll see which one has a stronger anti-racist mindset. Look at what they say policy-wise, disregard your bias, then say who’s racist.
I think your TDS is terminal.  It's a good thing Biden didn't enrich himself and his family by exploiting the Biden name in China and around the world.
Right because managing the free world is the same as serving in the military.  What rank did Biden achieve in the military?  Oh, yeah. What an idiot.
We need to move the general election up to the first Tuesday in September, Biden's Inauguration on Wednesday, and your arrest on Thursday.
You can't delay the election dummy! Biden will wipe the floor with you and if you try to stay they will forcefully remove you! I can't wait!
And the shit flows freely from your mouth. Again it's like .0001% fraud from mail in voting EVER! I can't wait til Biden LEGITIMATELY CRUSHES you in November!
So we need a president who isn’t Joe “I don’t want my kids growing up in a racial jungle” Biden, got it.
You, sir, are a national treasure and a gift to all of us 🇺🇸
Especially dumb argument given that Biden ran against Obama in the primary... and then was selected to be his VP. I guess it was ok for him to be ambitious.
Joe Biden is not going to do what left wants he is doing what the corrupt establishment wants.
😂 congrats on the pay-out whichever Rivera/Riviera you go! $
2) VP Biden didn’t run on M4A. He won the most votes and the most delegates. He ran on improving the ACA. He is the presumptive nominee. As frustrating as that must be for you, I’m sure you understand how elections work.
Too bad you can’t travel right now internationally, or you could head to the French Riviera. Bad timing for your windfall 😂
On the one hand, I agree it's uncomfortably close, on the other, the issues you state... and if these were the actual results in those states, that'd mean a win with somewhere above 320 EVs for Biden, so there's that
I mean, to be fair, Biden’s policy is a lot more sound and detailed than trumps, no matter how you look at it. His goals are clear, and they mostly align with democratic beliefs. It ain’t too hard to get
Obviously you didn't get the memo that we expect you to go on  in October and vouch for Joe Biden.
My hot VP take remains that I will vote for Biden if he picks literally anyone for VP.
Vote for Biden? #BirkluvsTrump
Well, Joe Biden certainly was willing to share his notes. He just did it old school.Stolen from brilliant  :   Joe Biden: “just pick any black woman.  They all think and act the same anyway”.
As Biden would say cmon man. You really think you just thought of that? 😳
Who gives a fuck what these jackass Sanders supporters want! They will stay in their place and vote Biden regardless of who his VP is! Sit down and shut the fuck up Bernie supporters! 😎✊🏾👊🏾🙇🏽‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️😂🤣🖕🏾🖕🏾🖕🏾🖕🏾🖕🏾
Biden wants to stop all oil exploration drilling, fracking, and wants to shut down coal power plants. The guy is a clown!
Exactly. I am convinced the "pick is in".  It would be a glorious weekend for many if Biden made his pick known today.
Biden isn't worthy of anyone's vote!
Are we afraid of what the tRump camp might say about Rice? Biden will choose the best woman for VP....period!
Great strategy: Biden’s supporters are approving Trump BEFORE 03 Nov...
Omg she just throws out my thoughts cause I have maga in my bio. Why y’all do that? It’s not like I throw out your thoughts cause u a Biden supported. I actually listen to what u gotta say. Why everyone do this
The strategy will be ready after this Nov 3rd when Joe Biden gets elected
Biden's done for, good riddance.
Biden needs to choose a fucking capable adult that won't sell out the country for more money. It's not difficult. #VoteBiden
I mean - what the actual fk?  If  doesn’t make this into an ad overnight, with big $ as drops in major urban areas - he doesn’t want to win.  Easy tag lane. “Joe Biden:  he thinks and says all blacks think the same on every issue”
Never Trump =always Biden and whoever his VP is - soon to be leader of free world and largest economy in the world.  It’s just that simple.
Biden is portrayed as a familiar face and reliable statesman in contrast with the volatile Trump. In reality, he promises to be the most liberal president in history, writes   via
Have to retweet just because the Right gets its jollies from Biden gaffes
Maybe he should go to Thigh land.  What kind of moron continues to try to say Biden is some kind of gaffe machine when Trump is just walking around with his pants around his ankles every day?
You’ve actively listened to trump for the past 4 years and are at a loss at what comes out of BIDEN’S mouth??
Biden's out to lunch, gone!
We had a family member who exhibited these same behaviors. I would guess Joe Biden is about 24 months from being disabled by Dementia.
BBC News - US election 2020: Trump says opponent Biden will 'hurt God'    JP: God doesn't need Trump to defend Him or His Word
This attempt by GOP operatives to get Kanye on the ballot to dilute the Biden vote is so reprehensible on 2 counts. It smacks of demeaning, racist assumptions about Black voters, &amp; manipulates &amp; exploits a person who is in the midst of a recently disclosed mental health crisis.
Biden is against GOD now? I bet he knows a scripture from the Bible, unlike Orange Face, gets more insane everyday.
You think Trump’s bad, wait until you hear Biden try and speak.
Biden cheers abortions. That’s super catholic of him.
Your weaseling claims are all based on stoking up fear. Biden will not take any guns, hes forgot more about the Bible than you have ever known, and he has empathy and compassion for the downtrodden. Words you are totally unfamiliar with. You’ll find words like that in the Bible.
Joe Biden: "most people don't know, unlike the African American community with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community, with incredibly different attitudes about different things"
If a God can be hurt by Joe Biden, is he really a God?
...and once Biden decides on his V.P., who will most likely be a WOC, watch the enthusiasm runneth over!
Seeing VP Biden in action will change a lot of minds!
Biden is definitely the radical left
Good platform for Biden imo
Someone should remind him of that pic of Joe Biden in a church, praying, that his campaign doctored.
yeah kinda funny - all Trumps ads misuse Biden photos where he's actually PRAYING. I've never seen this clown bow his head in prayer.  Yet I still know some evangelicals that think there was a prophecy  saying Trump was called by God to the WH.  Not by MY God that's for sure...
All veterans. All Republicans. All in for Biden.
Joe Biden is a modest candidate with modest goals:  1: sell a quality platform to swing moderate Rs 2: drain the world's oceans so we can find and kill god
“Unlike the African-American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community, with incredibly different attitudes about different things." - Joe Biden  What the fuck.   What the actual fuck.
Because Joe Biden is a fucking adult.

Biden's not all there, tough crap DemocRATS, Lmao
Trump is also wanting to defund the USPS, as well as try to tamper with the mail-in voting process.  If this is all happening, I have no choice to vote in-person at my polling station. I will just do that, and count my vote in for Biden.  Don't let this man tarnish your vote.
Biden is not gonna pick someone who is a Libertarian party member lol

... Joe Biden, but not by much
Vice President Biden campaigns (mostly) from home because unlike your guy, Biden is actually concerned about people getting sick.  90 days. . . .
In Florida....LMAO....and when you lose Florida remember that.  Don't you dare say "we did an incredible job, but they found a way to be illegal....hope Biden calls in Special Forces after you lose to cleanup the WH and have you escorted out
This is like a really bad sitcom of this mongoloid of a president.  and still continues to downplay deaths of the Coronavirus, which means he doesn't care about people at all.  You'd have to be a utter fucking moron to vote for him at this point.  So please, vote for Biden.
Biden is generous with other people's money! Wheres Hunter?
He doesn't want to lose more votes, so goes to mail-in voting which about 68% of the people have said they're going to do.  He makes it look fraudulent and blames Democrats.  He thinks he can knockout Muhammad Ali/Biden by punching and weaving and not get knocked out completely
Um, you realize the competition is Joe Biden right?  Most of the time he is unsure of what state he is in.
Will Joe Biden duck the debates? There are growing calls to shield the former Veep from having to perform.  via
I don’t wanna hear anyone talk about Joe Biden’s speaking problems
Vote for Biden!
You act as though Russia Bounties was a real story.  You’re such a lemming.  And how do you propose we hold China accountable for the 150,000 dead?  What’s Joe Biden’s plan to hold China accountable?
And so it begins. Let’s Scrap the Presidential Debates
He is either preparing a late October surprise or an assassination attempt on Biden. Anything else he tries will fail
If Biden's on the ballot he is who gets or doesn't get the vote. We don't vote for a VP who might become President through death.
I hope you're right, Biden would be a disaster.
Partial truth because Obama wasn't Republican ...at THIS point in time...OBAMA isn't a candidate at THIS point in time.  You're comparing to a non running Democrat, but not BIDEN at THIS point in time....your partial truth using specific phrases that don't relate to your opponent
Biden is garbage, #FourMoreYears for Trump is assured !!
So Dumb Donald Trump' said horrible things about Americans threatens violence because they peacefully protesting peacefully, called them thugs and criminals. Did nothing even addressing a rising death toll due to the Trump Virus.  In order to combat him show him vote Biden
Biden is too chicken to tell this directly to Trump in the debates.
Seriously! Where is this coming from? Obama announced Biden on Aug 23. 3 DAYS before the convention. Clinton announced Kaine on Jul 22. 2 DAYS before the convention. This is manufactured drama.
Biden won't be elected so who cares who he picks as VP?
From June 7
The testing strategy will only come out when Biden gets elected this Nov
A vote for biden hopefully free the children.
Wow - you don’t know me. I am not a Republican and would never vote for one. I support Medicare for All or a national health plan like my relatives have in the UK. Biden was not my 1st choice but will get my vote in order to get rid of Trump.
That’s right Trump infected all of them right? God help us under Biden
He went to the launch you donkey!  Biden was in his basement
Trump will trounce Biden.
If Biden loses it will be because people like you decided that a purity test was more important than ridding this nation of Trump. We have a binary choice this November. Vote for Biden and then keep pushing the progressive agenda.
Biden is too chicken to debate Trump.
Either way Biden's going down, the guy is a senile joke!
How come Biden is too chicken to debate Trump?
I hope President Biden finds a job in his administration for Andy Slavitt.
oh, BTW Biden supporters have been burning Bibles, you have anything to say about that?
She is the best ammo against Biden.  She knows he’s a racist and homophobe like the rest of us. It will be Susan Rice

The black people are waking up to the truth that Trump actually helps them while the Democrats just say they will help them while using them. Clinton’s are case in point. Biden is a tool and can’t complete a full sentence
Should we do like Biden and Obama and just stop testing? That’s exactly what they did during the last pandemic.
Just do like Biden and Obama. Stop testing.
Should just stop testing like Obama and Biden did during the Swine Flu pandemic.
It’s actually MUCH higher. You ignorant liberals over sample the 10% minority you project to be the majority on fake news. Just like when Hillary lost, Biden will lose. Why not conduct real polling? Oh because sleepy locked in the basement Joe would be down by 30% or more
I just signed a  petition to  and  calling on them to include ending marijuana prohibition in their campaign platforms. Sign here:

"Our country is in burning turmoil, and the White House is eagerly fanning the flames. If we are to have a shot at quenching them, let alone beginning to repair the damage left behind, we will have to play the two-party game to its conclusion in November."
I completely agree. That is why when Republicans keep calling Joe Biden “Sleepy Joe”, I tell them that after almost 4 years of the waking nightmare that is Donald Trump we’re tired. We could use a nap.
Same people polling saying Biden up on Trump by double digits. Same ones who said Hillary 90-10. Lol 😂
They can not except it. Biden can send out the troops. Not!!!
if i don’t stop getting emails from joe biden i’m gonna end it all
How come Biden didn't show up?
Trump doesn't use a teleprompter idiot. Have you seen one of his rallys, no teleprompter. Biden's going away in November, good riddance to the groping plagiarist!
No, but we would have to worry about Biden’s staff.  Everyone knows he can’t use a computer to tweet.  I can’t imagine anyone thinks his twitter page comments are posted by him
The election is already a cluster fuck. It’s only going to get worse. Biden will refuse to debate. Votes will get lost. My dead uncle will be voting democrat.

Kamala too bad this time you can’t sleep your way to the top. Biden only likes little girls.
I'm glad he's gone, Biden will be the next to go.
Yikes 😬  But he can't do that though too, congress should and will definitely not do this.  But in other context, Trump will throw anything as a curveball for this election. Like possibly not wanting to accept if he loses.  So get out there, and vote for Biden. Please.
Want to bet? Biden will disappear in the ash heap of history, good riddance to the groping clown!
What does Biden's wife, a doctor, say about hydroxychloroquine?
I didn't realize Joe biden was the president and oversees this
Let's see Biden's wife, a supposed doctor, tell the American people that hydroxychloroquine doesn't work!
Biden is a groping plagiarist unfit to run our country
A Biden presidency won't help anyone except Hunter.
No write-ins, no third party... unfortunately, this has to be a vote AGAINST Trump, not a vote FOR Biden in order to achieve the goal.
Biden is a racist-his crime bill sent 10,000 African American men to jail.  He also voted to make gay marriage illegal.  Bad dude!
Yes, a source would be nice. If Biden did say it sure that would be distasteful, but taking the dreams of millions of Americans (of all races) away just to be spiteful. I don't know seems a little worse to me. 🤷🤷
So typical. Most VPs have been ambitious &amp; have made a run for President--but then they've been men, so that's deemed okay. But God forbid that a woman be ambitious. Biden said he only wants to serve for 4 years and be a bridge for the next generation. Stop this misogynistic BS.

Yikes 😬  But he can't do that though too, congress should and will definitely not do this.  But in other context, Trump will throw anything as a curveball for this election. Like possibly not wanting to accept if he loses.  So get out there, and vote for Biden. Please.
Want to bet? Biden will disappear in the ash heap of history, good riddance to the groping clown!
What does Biden's wife, a doctor, say about hydroxychloroquine?
Let's see Biden's wife, a supposed doctor, tell the American people that hydroxychloroquine doesn't work!
Biden is a groping plagiarist unfit to run our country
A Biden presidency won't help anyone except Hunter.
Biden is a racist-his crime bill sent 10,000 African American men to jail.  He also voted to make gay marriage illegal.  Bad dude!
Yes, a source would be nice. If Biden did say it sure that would be distasteful, but taking the dreams of millions of Americans (of all races) away just to be spiteful. I don't know seems a little worse to me. 🤷🤷
So typical. Most VPs have been ambitious &amp; have made a run for President--but then they've been men, so that's deemed okay. But God forbid that a woman be ambitious. Biden said he only wants to serve for 4 years and be a bridge for the next generation. Stop this misogynistic BS.
This was purposely leaked to gauge the reaction of the masses. This was NO accident.
Joe Biden for President’s event, “Minnesota Build Back Better Roundtable with Attorney General Eric Holder” – sign up now to join! #TeamJoeBiden’s gonna screw this up, isn’t he?
This computes. It’s why I’ll take Biden to task AFTER he’s elected but not before. It’s why I’ll team with GOP Never Trumpers with whom I have little else in common. We have to get the train wreck outta the White House.
What should Trump of done differently regarding Covid-19?   The rioters seem to be unaffected!  Imagine Biden trying to decide what to do.  He’s not sure if he ate breakfast in the morning.
JOE BIDEN NEEDS TO GET AN IQ TEST DONE
President Donald Trump accused former Vice President Joe Biden of wanting to 'hurt God' during a stop in Ohio on Thursday.
BFD congress has a dam slush fund that all the congressional members use to pay off sexual harassment claims so stop calling the kettle iron pot or kettle calling the pot iron Biden has the TRUE KOOL-AID DRINKERS  he is a marionette puppet pull his strings.
How is Biden a liability. Biden is 77 and Trump is 74. If ones a liability then so is the other one. Got to blame the voters for not endorsing a younger candidate during the primaries. It would be nice to have a President that can't get AARP.
We are in August. I would like to think a running mate would have been selected by now. I have seen some reports that the Dems are not going to expose Biden or VP to personal attacks or any dirt the Orange man can find.
In this scenario, we will need cardboard cutouts of Elvis Presley, Walter Cronkite and Tina Louise, acting as the moderators. All three of these individuals were at their prime when Joe Biden was at his.
I have zero political affiliation. In fact, I despise politics. I am an equal opportunity Twitter Warrior. It is my sense the less Biden is “out in the public” then there is less he or any VP candidate can be personally, not politically, attacked.
This is about Biden’s faculties. There is no doubt his heart is in the right place.. but, just as much as Trump has baffling, narcissistic quotes, some videos of Biden are he can’t finish his train of thought. Like, he is really losing it. His VP candidate will be important.
I am no longer watching news coverage of or reading tweets about Biden’s VP pick until there is a VP pick.
And Joe Biden’s brain works?
Is Biden going to pick her or her ugly clone?
Minnesota has voted for the Democratic nominee for 11-straight elections, but in 2016, the margin was the closest in modern state history.I always said he never wanted to win in 2016 either.. and would say stupid stuff going "They will never vote for me now"..  well they did..  who knew.. but remember there is a hidden Trump vote out there, so be leary of the polls if Trump is within 5% of Biden in any poll.
🤦🏽‍♀️😂😂😆😆This Idiot In Chief is desperate and saying anything he can think of to try to make Biden look bad, when the more he opens his mouth the worse it makes him look!!
I wonder what his old buddy “Barry” thinks I these comments man Biden is a racist pos dementia or not who says shit like this
I’d vote for a Biden/Carrot ticket. 2020 is not the year to fucking quibble over the VP selection.  JFC-don’t you get it yet?
Oh thank you, Trump, for letting me know.  I didn’t know that Biden was was going to hurt God. That doesn’t sound very nice.  And here I was going to vote for him..... 🙄🤬😳
why isn’t this on the first page of yahoo?
How is any Evangelical okay with this?  Joe Biden will "hurt the Bible, hurt God," Trump says in Ohio of his practicing Catholic opponent. "He's against God."
You know who is not worried about indictments from NY AG?....Obama and Biden....We can't say the same for t-Dog.
Ok I had a “Biden” moment because I though the joke was, “it’s a sin with a gun.”  And I even own a Glock 😂🤣
I want to see him led away from Biden’s inauguration in hand cuffs along with his brood. Just a perp walk. It would be better than the post Tulsa walk of shame.
nope, but Obama did.  While the world was in lock down he went out and golfed.  Trump has golfed a few times but not during the lock down...it's called exercise.  How can you blame the virus on Trump?  He was called a racist when he tried to keep it out of the country by Biden.
Since everything in the MSM is fake to tRump and his supporters. I have an idea, what if the MSM started saying that he's a great President 🤣? Maybe they'll vote for Biden. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
1st the media pushes round the clock #COVID19 fear-mongering(allowing  &amp;  to hide in the basement).  NOW they want to scrap the debates BC Biden is losing his cognitive abilities.  The media's assault on our democracy is getting spooky
Biden was my LAST choice of the Dem candidates. But a boil on Biden's ass would be a better president than Trump.
You mean how the guy who just took over the postmaster general donated to Donald trump? The same Donald trump trying to push back elections? I repeat, you want to act like the postal union endorsing Biden is bad while ignoring that the guy in charge of mail supports corrupt trump
Imagine if Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as VP and Kamala Harris picks Hillary Clinton as her VP
Biden:WHAT A LOSER!
You can bet money that the rule book will make a reappearance if Biden wins the election. The GOP will forget that the rule book didn't apply to them when they were in power.
Biden committed to picking a woman, all of the candidates on his list are women, so what's your point?
Yes. Neither Biden nor Trump is articulate, but Biden isn't a racist, xenophobic, misogynistic fascist.
i don't need to because I'm absolutely voting for Joe Biden but a debate with trump might make for highly comical entertainment as Joe would destroy trump in the first 5 minutes!!!
I’m sure everyone is changing their vote to Biden now since they don’t want the dreaded “Dave Smith unfollow and block!”  That’s some major leverage you got their Dave.  Please block me because I’m voting for Trump!  #MAGA #KAG

Does Biden start with extra points?
Donnie, thanks to your incompetence, jobs have disappeared already. Every republican president in last 40 years has made a mess of economy that a democrat president had to clean up. Biden will have even a tougher job.
He sounds drunk. Perhaps it is just the length of this clip. This is his new strategy- attacking Biden on defunding the police. He got checked by Chris Wallace on this very issue.

Biden has betrayed his moderate backers by embracing Sanders’s spending and Warren’s antibusiness bent, writes Phil Gramm  via
NOW LET'S SEE BIDEN DO THAT.
What job in the Biden administration are you gunning for Pete?
Yes - elderly - yes. They’re being lied to by Fox News. And us Biden people still have our humanity. Let’s not lose it.
Consider attending Joe Biden for President’s event, Minnesota Build Back Better Roundtable with former US Attorney General Eric Holder:
Frankly, given Biden’s age, a vote for him is also a vote for his VP candidate to become president. Hope he chooses well.
Minnesota is quickly becoming THE battleground state of 2020!  Biden’s lead is shrinking by the day &amp; now the race is a dead heat!  Proof that Minnesotans are ready to turn MN red, re-elect  AND retire  to her basement for good!Biden is colluding with China!
Totally fair, I don't trust Biden's future cabinet to not start more illegal wars, and they would do so with more stealth and in a way that rallies those gullible enough into believing it's the right thing to do.
U voting for Biden??? Lmao CBM
I have faith in our survival. If Biden really wanted those votes, maybe he should rethink things like his stance on the War on Drugs AKA modern day Jim Crow. One cannot support the war on drugs without also supporting a system that unfairly cracks down on POC.
Trump.  Is having a hard time attacking Joe Biden on any issue. But the Trump campaign is waiting to attack who Biden VP choice. Trump.  Have no plan!
I'm sure as hell not voting for Trump but I'm not convinced Trump beating Biden would absolutely be the ultimate end of America. We are stronger than that, if we have to live through 4 more years of orange, it'll suck, but we will prevail.
Is Biden announcing today? About time. In a nonpandemic time, the Dem convention would have already happened, and we'd have known for weeks.
And also that they can attack Biden for "being senile". There are tons of other things that are WAY more valid to attack Biden on. Plus Trump's insistence that the 1918 pandemic was in 1917 is just... Weird.
Not a good week for a party of young people and the future.  Biden calls a black left leaning report a “junkie” and you go passive aggressive to a PBS reporter  fair question. You both are old cranky relics that need to let young reasonable clever people lead the party.
America.  Let's not for get, it was President Obama and Joe Biden that lead the American people out if the deepest recession in decades, without America never missing a beat. It also was the two of them that stopped what would've been a pandemic in its tracks. Never forget!
Wish Michelle Obama.  Could be Joe Biden VP. no pressure. It would definitely be a blow out ticket! Landslides of all Landslides!
Biden easily. Trump just says insensitive shit. Biden legit has a racist past.
Without Dems in control of the Senate, immigration reform and any number of important issues will continue to languish in Congress.  Bills cannot make it to Pres Biden if they aren't brought up and passed in the Senate.  Vote Blue up and down the ballot.  🌊
By the numbers only, is Biden wrong though? Where does the black vote usually go?
Next is he gonna say Biden’s against air and we’re all gonna suffocate?? 🙄

Trump speaks a lot more but who is saying Trump speaks well lmao. It’s better than Biden tho
I hate Biden but I'm still going to vote for him. Why? Because its going to be biden or trump and I for one don't want another 4 years of that walking shitstain destroying this country.  Also keep in mind its not just biden we are voting for -c-
People need to stop posting things about the shitty stuff Biden has said or done. Yes, we get it, he is not great by any means but crap like that is going to convince people to just not vote and every single vote not for Biden is one less trump needs to worry about.
For real!! This really is peak Biden! He forgot what the actual topic was so he droned on with some stream of consciousness, and called it a wrap!
Biden rarely makes any sense; this time is no exception.
It would be nice if Michelle Obama.  Would be Joe Biden running mate! She would make  a great VP and president!
Marc, I’m distressed about all the folks willing to vote for Trump, too.  We just *must* turn out every Biden voter.  Remind your friends to vote for “down ballot” races, too.  Can’t fix everything without Congress &amp; State Houses on board.  🌊

They didn’t, you know when someone takes that test it’s usually the people around that person that are concerned... trump asked Biden take one... by the way I am sure he already took one anyway...
He is trying to run out the clock.  Strategy seems to think that trump is going to beat himself.  For all trumps flaws exposed by a relentless media. This is exactly the same trump that ran in 2016.  There have been no surprises. Biden will need to stand up to beat him.
Black Total Level approvals strikes me as high for a GOP president.  Are there comparisons for other GOP presidents from Rasmussen?  If the African American vote shifts to Trump, by 5 percentage points or more, it seems like a no win for Biden.  What can Rasmussen share?
How long till that footage ends up in a campaign ad stating it will happen here if Biden wins?
Who’s trump gonna lose to? That bumbling geriatric Biden? Lmfao k.
This seems a significant signal. Of 13 potentials profiled by NYT, only 5 have executive experience: Keisha Bottoms, Gretchen Whitmer, Michelle Grisham, Maggie Hassan &amp; Gina Raimondo.  I'm betting 46¢ Biden invites Keisha to join the campaign.
Joe Biden didn't say thos ignorant
lmao "biden is far left" fuck outta here biden is a republican with a blue tie  liberals are conservatives too, the American political discourse is just mind-bogglingly right-wing
Those people definitely earn higher income than people voting for Hillary/ Biden

Seriously?? Have they completely forgotten 2016? For crying out loud. Am I a big fan of Biden? No. Am I voting for him? HELL yes.
They’re not being careful about hiding their treachery because they expect to be successful and it scares me that they likely will. No Biden lead is big enough to offset their shenanigans.
Already starting with the fiscal responsibility bullshit. They’re practicing so they grind Biden policies to a halt if he wins. Can’t wait to see what they pull when it comes to confirmations as well.
I too was all for someone like Bernie, but #DimWitDon has to go, so I will be voting for Biden.
From June 7
Wow - you don’t know me. I am not a Republican and would never vote for one. I support Medicare for All or a national health plan like my relatives have in the UK. Biden was not my 1st choice but will get my vote in order to get rid of Trump.
If Biden loses it will be because people like you decided that a purity test was more important than ridding this nation of Trump. We have a binary choice this November. Vote for Biden and then keep pushing the progressive agenda.
First, if we’re fact-checking, that’s a photo of Cape Elizabeth, not Yarmouth, behind  during his interview with  Second, intriguing idea that a debate is counter-productive if one candidate lies like Tommy Flanagan on
There are seniors who are buying into the constructed narrative that Biden has dementia. A debate would settle that.
Actually if Joe Biden had been in charge Osama bin Laden would still be alive because he was against the raid that took him out.  Of course Biden has also been wrong about every other major issue during his 40+ years in government.
Better question might be; How many should Biden participate in 0,1,2,or 3 Give us more choices..
Cool. Biden is finna win so no worries

Right.  We won't fall for Senate Republicans' new-found praise for Representative John Lewis.  If Biden is to be successful, we need to replace some Senators:  McConnell, Collins, Graham, Tillis, McSally, Cornyn, etc.  Contribute if you can to

Left and right screaming at each other isn't working.  We need strong bipartisan leadership that represents  all Americans, not just the few who still believe Trump.  He can't be trusted and has to go.  I'm voting for Biden this time.  Proud to be a Biden Republican.
Listen all you math geniuses: Biden = Pro Democracy                Trump = Tyranny                                  In which America do you want live?
We need to replace these Republican Senators.  Without their complicity Trump would not have been able to pull off many of his stunts. A Biden victory will not bring about the change we need (immigration reform, justice reform, etc.) if McConnell is still Senate Leader.  🌊
Biden was the best of the best.  The cream of the crop that rose to the top.
Are you worried that all the dead people will vote for Biden?
I'm a free thinking moderate Conservative who values character.  Trump has no moral compass and has very poor leadership skills.  He's self focused, paranoid and lacks empathy.   I'm voting for Biden.   Proud to be a Biden Republican.
Don't give into your tribal instincts.  We can fix the divisive mess we're in with strong bipartisan leadership.  All views can be heard from which  the best solutions will emerge.  Trump only divides, Biden has unified.  Proud to be a Biden Republican.
i dont like biden but i would rather have an accused rapist in office than a proven one who also handled this situation terribly
I'm just spit-balling here, but I don't think Biden can activate the National Guard?
Since Biden is still within the margin of error in swing states, after a whole lot of centrism in his platform, he should just try a progressive idea, #MedicareForAll for example, and see what happens... he’s gonna try walk it back anyways, even if it polls well.
No write-ins, no third party... unfortunately, this has to be a vote AGAINST Trump, not a vote FOR Biden in order to achieve the goal.
I was a Republican for over 30 years, but left the Party when Trump was nominated.  I dream of a country where Conservatives and Progressives work together to solve our problems.   Trump doesn't, Biden has.  I'm voting for Biden this time.  Proud to be a Biden Republican.

That is not the point. What this video shows is the hypocrisy of Fox News. All of the Fox clips were statements against Biden. If Fox wants to make juvenile jabs at speaking blunders, they should be fair and make the same jabs at Trump.
Not being mentioned so much in response to the claim that Biden will hurt God is Trump’s assertion that under Biden there will be “no anything.” Just complete annihilation of all that exists. Gotta say, I still prefer the taco trucks on every corner but I do see some upsides.

And this right here is why we can't have nice things. Team Obama is trending because somebody said the quiet part out loud about who really owns Biden. But you don't care so long as somebody can lull you to sleep with gentle platitudes and propaganda.
Even if it doesn't matter that much, I do think Biden should wait on an announcement until Trump has committed on Pence.

BIDEN'S HAD SHITS BIGGER THAN GOD HE KILLS TIME WITH HIS BREATHE. THE KRAKEN IS A PIMP
Exactly. You wanna look at politicians who made large contributions to the issues in our community look no further than Biden fam.  He's the one behind mass incarcerations.  Say what you want about Trump, voting for Biden is voting for our own mass incarcerations.
I don't support Trump please stop assuming I like that jackass.  Biden drafted the 94 crime bill which caused mass incarcerations of thousands of black men and did nothing to try and address it.  How much mass incarceration policy has Trump drafted to target black Americans?
You didn't answer the question.  Biden drafted mass incarceration policy which targeted black men and did nothing to fix it.  How much mass incarceration policy has Trump drafted?
Saw a house with a Biden sign and a BLM sign.   Read the damn room.   #denial
Biden drafted the 94 crime bill which caused thousands of black men to be mass incarcerated   How much mass incarceration policy has Trump drafted?
And Biden mass incarcerated thousands. Trump did it with mismanagement of a situation, Biden did his shit intentionally with legislature.  But by all means support the man behind mass incarcerations, some BLM ally you are.
94 crime bill caused many mass incarcerations of black men.  Biden has been a legislator for 30 years since. Why didn't he do his job and draft legislature to address the mass incarcerations he caused?

I expect Trump to debate Biden.  He debated HIllary Clinton.
Biden drafted the 94 crime bill which caused thousands of black men to be mass incarcerated   How much mass incarceration policy has Trump drafted?
Biden has been an elected official for almost 40 years. What meaningful legislature has he drafted besides mass incarceration policy.
Yeah and Biden causes life sentences for non violent drug offenders. Biden did it with legislature, Trump made stupid comments.  let's not act like standing rock protesters weren't gassed during Bidens time as vice president.  What's worse Stupid comments or racist legislature?

Biden is the man responsible for the 94 mass incarceration bill.  Look it up if you don't believe me.  Say what you want about Trump but at least he didn't draft legislature targeting our race for mass incarcerations.
He still has the legal right to do so. And honestly I don't blame him. After Bidens 94 crime bill and recent comments about black voters, fuck Biden.
Or possibly he has considered the outcome for people of color. I personally refuse to vote for Biden because of the 94 crime bill and his lack of effort to address the mass incarcerations he caused.  Trump's an idiot but at least he didn't draft black mass incarcerations.

Joe Biden is bringing back the old timer version of the Democrats that are racist, pro-slavery, pro-segregation and fought in the Civil War to keep things that way.

Biden is Catholic. That's like having a subscription to God+
so  ran a story on  not voting for Biden. Just bc she won't vote for Trump, doesn't mean she would vote for Biden, despite her father's friendship with him. Their political ideologies are different, so of course she would write someone in or something.
I hope everyone realizes that the reason there is so much interest around Biden’s VP pick is that he universally is disliked. And people just want something good to cling to. And this is the guy who is going up against Trump is one of the most important elections ever.
Walter, I think we just need to pray that the Holy Spirit comes running out from backstage and tags into that fight so that Mr. Biden won’t have an upper hand against all three.
Has Biden used cocaine? There might be a good reason he used that reference.
If you still have any respect for Cupp....  UPDATE....ya shouldn't.   If a pundit like her needs any reason to vote for Biden other than the other option is this dangerous madness they are a joke.
I'm voting for Biden, too, but this is tacit admission things are hopeless. Which I guess is fine for you, me,  and Caitlin.
Trump is lying about Joe Biden. Lying remains a sin. It needs to be repudiated by Church leaders in the USA.
Because they are pumping in imaginary money to shore it up long enough for a Democrat to get into office, then they will pull the plug and blame Biden for "tanking the market"  leaving him in a bigger mess. This is all while they use insider trading to build their own personal $$
Biden gets it. Go for God’s knees.
Without COVID, Biden would be a cracker to eat dog food on.  Even Trump's ineptitude and callousness in handling anti-racist unrest wouldn't help Biden if that was all that was going on.
I wonder what his old buddy “Barry” thinks I these comments man Biden is a racist pos dementia or not who says shit like this
Kanye isn’t going to take a single vote from Joe Biden.
I'm fine with Republicans complaining about Biden, they can get in line.
Let’s be honest, this makes Biden sound 100% cooler than he actually is.
If nothing else Biden wants Florida in play  and regardless of what context she said it in or what she says now her previous comments about Cuba and Castro will sink any chances in Florida
He is one desperate man. Waiting for him to say Biden is the devil and that he can walk on water
Shouldn't you be paying your child support instead of fretting over Joe Biden who's mental acuity as far superior to Donald Trump's
He ssys Biden "is going to hurt God" and he wants 4 debates? Do Trumpets not see he is becoming unhinged???
If Biden doesn’t debate he is exhibiting reason he should not be elected - a leader isn’t afraid of a debate stage and America doesn’t need a fearful president.
Take it with a grain of salt, but, well, that's a decent poll for Biden... MN is +18 (!) points.
There’s a pageant-like feeling to this process. In Biden’s frame of mind he’s got it made- he’s the person to join, and he has all these women who want to boost him. Except that narrative has been driven by Biden’s camp and historical precedence.
Warren isn't on the ticket because Сharlie Baker would appoint her replacement and Biden's not dumb enough  to introduce that as a variable when the majority party in the Senate is probably coming back at 50-51 seats. If it's 51 Dems, maaaaybe she gets a cabinet appointment.
Really…it’s really going to come down to the VP pick?   Tell me this, S.E. would you vote for Pence over Biden? If yes, then sit down and be a terribly conflicted Republican who dislikes Trump’s tone, but values Party over Country.   You get to vote again in four years.
Worried about you-- says that Biden is going to hurt you. Please mark yourself safe!
I've never seen Joe Biden punch God. But one night many years ago I did see him beat Jesus at cribbage, so maybe that's what he was talking about...?
That's why I don't get people on both the left and the center-right who say "well maybe Biden if he does (list of my policy preferences)." My first question when choosing a candidate is "are you a garbage person?" And I've used that to rule out Republicans AND Democrats alike.
So after everything Trump is done over $150,000 dead we're losing our global supremacy as China rises  Whether or not you'll vote for Biden comes down to his VP pick  You are part of the problem
if you vote for anyone other than joe biden you’re voting for this fat loser❤️
Headline in the NY Post tomorrow. BIDEN KILLS GOD! ALL HOPE GONE!
I understand that those are the key reasons that Bernie doesn’t appeal to older white moderates but they’ve deliberately ignored every red flag of Biden’s to a level that borders on delusion. This man is horrible at speaking and shows symptoms of dementia
I’d vote for a Biden/Carrot ticket. 2020 is not the year to fucking quibble over the VP selection.  JFC-don’t you get it yet?
New York AG seeks to dissolve NRA in new lawsuit! Not hiding their TRUE AGENDA any longer! If you are a Democrat Gun Owner, you may get a HUGE surprise, should the worst scenario happen and Biden wins! GOD Forbid!
Biden looks like a wounded animal. The wolves are hungary.
He did it on purpose to divide the Dem vote so it was easier for Biden to slide in there. He had no intention of winning he just stirred the pot up a little
Trump believes he is God  Biden beating Trump would hurt Trump  Therefore, Biden would hurt God
"It’s these guys, with their habits and histories that have never really been held against them, and the fact that they are still somehow the ones weighing women’s political and personal value as the fate of the nation hangs in the balance." 🔥
Biden doesn't have to do anything  When your opponent, like Trump, is busy hitting himself in the balls you just stand aside and let him continue.
This is a very good point. And why Joe Biden is a stronger candidate in this election than many of us give him credit for. The attacks fall flat.
Biden's Antifa handlers will close it down soon enough
Found something Biden may be able to defeat in a debate. 🤣
It's weird how much power Joe Biden has, that he can hurt God. Imagine what he could have done back when he was in his prime! :)
I say the same thing.  I also said the same thing with Bernie.  Bernie has been a legislator for almost as long as Biden. He's another one of the elected officials who does do Jackshit.
Has Biden clarified whether he is against God?
Oh No, Is Joe Biden Going To Spank The Lord Right On The Bottom?!
Oh thank you, Trump, for letting me know.  I didn’t know that Biden was was going to hurt God. That doesn’t sound very nice.  And here I was going to vote for him..... 🙄🤬😳

listening to your segment on Michele Obama's podcast and Joe Biden's empathy, hope and our grief. I want to say thank you for this necessary conversation. I'm feeling some of my stress loosen it's grasp as I listen. And it feels good🤗 Thank you.
Are we going to pretend like #Schmuckerberg isn't TRYING to get the #CovidiotInChief #TraitorTrump re-elected? 🤨
Bautista was a Progressive Catholic. Biden reminds me of the feckless progressive, who turned over Cuba to an Authoritarian Communist Regime.
I bet Biden wouldn't hold it upside down.
if this is true (unclear) i will be pledging my vote for joseph clancy biden in this years election
If you believe in the traditional, Christian, omnipotent God, I can confidently tell you that nothing Joe Biden is capable of will hurt it.  Or, if he can, you should probably pledge your allegiance because DAMN.
Joe prefers belittling blacks as often as possible. "What you all know, but most people don't know, unlike the African American community with notable exceptions, the Latino community is incredibly diverse, with incredibly different attitudes about different things." -Joe Biden
Trump still has the votes of the gullible and easily conned - they’re incredibly low hanging fruit for a guy like him.  I’ll give you that.    The rest of America plans to vote for Biden.
They are all bad choices, however, one of them is notably worse than all the others. I hate this. I hated it when people went all Anti-Bush for political reasons, but I think this time is different. Biden (and the rest) are a bad choice, but Trump is a colossally bad choice.
My sentiments exactly. Can't fix anything until we put a pause on the downward spiral were being dragged through.   This is the part that makes me so frustrated to see libs/progs push so much anti Biden/anti left stuff...like we can totally deal with that starting 1pm on 1-20-21
Our future President and a good flavor of his values and thoughts  Joe Biden: I'm a Democrat and I love John McCain - YouTube
I am voting for him because he says Biden hates God and the Bible.
I honestly don't listen to anything he says...because him, Trump, and Bernie are like 3 versions of the same person and I can't with the ancient white man bullshit.   I'm just hoping Biden picks a VP that's decent and then resigns or something so she can be president. 🤞
Biden will be destroying God shortly so the fireballs from the sky during armageddon should do the trick
Joe Biden is going to..."hurt the Bible?" Huh? He's just throwing scary words out there now. Biden eats children, vote for me!
But heads up to the left, this is what they're going to do to Biden and a Democratic Congress. They're going to throw accusations as if they weren't guilty of far worse for 4 years. Don't have a short memory. But that doesn't mean President Biden shouldn't be held accountable.
Was Biden's comment wrong? Yup. But it's laughable to watch Republicans try to act like an interview slip is the same thing as 4 years of ongoing evil from Trump. "Gotcha" only works if one side isn't basically Satan.
If you vote for Biden, then you are truly a fake.. stop pretending. 🙄
Ahh yes, devout Catholic Joe Biden
I doubt that God is worried about Joe Biden hurting him.
Biden’s running mate is critical AF, because he’ll need to step down... and they will need to take the reins.
why isn’t this on the first page of yahoo?
What’s funny is all of these clips are about Biden. But they definitely apply to both candidates
Trump claiming Biden has the power to hurt god is an incredible self own.
Joe Biden coming to Attack and Dethrone God confirmed
Trump always makin Biden sound rad af. 😈🔥
Serious question: why do you think Biden seems to be taking Harris more seriously than Warren, if reports are to be believed? What does she *possibly* offer that others don't/can't? (I know my answer but I'm trying to hear more).
How’s Biden gonna take away all our guns when they said Obama was going to also
Top conservative discourse - the most powerful figure in the world claiming Biden can hurt god himself 😂
Does he mention how Biden will go about hurting the supposed all-powerful creator of the universe?
Man Trump’s Biden is WAY cooler than Real Biden
Biden can't change the Constitution even if he wanted to.  And even a re-interpretation can't be done without the courts.

I’m Biden all the way, but I don’t like the shady DFL practices in MN races.  I’ll be voting against the DFL endorsed, overly “progressive” candidates.
Some eye popping polling this afternoon. Lindsey Graham is *underperforming* Trump in SC (that Senate race is dead even). Among white 4 year college graduates in Maine, Biden leads Trump 77-19.
How is any Evangelical okay with this?  Joe Biden will "hurt the Bible, hurt God," Trump says in Ohio of his practicing Catholic opponent. "He's against God."
Twin Cities media, and local racers, awfully quiet about Joe Biden saying all black people think the same. Nothing from local republican cucks who appear as controlled opposition on Almanac or At Issue either (go figure!). Maybe  is working on a big story for tomorrow?
"Scoring sympathy otherwise" has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not you "came in with an ending in mind"—and as you just said, you have "always" held Biden in contempt, which sure as shit *sounds* like you had a specific "ending in mind" here.  Take the L, my man.  2/2
Maybe there are too many giving massive amounts of excuses for the Left and Biden. And yet, stick their noses in the air for Trump.  Btw John, are you supporting a presidential candidate? I haven't seen anything from you. Is it an integrity thing(😂)?
I'm not taking anything out of context here, genius, and you wouldn't be bleating "Don't tell me to grow up!" if you didn't know that you kinda need to.  You don't give two shits about Biden's "racism" at all. I don't know why you feel the need to lie like this.
Biden also took a shot at Trump's personal history with money.  via
Watch: Biden says he wouldn't stand in the way of a Trump prosecution
The world where you have Google at your fingertips and you have been tweeting about Biden regularly:   I am saying *exactly* what I already said, Mike, and I am well aware of the "context" of your "remarks." Everyone is. Take the L like an adult.
The Left: Actively organizing mutual aid, advocating for social justice, doom scrolling to hell and back. Biden's camp: WE GOT A GOOD IDEA
I kinda doubt you'd "already seen that" &amp; I know I never claimed he "had your vote"—the claim I actually made was that Biden's stutter is old news &amp; there's no good reason to attack that rather than the things he says, esp. if you care about "racism" which you obviously don't 2/2
Mike, *you* focused on it, and *you* made a claim—it's at the very top of this thread.  I *did* back it up, and then you insisted that my "back up" doesn't count, and anyway, you're more focused on Biden's "racism," which is clearly a lie. Why are you doing this?  1/2
If your "real issue with Biden" were actually that "he's a racist," then the content of this speech would matter A LOT, since Biden's discussing and defending his work on the '94 crime bill—if you *actually* gave a shit about "racism," that would matter to you.  And yet...  2/2
I'm going to vote for him to protect this country from the fascist circus peanut and his administration and more conservative judges, but I'm also going to continue to hold Biden accountable and voice my displeasure about his policies and actions if it requires it.Biden is colluding with China!
Totally fair, I don't trust Biden's future cabinet to not start more illegal wars, and they would do so with more stealth and in a way that rallies those gullible enough into believing it's the right thing to do.
U voting for Biden??? Lmao CBM
I have faith in our survival. If Biden really wanted those votes, maybe he should rethink things like his stance on the War on Drugs AKA modern day Jim Crow. One cannot support the war on drugs without also supporting a system that unfairly cracks down on POC.
I'm sure as hell not voting for Trump but I'm not convinced Trump beating Biden would absolutely be the ultimate end of America. We are stronger than that, if we have to live through 4 more years of orange, it'll suck, but we will prevail.
Is Biden announcing today? About time. In a nonpandemic time, the Dem convention would have already happened, and we'd have known for weeks.
And also that they can attack Biden for "being senile". There are tons of other things that are WAY more valid to attack Biden on. Plus Trump's insistence that the 1918 pandemic was in 1917 is just... Weird.
Not a good week for a party of young people and the future.  Biden calls a black left leaning report a “junkie” and you go passive aggressive to a PBS reporter  fair question. You both are old cranky relics that need to let young reasonable clever people lead the party.
Biden easily. Trump just says insensitive shit. Biden legit has a racist past.
Without Dems in control of the Senate, immigration reform and any number of important issues will continue to languish in Congress.  Bills cannot make it to Pres Biden if they aren't brought up and passed in the Senate.  Vote Blue up and down the ballot.  🌊
You think Trump’s bad, wait until you hear Biden try and speak.
Biden cheers abortions. That’s super catholic of him.
Next is he gonna say Biden’s against air and we’re all gonna suffocate?? 🙄
We deserve better than Trump &amp; Biden! #UNITY2020 is on a mission to draft a President &amp; VP to unite the country. This is neither a spoiler campaign nor a 3rd party ticket. Learn more and get on the email list here:    Let's take back our republic!
If a God can be hurt by Joe Biden, is he really a God?
Trump. No?  Biden?
hey Pete, Biden wants to get rid the 2nd amendment?  He is a gun owner right now. Has Trump ever been a fun owner?
Trump speaks a lot more but who is saying Trump speaks well lmao. It’s better than Biden tho
I hate Biden but I'm still going to vote for him. Why? Because its going to be biden or trump and I for one don't want another 4 years of that walking shitstain destroying this country.  Also keep in mind its not just biden we are voting for -c-
People need to stop posting things about the shitty stuff Biden has said or done. Yes, we get it, he is not great by any means but crap like that is going to convince people to just not vote and every single vote not for Biden is one less trump needs to worry about.
Biden is definitely the radical left
All veterans. All Republicans. All in for Biden.
For real!! This really is peak Biden! He forgot what the actual topic was so he droned on with some stream of consciousness, and called it a wrap!
Biden rarely makes any sense; this time is no exception.
Marc, I’m distressed about all the folks willing to vote for Trump, too.  We just *must* turn out every Biden voter.  Remind your friends to vote for “down ballot” races, too.  Can’t fix everything without Congress &amp; State Houses on board.  🌊

Must Read!  James Comey Wrote a Letter in 2016. What Will Bill Barr Do?
They didn’t, you know when someone takes that test it’s usually the people around that person that are concerned... trump asked Biden take one... by the way I am sure he already took one anyway...
He is trying to run out the clock.  Strategy seems to think that trump is going to beat himself.  For all trumps flaws exposed by a relentless media. This is exactly the same trump that ran in 2016.  There have been no surprises. Biden will need to stand up to beat him.
Black Total Level approvals strikes me as high for a GOP president.  Are there comparisons for other GOP presidents from Rasmussen?  If the African American vote shifts to Trump, by 5 percentage points or more, it seems like a no win for Biden.  What can Rasmussen share?
How long till that footage ends up in a campaign ad stating it will happen here if Biden wins?
This seems a significant signal. Of 13 potentials profiled by NYT, only 5 have executive experience: Keisha Bottoms, Gretchen Whitmer, Michelle Grisham, Maggie Hassan &amp; Gina Raimondo.  I'm betting 46¢ Biden invites Keisha to join the campaign.
lmao "biden is far left" fuck outta here biden is a republican with a blue tie  liberals are conservatives too, the American political discourse is just mind-bogglingly right-wing
I don’t wanna hear anyone talk about Joe Biden’s speaking problems
Those people definitely earn higher income than people voting for Hillary/ Biden
Joe Biden's plan for universal preschool forgets key to children's success: Parents.  via
But let’s be honest, everyone on the campaign wishes Trump would stop talking because every interview provides endless footage for Biden and Lincoln to use in their ads
This is the New Democratic Party allowing this to happen. Biden is their puppet.
Seriously?? Have they completely forgotten 2016? For crying out loud. Am I a big fan of Biden? No. Am I voting for him? HELL yes.
They’re not being careful about hiding their treachery because they expect to be successful and it scares me that they likely will. No Biden lead is big enough to offset their shenanigans.
Already starting with the fiscal responsibility bullshit. They’re practicing so they grind Biden policies to a halt if he wins. Can’t wait to see what they pull when it comes to confirmations as well.
I too was all for someone like Bernie, but #DimWitDon has to go, so I will be voting for Biden.
From June 7
Wow - you don’t know me. I am not a Republican and would never vote for one. I support Medicare for All or a national health plan like my relatives have in the UK. Biden was not my 1st choice but will get my vote in order to get rid of Trump.
If Biden loses it will be because people like you decided that a purity test was more important than ridding this nation of Trump. We have a binary choice this November. Vote for Biden and then keep pushing the progressive agenda.
First, if we’re fact-checking, that’s a photo of Cape Elizabeth, not Yarmouth, behind  during his interview with  Second, intriguing idea that a debate is counter-productive if one candidate lies like Tommy Flanagan on
There are seniors who are buying into the constructed narrative that Biden has dementia. A debate would settle that.
Actually if Joe Biden had been in charge Osama bin Laden would still be alive because he was against the raid that took him out.  Of course Biden has also been wrong about every other major issue during his 40+ years in government.
Better question might be; How many should Biden participate in 0,1,2,or 3 Give us more choices..
The black people are waking up to the truth that Trump actually helps them while the Democrats just say they will help them while using them. Clinton’s are case in point. Biden is a tool and can’t complete a full sentence
Cool. Biden is finna win so no worries
I just signed a  petition to  and  calling on them to include ending marijuana prohibition in their campaign platforms. Sign here:
Yah right your FAKE POLLS Biden cannot even fill up a School Classroom while the Pres can fill up a Dallas Stadium That's why the Democrats are hiding him in the basement .the Pres will destroy ALZHEIMER'S Biden in the Debate and that's the TRUTH your sources are all Democrats .
I completely agree. That is why when Republicans keep calling Joe Biden “Sleepy Joe”, I tell them that after almost 4 years of the waking nightmare that is Donald Trump we’re tired. We could use a nap.

If Kamala gets picked as Biden's VP will she drop her stances of legalizing weed and Medicare for all?
The election is already a cluster fuck. It’s only going to get worse. Biden will refuse to debate. Votes will get lost. My dead uncle will be voting democrat.
I do support Biden as the better of the two options available, yes.  Not my first choice. Do you really think some stranger on the Internet calling me mentally disabled matters to me? That’s hilarious. I feel safe pretty much everywhere thanks but thanks for the concern.
Right.  We won't fall for Senate Republicans' new-found praise for Representative John Lewis.  If Biden is to be successful, we need to replace some Senators:  McConnell, Collins, Graham, Tillis, McSally, Cornyn, etc.  Contribute if you can to

Left and right screaming at each other isn't working.  We need strong bipartisan leadership that represents  all Americans, not just the few who still believe Trump.  He can't be trusted and has to go.  I'm voting for Biden this time.  Proud to be a Biden Republican.
We need to replace these Republican Senators.  Without their complicity Trump would not have been able to pull off many of his stunts. A Biden victory will not bring about the change we need (immigration reform, justice reform, etc.) if McConnell is still Senate Leader.  🌊
Biden was the best of the best.  The cream of the crop that rose to the top.
Are you worried that all the dead people will vote for Biden?
I'm a free thinking moderate Conservative who values character.  Trump has no moral compass and has very poor leadership skills.  He's self focused, paranoid and lacks empathy.   I'm voting for Biden.   Proud to be a Biden Republican.
Don't give into your tribal instincts.  We can fix the divisive mess we're in with strong bipartisan leadership.  All views can be heard from which  the best solutions will emerge.  Trump only divides, Biden has unified.  Proud to be a Biden Republican.
i dont like biden but i would rather have an accused rapist in office than a proven one who also handled this situation terribly
I'm just spit-balling here, but I don't think Biden can activate the National Guard?
Since Biden is still within the margin of error in swing states, after a whole lot of centrism in his platform, he should just try a progressive idea, #MedicareForAll for example, and see what happens... he’s gonna try walk it back anyways, even if it polls well.
No write-ins, no third party... unfortunately, this has to be a vote AGAINST Trump, not a vote FOR Biden in order to achieve the goal.
I was a Republican for over 30 years, but left the Party when Trump was nominated.  I dream of a country where Conservatives and Progressives work together to solve our problems.   Trump doesn't, Biden has.  I'm voting for Biden this time.  Proud to be a Biden Republican.
So... If you look at the tweets and statements by  He has consistently, rightly and wrongly, said, "Obama Bad, Biden Slow and Bad" so look in your Conservative mirror and see that this is what we as a society have driven the political discourse to become.
Hollywood created a feel-good moment at the Oscars where Joe Biden spoke about victims of molestation, rape &amp; respecting boundaries! Molested as a kid, it was painful to watch. Google "creepy Joe", see what he has done to people not reported by mainstream media! F*** Hollywood!YES,SOMETHING SMELLS. THE LIE HOUSE MUST BE FUMIGATED N THEN FUMIGATED N THEN FUMIGATED AND trumps REPULSIVE STINK MIGHT BE A LITTLE EASIER FOR BIDEN TO HANDLE WHEN HE ENTER INTO THE WHITE HOUSE AFTER WINNING THE 2020 ELECTION.

SHAMEFUL THAT Sens. JOHNSON &amp; GRAHAM spreading FAKE NEWS from Russia on Joe Biden.
We have huge problems in this country right now...Biden’s gaffes do not fall into the category of a problem. 🤨
Here is the fact. Biden will select the person who he thinks will help him win the election. I’m completely satisfied with all of the women currently on the short list. I’ll support whoever is selected. That said I prefer Sen Harris.
I hope he gets a pardon from President Biden.

How stupid do you have to be to let almost 160,000 people die on your watch because you didn’t adequately address or prepare for the pandemic and still not understand what you have to do??! We can’t afford to have Presidents be this dangerously stupid and incompetent. Vote Biden.
Obama’s new endorsement of progressive causes will please the base, but it also makes it harder for Biden to appeal to moderate and independent voters, writes
It’s a center of Mideast conflict.  Any president who can’t find it on a map after their first two weeks should immediately be fired. I’m also sure he couldn’t (this should be a Biden debate tactic BTW, yank a map out of his pocket and ask the president directly).
We know a lot of former Republicans who are voting for Biden. Jim is not alone. #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica
Trump's actions make clear he believes Latinxs should be treated as second-class citizens.    knows when the Latinx community succeeds we all succeed. His agenda will empower Latinxs in Minnesota and make them true partners in charting our future.

Biden is the reset we need on COVID and he is 70,000 lives away, by Andy Slavitt
Hey, um, Bernie:  You or your staff should have deleted this one.  Not that I care anymore, but if you are trying to sell Biden, this ain't the way to do it.  All of us can do a top ten Trump sucks list.  Make a GOOD top ten list for Biden without mentioning Trump.  I'll wait.
Biden doesn’t need to say another word between now and the election and he’ll still trounce Trump.   All Biden has to do is sit back and let Trump dig his own political grave by opening his mouth and saying the stupidest shit possible to know he’s not a leader.
I take it as a given that Biden will, as Obama and to a slightly lesser extent Clinton did, normalize the excesses of the previous administration.  Does anyone genuinely think that the winning team is going to just give up executive powers used by the previous administration?
Repeat after me:  I will do my homework and decide for myself what I think of Joe Biden's VP pick.  I will tell anyone who instructs me to do otherwise to fuck off.
Rice would get pelted for being one of the Libya intervention architects.  Biden's entire short list is women with huge liabilities.
Asking for some furry feline friends...can 😺 vote, too?
It’s not a shortage of workers problem. It’s a top management problem which Biden can fix with a pen stroke.
THAT'S BULLSHIT 7 WOMAN ACCUSING BIDEN. LETS SEE SOME FACT!!      ITS,FACT trump RAPED A 13 YR OLD GIRL       IT'S FACT trump PAYS WOMAN TO KEEP QUIET        IT'S FACT trump BRAGGED ABOUT SNEAKING INTO A GIRLS LOCKER ROOM         IT'S FACT trump IS A SEX PERVERT
What progress? I can’t think of anything trump has done that is progress. I hope it all goes away. That’s why we vote Biden 2020
That map of voters it entirely faulse, I know that beacus Biden won every county in Minnesota and Beto wasn’t even in the ballot, I would know I voted.
I'M FOR BIDEN CAUSE HE DIDN'T PROMUSE TO RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS N  DIDN'T I'M FOR BIDEN CAUSE HE DIDN'T PROMISE MEXICO WOULD PAY, N THEY DIDN'T I'M FOR BIDEN CAUSE HE DIDN'T PROMISE TO REPLACE OBAMACARE N  DIDN'T I'M FOR BIDEN CAUSE HE DIDN'T PROMISE TO ERASE NAT'L DEBT N DIDN'T
“It would be a huge relief to Trump if he doesn’t get re-elected, let Biden continue to run the country into the ground and divide us all. Trump needs a break from all the criticism.”
Who will Biden choose?
VP pick will have zero impact on that. Far more important for progressive causes is to flip the Senate. Biden will sign progressive legislation if it reaches his desk. He’s no fool. But the most progressive president won’t accomplish anything with a GOP senate.
We’ve been waiting, Donnie, but frankly if after 3.5 years of your watch we are in a depression, dying of a plague, and in the midsts of rampant racism perhaps it’s time for a change. So I guess it’s Biden’s turn. Vote Biden 2020.
BIDEN HAS NEVER BEEN CHARGED WITH RAPING A 13 YR OLD. BIDEN HAS  NEVER BRAGGED ABOUT SNEAKING INTO A GIRLS LOCKER ROOM UNANNOUNCED. BIDEN NEVER FELT UP HIS DAUGHTER ON TV. DON'T PUT BIDEN N THAT SEX REVERT trump IN THE SAME SENTENCE.
I HOPE BIDEN PICKS KAMALA HARRIS A MOST QUALIFIED PERSON AND DOESN'T PICK  SOME  TURKEY SURPRISE.
I’m voting for Biden and his running mate NO MATTER WHAT! #YesWeCanAgain
You don’t know when to keep my our mouth shut.  Daddy said he would date his daughter, has 20 valid accusations of sexual assault including rape, has his DNA on a dress, has had multiple affairs with women while still married.  Sorry Sonny-you are clueless but this helps Biden.
No, Biden will raise YOUR taxes and that if other billionaires that you helped with your tax bill.  Do you really need all that money?  Former Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton raised taxes on the wealthy, including himself, paid back money to schools and left a reserve.  Try it....
If they debated, many people would say Biden was admired greatly and it would be the most amazing thing- no one else had ever thought of it and in 2 weeks, all would know the wonder of it
Yes, because I plan to enjoy rubbing it in the Trumpsters’ faces when Biden kicks his ass out of office.
I hope President Biden has a spot for him. A real patriot!

A vote for anyone other than Biden is a vote for Trump.  Don’t vote 3rd party. You are wasting your vote and subjecting our country to 4 more years of the most dangerous unstable racist modern president we have ever had in history. Trump must go. Vote Biden. Don’t fuck this up.
Yes I will still vote Biden. But why not debate ? A semi-verbal 7 thgrader could crush Trump.
The black people are waking up to the truth that Trump actually helps them while the Democrats just say they will help them while using them. Clinton’s are case in point. Biden is a tool and can’t complete a full sentence
Why are they so keen on creating a drama? Remember what happened in 2016? This is not the time to divide the 🌊 wave. Kamala is more than qualified. Unless you’re so afraid of a Black woman becoming POTUS, should something happen to Biden 🤔
would be lucky to have Harris on the ticket. And if she's ambitious, so what? Biden, I believe, has indicated he will likely only serve one term. Please examine your biases. You've done the Dems a disfavor by badmouthing someone on a stellar VP short list.
Joe Biden for president
It's either Joe or Trump. Those are the only choices. I'm not a Biden fan either, but 1 rape allegation is not as bad as 30 rape allegations, charges for pedophilia and outspoken white supremacy. Choice between the 2 is clear.  We have to get Trump out. Then work on progress.

I probably would but I would be wearing my Biden face mask.

Yep... they’re excited over a ham sandwich while kicking the majority of their constituents in the giblets. Even after Biden wins, the battle will not be over.
I agree. Susan Rice isn’t a politician. For VP we need someone with political skills and experience such as Harris. Susan Rice is an ideal choice for Secretary of State where her vast foreign policy experience will be most helpful to President Biden.
If Joe Biden wants to lead, he needs to specifically decry the violence in Portland and Seattle and call on local officials to stop it, writes
In an ideal world, her criticism (“attacks”) of Biden would make her a valuable asset to his presidency bc she’d hold him accountable instead of being a sycophant.
This is bonkers. We need someone able and willing to step in at any moment. Hell, yes, she’d better want to be president. Who thinks Biden will even be alive to run for a second term? Good grief.
And Biden will move them back.
If you hear Joe Biden promise to do something “on Day 1” if he wins, can we make it Day 2 so we can all get a good night’s sleep first?
Biden doesn’t need a swing state if he picks a candidate that’s right for this moment. Rice helps carry Virgina and states through the south + Midwest. I like Harris but understand why the campaign may have hurt their relationship. The GOPs urgent scar tissue is self-inflicted.
We are on a powerful path to universal care and coverage, amplified by #COVID19. Our health care systems have failed, and the reform we need done will take hard work to overcome the roadblocks and barriers the GOP continues to put in front of us.
NOTHING could be worse than what now resides in the WH. I’ll vote for Biden even if he picks Rosie O’Donnell

Hollywood created a feel-good moment at the Oscars where Joe Biden spoke about victims of molestation, rape &amp; respecting boundaries! Molested as a kid, it was painful to watch. Google "creepy Joe", see what he has done to people not reported by mainstream media! F*** Hollywood!Stolen from brilliant  :   Joe Biden: “just pick any black woman.  They all think and act the same anyway”.
We have huge problems in this country right now...Biden’s gaffes do not fall into the category of a problem. 🤨
I hope he gets a pardon from President Biden.
Exactly. I am convinced the "pick is in".  It would be a glorious weekend for many if Biden made his pick known today.

This attempt by GOP operatives to get Kanye on the ballot to dilute the Biden vote is so reprehensible on 2 counts. It smacks of demeaning, racist assumptions about Black voters, &amp; manipulates &amp; exploits a person who is in the midst of a recently disclosed mental health crisis.
Your weaseling claims are all based on stoking up fear. Biden will not take any guns, hes forgot more about the Bible than you have ever known, and he has empathy and compassion for the downtrodden. Words you are totally unfamiliar with. You’ll find words like that in the Bible.
Joe Biden: "most people don't know, unlike the African American community with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community, with incredibly different attitudes about different things"
If a God can be hurt by Joe Biden, is he really a God?

Seeing VP Biden in action will change a lot of minds!
Good platform for Biden imo
Someone should remind him of that pic of Joe Biden in a church, praying, that his campaign doctored.
yeah kinda funny - all Trumps ads misuse Biden photos where he's actually PRAYING. I've never seen this clown bow his head in prayer.  Yet I still know some evangelicals that think there was a prophecy  saying Trump was called by God to the WH.  Not by MY God that's for sure...

All veterans. All Republicans. All in for Biden.

Biden is just politicizing this, he isn't actually thinking this is the right way to handle it.  No, we shouldn't mandate from the federal government.
Wonders, since she’s Biden’s new assistant, if she’ll have to change his depends and wipe his ass..
I understand that POV, however, I think I’m just more optimistic. Parties move with public opinion, and public opinion on climate change action, health care, and other topics is shifting drastically. If Biden doesn’t act on his promises, I promise in 2024 I’ll be on your side.
Wonders, since she’s Biden’s new assistant, if she will have to change his depends and wipe his ass..
I personally think the way to go about it isn’t a hashtag that will fall off the trending tab by morning. I believe the way to do that is to get a man willing to change into office (Biden in this case), then use the power of our base to get change done.
Wonders since she’s become Biden’s assistant, if she will have to change his depends and wipe his ass..
Well, not all politicians are the same. Politicians are receptive to ideas which fit with their party. Biden was receptive to change in terms of Gay Marriage, Criminal Justice, Climate Change, and Health Care. Trump wouldn’t capitulate on any of those issues no matter what.

Sorry, but Kamala nor Biden are transphobic, I’ve done extensive research on their lgbtq stances, and I can say with 100% certainty they will protect transgender rights and appoint Supreme Court justices which fight lgbtq discrimination
This is where we differ, because I’m a bit more optimistic. I’m hopeful that with a different cabinet, a president that is quite liberal compared to previous ones, and public pressure from BLM, we could actually see some change. And if they don’t, Biden will be gone in 4 years.

Of course, one might not expect the candidate to appearing with Biden in the same place at all. Good ol' 2020.
Yea but these riots started under Obama same with the kids being in cages. Syria's civil war was also started under Obama's watch as well. Not to mention Joe Biden wants to defund social security, Medicare and medicaid the proof is in his entire political career. Look it up.
Joe Biden is such a racist that he doesn’t know when he’s making a racist statement..
Do you have any evidence that Trump’s policy is better for the black population that Biden’s? Biden has dozens of pages of carefully thought out antiracist policies on his website. Trump has nothing I could find. Quotes don’t matter, policy and goals do.
This letter doesn’t advocate for a particular Black woman. We are not interchangeable! Do I want to see Black women lead? YES! Do I want Black women in positions of power? YES! But this further tokenizes the Black women Biden IS considering.Its not the solidarity they think it is
If the states are so independent, then I’m sure Biden would have no impact on the unrest if he was elected.

A vote for Biden is really a vote for Michelle.  They know that too.
Joe Biden has been saying he wants to defund social security, Medicare and Medicaid and disability his entire political career. So whats your point? How will things get any better with Joe Biden when he is just part of the problem? If you don't believe me do some research.
Lmao did you know that Joe Biden also wants to defund Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Yet you sheep still believe he will change our country for the better. Face it the two party system isn't working. Also the proof is in Joe Biden's entire political career.
Biden has no policy? Dude, check his website. He has hundreds of pages of plans and policies he would implement. I won’t continue arguing unless you can admit to basic truths of reality
Hopefully trump wins because if Joe Biden wins we will lose social security and Medicare and Medicaid because he wants to defund all 3 of them to pay for his illegal immigrants and their votes. The cartel problem will only get worse with a Democrat in office.
Whenever I hear someone calling Biden a racist, it’s always because he said something stupid. He isn’t a good speaker, and he has a stutter; however, those embarrassing moments don’t define his worldview. You’re waist deep in the water and acting like you’ve explored the ocean.
This is exactly what I’m talking about. Have you ever looked at Biden’s policy? Have you ever listened to what he wants to do without looking through a tinted lens? Have you stopped looking at the juicy snippets and looked into his current states beliefs?
Joe Biden is more corrupted than Trump will ever be. He also wants to defund social security and Medicare and Medicaid. He has been saying that for most of his political career.
Y’all talk about his deep past, but never about his recent history with racial ideologies. I wonder why I’ve never seen a Trump supporter judge Biden’s policy 🤔
Joe Biden is unfit and a terrible canidate for president.  Change my mind, oh, and you can't use the word Trump
He doesn’t have to accept the results, like we give a damn, but he WILL HAVE TO GET HIS BIG ASS UP OUT OF THE PEOPLES HOUSE! President Biden already confirmed after his inauguration the IDIOT would be drug out the WH kicking and screaming like the coward he is if he try’s that BS
Biden won't be their candidate come election time anyway.
Well since Biden is such a shoe in. There’s no need for the democrats to get out of their parents basement. They can just sleep in &amp; party on November 3rd..
Analysis | Trump campaign ad manipulates three images to put Biden in a ‘basement’
He better not. Voting will be easier here than in some other places and for every Minnesota farm with a Trump sign in the front yard, there are 10,000 residents in the Twin Cities who will vote Biden.
And Joe Biden is the confused one?
Trump slammed for hypocrisy after saying Biden is 'against God' - U.S. News -
#IntelligenceReports So Russia is working against Biden. China is working against Trump. Guess which one Trump will do something about.
Top GOP senators give Trump the Biden probe he got impeached for trying to force on Ukraine #SmartNews
Well, I don’t love either; however, at least Biden actually has a solid written plan on issues such as LGBTQ rights, Climate Change, and improving health care to some degree. When we equate Biden with Trump, we accept them as equals, when one is clearly better.
Joe Biden’s VP pick
IKR .. Takes a lot of emotional intelligence to come up with that kind of response.  Such a great communicator, he could write for Biden.
#Election2020 Is Trump saying that Biden wants to put God on the disabled list?
Tough piece. To be sure, we libs know that y'all be attacking Biden on Day One. It is just a political alliance of convenience now. Even the #MSNBC GOP pundit class will return to attacking tan suits-- or sunglasses very soon.
Amen, Phil. And just as importantly, Biden will restore honesty to the White House. And hopefully sychophants like Higgins and his lying GOP colleagues will all be voted out of office.
They were not drugs they retested the substance and it wasn’t drugs but they are still trying to say she resisted arrest. Crooked Sheriffs Department! They need a FBI patterns and practices investigation after Biden wins this November!
He ordered federal agents to beat up and pepper spray priests and peaceful protestors so he could have a campaign photo op holding a Bible upside down outside a church that didn't want him there.  Now he thinks he has the "God" vote? Pathetic.
that’s just not reality. I’m sorry, but you gotta look beyond your media and social bubble and view exterior evidence. Look into Biden’s actual policy and judge it for yourself. Look into how actual socialists hate him for his middling approach. He’s not who you portray him as.
Biden is a very, very moderate Democrat. As a progressive, I can promise you he’s not a socialist at all, and it’s unfair to disregard his policy and generalize him with truly brutal dictators who hid under the name of communism
We need Biden signs.  I can probably give out at least 30 in my little precinct in Eagan.
When I hear the cable pundits, who weren't on Joe Biden's side when these primaries started, now say such glowing things about him, I just shout "I told you so!"  He IS the perfect candidate for this election and lot of us knew that. #deadlinewhitehouse
Biden has the power to hurt God?
#Election2020 The Yo Semite and Thighland guy thinks that Joe Biden is the one who can't keep it together.
Lad, are you calling Joe Biden a fat junkie?   At this rate i wouldnt be surprised if you claimed Joe is secretly Xi Jinping in a thin-suit. Y’all are weird istg
If Joe Biden can hurt God then he can probably will COVID-19 away using mind powers so he definitely has my vote.
This is exactly right. It's not Biden's job to put Trump in jail, and it's not his job to keep him out of jail.
We all know you don't have the balls to debate Biden.  But please proceed with these hissy fits.  It's hilarious. #Biden2020The most frustrating part is that they agree that Biden is trash and still think that he deserves their vote. My hardest lefty friend even agrees with me that Obama sucked. Yet somehow still thinks Trump is worse.
Yep, they did it deceptively to make it sound worse than it was because trust me, they won't report the Q3 numbers the same way; although they will report the Q4 numbers to make them look ridiculously good if Biden wins.
Want to know what’s actually happening in the suburbs? HOMEMADE Biden/Harris signs! This one went up today a few doors down from  and me in Apple Valley, MN #BidenHarris2020 #Suburbanhousewife
So if everything needs changing why hasnt career politician Joe Biden done anything??   Why is it Trumps fault career politicians haven’t been successful?  Maybe because they have other agendas?  Hmmmm.
Nah, he'll just use the Obama strategy and only hold pressers every 3 months.  But he handles the hostile media pretty well, and when he has a stroke it will be long after his second term.  Biden may have already had one.
Maybe Trump should adopt the Biden model:  only call on friendly press with pre-approved questions.  No, Trump is smart enough and courageous enough to take this shit from a hostile media on a daily basis.
I'd like to hear Biden answer ANY tough question.
Does your daughter need a lock?  Sounds like she already has one on Biden-Harris 2020!
convince me to vote for Biden/Harris without mentioning Trump.
Most of the establishment democrats are in bed with pharmaceutical companies, including Joe Biden because he has been saying his whole political career he wants to cut Medicare and Medicaid and social security.
Love their claim that Biden can’t speak off script...do they just tune out all the things Trump has said off script?  Injecting bleach?  Attacks on every person who’s ever said a negative word about him?  Pandemic of NINETEEN SEVENTEEN?  Airport attacks during the revolution?
Politicians campaign where they have a chance of winning.  To do otherwise would be a waste of time and resources.  Do you think Biden will campaign in Alabama or Mississippi?  It's not a matter of caring.  It's a matter of getting to 270 electoral votes.
First, it's Aryan Nation.  Second, it's the democrats who founded the KKK and fought for segregation (Biden supported Ayran  views).  Third, the left has been screaming RACIST! at conservatives for decades as a political tactic.  Read Saul Alinsky's Rules for Radicals.
Joe Biden touches young children, has a new racist comment almost weekly, has failed in office for 45 years and rarely can complete a full sentence. I'll pass on his advice
Yeah but Biden can't survive 4 years of Biden.
The Trump administration got rid of a bloated team of bureaucrats, but once we knew that China and the WHO had been lying to us, in a week he put together a stronger team of medical professionals and dealt with the pandemic better than Hillary ever could.  Biden would be lost.
Nice try using the democrat talking points (aka Excuses).  Listen to Biden talk from 10 years ago and it is obvious he has lost it.  Even democrat leadership knows it. You can keep up the illusion, but only until the first debate.  Then it's GAME OVER.
All the Biden followers running to get a mask
If ur in support of #BLM and #ACAB and ur going to vote 4 Biden/Harris, ur a hypocrite.  If you are not going to be part of the #generalstrike due 2 the govt not completing the stimulus package and supported Sanders, ur also a hypocrite.
Any chance Open Skies survives or resumes under a Biden presidency?
I just oppose Biden
A smart candidate doesn't care about the popular vote.  It's the electoral college that determines the winner, and that made Trump brilliant and Hillary...home.   Trumps base will walk through fire to vote this time +12M, and probably more after reasonable dems hear Biden debate.
Not that arguing with a Karen will change your gullible little deranged mind.  But when Biden steps onto the debate stage with Trump it's GAME OVER.  Then your hate will really consume you.  Have fun screaming into your pillow on Nov 4th!
#Election2020    Trump says of Biden/Harris: “They don't want to have cows, they don't want to have any form of animals."  Major disagrees....
Do you have ANY evidence for a corruption charge? Nope, just a bunch of CNN propaganda.  Biden, however, has documented incidents of enriching his family through corrupt deals.  And you want HIM negotiating with China?  China owns the Bidens!
Biden can't remember his name without a teleprompter.  People will feel sorry for the poor old guy when Trump shreds him in the debates.  CNN will accuse Trump of Elder Abuse! But it will still be GAME OVER for Biden.
Honest question are u voting for Biden after what he said last week regarding African Americans and the history of his running mate?
is it tooo soon to Congratulate you for winning the 2020 Presidential Election?  Biden has no chance of winning now!!  Congrats Mr. President, looking forward to more clean up, Thank you for all that you are doing to Make America Great!!
Join me in supporting Joe Biden via
I popped this list in a thread yesterday as potential targets for blame should Biden lose:
Bernie fell back in line fast enough that I don't think he'll be the target of Team D's ire should Biden lose.
If Joe Biden is allowed to bring up the past then Trump should bring up that Joe Biden has been saying he wants to defund social security, Medicare and medicaid his entire political career.
I hope somebody or somebodies crash the crap out of it.  Well...  that is unless Team D crashes it without any help.  Which if Biden's streams are any indicator is highly likely.
Shouldn’t that be Biden?
I’m so glad that u didn’t lose your power over Covid! Your fighting for the people! I’m so tired of Republicans trying to push u out! Thank god democrats blocked there vote! Thank you for all u do! And all u stand for! Minnesota’s a blue State! Vote blue!Joe Biden! Kamala Harris
that’s the argument that my sister-in-law used when talking to my wife tonight. Voting for trump because “Biden couldn’t do any better”. trump will get the majority of votes from this devout evangelical &amp; her circle of friends. Can’t have fact based conversation. Tone deaf.
Translation: White Woman will be submissive to their White Husbands in knowing, I'll keep Blacks &amp; Mexicans away from their neighborhoods. Also don't vote Biden because he'll allow a Black Man to allow fair opportunities to all races.   Trump's racism is so blatant &amp; disgusting!!
I didn’t know  was campaigning for Biden now.
Someone needs to remind Joe Biden...about 10 times a day!
yes and a Republican would never get elected again! Now Biden can pick the rest of his cabinet mayor of Seattle Chicago New York...
I listened to your podcast,which was  thing I believe is that we need to o encourage the Biden voters to vote early, whether by mail or in person.Then their votes will be counted earlier too.
Veteran Republican strategist  disagreed.  "I think that messaging will work," he said. "Middle America -- the moderates and the indepdendents -- are certainly not looking for an adminstration that's going to be beholden to the far left."
I can understand not wanting to vote for Biden/Harris if you dislike their records. But acting without a focus on the results may still result in harm, and your intentions will provide little solace to those harmed. Effects matter more than intention, IMO.
Build Back Better. Biden 😅🤣😂
Libertarians, OTOH are for criminal justice reform, so you bet your ass I am in a position to call Biden-Harris out for this, as well as Trump-Pence.
Biden doesn’t teach abortion is good. He just thinks women should make the decision  How do you feel about a Bishop that knows of child sex abuse in the church but refuses to do anything about it because it’s not his department.
No it’s an old picture. Biden was in Delaware all day and Harris was in California all day. They’re going to be together in Dover Delaware tomorrow.
It feels so good having Biden/Harris as a team. They will bring ethics back to government. They will bring back empathy. They will bring back fairness. And so much more.
At least Biden will try and hide the bad things his team does and not kill the gays. Harris will just try to lock up the trans folks though.
Biden/Harris will win. #BidenHarris
How should I respond to a R who asks about Kamala’s response to the sexual harassment allegations against Biden?
I will crawl over broken glass to vote Biden/Harris and dem up and down the ticket. Still, Senator Warren, I just want to say you brought humanity, intelligence, wit and more to this campaign, and I just can’t thank you enough for all you do and all you are.
“Nasty to Kavanaugh”...is Trump campaigning for Biden/Harris now cause this sounds like a great endorsement?
Harris was my favorite, but all the women up for VP were good. Please people vote for the Biden/Harris ticket. They are a great team.
Hey, I hate that Biden is the Dem nom as well. He's incredibly problematic. INCREDIBLY. BUT...still going to vote for him over Trump in Nov. Because that's what we got. And if you don't because your upset about Biden, them congrats, you've contributed to four more years of hell.
He picked her bc she is smarter than Trump and Biden combined, is a huge badass, and is entirely competent.  The black community isn’t a huge Kamala backer, so your point is moot
Actually this is a photo op.  The difference is Biden didn’t need to shoot and gas peaceful protestors to hold a Bible upside down. He just rode a bike instead while Trump can’t even walk down a ramp.
Biden ain’t slick
To all who complain that Kamala Harris is not progressive enough or that she was a prosecutor, you should read this. She will be a fantastic progressive Vice President. Biden/Harris 2020!!!  55 Things You Need to Know About Kamala Harris  via
I voted for you. Thanks for all the ways you continue to fight the good fight. All in now for Biden/Harris.
The president just gave us notice we’re going to have to learn Chinese if Biden wins. It’s never too early to start learning!  加油拜登的！
Yeah, that's the main thing. It's the default call, and we'll, that's Biden in a nutshell  I'm not thrilled but not worked up either
Harris: 'I believe' Biden accusers
Tulsi Gabbert wipes her ass with Kamala Harris. Harris is a true leftist suck up and is poster child for drama and for nearly destroying a justice's life with spite. She is just as dangerous as Biden, And will destroy this country, Mark my words. Tulsi has more class any day.
Joe Biden picking Kamala Harris as his VP is just more proof that cops and klan go hand in hand.
Very on brand for Joe Biden to be holding his phone upside down. 🤣🤣🤣
Those people were going to vote for Biden no matter who he picked for VP.  She doesn't sway a demographic. She doesn't bring a better chance of winning any States. She instead of mitigating some of Biden's biggest problems, amplifies them.  Picking Harris is tactical idiocy.
Kamala Harris was the right pick for the Biden campaign. It’s the safe pick. They didn’t overthink it. I’m thrilled to see a woman and POC on this ticket. I’m also glad republicans can’t relitigate Benghazi/Tarmac/Hillary for the trillionth time if they’d picked Susan Rice. Happy
Biden/Harris 2020!! Let's Go!!
If Biden wins corona will be the least of our problems
I’m thrilled. Vote Biden-Harris.
Congrats on your pick!! I was SO hoping you would pick Kamala Harris! You two will make a great team! "Ridin' with Biden!"
So Kamala, who did you sleep with to get to be Biden’s running mate? We are gonna have some fun with this! BJ and the hooker! What a team!
#VPPick Well, now the dems will at least win California.  LOL  Harris is the pit bull they need to fight the fights Biden can't handle, which is all of them.
Kamala Harris for VP, a great choice, vote Biden Harris. 🌊🌊🌊😄😸😊😂
BIDEN HARRIS 2020 LETS GO!!!!
How nice for  to finally tell Joe Biden who his running mate will be! #BidenVP
I asked one of my buddies, what’s the worst thing about Trump. He said that he lies. He says he’s voting for Biden. 🤷🏽‍♂️
Scary thought: when Biden wins the election trump can start running for 2024.😳
Raging Endorsement, :`)  Why I Want Biden to Lose More than I Want Trump to Win
I’d vote for Biden if he named a cabbage as running mate. Fortunately there aren’t any cabbages on his short list.
So crazy how much I bought into her bullshit and how quickly I forgot she existed after she endorsed Biden. I would say it was a good 2-3 months where I didn’t see anything about her on here. And then shocked at myself for how quickly I forgot about her.
That dude would have mopped the floor with old man Biden.
Yea but these riots started under Obama same with the kids being in cages. Syria's civil war was also started under Obama's watch as well. Not to mention Joe Biden wants to defund social security, Medicare and medicaid the proof is in his entire political career. Look it up.
This letter doesn’t advocate for a particular Black woman. We are not interchangeable! Do I want to see Black women lead? YES! Do I want Black women in positions of power? YES! But this further tokenizes the Black women Biden IS considering.Its not the solidarity they think it is
Donate to Biden campaign
A vote for Biden is really a vote for Michelle.  They know that too.
Dude, who are you going to vote for them? All this hate you spew for Biden only helps Trump... you don't see this??
10,000 times as often and worse.  Get used to it Biden voters.  We can do this for four years too... if you get that lucky.
The only reason that I plan to watch the conventions is that I'm expecting both to be a spectacular comedy of technical errors.  If Biden's streams are any indicator, the Team D one is almost guaranteed to come apart at the seams.
Joe Biden has been saying he wants to defund social security, Medicare and Medicaid and disability his entire political career. So whats your point? How will things get any better with Joe Biden when he is just part of the problem? If you don't believe me do some research.
Lmao did you know that Joe Biden also wants to defund Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Yet you sheep still believe he will change our country for the better. Face it the two party system isn't working. Also the proof is in Joe Biden's entire political career.
Hopefully trump wins because if Joe Biden wins we will lose social security and Medicare and Medicaid because he wants to defund all 3 of them to pay for his illegal immigrants and their votes. The cartel problem will only get worse with a Democrat in office.
Joe Biden is more corrupted than Trump will ever be. He also wants to defund social security and Medicare and Medicaid. He has been saying that for most of his political career.
As a hard working American I can't handle 1 day of Joe Biden
He doesn’t have to accept the results, like we give a damn, but he WILL HAVE TO GET HIS BIG ASS UP OUT OF THE PEOPLES HOUSE! President Biden already confirmed after his inauguration the IDIOT would be drug out the WH kicking and screaming like the coward he is if he try’s that BS
Biden won't be their candidate come election time anyway.
very sad that biden is the democratic nominee. we coulda had bernie
Joe Biden the Pander 🐻

#IntelligenceReports So Russia is working against Biden. China is working against Trump. Guess which one Trump will do something about.
IKR .. Takes a lot of emotional intelligence to come up with that kind of response.  Such a great communicator, he could write for Biden.
#Election2020 Is Trump saying that Biden wants to put God on the disabled list?
No way could Biden spell monolith or provide a definition.  Dementia Joe hasn't written a single tweet in the last year.  When he has to meet Trump on stage without a teleprompter, ear piece, or notes, it will be  GAME OVER!
Here is the fact. Biden will select the person who he thinks will help him win the election. I’m completely satisfied with all of the women currently on the short list. I’ll support whoever is selected. That said I prefer Sen Harris.
Read this whole thread. I’m not going to comment on the content, but simply that Joe Biden does not write his own tweets lol.
People are working for money! This is Biden and Obama’s biggest night mirror
Kare 11 what do you think sunrisers think of Biden’s massively racists comments yesterday?   Please ask
Kare11 are you going to ask sunrisers what they think of Biden’s incredibly racist comments yesterday?   Or does that not fit your narrative?   If trump said these words I can only imagine.....,.
Willing to lie to Congress. Guess he’s qualified to serve in the trump administration. Vote for Biden and get rid of all of these guys.
They were not drugs they retested the substance and it wasn’t drugs but they are still trying to say she resisted arrest. Crooked Sheriffs Department! They need a FBI patterns and practices investigation after Biden wins this November!
Biden said something stupid and owned it. Who knew this was possible?
#Election2020 The Yo Semite and Thighland guy thinks that Joe Biden is the one who can't keep it together.
I worked for Bernie's campaign and i am a Democratic socialist, but I can see past my privilege to know what 4 more years of Trump will do to us.  I don't like Biden, but we have 2 choices, and Biden will bring a respectable cabinet and jurors with him. We need that.
I’m a proud gun owner who refuses to vote for you.  We own guns to protect us from a tyrannical government.  I’m sure Biden would do no worse than your Portland stunt.  If he does, that’s why we have a second amendment.I just hope that if Biden wins, we can put him in an orange jumpsuit!
Hey, I just filled out my request for an absentee ballot so I can legitimately mail my vote in. You are a con artist Mr. Biden.
So Trump campaign tweeted out mugshots of black people out on bail to scare people as though Biden will be letting out every black person in prison to terrorize white folk.  How about tweeting out pics of Trump in prison stripes?  That's where he should be.
I’m voting for Biden
Vote for Biden &amp; Kamala Harris For sure better than TRUMPster fire
It turns out that "Dr." Jill Biden is NOT a medical doctor!
Followed all I wasn't already. Nice to meet you all. I do block people who are saying they won't vote Biden/Harris for any reason. ABirkshire, for example. Was warned last night, checked, pinned tweet saying so. This is too important to not support this ticket. We must unite.
How can any Roman Catholic support Biden/Harris? Outrageous support for pro-abortion candidates!!
I think it is hilarious that the first question about Biden's proposed mask mandate is "under what authority could a President order that?"
Virginia mayor urged to resign after saying Biden picked 'Aunt Jemima as his VP'  vía
This Minnesotan agrees wholeheartedly with you. And we were looking forward to a visit. Hopefully next summer after Biden/Harris win!
If you notice your mail has been delivered later than usual, this is done on purpose to rig the election in favor of Trump and the GOP.  Don't vote for them, vote for Biden and democrats. More better if it is progressive democrats.
Voting for Biden sucks, not voting sucks, and voting for trump is not possible  No good choices 😔
Who does Biden think he is, he isn't part of the Govt and he isn't a doctor, he's garbage!
Biden/Harris campaign offices:
Biden's not all there, he's not playing with a full deck.
Poor Democratic leadership on display!  A vote for Biden is a vote to give up your freedoms! Vote Red! 💪🇺🇸
Admittedly an improvement for Biden in his raw number. That being said, Biden will win MN by more than he wins WI, I believe.
Nope!  No questions or solutions!  If you vote for Biden you are not an American!
SO DID BIDEN!
They can criticize her all they want but unless they want four more years of #45 they had better vote Biden/Harris.
so what, Biden and Camela will lose, so who cares/
You are so Full of $hit Even without the covid losses &amp; few gains You still haven't match Obama &amp; Biden They stepped into office after the last #GOP failure w/ 10's of thousands losing work &amp; homes You &amp; #trump blew a record continuous growth that was left for you God hates liers
Who will be the actual power behind Biden/Harris really running the country? That’s the true info needed. Dr Jill Biden? Chief of Staff? These concerns make US look like a crummy  dictatorship. NOT WHAT WE WANT FOR OUR NATION.
Unfortunately, it won’t work until there’s a national testing/tracing plan in place. Maybe if/when Biden wins, things will be good by March?
I say feel free to ban tiktok  It's so toxic With a trump supporters in the Biden supporters
I might take a break from all social media tiktok, Instagram and Twitter cuz all people talk about on tiktok  Biden and trump can app go back to sexy females twerking video game clips and funny videos please
Biden names Kamala as his VP, now Black Americans are tweeting about how Obama didn't do anything for the black community!  Rest abeg

Kamala knee pads Harris will sink the HIDE'n BIDEN  ship . Save those tears for Nov. IT's sad you are in support of a no moral , child abise hiding , career activity sealing sleeze. She's is a disgusting pock for VP
Let's talk about the Biden Harris campaign and what it means for us....  via
Gosh, apparently Biden needed to seek advice from Trump: "Kamala Harris is the meanest, most horrible, most disrespectful, MOST LIBERAL of anyone in the U.S. Senate, and I cannot believe that Joe Biden would pick her as his running mate."  (Trump e-mail)
If Biden wins, get ready for Trump to punish America
So Biden like Obama is relying on record online donations. Anyone think that these are fraudulent donations using bots? Why were Obama’s and Biden’s donations so small? To avoid scrutiny. So easy to have a ton of bots make small donations using PayPal or other methods
Joe Biden is a stanch Catholic. Educate yourself.
Nothing against Biden, but can she step in for one of the debates? Would love to see her destroy Trump face to face.
Kamala: So Biden us a racist and in your words has credible sexual harassment claims leveled against him. Why run next to him? Just like sleeping your way to the top with Willie Brown morals and integrity don’t seem to matter much. #HeelsUpHarris
My head just freaking exploded from Biden’s Lies!
Okay. So when Joe has to resign in 18 months due to mental health concerns, Kamala Harris will be President. In other words, Kamala Obama. I suppose China will love her as much as Joe Biden. She will be a good puppet for Leftist Elites (Globalists).
Good thing you like her since she’ll be POTUS. Biden won’t remember who she is by November.

If I were to vote it would be for Biden.  Trump is a liar and a divider.  So is Biden and he might be senile, so I might just be sitting this one out my Lloyd!!!  Minnesota will go blue I am pretty sure so I am just a human in this state
Indeed, Sad part about people saying vote for Biden is that they’re forced to say it because he’s the only other candidate to vote for lol we’re fucked either way. 😞
Politics are poisonous.   They will have you arguing with your friends and family over 2 candidates that don’t give 2 fucks about us. Ain’t that crazy? Poc are arguing over Trump and Biden... 🤦🏽‍♂️ so this where we at huh
Predictable. A certainty actually. The nastiest man on the planet, or at least in this country, attacks a woman in this way. It lays bare his character. It will have, I think, a boomerang effect. Because try as he will, he can't sully her character at all.
Thinking he hasn't got much support from any color. He may not win his household even. And I don't care, I don't think his name is even going to be on the ballot in most states. So, I'm not reading anything more about him. He's not the news for me. Biden/Harris is.
The rioters, looters, and arsonists who are destroying our cities are Democrats, Biden supporters.

Wow! I think we found Hunter Biden! I knew he had to surface sooner or later. #HunterBiden
There’s a lot of fundamentals (and 22% uncertainty) built in.  Someone else pointed out that as the election gets closer, if things remain the same, Biden’s chances will increase.  If that’s true, I can understand why the model is where it is right now.
So all Trump campaign has is name calling.  All they have otherwise they'd have to bash policies the majority of Americans favor.  Oh, so they'll go with extreme policies that Biden/Harris don't even believe in.  Name call &amp; scare ppl.  I'm going to hate the next 80+ days.
Okay. So when Joe has to resign in 18 months due to mental health concerns, Kamala Harris will be President. In other words, Kamala Obama. I suppose China will love her as much as Joe Biden. She will be a good puppet for Leftist Elites (Globalists).
Biden won't be elected, Trump doesn't lose
I am done responding. I'm sick of you trying to say "you think/do this horrible thing" when I clearly don't. I never said the fight ends when Biden is elected
no one in this convo is saying you should be grateful for the LGBTQ+ situation in the US right now. It's still bad. We're saying that it's better than it was 40 years ago and could get WORSE under Trump, while it won't under Biden
I simply think getting Trump out should be top priority. Then young people can start to put pressure on Biden and the Dem establishment
idk where in this argument you got the idea that this is "fun" for me? I'm sorry about the situation you're in. I understand that I have very little skin in the game (i'm a white guy). I just see what Trump is doing and know that four years of Biden would be not as bad
Has Biden recently turned Catholic? I’m curious as to why it’s trending now when he’s probably been a catholic this whole time? It’s just political season so anything goes I guess, I’m surely excited to vote now. 😒
And if Hillary had won in 2016 Biden probably wouldn't have felt the need to run this year. Good job!
Think of it this way, Nate’s model has Biden winning 93% of the time if the election were held today, Elliot’s is at 88%.  Slight variation.
i'd call "we need to elect Biden because Trump is worse" pragmatism
and mfers like you are the reason Trump won in 2016, no offense. Look at how all of you people abstaining did in the next election cycle. No more progressive but at least we have Biden!
In no way do I enjoy the fact that Biden is the nominee. I simply understand that 4 more years of Trump would be much worse than that of Biden
"Hey guys maybe we should finally let black people vote" is to the left of "Hey we need to break down systemic racism" I guess? And that's not Biden i'm quoting but the main line of the Democratic party, whether or not it's older members actually mean what they say
Here we go! So happy that VP Biden picked Kamala Harris! I am energized!
I’m attending Joe Biden for President’s event, “Join Seniors for Biden” – sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
my point is that you're ignoring the actual difference in their political stances. Biden may very well be a rapist. It sucks that the Democrats forced him on us. But to say Biden as a presidential candidate and Trump as a presidential candidate are the same thing IS ridiculous
You're reaching Trump supporter levels of simplification here. I very much dislike Biden. I wish Bernie (or even Warren) was the nominee but to ignore all the differences between Biden and Trump's platform and just say they're both equal "racist rapists" is ridiculous
I am meh but still going to vote Biden
Biden isn't all there.
The problem in this case is that Kamala is suppposed to be the appeasement to the left wing because Biden is already far enough to the right.
The Biden-Harris Ticket
No but you attacked Biden, who everyone knows isn’t perfect. But the more you and your berniebro friends focus on criticizing Biden over getting trump voted out, the more likely it gets that trump is gonna get re-elected. And for what? Because you can afford it.
You’re actively dulling what the focus is supposed to be on for Twitter woke points while children are sitting in cages and over a hundred thousand are dead. I don’t like Biden either but there’s a time and place and it definitely isn’t election season.
Must be nice having the privilege to try and equate Biden to trump without worry lmao
China will provide massive vaccines to the USA as soon as Biden gets elected this Nov
I was LIVING when Kamala called Biden out in multiple debates, mainly for his support of segregation. Kamala definitely has the ability to hold Biden accountable.
I wish Biden would’ve chosen Stacey Abrams
If you are reading this  stay clear of Biden’s nursing home.  #CuomoKilledGrandma
Sorry. Let me clarify, as anti Kamala I may seem.. please vote for Biden. Kamala and Biden both have their flaws, but are no type of evil when compared to Trump. VOTE, this is not the lesser of two evils but defeating the evil who has proven...
#CuomoKilledGrandma Better run Biden ...he’s after your age bracket!!!
These mfs voting for Trump over Biden because they never had 1k before him 🥴😂
Lots and lots of grandmas and grandpas.  Come to think of it Biden should be terrified around this crowd.      stay away from Joe’s nursing home dammit!!!!
Nice try, At least Trump has better taste  than Biden.  #TaraReade.  Yuck.  Biden should pay her btw .
Trump in a landslide. Anyone with a brain knows that. There aren’t enough stolen votes to pull that off for Biden
Everyone, even Republicans, are getting sick of what the pandemic has done to them.  Trump's done nothing for them, but give them crumbs.  Vote for Biden for this madness to be better.  If you don't, I can assure you this will continue for even longer.
your daughter supports Biden/Harris...why can't you be a little like her?
And the Biden family too got rich, hmm hows Hunter and his crack pipe doin’ nowadays.
I think I had forgotten what hope had felt like until it was restored today. Biden/Harris... let’s go!
Both Biden &amp; Harris are moderates and you don't have anything that even comes close to labelling them as radical left.  They are so moderate that many conservatives that are sick of trump will feel at ease that a vote for Joe is a vote for moving America forward out of the gutter
Biden was a senator for a long time and is known as a super genial, get along guy. He’s going to want to work with the other side and make deals. What Trump should have done.
is voting for joe Biden strictly for kampala Harris
Just like we were last election right?  😂😂😂😂😂 Biden already had no chance and this made his chances even worse 😂😂😂 Dems don’t even want to vote for him 😂😂😂
- Joe Biden will be a great running mate.
By the end of January with Biden/Harris there will be....for the good of the nation
All the Sander voters that vote Biden will get nothing they hoped for. This is all a set up from top Dems. You can bank that!
I never said I was for Trump? What I said is I thought Biden would pick Rice and the Dems would move Biden out and Harris would be VP. NOW I just say swap them around. I do like any one of these lady’s more than Biden. He will never make it through his 1st year.
democrats are so fucking stupid as usual.  I’ll vote for biden because he’s not trump- but kamala is hillary level bad.  idiots.
Trump saying that the Spanish flu probably ended WWII was either a cognitive slip (dementia) or willful ignorance. He said it within the last day or so. That you think Trump's statement has no equivalency with cracks about Biden having dementia is laughable.
Okay. So when Joe has to resign in 18 months due to mental health concerns, Kamala Harris will be President. In other words, Kamala Obama. I supposed China will love her as much as Joe Biden. She will be a good puppet for Leftist Elites (Globalists).

Bigger Harris/Biden numbers coming in November!
Every time Trump or surrogate talks about Biden gaffes they should just play Trump talking about 1917 flu and it ended WW II.
The only presidential candidate we were ever globally comfortably voting for was Obama. Them days are over with. Don’t just expect poc to pick between biden &amp; trump, it’s all fucked up.
Kamala Harris is Joe Biden's running mate: Live updates. Yes!!! #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Biden made the right choice asking Harris to be his running mate. Her debates with Pence should be good.
Congratulations!!!  I am excited to vote for Biden/Harris!!!
I really don’t like Biden or Kamala Harris but I hate trump lol
Biden has picked Harris to be his VP. This ticket will be responsible for putting more black folks in chains than pre civil war
Biden/Harris 2020!  I'm feeling very positive! :)
With Biden being so pro cop and prison..... and with Kamala’s resume.... I’m a tad afraid
Great pick!!!  Can't wait to vote for Biden/Harris!!!!!  #BlueWave
Biden picks Kamala Harris for VP running mate.  better get ready! #snl
Didn't Harris pretty much accuse Biden of being a racist at one of the Dem debates?
And that was the final Nail in Biden’s chances 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
If the pick is truly in, Biden should make the announcement ASAP. The longer he waits, the greater the probability that the VP choice will be leaked.
Rice will make history 1st woman VP and President and wait! history yet again A WOMAN PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT RUNNING THE UNITED STATES. PRESIDENT RICE AND VP HARRIS. this is already the setup if Biden wins and the Dems will close there eyes to Biden family Ukraine deals.
Rice will make history 1st woman VP and President and wait! history yet again A WOMAN PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT RUNNING THE UNITED STATES. PRESIDENT RICE AND VP HARRIS. this is already the setup if Biden wins and the Dems will close there eyes to Biden family Ukraine deals.
A vote for Biden is a vote for PRESIDENT RICE and VP to be announced at later date maybe Harris. Rice will be your president after the Dem's declare Biden unfit in his first year, Rep can't argue against it because they have been saying his unfit this hole time.
Rice would be the best pick for Biden. And Rice will be your president after the Dem's declare Biden unfit in his first year, Rep can't argue against it because they have been saying his unfit this hole time.PRESIDENT RICE VP to be announced at later date maybe Harris
They would be right! and Rice would be the best pick for Biden. And Rice will be your president after the Dem's declare Biden unfit in his first year, Rep can't argue against it because they have been saying his unfit this hole time.PRESIDENT RICE VP to be announced at later date
Big unemployment numbers! Big TRMPVD19 numbers! Big death toll numbers. Big Biden poll numbers!
Could we try not to put the cart before the horse? Trump made a similar statement prior to the election in 2016. This is a given, I'm not sure stating the obvious out loud is going to persuade people to vote Biden, in fact, it may cause some to not.
I am hoping that it will be former U.S.ambassador Susan Rice (  ; with Senator Kamala Harris ( as my second choice.
That sounds like a Trump campaign ad. "This is the America Joe Biden wants!"
Trump doesn't lose, so whoever Biden picks as VP is irrelevant.
I will cancel your vote for Dementia Biden
Children Are Not Immune
Kamala But I'm down with Bass as well. It's his choice and I'm going with Biden's choice.
Thank you sir. President Biden.
Joe Biden as a Muppet? Now there’s an idea! Thank you Raymond Arroyo on Laura Ingraham. #FoxNews
Quite easy to see that Kamala “Heels Up” Harris was promised a SCOTUS seat should Biden win. Even more reason to reject Biden if you still needed one.
He promised a woman. We’re getting a woman. Pete is trending because, I believe there was a chartered flight from South Bend to Biden’s regional airport (because, you know, #ElectionTwitter is 👀). Secretary of State offer?
Can a reporter ask him where he went to church this weekend and tell him where Biden went?
Donny says Biden will hurt god. Did I miss the part where Joe collected all the Infinity Stones?
The only man I would accept as Biden’s running mate tbh
Joe Biden owns Fox News reporter during morning bike ride
I read someone’s comment that said he’s probably calling everyone in and giving them a face-to-face “Thanks for your participation. It’s not you” talk ..   Sounds like something Biden would do ...
The media is giving Biden a pass for his cognitive decline and his obvious racist point of view.
Biden’s Choice
Mooch, you need to see someone about your ”sour grapes” jealousy and anger. Either you were never a Republican or you are as crazy as the rest of the #NeverTrumpers. No true Republican would support Biden he has become a toxic radical. Win Trump win!
That Biden will drop out of the race...
Only vote for Biden
After the election the Covid hoax will end, and Biden and the DemocRATs will scamper back into their rat holes.
Biden and Trump are not the best our country has to offer.  There are other options and we NEED to acknowledge them to break this broken two-party system.  #LetHerSpeak
It’s political. The more things they can shut down the better for Biden. Next will be Halloween!
Biden sold our manufacturing to the Chinese, the same country that caused the DemocRATS to scare our country into shutting down!1
If you support Trump, please unfollow me. Seriously...I pointed out on a thread (on FB) about Biden having a stutter (aka a disability) and someone used the "laugh" emoji. Really??  REALLY?  Deplorable much?
60-40 is actually really good for Democrats in Hartland (I know, I know...yard signs don’t translate to votes). Looks like Trump won 61-32 in ‘16. Honestly, I wouldn’t expect to see any Biden signs out there.
Ok this might be the level of tweet I can expect Biden to have actually sent
No thanks Trump, I'm voting Biden #VoteTrumpOut #VoteLikeYourLifeDependsOnIt #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #DonTheCon #ByeDon #Biden2020
Biden takes orders from AOC, #PuppetJoe
Biden claims that Black people are all alike, just more proof that #RacistJoe is racist.
You are absolutely right his run for the office is just a ploy just ignore him and vote for Biden
Biden and Obama raided Medicare to pay for a failed program called “Obamacare.” They cheated us! This program was supposed to bring down healthcare costs for all American citizens. That’s one of the most infamous lies of the century!
Trump sets the debate rules, not Biden.
I heard them dissecting Biden's gaffe. I had to shut it off. Yesterday, Trump said he created an executive order to force insurance to cover pre existing conditions; something the ACA already does, but they're focusing on a Biden misstatement, already explained &amp; apologized for.
I'm much more concerned about the money men, the people like Sheldon Adelson who are the source of all that dark money pouring into Kentucky to keep Mitch and others like him than the noisy, but dumb Fox - saw a clip yesterday where they thought Biden really said he'd chosen a VP
Biden couldn’t even come up with the words to say that. Oh, well he could with 2 hrs of prompting. He’s just a puppet on a string.
I’d pay thousands of dollars for a front row seat at the Bible quiz contest between Joe Biden and Donald Trump! 😂 #TrumpIsNotAChristian #TrumpIsDefinitelyNotEvangelical #SexWithPornStarsIsNotChristian

Here’s a new one. My niece said her FIL sent a message to my niece’s daughter, saying that if she voted for Biden, he’d disinherit her. She’ll be a first time voter. She told him to go ahead and do it! 🤣🥰 Proud of her!
“You’re not Black if you don’t vote for me.” I don’t know about anyone else, but I would never let Joe Biden define me no matter what color I am. A 47-year political failure like Joe “China” Biden, has no game whatsoever. Accept maybe making his family rich on taxpayer time.
Thank you.  I was just going to tweet how this is a further move to dictatorship if EO is allowed to go forward.  If, as I hope, Trump is not re-elected, Biden is going to have a real task in putting the Constitution back together from the shredder.
I never seen those quotes man. Guess I should've googled all the racist shit Biden spewed beforehand huh? My bad
What, you think Biden has a solution? Let's hear it!
What’s your plan? Gonna sleep with Joe to make it to the top. Seems to have worked well for you so far. Too bad Biden likes them much younger.
No cozy bear. It's quite alive and well.
To tell you the truth, I think that Biden is too far gone to win. My concern is losing the House and Senate.
Biden's plan is the Green New Deal, which is unacceptable, face it, Biden is a loser!
If Twitter calls out fake information then why doesn’t this get flagged as a lie because Biden couldn’t possible send a tweet.  His handlers should have to admit authorship to make this a true tweet.
I guess it’s about the Biden’s (and others’m) involvement with Barisma.  Sounds like our money was stolen then laundered initially through Barisma and back to America possibly sitting within one or more construction companies.  Criminal charges means there’ll be a jury.
As Biden would say cmon man. You really think you just thought of that? 😳
Kanye West should be ashamed to support a xenophobic racists! He evidently believe in the kkk theories that God made them superior to all others! That is absolutely  Asinine! He supposed to be a preacher_Really!?
I don't think that trip to Ohio is going to give him the boost he expected given the unhinged rant he unleashed against Joe Biden's faith and his ludicrous misunderstanding of how the constitution is amended. This man HAS no God but money.
Biden wants to stop all oil exploration drilling, fracking, and wants to shut down coal power plants. The guy is a clown!
Exactly. I am convinced the "pick is in".  It would be a glorious weekend for many if Biden made his pick known today.
Biden isn't worthy of anyone's vote!
Are we afraid of what the tRump camp might say about Rice? Biden will choose the best woman for VP....period!
Great strategy: Biden’s supporters are approving Trump BEFORE 03 Nov...
Omg she just throws out my thoughts cause I have maga in my bio. Why y’all do that? It’s not like I throw out your thoughts cause u a Biden supported. I actually listen to what u gotta say. Why everyone do this
The strategy will be ready after this Nov 3rd when Joe Biden gets elected
Biden's done for, good riddance.
Biden needs to choose a fucking capable adult that won't sell out the country for more money. It's not difficult. #VoteBiden
Maybe he should go to Thigh land.  What kind of moron continues to try to say Biden is some kind of gaffe machine when Trump is just walking around with his pants around his ankles every day?
You’ve actively listened to trump for the past 4 years and are at a loss at what comes out of BIDEN’S mouth??
Biden's out to lunch, gone!
We had a family member who exhibited these same behaviors. I would guess Joe Biden is about 24 months from being disabled by Dementia.
Biden is against GOD now? I bet he knows a scripture from the Bible, unlike Orange Face, gets more insane everyday.
Putin still has 90 days believe nothing the media says about Biden's lead. Vote as if your life depends on it REGARDLESS  Because this foremost needs to be a win Needs to be blow out in epic fashion Vote BLUE UP AND DOWN EVERY TICKET Give America the second chance we all deserve
He has to pick the one he thinks he can work the best with. He and Obama were a great working team. Biden deserves the same.
...and once Biden decides on his V.P., who will most likely be a WOC, watch the enthusiasm runneth over!
Seeing VP Biden in action will change a lot of minds!
Someone should remind him of that pic of Joe Biden in a church, praying, that his campaign doctored.
Thank u president Biden. You’re the man. ✔️Bernie was #1, Biden was #4...Obama pulled a coup. He had everyone drop out. Bernie refused to. So, he was threatened.  Obama still thinks he's in charge, as do the Clintons. Electoral College could be absolutely brilliant and name Bernie Sanders president.

If he’s gonna accuse him of lying then he should ask him specifically about 1 or 2 “lies”, it’s like asking Joe Biden “Your plans are terrible, aren’t they?” Biden asks what plans in particular, “Your plans”, can’t blame someone for not answering an actual question

Frankly, this former Republican is excited and enthused.  I’ve made a donation to the Biden Harris campaign.
Thank you for accurately writing about Biden’s Catholic faith. He is being disingenuous; it’s sad to see him deceived. His actions don’t follow Catholic teachings. Although he ‘feels comfort’, many Bishops are trying to discomfort/save him by refusing him Holy Communion.
Tara Reade: Media Should Challenge Kamala Harris on Biden Accusers  via

Biden and Kamala as a “progressive” ticket is LOL  I wonder how many incarcerated black ppl they’re responsible for combined
Who was the last Catholic on a Democratic ticket? Since you’ve excommunicated Biden sub silentio, surely no other Democrat can have qualified.
Okay, so if you have a problem with Kamala for being complicit in a culture of mass incarceration, you probably weren’t gonna vote for Biden anyway (because he is absolutely complicit in that same culture). If you were on the fence and Kamala is the dealbreaker... that’s dumb.

The suspense is creating more interest in Biden and takes attention away from 45...haha
In 2008, the VP night (Wednesday) had a slot for "Vice Presidential Acceptance Speech" and also slots for 4 of the people on the shortlist for the spot - Biden, Bayh, Richardson and Senator Reed.   They've filled the hole before.
When they announced the 2008 speakers (11 days before Biden was announced), the Wednesday night line-up listed "Vice Presidential Acceptance Speech" and also speeches from 4 of the people believed to be on the shortlist for VP (Biden, Bayh, Richardson and Reed).
Here’s the press briefing book for the 2008 DNC for the third day. Note that there’s a slot for VP and also one for Biden.   This came out August 12, 2008, 11 days before Biden was announced.   So, it’s probably not a leak.

There is no doubt that the Democratic establishment, backed by monied power brokers did everything they could to put Biden on top, but that is history. The future must be one that doesn't include tRump as president. That is job one. Even Bernie knows. You can't eat principles.

did biden remember that we were not going to go home this evening   uhhh
And if Bernie can't win without moderate support? Sadly, too many Americans still fear socialism.  I came from Canada. Grew up in a Social Democracy. Majority of Americans have no idea how good it can be. They are not ready. Which is why Biden won.
Biden or Trump as president!
Do you realize Obama picked Biden on August 23, 2008, when his convention started August 25?   I think it’ll be okay.
Looking at a different model, maybe?  Aug. 23, ‘08 - Obama picks Biden. Aug. 11, ‘12 - Romney picks Ryan. Aug. 29, ‘08 - McCain picks Palin. Aug. 8, ‘00 - Gore picks Lieberman Aug. 10, ‘96 - Dole picks Kemp. Aug. 16, ‘88 - Bush picks Quayle.
Right. Biden is just saying anything he can to make trump look bad cuz biden knows he does not have a chance to win this thing
NOBODY wants a Biden presidency...at least not anyone intelligent.
When Biden wins
Not to mention burn down and steal from businesses, kill and mame police, riot and set up camps, ummmm oh and have biden rallies, oh wait. No one goes to those
Joe biden has not condemned these riots. Trump had to send in troops to gaurd FEDRERAL PROPERTY. It is the democratic leaders in these states to stop these riots in their states and clearly they dont want to.
Ya. Thats what he is doing. In other news joe biden doesn’t lie. Stop with the ignorance
Are you for busing then? Can we put you down as supporting the integration-by-busing that the Biden amendment opposed?

Yes, please vote for either of the candidates that did not earn your vote, because some numbskull doesn’t want you to actually vote FOR a candidate who did earn it. Thanks for reminding me. Take one out of the Biden column.

Keeps making a pretty good argument for Biden I tell ya...
Okay nothing to see hear then...."Latinos are more diverse then the black communities"- joe biden.  Doesn't sound racist at all🐑🤫🤔🤣😂
Also show me the exact legal documents showing "Trump" not anyone else,  that he colluded with Russia.  If you say his associates were charged, then you prove in this picture that Biden is a Racist by association.
Explain why Biden is holding hands with a known racist.  Are you so 🧠 washed you cannot see?  This is a what is wrong with the left.  If this were Trump holding hands with the KKK you would never hear the end of it.  You haven't addressed the picture that is clearly relevant.

What do they think will happen if Joe Biden wins lol
Don't worry when Biden wins your days of being free are numbered.
Comes up every time. As an Independent, I owe the dems nothing, as they offer nothing. No to Gore, Clinton and Biden. Come up with a decent candidate and I will vote for them... they don’t get it. 2016 taught them nothing.
Good morning tweeps, bring the Biden/Harris hype to the polls‼️  Voter Registration Deadlines:
Can't believe dumbass motherfuckers are out here making me defend Joe Biden spouting "Biden and Trump are the same" nonsense.
All of a sudden Biden is now aggressive does he have a new writer? No a new boss the Pit Bull(Harris) or HILLARY!
Come on lets do this, let's see if the Evangelists can find their way out of a paper bag much less find the people who voted for Biden.

Why can’t Biden do a damn debate? Will he embarrass DNC/deep state? If he is gonna speak to the world as the President, we have the right to judge how he does with public speaking and debates!How will he debate the leaders of the world if he can’t debate who he’s running against?

So discouraged at all the people thinking Biden/Harris are the dynamic duo. Seriously? He cannot complete a sentence. He’s a creep. His record. His lies. Her record. Her lies. It’s all so horrendous, yet... we have been saved? I can’t.
Yes but this aint the year yall better vote biden idfc
She threatened the American people just because they're not in her radicalized party, they are both losers and Biden needs her to campaign for him Lol,
No to Harris Biden!

You were amazing today and I finally have something to feel excited about. Biden/Harris 2020 🇺🇸
I hope to be severely disappointed in my expectation that Biden &amp; Harris will be held to ALL kinds of standards that those in the media have been stone-cold silent about for the last 4 years. 😑
Kamala Harris is probably the least genuine out of every woman on Biden's VP shortlist. And while I don't think that helps against Trump, I'm personally happy about this because it means that she has already alienated progressives and will be much easier to primary in 2024
Biden would be pleased 😉

Biden/Harris prolongs the pain of POC and the working class, guarantees more war, and no M4All or GND. Not playing. 40 years of neoliberalism brought us Trump. Or didn’t you know that? The Third Way paved the way... and you are part of it. I am not.

No they are not! These questions are the most important questions he will be asked! If he is not competent he shouldn't be running! The media shouldn't b part of a cover-up!  Health questions for Biden off-limits for media, unlike Reagan, McCain and Trump
I fully support Biden-Harris.

They’re unlikely to win. It was dumb to send 2 rightwing Ds against Donald. The desire to take some dissatisfied Rs from T is foolish and won’t amount to a win. DNC is foolish for ignoring progressives. Biden/Harris both carry only the ‘vote blue no matter’ group and no one else.

Guess what? Biden isn't pulling the strings  Just saying...
oh, and I suppose you think it's impossible that them giving Biden those delegates may have influenced people into voting for Biden? Since people tend to subconsciously want to be "on the winning side" and can often vote based on who they think will win instead of who they want?
It’s like every critical thought against Harris when she was up against Gabbard and Warren has been forgotten as the collective mass of Democrats are dropped on their heads for Biden’s success. Don’t we remember how artificial this woman was in interviews?
That was painless. I think Biden hit a home run. You?
I feel we will all be pretty goddamn tired if trump wins again.  You want to hold Biden/Harris’ feet to the fire when they get elected?  Great.  Do that.  But we will not have any fucking accountability if we let the current administration back in.
Biden is a DINO, dummy.
Kamala is a Destroyer! Remember Kavanaugh! Remember what she did to the President in the hearings! I really hope it gets ugly with there campaign, people like her should not get to win!  The Rove: Politically Kamala will be Biden's 'attack machine'
Oh, sure, Clinton and Biden "won". Exit polling definitely doesn't show there was more fuckery there than the Russian "election", ha!
I can say I have 3 Lamborghinis in my garage, that doesn't make it true.  You said a bunch of words, I'll give you that. None of them support the idea of Biden for POTUS.
Joe Biden can’t unify a pair of matching socks-
Politics are so disgusting cuz on the campaign trail you have Kamala calling Joe Biden a racist rapist, talking about how she believes his assault victims and then she gets picked for VP and says there’s no better man to lead our country than that very same racist rapist
Oh for sure! The Biden bit in Parks did not age well.
NEW POLL
Much of them didn’t even vote for Biden though? They voted for other candidates who all simultaniously jumped ship, then gave their votes to Biden whether the voters wanted or not.
One of the few that speaks the truth about Trump? What planet are you from? The majority of the country hates that man.  And yet Biden might manage to lose. Phenomenal.
The forces, whatever you want to call them, that flipped a switch and vaulted Biden from fourth-place to presumptive nominee in eight days or whatever weren't going to suddenly back off or stop being shitty. This is how it had to be, which one they chose really didn't matter.

Using congress to smear Joe Biden is a crime when done to benefit Trump.  He should be investigated and thrown in jail.
I don't want it to be her but I think you're right. I was hoping for Karen Bass as she's the most progressive. I hope when Biden wins he appoints Kamala Harris as attorney general.

Real Americans need to vote Biden no matter who he chooses. The alternative is an unchecked Trump, who will only get crazier, more ruthless, lie more, and become more corrupt.
I also live in MN-in Duluth. I literally see NO Biden signs but I see trump signs on more and more cars but no one wants to put them on their yard. Except a few people. I’m trying to figure out how I can start something to get our governor out! Or how to start impeachment!

When did Biden withhold money? And Trump blocked dozens of people testifying, which made for a completely unfair trial. And even further, a few people did say in as many words that he withheld money in exchange for political dirt. Biden wasn’t guilty, so he didn’t block anyone.
I agree with you but it seems like he’s just not mentally there. I saw a thing where he thought Arizona was a city and that he told voters he was running for senate 😂 hopefully he’ll have a good VP because Biden’s brain isn’t making it 4 years

Does Joe Biden know more than a single health official quoted in this article?
Many here want universal health coverage. Unless we get a Democratic majority in the Senate (or find some long-lost Republican moderates), the bill won't reach Biden's desk. What's important for the election is to flip the Senate. Then we can talk tactics. Need more on Team Blue.
Biden was probably in my top 10, but not too 5.  I definitely agree with this sentiment though.
I’m just so tired of the shit where anyone remotely criticizes Biden or Harris and some lib is like “okay I guess you want trump to win then” as if that’s an argument
Dude liberals really think “at least he’s not Trump” is a good argument for Joe Biden. At best he’ll choose marginally better SC Justices, but honestly pretty sure libs just think trump is obnoxious and mean and think the country would look better with someone else.
For them to embrace to political left is for them to reject the corporate donations that keep them rich and powerful, and that won’t happen, so of course Biden would rather choose Harris and fight for conservative votes than skew remotely to the left.
It makes no sense to say “push Biden left,” because the political left lies on a wholly different spectrum from neoliberalism. That’s why conservative politicians can support trump but liberal politicians won’t support Bernie; Trump didn’t question capitalism and Bernie did.
Or until Nov ... right Biden? I’m pretty sure that’s how this will work

I think he was trying to intimate that Harris was so critical of Biden, that Trump wanted her to run with him
To those who think Biden/Harris aren't progressive enough--If progressive legislation is passed in Congress, Biden will sign it.  That's why down-ballot races are so important. Execs set the tone, but Congress is where the work will get hammered out.  Vote Blue in all contests.
Biden selects Kamala Harris as running mate ----&gt; Biden is now "on the clock" and has become expendable.   Hopefully no [187], but these folks don't care.
Republicans are failing to realize.  Kamala Harris isn't running for president! Joe Biden will be the one that'll wipe the floor with Trump!
I figure most of the progressive agenda needs legislative work.  That just makes down-ballot races crucial.  Don’t fret about Biden/Harris. Work hard to get Democrats elected to Congress and state houses.  Pay attention to any judges on the ballot, too.

You do realize that Biden is only three years older than Trump? Rightwing polllsters have already given up on polling and realize Biden is going to win. Doesn’t matter, it’s much more important to end Trump’s presidency.
I bet you were all over Joe Biden the other day too. But now, you can say we don’t look at facts and that’s ok? You see that hypocrisy. When it’s good for you, the rest of us can’t comprehend. When it’s bad it’s oh don’t lump us all together. Right??
Anybody who is triggered by my tweets, rest assured, if Hilary or Biden were proving themselves as incompetent, I’d say the same thing. I could care less about right, left, or upside down. This country needs leadership and we do not have it.
Amy called Biden and asked to be dropped from consideration.  She actually told Biden she was withdrawing because she believed the 2020 VP pick should be a woman of color.

Secure drop boxes are a great idea, especially since we just had an actual *theft* of a mailbox over the weekend.  Who knew mailboxes could be stuffed in a van?  Not trying to unjustly accuse but it doesn't seem like something a Biden supporter would do.

Is Biden announcing today? About time. In a nonpandemic time, the Dem convention would have already happened, and we'd have known for weeks.
And also that they can attack Biden for "being senile". There are tons of other things that are WAY more valid to attack Biden on. Plus Trump's insistence that the 1918 pandemic was in 1917 is just... Weird.
America.  Let's not for get, it was President Obama and Joe Biden that lead the American people out if the deepest recession in decades, without America never missing a beat. It also was the two of them that stopped what would've been a pandemic in its tracks. Never forget!
Wish Michelle Obama.  Could be Joe Biden VP. no pressure. It would definitely be a blow out ticket! Landslides of all Landslides!
Without Dems in control of the Senate, immigration reform and any number of important issues will continue to languish in Congress.  Bills cannot make it to Pres Biden if they aren't brought up and passed in the Senate.  Vote Blue up and down the ballot.  🌊
By the numbers only, is Biden wrong though? Where does the black vote usually go?
hey Pete, Biden wants to get rid the 2nd amendment?  He is a gun owner right now. Has Trump ever been a fun owner?
I hate Biden but I'm still going to vote for him. Why? Because its going to be biden or trump and I for one don't want another 4 years of that walking shitstain destroying this country.  Also keep in mind its not just biden we are voting for -c-
People need to stop posting things about the shitty stuff Biden has said or done. Yes, we get it, he is not great by any means but crap like that is going to convince people to just not vote and every single vote not for Biden is one less trump needs to worry about.Bush Jr. is really the worst president. Biden and Bush's administration is created the Patriot Act. They put on on a path of the end of Habeas Corpus.
Politics just got so much more sneaky in America... using Biden as a shield for the real presidential candidate is genius. On the right, strong candidate with weak vp on the left weak candidate with a strong strong vp
Finally asked how she could call Biden a racist on stage and now be on the same ticket, Kamala replies:  “It was a debate. A debate.”  “So you didn’t mean it?”  “Debate. Debate!” Amid strange laughs.  Exhibit 8B of why she was not a good choice for Biden.
But Biden/Harris calling for a national mask mandate is totally the authoritarian ticket in this election
Ok we get it Kamala Harris is a Narc. Her and Biden are a reunion tour of the crime bill. It sucks.....but let’s be real y’all stop playing and tell people to vote for them before we get stuck with homeboy again 🙄
My father was a Navy Vet of the Korean War. He and his group of Vets of the Local VFW all Trump voters. They were all Wartime Vets. Proud of their service, proud of their President who appreciates them and fights for their rights that the dirtbag Biden doesn’t care  1 bit about
i dont understand how people will "Hold his feet to the fire"  this entire election cycle has proven they can just do whatever, whenever and people will fall in line. a fucking cop as VP in 2020 and people are lapping it up. biden don't care what anybody thinks
What if after they were elected, Biden was unable, and then we find that Kamala is not legit... guess who gets to take over? Nazi Pelozi! It's an excellent eEeeEeEvil plan!
Cant help but think #Biden is the corp overlords, forcing ppl to work slave wages while #Kamala is the thin blue line, killing us telling us “im not gonna do something that only benefits black ppl” while #Trump is the feds, breaking laws/shredding civil rights  #FuckTheDuopoly
well, those challenges will take quite some time. good thing Biden and Harris will be the running the show in the meantime.
Biden chastised for 17 mph in fast lane,left turn signal on.
Seriously, part of the problem was various progressive take writers arguing she could be some sort of PM or something for Biden, it was dumb then and remains dumb now:
you are f-n sorry as puppet for Biden - go suck your own ass
Joe Biden. The placeholder candidate. #Election2020
The most frustrating part is that they agree that Biden is trash and still think that he deserves their vote. My hardest lefty friend even agrees with me that Obama sucked. Yet somehow still thinks Trump is worse.
And you want big brother Biden (I couldn't pass on the alliteration) telling you how to think. You know, honored sir, we have more in common than what you may feel comfie with.
No, but I do think they seek power, and will do so within the Democratic Party if they can. And the Biden wing of the party may be too quick to welcome them.
Now we know why USPS is making headlines fueled by DNC. There is a vested interested in helping Biden win.
That Wallace/Trump interview was disastrous for Trump. Almost as bad as the one after that. Biden can just sit back and watch this clown self destruct.
Biden can’t be worse - Trump’s already proven he’s in way over his head and with disastrous results.
Fuck You  I Will Stand In Line ALL FUCKING DAY With My Covid Gear On To Vote Your Corrupt Ass Out Of Office! Robbing The USPS Isn't Stopping Me From Casting My Vote!! #BIDENHARRIS2020 #BidenHarris2020Landslide #Biden
YUP, Biden landslide
Warren &gt; Biden   Lol y’all fucked up
So since you don't think Biden can handle the situation, you can admit that you're not actually thinking of voting for him, right? You're saying that he's weak on crime and you wouldn't want a radical Democrat in the White House, right??
Kamala Harris and Joe Biden are far from perfect but it is a vote to get trump out, secure RBG’s Supreme Court seat, and restore all minorities &amp; LGBT+ rights that have been demolished by trump supporters. It’s not about those 2, it’s about all of us saving our lives from trump
Chances that The Robert's Court will care about lawsuits brought that claim rulemaking is void since the acting heads are in violation: Zero, as long as Trump or other Republican is Potus. Chances that the Robert's Court would have different findings under Biden, Harris? Not zero
And Biden's AG will head that investigation!
Or maybe the USPS endorsing Biden. The people charged with delivering all those mail in ballots. Hmmm,  what could go wrong there? DA
Do you losers get in a room to agree upon Obama/Biden/Comey cabal?
Does anyone else notice they aren't even trying to hide their lies and thievery?  Are we going to be able to try them when Biden is in? The insider trading from meetings prior to the #TrumpVirus, etc.
There's an organized group on here: Mangy Jay, Jeff Fecke, that Wilson Valdez account, etc. They have a DM or something and organize little micro-swarms in defense of Pelosi, Biden, etc. In their spare time they complain about Bernie and the Intercept a lot. It's a shtick
The argument is not Biden himself is going to save lives. The argument is that Trump’s and the goals of his party, are authored with the  explicit intent of harming a lot of vulnerable people. Of course work on the ground is most important. Trump is a deep impediment to that tho.
Biden has known her for years and he isn't a vindictive a-hole. He chose wisely.
Vote Biden.  We need to climb out of this pit.
There are a ton of them trolling Biden, acting as if they are concerned liberals.
California is in play? Biden is polling 30 points ahead there. He's polling 25 points ahead in New York.
People I won’t be voting for in November... #Trump #Biden
Well biden has a pulse . Not much of one but it ticks a little
Will you effectively be President Mr./ Mrs. Biden’s twitter writer? You seem smart enough I suppose.
Yep, they did it deceptively to make it sound worse than it was because trust me, they won't report the Q3 numbers the same way; although they will report the Q4 numbers to make them look ridiculously good if Biden wins.
My thinking is informed by Joe Biden's record. His past performance.   I expect him to repeat the same policy preferences that minimizes us, and maximizes his big donor friends.
Or to put it another way, the case that the race could dramatically change due to a Biden scandal or some sort of decline in COVID was far stronger in May than it is two weeks before Labor Day (after which lots of voters will start paying much more attention)
Good summary of the reasons why Biden is likely to win (yes there is still time for things to change but time keeps ticking away)
Anyone who supports Biden is betraying the working poor. Because that is what biden did as senator and as VP.   Biden is a war-making, deregulator funded by the financial industry, who expanded unconstitutional executive power, wars, mass incarceration, fossil fuels and misery!
Biden’s response when his hidden ear piece malfunctions at the debates.
Again,  hilarious someone backing Trump tosses out sexual assault allegations as criticism of Biden.  Everyone’s seen the law suits  has been involved in and had to pay millions to make go away.  How can you point at Biden, yet support a man that’s much worse?
I'm am saying the donors of the common people is who I want my candidate influences by.   I'm saying who funds the campaign matters!  That exactly what im saying.   Joe biden is funded by vile corrupt people and he cares about them!
FAKE NEWS: Joe Biden spreads unhinged conspiracy theory about the USPS removing mailboxes in Portland  via
Again Biden was propped up by big donors, dark money, pacs, and super packs funded by the big donors.   He did not depend on small donors.  You are in serious denial.   Sanders depended on a million small dollar donors. Biden depended on the plutocracy.   It's not the same thing.
I just hope that if Biden wins, we can put him in an orange jumpsuit!
You are comparing the kind of influence our revolution has on Bernie Sanders to Biden's financial supporters and groups?   It's willful ignorance to suggest Biden's dark money donors are the same kind of people who donate to our revolution!
Just as it takes one hip hop star - suffering from mental illness - to sabotage the Black vote for Biden. Smh 🤦🏾‍♀️ 🤯
U seen Biden old ass 👀
Tr*mp supporters don’t know we are losing with biden because Bernie is the only change maker.  We are being considerate when they call us names and we do not call them names back. There is a reason to be angry with them though because he is so rude!
Okay it’s time we talk about how the FUCK did BIDEN and CLINTON get those nominations over BERNIE? Not even just looking at their political stances, but at their ACTUAL supporters. There has GOT TO BE people working actively against him being in office. Send tweet.
Biden supporters launched Dark money groups, I do over simplify Super Pacs into the dark money phrase.   It's willful ignorance on your part to not understand that how Joe funds his campaign, effects how he will govern.   Biden is a puppet to the big donors.  He served them!
My thoughts exactly, and this should be implemented day one of the Biden/Harris term
I can't wait to hear Biden pronounce Mykola Zlochevsky.
I’m white. I went to trade school. I’m voting for Biden. Also who are these people being polled? No one has ever asked me🤔
Joe Biden-"I just voted to make gay marriage illegal"!
Go vote for the other Biden then, Jack!
The question is: will media allow Biden and Harris to continue not answering questions? You would think that some ethics might still be relevant for journalists - this far those seem to be lacking. A major party candidate has been in a hidey hole for 3 months and media takes it.
Moreover they are extreme-right. E.g. Biden's closer to, say, Milton Friedman's views than the actual center.
Super Pacs funded by the financial industry. Are what I call dark money.  Sanders was largely funded by a million small donors. He did not depend on Super Pacs, or meet with big donors to reassure them "Nothing would fundamentally change".  I agree Biden didn't rely on grassroots
Alicia Mendoza, do you understand the difference between voting at the Democratic National Convention next week vs a vote in November General Election? Bernie wants his delegates next week to vote for for Bernie. Then he wants his supporters to vote for Biden in November!
What the fuck even was that conversation. She also had a totally incorrect timeline for when people were dropping out and endorsing Biden, and had totally the wrong idea about how people were doing in actual delegates and votes before that happened.
I agree Biden is not the choice if you want personal freedoms, but literally any mainstream candidate isn’t either. To enforce these laws they support massive police forces and funding and nobody wants it to stop since it’s lining there pockets 🤷🏼‍♂️
Me too.  I think Biden has been anal probed by many aliens
I am voting for Biden and Harris. I'm doing this without reservation. I will mark their names on the ballot gleefully and of my own sound mind. I totally and fully support them.  But goddammit, we missed an opportunity with Warren.
my problem with Biden is that he's too similar to Trump
The country in its current state existed before Trump and will continue exist with Biden.
Another disadvantage of tweeting under your real name: it’ll be easier for the #tRUmpstapo to find you.
She was an Attorney General that prosecuted violent criminals. How many violent criminals that Mike Pence put behind bars? Trump and his allies should just drop the anti-cop trope against Biden because it sounds freaking stupid at this point.  The anti-cop folks hate Harris BtW..
Again, without DARK money and a corrupt media propping up Joe Biden, he would not be the presumptive nominee.  Also, Biden was funded by the plutocracy, Sanders was funded by the people. I guess you can't tell the difference?
To clarify, I don't think Biden will "save" anything or anyone  But if he somehow doesn't ratfuck labor and delivers on his positions, he'll be giving us the tools to move past him
It sucks, and I'm never gonna do the whole Blue Vote Browbeat. But Biden at least has a few appeals to pro-labor policies as opposed to Trump trying to trample them, and I trust the ability of a union to throttle the economy more than any elected right now, so
I thought for sure you were JFK Jr.!
I had been expecting a major drop in the stock market as a result of congresse's stimulus failure. So far that hasn't happened. It could be that the markets are already anticipating Trump leaving office &amp; speculating on a more stabil &amp; predictable economy under Biden.
Biden/Harris - Pro Unbridled On Demand Abortion Paid for by us - taxpayers 😡
Are you ... JFK Jr.?!
Kamala and biden have told more lies in three days than Trump has told in his almost 3 years. Keep talking Bette. Conservatives love you! 🤭🤣
John McCain born in Panama, no problem. Ted Cruz born in Canada, crickets. Kamala Harris born in US ... Ineligible! #KamalaHarris  via
Friends, if Joe Biden was not propped up by dark money and a corrupt, corporate media, Bernie Sanders would likely win!
“In the context of Biden’s words, this is evident. Clearly some, including those without that context, have wrongly attributed Biden’s words to Johannes, and in doing so have attributed abhorrent and inaccurate motives to him.” 👍👍
Hey, I just filled out my request for an absentee ballot so I can legitimately mail my vote in. You are a con artist Mr. Biden.
Even Joe Biden has stated this won't be an easy transition. tRump's going to do all he can to lie &amp; cheat his way into staying #FakePresident. The only thing I see that will stop him is the continuation of his Impeachment, w honest members &amp; changing of laws. 😾😾😷
Thats great. The dems now Fascists won't be able to cheat. POTUS cares about this country and its not looking so good with an unlikeable wench and a biden that does not remember who his is running agaisnt. Tell the truth
Why don't you ask Master Bates why #JoeBiden doesn't go out and campaign?  #Biden
Trump Proves Biden Right on USPS Funding, Mail-In Ballots  via
I don’t even want to visit with my relatives who are conservative.. republican.. you know 😒 just saw a fb post “if you think Biden will change anything, you’re an idiot” from my fam so..just tired of it. Unfollowed.
Biden’s not the one taking cognitive testing. Who brags about remembering 5 words in a row?  It’s absolutely laughable.  You can make stuff up all you want about Biden...we’ve got the Truth to look at about  He thinks remembering 5 words is an accomplishment. Lol
Agreed. I think we all need to be careful about despair turning into inaction. There are LOTS of ways u can help with elections efforts (volunteering, donations, just texting the Biden supporters in your life) and your words may encourage others to dismiss this as “wasted time.”
(Also, people who would need to be shamed into voting for Biden are probably not following any of us on Twitter)
So You’re voting for Trump then because..... ? Kanye is a fuckin joke so you either swallow your pride and vote Biden or vote Trump to support hatred and racism
This Sedaris quote has been around since 2008. Let’s consider updating: Biden is the shit-glass; Trump is a bullet in your brain.  Analogies. You can do whatever you want with ‘em!
That "plan" also requires 2 more democratic presidents in succession following Biden to accomplish. We saw the damage Trump has done to healthcare in one term, yet you still want to take that risk on behalf of poor / underinsured Americans?

“We are speaking about a man whom Obama’s Secretary of Defense depicted as “....wrong on nearly every major foreign policy question.” Wrong for a half century in Washington D.C.”  The Biden Follies
She also has the same level of ability to string together complete English sentences as Joe Biden
After 32 yrs of campaigning, donating, volunteering for Dems, I'm done. They pander to Republicans. They have PAC money from BUSH OFFICIALS (war criminals). These Repubs pushing for Biden want something in return and I'm not willing to go any further right to vote for them.
But she should really be addressed as Senator Harris, with respect. Until she’s Madame President, that is (I don’t see Biden finishing the term).
Unsure, but boy do people get mad when the left brings up Biden's decades of right wing policies or Kamala leaning into Tough On Crime
Biden was VP for the first Black president in American history. Obviously super racist lol
It's 2020 and Biden has no problem condemning racism and white supremacy. President Pussy Grabber just says there are fine people on both sides.
President Biden &amp; Vice President Harris 🇺🇸💙
So if everything needs changing why hasnt career politician Joe Biden done anything??   Why is it Trumps fault career politicians haven’t been successful?  Maybe because they have other agendas?  Hmmmm.
You are actively doing the opposite of holding the moderates feet to the fire
Your president has officially declared war on the service which people I love rely on for political reasons. You have proven yourself loyal to Trump over American citizens who need support during a pandemic, and your kind have inspired me to devote myself to Biden’s campaign.
If you had told me in high school that I'd still be forced to listen to what Donald Trump, Joe Biden, and Marge Simpson think about things in my 40s, I would have paid more attention in science class and shot myself into the sun.
Biden is not in a position of authority to order anyone to do anything.  Just because he is running for president doesn’t give him any power to order everyone to wear masks until November 3rd.  I’m pretty sure its the exact date he’s going for.
Quite a headline, when it is 46 states
I've got some #woke homeless youth on my caseload who want to know why y'all just talkin about #biden &amp; #Trump   And they just turned 18. #Voters  #FakeNewsMedia #YOUTH #armyofGod

So an imperialist, just like Biden.
Unlike most potential presidents, no one knows what Biden stands for. He’s the figurehead for a shaky coalition that harbors radical views, writes     Democrats didn’t pick Mr. Biden because he’s moderate, they picked him because he’s weak

I'm not convinced it matters if you admit you'll vote for Biden or not. They don't care about our votes. They don't want people like us to be anywhere near their party. Someone like Biden in particular will never genuinely move left on anything of significance.
My life does depend on it which is why I'm voting for Biden and Harris, you washed up second rate has been.
It’s definitely important to identify and critique Biden/Harris *once we get them in office*. Right now those critiques are only serving to discount the campaign and give Trump leverage. Yes it’s a broken stupid system. We can’t fix it til we ax Don

So Trump campaign tweeted out mugshots of black people out on bail to scare people as though Biden will be letting out every black person in prison to terrorize white folk.  How about tweeting out pics of Trump in prison stripes?  That's where he should be.

The bots that run the Biden/Harris campaign are not very intelligent. They continue to spam us without keeping track of whether or not we have endorsed or given (I've done both). I know, spamming is part of the game; but when it happens via text message it gets annoying.
Rural MN and WI I have seen countless Trump and Back the Blue signs. In Mpls I have not seen one Trump sign but many BLM and a homemade “We Respect Black Rage” sign. No Biden signs at all.
What if his name was Job Biden?
Exactly. If Kanye drops out I'm voting for Trump.  I hope he costs Biden the election. The Dems shouldnt have screwed Yang.
True bit given all this either the polls are even that much further offor people are dumb. Biden shoyld be down 10 points
The audacity of Biden voters telling non-supporters to check their privilege lmaoo
Yup, and if Biden had won the nom and lost we would be reading takes about: How could the Democratic establishment have been so STUPID as to nominate a boring old white man with a lot of baggage rather than the most qualified candidate woman candidate ever! etc etc etc
Funny how they have nothing to say about Trump's father buying his way into University and the fact he had to PAY SOMEONE ELSE to even get his scores up high enough.  But yeah, Biden in 3rd grade.
Where were u when Biden was Being Falsely Accused?
There's absolutely no room for doubt. Every problem we have with Biden and his administration can be handled because they respect the process, the same can't be said for Trump.
Nah, he'll just use the Obama strategy and only hold pressers every 3 months.  But he handles the hostile media pretty well, and when he has a stroke it will be long after his second term.  Biden may have already had one.
I cannot think of a more perfect encapsulation of King Trump's presidency:
Maybe Trump should adopt the Biden model:  only call on friendly press with pre-approved questions.  No, Trump is smart enough and courageous enough to take this shit from a hostile media on a daily basis.
Joe Biden should’ve made Dr. Umar VP

There is not one swing voter who was concerned about Biden’s third grade experience.
No, bringing the GOP into the democratic party will actually shift policy to the right.  Especially with a republican friendly president like Biden.   It's like you don't know how this works.
I'd rather vote for somebody who won't be president than to vote for Biden or Trump.  I personally think black voters should refuse to vote for any candidate that isn't black until we get a totally pro black agenda.

Wowza! Mika 🔥🔥🔥today  Morning Joe 8/14/20  As the president brushes aside a question about lying in office and the Senate adjourns until September, new polling shows Joe Biden leading the president 53 to 42 percent.
all of your tweets are about biden and harris. who has the syndrome?  😂
this isnt a game sir. joseph robinette biden has to answer for these misdeeds. is his campaign involved? how do we know? we must investigate this.
Health care policy explained: Joe Biden will sign any health care bill that a Dem Congress can pass. What he and VP Harris think in their heart of hearts really isn't that important.
Ralph Nader has done more good than Al Gore, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Joe Biden combined.
It makes me feel deep rage to see people on my Facebook timeline push the Biden/Harris ticket and say NOTHING about the fact that encampments are getting BULLDOZED by the POLICE right NOW.
Presidential hopeful Joe Biden suggests national mask mandate

oh man. biden campaign in shambles then.
LOL! Touche! I guess trumphumpers are cool with mocking people with disabilities.  C U Next Tuesday is probably uninformed about Biden's stuttering issues since childhood.
And the best part is... all I picked up from this graphic is that Joe Biden will actually... put in work?
biden is done for sure. you convinced me!

Who cares what celebrities back who? Basing your decision on a celebrity thinks is sadly commonplace in America. Not a Trump supporter, quite the opposite, but I’m not ecstatic about the thought of Biden/Harris running the country either.
i was told durham would bring down biden. isnt this it?
I get the sense that she's been administering blowjobs to get fingered for this position, and it hasn't been with Biden.
Watch the media start trying to sway voters by saying biden is gonna do what Bernie wanted... but if that’s the case... why did the Democratic Party support Bernie to begin with.... that’s all imma say.
who will the dems run now that biden has to drop out due to this bombshell?
who will the dems run now that biden will have to drop out?
this confirms biden is done. wow. what a day.
tbf Dems like Pelosi and Biden did a lot of heavy lifting to get the country to go along with this neocon agenda
pretty sure biden is done. pack it up folks. trump wins.
oh man biden's done for sure  😂
Once again, this hardly address Biden’s touchy feelies with little girls , and, yes, an affair with a consenting adult is better than feeling up young girls.
President Trump rejects Biden call for federal mask mandate lasting through to the election.
This is also just lazy: if you read Richard Ben Cramer's What It Takes he does a good job of pointing out that young Biden was one of those people who was reasonably smart but just never took higher education seriously as he had other priorities in his life...
Do I look like Biden or the DNC? Why would I spend my morning trying to imagine what their rationale was in picking Harris and explaining it to a maga troll? She's the pick. She's qualified. Who would you have preferred??
I’m seeing a lot of angst on my timeline about USPS &amp; Trump. 1 of the ways you can help is by asking Biden supporters about their voting plan. I promise there is someone that doesn’t know to vote early, who isnt registered, &amp; they probably aren’t on your Twitter feed-go text them
TIL twitter dumbasses think Im actually Joe Biden.
Tax reductions seem unlikely given the enormous fiscal response to the Covid-19 business disruptions. Biden’s tax plan offers a glimpse of what we may be facing in 2021 and beyond.

Biden drafted mass incarceration legislature and Harris locked up black men for weed while joking about doing it herself.  Furthermore Demokkkrats have done nothing but pander to black voters and make empty promises for over 30 years, sorry if I don't believe them.
Okay look, I know better than to expect any kind of sense from Shiny Paste and Polyester, but tweeting out this lovely photo is as dumb as when whatsisname tweeted that adorable pic of Biden with his little boy and was like “BURN amirite”
Not to equate them more deeply, but in terms of public posture and confidence, this is so like our president and Joe Biden.
Vote for Biden. First we deal with the threat to our very democracy, then we deal with the other party.
Joe Biden holding the roadmap to electoral victory
I disagreed with Obama’s decision not to investigate/prosecute the decisions to torture, the bank meltdown, etc. It enabled the GOP &amp; the prez to demolish norms and institutions. Biden would shy away from it, but there needs to be some kind of Truth &amp; Reconciliation comission.

We are better than this moment.  New video by the Lincoln project.  We cannot take four more years.  Vote for Biden.
The science also doesn’t call for a national mask mandate that includes every citizen to wear masks inside and outside...will you point that out to Mr. Biden. Also, you’re on record that Hydroxychloroquine helped your spouse - is that science then? Thank you.

Kamala Harris Climate Record: Where Joe Biden's Running Mate Stands - Bloomberg
Remember how left-leaning news ran with a narrative that Biden was the "most-electable" candidate?  Like that.
I hope she still will! She is a treasure that can rock a top position in the Biden administration, we need her!
Haha civilized human being , Biden doesn’t even know where he is most days or what is actually coming out of his mouth.
Because Biden is not in control of anything he says. This is the far left telling him what to say.  Unbelievable
I was voting for Biden no matter what, from the grave, if necessary
Politicians campaign where they have a chance of winning.  To do otherwise would be a waste of time and resources.  Do you think Biden will campaign in Alabama or Mississippi?  It's not a matter of caring.  It's a matter of getting to 270 electoral votes.

This is skewed by what the poll considers "white Christians". They should have a category for so called "evangelicals" because I was Methodist now Lutheran and ALL white Christians I know support Biden.
Ha! ^ Good take Danny. You seem ALL IN on Kamala or “don’t matter, anyone but Trump”? It troubling how she called Biden a segregationist, suggested he drop out, believed accusers, but now all good 🤷‍♂️ - phony? We think a mistake it’s not Amy. Is this our winning ticket? Ughh 🥴😩
I really hope Biden wins just so we can bring back “hi I’m in Delaware”
Just saw a biden ad where he talked for 20 seconds about a desk and then concluded with "it's not about the desk, it's the person behind it" and like damn, huge if true
He's worse Nixon tried to pass UBI before the Democrats stopped him, he also believed in socialized medicine. So Biden is actually to the right of Nixon, as is most of the Democratic party.
#VA05 Dem internal has Good up 44%-42% and Trump up 47%-45%.  Pretty solid number for Biden in a district Clinton lost by 11.
Followed all I wasn't already. Nice to meet you all. I do block people who are saying they won't vote Biden/Harris for any reason. ABirkshire, for example. Was warned last night, checked, pinned tweet saying so. This is too important to not support this ticket. We must unite.

Not to mention, no talk of how many delegates Biden received in 2008.
Mainly my point is biden was instrumental in building the circumstances we find ourselves in, and effectively gave us trump. Handing him the reigns is like asking OG dark lord to have another shot
Why are we talking about bernie  Biden seems okay to people that think obama did things that made stuff seem ok when obama was an imperialist war monger riding the final years of "functional" neoliberalism. Biden is an authoritarian that will enter office during cap in crisis

I know the parties are ruled by donors and $$$, but imagine a parallel universe where Biden and Harris made an announcement that the pandemic has caused them to reassess his position on M4A. Make her the point person, she sells it well.  Devastating weapon against Trump and GOP.
Long story short? The states likely to see a breakdown over mail voting are isolated. And the states Biden likely will win with have well-run vote counting. (ie Biden is at 289 electoral votes with states that are Low/Moderate "post office risk.")
I suspect Biden will have a lot of progressives on board. But he needs to win first.

I saw more Biden signs than Trump signs on a recent drive through rural Central Wisconsin.
So Biden/Harris is a 2:1 margin?
Indeed. Trump and his allies, such as the DC examiner are trying to simultaneously paint a picture that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are far left and then post articles about how the far left don’t like them.
More like letting morgoth have the one ring   Biden engineered the world that gave us trump

Fascism is capitalisms immune response to its own contradictions. It will happen unless these contradictions are addressed. A biden ticket will just maintain the status quo, and thus fascism will continue to rise.

First, it's Aryan Nation.  Second, it's the democrats who founded the KKK and fought for segregation (Biden supported Ayran  views).  Third, the left has been screaming RACIST! at conservatives for decades as a political tactic.  Read Saul Alinsky's Rules for Radicals.
You think Trump has a 1 in 5 chance of winning the popular vote? That seems VERY generous if you look at the 2016 election, Trumps approval numbers throughout his presidency, the popularity of Biden vs Hillary and the enduring failure of Trump’s COVID response.
Donald Trump can’t run on his record, so the focus is on attacking Biden.

Biden ('s handlers) are liars to the bone!!  Kamala fits right into that crowd!
Ralph Nader is responsible for the Iraq War, but Joe Biden, who voted for it, is not
Keep watching. The more you lie and support liars the more they will slip in the polls. Biden and Kamala havent told the truth once yet and neither have you.
No! JOE BIDEN did advocate for a national mask mandate BUT of course, he is playing on the fears of his voting minions, who seem to be afraid of their shadows!!
So… If Biden/Harris were president, they wouldn’t have shut down the economy?  I’m sure Harris knows that’s not true.  I’m pretty sure Harris’s target demographic doesn’t.

No. It might just keep him in some sort of check until Biden's inauguration.
Biden-Harris looks like a ticket content to sit on its lead, the way Governor Dewey did in 1948. Though rivals in the primaries, the running-mates have similar anti-crime records, even though their base demands an end to policing.  Patrick Buchanan writes:
Immediate block of anyone who suggests AOC, Buttigieg or Yang as members of a Biden cabinet.  I can't deal with anyone who's that stupid.  Also, I unfollow/mute/block anyone who defends any JD, especially a member of the 'squad'.  No JD is an ally, even if you may think otherwise

No I'm voting Kanye even though I know it helps Trump. Biden is responsible for many mass incarcerated black men with the 94 crime bill. Kamala is too from her days as a prosecutor.  Say what you want about Trump but I'll take him over Biden any day.

For sure, Biden did tweet about how we need to fund pandemic prevention back in October 2019 and I think I can safely say we would have less deaths if he were at the helm. No way his admin would be shitting on Fauci.
I can’t even imagine how out of touch you have to be to think that people who are unhappy with Biden and the Dem establishment are Russian bots or sympathizers
Biden is just politicizing this, he isn't actually thinking this is the right way to handle it.  No, we shouldn't mandate from the federal government.

When Biden is our President, things will get better!
But when someone says I’ll take him out behind the shed and beat the crap out of him it’s totally cool? Just gauging your outrage here.
Biden. That seems obvious.
I wait and wait for Biden, Harris or any other prominent Democrat to stand up and condemn the violence we are seeing in major cities.  Instead, they are excusing or denying that it exists.  How can they save the country if they won’t look at reality?
Actually, I haven’t seen pictures of him touching young girls inappropriately.  It is rather interesting that instead of defending Biden, you jump to accusing Trump.  If you “know” Trump is a molester, how do you feel about Biden’s public groping of young girls and women?
Jim you know that’s a complete lie.  Joe Biden is not qualified to be the president either and you know that as well!!!!
Are you writing this same shit about Biden or Trump or Pence? Or is it just the woman’s choice in clothing that will be scrutinized?
I’m going to share this again. This is just one person, but there are many more like him. We are screwed if people like him vote so carelessly. He won’t vote Biden because he doesn’t like Harris. He feels no pain, because he doesn’t care about anyone but himself. Selfish...
We are here because of too many Americans are still complacent. I have many friends who don’t pay any attention at all. In fact I had one tell me the other day he wouldn’t vote for Biden since he picked Kamala. He will write in Bloomberg! WTF

Here’s the Democratic convention info- it starts Dec. 17th. My main feeling about it right now is disgust. The DNC shut down the process back in Spring when they picked Biden. Half the states never got to vote with the full slate of candidates.

That is what Trump called Hillary in the 2016 campaign.  So it was a way for people who supported Hillary to turn his words around with sarcasm to show their support for her.  He called Harris a nasty woman within hours of Biden announcing her as his choice for running mate too.
Joe Biden called for a nationwide mask mandate, citing experts’ predictions that it could save 40,000 lives from COVID-19 in the coming months.  #Sunrisers, would you support a nationwide mask mandate?

Just a reminder that even though Biden and Kamala kinda suck if they lose to trump the dnc will go further right wing, cause they are by far the most progressive democratic ticket in recent history Just fucking vote for them, facism or some wierd libs shouldn’t be a tough choice
Did this man Biden really say it's not about ur rights, it's about respect ... Lmaoooo

With their pointless escalation of conflict in America’s cities Trump and Cotton let Biden and the Democrats off any hook for having to answer tough questions about how they regard violence by social justice or just underclass mobs. They can and will just decry regime response.
Can the USPS accept donations? Using the 2016 popular vote for Clinton - if everyone who wants to vote Biden by mail paid 5 bucks a month for the next four months it would raise around a billion dollars and break the GoFundMe platform.

Yeah, but Trump is doing everything he can to do things without you. So, put together a plan so that if Biden wins, day one the House is ready to make sure this can never happen again. Otherwise, just tweets.

Joe Biden can bl0w me.
I understand that POV, however, I think I’m just more optimistic. Parties move with public opinion, and public opinion on climate change action, health care, and other topics is shifting drastically. If Biden doesn’t act on his promises, I promise in 2024 I’ll be on your side.
Trump will repulse women away with his sexist rhetoric even further...I think Biden is going to win WW
I personally think the way to go about it isn’t a hashtag that will fall off the trending tab by morning. I believe the way to do that is to get a man willing to change into office (Biden in this case), then use the power of our base to get change done.
Out of curiousity do you think everything is fine and dandy right now ? Our current administration is a shit show. I didn’t want Biden but that’s ok. I want our country to come together again. I want to sleep at night. Donald Trump is a monster and a horrible human.
In the meantime, Biden &amp; Harris want to mandate masks lol!

I understand that. The information of the damage 45 has done to us in every aspect is there.“I’m not voting” feels like a slap in the face in the same way that people saying vote for Biden does to Black people (not claiming to understand the plight just comparing the emotions).

Did Biden Just Paint Himself into a Corner?
The Trump administration got rid of a bloated team of bureaucrats, but once we knew that China and the WHO had been lying to us, in a week he put together a stronger team of medical professionals and dealt with the pandemic better than Hillary ever could.  Biden would be lost.
Well, if it will only save 40,000 lives, won't it be a waste of time now that we have lost 350 million people or so according to Biden. 😉
The most interesting take on this I’ve seen is that UAE is attempting to gain position on behalf of Arab world for when Biden wins whereby US diplomacy will be less critical of Arab aggression and shift focus toward Iran as common enemy.
kills his victim so he can not be sent to jail for life! This is what you get when you vote for Harris/Biden in November! Wait until you/family are the victim and MSM thinks you are as Hillary said deplorable!
We’ve already seen the leaders of the world laughing at you  Remember that awesome NATO reception, where the cameras were on but they thought they were off? That’s reality. Them laughing behind your back. Not some made up propaganda spin you thought up on Biden.
Nice try using the democrat talking points (aka Excuses).  Listen to Biden talk from 10 years ago and it is obvious he has lost it.  Even democrat leadership knows it. You can keep up the illusion, but only until the first debate.  Then it's GAME OVER.
Didn’t she endorse Biden already? 🤨 I don’t see how she benefits from this. Republicans only like Dems when they actively criticize Dems as Dem office holders. They throw them away as soon as they leave office (as she’s doing), or switch parties.
grandpa simpson entering and leaving the burlesque house gif here. also are we just assuming biden is already a walking corpse or what
this is twitter girl, watch her instagram, she;s way more thorough there. Just because she expresses her frustrations with the people who won't vote for biden doesn't mean she doesn't acknowledge the pain that they have and most likely will continue to cause as politicians!

The biggest problem I see with Biden winning and then packing the courts is that this will not be considered for even a second. So we get more progressive judges on a cultural scale but remain stuck with a massively pro-carceral bench

Biden tied in CO-03 is probabily the type of scenario where he is winning statewide in thr neighborhood of 15.

While I don’t doubt that Biden could very well outperform Clinton in the 3rd by at least a few points, outrunner her by 12 points may be a bridge too far if Biden is under 10 nationally.
So should we all start sending Biden-Harris mail to our conservative relatives via USPS now thru November?
Hillary Clinton in 2016 is the reason we have Trump. There was NO WAY I was voting for Hillary. So I didn't vote at all.  This year I'll vote Biden because anything is better than Trump. Thank God, Hillary Clinton is not a choice.
I’m sorry but it’s annoying to see people acknowledging how amazing Kamala Harris is now that she has the official approval of Joe Biden and the mainstream white Democratic Party. People who ignored and/or disparaged her the past 2 years. Sigh…

I actually don’t smoke any weed, not sure where that comes from. You’re the ones that agreed with Pence, saying that this is Biden’s America. But it sure aeems like this is all happening during Trumps America, no?
I mandate a 2.4 oz stainless steel injection for mr biden
I feel the reaction to the Harris announcement supports the “lanes” theory of the primary, and Biden’s dominance of his lane forced Harris to run in a suboptimal lane for her.
Nah, think I'll hold Harris and Biden accountable now.
Well, not all politicians are the same. Politicians are receptive to ideas which fit with their party. Biden was receptive to change in terms of Gay Marriage, Criminal Justice, Climate Change, and Health Care. Trump wouldn’t capitulate on any of those issues no matter what.
"It's not about your rights; it's about your responsibilities." 👏👏👏
🇺🇸 Biden Harris 2020! For all of America! 🇺🇸
I think joe Biden should wear a helmet wherever he goes.
I don't care if millions of Americans are passionate about voting for Biden because he has "better hair". The right choice, whatever their reasons.
Fauci always wants the spotlight. Biden should have picked him as his VP.
Biden holds no office right now. Quit being such gaslighters #GOPBetrayedAmerica #GOPBetrayedAmerica #GOPBetrayedAmerica
In 2015, the media gave so much attention to Trump that, at this point, they owe the American People and Biden unlimited free commercials until Election Day.  Change my mind.
"Well I've got some red meat for ya.  We're not going to let Joe Biden and Kamala Harris cut America's meat"! 😱
Push your Biden!
to see Biden and Harris in office, Dems in control of the House and Senate, dozens of Trump Reich officials in court, a bunch of new Biden-appointed judges on the bench.  I would give up a year of my life to see that.  .  Help save the world.  Please, make it happen.  2/2
Hey Biden, how about passing legislation to make this permanent!
If you search for Emerson Mturk on here you'll get a lot of people smarter than me who can explain it better. But Biden was up 5 in the MU poll in WI a few days ago, and given history, I'd imagine MN to always end up 3-5 points to the left of WI b/c of how big the metro is.
Hillary Clinton suggests she's willing to serve in Biden administration: 'I'm ready to help any way I can'
Fun Review: All the times #KamalaHarris ripped #DemeniaJoeBiden during the #Democratic primary.  #Trump2020 #JoeBiden
Here we go again. A vote for Trump is a vote for a racist and shows that racism isn't a deal breaker for you. It's as simple as that. Fact check: Trump promotes another birther lie, this time about Kamala Harris
Biden needs to go to jail with his son!
He thinks “mail-in” is any scribbled napkin with Biden’s name on it that gets folded, stamped and mailed.
It likely won't, but that's what the Newsweek piece was getting at. I would suspect that Biden's camp did their homework &amp; then some before selecting Harris, so I can't see this going very far. Like similar challenges to selection, these claims often become distractions at best.
The brilliant statistician Andrew Gelman predicted that Hillary would win in 2016 with 98% certainty.   Unlike other pundits who get things very wrong, he wrote a detailed retrospective:   This year he is predicting Biden with 89% certainty though...
Lol. You support Biden???? LOLOLOL oh man people who want to normalize paedophiles are weird and gross.
And it seems we are powerless in stopping him.  I want to have hope and I’m truly excited about Biden/Harris, but this truly seems like a “you can’t fight city hall” situation.  Can no one stop him!?!?  He is doing it in real time.
For people in a party who changes their minds more than their clothes, that's sort of a dumbass thing to say. Especially with kamala and her accusations against biden.
I'm literally only voting for Biden if Trump doesn't back off on the payroll taxes, because if SS goes under, I get forced out on the street
This Minnesotan agrees wholeheartedly with you. And we were looking forward to a visit. Hopefully next summer after Biden/Harris win!
Remember, females are not important a Democrat...
Not true, if you work hard locally and down ballot. You hold your nose and vote Biden to get rid of Trump, and still Green up your state reps, etc.
Good. And given Fox News threats, I hope they have enough protection on Biden too.
I bet Biden has never had anyone pee on him #GoldenShowersTrump
One minute after Biden is sworn in, Trump will be trying to escape this country, mark my words...
“Every single American should be wearing a mask when they’re outside for the next three months at a minimum," Biden said.   Let me think...ok, no.
Terrible and unconstitutional. Outdoors is considered fine by the worlds experts. Buzzz off Biden.
I know Biden and Harris isn’t people’s first choice, but just ask yourself if it’s worth it to not vote for them and keep Trump in office the next 4 years. People who are voting for Trump are all going to vote. Get out there and get this deranged man out of office.
Are we really doing this again? It's so fucking funny that the Trump campaign is doing this while trying to pull the "Biden's the more racist candidate" bullshit.
Tell us how Joe Biden plans to take your penises…I mean guns…away. Also, I've been a bird hunter for 27 years and climate change will have a greater negative impact on pheasant and duck populations than any policy Biden supports. Sportsmen should care about conservation.
If ur in support of #BLM and #ACAB and ur going to vote 4 Biden/Harris, ur a hypocrite.  If you are not going to be part of the #generalstrike due 2 the govt not completing the stimulus package and supported Sanders, ur also a hypocrite.
Are you a big fan of Biden? Would you have picked him? I mean, dems could have picked Bernie (BLM fav.), Buttegieg (energy, personality). Dems could have picked Harris for pres. Instead, a tired old white man. It's almost like the dems want to lose. Why is that, do you think?
You think Biden's going to do anything about global warming? His own policy page puts carbon neutral in 2050 - 20 years to late to matter
Not Trump is pretty strong motivation for now; other motivations may grow as voters get to know Biden and Harris.  I
oh man do I want my now ex-friend, who is voting for trump with her hatred of Biden and Harris, to see this.
Biden and Kamala are racists. Trump has worked his entire life to help women, children and all minorities. #Joebidenisaracist #BLMDomesticTerrorists #AntifaTerrorists
Joe Biden has not submitted to live, in person, unscripted QandA from the media in months! Will media allow him to get away with that?! Regardless of political leanings- can’t we agree that NO major party candidate for POTUS can be allowed to dodge like this?! It’s appalling.

Trump said Biden is against god. Trump needs an exorcism!
'more palatable'? How was it even a question?  The choice is Biden or trump.  There are no acceptable qualifiers.  I'd vote for Biden if he'd picked a dust bunny as VP.
Trump: I say this as the President of the United States standing in the White House Press Briefing Room behind a podium with the Presidential Seal during an official update on the COVID-19 pandemic -- Joe Biden has no business politicizing the Chinese Virus sent to us by China!
Watching an old horror video game stream on youtube and at a tense moment the screen went black and a biden ad popped up
If you notice your mail has been delivered later than usual, this is done on purpose to rig the election in favor of Trump and the GOP.  Don't vote for them, vote for Biden and democrats. More better if it is progressive democrats.
Oops I am so sorry.... If Biden &amp; Harris win.
Well ID Niden &amp; Harris win we are screwed period Biden has always been racist, check it out. Why does government allows section eights it ruined the area I lived in. They get a half the price break out in nice suburbs. I am fed cons. Yet lower got changes. David J Harris UTube!!
“We’re not going to let Joe Biden and Kamala Harris cut America’s meat!”  That’s what he said.
The dream of Tammy/Tammy lives on in ‘28
I'm sorry but I can't get excited about Biden. It is so depressing that Trump and Biden are our best options..pitiful.  it's easy to lead from the sidelines as Biden is doing.   We badly need a 3rd party.
Lincoln logs for Biden.  Checkers are far too complex.
Bumbling Biden/Horrible Harris 2020!  Selling out to the...the..you know....the thing!
I have been all over Minnesota the past few weeks and I have seen so many Trump signs and flags.  I still have yet to see a single Biden sign anywhere, including downtown Minneapolis.
Took a hopeful hike to the top of Mt. Democrat and raised a little money for the Biden-Harris campaign, too!       #GoJoe2020 #BidenHarris #Democrats
2. Biden is a refreshing change from that.
Biden speaks like someone from your neighborhood. You can tell he lived in one. This is a quality he shares with Reagan. By itself that's not predictive of anything, but democrats have a tendency to speak in abstract ideas that ordinary people have a hard time connection with.
This was to be expected. But Biden needs to pick an AG who will promise the country that she will prosecute Trump to the fullest extent of the law once he is out of office.
Yeah Biden vs Ivanka? No thanks.
Status quo Biden and Copmala Harris?
What is TIPP.? i wonder what the real honest state of the race is. I would say  Trump plus 1 to biden plus 2.

Looking at that list, progressives should be pretty happy Biden picked Harris.

He is happy and respectful. Joe Biden truly loves the USA.
I've been voting dems since 1988. Incremental change doesn't even happen. But change does happen in leaps and bounds towards the right because of a failed Blue Dog strategy that coddles corporate donors over people. We will never get "left politics" with a Biden presidency.
Voting for Biden cabinet and I guess I’m anticipating us having our first female president by the looks of things. The dude is old.

Good catch - I flipped thru his plan again, and he's committed to net zero by 2050. He has a target for 2025, but he never commits to what that target is. Still - I think Greens would have an easier time lobbying Biden than Trump..
. is making history as  running mate. We sat down with a  professor of women and politics to talk about the decision.   “I think Harris, no matter the outcome, will make her mark.”
Many here want universal health coverage. Unless we get a Democratic majority in the Senate (or find some long-lost Republican moderates), the bill won't reach Biden's desk. What's important for the election is to flip the Senate. Then we can talk tactics. Need more on Team Blue.
What scares me a lot more is everyone's response to criticizing Biden or Harris is "GUESS YOU'RE PRO-TRUMP."  What a mess.
if i was 12 i would not make cold calls for biden and i would have sex but thats just me
What doesn't HIDE'n BIDEN lie about and walk away
Voting for Biden sucks, not voting sucks, and voting for trump is not possible  No good choices 😔
And if you're like "Wait, what about the presidential race?"   That was on Super Tuesday! Here are those results:    And a big 'ol precinct map showing Biden's domination:
Already assuming that Biden will be a non-issue in 2024?
1. USPS sabotage 2. Closing polling places 3. Russian interference 4. Biden/Harris "too corporate/capitalist" 5. Biden/Harris "too leftist/progressive" 6. Neverending American capacity for idiocy 7. Kanye 8. Media’s lack of attention span  This is how Trump will get re-elected.
Yeah, I really don't follow her since I have an essential job. Her father was friends with Biden. Trump expressed nothing but contempt for Sen. McCain.  If she's ignoring those hard facts I think she needs to... Take a seat in the back and STFU She's not relevant.  But she'll try
They are excellent for showing the American public how unfit he is. They are Biden ads, in real time.
AOC will be just old enough to run in 2024, though i definitely would not expect her to. gunning for Schumer’s seat in 2022 or when he retires (or Gillibrand’s seat she ends up a Biden cabinet member) is probably her best play if she wants to stay an elected official
Rumor has it that Trump is looking to replace Pence on the GOP ticket. I’m betting this guy just made the short list.
Well it’s not like Biden is trying to unite the party with universal healthcare policy(that 70% of registered voters support). Who is at fault for being divisive? The voter or the politician?
very weird that Pence can’t get a full 10% of the electorate who are already Trump voters to say they’d vote for him over Biden. the cult is, in some ways, limited to Trump. would love to see more polls try out this Q tho
Today I saw a Bernie yard sign with a note on it saying “okay fine, Biden” and I felt that
ever since joe biden released “kiss me thru the phone” back in 1981 life just ain’t felt the same
Of course  has to keep LYING to get through another AWFUL "press conference". He KNOWS he is full of BULLSHIT. Everyone knows this. They have no answer to the awesome   She is a POWERHOUSE! She &amp; Biden will steamroll Trump &amp; Pence!!
She isn’t even black!!  As the Left gushes over Joe Biden’s “black” woman VP pick, an unfortunate fact is surfacing about her ancestry. She doesn’t even have a SINGLE DROP of African-American blood!! Her dad is…
Kamala Harris has been officiating same-sex marriages since the early 2000s and fought against Prop 8 in California. Mike Pence promotes conversion therapy and says being gay is a choice.   🗣YOU ARE NOT AN ALLY IF YOU VOTE FOR ANYONE OTHER THAN BIDEN/HARRIS 2020
Guys I have a brilliant plan. While no one’s looking, let’s swap Biden with Ed Markey! They’re both old white guys and they’re wearing masks, so no one will notice
a reminder not to panic when the republicans are up after the RNC. the bounce will show them up or even, no matter how bad their convention is. biden will almost certainly win the popular vote. eking out the electoral will be tougher.
can’t wait to vote for biden in november because that will help the 20-40 million americans who will be evicted over the next few months 🙂
Remember when AOC said the tent was too big if Biden was in it?
Who does Biden think he is, he isn't part of the Govt and he isn't a doctor, he's garbage!
His election hysteria is ridiculous and drives me crazy. Did you see Claire McCaskill basically say we'll know Biden Won by 11pm on election night immediately after his we won't know for months nonsense? It was delicious!
A friend just got a text message saying, “[NAME], Bruce here from PR2020 w/ a non-partisan poll. Who do you support? (1) Trump; (2) Biden; (3) Undecided; (4) Opt-Out. REPLY for Opt-In. Thanks.”  Scam or innovation?

Top Secret : Biden learning to read again.
My opinion isn’t valid because I don’t have your education? That’s elitist. But my simple point was that the #1 goal for most dems in the primary was to get rid of trump. Many voters looked at the polls and saw Biden did the best. It’s not because people are stupid or manipulated
I get the whole "Anyone by Trump mentality", but wouldn't it be ironic if Biden\Harris won and they were somehow like way worse or even at an equal level to Trump?? Like what if A creepy old White dude named Joe and a creepy old White dude named Donald were like somewhat similar?
I agree!  Kamala is the best person Joe could have picked!  So let’s stop with the ‘she’s a woman and she’s a woman if color’.  Let’s just focus on the fact she’s the best person for VP! If Biden picked a man we wouldn’t have this discussion!
The only question is after Biden wins how fast will the GOP run away from Donald Trump and claim they never had anything to do with him?
Fits in with recent findings that voters are split over who they think will win.  The GOP downballot would really prefer if voters believed Biden would win.
Khloe gonna keep Biden honest that’s all be like I’m watching you

Those favorables in the new Fox poll show a pretty big split between Biden (+10) and Harris (+4) with Trump (-12) and Pence (-10).  (The poll has Biden leading Trump by 7)  The Harris number is only a sub-sample for part of the field period post-announcement.
You are conflating southern dem elected officials with southern dem primary voters. Their voice matters just as much as dems from blue states. We should just ignore dems in red states? Btw Biden also won most liberal blue states. If voters wanted something else they had options.

My Dad parroted this to me today- until I explained election law &amp; how Nominations work. Smh. He thinks Biden did “all this” to get Harris to be Pres./the Nominee.
You won’t like to hear this but Biden consistently outperformed all other candidates in polls against Trump. There were very rational reasons to vote for Biden. Black voters weren’t manipulated by the big bad media or the DNC. They saw that Biden had the best shot at winning.
With the exception of yourself and other qualified fact-checkers, no one should be attending these 'briefings' which are just attempts to keep lying until they catch on. The press should focus on Biden/Harris and covering the truth. Stop giving free campaign time on our $
I bet the Biden/Harris campaign knew he’d try this shit, and I bet they’re ready.
They also did a 2024 GOP primary ballot test.  Pence leads the field at 31% among Republicans.  The general population chooses Romney.  (Aided largely there by Democrats/Biden voters)
It's amazing how sad and desperate Team Trump is in their lazy lies about Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Trump and his team are pathetic.

yes but that's where this new generation of young bloods are caught up.  Its my way or the highway.  Vs Biden, sure absolutely center.  But he knows he has to be to actually get bills past, because politics suck.  Getting elected and just shouting stuff that never passes..
Watching the President of the United States admit he opposes funding for USPS because it will hurt him politically.   Insane.  Absolutely insane.   You may not like Biden, but I hope you like him more than Trump.  Seriously, enough hot takes. We have 82 days.

How can all of you Kamala lovers just so easily look past how contradicting she is. That's not a party thing that's a her thing. She only got 2% of her parties vote and was destroying Biden who she now kisses his ass. #thirdparty

The micromanaging of the convention (which is just a glorified professional conference!) was my breaking point. They are nihilists who are looking for any excuse not to vote for Biden. It’s immature and self defeating. It’s not a serious movement.
You may want to educate yourself before making such ridiculous statements. A little Obama/Biden fact sheet for you. Trump is a symptom, he's not th cause.
"The DNC" did not choose Biden - the voters did. The Democratic Party base voters are African-Americans (who chose Biden), not white hipster fauxcialists with podcasts who mistakenly thought it was a good strategy to run *against* the Obama legacy *in a Democratic primary*.
What Biden said about Latinx voters was accurate. Some are very conservative...voting against their best interests.

Continue criticizing Biden/Harris (cuz fuck them), but don’t think that means your job is done. Holding both parties accountable doesn’t mean posting your opinions on social media, it means organizing actions, hitting the streets, and building the people’s movements. You ready?
For them to embrace to political left is for them to reject the corporate donations that keep them rich and powerful, and that won’t happen, so of course Biden would rather choose Harris and fight for conservative votes than skew remotely to the left.
Ilhan Omar’s coming back to the house. The Squad’s intact. They’re going to work seamlessly with President Biden.
So your handle is Green New Deal.  Biden supports the same policies.  But you won't vote for him?  Why on earth not?

They can criticize her all they want but unless they want four more years of #45 they had better vote Biden/Harris.
It makes no sense to say “push Biden left,” because the political left lies on a wholly different spectrum from neoliberalism. That’s why conservative politicians can support trump but liberal politicians won’t support Bernie; Trump didn’t question capitalism and Bernie did.

This will be the sickening future if Biden-Harris (Kamalatoe) win . . . . . .
A smart candidate doesn't care about the popular vote.  It's the electoral college that determines the winner, and that made Trump brilliant and Hillary...home.   Trumps base will walk through fire to vote this time +12M, and probably more after reasonable dems hear Biden debate.
They will count them on their garage and whatever tru.p gets, Biden gets a +1.
Set a timer to 60 seconds. Write down 3 - 5 strong policy proposals Joe Biden is currently running on that could turn someone's fears into hope.
'Antifa' website cited in conservative media attack on Biden is linked to — wait for it — Russia  via
Biden is Santa Claus and Kamala Harris is the Easter Bunny.
Kamala &amp; Biden's Endless Circle of Hypocrisy!  via    Won't hear this on cable news... Stuck with Biden.
Biden talks sanely and with a real purpose. Trump is completeky nuts and just talks to stroke his own fragile ego. This shouldn’t be that hard for you to understand.
If Biden wins, Pelosi is going to step down as speaker. Y’all ready for what twitter will be like for that fight?
Blew his little white privilege brains out seriously you're going to vote for this f****** bunch of s*** yay Biden and Company
If Dictator Trump keeps following Putin's lead, Biden better not jog alone, at night, on a bridge, in Washington DC..
Here is my question: Biden wins. What are you guys going to do? What’s the the plan to make sure we are never in this position again? Cause if I’m not hearing it, then I think it’s just an election talking point.
I think what the fishpainter is saying is that dem voters in South Carolina voted for Biden and changed the trajectory of the race. And yes democrats in southern states should have a voice in the party. Especially because many of those voters are Black and other POC.
so we should suffer another 4 years of Trump because a glorified conference doesn’t have the right agenda for you? And lefties would be justified in not voting for Biden because AOC got 60 seconds at a convention? Y’all are just looking for an excuse to be nihilists.
calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear #masks   #MaskupMN #NoMasks
Their plan? I don’t think calling in 40 years of insider favors was a good plan. If Pete and the klobs don’t clearly collude and endorse Biden a day before Super Tuesday Bernie wins easily
Trump calls out Biden and Harris's involvement with ANTIFA.
Have you heard about COVID-19? Seriously, what a lying idiot.  Barack and Biden economy sucked. After 2 years of #Trump you have to wonder what the hell they did for 8 years. FFS
Business attire under the Biden administration. Hard to identify the BLM anarchists this way.
This will be the theme song for Biden Harris 2020
Why? She's a freshman Congressperson who said the Democratic Party tent is too large if Biden is in it.
(Donald Trump) &amp; (Joe Biden) Supporters 😎😂😁😂😎
Meet the America under the leadership of the far left. Yep BLM will support the Biden-Harris ticket. If you own a business and a black person comes into your store you are to hand over the merchandise free of charge.
Now we know what they mean when they demand a “national strategy”: “one size fits all” control #tcnt #hardpass
I'm trying hard to be positive, but I'm very worried that Trump is going to win in November. Or that it's going to take A LOT of hard work on behalf of the Biden/Harris campaign to win votes. 😫
Again, this is why releasing Presidential toplines are important when you are trying to get people to take your internal seriously.  A lot easier to take this internal seriously when it is attached to a reasonable Biden/Trump number.
DNC has “Stop and Frisk” Bloomberg, “Mass Incarceration” Biden and Harris. There you have it!
Biden’s first job will be rebuilding the USPS. It’s a craven attack on such a necessary and valuable national service.
I’m not wearing face mask outside. Biden is nuts
bUt tRumP anD BIdEn aRE tHe sAmE
Internal, but a realistic Biden number.  #HD134 lurched hard from Romney 56.4-41.7 to Clinton 55.1-39.6.  Biden +18 there is totally consistent with Trump still carrying Texas.
Why would they go up? Biden has and is committed to banning private prisons. Remember, stock traders aren't that smart.
4/4 I said, “not voting is voting for Trump, Dad. Just vote w/your conscience. You don’t have to LIKE Biden/Harris and it’s ok if u vote on issues NOT candidates.” He said, “If that fucker messes w/SS he’s losing.”
Remember all Obama &amp; Biden could do was irritate Israel and funnel money to Iran!!!
This thread is true &amp; I already knew I’d be voting Biden/Harris on roughly this harm reduction platform. That said, I think it elides that for many of these issues the establishment DNC is &amp; will continue to be weak/contributory &amp; we cannot be complacent/lift our boot.
Not that arguing with a Karen will change your gullible little deranged mind.  But when Biden steps onto the debate stage with Trump it's GAME OVER.  Then your hate will really consume you.  Have fun screaming into your pillow on Nov 4th!
Joe Biden has a history of speaking up for the Republican Party:
What, exactly, was Biden's involvement in this?
One reason I'm supporting Biden-Harris
Absolutely not the truth. I can't believe that you took the nomination for vice president. Are you that desperate to think you can become president. Joe Biden is a total idiot. Why would you attach your horse to his cart
Biden should remind the orange buffoon that on January 20th he will no longer be above the law and virtually untouchable. And that He’ll be held accountable for any/all of his lawbreaking at that time.
Ducks are about to be delivered by someone in the Oval Office today over this #Biden/Harris Covid-19 briefing. Any mean, nasty, disrespectful tweets yet?
like when biden voted against federal recognition for same sex marriage and cut funding for schools that taught same sex marriage acceptance or when harris put trans women in men’s prisons and denied them access to gender confirmation surgery?Vote for Biden/Harris 2020! They don’t like Golden Showers!
Because she is so radical, that when Biden steps aside, she has the helm. She will institute all sorts of evil things. Biden will step aside because of his illness, and she will be president. This will be the saddest day ever! It’s what the left wants!
No sleepy Joe Biden
Lol what ties to Russia did Obama and Biden have?
31 here. Obama-Biden 2008 was my first ticket to vote for. And I'm so excited for Biden-Harris 2020.
You show them a picture of Trump and Kanye and then you ask them “Isn’t Kanye supposed to be taking votes away from Biden? Why is Kanye shaking hands with Trump then?” 🤔
Oh he is telling us only for the next three months until after the election and that Biden/Harris also won?? Otherwise, it will be for four more years at the least or whenever, until the democratic party win the Presidency? I hope they will never win the Presidency ever again!!!
Vote Stealing should be outlawed, Biden and Trump should be the only 2 people in the race
➿#QualifiedImmunity➿Replying to   Agreed!! I cannot wait for Biden and Harris to kick ass after the election! But we need changes...especially being held hostage by one man #MoscowMitchMcTreason I mean, we can't stop anything!! This is unacceptable! Grrr🌊😲😡🤬...
Idk wtf you’re talking about cause biden can still hardly string a full sentence together but ok go off

I really really really hope she and Biden are enough to toss Trump out on his ass...
Biden will be a fast death of America
I think 2 things can be true at once  Conservatives are wrong for assuming Kamala is in the position she is in because of her gender/skin color. She worked her way there.  Biden specifically said he was going to pick a woman of color.  Both are disgusting and racist
“The rapid expansion of executive and unchecked power has brought us to the brink of authoritarianism. And this would not be possible without the complicity of Republicans in Congress.” #VoteBidenHarris2020  What Republicans still don't understand...
Yeah I saw something along those lines too yesterday. Apparently it’s all an intricate plot to have Biden declared incapable, the Kamala would be ineligible to take over, leaving Nancy Pelosi as President.
I don't think I'll ever forget the phrase "The Biden/Hitler Combo" as long as I live
Hillary is not a good gauge for D turnout as she was as exciting as a lamp in 2016 -- yet still barely carried MN. It will be a 3-5% Biden W.
Absolutely thrilled! She is intelligent, articulate, ferocious, and FOR THE PEOPLE. I have been grinning all day - had no idea how much this decision would affect my psyche. This has energized me and the Biden campaign! #BidenHarris2020
And there's some big political news out today. If you somehow haven't heard yet, here's our story on Joe Biden's VP pick
So the woman who called Biden a racist is now his vp candidate. Makes sense
Got it. Joe Biden is sent by God. Interesting narrative to push, Bill.
I love the Harris pick. It reminds me of how I felt when Christian Ponder successfully threw one away. Seemed like Biden had the chance to mess this up and didn't!
The Biden campaign has already committed to 3 debates. Where have you been?
Here's what Sen. Amy Klobuchar had to say about Joe Biden picking Kamala Harris as his vice presidential running mate.
Does Kamala Harris still believe Joe Biden is a racist?
I wanted Bernie/Warren but Biden/Harris is pretty awesome too! 🥳 #BidenHarris2020
Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate, making history by selecting the first Black woman to compete on a major party's presidential ticket.
Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has announced California Sen. Kamala Harris as his vice presidential running mate for the 2020 election.
Democrats, especially the administration that Biden was a part of, gave Trump most of that economy.  Without Obama’s turnaround from the recession for him to build off of, Trump’s economy wouldn’t have been anything special.
I remember when kamala Harris called Biden a racist during the debates. Seems she has changed her tune. Both sides do this
Nobody is saying Biden is a genius. Don’t resort to straw man arguments.   You can (and smart people do) think that Biden is a terrible candidate while still understanding that he’s 100x better than 4 more years of Trump would be.
who is doing your ads ? No offense but they suck. Why not contrast your executive order with Obama/biden or show Nancy's support of the payroll tax break.
I've had this idea in my head for my talk radio station of doing a Joe Biden sound board, where at the click of a button, the producer should air a Joe Biden gaffe on command. But there's so many and I'm so far behind 😂
Biden could do a good thing for himself and nominate Condoleeza Rice as his running mate.
And they're questioning Biden's competence?
Lol thats funny u say trump is racist but yet your voting for Joe biden who said "if you vote for trump then your not black" makes total sense.
Ignorance says what?

I think it also fair to expect it puts pressure on Biden to agree that the money is forgiven.  I don't think much about the economics of this, and I question the constitutionality, but on the politics it's clever.
Nobody is telling you to vote Biden. If trump record of distraction, lies, and inability to take proper actions haven't convinced you. Nothing we say will. So go ahead vote as you wish. You are beyound hope.

Years ago, I watched my dad die..it was the worst feeling of sadness &amp; helplessness...it’s much like the feelings I have now watching our democracy being dismantled &amp; desecrated. While there was no cure for my dad, I firmly believe the cure for our country is to elect Joe Biden.

Followed all I wasn't already. Nice to meet you all. I do block people who are saying they won't vote Biden/Harris for any reason. ABirkshire, for example. Was warned last night, checked, pinned tweet saying so. This is too important to not support this ticket. We must unite.
BIDEN/HARRIS are not going to take your red meat or your stupid extensions of your peni a gun
Joe Biden isn’t the main player because Joe doesn’t have the strength it takes to be this nation’s leader, stupid,  will be ultimately voting for is Kamela, an unknow candidate that the puppeteers will control, the woman who stupid want to shove in the good American’s troughs.

She isn’t even black!!  As the Left gushes over Joe Biden’s “black” woman VP pick, an unfortunate fact is surfacing about her ancestry. She doesn’t even have a SINGLE DROP of African-American blood!! Her dad is…
Poor Democratic leadership on display!  A vote for Biden is a vote to give up your freedoms! Vote Red! 💪🇺🇸
Nope!  No questions or solutions!  If you vote for Biden you are not an American!

If Biden wins, get ready for Trump to punish America
Joe Biden is a stanch Catholic. Educate yourself.
Suburban Mom and former GOP here. 🙋🏻‍♀️ Not scared. Find you deplorable. Will not be voting for you and can't wait to usher in Biden/Harris 2020. Enough of the tomfoolery and racism. You're out, old man. #LincolnVoter
BIDEN does not get on TV and say ignorant stupid things. You do this everyday
Indeed, Sad part about people saying vote for Biden is that they’re forced to say it because he’s the only other candidate to vote for lol we’re fucked either way. 😞
Politics are poisonous.   They will have you arguing with your friends and family over 2 candidates that don’t give 2 fucks about us. Ain’t that crazy? Poc are arguing over Trump and Biden... 🤦🏽‍♂️ so this where we at huh
Predictable. A certainty actually. The nastiest man on the planet, or at least in this country, attacks a woman in this way. It lays bare his character. It will have, I think, a boomerang effect. Because try as he will, he can't sully her character at all.
Thinking he hasn't got much support from any color. He may not win his household even. And I don't care, I don't think his name is even going to be on the ballot in most states. So, I'm not reading anything more about him. He's not the news for me. Biden/Harris is.
I am done responding. I'm sick of you trying to say "you think/do this horrible thing" when I clearly don't. I never said the fight ends when Biden is elected
no one in this convo is saying you should be grateful for the LGBTQ+ situation in the US right now. It's still bad. We're saying that it's better than it was 40 years ago and could get WORSE under Trump, while it won't under Biden
I simply think getting Trump out should be top priority. Then young people can start to put pressure on Biden and the Dem establishment
idk where in this argument you got the idea that this is "fun" for me? I'm sorry about the situation you're in. I understand that I have very little skin in the game (i'm a white guy). I just see what Trump is doing and know that four years of Biden would be not as bad
And if Hillary had won in 2016 Biden probably wouldn't have felt the need to run this year. Good job!
i'd call "we need to elect Biden because Trump is worse" pragmatism
and mfers like you are the reason Trump won in 2016, no offense. Look at how all of you people abstaining did in the next election cycle. No more progressive but at least we have Biden!
In no way do I enjoy the fact that Biden is the nominee. I simply understand that 4 more years of Trump would be much worse than that of Biden
"Hey guys maybe we should finally let black people vote" is to the left of "Hey we need to break down systemic racism" I guess? And that's not Biden i'm quoting but the main line of the Democratic party, whether or not it's older members actually mean what they say
I’m attending Joe Biden for President’s event, “Join Seniors for Biden” – sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
my point is that you're ignoring the actual difference in their political stances. Biden may very well be a rapist. It sucks that the Democrats forced him on us. But to say Biden as a presidential candidate and Trump as a presidential candidate are the same thing IS ridiculous
You're reaching Trump supporter levels of simplification here. I very much dislike Biden. I wish Bernie (or even Warren) was the nominee but to ignore all the differences between Biden and Trump's platform and just say they're both equal "racist rapists" is ridiculous
Kamala is the law and order candidate for the party of #dismantlethepolice. Clarity. Vision. Sound judgement. Textbook #biden
Bernie is helping Biden with his plan! He's going to hold a significant cabinet position. Treasury maybe?
I think I had forgotten what hope had felt like until it was restored today. Biden/Harris... let’s go!
Both Biden &amp; Harris are moderates and you don't have anything that even comes close to labelling them as radical left.  They are so moderate that many conservatives that are sick of trump will feel at ease that a vote for Joe is a vote for moving America forward out of the gutter
To be clear, Biden is far better than Trump (or Sanders) on trade
Why Biden's trade policy is terrible
Yea agreed. Was jus checking .  Idk how you could put biden under trump. And Biden is a dipshit, but standing next to trump he look like a genius
is voting for joe Biden strictly for kampala Harris

There's lots of things I want too,  but at this point it isn't about what you want anymore. You have two options Trump or Biden, if you don't support biden then you're supporting trump and if you don't get that then you deserved to be scolded by people
Biden studders, he has had a studdering issue since he was a kid. I bet he knows when World War 2 ended though, unlike Trump who said yesterday that the Spanish Flu of 1918 ended the Second World War
So if Biden wins, you will be to vote for: Women for CIA Director  Women for Education Secretary  Black man for HUD  Gay person for ambassador to Germany   You and Tina Smith voted against in past.  Wow, who are you for?  Oh ya open borders.

Very excited that Biden chose Kamala Harris as his running mate.  Shes smart and tough.
And that was the final Nail in Biden’s chances 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I hope it’s  but if it’s not I will still crawl through glass to vote for the Biden ticket!
Why did Whitmer interview with Biden
Could we try not to put the cart before the horse? Trump made a similar statement prior to the election in 2016. This is a given, I'm not sure stating the obvious out loud is going to persuade people to vote Biden, in fact, it may cause some to not.
That sounds like a Trump campaign ad. "This is the America Joe Biden wants!"
Kamala But I'm down with Bass as well. It's his choice and I'm going with Biden's choice.
Thank you sir. President Biden.

Don’t care about the VP. voting Biden no matter what❤️

What the hell has Trump done to help America? Millions are out of work, the economy is in the toilet. His response to the virus is beyond laughable! He's a colossal failure! Biden and Obama saved this country after another Republican crashed the economy!
It’s political. The more things they can shut down the better for Biden. Next will be Halloween!
I wouldn't consider any public plan that has so much cost sharing built in it's unaffordable 'lucky'. That's Biden's tokenism, nothing more. #NeverBiden #M4A 🌻
Face it, people, the guy is crooked and knows how to get money out of people. You don’t really think all those campaign donations are going to bumper stickers and lawn signs do you?
I'm much more concerned about the money men, the people like Sheldon Adelson who are the source of all that dark money pouring into Kentucky to keep Mitch and others like him than the noisy, but dumb Fox - saw a clip yesterday where they thought Biden really said he'd chosen a VP
Biden couldn’t even come up with the words to say that. Oh, well he could with 2 hrs of prompting. He’s just a puppet on a string.

I guess it’s about the Biden’s (and others’m) involvement with Barisma.  Sounds like our money was stolen then laundered initially through Barisma and back to America possibly sitting within one or more construction companies.  Criminal charges means there’ll be a jury.
Biden won't be corrupt and give them money!
I don't think that trip to Ohio is going to give him the boost he expected given the unhinged rant he unleashed against Joe Biden's faith and his ludicrous misunderstanding of how the constitution is amended. This man HAS no God but money.
I agree. I never go after unless they say terrible things about BIDEN. BIDEN is a devout Catholic. I am too. trump isn’t even Christian
It’s not Biden it is trump and the trumpthugs
I would but trumpthugs just said BIDEN will hurt God. Fake evangelists say trump is god. They started it
I cannot wait to see how many people show up for BIDEN than trump
All of these women are more than qualified! Biden never said that he would necessarily choose a woman of color. His VP candidates are a milliom times better than what is in the WH at this time.

A couple of things.  I’ll admit, the original statement from Shithead never warranted a response, but Biden could have been directly asked.  In fact, the original statement only pandered to Shithead’s base; it won’t change the mind of undecided voters.

That's okay. Biden will fix it all next year! He has a lot of crap to clean up in January. This is just a cover for big corps to pay less taxes disguised as a "perk" for wage earners.
If everyone has the expectation that Biden is going to die in office, I want some with actual running a Government experience. The state gave the same departments as the federal government with the exception of defense.you are f-n sorry as puppet for Biden - go suck your own ass

I just hope that if Biden wins, we can put him in an orange jumpsuit!
There's absolutely no room for doubt. Every problem we have with Biden and his administration can be handled because they respect the process, the same can't be said for Trump.
A real Patriot sees what Trump has done and is doing to destroy our democracy. So “not crazy about Biden” makes voting for Biden a no brainer.
In an ideal world, I agree, but I have doubts that a Biden administration would eliminate the department.
What is the issue?  Do you want to go another 4 years of this.  Biden is 1000 times better on any given day than the orange maggot!
Because Biden is not in control of anything he says. This is the far left telling him what to say.  Unbelievable

Our only hope for progress at this point is electing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. If you can't see that it's the only way forward, then you are lost. We can't have progress if there is no nation to move forward.

I'm just making the observation that there's a whole lot of Democrats that want to reach out to the right before they reach out to the left. Thankfully Biden isn't one of them, based on his actions so far.
I don't blame Biden for this. But it's clear where the priorities for the DNC are when John fucking Kasich gets to speak and AOC gets one minute.
Why can't people let us move on at our own pace? Like I'm good, I'm voting for Biden, but I don't want to pretend like I'm happy.

I think the thing that hurts the most for me is that as millions of Americans don't have reliable work, don't have enough income, are at risk of losing their housing, and have no savings, Biden went with the Wall Street VP pick.  I think more than anything that stings.
The problem in this case is that Kamala is suppposed to be the appeasement to the left wing because Biden is already far enough to the right.
Kamala is the law and order candidate for the party of #dismantlethepolice. Clarity. Vision. Sound judgement. Textbook #biden
I think I had forgotten what hope had felt like until it was restored today. Biden/Harris... let’s go!
Let’s just get Biden in office so we can primary every centrist up for re-election in 2022.
Both Biden &amp; Harris are moderates and you don't have anything that even comes close to labelling them as radical left.  They are so moderate that many conservatives that are sick of trump will feel at ease that a vote for Joe is a vote for moving America forward out of the gutter
Just like we were last election right?  😂😂😂😂😂 Biden already had no chance and this made his chances even worse 😂😂😂 Dems don’t even want to vote for him 😂😂😂
So if Biden wins, you will be to vote for: Women for CIA Director  Women for Education Secretary  Black man for HUD  Gay person for ambassador to Germany   You and Tina Smith voted against in past.  Wow, who are you for?  Oh ya open borders.
As someone who lives here and speaks with people from all walks of life and parts of the state:  Biden's winning Minnesota. It might not be close.
I think Joe Biden is a decent man. I don't think he was the best choice, but he is the choice and he will benefit from this.  But make no mistake, if he gets into office and starts forgiving people, I am the first person who will line up to offer opposition.
I want to be really transparent: Biden being the President is immaterial to me. It is the most likely outcome of the goal. I want to see the Republican Party incapacitated. I want them gone from the political lexicon of modern America.  That's my goal.
I'm so happy VP Biden chose you. You are going to be a great team! Now the party is cooking!!!
Trump saying that the Spanish flu probably ended WWII was either a cognitive slip (dementia) or willful ignorance. He said it within the last day or so. That you think Trump's statement has no equivalency with cracks about Biden having dementia is laughable.
Bigger Harris/Biden numbers coming in November!
Warren is too! Nearly outraised Obama for Biden!
And we will move heaven and earth to get them elected!
Very excited that Biden chose Kamala Harris as his running mate.  Shes smart and tough.
And that was the final Nail in Biden’s chances 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I hope it’s  but if it’s not I will still crawl through glass to vote for the Biden ticket!
Why did Whitmer interview with Biden
I don't know that Duckworth brings Biden anything he doesn't have. I should say that I'm not saying choosing someone other than my preference is a deal breaker by any stretch, but I don't see what she adds to his strengths or how she fortifies his weaknesses.
Could we try not to put the cart before the horse? Trump made a similar statement prior to the election in 2016. This is a given, I'm not sure stating the obvious out loud is going to persuade people to vote Biden, in fact, it may cause some to not.
Lmao I think  was right. If they cancel SEC football, write GA in for Biden.
Kamala But I'm down with Bass as well. It's his choice and I'm going with Biden's choice.
Thank you sir. President Biden.
Mooch, you need to see someone about your ”sour grapes” jealousy and anger. Either you were never a Republican or you are as crazy as the rest of the #NeverTrumpers. No true Republican would support Biden he has become a toxic radical. Win Trump win!
It’s political. The more things they can shut down the better for Biden. Next will be Halloween!
I wouldn't consider any public plan that has so much cost sharing built in it's unaffordable 'lucky'. That's Biden's tokenism, nothing more. #NeverBiden #M4A 🌻
I wrote about the way forward if Biden wins. There is only one way.
I'm much more concerned about the money men, the people like Sheldon Adelson who are the source of all that dark money pouring into Kentucky to keep Mitch and others like him than the noisy, but dumb Fox - saw a clip yesterday where they thought Biden really said he'd chosen a VP
Trump should implement the draft and watch Antifa and Biden voters leave the country for Canada
I will vote for Biden but if you refuse to vote, Trump will become another 4yrs president.  Please share
I will vote for Biden but if you refuse to vote, Trump will become another 4yrs president.  Please share
Thats just either defunding Social Security or giving you a big bill that you'll have to pay once Trump loses and the Republicans will blame Biden because nothing matters anymore.
Trump should implement a draft and watch Antifa and Biden voters leave for Canada.  Gone in 60 seconds
Trump should implement a draft and watch Antifa and Biden voters leave for Canada.
Dear fake christians. What is so Christian,noble oh and non racist about Joe f'ing Biden? #thirdparty
I guess it’s about the Biden’s (and others’m) involvement with Barisma.  Sounds like our money was stolen then laundered initially through Barisma and back to America possibly sitting within one or more construction companies.  Criminal charges means there’ll be a jury.
I don't think that trip to Ohio is going to give him the boost he expected given the unhinged rant he unleashed against Joe Biden's faith and his ludicrous misunderstanding of how the constitution is amended. This man HAS no God but money.
Trump should implement a draft and watch Antifa and Biden voters run to Canada.  😂😂
I believe  about his faith which is why I find it so odd that #prochoice folx are ready to accept his flip-flop on abortion.
Trump should start a draft and watch Antifa and Biden voters run to Canada
Putin still has 90 days believe nothing the media says about Biden's lead. Vote as if your life depends on it REGARDLESS  Because this foremost needs to be a win Needs to be blow out in epic fashion Vote BLUE UP AND DOWN EVERY TICKET Give America the second chance we all deserve
He has to pick the one he thinks he can work the best with. He and Obama were a great working team. Biden deserves the same.
He's telling us so we know how desperate Trump is to win including helping West take away votes from Biden. #CrookedTrump
We deserve better than Trump &amp; Biden! #UNITY2020 is on a mission to draft a President &amp; VP to unite the country. This is neither a spoiler campaign nor a 3rd party ticket. Learn more and get on the email list here:  Let's take back our republic!
If everyone has the expectation that Biden is going to die in office, I want some with actual running a Government experience. The state gave the same departments as the federal government with the exception of defense.Want to know what’s actually happening in the suburbs? HOMEMADE Biden/Harris signs! This one went up today a few doors down from  and me in Apple Valley, MN #BidenHarris2020 #Suburbanhousewife
Also, and I think this is important to note, there have only been four Boomer presidents -- Bill Clinton (born 1946), George W. Bush (1946), Barack Obama (1961), and Donald Trump (1946). Joe Biden is part of the Silent Generation.
Why, it's almost as if Biden's plan is really popular.
Most of the establishment democrats are in bed with pharmaceutical companies, including Joe Biden because he has been saying his whole political career he wants to cut Medicare and Medicaid and social security.
Love their claim that Biden can’t speak off script...do they just tune out all the things Trump has said off script?  Injecting bleach?  Attacks on every person who’s ever said a negative word about him?  Pandemic of NINETEEN SEVENTEEN?  Airport attacks during the revolution?
Nobody cares what you believe you liar. Dems sure are worried about trump “not leaving after he loses”. Bet you anything the election will be contested due to mail in fraud, then they’ll just say enough is enough and try to put Biden in. Obviously they are planning on losing.
How many times does the Coons family need to tell you this before you fucking get it?
It's tough listening to the BBC and still hearing 20 minutes about Trump. I so hope Biden will win.  Our nation will still be screwed for a while, but at least that eliminates one problem I won't have to hear about.
Why isn’t anyone talking about Tara Reade?! The woman that Biden allegedly sexually assaulted. You people confuse me some times.
It is going to be brutal listening to Biden-Harris until Nov 3rd.  If they are talking they are lying. I can't imagine having to listen to 4 years of it that will be as bad as the 8 years of BHO's lying. I am sick of it already. They are not going to do anything they say.
Joe Biden mispronounce her name right after to save trump, Joe Biden to the rescue 😂
#Election2020    Trump says of Biden/Harris: “They don't want to have cows, they don't want to have any form of animals."  Major disagrees....
If Joe Biden is allowed to bring up the past then Trump should bring up that Joe Biden has been saying he wants to defund social security, Medicare and medicaid his entire political career.
I’m so glad that u didn’t lose your power over Covid! Your fighting for the people! I’m so tired of Republicans trying to push u out! Thank god democrats blocked there vote! Thank you for all u do! And all u stand for! Minnesota’s a blue State! Vote blue!Joe Biden! Kamala Harris
Come on  Biden is spreading false information.   Enforce your own rules!
This is a complete lie and easy to verify.  Biden thinks dem voters are idiots and easily influenced.  In most cases, he’s right.   They are...
Omg. Listening to Biden. Tears. Hope. Please help fire tRump. #trumpyourfired #FireTrumpInNovember #BidenHarris2020
Someone needs to remind Joe Biden...about 10 times a day!
You do realize that Biden has ties with Epstein also, right?
yes and a Republican would never get elected again! Now Biden can pick the rest of his cabinet mayor of Seattle Chicago New York...
This was true of Joe Biden in 2008, and we never heard from him ever again.
I sure hope so too. I’ve met a couple of black dudes who are normally Democrat but voting for Jo in the elections. Honestly though black people my age or so don’t even like Biden. They realize that he is not here to help us at all.
But correct. Biden is still going to get the majority vote of 90%+ but may be a point or two lower because of Harris. Where that vote is going? I have no idea.
Black people are most definitely voting for Biden in overwhelmingly high numbers. But, I don’t think it’s going to be a few percentage points lower than usual just because of Harris.
Build Back Better. Biden 😅🤣😂
Not according to Biden.
You do realize that you're running against *Biden*, right?
"Did Joe Biden announce his pick too quickly? Twitter discusses."
Biden doesn’t teach abortion is good. He just thinks women should make the decision  How do you feel about a Bishop that knows of child sex abuse in the church but refuses to do anything about it because it’s not his department.
Honestly, both Biden and Harris are well positioned to "Nixon Goes to China" this. Will they? We'll see.
Looking like Sen. Kamala Harris might be Biden’s VP pick. I’ll let you know when it’s confirmed.
I was actually hoping for Susan Rice for vice president, but Harris is probably the right choice for Biden.
Joe Biden is humble in the best way. He doesn't think he knows best. He doesn't hate you if you tell him he's wrong. He is willing to listen and learn. He is the opposite of Donald Trump.
I voted for you. Thanks for all the ways you continue to fight the good fight. All in now for Biden/Harris.
The president just gave us notice we’re going to have to learn Chinese if Biden wins. It’s never too early to start learning!  加油拜登的！
Biden is going to get way more votes, including way more mail-in votes, and then Trump is going to claim that makes the results rigged and illegitimate. Can we all acknowledge this now so no one claims to be surprised later? 1/2
Tulsi Gabbert wipes her ass with Kamala Harris. Harris is a true leftist suck up and is poster child for drama and for nearly destroying a justice's life with spite. She is just as dangerous as Biden, And will destroy this country, Mark my words. Tulsi has more class any day.
Kamala as Biden’s VP won’t stop the fact that you have to, for as long as you live, live with the fact that you knowingly and willingly voted for a Racist Rapist.
What an awful, awful choice by Biden. In a time where criminal justice reform is so important to our country..he picks one of the few people with a worse record on it then himself...Please, someone get me  to end this #kamalaharris garbage ASAP.
One thing about the Harris pick is that Biden, like any competent politician, knows that a sharp attack in a debate is part of the game, and that you don't take it personally, *especially* when you're on the same team.
Gonna be hilarious when Biden posts [insert joke name here]. People will laugh and laugh. [NOTE: DO NOT POST THIS JOKE TEMPLATE WITHOUT REVISION.]
You misspelled Biden
Pence locked down conservatives.  Cheney &amp; Biden locked down experience.  Duckworth...national security?
Biden is the one I have heard say those dreadful words.
#BlackLivesMatter #antifa Joe Biden has been in office over 40 years. He was Vice President for eight years. Why didn’t he get rid of the “systemic racism” then, and why would he now? You are voting for Obama again but worse basically.
I though 2020 was racist. Now that you picked Biden’s VP for him as a woman, back to 2016 me too gender wars!? 😂 didn’t see this coming!
Yea but these riots started under Obama same with the kids being in cages. Syria's civil war was also started under Obama's watch as well. Not to mention Joe Biden wants to defund social security, Medicare and medicaid the proof is in his entire political career. Look it up.
Biden-Buttigieg, the ticket everyone expected.
24. #TrumpPressConference  Says China will own this country if Biden wins.
Pocket change for the corrupt Biden's!
He’s more delusional then Joe Biden.
This letter doesn’t advocate for a particular Black woman. We are not interchangeable! Do I want to see Black women lead? YES! Do I want Black women in positions of power? YES! But this further tokenizes the Black women Biden IS considering.Its not the solidarity they think it is
I've long believed that Biden voters are more likely to vote. Nothing has changed my mind.
Donate to Biden campaign
Yup. Democrats are using social media and every other platform to censor and steer the election. That and including China and Iran with election interference helps them even more. Don’t forget Russia, they wanted Hillary and want Biden...
A vote for Biden is really a vote for Michelle.  They know that too.
Waiting for Biden to announce his VP pick like...
Joe Biden has been saying he wants to defund social security, Medicare and Medicaid and disability his entire political career. So whats your point? How will things get any better with Joe Biden when he is just part of the problem? If you don't believe me do some research.
Lmao did you know that Joe Biden also wants to defund Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Yet you sheep still believe he will change our country for the better. Face it the two party system isn't working. Also the proof is in Joe Biden's entire political career.
Hopefully trump wins because if Joe Biden wins we will lose social security and Medicare and Medicaid because he wants to defund all 3 of them to pay for his illegal immigrants and their votes. The cartel problem will only get worse with a Democrat in office.
Joe Biden is more corrupted than Trump will ever be. He also wants to defund social security and Medicare and Medicaid. He has been saying that for most of his political career.
Biden won't be their candidate come election time anyway.
You must have mistaken Trump for Biden.  Where’s Hunter?
You know it. And expect them to refuse to cooperate in any way with a Biden administration.
That is just a little pocket change for the corrupt Biden family.
I can never understand what Biden is even trying to say, and the rate times I do it’s something stupid or racist 😂. If Biden talks he will lose basically, GW2.0
At that point, they move on to.... 🌹: Oh, well if Biden isn't going to give free college to everyone making any amount of money then HE MAY AS WELL NOT EVEN DO IT.
Here you go.
They can't. And if they can, Joe Biden can fund Medicare out of Defense, so good luck.
#IntelligenceReports So Russia is working against Biden. China is working against Trump. Guess which one Trump will do something about.
What about the guy who predicted all but one correct, including correct about trump beating Clinton and Biden now?
Biden will be lucky to win ANY state
IKR .. Takes a lot of emotional intelligence to come up with that kind of response.  Such a great communicator, he could write for Biden.
#Election2020 Is Trump saying that Biden wants to put God on the disabled list?
Wait, are you saying that Biden is not *soooo late with his VP pick* because he *just can't decide*, but that this is actually right around the time it usually happens?
I'm telling you, I have to vote for Biden, I'm not getting on the wrong side of a guy who can hurt God.
They were not drugs they retested the substance and it wasn’t drugs but they are still trying to say she resisted arrest. Crooked Sheriffs Department! They need a FBI patterns and practices investigation after Biden wins this November!
One of the reason this falls apart is that Trump -- who is an atheist, let's not pretend -- has no understanding of the language of faith. No Evangelical believes that Biden can hurt God, for God's sake.
Anyhow, no, it's not good you've had to move, but if you want The Nib to not completely implode, maybe don't run cartoons that would be considered hackishly anti-Biden by Ben Garrison.
You could debate John Biden a million times, I won't vote for you.
#Election2020 The Yo Semite and Thighland guy thinks that Joe Biden is the one who can't keep it together.The most frustrating part is that they agree that Biden is trash and still think that he deserves their vote. My hardest lefty friend even agrees with me that Obama sucked. Yet somehow still thinks Trump is worse.
Yep, they did it deceptively to make it sound worse than it was because trust me, they won't report the Q3 numbers the same way; although they will report the Q4 numbers to make them look ridiculously good if Biden wins.
Just as it takes one hip hop star - suffering from mental illness - to sabotage the Black vote for Biden. Smh 🤦🏾‍♀️ 🤯
But she should really be addressed as Senator Harris, with respect. Until she’s Madame President, that is (I don’t see Biden finishing the term).
So if everything needs changing why hasnt career politician Joe Biden done anything??   Why is it Trumps fault career politicians haven’t been successful?  Maybe because they have other agendas?  Hmmmm.
Nah, he'll just use the Obama strategy and only hold pressers every 3 months.  But he handles the hostile media pretty well, and when he has a stroke it will be long after his second term.  Biden may have already had one.
Maybe Trump should adopt the Biden model:  only call on friendly press with pre-approved questions.  No, Trump is smart enough and courageous enough to take this shit from a hostile media on a daily basis.
I'd like to hear Biden answer ANY tough question.
Does your daughter need a lock?  Sounds like she already has one on Biden-Harris 2020!
convince me to vote for Biden/Harris without mentioning Trump.
Politicians campaign where they have a chance of winning.  To do otherwise would be a waste of time and resources.  Do you think Biden will campaign in Alabama or Mississippi?  It's not a matter of caring.  It's a matter of getting to 270 electoral votes.
First, it's Aryan Nation.  Second, it's the democrats who founded the KKK and fought for segregation (Biden supported Ayran  views).  Third, the left has been screaming RACIST! at conservatives for decades as a political tactic.  Read Saul Alinsky's Rules for Radicals.
Joe Biden touches young children, has a new racist comment almost weekly, has failed in office for 45 years and rarely can complete a full sentence. I'll pass on his advice
#OhGoodShotMaam!  Just remember, #Biden and #Harris will kill them for the good of the world, rather than make peace from selfish, political motives like  #OrangeManBad!!!  #SnarkIsAnUnderappreciatedArtForm
Yeah but Biden can't survive 4 years of Biden.
The Trump administration got rid of a bloated team of bureaucrats, but once we knew that China and the WHO had been lying to us, in a week he put together a stronger team of medical professionals and dealt with the pandemic better than Hillary ever could.  Biden would be lost.
Nice try using the democrat talking points (aka Excuses).  Listen to Biden talk from 10 years ago and it is obvious he has lost it.  Even democrat leadership knows it. You can keep up the illusion, but only until the first debate.  Then it's GAME OVER.
All the Biden followers running to get a mask
If ur in support of #BLM and #ACAB and ur going to vote 4 Biden/Harris, ur a hypocrite.  If you are not going to be part of the #generalstrike due 2 the govt not completing the stimulus package and supported Sanders, ur also a hypocrite.
BIDEN/HARRIS, A CLASS ACT!!  AMERICA HAS A CHANCE TO RECLAIM ALL THAT IT HAS LOST.  trump/dense NOTHING BUT THE MOST PATHETIC PITIFUL INEPT INCOMPETENT DISGUSTING DEPLORABLE DECEITFUL DESPICABLE REPUGNANT REPULSIVE VAIN CONCEITED ARROGANT EGOTISTICAL  CLASSLESS ACT EVER!!!
Any chance Open Skies survives or resumes under a Biden presidency?
I just oppose Biden
A smart candidate doesn't care about the popular vote.  It's the electoral college that determines the winner, and that made Trump brilliant and Hillary...home.   Trumps base will walk through fire to vote this time +12M, and probably more after reasonable dems hear Biden debate.
Not that arguing with a Karen will change your gullible little deranged mind.  But when Biden steps onto the debate stage with Trump it's GAME OVER.  Then your hate will really consume you.  Have fun screaming into your pillow on Nov 4th!
Do you have ANY evidence for a corruption charge? Nope, just a bunch of CNN propaganda.  Biden, however, has documented incidents of enriching his family through corrupt deals.  And you want HIM negotiating with China?  China owns the Bidens!
Biden can't remember his name without a teleprompter.  People will feel sorry for the poor old guy when Trump shreds him in the debates.  CNN will accuse Trump of Elder Abuse! But it will still be GAME OVER for Biden.
Honest question are u voting for Biden after what he said last week regarding African Americans and the history of his running mate?
Join me in supporting Joe Biden via
I popped this list in a thread yesterday as potential targets for blame should Biden lose:
Bernie fell back in line fast enough that I don't think he'll be the target of Team D's ire should Biden lose.
You think Kristol has beclowned himself to the max, and he proves you wrong.  Did Joe McCarthy run for President against Truman? Did Robert Welch run against Ike? No.  But Bill will ride the Good Ship Biden into the water, confident his "conservative" donors will rescue him.
.It redirected to the Biden campaign, until about 12-24 hours ago. Now it redirects to "site unavailable."
I just donated $200 to Biden Harris in order to match the amount my son sent in today
I hope somebody or somebodies crash the crap out of it.  Well...  that is unless Team D crashes it without any help.  Which if Biden's streams are any indicator is highly likely.
Shouldn’t that be Biden?
that’s the argument that my sister-in-law used when talking to my wife tonight. Voting for trump because “Biden couldn’t do any better”. trump will get the majority of votes from this devout evangelical &amp; her circle of friends. Can’t have fact based conversation. Tone deaf.
BIDEN IS EVERYTHING trump ISN'T.
Translation: White Woman will be submissive to their White Husbands in knowing, I'll keep Blacks &amp; Mexicans away from their neighborhoods. Also don't vote Biden because he'll allow a Black Man to allow fair opportunities to all races.   Trump's racism is so blatant &amp; disgusting!!
I didn’t know  was campaigning for Biden now.
Is Biden rocking a mullet?
But smear ads that center around Biden’s failing mental state aren’t nasty...makes sense to me.
i am closer to biden ideologically than jorgensen so no thanks
I listened to your podcast,which was  thing I believe is that we need to o encourage the Biden voters to vote early, whether by mail or in person.Then their votes will be counted earlier too.
Veteran Republican strategist  disagreed.  "I think that messaging will work," he said. "Middle America -- the moderates and the indepdendents -- are certainly not looking for an adminstration that's going to be beholden to the far left."
I can understand not wanting to vote for Biden/Harris if you dislike their records. But acting without a focus on the results may still result in harm, and your intentions will provide little solace to those harmed. Effects matter more than intention, IMO.
trump KNOWS HE IS GOING TO LOSE THE 2020 ELECTION AND WILL DO WHATEVER TO NOT HAVE TO GIVE UP THE POWER N ATTENTION HE HAS.      KANYE WEST IS NOTHING BUT A INEXPERIENCED UNQUALIFIED NO CHANCE OF WINNING  trump TOY USED TO HOPEFULLY  DRAW VOTES AWAY FROM THE BIDEN/HARRIS TICKET.
AMERICA, IN A COVID19  CRISIS WHO WOULD YOU RATHER LOOK TOO FOR LEADERSHIP? BIDEN/HARRIS--PEOPLE YOU CAN TRUST IN WHAT THEY SAY trump/dense-- 2 GD MFin LYING SACKS OF ORANGE SHIT YOU COULDN'T TRUST FOR SHIT YOUR ANSWER WILL TELL A GREAT DEAL  ABOUT AMERICA AND IT'S FUTURE.
.I am. I think she'll be a bad candidate for #Biden and the #Democrats. I know he had to pick a black woman, but I didn't expect her. She's a loser.
WITH BIDEN/HARRIS AMERICAN WILL  FINALLY CORRECT/RIGHT IT'S ROYAL 4 YR F#CK UP KNOWN AS THE trump/dense RESIDENCY.
RIGHT ON HOLLY, TELL IT LIKE IT IS. trumps A COMPLETE ORANGE MORON AND ALL AMERICA SHOULD VOTE FOR BIDEN/HARRIS
Libertarians, OTOH are for criminal justice reform, so you bet your ass I am in a position to call Biden-Harris out for this, as well as Trump-Pence.
Joe Biden's platform is the most progressive platform of a nominee in decades.  So mission accomplished? Let's restore humanity by voting Biden/Harris.  (And protect literal human lives from Trump's harm)
Fair point. So look at the platform being put forth by the Biden Harris campaign. Look at the anti-lunching law Harris put forth. Look  her policies on abolishing mandatory minimums and legalizing marijuana.
Or maybe they figure no one can possibly hide it any longer. It isn't as if Biden's breakdown is obscure.
Lies and fear-mongering. That’s all you got. Biden and Harris will restore hope, dignity, honesty, and democracy. Trump will continue to tear this country apart while he steals from us and lets us die while he plays golf.
I keep seeing repostings of Obama’s endorsement and congratulatory statement to Biden and Harris like thats supposed to mean something 🙃🥴 or we’re supposed to be relieved. He was symbolic (which is fine) in the same way Kamala being VP is (also fine). Both moderate af lol.
She is certainly qualified at 55.  Can she garner the votes Biden needs for the win?
No it’s an old picture. Biden was in Delaware all day and Harris was in California all day. They’re going to be together in Dover Delaware tomorrow.
It feels so good having Biden/Harris as a team. They will bring ethics back to government. They will bring back empathy. They will bring back fairness. And so much more.
At least Biden will try and hide the bad things his team does and not kill the gays. Harris will just try to lock up the trans folks though.
Biden/Harris will win. #BidenHarris
How should I respond to a R who asks about Kamala’s response to the sexual harassment allegations against Biden?
I will crawl over broken glass to vote Biden/Harris and dem up and down the ticket. Still, Senator Warren, I just want to say you brought humanity, intelligence, wit and more to this campaign, and I just can’t thank you enough for all you do and all you are.
“Nasty to Kavanaugh”...is Trump campaigning for Biden/Harris now cause this sounds like a great endorsement?
Harris was my favorite, but all the women up for VP were good. Please people vote for the Biden/Harris ticket. They are a great team.
Hey, I hate that Biden is the Dem nom as well. He's incredibly problematic. INCREDIBLY. BUT...still going to vote for him over Trump in Nov. Because that's what we got. And if you don't because your upset about Biden, them congrats, you've contributed to four more years of hell.
He picked her bc she is smarter than Trump and Biden combined, is a huge badass, and is entirely competent.  The black community isn’t a huge Kamala backer, so your point is moot
Actually this is a photo op.  The difference is Biden didn’t need to shoot and gas peaceful protestors to hold a Bible upside down. He just rode a bike instead while Trump can’t even walk down a ramp.
Biden ain’t slick

Donald Trump gave us four principled clemency grants (Johnson, Munoz, Hall &amp; Negron) and the 1st Step Act, which is more than people expected given his prior statements. I hope and expect that Biden will use clemency- and you should hope so, too.

Harris: 'I believe' Biden accusers
"BIDEN N HARRIS", AMERICA CAN ONCE AGAIN BE PROUD OF THE PRESIDENT N VICE PRESIDENT OF THIS GREAT COUNTRY OF OURS.
Joe Biden picking Kamala Harris as his VP is just more proof that cops and klan go hand in hand.
Because both have mixed records on criminal justice, the Biden/Harris ticket needs to take the initiative and talk early, often and specifically about reform. Then, when elected, they need to do it without reservation or deference to the DOJ.
Very on brand for Joe Biden to be holding his phone upside down. 🤣🤣🤣
Great, what I going to do with all the boxes of these Biden/ ghost of Eliza Hamiliton shirts I ordered ?
AMERICA, BIDEN/HARRIS HAVE PLANS TO FIGHT THE COVID19 CRISIS. trump n dense AFTER 7 MONTHS AND 160000+ DEATHS STILL HAVE NO NATIONAL RESPONSE TO THE COVID19 CRISIS. 1st ignored it Called it a hoax Said over by summer It'll just disappear WHO DO YOU WANT TO LEAD AMERICA'S FIGHT
Those people were going to vote for Biden no matter who he picked for VP.  She doesn't sway a demographic. She doesn't bring a better chance of winning any States. She instead of mitigating some of Biden's biggest problems, amplifies them.  Picking Harris is tactical idiocy.
Kamala Harris was the right pick for the Biden campaign. It’s the safe pick. They didn’t overthink it. I’m thrilled to see a woman and POC on this ticket. I’m also glad republicans can’t relitigate Benghazi/Tarmac/Hillary for the trillionth time if they’d picked Susan Rice. Happy
BIDEN/HARRIS,,, AMERICA FINALLY  HAS SOMETHING IT CAN LOOK FORWARD TOO AFTER ALMOST 4 YRS OF PURE ORANGE BULLSHIT N LIES THAT HAS THE WHOLE WORLD LAUGHING AT AMERICA.
BIDEN/HARRIS=PROVEN WINNERS JUST WHAT AMERICAN NEEDS.  trump/dense=PROVEN LOSERS JUST WHAT AMERICA DOESN'T NEED.
trump KNOWS HE'S GOING TO LOSE 2020 AND WILL YRY ANYTHING TO REMAIN IN POWER.     KAYNE WEST IS NOTHING BUT A INEXPERIENCED UNQUALIFIED trump PIGEON SET UP TO DRAW VOTES AWAY FROM BIDEN
I fully agree with you  Warren would have been an amazing President or Vice President. I’m hopeful that Biden will put her in a key position. I also think Kamala Harris is an excellent choice.
The average American voter is not ready for the first female Vice President of Jamaican and Indian immigrant parents.  Dumb move on Biden team.  Smh.
Biden picks Kamala Harris, his former 2020 rival, to be his vice presidential running mate
Biden/Harris 2020!! Let's Go!!
If Biden wins corona will be the least of our problems
"BIDEN N HARRIS" A PRESIDENT N VICE PRESIDENT AMERICA CAN AND WILL BE  BE PROUD OF. THAT WILL BRING BACK THE RESPECT AMERICA DESERVES  trump n dense.  TWO SENILE  BOZO'S AMERICA'S IS ASHAMED/ EMBARRASSED OF. WHO HAVE DESTROYED ANY/ALL REPECT THAT AMERICA DESERVES.
Personally, Tulsi Gabbard. Nobody I know except for “vote blue no matter who” people like Biden even a little bit, and Tulsi undoubtedly has the power to draw in voters from across the line.  Of course, they wouldn’t have chosen Biden in the first place if they wanted to win.
I’m thrilled. Vote Biden-Harris.
Congrats on your pick!! I was SO hoping you would pick Kamala Harris! You two will make a great team! "Ridin' with Biden!"
It’s February 2021.   It is announced that Joe Biden can no longer perform his duties as President, and  takes over as POTUS. #BidenHarris2020
Trump just won a second term. Smh.  Your average American voter is not ready for the first female Vice President of Jamaican and Indian immigrant parents.  Dumb move on Biden team.
Okay honestly folks, Biden isn’t amazing and neither is Kamala but they’re significantly better than Trump/Pence. Like seriously I’m convinced some of you live in make-believe world where you’re still upset your favorite candidate didn’t get the nomination. Come on...
So Kamala, who did you sleep with to get to be Biden’s running mate? We are gonna have some fun with this! BJ and the hooker! What a team!
Senator Kamala Harris is Biden's VP pick! Congrats, Senator!
#VPPick Well, now the dems will at least win California.  LOL  Harris is the pit bull they need to fight the fights Biden can't handle, which is all of them.
BREAKING NEWS: Joe Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate!  #BidenHarris2020
Kamala Harris for VP, a great choice, vote Biden Harris. 🌊🌊🌊😄😸😊😂
A Harris-Pence debate will be far more interesting, and informed, than any Trump-Biden debate.
BIDEN HARRIS 2020 LETS GO!!!!
How nice for  to finally tell Joe Biden who his running mate will be! #BidenVP
My blood is boiling! How can we shut him up? Trump says men may be 'insulted' by Biden's female VP pledge #Biden2020
Interesting points
I asked one of my buddies, what’s the worst thing about Trump. He said that he lies. He says he’s voting for Biden. 🤷🏽‍♂️
Scary thought: when Biden wins the election trump can start running for 2024.😳
Raging Endorsement, :`)  Why I Want Biden to Lose More than I Want Trump to Win
I’d vote for Biden if he named a cabbage as running mate. Fortunately there aren’t any cabbages on his short list.
So crazy how much I bought into her bullshit and how quickly I forgot she existed after she endorsed Biden. I would say it was a good 2-3 months where I didn’t see anything about her on here. And then shocked at myself for how quickly I forgot about her.
So-called president drumpf forgets the word virus when he is talking about coronavirus. But yet he says Joe Biden is out of it.
Joe Biden/ Imminent .
I AGREE. THE DAMN CONVENTIONS ARE JUST A EXCUSE FOR GROWN UPS TO GET TOGETHER TOO  ACT LIKE KIDS AT A UNCHAPERONED  PARTY.     IT'S BIDEN N trump SO WHO NEEDS A CONVENTION? ESPICALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC?
That dude would have mopped the floor with old man Biden.
DAMN OBVIOUS KANYE,  INEXPERIENCED UNQUALIFIED,  JUST AN ATTEMPT BY trump TO TAKE VOTES AWAY FROM BIDEN. ANOTHER EXAMPLE trump KNOWS HE IS GOING TO LOSE AND WILL DO WHATEVER IS NECESSARY TO PREVENT THAT.       SO FAR trump HAS ASKED KAYNE AND PUTUN FOR HELP, IS KIM JUNG UN NEXT?
TO ONE AND ALL ESPICALLY THE BRAIN DEAD IGNORANT GULLIBLE LAPDOG LACKEY GOP trump SUPPORTERS. SOON TO BE POTUS BIDEN HAS PLANS TO FIGHT THE COVID19 CRISIS AND SAVE AMERICAN LIVES.  trump IN HIS GROSS INEPT INCOMPETENT MURDEROUS  MISHANDLING OF THE COVID19 CRISIS HAS::
BIDEN PLANS ON BEATING COVID19. trump IGNORED IT, CALLED IT A HOAX, NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT  OVER BY SUMMER, IT WILL JUST DISAPPEAR. AFTER 7 MONTHS N 160000+ DEATHS STILL NO NATIONAL RESPONSE TO THE COVID19 CRISIS.      WHO DO YOU WANT TO LEAD AMERICA'S FIGHT AGAINST IT?
Biden is apparently announcing his VP running mate this week! I won't lie that I'm secretly rooting for Michelle Obama who isn't even on the list!
Dude, who are you going to vote for them? All this hate you spew for Biden only helps Trump... you don't see this??
you must be completely high or drunk or both. in the last few months, have you had the opportunity to watch Joe Biden try to carry/express a thought to completion?
10,000 times as often and worse.  Get used to it Biden voters.  We can do this for four years too... if you get that lucky.
The only reason that I plan to watch the conventions is that I'm expecting both to be a spectacular comedy of technical errors.  If Biden's streams are any indicator, the Team D one is almost guaranteed to come apart at the seams.
As a hard working American I can't handle 1 day of Joe Biden
Hahaha, I’m joe Biden &amp; I forgot I insulted black folks. Not only that I was never ASHAMED of the Mass incarceration Bill; remember African Americans are not socially &amp; “mentally developed” he believed they belong in jail like heynas. Don’t vote JOE!
Oh man, but Trumpypoo said in his sensationalized, overproduced smear ads that Biden is weak and not fit for office! It’s almost like he was trying to divert attention away from his own failing health. 🤯
As another lifelong Republican, I like you am supporting Biden and the Democratic Party 100% with money and my vote! The Republican Party is a disgrace and should all be voted out of office for undermining the rule of law and supporting Trump’s actions.
very sad that biden is the democratic nominee. we coulda had bernie
#QuestionAskedAndAnswered dept.:  I do, because Biden's VP pick is the Democratic Party's real presidential nominee.  #SurprisedIHaveToPointThisOut  #NextQuestionPlease

Vote Joe Biden 2020!
Do you suppose he's going to challenge Biden to a Thigh-Q test?
YES,SOMETHING SMELLS. THE LIE HOUSE MUST BE FUMIGATED N THEN FUMIGATED N THEN FUMIGATED AND trumps REPULSIVE STINK MIGHT BE A LITTLE EASIER FOR BIDEN TO HANDLE WHEN HE ENTER INTO THE WHITE HOUSE AFTER WINNING THE 2020 ELECTION. THAT, BIDENS,WIN, WILL SMELL SO SWEET
No way could Biden spell monolith or provide a definition.  Dementia Joe hasn't written a single tweet in the last year.  When he has to meet Trump on stage without a teleprompter, ear piece, or notes, it will be  GAME OVER!
We have huge problems in this country right now...Biden’s gaffes do not fall into the category of a problem. 🤨
Here is the fact. Biden will select the person who he thinks will help him win the election. I’m completely satisfied with all of the women currently on the short list. I’ll support whoever is selected. That said I prefer Sen Harris.
I hope he gets a pardon from President Biden.
Read this whole thread. I’m not going to comment on the content, but simply that Joe Biden does not write his own tweets lol.
People are working for money! This is Biden and Obama’s biggest night mirror
Biden is portrayed as a familiar face and reliable statesman in contrast with the volatile Trump. In reality, he promises to be the most liberal president in history, writes
Kare 11 what do you think sunrisers think of Biden’s massively racists comments yesterday?   Please ask
Kare11 are you going to ask sunrisers what they think of Biden’s incredibly racist comments yesterday?   Or does that not fit your narrative?   If trump said these words I can only imagine.....,.
Willing to lie to Congress. Guess he’s qualified to serve in the trump administration. Vote for Biden and get rid of all of these guys.
Biden said something stupid and owned it. Who knew this was possible?
I worked for Bernie's campaign and i am a Democratic socialist, but I can see past my privilege to know what 4 more years of Trump will do to us.  I don't like Biden, but we have 2 choices, and Biden will bring a respectable cabinet and jurors with him. We need that.
I’m a proud gun owner who refuses to vote for you.  We own guns to protect us from a tyrannical government.  I’m sure Biden would do no worse than your Portland stunt.  If he does, that’s why we have a second amendment.
your thoughts after posting a similar Biden video today? Let's be honest, neither one is a good idea.You do know Biden is why we have Clarence Thomas on the supreme court. So there goes that shit theory
Well- you didn't win that election either, so. Russia got you to the Oval Office.... not you. You under estimate both Biden and Harris and you will find out on November 3. You are going to prison dude.
Postal union endorses Biden candidacy as 'survival' of USPS at stake
BaBye.  46+47=Biden Harris Maybe in 12 years what’s left of the GOP will put up drunky Matt.
Voting for Biden and Kamala is not going to erase the irreparable damage they have already done. It not only justifies their shitty stances but does very little to change systemic problems.
Dude was in some horror movie my grandmother told me about. I’d imagine his aides have his twitter account and goof on some fools. 46+47= Biden Harris
I felt so much hurt though your poem. U can go to any fire station  4 help. 1st begin to love yourself, not just using your left hand because it feels like you are with a stranger, your heart can open to the Biden Harris equation 46+47= USA wins. Even his “ballandchain” feels it
I feel like you didn't read my response since I'm saying I'm not even convinced Biden/Harris is progress if all they do is bring the Dem party to the right; Mass incarceration, pot criminalized, still ICE, no univ healthcare, etc. It's gunna be BS ID politics. Hope I'm wrong.
it would actually slap if Biden could be construed as a socialist in any meaningful way
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have nothing to run on except being for law breakers at the expense of the law abiding
Internal Documents Circulated To DNC Delegates Hint At Why Biden Picked Harris  via
Biden says all U.S. governors should mandate masks to slow pandemic
Trump is an unmitigated disaster. The GOP should own that. Instead, the Democrats have invited them to headline the DNC, form a superpac to support Biden, rehabilitate their reputations, and pull the party even further to the right than it already was. This is "resistance"?
I'm trying to stay out of political posts but imagine being the person that die hard supports Trump and also posts about Biden making women uncomfortable. I mean c'mon guys and now I'm seeing stuff about Kamala not being from here like where do we draw the line?
Biden says all U.S. governors should mandate masks to slow pandemic
I swear to god if I wind up voting for Biden &amp; he fucking loses or takes the US farther down the shit hole we’re going down, I’m blocking all you “blue no matter who” bitches. Y’all give me the option of pedo/rapist A or pedo/rapist B &amp; expect me to vote with a clean conscious??
I’ll stress Trump 2020 b4 I let Joe Biden run black ppl into da ground.
After watching Hamilton again, I think that Trump and Biden should duel and whoever wins will be our president.
Once Biden defeats you in November, someone is going to cold clock you sooo effin hard 😆 Your fat ass is going to be lying on the ground crying like the little pansy you are 😂 😂
There is an Australian new channel that has done a segment on Creepy Joe’s memory loss. It’s scary! The title is Biden’s cognitive issues can no longer be ignored.
if anything, one of the reasons a Biden win is important is so there'll be some bipartisan support for restricting executive power- the Ds aren't going to do that when a R is in power, that'd be Going Against The Process, but they might vote for it for a D pres for Bipartisanship
Normally I'm not againsts masks but this coming from Biden? No.
no, what happens in 2024 after a Biden win is that the dems go "oh, that worked" and run another conservative.  and we're *getting* four years of GOP, if not in 2021 then relatively soon. if your strategy is "win every time and change nothing", that's bound to fail eventually
Former Vice President and current Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden says he wants a three-month nationwide mask mandate. What do you think?
New IV Words – One Berner to others, I’m asking – again – please do not enable Trump. That means voting Biden/Harris rather than staying home or voting for a 3rd-party, no-chance-in-hell candidate. Read the post:  #environment #ClimateCrisis #TrumpOut2020
Biden is responsible for a lot of hardline criminal justice policies that targeted people of color. He's a VERY oldschool democrat. He's no Strom Thurmond that's for sure but he's not what we're looking for progressively. I'll just tell people i'm voting for Harris.
Biden calls for nationwide mask mandate
I assume you're donating all the profits to the Biden/Harris campaign.
C'mon already. I can't stand the fake judge, but she's obviously echoing Fox's lame talking points about Biden not being healthy/fit for office here.   Can we stop being outraged by the worst bad-faith interpretations of EVERYTHING?!
Biden's campaign is incoherent nonsense.  He's holding a knife to stab religious in the back if elected.
also lots of trump signs obviously but i just mean that in the places where you might think you'd see a biden sign, you didn't
drove across northern minnesota recently and saw lots of blm yard signs and state &amp; local DFL candidate signs but not a single biden sign... makes u think
New math   46 + 47= Biden + Harris you will have at least 8 years to comprehend this equation.
God willing BIDEN AND HARRIS WIN and UNDO 45'S TRAITORUS ACTS.THIS INCLUDES REPUGS IN SENATE/AND HOUSE
The country COLLAPSED under you.  The world is laughing at us because of YOU.  Russia and China are taking advantage of us NOW.  Biden/Harris will unite us and make us stronger!
I’m a Christian.   Please stop talking for all “christians”, if your party is really ‘pro-life’ why the vehement stance against masks, against science &amp; for opening the economy &amp; schools without a plan except “thoughts &amp; prayers”.   Asking for a friend!
If y’all idiots vote for Kanye instead of Joe Biden . Trump will win mark my words 🤦🏾‍♂️
I wonder if Kamala will make that same smug, incredulous look on her face when Joe Biden manages to lose against the most unpopular candidate in history.
Biden &amp; Harris sitting in a tree burning America first came crime then came terror then the branch broke and they were eaten by cannibals
I'm confused. Are we talking Trump or Biden?
Nothing that Kamala Harris has said or done in the past is going to matter at this point. Only thing that matters is what she does and says over the next 3 months. Same goes for Biden, unfortunately.
Joe Biden eats little boys , prove me wrong
Who are you voting for &amp; how do you NOT understand that any vote not for Biden is a vote for Trump? Like it or not, that’s a fact you can rely on. All this talk to organize, overthrow &amp; protest doesn’t change that &amp; is tangential to the election. Takes a multi-pronged approach.
Cancel Biden!
I disagree. It's the moderates and independents that are going to decide this election and getting as many Republicans as possible to disavow Trump is the best way to get their vote. AOC supporters are voting for Biden anyway except for the few Bernie whiners who are sitting out.
Biden &amp;Harris  Obama &amp; Biden  Third term
Fox News host baselessly claims that 'something's going to happen' to Joe Biden, forcing her colleague to walk her comment back  via  Trump and company only wish something would happen to Biden.
That train about to run into a wall!!! It's called Biden/Harris.
Well Trump has done more for this country than Biden has and it’s not even close. 3 1/2 years to 50.
It pretty obvious who we’re forced to vote for at this point but people are allowed to air their legitimate grievances with the candidate that’s been forced upon us. I don’t think it’s fair to try to shut down how people feel about Biden.
So people get pissed at Biden
What the hell is wrong with you people? First, Biden is a Catholic.  Second, why would that MATTER???????????
Whoa, boy.  You don't dare go up against Kamala Harris.  She'd eat you alive. As will Joe Biden.  You're failing fast.
Health questions for Biden off-limits for media, unlike Reagan, McCain and Trump  #FoxNews
it’s as if they think the conditions that led us to Trump will disappear by voting in Biden. it’s not gonna get any better and Biden 2020 is gonna set up something psychotic like a Gaetz/Cotton ticket in 2024.
Joe Biden picking Kamala Harris for VP is like the sound of a starters pistol. It's time. Time to end this horrible joke of a presidency, time for a return to decency, and most importantly, time to kick Covids ass
It’s off and on, site is crashing, but if you go to the antifa website, and click on the “take action link”, it also takes you to the Joe Biden campaign page
And kill the energy economy. Oddly without the growth from the oil industry the   Biden administration would have had a worse economic record. And they still want to destroy the coal, oil industries and the millions of jobs that go with it.
Pro-life groups denounce Biden-Harris as ‘most pro-abortion ticket in history’ -  -
wrong.  Biden said he would appoint Beto as his gun czar.  Just google Beto and guns and see what he has said.
David, I can name several policies but in place by the Trump ADM to improve minorities lives.  What policies have Harris and Biden done in their years in the Senate.  Let me save you the trouble  NADA  zero zip   they talk a big game but don't deliver for minorties ever
Pretty simple, Biden and Harris are spend spend spend, open borders, they are both against fracking and cheap energy.   Both are for higher taxes.  Also both are phonies.  Their policies have done nothing to help minorities and Trump has.  Biden has done nada for 40yrs
what actual alternative is there to Biden though, i don't want to vote for the guy but i just see a bad choice and a worse one
Some things, not everything, will get better if Biden wins. Nothing will get better if we give up and let Trump win.
Kamala Harris Is Biden’s VP Pick — Here’s What It Means For The Election And Beyond | FiveThirtyEight
Yes but, if you vote for Biden and live somewhere like California where he's  guaranteed to win, you won't be doing much. But if enough people vote third party, we may see one party adopt their values. This isn't as good as getting a third party president, but it's something.
I seen that lmao plus who use to play footsies with Ghiselle and Epstein!? I am so excited that Biden picked such a strong woman!!! I could tell he was shaking in his  Shoes he took 2 minutes to insult her! It's ok Kamalas a big girl she definitely can handle those twats!
Biden is a practicing Catholic . Please apologize and correct the information.
every single celebrity who is hyped for Biden/Kamala
Biden VP pick Harris promoted group that put up bail for alleged violent criminals  #FoxNews
If Biden wins, it’s going to be deliciously entertaining when Heidi Heitkamp is named ag secretary and North Dakota Republicans lose their minds.
This person is clearly talking about how insane it would be to back Biden right now
Within minutes of the presumptive Democratic nominee's announcement Tuesday, false information was circulating on social media, claiming that Harris had called Biden a "racist" and that she is not eligible to be president.
It's an important and valid question. Joe Biden admitted he probably wouldn't live until the end of his first term. #KamalaHarrisVP #JoeBiden2020
Bill.   What happened to you?    Debates show the difference in policy.  Thinking on your feet.  How you handle pressure.   Only reason you made this idiotic post is yku know Biden would embarrass himself like he did in the Democratic debates and he’s a lot farther gone now
Wow, nothing slanted here from the “impartial media”. She actually says, that it’s likely that Biden won’t be able to fulfill his term. That’s where we are? The left is going to vote for a guy that isn’t going to make it 4 years and will be replaced with a failed candidate.
Walz, Flanagan endorse Biden-Harris presidential ticket
Kamala Harris is officially Joe Biden's running mate. The crew is giving their thoughts right now. Listen live at:
Walz, Flanagan endorse Biden-Harris presidential ticket
For some strange reason I read your tweet as saying :”Harris will blow Joe Biden.” Weird.
Along with the fact that she called out Joe Biden on his BS on national TV. also, she is the perfect VP to go against the party of "Law and Order" when those fucks wanna try to be like "she is too harsh in constitutes" when they have LITERALLY BEEN PUTTING KIDS IN CAGES
The turn around dialogue gets everyone farther from reality and the reality is BIDEN VS TRUMP. So, to me, while Biden is a fucking nightmare unto himself, tearing down anything anti 🚽 speaks for itself
During his time as Obama's VP, when did he ever show he was a "Uniter"? When did he ever express an appreciation for the local police forces? Didn't ANTIFA and BLM start their roots under the Obama/Biden administration? Biden is now a tool of the Socialist/Communist Left.
Is There Any Racial or Ethnic Group that Joe Biden Hasn’t Insulted Yet?
I am still sticking to my prediction that Biden doesn't make it out of the convention as the nominee
FYI, I am still sticking to my theory that Joe Biden doesn't make it out of the convention as the nominee
You do realize that these are all Democrats don’t you?  Joe Biden Democrats.  The NAACP used to have a saying, “a mind is a terrible thing to waste”. You are the proof…

Biden isn't the answer. Both parties are corrupt. Vote 3rd party/green. Jesse Ventura is a perfect example.  #tuesdayvibes #BidenHarris #Trump #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #VoteBlueNoMatterWho #politics
Biden could just as well have chosen Bernie, since he's adopted Bernie's agenda anyway. They could have made AOC an overlooking presence to secure the young commie vote.
If you're still playing the game that Kamala didn't call Biden a racist than you probably believe Joe had something to do with picking her as his running mate.
Biden just accurately conveyed the basic difference b/w strategy &amp; tactics, and while shocked I'm legit happy when any politician gets it correct.
Curious about Biden's Kamala Harris VP pick? See how she measures up on Rights For All.
Former vice president and current Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has chosen U.S. Senator Kamala Harris of California as his running mate, making her the first African American woman on a presidential ticket.
Kamala Harris basically called Biden a rapist and then Joe Biden offered her the vice presidency which she accepted. Huge sellout move on both ends and y’all are eating it up (even though most of you don’t know who Kamala Harris is) because she’s a black woman.
Not sure if Dr. Jill Biden can be Secretary.
Biden doesn't know the difference
We have buttons too!
Trump being a proto-fascist doesn't mean we should allow our leaders to react without scrutiny. Biden could have picked anyone. He picked Kamala Harris.
LET'S GO! #KamalaHarrisForVP

Joe Biden selects Kamala Harris as U.S. vice-presidential running mate
Democratic presidential candidate Biden taps Senator Kamala Harris as running mate
Biden wrote the 94  crime bill that put massive amounts of black men in jail back in the 90s   Democrats are/were the Dixiecrats in the south who upheld KKK values   Check out Dem. Harry Byrd and his southern manifesto  Shit Carter, Johnson, Clinton.    Both parties are vile
Great not only do I have to vote for Joe Biden, now I also have to vote for Kamala Harris????? Fuck
Not that they aren’t out there   But there’s an agenda and politics is typically straight pandering to black people.  Sadly population is quick to eat it up   They did it with Obama which is the only reason Biden has a chance at all
Here is the famous tweet that ran in conjunction with her challenge during the debate more than a year ago.
Kamala famously challenged Biden's record on opposing legislation that would have desegregated schools with busing policy changes.
Harris, 55, becomes the first Black woman on a major presidential ticket in U.S. history.
Joe Biden has picked California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate, fulfilling his promise to ask a woman of color to be his vice president. The former presidential candidate exited the race nine months ago but had a lot of praise among Black voters.
Kamala Harris is Biden's running mate? Hell yeah... she should be president
Huzzah. In a time of growing unrest because of police brutality and the failure of leadership to respond to the people's voice, Joe Biden has selected Kamala "I'm The Top Cop" Harris to be his running mate.  Hey, remember when she pretended she hated him on the debate stage?
unbelievable that biden chose harris
voting for Biden is was easier now with Kamala Haris as VP

VOTE FOR BIDEN REGARDLESS OF VP PICK. WE SUPPORT ANY FEMALE RUNNING. NO PICK HER APART.
Unfortunately Bernie did not get in, that's what i wanted as well. But if trump gets another term all those things you and i care about will be in even worse shape. Please vote for Biden

I went from the 20’s to the 80’s. I think 30k is out of reach. Probably the pessimist in me. But it’s still cool to see what your doing. Keep it going. Can’t let Biden win. I didn’t follow you to get a follow back honestly. I just like reading your message and seeing this grow
More than 100 Black leaders and celebrities urge Biden to pick a Black woman as VP"... I don't think these "Black leaders" will vote for Joe Biden; I don't care what the color of the VP is, BUT! if there are plans to hold the WH in 2024 than I think the answer is obvious.
Joe Biden in the morning without his drum of lotion
Biden won't fix anything
How could you have a ballot already? They are not finalised, Biden hasn't pick his vp yet
You think it’s funny they cover up Biden’s coma?
You can not like trump, vote for Biden and still see that he isn't going to be in charge of anything.
Wait, I thought Joe Biden was still camping out in his basement. 😉
Believe in Life After Biden
It’s just a Joe Biden clone, but a little smaller
So Biden is secretly in charge.  Got it.
You damn right fool! We ask questions. We see whats wrong. And let people know, their common sense is is not the problem. Morons voting for Biden with no clue of where he is. That's the problem. Not Trump. Trump 2020!!
as if I would pay money to vote for Joe Biden lmao
Hillary Clinton: Biden has 'great choices' for running mate to help defeat 'wannabe authoritarian'  via
Biden isn’t powerful. He’s impotent. Acting like he is is just deflection
So it’s ok for trump to be racist bc Biden used to be like Trump. Works at a MAGA rallies of the intellectually deprived
Predictably, the "science" won't be taken as fact unless Biden wins
What? I'm saying it will cease to be a story if Biden is elected
The irony is both of those are going to disappear if Biden wins
Duh.  Nearly everyone prefers Biden....only Russia and maybe Israel prefer Trump.
You picked two gay men who don’t hold office. I’m not gay, and I “understand” perfectly. They have way less than influence over the FDA than Joe Biden would as President, or whomever he picks as secretary of HHS, or literally any sitting member of Congress, for example.
Anyone with a brain in their head could figure out that he is running for President as some ploy to get voters away from Biden. And for no other reason.   He is no more qualified to be 'President' than the current bozo Cheeto Jesus in the White House
Damn good piece. So a line got worded wrong, but Maureen included both Hillary &amp; Sarah Palin in their struggles with white male bullshit.  No Wrist Corsages, Please

This is what I hear all time. His followers, the cult. Yet Biden followers arent turning a blind eye?
And Biden isnt?
No stories on the Fox reaction to Biden's "blacks are all the same" comments? I suppose you'd have to admit it happened first.
No, PR person, you didn't make those comments. Biden did. He needs to address them personally, not hide behind a tweet written for him by his handlers.
Maybe Biden will reverse a wrong. Taiwan was settled 6000 years ago by indigenous people. Not Chinese. Recognize Taiwan as an independent country. What’s China going to do, really. Our economies are codependent. F em. A bad decision a few many years ago needs reversing. Our Ally.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot   You know what makes me moist? Campaign funding request emails. Get the special sticky feeling every time you open your Gmail by throwing some coin Uncle Joe's way. Together we can depose Donald
You get on Rogan and seem normal. Then you do a 180 on fox and friends and speak hyperbole. Biden doesn't believe in de-funding the police nor will anyone get their taxes doubled. What are you talking about?
Get Trump out of office. I support BidenBush Jr. is really the worst president. Biden and Bush's administration is created the Patriot Act. They put on on a path of the end of Habeas Corpus.
Politics just got so much more sneaky in America... using Biden as a shield for the real presidential candidate is genius. On the right, strong candidate with weak vp on the left weak candidate with a strong strong vp
Finally asked how she could call Biden a racist on stage and now be on the same ticket, Kamala replies:  “It was a debate. A debate.”  “So you didn’t mean it?”  “Debate. Debate!” Amid strange laughs.  Exhibit 8B of why she was not a good choice for Biden.
But Biden/Harris calling for a national mask mandate is totally the authoritarian ticket in this election
Ok we get it Kamala Harris is a Narc. Her and Biden are a reunion tour of the crime bill. It sucks.....but let’s be real y’all stop playing and tell people to vote for them before we get stuck with homeboy again 🙄
My father was a Navy Vet of the Korean War. He and his group of Vets of the Local VFW all Trump voters. They were all Wartime Vets. Proud of their service, proud of their President who appreciates them and fights for their rights that the dirtbag Biden doesn’t care  1 bit about
i dont understand how people will "Hold his feet to the fire"  this entire election cycle has proven they can just do whatever, whenever and people will fall in line. a fucking cop as VP in 2020 and people are lapping it up. biden don't care what anybody thinks
What if after they were elected, Biden was unable, and then we find that Kamala is not legit... guess who gets to take over? Nazi Pelozi! It's an excellent eEeeEeEvil plan!
Cant help but think #Biden is the corp overlords, forcing ppl to work slave wages while #Kamala is the thin blue line, killing us telling us “im not gonna do something that only benefits black ppl” while #Trump is the feds, breaking laws/shredding civil rights  #FuckTheDuopoly
well, those challenges will take quite some time. good thing Biden and Harris will be the running the show in the meantime.
Biden chastised for 17 mph in fast lane,left turn signal on.
Seriously, part of the problem was various progressive take writers arguing she could be some sort of PM or something for Biden, it was dumb then and remains dumb now:
Joe Biden. The placeholder candidate. #Election2020
And you want big brother Biden (I couldn't pass on the alliteration) telling you how to think. You know, honored sir, we have more in common than what you may feel comfie with.
No, but I do think they seek power, and will do so within the Democratic Party if they can. And the Biden wing of the party may be too quick to welcome them.
Now we know why USPS is making headlines fueled by DNC. There is a vested interested in helping Biden win.
That Wallace/Trump interview was disastrous for Trump. Almost as bad as the one after that. Biden can just sit back and watch this clown self destruct.
Biden can’t be worse - Trump’s already proven he’s in way over his head and with disastrous results.
Fuck You  I Will Stand In Line ALL FUCKING DAY With My Covid Gear On To Vote Your Corrupt Ass Out Of Office! Robbing The USPS Isn't Stopping Me From Casting My Vote!! #BIDENHARRIS2020 #BidenHarris2020Landslide #Biden
Warren &gt; Biden   Lol y’all fucked up
So since you don't think Biden can handle the situation, you can admit that you're not actually thinking of voting for him, right? You're saying that he's weak on crime and you wouldn't want a radical Democrat in the White House, right??
Kamala Harris and Joe Biden are far from perfect but it is a vote to get trump out, secure RBG’s Supreme Court seat, and restore all minorities &amp; LGBT+ rights that have been demolished by trump supporters. It’s not about those 2, it’s about all of us saving our lives from trump
Chances that The Robert's Court will care about lawsuits brought that claim rulemaking is void since the acting heads are in violation: Zero, as long as Trump or other Republican is Potus. Chances that the Robert's Court would have different findings under Biden, Harris? Not zero
Or maybe the USPS endorsing Biden. The people charged with delivering all those mail in ballots. Hmmm,  what could go wrong there? DA
Do you losers get in a room to agree upon Obama/Biden/Comey cabal?
Does anyone else notice they aren't even trying to hide their lies and thievery?  Are we going to be able to try them when Biden is in? The insider trading from meetings prior to the #TrumpVirus, etc.
There's an organized group on here: Mangy Jay, Jeff Fecke, that Wilson Valdez account, etc. They have a DM or something and organize little micro-swarms in defense of Pelosi, Biden, etc. In their spare time they complain about Bernie and the Intercept a lot. It's a shtick
The argument is not Biden himself is going to save lives. The argument is that Trump’s and the goals of his party, are authored with the  explicit intent of harming a lot of vulnerable people. Of course work on the ground is most important. Trump is a deep impediment to that tho.
Biden has known her for years and he isn't a vindictive a-hole. He chose wisely.
Vote Biden.  We need to climb out of this pit.
There are a ton of them trolling Biden, acting as if they are concerned liberals.
California is in play? Biden is polling 30 points ahead there. He's polling 25 points ahead in New York.
People I won’t be voting for in November... #Trump #Biden
Well biden has a pulse . Not much of one but it ticks a little
Will you effectively be President Mr./ Mrs. Biden’s twitter writer? You seem smart enough I suppose.
My thinking is informed by Joe Biden's record. His past performance.   I expect him to repeat the same policy preferences that minimizes us, and maximizes his big donor friends.
Or to put it another way, the case that the race could dramatically change due to a Biden scandal or some sort of decline in COVID was far stronger in May than it is two weeks before Labor Day (after which lots of voters will start paying much more attention)
Good summary of the reasons why Biden is likely to win (yes there is still time for things to change but time keeps ticking away)
Anyone who supports Biden is betraying the working poor. Because that is what biden did as senator and as VP.   Biden is a war-making, deregulator funded by the financial industry, who expanded unconstitutional executive power, wars, mass incarceration, fossil fuels and misery!
Biden’s response when his hidden ear piece malfunctions at the debates.
Again,  hilarious someone backing Trump tosses out sexual assault allegations as criticism of Biden.  Everyone’s seen the law suits  has been involved in and had to pay millions to make go away.  How can you point at Biden, yet support a man that’s much worse?
I'm am saying the donors of the common people is who I want my candidate influences by.   I'm saying who funds the campaign matters!  That exactly what im saying.   Joe biden is funded by vile corrupt people and he cares about them!
FAKE NEWS: Joe Biden spreads unhinged conspiracy theory about the USPS removing mailboxes in Portland  via
Again Biden was propped up by big donors, dark money, pacs, and super packs funded by the big donors.   He did not depend on small donors.  You are in serious denial.   Sanders depended on a million small dollar donors. Biden depended on the plutocracy.   It's not the same thing.
You are comparing the kind of influence our revolution has on Bernie Sanders to Biden's financial supporters and groups?   It's willful ignorance to suggest Biden's dark money donors are the same kind of people who donate to our revolution!
Just as it takes one hip hop star - suffering from mental illness - to sabotage the Black vote for Biden. Smh 🤦🏾‍♀️ 🤯
U seen Biden old ass 👀
Tr*mp supporters don’t know we are losing with biden because Bernie is the only change maker.  We are being considerate when they call us names and we do not call them names back. There is a reason to be angry with them though because he is so rude!
Okay it’s time we talk about how the FUCK did BIDEN and CLINTON get those nominations over BERNIE? Not even just looking at their political stances, but at their ACTUAL supporters. There has GOT TO BE people working actively against him being in office. Send tweet.
Biden supporters launched Dark money groups, I do over simplify Super Pacs into the dark money phrase.   It's willful ignorance on your part to not understand that how Joe funds his campaign, effects how he will govern.   Biden is a puppet to the big donors.  He served them!
My thoughts exactly, and this should be implemented day one of the Biden/Harris term
I can't wait to hear Biden pronounce Mykola Zlochevsky.
I’m white. I went to trade school. I’m voting for Biden. Also who are these people being polled? No one has ever asked me🤔
Go vote for the other Biden then, Jack!
The question is: will media allow Biden and Harris to continue not answering questions? You would think that some ethics might still be relevant for journalists - this far those seem to be lacking. A major party candidate has been in a hidey hole for 3 months and media takes it.
. wants to mandate every American wear masks OUTDOORS!   hasn’t required that (yet). So when will he denounce this authoritarianism from Biden/  When will the media ask  if she supports a federal mask mandate (that includes outdoors)?
Moreover they are extreme-right. E.g. Biden's closer to, say, Milton Friedman's views than the actual center.
Super Pacs funded by the financial industry. Are what I call dark money.  Sanders was largely funded by a million small donors. He did not depend on Super Pacs, or meet with big donors to reassure them "Nothing would fundamentally change".  I agree Biden didn't rely on grassroots
Alicia Mendoza, do you understand the difference between voting at the Democratic National Convention next week vs a vote in November General Election? Bernie wants his delegates next week to vote for for Bernie. Then he wants his supporters to vote for Biden in November!
What the fuck even was that conversation. She also had a totally incorrect timeline for when people were dropping out and endorsing Biden, and had totally the wrong idea about how people were doing in actual delegates and votes before that happened.
I agree Biden is not the choice if you want personal freedoms, but literally any mainstream candidate isn’t either. To enforce these laws they support massive police forces and funding and nobody wants it to stop since it’s lining there pockets 🤷🏼‍♂️
Me too.  I think Biden has been anal probed by many aliens
I am voting for Biden and Harris. I'm doing this without reservation. I will mark their names on the ballot gleefully and of my own sound mind. I totally and fully support them.  But goddammit, we missed an opportunity with Warren.
my problem with Biden is that he's too similar to Trump
The country in its current state existed before Trump and will continue exist with Biden.
Another disadvantage of tweeting under your real name: it’ll be easier for the #tRUmpstapo to find you.
She was an Attorney General that prosecuted violent criminals. How many violent criminals that Mike Pence put behind bars? Trump and his allies should just drop the anti-cop trope against Biden because it sounds freaking stupid at this point.  The anti-cop folks hate Harris BtW..
Again, without DARK money and a corrupt media propping up Joe Biden, he would not be the presumptive nominee.  Also, Biden was funded by the plutocracy, Sanders was funded by the people. I guess you can't tell the difference?
To clarify, I don't think Biden will "save" anything or anyone  But if he somehow doesn't ratfuck labor and delivers on his positions, he'll be giving us the tools to move past him
It sucks, and I'm never gonna do the whole Blue Vote Browbeat. But Biden at least has a few appeals to pro-labor policies as opposed to Trump trying to trample them, and I trust the ability of a union to throttle the economy more than any elected right now, so
I thought for sure you were JFK Jr.!
I had been expecting a major drop in the stock market as a result of congresse's stimulus failure. So far that hasn't happened. It could be that the markets are already anticipating Trump leaving office &amp; speculating on a more stabil &amp; predictable economy under Biden.
Biden/Harris - Pro Unbridled On Demand Abortion Paid for by us - taxpayers 😡
Are you ... JFK Jr.?!
Kamala and biden have told more lies in three days than Trump has told in his almost 3 years. Keep talking Bette. Conservatives love you! 🤭🤣

Friends, if Joe Biden was not propped up by dark money and a corrupt, corporate media, Bernie Sanders would likely win!
“In the context of Biden’s words, this is evident. Clearly some, including those without that context, have wrongly attributed Biden’s words to Johannes, and in doing so have attributed abhorrent and inaccurate motives to him.” 👍👍
Even Joe Biden has stated this won't be an easy transition. tRump's going to do all he can to lie &amp; cheat his way into staying #FakePresident. The only thing I see that will stop him is the continuation of his Impeachment, w honest members &amp; changing of laws. 😾😾😷
Thats great. The dems now Fascists won't be able to cheat. POTUS cares about this country and its not looking so good with an unlikeable wench and a biden that does not remember who his is running agaisnt. Tell the truth

I don’t even want to visit with my relatives who are conservative.. republican.. you know 😒 just saw a fb post “if you think Biden will change anything, you’re an idiot” from my fam so..just tired of it. Unfollowed.
Biden’s not the one taking cognitive testing. Who brags about remembering 5 words in a row?  It’s absolutely laughable.  You can make stuff up all you want about Biden...we’ve got the Truth to look at about  He thinks remembering 5 words is an accomplishment. Lol
Agreed. I think we all need to be careful about despair turning into inaction. There are LOTS of ways u can help with elections efforts (volunteering, donations, just texting the Biden supporters in your life) and your words may encourage others to dismiss this as “wasted time.”
(Also, people who would need to be shamed into voting for Biden are probably not following any of us on Twitter)
So You’re voting for Trump then because..... ? Kanye is a fuckin joke so you either swallow your pride and vote Biden or vote Trump to support hatred and racism
This Sedaris quote has been around since 2008. Let’s consider updating: Biden is the shit-glass; Trump is a bullet in your brain.  Analogies. You can do whatever you want with ‘em!
That "plan" also requires 2 more democratic presidents in succession following Biden to accomplish. We saw the damage Trump has done to healthcare in one term, yet you still want to take that risk on behalf of poor / underinsured Americans?

After 32 yrs of campaigning, donating, volunteering for Dems, I'm done. They pander to Republicans. They have PAC money from BUSH OFFICIALS (war criminals). These Repubs pushing for Biden want something in return and I'm not willing to go any further right to vote for them.
But she should really be addressed as Senator Harris, with respect. Until she’s Madame President, that is (I don’t see Biden finishing the term).
Unsure, but boy do people get mad when the left brings up Biden's decades of right wing policies or Kamala leaning into Tough On Crime
Biden was VP for the first Black president in American history. Obviously super racist lol
It's 2020 and Biden has no problem condemning racism and white supremacy. President Pussy Grabber just says there are fine people on both sides.
President Biden &amp; Vice President Harris 🇺🇸💙
You are actively doing the opposite of holding the moderates feet to the fire
Your president has officially declared war on the service which people I love rely on for political reasons. You have proven yourself loyal to Trump over American citizens who need support during a pandemic, and your kind have inspired me to devote myself to Biden’s campaign.
If you had told me in high school that I'd still be forced to listen to what Donald Trump, Joe Biden, and Marge Simpson think about things in my 40s, I would have paid more attention in science class and shot myself into the sun.
Biden is not in a position of authority to order anyone to do anything.  Just because he is running for president doesn’t give him any power to order everyone to wear masks until November 3rd.  I’m pretty sure its the exact date he’s going for.
Quite a headline, when it is 46 states

I'm not convinced it matters if you admit you'll vote for Biden or not. They don't care about our votes. They don't want people like us to be anywhere near their party. Someone like Biden in particular will never genuinely move left on anything of significance.
My life does depend on it which is why I'm voting for Biden and Harris, you washed up second rate has been.
It’s definitely important to identify and critique Biden/Harris *once we get them in office*. Right now those critiques are only serving to discount the campaign and give Trump leverage. Yes it’s a broken stupid system. We can’t fix it til we ax Don

The bots that run the Biden/Harris campaign are not very intelligent. They continue to spam us without keeping track of whether or not we have endorsed or given (I've done both). I know, spamming is part of the game; but when it happens via text message it gets annoying.

Funny how they have nothing to say about Trump's father buying his way into University and the fact he had to PAY SOMEONE ELSE to even get his scores up high enough.  But yeah, Biden in 3rd grade.

There's absolutely no room for doubt. Every problem we have with Biden and his administration can be handled because they respect the process, the same can't be said for Trump.

Okay look, I know better than to expect any kind of sense from Shiny Paste and Polyester, but tweeting out this lovely photo is as dumb as when whatsisname tweeted that adorable pic of Biden with his little boy and was like “BURN amirite”
Not to equate them more deeply, but in terms of public posture and confidence, this is so like our president and Joe Biden.
Vote for Biden. First we deal with the threat to our very democracy, then we deal with the other party.
Joe Biden holding the roadmap to electoral victory
I disagreed with Obama’s decision not to investigate/prosecute the decisions to torture, the bank meltdown, etc. It enabled the GOP &amp; the prez to demolish norms and institutions. Biden would shy away from it, but there needs to be some kind of Truth &amp; Reconciliation comission.

The science also doesn’t call for a national mask mandate that includes every citizen to wear masks inside and outside...will you point that out to Mr. Biden. Also, you’re on record that Hydroxychloroquine helped your spouse - is that science then? Thank you.

Kamala Harris Climate Record: Where Joe Biden's Running Mate Stands - Bloomberg
Remember how left-leaning news ran with a narrative that Biden was the "most-electable" candidate?  Like that.
I hope she still will! She is a treasure that can rock a top position in the Biden administration, we need her!
Haha civilized human being , Biden doesn’t even know where he is most days or what is actually coming out of his mouth.
Because Biden is not in control of anything he says. This is the far left telling him what to say.  Unbelievable
I was voting for Biden no matter what, from the grave, if necessary
This is skewed by what the poll considers "white Christians". They should have a category for so called "evangelicals" because I was Methodist now Lutheran and ALL white Christians I know support Biden.
Ha! ^ Good take Danny. You seem ALL IN on Kamala or “don’t matter, anyone but Trump”? It troubling how she called Biden a segregationist, suggested he drop out, believed accusers, but now all good 🤷‍♂️ - phony? We think a mistake it’s not Amy. Is this our winning ticket? Ughh 🥴😩
I really hope Biden wins just so we can bring back “hi I’m in Delaware”
Just saw a biden ad where he talked for 20 seconds about a desk and then concluded with "it's not about the desk, it's the person behind it" and like damn, huge if true
He's worse Nixon tried to pass UBI before the Democrats stopped him, he also believed in socialized medicine. So Biden is actually to the right of Nixon, as is most of the Democratic party.
#VA05 Dem internal has Good up 44%-42% and Trump up 47%-45%.  Pretty solid number for Biden in a district Clinton lost by 11.

Not to mention, no talk of how many delegates Biden received in 2008.
Mainly my point is biden was instrumental in building the circumstances we find ourselves in, and effectively gave us trump. Handing him the reigns is like asking OG dark lord to have another shot
Why are we talking about bernie  Biden seems okay to people that think obama did things that made stuff seem ok when obama was an imperialist war monger riding the final years of "functional" neoliberalism. Biden is an authoritarian that will enter office during cap in crisis

I know the parties are ruled by donors and $$$, but imagine a parallel universe where Biden and Harris made an announcement that the pandemic has caused them to reassess his position on M4A. Make her the point person, she sells it well.  Devastating weapon against Trump and GOP.
Long story short? The states likely to see a breakdown over mail voting are isolated. And the states Biden likely will win with have well-run vote counting. (ie Biden is at 289 electoral votes with states that are Low/Moderate "post office risk.")
I suspect Biden will have a lot of progressives on board. But he needs to win first.

I saw more Biden signs than Trump signs on a recent drive through rural Central Wisconsin.
So Biden/Harris is a 2:1 margin?
Indeed. Trump and his allies, such as the DC examiner are trying to simultaneously paint a picture that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are far left and then post articles about how the far left don’t like them.
More like letting morgoth have the one ring   Biden engineered the world that gave us trump
A “peace deal” between two secret allies who do not have adjoining borders, are not at war, and haven’t threatened war with each other?  Meh.  By the way,  is a con and a grifter.

Fascism is capitalisms immune response to its own contradictions. It will happen unless these contradictions are addressed. A biden ticket will just maintain the status quo, and thus fascism will continue to rise.

How long until President Projection claims Biden would put the USPS out of business?
If you think the rapist label applies to Biden and not only Trump I would encourage you to research it more, that accusation was full of contradictions and suspect ties to Russia
You think Trump has a 1 in 5 chance of winning the popular vote? That seems VERY generous if you look at the 2016 election, Trumps approval numbers throughout his presidency, the popularity of Biden vs Hillary and the enduring failure of Trump’s COVID response.
Donald Trump can’t run on his record, so the focus is on attacking Biden.
🤣🤣🤣 YOU'RE EATING BULLSHIT  TRUMP: 7.8 million jobs lost including 7,100 coal mining jobs &amp; 274,000 manufacturing jobs. Unemployment highest level since World War II  OBAMA/BIDEN Gained a net 11.6 million jobs, unemployment rate dropped, salaries up for all workers 4.2%

They're laughing at us now; they'll stop laughing when Joe Biden takes office!
I think it is hilarious that the first question about Biden's proposed mask mandate is "under what authority could a President order that?"
Biden ('s handlers) are liars to the bone!!  Kamala fits right into that crowd!
Ralph Nader is responsible for the Iraq War, but Joe Biden, who voted for it, is not
Keep watching. The more you lie and support liars the more they will slip in the polls. Biden and Kamala havent told the truth once yet and neither have you.
No! JOE BIDEN did advocate for a national mask mandate BUT of course, he is playing on the fears of his voting minions, who seem to be afraid of their shadows!!
So… If Biden/Harris were president, they wouldn’t have shut down the economy?  I’m sure Harris knows that’s not true.  I’m pretty sure Harris’s target demographic doesn’t.

No. It might just keep him in some sort of check until Biden's inauguration.
Biden-Harris looks like a ticket content to sit on its lead, the way Governor Dewey did in 1948. Though rivals in the primaries, the running-mates have similar anti-crime records, even though their base demands an end to policing.  Patrick Buchanan writes:
Immediate block of anyone who suggests AOC, Buttigieg or Yang as members of a Biden cabinet.  I can't deal with anyone who's that stupid.  Also, I unfollow/mute/block anyone who defends any JD, especially a member of the 'squad'.  No JD is an ally, even if you may think otherwise
Biden leads suburban women by 42%...I guess that “housewives” tweet didn’t do him any favors.

Yeah, I’m sorry. It’s a fucking no brainer. Biden and the Democratic party are shit, but the false equivalency people have made is fucking baby brained.
Everyone is afraid of the traitor and his moods!   Someone with balls needs to take the lead.  ?Biden/Harris?
No I'm voting Kanye even though I know it helps Trump. Biden is responsible for many mass incarcerated black men with the 94 crime bill. Kamala is too from her days as a prosecutor.  Say what you want about Trump but I'll take him over Biden any day.
Flashback: #KamalaHarris said she believed women who accused #JoeBiden of inappropriate touching.  #SleepyJoeAndTheHoe2020
For sure, Biden did tweet about how we need to fund pandemic prevention back in October 2019 and I think I can safely say we would have less deaths if he were at the helm. No way his admin would be shitting on Fauci.
I can’t even imagine how out of touch you have to be to think that people who are unhappy with Biden and the Dem establishment are Russian bots or sympathizers
Biden is just politicizing this, he isn't actually thinking this is the right way to handle it.  No, we shouldn't mandate from the federal government.

When Biden is our President, things will get better!
But when someone says I’ll take him out behind the shed and beat the crap out of him it’s totally cool? Just gauging your outrage here.
Biden. That seems obvious.
I wait and wait for Biden, Harris or any other prominent Democrat to stand up and condemn the violence we are seeing in major cities.  Instead, they are excusing or denying that it exists.  How can they save the country if they won’t look at reality?
Actually, I haven’t seen pictures of him touching young girls inappropriately.  It is rather interesting that instead of defending Biden, you jump to accusing Trump.  If you “know” Trump is a molester, how do you feel about Biden’s public groping of young girls and women?
Jim you know that’s a complete lie.  Joe Biden is not qualified to be the president either and you know that as well!!!!
Are you writing this same shit about Biden or Trump or Pence? Or is it just the woman’s choice in clothing that will be scrutinized?
I’m going to share this again. This is just one person, but there are many more like him. We are screwed if people like him vote so carelessly. He won’t vote Biden because he doesn’t like Harris. He feels no pain, because he doesn’t care about anyone but himself. Selfish...
We are here because of too many Americans are still complacent. I have many friends who don’t pay any attention at all. In fact I had one tell me the other day he wouldn’t vote for Biden since he picked Kamala. He will write in Bloomberg! WTF

Here’s the Democratic convention info- it starts Dec. 17th. My main feeling about it right now is disgust. The DNC shut down the process back in Spring when they picked Biden. Half the states never got to vote with the full slate of candidates.

That is what Trump called Hillary in the 2016 campaign.  So it was a way for people who supported Hillary to turn his words around with sarcasm to show their support for her.  He called Harris a nasty woman within hours of Biden announcing her as his choice for running mate too.
Joe Biden called for a nationwide mask mandate, citing experts’ predictions that it could save 40,000 lives from COVID-19 in the coming months.  #Sunrisers, would you support a nationwide mask mandate?

Also, 54% of Catholics voted for the Obama-Biden ticket in 2008 and 2012.
Just a reminder that even though Biden and Kamala kinda suck if they lose to trump the dnc will go further right wing, cause they are by far the most progressive democratic ticket in recent history Just fucking vote for them, facism or some wierd libs shouldn’t be a tough choice
Did this man Biden really say it's not about ur rights, it's about respect ... Lmaoooo
If basement Biden was a clear winner why would they run in this direction. Just take the sure win and let it ride and report on measuring the drapes. They know he's not winning where it matters.
warren was my top choice during the primaries. she didn't make it. i threw all my support to biden.  it's like trump is a house on fire and the naysayers are fighting over what kind of water to use to put the fire out.  #BidenHarris2020
With their pointless escalation of conflict in America’s cities Trump and Cotton let Biden and the Democrats off any hook for having to answer tough questions about how they regard violence by social justice or just underclass mobs. They can and will just decry regime response.
Can the USPS accept donations? Using the 2016 popular vote for Clinton - if everyone who wants to vote Biden by mail paid 5 bucks a month for the next four months it would raise around a billion dollars and break the GoFundMe platform.
Imagining deploying Boomhauer from King of the Hill to communicate with The Biden like Amy Adams' character in Arrival.

Yeah, but Trump is doing everything he can to do things without you. So, put together a plan so that if Biden wins, day one the House is ready to make sure this can never happen again. Otherwise, just tweets.

Joe Biden can bl0w me.
I understand that POV, however, I think I’m just more optimistic. Parties move with public opinion, and public opinion on climate change action, health care, and other topics is shifting drastically. If Biden doesn’t act on his promises, I promise in 2024 I’ll be on your side.
Trump will repulse women away with his sexist rhetoric even further...I think Biden is going to win WW
I personally think the way to go about it isn’t a hashtag that will fall off the trending tab by morning. I believe the way to do that is to get a man willing to change into office (Biden in this case), then use the power of our base to get change done.
Out of curiousity do you think everything is fine and dandy right now ? Our current administration is a shit show. I didn’t want Biden but that’s ok. I want our country to come together again. I want to sleep at night. Donald Trump is a monster and a horrible human.

I understand that. The information of the damage 45 has done to us in every aspect is there.“I’m not voting” feels like a slap in the face in the same way that people saying vote for Biden does to Black people (not claiming to understand the plight just comparing the emotions).

Well, if it will only save 40,000 lives, won't it be a waste of time now that we have lost 350 million people or so according to Biden. 😉
The most interesting take on this I’ve seen is that UAE is attempting to gain position on behalf of Arab world for when Biden wins whereby US diplomacy will be less critical of Arab aggression and shift focus toward Iran as common enemy.
kills his victim so he can not be sent to jail for life! This is what you get when you vote for Harris/Biden in November! Wait until you/family are the victim and MSM thinks you are as Hillary said deplorable!
We’ve already seen the leaders of the world laughing at you  Remember that awesome NATO reception, where the cameras were on but they thought they were off? That’s reality. Them laughing behind your back. Not some made up propaganda spin you thought up on Biden.
Didn’t she endorse Biden already? 🤨 I don’t see how she benefits from this. Republicans only like Dems when they actively criticize Dems as Dem office holders. They throw them away as soon as they leave office (as she’s doing), or switch parties.
grandpa simpson entering and leaving the burlesque house gif here. also are we just assuming biden is already a walking corpse or what
this is twitter girl, watch her instagram, she;s way more thorough there. Just because she expresses her frustrations with the people who won't vote for biden doesn't mean she doesn't acknowledge the pain that they have and most likely will continue to cause as politicians!

The biggest problem I see with Biden winning and then packing the courts is that this will not be considered for even a second. So we get more progressive judges on a cultural scale but remain stuck with a massively pro-carceral bench
I saw my mom today and she asked me what I thought about Biden's VP choice. I told her.  She was like "Oh... I was happy ☹️"
To think that Harris/Biden is looking out for us American citizens? You are lost!!!! If Trump was not running for re-election I would still vote Republican to keep that mess out of the White House and running our country!!!!!
now and have people that live on the farms to manage them. Who do you think they vote for? They follow what their boss (the corporate henchmen) tell them. Then Obama/Biden sends Somalians into our state and we get Ilhan Omar! ....
Biden not my choice but he is WAY BETTER Trump.
It SUCKS Bernie Sander is not the Democratic presidential nominee. The only thing Biden has going for him is he's better than Trump. Bernie not winning the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016 or 2020, the Democratic party is rigged.
Biden tied in CO-03 is probabily the type of scenario where he is winning statewide in thr neighborhood of 15.
The convention will nominate Biden to run for president. AOC herself said the Democratic Party tent is too large if it includes Biden. Frankly, as a lifelong Dem, I don't think the freshman Congresswomen from NY should get any time.

So should we all start sending Biden-Harris mail to our conservative relatives via USPS now thru November?
Hillary Clinton in 2016 is the reason we have Trump. There was NO WAY I was voting for Hillary. So I didn't vote at all.  This year I'll vote Biden because anything is better than Trump. Thank God, Hillary Clinton is not a choice.
I’m sorry but it’s annoying to see people acknowledging how amazing Kamala Harris is now that she has the official approval of Joe Biden and the mainstream white Democratic Party. People who ignored and/or disparaged her the past 2 years. Sigh…

I actually don’t smoke any weed, not sure where that comes from. You’re the ones that agreed with Pence, saying that this is Biden’s America. But it sure aeems like this is all happening during Trumps America, no?
I mandate a 2.4 oz stainless steel injection for mr biden
I feel the reaction to the Harris announcement supports the “lanes” theory of the primary, and Biden’s dominance of his lane forced Harris to run in a suboptimal lane for her.
Nah, think I'll hold Harris and Biden accountable now.
Well, not all politicians are the same. Politicians are receptive to ideas which fit with their party. Biden was receptive to change in terms of Gay Marriage, Criminal Justice, Climate Change, and Health Care. Trump wouldn’t capitulate on any of those issues no matter what.

Hey Biden, how about passing legislation to make this permanent!
If you search for Emerson Mturk on here you'll get a lot of people smarter than me who can explain it better. But Biden was up 5 in the MU poll in WI a few days ago, and given history, I'd imagine MN to always end up 3-5 points to the left of WI b/c of how big the metro is.

Biden needs to go to jail with his son!
It likely won't, but that's what the Newsweek piece was getting at. I would suspect that Biden's camp did their homework &amp; then some before selecting Harris, so I can't see this going very far. Like similar challenges to selection, these claims often become distractions at best.
The brilliant statistician Andrew Gelman predicted that Hillary would win in 2016 with 98% certainty.   Unlike other pundits who get things very wrong, he wrote a detailed retrospective:   This year he is predicting Biden with 89% certainty though...
Lol. You support Biden???? LOLOLOL oh man people who want to normalize paedophiles are weird and gross.
And it seems we are powerless in stopping him.  I want to have hope and I’m truly excited about Biden/Harris, but this truly seems like a “you can’t fight city hall” situation.  Can no one stop him!?!?  He is doing it in real time.
For people in a party who changes their minds more than their clothes, that's sort of a dumbass thing to say. Especially with kamala and her accusations against biden.
I'm literally only voting for Biden if Trump doesn't back off on the payroll taxes, because if SS goes under, I get forced out on the street

One minute after Biden is sworn in, Trump will be trying to escape this country, mark my words...
“Every single American should be wearing a mask when they’re outside for the next three months at a minimum," Biden said.   Let me think...ok, no.
Terrible and unconstitutional. Outdoors is considered fine by the worlds experts. Buzzz off Biden.
I know Biden and Harris isn’t people’s first choice, but just ask yourself if it’s worth it to not vote for them and keep Trump in office the next 4 years. People who are voting for Trump are all going to vote. Get out there and get this deranged man out of office.
Are we really doing this again? It's so fucking funny that the Trump campaign is doing this while trying to pull the "Biden's the more racist candidate" bullshit.
Tell us how Joe Biden plans to take your penises…I mean guns…away. Also, I've been a bird hunter for 27 years and climate change will have a greater negative impact on pheasant and duck populations than any policy Biden supports. Sportsmen should care about conservation.
Are you a big fan of Biden? Would you have picked him? I mean, dems could have picked Bernie (BLM fav.), Buttegieg (energy, personality). Dems could have picked Harris for pres. Instead, a tired old white man. It's almost like the dems want to lose. Why is that, do you think?
You think Biden's going to do anything about global warming? His own policy page puts carbon neutral in 2050 - 20 years to late to matter
Not Trump is pretty strong motivation for now; other motivations may grow as voters get to know Biden and Harris.  I

The dream of Tammy/Tammy lives on in ‘28
I'm sorry but I can't get excited about Biden. It is so depressing that Trump and Biden are our best options..pitiful.  it's easy to lead from the sidelines as Biden is doing.   We badly need a 3rd party.

Bumbling Biden/Horrible Harris 2020!  Selling out to the...the..you know....the thing!
I have been all over Minnesota the past few weeks and I have seen so many Trump signs and flags.  I still have yet to see a single Biden sign anywhere, including downtown Minneapolis.
2. Biden is a refreshing change from that.
Biden speaks like someone from your neighborhood. You can tell he lived in one. This is a quality he shares with Reagan. By itself that's not predictive of anything, but democrats have a tendency to speak in abstract ideas that ordinary people have a hard time connection with.
This was to be expected. But Biden needs to pick an AG who will promise the country that she will prosecute Trump to the fullest extent of the law once he is out of office.
Yeah Biden vs Ivanka? No thanks.
Status quo Biden and Copmala Harris?
What is TIPP.? i wonder what the real honest state of the race is. I would say  Trump plus 1 to biden plus 2.

I've been voting dems since 1988. Incremental change doesn't even happen. But change does happen in leaps and bounds towards the right because of a failed Blue Dog strategy that coddles corporate donors over people. We will never get "left politics" with a Biden presidency.

Good catch - I flipped thru his plan again, and he's committed to net zero by 2050. He has a target for 2025, but he never commits to what that target is. Still - I think Greens would have an easier time lobbying Biden than Trump..
. is making history as  running mate. We sat down with a  professor of women and politics to talk about the decision.   “I think Harris, no matter the outcome, will make her mark.”
What scares me a lot more is everyone's response to criticizing Biden or Harris is "GUESS YOU'RE PRO-TRUMP."  What a mess.
if i was 12 i would not make cold calls for biden and i would have sex but thats just me

And if you're like "Wait, what about the presidential race?"   That was on Super Tuesday! Here are those results:    And a big 'ol precinct map showing Biden's domination:
Already assuming that Biden will be a non-issue in 2024?
1. USPS sabotage 2. Closing polling places 3. Russian interference 4. Biden/Harris "too corporate/capitalist" 5. Biden/Harris "too leftist/progressive" 6. Neverending American capacity for idiocy 7. Kanye 8. Media’s lack of attention span  This is how Trump will get re-elected.
Yeah, I really don't follow her since I have an essential job. Her father was friends with Biden. Trump expressed nothing but contempt for Sen. McCain.  If she's ignoring those hard facts I think she needs to... Take a seat in the back and STFU She's not relevant.  But she'll try
They are excellent for showing the American public how unfit he is. They are Biden ads, in real time.
AOC will be just old enough to run in 2024, though i definitely would not expect her to. gunning for Schumer’s seat in 2022 or when he retires (or Gillibrand’s seat she ends up a Biden cabinet member) is probably her best play if she wants to stay an elected official
Rumor has it that Trump is looking to replace Pence on the GOP ticket. I’m betting this guy just made the short list.
Well it’s not like Biden is trying to unite the party with universal healthcare policy(that 70% of registered voters support). Who is at fault for being divisive? The voter or the politician?
very weird that Pence can’t get a full 10% of the electorate who are already Trump voters to say they’d vote for him over Biden. the cult is, in some ways, limited to Trump. would love to see more polls try out this Q tho
Today I saw a Bernie yard sign with a note on it saying “okay fine, Biden” and I felt that
ever since joe biden released “kiss me thru the phone” back in 1981 life just ain’t felt the same
Of course  has to keep LYING to get through another AWFUL "press conference". He KNOWS he is full of BULLSHIT. Everyone knows this. They have no answer to the awesome   She is a POWERHOUSE! She &amp; Biden will steamroll Trump &amp; Pence!!
Kamala Harris has been officiating same-sex marriages since the early 2000s and fought against Prop 8 in California. Mike Pence promotes conversion therapy and says being gay is a choice.   🗣YOU ARE NOT AN ALLY IF YOU VOTE FOR ANYONE OTHER THAN BIDEN/HARRIS 2020
Guys I have a brilliant plan. While no one’s looking, let’s swap Biden with Ed Markey! They’re both old white guys and they’re wearing masks, so no one will notice
a reminder not to panic when the republicans are up after the RNC. the bounce will show them up or even, no matter how bad their convention is. biden will almost certainly win the popular vote. eking out the electoral will be tougher.
can’t wait to vote for biden in november because that will help the 20-40 million americans who will be evicted over the next few months 🙂
Remember when AOC said the tent was too big if Biden was in it?
His election hysteria is ridiculous and drives me crazy. Did you see Claire McCaskill basically say we'll know Biden Won by 11pm on election night immediately after his we won't know for months nonsense? It was delicious!
A friend just got a text message saying, “[NAME], Bruce here from PR2020 w/ a non-partisan poll. Who do you support? (1) Trump; (2) Biden; (3) Undecided; (4) Opt-Out. REPLY for Opt-In. Thanks.”  Scam or innovation?

Top Secret : Biden learning to read again.
My opinion isn’t valid because I don’t have your education? That’s elitist. But my simple point was that the #1 goal for most dems in the primary was to get rid of trump. Many voters looked at the polls and saw Biden did the best. It’s not because people are stupid or manipulated
I get the whole "Anyone by Trump mentality", but wouldn't it be ironic if Biden\Harris won and they were somehow like way worse or even at an equal level to Trump?? Like what if A creepy old White dude named Joe and a creepy old White dude named Donald were like somewhat similar?
I agree!  Kamala is the best person Joe could have picked!  So let’s stop with the ‘she’s a woman and she’s a woman if color’.  Let’s just focus on the fact she’s the best person for VP! If Biden picked a man we wouldn’t have this discussion!
The only question is after Biden wins how fast will the GOP run away from Donald Trump and claim they never had anything to do with him?
Fits in with recent findings that voters are split over who they think will win.  The GOP downballot would really prefer if voters believed Biden would win.
Khloe gonna keep Biden honest that’s all be like I’m watching you

Those favorables in the new Fox poll show a pretty big split between Biden (+10) and Harris (+4) with Trump (-12) and Pence (-10).  (The poll has Biden leading Trump by 7)  The Harris number is only a sub-sample for part of the field period post-announcement.
You are conflating southern dem elected officials with southern dem primary voters. Their voice matters just as much as dems from blue states. We should just ignore dems in red states? Btw Biden also won most liberal blue states. If voters wanted something else they had options.
😂😂🤣🤣😭😭👇👇  Left Flips Out At Tucker Carlson For Unintentionally Mispronouncing Kamala's Name, Then Biden Does It The Next Day
My Dad parroted this to me today- until I explained election law &amp; how Nominations work. Smh. He thinks Biden did “all this” to get Harris to be Pres./the Nominee.
You won’t like to hear this but Biden consistently outperformed all other candidates in polls against Trump. There were very rational reasons to vote for Biden. Black voters weren’t manipulated by the big bad media or the DNC. They saw that Biden had the best shot at winning.
With the exception of yourself and other qualified fact-checkers, no one should be attending these 'briefings' which are just attempts to keep lying until they catch on. The press should focus on Biden/Harris and covering the truth. Stop giving free campaign time on our $
I bet the Biden/Harris campaign knew he’d try this shit, and I bet they’re ready.
They also did a 2024 GOP primary ballot test.  Pence leads the field at 31% among Republicans.  The general population chooses Romney.  (Aided largely there by Democrats/Biden voters)
It's amazing how sad and desperate Team Trump is in their lazy lies about Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Trump and his team are pathetic.
Joe Biden was very PRESIDENTIAL today!  You have tried to destroy this country for you, friends and your family personal gain!  On 11/3/2020 we elect a REAL PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN!
yes but that's where this new generation of young bloods are caught up.  Its my way or the highway.  Vs Biden, sure absolutely center.  But he knows he has to be to actually get bills past, because politics suck.  Getting elected and just shouting stuff that never passes..
Watching the President of the United States admit he opposes funding for USPS because it will hurt him politically.   Insane.  Absolutely insane.   You may not like Biden, but I hope you like him more than Trump.  Seriously, enough hot takes. We have 82 days.
Joe Biden is calling for a nationwide protective mask mandate, citing health experts’ predictions that it could save 40,000 lives from
This may backfire.  He's just pissed off the savvy young Democrats, some of whom weren't that keen on Biden.  Now they'll walk through fire to vote. -  -
No Traitor Trump you are putting lives over the economy you so desparately need to be re elected!  Well  you have lost the election already by your very actions and words!  Shutting down the USPS hurts you badly!  Vote Biden/Harris🇺🇸🇺🇸
My sister ordered door dash today &amp; the delivery drivers usually just drop the food off on the step. This time the young worker stuck around to let me know (socially distanced) they liked my #Biden yardsign &amp; are volunteering on his campaign. Ppl are energized &amp; ready for change.
How can all of you Kamala lovers just so easily look past how contradicting she is. That's not a party thing that's a her thing. She only got 2% of her parties vote and was destroying Biden who she now kisses his ass. #thirdparty

Kamala Harris is a conversation starter.  Text or call your friends and family and ask them what they think about Biden’s pick of running mate.  That way you can make sure they are showing up to vote against Tr*mp.
I mean, Biden slurs all the time though. The only difference is he would be a better president.

Your president has officially declared war on the service which people I love rely on for political reasons. You have proven yourself loyal to Trump over American citizens who need support during a pandemic, and your kind have inspired me to devote myself to Biden’s campaign.
Also, and I think this is important to note, there have only been four Boomer presidents -- Bill Clinton (born 1946), George W. Bush (1946), Barack Obama (1961), and Donald Trump (1946). Joe Biden is part of the Silent Generation.
Nah, he'll just use the Obama strategy and only hold pressers every 3 months.  But he handles the hostile media pretty well, and when he has a stroke it will be long after his second term.  Biden may have already had one.
Maybe Trump should adopt the Biden model:  only call on friendly press with pre-approved questions.  No, Trump is smart enough and courageous enough to take this shit from a hostile media on a daily basis.
I'd like to hear Biden answer ANY tough question.
Why, it's almost as if Biden's plan is really popular.
Most of the establishment democrats are in bed with pharmaceutical companies, including Joe Biden because he has been saying his whole political career he wants to cut Medicare and Medicaid and social security.
Love their claim that Biden can’t speak off script...do they just tune out all the things Trump has said off script?  Injecting bleach?  Attacks on every person who’s ever said a negative word about him?  Pandemic of NINETEEN SEVENTEEN?  Airport attacks during the revolution?
Politicians campaign where they have a chance of winning.  To do otherwise would be a waste of time and resources.  Do you think Biden will campaign in Alabama or Mississippi?  It's not a matter of caring.  It's a matter of getting to 270 electoral votes.
First, it's Aryan Nation.  Second, it's the democrats who founded the KKK and fought for segregation (Biden supported Ayran  views).  Third, the left has been screaming RACIST! at conservatives for decades as a political tactic.  Read Saul Alinsky's Rules for Radicals.
Biden is just politicizing this, he isn't actually thinking this is the right way to handle it.  No, we shouldn't mandate from the federal government.
Nobody cares what you believe you liar. Dems sure are worried about trump “not leaving after he loses”. Bet you anything the election will be contested due to mail in fraud, then they’ll just say enough is enough and try to put Biden in. Obviously they are planning on losing.
Wonders, since she’s Biden’s new assistant, if she’ll have to change his depends and wipe his ass..
I understand that POV, however, I think I’m just more optimistic. Parties move with public opinion, and public opinion on climate change action, health care, and other topics is shifting drastically. If Biden doesn’t act on his promises, I promise in 2024 I’ll be on your side.
Wonders, since she’s Biden’s new assistant, if she will have to change his depends and wipe his ass..
I personally think the way to go about it isn’t a hashtag that will fall off the trending tab by morning. I believe the way to do that is to get a man willing to change into office (Biden in this case), then use the power of our base to get change done.
Yeah but Biden can't survive 4 years of Biden.
The Trump administration got rid of a bloated team of bureaucrats, but once we knew that China and the WHO had been lying to us, in a week he put together a stronger team of medical professionals and dealt with the pandemic better than Hillary ever could.  Biden would be lost.
Nice try using the democrat talking points (aka Excuses).  Listen to Biden talk from 10 years ago and it is obvious he has lost it.  Even democrat leadership knows it. You can keep up the illusion, but only until the first debate.  Then it's GAME OVER.
Wonders since she’s become Biden’s assistant, if she will have to change his depends and wipe his ass..
All the Biden followers running to get a mask
Well, not all politicians are the same. Politicians are receptive to ideas which fit with their party. Biden was receptive to change in terms of Gay Marriage, Criminal Justice, Climate Change, and Health Care. Trump wouldn’t capitulate on any of those issues no matter what.
How many times does the Coons family need to tell you this before you fucking get it?
Why isn’t anyone talking about Tara Reade?! The woman that Biden allegedly sexually assaulted. You people confuse me some times.
Any chance Open Skies survives or resumes under a Biden presidency?
I just oppose Biden
A smart candidate doesn't care about the popular vote.  It's the electoral college that determines the winner, and that made Trump brilliant and Hillary...home.   Trumps base will walk through fire to vote this time +12M, and probably more after reasonable dems hear Biden debate.
Not that arguing with a Karen will change your gullible little deranged mind.  But when Biden steps onto the debate stage with Trump it's GAME OVER.  Then your hate will really consume you.  Have fun screaming into your pillow on Nov 4th!
It is going to be brutal listening to Biden-Harris until Nov 3rd.  If they are talking they are lying. I can't imagine having to listen to 4 years of it that will be as bad as the 8 years of BHO's lying. I am sick of it already. They are not going to do anything they say.

Do you have ANY evidence for a corruption charge? Nope, just a bunch of CNN propaganda.  Biden, however, has documented incidents of enriching his family through corrupt deals.  And you want HIM negotiating with China?  China owns the Bidens!
Biden can't remember his name without a teleprompter.  People will feel sorry for the poor old guy when Trump shreds him in the debates.  CNN will accuse Trump of Elder Abuse! But it will still be GAME OVER for Biden.
is it tooo soon to Congratulate you for winning the 2020 Presidential Election?  Biden has no chance of winning now!!  Congrats Mr. President, looking forward to more clean up, Thank you for all that you are doing to Make America Great!!

This was true of Joe Biden in 2008, and we never heard from him ever again.
I listened to your podcast,which was  thing I believe is that we need to o encourage the Biden voters to vote early, whether by mail or in person.Then their votes will be counted earlier too.
I sure hope so too. I’ve met a couple of black dudes who are normally Democrat but voting for Jo in the elections. Honestly though black people my age or so don’t even like Biden. They realize that he is not here to help us at all.
But correct. Biden is still going to get the majority vote of 90%+ but may be a point or two lower because of Harris. Where that vote is going? I have no idea.
Veteran Republican strategist  disagreed.  "I think that messaging will work," he said. "Middle America -- the moderates and the indepdendents -- are certainly not looking for an adminstration that's going to be beholden to the far left."
Black people are most definitely voting for Biden in overwhelmingly high numbers. But, I don’t think it’s going to be a few percentage points lower than usual just because of Harris.
I can understand not wanting to vote for Biden/Harris if you dislike their records. But acting without a focus on the results may still result in harm, and your intentions will provide little solace to those harmed. Effects matter more than intention, IMO.
Build Back Better. Biden 😅🤣😂
Not according to Biden.
Libertarians, OTOH are for criminal justice reform, so you bet your ass I am in a position to call Biden-Harris out for this, as well as Trump-Pence.
You do realize that you're running against *Biden*, right?
"Did Joe Biden announce his pick too quickly? Twitter discusses."

I voted for you. Thanks for all the ways you continue to fight the good fight. All in now for Biden/Harris.
The president just gave us notice we’re going to have to learn Chinese if Biden wins. It’s never too early to start learning!  加油拜登的！
Biden is going to get way more votes, including way more mail-in votes, and then Trump is going to claim that makes the results rigged and illegitimate. Can we all acknowledge this now so no one claims to be surprised later? 1/2
Sorry, but Kamala nor Biden are transphobic, I’ve done extensive research on their lgbtq stances, and I can say with 100% certainty they will protect transgender rights and appoint Supreme Court justices which fight lgbtq discrimination
Yeah, that's the main thing. It's the default call, and we'll, that's Biden in a nutshell  I'm not thrilled but not worked up either
This is where we differ, because I’m a bit more optimistic. I’m hopeful that with a different cabinet, a president that is quite liberal compared to previous ones, and public pressure from BLM, we could actually see some change. And if they don’t, Biden will be gone in 4 years.

Tulsi Gabbert wipes her ass with Kamala Harris. Harris is a true leftist suck up and is poster child for drama and for nearly destroying a justice's life with spite. She is just as dangerous as Biden, And will destroy this country, Mark my words. Tulsi has more class any day.
Kamala as Biden’s VP won’t stop the fact that you have to, for as long as you live, live with the fact that you knowingly and willingly voted for a Racist Rapist.
Very on brand for Joe Biden to be holding his phone upside down. 🤣🤣🤣
Kamala Harris was the right pick for the Biden campaign. It’s the safe pick. They didn’t overthink it. I’m thrilled to see a woman and POC on this ticket. I’m also glad republicans can’t relitigate Benghazi/Tarmac/Hillary for the trillionth time if they’d picked Susan Rice. Happy
What an awful, awful choice by Biden. In a time where criminal justice reform is so important to our country..he picks one of the few people with a worse record on it then himself...Please, someone get me  to end this #kamalaharris garbage ASAP.
#VPPick Well, now the dems will at least win California.  LOL  Harris is the pit bull they need to fight the fights Biden can't handle, which is all of them.
One thing about the Harris pick is that Biden, like any competent politician, knows that a sharp attack in a debate is part of the game, and that you don't take it personally, *especially* when you're on the same team.
Gonna be hilarious when Biden posts [insert joke name here]. People will laugh and laugh. [NOTE: DO NOT POST THIS JOKE TEMPLATE WITHOUT REVISION.]
How nice for  to finally tell Joe Biden who his running mate will be! #BidenVP

Pence locked down conservatives.  Cheney &amp; Biden locked down experience.  Duckworth...national security?
Biden is the one I have heard say those dreadful words.
#BlackLivesMatter #antifa Joe Biden has been in office over 40 years. He was Vice President for eight years. Why didn’t he get rid of the “systemic racism” then, and why would he now? You are voting for Obama again but worse basically.

Just donated an extra 25$ to Biden’s campaign. Have a good night :)
Of course, one might not expect the candidate to appearing with Biden in the same place at all. Good ol' 2020.
Yea but these riots started under Obama same with the kids being in cages. Syria's civil war was also started under Obama's watch as well. Not to mention Joe Biden wants to defund social security, Medicare and medicaid the proof is in his entire political career. Look it up.
Biden-Buttigieg, the ticket everyone expected.
Joe Biden is such a racist that he doesn’t know when he’s making a racist statement..
24. #TrumpPressConference  Says China will own this country if Biden wins.
Do you have any evidence that Trump’s policy is better for the black population that Biden’s? Biden has dozens of pages of carefully thought out antiracist policies on his website. Trump has nothing I could find. Quotes don’t matter, policy and goals do.
Pocket change for the corrupt Biden's!
He’s more delusional then Joe Biden.
This letter doesn’t advocate for a particular Black woman. We are not interchangeable! Do I want to see Black women lead? YES! Do I want Black women in positions of power? YES! But this further tokenizes the Black women Biden IS considering.Its not the solidarity they think it is
I've long believed that Biden voters are more likely to vote. Nothing has changed my mind.
If the states are so independent, then I’m sure Biden would have no impact on the unrest if he was elected.

Yup. Democrats are using social media and every other platform to censor and steer the election. That and including China and Iran with election interference helps them even more. Don’t forget Russia, they wanted Hillary and want Biden...
A vote for Biden is really a vote for Michelle.  They know that too.

Joe Biden has been saying he wants to defund social security, Medicare and Medicaid and disability his entire political career. So whats your point? How will things get any better with Joe Biden when he is just part of the problem? If you don't believe me do some research.
Lmao did you know that Joe Biden also wants to defund Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Yet you sheep still believe he will change our country for the better. Face it the two party system isn't working. Also the proof is in Joe Biden's entire political career.
Biden has no policy? Dude, check his website. He has hundreds of pages of plans and policies he would implement. I won’t continue arguing unless you can admit to basic truths of reality
Hopefully trump wins because if Joe Biden wins we will lose social security and Medicare and Medicaid because he wants to defund all 3 of them to pay for his illegal immigrants and their votes. The cartel problem will only get worse with a Democrat in office.
Whenever I hear someone calling Biden a racist, it’s always because he said something stupid. He isn’t a good speaker, and he has a stutter; however, those embarrassing moments don’t define his worldview. You’re waist deep in the water and acting like you’ve explored the ocean.
This is exactly what I’m talking about. Have you ever looked at Biden’s policy? Have you ever listened to what he wants to do without looking through a tinted lens? Have you stopped looking at the juicy snippets and looked into his current states beliefs?
Joe Biden is more corrupted than Trump will ever be. He also wants to defund social security and Medicare and Medicaid. He has been saying that for most of his political career.
Y’all talk about his deep past, but never about his recent history with racial ideologies. I wonder why I’ve never seen a Trump supporter judge Biden’s policy 🤔
Joe Biden is unfit and a terrible canidate for president.  Change my mind, oh, and you can't use the word Trump
He doesn’t have to accept the results, like we give a damn, but he WILL HAVE TO GET HIS BIG ASS UP OUT OF THE PEOPLES HOUSE! President Biden already confirmed after his inauguration the IDIOT would be drug out the WH kicking and screaming like the coward he is if he try’s that BS

He better not. Voting will be easier here than in some other places and for every Minnesota farm with a Trump sign in the front yard, there are 10,000 residents in the Twin Cities who will vote Biden.
You know it. And expect them to refuse to cooperate in any way with a Biden administration.
That is just a little pocket change for the corrupt Biden family.
I can never understand what Biden is even trying to say, and the rate times I do it’s something stupid or racist 😂. If Biden talks he will lose basically, GW2.0
At that point, they move on to.... 🌹: Oh, well if Biden isn't going to give free college to everyone making any amount of money then HE MAY AS WELL NOT EVEN DO IT.
Here you go.
They can't. And if they can, Joe Biden can fund Medicare out of Defense, so good luck.
#IntelligenceReports So Russia is working against Biden. China is working against Trump. Guess which one Trump will do something about.
Top GOP senators give Trump the Biden probe he got impeached for trying to force on Ukraine #SmartNews
Well, I don’t love either; however, at least Biden actually has a solid written plan on issues such as LGBTQ rights, Climate Change, and improving health care to some degree. When we equate Biden with Trump, we accept them as equals, when one is clearly better.
What about the guy who predicted all but one correct, including correct about trump beating Clinton and Biden now?
Joe Biden’s VP pick
Biden will be lucky to win ANY state
IKR .. Takes a lot of emotional intelligence to come up with that kind of response.  Such a great communicator, he could write for Biden.
#Election2020 Is Trump saying that Biden wants to put God on the disabled list?
Wait, are you saying that Biden is not *soooo late with his VP pick* because he *just can't decide*, but that this is actually right around the time it usually happens?
No way could Biden spell monolith or provide a definition.  Dementia Joe hasn't written a single tweet in the last year.  When he has to meet Trump on stage without a teleprompter, ear piece, or notes, it will be  GAME OVER!
I'm telling you, I have to vote for Biden, I'm not getting on the wrong side of a guy who can hurt God.
Tough piece. To be sure, we libs know that y'all be attacking Biden on Day One. It is just a political alliance of convenience now. Even the #MSNBC GOP pundit class will return to attacking tan suits-- or sunglasses very soon.
They were not drugs they retested the substance and it wasn’t drugs but they are still trying to say she resisted arrest. Crooked Sheriffs Department! They need a FBI patterns and practices investigation after Biden wins this November!
One of the reason this falls apart is that Trump -- who is an atheist, let's not pretend -- has no understanding of the language of faith. No Evangelical believes that Biden can hurt God, for God's sake.
Biden said something stupid and owned it. Who knew this was possible?
Anyhow, no, it's not good you've had to move, but if you want The Nib to not completely implode, maybe don't run cartoons that would be considered hackishly anti-Biden by Ben Garrison.
that’s just not reality. I’m sorry, but you gotta look beyond your media and social bubble and view exterior evidence. Look into Biden’s actual policy and judge it for yourself. Look into how actual socialists hate him for his middling approach. He’s not who you portray him as.
You could debate John Biden a million times, I won't vote for you.
Biden is a very, very moderate Democrat. As a progressive, I can promise you he’s not a socialist at all, and it’s unfair to disregard his policy and generalize him with truly brutal dictators who hid under the name of communism
We need Biden signs.  I can probably give out at least 30 in my little precinct in Eagan.
When I hear the cable pundits, who weren't on Joe Biden's side when these primaries started, now say such glowing things about him, I just shout "I told you so!"  He IS the perfect candidate for this election and lot of us knew that. #deadlinewhitehouse
Biden has the power to hurt God?
#Election2020 The Yo Semite and Thighland guy thinks that Joe Biden is the one who can't keep it together.
Lad, are you calling Joe Biden a fat junkie?   At this rate i wouldnt be surprised if you claimed Joe is secretly Xi Jinping in a thin-suit. Y’all are weird istg
I’m a proud gun owner who refuses to vote for you.  We own guns to protect us from a tyrannical government.  I’m sure Biden would do no worse than your Portland stunt.  If he does, that’s why we have a second amendment.
We all know you don't have the balls to debate Biden.  But please proceed with these hissy fits.  It's hilarious. #Biden2020Joe Biden-"I just voted to make gay marriage illegal"!
Hey, I just filled out my request for an absentee ballot so I can legitimately mail my vote in. You are a con artist Mr. Biden.
Unlike most potential presidents, no one knows what Biden stands for. He’s the figurehead for a shaky coalition that harbors radical views, writes     Democrats didn’t pick Mr. Biden because he’s moderate, they picked him because he’s weak
Join me in supporting Joe Biden via
So Trump campaign tweeted out mugshots of black people out on bail to scare people as though Biden will be letting out every black person in prison to terrorize white folk.  How about tweeting out pics of Trump in prison stripes?  That's where he should be.

I’m voting for Biden
Vote for Biden &amp; Kamala Harris For sure better than TRUMPster fire
It turns out that "Dr." Jill Biden is NOT a medical doctor!
The process of how Biden arrived at selecting Kamala Harris. via
How can any Roman Catholic support Biden/Harris? Outrageous support for pro-abortion candidates!!
“It’s not about your rights, it’s about your responsibilities," Biden said.  Who’s up for a nationwide mask mandate #sunrisers?
If you notice your mail has been delivered later than usual, this is done on purpose to rig the election in favor of Trump and the GOP.  Don't vote for them, vote for Biden and democrats. More better if it is progressive democrats.
Voting for Biden sucks, not voting sucks, and voting for trump is not possible  No good choices 😔
Who does Biden think he is, he isn't part of the Govt and he isn't a doctor, he's garbage!
Biden/Harris campaign offices:
Biden's not all there, he's not playing with a full deck.
Admittedly an improvement for Biden in his raw number. That being said, Biden will win MN by more than he wins WI, I believe.
SO DID BIDEN!
They can criticize her all they want but unless they want four more years of #45 they had better vote Biden/Harris.
- The so called editorial written by John Eastman is a racist letter to those who think a woman of color, born in Oakland, CA is not eligible to run w Biden. I am deeply offended that you would allow this blatant birther piece in your mag. Disgusting #BoycottNewsweek
so what, Biden and Camela will lose, so who cares/
People that he is supposed to lead. I’ve never seen a president spend so much effort into trying to divide the American people and that’s why he needs to go. This isn’t about Joe Biden, this is about the fact that the orange Cheeto puff fuck ball needs to go.
Consensus-building and ability to find middle ground were killed off by gerrymandering and unlimited campaign contributions made through anonymous shell companies.  Be great if team Biden fixed that. But entrenched, self-serving GOP &amp; Dem partisans killed off earlier efforts.
Let's ignore him a lot from now in and concentrate on president Biden and Vice President Harris.
Who will be the actual power behind Biden/Harris really running the country? That’s the true info needed. Dr Jill Biden? Chief of Staff? These concerns make US look like a crummy  dictatorship. NOT WHAT WE WANT FOR OUR NATION.
Are you ok with the fact that Joe Biden voted to make gay marriage illegal?
Trust us-Pence has plenty of material to use against Kamala.  Between her and Joe Biden they sent tens of thousands of African American males to prison needlessly.  And I want to hear her defense of Joe Biden voting to make gay marriage illegal.
Pamala-Kamala Harris wants you to join The United States of California. No more America. Liberal Fascism (Socialism) will be your government. Welcome to The Fourth Reich founded by BLM and Antifa with Harris-Biden paving the way.
Indeed. Trump wants Biden to get out in public for his friends the Russians to assassinate him. He has been provoking him (basement attacks)

Y’all think it’s a coincidence Crime Bill Biden chose Mass Incarceration Kamala? Dems will tell you Trump is a racist but look at ticket’s track record. We are screwed.
Gosh, apparently Biden needed to seek advice from Trump: "Kamala Harris is the meanest, most horrible, most disrespectful, MOST LIBERAL of anyone in the U.S. Senate, and I cannot believe that Joe Biden would pick her as his running mate."  (Trump e-mail)
So Biden like Obama is relying on record online donations. Anyone think that these are fraudulent donations using bots? Why were Obama’s and Biden’s donations so small? To avoid scrutiny. So easy to have a ton of bots make small donations using PayPal or other methods
Nothing against Biden, but can she step in for one of the debates? Would love to see her destroy Trump face to face.
Look, I took some time to think about the argument and I realized that I misunderstood you. I may not agree with you on certain things and I think some of your comments toward Biden and Harris are unwarranted, but I jumped the gun and saw what I wanted to see.
Kamala: So Biden us a racist and in your words has credible sexual harassment claims leveled against him. Why run next to him? Just like sleeping your way to the top with Willie Brown morals and integrity don’t seem to matter much. #HeelsUpHarris
I am wary about this - Biden respected a lot of others bedsides Warren - she was not a serious candidate as it needed to be a woman of color!!
The is a great speech!!  Take down the Orange man and building up America.  Biden/Harris 2020
My head just freaking exploded from Biden’s Lies!
Okay. So when Joe has to resign in 18 months due to mental health concerns, Kamala Harris will be President. In other words, Kamala Obama. I suppose China will love her as much as Joe Biden. She will be a good puppet for Leftist Elites (Globalists).
Good thing you like her since she’ll be POTUS. Biden won’t remember who she is by November.

If I were to vote it would be for Biden.  Trump is a liar and a divider.  So is Biden and he might be senile, so I might just be sitting this one out my Lloyd!!!  Minnesota will go blue I am pretty sure so I am just a human in this state
Trump or Biden tweet it to me
The rioters, looters, and arsonists who are destroying our cities are Democrats, Biden supporters.

Wow! I think we found Hunter Biden! I knew he had to surface sooner or later. #HunterBiden
There’s a lot of fundamentals (and 22% uncertainty) built in.  Someone else pointed out that as the election gets closer, if things remain the same, Biden’s chances will increase.  If that’s true, I can understand why the model is where it is right now.
You don’t even know how out of touch you are. You are the ugly past. Biden-Harris is the future.
So all Trump campaign has is name calling.  All they have otherwise they'd have to bash policies the majority of Americans favor.  Oh, so they'll go with extreme policies that Biden/Harris don't even believe in.  Name call &amp; scare ppl.  I'm going to hate the next 80+ days.

Biden won't be elected, Trump doesn't lose
Has Biden recently turned Catholic? I’m curious as to why it’s trending now when he’s probably been a catholic this whole time? It’s just political season so anything goes I guess, I’m surely excited to vote now. 😒
Think of it this way, Nate’s model has Biden winning 93% of the time if the election were held today, Elliot’s is at 88%.  Slight variation.
Here we go! So happy that VP Biden picked Kamala Harris! I am energized!
Joe Biden has a racism problem alright - but he's going to beat it in November.
Indeed. Biden is "American centre" in my opinion, which American left is basically actually centre, so things are all backwards ;-;
I want to start by saying I'm not for Biden/Harris  However, if it is just a comparison of "lesser of two evils", yea Biden/Harris is probably better than Trump/Pence. But we will still be in a shit place with Biden/Harris in place
A great and winning team Biden- Harris 2020!!
I am meh but still going to vote Biden
Biden isn't all there.
The Biden-Harris Ticket
China will provide massive vaccines to the USA as soon as Biden gets elected this Nov
If you are reading this  stay clear of Biden’s nursing home.  #CuomoKilledGrandma
#CuomoKilledGrandma Better run Biden ...he’s after your age bracket!!!
Lots and lots of grandmas and grandpas.  Come to think of it Biden should be terrified around this crowd.      stay away from Joe’s nursing home dammit!!!!
Nice try, At least Trump has better taste  than Biden.  #TaraReade.  Yuck.  Biden should pay her btw .
Trump in a landslide. Anyone with a brain knows that. There aren’t enough stolen votes to pull that off for Biden
Everyone, even Republicans, are getting sick of what the pandemic has done to them.  Trump's done nothing for them, but give them crumbs.  Vote for Biden for this madness to be better.  If you don't, I can assure you this will continue for even longer.

And the Biden family too got rich, hmm hows Hunter and his crack pipe doin’ nowadays.
STRONG TICKET. I CANNOT BLV KANYE IS.STILL RUNNING, SAYING HE’L TAKE VOTES FROM BIDEN
Biden was a senator for a long time and is known as a super genial, get along guy. He’s going to want to work with the other side and make deals. What Trump should have done.
Ahole Chuck Todd did say something today that resonated with me. He said that Biden's pick of Harris also validated all the women who were considered for VP. A great day for women and for our nation.
Also, I think many of Biden's cabinet positions should be filled ASAP. Put a killer team together to take down Trump and begin the process of recreating the American Dream with decency and equality for everyone!
I guess she no longer believes Biden’s accusers
By the end of January with Biden/Harris there will be....for the good of the nation
All the Sander voters that vote Biden will get nothing they hoped for. This is all a set up from top Dems. You can bank that!
I never said I was for Trump? What I said is I thought Biden would pick Rice and the Dems would move Biden out and Harris would be VP. NOW I just say swap them around. I do like any one of these lady’s more than Biden. He will never make it through his 1st year.
democrats are so fucking stupid as usual.  I’ll vote for biden because he’s not trump- but kamala is hillary level bad.  idiots.

Kamala Harris chosen as the running mate. This is problematic given her voting record and it is not progressive ticket. via
Every time Trump or surrogate talks about Biden gaffes they should just play Trump talking about 1917 flu and it ended WW II.
Turned to Fox just to see what they were saying. Still trashing Biden so quickly switched to CNN. Where is Nicole Wallace? I wanted to see her today.
Kamala Harris is Joe Biden's running mate: Live updates. Yes!!! #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Biden made the right choice asking Harris to be his running mate. Her debates with Pence should be good.
Congratulations!!!  I am excited to vote for Biden/Harris!!!
Biden has picked Harris to be his VP. This ticket will be responsible for putting more black folks in chains than pre civil war
Biden/Harris 2020!  I'm feeling very positive! :)
Good Choice. Hopefully when Biden wins Sally Yates for AG and Susan Rice as SOS, have Schumer step aside and make Warren Senate Majority Leader. Let's put some women in charge for a change. It seems to work well in other countries.
Great pick!!!  Can't wait to vote for Biden/Harris!!!!!  #BlueWave
Biden-Harris for the win!!!??!
Biden picks Kamala Harris for VP running mate.  better get ready! #snl
Didn't Harris pretty much accuse Biden of being a racist at one of the Dem debates?
YES!! Joe Biden here. Big news: I've chosen Kamala Harris as my running mate. Together, with you, we're going to beat Trump. #KamalaHarrisForVP
If the pick is truly in, Biden should make the announcement ASAP. The longer he waits, the greater the probability that the VP choice will be leaked.
Rice will make history 1st woman VP and President and wait! history yet again A WOMAN PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT RUNNING THE UNITED STATES. PRESIDENT RICE AND VP HARRIS. this is already the setup if Biden wins and the Dems will close there eyes to Biden family Ukraine deals.
Rice will make history 1st woman VP and President and wait! history yet again A WOMAN PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT RUNNING THE UNITED STATES. PRESIDENT RICE AND VP HARRIS. this is already the setup if Biden wins and the Dems will close there eyes to Biden family Ukraine deals.
A vote for Biden is a vote for PRESIDENT RICE and VP to be announced at later date maybe Harris. Rice will be your president after the Dem's declare Biden unfit in his first year, Rep can't argue against it because they have been saying his unfit this hole time.
It's almost like Trump is trying lose by even more than he already is among female voters....
Rice would be the best pick for Biden. And Rice will be your president after the Dem's declare Biden unfit in his first year, Rep can't argue against it because they have been saying his unfit this hole time.PRESIDENT RICE VP to be announced at later date maybe Harris
They would be right! and Rice would be the best pick for Biden. And Rice will be your president after the Dem's declare Biden unfit in his first year, Rep can't argue against it because they have been saying his unfit this hole time.PRESIDENT RICE VP to be announced at later date
Her calling out biden was warranted. That’s the one good thing she did.
Well said. Biden has to pick a VP that will work with him, not the " most popular dance partner".
Just one of the reasons this #nurse is voting for #Biden in Novemember. #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica
Trump doesn't lose, so whoever Biden picks as VP is irrelevant.
Children Are Not Immune
Umm that was Obama and Biden.
But if Biden picks the wrong VP, amiright?
Joe Biden as a Muppet? Now there’s an idea! Thank you Raymond Arroyo on Laura Ingraham. #FoxNews
Quite easy to see that Kamala “Heels Up” Harris was promised a SCOTUS seat should Biden win. Even more reason to reject Biden if you still needed one.
Do his people really not tell him it’s 1918 not ‘17? Understand that happening one time. We all misspeak. But it’s every dang time. Biden makes an error and fixes it. This guy. Ugh. Is his staff so afraid of his wrath they’re willing to let him embarrass himself over and over?
He promised a woman. We’re getting a woman. Pete is trending because, I believe there was a chartered flight from South Bend to Biden’s regional airport (because, you know, #ElectionTwitter is 👀). Secretary of State offer?
It’s over for Biden.
Lol. Why are liberals so willing to believe anything.   Maybe it’s Putin flying in to conspire with Biden...oh wait, only an uneducated liberal would think that.
Can a reporter ask him where he went to church this weekend and tell him where Biden went?
If they continue to give Trump an hour everyday to basically give a campaign speech they need to give Biden equal time.  Trump just lies and nobody can correct him in realtime.
Donny says Biden will hurt god. Did I miss the part where Joe collected all the Infinity Stones?
Who cares if they can do the job.....just make sure it’s a soul sista! Biden is weak he will wilt I’m sure
The only man I would accept as Biden’s running mate tbh
I read someone’s comment that said he’s probably calling everyone in and giving them a face-to-face “Thanks for your participation. It’s not you” talk ..   Sounds like something Biden would do ...
The media is giving Biden a pass for his cognitive decline and his obvious racist point of view.
I DON'T CARE who it is. I'm voting Biden period full stop. Trump is a cancer that needs to go. ❤
Biden’s Choice
Only vote for Biden
After the election the Covid hoax will end, and Biden and the DemocRATs will scamper back into their rat holes.
Biden and Trump are not the best our country has to offer.  There are other options and we NEED to acknowledge them to break this broken two-party system.  #LetHerSpeak
Biden sold our manufacturing to the Chinese, the same country that caused the DemocRATS to scare our country into shutting down!1
If you support Trump, please unfollow me. Seriously...I pointed out on a thread (on FB) about Biden having a stutter (aka a disability) and someone used the "laugh" emoji. Really??  REALLY?  Deplorable much?
So Biden comes out of his basement for church and grieving for those lost. Trump comes out of bunker for ego trips and golf. No brainer who the better man is here.
60-40 is actually really good for Democrats in Hartland (I know, I know...yard signs don’t translate to votes). Looks like Trump won 61-32 in ‘16. Honestly, I wouldn’t expect to see any Biden signs out there.
Ok this might be the level of tweet I can expect Biden to have actually sent
Biden takes orders from AOC, #PuppetJoe
Biden claims that Black people are all alike, just more proof that #RacistJoe is racist.
Biden and Obama raided Medicare to pay for a failed program called “Obamacare.” They cheated us! This program was supposed to bring down healthcare costs for all American citizens. That’s one of the most infamous lies of the century!
Trump sets the debate rules, not Biden.
I heard them dissecting Biden's gaffe. I had to shut it off. Yesterday, Trump said he created an executive order to force insurance to cover pre existing conditions; something the ACA already does, but they're focusing on a Biden misstatement, already explained &amp; apologized for.
I’d pay thousands of dollars for a front row seat at the Bible quiz contest between Joe Biden and Donald Trump! 😂 #TrumpIsNotAChristian #TrumpIsDefinitelyNotEvangelical #SexWithPornStarsIsNotChristian
Joe Biden does not support defunding the  police you dummy
Here’s a new one. My niece said her FIL sent a message to my niece’s daughter, saying that if she voted for Biden, he’d disinherit her. She’ll be a first time voter. She told him to go ahead and do it! 🤣🥰 Proud of her!
“You’re not Black if you don’t vote for me.” I don’t know about anyone else, but I would never let Joe Biden define me no matter what color I am. A 47-year political failure like Joe “China” Biden, has no game whatsoever. Accept maybe making his family rich on taxpayer time.
Thank you.  I was just going to tweet how this is a further move to dictatorship if EO is allowed to go forward.  If, as I hope, Trump is not re-elected, Biden is going to have a real task in putting the Constitution back together from the shredder.
I never seen those quotes man. Guess I should've googled all the racist shit Biden spewed beforehand huh? My bad
😂😂😂😂😂 That’s super cute. You actually think Biden has any say in who he chooses.
What, you think Biden has a solution? Let's hear it!
Peter doocy will be VP running mate.  Biden-Doocy 2020.
Oh please! ODNI has identified Ukrainian Derkach as working with Russia to disrupt the election to elect Trump. You are accepting false information from Derkach to smear Biden in your Senate Committee. Not hard to figure out where you loyalties really lie.
Pray to God Joe Biden wins and we take back the Senate. We'll have to rebuild the State Department and our intelligence agencies. Who knows how many Russian assets are now in the CIA thanks to Trump?
Exactly. Most VP choices are announced just prior to the Convention.  This woman could be President at some point. If they go through rigorous vetting, all the better. A VP is a partner in governance. Regardless of our fave, Biden will need to work w her. It is his call.
Or China is backing up Dumpty's claim that a Biden win means being in cahoots with China, making Biden look corrupt. This is a Through The Looking Glass world now.
Biden isn’t gonna make it-stop obfuscating
This guy is going to make Biden seem out of it?
What’s your plan? Gonna sleep with Joe to make it to the top. Seems to have worked well for you so far. Too bad Biden likes them much younger.
I know whatsboutism is a losing game, but my son and I were saying tonight: imagine if Trump had said one of the things about black people that Biden says regularly.  The media would 24/7 bear Trump to a pulp.
No cozy bear. It's quite alive and well.
To tell you the truth, I think that Biden is too far gone to win. My concern is losing the House and Senate.
Biden's plan is the Green New Deal, which is unacceptable, face it, Biden is a loser!
How insulting and condescending to #BlackLivesMatter that the GOP believes helping #Kanye get on ballots will lure black voters to vote for him instead of #Biden.  Act of desperation for sure.
If Twitter calls out fake information then why doesn’t this get flagged as a lie because Biden couldn’t possible send a tweet.  His handlers should have to admit authorship to make this a true tweet.
Stolen from brilliant  :   Joe Biden: “just pick any black woman.  They all think and act the same anyway”.
As Biden would say cmon man. You really think you just thought of that? 😳
Who gives a fuck what these jackass Sanders supporters want! They will stay in their place and vote Biden regardless of who his VP is! Sit down and shut the fuck up Bernie supporters! 😎✊🏾👊🏾🙇🏽‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️😂🤣🖕🏾🖕🏾🖕🏾🖕🏾🖕🏾
Biden wants to stop all oil exploration drilling, fracking, and wants to shut down coal power plants. The guy is a clown!
Exactly. I am convinced the "pick is in".  It would be a glorious weekend for many if Biden made his pick known today.
Biden isn't worthy of anyone's vote!
Are we afraid of what the tRump camp might say about Rice? Biden will choose the best woman for VP....period!
Great strategy: Biden’s supporters are approving Trump BEFORE 03 Nov...
Omg she just throws out my thoughts cause I have maga in my bio. Why y’all do that? It’s not like I throw out your thoughts cause u a Biden supported. I actually listen to what u gotta say. Why everyone do this
The strategy will be ready after this Nov 3rd when Joe Biden gets elected
Biden's done for, good riddance.
Biden needs to choose a fucking capable adult that won't sell out the country for more money. It's not difficult. #VoteBiden
I mean - what the actual fk?  If  doesn’t make this into an ad overnight, with big $ as drops in major urban areas - he doesn’t want to win.  Easy tag lane. “Joe Biden:  he thinks and says all blacks think the same on every issue”
Never Trump =always Biden and whoever his VP is - soon to be leader of free world and largest economy in the world.  It’s just that simple.
Biden is portrayed as a familiar face and reliable statesman in contrast with the volatile Trump. In reality, he promises to be the most liberal president in history, writes   via
Have to retweet just because the Right gets its jollies from Biden gaffes
Maybe he should go to Thigh land.  What kind of moron continues to try to say Biden is some kind of gaffe machine when Trump is just walking around with his pants around his ankles every day?
You’ve actively listened to trump for the past 4 years and are at a loss at what comes out of BIDEN’S mouth??
Biden's out to lunch, gone!
We had a family member who exhibited these same behaviors. I would guess Joe Biden is about 24 months from being disabled by Dementia.
BBC News - US election 2020: Trump says opponent Biden will 'hurt God'    JP: God doesn't need Trump to defend Him or His Word
This attempt by GOP operatives to get Kanye on the ballot to dilute the Biden vote is so reprehensible on 2 counts. It smacks of demeaning, racist assumptions about Black voters, &amp; manipulates &amp; exploits a person who is in the midst of a recently disclosed mental health crisis.Joe Biden-"I just voted to make gay marriage illegal"!
Hey, I just filled out my request for an absentee ballot so I can legitimately mail my vote in. You are a con artist Mr. Biden.
Unlike most potential presidents, no one knows what Biden stands for. He’s the figurehead for a shaky coalition that harbors radical views, writes     Democrats didn’t pick Mr. Biden because he’s moderate, they picked him because he’s weak
Join me in supporting Joe Biden via
So Trump campaign tweeted out mugshots of black people out on bail to scare people as though Biden will be letting out every black person in prison to terrorize white folk.  How about tweeting out pics of Trump in prison stripes?  That's where he should be.
Vote for Biden &amp; Kamala Harris For sure better than TRUMPster fire
It turns out that "Dr." Jill Biden is NOT a medical doctor!
How can any Roman Catholic support Biden/Harris? Outrageous support for pro-abortion candidates!!
Virginia mayor urged to resign after saying Biden picked 'Aunt Jemima as his VP'  vía
If you notice your mail has been delivered later than usual, this is done on purpose to rig the election in favor of Trump and the GOP.  Don't vote for them, vote for Biden and democrats. More better if it is progressive democrats.
Voting for Biden sucks, not voting sucks, and voting for trump is not possible  No good choices 😔
Who does Biden think he is, he isn't part of the Govt and he isn't a doctor, he's garbage!
Biden's not all there, he's not playing with a full deck.
SO DID BIDEN!
They can criticize her all they want but unless they want four more years of #45 they had better vote Biden/Harris.
so what, Biden and Camela will lose, so who cares/
People that he is supposed to lead. I’ve never seen a president spend so much effort into trying to divide the American people and that’s why he needs to go. This isn’t about Joe Biden, this is about the fact that the orange Cheeto puff fuck ball needs to go.
Consensus-building and ability to find middle ground were killed off by gerrymandering and unlimited campaign contributions made through anonymous shell companies.  Be great if team Biden fixed that. But entrenched, self-serving GOP &amp; Dem partisans killed off earlier efforts.
Who will be the actual power behind Biden/Harris really running the country? That’s the true info needed. Dr Jill Biden? Chief of Staff? These concerns make US look like a crummy  dictatorship. NOT WHAT WE WANT FOR OUR NATION.
Are you ok with the fact that Joe Biden voted to make gay marriage illegal?
Trust us-Pence has plenty of material to use against Kamala.  Between her and Joe Biden they sent tens of thousands of African American males to prison needlessly.  And I want to hear her defense of Joe Biden voting to make gay marriage illegal.
Biden names Kamala as his VP, now Black Americans are tweeting about how Obama didn't do anything for the black community!  Rest abeg

Y’all think it’s a coincidence Crime Bill Biden chose Mass Incarceration Kamala? Dems will tell you Trump is a racist but look at ticket’s track record. We are screwed.
Gosh, apparently Biden needed to seek advice from Trump: "Kamala Harris is the meanest, most horrible, most disrespectful, MOST LIBERAL of anyone in the U.S. Senate, and I cannot believe that Joe Biden would pick her as his running mate."  (Trump e-mail)
If Biden wins, get ready for Trump to punish America
So Biden like Obama is relying on record online donations. Anyone think that these are fraudulent donations using bots? Why were Obama’s and Biden’s donations so small? To avoid scrutiny. So easy to have a ton of bots make small donations using PayPal or other methods
Joe Biden is a stanch Catholic. Educate yourself.
Nothing against Biden, but can she step in for one of the debates? Would love to see her destroy Trump face to face.
Kamala: So Biden us a racist and in your words has credible sexual harassment claims leveled against him. Why run next to him? Just like sleeping your way to the top with Willie Brown morals and integrity don’t seem to matter much. #HeelsUpHarris
My head just freaking exploded from Biden’s Lies!
Okay. So when Joe has to resign in 18 months due to mental health concerns, Kamala Harris will be President. In other words, Kamala Obama. I suppose China will love her as much as Joe Biden. She will be a good puppet for Leftist Elites (Globalists).

If I were to vote it would be for Biden.  Trump is a liar and a divider.  So is Biden and he might be senile, so I might just be sitting this one out my Lloyd!!!  Minnesota will go blue I am pretty sure so I am just a human in this state
Indeed, Sad part about people saying vote for Biden is that they’re forced to say it because he’s the only other candidate to vote for lol we’re fucked either way. 😞
Politics are poisonous.   They will have you arguing with your friends and family over 2 candidates that don’t give 2 fucks about us. Ain’t that crazy? Poc are arguing over Trump and Biden... 🤦🏽‍♂️ so this where we at huh
The rioters, looters, and arsonists who are destroying our cities are Democrats, Biden supporters.

Wow! I think we found Hunter Biden! I knew he had to surface sooner or later. #HunterBiden
So all Trump campaign has is name calling.  All they have otherwise they'd have to bash policies the majority of Americans favor.  Oh, so they'll go with extreme policies that Biden/Harris don't even believe in.  Name call &amp; scare ppl.  I'm going to hate the next 80+ days.

Biden won't be elected, Trump doesn't lose
I am done responding. I'm sick of you trying to say "you think/do this horrible thing" when I clearly don't. I never said the fight ends when Biden is elected
no one in this convo is saying you should be grateful for the LGBTQ+ situation in the US right now. It's still bad. We're saying that it's better than it was 40 years ago and could get WORSE under Trump, while it won't under Biden
I simply think getting Trump out should be top priority. Then young people can start to put pressure on Biden and the Dem establishment
idk where in this argument you got the idea that this is "fun" for me? I'm sorry about the situation you're in. I understand that I have very little skin in the game (i'm a white guy). I just see what Trump is doing and know that four years of Biden would be not as bad
Has Biden recently turned Catholic? I’m curious as to why it’s trending now when he’s probably been a catholic this whole time? It’s just political season so anything goes I guess, I’m surely excited to vote now. 😒
And if Hillary had won in 2016 Biden probably wouldn't have felt the need to run this year. Good job!
i'd call "we need to elect Biden because Trump is worse" pragmatism
and mfers like you are the reason Trump won in 2016, no offense. Look at how all of you people abstaining did in the next election cycle. No more progressive but at least we have Biden!
In no way do I enjoy the fact that Biden is the nominee. I simply understand that 4 more years of Trump would be much worse than that of Biden
"Hey guys maybe we should finally let black people vote" is to the left of "Hey we need to break down systemic racism" I guess? And that's not Biden i'm quoting but the main line of the Democratic party, whether or not it's older members actually mean what they say
Joe Biden has a racism problem alright - but he's going to beat it in November.
I’m attending Joe Biden for President’s event, “Join Seniors for Biden” – sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
my point is that you're ignoring the actual difference in their political stances. Biden may very well be a rapist. It sucks that the Democrats forced him on us. But to say Biden as a presidential candidate and Trump as a presidential candidate are the same thing IS ridiculous
You're reaching Trump supporter levels of simplification here. I very much dislike Biden. I wish Bernie (or even Warren) was the nominee but to ignore all the differences between Biden and Trump's platform and just say they're both equal "racist rapists" is ridiculous
Indeed. Biden is "American centre" in my opinion, which American left is basically actually centre, so things are all backwards ;-;
I want to start by saying I'm not for Biden/Harris  However, if it is just a comparison of "lesser of two evils", yea Biden/Harris is probably better than Trump/Pence. But we will still be in a shit place with Biden/Harris in place
Biden isn't all there.
The Biden-Harris Ticket
Trump in a landslide. Anyone with a brain knows that. There aren’t enough stolen votes to pull that off for Biden
Everyone, even Republicans, are getting sick of what the pandemic has done to them.  Trump's done nothing for them, but give them crumbs.  Vote for Biden for this madness to be better.  If you don't, I can assure you this will continue for even longer.

And the Biden family too got rich, hmm hows Hunter and his crack pipe doin’ nowadays.
STRONG TICKET. I CANNOT BLV KANYE IS.STILL RUNNING, SAYING HE’L TAKE VOTES FROM BIDEN
Biden was a senator for a long time and is known as a super genial, get along guy. He’s going to want to work with the other side and make deals. What Trump should have done.
Ahole Chuck Todd did say something today that resonated with me. He said that Biden's pick of Harris also validated all the women who were considered for VP. A great day for women and for our nation.
is voting for joe Biden strictly for kampala Harris
Also, I think many of Biden's cabinet positions should be filled ASAP. Put a killer team together to take down Trump and begin the process of recreating the American Dream with decency and equality for everyone!
I guess she no longer believes Biden’s accusers
By the end of January with Biden/Harris there will be....for the good of the nation
All the Sander voters that vote Biden will get nothing they hoped for. This is all a set up from top Dems. You can bank that!
I never said I was for Trump? What I said is I thought Biden would pick Rice and the Dems would move Biden out and Harris would be VP. NOW I just say swap them around. I do like any one of these lady’s more than Biden. He will never make it through his 1st year.

Every time Trump or surrogate talks about Biden gaffes they should just play Trump talking about 1917 flu and it ended WW II.
The only presidential candidate we were ever globally comfortably voting for was Obama. Them days are over with. Don’t just expect poc to pick between biden &amp; trump, it’s all fucked up.
Kamala Harris is Joe Biden's running mate: Live updates. Yes!!! #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Congratulations!!!  I am excited to vote for Biden/Harris!!!
I really don’t like Biden or Kamala Harris but I hate trump lol
Biden has picked Harris to be his VP. This ticket will be responsible for putting more black folks in chains than pre civil war
Great pick!!!  Can't wait to vote for Biden/Harris!!!!!  #BlueWave
Biden-Harris for the win!!!??!
Biden picks Kamala Harris for VP running mate.  better get ready! #snl
Didn't Harris pretty much accuse Biden of being a racist at one of the Dem debates?
Rice will make history 1st woman VP and President and wait! history yet again A WOMAN PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT RUNNING THE UNITED STATES. PRESIDENT RICE AND VP HARRIS. this is already the setup if Biden wins and the Dems will close there eyes to Biden family Ukraine deals.
Rice will make history 1st woman VP and President and wait! history yet again A WOMAN PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT RUNNING THE UNITED STATES. PRESIDENT RICE AND VP HARRIS. this is already the setup if Biden wins and the Dems will close there eyes to Biden family Ukraine deals.
A vote for Biden is a vote for PRESIDENT RICE and VP to be announced at later date maybe Harris. Rice will be your president after the Dem's declare Biden unfit in his first year, Rep can't argue against it because they have been saying his unfit this hole time.
It's almost like Trump is trying lose by even more than he already is among female voters....
Rice would be the best pick for Biden. And Rice will be your president after the Dem's declare Biden unfit in his first year, Rep can't argue against it because they have been saying his unfit this hole time.PRESIDENT RICE VP to be announced at later date maybe Harris

Just one of the reasons this #nurse is voting for #Biden in Novemember. #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica
That sounds like a Trump campaign ad. "This is the America Joe Biden wants!"
Trump doesn't lose, so whoever Biden picks as VP is irrelevant.
Children Are Not Immune
Umm that was Obama and Biden.
Joe Biden as a Muppet? Now there’s an idea! Thank you Raymond Arroyo on Laura Ingraham. #FoxNews
Quite easy to see that Kamala “Heels Up” Harris was promised a SCOTUS seat should Biden win. Even more reason to reject Biden if you still needed one.
Do his people really not tell him it’s 1918 not ‘17? Understand that happening one time. We all misspeak. But it’s every dang time. Biden makes an error and fixes it. This guy. Ugh. Is his staff so afraid of his wrath they’re willing to let him embarrass himself over and over?
It’s over for Biden.
Can a reporter ask him where he went to church this weekend and tell him where Biden went?
Donny says Biden will hurt god. Did I miss the part where Joe collected all the Infinity Stones?
Who cares if they can do the job.....just make sure it’s a soul sista! Biden is weak he will wilt I’m sure
Joe Biden owns Fox News reporter during morning bike ride
I read someone’s comment that said he’s probably calling everyone in and giving them a face-to-face “Thanks for your participation. It’s not you” talk ..   Sounds like something Biden would do ...
The media is giving Biden a pass for his cognitive decline and his obvious racist point of view.
Biden’s Choice
After the election the Covid hoax will end, and Biden and the DemocRATs will scamper back into their rat holes.
Biden and Trump are not the best our country has to offer.  There are other options and we NEED to acknowledge them to break this broken two-party system.  #LetHerSpeak
Biden sold our manufacturing to the Chinese, the same country that caused the DemocRATS to scare our country into shutting down!1
So Biden comes out of his basement for church and grieving for those lost. Trump comes out of bunker for ego trips and golf. No brainer who the better man is here.
Biden takes orders from AOC, #PuppetJoe
Biden claims that Black people are all alike, just more proof that #RacistJoe is racist.
You are absolutely right his run for the office is just a ploy just ignore him and vote for Biden
Biden and Obama raided Medicare to pay for a failed program called “Obamacare.” They cheated us! This program was supposed to bring down healthcare costs for all American citizens. That’s one of the most infamous lies of the century!
Trump sets the debate rules, not Biden.
I heard them dissecting Biden's gaffe. I had to shut it off. Yesterday, Trump said he created an executive order to force insurance to cover pre existing conditions; something the ACA already does, but they're focusing on a Biden misstatement, already explained &amp; apologized for.
I’d pay thousands of dollars for a front row seat at the Bible quiz contest between Joe Biden and Donald Trump! 😂 #TrumpIsNotAChristian #TrumpIsDefinitelyNotEvangelical #SexWithPornStarsIsNotChristian
Joe Biden does not support defunding the  police you dummy
“You’re not Black if you don’t vote for me.” I don’t know about anyone else, but I would never let Joe Biden define me no matter what color I am. A 47-year political failure like Joe “China” Biden, has no game whatsoever. Accept maybe making his family rich on taxpayer time.
Thank you.  I was just going to tweet how this is a further move to dictatorship if EO is allowed to go forward.  If, as I hope, Trump is not re-elected, Biden is going to have a real task in putting the Constitution back together from the shredder.
I never seen those quotes man. Guess I should've googled all the racist shit Biden spewed beforehand huh? My bad
What, you think Biden has a solution? Let's hear it!
Oh please! ODNI has identified Ukrainian Derkach as working with Russia to disrupt the election to elect Trump. You are accepting false information from Derkach to smear Biden in your Senate Committee. Not hard to figure out where you loyalties really lie.
Biden isn’t gonna make it-stop obfuscating
This guy is going to make Biden seem out of it?
What’s your plan? Gonna sleep with Joe to make it to the top. Seems to have worked well for you so far. Too bad Biden likes them much younger.
I know whatsboutism is a losing game, but my son and I were saying tonight: imagine if Trump had said one of the things about black people that Biden says regularly.  The media would 24/7 bear Trump to a pulp.
No cozy bear. It's quite alive and well.
To tell you the truth, I think that Biden is too far gone to win. My concern is losing the House and Senate.
Biden's plan is the Green New Deal, which is unacceptable, face it, Biden is a loser!
How insulting and condescending to #BlackLivesMatter that the GOP believes helping #Kanye get on ballots will lure black voters to vote for him instead of #Biden.  Act of desperation for sure.

Kanye West should be ashamed to support a xenophobic racists! He evidently believe in the kkk theories that God made them superior to all others! That is absolutely  Asinine! He supposed to be a preacher_Really!?
Biden wants to stop all oil exploration drilling, fracking, and wants to shut down coal power plants. The guy is a clown!
Biden isn't worthy of anyone's vote!
Biden's done for, good riddance.
Biden needs to choose a fucking capable adult that won't sell out the country for more money. It's not difficult. #VoteBiden

Biden is against GOD now? I bet he knows a scripture from the Bible, unlike Orange Face, gets more insane everyday.
Seeing VP Biden in action will change a lot of minds!
Good platform for Biden imo
Someone should remind him of that pic of Joe Biden in a church, praying, that his campaign doctored.
yeah kinda funny - all Trumps ads misuse Biden photos where he's actually PRAYING. I've never seen this clown bow his head in prayer.  Yet I still know some evangelicals that think there was a prophecy  saying Trump was called by God to the WH.  Not by MY God that's for sure...
Joe Biden is a modest candidate with modest goals:  1: sell a quality platform to swing moderate Rs 2: drain the world's oceans so we can find and kill godIt’s closed in the public and I hear it’s for him to talk shit about Biden and unemployment....
Live in Mankato.  You remember where that is I’m sure.  I sell seed, fert, and chemy to farmers.  Have you done polls on the group you came from?   Guess what, they will vote #Trump2020.  There’s not a single Biden sign anywhere south of Minneapolis.  #FarmersAndRanchersForTrump
"Every single American should be wearing a mask when they’re outside for the next three months at a minimum," Biden said.
yes, biden is also a terrible candidate but unfortunately we have to pick the lesser of two evils. even though these 4 years won’t be great, use your voice. it will change the future of our country. #SettleForBiden
biden is also a terrible candidate but we have to settle for the lesser of two evils, please use your voice.
This sounds a lot more like something that would happen to Biden than President Trump
My Minnesota Morning Glory Vines  give me splendid beautiful blossoms every morning! There is glory every morning with hope in my heart for a Biden-Harris administration 💜
It gets weirder when you consider the number of times I’ve seen in the past 24 hours biden and harris being described as center right.
Democrats applaud, Republicans blast Biden’s choice for V-P running mate
Democrats applaud, Republicans blast Biden’s choice for V-P running mate
If you vote for Biden/Harris your voting for #Marism
Praise God for Kamala Harris and Joe Biden and a new beginning restoring everything Trump has destroyed. Vote blue!
you must be happy with Biden’s pick, no? I am.
Was never comfortable with Biden in the first place and most people shouldn’t have been. Literally wayyyyy too many videos of him sniffing/touching children. Not to mention the fact that he can barely speak sentences these days without looking like he was having a stroke 🥴
So all Biden fans voting 3rd party now or they gonna hop on the trump train? Such a terrible vp pick for “Democrats” basically sinching a Trump win it looks like.
I travel a bunch all over Southern Mn, not one Biden sign ever seen!   For all those liberal wack jobs and BLM supporters, the suppliers of your food #americanfarmers are supporting
I’m enjoying seeing/hearing the pure joy &amp; optimism of Black women over Biden’s choice. Bernie Bros, if you can’t share that optimism &amp; joy, then try sitting this one out. I promise an unspoken (untweeted) thought won’t kill you.
The most annoying thing about today is that there is no Biden/Harris baseball caps in the official store as that’s the item I want the most right now.
That was based on that clip.. how she talked about the bus... and reminded Biden of his past. That clip is literally the first time I have seen her. I have no idea of her or her policies.
I heard both Biden &amp; Harris are radical left. Are you suggesting I’ve been misinformed?
1. This provides a stark difference between Biden &amp; the GOP candidate. Biden doesn’t oust folks just because they criticize him. 2. This is sexist because we don’t judge men by their likeability. If we did, then we would say that the GOP candidate has a likeability problem.
From 2017?? Do you know what Biden has said in the last week😜😜
I know this is far from the best option, but. We can survive four years of Biden. We cannot survive another four years of Trump. Please vote.
Congrats VP Kamala Harris. I knew it was going to be you! I'm so happy! Please don't forget the indigenous people of America in your role as VP and also remind the soon to be President Biden also of the indigenous peoples' treaty rights. I am giddy with excitement.!
Check out the Biden 2020 boat parade!
Biden/Harris works for me. But then anything other than Tr*mp/P*nce would’ve worked for me.
Would have voted for Biden as long as he didn’t pick Pence for a running mate. However, THIS actually makes me EXCITED!!!
Biden picked Kamala Harris for VP!!
BREAKING: CBS News reports former VP Joe Biden and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee has chosen California Senator and former presidential candidate Kamala Harris has his running mate.
Biden/Harris  Trump/Pence  The race is set
Democrats close to the campaign say an announcement is imminent, and could come today
Good reason right there to not vote for Biden!  Fauci needs to go!!
I can't believe Joe Biden picked Oprah Winfrey for his running mate!!!
FYI there are people crazy enough to think Biden will choose her.
Because Trump is a young buck.Trump is 74 and Biden is 77. They are both old and both had speaking difficulties. If you bash one you should also bash the other one for their faults.
2020 Election predictions.. Joe Biden will probably win cuz of how incompetent Trump has been in handling both Covid and the Protests, Trump would probably reject the election results, the Dems won’t have it and the Republicans will just sit back and analyze/commentate as usual.
Like if you think its weird that Biden hasn’t announced a VP yet, that’s probably why.
The great thing is that you can both vote and do direct action and a Biden presidency will make direct action easier than a Trump presidency.
At this point I’m fine with the next president having dimentia. Doesn’t even have to be Biden, just give us a random person from a nursing home, idc.
At this point Biden could pick a homeless woman or man and people would still be okay with it. They would still vote for Biden, might not be a great upgrade over the current President. However the mistakes Biden could make is easier to stomach then Trump's.
I won’t believe anyone but Biden. People are going to try and spread lies just make others angry.
One could argue that bragging about acing a standard cognitive test is concerning for decline as well.  I’ve administered that test and it’s not that hard.  And I’d love to see your dad and Biden go head to head on both a ramp and a bike.
While knocking doors for President  this morning. I came across this great reminder of why the USA is great.  This war didn’t happen so Socialist Joe Biden can tear our country apart.   This is why we need #4MoreYears to protect our history and constitution.
Biden’s gonna screw this up, isn’t he?
This computes. It’s why I’ll take Biden to task AFTER he’s elected but not before. It’s why I’ll team with GOP Never Trumpers with whom I have little else in common. We have to get the train wreck outta the White House.
What should Trump of done differently regarding Covid-19?   The rioters seem to be unaffected!  Imagine Biden trying to decide what to do.  He’s not sure if he ate breakfast in the morning.
JOE BIDEN NEEDS TO GET AN IQ TEST DONE
President Donald Trump accused former Vice President Joe Biden of wanting to 'hurt God' during a stop in Ohio on Thursday.. wants to mandate every American wear masks OUTDOORS!   hasn’t required that (yet). So when will he denounce this authoritarianism from Biden/  When will the media ask  if she supports a federal mask mandate (that includes outdoors)?
Me too.  I think Biden has been anal probed by many aliens
The msm mentioned this peace deal didn’t say a word or even mention trump and then said Biden and Harris said they will add to this if they get elected typical liberal bs
Biden is a racist. Here he is with Robert Byrd, leader of the kkk and demokkkrats. You should learn something
They can't make a pitch that does not boil down to "not Trump". These Biden Bros are very toxic.
Youre referring to Kamala...referring to Biden, right?
"The Biden campaign is a Trojan horse in the truest sense: it’s an empty vessel through which the Dems are attempting to substitute a portion of the GOP’s base for a portion of their own.
When her Wikipedia page was recently scrubbed &amp; details about her prosecution record started to disappear EVERYONE should have known the "Hollywood" re-write was in motion.  Put Biden in a dog collar now, give him some fruit cup &amp; give "Nurse Diesl" her whip.
This is disgusting. Are you doing anything to stop it?  This will not be forgotten when Biden wins.
Unless Biden sniffs her 3 pack a day smoke smell then he might keal over.
What an endorsement for Biden!
You DO realize not voting for Biden is a vote for Trump who wants to take away Medicare and Social Security.
BBC News - Biden VP pick: Kamala Harris chosen as running mate
OMG. I was half joking when I said Biden didn’t mention showers and toilets
Biden and Harris introducing their candidacy on the 3 year anniversary of Charlottesville is beautifully done.
I keep watching Pres Obama and VP Biden but now I don't have to.  #BidenHarris2020  #tRumpForPrison2021
As much as I appreciate West, he may vote Biden.
#BidenKamala2020 Cause I’m NOT Doing Another trump Term PERIOD. I’m not stupid, and I don’t support Everything That either Biden nor Kamala has done... nor ANYBODY for that matter But, I REFUSE even the remote possibility that trump’s stankin ass gets re-elected. My SOUL rejects
The Biden method
Biden needs to worry about white men/women voting for him, not black people 😂
Kamala isn't my first choice but neither was Joe Biden.  Whatever it takes honestly. Kamala is well spoken but that does not excuse her past at all.
Biden chose the cop. :/
C’mon man!!!Joe Biden doesn’t remember what he had for breakfast this morning, let alone what he believes. Or do you mean how black people “ain’t” black if they don’t vote for him? Or how black people, with “notable exceptions”, aren’t diverse and can’t think for themselves?
Biden has no chance #MAGA 🇺🇸
Someone needs to tell Biden that he is running for President.
Biden was my LAST choice, but he's still 1000X better than Trump.
My VP Take:  The fact that Kamala Harris is  considered both “A RADICAL LIBERAL” AND “A COP” means that her positions probably align fairly close to the average American voter  I think it was a smart pick by Joe Biden  #KamalaHarrisForVP #JoeBidenForPresident2020
"I believe them and I respect them being able to tell their story and having the courage to do it," Harris said about Biden’s accusers
Trump is a terrible, disgusting piece of shit.  But the Democrats aren't even trying to win.  In fact, their VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, Kamala Harris, has previously said that she believes that Joe Biden is guilty of multi-time sexual assault:
Remember the beating  gave Biden in the debates?? And she LIKES him.   Pence ... about to be destroyed.
Trump says men are insulted Biden picked a woman VP candidate! Can you get any more misogynist?! Hey Trump, real men don’t get insulted when capable women break the glass ceiling
Excellent #VPPick, Mr. Biden. Trump supporters are probably celebrating today because of this historically terrible pick. 🙄
EXACTLY!! Biden doesn't cry in the bunk house!!
I wonder if the Biden/Harris ticket will use a 2Pac Shakur theme song?
Biden Harris would destroy your business. You will no longer have a business to run under their policies. Good luck to you if you vote blue.
Curious as to what the polls look like now in Biden vs. Trump.
Please vote for Biden/Harris November 3rd. They are the best option we have to lead this country the next 4 years.
Biden-Harris 2020 sounds so much better than Trump-Pence 2020
Senator Kamala Harris is the pick for Vice President! I'm on board for Biden-Harris 2020!   #BidenHarris2020
Waiting for Twitter to break with who Joe Biden announces as his VP pick.
THE PICK IS IN!!!!  Biden to announce soon.
I will vote for Biden if he picks Harvey the Rabbit as his running mate. If something happened to Biden, an invisible rabbit would still be a better president than Trump.
this right here ought to tell the American people who Biden really is .. and, for the record, President Trump does NOT favor Russia, Putin, election interference or any of those things liberal Democrats continually accuse him of.
I will vote for Joe Biden if he chooses my 5 pound Yorkshire Terrier as his running mate! I would prefer Harris, but it's Joe we need!
And Biden has been using her plan. #WarrenVP
Is Biden making his announcement today on VP choice?
I will be happy when these are the jokes we make about the government again.
Who would you put on Biden’s dream team of cabinet members?
Hope you are on Biden Cabinet
Biden does kind of look like Captain Crunch
Polls, can we trust them?
Joe Biden's heretical Catholicism is far  deeper than his abortion stance.Quite frankly, he, &amp;     should all be denied Holy Communion until they publicly uphold &amp; defend the teachings of the church. Bishops: More doctrine less videos #DefendtheFaith
Was Biden president ? 🤣🤣🤣
I always said he never wanted to win in 2016 either.. and would say stupid stuff going "They will never vote for me now"..  well they did..  who knew.. but remember there is a hidden Trump vote out there, so be leary of the polls if Trump is within 5% of Biden in any poll.
🤦🏽‍♀️😂😂😆😆This Idiot In Chief is desperate and saying anything he can think of to try to make Biden look bad, when the more he opens his mouth the worse it makes him look!!
I wonder what his old buddy “Barry” thinks I these comments man Biden is a racist pos dementia or not who says shit like this
I’d vote for a Biden/Carrot ticket. 2020 is not the year to fucking quibble over the VP selection.  JFC-don’t you get it yet?
Oh thank you, Trump, for letting me know.  I didn’t know that Biden was was going to hurt God. That doesn’t sound very nice.  And here I was going to vote for him..... 🙄🤬😳
why isn’t this on the first page of yahoo?I see much less enthusiasm for Biden than Hillary...
We are better than this moment.  New video by the Lincoln project.  We cannot take four more years.  Vote for Biden.

I saw my first couple Biden signs this week.  3 houses in a row just like this (I don’t condone doing this to others property but it’s what I saw)
The world is already laughing.  AT YOU AND YOU ONLY !!!!  THE WORLD IS ANXIOUS TO HAVE JOE BIDEN AS THE NEXT U.S. PRESIDENT.
He thinks “mail-in” is any scribbled napkin with Biden’s name on it that gets folded, stamped and mailed.
If you want a national mask mandate, vote for Joe Biden.
Well I've got some red meat for you: We're not going to let Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris cut America's meat!" -------"And we will toss your salad!"
Oops I am so sorry.... If Biden &amp; Harris win.
Well ID Niden &amp; Harris win we are screwed period Biden has always been racist, check it out. Why does government allows section eights it ruined the area I lived in. They get a half the price break out in nice suburbs. I am fed cons. Yet lower got changes. David J Harris UTube!!
Took a hopeful hike to the top of Mt. Democrat and raised a little money for the Biden-Harris campaign, too!       #GoJoe2020 #BidenHarris #Democrats
Does Joe Biden know more than a single health official quoted in this article?
Many here want universal health coverage. Unless we get a Democratic majority in the Senate (or find some long-lost Republican moderates), the bill won't reach Biden's desk. What's important for the election is to flip the Senate. Then we can talk tactics. Need more on Team Blue.
I’m just so tired of the shit where anyone remotely criticizes Biden or Harris and some lib is like “okay I guess you want trump to win then” as if that’s an argument
Dude liberals really think “at least he’s not Trump” is a good argument for Joe Biden. At best he’ll choose marginally better SC Justices, but honestly pretty sure libs just think trump is obnoxious and mean and think the country would look better with someone else.
For them to embrace to political left is for them to reject the corporate donations that keep them rich and powerful, and that won’t happen, so of course Biden would rather choose Harris and fight for conservative votes than skew remotely to the left.
It makes no sense to say “push Biden left,” because the political left lies on a wholly different spectrum from neoliberalism. That’s why conservative politicians can support trump but liberal politicians won’t support Bernie; Trump didn’t question capitalism and Bernie did.
- The so called editorial written by John Eastman is a racist letter to those who think a woman of color, born in Oakland, CA is not eligible to run w Biden. I am deeply offended that you would allow this blatant birther piece in your mag. Disgusting #BoycottNewsweek
Has there ever been a high profile political figure more ripe for SNL-style satire than Joe Biden?   But they don't ever go there, do they? Even SNL's treatment of him during the debate was very gentle.  Huh. Wonder why that is?  #TCNT
It is even scarier that he comes right out and says it!   Trump says fear of 'low income housing' will bring 'the suburban housewife' to his side  via
Well? This would cause me to vote for Biden... #MedicareForAll
How low?  Very low! Herman Cain Twitter Account Shares Posthumous Attack on Biden and Harris
Biden Harris is a good start to clean up the messes created by trump pence and GOP. I state the obvious.
I'm looking for suggestions for the Biden/Harris cabinet.  Ideas?
Ready.  All Blue all the time.  Crucial that Biden had a New Democratic Leader in the Senate.  Cannot get the legislation through that we need without a majority in the Senate and the House.
"They bought their tickets on the Trump Train. It’s time for them to take the ride."  via
Every time I think about the Biden/Harris ticket I just think how hard Leslie Knope would be campaigning for this.
Thank God we might have well spoken leaders in the white house again.. Listening to Harris speak,, actually made my eyes well up,, and my heart to fill with pride again.. Harris makes case against Trump in first speech as Biden's running mate
Under Obama &amp; Biden, there were zero deaths from the bubonic plague.  That’s leadership or perhaps selective history.  H1N1 anybody???????!!!!!!!
Biden can lose Florida and still win if he gets Wisconsin and Arizona
At today’s appearance, Biden and Harris had the state and territory flags as a background. What did they do for the Mississippi flag?
Like the dipshit who just asked if Biden should publicly denounce Antifa? WITAF kind of question is that?
is saying #Biden will be killed, or die?   go talk to this Cowardly people who can say this
Trump or Biden tweet it to me
I can say same thing about u voting for Biden
You're gonna vote for Joe Biden. You support Keith Ellison. You probably supported Al Franken and would again. Drop the Southern belle act.
And I am supposed to worry that Biden might not be a competent leader?
I don't know many conservatives that support Joe Biden.  Oh wait you're talking about the Lincoln Republicans.  I see.  #tcnt
Trump: If Biden wins, Americans will have to learn Chinese  via
‘That’s all they’ve got?’ MSNBC’s Morning Joe and Mika mock Trump’s attacks against Biden-Harris -
for me at least i see trump as a symptom of a broken system not him being the cause per se. a lot of how we got to this point is purely because of the tough on crime stance that dems took in the late 80s and 90s (spearheaded by biden) to appeal to conservatives.
i would if i had faith that the same wouldnt happen under biden/kamala esp considering kamala's track record
biden/kamala is just so fucking bad, biden alone was bad but fucking kamala? w/e i wasnt planning on voting anyways.
The Trump Biden comparisons are pissing me off. Have you guys not been paying attention to the world under Trump?? Biden would be miles better and we cannot afford another four years of Trump. What’s not clicking???
Could you,  , show us the other ads you had already prepared for the candidates NOT chosen by Biden? I know they exist!
I think he was trying to intimate that Harris was so critical of Biden, that Trump wanted her to run with him
To those who think Biden/Harris aren't progressive enough--If progressive legislation is passed in Congress, Biden will sign it.  That's why down-ballot races are so important. Execs set the tone, but Congress is where the work will get hammered out.  Vote Blue in all contests.
Republicans are failing to realize.  Kamala Harris isn't running for president! Joe Biden will be the one that'll wipe the floor with Trump!
I figure most of the progressive agenda needs legislative work.  That just makes down-ballot races crucial.  Don’t fret about Biden/Harris. Work hard to get Democrats elected to Congress and state houses.  Pay attention to any judges on the ballot, too.
Biden/Harris 2020 all the way. #DumpTrump2020
Biden/Harris 2020. Make America Sane.
If both #BLM and the #MeToo movements were consistent and not just Democrat voting machines, they would both be opposed to a Biden candidacy. Kamala Harris joining the ticket does nothing to help the credibility of either movement. #TCNT
Exactly where should Biden be during the #Trumpvirus other than his own home?  Pretty lame Screamer even for you! 🤮💩 #BidenHarris2020
Kamala Harris chosen as the running mate. This is problematic given her voting record and it is not progressive ticket. via
I’m in stand by for hopefully a big old nothing but loving the timeline love for Biden/Harris 2020.
Remember when Kamla Harris thought Joe Biden was a racist? LOL
Campaign for Biden/Harris like they are 10 points behind! Get out there and work your ass off for these two great people...
It’s about to get bigger.
Coulda been a wet rag and I’d still vote Biden.
I'm elated and have tears at the same time !  OMG.  So proud of Biden right now.  What a great choice.  It's an historic day for black women, and women in general !
I would have preferred Duckworth, but Harris is definitely competitant. Also by picking someone that was so critical of him during the primaries, Biden signifies he has thick skin unlike 45.
Covid is fake. The niggers are suicidal and wanted to be killed by cops. Biden is corrupt faggot, TRUMP IS THE ONE!
Well said. Biden has to pick a VP that will work with him, not the " most popular dance partner".
Ok. So I guess Joe Biden will be on soon. You know. So he doesn’t have politics on one side.
You do realize that Biden is only three years older than Trump? Rightwing polllsters have already given up on polling and realize Biden is going to win. Doesn’t matter, it’s much more important to end Trump’s presidency.
I was with you up until the Biden part. The dude never had a lot but lost whatever he had.
I bet you were all over Joe Biden the other day too. But now, you can say we don’t look at facts and that’s ok? You see that hypocrisy. When it’s good for you, the rest of us can’t comprehend. When it’s bad it’s oh don’t lump us all together. Right??
But if Biden picks the wrong VP, amiright?
Anybody who is triggered by my tweets, rest assured, if Hilary or Biden were proving themselves as incompetent, I’d say the same thing. I could care less about right, left, or upside down. This country needs leadership and we do not have it.
Amy called Biden and asked to be dropped from consideration.  She actually told Biden she was withdrawing because she believed the 2020 VP pick should be a woman of color.
Right...they've all done something we don't like.  I'll never forget how Biden treated Anita Hill (in the Clarence Thomas hearings), but that doesn't mean I won't vote for him.
Good grief! And, he and his two sons like to talk about Biden????? #DementedDon
The dropout who tweets about D.J. Trump as a "clown president" hasn't listened well to sleepy Joe Biden. I doubt Joe would be able to mentally survive a four-year term.
* IF* Joe Biden ends up choosing a white female running mate, how will you feel about that?
Secure drop boxes are a great idea, especially since we just had an actual *theft* of a mailbox over the weekend.  Who knew mailboxes could be stuffed in a van?  Not trying to unjustly accuse but it doesn't seem like something a Biden supporter would do.
Wtf?  A vote for any candidate other than Biden is a vote for trump. What about this don’t you understand?
Just listen to yourself.  You sound like a toddler and act like one. How embarrassing for the President of the United States to act so immature. I want a real man as a President and that would be  Biden
Fox news finally admitted that Sarah Palin was a big mistake as John McCain  VP pick. Fox News also think that Joe Biden VP  pick would be something worse than Palin.  Fox news is wrong again! No one can be that horrible! Fox turns on Palin.
The administration.  Is covering for Russian interference , in American elections. They would like people to think , China and Iran want Biden to win. To downplay Russian interference. It's also give Trump an opportunity to say, China and Iran rigged the election in Biden favor!
Very true.  Biden’s thought to wandering out his mouth and that makes the likes of liberals cringe.  You’d have to wheel Biden of the debate stage on a gurney.
Trump.  Is going to cry like a naked baby when he loses on November 3rd.  People should vote for Biden just to see that fiasco!
They’ll wait till the last minute and replace Biden as the candidate with an unknown and I debated candidate.  Last minute Hillary switch?
There’s all these things then I hear someone say “Biden seems creepy, that’s why I won’t vote for him”???
"You have to ask what Biden is doing I don't think he knows what he's doing "
I dare you to race Biden on bicycles...winner is President.
What if Biden DID die at some point earlier this year and they DID make a hologram of him to keep up the charade, but in a Star Trek Holodeck-esque mishap, the hologram escaped and HE'S the one running for president. 🤔🤔🤔
Peter doocy will be VP running mate.  Biden-Doocy 2020.
Pray to God Joe Biden wins and we take back the Senate. We'll have to rebuild the State Department and our intelligence agencies. Who knows how many Russian assets are now in the CIA thanks to Trump?
Exactly. Most VP choices are announced just prior to the Convention.  This woman could be President at some point. If they go through rigorous vetting, all the better. A VP is a partner in governance. Regardless of our fave, Biden will need to work w her. It is his call.
Or China is backing up Dumpty's claim that a Biden win means being in cahoots with China, making Biden look corrupt. This is a Through The Looking Glass world now.
I retired as an engineering executive.  I'd like to say I'm a self made man.  It isn't true.  I had great parents, teachers and learning environment.  We would see more opportunity for success if ALL had the same as I had.  Fund education!  Proud to be a Republican for Biden.
Kanye said he wanted to pull votes away from Biden. Which voters do you think are watching Fox?
Tbf, Biden's main platform is "I'm not Trump" so they're both doing it
America.  No matter how many gaphs Biden might make his heart will always be in the right place. Trump.  Is a cruel and evil man and so are his supporters. They all need to be brought down a notch! ROME IS BURNING!
Nothing wrong with saying how we can all do better.  I think the Professor did a fine job of saying how Biden can improve, rather than just identifying his shortfalls. Nuance is a good thing.
Biden is colluding with China!
⁦ ⁦ couldn’t debate his way out of a wet paper bag. Bring it. #GoJoe2020 #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Totally fair, I don't trust Biden's future cabinet to not start more illegal wars, and they would do so with more stealth and in a way that rallies those gullible enough into believing it's the right thing to do.
U voting for Biden??? Lmao CBM
I have faith in our survival. If Biden really wanted those votes, maybe he should rethink things like his stance on the War on Drugs AKA modern day Jim Crow. One cannot support the war on drugs without also supporting a system that unfairly cracks down on POC.
Trump.  Is having a hard time attacking Joe Biden on any issue. But the Trump campaign is waiting to attack who Biden VP choice. Trump.  Have no plan!
I'm sure as hell not voting for Trump but I'm not convinced Trump beating Biden would absolutely be the ultimate end of America. We are stronger than that, if we have to live through 4 more years of orange, it'll suck, but we will prevail.
Is Biden announcing today? About time. In a nonpandemic time, the Dem convention would have already happened, and we'd have known for weeks.
And also that they can attack Biden for "being senile". There are tons of other things that are WAY more valid to attack Biden on. Plus Trump's insistence that the 1918 pandemic was in 1917 is just... Weird.
Not a good week for a party of young people and the future.  Biden calls a black left leaning report a “junkie” and you go passive aggressive to a PBS reporter  fair question. You both are old cranky relics that need to let young reasonable clever people lead the party.
America.  Let's not for get, it was President Obama and Joe Biden that lead the American people out if the deepest recession in decades, without America never missing a beat. It also was the two of them that stopped what would've been a pandemic in its tracks. Never forget!
Wish Michelle Obama.  Could be Joe Biden VP. no pressure. It would definitely be a blow out ticket! Landslides of all Landslides!
Biden easily. Trump just says insensitive shit. Biden legit has a racist past.
Without Dems in control of the Senate, immigration reform and any number of important issues will continue to languish in Congress.  Bills cannot make it to Pres Biden if they aren't brought up and passed in the Senate.  Vote Blue up and down the ballot.  🌊
By the numbers only, is Biden wrong though? Where does the black vote usually go?
Next is he gonna say Biden’s against air and we’re all gonna suffocate?? 🙄
We deserve better than Trump &amp; Biden! #UNITY2020 is on a mission to draft a President &amp; VP to unite the country. This is neither a spoiler campaign nor a 3rd party ticket. Learn more and get on the email list here:    Let's take back our republic!
If a God can be hurt by Joe Biden, is he really a God?
Trump. No?  Biden?
hey Pete, Biden wants to get rid the 2nd amendment?  He is a gun owner right now. Has Trump ever been a fun owner?
Trump speaks a lot more but who is saying Trump speaks well lmao. It’s better than Biden tho
I hate Biden but I'm still going to vote for him. Why? Because its going to be biden or trump and I for one don't want another 4 years of that walking shitstain destroying this country.  Also keep in mind its not just biden we are voting for -c-
People need to stop posting things about the shitty stuff Biden has said or done. Yes, we get it, he is not great by any means but crap like that is going to convince people to just not vote and every single vote not for Biden is one less trump needs to worry about.i dont understand how people will "Hold his feet to the fire"  this entire election cycle has proven they can just do whatever, whenever and people will fall in line. a fucking cop as VP in 2020 and people are lapping it up. biden don't care what anybody thinks
Or maybe the USPS endorsing Biden. The people charged with delivering all those mail in ballots. Hmmm,  what could go wrong there? DA
California is in play? Biden is polling 30 points ahead there. He's polling 25 points ahead in New York.
People I won’t be voting for in November... #Trump #Biden
Will you effectively be President Mr./ Mrs. Biden’s twitter writer? You seem smart enough I suppose.
Tr*mp supporters don’t know we are losing with biden because Bernie is the only change maker.  We are being considerate when they call us names and we do not call them names back. There is a reason to be angry with them though because he is so rude!
Go vote for the other Biden then, Jack!
The question is: will media allow Biden and Harris to continue not answering questions? You would think that some ethics might still be relevant for journalists - this far those seem to be lacking. A major party candidate has been in a hidey hole for 3 months and media takes it.
. wants to mandate every American wear masks OUTDOORS!   hasn’t required that (yet). So when will he denounce this authoritarianism from Biden/  When will the media ask  if she supports a federal mask mandate (that includes outdoors)?
Alicia Mendoza, do you understand the difference between voting at the Democratic National Convention next week vs a vote in November General Election? Bernie wants his delegates next week to vote for for Bernie. Then he wants his supporters to vote for Biden in November!
What the fuck even was that conversation. She also had a totally incorrect timeline for when people were dropping out and endorsing Biden, and had totally the wrong idea about how people were doing in actual delegates and votes before that happened.
Me too.  I think Biden has been anal probed by many aliens
Another disadvantage of tweeting under your real name: it’ll be easier for the #tRUmpstapo to find you.
I thought for sure you were JFK Jr.!
Are you ... JFK Jr.?!
Why don't you ask Master Bates why #JoeBiden doesn't go out and campaign?  #Biden
I don’t even want to visit with my relatives who are conservative.. republican.. you know 😒 just saw a fb post “if you think Biden will change anything, you’re an idiot” from my fam so..just tired of it. Unfollowed.
She also has the same level of ability to string together complete English sentences as Joe Biden
I'm not convinced it matters if you admit you'll vote for Biden or not. They don't care about our votes. They don't want people like us to be anywhere near their party. Someone like Biden in particular will never genuinely move left on anything of significance.
Exactly. If Kanye drops out I'm voting for Trump.  I hope he costs Biden the election. The Dems shouldnt have screwed Yang.
The audacity of Biden voters telling non-supporters to check their privilege lmaoo
Funny how they have nothing to say about Trump's father buying his way into University and the fact he had to PAY SOMEONE ELSE to even get his scores up high enough.  But yeah, Biden in 3rd grade.

I'd rather vote for somebody who won't be president than to vote for Biden or Trump.  I personally think black voters should refuse to vote for any candidate that isn't black until we get a totally pro black agenda.
Exactly.  It's hard for me, it's either vote Trump or vote Kanye. I refuse to support Biden or Kamala, it goes against what I feel is right for the community I live in.  The last straw was Bidens " if you aren't for sure if you support me or Trump, you ain't black" comments
Biden drafted legislature which contributed to the mass incarcerations of many black Americans. Kamala was a prosecutor who incarcerated black Americans for weed.  If neither party is going to have a pro black agenda, I'm gonna vote for the black candidate in the race  #Kanye2020

Vote for Biden. First we deal with the threat to our very democracy, then we deal with the other party.
The science also doesn’t call for a national mask mandate that includes every citizen to wear masks inside and outside...will you point that out to Mr. Biden. Also, you’re on record that Hydroxychloroquine helped your spouse - is that science then? Thank you.
Remember how left-leaning news ran with a narrative that Biden was the "most-electable" candidate?  Like that.
This is skewed by what the poll considers "white Christians". They should have a category for so called "evangelicals" because I was Methodist now Lutheran and ALL white Christians I know support Biden.

Mainly my point is biden was instrumental in building the circumstances we find ourselves in, and effectively gave us trump. Handing him the reigns is like asking OG dark lord to have another shot
Why are we talking about bernie  Biden seems okay to people that think obama did things that made stuff seem ok when obama was an imperialist war monger riding the final years of "functional" neoliberalism. Biden is an authoritarian that will enter office during cap in crisis

Long story short? The states likely to see a breakdown over mail voting are isolated. And the states Biden likely will win with have well-run vote counting. (ie Biden is at 289 electoral votes with states that are Low/Moderate "post office risk.")
Im not sure of what means of production he privately controls to earn profit, but bernie did reveal himself to be a liberal by endorsing joe biden, architect of the american police state and arch-defender of capital

So… If Biden/Harris were president, they wouldn’t have shut down the economy?  I’m sure Harris knows that’s not true.  I’m pretty sure Harris’s target demographic doesn’t.
No I'm voting Kanye even though I know it helps Trump. Biden is responsible for many mass incarcerated black men with the 94 crime bill. Kamala is too from her days as a prosecutor.  Say what you want about Trump but I'll take him over Biden any day.
I wait and wait for Biden, Harris or any other prominent Democrat to stand up and condemn the violence we are seeing in major cities.  Instead, they are excusing or denying that it exists.  How can they save the country if they won’t look at reality?
Actually, I haven’t seen pictures of him touching young girls inappropriately.  It is rather interesting that instead of defending Biden, you jump to accusing Trump.  If you “know” Trump is a molester, how do you feel about Biden’s public groping of young girls and women?

Jan. 31: the president declared coronavirus a U.S. public health emergency &amp; issued the ban on travel between the US &amp; China. Campaigning in Iowa, Biden criticized Trump’s travel ban, saying, “This is no time for Donald Trump’s record of hysteria and xenophobia.”
So, the mayor of Luray, VA ( not far from DC) said Biden picked Aunt Jemima for his running mate. I hope everyone there is ashamed of him.  With luck he’ll reap the hate he sowed.
Biden doesn't have to accuse, TRUMP SAID HE WAS DOING IT ON NATIONAL TV.
I live in a sanctuary city where 98% of voters vote DFL Democrat Farmers Labor party. We got it buttoned up. Only Senator Tina Smith has a serious opponent statewide. Biden only has a 3% lead over the occupant in the White House. The real issue, is to get young people to vote.
His explanation is misogynistic and gross. It casts female politicians as calculating and manipulative with their families, rather than people who love their kids. Nobody criticizes Joe Biden for talking about how much he loves Beau.
But what happens if he wins?  You are making very bold predictions, I would hope people learned from 2016  Regardless who wins, I'm gonna make my money either way. But I'd rather Trump than Biden considering Bidens legislative history and Kamala's prosecutorial history
Okay, but who's doing that fighting? Because I'm pretty certain that under a Biden administration, a whole lot of people will declare that we've restored normality, and we can't really expect too much anyway. Literally the Obama admin all over again
We do differ in our threat assessment, yes, and really I don't think that Biden will (or could) do much to alleviate economic suffering. To be clear, I haven't decided what I'll do yet. But certainly the "vote them in and hold them accountable" line isn't convincing to me anymore

It’s always think pieces on shaming voters. Why don’t these people make think pieces on pushing Biden to commit to legalizing weed or Medicare for all which polls great throughout the country. Hold accountable now 🤷🏽‍♂️
Let me say I don't know the first thing about any of this. It's speculative. The reality is, they'll do what they want. There are maybe 300 people chatting about this every minute, every day. And Biden is kind of nodding, confused. It's a serious problem. Serious.
Kamala Harris advocates included "Rep. Barbara Lee &amp; Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalaki. Perhaps most effective was Ben Crump...who represented the Floyd family...An adulatory op-ed Crump wrote helped diffuse the campaign’s concern about Harris’ prosecutorial past."
Dems are machinery politicians. She would step in as the top dog for Biden, I presume, and they'd bring in a Pete or perhaps someone older as her second. They love shit like this. Watch THE WEST WING. It's right out of that. And the media will go along with anything they say.
Kamala Harris was willing to destroy a man's career and life over Christina Ford. Ford who couldn't remember much about an attack she never reported or talked about. Tara Reader's a different story. Will Harris give Tara equal treatment or sacrifice her to save Biden?
A lot of progressives are going through the unpalatable process of convincing themselves to vote for Biden. It would be really cool if the DNC could stop telling us to fuck off every 5 minutes, that'd probably help

I’m just so tired of the shit where anyone remotely criticizes Biden or Harris and some lib is like “okay I guess you want trump to win then” as if that’s an argument
Dude liberals really think “at least he’s not Trump” is a good argument for Joe Biden. At best he’ll choose marginally better SC Justices, but honestly pretty sure libs just think trump is obnoxious and mean and think the country would look better with someone else.
For them to embrace to political left is for them to reject the corporate donations that keep them rich and powerful, and that won’t happen, so of course Biden would rather choose Harris and fight for conservative votes than skew remotely to the left.
It makes no sense to say “push Biden left,” because the political left lies on a wholly different spectrum from neoliberalism. That’s why conservative politicians can support trump but liberal politicians won’t support Bernie; Trump didn’t question capitalism and Bernie did.

I think he was trying to intimate that Harris was so critical of Biden, that Trump wanted her to run with him
To those who think Biden/Harris aren't progressive enough--If progressive legislation is passed in Congress, Biden will sign it.  That's why down-ballot races are so important. Execs set the tone, but Congress is where the work will get hammered out.  Vote Blue in all contests.
I figure most of the progressive agenda needs legislative work.  That just makes down-ballot races crucial.  Don’t fret about Biden/Harris. Work hard to get Democrats elected to Congress and state houses.  Pay attention to any judges on the ballot, too.
Biden/Harris 2020. Make America Sane.
If both #BLM and the #MeToo movements were consistent and not just Democrat voting machines, they would both be opposed to a Biden candidacy. Kamala Harris joining the ticket does nothing to help the credibility of either movement. #TCNT

Well said. Biden has to pick a VP that will work with him, not the " most popular dance partner".
You do realize that Biden is only three years older than Trump? Rightwing polllsters have already given up on polling and realize Biden is going to win. Doesn’t matter, it’s much more important to end Trump’s presidency.
I was with you up until the Biden part. The dude never had a lot but lost whatever he had.
But if Biden picks the wrong VP, amiright?
Anybody who is triggered by my tweets, rest assured, if Hilary or Biden were proving themselves as incompetent, I’d say the same thing. I could care less about right, left, or upside down. This country needs leadership and we do not have it.
Amy called Biden and asked to be dropped from consideration.  She actually told Biden she was withdrawing because she believed the 2020 VP pick should be a woman of color.
Right...they've all done something we don't like.  I'll never forget how Biden treated Anita Hill (in the Clarence Thomas hearings), but that doesn't mean I won't vote for him.
Good grief! And, he and his two sons like to talk about Biden????? #DementedDon
The dropout who tweets about D.J. Trump as a "clown president" hasn't listened well to sleepy Joe Biden. I doubt Joe would be able to mentally survive a four-year term.
* IF* Joe Biden ends up choosing a white female running mate, how will you feel about that?
Lol. Why are liberals so willing to believe anything.   Maybe it’s Putin flying in to conspire with Biden...oh wait, only an uneducated liberal would think that.
If they continue to give Trump an hour everyday to basically give a campaign speech they need to give Biden equal time.  Trump just lies and nobody can correct him in realtime.
Secure drop boxes are a great idea, especially since we just had an actual *theft* of a mailbox over the weekend.  Who knew mailboxes could be stuffed in a van?  Not trying to unjustly accuse but it doesn't seem like something a Biden supporter would do.
Wtf?  A vote for any candidate other than Biden is a vote for trump. What about this don’t you understand?
Just listen to yourself.  You sound like a toddler and act like one. How embarrassing for the President of the United States to act so immature. I want a real man as a President and that would be  Biden
I DON'T CARE who it is. I'm voting Biden period full stop. Trump is a cancer that needs to go. ❤
Very true.  Biden’s thought to wandering out his mouth and that makes the likes of liberals cringe.  You’d have to wheel Biden of the debate stage on a gurney.
They’ll wait till the last minute and replace Biden as the candidate with an unknown and I debated candidate.  Last minute Hillary switch?
"You have to ask what Biden is doing I don't think he knows what he's doing "
I dare you to race Biden on bicycles...winner is President.
What if Biden DID die at some point earlier this year and they DID make a hologram of him to keep up the charade, but in a Star Trek Holodeck-esque mishap, the hologram escaped and HE'S the one running for president. 🤔🤔🤔
😂😂😂😂😂 That’s super cute. You actually think Biden has any say in who he chooses.
Peter doocy will be VP running mate.  Biden-Doocy 2020.
Pray to God Joe Biden wins and we take back the Senate. We'll have to rebuild the State Department and our intelligence agencies. Who knows how many Russian assets are now in the CIA thanks to Trump?
Exactly. Most VP choices are announced just prior to the Convention.  This woman could be President at some point. If they go through rigorous vetting, all the better. A VP is a partner in governance. Regardless of our fave, Biden will need to work w her. It is his call.
Or China is backing up Dumpty's claim that a Biden win means being in cahoots with China, making Biden look corrupt. This is a Through The Looking Glass world now.
I retired as an engineering executive.  I'd like to say I'm a self made man.  It isn't true.  I had great parents, teachers and learning environment.  We would see more opportunity for success if ALL had the same as I had.  Fund education!  Proud to be a Republican for Biden.
Kanye said he wanted to pull votes away from Biden. Which voters do you think are watching Fox?
Tbf, Biden's main platform is "I'm not Trump" so they're both doing it
Nothing wrong with saying how we can all do better.  I think the Professor did a fine job of saying how Biden can improve, rather than just identifying his shortfalls. Nuance is a good thing.
Biden is colluding with China!
⁦ ⁦ couldn’t debate his way out of a wet paper bag. Bring it. #GoJoe2020 #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Totally fair, I don't trust Biden's future cabinet to not start more illegal wars, and they would do so with more stealth and in a way that rallies those gullible enough into believing it's the right thing to do.
U voting for Biden??? Lmao CBM
I have faith in our survival. If Biden really wanted those votes, maybe he should rethink things like his stance on the War on Drugs AKA modern day Jim Crow. One cannot support the war on drugs without also supporting a system that unfairly cracks down on POC.
I'm sure as hell not voting for Trump but I'm not convinced Trump beating Biden would absolutely be the ultimate end of America. We are stronger than that, if we have to live through 4 more years of orange, it'll suck, but we will prevail.
Is Biden announcing today? About time. In a nonpandemic time, the Dem convention would have already happened, and we'd have known for weeks.
And also that they can attack Biden for "being senile". There are tons of other things that are WAY more valid to attack Biden on. Plus Trump's insistence that the 1918 pandemic was in 1917 is just... Weird.
Not a good week for a party of young people and the future.  Biden calls a black left leaning report a “junkie” and you go passive aggressive to a PBS reporter  fair question. You both are old cranky relics that need to let young reasonable clever people lead the party.
Biden easily. Trump just says insensitive shit. Biden legit has a racist past.
Without Dems in control of the Senate, immigration reform and any number of important issues will continue to languish in Congress.  Bills cannot make it to Pres Biden if they aren't brought up and passed in the Senate.  Vote Blue up and down the ballot.  🌊
You think Trump’s bad, wait until you hear Biden try and speak.
Biden cheers abortions. That’s super catholic of him.
Next is he gonna say Biden’s against air and we’re all gonna suffocate?? 🙄
We deserve better than Trump &amp; Biden! #UNITY2020 is on a mission to draft a President &amp; VP to unite the country. This is neither a spoiler campaign nor a 3rd party ticket. Learn more and get on the email list here:    Let's take back our republic!
If a God can be hurt by Joe Biden, is he really a God?
Trump. No?  Biden?
hey Pete, Biden wants to get rid the 2nd amendment?  He is a gun owner right now. Has Trump ever been a fun owner?
Trump speaks a lot more but who is saying Trump speaks well lmao. It’s better than Biden tho
I hate Biden but I'm still going to vote for him. Why? Because its going to be biden or trump and I for one don't want another 4 years of that walking shitstain destroying this country.  Also keep in mind its not just biden we are voting for -c-
People need to stop posting things about the shitty stuff Biden has said or done. Yes, we get it, he is not great by any means but crap like that is going to convince people to just not vote and every single vote not for Biden is one less trump needs to worry about.
Biden is definitely the radical left
All veterans. All Republicans. All in for Biden.The most frustrating part is that they agree that Biden is trash and still think that he deserves their vote. My hardest lefty friend even agrees with me that Obama sucked. Yet somehow still thinks Trump is worse.
Yep, they did it deceptively to make it sound worse than it was because trust me, they won't report the Q3 numbers the same way; although they will report the Q4 numbers to make them look ridiculously good if Biden wins.
Just as it takes one hip hop star - suffering from mental illness - to sabotage the Black vote for Biden. Smh 🤦🏾‍♀️ 🤯
But she should really be addressed as Senator Harris, with respect. Until she’s Madame President, that is (I don’t see Biden finishing the term).
convince me to vote for Biden/Harris without mentioning Trump.
#OhGoodShotMaam!  Just remember, #Biden and #Harris will kill them for the good of the world, rather than make peace from selfish, political motives like  #OrangeManBad!!!  #SnarkIsAnUnderappreciatedArtForm
If ur in support of #BLM and #ACAB and ur going to vote 4 Biden/Harris, ur a hypocrite.  If you are not going to be part of the #generalstrike due 2 the govt not completing the stimulus package and supported Sanders, ur also a hypocrite.
BIDEN/HARRIS, A CLASS ACT!!  AMERICA HAS A CHANCE TO RECLAIM ALL THAT IT HAS LOST.  trump/dense NOTHING BUT THE MOST PATHETIC PITIFUL INEPT INCOMPETENT DISGUSTING DEPLORABLE DECEITFUL DESPICABLE REPUGNANT REPULSIVE VAIN CONCEITED ARROGANT EGOTISTICAL  CLASSLESS ACT EVER!!!
Save you my opinions, but this article does a good job summing up where I (huge Warren and Sanders supporter) stand on the Biden/Harris ticket.
… Nobody cares about your opinion, and Kamala Harris will be a great vice president and a great president. She and Biden will really make America great again.
A preview of Biden’s response to Trump’s animated video last night?
I popped this list in a thread yesterday as potential targets for blame should Biden lose:
Bernie fell back in line fast enough that I don't think he'll be the target of Team D's ire should Biden lose.
You think Kristol has beclowned himself to the max, and he proves you wrong.  Did Joe McCarthy run for President against Truman? Did Robert Welch run against Ike? No.  But Bill will ride the Good Ship Biden into the water, confident his "conservative" donors will rescue him.
Once again  covers for Biden. First covering his criticisms over his senility by calling it "stutters" and omitting his actual seemingly racist comments - how blacks aren't black if they vote against him and saying blacks are less diverse than Latinos. Seriously Phil??
.It redirected to the Biden campaign, until about 12-24 hours ago. Now it redirects to "site unavailable."
I just donated $200 to Biden Harris in order to match the amount my son sent in today
I hope somebody or somebodies crash the crap out of it.  Well...  that is unless Team D crashes it without any help.  Which if Biden's streams are any indicator is highly likely.
Shouldn’t that be Biden?
that’s the argument that my sister-in-law used when talking to my wife tonight. Voting for trump because “Biden couldn’t do any better”. trump will get the majority of votes from this devout evangelical &amp; her circle of friends. Can’t have fact based conversation. Tone deaf.
Outside of merely being a political opponent the reason #Trump is mystified by #Biden picking #Kamala is he cannot fathom receiving criticism, reflecting &amp; reconciling w:the one who brought the critique. It’s not in him &amp; it matters #KamalaHarrisVP #BidenHarris2020 #KamalaHarris
It wouldn’t help it whatsoever. Still need to not only win the Senate but get a strong majority and probably get more seats House as well before M4A can happen. So it’s not happening for the next 4 years regardless. Biden could opt for one term as well.
BIDEN IS EVERYTHING trump ISN'T.
Finally, someone who knows Canada's neighbourliness, eh?  Joe Biden's new running mate, Kamala Harris, is a Westmount High graduate | CBC News
Translation: White Woman will be submissive to their White Husbands in knowing, I'll keep Blacks &amp; Mexicans away from their neighborhoods. Also don't vote Biden because he'll allow a Black Man to allow fair opportunities to all races.   Trump's racism is so blatant &amp; disgusting!!
I didn’t know  was campaigning for Biden now.
Is Biden rocking a mullet?
THIS.  Finally, in 2020 we have Kamala Harris as the running mate to Joe Biden. A woman that looks like many of us who have never held a seat at the table and who have been under represented our entire lives. I shed tears last night. Better late than never 💕.
But smear ads that center around Biden’s failing mental state aren’t nasty...makes sense to me.
i am closer to biden ideologically than jorgensen so no thanks
trump KNOWS HE IS GOING TO LOSE THE 2020 ELECTION AND WILL DO WHATEVER TO NOT HAVE TO GIVE UP THE POWER N ATTENTION HE HAS.      KANYE WEST IS NOTHING BUT A INEXPERIENCED UNQUALIFIED NO CHANCE OF WINNING  trump TOY USED TO HOPEFULLY  DRAW VOTES AWAY FROM THE BIDEN/HARRIS TICKET.
AMERICA, IN A COVID19  CRISIS WHO WOULD YOU RATHER LOOK TOO FOR LEADERSHIP? BIDEN/HARRIS--PEOPLE YOU CAN TRUST IN WHAT THEY SAY trump/dense-- 2 GD MFin LYING SACKS OF ORANGE SHIT YOU COULDN'T TRUST FOR SHIT YOUR ANSWER WILL TELL A GREAT DEAL  ABOUT AMERICA AND IT'S FUTURE.
.I am. I think she'll be a bad candidate for #Biden and the #Democrats. I know he had to pick a black woman, but I didn't expect her. She's a loser.
WITH BIDEN/HARRIS AMERICAN WILL  FINALLY CORRECT/RIGHT IT'S ROYAL 4 YR F#CK UP KNOWN AS THE trump/dense RESIDENCY.
RIGHT ON HOLLY, TELL IT LIKE IT IS. trumps A COMPLETE ORANGE MORON AND ALL AMERICA SHOULD VOTE FOR BIDEN/HARRIS
Joe Biden's platform is the most progressive platform of a nominee in decades.  So mission accomplished? Let's restore humanity by voting Biden/Harris.  (And protect literal human lives from Trump's harm)
Fair point. So look at the platform being put forth by the Biden Harris campaign. Look at the anti-lunching law Harris put forth. Look  her policies on abolishing mandatory minimums and legalizing marijuana.
Or maybe they figure no one can possibly hide it any longer. It isn't as if Biden's breakdown is obscure.
Lies and fear-mongering. That’s all you got. Biden and Harris will restore hope, dignity, honesty, and democracy. Trump will continue to tear this country apart while he steals from us and lets us die while he plays golf.
I keep seeing repostings of Obama’s endorsement and congratulatory statement to Biden and Harris like thats supposed to mean something 🙃🥴 or we’re supposed to be relieved. He was symbolic (which is fine) in the same way Kamala being VP is (also fine). Both moderate af lol.
She is certainly qualified at 55.  Can she garner the votes Biden needs for the win?
Our Republican President couldn’t believe that Biden wasn’t vengeful for her questioning him during debates. Thanks VP Biden for being a bigger person!
No it’s an old picture. Biden was in Delaware all day and Harris was in California all day. They’re going to be together in Dover Delaware tomorrow.
...To another 4 years of Trump. After Gabbard exposed Harris for her hypocrisy she's going to drag Biden down worse than he's doing on his own.
It feels so good having Biden/Harris as a team. They will bring ethics back to government. They will bring back empathy. They will bring back fairness. And so much more.
At least Biden will try and hide the bad things his team does and not kill the gays. Harris will just try to lock up the trans folks though.
“Nasty to Kavanaugh”...is Trump campaigning for Biden/Harris now cause this sounds like a great endorsement?
Harris was my favorite, but all the women up for VP were good. Please people vote for the Biden/Harris ticket. They are a great team.
Hey, I hate that Biden is the Dem nom as well. He's incredibly problematic. INCREDIBLY. BUT...still going to vote for him over Trump in Nov. Because that's what we got. And if you don't because your upset about Biden, them congrats, you've contributed to four more years of hell.
Actually this is a photo op.  The difference is Biden didn’t need to shoot and gas peaceful protestors to hold a Bible upside down. He just rode a bike instead while Trump can’t even walk down a ramp.

"BIDEN N HARRIS", AMERICA CAN ONCE AGAIN BE PROUD OF THE PRESIDENT N VICE PRESIDENT OF THIS GREAT COUNTRY OF OURS.
Joe Biden picking Kamala Harris as his VP is just more proof that cops and klan go hand in hand.
Because both have mixed records on criminal justice, the Biden/Harris ticket needs to take the initiative and talk early, often and specifically about reform. Then, when elected, they need to do it without reservation or deference to the DOJ.
Great, what I going to do with all the boxes of these Biden/ ghost of Eliza Hamiliton shirts I ordered ?
AMERICA, BIDEN/HARRIS HAVE PLANS TO FIGHT THE COVID19 CRISIS. trump n dense AFTER 7 MONTHS AND 160000+ DEATHS STILL HAVE NO NATIONAL RESPONSE TO THE COVID19 CRISIS. 1st ignored it Called it a hoax Said over by summer It'll just disappear WHO DO YOU WANT TO LEAD AMERICA'S FIGHT
Those people were going to vote for Biden no matter who he picked for VP.  She doesn't sway a demographic. She doesn't bring a better chance of winning any States. She instead of mitigating some of Biden's biggest problems, amplifies them.  Picking Harris is tactical idiocy.
BIDEN/HARRIS,,, AMERICA FINALLY  HAS SOMETHING IT CAN LOOK FORWARD TOO AFTER ALMOST 4 YRS OF PURE ORANGE BULLSHIT N LIES THAT HAS THE WHOLE WORLD LAUGHING AT AMERICA.
BIDEN/HARRIS=PROVEN WINNERS JUST WHAT AMERICAN NEEDS.  trump/dense=PROVEN LOSERS JUST WHAT AMERICA DOESN'T NEED.
Biden and Harris will kick your ass.
trump KNOWS HE'S GOING TO LOSE 2020 AND WILL YRY ANYTHING TO REMAIN IN POWER.     KAYNE WEST IS NOTHING BUT A INEXPERIENCED UNQUALIFIED trump PIGEON SET UP TO DRAW VOTES AWAY FROM BIDEN
I fully agree with you  Warren would have been an amazing President or Vice President. I’m hopeful that Biden will put her in a key position. I also think Kamala Harris is an excellent choice.
The average American voter is not ready for the first female Vice President of Jamaican and Indian immigrant parents.  Dumb move on Biden team.  Smh.
Biden picks Kamala Harris, his former 2020 rival, to be his vice presidential running mate
Biden/Harris 2020!! Let's Go!!
"BIDEN N HARRIS" A PRESIDENT N VICE PRESIDENT AMERICA CAN AND WILL BE  BE PROUD OF. THAT WILL BRING BACK THE RESPECT AMERICA DESERVES  trump n dense.  TWO SENILE  BOZO'S AMERICA'S IS ASHAMED/ EMBARRASSED OF. WHO HAVE DESTROYED ANY/ALL REPECT THAT AMERICA DESERVES.
Good Choice. Hopefully when Biden wins Sally Yates for AG and Susan Rice as SOS, have Schumer step aside and make Warren Senate Majority Leader. Let's put some women in charge for a change. It seems to work well in other countries.
Personally, Tulsi Gabbard. Nobody I know except for “vote blue no matter who” people like Biden even a little bit, and Tulsi undoubtedly has the power to draw in voters from across the line.  Of course, they wouldn’t have chosen Biden in the first place if they wanted to win.
I’m thrilled. Vote Biden-Harris.
Congrats on your pick!! I was SO hoping you would pick Kamala Harris! You two will make a great team! "Ridin' with Biden!"
It’s February 2021.   It is announced that Joe Biden can no longer perform his duties as President, and  takes over as POTUS. #BidenHarris2020
Trump just won a second term. Smh.  Your average American voter is not ready for the first female Vice President of Jamaican and Indian immigrant parents.  Dumb move on Biden team.
Okay honestly folks, Biden isn’t amazing and neither is Kamala but they’re significantly better than Trump/Pence. Like seriously I’m convinced some of you live in make-believe world where you’re still upset your favorite candidate didn’t get the nomination. Come on...
So Kamala, who did you sleep with to get to be Biden’s running mate? We are gonna have some fun with this! BJ and the hooker! What a team!
Senator Kamala Harris is Biden's VP pick! Congrats, Senator!
I also appreciate that we know she *can* stand up to Biden when appropriate, as well as be a good teammate and work together afterwards.
BREAKING NEWS: Joe Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate!  #BidenHarris2020
Kamala Harris for VP, a great choice, vote Biden Harris. 🌊🌊🌊😄😸😊😂
A Harris-Pence debate will be far more interesting, and informed, than any Trump-Biden debate.
YES!! Joe Biden here. Big news: I've chosen Kamala Harris as my running mate. Together, with you, we're going to beat Trump. #KamalaHarrisForVP
BIDEN HARRIS 2020 LETS GO!!!!
My blood is boiling! How can we shut him up? Trump says men may be 'insulted' by Biden's female VP pledge #Biden2020
Interesting points
the VP pick could be Hitler's reanimated corpse and I'd still vote for Biden
I asked one of my buddies, what’s the worst thing about Trump. He said that he lies. He says he’s voting for Biden. 🤷🏽‍♂️
Scary thought: when Biden wins the election trump can start running for 2024.😳
I’d vote for Biden if he named a cabbage as running mate. Fortunately there aren’t any cabbages on his short list.
So crazy how much I bought into her bullshit and how quickly I forgot she existed after she endorsed Biden. I would say it was a good 2-3 months where I didn’t see anything about her on here. And then shocked at myself for how quickly I forgot about her.
So-called president drumpf forgets the word virus when he is talking about coronavirus. But yet he says Joe Biden is out of it.
Joe Biden/ Imminent .
I AGREE. THE DAMN CONVENTIONS ARE JUST A EXCUSE FOR GROWN UPS TO GET TOGETHER TOO  ACT LIKE KIDS AT A UNCHAPERONED  PARTY.     IT'S BIDEN N trump SO WHO NEEDS A CONVENTION? ESPICALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC?
DAMN OBVIOUS KANYE,  INEXPERIENCED UNQUALIFIED,  JUST AN ATTEMPT BY trump TO TAKE VOTES AWAY FROM BIDEN. ANOTHER EXAMPLE trump KNOWS HE IS GOING TO LOSE AND WILL DO WHATEVER IS NECESSARY TO PREVENT THAT.       SO FAR trump HAS ASKED KAYNE AND PUTUN FOR HELP, IS KIM JUNG UN NEXT?
TO ONE AND ALL ESPICALLY THE BRAIN DEAD IGNORANT GULLIBLE LAPDOG LACKEY GOP trump SUPPORTERS. SOON TO BE POTUS BIDEN HAS PLANS TO FIGHT THE COVID19 CRISIS AND SAVE AMERICAN LIVES.  trump IN HIS GROSS INEPT INCOMPETENT MURDEROUS  MISHANDLING OF THE COVID19 CRISIS HAS::

Biden is apparently announcing his VP running mate this week! I won't lie that I'm secretly rooting for Michelle Obama who isn't even on the list!
I DON'T CARE who it is. I'm voting Biden period full stop. Trump is a cancer that needs to go. ❤
Dude, who are you going to vote for them? All this hate you spew for Biden only helps Trump... you don't see this??
you must be completely high or drunk or both. in the last few months, have you had the opportunity to watch Joe Biden try to carry/express a thought to completion?
The only reason that I plan to watch the conventions is that I'm expecting both to be a spectacular comedy of technical errors.  If Biden's streams are any indicator, the Team D one is almost guaranteed to come apart at the seams.
They could do virtual debates. Trump would be in Washington, Biden would be in his basement, the moderators would be in New York. One of the debates in 1960 was like that.
Hahaha, I’m joe Biden &amp; I forgot I insulted black folks. Not only that I was never ASHAMED of the Mass incarceration Bill; remember African Americans are not socially &amp; “mentally developed” he believed they belong in jail like heynas. Don’t vote JOE!
Oh man, but Trumpypoo said in his sensationalized, overproduced smear ads that Biden is weak and not fit for office! It’s almost like he was trying to divert attention away from his own failing health. 🤯
As another lifelong Republican, I like you am supporting Biden and the Democratic Party 100% with money and my vote! The Republican Party is a disgrace and should all be voted out of office for undermining the rule of law and supporting Trump’s actions.
As I understand, intel says a Russian agent in Ukraine is feeding bogus info on Hunter Biden to the committee Johnson chairs. No mention of Lindsey. Not quite the same as “being Russian agents.” I think they’re traitors to the bone, but let’s not get in front of the evidence.

YES,SOMETHING SMELLS. THE LIE HOUSE MUST BE FUMIGATED N THEN FUMIGATED N THEN FUMIGATED AND trumps REPULSIVE STINK MIGHT BE A LITTLE EASIER FOR BIDEN TO HANDLE WHEN HE ENTER INTO THE WHITE HOUSE AFTER WINNING THE 2020 ELECTION. THAT, BIDENS,WIN, WILL SMELL SO SWEET
We have huge problems in this country right now...Biden’s gaffes do not fall into the category of a problem. 🤨
Here is the fact. Biden will select the person who he thinks will help him win the election. I’m completely satisfied with all of the women currently on the short list. I’ll support whoever is selected. That said I prefer Sen Harris.
I hope he gets a pardon from President Biden.
Read this whole thread. I’m not going to comment on the content, but simply that Joe Biden does not write his own tweets lol.
Biden is portrayed as a familiar face and reliable statesman in contrast with the volatile Trump. In reality, he promises to be the most liberal president in history, writes
Willing to lie to Congress. Guess he’s qualified to serve in the trump administration. Vote for Biden and get rid of all of these guys.
I will never understand commentary like this or  If you believe  is a threat to the nation, how can you even consider not voting for  Writing in Mickey Mouse is not good enough.. #Biden #Election2020
I worked for Bernie's campaign and i am a Democratic socialist, but I can see past my privilege to know what 4 more years of Trump will do to us.  I don't like Biden, but we have 2 choices, and Biden will bring a respectable cabinet and jurors with him. We need that.
your thoughts after posting a similar Biden video today? Let's be honest, neither one is a good idea.
All veterans. All Republicans. All in for Biden.
Will Joe Biden finally come out and admit he wrote the lyrics to Imagine?
He’s Joe Biden not John Lennon.Joe Biden-"I just voted to make gay marriage illegal"!
Hey, I just filled out my request for an absentee ballot so I can legitimately mail my vote in. You are a con artist Mr. Biden.
Unlike most potential presidents, no one knows what Biden stands for. He’s the figurehead for a shaky coalition that harbors radical views, writes     Democrats didn’t pick Mr. Biden because he’s moderate, they picked him because he’s weak

Admittedly an improvement for Biden in his raw number. That being said, Biden will win MN by more than he wins WI, I believe.
SO DID BIDEN!
- The so called editorial written by John Eastman is a racist letter to those who think a woman of color, born in Oakland, CA is not eligible to run w Biden. I am deeply offended that you would allow this blatant birther piece in your mag. Disgusting #BoycottNewsweek
Save you my opinions, but this article does a good job summing up where I (huge Warren and Sanders supporter) stand on the Biden/Harris ticket.
Consensus-building and ability to find middle ground were killed off by gerrymandering and unlimited campaign contributions made through anonymous shell companies.  Be great if team Biden fixed that. But entrenched, self-serving GOP &amp; Dem partisans killed off earlier efforts.
… Nobody cares about your opinion, and Kamala Harris will be a great vice president and a great president. She and Biden will really make America great again.
Who will be the actual power behind Biden/Harris really running the country? That’s the true info needed. Dr Jill Biden? Chief of Staff? These concerns make US look like a crummy  dictatorship. NOT WHAT WE WANT FOR OUR NATION.
A preview of Biden’s response to Trump’s animated video last night?
Are you ok with the fact that Joe Biden voted to make gay marriage illegal?
Trust us-Pence has plenty of material to use against Kamala.  Between her and Joe Biden they sent tens of thousands of African American males to prison needlessly.  And I want to hear her defense of Joe Biden voting to make gay marriage illegal.
You think Kristol has beclowned himself to the max, and he proves you wrong.  Did Joe McCarthy run for President against Truman? Did Robert Welch run against Ike? No.  But Bill will ride the Good Ship Biden into the water, confident his "conservative" donors will rescue him.

Indeed. Trump wants Biden to get out in public for his friends the Russians to assassinate him. He has been provoking him (basement attacks)
Kamala Harris has more experience than Trump has in his pinky 👉🏼. Are we a little shaken ??? It’s a pretty solid choice that will help Biden considerably ✊🏼.  I can hear the whispers and doubt brewing 🤔
Y’all think it’s a coincidence Crime Bill Biden chose Mass Incarceration Kamala? Dems will tell you Trump is a racist but look at ticket’s track record. We are screwed.
Gosh, apparently Biden needed to seek advice from Trump: "Kamala Harris is the meanest, most horrible, most disrespectful, MOST LIBERAL of anyone in the U.S. Senate, and I cannot believe that Joe Biden would pick her as his running mate."  (Trump e-mail)

My head just freaking exploded from Biden’s Lies!
Good thing you like her since she’ll be POTUS. Biden won’t remember who she is by November.
But smear ads that center around Biden’s failing mental state aren’t nasty...makes sense to me.
i am closer to biden ideologically than jorgensen so no thanks
If I were to vote it would be for Biden.  Trump is a liar and a divider.  So is Biden and he might be senile, so I might just be sitting this one out my Lloyd!!!  Minnesota will go blue I am pretty sure so I am just a human in this state
Trump or Biden tweet it to me
There’s a lot of fundamentals (and 22% uncertainty) built in.  Someone else pointed out that as the election gets closer, if things remain the same, Biden’s chances will increase.  If that’s true, I can understand why the model is where it is right now.
So all Trump campaign has is name calling.  All they have otherwise they'd have to bash policies the majority of Americans favor.  Oh, so they'll go with extreme policies that Biden/Harris don't even believe in.  Name call &amp; scare ppl.  I'm going to hate the next 80+ days.
.I am. I think she'll be a bad candidate for #Biden and the #Democrats. I know he had to pick a black woman, but I didn't expect her. She's a loser.
Has Biden recently turned Catholic? I’m curious as to why it’s trending now when he’s probably been a catholic this whole time? It’s just political season so anything goes I guess, I’m surely excited to vote now. 😒
Think of it this way, Nate’s model has Biden winning 93% of the time if the election were held today, Elliot’s is at 88%.  Slight variation.
Here we go! So happy that VP Biden picked Kamala Harris! I am energized!
Joe Biden has a racism problem alright - but he's going to beat it in November.
Indeed. Biden is "American centre" in my opinion, which American left is basically actually centre, so things are all backwards ;-;
I want to start by saying I'm not for Biden/Harris  However, if it is just a comparison of "lesser of two evils", yea Biden/Harris is probably better than Trump/Pence. But we will still be in a shit place with Biden/Harris in place
I am meh but still going to vote Biden
Or maybe they figure no one can possibly hide it any longer. It isn't as if Biden's breakdown is obscure.
The Biden-Harris Ticket
China will provide massive vaccines to the USA as soon as Biden gets elected this Nov
Lies and fear-mongering. That’s all you got. Biden and Harris will restore hope, dignity, honesty, and democracy. Trump will continue to tear this country apart while he steals from us and lets us die while he plays golf.
I keep seeing repostings of Obama’s endorsement and congratulatory statement to Biden and Harris like thats supposed to mean something 🙃🥴 or we’re supposed to be relieved. He was symbolic (which is fine) in the same way Kamala being VP is (also fine). Both moderate af lol.
If you are reading this  stay clear of Biden’s nursing home.  #CuomoKilledGrandma
#CuomoKilledGrandma Better run Biden ...he’s after your age bracket!!!
Lots and lots of grandmas and grandpas.  Come to think of it Biden should be terrified around this crowd.      stay away from Joe’s nursing home dammit!!!!
She is certainly qualified at 55.  Can she garner the votes Biden needs for the win?
Nice try, At least Trump has better taste  than Biden.  #TaraReade.  Yuck.  Biden should pay her btw .
Our Republican President couldn’t believe that Biden wasn’t vengeful for her questioning him during debates. Thanks VP Biden for being a bigger person!
#bidenharris The Democratic Coalition — Donate via ActBlue
And the Biden family too got rich, hmm hows Hunter and his crack pipe doin’ nowadays.
...To another 4 years of Trump. After Gabbard exposed Harris for her hypocrisy she's going to drag Biden down worse than he's doing on his own.
STRONG TICKET. I CANNOT BLV KANYE IS.STILL RUNNING, SAYING HE’L TAKE VOTES FROM BIDEN
Biden was a senator for a long time and is known as a super genial, get along guy. He’s going to want to work with the other side and make deals. What Trump should have done.
Donald Trump gave us four principled clemency grants (Johnson, Munoz, Hall &amp; Negron) and the 1st Step Act, which is more than people expected given his prior statements. I hope and expect that Biden will use clemency- and you should hope so, too.
Also, I think many of Biden's cabinet positions should be filled ASAP. Put a killer team together to take down Trump and begin the process of recreating the American Dream with decency and equality for everyone!
I guess she no longer believes Biden’s accusers
Damn skippy! Fuck 45. Join me in supporting Help defeat Donald Trump and elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris via
Biden ass wants that black vote bad af i see.
democrats are so fucking stupid as usual.  I’ll vote for biden because he’s not trump- but kamala is hillary level bad.  idiots.
Because both have mixed records on criminal justice, the Biden/Harris ticket needs to take the initiative and talk early, often and specifically about reform. Then, when elected, they need to do it without reservation or deference to the DOJ.
Kamala Harris chosen as the running mate. This is problematic given her voting record and it is not progressive ticket. via
Every time Trump or surrogate talks about Biden gaffes they should just play Trump talking about 1917 flu and it ended WW II.
Biden made the right choice asking Harris to be his running mate. Her debates with Pence should be good.
Biden and Harris will kick your ass.
I fully agree with you  Warren would have been an amazing President or Vice President. I’m hopeful that Biden will put her in a key position. I also think Kamala Harris is an excellent choice.
The average American voter is not ready for the first female Vice President of Jamaican and Indian immigrant parents.  Dumb move on Biden team.  Smh.
Biden has picked Harris to be his VP. This ticket will be responsible for putting more black folks in chains than pre civil war
Biden/Harris 2020!  I'm feeling very positive! :)
Good Choice. Hopefully when Biden wins Sally Yates for AG and Susan Rice as SOS, have Schumer step aside and make Warren Senate Majority Leader. Let's put some women in charge for a change. It seems to work well in other countries.
Personally, Tulsi Gabbard. Nobody I know except for “vote blue no matter who” people like Biden even a little bit, and Tulsi undoubtedly has the power to draw in voters from across the line.  Of course, they wouldn’t have chosen Biden in the first place if they wanted to win.
It’s February 2021.   It is announced that Joe Biden can no longer perform his duties as President, and  takes over as POTUS. #BidenHarris2020
Trump just won a second term. Smh.  Your average American voter is not ready for the first female Vice President of Jamaican and Indian immigrant parents.  Dumb move on Biden team.
Okay honestly folks, Biden isn’t amazing and neither is Kamala but they’re significantly better than Trump/Pence. Like seriously I’m convinced some of you live in make-believe world where you’re still upset your favorite candidate didn’t get the nomination. Come on...
Senator Kamala Harris is Biden's VP pick! Congrats, Senator!
I also appreciate that we know she *can* stand up to Biden when appropriate, as well as be a good teammate and work together afterwards.
BREAKING NEWS: Joe Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate!  #BidenHarris2020
A Harris-Pence debate will be far more interesting, and informed, than any Trump-Biden debate.
YES!! Joe Biden here. Big news: I've chosen Kamala Harris as my running mate. Together, with you, we're going to beat Trump. #KamalaHarrisForVP
If the pick is truly in, Biden should make the announcement ASAP. The longer he waits, the greater the probability that the VP choice will be leaked.
It's almost like Trump is trying lose by even more than he already is among female voters....
Interesting points
Well said. Biden has to pick a VP that will work with him, not the " most popular dance partner".
the VP pick could be Hitler's reanimated corpse and I'd still vote for Biden
Just one of the reasons this #nurse is voting for #Biden in Novemember. #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica
Children Are Not Immune
So-called president drumpf forgets the word virus when he is talking about coronavirus. But yet he says Joe Biden is out of it.
But if Biden picks the wrong VP, amiright?
Do his people really not tell him it’s 1918 not ‘17? Understand that happening one time. We all misspeak. But it’s every dang time. Biden makes an error and fixes it. This guy. Ugh. Is his staff so afraid of his wrath they’re willing to let him embarrass himself over and over?
He promised a woman. We’re getting a woman. Pete is trending because, I believe there was a chartered flight from South Bend to Biden’s regional airport (because, you know, #ElectionTwitter is 👀). Secretary of State offer?
It’s over for Biden.
Who cares if they can do the job.....just make sure it’s a soul sista! Biden is weak he will wilt I’m sure
The only man I would accept as Biden’s running mate tbh
I read someone’s comment that said he’s probably calling everyone in and giving them a face-to-face “Thanks for your participation. It’s not you” talk ..   Sounds like something Biden would do ...
Biden is apparently announcing his VP running mate this week! I won't lie that I'm secretly rooting for Michelle Obama who isn't even on the list!
I DON'T CARE who it is. I'm voting Biden period full stop. Trump is a cancer that needs to go. ❤
Biden’s Choice
you must be completely high or drunk or both. in the last few months, have you had the opportunity to watch Joe Biden try to carry/express a thought to completion?
Only vote for Biden
If you support Trump, please unfollow me. Seriously...I pointed out on a thread (on FB) about Biden having a stutter (aka a disability) and someone used the "laugh" emoji. Really??  REALLY?  Deplorable much?
So Biden comes out of his basement for church and grieving for those lost. Trump comes out of bunker for ego trips and golf. No brainer who the better man is here.
60-40 is actually really good for Democrats in Hartland (I know, I know...yard signs don’t translate to votes). Looks like Trump won 61-32 in ‘16. Honestly, I wouldn’t expect to see any Biden signs out there.
Ok this might be the level of tweet I can expect Biden to have actually sent
They could do virtual debates. Trump would be in Washington, Biden would be in his basement, the moderators would be in New York. One of the debates in 1960 was like that.
Hahaha, I’m joe Biden &amp; I forgot I insulted black folks. Not only that I was never ASHAMED of the Mass incarceration Bill; remember African Americans are not socially &amp; “mentally developed” he believed they belong in jail like heynas. Don’t vote JOE!
Oh man, but Trumpypoo said in his sensationalized, overproduced smear ads that Biden is weak and not fit for office! It’s almost like he was trying to divert attention away from his own failing health. 🤯
I’d pay thousands of dollars for a front row seat at the Bible quiz contest between Joe Biden and Donald Trump! 😂 #TrumpIsNotAChristian #TrumpIsDefinitelyNotEvangelical #SexWithPornStarsIsNotChristian
Joe Biden does not support defunding the  police you dummy
As another lifelong Republican, I like you am supporting Biden and the Democratic Party 100% with money and my vote! The Republican Party is a disgrace and should all be voted out of office for undermining the rule of law and supporting Trump’s actions.
Here’s a new one. My niece said her FIL sent a message to my niece’s daughter, saying that if she voted for Biden, he’d disinherit her. She’ll be a first time voter. She told him to go ahead and do it! 🤣🥰 Proud of her!
As I understand, intel says a Russian agent in Ukraine is feeding bogus info on Hunter Biden to the committee Johnson chairs. No mention of Lindsey. Not quite the same as “being Russian agents.” I think they’re traitors to the bone, but let’s not get in front of the evidence.
Thank you.  I was just going to tweet how this is a further move to dictatorship if EO is allowed to go forward.  If, as I hope, Trump is not re-elected, Biden is going to have a real task in putting the Constitution back together from the shredder.
Peter doocy will be VP running mate.  Biden-Doocy 2020.
Oh please! ODNI has identified Ukrainian Derkach as working with Russia to disrupt the election to elect Trump. You are accepting false information from Derkach to smear Biden in your Senate Committee. Not hard to figure out where you loyalties really lie.
Pray to God Joe Biden wins and we take back the Senate. We'll have to rebuild the State Department and our intelligence agencies. Who knows how many Russian assets are now in the CIA thanks to Trump?
Exactly. Most VP choices are announced just prior to the Convention.  This woman could be President at some point. If they go through rigorous vetting, all the better. A VP is a partner in governance. Regardless of our fave, Biden will need to work w her. It is his call.
Or China is backing up Dumpty's claim that a Biden win means being in cahoots with China, making Biden look corrupt. This is a Through The Looking Glass world now.
Biden isn’t gonna make it-stop obfuscating
This guy is going to make Biden seem out of it?
#QuestionAskedAndAnswered dept.:  I do, because Biden's VP pick is the Democratic Party's real presidential nominee.  #SurprisedIHaveToPointThisOut  #NextQuestionPlease
What? Bobby Trumper Jindal doesn’t like Biden? WSJ why do U even bother? Why do I?
I know whatsboutism is a losing game, but my son and I were saying tonight: imagine if Trump had said one of the things about black people that Biden says regularly.  The media would 24/7 bear Trump to a pulp.
How insulting and condescending to #BlackLivesMatter that the GOP believes helping #Kanye get on ballots will lure black voters to vote for him instead of #Biden.  Act of desperation for sure.
If Twitter calls out fake information then why doesn’t this get flagged as a lie because Biden couldn’t possible send a tweet.  His handlers should have to admit authorship to make this a true tweet.
Do you suppose he's going to challenge Biden to a Thigh-Q test?
Stolen from brilliant  :   Joe Biden: “just pick any black woman.  They all think and act the same anyway”.
We have huge problems in this country right now...Biden’s gaffes do not fall into the category of a problem. 🤨
I hope he gets a pardon from President Biden.
Exactly. I am convinced the "pick is in".  It would be a glorious weekend for many if Biden made his pick known today.
Are we afraid of what the tRump camp might say about Rice? Biden will choose the best woman for VP....period!
Biden is portrayed as a familiar face and reliable statesman in contrast with the volatile Trump. In reality, he promises to be the most liberal president in history, writes
Great strategy: Biden’s supporters are approving Trump BEFORE 03 Nov...
Omg she just throws out my thoughts cause I have maga in my bio. Why y’all do that? It’s not like I throw out your thoughts cause u a Biden supported. I actually listen to what u gotta say. Why everyone do this
The strategy will be ready after this Nov 3rd when Joe Biden gets elected
I mean - what the actual fk?  If  doesn’t make this into an ad overnight, with big $ as drops in major urban areas - he doesn’t want to win.  Easy tag lane. “Joe Biden:  he thinks and says all blacks think the same on every issue”
Never Trump =always Biden and whoever his VP is - soon to be leader of free world and largest economy in the world.  It’s just that simple.

Have to retweet just because the Right gets its jollies from Biden gaffes
Maybe he should go to Thigh land.  What kind of moron continues to try to say Biden is some kind of gaffe machine when Trump is just walking around with his pants around his ankles every day?
You’ve actively listened to trump for the past 4 years and are at a loss at what comes out of BIDEN’S mouth??
I will never understand commentary like this or  If you believe  is a threat to the nation, how can you even consider not voting for  Writing in Mickey Mouse is not good enough.. #Biden #Election2020
BBC News - US election 2020: Trump says opponent Biden will 'hurt God'    JP: God doesn't need Trump to defend Him or His Word
This attempt by GOP operatives to get Kanye on the ballot to dilute the Biden vote is so reprehensible on 2 counts. It smacks of demeaning, racist assumptions about Black voters, &amp; manipulates &amp; exploits a person who is in the midst of a recently disclosed mental health crisis.
Your weaseling claims are all based on stoking up fear. Biden will not take any guns, hes forgot more about the Bible than you have ever known, and he has empathy and compassion for the downtrodden. Words you are totally unfamiliar with. You’ll find words like that in the Bible.
Joe Biden: "most people don't know, unlike the African American community with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community, with incredibly different attitudes about different things"
If a God can be hurt by Joe Biden, is he really a God?
...and once Biden decides on his V.P., who will most likely be a WOC, watch the enthusiasm runneth over!
Seeing VP Biden in action will change a lot of minds!
Good platform for Biden imo
Someone should remind him of that pic of Joe Biden in a church, praying, that his campaign doctored.
yeah kinda funny - all Trumps ads misuse Biden photos where he's actually PRAYING. I've never seen this clown bow his head in prayer.  Yet I still know some evangelicals that think there was a prophecy  saying Trump was called by God to the WH.  Not by MY God that's for sure...
your thoughts after posting a similar Biden video today? Let's be honest, neither one is a good idea.
All veterans. All Republicans. All in for Biden.
Will Joe Biden finally come out and admit he wrote the lyrics to Imagine?
He’s Joe Biden not John Lennon.
Joe Biden is a modest candidate with modest goals:  1: sell a quality platform to swing moderate Rs 2: drain the world's oceans so we can find and kill god
