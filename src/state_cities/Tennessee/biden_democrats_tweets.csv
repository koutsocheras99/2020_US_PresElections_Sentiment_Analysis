Biden is beating the 💩 out of Trump on mail-in ballots.  Majority of people are NOT stupid.
Where the heck are you getting this?    You are 45% &amp; Biden is 48%. LIAR‼️‼️
Biden knows what it takes to be POTUS-His choice will be based on that issue probably more than ever before. I've always been a Kamala supporter. But I have a lot of trust in Biden's decision here. It will be the opposite in terms of vetting, etc from McCain's decision on Palin.
Biden would bring this country into total divide and chaos. He will destroy America as we know it.
Devin Nunes Stays Silent When Asked if He’s Been Handed Foreign Intelligence on Joe Biden  via
That is a beautiful 'Tang! I'm,a Biden supporter also. But I luve in NE TN.....and as a Dem, have always felt safer without bumper stickers. Be very careful.
You are just like #45.  A big LIAR.  Biden is not seeking to defund the police.
President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, both promise sweeping progress over the next four years –- via starkly different paths.
You, little Donny, was posting (not too long ago) that Biden had not stated anything about Covid-19.  This is the job of CDC
As Biden VP pick nears, Susan Rice slams Trump for being soft on Russia's Putin
Harris will steamroll Biden.  He has one one foot in the nursing home.
So you talk 💩 about Biden NOT speaking to news media &amp; answering questions.  When he does, you talk 💩.  He called your bluff &amp; succeeded.  YOU CAN’T HANDLE IT‼️
Yeah and her picks them all even Acosta. Biden handlers make his list and give the reporters parameters of what they can and can't ask. Plus stop the cameras and interviews when he started going off script...
Lol softball interview, you're hilarious.... Biden gets to pick which reporter to call on and has set limits to questions...
I guess when Biden does the Wallace interview...
Write in  as Presidential nominee and then  could pick  as running mate. Unfortunately the news media selects who are candidates are—remember Trump? Sorry, Biden has had his shot. Anyone else for term limits for Congress and Senate?
#Biden can’t actually rem this tho.
Talkin' about star power!!!!!  Obama and George Clooney to hold virtual fundraiser for Biden
Biden can’t spell “gas”.
But Mrs. Biden may not like your changes!
The Biden strategy is an interesting one. We all know that he’s running so there’s really no need to seriously campaign. He’s just laying in the weeds and letting Trump fail on his own. And it seems to be working.
And what is wrong with Biden reviewing &amp; working with Sanders or anyone on policies?  #45 lets his administration write his policies.
This isn’t Biden’’s America. It’s all...
His staff is so afraid of what Biden will say that their going to attempt keeping him out of any debates. This says it all.
For all Americans and                                JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Satan wants Biden!
Desperate are you?
And where’s the proof that Biden agreed?  Pelosi was in Chinatown bec it is in the USA &amp; have businesses there.  You ruined these tax paying businesses. Hell, she wasn’t in the country of China.
You Dems are id1ots..... talk about someone that talks the talk but can't Walk It is your Empty vessel Joe Biden. He had 8 years to do something and couldn't produce. Not to mention his dementia, vote for him and y'all have driven the last nail into this country.
I don’t think Joe Biden knows the truth about what color his own socks are today!!!!!
It’s funny how biden and Warren are also taking money from those same corporations isn’t it ?? 🤔🤔
Many folks on Twitter have very strong opinions on Biden's choice as a running mate. I urge everyone to read this editorial.
Every single person that supports Biden you search for dirt, mostly lies.  Hope Biden starts doing the same on the Trumps.
What a literal dumb fuck. YOUR president is doing this. Biden would never as he appears to actually respect the constitutional rights of American citizens.Clyburn will take Biden to the White house.  He will be on media along with Obama.  Let's March for our future!
I so hope you are right. I cried when Kamala dropped out of the presidential race. I have been holding onto the hope that Biden will pick her.
had a great article  about Rice being the best choice to insulate BHO &amp; Biden from the Durham investigation and boom just like that this damaging news drops on COMMA LA.   I also think the “accidental” announcement by Politco may have been on purpose.
When eventual nominee Michael Dukakis learned of his staff’s involvement in pushing the plagiarism scandal, they were promptly fired and Dukakis issued an apology to Biden.   It would be 20 years before Joe attempted to run again.
95 Days. Joe’s not an unblemished candidate. There’s gobs of missteps and gaffes over his almost five decades in public service. What’s important: he owns up to his mistakes and learns.  Today’s example: Joe’s first run for President (1988).
Why aren’t they making as much noise about getting info from the State Dept about Biden that was given to Johnson and Grassley?
Biden please choose Kamala Harris!!! #KamalaHarris #KamalaHarrisForVP
choosing Karen Bass for VP would be a HUGE mistake. Her past working with the Venceremos Brigade in Castro’s Cuba will bring on the GOP calls of “Socialism” that seemed to go away after Biden won. #BidenVPChoice #KarenBass
Well, if Biden wins you’re gonna be pissed off within 1st 100 days. I look at it this way, not one President in my lifetime has cared as much as Trump. Sure he has faults , but doesn’t every person on earth?! Biden cannot and will not get us back on our feet. He’s made that clear
Why not poll Biden supporters on same question? since, ya know they didn’t accept 2016 results, weaponized FBI &amp; IC to spy on rival campaign in attempt to take out duly elected POTUS &amp; obstruct peaceful transition of power.
It’s not the mail Josh. You know that. The mail is metaphor for the same democrats that have been wasting time trying to eliminate this president since before he took office. Starting with Obama/Biden spying on his campaign. Wait, you’re not paperless Josh? I am. Bad liberal.
Yes they will show up in record numbers and Joe Biden will be our new president.
Yes and in a short time he will be delivering his congratulatory speech to Joe Biden.  He is so done
You know that strategic activism has been *proven* to work, right? Which is exactly what orgs like  have been doing. That’s why  had a seat at the table on Biden’s climate team, and thank God she did.
Didn't Biden say that same thing to Charlemagne ??
Biden winning will empower the rioters to go in for the kill.
They're psyched to retool for Biden's VP pick when they can go full misogyny. It worked before! 😡
Maybe next time ask the question without sounding like you're making a big deal about him not being there. Perhaps say, "I'm curious about Biden not being there."
Yes a few! They are not vocal but they told me they won’t vote for him again. A lot of evangelicals. Not voting for Biden either, but IDK at least it’s something to not vote for trump.
They have dementia drugs for this...   Joe Biden in Latest Brain Freeze: 2020 Census 'Now Two Censuses Ago'  via
it does when some ppl may see this and think why Biden isn't wearing a mask in this video.    i'm just a stickler for correct information and timeline info.
Biden would laugh at being called a tomato can because he isn’t an egotistical narcissist unlike 🍊🤡
Or how about ‘under the bleachers’ which Biden claimed he would beat up Mr Trump?
The 2016 election was the most FRAUDULENT and INACCURATE in history.  It still is a great embarrassment to the USA!  Let’s speed up election 2020 so that you may go away!  #Biden #thursdaymorning #Biden2020Landslide #ToodlesTrump
Voter fraud...  Yeah!  That’s the ticket.  #Biden #thursdaymorning #TrumpKnewAndDidNothing
He got this wrong, too. "Biden instead accused the president of trying to make it harder for people to vote by mail by defunding or otherwise hindering the Postal Service’s operations."
Qualified doctors have cleared Biden from having dementia.  Stop spreading lies.  Joe is a good man with a big heart.  The opposite of the Donald
Well, we will see. If Biden debates.
Barr’s Testimony May Have Revealed Another Obama-Biden Scandal
Gotta keep it going to justify Biden staying in hiding. That way Obama gets a third term.
Can MS Obama please be the VP just for a little while? Maybe a year or two? That would seal the deal for Biden. We can’t take chances now. Trump and the  are going to cheat. 🙏
I dont want Biden
Biden voter
On the up side, Comma La will render the Monica Lewinsky position obsolete in a Biden Administration.
You left out that it’s so much easier to cheat that way. We know what you mean Joey. #Biden
Media manipulation is all about emphasis. Why is *this* something Biden chose to highlight? It’s a straight GOP talking point.
Carlson: Big Tech Engaging in Censorship on Coronavirus to Help Biden
Well, well, well. Biden strikes again!!
He passes by the teleprompter to look at the guy! BTW there are 2 teleprompters .
Good luck with that if Biden gets elected! Just remember you voted against your own well being
I actually agree with your reasoning.  Biden and Congressional sweep will lead to overreach.   Grid lock is underrated.
We love you, Vice President Biden!
Joe Biden has not had an original thought his entire career!
This is just for laughs😂 Joe Biden is and has always been... you obvious are not successful in “TV” if you could not see today for what it was.
Oh really!!? Joe Biden cannot answer simple questions without reading from a teleprompter.  My favorite no teleprompter moment “We believe I truth over facts” or “ We believe these truths to be self evident you know the THING!” “ keep the record player on at night”
Biden was given questions by reporters so he could answer the questions from a teleprompter! You cannot be serious!
Joe Biden was given the questions prior to the news conference so he could read answers given to him by other people on a teleprompter! PATHETIC!
Joe Biden was given the questions prior to the news conference so he could answer questions given to him by other people on a teleprompter!
Joe Biden was given the questions prior to the conference so he could read the answers from a teleprompter!
Yes! Biden is the one with problems! Trump does NOT get questions beforehand and does not use a teleprompter to answer.
There were no tough questions they were given beforehand so he could respond with answers from a teleprompter! This man has no idea what is going on! Go review the video
He was reading his answers from the teleprompter! He walked over because he could not hear this was embarrassing!
Joe Biden just did a press conference where he was given the questions beforehand so he could answer from a teleprompter! YOU CANNOT BE SERIOUS!
The media giving Joe Biden the questions beforehand  so he can answer from a teleprompter is UNBELIEVABLE!!!!
What we are watching from the media is SHOCKING! They are giving Joe Biden the questions beforehand so he can read the answers off a teleprompter! Scary! This man CANNOT be President!
Are you watching this press conference with Joe Biden!? This man cannot answer a question without a teleprompter! Can you believe our media is going along with this??! THIS IS DISGRACEFUL! The media submitted the questions beforehand so he could read off a teleprompter!
I agree with you, Cheri.  In ‘non-Trump’ polls (😁) it shows Biden w/healthy leads. however, the Dems cannot afford to rest &amp; miss opps to speak to the issues. They also need to be sure to be fighting &amp; not letting  ,  , etc. do it for them.
Watching mold grow on bread has more energy than a Biden speech.
Biden is reading from a TELEPROMPTER! Biden cannot answer questions impromptu they are given before so answers can be loaded into teleprompter. ARE YOU KIDDING!!!!??? Be serious!
You mean "Hiden Biden" Please you are a bad joke.
House Judiciary Republicans: Democrats Hate Bill Barr for Exposing Obama-Biden Abuses

The thought that Joe Biden needs another opinion poll or Zoom call to pick a VP is pretty indicting. You’ve had 4 years, dude. Make a decision.
Charlemagne proved who he was when Interviewing Biden by allowing Biden to disrespect him. He ain’t no God...
Give me a break...at one point Biden had 19 very committed supporters watching him on line😆
President Joseph Biden and First Lady Dr. Biden paying respect to the late Congressman John R. Lewis at the Capital today.
perhaps in 1972 when Biden went into politics what he said was truly true.  it ain't true now but he's so far removed from the average person that he doesn't know it.
Ash joined Team Rocket to beat Biden.
I hope we take greater respect for Constitution as well but I also hope we move to codify some of the norms Trump has broken (such as firing IG’s, appointing ‘acting’ officials to skip Senate- &amp; others we now realize hang by a thread.  #TrumpLessonsLearned

JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
They are not Biden supporters, they are paid terrorists out to destroy the USA
HEY BIDEN, is Hunter hiding in the basement with you?
Biden can't even identify which of his fingers is the pinky finger
Were you &amp; your accountants watching Trump economy? Historic until pandemic.  Look at NYC slaughterhouse - that’s COVID19 under Biden.  Have you seen Chicago violence? That’s criminal justice under Biden.  Have you seen Portland/Minneapolis? That’s every USA city under Biden.
I skip them as soon as I can. Most that ive seen are about Biden wanting to defund the police etc.
WARNING: Biden is getting a smaller percentage of the Black vote than Hillary did.
YES! You have to win within the system you have, even if you don't like the system. It's 100% guaranteed Joe Biden will win the popular vote in November, but it doesn't matter if he doesn't matter if he doesn't win the necessary number of electoral college votes.
More people watch Tina’s videos than Biden’s live-streams. Let that sink in. #MAGA2020Landslide
1. This suburban woman is not a housewife 2. You really gonna capitalize that like it’s a club? 3. We know what you’re trying to say. “Privileged white women better watch out, Biden is gonna let the POC invade your neighborhood. Not me. I’ll keep them in their place.” 😡
The hope I have is the independents who voted for Trump in 2016 are willing to gladly vote for Biden this year. They are sick of Trumps lies tweets and I bet some FL and TX GOP voters don’t care to die for our dictator in chief. GOP who lost family to covid19 might be anti Trump
“Who is this Biden guy I keep hearing about?” - Joe Biden
What does the city Mayor have to do with it? We have a Republican President and this is happening now. How does a Democratic President change that?   It just continues for the next 6 months while Trump gives Mariano a reach around and then it’s Biden fault, is that the play?
for the past 4 years?
burning down a statue of an elk is not protesting.  but portland has had these shthole ppl for years.  this has nothing to do with police brutality or racial harmony. this has to do with power and taking over.   these ppl are thugs.
Major league sports are controlled by the New World Order. They are all backing Biden and BLM.
Biden is a creepy racist and tgr american people are fooled thats why and we can let China own America under Biden #ImVoting4BidenBecause
Your going to ruin this country.  It will be a rigged election.  Our country is doomed with BidenA 3rd party vote isn't a vote for Trump or Biden.  A 3rd party voter wasn't going to vote for either of those 2 anyway.
Does Trump realize all our troops that are not home do Mail in ballets? This man is not right!!! He’s just not!! I live in Memphis Tenn. in the SOUTH &amp; a Democrat! Alot of the South are REPUBLICANS I WAS until Barack Obama &amp; from then on DEMOCRATE. You have to win Mr. Joe Biden!
For who tho? Bc Biden is literally no better
I will vote Biden
Apparently the “timing of the Zoom” only hinders Biden
Vote Biden 2020 trump is fired
Yes vote Biden 2020 and get rid of traitor trump
Extreme Embarrassment to our country &amp; the rule of law.  Dems call a lynching without a rope - almost as dumb as a candidate for Pres without a brain. Why would Dems ever put this in Nadler's hands? Or worse, in Biden's?
Biden will help us trump is killing us
So if Biden wins, Harris becomes our new President - just let that soak in for a moment - then either stay home or go vote for Trump.
I am voting for Biden
Biden just said today he would lock down every state until Covid is gone. He is crazy!
Too easy? Where has Biden been? Not answering questions, avoiding press, trying to remember he’s running for office. All’s well. I hope you guys are all staying safe.
just thinking about how my uncle said “they should have gone with joe biden” in 2008 and now he’s a diehard trump supporter
That's Joe Biden touching children on Camera. Sick Joe Biden.
Joe Biden, don't know what day it is...(lol)
The election is not going to trend. Once you drag old man Joe Biden. I laugh every time I hear how far Joe Biden is leading you in the polls. You can't live in the basement and be the president.
Kamala has been going around the country like Flo-Jo ever since she dropped out of the race. Creating bills and advocating for Joe Biden. She deserves respect!
Some people do not need to bring up such pettiness. Do we need a dictator (Trump ) or do we need a person that is compassionate &amp; WON’T let our Unite States be destroyed like it is being done today! Yes we need JOE BIDEN to run our country ( AMERICAN ) !!!
AMEN AMEN!!!  We need someone named Joe Biden!!
I hope Kamala Harris is Biden VP
I did. Never in my life have I. This time I did. Chip in to elect Joe #Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
Biden shouldn't do anything to distract from Trump destroying himself.
Basement Biden, still in hiding and ducking interviews. America will not tolerate a coward as President.
Biden, what a joke. He is afraid to do an interview withChris Wallace. If he can’t handle this, he can’t handle being President.
This is what happens when Biden’s news source is CNN 🙄🙄
I don’t.  Biden is comfortable enough in lead that he will go for the safe choice. But he can’t go with a moderate white woman, because that would be a bridge too far.  Harris has high levels of support in Black community as a whole, it’s the younger voters against her.
we must defeat trump at all costs, the worst president of all time, the source of all evil etc etc etc, but can anyone actually tell me *policy* prescriptions (not platitudes like “he believes in sCiEnCe!!) of biden’s that would change the state of things AT ALL
the real story is that biden’s team of advisors is made up of ‘90s welfare reform sickos who reinforced this arrangement and wouldn’t run it any differently!
We all will be able to relax when Biden starts fixing what trump messed up
Yes no longer trust it until trump is gone and Biden fixes it
School Choice! Economy! US Manufacturing and Pharmaceutical Companies! Basically, what he has been trying to do, without the help of Congress...and just keep preaching how Biden has been in office half a Century and has done nothing!
Something known only to Joe Biden.
“Beat Biden Off” ...Not the image I wanted 😭
Yes Biden 2020
Careful - if Biden is elected, his VP will be President within a year.
It's the folks propping up Biden who really want suburbs turned into ghettos. People like AOC, Booker, Pelosi, along with many others. It's disgusting. They want everyone else to live in poverty while they remain rich. That's socialism.
Obama didn’t endorse  PUBLICLY until later because he didn’t want to sway anyone’s opinion!! There’s people that didn’t like Obama but would support Biden.    is smart. Unlike trump who doesn’t seem to understand political strategies.Yet he’s the president?
Do we really need to read about Biden's fantasies? What a 💩brain..o wait that's to high a level of intelligence..what a 💩face.
Trump doesn't give a Damn about our Veterans. But, Joe Biden does!! #JoeBidenForPresident2020
So Biden chooses to ignore Woodrow Wilson and LBJ?  Both Democrats.  And how about himself?  He is also quite the racist, is he not?
How pathetic Biden hides in his basement from America. He is scared to come out because he might screw up. He lets his campaign aides write his tweets he is only to glad to plagiarize.
And you know this how, Jack. You're not a neurologist, but an eye doc by training. So what qualifies YOU to cast such a medical opinion. Thought you were talking about #SleepyJoe Biden, actually. Your shoe fits that iteration...Trump stepped off Air Force One in Tampa today (Friday), walked to a lectern and painted a dark picture of America that would be overrun by terrorists, gangs and China if former Vice President Joe Biden is elected in November.
I used my personal email address to sign up for mailing lists for both Biden and Trump. I get very few from Biden, but multiple emails a day from Trump. What’s your experience with campaign email?
So many would be investigated. We can’t let this ride if biden wins.
Clyburn will take Biden to the White house.  He will be on media along with Obama.  Let's March for our future!
It appears this might be Biden’s VP pick
No . . . I'm voting Biden/Harris as I planned.
I feel like Biden is getting in his head that he’s like the new Obama when really he’s just the “not a racist orange monster” candidate
Feigning enthusiasm for Biden’s impending VP announcement or really anything Biden related
Please follow the Biden Republicans! They deserve our support!!
ok i heard this somewhere today and it  put into words perfectly why i'm half heartedly voting for biden: unless the screwed up electoral system we have is going to be dismantled by november, he's the only option
Well, I don’t think we’re getting a Biden/Bass ticket
I dream of a world where Biden picks the person he thinks us best and everyone shuts up and votes for the ticket. Otherwise, we will all die very soon.
My favorite game is without naming Donald Trump, name a good reason you’re confident about voting for Joe Biden.
The fact that Biden helped to draft the War on Drugs and 1994 Crime Bill causing millions of poor Black and Brown people to be imprisoned for non-violent drug crimes, STILL believes marijuana is a gateway drug and refuses to legalize marijuana is not propaganda.
When he decided to vote for Biden.
Haha, Joe Biden can’t string together a sentence so of course it would be better than his ad.
Memaw, I invited Trump &amp; Biden last night, so you and Jerry are more than welcome to head this way.
I’m glad President Obama never did anything like this.  VP Biden will not allow this when he becomes President.
Does it cost that much for Biden to virtually appear?  Wow.
Maybe Biden ate one
I will be voting Biden.  i will not vote 3rd party because the way the system is currently set up a 3rd party candidate can not win
Maybe joe Biden are one
Trump is trailing for lots of reasons, but a big one is because every time he opens his mouth something insane, false or idiotic comes out.   Biden does better the less he speaks. This isn’t a compliment, but...   MEN: look how far just shutting the fuck up can get you.
Biden will only turn America into Portland. Enjoy that
Was breaking in or I was being attacked. I wish there was a better option against trump but Biden’s what we’ve got and I believe he is the best option for getting us out of this pandemic that trump has done little to help. I’m a nurse and I am tired of it and seeing our leader...
But Hunter Biden!
If Joe Biden wins, here are some of the top foreign-policy experts who could be tapped for senior and midlevel jobs in the administration.
It was you who did it. Just look at all the damage, look around you and see what you've done. Shame on you! Things will change in November. Biden 2020.Step  aside let the big boys handle things.
You dolts called Mitt Romney a Nazi while having Biden say he was gonna lock black people back in chains. I think you should look in the mirror to find who actually causes the civil discourse.
First 5 minutes of your CBS Nightly “News” paid for by Joe Biden for President.
Because somebody, one of my chapter bruhs, said that Biden is using Bernie’s plan and that was incorrect.
It was Joe Biden at a press conference.
Still haven’t learned how to spot a bot yet, I take it? Y’all never were smart. The same posts are made on Biden’s page, ass hat.
I definitely see evidence of an 'enthusiasm gap' here. Trump's death cult will literally throw themselves into a funeral pyre for him. Biden supporters, not so much.
I don't know what makes you think Biden isn't pro police state.
#JoeBiden only needs to win 3 battleground states to defeat #Trump – and he's leading in all 6 ...
Still more than Joe Biden can muster. Of course Joe won’t be the nominee anyway.
I'd imagine this the constant debate in the Biden camp. If you pick one of the well-known national stage Democrats, then you'll make it way easier to attack which is a problem when you're campaign strategy has basically just been Joe Biden being boring.
Trump, stuff it with another hamburghur. Biden has honor, years of service and integrity. You have a multibankrupt failure of a company, a failed presidency, a morally bankrupt soul. This country knows Biden. Now we unfortunately know you too. All too well. Go away.
Bull! Trump has done more for Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and women than Obama/Biden did in 8 years. That's a fact!  Democrats want to keep poor people poor, so they can control their lives by keeping them dependent on the Government! Government Dependcy = Less Freedom.
Gotta make sure Biden has the option of pardoning him if he gets elected.
Biden voters?
Florida Teen Behind Mass Twitter Hack Including Kim Kardashian, Joe Biden, Arrested:

After Biden is sworn in I’m going sleep for a week. But I will never again take our democracy for granted.
Biden was VP and normal people don’t know much about him besides that he was VP - no one gives a damn about the VP assuming they’re at least mediocre
This is a PSA:  JOE BIDEN IS USING KAMALA HARRIS’ HBCU PLAN!  We see you  😂 #KamalaHarrisForVP
There is little evidence that who he picks as VP will change the outcome as this is more an election against Trump opposed to for Biden.  However, Warren has consistently polled better with the majority of Black voters and young progressives. If the argument is who Black voters

at the  once mocked Biden's prediction Trump would try to move the election. He now gets it, calling Trump's suggestion "the single most anti-democratic statement ever made by a sitting President." Now we get the warnings from former officials.
What would happen if Ghislaine Maxwell released footage of both Donald Trump AND Joe Biden having sex with underage girls?
Florida teen arrested in Twitter hack that hit Biden and Obama
Two party system and my favorite candidates, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, aren’t running any longer. A vote for an independent candidate is a vote for Trump at this point. Soooo it’s gonna be a Biden.
This is a nonsensical perspective in my opinion. Best choice for president. Biden commits to one term setting up VP to be the next president. Then doesn't choose who the best choice for president is. That logic doesn't follow...this isn't a race for VP but for 2024.
Assuming Biden sees the existentialist need to extend FDR's first 100 days to two years -- we are that far behind the eight-ball -- he'll must kill the filibuster to have predictable maneuvering room.  Schumer did well as a place holder, but he's not a wartime leader.
On my best day, can't give you Texas [although Biden may take the state], Kansas, unless Kobach wins primary, and one of GA -- and the other is tenuous. So . . . it's up to Schumer, an admitted institutionalist . . . except McConnell has controlled the US for 8 yrs by filibuster.
the world is laughing at you. Not up their sleeve or behind your back. To your face. Your landslide loss November 3 will be hysterical worldwide. Then the day after Biden is inaugurated, you will be irrelevant again. #Biden2020Landslide
If you’re a joe Biden supporter open this thread
Are Biden's promises any more reliable than Trump's? (Considering how extensively Biden has lied about his past.)
You’re delusional. Bernie supporters will not vote for you!  And Biden is not close to being as progressive as Bernie.
in my very own opinion, this is a really dumb take  if you think Biden is as bad as trump then I guess we will have to agree to disagree  splitting your vote to vote for someone who 99.99999% won’t win is pretty much a vote for trump, so have fun with that
Imagine being a Democrat and thinking that Joe Biden will beat Trump this fall. People are sick and tired of the political games. Fauci is a ding dong, pass it on!
Interesting! Will you be voting for Biden? I don’t know many republicans that have defected from the trump camp.
And if Biden drops in the polls she'll be blamed.
Biden is a transition candidate. He is trying to choose someone younger and that wants to POTUS. Susan Rice isn’t it. I think she would be a fine VP but Harris is the obvious choice.
text “NOMORE420” to vote for joe biden
anyone who grew up in the 90s knows the media tried to cancel him many, many times
Three months til the election. My dad is still a staunch republican but his support for trump is cracking due to the pandemic. If there’s the slightest chance I could get him to vote for Biden... is it worth trying?
What a difference a year can make! We saw this happen during Obama/ Biden Here it is again - reflections of societal values  Welcome #Boomers to a new "tweener" stage - too old for livable wage job, too young to benefit from their own monies paid into SocialSecurity #AmericaFirst
Your tweets are the funniest! Thanks Biden. Loved the laugh 🤣 today.
Pompeo hit with subpoena after he’s caught assisting Senate GOP’s political smear of Biden #SmartNews
Biden can barely stay awake
No the point is: you cannot criticize Kamala for doing her job of enforcing laws that she didn’t create, without the required context that Biden authored the very law that enabled mandatory trivial prosecution of Black and brown folks.
Put another way, Rice brings to the campaign the full baggage of Benghazi, Russiagate, and doubles down on Obama-era foreign policy. And I tend to agree with  on  podcast, her lying really does matter. Idk if all that is worth the trouble for Biden
The thing about the Susan Rice chatter for Biden’s VP slot is this: Benghazi would certainly play into it, but people seem to forget the unmasking issues surrounding Trump. DJT would focus more on unmasking than Benghazi, bc one involves him and the other doesn’t.
I'm scared for the delusional people that believe Biden is any better and think we can all just go back to sleep if gets in office.
No one is gonna switch their vote from Biden to Ye. Chill.   Trump is done no matter who runs. Guys a goddamned disaster.
The difference is that Kamala is the frontrunner. They have to gun for her.   Also, if Biden didn’t author the 94 crime bill, Kamala wouldn’t have had that to enforce as a prosecutor.

Biden's plan is a "form of M4A." Anyone who want to can sign on for the public Medicare option. I think some Berners think destroying the entire health insurance industry is even more important than giving everyone the healthcare they want.

Lmao u think Biden will win
So Joe Biden is running a campaign where he is offering virtually no answers or solutions from a selective group of reporters......then expects to debate President Trump live on stage about real American issues that the President has actually been fighting for?
I don’t maintain the DNC is good or bad I just know I don’t want Donald trump to be president so I will be voting for Biden  he wasn’t my first.... second.... or third choice but he’s the only one with a chance to win on the ballot in November and that’s my #1 goal

It’s not a stretch to see Biden as a Trojan horse for another candidate to get nominated when he drops out for medical and health reasons(VP choice). The DNC couldn’t get their preferred candidate thru actual voters so this is what they are doing.
I always wondered how someone like Joe Biden can become mega-rich on a meager government salary.  This is the reason.  We need a revolution.
You probably believe in Russian Collusion too ,that Obama and Biden didn't spy,  and they didn't plot a coup.
There's no evidence on Monica's blue v dress either.
Of course they will be humbled and silenced.  Look at Tara Reade about the Biden charges.  She's disappeared.  And let's not forget many on the left openly admitted they thought she was truthful and they said they'd support Biden, anyway.  Truth is nothing to the left, only POWER
Biden = Unity Trump = Division That's a winning strategy.  Repeat. Repeat. Repeat.  #biden2020 #Biden #Trump #Trump2020
I feel like I'm going to regret replying, but here goes. Many people who support BLM and defunding the police often only support Biden because he is not Trump. He will not make the substantive change we are looking for. The election will not end the movement.

Biden is a half eaten doughnut
A small group of us have been hearing #SusanRice as the top pick for Biden’s VP.  As time comes closer, for the announcement, the far right already have a target on her.
I’m old enough to remember when you called Joe Biden a racist because it was last year. Now you want to be his VP?
Attempting to cover-up Joe Biden's long history of racism and serial abuse is a bad look Adam.
I also like your "what we know" phrase - it's a common fake news phrase. It never has any back-up, it's just a very effective tool in mind control. It sets you up as being out of the norm if you don't believe what they are saying is true.
Who gives a crap, facts are facts, anything beyond that is needlepoint circle gossip.
Why would he tell CNN or any liberal MSM anything? They’d just help Biden cover it up.
Not a "story" it's backed up with documentation from Mar-a-Lago records and Palm Beach Police report.
Epstein was a member at Mar-a-Lago country club as is most of Palm Beach. These are just photos from country club member events.
The minute he found out about that, Trump called the Palm Beach Police Dept on Maxwell and Epstein as well as revoked their membership from Mar-a-Lago.
Additional federal aid is necessary to reopen schools and ensure economic recovery, former Vice President Joe Biden told teachers Thursday, slamming a COVID-19 relief bill proposed by Senate Republicans.
Look at this slinky sumbitch is over there dressed like a genie acting like he's sittin' pretty in Tetris city, refusing to negotiate about his Choose-Your-Adventure missile batteries. I can imagine you and Biden taking shots of Similac and tryin to put one of em together.
Barack Obama has spoken candidly about President Trump to party donors, bringing up the sexual assault allegations against Mr. Trump and warning of his efforts to push “nativist, racist, sexist” fears.
One thing Trump has going for him is that his out-of-touch campaign consultants are quite a bit less out-of-touch than Biden’s.
Bet he'll resign once Biden drags his dumb ass through the ringer BIGLY after the first debate.
You really think Biden will be on the ballot in Nov.? Lmao
If you love child trafficking, vote for Joe creepy Biden.
You are 100% right! But only because you will never make it to your inauguration. Your senility will cause your disqualification. So, after Obama speech today, my money for Biden VP is either Susan Rice or Loretta Lynch. #obamaneverleft #obamaneveragain
We need to know what  knew —  was Secretary of State, were they covering for Bill and how might a Biden White House be compromised?
Joe Biden floated having a Federal Prosecutor fired for investigating his son's business dealings in Ukraine. Oh guess what the prosecutor was fired and Biden gave $1B of tax payer money to Ukraine as an award.
So Biden didn’t do anything to hurt mfg during his 40 yr tenure? Just Trump in &lt;4 yrs while dealing with the an investigation day one essentially. All on the grounds of collusion with a foreign power from a dossier that was cooked up by the DNC, Clinton, Obama, &amp; Biden. Wake up
You're probably right! But I know Joe Biden didn't! I put my life on that! Barack Obama didn't and I put my life on that too! Anyone else there are up for grabs cuz I have no idea except for Trump we all know that he was there many times with many young girls
Trump fills arenas with cheering supporters and he can speak extemporaneously for an hour or more.   Biden can barely get 20 people in a high school gym, and does good to read off the teleprompter for 15 minutes.   Tell me how Biden has the support and momentum to beat Trump.
But Lobbyist and their money don't interfere  with how they vote 🙄. This is what we will get with Biden administration,and am guessing  these are same ones who voted against Medicare for All and legalizing marijuana?
Too funny you can't even come up with your own sentence you have to use Trump's and alt right nationalist propaganda about Biden!  Trump is a racist! he's always been a racist he shows it every single day to Americans that he's a racist! Anyone who supports Trump is a racist!
Reason enough to vote for Biden
HA. You are going to lose bad,  Major blue wave coming. Biden will win in a landslide
The irony is... it’s the Democrats themselves, in Florida, complaining that Biden is oppressing the Hispanic vote! #LatinosForTrump #POC #VotingMatters
Democratic system, is only interested in one thing? Not Americans, but Biden winning election, that isn't going to happen. His mental health along with dems mentality is in question?
You seriously think the protesters lobbing rocks at police will all go home if Biden is elected? Chicago gun violence will return to “normal”? Police will be respected? Have you not seen this coming for 25 years?

Its better for Dems if Biden keeps quiet as he can’t form complete sentences. The debates will be fun!
I realized during today's Biden campaign event, disguised as a “funeral,” just how wonderful it has been to not see Obama's face on a daily basis.
Good lord, I cannot even IMAGINE if Biden were president right now.... DISASTER.
Whoever is running Biden's Twitter is doing a good job. But..he's our only option, so keep on keeping on.
If he was holding a Biden sign he wouldn’t have got shot
Problem running against a really unpopular guy like Trump is that Dems don't wanna risk *anything* and let him sink himself. But there's so much to take a stand on. Biden needs to start trying to build movement *now*, not after Trump gets a whole campaign tossing shit in the air

That was the FBI predication to get the FISA warrant to listen in on Flynn..Was it Joe Biden the one who suggested using the Logan act?
This is such a load of horseshit from the same Republicans who are bringing you Project Lincoln.  Fuck off
Joe Biden has not said to not open schools. He has said to be guided by the scientific facts and recommendations, neither which our president heeds. He retweets what amounts to a witch doctor’s counsel. Biden will represent moms. Trump only represents himself.
he called Biden a traitor for suggesting --BACK IN APRIL --that Trump would suggest this very thing.
I find it absolutely amazing that anyone with half a brain would vote for Biden. Biden ever climbs out of his bunker and joins President Trump for a face off, game over for slow Joe.
We always knew we'd have to win without the Bernie Brats. So nothing has changed. And the polling is showing that Biden has what the voters want, and we're going to get it done. It's the Berners that are "oblivious." Better luck in 2024 or 2028 bros.
WE NEED EVERYONE TO GO AND VOTE. THIS HAS TO COME TO A END!!!!! BIDEN HAS ALOT A WORK TO DO WHEN HE GETS IN. WE HAVE TO GO AND VOTE!!!!!!
Biden winning will empower the rioters to go in for the kill.
Nope, you’ll lose, then you won’t accept the results. The only thing I have to look forward to this year is replacing you with Biden, which we will. Please accept the results and leave.
Don't back up the election date, stay on course. Biden will fold.
Trump has the White House and a Tower on 5th ave. I live in a house built in 1963 for $10,000. Biden lives in a basement.

Agreed, so start the same structure 3 weeks before Election Day. People need not be confused-Biden is in no shape to debate. I was just giving it the benefit of the doubt. It is very likely should Biden win, he will never be inaugurated. VP pick will tell us all we need to know😬

You don’t think seriously Joe Biden could go toe to toe with Trump on the debate stage do you? Trump would mop the floor with him and you know that, however I can’t speculate because the Dems will never let him debate Trump.

The reason demon #TRUMP want the election delayed, he's hoping a cure to the Coronavirus is found, so he can take the credit, saying look what he has done, just as he's trying to say about economy, when we know Obama and Biden help built the economy he's losing.
I erred. The "Reid Rule" was a different obstruction. I meant the Joe "Biden Rule."  "It would be our pragmatic conclusion that once the political season is under way, and it is, action on a Supreme Court nomination must be put off until after the election campaign is over."

To be fair Biden was completely correct and knew exactly what he was talking about. Eh, though, if there is no election President Pelosi will be inaugurated when Trump's term ends.

W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Trump were all born in the same year. Biden was born 4 years earlier.
If Biden and his successor get 8 year administrations each, it's probable that Obama will become the sole living former President at some point.
So I guess what we’re getting into then is the policy behind it.  The Obama administration never issued executive orders to separate families.  So I’d like the statement to be: Biden doesn’t separate families and hold kids in detention centers for 27 days where some of them die.

I’m not sure even an “October” surprise on Biden would work at this point. People saw how the email scandal messed up Clinton. Folks not falling for the okey doke this time. People are already proving less gullible to Trump theatrics this time around. He’s a sitting duck.
Nah. Once Biden is inaugurated, that’s it. The election will happen. He has no legal authority to stop it under the constitution.

Oh I totally agree with that, I think my problem is that I fail to see how Biden would be much different than Trump, based on his record. I'm voting Green this year
You Democrats that think Trump is “Putin’s puppet” are going to be amazed when you see what  Ventriloquist Vladimir can do with his dummy Biden.... you’ll swear it was Joe talking!
Yes, I would offer to help. Would that elderly person accept my help if I were wearing a Biden shirt?
Biden is wayyy too out there for Suburban families. He will at best win a few Blue urban areas - NYC, Philly, Chicago.

With Biden you get 2-for-1, white lies AND white supremacy.
Yep.  Biden’s election will end national nightmare 2.0
This hypocrisy is toxic. If Biden stated next year that he wanted to spend 1.7 billion on a new FBI building during a pandemic Senator Harris would be praising him for his love, respect, admiration and commitment to our law enforcement officers.
Lanslide? Even faux "news" has Biden destroying trump. It's not a question of Biden winning, it's whether the entire GOP has a future. Enabling Trump was a profound mistake. Staying with him is unconscionable.
Joe Biden is going to pass away from COVID before the election.  Probably before the DNC convention.
The disgusting lust for power is the only remaining remnant in the former corrupt politician known as "Joe Biden". A 77 year old man who has had 2 brain aneurysms and it shows.
I hear Joe Biden mumbles a lot, is that because he's trying to talk while he's sniffing hair?
We better show up November 3 and vote or racism will explode. Vote Biden because he reads!
Lowkey think Joe Biden just gone fall over one of these days and that's just gone be it🤔😭

Kinda feel sorry for Biden in a debate against our President. Biden needs to drop out, but then. Stay, for sure loss.
Pres. Biden will reverse this troop withdrawal on day one, I suspect.
You know I’m not a fan of Joe Biden and I wish we didn’t have to constantly choose the lesser of two evils.  But I’m not going to sit around and act like Trump is some noble man, because that’s far from true. I think Joe has racist history too, so I don’t excuse him either.
When Joe Biden comes up, with a complete plan to help Flint, get clean drinking water and Justice. I might consider voting for him.
If Joe Biden chose Karen Bass as his VP candidate wouldn’t that be proof that he’s a danger to himself and others?

Yes.  quotes  in her book: Nobody’s better than you, but you’re better than nobody. Joe’s mother said this. My mother told me always: treat everyone equally. I want the president that Joe will be. Listen to moms. #NobodyLikesTrump #Biden2020 #Biden
Not talking about demeanor. I'm talking about literal things that have come out of Trump's mouth. For instance, he called out the wrong Kansas City. As a President many people considered that unacceptable. No different than what Biden does in this video.
Do it Biden. Please. My parents are both michigan democrats and think that fat ass has gone too far.

Yea, Biden/Clinton
Fourteen VPs have gone on to be President.  Five in my lifetime.  Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, George Bush, Gerald Ford. (And I've seen two more – Mondale and Gore – become their party's Presidential nominee.) Joe Biden will be the sixth, and fifteenth overall.
Trump’s internals in Michigan are good that’s why Biden is pouring millions into Michigan, if it were going to go to Biden overwhelmingly he would’ve stopped as well, but apparently the Trump campaign feels good about it

Stagflation, which we are soon to experience unless Biden's policies take hold quickly, is deflation by another name . . . in terms of purchasing power and, therefore, discretionary demand.  And, if there is anything that drove old America, it was discretionary demand.
And isn’t it interesting that Escobar was so anti police and isn’t one of the major platforms Biden’s group is defunding police? I’m not saying “ol joe” is an Escobar, but man there is some serious similarities.
To vote Biden in office is a very near equivalent to Pablo Escobar being chosen for congress. Pablo ran as alternate while knowing the primary would step aside allowing him to take over. Is not a vote for Biden an actual vote for his alternative?

Why do you give Biden a pass on the Ukraine?
Oh man. Kamala Cop is too progressive. even more than Bernie! How will Biden deal with his Jephthah complex?
So folks are mad she debated him at a debate (my gawd) by highlighting a historical but poor policy position he took? She was too strategic about her approach? Biden has said the person must be prepared to be president, but *she’s* too ambitious?  Just say the real issue and go.

Something new along these lines coming Friday 😎🎸
That was a campaign add for Joe Biden.
That is funny because all the Republicans I know are voting for Biden &amp; are too smart to fall for the lies of Trump &amp; his administration.  People do not like military force in American cities &amp; used on Ameicans. Using secret police is what dictators do.
Haha. I only meant that you're as likely to convince him to endorse Biden as you are to convince him to shave that thing.   Nevertheless I'm happy that you live in a better America now and can share your experience and wisdom.
Biden says he’s only serving one term.   Shouldn’t his VP pick have that as her goal and become as ready as possible.
So there's a Klan rally in my area? Can't wait to drive through with my Biden bumper stickers.
Biden has pledged to a have a woman as his running mate, so now he has to find someone who wants to be VP but isn’t interested in the presidency?!? Such misogynist trash.

Just leave him in there. It will take years to get all of the Trump stink out of the curtains and clean up all the orange cake makeup from the walls and furniture. Let President Biden run the nation from somewhere else.
By this logic, Obama should not have chosen Biden.
Biden's actions for the left are an improvement over your actions for Russia (and inaction on the pandemic). #TrumpFailedAmerica #TrumpVirus #TrumpVirusKills150K #ImpeachedForever
How do you figure that? Biden says something embarrassing or just plain incoherent every time he opens his mouth.
And it took losing a re-elect for you to do it. Transparency of intent is a thing, you know.   Fuck you and fuck Biden...”choose the lesser of the evil, the devil‘s still gonna win.”
So who is actually running Biden?
I completely get what everyone is saying about Biden and I am not enamored by this candidate either but it the dems put up Mr. Hankey the Christmas Poo out of South Park against Trump, I would vote for him.
Their both apparent pedos, but guess what? Biden doesn’t have literal court documents against him about molestation claims. I may vote 3rd party one thing is for sure he’s no “patriot” he’s just as much a traitor as the others you mentioned. If you’re for America you’re for ALL
Fortunately, the Biden administration can stop it in its tracks.
settle for biden. brace for trump. press three to be connected to FREDDIE FREAKER!!!
That means Biden.
IMHO Buttigieg would be a good VP, but probably if Warren had been the nominee. But Biden should pick Warren. She may have some amount of baggage but she's sharp and can campaign well. Only thing about either of them is that they'd both be one-term. Biden/Warren is a 4 year tckt.
Yeah, many die hard Bernie bro’s hoping to let him live vicariously through Biden and inhabit his brain. Scary af.
No he will check their affiliation with the communist party and other in missions of evil. Joe Biden is nothing more than a southern Democrat and we know what that means what in the hell are people thinking
Don't think she's the right choice if you ask me. Too interested in getting it for the sake of it than because she wants to enact changes. The way she went after Biden early on left a bad taste in my mouth. It was showboating and needless. Stand out with a plan, not attacks.
How odd that no one in L.A. is driving around with #Biden bumper stickers.🤔 At this time in 2016 Hillary bumper stickers were plastered literally everywhere throughout the Westside and SFV. #WednesdayThoughts

Honestly, it reminds me a lot of how I had to lead my 11 yr old daughter around after her brain tumor diagnosis. She had right side weakness. I won’t say harsh things about Mr Biden, but there is clearly cognitive issues happening.He’s trying to cover it up. It’s actually sad.
You mean she'll accept the VP with an eye to running for President afterward, just like...Joe Biden?  Or literally every single Vice President in the last 70 years besides Dick Cheney?

What an ass, every executive order will be reversed by Biden within a couple hrs , start packing.
Great article, although I somewhat disagree with your premise that Biden is a weak candidate. Strength is not an absolute, it’s relative, a point you concede. He’s gaffe prone, yes, but his heart is strong. That’s real strength.
He is completely unhinged. Not only do I prefer Joe Biden, I’d vote for Joe Kelly, Joe Jonas or Joey Lawrence at this point before I’d vote for Trump.
Drug companies paid Obama and Biden to not lower prices and so the Democrats have something to blame/use for the next election year.
"Cities could collapse if Trump wins. Markets could collapse if Biden wins. With 100 days to go and so much at stake, polls will start affecting the narrative of who’s going to win. But if the election matters to your investment outlook, ignore the polls"

Trump has done little to gain new support and new voters. Instead, he is trying to let the Democrats implode. Problem is, both sides are imploding and Trump is the one in charge. Biden could be a pet rock and still be leading right now.

If lunatic fringe conspiracy nut jobs are all the GOP has left, it's already lost. Keep talking, you're an ad for Biden without even knowing it.
First of all using the word stupid with this argument might not be in your best interest. Secondly, Trump’s style is not anger and lack of control but rather humor and wit. Check the Trump- HRC debates, they’re hilarious. Once again, Biden’s handlers will never let him onstage...

Trump is already preparing an executive order to deal DACA.  Looks like he'll beat Biden to the draw on this issue.
Thinking it through some more. If Biden is going with Harris, I wonder if they’ll try to burnish her prosecutorial cred to ward off attacks on the law and order front. Harris wasn’t a clear front runner unless you view it through the lens of the protests.
So. Let’s say it’s Biden-Harris. 47%. Let’s say Trump claws back to 44-45% nationally.  That’s doable in the EC.

Mr. Biden. I was a single, working mom during your 8 yrs. A professional, degreed, Clinical researcher. Your policies crippled medical research, we didn’t get raises for 5 of your 8 yrs, insurance premiums &amp; coverage skyrocketed. Forgive me if I don’t buy your BS.
I will vote for Joe Biden no matter what but the democrats in office seem to be their own worst enemies. We do seem to not perform at the level we need in these public hearings. The election is in Nov I do not believe this investigation was worth the risk.

Opinion | Biden could be a compromiser or a progressive. That choice is mostly out of his hands.

Why does every tweet by Joe Biden come off as an SNL skit?   you cannot even recognize Jill, your wife.  Sir, you need a geriatric cognitive evaluation and adult advocacy care.  We would end up in total destruction if we ever had to count on you.
EXACTLY!  To be honest, I think Trump is a pompous prick and never liked him. I never watched his show and always thought he had a punchable face.  BUT he has my vote for president because he is better than Biden.  He's done some good and a lot of bad, and I'll call him on all.
Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. This is the most important election in history.  And there’s only one candidate. Joe Biden. We can get back to issues and disagreements once we have saved the world from this nightmare.  We can plan November 4th on November 4th.
Getting a little antsy I see, Biden has you by the balls !!
And Biden was his #2.
Bro the majority of the country doesn’t want Biden.. the majority of the Democratic Party doesn’t want Biden..
I truly have not interest in a debate.  What is the value to the voters?  We know Trump will say outrageous, unsupported half-truths and Biden will stumble his way through the debate as if it was intended to really address policy differences.
Major Gold Trader on  said it appears that Biden will win and take the senate with him too. That is an America Disaster.  And he admitted that.
Sadly the "ridin with Biden blue no matter who" crowd still won't get why they're unpopular.  It'll just be more "orange man bad not voting is a vote for fascism" argument.  No incentive to EARN my vote
98 days until we elect  as our President!  1 of the many reasons I am voting for Biden is because he won't allow our enemies to put bounties on our soldiers.  Joe cares about American lives, and will defend us against Russia, unlike Drumpf.  #GoJoe2020  #ONEV1  #OVVETS

Joe Biden has released a statement to clear things up
I don’t personally know one former Obama voter who says they’ll vote for Biden.  Between their lack of support for him and their disgust for Democrats closing businesses but promoting riots, they’ll abstain.  The left made the middle right wing. The vote tally will reflect that.
I think one of the positive things about the long primary is that Biden has been vetted up and down. Can’t really see how anything could hurt him at this point. Seems like Trumps only option is to improve his own margins.
I feel bad for ⁦ and also for ⁦ I do think had he said the opposite position of his ideas pitching for Biden press would call him passionate not manic. Either way I think she loves him. Hang in there!
Has anyone told Biden yet that there was NO Russian collusion?
The fact you are calling Biden a great man shows how dillusional you are.
I hope that one of President Biden's first acts will be to tear it down.
Also, you disingenuous republican, Biden opposed busing too! So if you had any principles, you’d be calling him out as well. But all you care about is making America better for the rich.

Take nothing for granted: if you want Trump out you absolutely must vote in this election. It is absolutely possible Biden could still lose.
How about Biden goes and tells the DNC their platform that drops Medicare for all is a non-starter first and then we’ll talk.
LMAO are you really that stupid to think people didn't see Bidens interview and he did say that plus there is a lot of tape of Biden saying RACIST THINGS remember ENGAGE BRAIN BEFORE MOUTH OTHERWISE YOU SOUND LIKE A FOOL #WALKAWAY #DEMOCRATSFORTRUMP #SILENTMAJORITY
That is because the party who are supposedly supporting them have done nothing for them.  Yep that’s your party Joke Biden. Now you just want to use them again for a vote. I think they are catching on to the Democrats bull shit.

That’s what Joe Biden’s job will be when he defeats you in November !!!
Tennessee. The state will most likely vote Trump, but here in Nashville, I'll be voting for Biden
Ok keep eating that line lol. So if Biden told you that putting a plastic bag over your head prevented Covid-19,  i bet you would try it.
Perhaps you do. Research Biden’s plans for the suburbs. It’s not to build low income housing within your communities, it’s to move you out of the suburbs and the low income/no income people in.
Thats why he is refusing to be interviewed and wont lock in debates. You would think the great Joe Biden, Joe six pack would be asking for as much face time. You are a jokd
I think they are all starting their 2024 campaign. Think of the total mess that Biden will be handed. &amp; to clean it up he will probably have to make some hard choices. Not all America is going to be happy. They are hoping for an epic fail &amp; unhappy America voting republican again
I like them. But I still would rather have Warren as the POTUS not. ... still voting for Biden though. #Biden2020
Give me a break...at one point Biden had 19 very committed supporters watching him on line😆
No, Biden sent the rioters. Don’t insult protestors by calling them protestors
Currently dreading the fact that if Biden wins in November there will be a huge group of Democrats that will think that everything is ok and we can go “back to normal” again and no longer strive for any more changing, let alone dismantling, the system.
🙄 On behalf of the republican party. TY! You had 3.5 yrs to literally pick anyone but a socialist or Biden the communist. you’re spite and hate towards Trump wasted all that time. Now here we are again. just like 2016. Y’all had one Job, so thank you for 4 more yrs
Guess the pedo's don't want Biden groping?
Experience is worthless if he's a complete disaster with little interested other than self promotion. How many of his "best people" have left saying he's completely incompetent? A handful. And those are his own people he chose. I've heard none from Biden's staff.
Well, if you weren’t so knee deep in your liberalism that you actually took the time to learn what a racist Biden has been for much of his career...never mind, you don’t care. Talk about a waste of time.

#3 "“The fact is, the president is out there. He’s out there in this broiling heat with me for an hour, he took all the questions,” Wallace told colleague Bret Baier. “You can like his answers or dislike them, but he had answers and Joe Biden hasn’t faced that kind of scrutiny,"
#2 "Though Wallace interviewed President Trump last week, Biden’s team has said this week the former vice president is “not available” for an interview, feeding into criticism that he avoids press scrutiny.  “We’ll keep asking every week,” Wallace said."  Continued
You can't stay in your basement and fight the good fight. Your avoidance of interviews color you as a coward. Here's what is being written:  "Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden has been dodging Chris Wallace’s interview requests, the Fox News host said Sunday."  Continued

Biden?! He's sitting in his man cave, letting Trump destroy himself. Trump saw he was losing and decided to ramp up the civil unrest, which wasn't really much of a problem despite right wing media's bluster, in hopes it would scare white suburbia. Again, Trump in the center.

According to Biden it's at least the year 2040.
I'm not that optimistic yet, but worst case scenario we go with Plan B and launch the Bernie-filled Biden at the oval office window with a trebuchet.
We'll give you Joe Biden as a gift of surrender. Then in the middle of the night Bernie will climb out of Biden's broken open body and fuck you up while you sleep-off the inevitable global drunken celebration following Trump losing 2020.  Fuck metaphors. That's the literal plan.

This is THE smartest thing she could do. Clearly you missed something in Poli Sci; it's her race, not Biden's that she's running. Why endorse now? There's literally no reason for it. She can and should run her race in her district for her seat. Biden's got nothing to do with it.
She's right and she should say it. She has no reason to endorse him, and her race is about her, not about Biden. Smartest move she could make.
Biden that is.
I don't believe a word that comes out of Biden's mouth. It's all scripted and a known liar, which no one seems to give a shit about. The only thing maybe changing my mind is Trump sending secret police. That is just in fucking sane. Biden will not support a green deal, at all.

Honestly I’m just relieved some republicans are coming out against him. It will make it easier for other Republicans to turn the corner and vote for Biden.
Just please don’t vote for Biden
It's part of the platform and something every Dem would work toward. Bernie supporters want his exact verbage, some sort of tribute to his genius. He didn't invent M4A, won't champion it or push it through. Bernie lost, Biden is the nominee. Biden is plenty progressive. Bye.
Bitching about something that Biden and every other Dem wants and will work for because they don't adopt the exact Bernie phrasing and offer credit and tribute to him in the process is counterproductive. Bernie didn't invent M4A, he won't be it's champion, he LOST. GTFO.

I agree, she would be selected by  because she is extremely qualified but I hear too many commentators focusing on selecting a “woman of color” as if that is the primary qualifier. No, offense Joe Biden, but she was my first pick for president.
I SO agree, and he Might do it to get brownie points (And Millions of Votes) that's why if Biden strikes the match first it doesn't matter as much what Trump Does!  I DOUBT the #OrangeLoser would pull the trigger then - because it was Biden's Idea (Bad, of course!)

Always remember, Liberals chose Joe Biden, out of all the candidates they chose a brain dead right winger. Centrists and Liberals made their choice. Me...I vote on policy not fear, I am voting  and   because I won’t be complicit in the oligarchy.
LMAO Right winger Biden isn’t getting my vote
I am not voting for Biden, I am voting for Howie Hawkins in the Green Party. I vote on policies not fear. I can’t stand libs. They fuck everything up.
K I’m still not voting for Biden

Go away. We aren’t voting for Biden. You can go and participate in the duopoly with your friends
JOE BIDEN IS PATHETIC! 😆🤣😂
endorsed  because biden caved to ALL the demands of the far left, including socialist policies ~ socialism (the precursor to communism is socialism according to Karl Marx)
On the Briefing you pointed out that Biden said rioters should be arrested &amp; tried. Yes, but he also said HE would not do it, but leave it to the police. But they won't! So he's just pretending. You have to read between his phony lines, ma'am. :)
If you support Biden stop coming on here to talk to us about it.
A former prosecutor won't work with Joe Biden's past when it comes to the criminal justice system. A lot of Black people are already locked up because of some of Joe Biden's terrible decisions, you add a former prosecutor who is responsible for locking up 1000s of Black people
I like a few progressives. Overall I am done with that party though...Joe Biden will not be getting my vote. We are being asked to abandon too many simple asks such as legalizing marijuana.
As crazy as Joe has been. He may finally found the end to all division   If all African Americans vote Republican then by Biden’s logic there will be no African Americans left and thusly we will all just be Americans. Problem solved.
Welp... According to Joe Biden   Vernon is no longer black.
Name one thing  has accomplished during his nearly 50 years in Washington?  “Well, I fought hard everyday for...”  “Achieved,” not fought for.  &lt;Quid pro quo doesn’t count&gt;  It’s a nationally grave mistake to vote for Biden just because you don’t like
Biden's Build back better=Biden's Basement Bunker. Indeed there is where he belong.
I won’t be doing any of that. Biden doesn’t have my vote.
I mean I don’t totally think he’s wrong here: Biden is up by 8, and realistically Trump could win with Biden being +2.5, and the election is more than three months away.
Im not voting for Trump or Biden so November 3rd is going to be a very entertaining day on this app for me and honestly I can’t wait.
Just remember that Trump has about 88 million Twitter followers and Biden has about 8 million.
A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for the extreme left wing’s socialist agenda. Biden is NOT a middle of the road candidate; he is beholden to the Democrat Party’s most extreme fringe.
Biden wins OH but not IA?
This dog loves TRUMP  See it's reaction to biden...awesome dog
But yet we MUST vote for Biden ...because....Centrists are brainwashed.
Whoever thought Biden/Pete/Kamala/Warren/yang/bloomberg/that other dude was a better choice then Bernie....SUCKS

No. I’m not voting for Biden take your bullshit elsewhere
Do you what I've realized? Trump has about 88 million Twitter followers and Biden has about 8 million. A really good disparity.
I won’t be voting for Biden or trump in November. Neo libs chose a right winger. Don’t come asking us for help. You got this all on your own don’t worry.
Biden won't bring chaos. He won't stick around for even 2 days if inaugurated.  He has severe dementia and will simply hand over the reigns to the extreme liberal left. Then...the war would start!!
You're conflating Trump with Joe Biden. Democrats started the KKK, instituted Jim Crow laws, fought women's suffrage and the Civil rights movement. And BTW #IBelieveTaraReade
No, it's not in his best interest to pursue or respond to news stories. That will only give 45 more to work with. People and outlets are writing about Biden daily, he should only comment if something becomes huge enough to dominate all media cycles.
Exactly if Biden wins...it'll be over the next day....
Also: Worrying about the wrong candidate there K-K-K-aren ...  “If you vote for (Joe) Biden, you’re going to be living in Nazi Germany,” the woman with the swastika mask told Mueller.
Biden breaks 50 in NC, I guess more people know you Cunningham is now which is good
Why are you all suddenly categorizing the protestors as “Biden’s” protestors?  Plant that seed.  You know DJT is going to lose.  Grasping  straws.
There is going to be a time when we  will have exercise our 2nd Amendment against a tyrannical government if Biden gets elected.
Quite the fan fiction you've got going there. In truth, most everyone in that painting, if alive, would be praying for a Joe Biden win.

That depends on were you live. Ie. I am in a VERY safe red area. No way in hell Biden wins here. I will use my vote among many others, around the country, in the hope to finally give the Green party a leg to stand on.
Chris Wallace is trying to cover his own ars. Biden did want to defund the police for political gain. Part of the Democrats strategic cover up, give the peoples what they want, allow cities to crumble and they will be running to you for your help and in return you get supporters.
He is reminding Biden.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
You have the power to endorse Biden and make a real difference just by doing that so we can get rid of this Trump nightmare but instead you decide to siphon votes away from Biden to ensure a trump win. ☹️
Copy and paste this text and tweet it:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.

If Trump did as much in his presidency as he does telling Americans what Obama/Biden didn't do. Where would we be?
Biden took the same test and tried to fondle 3 of the words!! Creepy Joe!!
I have incredible privilege. I won’t be voting for Biden
LOL no he won’t..the majority of people are voting for Biden no matter what ...debates won’t change that. Their mind is made
You must be joking!!😂 Trump will eat Biden for lunch at the debates.
R U talking about old man Biden, the one who can’t seem to complete a sentence on his own?? What a total joke. So it’s all about respect for the thought, feely,  sniffer of a guy, huh? LOL!!🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
All Biden can do is criticize Trump on the virus actions, and besides he’s been a total failure in his almost 59 years in politics. He’s been wrong on ALL foreign affairs for that long per Gates!!
Well hopefully you have a money tree in your yard too, cause that’s what you’ll need to pay for all of Biden’s freebies!! !!😂😂😂😂😂
Sorry Anna. The guy who is delusional is Biden. I watch many TV Channels BTW. We will see how your man performs in the debates. Biden will not have his handlers giving him all of his lines. LOL😂😂😂
Biden is excommunicated bc a priest refused him communion.
Biden is soliciting Obama support because he's incompetent and needs desperate help  What a fucking loser.
Biden is super stupid. I was born in Singapore and raised in Malaysia bf coming to America. I do not look Chinese. Asians are vast ethnicity.
Copy Cat Biden ...#JoeBiden
So the Trump Cults’ argument against Biden is  “Things will be as bad as they are right now.” What???
Biden wins Wyoming confirmed
You go and “build back better.”  I’m gonna “bypass Barack &amp; Biden”  (And Bernie)
This looks like Disneyland compared to what it will be like if Basement Biden is elected!
I keep asking Biden supporters to give me one good reason not to vote for Trump. All they do is regurgitate the same tired drivel that has been spouted for the last 3 1/2 years. No one has yet made an argument I’m sincere in the fact that my mind can be changed on who I vote for.I mean Trump said something once a long time ago. Biden has a very clear ongoing repetitive issue here. These are not comparable.
If Biden is incompetent what is Trump? A baffoon?
She is the best candidate for Biden. I hope he realizes it.
I have always voted for the candidate, not the party. I liked John McCain. Then he pick Palin. I've seen videos of Biden and Obama. They got along well. I wish him someone like that, someone who suits him.  And yes, I will vote for him no matter who.
One would think that Fox News would support Conservatives because the alternative is going to be worse than the Obama/Biden eight year disaster.  If Biden wins and the Country becomes Socialist Communist will Fox New Anchors be willing to give up all they have achieved?
Not stunning at all really. Quite expected from this liberal dinosaur. She’s probably on the take from them like Biden.
Terrified? Really? Of what? The totally incoherent, rambling ignorant Democratic nominee for president... Joe, (I don’t know where I am,)Biden?  Mr.Rather.... you’re rather delusional!
Just when you thought Kamala Harris couldn’t get any sketchier... if this is Biden’s pick call the damn election.

I'm voting Biden also. Because I know the pandemic will end miracously shortly thereafter.
No. Not continuously retweeting Biden’s empty tweets everyday would be great. Sure I gotta begrudgingly vote for him but Biden literally says nothing of value everyday and is coasting to victory. Tired of the fawning praise for a man that does and says nothing.
With Hunter Biden?
Makes voting for Biden even more justified if we are gonna see more movements away from brutal policing in exchange for more rehabilitative and compassionate measures.   It also seems I forgot that 154,000 people have died in less than 6 months in Trump’s USA. I feel very safe!
Yup.  I would agree.  #AmericaOrTrump , which is why I'm voting for Biden.
I wouldn't want to trust Biden. Even if he is telling the "truth", that motherfucker is senile.
If you believe a strong middle class is the lifeblood of America, vote for Joe Biden.  #Biden2020
While I agree with some of what you’re saying, the problem is Biden &amp; Corp Dems do not agree with progressives on most things- they want forever war, mass incarceration, police militarization, etc. and the defund the police movement will die if Biden gets elected.

We would have a lot more to worry about Mr. Biden
Maybe reporters will ask him if Biden's handlers ever allow them to ask questions.
The press kept this from being made public.  There was only a mere mention of him in the hospital.  You can bet if Biden comes down with it.  Not only would they report it.  But they along with the Demorats.  Will blame Trump for it.
That’s what they don’t understand, they think  it’s the masses that control the eland will elect Biden. They don’t know that trump just needs 270 votes in the electoral college to win a second term. We can’t wait to drink the tears of Democrats
“One for the ages”; Really?  That was a disgusting display of disrespect for the late honorable congressman, John Lewis; it was a conniving political speech for Biden; period!
There's nobody on this planet that can tell me that Biden is not a pedophile. He was covered for so long that he knew he could get away with it. Maybe the dementia plea will be his angle for what is coming!
He could stimulus check me a million dollars and I’m still voting Biden.
Yes!  Biden and Big Blue across the board.
Biden according to his past tells me he always make the wrong decision .
If the sane part of the country actually votes, it will not matter. Biden will have a mandate even the likes of Mitch McConnell could deny. Part of me thinks McConnell will be glad to see Trump go.
Does Ryan support Biden’s agenda? Does he support other GOP down-ballot?
Know what is funny about the 2016 election? Joe Biden counted the EC votes in the Senate. Mrs. Clinton has been on her cry tour ever since.
They supported Bernie because they support socialism. Muslims do not like Jews. Today they said they have to lead their states for Biden but they do not have to endorse him. They are Marxist just like the BLM. America was founded to get away from that stuff. They want communism.
So true, looking forward to better days with Biden.
Arrogant and confident! Biden looks very weak! Just my opinion,  he better get sharp , because Trump is backed into a corner.
Because Biden looks and acts feeble! It won't be pretty!
Debates are gonna be ugly for Biden! Book that
I have no animosity toward Biden in this situation. He can’t help it. But the democrats are so unbelievably dishonest when they try to portray this guy as fit to be president. You have to be a fool to vote for this man!
Not too bad, considering — I thought the “festivities” for the treasonous late Senator from AZ would never end. I bet even President Biden won’t get as fancy a send-off as that!

This man is absolutely ridiculous. Do not doubt that he will do everything in his power to circumvent this election because he knows his ratings are in trouble. And please dear god go vote for Biden despite him not being your first choice.
We already know Biden doesn’t write his own tweets
How does Biden's binky taste, Kamala?
My state passed a resolution congratulating Trump for beating impeachment and chastising the "fake news" for overblowing the pandemic. Declaring in 2021 that the state doesn't recognize Biden as the legitimate President? I can absolutely see that
Google “Joe Biden Corn Pop”. You won’t be disappointed.
We will, even if we don't. Trump will claim millions of votes for Biden were cast illegally, millions of votes for Trump were lost in the mail, we'll have Trump fans taking over courthouses to prevent counts from being certified.......

good breakdown of what it would take where to get to 100 “clean” energy (as defined by Biden)

Fast track to socialism. We barely survived 8 years of Obama. Biden pushes us over the top.
The real Silent Majority is the republicans that’s going to vote for President Joe Biden and don’t want you to know it !!!
Joe Biden was born Nov. 20, 1942. He would be 78 when he took office.  He would be 86 at the end of 2 terms.   This stuff is so dumb, you can't even make it up.   They needed to pick someone that was a reasonable age to run for president.  Common sense is not so common- Voltaire
Part of the reason Trump name calling Hillary in 2016 (Crooked Hillary/Nasty Woman) worked and name calling Biden in 2020 (Sleepy/Senile Joe) isn't working is because Hillary is a woman and Biden is a man. Remember, double standards are very alive in politics.
lol, assuming Biden is gonna win.
I am convinced that if there is an in person debate between  and  Biden will end up punching Trump in the face. #2020Election #JoeBiden #JoeBidenForPresident2020
Biden is racist and homophobic
Biden calling some one crazy ? Bahahhahahah
You do realize that the Trojan Horse had Greek soldiers inside? Pretty sure Biden isn’t packing soldiers inside his body.  Not a good analogy, insult, thought in general. Are you sure you passed that acuity test?
Ah yes, my inability to imagine that huge swath of voters who are (1) super concerned with Biden's cognitive state, but (2) become MORE anti-Biden AFTER he announces his VP. And also (3) haven't been accounted for by pollsters despite Biden's cog. being talked about from day 1.
Unless you have an argument for why the VP would turn people away from Biden or toward Trump, then the polls suggest his current floor. And I have a hard time imagining someone *already concerned* with his cog. state will move further *against* Biden based on VP. So, floor.
Absolutely disgraceful! Jill Biden should have stopped this madness. What an embarrassment! #VoteRedToSaveAmerica2020 #DemocratsAreANationalDisgrace
Honestly, you just seem to be looking for an excuse to repeat claims about Biden having dementia. If people are concerned about his cognitive state to the degree you suggest, then, again, it's hard to imagine any VP choice that does anything other than BOOST his numbers.
That article supports what Lisa pointed out, but I never disagreed with that. I disagreed with your point that the numbers are meritless until a VP is announced, because I don't see how any realistic VP choice worsens Biden's situation.
And give them to Biden? You really do like fiction, huh?
Or takes them from "voting Biden, despite 'dementia'" to not voting, voting 3rd party, or voting Trump? Because, again, otherwise, I don't see how the VP nomination affects this in any way other than *improving* Biden's numbers.
Do you have an argument that these polls are excluding the people like yourself who "know what dementia looks like"? If not, it seems like Biden's numbers will only get better, right? What VP choice do you see taking someone from "undecided, because 'dementia'" to "voting Trump"?
Joe Biden Says He's Not Available for Interviews😨 #NoBullShit
I don’t think we should fall for rhe public polls again. People will say they support Biden in public but then vote Trump in private. We were sure Clinton would win. We need to fight harder than ever, especially in swing states.
Biden wont be elected, but go on believing he will
A Biden Bro tried to murder two people because they weren’t social distancing. I’ll take “Things You Won’t See on CNN” for $400, Alex.

I am super excited about Biden. No more racist walls. No more efforts to strip DACA recipients of their rights. No more presidential wars on a woman's right to choose, or my right to marry my partner, on cutting people's health care, or bashing our allies or citizens, etc. Go JB!

Biden is 100% correct. Often when in public people say I look just like someone, ask if I’m from Vietnam, Korea, China, etc., or call me “oriental”. People also have corrected me when I say where I’m from and say “no, you’re Chinese”
Biden likes people he has worked with before.  You'll understand when you're a senior citizen.
“Hidin’ Biden” is too unstable to campaign so he is thankful for using CV as an excuse to not campaign.  Trump is feeling too confident...there are no guarantees.  Very interesting times.....

That's how they get her in. Biden is the Trojan horse.
No, the switch will be AFTER the election, maybe even before he's sworn in. Biden won the primaries because the rest of the field were too far left for many Democrat voters. They need to keep him at the top of the ticket for precisely that reason.
Vice President Kamala Harris will pull the 25th Amendment ploy on Biden, and it will work — who will deny that Biden can't handle the job? Biden's will be the shortest Presidency since that of Old Tippecanoe. In fact, maybe we should start calling him that. #OldTippecanoe

Joe Biden will never debate President Trump live on a stage.
Biden will not let any one ask him a question
So why do we care if she doesn’t endorse? Plenty of others with much stronger voices have. If we’re lucky, Biden will win without it. And if we aren’t, she will endure 4 more years of a president who hates everything about her and wishes her harm. Her bed to lie in so to speak.
If these several vaccines are getting approved in October as mentioned then  and his hope that the virus pandemic will take down  dies. That’s the only thing Biden can run on. Everything else Trump obliterates The Sleepy One on.
There's a rumor going around that Joe Biden got dressed all by himself this morning. Can anybody verify this?
Anyone on the left that wants Biden as president is loving every damn bit of this shit with the china virus numbers the media feeds you and the riots and the pointless masks. Ppl are sick of hearing about it
You are correct. Biden will not debate Trump at all.
BAHAHAHHA AND WHY NOT BIDEN'S
And as everyone with half a brain has predicted, biden will get out of debating my president...and can even say "I didn't say no, Notre Dame did"... it cannot happen online, Joe Biden will have the questions and answers in his lap the whole time
Orgs like this and  should not use the GOP and Republican name.   Supporting a man who defaces the Republican values is a slap in the face for the whole party.   Don’t like Trump? Fine. Support a write-in or literally anyone but Joe Biden
If I was handeling Biden’s campaign I would cancel the debate(blame it on the virus) if I had a 10 point lead I would let Trump keep doing all the talking he just keeps doing damage
The same polls that said Hillary was gonna win.. if Joe Biden held a rally now he'd be lucky if 30 ppl showed up
Show me where there's any enthusiasm for Joe Biden besides the Twitter bots
Wow this weekd 59 shot 12 dead. 25 more shot on Monday. You still riding the Obama train to make sure gang members have guns to kill each other, thinking crime has to go down.Well it didn’t work the 8 yrs Obama/Biden was in.Your ignorant for not asking for help.
What's your favorite Biden policy?
If every Democrat in the country votes for Biden in Nov. we will win the election. We need every Democratic voter to get that ugly motherfucker out of the White House.
can’t believe joe biden is gonna be the next president wtf
Trump is winning in a landslide. Biden doesn't even know he's alive
Or h1n1 that infected 60 million.  I'm sure you locked down then as well..  answer to that was stop testing.. Obama and biden didnt have a clue. What did science say about that? Ahh. Nothing as it went away because the media didn't continue to cover it, occured after election.
If anyone can, it's Joe Biden
Sorry, No way would I vote for Biden.  Hate you feel you have to vote for him😫😫
with biden running they’ll take their chances
thank you for getting things ready for the Biden’s. #Biden2020
"But one report concerned a letter, postmarked Aug. 26, 1994, that Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), received from Worcester, Mass. 'Dear Sen. Biden,' the letter said. 'You are a traitor.' It was signed 'John F. Kennedy Jr.'"
Joe Biden is an incoherent, lying dummy controlled by the leftist Democrats!  God help us if these anti Americans take control!  Go Republicans and Trump 2020! Let’s win the Congress and Senate! The president cares about all minorities! Go conservatives, register them!
God help us if the leftist Democrats win! One incoherent, senile puppet in the White House,Joe Biden; abortion lovers; Democrats support baby killers; Socialists, police haters; this is the Democrats in the both houses of Congress! God forbid! Go Trump 2020; Republicans too!!
You’re right Mrs.Obama, we need to register as many Americans as possible.  This election as as crucial as   Any for the past 50 years!  Do we want chaos, looters, violence; (planned parenthood) and. Other leftist groups in Contol of our country? No! Trump;  2020! NOT Joe Biden!!

Thank you for including me.
I’m right there with you.   What I find interesting is that Biden supporters tell me a third party vote is a vote for Trump.  And then Trump supporters tell me that a third party vote is a vote for Biden.  🤷🏼‍♀️
Your MSM Censors Your News. If you don't think so tell me about How Bad Joe Biden's Dementia is. Tell me why the MSM isn't interviewing Joe.!! Come on, tell me.!!
Biden could be the first Democrat to win Texas since Jimmy Carter. Doing so, along with winning Florida... would result in a landslide victory.
Joe Biden leads in 20 swing states including the big-3.

biden has dementia. he can read a prepared statement. He has inadequate cohesive thought.
Twothings that will swing the election that article doesn’t cover: 1.) Depth of Trump support (which is significant) that polls haven’t tapped 2.). Though enthusiasm is low for Biden hatred for Trump by Dems is high.  Is that enough to drive them to the polls? As usual, turn out

You are, as usual, wrong, Bob.  You keep supporting child sniffing Biden, though.  A pedophile with dementia is exactly who we need running the country.  Excellent choice, Bob.
Biden on Fox can’t have an ear piece giving him the answers.  Plus no soft ball questions on Fox, that’s why Dems won’t let Fox have a presidential debate
But that doesnt mean anything...lol could do what Obama and Biden did...just stop testing for the h1n1 virus...I mean it only affected 60 million before they stopped the tests.
Served 27 years in Air Force around the world and I it makes me sick to see the way POTUS demeans our flag. It flies in my front yard and though I’m not a D or R, it will have a Biden 2020 next to it soon. Heartsick what has become of our nation.

I can't wait for a debate.   will absolutely demolish Biden
You have my vote Mr. Biden
Trump won't go on MSNBC, either.  Biden is 15 fucking points ahead.
60 million people got swine flu...I'd say we have a a good way to go before we obtain biden status..get off of it. Obama was golfing in late march ir april on a course that was closed due to state law...yet Obama was there. Typical double standard bs.
Just moderate the debate...oh that's if biden will show. I dont want to hear cov 19 blah blah. He and Sanders debated in an empty room..
Your crazy. Trump will win easy and biden won't even know it
Pelosi was in Chinatown on February 24. Trump had plenty of information that pelosi didn’t have from the cdc that this was going to be really bad and he needed to close travel. Who gives a shit what pelosi and Biden said it was up to trump to act quickly and he didn’t.
Biden doesn't even know he's running for president. It's hilarious that he's the best they could find as a candidate
The day after Biden wins it will disappear like a fart in the wind.
I don’t owe joe biden or you anything. 😌

How many Moms, Kids, Nurses, Dads, Vets have you injured with #TrumpsGestapo? Don't worry Wolf, the job won't be yours for long. Think Trump won't throw you under the bus for this? Think again. Then there's the new Biden administration.  Your 15 minutes of fame are over.

VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN TO DEFEAT FASCISM!!! tRump is flexing his fascist stance in Portland, in Seattle, and if we are not vigilant, nationwide to maintain control

Good leaders make things happen, but ignorant liberals like you still want to gripe about it. Guess who didn’t get prescription drug prices lowered? Obama, Biden, Clinton. Will you benefit? YES, but you just can’t stop bitching bcause you don’t like his personality. #GROWUP 🙄
I saw this as somebody who wants Joe Biden to defund the police but Joe Biden will not defund the police.
Go ahead and bet on that. I'll bet on less overall cruelty with Biden over Trump, and no chance of a minor-party win.
You bet your ass I will. I will vote for Joe Biden and to remove the blight that plagued our countryfor the past 3.5 years as soon as the opportunity is offered.
And you know who ISNT for universal healthcare? Joe fucking biden. Even trump was for universal healthcare at one point. Biden can’t ever say that.

The host also said that Biden wants to pick someone Who’s Ready to Step in and be President from Day 1 ???! Did I hear that right?  Told U So
Exactly I believe it was Obama / Biden
Biden himself is antithetical to my beliefs based on his record. I will not vote for him. Also, his cognitive decline needs to be addressed.
If Trump wasn't so ridiculous... Biden would be losing by 15 instead of up 7-10
Only one until yesterday when a group of Liberal Idiots were on a street corner with their Biden Signs. I honked and they happily waved as my wife and I gave them our Thumbs Down gestures as we drove by. Hard to believe there's that many idiots here in Tennessee.
Thanks to  there is now more documented evidence of UFOs than Biden yard signs

Guess this is what Biden supporters call "Progressive"...so sad. This should be a PSA: If you are a Biden supporter with any defensiveness or mild bigotry just avoid commenting. You are just going to make people (like me) want to vote for Jesse Ventura, when I am trying not to.
Who do you think is writing Joe Biden's tweets for him?
Hey now, let’s be an inclusive campaign. Kitties love Biden too!
u asked Russia to spy on Hillary and Ukraine/china on biden  Every time you call someone cooked  we know u mean you ,  crime of the century?! You,   call someone else a liar and see ,  we know its you
He did it's let Biden fix it.
Oh, all the violence in Portland? Guess who made it legal for the cops to use more brutal force? Oop. Joe Biden.
We’ve been voting for “the lesser evil” for years. And you ignored my question. Where the fuck was joe biden when Obama was drone striking the living shit out of the Middle East?
It’s like you’ve been completely ignoring the rest of the truth in this thread as you whine about trump some more. Joe biden is literally not better.
Joe biden made this shit legal, bud.
Yo i would’ve even voted for Tulsi Gabbard but noooo. The dnc wanted joe biden
Basically what I'm saying is if the government turned on the people that would be anarchy . Because those soldiers and cops have a family . And they would not try to protect Trump or Biden over their own kids for $20 am hour.. so then it's rich vs poor . And poor will win
EXACTLY! They know they can just guilt trip people into voting because the other choice is “scary” as if we haven’t already had a joe biden vice presidency that was honestly a disaster 🤷🏻‍♀️
Trump literally outflanks joe on the left. 🤣 I hate his guts but god damn it is sad we lost a great progressive candidate to get Joe “racial jungle” biden
Where the hell was joe biden when Obama was drone striking hospitals? Fuck joe biden. 🤷🏻‍♀️
Where was joe biden when obama was drone striking hospitals? Just curious
You want to beat off Biden? Ok...if that's what you like.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Wait. I thought you told us to hate Fox news for "fake" poll results.  You've got me so confused that I'm voting Biden in November.  You can only blame yourself for that.

The people who get the tax money that the government redistributes it to will vote for Biden.  The problem is almost half the people who pay zero federal income tax and are trying to the other half how much they should pay.
You could jerk biden off? I’ll vote for that
My guess is he's a MAGAt. Why else would he try and distract and post a negative about Biden? They try to be slick, but they're anything but.  Bunch of fucking sell outs.
Joe Biden wasn't sending unmarked federal agents into American cities to attack peaceful protesters. TODAY we have GESTAPO like actions being taken by a "president" who has shown that he has no regard for this country OR her people. INCLUDING our troops, the most precious of all
Blatant, made up false statements about what Joe Biden was doing 10 years ago doesn't have anything to do with it either, but you had no problem injecting your bullshit into the conversation. I just responded with some TRUTH. I noticed you STILL haven't addressed it.
I'm voting Biden but begrudgingly.That's what I keep talking to people about,how opinions &amp; most talking points are unproductive &amp; action regarding justice vs injustice is what matters. i.e.stopping &amp; being ready to record if someone sees a black person pulled over,protests...
&amp; my "racist,sexist" comments are just fact based, i.e.  commenting "Biden is what we got another white,old man with slight xenophobia..but better than a man without a soul like 45."I am still not sure if the guy who called me a racist,sexist,ageist is an adult..so hard to tell
Biden wasn't in office when Putin was paying bounties to the Taliban to slaughter US Troops. TRUMP STILL HASN'T CONFRONTED him over it. Troops are STILL being targeted. And Trumps' GESTAPO thugs attacking US citizens is OK? Trump is a TRAITOR &amp; so are YOU
I'm not being mean, but please understand, if you are even thinking of voting "left" ( and I don't care if it's Biden, Sanders, anybody with the Democratic Party) you will regret what they'll do to this country, it may not be the very day you vote, but it won't be long after...
Tell her she needs to do better since her prick son says shit that would get his ass beat if he said it in person.Or even worse make someone vote for Bernie &amp; get trump reelected.Your entitled obnoxiousness really will make people not vote Biden so keep it up if that's your goal.
I’d point to the Joe Biden for President sign in my front yard and close the door.
Insult #6 good work...Biden campaign should be proud. Maybe you are really protrump with a probiden account, trying to sabotage Biden, that makes the most sense.
If you don't point out the problems within a society they won't get fixed.I pointed out obvious problems.If you can't see that,perhaps you are part of the problem.Quite honestly,maybe avoid commenting on twitter to strangers because you are not making Biden supporters look good.
You are making a lot of promises that you will not be able to follow through on since it is so obvious that you not going to be re-elected. GO BIDEN!
You can beat Biden off?
Joe biden doesn’t even remember beans
You are either a 12 year old or a bot. At least Biden has bots too...that's encouraging I guess.
Thanks. I don't buy Nike or Apple.  And why do you claim I have "marxist racist" values... that doesn't even make sense. Also, why are you saying the Biden is responsible for things his adult son does? If he has unethical financial interests in something, as you imply.
So I think it's official Biden supporters are xenophobic, status quo assholes too...but damn it, I still got to vote for him. #Biden2020
Aww you are so right...it is not your fault I am a weak,illiterate,fragile woman, woe is me.  Seriously though, reverse racism does not exist. In history mostly white men have been the oppressors, the fact that I need to explain this to a Biden supporter is very disturbing.
Internal polling is basically Trump saying "People say". Its going to be so funny to see Trump on 1/20/21 sitting out the Biden inauguration in Trump tower and protesters singing, Nananana hey hey hey goodbye, lol.
the leadership of the Democratic Party is extremely old (pelosi, schumer, biden, clyburn, hoyer, durbin, etc.) and its targeted base is made up of two demographics that are also on their way out (baby boomers and suburbanites)

If we deserved Bernie....Biden is not a close 2nd to Bernie at all....But desperate times call for acceptance of more old white, slightly xenophobic Christian men....least he has a soul unlike 45.
Yes. Right now, with our democracy under siege, I think a vote for any one but Biden is a travesty.  We need a 3rd, or 4th, party. The best way to achieve that would be to demolish the GOP and divide the spoils.
Biden’s America
He’s sad and he’s being exploited by You Obama and the Democrats because he’s sick and you can control him. You are even sader. You wasn’t much of a president Obama and an even worse friend to Biden. You’re pathetic always have been
I don't want to be too blunt, but you need to hear this:  Biden MUST  pick a Black female VP.  At this point, it would be insulting not to. There are so many highly qualified Black women. This national conversation about racial justice is THE conversation. Get on board.
New man, woman, in Whitehouse. Biden 2020. I got extra points
Biden has publicly addressed this and admitted that he has violated boundaries. He has promised to become more aware of this and change his behavior. Trump, on the other hand, has said inappropriate things about his daughter since she was an infant with no awareness.
BLM is a communist movement. The money that is raised doesn't even go to black lives or communities. It goes to fund Biden's campaign. I don't want to hear it until you guys actually step in to save ALL BLACK LIVES. Do something about the majority of death in their community.
This would so totally be me if I had the pleasure of meeting Vice President Biden-Soon to be President Biden!
Biden isn’t going to win and anyone thinking that believes the hype way to much. It will be Trump. Silent majority is real
It’s not a done deal. We need to make sure Biden wins.
This is what is the most important to point out? What about Hunter Biden made billions from conflict of interest contracts with our allies. We paid for all his trips &amp; secret service. Biden put a US island next to Epstein’s in his Bros name to transport kids &amp;celebs.#pedogate2020
Joe being a pedophile with children in his basement doesn’t? Your sick. Hunter Biden made billions off of govt contracts &amp; we paid for his trips &amp; secret service. Biden’s secretly put his bro’s name on a us island next to Epstein’s to transport children &amp; celebs. The truth coming
How many billions of $$ did Hunter Biden make off of us when Joe gave his co. contracts which should have been a conflict interest. Joes bro’s island next to Epstein’s formerly owned by US was given to him by Obama/Joe to transp children after Trump talked to the victims lawyers.
Like many other Voters I have contacted Joe Biden regarding your threat concerning the Postal Service.

Black Lives Matter applies to George Floyd, but not David Dorn.  Me Too movement applies to Brett Kavanaugh, but not Joe Biden.  COVID-19 applies to Trump rallies and conventions, but not rioting and protests.  My body, my choice applies to abortion, but not wearing masks
Biden will out debate him.  No problem.
He cut trade and the dems lost their fucking minds. Biden’s son got exposed with his dealings and then all this bs started happening with COVID, BLM flared back up, and now they are pushing for mail in voting....if you can’t see what’s going on then i feel bad for

Seems like  secretly wants Trump to win.   While anyone close to Biden is scrambling to limit his exposure for fear of gaffes and befuddlement, Moore is calling for daily exposure!
I like to call it a Revolution. It has that quality. I am hoping Joe Biden will lead revolutionary changes in this country. The elder statesman leading in a new generation. Picking the best from both sides. I am sick of this division. We are the UNITED States.
Biden is a rational and kind adult.  Would you expect him to support a man-child who hates his own skin so much that he paints himself orange?
No matter how many lies you spread about President Trump The American People will not elect the Chinese Communist Party Candidate Alzheimer’s Joe Biden
BHO, unlike you, was a 2 term POTUS.  That is the definition of a successful Presidency.  A Biden win will etch it in stone.
Awww, angry little liberal name calling and throwing a fit. I don’t care if you support Obama or Biden. People love and accept failures all the time. Your body your choice
Oh wow, that hurts...coming from the guy with a Pokémon avatar. I bet you’re Biden’s right hand man when it comes to finding kids to rub his leg or sniff
Honestly Trump is way better than Clinton or Biden. But that’s not the argument I’m here for.
While Biden was hiding in his basement the Administration was deploying every public &amp; private asset to combat the virus. Every medical expert agrees you can’t stop the spread you can only slow it to make it more manageable. Time for another nap Joe.
May I remind Trump funded black univ, did crimsoned justice reform , made empowerment zones, lower minorities unemployment to lowest levels ever. Dems talk a good game &amp; are in gov for 50 yrs &amp; do nothing like Biden. Wake the fuck up.

Lol Joe Biden doesn't even know what the hell's going on #SleepyJoe #Trump2020LandslideVictory
Actually 3 million more Americans voted for Hillary Clinton, the candidate both Barack Obama and Joe Biden endorsed in 2016, than those who voted for you. Remember: you won through technicality. More Americans wanted Hillary Clinton to be President than you.
calm down, Jeb. I do appreciate a woman who has made a career singing about picking losers thats backing Biden.
I'm hoping that every state is a swing state in November.  I really want Biden to take Tennessee.  Remember: Voting is the ultimate protest.
you have no right, ever again, to bring up President Trump’s character/behavior  if you’re going to excuse Biden’s because you agree with him politically. #2020VISION
if you wanna talk about policies that’s one thing but if you are voting for Joe Biden b/c Donald Trump’s character is unacceptable, then you are a complete hypocrite. and vice versa. we have two absolutely disgusting men running for president. #VOTEFORKANYE #2020VISION
Joe Biden has no idea who his VP will be until the DNC tells him
You need to give the test to Joe Biden and show it on CNN.
No, Biden will do nothing and let our cities burn like all other Democrat politicians.For the record: In order for Biden to run with a glass of water as his VP then Pence would have to switch parties.
Trump is doing great go Trump 2020! Biden all talk and I doubt very much that you are capable of doing anything but dragging US citizens down and have no intention of fixing anything! Sorry hate to bust your bubble!
Fauci has a high approval rating as much as Biden does! Fauci is a fraud! It really makes me sad that you are stil giving him validity. In 2005, he said Hydroxychloriquine works for COVID. This is all about Big Pharma! Tying yourself to him is a huge mistake!
We know that Joe Biden has officially been announced as being criminally investigated in Ukraine!
Comes down to lesser of the evils right now... we gotta survive this virus before we can do anything.  I don’t have high hopes for Biden as president - 4 years is not long enough to fix this mess, but if he does work his ass off, vote him out in 4 years too!!
😂😂😂  This has to be “Biden’s team demands...”, since Joe probably doesn’t even know what COVID is, and wonder if “Vaccine” is someone has once dated! 🤦🏻‍♂️
I wouldn’t either! Good call, ⁦ ⁦ 🇺🇸
You do realize that I don't like him. In the last election, we had... Donald Trump Hillary Clinton That's like having to choose between John Wayne Gacy and Ted Bundy.  In this election we have... Donald Trump Joe Biden That's like choosing between Gary Ridgeway and Samuel Little.
He’s trying to keep Biden out...
Any Republican voting for Biden is not a Republican. Biden is being controlled by Marxists.
Can you really imagine Biden holding up and even making ANY decision under these conditions?  Of course U don’t have to because U allow dems to “operate in darkness.”  Even when the Prez stopped travel U criticized. Just be somewhat fair at least occasionally &amp; U would b respectd
Heads up: sane people hate Trump and recognize Biden as a good person.  Just imagine being a person who had his wife insulted and father disparaged by Trump then how would YOU feel?
Pelosi is more scattered brain than Biden.
Hopefully President Biden can change all of that.
But don’t bring it up until Biden gets elescted... 🤫
Joe Biden never gets asked the hard questions. Like when he would consider opening schools. It's sad people don't see this.
The deflection in this thread is at full force. China owns Biden and Hunter, so it makes sense.
The password was...”password”
Expect more of these fellow Patriots. Sound familiar.. They are falling in  line with Biden's new campaign sympothy..
You think these riots will stop? They did it under obama. It will embolden them and make it worse if you vote for biden. Democrats have not condemned the violence of the riots.. not once!Biden would do well to choose Susan Rice imo. Loads of Station Department experience.
He’s saving it to try and drown out Biden’s VP announcement, if he actually has anything at all (probably complete bullshit &amp; lies)
But this is if there isn’t an EC win, right? I believe Biden is going to win handily.

Yeah. Weird new sensation to basically respond to every email and throw a few bucks on the weekly. Even got a couple of shirts. I was into Warren and doing it for her and then just multiplied that when Biden became the person.

Did Biden speak at Lewis' funeral? 3 ex presidents and Nancy Pelosi did, you'd think the current dem nom would speak
Love your platform Jo, but right now I feel my vote must go to Biden.   2022-24... and the Libertarian party can have me. Perhaps the GOP will sink out of sight after this election.
no, without voter fraud, he...um... Biden doesn't stand a chance
Watching the funeral services of Rep Lewis &amp; listening to our former presidents speak made me realize how parched my soul has been. It has been like a cool drink in the desert, and energizes me to do whatever I can to elect Biden.
if the media tells people that, then they might decide to live their lives instead of huddling afraid. and that won't help obama become president...er, biden
Biden can’t even tie his own shoes. Do you really think his handlers are going to let him pick a VP?

Same, because alot lf these people who are realizing shit isn't ok now, agreed when Obama called us thugs during the Ferguson riots. They get comfortable when a Democrat is in office,  meanwhile Biden is talking about shooting protestors too. I will vote, but ill burn it All
And that’s exactly what should happen. Realistically Biden won’t run for a second term. He will want a VP that can pick up the mantle.
If Biden does not investigate and prosecute Bull Barr and Pompass ass Pompeo, he won’t get very far in his agenda.

Bc if something happened to Biden or he did not run for a 2nd term, she has the strength to build her own coalition. They want someone who is beholden to them. The other possible nominees in the article (it did not mention E.W.), do not have a national base and would need them.
Cavuto is pathetic - he had the Democrat Giv if PA on a few minutes ago and just allowed him to give a campaign speech for Biden -so sad for Fox to do that when all the other media slobbers over Biden

I really look forward to those things being restored, which is why I’m voting for Joe Biden. (I do not think those words mean what you think they mean.)
One could speculate Portland could look very different if Bernie were the nominee. His candidacy may have provided a steam valve for far left energy that Biden's never will, even if he does get their votes.

i remain unconvinced that any possible vp pick biden makes is good and that it will be a nomination worth my vote. see you down ballot, i guess
Joe Biden is on his last leg. Let the man have his retirement in peace. He is obviously mentally deficient.  Do a cognitive skills assessment, publish it, and move on to a more viable candidate for President Trump to actually debate.
Biden, I am a deaf Democrat-lean Independent moderate since 1980. Don’t wear a mask if you’re having a strong immune system in your body. I never had a virus and never wear a mask ever since coronavirus pandemic began in March. It will be marked 140th day on Friday.

It was the Democrats that established the “three strikes” laws that sent people to prison for life even if their third crime was stealing a pack of cigarettes.  Hillary amd Biden were supportive of that.  Trump has gotten those people out of prison and is working to free more.
I'm thinking that the SDNY will have him indicted and in handcuffs at 12:01 pm on January 20, 2021 for tax fraud.  And I'm certain Joe Biden will not pull a Gerald Ford and pardon him.

Biden plan for riots is to send in more local police but last week her supported defunding and stripping them of equipment that makes them the enemy
If Biden had control of his party platform he wouldn’t of allowed Barr to be treated so rudely. Does anyone honestly believe a majority of the independents watching that hearing walked away excited to vote democrat? Hearing grumbles of people reluctantly announcing vote 4 trump
Gates said Biden has been wrong on virtually everything including not being in favor of killing osama
The best is when he said the main reason he is running is because of his foreign policy... didn’t his guy testify that Biden has been wrong on virtually every decision he has advanced?
Because in A debate, Biden will be severely disadvantaged because of his dementia problems...
Why Biden is going to get crushed
Haha Biden is going to get smoked
We might have been too stupid then, but those 200 Fed judges plus 2 Supremes taught us better.  And I hate to break it to you, but Biden is the republican in this race.  republican.  Small "r" as he believe in our republic.  Trump wants to be a dictator.  Always has.
Roll the Tape: Biden Supported “Defunding the Police”
Biden supports a social engineering scheme called Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing. A federal takeover of local zoning laws would force suburban towns with single family homes to build high-density affordable housing to allow low-income minorities to choose suburban living.
How about you be honest with me. I’ve been following you thinking you are a Trump supporter and now I’m hearing you support Biden. Which is it?
Everyone should read the new book, Fallout. It examines the swampy dealings of the Obama-Biden Administration!
Something like 30 million Christians aren’t registered to vote. With Biden openly advocating for schools to start teaching the Muslim faith it’s more important then ever to talk to your pastor about the importance of having a voice in the future of our country
Yeah a stutter doesn’t cause you to say things like I’m joe Biden’s husband joe Biden, or i like kids rubbing on my legs, or nurses used to breathe in my nostrils to get me moving 😂
Liberals are fools in one breath Biden says take down statues because they are slave owners and next breath let’s teach about Muhammad a slave owner in our schools. You can’t make this up if you tried!
Get the message out to churches Biden openly said he wants to teach the Muslim faith in our schools

Biden does not stand a snowballs chance in the fall...
I think that even if the GOP loses the Senate, the filibuster will remain.  Biden was a Senator for decades, so he knows how useful it is.  Plus, as a Senator for decades, he also knows that nuking the filibuster could eventually pave the way for the GOP to push in their agenda.
Was a China victory and USA loss. China and Biden’s family thrived while Biden has been in office with cherry on top 1.5 billion China deal on airforce 2 while leaving office
That is all Biden voters sweetheart

He mentions ‘workers and laborers’ but we don’t have the luxury of saying ‘If I don’t get my way I’ll take 4 more years of trump.’ Hell I’m not excited about Biden either. The best he’ll do is a semblance of the Obama era but at least he won’t purposefully make things worse.
nah we’ll have a vaccine a few days after Biden is elected. Spring sports aren’t in danger
And Biden was his #2.
I'd love for Kamala to be part of Biden's admin, but I think she's better than just VP.  VP doesn't really do much, normally.  Also, if naming someone else VP helps carry a state that's close, that could help put Biden in.  I think California is in the bag.
If you think Joe Biden is "far left," you are certifiably insane.  Lay off the Red Bulls and Caps Lock key.
On January 20th, 2021, Trump's term ends. He will have zero power to do anything. If he refuses to leave, the military will escort him out immediately under Biden's order. I think it is more likely he flees the country because of the avalanche of lawsuits piling up against him.
But it IS tRump's America. How can anyone blame Biden, who hasn't taken office (YET!), on people protesting tRump and his insane policies?
Biden is a joke

First of all using the word stupid with this argument might not be in your best interest. Secondly, Trump’s style is not anger and lack of control but rather humor and wit. Check the Trump- HRC debates, they’re hilarious. Once again, Biden’s handlers will never let him onstage...
If you think Biden and Trump are equally bad for our country, then  I cannot support you, but I will say Sen E. Warren was my first choice for President!  If we elect Trump we can say goodbye to our Republic and the Democratic Rule of Law and hand the keys to Putin!
I think with Biden you’re only going to see more mental decline. He’s referred to himself as “Joe Biden’s husband” recently. It’s scary if elected a group of unelected people would run the nation. A moderate would be great but USA has stood firmly in their corners hard right/left

Biden knows the questions.
Biden is lying about President Trump. Obama was one of the most racist presidents. Obama caused all this hatred towards police officers and caused the division in this country. Obama did nothing to improve the lives of minorities and he kept them in bondage to the government
Again Biden and Democratic Party lie about President Trump. He is the only President that has improved the life and job status of all minorities. He is the only President that has not done identity politics and does not pander to any one group. He has improved all lives
This is another example that Biden is inept and mentally incompetent. He needs to be removed from the election.
Yes, very unfortunate.  is clearly terrified of Don Jr.’s cutting-edge political commentary like “Joe Biden is a racist for supporting crime bills” and “Did you know that Democrats once owned slaves?”
I'm more concerned about independents and people who voted for Trump last time, getting those people to vote for Biden. Plenty of other choices who don't carry that devisive baggage.
156 Americans shot over this past weekend in New York and Chicago alone. And people there still want their Democratic Mayors and governors and possibly Joe Biden. What a joke. Save America vote for Trump in 2020. 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
We will get to hear all about Benghazi again if it’s Rice. Seems like a major negative for her as a choice.   I would strongly prefer someone who had at least been elected to some office at some point in their life.   No choice for VP will keep me from voting for Biden, however.
We all know that President Trump works 24/7 towards making our country great. And we all know Joe Biden can't work 7/24. Democrats are smart keep your ass in the basement Jojo. Think America is unsafe today. Then elect Joe Biden. We all in this country will be f*****. KAG 2020.

This is such a great conversation. I miss President Obama... But I’m excited for President Biden. 💙🇺🇸
Why not let these Liberal Mayors and Governors go down with there cities. For them to say yesterday was a political stunt. Screw them. Joe Biden sure the hell isn't trying to help them. He's to busy worrying about running out of toilet paper hiding in his basement.
Only 67 more days for the Biden camp to find a reason for him Not to debate the President!!!!....Biden will pardon his. There are no good guys left.
Does Trump realize all our troops that are not home do Mail in ballets? This man is not right!!! He’s just not!! I live in Memphis Tenn. in the SOUTH &amp; a Democrat! Alot of the South are REPUBLICANS I WAS until Barack Obama &amp; from then on DEMOCRATE. You have to win Mr. Joe Biden!
If Biden now has all the answers on how to “fix” America, why didn’t he (as VP) share them with Obama during the Great Recession that drug on for 8 years?? Also, where are all of his legislative successes in a 36 year Senate career (other than enriching his family)??
I agree - they’re all evil - we’ll lose this country if Biden wins - he’ll be a puppet head AOC + 3 will run the show
What if Biden doesn’t acccept the lose, like Gore?
Oh yeah. Biden’s got this. He can just coast home.
I still think it will be Hillary/Harris but they sure are dragging Biden along...
Biden winning is the only damn thing that matters now and we should take all the help we can get. This is war.
Some people do not need to bring up such pettiness. Do we need a dictator (Trump ) or do we need a person that is compassionate &amp; WON’T let our Unite States be destroyed like it is being done today! Yes we need JOE BIDEN to run our country ( AMERICAN ) !!!
AMEN AMEN!!!  We need someone named Joe Biden!!
The man to do so is in the office, but these chicken shit governors are so scared of offending people when laws are being broken and lives threatened. Please tell me Kent you don’t think Biden is the answer?
does  know you want to beat Biden off?
Joe sniffing hair publicly makes the claims against him much more credible. He's openly pedophillic and perverted, Trump is not. Biden's actions make claims against him much more credible.
Biden's 77, what's your point?
No, that's Biden. He's the one that sniffs small girls on the regular, has much more credible accusations against him, and says plenty of racist things (like if you don't for for him "you ain't Black" or "poor kids can be just as bright and just as talented as White kids").
And you know this how, Jack. You're not a neurologist, but an eye doc by training. So what qualifies YOU to cast such a medical opinion. Thought you were talking about #SleepyJoe Biden, actually. Your shoe fits that iteration...Word to the WISE and especially you DF MIME’s...If you’re married and still out suck’in and fuck’in REEEE-TIRE! That goes for you too, Biden &amp; Bill.  RoguePOTUSStaff          💯👀
DAAAAAAYUM  This is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥  Straight up scorch Biden.  #Trump2020LandslideVictory
Under Biden as VP Obama was the first president in decades to leave with less black prisoners then he started off with
Let's imagine, can we, the future. January 21, 2021. Biden takes the oath of office. Somewhere a wife is telling her husband that she is leaving him. He says, "I will just find me some new pussy". She responds, "If you had more than two inches of dick you would find new pussy
Biden doesn’t know how to operate the tweeter machine.
I paid to watch VP Biden &amp; Senator Warren speak tonight - about to start now. I don't know if others can watch via this link, but if interested here it is:
I have run out of words to discribe how much Biden disgust me so I’ll just say he’s a bug on the floor I am going to step on and crush.
A 17-year-old has been charged with 30 felonies over the big celebrity Twitter hack
should have known some bullshit like this would come out when our revolution, progressive democrats of america, and roots action gave biden the thumbs-up to pick her (along with two other white women) as his VP.
2020’s next twist: Trump replaces Pence with Elizabeth Warren, Biden names Tucker Carlson his running mate, and NOBODY in the country knows how the &amp;%#! they’ll vote.
At least Biden won’t make fun of it or act like it’s about to disappear. It’s going to be hard for anyone to just turn it around at this point because we have no leaders!
biden &amp; bernie &amp; bloomberg shouldn't have run in 2020.
I can’t believe some are suggesting having two white 70 somethings on the ticket. That’s tone deaf AF. Kamala should be Biden’s VP.
LIAR!!!!! That’s one of the reasons you’re failing in the polls. But I bet you will brag you are way ahead of Biden. #TrumpsEvilPlan #PutinsPuppet #AmericasGreatestMistake #TrumpFailedAmerica
I cannot wait to vote for Joe Biden and whoever he picks as his VP. #WeWillVote while we #WearAMask
why bring your parents into this?  It's not their fault your voting Biden.  leave those poor people alone!  thank you and block me now.
Joe Biden's America!
Not true. Just a plain old lie.  The  GOP are adding so many other things to the bill it’s ridiculous.  What can’t they just vote on what at stake. Liars all liars. #25thAmendmentBeforeWeAllDie #turd #FlushTheTurdNov3rd #Biden #ByeDon2020
Biden’s team is picking the potential president, not a vice! Biden will never get the nomination on his own. DNC will pick the ticket and plan to lie/steal election!
Fox News, reporting that Trump will push back the election.
Just curious but what did Biden bring to the table in 2008? He was another senator from a blue state. No geographic, background or electoral diversity added by his selection.
Schumer the most corrupt person in the Senate bar none. He’s right on par with Biden and has a braid smaller than a catfish. Probably smells just as bad too.
Just drove through Belleair, FL with clusters of nuts out awaiting the #TraitorInChief. Roads blocked, lots of police presence. But I did see several clusters of #protesters and #Biden signs.  #VoteBlueNoMatterWho
Sure. Burn down the internet.  There will be no face to face convention and to be quite honest Nina calling Biden names adds more votes.  So sure. Burn down the internet. Woooo...
Joe Biden narrows down his VP list, with Karen Bass emerging as one of several key contenders
Because for the vast majority of us--as opposed to those with the repetitive comments and questions posed on Twitter--Joe Biden could choose a floss pick tossed out in a parking lot and we'd be good with it. We see the mental masturbation and hand wringing as a waste of energy.
Ok. But we knew trump couldn't do any of that from jump 😂. So where does that leave us? At least Biden was a PART of a successful presidency
LATEST: A Florida teen was charged for his alleged involvement in a Twitter hack that took over accounts of prominent users like Joe Biden, Bill Gates and Elon Musk
"...realizing that corrupt Joe Biden ... is your best hope? That's gotta be depressing."  And yet, he has a double digit lead over Trump in all polls.  Now, THAT'S gotta be depressing.
Joe Biden Makes The Simplest Anti-Trump Promise Ever And People Are Here For It
Christian here. Biden is the man! He may not be anti abortion, but he cares for babies at the border, old people, our safety from the virus, and restoring the economy! He has plans for a future other than gloom &amp; doom! I do not worship the “beast” in the Oval Office.
“You’re not black if you vote for Trump”- Biden • All kids care about is what cereal and car they’re getting next. - Obama/Michelle.  That shit so insulting and I do not fuck with y’all.
This why parents and their kids have a problem, this the exact shit that come out of older adults mouth. If y’all can’t respect my vote than, I’m not voting for the people you respect because they obviously don’t respect the millennial vote to. Cough Cough Joe Biden.
Quick reminder. We know you are a traitor. Biden will rectify that in January. Have you ever been to Terre Haute? I hear it is nice this time of year.
Biden will pardon his. There are no good guys left.
Final two are completely absurd. The nation will still be divided and Biden’s family is comically corrupt. This whole tweet exemplifies the danger of a Biden presidency—electing him will do nothing to alleviate the conditions that gave us Trump, but people will pretend otherwise!
Nina Turner upset...  Who could of predicted it...

Hard to fathom why you leftists could support #CluelessJoe Biden. Soooo sad!
That went out the window with Tara Reid. Credible evidence against Biden &amp; #metoo  died.  Hypocrites!
Plus, EVERY. SINGLE. DEMOCRAT. HAS SAID THAT CLINTON NEEDS TO GO TP JAIL IF GUILTY!  Meanwhile, all Trumptards do is whine about bias and say that people have TDS.  I guess they forgot about their Stage 5 freak out over EVERYTHING Obama did for 8 years.   Talk about Triggered!
Me too! Biden, Kerry &amp; Mittens Romney are corrupt to the core!! What are they so afraid of?
But he didn’t answer why Dead People only vote Democrat. Or if you vote for Biden, you’re a pedophile.
A 3rd party vote isn't a vote for Trump or Biden.  A 3rd party voter wasn't going to vote for either of those 2 anyway.
I think it's hilarious that #CluelessJoe Biden would use Ronald Reagan to attack the best president since Ronald Reagan.

Obama Unleashes on Trump Privately as He Raises $24 Million for Biden
And we will. Joe Biden is the new President.
I havent seen a single Biden yard sign yet either.
And he has to know how to operate the Tweeter machine as well. Biden can’t figure it out.
I guess when he was told he's not running against Biden but the virus that changed his view...
You must be new. Brand new. I don't fuck with Biden either cupcake.
Please vote for Joe Biden
Are you teaching people how to break,  ignore,  and skirt the rule of law?   I'm guessing you can use recent personal experience and testimony to give great examples of how you allowed Hillary to do it and how you, your team,  Obama and Biden excelled at it...
Obama/Biden, Clinton/Kaine, Clinton/Gore....
Joe Biden would still be Uncle Joe if he wasn't running for President now everybody hate him, ion understand 😫
Possibly the only hope of normality here is if a critical mass within the GOP decides not to take Trump seriously if Biden wins and he refuses to concede. If they won’t fight his civil war with him, I doubt he can create a groundswell on his own.
Well that and Biden doesn't even tweet. The one Trump account is definitely him
Honestly kinda hope President Trump wins just so we can all scream “rigged!” &amp; ask him how come it was “rigged” if Biden would win but fair if he wins. Can’t wait.
I've got $20 Biden's name is not in Epstein's book.
Does Trump realize all our troops that are not home do Mail in ballets? This man is not right!!! He’s just not!! I live in Memphis Tenn. in the SOUTH &amp; a Democrat! Alot of the South are REPUBLICANS I WAS until Barack Obama &amp; from then on DEMOCRATE. You have to win Mr. Joe Biden!
Wait. Is Joe Biden about to pick Warren as VP?
Joe Biden say “you ain’t black” if you don’t vote for him but quite honestly you’re not black if you DO vote for him fuck joe biden
I wonder if the kid from Arkansas has met his grandfather and if it will be raised a Biden?

Just go ahead make your next move ... to Russia 💁🏻‍♂️
Get a clue #Hydroxychloroquine has been around 65 years and it’s saving lives . Biden is probably taking it right now . You should research. Politics kills
The conversation about Trump not leaving office after losing the election is stupid. I mean dumb as hell. If it's that difficult to figure out what to do, this country is a dayum illusion. If his own party doesn't go in and escort him out, Biden can get crew together to do it.
He’s “clean”, so says Biden
Actually it was Bush and the GOP that bailed out WS, banks and AIG. Then handed Obama &amp; Biden a mess that took years to restore and handed a booming economy to trump enjoyed and ran in the ditch. You say you are for limited gov. does that include the secret police gassing 1/2
We have always had to decide who will give us a day in court or string us up!   Why it’s easy for me. #Biden  People had said vote like a Black woman. It ain’t cause we live for Biden or the D.  We use to not getting to home plate on the first second third or fourth bat!
How the hell Joe Biden folks get my personal email address tho?
For who tho? Bc Biden is literally no better
The funniest shit is that here in the south people think Biden wants a marxist revolution I mean come on 😂😂😂
Trump, Biden campaigns trade charges on cuts to 'COPS' policing program
That is all the more reason you should be pissed at trump's incompetence. I'm guessing you weren't in biz in 2008 when the GOP crashed the economy, Just before Obama and Biden took over and bailed us out. And god damn if the republicans haven't done it again.
It's safe to say Biden's VP will not be trashed by the press in the same way Mike Pence was in 2016.
President Obama &amp; VP Biden, brought back the economy bush ran into the ground,  worst recession since the great depression, and handed off to trump and it was booming. trump's incompetence and refusal to act in a global pandemic has resulted in the total crashing of the economy.
Can you not say vote for Biden?
Obama and Biden fixed the mess the previous republican left. Our country was in turmoil banks and businesses needed a bailout to keep going under. Trump has increased the budget and had a hand in 150k deaths durin Covid. #TrumpVirusDeathToll150K
Safe and convenient way to vote is by mail. #VoteByMail #Vote #ByeDon2020 #Biden
I will vote Biden
Biden's support for law-and-order type legislation in the past is troubling, but the signaling coming out of his campaign is that his Administration will be guided by more progressive voices, so I view that with cautious optimism.
Regardless of what you try to say.  Once the virus came to America, it became your responsibility.  Oh, Commander-in-Chief.  You didn't deal/handle it.  It's all on you, not Biden.  This is real reality, not a show.
Obama Unleashes on Trump Privately as He Raises $24 Million for Biden
Billy, they will be suffering indigestion once January arrives and all of the clowns start sweating indictments. In fact, Biden should name Clinton AG. That would cause Trump to stroke out for sure.
Y’all already covered Biden’s 3 trillion dollar climate plan?
😂😂😂 vote for who? Biden Democrats y’all been doing that for the last 50 years the lgbtqia+_= got more to show for voting democrat than y’all you still pumping people to go vote for the same party. 🤪good luck. Hillary with the hot sauce. Kamala I smoke weed.=blk vote 🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️
the government provided travel for VP Biden's coke headed son to travel the world and get strippers pregnant.  so please, lets have this conversation sweetie.
Biden doesnt look like a rocket scientist even if compared to Don LeMon.
I really doubt they would. I’d assume they would pick some Senator who obviously doesn’t want it, who would then appoint Biden as VP and then resign.
Apparently the “timing of the Zoom” only hinders Biden
The copy machines came in late for Joe. Biden is mentally unfit for Office, watch and listen carefully. He is near the “puppet” stage doing what his controllers tell him to do. Reallly sad.
He wasn't on the vp committee.
Well thats not happening. I wanted it to be Castro. But it is Biden. So there ya go.  You can pray, whine, and fuss all you want, but that is the battle.   So support who you will. Stay on the sidelines. Vote Trumpy. My choice is clear. Support DACA, support public option.

You owe Joe Biden an apology.
So true. Yet Tulsi stayed in longer then everyone else except Bernie and Biden and only got 2 delegates. They honestly just embarrass themselves
Have you apologized to Biden yet?
I will vote for Joe Biden November 3rd. #WeWillVote
Looks like that tweet in April that Biden said Trumps would try to push back the election was right and you were wrong.
Trump is now suggesting delaying the November election.  Politically speaking, this would give him a chance to try to bounce back the economy before voters hit the polls, as he’s now trailing Biden by double digits.  However, he has no authority to do so.
Until now I have been pretty confident that Trump was going to win again. I am starting to think there is a "silent majority" building that will vote for Biden instead of Trump and just not tell anyone. Even down here in the South.
Since what Ron Johnson is doing against Biden is counterintelligence directly related to Volume 5 and could be in that volume, discussions of his efforts by Congress in the last few days should be seen as part of a larger Volume 5 effort.
They've been discussing Ron Johnson's efforts to import Russian disinformation into the effort against Biden, but Volume 5 is certainly related, so it could be both.
A delayed election will only lead to a delayed end to the pandemic shutdown. The Democrats need America in disarray to keep Biden off the debate stage until they election.
Hiding Biden’s feeble condition (that is impossible) only reveals the “manipulative left” who only seek power for themselves not good for the country. Will not work!!!

True. You can vote. I’ll vote too. Just not for Biden or Trump because these two seriously cant be the best there is to choose from

Just another reason to vote for Biden. We need to get this narcissist out of the White House. Remembering John Lewis’s courage and dignity will on empower our fight to get that back in the White House!
Extreme Embarrassment to our country &amp; the rule of law.  Dems call a lynching without a rope - almost as dumb as a candidate for Pres without a brain. Why would Dems ever put this in Nadler's hands? Or worse, in Biden's?
I don't understand. It's happening now under trump. We haven't even elected President Biden, yet. I guess this is President Obama's fault. The virus, economy, unemployment... Is it still 2020???
You do know that Joe Biden ran in 2008 (the same year as Obama) and didn’t win any delegates either which is why he dropped out so early. And still became Obama’s VP. Not to much of a difference with Kamala
hey kamaaalaaaa...you sleeping with Biden now???  Did you get the part???!!
I'm 100% convinced that this was a trump card in the last debate against Bernie. Whatever chance Bernie still had when Biden said this, it evaporated. It hit the exact right lib notes, and I'm mad Bernie didn't beat him to it.
I was gonna say, did someone find a plot to off Biden or something?? WTH??

Disagree in strategy Tom. If elected,  Biden is a 1 term president. He has 2 jobs: 1) stop the trainwreck 2) pick the next President as his VP.   I don't think Kamala checks off #2.

neolibs if biden gets elected
Ironic when that same nominee has ran for the office three times himself.   Additionally, Biden has already said that he’d be a one term President. Some NEEDS to be ambitious for 2024.   This train of thought is maddening.
Biden/Harris or Biden/Warren whatever, Never Trump.
That blank look on Biden is why they bar him from the car keys
I am starting to believe that Biden is being taken advantage of.  As financial reps we have to look for signs of elder abuse.  He is making statements and taking stances that are contrary to his past and being led around and scripted.  He’s diminished and being coerced.
Biden will help us trump is killing us
(bonus tweet)  And I wonder if this decision isn't an attempt to secure the votes of suburban folks who are being swayed toward Biden for the upcoming election.
Joe Biden has nothing to do with this Epstein... You should be worried about Trump.   # of women who have accused Trump of RAPE, MOLESTATION, SEXUAL ASSAULT = 34  # of women who have accused Biden = 1 (and Tara Reade was proven to be a liar and grifter)  Here's #TrumpleThinSkin

If Biden embraced Single Payer healthcare, he would have EVERY Bernie bro standing behind him.  He can't and won't  because of his dealings with the insurance industry.  They painted the mere idea of Single Payer Healthcare a FAR LEFT Socialist idea, and The D base bought it.

IT'S A JOE BIDEN ECHO CHAMBER!
He said that he was not going to vote for Biden three months ago.  There is no outreach here.  Just watching a grown person through a tantrum.  Over.  and Over.  and Over.
You have now said 39 times you will not be voting for Biden.  Ok we got it. You are not going to vote for Biden.
I loved Reagan also, but this is Biden starting where Reagan also.  He is out of it
He is now not voting for Biden 39 times.
Reagan was 77 years, 349 days old when he left office in 1989, the oldest to ever serve.  Joe Biden will be 77 years, 348 days on election day, November 3rd.
Dude, this tweet is trying to make it a thing that someone was holding Biden’s arm while he walked. You can’t have it both ways.
Oh yeah. Biden’s got this. He can just coast home.
Reagan was 77 years, 349 days old when he left office in 1989, the oldest to ever serve.  Joe Biden will be 77 years, 348 days on election day, November 3rd.

Literally, Joe Biden actually asleep would do a better job than you.
As Joe Biden said, the Federal government is perfectly capable of removing trespassers.
Reagan was 77 years, 349 days old when he left office in 1989, the oldest to ever serve.  Joe Biden will be 77 years, 348 days on election day, November 3rd.
Ryan already said he was not going to vote for Biden 32 times.  I think they need to revamp their US civics class in Canada.  You only get one vote.

Let me get this straight, all the polls showing him losing to Biden are ‘fake’ but the polls saying Fauci is more favorable he believes? To play victim? He can’t have this shit both ways.
Joe Biden been office 40 years can name a Socialist policy he has proposed?
So if Biden wins, Harris becomes our new President - just let that soak in for a moment - then either stay home or go vote for Trump.
Are Biden’s remarks scripted ?  Seems so.
Hate / Division / Fear = The Trump campaign model since 2015. I watched the entire 15 min Biden / Obama video and the entire message was, "We've got to work together &amp; find a way to relate to each other in order to get past these last 4 years."
Well you are currently doing whatever Putin wants, so I can’t see that Biden will be a problem.  Probably nobody likes you.  Oh, and you are still a traitor.
Just don't forget that the moment a multiracial coalition started to form was when Panther leadership was discredited and assassinated, then, and when the media coalesced around Biden, more recently. The mainstream coverage over the weekend was all "cops injured by angry mob."
I am voting for Biden
Biden says he will choose his running mate next week
She was who I originally wanted as the democratic nominee. So I supposed it’d be a bit of a consolation prize and still a historical first if they win. At this point, Biden could say he’s running with Screech from Saved By The Bell and I’d say “it’s alright...”😏
There was a lead story in the WaPo that twinned with Bedingfield said outlining the most Biden logic as to why it is going to be Kamala.
Biden's notes about Sen. Kamala Harris were on display during a campaign stop. “Do not hold grudges” tops the list.   via
Biden just said today he would lock down every state until Covid is gone. He is crazy!

I was playing a game of heart on line and in between hand Biden is advertising, I deleted the game
For instance todays sighting: white woman disagrees with black cashier while i was at ups. They go back n forth, white woman reaches peak loudness and says: this is why im voting for trump. I hate you mother fuckers. I thought about voting for biden but yall dont deserve peace.
So I saw a pic of a room in the WH that Melania had redone and whooooooo boy it’s gonna take Jill Biden a long time to fix all that shit.
Trump will win because at the first debate Biden will close with  It would be my honor to be President of the United States of ...... of ......um ..........um.... well whoopty got damndy doo
Finally Got my first Biden YouTube ad!!!! I cannot tell you how I have suffered under the onslaught of trump ads and surveys that seem to not recon with my viewing habits.
If   picks this loser #Republicans should be sure to get #TulsiGabbard  on the front row of ANY debate #KamalaHarris has the nerve to try with  . I believe this woman has way more baggage than the #Biden campaign can carry right now! That stench from her debate stuck.
Im with you.  I just hope Biden nominates a running mate that inspires some hope.
As much as I dislike Trump, I can’t say that I would feel any better if Biden was to win.  🤷🏾‍♂️   I’m kinda already use to one of these fools.  Bernie would’ve had my vote 100% tho.  I got luv for that dude.
Too easy? Where has Biden been? Not answering questions, avoiding press, trying to remember he’s running for office. All’s well. I hope you guys are all staying safe.
just thinking about how my uncle said “they should have gone with joe biden” in 2008 and now he’s a diehard trump supporter
Thank you, sir. I join millions who can’t wait to call you President Biden.
Rep. Brady: I'm not sure Biden understands the modern economy |
Plus the Biden conference. He had to get some air time ASAP
I still think it will be Hillary/Harris but they sure are dragging Biden along...
Biden was vp for 8 years and trump supporters still think he’s a communist
I mean treating the protestors like actual enemies of the state and using the actual military, like Trump threatened early on, not just National Guard. I feel like a “Tiananmen Square” moment is more likely under Trump than Biden.
Juan, You are horrible. Fox News please let him gone. He needs to rest before his mind is completely like Biden.
Is it just me or did Joe Biden look EXCEPTIONALLY alert during today's new conference?  Check out those WIDE open eyes #JoeBiden
Biden has run a superb campaign thus far
can we be honest Joe biden or  Donald "Tiny Hands" is the right people for the country, so you dont gain anything about bashing the other guy they both terrible, Trump is idiot and Joe might be having a little dementia playing here.. so either way we all Fu**ed
im not fan of joe biden but the man not even in office yet.. this is white america problem vote same republicans in office over and over and what  you got show for it  big tax cuts for the wealthy and second amendment  babble about don't tread on me slogans.
Listen to Vice President Biden's Build Back Better speech is like a breath of fresh air compared to trumps mumble through of the reading (which he can barely do) of his incoherent covid pep rally. which goes off the rails in tangent of ignorance.
This time Biden had Teleprompters , last time it was earbuds to tell him what to do. I bet those handlers were typing their little fingers to the bone trying to keep him on track!#Biden Press Conference
Biden on CNN right now sounds clear as a bell. Gtfo.
Biden just bitched that the president uses executive orders. I bet he didn’t clear that with President Obama.
Miranda Devine: Biden's platform a 'sham,' he's an 'empty shell' |
anyone else fucking terrified that theyre gonna have to vote for biden just because he's not trump at this point
I’m wondering whose speech  Biden is reading from the teleprompter.
Honey, have a drink. Biden's somewhere sniffin' tweenagers...that's a much bigger problem. 🤡🖕🏻

Yeah Biden will just kill babies
is a 🥜 case. I’ve met him in person several times. I’m not sure he’s well in the head. Maybe he should be checked along with Biden.
Impeached for life. Thanks to the Putin owned GOP Senate. People see it. That is why Biden will win your state.

‘It's absolutely serious’: Susan Rice vaults to the top of the VP heap
I’ve had so many of them respond back with crazy nonsense.  They really believe that this is Biden’s fault because trump told them it is!  I can’t fathom the level of stupidity it would require to believe this clap trap!
someone: biden's not who i wanted but i'm so anxious all the time and want a temporary reprieve from trump's abuse-  leftist: you're wrong and also a piece of shit for wanting that. voting for biden will open the door for more abuse and you'll deserve it. stupid liberal.
basically says says if Biden wins by a large margin, there’s nothing trump can do. If not, chaos reigns.
removed it lol they backing Biden?
If Trump refuses to leave, what are they gonna do, call the cops? “Yes, hello, 911, this is Joe Biden. I’d like to report a dictator.” Trump is never going to admit defeat. He is not capable of it.
Biden is the nominee so I would argue the left never had the middle. Smartin’ up Elon. Lol.
What if, in 2009, President Obama and Vice President Biden had said, in the ashes of the economic failures of a Republican administration, "not our problem -- created by Bush" rather than doing what they did.....  Accept responsibility for fixing it......
Ignore the #CDC on this ... they are hoping for funding from the Democrats should Biden win the upcoming election ... Hydroxychloroquine has been used for decades &amp; when combined with other medications IS EFFECTIVE

Joe Biden Unveiled a ‘Women's Agenda’ That Acknowledges That Most Issues Are Women's Issues  “Women's issues” used to be political shorthand for abortion and gender discrimination. But in 2020, Joe Biden is grasping that all issues are women's issues.
Oh look, it's another white man with an opinion. We must call Joe Biden and put you in touch!
If you still haven't decided whether to vote for Biden in November, even after the deaths of over 150,000 people from Covid, Vote for Trump already. This "he's got to earn it" bullshit is really old, and no one thinks you'll do the right thing anyway.
I’m in Tennessee and I’m riding with Biden and will be taking my vehicle and driving others to vote for him too
I will vote for Biden if he picks anyone but Harris. Period.  No poll watching. No canvassing. No hosting.  Ps I am not khive... I lack their level of Energy.  I supported Castro. But they are right on this 100%.
Your line...   My politics are too liberal for the corrupt Clinton-Obama-Biden Democrats.  I’ll go vote Republican, at least they’re honest about their corrupt whoring
That's Joe Biden touching children on Camera. Sick Joe Biden.
Who writes these Tweets? And why isn’t it Joe Biden?
I don’t think Biden will run in 2024.
We had leverage? You think if Biden won we get power? The dude the proclaimed to own us?
Bloomberg was still in too, he took votes away from Biden.
Her explanation on why she won't just endorse Biden is the biggest bunch of word salad I've  heard from anyone besides Trump.
Biden campaign official dismisses report of rift with Harris: 'Don't believe everything that you read'  #FoxNews
Joe Biden, don't know what day it is...(lol)
The election is not going to trend. Once you drag old man Joe Biden. I laugh every time I hear how far Joe Biden is leading you in the polls. You can't live in the basement and be the president.
"My thinking about #KamalaHarris is that she comes from a state, #California, that #JoeBiden doesn’t need to win. #ValDemings comes from #Florida, which Biden really would like to win." #BretStephens making an interesting point 🤔
Everyone needs to see this if you are thinking about getting Corona vaccine. Bumbling Bill is as Bad as Bumbling Biden. Very nervous when interviewed.
Why do you think they have focused on Hunter Biden for supposed bribes and money laundering? Because that's what Trump Jr. is guilty of.
BIDEN will not debate TRUMP
Khive will say anything. Picking a cop would not be a good move right now.
Y’all just cannot convince me that a Biden presidency would be worse than a Trump presidency. Please stop playing games.

Your residents chose Biden over Bernie by a large margin tho.
Don't let all this distract you from the fact the left wont allow biden to even answer questions on camera without a month of prep and they will never let him debate. Ask yourselves why?
I can’t wait to find out what radical, America hating, power hungry woman Joe Biden picks as his VP!
And Biden is a Lyin Dog Faced Pony Soldier!!
Pretty sure we all remember a much different and better America under Joe Biden a mere four years ago.
I guess they live in fear about having a woman running this country if Biden become too mental disorganized with his thought process 🤔
I’ve seen a lot of local election candidate signs and bumper stickers. And I’ve seen a lot of Trump stickers and signs   But I haven’t seen not one Biden sign or sticker 😗  Just making sure we was all on the same page for the election in November 👀
Kamala has been going around the country like Flo-Jo ever since she dropped out of the race. Creating bills and advocating for Joe Biden. She deserves respect!
Biden winning is the only damn thing that matters now and we should take all the help we can get. This is war.
Biden Bomaye! + other Biden wins America back t-shirts
It is silly to get stressed out about his vice presidential candidate. There is literally almost no one who will vote for Trump because they don’t like who Biden picks as a VP
Hey all you “Blue no matter who” sell-outs, watch as the JOE BIDEN and the BIDEN Democrats try to kill Medicare for All, which they will thanks to everyone who voted for them!
What would get you excited about Joe Biden?
Some people do not need to bring up such pettiness. Do we need a dictator (Trump ) or do we need a person that is compassionate &amp; WON’T let our Unite States be destroyed like it is being done today! Yes we need JOE BIDEN to run our country ( AMERICAN ) !!!
Radical left Joe Biden
AMEN AMEN!!!  We need someone named Joe Biden!!
Disappears from the media. Don't be surprised to see a sudden arrival of a vaccine either if Biden wins. All this mess is too coincidental for it NOT to be political.
If I were president I would show some balls and shake their hands!  He is a good president! ♥️  1000% better than Biden would be.  But he could be a better, more fearless leader if he choose to be this!
I will support any VP candidate Biden picks. And will be vigorous in my support.
Untold Truth: COVID-19 will last through to the election. If Biden wins, it disappears. If Trump wins, it stays. One-world government is the goal. If you don't believe politics is driving COVID, BLM, and Antifa, you're sleep! Why is ALL THIS MESS happening in an election year???
The conspiracy-theory hemisphere of my brain keeps telling me that **ump knows he's going to lose so he's making things as worse as possible to dig Biden a hole so deep that he can run on it in 2024
The democrats went through a long process to pick a presidential candidate and got Joe Biden. This was the best they can do? 🤡🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻
Linda sounds dismayed that Biden isn’t more like Trump.    (Trump supporters are grasping for straws to jump-start a campaign that is on life-support.)
Biden already got that one. 🖕🏻

If Biden will not be interviewed, then Trump should refuse all interviews too
Biden is brain-dead.
I hope Kamala Harris is Biden VP
Well we know where you get your news from. I guess you prefer the looting, burning, destruction, murder, mayhem going on vs Homeland Security detaining those responsible. I guess Biden and these progressive mayors are going to fix it, lol surely you don't believe that.
Hmm, the only other choice is Biden that is miles in the other direction from Reagan. You libtards don't understand that it has so much less to do with Trump than it has to do with Not Clinton and Not Biden. We're not just voting FOR Trump, we're voting AGAINST your ideology!!!

I did. Never in my life have I. This time I did. Chip in to elect Joe #Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
if Biden don’t keep the prophet’s name out of his crusty mouth I-
Biden shouldn't do anything to distract from Trump destroying himself.
This is TRUMP’s America, you created with your lack of leadership, hate speech and divide/conquer tactics. I donated to Joe Biden’s presidential campaign earlier today. Bring back decency to OUR White House. 💙 Change is coming. #GestapoTrump
Basement Biden, still in hiding and ducking interviews. America will not tolerate a coward as President.
Lol!! The Republicans want voter ID. Which proves you are you and you voted for whoever. Dems want to send out mass ballots and no voter ID and your wondering why I said Dems. There is no way Biden could without mail in ballots. Unless rigged!!
Biden Speaks at Democrat Party Event Honoring Mock Trump Killer Kathy Griffin  via
President Biden, TEAR DOWN THAT WALL!!!
Biden campaign declines 'Fox News Sunday' interview, 1 week after Chris Wallace's Trump sitdown   ⁦ Chris has got to ride Biden’s ass until he submits to an interview.
Just Biden my time until 11/3!
Nope. Just value what someone does vs what they say.  Biden had 40+ yrs to impact Black lives &amp; didn’t. Trump funded HBCUs, minority businesses, &amp; had lowest black unemployment pre-pandemic. At some point 1 has to realize how they’ve been voting for 40 yrs ain’t working for them.
So, do you know if your plan is Biden's plan?
The man wants to be President but he won’t even take a question   Biden is a joke
Biden is a pederass. Mail in voting is a scam. Those for it know it is the easiest way to cheat. Using fake tenants to get extra ballots, votes being thrown in the dumpster. Hundreds of ballots are found lost or thrown out. It's a complete scam. Lefties continue to destroy the US
Biden's path to the White House could hit a dead end on Facebook
Biden, Dr Fauci and the governors should come up with a plan. All they would need from Trump is a pledge not to sabotage it.
Biden, what a joke. He is afraid to do an interview withChris Wallace. If he can’t handle this, he can’t handle being President.
the Empress is tired and confused.  She doesn't understand that Trump can take unscripted questions for 2 hours without notes and Biden can't get through a scripted interview with screwing up.   but good try my dear.
Exactly. I have zipped my lip since Warren dropped out. I cant manage to get excited by Biden but whatever. My vote will count the same regardless. They best lay off AOC, though. 🙄
Biden has been a Senator for 40 years and VP for 8.  Dude had almost 50 years &amp; did nothing but suddenly going to do something now?
Did you get that from your huge 19 person turnout.  Good luck Herbert Biden.
Not sure why Black folks would vote for Biden.  Sponsored the crime bill in 90s. His justification was he didn’t want his kids growing up in a “jungle”. Also on video using the n word.  Google is your friend- use it.  No way you vote for this imbecile if you’re  informed.
This will be in every city if Biden is elected!
Are you sure it's not democrats.. They did start impeachment trails a day of the China trade agreement!! You know Hunter BIDEN got 1.5 billion from China
Far more likely that Biden is a better partner to our allies and the freer world in gen. Putin has less control. That's appeal of the Donald; water boy who thinks he's 1st string.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
This is what happens when Biden’s news source is CNN 🙄🙄
How can Joe Biden handle being president when he cannot handle an interview with Chris Wallace
Fake polls.. The only thing Biden will win in 2020 are fake polls
And yet, Biden is beating you in the polls in Arizona – which is a state a Democrat hasn't won in forever, loser.
Why would you stop being critical of Biden? Does anybody really know.  Maybe there is something in it for you? Only time will tell.
Mark supports Trump in the general. The primary is over. Bernie endorsed Biden. Mark endorsed Trump.
Yes their idea of the end is very odd. How can they see danger in Biden but not in Trump?!!!
No true Republican could ever, EVER vote for Joe Biden.
I don’t.  Biden is comfortable enough in lead that he will go for the safe choice. But he can’t go with a moderate white woman, because that would be a bridge too far.  Harris has high levels of support in Black community as a whole, it’s the younger voters against her.
My 70 year old parents, sister and brother in law have always voted republican and this year they are voting for Joe Biden. Change is coming! Suck it up buttercup
Careful kiddies, the Obama excrement is surfacing and some around him may need to leave the Country. Damping evidence has been shown since last year... and we know about Biden.
Fuck Biden 2020
Sen.  you seem to be a fan favorite amongst many contenders for the Veep spot on the Biden ticket. Would you care to put us out of our misery and share if it will indeed be you or not? Maybe even what your chances might be, if you can't say with certainty.
What brings you to this conclusion? Also, do you think that will help or hurt Biden's chances?
Biden has been a Congressman for 40 plus years.
Almost Every policy Joe Biden is trying to repeal, are policies he signed and help place into law. He’s a huge contributer to the marginalization in America. But leftist would never murmur, the facts of the accusation.
But how do we break it, Brit? It even goes largely unreported by Fox who is stuck on 24 hr Covid &amp; Antifa/BLM coverage with a Biden story thrown in briefly between.  Particularly,  has had some great, yet largely ignored pieces.  Get your heads together &amp; get it out.
WRONG!! He wants to cut more but he needs democrat votes.. &amp; you will gladly take the tax cuts &amp; still vote for BIDEN because of insanity
I’m voting for Joe Biden. #ResistanceTaskForce
This election is important and i believe a pedophile shouldn’t be able to lead a country. Which Joe Biden by video evidence totally is. You might be okay with pedos but I’m not.
Biden will probably select a former prosecutor (super cop) as his VP. I didn’t think she was even liked among rank and file democrats. Some say Susan Rice, but that would be a tough sell, she was the Benghazi lady who said it was caused by a provocative video on YouTube.
This announcement coincides with the final day of early voting here. What are your guesses for Biden's running mate selection?
I’m having internal struggles right now with a close relative who thinks people who protest online just think “everything in the world is wrong”. They are not a trump supporter per se but they won’t vote Biden because of liberal ideology. What’s the other choice?????

I tell you something that concerns me a lot. I am voting for Biden but I have not seen a single Biden yard sign but plenty of Trump signs and even a billboard or two.
More of the same if Biden gets elected. You're fooling yourself if you think he'll be different.
we must defeat trump at all costs, the worst president of all time, the source of all evil etc etc etc, but can anyone actually tell me *policy* prescriptions (not platitudes like “he believes in sCiEnCe!!) of biden’s that would change the state of things AT ALL
the real story is that biden’s team of advisors is made up of ‘90s welfare reform sickos who reinforced this arrangement and wouldn’t run it any differently!
Right? They think the majority of Dems/Biden voters want to vote by mail. Nope. We just want the *option* available. I will be going to vote at my precinct.
Usually VP’s are selected in August. Biden secured the nomination abnormally early so it makes it seem like he should already have one.
ANTIFA has taken over and is hiding behind the #BlackLivesMatter movement. In addition, any money that goes to BLM ends up in Joe Biden’s campaign fund.
That NYC billionaire has donated his entire salary while he’s been potus!  Never has any other President done that!  Biden &amp; his family became millionaires, while he was VP!  Wake up!  #BidenIsARacist #bidenscognitivedecline
How is Trump working for you. Obviously you prefer a racist.  Who cares about friend or uncle. I am not thrilled with everything about Biden. I just never thought I would see you try to shift support to Trump.
That's FUNNY!! We deserve a president who won't allow his son to receive 1.5 billion from China for doing NOTHING! BIDEN used his office for personal gain for decades meaning he quit on us long along
I agree Biden doesn’t have to be your friend. If you feel Trump can move you closer to your goals for justice and equality .... carry on!!!
A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn’t pretty  via   So our Constitution no longer works?

It's not a perfect upcoming election. I voted Bernie in the past 2 primaries &amp; Hillary in the last election. I'll vote Biden because he isn't a fucking monster. He won't be perfect but honestly he just has to have a pulse to be better than Trump.
Well gotta go. More important things to do like make some more Donald Trump posters. We have some large rallys coming up soon. Many Biden memes to make. To bad you're on the wrong side of the planet. Have you been practicing your Mandarin lately?

We all will be able to relax when Biden starts fixing what trump messed up
The man to do so is in the office, but these chicken shit governors are so scared of offending people when laws are being broken and lives threatened. Please tell me Kent you don’t think Biden is the answer?
To be clear, not voting for either major party candidates as they currently seem to be slotted. There is no good choice between Trump or Biden.

Kanye West tweets he 'can beat Biden off of write ins'  #FoxNews
And Joe Biden spoke much of their slander against Blacks that the MSM is refusing to air during his time as a senator.
These must be charges against Biden because he supports China and he supported the spying on Trump both before and after the 2016 election.
I don’t like all of your politics, but you are a way better choice than Biden.
School Choice! Economy! US Manufacturing and Pharmaceutical Companies! Basically, what he has been trying to do, without the help of Congress...and just keep preaching how Biden has been in office half a Century and has done nothing!
GREAT! She's been my favorite from the beginning. If you didn't see her at work during the multiple senate hearings, you missed seeing someone who has everything it takes to be ready on Day 1.   Harris seen as Biden VP favorite as clock ticks
I'd rather end up on  lawn. Wouldn't want Biden to have to clean up the mess, right?
He’s gonna win if Biden doesn’t lol. Biden is the lesser of the evils

Haven’t seen a Biden flag yet around here   Starting to think the polls are lying again  Trump 2020 🇺🇸
“Beat Biden Off” ...Not the image I wanted 😭
She’d better be, Biden won’t.
If Trump loses he will say it was rigged and fake news which makes his supporters riot. If Biden loses Democrats might just riot because of four more years of Trump
Fuck that sums him up perfectly! November can’t come soon enough! Blue wave is coming. Biden doesn’t even need to campaign. Trump is done sr done.
Don’t give Joe Biden any ideas.
does  know you want to beat Biden off?
The key to all of this is what happens on 11/3. Biden has already said in his 1st 100 days he is for “expanding the number of high-skilled visas and eliminating the limits on employment-based visas by country, which create unacceptably long backlogs.”
It's strange watching some of the same Black people who dislike Biden because of the 1994 Crime Bill praise Trump for unconstitutionally sending federal law enforcement into Chicago, "because something has to be done." Y'all so fickle.
Joe Biden's Plagiarism Problem
No. But Quit calling Trump a racist if you arent gonna call out Biden...which is dishonest...thats all.
Yea....right... Biden " obama is first mainstream african american that is articulate and clean".... Look it up.

Careful - if Biden is elected, his VP will be President within a year.
Great discussion. Will sway. I have voted D my whole life. So far, Biden is WAY too soft on CCP. The Chinese government is an existential threat to US and should be treated as such, IMO.
And I’m once again asking you to fucking run in the election so we don’t have bumble worded Biden or the walking Nickelodeon logo for four more fucking years but we don’t all get what we want, do we?!?
Do you understand Trump  loyalty base?The polls want us to think Biden is ahead. Most Americans do not want socialism which is where Dems are headed. It won't be Biden cuz he can't. It will have to be his VP or someone else that does biz. Sad his family lets him be embarrassed.
Joe sniffing hair publicly makes the claims against him much more credible. He's openly pedophillic and perverted, Trump is not. Biden's actions make claims against him much more credible.

🤣🤣🤣 Joe Biden couldn’t lead a camel to water!!! How the heck do you think he could run a country!!! 🤦‍♂️
&amp; you believe hiding Biden is leading in the polls.. 😆
No, that's Biden. He's the one that sniffs small girls on the regular, has much more credible accusations against him, and says plenty of racist things (like if you don't for for him "you ain't Black" or "poor kids can be just as bright and just as talented as White kids").
Oh yeah he will!! I mean there can’t be that many dumbasses in the country to vote Biden.
#Biden and people like #NancyPelosi are the types to learn the words to Project Pat: Gorilla Pimp so they can rap along with other black people just to get their vote. And that's all it would take for most 🤦🏾‍♂️

Wtf is wrong with you? Believe it or not  millions of US citizens either support Biden outright or will support him because they realize the dangers of trump. And how you suport a man who insulted you and your wife is also despicable.
They even showed a Biden campaign ad when they broke away. Faux News has also become an enemy of the people.

Who are you talking to? I said Biden was racist. You're convincing me of something I already know. Now I'm asking you to admit that Trump is openly and obviously racist
But work for Biden and the Democrats like they were all behind!
Trump must declare a national emergency and arrest all Dem leaders that are leading and coordinating behind the scenes this insurgency. This would include Mayors, Governors, Dem House Reps, Dem Senators, also include Pelosi, Obama, Biden, and the Clintons. They are all traitors.

Business outside the country is legal!! But China does own you.. ..like they own BIDEN! Democrats get foreign FUNDING paid to their children
Do we have any reason to believe Biden will remove secret police from cities? He supports more funding for police and has proposed no legislation for curbing their unchecked authority. I think people just want to pretend like he won’t be equally as authoritarian as Trump.

Am I missing something? Trump lost the popular vote, had a 0% margin in PA, 2% in FL, and 8% in Ohio. All the demographics are moving in Biden’s favor. And point to me what group of Clinto voters are flipping to Trump. The same turnout ratios point to Biden winning.
It was Trump who initiated the travel ban from China (end of January) and then Europe but Nancy was telling everyone to go to Chinatown (end of February) and Biden said Trump was fear-mongering and xenophobic for doing it.
Joe Biden has a long to-do list if he wins the White House

Because their all friends with Biden. He taught them everything thing they know. That’s why they won’t release records about his molesting people.
The difference is Biden was told to cancel it. Trump makes his own decisions
I can’t wait to to vote for Joe Biden!!! Get you’re azzz GONE!!!
A Socially Distanced Conversation: President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden  via
Can’t wait to watch the Biden vs Trump presidential debates ...  is going to utterly TEAR  apart ... I can see biden stuttering, hesitating, and having so many brain farts and Trump just clowning him. I don’t even really follow politics, but I can’t miss this.
Remember when we did this and the only thing you had to say was that Biden is also racist? You still need to go back and finish that part of the conversation before you can get to this one. I'm begging you to learn how to use your brain
You want us to believe Biden is less mentally capable than Trump? We have eyes and ears.Take a look at who’s winning the mental acuity contest.
Same here! The difference between Biden and Trump will be dramatic—but not in the way you’re hoping.
*Boris Epshteyn shits his pants*  "These are Joe Biden's pants"
It’s a nonissue,President Trump will beat brain dead Joe Biden like a big bass drum!
My 90 year old mother, who has lived all her life in  Arkansas and forced by my deceased father to watch fox on a loop for the last 30 years, had the same response. However on a happy note I am 90% sure she will vote for Biden and 100% sure she will not be voting for trump.
It's the folks propping up Biden who really want suburbs turned into ghettos. People like AOC, Booker, Pelosi, along with many others. It's disgusting. They want everyone else to live in poverty while they remain rich. That's socialism.
That is a flat out lie:
Trump is the only one standing up to China. Biden, has been bought by China....

Fox News Poll: Biden tops Trump in battlegrounds Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania
My husband &amp; I were just talking about that ridiculous polling  Fox!  There’s absolutely no way that Biden could be ahead of President Trump anywhere!
Obama didn’t endorse  PUBLICLY until later because he didn’t want to sway anyone’s opinion!! There’s people that didn’t like Obama but would support Biden.    is smart. Unlike trump who doesn’t seem to understand political strategies.Yet he’s the president?
I’m so sick of ppl saying they are going to vote 3rd party 🙄 Seriously Ppl how well did that work out for us in 2016?  Is Biden the best? NO Is he the worst? Seriously hve you seen or heard the twat waffle in the WH?   3rd party vote is literally hurting the progressive movement
People are really mad because Biden wants to put affordable housing in the suburbs😂
BOMBSHELL: FBI Investigated Joe Biden's Campaign for Corruption
I really hope Biden gets in man. Idk though. I’m really worried trump won’t give up power. Last election was rigged for him by Cambridge Analytica... wouldn’t be surprised if something similar was used this election.
Me too. Do they not know that not voting for Biden is a vote for Bernie?
Joe Biden is leading...NOT..  YOU should have stopped right there  Joe doesnt know hes even running.
I’ve seen one moron with a Biden sign.
HUGE! Polls From Battleground States Show President Trump is Crushing Sleepy Joe Biden
As Biden said, the federal government is perfectly capable of escorting trespasses out of the White House.

These idiots keep using our current situation to warn us about a Biden president. Bitch, this IS the trump presidency, we’ll take our chances.

Trump stated it correctly. Fact check it! “I’ve done more for black Americans than anybody with the possible of exception of Abraham Lincoln,” the president said. “Nobody has even been close.”
you aren't the problem is Biden's polling worse than Hillary with minority voters, and that's why hillary lost(spare me your conspiracy theories).  Biden can't win without minority turn out, so I'll have to see it too believe it.
Y'all think the conspiracy theories are wild now? Just wait until a vaccine is finally available after Biden is elected.
They've purchased blackness from Joe Biden for hundreds of thousands of black voters who would otherwise not get to be black according to Joe.
Well yea, Gotta kiss China's ass for all that NIKE money.   Biden will work hard keeping China happy.  Democrats still love their slaves
Fact...Biden " Obama first mainstream Black who is articulate and clean."
Hello, FEC?  and  boost Biden's LIE that Trump is America's ‘first’ racist president
. paranoia: Any attempt to investigate  is a Russian plot
Biden is a puppet we all know it.  Only a fool would vote for a Democrat with their hate.   What will they hate on next?  Any people that would cause so much destruction and chaos can't be trusted to run America.  They are so dam desperate.  Why?
CNN's Alisyn Camerota plays Schumer's sob sister, frets Russia may smear Biden, GOP might replace Ginsburg!

I don’t interpret speaking “on behalf” of Biden to mean speaking instead of Biden.  Rather, I interpret on behalf to mean in support of.
Biden doesn't deserve such an honor. This prominent position shouldn't be given to shoulder toucher or back rubber. This special position is reserved for only the best grabbers among us. #MAGAts
The Heat Is ON: Biden Campaign Goes On Defense Over Senate Burisma Investigation
Thank you! How does he think using live images of the country under HIS leadership works against Biden? It just shows a country on the brink because of his inability to lead due to his constant attention to dividing.
This is Trump's country. Biden will stop this racist nonsense that you support. Then you will be just another footnote and nobody in a time where 40% of the country showed how stupid they are.
Do we really need to read about Biden's fantasies? What a 💩brain..o wait that's to high a level of intelligence..what a 💩face.
If Biden won the election I would know it was because of fraud. I will not accept that there are that many brain dead voters in the USA.
Joe Biden Correctly Labels Donald Trump First Racist President Named Donald Trump

I'm convinced trump &amp; McConnell have already stolen the election. Biden will get 5 - 10 MILLION more votes, but trump will easily win the EC. Rigged voting machines, voter suppression, and foreign hacking will make the "win" plausible. This is Putin's plan. What will we do then?
Trump campaign turns tables on Biden claim that president is racist |
Remember the Sanders spin... Obama hates Biden.
Yeah, if this is Biden’s America, how come it’s happening under Trump? It’s almost as if it’s Trump’s America.
Danny lay off RoadDogg! You must be a Biden Suppoorter
Trump has a core of voters who stick. Those are the only ones Trump can rally. They'd stay with Pence in any case, and Pence could attract disaffected Republicans (and some Independents) who loathe Trump to the point of not voting, or voting for Biden.
islam IS islam🏔️Subversive Of Society. What it that Biden does not understand about destroying America?😇
The sad thing is: If Biden ran in 2016 I think he would have won

Biden Could Quickly Reverse Trump’s Military Transgender Ban, Group Says
Biden will be an absolute disaster. He has been on the wrong side of debates for as long as he has been in politics, from busing to marriage equality. One of the most corrupt people in politics, enriching his family off the backs of the American people for 50 years. #VoteGold
Biden and Obama slam into Trump's coronavirus response in new video.  via
Trump doesn't give a Damn about our Veterans. But, Joe Biden does!! #JoeBidenForPresident2020
At the time, sadly that was not considered racist. It was an acceptable norm. Biden is right that Trump is the first openly racist (meaning socially abhorrent) candidate and president. It's "supposed" to be unacceptable at this time.
WTF... The article paraphrased Biden's comments and added quotation marks.   This is a not only a misquote but a total lie. Biden obviously never said it.
It's sad how far America has fallen. We are a joke to the entire world because of Trump  Biden may not be as sharp as he once was but he's still a better choice for President than #TraitorTrump  Trump brags about passing a dementia test &amp; let's Russia put bounties on the military
So if Biden, whose mental health is definitely on the decline, wins the first woman president will have gotten into office based on technicality?
So Biden chooses to ignore Woodrow Wilson and LBJ?  Both Democrats.  And how about himself?  He is also quite the racist, is he not?
How pathetic Biden hides in his basement from America. He is scared to come out because he might screw up. He lets his campaign aides write his tweets he is only to glad to plagiarize.
Yes it’s a plain miss. It speaks to the plain door liberals have to the racists history of this country and it’s leadership. BUT ..Biden would STILL BE better that 45.  We can fix him after his election.
politicians are dumb AS HELL   how are you gonna say “this would be biden’s america” while literally showing footage of trump’s failing america?? make it make sense. i’m waiting
And you know this how, Jack. You're not a neurologist, but an eye doc by training. So what qualifies YOU to cast such a medical opinion. Thought you were talking about #SleepyJoe Biden, actually. Your shoe fits that iteration...Clyburn will take Biden to the White house.  He will be on media along with Obama.  Let's March for our future!
Florida Teen Behind Mass Twitter Hack Including Kim Kardashian, Joe Biden, Arrested:
I always wondered how someone like Joe Biden can become mega-rich on a meager government salary.  This is the reason.  We need a revolution.
You are 100% right! But only because you will never make it to your inauguration. Your senility will cause your disqualification. So, after Obama speech today, my money for Biden VP is either Susan Rice or Loretta Lynch. #obamaneverleft #obamaneveragain
Agreed, so start the same structure 3 weeks before Election Day. People need not be confused-Biden is in no shape to debate. I was just giving it the benefit of the doubt. It is very likely should Biden win, he will never be inaugurated. VP pick will tell us all we need to know😬
And Biden doesn’t have dimentia lol
Why would we listen, when we already know what you have to say.   Trump bad. Biden good.   I have nothing against you, but you simply aren’t interesting.
The 2016 election was the most FRAUDULENT and INACCURATE in history.  It still is a great embarrassment to the USA!  Let’s speed up election 2020 so that you may go away!  #Biden #thursdaymorning #Biden2020Landslide #ToodlesTrump
Voter fraud...  Yeah!  That’s the ticket.  #Biden #thursdaymorning #TrumpKnewAndDidNothing
Biden is gonna lose 40 States, the House and 5 Senate seats....
Can MS Obama please be the VP just for a little while? Maybe a year or two? That would seal the deal for Biden. We can’t take chances now. Trump and the  are going to cheat. 🙏
EXACTLY!  To be honest, I think Trump is a pompous prick and never liked him. I never watched his show and always thought he had a punchable face.  BUT he has my vote for president because he is better than Biden.  He's done some good and a lot of bad, and I'll call him on all.
Trump supporters are too blinded by allegiance to admit that he started the lockdowns and is the driver for mandatory Covid vaccinations.  I’m voting for the guy because Biden BUT let’s be honest, he kinda sucks.
1 step farther out of touch? Diaper Boy Joe Biden
Yet small business are still shut down and business owners are getting arrested.  Trump started the lockdowns. How's that curve going?  I am voting for Trump, but don't act like he doesn't suck. Biden just sucks more.
Actually this is Trump's America.  People keep saying this is how it will be with Biden. Well, it's like that now.  Trump is weak and is too busy sparring on Twitter to do any real work.   I am over it. Voting  2020.
