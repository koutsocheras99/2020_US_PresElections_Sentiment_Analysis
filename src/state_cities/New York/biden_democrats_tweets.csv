I just voted for Biden.
I would just add that, for the record, I want Biden to pick Susan Rice. But that seems unlikely now with all the leaking going on.
I feel like all the BS coming from old white guys around Biden about not liking Kamala Harris makes it more likely he will pick Kamala Harris. She is obviously a great pick but also does he really want to seem overly influenced by a bunch of old white dudes at this point in time?
What do you think? Is the RAT Ticket going to be  BIDEN and HEELS UP

Biden isn't Hillary, and then there's his wonderful 4-year record to look at now...   And all the tweets...  And...
biden tryna talk bout anti corruption &gt;&lt;
Byrd by the way was a Democrat. Look up speeches that Biden talked about him. Will make you puke. Biden is the racist, not Trump. Lowest unemployment for blacks proves that.
I use to have a favorite one, but now I‚Äôm old and don‚Äôt remember which one. Kind of like Joe Biden and cities he thinks he is currently in.
Wrong again young man!! Look up Senator Byrd, who Joe Biden loved and supported. Byrd was a clansman. Look up who the person you are voting for on busing and his statement on the jungle. Seems to me you need a history lesson.
Okay I didn‚Äôt come here to hear from Biden come on
Joe Biden is brain dead.
Joe Biden wouldn‚Äôt know what day it was if his handlers didn‚Äôt tell him.
Joe Biden is brain dead.  Stay in your basement joe.
Does joe Biden know what 2 plus2 is?
Joe Biden is not living on this planet. Something is wrong with him.
Biden led in all swing states
The amazing cure will only take place with a Biden win.
A joe Biden voter for sure
Joe Biden is an idiot! I can‚Äôt see him running a 7-11.
Look. Trump must be removed by hook or crook. I‚Äôd vote for Biden if he selects ‚Äúall of the above‚Äù or ‚Äúnone of the above‚Äù or in between.  Come on ppl. Get a grip. Be she ambitious, persistent or neither, support whomever he selects. Our lives are literally at stake. #Biden
in '08 I assumed that he picked up Biden to Make People Not Be Nervous and would swap him out in '12 for someone he actually wanted to succeed him and was VERY surprised when he kept Biden as VP. Then again reportedly they worked really well together?
‚ÄúBiden prevailed in Michigan because the two oldest voting categories cast a decisive 52 percent of the ballots.‚Äù
Biden... didn't run in 2016, because his son had just died and he wanted to get the hell out of politics, and that's why the momentum of the 2016 primaries changed to assumption-of-incumbent to gamergate-3.0-free-for-all-against-Hillary? Unless I'm /gravely/ mistaken
do they fucking WANT another "meeeehhhhh I don't feel like running for president" leading into another fuckin 2016 primary (my sympathies to Joe Biden not wanting to run in '16 but)
The only thing this Democrat cares about this year is "Win the election by a blue tidal wave."  I can nitpick all day about every potential VP choice. But at the end of the day: Any of them teamed with Biden is a far better choice for the country than 4 more years of Trump/Pence.
Irony has died so many times the past 4 years I've lost count. But a couple of its more notable deaths: outrage at Bill Clinton's womanizing &amp; outrage that Joe Biden's son might have cashed in on his father's name.
#coworker made a comment that Biden opened his mouth and stupid came out.  I waited, she asked if I was a Biden man.  We went a few rounds, I mentioned  treason.  She said tRump has never committed treason and everything  he did has made America better.
As a liberal Democratic voter who is working hard to get Biden elected and is looking forward to casting my vote for Biden, I agree with you 100%.  Folks: If you keep saying "Biden's not exciting enough", you're helping Trump out.  #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica

Yes, Joe Biden won‚Äôt consider a Latino for VP, while we have....Mike Pence?
Um... Neither did Biden?? And I also wouldn't say Obama really paid his respects either. He just kind of used the funeral is an opportunity to bash Trump. And were there masks? It was awfully crowded. ü§∑ü§¶
Biden should hold off on announcing his running mate until the Trump campaign resumes buying &amp; creating ads.
Biden should promise a week-long Twitter moratorium after Inauguration Day.
My own preference is for someone who is at least 15 years younger than Biden. Other than that, I don't have any strong preferences.  But I'll gladly vote for Biden even if he chooses another septuagenarian for VP.  #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica2020

If you live with that mentality saying Biden 2020 is also racist. If trump was racist he would have no black supporters and he has millions
But if VP Biden is entertaining diverting some funds from police budgets then he is in favor of defunding the police!
Of course unless Biden wins, then November 4th it will disappear. Jim Jordan destroyed Fauci in his questioning. Exposed him for the political hack he is.
And how many would be dead if biden was president. He can‚Äôt even put a goddamn sentence together

Yeah I 100% would want Warren for Treasury Secretary, and even better I think Biden would too.
Biden repeatedly pushed bill in Senate that critics said would have made investigating police officers for misconduct more difficult -
Was Hunter an adviser to VP Biden?   Now talk about the jobs created for Ivanka and Jared.  You have no sense of irony. Or hypocrisy.
There‚Äôs no kissing up to Trump. Don‚Äôt need to when we elected him for the very reasons you hate him so much. To take back our country from all the dumbshits that were destroying our country &amp; delivering it into the hands of our enemies.üòâ  Why are libtards ü§• up Biden‚Äôs...ü§≠ü§´üòÇ
Actually most people have changed over the years. And Biden‚Äôs as Catholic as I am a Muslim.
He‚Äôs a damn liar &amp; he knows he‚Äôs lying! Trying to put all those needless deaths on  that #KillerCuomo did! Biden called Trump xenophobic for shutting down travel from China, saying it was too soon! Another coup against Trump just before the election! #LyingDems ü§¨
Obama is a dirtbag and was a worthless President and Biden would be even worse if given the chance Sorry but he won‚Äôt have the chance
I think I'm officially team Biden/Bass, since there's almost zero chance Biden picks a 71 year old white woman for this cultural moment.
Biden has been a serial liar his whole political career.
Why do you think the democrats are pushing so hard for mail in ballots? They know they can use that to add more votes for Biden and lose votes for Trump.
It will never happen. There are too many states that are dominated by one party. Even if the same 3rd party candidate won every swing state, they would have to bank on trump and biden splitting evenly, which wouldn‚Äôt happen. There are too many democratic safe states.
If Biden wins and Democrats control both Houses one of the very first moves they will make is a national ‚Äúassault weapons‚Äù ban, and magazine limitations. The legislation is already drafted and ready to go.
A+++ He, Biden and PMJT all have a good relationship.
Joe Biden must be elected in November.
Why is the DOJ bending over backwards to protect Biden and the rest of the Dem spies who violated the Presidents and others Constitutional rights
Biden quoting the Koran now?  In a nation founded on Judeo-Christian beliefs.  Islam/Sharia Law is antithetical to Human Rights.  Sharia Law is "Repugnant to the U.S. Constitution". See: Marbury v. Madison,USSCt. (1803).

Of JOE BIDEN? lol
Mission accomplished. Once again Biden isn‚Äôt saying anything
Shut up. BIDEN is a pedo and fuck trump
Is this your endorsement of #Biden
They take the opportunity to vent on you because it's behind a screen and a keyboard. To your face, they wouldn't dare. Biden has a chance because the democrats will vote, as often as possible. Wait and see. My money's on Trump for a second term. You are not alone Scott.
Why do I keep hearing socialism joe Biden has not once mentioned socialism or defund police in fact he wants to spend more?
Who‚Äôs asking you to go to war? Trump is trying to pull us out of Afghanistan and Germany. The Democrats are fighting to keep us in. I‚Äôll take your side, if you want to go to war, vote Biden. He will absolutely keep us in Afghanistan.
I sense the return of ‚Äúlock her up‚Äù for whoever Biden chooses for his running mate, cause they sure can‚Äôt hang anything on Biden.
I honestly think Biden has gotten the majority convinced enough to pick him over Trump

Let‚Äôs blame Trump so that Joe Biden can win and lead the country just like this.
Yes when Biden says he going to be the most progressive president in history I think he trying to get right leaning independents.
Do you think Joe Biden fights back the urge to puke each time he calls POS Trump "Mr President"?????
So Biden has never said and Chris Wallace held him to his bullshit!! So if Biden is defunding police then TRUMP IS EXECUTING HIS TAKEOVER OF THE COUNTRY AS A DICTATOR. Ps. Hope he is feeling good about killing Herman Cain!! #TrumpIsNotWell #Trump
As a senior citizen I am begging EVERY SENIOR...EVERY ADULT NO MATTER WHAT COLOR...GET OUT AND VOTE THIS ATROCITY OF A PRESIDENT OUT!!!!  PLS VOTE BIDEN....PLS FOR MY SAFETY AND YOURS IN OUR AMERICA!!!
In other words, they got nothing for Biden so they‚Äôre gonna wait until he announces his running mate and run against her.
So Kelly what is Biden going to take away?? Please let me know
In April, Joe Biden predicted Trump would try and delay election
Goes after BLM, really? Trump has done more for black unemployment that any President, not even Trump supporter. Look up record on Joe Biden with blacks, about busing and wouldn‚Äôt want my family living in the ‚Äújungle‚Äù. I‚Äôm awake, I see my country going down with socialist turds.

Welcome to America if Biden wins. On top of it they Marxist shirts on.
I'm voting for Green Howie Hawkins for president.  I'm sick and tired of people complaining about Biden and the DNC, but won't back a third party candidate.
Their slow they don‚Äôt understand, that‚Äôs why Biden makes so much sense to them
A lot of us our terrified voting will be rigged and Biden will be president, I mean Democrat‚Äôs clearly are trying everything they can to get rid of him why wouldn‚Äôt the voting be rigged? Their afraid of being exposed
Vote for biden its as close ae were gonna get.
If Howie Hawkins wins, you can blame the left for Biden's loss.
You paid $40 for a Biden sign??7
trump should def be in a cage, but there were no russian bounties and change the law. biden isnt the answer ppl
Biden/Jeffrey Epstein's Ghost 2020
I‚Äôm watching Trump on YouTube.  The combox is going crazy and they are all Trump supporters. Can we light our hair on fire today and tell everyone that Biden is going to lose to make sure everyone #getsoutthevote ?
Oh yes i saw all those convictions. Biden has no creepy behavior. Nothing, so we have him. We only see problems for people we don‚Äôt like. People who got our psychosis get a full pass and no one should ever believe them. Also, only people who kill kids love kids.
Trump, because biden,obama,hillary,nancy,adam,chuck cnn,msnbc,nbc,cbs,abc,nytimes,democrats,liberals, blm,mlb,nba,nfl,nhl,wnba,who,canada,mexico....i only have so many characters...
Biden will win.
You know you do NOT want to have your Social Security and Medicare benefits CUT!   trump and the nasty radical right republicans want to CUT both.   Vote Biden to #MAGA üá∫üá≤ #MAGA2020
In a sane world Biden would be the obvious answer. Somehow I can't see the media covering it that way... üòí
I actually hate Alyssa Milano lol, she abandoned the #MeToo movement the second Biden was accused.  I also agree she likely has far less viewers. I get that it was lighthearted, but I was just pointing out that her YT isn't active. She uploads to apple music, Spotify, etc.
guarantee if Biden wins the Covid will suddenly be a thing of the past
someone tried to use this tweet against me in an argument and i just want y‚Äôall to know i actually really do mean this and if you tell me to vote for biden i really will shit on you and that‚Äôs coming from the bottom of my heart. sorry y‚Äôall are such smooth brains hope u heal
Also for the record it's importanat to say: vote for a candidate you believe in, biden isn't the only option, think about voting for the green party nom Howie Hawkins and then if trump still wins in November remember... direct action is more than just voting
LMAOFF ARE YOU CRAZY??? HE‚ÄôGONNA CRUSH BIDEN &amp; IF YOU‚ÄôRE HIS VP PICK, HE‚ÄôS GONNA CRUSH YOU TOO. GUARANTEED #TRUMP2020

I will never vote for Biden.
But I love you  ...more than Biden loves his basement or vulnerable women.
My recollection is that criticism of the Pandemic Primaries was more frequently directed at the DNC than at Biden.

theyre all trying to vote for biden
Biden leading this country would be akin to the old man in the texas chainsaw massacre leading dinner
I still laugh at this article. Perhaps Gillibrand or Andrew Yang would've been a better candidate.
Trump doesn't need a nurse to carry him because he might wander off like an unleashed dog. If it was more obvious they'd probably put a leash on Biden.
He would've told me (a white guy) to "Ask China" as well. Biden's supporting the Tough On Crime Bill and we can't forget his if you don't vote for him "You ain't black". Obama also referred the Ferguson rioters as "thugs" too.
Seems to me what's really happening is a desperate man trying to make excuses and hold onto power any way he can. The only reason to delay the election is that he knows hes currently getting owned by Joe Biden. And ppl dont even like Biden they just want Trump gone that bad
The bounties were started because of the conflict in the Middle East by Bush, Cheney, Clinton, Pelosi, McCain, Obama and Biden among many other Neo-Libs and Neo-Cons.
Facts tf he think he is? He so worried about loosing to Biden
It will be nice having him in the background when Biden is the President
Biden not retiring due to his dementia is 100% worse. Dementia gets worse until you're dead. Go ask a nursing home worker how bad it is. I volunteered at one. 99% of the time they're unaware of their surroundings.
We are all terrified that invalid vegetable could possibly get in due to voter fraud caused by mail in votes. Biden couldn‚Äôt run a lemonade stand, and the whole country would turn into leftist run cesspools like San Francisco, Seattle and Portland.
A tough mama bear! I believe that Joe Biden will bring us together do a great job he did as VP and clean up the disaster trump has done from taking away Regulations to our virus and our economy he has experience he‚Äôll have strong women behind him helping all the way! Vote 11/3/20
Biden has dementia. He won't even last a full term.
If you think a man with dementia is electable you're insane. Biden can't even remember where he is or what year it is 99%. He won't last a full term. The Atlantic made an article about Biden's declining health titled "Stay Alive, Joe Biden"
Really?  I think that's wishful thinking.  Biden's condition is worsening.  At this point he is being lead around by the arm because he'd get lost on his way to the bathroom.  Can't win without a candidate.
Why on Earth hasn't Biden announced a VP Pick already? This is ridiculous and it is killing his momentum. We are in full on crisis and need to be going full speed ahead.
The Middle Eastern conflict was started by Bush, Cheney, Clinton, Pelosi, McCain, Biden and Obama? Were it not for them we'd not have that problem. But they wanted to play World Police.
So, Joe Biden is against the lockdowns.
Assuming you're rooting for Biden now?
If I remember The Atlantic made in an article named "Please Don't Die" talking about Joe Biden's dementia. Mueller also found no evidence of collusion.
Biden can't even remember where he is 99% percent of the time. Sounds like a "competent" man to me. If you think a dementia patient is competent.
GREAT article from April by Jonathan Turley, excoriating Biden for his absurd suggestion that Trump might try to delay the election. Turley calls out this baseless and ‚Äúcrazed‚Äù conspiracy theory, and *puts finger to ear* stand by: I have breaking news.
Biden warned that Trump would try to delay or postpone (not "stop") the election, which is exactly what Trump floated today.  The fact that you are trying to Both Sides this is ridiculous.
Biden/ would be even worse!
I'm Ridin' with Biden &amp; ready to vote. I am 73. This will be the most important election in my lifetime. Time to take America back from the fascists &amp; nazis.
I am only on Biden‚Äôs side till Liz Cheney takes over GOP trump has done nothing but ruin the country!
And speak and speak and speak.   (Except for Biden, they don't let him speak)
I really dont think the actual powers that be are so upset about biden that they'd allow the election to be delayed.
Just spitballing no bad ideas: Trump loses electoral college but wins popular vote, right before Biden inauguration he retroactively abolishes electoral college. That‚Äôs just one option
Biden has dementia and I‚Äôm blocking anyone who supports a pedofile
You know what You need to stop telling yourself so many lies You clearly have some form of dementia and so does Biden neither one of you should be in office we need someone who's mentally compatible
If Biden was President you and your family would be dead possibly - he called BANNING TRAVEL FROM CHINA ‚Äòxenophobic‚Äô (racist) - amazing you would blame HIM and not CHINA! Sickening
Democrats: vote for Joe Biden, whos been in politics and Washington for 40 years and this is where we are....
"invents a new crisis with the intention of sending everyone into a panic. It works. Every single time. Predictably, people go into a panic spin.  Trump pushes your buttons and you respond."  Don't do it.  Trump is a fool. #Vote #VoteByMail #VoteBlue2020 #Biden
Why can‚Äôt people j have proper ID for voting and go in to the polls for voting with masks? Since we can protest in large numbers why can‚Äôt we vote in person. If u don‚Äôt vote in person there has been cases of false votes all across the U.S. is this the only way Biden can win?
Stop trying to get me excited to vote for Biden it won‚Äôt work
so i don't think biden will pick EW as VP, which is who i would prefer as VP, i hope he picks Susan Rice. and if he doesn't pick Susan Rice, i hope he makes her secretary of state. can't think of anyone better to un-fuck what has happened to the state dept.
Biden 2020 clearly has ESP...or they just know that tRump will lie and cheat to try to get re-elected...or both
At least Biden speaks coherent and talks long range plans! Unlike living in 1950 scary to all white housewives! !! He‚Äôs delusional
Biden gets in, we will none of this
I know that it‚Äôs less than 100 days until the election but there is still enough time to impeach Barr!! Hopefully Biden‚Äôs AG will indict Barr for his corruption!  #ImpeachBarr
Your father accused Joe Biden of pledging to neutralize carbon emissions "by 2:30".   You really don't want to debate cognitive decline.
And Biden would do what? Make things worse because he can‚Äôt even handle a live speech? The man can‚Äôt finish his sentences and he wouldn‚Äôt be able to handle all the chaos that the leftists have caused.
Congrats, enjoy retirement.
Because half of our country is brainwashed by the radical leftist media. Joe Biden supported the founder of the KKK, plus he can‚Äôt even finish a sentence without pausing of saying, ‚Äúyou know that thing‚Äù. If he wins, our country will fall apart and the economy will crash.
President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, both promise sweeping progress over the next four years ‚Äì- via starkly different paths.
Dems don‚Äôt want to defund police in fact Biden has said he wants to increase funding to provided more training! There are a few that have said it but they don‚Äôt represent the party. Just cause trump says it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs true!
AOC,biden,Obama, maxine waters, shciff,cuomo, just to name a few.

What‚Äôs wrong with joe Biden, he seems lost when he speaks.
Don, Biden is complicit with Obama's treason and espionage. Obama usurped the Presidency,by fraud,during time of war. Now several of HIS VP picks are as ineligible constitutionally. Harris and Duckworth are NOT Natural Born Citizens.

Biden said the POLICE ARE THE ENEMY!
Sadly I think a lot of ppl are saying the same thing about the Democratic party although I strongly believe they'll still vote for Biden just to get rid of trump. Personally I think both parties pretty much suck at this point and are out of touch with today's world.
Biden gets in this will be all day everyday.
all the fake bullshit you think biden is going to do
welp enjoy biden tho
I said that too today, we would not be so concerned or anxious!! We never worried when Obama/ Biden were in the WH .. not so much with dope and dopier
And yet there are still plenty of media people, like Josh Barro, who continue to insist that it's not misogyny at all.  That Biden is just an extraordinarily talented candidate.
I would rather support a president that doesn't support communism.  That's why Biden is the right choice.
‚ÄúNEW:Joe Biden's allies have been waging a shadow campaign to stop ‚ÄòCory Booker‚Äô from becoming vice president.Some have argued to members of the search committee that Booker is too ambitious and that he‚Äôll only focus on becoming president if he becomes VP‚Äù  Ridiculous, isn‚Äôt it?
Hillary is relevant because we have a similar choice with Joe Biden. Are you voting for the President or puppet Joe?

And? I'm not gonna argue Biden would bring us through a superb recovery, but we wouldn't need a recovery to begin with if this stupid f**king guy wasn't elected. So your idea is to reelect the stupid f**king guy again?
4 more years of demographic change, but unknown what the national mood will be. I think the state will still lean republican in a neutral year, but Cruz is so bad that he will need it to be a good republican year due to backlash against the Biden/VP administration.
biden is a bush/cheney puppet, trump and jared are genie energy, thats why they hate eachother
The Biden campaign should immediately and proactively announce a detailed plan to surge poll watchers to urban precincts. If they are smart, they will have anticipated this move and already have one ready. Time is running short and early voting begins before you know it.
Joe Biden just upstaged Donald Trump  via
I have been awake dude, have you? This country is going down the drain with left Socialist turds destroying our country. I‚Äôm a veteran too. If JFK were alive today he would be a Republican. No more Democrats. Biden is a puppet for the socialist left, and mind you a racist! Facts!
biden would be doing the same thing for halliburton
I hope after Biden wins you will be a part of his cabinet!
Oh no moderates and never trumpers..suburban white women like myself...ppl that listen to me because they are not politically astute ..independents ...etc ...are voting ..BIDEN!
If it doesn‚Äôt work..why have you done it forever? I can‚Äôt wait in line just like you..I‚Äôm special..so i must mail my Biden vote in..
Believe me, I know full well how low the Democratic Party has gone the past five decades. People like Pelosi, Obama, the Clinton's, Feinstein, Biden and countless others have massively profited from this broken system. It's a one party system and we're not a part of the equation.
Maybe they can make joint announcement in support of Joe Biden and let the country know how fucked we are with trump and the rest of the gop.
Well maybe if MSM reported his quotes accurately he wouldn't need to do their job for them. Oh quick ?: when were you hired as his personal scheduler? You obviously have access to his calendar. And you only need to look to Biden to see picture of someone who can't learn anything
Most suburban voters are currently voting based on whether or not they like Donald J. Trump as a person and as a leader.  However, if Biden wins and does not reverse course on this, the way of life of 52% of the country will be massively disrupted by force of the federal
Joe Biden offers me nothing! The green party may never get elected, but i can sleep at night knowing I voted for someone who at least represents policy that I support.    #NeverTrumpNeverBiden
#Biden2020   "Biden will defund/get rid police." Nowhere, not speech nor print... nowhere has Biden said that. I dare anyone to find that he did.  Chris Wallace called him out for that lie.  Now if only they would call him out for the 19,000 other lies he's told
The absolute irony in Biden staffers going to this.
in November, vote Joe Biden to lower crime in the White House so we can work to #MAGA! #MAGA2020
It‚Äôs a free country for now. Therefore I can. It won‚Äôt be with puppet Joe Biden. The radical left have control of him already.
Vote for Biden  Dont count on the polls  Polls dont include the probability of Trump's political manipulations  Our lives depend on each &amp; every voter doing their job!
conservatives make Biden seem so cool somehow
Biden is looking for someone like himself, who didn‚Äôt want to be president, and so, only runs for president four or five times
Yes like Joe Biden
another clown just peddling some bluewave biden b.s.
How can anybody with an honest face say Joe Biden has the capability to run this country he can‚Äôt even put a sentence together
You mean ... like when VP ... Biden ... did that .
Biden please explain how breaking the law makes our country stronger Also how people we know nothing at all about should just come to our country
‚ÄúI live in the tepid space between not supporting Trump and not endorsing Biden, so I‚Äôm basically nowhere.‚Äù
I saw a Biden flag today, almost hit a tree I was so dumbfounded. How could any sane person vote for him
Biden is 77 or did they forget that. #Clueless
He going to get relected and not because he the best. Biden looks senile. If trump cant be what is the worst democract canidate since Warren McGovern doesnt deserve to win.
isn't the point of biden's pick that he's picking his successor
I hate to be one of the poll choosy people, but I scroll right through Change. They have been particularly more awful than everyone else. They had Biden +4 in SC 2 days before Biden won it by 29 for example.
Believe me, I know full well how low the Democratic Party has gone the past five decades. People like Pelosi, Obama, the Clinton's, Feinstein, Biden and countless others have massively profited from this broken system. It's a one party system and we're not a part of the equation.
It turns out, to no one‚Äôs surprise, that the Trojans in Joe Biden‚Äôs Trojan Horse are actually establishment Republicans.
Biden and his caregiver and all the people at that campaign office. Also none of the press had masks. Maybe they are all part of the hydroxychloroquine prophylactic program.
The Biden campaign should immediately announce a detailed plan to surge assets and poll watchers to urban precincts. If they were smart, they would have anticipated this and already have one ready. They can even give it a spiffy military style name. ‚ÄúOperation (something)‚Äù.
The choice is fascism or not fascism. ANY vote other than for Joe Biden is a vote for fascism (including NOT voting and voting third party). His stance here is analogous to giving a gunshot victim a drink of water. It‚Äôs a lovely thought but does nothing to fix the pressing issue.
Biden needs to be investigated re China China owns Biden His son Hunter got $1.5 billion loan from China for a startup and no biz experience Why?
Good, but I don't hate you or anyone. There is no doubt in my mind that Kamala would come out on top in a debate with Mike P. If you're honest w/yourself I'm sure you'd agree. To be fair we don't even know for sure she will be Biden's VP so it's a moot point.

It is a popularity contest. The President has to counter all the distortion of corrupt media. The media pounds away that the President did a bad job. He banned travel from China in January and was called a xenophobe by Joe Biden for doing so. He can never win with MSM.
Obama was a phony President making Biden his phony VP. Now Biden has been said to have chosen Harris as HIS VP. Harris is also ineligible to be President or VP. Can you understand why we have the article II requirement that our highest office and it's VP be natural born Citizens?
Biden with another proposal to help minority communities,of course another drain on tax payer dollars.  I think a better proposal to help minority communities would be to encourage education,to curtail the number of single parent homes &amp; to drop mimicking gang culture.

President Biden‚Äôs First Day
The majority of America doesn't like Trump, they hate him, and they think Biden is more competent on every issue as well as more mentally sound. That's plain polling. So no matter what he makes this election about, he loses.
He could definitely be a deputy AG or something but although I'd love to see him in court prosecuting these morons one Biden takes office, I guess that'd be a demotion for him.

Yeah, I heard that in 2016 also, and Clinton won NY and lost the election. I don't need lectures, I need universal healthcare and a homes guarantee. Biden and the DNC have done NOTHING to activate voters that Clinton lost, and that's on THEM - not us.
No, it's called politics. I owe Joe Biden nothing, and he owes me and every single person in this country everything. Votes are earned, not given. Seriously, did we time travel back to 2016?
the libs not letting our kids go back to school to die from a virus that is 100% avoidable by not doing exactly that is all a ploy to get trump out of office and get sleepy joe biden in so he can let all the mexicans in the country and legalize weed and revive osama bin laden

You're saying Biden would continue what Trump has done?  That's one of the dumbest things I've ever read.
I‚Äôm the radical. You‚Äôre voting for the party that can‚Äôt get police to protect them because they are so nuts. But yeah Biden isn‚Äôt against the police.
Biden is a fucking idiot
This is a bad example. If Twitter decided primaries, Fauxcahontas or Sanders would be the nominee.   The democratic party demonstrated where true power lies this year by clearing the field to coronate Biden in under a week's time when Sanders looked like the presumptive nominee.
Honestly, not a big fan of Biden, but I‚Äôm still voting for him to get 45 out.
Biden still hasn‚Äôt condemned the use of secret police and has only bolstered his stance that he will not even consider defunding the police.

POLITICO: Joe Biden Picks Kamala Harris as Running Mate... Four Days From Now
Joe Biden and the DNC have made it perfectly clear they are not the least bit interested in earning support from the broader political left. We're telling you this right now, so either make an effort to do something about it, or accept the outcome without complaint.
as opposed to that picture of health,biden lol
WTF Barr says if it‚Äôs legit he will leave. Trump and all his cronies must leave. This is why everyone must vote his ass out so there is no question that Biden is the winner. Our country cannot take 4 more years of this inept president
I'm not convinced by that argument given e.g. Sanders and Warren combined only having about 40% of the DNC primary electorate; 40% is a BIG number and earns you significant say over the platform (which we're seeing; Biden supports the GND and MASSIVE campaign finance reform)
If that makes you feel better. Biden said he‚Äôs going to be the most progressive president in history. He didn‚Äôt want to kill Bin Laden and you think he‚Äôs a moderate. You‚Äôre afraid of the 47%. Not the guy telling you he‚Äôs a left wing but.
Check out her son John Rice-Cameron. He's a republican hard-core trumper. Don't think he should be any where near Biden's administration.
I absolutely want people to hold Biden and, G-d willing, the Democratic Senate and House accountable and make sure they actually do the things they are promising they'll do, b/c we're fucked if they don't, that's a bare minimum tbh.
I agree with you!  Strongly!  I would very much like for the predominant and overwhelming medium of that discursive and rhetorical point to be literally anything other than "voting for Biden is just as bad as voting for Trump".
I don't want a repeat of the Bush -&gt; Obama transition, where the left lost all the liberals who had started to join in because "things are good now".  Setting the stage that the fights for M4A and legalization don't end with a Biden presidency is important work, IMO.
I feel like you are not the target audience for the people broadcasting this information though.  Some (myself included) are raising it now for the expected outcome of mass return to political apathy that a Biden win will surely usher in.
Former Obama advisor Susan Rice emerges as a serious contender for Joe Biden's VP pick

Ok so when tRump is president the fault lies with the cities but when Biden is President the fault lies with him? Which is it? Make up your mind. Can't be both
Trump just laid waist to a man who killed many of my fellow service members. And you think hes weak. Ask Soleimani if Trumps weak. Biden didn‚Äôt even want to kill Bin Laden and you think he will stand up. You‚Äôre not doing this right.
The Biden quote though...
I see people everyday go ‚Äúcan‚Äôt wait to watch Biden walk Trump out in handcuffs‚Äù and like last I checked George Bush is a free-man and even more so you all love him now
It‚Äôs going to be so rad when Biden appoints a new AG and they publicly announced they will not go after the Trump administration for ANYTHING, it is the way of the democrat.
Openly supporting either is honestly whack. Lol I‚Äôm not gonna ignore the terrible person trump is because Biden might be more terrible
You are a neocon. I know Biden will let you kill more brown people in the desert. So you should fit in well. Good at using the military for everything but defending the actual US.

Biden is out of it. No clue.  Makes no sense. How could anyone vote for him?
Yeah that‚Äôs why they are trying to get Biden elected. I bet you believe Russian intel, a lot.
Remember, if you don't vote Biden you're not black. And if you do vote Biden your a pedophile.
Don‚Äôt think China isn‚Äôt behind these protests. The useful democrat idiots in the streets. So they can get trump out and deal with a senile Biden. They can‚Äôt wait to get their world order back.
Both these guys are awful. Not sure why we all just pick a party regardless of the animal they select to represent them. I can tell you I will not blindly vote Biden just cuz he is the democratic candidate.
He‚Äôs put troops in Poland which is the ultimate slap in Putin‚Äôs face. Obama pulled out of a middle defense with Poland. But yeah Biden will stand up to Putin.
But then how can you mock Biden for his behavior? Just seems hypocritical to me. ‚ÄúYour party‚Äù is endorsing an admitted sexual deviant with ties to a man who ran a pedo ring. Why is politics so team oriented?

Who the hell is Biden speaking in front of right now? For all we know this is a backdrop in his basement filmed by his handlers.
I think you should do some more research. A lot of what was in the Russia collusion story was Russian intel using the democrat party as stooges to create chaos. You‚Äôre being used. Russian intel is laughing that so many of you bought this. They will keep working with Biden.

Biden and pelosi support that. All I hear from you guys is that because DHS is protecting the courthouse they are bad.  That‚Äôs your side. If you want to tar James with this drivel. You can deal with that.
The  'i love Bernie Sanders, but voted for Gary Johnson, and would rather vote for Trump than Biden' contingent. Politically confused
It is!!! It's like Nov. feels so far away!!!!! And we know Barr will come out with some bogus investigation on Biden before the election!!
That‚Äôs better. You just have a major case of TDS. And if Biden was with it. He would have done the Chris Wallace interview. He won‚Äôt because they know he would fall apart.
He actually said he would redirect funds. Biden has called to redirect police funding, but stopped short of ‚Äòdefund‚Äô embrace    Explore the Fox News apps that are right for you at
Pelosi and Biden can‚Äôt condem the riots or mobs ripping down statues. They‚Äôve turned on the police protecting these cities. The far left made the party impeach the president and Biden just gave Bernie about 3/4 of the dem platform he wants. But yeah the far left isn‚Äôt in control
that doesnt really mean biden is a viable option tho. Hillary will have biden sell out to big pharma
We'll see just how OK Republicans are with overreach when Joe Biden is president.  GD hypocrites, the whole lot of them.
All Trump has to do to win ...is to tell people to vote for Biden. They will do the opposite.
Leslie‚Äôs infatuation with Joe Biden is pretty misplaced in hindsight....
Please warn ppl not to be complacent. We know he‚Äôs gonna have October surprise. A vaccine he gets on camera (not necessarily for Covid, maybe his tetanus will be due), some nonsense about Hunter Biden. I‚Äôll worry till Biden flashes up on the screen as next president.
Okay I know no one wants Trump or Biden and Third Parties never win so can just agree to #SettleForBiden2020 and actually GO VOTE. 4 more years under Trump is legitimately a direct threat towards our health and safety.

I read it. The two can‚Äôt coexist as far as I‚Äôm concerned. Ensuring Trump loses Michigan means ensuring that Michiganders vote for Biden. Third party candidates split the vote and ensure a Trump victory.

I've been right probably more than anyone else... uh, no.   #Corona #Biden #COVID #Trump2020 #TrumpIsUnwell #GOP
why does he look like a mix of Trump and Biden in this? this is an unsettling picture
Biden wants someone like him (a man) with whom he can have a "close relationship" (i.e. dude friendship ), but who is also a woman. And he's coming up short! Let's analyze why.
Elizabeth Warren is exactly the person I want giving Biden policy advise! Except, we shoulda just made her the nominee...
"Both sides" is cynical and uncritical cliche. One side is about emancipatory ideas, the other side is an ethno-nationalist personality cult. I've never seen a Biden sign but have seen a million BLM signs and immigrants welcome signs.
I would much rather her be honest and straightforward like that rather than lie and just play the game. I like her and the people now see she isn't a puppet.
I was thinking of other recent elections when Minnesota was a battleground state too. Hillary won by less than 2% there. Biden has a sizable lead per recent polls, but I would be surprised if Trump doesn‚Äôt visit there.
Let's say it's October; everyone's kids are at home, there's no football on Saturday or Sunday, and it feels like we haven't made any progress since this started. Biden could sleep through whatever weird Zoom debates they end up doing and still win like 46 states.

In 100 days, amid deep partisan divides and surging #COVID19 cases, Trump and Biden will face off in the presidential election. DNC Chair  says the election actually starts much sooner, and that the Biden camp is focused on getting the word out about early voting.
Isn‚Äôt it Donald Trump who, in his insecurity, cannot be challenged without retaliation? Isn‚Äôt it Trump who particularly cannot be questioned by women? Biden must nip this in the bud.

For me its just every time I see a local person touting Trump or Biden in their campaign I am like....
He should have claimed he was protesting the heteronormative white patriarchy and police oppression on behalf of Joe Biden and the Democratic Party. Then he'd be exempted from the laws while the rest of us are under house arrest.
The Hill didn‚Äôt mention the Rasmussen poll were Biden leads Pres Trump by 2 point nationally Trump will win in November
Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Only problem..... Bidens handlers will say no.
2-for favor staying at his hotels and resorts. He never divested from his companies as he should have. Obama saved the auto industry and kept it here-you can‚Äôt say the same about Trump. Biden demanded the resignation of a well-documented CORRUPT prosecutor who‚Äôs now in jail.
Will all the owners of businesses that got shut down or destroyed by the rioters in these cities being run by Democrats who have allowed the looting and violence while ordering the police to stand down vote for Joe Biden If you do you don‚Äôt deserve to be in Business Wake up

Given the current alternative I would so choose Biden over a wannabe dictator.  As for the Republicans what active policies have they set forth to benefit the African/Black American constituency since Eisenhower?
So? Are you under the impression that Biden hasn‚Äôt already made his choice? Like 3 months ago?

This year doesn't operate under normal rules. The election delay debacle will devastate Trump's numbers this week. Friday's upcoming EMPSIT will be bracing, it will give no positive headlines. No conventions to provide temporary momentum. Biden's VP dominates the news for a week.
So, John Kerry's retrospective pinning of his loss for running a shit campaign on the now-disgraced John Edwards is supposed to be our criterion for whether or not Warren or Harris is a suitable pick for Biden in 2020?  okaaaaaay.....

Justin.  I told you Susan Rice would be a great pick about a month ago.  You did not agree then.  Well, now her stock is rising rapidly and you are on the bandwagon.  Welcome aboard.
This is awful for the NYT to report and for Biden to permit by members from members of his team.
Exactly what I've been saying, day in and out! There's no reason this should be happening, if not for the fact that she's 1)a woman 2)a Black Woman! It's a scary thought for them to consider something happening to Biden and a Black Woman becoming POTUS! I know that's what it is!

I truly believe that Joe Biden will select Kamala Harris to be his vice president. Not gonna get my Depends in a bunch while I wait.
You caught up on fake news. You don't know nothing about Biden yet you want him in office. Research Kamala Harris, slept her way to the top. Planned parenthood selling baby boy parts. That's gonna be his choice for vp.
If Biden is announcing his VP pick next week, don‚Äôt you think he has made his choice already and that person has already accepted? I don‚Äôt recall the GOP speaking out against trump‚Äôs choice of Pence. Just cuz Dems have a big tent, doesn‚Äôt warrant the airing of everyone‚Äôs opinion.
Biden for. President
Biden talks about those subjects too. Open your eyes and ears.
The Obama/ Biden wing of the Democrats are barely left of Fine Gael but I‚Äôd still have them over any Republican. Obama has always been a bit preachy.
I like Harris but I wonder if Biden has a connection with Bass who lost her daughter and son-in-law in a car accident in 2006.
It‚Äôs in the tweet. But again if he wins narrowly by mail in, nothing to talk about... &amp; Biden is a Marxist now? Wildin big guy lmaooo
I'm old enough to have fully followed 3 election cycles. I watch every debate. GOP and  DNC. Biden was shoved down our throats since day 1. Hes horrible. Trump is horrible. They both represent the establishment. We have 4 choices in Nov. We need to not be afraid to split votes
So ‚Äúsmart‚Äù that the ‚Äúfake‚Äù virus is killing you. Republicans lol.
It will probably take Biden at least 2 wks b4 he can move in because they will have to fumigate the place first.
This has really gotten very ugly. Didn't have to. The coordinated hit job on Kamala Harris should shame the Democratic Party. It's Biden's pick all the way, but the process has been terrible.
Biden is there.....

They needed a reason to make trump look bad and this simultaneously helps them keep Biden out of the spot light because he makes a gaffe every time he talks. Trump just can‚Äôt expose it all at once, the sheeple like you wouldn‚Äôt be able to handle it all at once.
Joe Biden will say dumb things, and offensive things; that's who he is. But he won't mean most of them, and he will apologize for the worst of them.  POTUS says dumb and offensive things and means most of them, and won't even apologize for the ones he doesn't mean.
I mean, yes, you're right.  but you support Biden.  how y'all think he's any kind of legitimate upgrade and not more of the same of the last TWENTY years... is a complete mystery to me.  different colors, same shit

And correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't believe VP Biden ever told people to ingest bleach or depended on the word of a 'doctor' who claimed alien DNA administered through sex is the cause of it all.  Oh, and witches and demons too.  And your boss fell for it.
What‚Äôs interesting is, he has all these ideas about why the youth may not vote, and doesn‚Äôt acknowledge his own role in voter suppression and ensuring Biden was the candiate. For better or worse.
I can see him going further in the final days/weeks and telling his supporters to not vote. The system and the result is delegitimized if both sides do not participate. Biden would be President, but the social contract would be in ruins.
People get butt hurt on the internet too fast and that‚Äôs coming from someone who doesn‚Äôt give a damn about either side but I won‚Äôt vote for Biden this election since I don‚Äôt vote for socialist communist so thump it is

If Biden wants a female VP, he should pick one from a state that Trump won in 2016.  Biden's VP will be pro-abortion, no matter whom he picks.   If he picks Harris, it remains to be seen if the left keeps quiet because of her record prosecuting drug offenders.

Of course, the Eagleton bombshell was largely a result of the Democratic establishment basically sticking it to McGovern, so he had to resort to his 11th choice or something, so that's not so likely now. I doubt that anyone on the "A"list would turn Biden down if he really wanted
This can be read two ways. Either they believe the Presidency is not going to go their way and are desperately gonna try to flip senate instead or they believe presidency is in the bag for Biden and they will now try and flip senate as well.
The Trump campaign, meanwhile, quickly praised the endorsement as more proof that he‚Äôs the ‚Äúlaw and order‚Äù commander-in-chief while simultaneously attacking Biden as powerless to shore up Democrats.
Larry, why do you/they believe this is a positive sign for Trump? It can also be read as these lowlife scum believing Presidential election is in the bag for Biden so they're gonna spread the money around, no?
There was a reason Trump was so afraid to run against Biden that he turned to Ukraine and China for help.
Biden is highly risk averse-this is his safest option. It's only to be able to pose that they are taking the black &amp; progressive vote seriously, not to substantively take it seriously-the alternative being Trump they pretty much take the progressive vote for granted.
I get the feeling that this is synthetic drama to make the announcement of Harris be a "surprise" and to portray it as Biden mending fences with "the left"
OTOH reading this article, I get the impression it's a stalking-horse kind of leak. It builds the "drama" that the establishment is pushing against Harris, so that when Biden chooses her, it's an olive branch to"the left"etc. Trying to neutralize the actual left's critique of her

I'm with you on both aspects of this. She would actually be better situated to primary Biden as a sitting Senator in her second term, some accomplishments, etc. Less dangerous as VP
This look ridiculous.  was  taken away from the reporters. His handlers are afraid that biden would say something stupid from his dementia mind. Who would vote for someone like this. Biden is not ok. He is being taken back to his brainwashing basement where he belongs.

I'm voting Biden no matter what.
Honestly, Kamala being nominated is a good thing. All of the garbage unearthed during her campaign can be carbon copied and reposted. It'll be Biden's albatross to explain away  all the baggage she brings with her.
This is a good example of why, for the most part, VP Biden remains hunkered down in his basement.
It‚Äôs honestly remarkable watching liberals create their own birther movement for a prominent left winger on twitter because the person they don‚Äôt like isn‚Äôt supporting Biden
Who are you to label everyone who disagrees with you a white man? Are you arguing that no women or men of color have any problems with Biden? The guy who wrote the crime bill?
Nobel prize just for getting elected.   Popular vote means nothing.   Impeachment was a joke.  As to sex assault, see toothless joe Biden on that.  I hate Trump though.
Not relevant compared to the alternative.  Biden is dementia-ridden.
Whose twitter game is worse than this? Ever time I read a Biden tweet, I fear Trump will be re-elected
You won‚Äôt even acknowledge how Biden‚Äôs son had the privilege of not being put in jail for committing a crime that would have sent black men to jail for the exact same thing, based on his father‚Äôs own laws that he wrote.
So when it‚Äôs Hunter Biden smoking crack it‚Äôs a pretend crime? What about the countless black people who have been thrown in jail for the same thing? Is it a pretend crime for them? Biden wrote laws to make drug crimes get more serious charges. Not so sure Joe thinks it‚Äôs pretend
Are you claiming that Hunter Biden didn‚Äôt get caught smoking crack?
At an insane rate. To Biden, the laws he wrote don‚Äôt apply to his own son. Hunter would be in prison but he‚Äôs a Biden. Think of how many black people were locked up Biden‚Äôs policies for smoking crack like HunterI'm no Biden fan, but there's no way he'd reject progressive policies passed by Democratic majorities in both houses of Congress. If the US doesn't pass universal healthcare, we have (almost) only Congress to blame.
Great article. You brought up what few have - that Biden‚Äôs family‚Äôs opinion on candidates might weigh heavily. He definitely has a close circle of advisors which includes family.

Vote Biden becauseüëá
If Biden shows up anywhere he would have to hire the rioters to get a fairly decent audience same with you, but let TRUMP speak anywhere within minutes thousands will show up, does that sound like your going to win easily anytime u want to match crowds just try to match TRUMPS .
Biden is weak, can't think for himself and will go wherever his party pushes him. If the democrats are increasingly radical, Biden will be increasingly radical. This is why he now supports defunding the police after a long career of being tough on crime.
The Biden team will take anyone President Trump has cast out.
People get so offended when all one asks of a candidate is for them to do better. The same people who won‚Äôt entertain the idea that Biden might not be a strong candidate.

There might even be some truth to it. Americans are so beaten down and disillusioned, a politician offering them ANYTHING looks like pie-in-the-sky idealism. They voted for Joe Biden because he offered them nothing at all beyond making the news less stressful.
Joe Biden didn‚Äôt win the primary by aligning his platform with what the people want. He won by convincing people he was ‚Äúpragmatic‚Äù and therefore the most ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù choice for beating Trump. Despite legalization‚Äôs popularity, I think many voters still view it as radical.
I don't like the idea. It's too presumptive. I want Joe Biden to be president and do president things once elected and inaugurated.
Watching this makes me miss team Obama-Biden!
Joe Biden could still lose this election (opinion) - CNN  Of course because the ‚Å¶ will lie and commit voter fraud and invite Putin in to help, just like 2016.

I'm sorry. I was mean. I just saw your tweet as the criticism being directed at Joe Biden. Next, I thought how did that get there. Upon careful reading, considering the source then a little more research I concluded what (I think) was your message DT the problem, Joe, the answer.
You think that if Biden were in charge then Covid would magically disappear because Biden now has a magic wand, with a flick he can change the amount of deaths? Earlier this year Biden was saying that the virus was not real, made up by Trump to incite division You people are sick

This is why I fear the Democratic Party will be overrun by "decent" conservatives. I do want them to vote for Biden and I like the Lincoln project, but if Trump mentality continues to drop the Republicans where else will these people go? And with our "big tent" progress is lost.
Read last week that he was spending a chunk of $ in Florida to get seniors to vote for Biden and then a bigger chunk of $ to get Democrats elected to the Senate. I too expected to be hearing a lot more from him.

Biden can't run the country.  President Trump is extremely active! Biden sits in a basement.  You can't see the difference?

That's President Trump to you, Miss Melanie. You just don't get it. Liberals lie, And say whatever you want them to so they can win. This interview with Biden shows just that. Lets stick to the topic.
Biden previously failed two times to become President.  And that was when he was cognitively intact. To think anyone who rejected him before would be confident in this man as president is ludicrous.I could be missing a lung from COVID and stuck in an iron lung, but I will still vote in person to ensure my one vote counts toward the landslide of other votes kicking this evil moron, his reprehensible allies, and garbage family out.

Oh really? According to Trump &amp; his pollsters the Republican Party is WAY more excited about him than Dems r with Biden. No worries, Trump has excited the Dems to get him out of office. ‚úåÔ∏è
If he‚Äôs doing such a great job y r the numbers ‚Äúdead even‚Äù? Biden has not really done much campaigning either. These numbers r a reflection of how poorly Trump has handled the virus. And he STILL doesn‚Äôt get it. The science will set up our economy. Epic fail by Trump.
The corporate media, the corporate DNC, and a lot of corporate money the Biden pledged to protect.
BIden wants the schools to open when they are safe to open. Unlike Trump the sociopath, he believes in science. Trump is reaponsible for the deaths of 150,000 Americans because of his depraved indifference to this pandemic and he is now trying to endanger children &amp; young people
Good for Fox. They also broadcast VP Biden‚Äôs speech the other afternoon. I saw it flipping through the channels and was shocked. Sure Trump was not happy, lol.
Sounds like Biden
Yeah probably, you don't deserve to, but it's still gonna happen when (not if) Biden selects Harris as his VP.

No, she is an unknown. This person has to be able to help Biden get thru this term and then run in 2024. Susan Rice or Kampala Harris fit the bill perfectly.
Why is Joe Biden shaped like this
Massive hypocrisy from this clown shoes who whines daily about Bernie voters not voting for Biden. I'm voting for Biden in NY and not happy about it, so grow up or you just want Trump to win
I understand all this but a swing of 6% is insane, especially because we didn't even see that in 2018 in a blue wave year where the casual Trump voter didn't show up because he wasn't on the ballot. As I said, I do think Biden has a legit shot, but +7 is just flat out laughable.
Marist was complete trash on the 2018 midterms and Nate Silver isn't the arbitrator of polling truth. I believe Biden can win NC, and he's certainly likely to win the election, but up 7 is a damn joke and these cross tabs are complete nonsense.
Marist once against showing all their ass and will be as wrong as they were in 2018. I cam buy Biden up a point or maybe 2, but this polling and sample is a joke
It will be great on January 21,  2021when we have a Press Secretary with Pres. Biden who has a brain and doe not lie with every word you speak.

This is literally what Trump got impeached over. Most people, especially those voting for Biden, are just going to see it as another abuse of power and push them to get out the vote even more.
Yes. You're correct. I already said he's piggybacking off the Obama lovefest. Biden name drops him constantly to get the black vote. It's not a mystery.
I'll deal in facts. Believe me, on Nov 4th I'll be the most vocal Biden hater out there. Unfortunately he's our only hope
Oh I can't vote in primaries. And don't fool yourself, the GOP and DNC pick who they want. They thought Hillary was more "electable" and feel Biden can just piggyback off the Obama lovefest. Just hope it doesn't cost us again.
I will. And thankfully in my state don't have to hold my nose &amp; vote for Biden.

Pelosi, Deblasio, Fauci etc etc were all telling folks to go out and live their lives in Feb and March. Biden called Trump xenophob for the travel ban. NY and Cuomo failed miserably to contain the spread and are responsible for several thousands of nursing home deaths.

President Bill Clinton, who took office more than 27 years ago, in 1993, is younger than both Donald Trump and Joe Biden.
The only direct benefit Biden might see in Harris is that she's already won - she had the first round of oppo dumped on her during the campaign, has the knowledge of what it takes (in a non-COVID environment) to campaign, etc.   However... I think there are more broad choices.
That's BS. Totally depends what state you live in because of the electoral college. In NY I have that luxury. In a swing state I'd hold my nose &amp; vote for sniffy Biden.
isnt it more likely that this is just a rhetorical strategy to cover the gop's ass in the event of a loss so they can claim that biden won due to fraud and impeach him over it?  both parties are just 24/7 grievance politics, meanwhile the rest of us just want healthcare
To be fair it's not like Joe Biden was ever vice president with clear ambitions of being president.
This is the only Biden group I could consider contributing to.
I wish she was a natural born citizen so I could wish for a world where Biden picks her for VP
Gotta do this right,  could  come across like he's picking on a Special Needs kid.... which Biden basically is.
I don‚Äôt think it will have the impact they think it will. It amounts to relitigating 2016 w Obama spied on me or Hunter Biden is bad. That doesn‚Äôt change Trump‚Äôs unmatched record of failure. This is not 2016 they keep trying to run the same playbook and it‚Äôs not working.
Id rather Trump were telling the truth on this one. Unfortunately Biden isn't as progressive as he seems to be afraid of
And honestly, given all the criminality, dementia and blatant racism of trump, what the heck could they put on Biden to equal that?

I had a nightmare that Alyssa abandoned the #metoo# movement once Biden got accused &amp; that it's really all political for her! Oh wait? That's reality!
Don't get Joe Biden excited about anarchists. He might write another crime bill.
False. What year did it change?  The democrats fought against civil rights well into the 1960's, so maybe it changed in 1965?  Or in 1995 after Joe Biden's racist Crime Act of 1994?
Joe Biden should pick you.
Biden vows to fight racial inequality with economic agenda
Joe Biden made his son a multi-millionaire using his power influence as Vice President. White  privilege at its finest.
#askjheil I would vote for a pineapple before, I would vote for him, but he can win why? Is Biden the best choice?
Just proves Kamala doesn‚Äôt give a SHIT about anything she railed Biden on during the primaries, it was all for show, she only cares about power and is willing to abandon any and all of her ‚Äúprinciples‚Äù to get it, same with most elected officials
Disparaging them like Biden saying anarchists should be arrested?  Or the DNC not listening to it's voters on cj reforms or legal pot, no M4A even after tens of thousands unnecessary deaths because of the system, no green new deal as the world burns.   Focus on your own platform
Though let's be real Biden would probably have little issues with this happening
Same. Also made me sad Biden dismissing protest by saying "we need to prosecute anarchists and arsonists". Just depressing
Brett Kavanaugh Al Franken Donald Trump Joe Biden Bill Clinton  Did we listen to the survivors equally? Or did we form our judgment based on whether we needed the abuser in gov't? Or how she dressed and spoke, what sort of job she had, whether she was well-spoken or attractive?
I dread this announcement.   It will almost inevitably be the wrong choice.   (because it is Biden, after all)
Biden absolutely sucks and will never stop protesting his dumb but until he's out of office. After Trump is gone the truce is over.
Biden is human shit... lol
Joe Biden reminds me of that corpse in "Weekend at Bernies"   #JoeBiden #Trump2020Landslide
All of this is totally made up.  bullies are liars. There is no Biden - can't walk, can't talk
The whole reason Biden is the nominee is that, even he can't lose to Trump with all the problems under the sun, would it actually mater in the election even in swing states if they were scared of scary socialized medicine?   No  They are scared of losing their donors, that's it
Does  understand that if Biden wins in November, he becomes Commander in Chief of the military in January regardless of whether Trump and the GOP accept it. Our very expensive military will blow through that wall in a minute to escort him from the premises.
Biden should have changed his. This is critical testimony. Or it could be if they asked good questions and elicited some important facts/admissions/lies!

What is Jim Jordan talking about? Obama/Biden is sitting there having to defend themselves or a disgraceful, disgusting, anti-American AG Barr? He should stick to the topic. Hope he stops talking soon. Oh my God playing some irrelevant video...no. I'm off making meatloaf.
Well, I'm a working journalist, but I consider myself a lifelong student, so...federal agents, police reform, schools, masks, Lewis, Biden VP
While I'm all in favor of the ERA, there's literally nothing that Biden can ethically do as President to help it pass that he can't do already.  Our constitution doesn't provide a role for the President in amending it. He can't ensure anything.
He honestly had half an empty hospital in upstate called St. Mary‚Äôs which is now almost empty, I get what you‚Äôre saying but no he‚Äôs not better than Trump. He just wants to throw his little hat in the big boy ring,I dislike both candidate‚Äôs the Cheeto and Biden is a muppet.

Every state supported Medicare for all whether they voted for Bernie or Biden.
Where? Point to where I said I excuse trump. I hate trump. I hate all that he stands for. But the fact of the matter is that Biden is not much different in terms of policy. All Biden would have to do to earn my vote is endorse m4a.
So we‚Äôre not allowed to point out why Biden could do to win us over? We‚Äôre just supposed to give up our morals because he‚Äôs not trump?

First ask him to resign for lying, for sending an illegal Goon Squad to terrorize Americans, and for flying around the world looking for dirt on Joe Biden, and a lot of other reasons...
It's definitely that, plus they think he's a rapist based don zero factual evidence. Those who dislike Trump feel the same way about him, but will openly deny Tara Reade's allegations against Biden. Those reeeesisters are hypocrite bunch for sure.
I think the other significant difference is that Biden is often getting above 50%.
I'm for  or  as Biden's VP.

Some people don't care who's in the white house, as long as it isn't Trump. Be careful what you wish for. Taxes will go up and unemployment will go up. Biden says he's going to create energy jobs, but if you read his plan, he has to do away with some jobs to make that happen.
turn away from him NOW. Joe Biden turns to friend and confidante Chris Dodd to help him choose running mate

As a boat owner I have witnessed these boat parades and these people look like that are part of a cult. The other 80% of the boats on the lake just looked at them like they are crazy. So...I‚Äôm thinking they were Biden voters.

Yes vote for racist Biden.
Biden's blatant racism destroyed himself.
The take away is that there is no real conviction from Biden supporters. They're 90% orange man bad, rest 10% actually think Biden is not completely incompetent. (pulled stats out of thin air based on my feelz; I'm pulling a Democrat move here).
Don't know how to tell you this bud, but Biden isn't president. The video you posted isn't from the Obama days either. Your video is further footage of Trump's America. Whatever happens during his term,  is responsible.
Here's the problem, you're ignoring everything I said about Biden that is 100% true and reply with a possibility but not fact about Trump to try to retract from how sick Biden is.
Yes, yes they can and they will. False morality abounds. Religion without faith=evangelicals.

Explain this: If Biden was a racist, then Obama, a black man, wouldn't have picked him after all he has been been vetted to become his VP  partner for all two terms. If Biden was a racist, 5 final female candidates of African descent would have turned him down, cold. 1/2
So logically that leaves us not supporting Biden or Trump and since I live in a dark blue state that's not a problem but for anyone who lives in a swing state ...
I have a joke about Bernie voters who donate to Biden but it's only 3% funny.

Biden Obama dropped unemployment from over 10% to under 5%.  Trump increased unemployment from under 5% to over 11%. Also, 145,000 Americans are dead from Trump's negligent response to COVED 19 and the Russians put bounties on our soldiers with no response from Trump.  Sad!
You are completely out of touch. The unemployment rate right now is higher than it ever was in the Obama Biden admin. Almost 50 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits. We have lost all credibility with foreign nations due to Trump's inept foreign policy. Pathetic.
seriously? You‚Äôre literally lining up the next President after you. And potentially someone who will have to run against Trump again. Excitement is still required. Dumb otherwise.

And if Biden becomes president, it won't be because he ignored Twitter. It'll be because his opponent was an incompetent and evil buffoon of historical proportions.  And because he does seem to be serious about building a coalition that includes members of the left.
So you can't post factual evidence Trump raped anyone?  Didn't think so.  Don't forget Joe Biden was accused of rape as well, is he guilty based on an ALLEGATION?  I told you ridiculous comments were easy refute.
The leadership shouldn't be your concern. There are hundreds of thousands (millions) of progressive voters, some of whom _do_ care what they think, even if they take it with a bucket of salt.  A hundred thousand voters in the wrong state could cost Biden the election.

Where's the factual evidence? There's no factual evidence Trump is pedo, that Baio raped anyone, and that Biden raped anyone. But your hypocrisy and logic has Baio and Trump guilty while you don't believe or disregard the allegations against Biden. Liberals aren't very smart.
Dreaming of a debate between Donald Trump, Marianne Williamson, and Joe Biden.
I believe factual evidence, not uncorroborated allegations like you do. You think Baio raped Nicole based on nothing, so you must think Biden raped Reade or you're a hypocrite based on your own logic.
By your logic Biden is a rapist as well. Does it suck supporting a racist rapist for president?
Baio didn't rape anyone. If you're one of those who believe all women or believe unproven alleagtions that means you're voting for Biden the rapist.  It doesn't take much to show how silly you are.
...and his opponent is a bigger war hawk and a far right nut.  Biden wasn't my choice either. However, it is clear that one of these men is less dangerous than the other. Just because I don't get all the policies I want now does not mean I am going to vote for their antithesis.
One of these two men will be President whether we like it or not. One will stop the current lawlessness and stop the march toward a far right government. No, we won't get M4A or debt relief immediately. Biden now will leave you in a better place to go after them in 2024.
Equating Biden with Trump/GOP is ridiculous. Is he as progressive as many would like him to be? Obviously not. However, his health plan is an incremental step toward M4A. As for other issues, he has consistently said he will go with Congressional Democrats.

I mean, took 40 years for mitch mcconell to get to the point of trump, with their approval rating in every category going under biden‚Äôs.  I don‚Äôt even like biden, and that‚Äôs embarassing.  It shows because of how bad he‚Äôs been as a leader and president.

I am the middle and didn‚Äôt vote trump or HRC last election. I don‚Äôt think trump is the devil but there must be someone better. Biden is a puppet and the left have done all it can to push me from considering their candidates at all.
Finally #biden breaks his silence and says something reasonable. More of this and #trump is sunk.
Now do Biden , what a joke you have become
Stevey are you insinuating that Trump has less cognitive ability than Biden? If you are insinuating that I firmly believe that Tabitha should be in talks with your sons to take away your car keys!
Really is sad that joe biden is running for president...why dont democrats see he has medical issues...Its crazy how democrats hate trump so much..theyre blind to see joe bidens flaws....
I caught Biden plagiarizing Trump's plan to manufacture everything we can here in the USA!! Great show!!

And this is why I would never vote #Biden2020. He is either a coward or doesn't want to face questions without a prompter. #votegold

Voter registration of young Black and brown activists, marching for change, is a unique opportunity for the Biden campaign. This age group should be able to also "march" to the ballot box, for change, on November 3rd, It would be a travesty if they are not registered to VOTE.

Biden would be 78 when he gets inaugurated if he wins. We need address this issue. We need a revamping of the political structure and have a revolution of younger people with fresh ideas. We don‚Äôt need people who were young adults when MLK died being in positions of power.
President Trump has allocated more money to black organizations / universities and improved the rate of job opportunities than Obama/ Biden. KNOW THE FACTS
The thing I‚Äôm worried about is that while Biden will get elected on Nov 3, he won‚Äôt be sworn until January. We will have 2 months of Donnie throwing tantrums, panicking, plotting ways to remain in the WH, and GOP trying to pre-fuck Biden‚Äôs presidency with some new ridiculous laws
I‚Äôm not exactly thrilled at Biden being the torchbearer against 45, but all he really has to do is run stuff like this for his ads.

True. Trump &amp; his Nazis don‚Äôt give a FUCK for America OR its people. But Joe Biden does, &amp; that is why I‚Äôm voting for him.
Then that would be trump, as biden usually in a room alone with no one to hear him..but  himself

Yup. Biden will take the state because of the dumb electoral college &amp; I get to vote with conviction. If I lived in a swing state I'd hold my nose &amp; vote Biden
Biden will push for clean energy, creating millions of jobs in the solar, hydro and wind turbine industries!!!
Whoa, whoa. Why the hate? Nobody attacked you. But if I lived in a swing state I'd hold my nose and vote for a Dem for the 1st time ever. Literally anyone is better than Trump. Joe Biden, Joe Budden, Joe Montana, Joe Mantegna. Anyone.
Barr needs to be arrested and prosecuted under a Biden Administration.
Perhaps Biden should disband DHS entirely when he takes over in January. Certainly disband the corrupt and rancid Border Patrol.
Yes. You're correct. I already said he's piggybacking off the Obama lovefest. Biden name drops him constantly to get the black vote. It's not a mystery.
I'll deal in facts. Believe me, on Nov 4th I'll be the most vocal Biden hater out there. Unfortunately he's our only hope
Oh I can't vote in primaries. And don't fool yourself, the GOP and DNC pick who they want. They thought Hillary was more "electable" and feel Biden can just piggyback off the Obama lovefest. Just hope it doesn't cost us again.
I will. And thankfully in my state don't have to hold my nose &amp; vote for Biden.
Did I hear you use Biden terminology? üòÇ You said MALARKY.... ‚ù§Ô∏èIt!
Did I just hear you use a BIDEN term????? Did you just say Malarky?üòÇ  ‚ù§Ô∏è it!
Well in my state the dumb Electoral College is guaranteed to go Biden so I can vote 3rd party with no ill effect.
Fair enough. I'm just lucky to live in a state where my vote doesn't really count so I won't have to hold my nose &amp; vote Biden.
That's BS. Totally depends what state you live in because of the electoral college. In NY I have that luxury. In a swing state I'd hold my nose &amp; vote for sniffy Biden.
isnt it more likely that this is just a rhetorical strategy to cover the gop's ass in the event of a loss so they can claim that biden won due to fraud and impeach him over it?  both parties are just 24/7 grievance politics, meanwhile the rest of us just want healthcare
To be fair it's not like Joe Biden was ever vice president with clear ambitions of being president.
Yeah it's truly sickening...I hope Biden campaign just keeps drilling down he does not want to defund police.... This is all Trump is has got. Scare tactics &amp; playing on racial fears. We are at a time of racial Justice/reconing &amp; growth and this man is truly a monster!
And honestly, given all the criminality, dementia and blatant racism of trump, what the heck could they put on Biden to equal that?
That would be one more days work than Joe Biden has done

the wedge that Trump is trying to drive into the #2020Election so that he can declare a landslide victory on election night when the in person votes are counted first, then say the mail in votes mostly for Biden that get counted afterwards are "fake" and "illegal" votes.
Lol...so, just to be clear, Biden is now too far to the left for Bernie Sanders‚Äô supporters? Have you thought this through?
So the veepstakes are already getting ugly. I‚Äôm on the record as pro-Warren (for POTUS &amp; VP), but this coordinated hit job on Harris is all but leaving Biden with no choice. Chris Dodd and co. need to have several seats. This was supposed to be Biden‚Äôs choice, now I don‚Äôt know.
Me either. Just vote for Biden and we will get back to reality.
I would say yes, only because Harris is being criticized for being ‚Äútoo ambitious.‚Äù If Biden picked what certain advisors believe to be a less ambitious woman, how is that not misogyny?

It‚Äôs July fundraising deadline day, and that means both the Trump and Biden campaign are making big ad pushes for donations.  Today‚Äôs #AdOfTheDay is a Trump ad, which says that any contribution to the campaign before midnight will be 600% matched:
Vote like Biden is behind!!!
I noticed you didn‚Äôt address a single thing I said. Nice ad hominem, though. Talk to me when Biden gets sued by the federal government for racial discrimination. We‚Äôre done here.
idk about all that lol ‚Äúkeep‚Äù is a bold word choice after our country has been actively divided and destroyed over the last 4 years, but hopefully biden can help rebuild
But not to rape island like Clinton, Richardson etc. This isn‚Äôt partisan. Young girls were raped in a pedophile ring. It‚Äôs so disgusting.
Hell NO.  VOTE BIDEN.  Forget political correctness.  Get deranged Trump out of office.  Essential for our democracy.
Y‚Äôall yelling about Biden defunding the police when Trump is actively defunding cities in their entirety ‚Äî which includes the police but also parks, schools, construction, first responders etc
Of course they are! Keep it up Creepy Joe-Communist are trying to take over our country, illegal aliens will be trying to get back to their countries This was the promise DNC made so Sanders-who was beating Biden-would drop out. Commies  TRUMP 2020
If this is true, Biden‚Äôs campaign needs to reorganize their FL staff ASAP
No he isn‚Äôt. You don‚Äôt think he is the master controlling the Biden puppet, guess again.
You will, hell I can give the results now trump 1, Biden 330 million...
Sickening wasn't it? Using a funeral to campaign, sounded like a 2 bit preacher/ He never did anything for Black lives just enriched himself. He knows Biden is senile. It's clear who is running Creepy Joe's campaign.
LOL-Biden won't get people to come out to vote for him. DNC screwed Sanders supporters, he's senile, a liar, plagiarist &amp; been accused of rape, touching women, stole speeches &amp; was involved in biggest scandal in American history
Here's your candidate-Hope you lose. Bernie supporters were screwed again. This article is from 11 months ago, before DNC cracked their whip with the spineless Press &amp; made the other candidates drop out for fear a socialist Sanders would win lol-Read
Naaa Best President ever, you jeep your creepy Biden who like to touch women, been accused of rape, admitted liar,plagiarist called himself dumb, been around 47 yrs &amp; hung out with segregationists, against busing &amp; mass incarcerated Blacks with his Crime Bill
Joe Biden when he opens his mouth about anything to do with ‚Äúracism‚Äù
im so conflicted because i fucking hate trump and want him out of office and never hear about his ugly ass ever again but i also fucking hate biden and don‚Äôt want to vote for him cause he‚Äôs a sexual abuser üòî
I didn't give Biden enough credit in the primaries, but he knows how to play the game.
Biden has been doing the wise thing: nothing. Whether it's him or his team advising him, he is just letting Trump hang himself.  Never interrupt your opponent when they're making a mistake.
Biden staying out of the spotlight has worked to his advantage. Trump has been looking like a whiny idiot in public. All Biden has to do is bide his time.
Biden because of the current circumstances.  People bringing up the 2016 election don't realize it was a different world then. Trump ran on an anti-establishment platform. Now he is the establishment. He has absolutely bungled COVID-19 and the economy is in weak shape.
Their polling has been fantastic (by Trump standards) this week-  YouGov has him practically neck and neck with Biden, along with Zogby, Rasmussen, and others
Everybody needs to vote. This race is tightening up. Trump is almost pulling neck and neck with Biden.
I travel through a tri-state area regularly, Biden signs I can count on my hands. Trump signs everywhere I go
To sum it up, everything Joe Biden isnt.
That is our system. Trump will only be president for 8 years because Biden doesn't know what planet he's on.
You care nothing about the risks to our democracy. If you did you wouldn't have asked Ukraine to interfere in our election. If the call was so perfect how come after impeachment you didn't call Zelesky and ask him again to investigate Biden? Because it wasn't a perfect call.
Meanwhile, I show you pictures of Biden  clearly sniffing 12 year olds or younger and you condone, excuse, ignore, his behavior. Typical radical commie leftist.
Can you even IMAGINE   engaging in any kind of Presidential transition with President Biden?  üòÇ
Definitely not politicizing a death. But I bet they‚Äôre Republicans for Biden‚Äô because Trump ‚Äòis demeaning our national conversation‚Äô... üôÑ  Trump‚Äôs very existence has broken so many brains, it‚Äôs staggering...
ü§≠ That's called a hug. Not like creeper Biden.
Biden is the joke.
Trump, this just shows what terrible job you have done at running country. Thanks for pointing this out. I‚Äôm voting for Biden. He will support our post office.
According to Illuminating‚Äôs unique ads data, Biden has made 106 different ad buys of this particular ad, ranking 10th on his unique ad buy list of the entire campaign.  He‚Äôs spent an estimated $255,697 and earned 10,439,448 impressions from this ad.
Joe Biden said he plans to announce his VP pick in August.   He‚Äôs recently been running an ad that encourages people to sign up to hear his VP pick first.  Today‚Äôs #AdOfTheDay:
Same with the woman who accused Biden of rape. Look back &amp; just a few months ago the leftist media has all kind of revealing articles of Biden when he was in last place. DNC worried about Sanders winning lol
Not sick &amp; mean spirited, just a man who ran for office. The left called Bush the devil, a liar,evil &amp; more. Biden's been around 47 yrs &amp; did nothing but lie,plagiarize,gave eulogy at a KKK member's funeral who was against civil rights bill, &amp; a crime bil-
Actually we work, enjoy freedom &amp; hate communists. Biden-2 time loser, admitted liar, plagiarist, cheat, involved in largest political scandal in US history,worked with segregationists, gave eulogy at his KKK mentor Robert Byrd who rejected 60s civil rights bill &amp; accused of rape
Like Joe Biden, Clinton, Pelosi, Leahy, Schumer, Durbin, Feinstein, Warner, Wyden have made a mess of this country, lived off the taxpayers for decades? Biden 47 yrs in politics who can't remember what city he's in or who wrote 1994 Crime Bill led to mass incarceration of Blacks

From a FB friend...  Joe Biden, April 2020: ‚ÄúMark my words: I think [Trump] is gonna try to kick back the election somehow.‚Äù  Donald Trump‚Äôs response: ‚Äú[these are] the incoherent, conspiracy theory ramblings of a lost candidate who is out of touch with reality.‚Äù  Donald Trump:
BIDEN IS ALWAYS RIGHT: . "Mark my words: I think he is gonna try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can't be held," Biden said at a virtual fundraiser in April, according to a pool report.
It is critically important to not only support Joe Biden, but help every possible race down the ballot. Republicans have abdicated responsibility to put a check on Trump. All politicians with an R need to be voted out. ALL OF THEM.
2020 election: Where Trump and Biden stand on health, economy, more issues
Also, no one asked Warren to apologize for saying Biden was running in the wrong primary. Total double standard! Makes me so mad!
Best Biden ad is Trump holding a press conference.
Dress rehearsal for a coming 1933 Reichstag Fire style event should he be able to cast sufficient doubt on a narrow Biden win.  I believe that the target will be a Federal Building (hence the emphasis on them)  ...and now I sound like a tin foil hat guy
THIS is why  Biden had Harris's name on his notes.  It was prep in case he was asked about Dodd's grudge which led him to leak the "no remorse" remarks as pointed out by Politico the day before.  Staff anticipated there might be a ?  I doubt it was a hidden tell she is his choice
If a woman is on Biden's list of 12, they are qualified and are being considered. We have to let him make his decision, his choice, with all input and his own comfort level ("sympatico") considered.

Too ambitious those people in the Biden campaign news to sit the duck down
It is time for 350 and other climate groups to break free from the Democrats. 350ACTION: The fossil fuel industry is thrilled about Joe Biden‚Äôs climate plan. Without a ban on fracking, they will continue to pollute communities and ruin the climate. Vote for the real #GreenNewDeal
You mean like Biden did ....
All these FACTS are why I won‚Äôt settle for Biden . Neither Biden or Trump should be President !
Senile &amp; racist  being Joe Biden                   But these hypocrites are blind to it. Instead just focusing on
RUSH: Politico yesterday ran a story claiming that Kamala Harris is Biden's VP pick. And then they scrubbed the piece. They scrubbed the story. Now, how does this happen?
Biden has decided...because his team is..  That does not make sense.
Joe Biden is fairly moderate, actually, but then again,  thinks anyone who believes in governance is a radical leftist #GetRealTrump #VoteBlue2020 #Biden2020
The good thing is if the Biden motorcade has low on air she can blow them up
Senile old man. put him back in the basement
Biden. a senile old man who has suddenly after 50 yrs in politics has a revelation &amp; NOW knows what to do. NO he doesn't He was involved in SPYGATE, greatest scandal in American history to take down a sitting President. I'm voting for Trump  -watch
yes..so does the rest of America!! Does Trump know Biden is way ahead of him in the polls??
FORMER Vice President Biden involved in biggest political scandal in US history along w/Obama,Comey Brennan, Rice &amp; Biden SPYING on a candidate/President elect &amp; he wants to be President, LOL you lied on Cavuto. Biden said this about closing border
If she‚Äôs not Biden‚Äôs VP I hope she ends of in charge of some committee or better yet on the Supreme Court!
The exception is Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee for President who won't support a ban on fracking and works hard to convince the fossil fuel industry that they will do just fine with him in the White House. As they did with Obama. Vote #Green for GND
I hate trump but clearly biden shows very predatorial behavior with children. both shouldn‚Äôt be in the position they‚Äôre in
Doesn‚Äôt matter. She will be a strong running mate for Biden. If Biden wins, the world will be safer &amp; better. India is part of this world.
My grandfather had dementia/Alzheimer‚Äôs and walked/talked the same way as Biden does! This man has suffered severe mental decline and the country needs to see/know that before voting
i actually had to check because i was SURE this was a parody account... anyway donald trump is a white supremacist please go vote (for biden) this novemberü•∞
She may have done it again, Biden is announcing his running mate next week üòÄ
Joe Biden will choose Susan Rice as his VP!
I suspect that everything will get much better pretty darn quick, if Biden gets elected.
Isn‚Äôt it funny if Biden picks Harris, she will be the first  bi-racial VP (potential 2nd President) and neither her or Obama is a descendent if a slave, rather they  are actually descendants of slave owners . #TheMoreYouKnow
I‚Äôll edit this one. Biden keeps hanging onto one word subjects and on and on. I know it‚Äôs the party that‚Äôs doing this but time to quit that. Now more of you will help as I keep saying. Stay safe and God bless you.
In addition to what I said I‚Äôm getting so tired of seeing Biden on television he seems to be in there all day long and we see you only ones in a while we need you make America better God bless you
Joe Biden‚Äôs notes on Kamala Harris: ‚ÄòDo not hold grudges‚Äô
1st time Biden called for any of this..also his comments that the local police can handle it - was he confused? The local &amp; state authorities refuse! Looks like Biden has pissed off some of his voters. The American ppl have no tolerance for this crap. Sorry you have to live there
Biden Biden Biden all the way get the thugs out of office
I just reviewed that platform. Other than the SS piece at the bottom, this seems very similar to Bernie‚Äôs base platform. This platform is definitely further left than Joe Biden‚Äôs platform.
the reason this is on the list was most likely in case he was asked about  the Chris Dodd leak.  He was prepared in case...nothing more. Joe tends to gaffe he was staying on point
LOL, if Biden wins??? I'll buy a bottle, take any money I have &amp; bury it in my back field. He wants to bring back cash for clunkers. The man is a fruitcake, dropped out of 2 previous Pres elections-got caught lying, cheating, plagiarism
The more I think of it, the more a  ticket makes sense. Biden can focus on repairing our global image and Bass can get to work on practical/progressive domestic policy. Does no harm. Activates the Dem base. Let‚Äôs go! #Biden2020
Jerry Nadler like Biden &amp; many of these politicians, has made his living off the taxpayers for decades &amp; he has forgotten he is a public servant. He's afraid of a 30 yr old dumb as a box of rocks ex bartender AOC getting someone to run him out of office-the man can barely walk
Former Sanders campaign co-chair Nina Turner compares voting for Biden to eating 'bowl of shit'
First of all, currently it‚Äôs NOT right before the election. And secondly, Biden is doing better in AZ, FL, NC, MI, PA, OH, IA, TX, and GA. Oh, and there‚Äôs a pandemic.
doesn't it make sense that perhaps Biden was prepared to answer any possible questions that might arise given this
It‚Äôd help him deflect the ‚ÄúBiden and the Democrats want to defend the police‚Äù ads that are doubtlessly coming. It‚Äôs not going to help him with the far left, but at this point their minds are already made up. She honestly seems like a good choice to me.
It‚Äôs a smart move. Biden is playing the game pretty well.
Seriously.... you couldn‚Äôt make this stuff up... Moron and Moron JR... have got to go!!!! BIDEN 2020üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏ Save Americaüá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏ Save the World!!!
As soon as Biden chooses his VP, get ready for all the sexist comments on how she may have ‚Äúslept her way‚Äù into the job, or how she got Botox, or how expensive her suits are.  They would never have those assertions for men!
Watch Biden's remarks on how he's mobilizing a 21st century care and early childhood education workforce to deal with the caregiving crisis in our nation.
Do not vote for Biden Because if you do You will turn this country into communism He's up socialist in a socialist Is communist
What is America coming to That we have to vote Donald trump at office Are you people in this country serious you gonna vote for joe Biden Joe Biden is a Obama puppet He is just Live in his life too nigger
Joseph Biden your a nigger loving bitch

I know people keep bringing that up but the landscape of 2016 isn't the one of 2020. Biden is not Clinton. Trump is not the anti-establishment candidate, he is the establishment now.
Biden had a live press conference on policy. msnbc didn‚Äôt  cover it. If it were trump you would have. You helped give us trump in 2016 and you‚Äôre doing it again in 2020. Fortunately CNN covered it.
Biden Press Conference with just 1 polite question at a time. Still  seemed he could go off the rails if pressed. His claim Trump was too friendly with Putin/Russia compared to Joe is either forgetful or a lie given Obama/Biden was very Putin/Russia friendly '09 thru '12
I‚Äôm so glad that  interrupted the #BarrHearing for whatever nonsense Biden had to say... dose anyone know WTF he was talking about? I thought this was supposed to be about Systemic racism?
Well the #BarrHearing just ended... is Joe Biden still talking?
RUSH: All of the news that Biden's got it in the bag, that Biden's up by 10, 12, 13, whatever it is, they aren't true, they never have been true.
Oh boy, basement Biden has emerged and is moving his mouth!
I just Tuned into  what the actual fuck is Biden talking about? #okboomer
. no one gives a shit about Joe Biden Put the #BarrHearing back on or I‚Äôm gonna turn it to #cspan whoops too late #RealNews
‚ÄúThe plan calls for new construction of 1.5 million homes and public housing units and for creating a new advanceable tax credit of up to $15,000 designed to help families of color make a down payment for their first homes.‚Äù

Biden may be racist, but he is not the president; Non-racist Donald Trump is the current president; just wanted to clarify for fake news CNN

The first debate will be Trump and Biden trying to pass various cognitive tests
Today‚Äôs #AdOfTheDay is a Donald Trump attack against the Democrats and Joe Biden on the issue of police reform.
you guys seriously gave mine and other‚Äôs contact info to the Biden camapaign?

Of course she does.  We will never forget. Biden should be impeached -don't have to hold public office. The man has been around 50 yrs, enriched himself &amp; his family, accused of rape (what happened to her?) Spied on Trump
LOL she's dodging questions while she's living with the Obamas who never left DC...hmmmmm What are they up to? We know senile Joe whose in his basement hiding isn't calling the shots. Joe?? Where are you??
I hope everyone is ready for the absolute shit-show twitter will be when Biden makes his VP selection. IT WILL BE INSANE!!! I‚Äôm definitely logging off for a week or so once the pick is in (which I‚Äôm about 94.7% sure will be Harris, even though I‚Äôm holding out hope for Warren).
Very true but then Obama&amp; Biden didn‚Äôt prosecute anyone for their criminal acts so it led to the GOP becoming even more extreme and led to Trump . So to be honest why anyone would vote republican or for a Corporate Centrist Dem is beyond me both are evil one is just open about it
Who would have had the possibility of Joe Biden as the articulator of a new regime down on political time bingo like two years ago?
‚ÄúThose who support Medicare for All are throwing their vote away by voting for Joe Biden. A vote for Hawkins/Walker is a vote for Medicare for All. A vote for Biden means Medicare for All will get lost in the sauce."  Read the full statement at
Please have  on your show to discuss 2M lost votes in 2016. Republicans will steal the 2020 election. These polls barely have Biden at 50% of the vote.
Biden who lied about his involvement in the civil rights movement,crafted the racist 94 crime bill&amp;called the segregationists he worked with good people is being applauded its disgraceful&amp; unacceptable! Neither Biden nor Trump should be President but neither party has any morals
Because the gop term mob for protesters wasn't resonating, they turned to anarchists, they turn to US citizens hate America and it's all Joe Biden's fault.  Nothing further from the truth.
Biden gauges environment and stretches only as much as the populace is willing to embrace. He is progressive, and he is shrewd. We will need to win the Senate by big margin though.
Future President Joe Biden could really give a shit about a book you put out. Try to catch up with Mary tRUMP's book sales.
I‚Äôm concerned about voting suppression and the  chronic push back against Democrats by the sleazy thug Republicans. But I am super enthusiastic about removing trump from the office he continues to destroy. And I think Biden  can mend some of these chasms. I will be voting.
Joe Biden had it covered well.
Seeing the Democratic Party refuse to vote to add Medicare for All and Legalizing Cannabis better shut the fuck up about how the young aren't excited about Biden
that's right, if the President can be falsely accused, harassed, investigated, impeachment, spied on by CLINTON, BIDEN, OBAMA, COMEY &amp; CO than so can they. Biden's corrupt. 50 yrs in politics &amp; he brings his son around the world taking $$ after getting kicked out of Naval academy
We are now officially the only national campaign that stands with the majority in this country who support #MedicareForAll.  The Democratic Party is against it, and Joe Biden said he‚Äôd veto it.  and I say healthcare is a human right.
Lol at that platform. Biden will probably win, but not with my vote
Naaa you have been around 50 yrs in politics &amp; hiding in a basement. Plagiarist, cheater, liar &amp; accused of rape, touchy feely
Fact dems BIDEN had held office for almost 50 yrs, has 2 failed previous runs  president-He had to pull out for getting caught lying,cheating &amp; plagiarism They squandered the power of incumbency while enriching themselves_&gt;Biden, his son Obama, Pelosi
Joe Biden could still lose this election     This guy agrees with me that Biden should pull out of the debates; it's got to happen, why chance things?
Glad to see Biden got today of the mullet.
Reported numbers have always been suspect. They've included people who were terminal, car accidents, Democrat Govs sending sick into Nursing homes killing thousands. People have watched the President for months working endlessly on the virus &amp; Congress went home, Biden in hiding
So a woman who lied to Americans over &amp; over about  Benghazi scandal, unmasked Americans &amp; was involved in Russia Scandal Hoax is way up on Obama...I mean Creepy Joe Biden's list of VPs.Of course she is. They have to protect her from possible jail sentences
I think you need a clarification. I am a boat owner and know many that are Biden supporters. I think you mean Yacht owners.
Biden is petrified of debating the President. It is obvious suffers from dementia, comes off angry, he was involved in Russia scam that included spying on a President &amp; his campaign that costs taxpayers millions, his son was receiving millions/billion from China &amp; Ukraine deal
Not really it isn‚Äôt Biden‚Äôs fault he isn‚Äôt the only one shutting it down it‚Äôs the majority of the party. The point is Biden isn‚Äôt to blame for M4A not happening you have to start with a public option and work your way there
Since the change of campaign managers, Trump has ceased punching himself in the face. We're still in the mid-rounds, which will cause Biden to get off the stool, which could be disastrous.
This is what a President looks like. Contrast this photo with the spectacle of the current occupant of the WH conducting a taxpayer-funded campaign event this afternoon in NC. I can‚Äôt wait for Biden to take office.
Those who support Medicare for All are throwing their vote away by voting for  He is indebted to Wall Street, the insurance and pharmaceutical industries. A vote for #HawkinsWalker is a vote for #M4A . A vote for Biden means Medicare for All will get lost in the sauce!
lol, the party that nominated Biden has gone too far and the one that supports Trump is reasonable? Yeah, definitely checks out.
Not surprised. Hiden Biden

The scary part of the upcoming Presidential election is that either Trump or Biden will win.
RUSH: What all of this means is that you shouldn't be believing anything in the news about Biden leading in the polls, about Biden being way ahead of Trump.
Anyone who does not intend to vote for Joe Biden, I have a good psychiatrist for you.  Good luck Grace I love your music.
I also want Joe Biden to win
Why doesn‚Äôt  call out  then.....Biden wouldn‚Äôt even know where he was, like he normally does anyways, by the time Chris Wallace was done with the interview
RUSH: I&amp;#039;ve had a couple emails from people asking, &amp;#34;Hey, Rush, what do you think about this projection that Trump is gonna lose everything?&amp;#34;
Agreed! Constantly trying to appeal to the base is part of the reason why POTUS has such a huge mountain to climb for reelection. The base is not leaving Biden for anybody and it‚Äôs about expanding his tent which Harris will not do.
The Russian spies found out what types of pollen  &amp; Dr Jill Biden are allergic to... next year trump will be tweeting ‚Äúsneezy joe‚Äù from the cell phone his lawyers smuggled into prison.
I think Biden is struggling to pick between someone more similar to what he was for Obama in that position and someone who would still do well in that role, but also could take over if something happens or carry the mantle in 2024.
IMO Bass would be the ideal VP pick because of her legislative relationships and demeanor. I think the only issue is Biden‚Äôs age and people wanting someone in that slot that they believe could be an effective President if something were to happen.
Today‚Äôs #AdOfTheDay is a Joe Biden attack ad critical of Donald Trump. According to the Facebook Ad Library, 69% of the impressions from this ad came from women.  The ad began running on July 26:
Are you shutting me Biden is a million times better then trump. Trump is a full blown racist. Biden has gotten an award from civil rights groups for his work. Get a grip. And this is about saving the country and getting rid of trump for certain people a lot is on the line
I'm voting for Biden because he's a harder worker than you. He doesn't spend an entire morning on Twitter retweeting people. All these people are tweeting how great this military bill is. How long before you take the money for raises to use for your border wall like last year ?
Liz Peek: Biden-Democrat sweep in November would destroy country. Here's their plan
Seriously; why shut down; people need to be smart and wear proper masks; or are you suggesting shutdown to help Biden get elected; might as well keep the country shut down for those four years since Biden is clueless and is being forced to the far left
My money is on Biden. He'll forget who he is and go Hulk-o-mania on trump.
YUP. When it was primary season, they were rallying behind Biden &amp; I voiced my concerns about his track record with Black people &amp; they said it was ‚Äúbullying‚Äù lmfao.
Lol it‚Äôs especially funny because Biden is such a milquetoast centrist. What a ridiculous claim.
If and when Biden is elected, first thing he should order is to have it torn down. The symbolism of that alone would be powerful.
Joe Biden spent an estimated $543,795 from July 20-26, and earned 26,081,430 impressions. The overwhelming majority of Biden‚Äôs ads were classified as ‚Äúcivil‚Äù in message tone. #Illuminating2020

Here's your cloud...and it's been lifted. Senile Joe Biden is being hidden away because he suffers from severe DEMENTIA-He's senile. The angry old white liberal candidate is SENILE &amp; a proven liar, cheat &amp; calls himself dumb-Watch
Man, Biden is gonna have to fumigate the White House for  bedbugs and Covid.
Speaking of scum your angry old senile white candidate Biden is in hiding because he suffers from severe dementia, He's actually afraid to take questions but wants to be President, LOL COME ON NO SHOW JOE. Where are you????
You stick with the loser racist Biden who has a proven history of two failed past elections of dropping out due to being a plagiarist, a liar &amp; issues working with segregationists on crime bill
Green Party prez nominee Howie Hawkins disagreed: ‚ÄúBiden is nowhere close to the GND. Besides having a timeline for emissions more than 20 years slower, he leaves out the other half, which is an economic bill of rights‚Äîguaranteed jobs, single payer healthcare, housing, etc.‚Äù
Biden's platform is the most progressive platform of any legitimate party nominee in any of our lifetimes. This is where I realize I am wasting my time with you and bid you good day.
Because Biden isn't a psychopathic narcissist?
Yes, 2016 was rigged by your boy Putin... we all know it.  2020 will be undisputed WIN for Biden.
I'm not a trump fan but Biden has no chance if it's up to the people.
He‚Äôs doing it because he sees every poll saying he‚Äôs getting killed and saying Biden would handle the virus better. If he wins, the day after the election he will act like it‚Äôs not happening again.
Biden‚Äôs corruption and the fact that Democrats will make every attempt to destroy suburbs should be exposed by the Trump campaign at every turn! Democrats are courting suburban women for support. Appears they think women are dumb/uninformed.
I keep getting Trump/Biden ads on YouTube, so people must know
New: President, United , States ,of ,America. Biden can repeat that !
That‚Äôs really funny!
Well, you were referring to Trump not doing what was recommended, and I showed you that he was ahead of ALL of his critics.   Ask about dated materials, get dated materials.   Currently, the news media is hoping that everyone's memory is as short as yours and Biden's.
When people heard Bernie‚Äôs platform in the south, they liked it, but were skeptical, sometimes for understandable reasons .  We didn‚Äôt overcome that skepticism.  We fell short in the critical moment.  That is all I can say‚Ä¶
Couldn‚Äôt it split the insanity vote and help Biden?
In reality, nobody in the real world cares what Bernie said about Castro in 1985, any more than what Biden said about forced bussing in 1975.  I wish primary voters in the south made a different decision, but they didn‚Äôt.
Bernie was the front runner after the Nevada caucuses.  In my opinion, he lost because Dem voters in primaries will still take direction from partisan media outlets and party leaders like Clyburn, mistakes made in strategy (Biden was always his enemy, not Warren and should always
Pennsylvania will thrive with a President Biden.
Bob said every Dem candidate this cycle was bad.  Bernie almost got there, but fell short.  Not sure what votes Harris adds that Biden doesn‚Äôt already get.  Maybe his VP choice will matter, maybe not‚Ä¶
Yes if Trump cheats and wins he will accept the results, but if Biden wins by a landslide he won‚Äôt accept the results ! Yup that‚Äôs about right for Diddly Giddly !
Harris claims about Biden and busing were pretty insane:
Yes too much at stake , what like turning America communist ? Stealing people‚Äôs freedom...and stealing the election.   Make sure you have Biden debate Trump.
Just so we are clear on the fact check. Biden‚Äôs plan of fracking is gradual progress, which we should all support a movement toward clean energy in a smart economical way.
THAT JUST IS NOT TRUE!! More Trumpanzee propaganda  and lies!! Read up on Joe Biden then read up on TRUMP!!
Wow!  Koolaid much?  The WHO was saying that the travel ban wasn't necessary when Trump enacted it.   Biden said that Trump was xenophobic for it.  Pelosi wanted people to celebrate the Chinese new year in March.  Schumer and DeBlasio called for people to gather at the same time.
I would really hate to see it happen But I think that joe Biden will probably die in office Because he's like he has dementia and Alzheimer's disease
Mr. Donald J. trump For president again for another 4 years I'm voting for him you know why I'm voting for him because Biden is on Obama puppet
What scrutiny is Biden supposed to get he isn‚Äôt doing stupid shit like trump. And the debates won‚Äôt change anything people thought the same when he debated Bernie one on one. And it‚Äôs easy to debate trump he‚Äôs done so much wrong you‚Äôll never run out of things to talk about
If you think the country is heading in the wrong dir3ction because of the President, you better open you mind. The liberals, and socialists remain pushing this country in the wrong direction. You ain‚Äôt seen nothing yet, if Biden wins in November this country will be destroyed.
And if Republicans are serious about shaking Trump if he loses, then transforming their party by working on moderation with some of Joe Biden‚Äôs initiatives would be the way to go.
Or stop grasping desperately at singular polls and look at the averages instead -- which have Biden up +7.
Wow!   A video from the future under the Biden administration?  That's amazing!

Fire his ass! When Trump and Biden meet for the ‚Äúpeaceful transfer of power‚Äù, Biden should do Trump‚Äôs stupid hand gesture and just say ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre fired!‚Äù I‚Äôm sorry but it will be the best moment of the decade, possibly the century, when he goes away. What a snake oil salesmen?

Democrats know full well that Biden is on cognitive decline. The leadership knows it, and the voters know it. THEY DON‚ÄôT CARE!!  Which leads 1 to wonder what do they have planned if Biden wins?   Who will be running the country because it certainly won‚Äôt be Joe?
I have full faith that Biden will blow this.

Actually-photoshopped so you again are being dishonest. KKK-no that would be Biden who gave the eulogy at one of the biggest West Virginia Klansman-Robert Byrd the man kissing clinton
I mean Biden wasn‚Äôt wrong trump is a proven racist. From refusing to let black people rent his apartments to almost getting 5 innocent black kids killed bc of their skin color. He called blm a hate group whole praising the scum in Virginia. Kanye is helping corrupt racist trump
Biden‚Äôs whipping you just by being a good man.  He‚Äôs sane too.
If Biden wins Texas or Florida it‚Äôs over
Actually he's a very successful businessman who brought us the lowest unemployment in history, including Black &amp; Latino, reversed Biden's horrific 1994 Crime Bill that led to mass incarceration of Black community, created job growth &amp; yes Trump was spied on by a bunch of lowlifes
Biden will whine less
He can say what he wants his actions speak louder. He‚Äôs a trump supporter trying to take away POC and younger votes for Biden to help trump win. He knows he has no shot of winning it‚Äôs all about helping  trump
A vote for anyone but Biden is essentially a vote for trump.
You‚Äôre going to beat Biden off??
Serious answer, not at all....serious question on your concerned about continuing to live in trump's America? He has dragged us down so much, how anyone could support him is beyond belief. It is rich to warn of Biden's America when we are living a nightmare
So you think that Trump hasn‚Äôt done anything for minorities in almost 4 years, so you now want to elect Biden who hasn‚Äôt done anything for minorities in 47 years?
Not true,there is such a thing as clean coal. You should stop getting your news from CNN MSNBC, NBC this is where this came from. And I'll bet you were never told Biden Obama/Brennan/Comey &amp; others spied on Trump's campaign.Hillary actually hired Russians. Emails, texts are there
IN BIDEN"S words-not right wing-his mouth and back when media was honest &amp; informative
What is? I get me news from many sources but not on here. I remember Biden from the 1st time he ran &amp; had to quit &amp; 2nd time he had to quit both due to disgrace-read it, watch it for yourself, WAPO NYT, TIME, Youtube, ABC NBC, CBS-all true-he worked with racist segregationists
The only poll that matters is the one on Nov 3rd.  Biden may be ahead in the polls but we must consider cheating, voter suppressing, electoral college bullshit, messing with the mail system, EVERYTHING.  VOTE NO MATTER WHAT THE POLLS SAY!
Hey Dawn, you do realize who BUILT those cages you're complaining about in your profile, and had MANY more children in them, right?  Obama/Biden.
No way. Depending on the article there‚Äôs a solid split of people trashing trump and loving him. Solid split of people living Biden and saying he‚Äôs shot. Solid split of people supporting BLM and filthy racists. The section is disgusting. Be done with it.
That was initiated by the Obama/Biden administration!
Americans who will never vote for Biden. Police, veterans, Republicans, petroleum workers, investors, 401k holders, border state citizens, health care workers and anyone who loves America. Good luck. Go back to sleep joe. JFK is in disbelief that you‚Äôre the best his party has
MSM will announce Biden as the winner no matter what the real results are
... and a code 46 in the military means FUBAR.   Describes Biden wonderfully.
Fuck that. Biden can go on Fox when trump decides to take an interview from Rachel Maddow. Think Wallace was tough, Maddow will make trump cry
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Biden is up 9 points, please don‚Äôt fuck this up
I‚Äôm definitely voting for Joe Biden.
Biden‚Äôs numbers go right through. Must be more Trump incompetence or avarice.
When he said he could have had an interview with Joe Biden in 2019 I knew where this was going. You dont just get a democratic nominee on the wire.  Barstool is 20s 30s, two thirds men. Its a demographic resource. They have a feeling what he would say, didnt feel he was worth it
"I was offered an interview with Joe Biden"  Lmao they think youre a liberal m8 and therefore yah. Like. Fills in the blanks. "Do we ask him?" "He'll cry"  v0v sucks but the door for barstool+politics is open. Shit just look at the comments its been open forever apparently.
Lmao you are a complete joke. Biden was guilty from the start in your eyes and look at you know. This is one of the most pathetic things I‚Äôve ever seen. ü§°
Native bro who had covid19 is back to posting pro biden/anti trump memes on facebook.  It's a miracle.
There‚Äôs no need for projection when you listen to Biden speak. It‚Äôs a shame that his family &amp; the Democrats are letting this happen to someone who‚Äôs obviously in decline.

CNN seems really disappointed that Trump did well in a cognitive test. I wonder if they‚Äôd like Biden to take the same test to see how well he does?
Isn‚Äôt it funny that Biden actually stated the opposite of that? The GOP really does hate telling the truth. As Stephen Colbert once said, ‚Äúreality has a well known liberal bias.‚Äù
Must be his Biden impersonation
Here too. We need Biden mailing them to folks
and he walked out in the mound with the ball.   Anyone ever watch Biden do his mask parade when he walks out but never puts it on when he leaves from the same place he came?
Wild show. On Point has moved from being biased against Republicans to openly having an agenda to get Biden elected this November.

Biden's 5 words....  Get Out Of My Office
Trump's announcement about Jacksonville came hours after Quinnipiac released a poll showing Biden leading Trump 51% to 38% in Florida.
He got some references wrong, such as the claim that Biden's plan defunded police.  That's not written in his policies, it was stated in an interview.   Other than that, there was give and take on both sides.   One thing to consider when talking about Trump, he's P.T.Barnum.
Yes, I did see the interview. Not Trump's finest, but did you hear Wallace say that, he doesn't expect it but if Biden agreed to  an interview he wouldn't pull punches with him either.   I'm not anticipating Biden's campaign to jump on that one, not when Biden flubbed NBC's.
Damn..I had a weird video sent to me weeks ago..b.s. about deep state,Biden,Obama..such nonsense..

Joseph Biden is like the flawed good guy we see in movies. He's not perfect, and he's not afraid to admit it. The thing is, he cares about people more than himself. He's an old school Catholic boy who loves his country and understands suffering and struggle. He's a hero for US!
His son rec'd 1.5 billion from China while traveling around world w/ Daddy  on taxpayer $$$. They are communists so Biden's statement? Being a good communist.This election is a fight for freedom. The Marxists/Anarchists trying to takeover after their failed coup attempt.

wow again biased lies. Now your mind readers. Biden-&gt; Plagiarism, unmasking Gen Flynn secret meeting on attempted coup-leaks and his prize? Same day Biden gets medal of freedom, lol He has called Blacks predators, his crime bill led to more prisons &amp; mass incarceration of Blacks
says who? Your office people? LOL Your reporting is totally biased and it shows.  This is real journalism Have you reported on this? Or Biden's brain surgeries, aneurysms? Sad but voters have a right to know his health. He had clots in lungs as well
Here's truth -you'll be educated on Biden's last two times running-he's an admitted liar, plagiarist &amp; cheat-WATCH in his words &amp; when media was honest .One journalist reporting? Dan Rather, imagine that
Biden had to quit 2 past Presidential runs-not because he was losing, because he was lying, cheating, stealing speeches, plagiarizing. He also had 2 brain aneurysms &amp; a lung blood clot-had brain surgery. Generations have grown up &amp; Dems are banking that this doesn't come up.Errol probably praying that Biden choose Bass. Lol. He gon lose anyways but he probably hoping with Bass out of the way things may be easier for him come November
You mean the kids in cages under Bush and Obama? Those kids? How about Biden being notoriously anti-LGBT? The author of the 1994 Crime Bill that mass incarcerated black men for non violent offenses? The Biden that condemned rioters throughout Obama‚Äôs presidency?
If these white men are pushing so hard against Kamala and then pivoting to another black, I‚Äôm positive this is an untrustworthy source and biden should DEF go with Kamala!
I mean, like come on..this president skid mark hasn't won a head 2 head poll against Biden in like...4ever

Again that's not true. More people are registered Independents than Democrats or Republicans. The greatest obstacle is to overcome the brainwashing that's been so effectively done my the MSM to make people feel like they have but 2 choices. Same BS like "Biden is Joe electable".
So does Biden.
No you wake up! Trump isn't the problem; he's the symptom. Biden and Pelosi has done more damage to the 99% than Trump.

Chief Designs,  You can always leave it to #Democrats like #Biden to fulfill the GOP's wet dreams on Social Security and Medicare.
You want to vote sleeeeeepy Joe Biden!! He will sleep for rest of his life.. Hahaha
Leave that alone! The intelligence agencies reported that it didn't happen. You sound like a broken record. Why aren't you focusing on the biggest crises of all time. Like Biden said, you waved the white flag on the Coronavirus. Still You are trying to  cause another distraction.
You do realize that is fake and no proof

Voter registration of young Black and brown activists, marching for change, is a unique opportunity for the Biden campaign. This age group should be able to also "march" to the ballot box, for change, on November 3rd, It would be a travesty if they are not registered to VOTE.

So much this... If Biden is serious about wanting to be the bridge to next generation of dem leadership, he should make his selection accordingly... It is the right thing to do, now and for the future.
A new hope looms when one is Ridin‚Äô with Biden!
There are 2 Presidents that were actually slave owners. Biden lucky the Democrats font have another choice.
Biden would be 78 when he gets inaugurated if he wins. We need address this issue. We need a revamping of the political structure and have a revolution of younger people with fresh ideas. We don‚Äôt need people who were young adults when MLK died being in positions of power.
Voting for biden wont change that either so. You fucked either way
The thing I‚Äôm worried about is that while Biden will get elected on Nov 3, he won‚Äôt be sworn until January. We will have 2 months of Donnie throwing tantrums, panicking, plotting ways to remain in the WH, and GOP trying to pre-fuck Biden‚Äôs presidency with some new ridiculous laws
The insane Governor of FL has cooked Trumps goose. Biden will have goose for dinner
I don‚Äôt believe that Joe Biden is going to be their candidate, just saying...
True. Trump &amp; his Nazis don‚Äôt give a FUCK for America OR its people. But Joe Biden does, &amp; that is why I‚Äôm voting for him.
He‚Äôs such a team player for sure, Lea Thompson! Go, Biden!
I pray he doesn‚Äôt! But idk, have you heard from Biden lately?
VP Biden was stricken with stuttering as a child. He worked hard to overcome it. There is no correlation between stuttering and intelligence, or cognition. After all, we all have something.
I am üî• fired up and ready to go for Joe! Who is the Biden campaign organizrer for the 5th Congressional District NY?
Trump can‚Äôt get over the fact that Biden can lead this country of ours perfectly in his sleep, Mrs. Krassenstein. The orange cheese puff can‚Äôt do that shit even when he is wide awake!
You talking about pace? Look at the finacial crisis Obama and Biden inherited. Look what he left the cognitive one. Racism will not allow you to give credit, i get that  but your guy, smh. Just goes to show white guys can be just as dumb as Kanye
I dont care if he said that on Fifth Avenue I'm still voting for JOE BIDEN period (I'm Black)
Biden is a back door for the Obama led crazy dems to gain control of the White House - and Biden is just happy to be there. Barely alive
Except Democrats are now Socialist, so if you have money, you won't have it much longer if brain dead Biden is elected. #ImVoting4BidenBecause  #BrainDeadBiden #DementiaJoe
Amazing how Joe Biden became worth over $200 million bucks on a VP salary of $230,000! #ImVoting4BidenBecause #BrainDeadBiden #DementiaJoe
Look I don‚Äôt like Biden either he ain‚Äôt perfect but to me, I‚Äôd rather his bad than trump. I see a selfish monster in that chair and you flawful hero. Kept kids in cages, passed a law that allows homes for the homeless to reject trans persons, and refused to even 1/2

And Biden was VP
Hey, Donald Trump is so twisted, he does not recognized that the country is in a crisis COVID-19. He is waging war on protesters in Portland Oregon by using the fake military police. However, reminds Donald Trump the enemies are Russian and COVID-19. Biden will win in 50 States.
This is literally Trump's America. #Biden will get us out of this. I can't wait. #BidenCoalitionThis guys still claiming Biden wants to defund / disband police, meanwhile he was proven to be lying about that on freakin Fox News, and he‚Äôs still out here lying about that to his racist fuck followers
I think anybody who votes on Cuba is against Biden already.
Biden is reading every word Bass ever wrote or uttered. The Scientology thing is not in itself disqualifying, nor is it buried deep. It would have come out the moment he chose her. So leak it now, take the temperature, allow yourself room to maneuver.
Given the current alternative I would so choose Biden over a wannabe dictator.  As for the Republicans what active policies have they set forth to benefit the African/Black American constituency since Eisenhower?
I think it comes from Biden.
So? Are you under the impression that Biden hasn‚Äôt already made his choice? Like 3 months ago?
If Biden does not pick one of the following three women of excellence, I will be very disappointed: Kamala Harris Elizabeth Warren Susan Rice
NIXON ODDS.  Updated as of July 31, 2020.  With regard to Vice President Biden‚Äôs running mate, here are my odds as off today.  Susan Rice - EVEN  Karen Bass - 4-1  Val Demings - 10-1  Kamala Harris - 15-1  Mrs Obama - 40-1  Elizabeth Warren - 200-1  Bernie Sanders - 1000-1

Under President Biden and a Dem Senate, add two justices to correct for McConnell‚Äôs dereliction of duty in 2016, which led to the appontment of Justice Gorsuch. Bring the total number of justices to eleven
You are 100% right. Would you let joe Biden vote?
Mike Pence spoke to hundreds of our brave law enforcement officers and Cops for Trump members from around the country who are facing a constant barrage of attacks from Joe Biden and the Democrat Party
Because between this shit right here and the Castro thing, she would lose Florida for Biden. Scientology is a cancer in my home state, and Castro might as well have been Satan. Older Cubans hate him like we hate 45 and they always vote.
I will vote for Biden because 45 must go
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Biden promised he was going to choose a woman as VP, if he picks Warren I would be completely surprised and disappointed. Black women have saved his candidacy, and he knows it,I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd be so stupid to pick a white VP!
Warren and Biden doing an unplanned grassroots rally starting now.  You needed to donate to get an invite, but this link may work anyway.    I'm pretty sure they're just mopping up Warren cash before announcing the VP choice next week.
What ever happened to Hunter Biden?
Democrats shouldn't burn any bridges, especially since Biden still has a cabinet to fill.
It‚Äôs just a compilation of Biden gaffes and not knowing where he is or what‚Äôs going on. Definitely President material in the eyes of the left wing
Especially, also if they support Biden.

Stop it! It is unseemly to allow Biden‚Äôs VP selection to devolve into the bashing of these women, just fucking stop it!
Joe Biden does not want to see his friends die because of his recklessness.  Poor Herman Cain would still be alive if he had not been so stupid and supportive of Trump to attend the rally.
So we should just accept joe Biden being shit and not criticize him at all cool
This year doesn't operate under normal rules. The election delay debacle will devastate Trump's numbers this week. Friday's upcoming EMPSIT will be bracing, it will give no positive headlines. No conventions to provide temporary momentum. Biden's VP dominates the news for a week.
Yeah because Biden would have made everyone hide like him in their basements.
So, John Kerry's retrospective pinning of his loss for running a shit campaign on the now-disgraced John Edwards is supposed to be our criterion for whether or not Warren or Harris is a suitable pick for Biden in 2020?  okaaaaaay.....
Does Pence think that Biden can cause the deaths of more than 150,000 Americans in just 6 months? Trump likely won't be surpassed on that record.

Pence has got to go.  Trump is desperate and needs to counter Biden with a woman for VP.  Nikki Haley has been campaigning for the job for some time.
Justin.  I told you Susan Rice would be a great pick about a month ago.  You did not agree then.  Well, now her stock is rising rapidly and you are on the bandwagon.  Welcome aboard.
This is awful for the NYT to report and for Biden to permit by members from members of his team.
Sanders, you may be able to pull the wool over Biden‚Äôs eyes but not the DNC. They got your number, you socialist politician.
Exactly what I've been saying, day in and out! There's no reason this should be happening, if not for the fact that she's 1)a woman 2)a Black Woman! It's a scary thought for them to consider something happening to Biden and a Black Woman becoming POTUS! I know that's what it is!
I have experience in law enforcement and security. I have had to look after mental patients suffering from dementia. Joe Biden is an old man who shits his pants. His crackhead son  makes him do this for the money. I have looked after so many Joe Bidens.
They should play for Florida. It also isn‚Äôt the only path, and with Bass I don‚Äôt think anybody in Florida will turn against Biden who isn‚Äôt already against him. They are dropping like flies there.

No. His choice must. Must.  Be the next president. Biden just needs to get her past the first midterms without a huge failure.
I truly believe that Joe Biden will select Kamala Harris to be his vice president. Not gonna get my Depends in a bunch while I wait.
You caught up on fake news. You don't know nothing about Biden yet you want him in office. Research Kamala Harris, slept her way to the top. Planned parenthood selling baby boy parts. That's gonna be his choice for vp.
If Biden is announcing his VP pick next week, don‚Äôt you think he has made his choice already and that person has already accepted? I don‚Äôt recall the GOP speaking out against trump‚Äôs choice of Pence. Just cuz Dems have a big tent, doesn‚Äôt warrant the airing of everyone‚Äôs opinion.
Biden for. President
Biden talks about those subjects too. Open your eyes and ears.
The Obama/ Biden wing of the Democrats are barely left of Fine Gael but I‚Äôd still have them over any Republican. Obama has always been a bit preachy.
I like Harris but I wonder if Biden has a connection with Bass who lost her daughter and son-in-law in a car accident in 2006.
wahhhh I heard lefties saying Joe Biden was the same as Trump wahhhhh. That hurt my feelings. waaahhhhh. why do they have to say these mean things waahhhhh. We need to whine about Biden and Trump for four months and talk about nothing else except your insignificant vote waaaahhhh
It‚Äôs in the tweet. But again if he wins narrowly by mail in, nothing to talk about... &amp; Biden is a Marxist now? Wildin big guy lmaooo
I'm old enough to have fully followed 3 election cycles. I watch every debate. GOP and  DNC. Biden was shoved down our throats since day 1. Hes horrible. Trump is horrible. They both represent the establishment. We have 4 choices in Nov. We need to not be afraid to split votes
She needs more political seasoning, but she brings flash and youth and vibrancy, all of which Biden really needs.  Bass reminds me of the Kaine pick.  Blah.  Still think he's going to pick Rice, so get your groan machine ready. He wants someone he can trust and he knows her best.
So ‚Äúsmart‚Äù that the ‚Äúfake‚Äù virus is killing you. Republicans lol.
It will probably take Biden at least 2 wks b4 he can move in because they will have to fumigate the place first.
Sanders, the DNC took out all of your progressive ideology from the democrat platform. They put Biden right in the middle of the road. That‚Äôs what the DNC thinks of your platform, a total sham.
Sanders, I wouldn‚Äôt count my chickens before they hatch. The polls show Biden with a lead but this race is far from being over.
This has really gotten very ugly. Didn't have to. The coordinated hit job on Kamala Harris should shame the Democratic Party. It's Biden's pick all the way, but the process has been terrible.
Biden is there.....

First part, agreed.... get rid of Democrat governors who killed tens of thousands of elderly by forcing nursing homes to take sick patients of all ages.  The last part 100% wrong. Vote Trump over the artist that used to be Biden. Get rid of Dems to stop the death tolls
No! If Biden wins, real men and real women are going to continue fighting the good fight. How you say, sack up!

Yes. It‚Äôs hard to compare it to anything. The plan is to stay alive until Biden becomes president?
What he did today at a funeral just proves to me again how evil he is. Talk about dividing the country he did it for eight years &amp; now because Biden won‚Äôt come out of his basement to speak he‚Äôs going to speak for him! Obama will disappears after Nov3rd. And buy another mansion!üñï

They needed a reason to make trump look bad and this simultaneously helps them keep Biden out of the spot light because he makes a gaffe every time he talks. Trump just can‚Äôt expose it all at once, the sheeple like you wouldn‚Äôt be able to handle it all at once.
Joe Biden will say dumb things, and offensive things; that's who he is. But he won't mean most of them, and he will apologize for the worst of them.  POTUS says dumb and offensive things and means most of them, and won't even apologize for the ones he doesn't mean.
I mean, yes, you're right.  but you support Biden.  how y'all think he's any kind of legitimate upgrade and not more of the same of the last TWENTY years... is a complete mystery to me.  different colors, same shit

Fair points. But she‚Äôs no further left than Bernie and he almost took down Hillary. And 4 more years of experience, with a ton of Oval Office experience (as I see her having a prominent role in Biden‚Äôs presidency) she might have a chance. Interesting to ponder at the very least.

And correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't believe VP Biden ever told people to ingest bleach or depended on the word of a 'doctor' who claimed alien DNA administered through sex is the cause of it all.  Oh, and witches and demons too.  And your boss fell for it.
What‚Äôs interesting is, he has all these ideas about why the youth may not vote, and doesn‚Äôt acknowledge his own role in voter suppression and ensuring Biden was the candiate. For better or worse.
I can see him going further in the final days/weeks and telling his supporters to not vote. The system and the result is delegitimized if both sides do not participate. Biden would be President, but the social contract would be in ruins.
Boy the internet makes tough guys of us all, don't it. And what the fuck does BLM have to do with Biden? You did ask me about Biden not BLM. Since you asked me an irrelevant question about Biden, why shouldn't i ask it of you?

Maybe she can find out why Biden spied on the Trump campaign. Also, what Hunter did to earn all that money in the Ukraine and China. Since she was an AG she could prosecute Biden and become president.
Agree. The support for Biden in SC showed. It's always been a issue in Black community. While the SCLC and Southern method towards the movement won out on methodology, it has shown that this approach has greatly slowed and hinder the community advancement and overall treatment.

If Biden wants a female VP, he should pick one from a state that Trump won in 2016.  Biden's VP will be pro-abortion, no matter whom he picks.   If he picks Harris, it remains to be seen if the left keeps quiet because of her record prosecuting drug offenders.

Amazing that a seasoned political journalist like Rather doesn‚Äôt have the foresight to see that the Democrats will be calling for Biden‚Äôs head on a platter a few hours after the bloodletting that will be the first Presidential debate...
Leave Obama and the Clintons out of this. Or did you mean the current shell of what used to be Joe Biden?
Why would any sane person vote for Biden? You a fan of these riots?
No worries...your savior Uncle Joe Biden is on the way .... üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
And newsflash: The US is a white supremacist state that will continue to be white supremacist with Biden as president.
This sounds like Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt vote for me you‚Äôre not black‚Äù shit yikes  Do you actually think that there are no black left wingers who have problems with Biden and the Democrats?
He died supporting Biden?
Trump is going to violate on Biden come debate time. 100 percent.
Looks like a preview of a Trump/Biden debate.
Indeed.   And why does Biden?   If the question were, Why does Sanders, I think there's actually a good answer!

Joe Biden says Trump's failure to lead is responsible for historic economic slump
I'm not a fan of either candidate. If Biden took a simple physical to show that he's okay ( mind and body), he would get so many votes. I swear, it would convince me that he's able to take office. That's a demanding job. I don't think that's asking for much
Imagine being turned white by Joseph R Biden
Biden literally said he wants to give $300 million to police that‚Äôs not what the word defunding
Oh my god lmao how is Joe Biden a leftist this is actually hilarious
It‚Äôs really time the government steps in and stops you posting these Chinese slogans. The Chinese want Biden to win the election because they can‚Äôt push around or buy Trump.
It‚Äôs like saying Joe Biden is a leftist it‚Äôs completely asinine
Sanders, your really confident of the outcome of the election. With CORRUPT Biden as your nominee, I wouldn‚Äôt start opening the champagne just yet.
Nadler, you liberal democrats have a way to twist the truth to further their own agenda. You have CORRUPT Biden as your nominee he may win the election and maybe he will lose. Stop spreading lies to help Biden with the election.
He's younger than Trump and Biden...
Is Dem opposition to the re-opening of schools a way to starve Catholic &amp; private schools out of existence?  And in a Biden presidency, expect school-choice programs to be eliminated, and charter schools to undergo slow bureaucratic strangulation...
Obama and Biden fixed America from a fixer-upper to handing Trump a GREAT COUNTRY. He destroyed it singlehandedly. Now, hurry up and leave.
yall say u cant live with the weight of saying u voted for biden... weird that ur fine w saying u didnt vote and were compliant in letting trump win again ü•¥

But they persist and my heart and prayers are for them. My vote will go to Biden.
Asking if he has ever asked anyone if they were paid to support Biden was the absolute perfect response. Because it has never happened.
With you as a running mate, Biden's odds of winning is nil.
tired of dwelling so this is my last tweet on it but the belief that only Joe Biden could beat this guy becomes more hilarious every single day

No matter how desperate you are, No you will not delay the election . If I have to go out to vote in a hasmat suit ,I‚Äôll be voting for Biden.
Great. Now do continuing claims, which are up nearly 900,000 from last week. Also, the impact of the total failure of Republican leadership to pass ANY stimulus bill as the 600 per week expires.    These fools will leave a massive depression for Biden to clean up.
I don't think anything they do or say will keep any Democrat from voting for Biden.  It will all be lies, anyway.  That's all they know how to do.  #GOPBetrayedAmerica #GOPCorruptionOverCountry #GOPComplicitTraitors
He's actually no fool. This has been the plan all along. One could only pray for a complete landslide Biden victory that couldn't possibly be challenged.
Thanks Mr. President!  Say it LOUD! Obama Unleashes on Trump Privately as He Raises $24 Million for Biden
Because there was no better opportunity for radical progress in recent US history and the Democratic party offers ... Joe Biden. A candidate and a party that doesn't support M4A‚Äîwhile the country is decimated by an epidemic. He and the DNC care only for business as usual.

Terrific interview with Joe Biden
The fellow in the article was wrong in phrasing but correct in principle; if she cannot absolutely subsume her interests to Biden‚Äôs, she doesn‚Äôt belong there. I myself did it, Bush Senior, and so forth. It must work like that. It must. And they doubt she can and that‚Äôs a problem.

all that is needed is a president that is at least DECENT to care about changing inequality, and trump isn't even that, and don't come at me talking about biden because the same can be said about him too, but at least he is willing to reform police and hasn't said disgusting shit
who said I'm a biden supporter, fuck your politics
The best I've been able to do with this uncomfortable conundrum is, figure I'd vote for Biden if I were in a swing state (I'm not), and be deeply grateful for those in swing states who refuse to do so. Someone needs to have the nerve to hang in for a less corrupt future.
Because Biden is selfish. Me Me Me Me Me.and if he tell Obama. Obama don't care .üóΩüò∑‚úå
You want "enthusiasm"? Let me give it to you:   So you better light a candle and stamp your feet for Biden and whoever he picks for VP.

Biden didn‚Äôt become more liberal lmfao what
Keep running with those weak arguments amidst this custerf*ck and Biden will edge up a couple of more points
100% committed to defeat Trump. And I will be voting for Biden this November to take back our country.
I believe Sen Harris would better serve a Biden Administration as #AG than #VP.  would help the #campaign #Georgia and be helpful to his Administration
I see Biden is leading in Texas...wow...that shows how bad Trump is
Just a thought about these inane reports about Biden allies objecting to the possibility of Harris as VP because she's not "loyal" enough to Biden - seems to me to be one (of countless) problem w/ Trump admin -- a little too much loyalty - f*k that! #TeamofRivals

I‚Äôm ok if for the next 3 months Biden only speaks directly to the middle who keep swinging back and forth. I can be ignored.

If she had a fully functioning moral compass would get excited. Biden doesn't need someone with the same issues he has. He/we need someone who isn't vested in the military industrial complex and an unwavering supporter of #ApartheidIsrael. She talks out of both sides of her mouth
When your racist ass move turns others into antiracists :) I wonder if Joe Biden's education secretary will make it core curriculum...
Could all be Kabuki to make Biden seem tough and buck the establishment wing of the party. Who knows, but those arguments are ridiculous.
You can look at Biden and still make that comment about Trump?  #TDS
hahaha...she is a lot like Biden which is why I don't like her.
Only if Biden wins. She will have to be carried out if Trump wins. No way she retires.

Nope, that won't work, our military is a very strong supporter of Trump, on the other hand, Obama and Biden are strongly disliked (vert strongly)
And she earned that by lacing into Biden at the Democratic debate on the issue of school busing and integration! Why wouldn‚Äôt he pick her, considering how short term his memory is! üòÇ
Biden is 78. He doesn't have it in him to do a potential 2nd term. Harris SHOULD be thinking about doing that 2nd term.
Cops who are kicked to the curb won‚Äôt vote for Biden. The Democrats have managed to turn every cop in America into a Trump supporter. The Democrats have made their bed with the Antifa and BLM crowd, and the cop unions aren‚Äôt in that club.
Look out! She can be the next next president. If and I‚Äôm scared even thinking about it...Biden picks her and they do the old shuffle off to buffalo to Joe, she is president. FUCKIN YIKES!!!! LET GO TRUMP! 2020
Anyone notice the inappropriate smile? Is it just me or has anyone noticed he has it all the time? Not a good sign.  so when he is told we will be bombed next week, Biden‚Äôs going to smile and say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry we‚Äôll get through it?‚Äù

Of course, the Eagleton bombshell was largely a result of the Democratic establishment basically sticking it to McGovern, so he had to resort to his 11th choice or something, so that's not so likely now. I doubt that anyone on the "A"list would turn Biden down if he really wanted
She would never, ever do that. Not in a million years. I can‚Äôt believe anybody thinks she would, they don‚Äôt know a damned thing about her.
It‚Äôs disgusting. Everyone in the race took a shot at joe at one point or another. They were running for President!  He‚Äôs not petty enough to hold a grudge, if they really respect him they should know that. I sure do.
This can be read two ways. Either they believe the Presidency is not going to go their way and are desperately gonna try to flip senate instead or they believe presidency is in the bag for Biden and they will now try and flip senate as well.
The Trump campaign, meanwhile, quickly praised the endorsement as more proof that he‚Äôs the ‚Äúlaw and order‚Äù commander-in-chief while simultaneously attacking Biden as powerless to shore up Democrats.
Larry, why do you/they believe this is a positive sign for Trump? It can also be read as these lowlife scum believing Presidential election is in the bag for Biden so they're gonna spread the money around, no?
There was a reason Trump was so afraid to run against Biden that he turned to Ukraine and China for help.
Biden is highly risk averse-this is his safest option. It's only to be able to pose that they are taking the black &amp; progressive vote seriously, not to substantively take it seriously-the alternative being Trump they pretty much take the progressive vote for granted.
I thought that their main priority would be picking a VP who would be prepared to automatically step into the role of president if something should happen to almost 80-yr old Biden? Screw this racially charged misogyny.
I get the feeling that this is synthetic drama to make the announcement of Harris be a "surprise" and to portray it as Biden mending fences with "the left"
OTOH reading this article, I get the impression it's a stalking-horse kind of leak. It builds the "drama" that the establishment is pushing against Harris, so that when Biden chooses her, it's an olive branch to"the left"etc. Trying to neutralize the actual left's critique of her
But let‚Äôs inject disinfectants - or shine light in or thru the body - my favorite is ‚Äúthere are 15 cases of COVID 19 there will soon be zero‚Äù   4 million cases - 150 ,000 dead - and Usay and Uday are worried about Joe Biden.
But sure, let's talk about Biden
I'm with you on both aspects of this. She would actually be better situated to primary Biden as a sitting Senator in her second term, some accomplishments, etc. Less dangerous as VP
This look ridiculous.  was  taken away from the reporters. His handlers are afraid that biden would say something stupid from his dementia mind. Who would vote for someone like this. Biden is not ok. He is being taken back to his brainwashing basement where he belongs.
Your assumption that multiple generations won‚Äôt suffer because of Biden is blatantly ignorant of every single democratic administration in modern US history. It‚Äôs like watching Charlie Brown try to kick the football. Hey Charlie, when will you learn?
Even funnier as I distinctly remember reports that Obama picked Biden partially because, at 74, he would be far too old to run to succeed him in 2016
And then, the wonderful October Surprise that Trump's people have for Biden + the debates where Biden will forget where he is in ATLEAST one of them.   If you thought 2016 was a blunder, 2020 is going to make it look like a roaring success.
That's one head of hair Biden never sniffed.

My ideal would be more likely in a Warren presidency-full FDR like transformation (I lived thru 1980 when the transformation was the opposite direction) with Biden, I hope for earnest credibility that delegitimizes the GOP &amp; sets up bigger DEM majorities &amp; change down the road.

‚ÄúUm, Biden is senile!‚Äù  (That‚Äôs a particularly fun one coming from Reagan/Trump supporters, isn‚Äôt it?)
I was totally behind Don Jr 's dad but in my opinion, he hasn't handled the pandemic properly. I'm sure he wishes he had a reboot because he's capable of more. As for Biden, I have no confidence in him whatsoever and videos like this are self-explanatory. Prez needs to fix things
Biden already has, long ago.

Who are you to label everyone who disagrees with you a white man? Are you arguing that no women or men of color have any problems with Biden? The guy who wrote the crime bill?
Nobel prize just for getting elected.   Popular vote means nothing.   Impeachment was a joke.  As to sex assault, see toothless joe Biden on that.  I hate Trump though.
Not relevant compared to the alternative.  Biden is dementia-ridden.
Whose twitter game is worse than this? Ever time I read a Biden tweet, I fear Trump will be re-elected
You won‚Äôt even acknowledge how Biden‚Äôs son had the privilege of not being put in jail for committing a crime that would have sent black men to jail for the exact same thing, based on his father‚Äôs own laws that he wrote.
So when it‚Äôs Hunter Biden smoking crack it‚Äôs a pretend crime? What about the countless black people who have been thrown in jail for the same thing? Is it a pretend crime for them? Biden wrote laws to make drug crimes get more serious charges. Not so sure Joe thinks it‚Äôs pretend
Are you claiming that Hunter Biden didn‚Äôt get caught smoking crack?
At an insane rate. To Biden, the laws he wrote don‚Äôt apply to his own son. Hunter would be in prison but he‚Äôs a Biden. Think of how many black people were locked up Biden‚Äôs policies for smoking crack like Hunter
Oh my god you‚Äôre the one who brought up Trump‚Äôs kids. We don‚Äôt like that either. We‚Äôre trying to point out that Biden protected his son from drug charges because of his political privilege, while at the same time Biden wrote the crime bill which locks away black kids for weed

I‚Äôm also worried that even if Biden does win. Will that malicious human shaped buffalo wing even leave office but that‚Äôs a whole other thing. To stay focused, I‚Äôm really concerned with the energy behind his campaign and around him in general.
Because Biden though the lesser of two evils doesn‚Äôt seem to wholly grasp the urgency of these protests and isn‚Äôt the disruption to the status quo I think a lot of us wanted.
When I read the headline the issue of gender didn‚Äôt come to mind. My interpretation was: ‚ÄúBiden is a man; Trump has the mentality of an immature child, and Americans are sick of it.‚Äù
I‚Äôm not voting for Biden because he‚Äôs the pinnacle of what our president should be. I don‚Äôt agree with that man. Fuck Biden. But there ain‚Äôt no third choice and I‚Äôm not letting that bastard Trump win again.
Let‚Äôs relax now because Biden also said Trump is the first racist president this country has ever had. That man isn‚Äôt a president we want, he‚Äôs our only choice other than Trump.
On the Kamala might be Biden‚Äôs running mate topic, if you zoom in on the last point on his list I swear his pen is half covering the word Black. As in shes Black and that‚Äôs a point he can benefit from.   I‚Äôm going to be sick I hate this country so much.
Neither. Trump would cage them on the border, and Biden would team up with Dr. Jill and charm them to the point that they would consider coming back with me!
Trump started this but this is happening in a democratic state make no mistake Biden will change nothing it's all optics
What's the point of that optics? you swap Biden for Trump you get the guy that wrote the crime bill and patriot act, a segregationist who's blueprints Trump uses today
So you won‚Äôt vote for Biden either then

They clearly don't believe it, with all the handwringing moderates claiming that Joe Biden‚ÄîJHFC‚Äîis our "only hope" to "save America." Dems don't want to win. They just want to keep collecting fat salaries and do nothing for the American people, while pretending to oppose the GOP.

Biden and all responsible politicians should be telling people not to send their kids to school unless the conditions have totally improved. What is the govt. going to do?
every week it harder for me to believe a Biden administration could be moved on issues by any public pressure

Stay the course! Vote for Biden! If he doesn‚Äôt get in, this country is finished and so are all your hopes and dreams.
Biden calling for anarchists to be arrested is exactly why we all need to stand together. They don‚Äôt give a shit what leftist sub group you identify with. We‚Äôre all anarchist Marxists to them and we‚Äôre next.Would it not be wise for Biden to pick someone ambitious who can keep going after his administration? Is he realistically going to serve two terms?
i don't want them to be able to replace him; besides, who the hell would want to run now with it so late &amp; Biden looking like a shoo-in.
You‚Äôre black when it‚Äôs convient and we aren‚Äôt doing the same thing over and over. You are, you‚Äôre voting for Biden no matter what. That‚Äôs insanity
We are now but fake allies like yourself always coming in trying to undermine our demands and saying if we don‚Äôt vote for Biden then we must be pro Trump! Right now we don‚Äôt want to hear from y‚Äôall! We‚Äôre shaking the political landscape, move aside or get rolled over
Dont be stupid..vote for Biden. As a Canadian your vote impacts us. And I've never been so scared to watch your election.. I had no idea your president could impact us so much till trump came. And that's not a good thing. Lets get back to getting along which we cant do with trump
No dought, Biden is incompetent.
I know right?  Biden is a crazy looney
Biden said if you want Medicare for All, Green new deal ect... to vote for someone else.  I'm voting Green like EVERYONE SHOULD.
Hahahahaha it‚Äôs going know where you‚Äôve bowed out of the election twice you should have no say at all .. can you utterly ensure the safety of all Americans voting!! Go hide in the basement with BIDEN !!
... again, Trump gives Biden the perfect campaign ad.
I sincerely hope President Biden orders a thorough investigation into FEMA.  Their top guys should look pretty good in orange, don't you think?
For a country where we have freedom of speech there sure are a lot of assholes that jump down your throat when you say you hate trump and biden. People are so quick to judge and jump down your throat for opinions
He didn't say no because Google is helping Biden, along with much of social media.
is this a hoax from the Biden campaign or is this really from tyt? Please let us know as many friends are so upset and cancelling memberships.
is this seriously from you guys or did the Biden campaign try to pretend to be you? A lot of friends are cancelling memberships over this. Before I do I wanted to check if its true? Please address this as countless people are leaving tyt
Trying to connect the dots between people voting for Biden who also say Kamala Harris's record as a DA and AG disqualify her for VP.
QUESTION: Are you really white? If so, why do you degrade blacks by trying to be their voice. Why do you think that blacks are incapable of speaking for themselves?  I guess "you ain't black" biden and yourself have something in common.  #raciststaci

Remember, if you don't vote Biden you're not black. And if you do vote Biden your a pedophile.
Biden is answering question from the media! As he calls out the selected media with their approved line of questions. Great tactic, but I see threw this BS!

Can't wait for Biden's response to Trump's law and order strategy to be bragging about the crime bill, deportations and drone strikes as they try desperately to appeal to people that will never vote for them...and then blame the left for being divisive when we point it out.
"I'm not Trump, now leave me alone"  After 5 decades fucking Americans, that's  presidential strategy.  Pathetic.
Since Fetch the Bolt Cutters came out!  Didn‚Äôt take you as a Fiona Apple fan, Biden!

I love when reporters claim there‚Äôs no enthusiasm for Biden. Maybe not, but we‚Äôre sure as hell fired up about 45 &amp; that is why Dems &amp; others will vote in numbers too overwhelming to be denied this time. Do it for freedom, do it for John. Lewis.
Pelosi can‚Äôt handle the press any better then Biden. She gets very snappy and snarky! What a witch!
Hell, I would vote for Joe Biden ESPECIALLY if he shot Trump on 5th Avenue!
Iknow some people are saying people who would vote for Biden would vote for ye instead, makeing the votes decided then Trump keeps his and he'll win. Not my statement just one in hearing that I can wrap the idea around my head
Telling how he only sees Biden as an oppnonent
Canadians would love to see our American neighbors have what we have. I get that your healthcare and insurance is all about profit, but this is 2020. So many other countries are like us, even very poor ones. Hopefully Biden can do it. üá®üá¶üò∑üá∫üá∏

You should go back to school.  Biden is going to crush the orange man
Shouldn't he be thanked however for pushing Biden more to the left? I know Biden wasn't nearly as liberal when he first started running. And they signed that mandate together
It‚Äôs Biden‚Äôs race to blow.  He just needs to keep it togather until November.  Stay home.

Joe Biden does not want to see his friends die because of his recklessness.  Poor Herman Cain would still be alive if he had not been so stupid and supportive of Trump to attend the rally.
Either is Joe Biden..
I have experience in law enforcement and security. I have had to look after mental patients suffering from dementia. Joe Biden is an old man who shits his pants. His crackhead son  makes him do this for the money. I have looked after so many Joe Bidens.
She needs more political seasoning, but she brings flash and youth and vibrancy, all of which Biden really needs.  Bass reminds me of the Kaine pick.  Blah.  Still think he's going to pick Rice, so get your groan machine ready. He wants someone he can trust and he knows her best.
Well I bet you are PERFECT?Look Biden was a life long leech &amp; sold his VP seat to China &amp; Ukraine. Had the money redirected through his son and his family O you can‚Äôt believe thatüôÑHe &amp; Obama had 8 yrs of nothing. But you will vote for that crook. Fruit Cakeü§™Trump ran a company!
Biden &amp; Warren sounds like a comedy act, oh wait, it actually is.

Can any creepy Joe biden supporters show me videos of his crowds and lines to get in????
Looking pretty orange there, Joe.
I‚Äôm having a Biden vote put in my will!
Should be easier this year because Biden is presumably not painting a fleet of campaign planes and buses.
Lol. The LONGEST STREAK OF POSITIVE JOB CREATION IN HISTORY began in the Obama/Biden Administration and Crashed and Burned in Trump's.
I think trumps gonna win because I think in a debate he is gonma kill biden. They are both old and stupid and losing their minds but one of them is atleast used to shouting names. I also don't think huge predictions can be made until we see them both on stage.
Besides, it's not like this isn't something enough people haven't seen coming from way off before today, or even April when Biden said it.
Putin won't need to, Biden will let the "PEACEFUL PROTESTORS" do it.

I'm expecting (or hoping for) a paddy wagon next to the stage during Biden's inauguration. Though, Trump may already be on a plane to Russia by then.
I was showing the comparison of the same poll that showed a small lead then for Clinton and is now showing a much larger lead for Biden. Trump doesn‚Äôt have Wikileaks through Roger Stone to hack DNC emails. Oh and it‚Äôs no theory.

BLM Gives Their Donations To White Men - Joe Biden  via
I wonder how many of these articles are accurately reflecting what happened.  That type of leak doesn't help Biden or Harris.  I compare it to draft rumors before the NFL draft.  Then again, Dodd is a type of idiot who might have said something like that.
It's either to try to sandbag her, or to generate buzz and make Biden look better when he picks her.
I see Biden is leading in Texas...wow...that shows how bad Trump is
Just a thought about these inane reports about Biden allies objecting to the possibility of Harris as VP because she's not "loyal" enough to Biden - seems to me to be one (of countless) problem w/ Trump admin -- a little too much loyalty - f*k that! #TeamofRivals
Nope, that won't work, our military is a very strong supporter of Trump, on the other hand, Obama and Biden are strongly disliked (vert strongly)
Joe Biden said that illegal immigrants are more American, than Americans !! Makes no sense?? This idiot took money from China, Ukraine, Iraq and Iran?? Mr AG Barr go after this moron who committed Treason, he has a slight chance of becoming president!!!
Whatever. The President sets the policy agenda, the Vice President has input as other senior staff also do. Once the president has decided, the VP‚Äôs job is to support and advocate for the president‚Äôs agenda.   You should know all this. And also that Biden does not favor M4A.
She would never, ever do that. Not in a million years. I can‚Äôt believe anybody thinks she would, they don‚Äôt know a damned thing about her.
It‚Äôs disgusting. Everyone in the race took a shot at joe at one point or another. They were running for President!  He‚Äôs not petty enough to hold a grudge, if they really respect him they should know that. I sure do.
I thought that their main priority would be picking a VP who would be prepared to automatically step into the role of president if something should happen to almost 80-yr old Biden? Screw this racially charged misogyny.
I'd have no problem seeing the FDA dismantled.   And did you hear Biden yesterday?  His last statement was "We have to overcome people who won't take the vaccine, and not just the usual anti-vax crowd."
In fairness, no one but real heds care about the DNC, which is a compliment but also something that is better writ large for Biden
‚ÄúUm, Biden is senile!‚Äù  (That‚Äôs a particularly fun one coming from Reagan/Trump supporters, isn‚Äôt it?)
Makes sense.  Good thing Barr has said publicly, multiple times, that no current candidate for office is within the scope of his investigations.  So Biden isn't a target.  Everyone else is fair game.
Biden already has, long ago.
Sure Joe Biden spent 36 years in the Senate, 8 years in the White House, and has been a Catholic his whole life, but in all that time what has he ever done about incubuses and succubi causing medical conditions? NOTHING, that‚Äôs what! (I hate 2020.)
All of them would be so much better than Trump or Biden

Bernie campaign cochair uses graphic metaphor to explain Biden vote - Business Insider
Biden was not taking questions. He had the questions beforehand and was calling on specific people to ask the question he had the answers to in his notes.  Biden is a total farce!
"Not a chance Biden will crush Trump in a debate."  FIFY.
I‚Äôm sure they have it, and it shows Biden over 85% and they just don‚Äôt want to go there.
This dope makes Biden seem cognizant
I‚Äôm amazed people don‚Äôt believe polls. They were accurate in 2016. On Election Day the polls had Hillary getting 3 million more votes. She did. ABC/Wapo Poll July 2016, Clinton 47%, Trump 43% - 2020 same poll July 2020 Biden 55%, Trump 40%....He‚Äôs in big trouble!
What CRAP!  prearranged questions! This by itself should stop anyone for voting for Biden,
Btw: Rasmussen has his approval at 45% (disapproval 54%) today. National Average Election Poll is Biden by 9%
I am watching Biden taking questions in Wilmington, its a total joke, questions are prom a prepared list of people. If this idiot gets away with this we are doomed.
More self-serving BS from Moron Joe Biden. Watching Biden in Wilmington now, what a joke. He takes questions from people using a prepared list, anyone believe this crap? I dont.
Oh...did I miss something? Joe Biden is president?
Joe Biden could take a double decker sh** in my mouth and I would still vote for him.
In their world, Joe Biden is already President.
Biden isn't the president of the United States yet
Bet she just wants to dig up the garden and leave it for Biden to fix it. What a waste of time during a pandemic. And, the garden is used for conferences. Melania is by far the stupidest First Lady in US history who gets a lifetime pension from the tax payers.
Believe Biden laying low in the middle of the Trump  virus - also not fair to expose a leader who is already demonstrating signs of dementia - coincidentally his father died  as a result of the disease but I assume you were ignorant of this  fact.
China will work to get Biden elected. I hope they succeed!
why is MN trending away from Biden? Because residents are fed up with all the "peaceful" protests that your network keeps championing. They are also fed up with your defund the police push. Wake up.
Biden will be used as a puppet, he will make no decisions. We have socialised hospitals back in Ireland where I was born. You die on a waiting list if you need an operation. just like Russia.
Well Tucker carlson would have been one of the preppie guys in high school that called long haired guys like me asnd my friends burnoutts back in the 90s. But Joe Biden is still senile and weird and wants to grab our daughters asses.

Chris Dodd should not be vetting Biden's VP candidates.  At all.

Under the Obama administration foe which Biden was part of, this happened.  The NSA was allowed to collect meta-data thru our phone carriers. The Utah Data Center was constructed. They allowed a covert CIA operation to train and arm the Islamic State in Syria.
They are of the same system. Biden is not changing anything for you, me or anyone else outside of the affluent folk. Our foreign policy will still be a detriment for this country, the Federal Reserve banks will still gouge us, and our economy is still tanking.

There's no formal application. Either you're a Putin loving bernie bro or a proud, Biden/Bush loving white woman of color.
Biden is a scummy old neolib who stands for nothing. Trump is a crypto-fascist who wants to do away with LGBT rights and crush the left. Voting Biden does 2 things. A) Harm Reduction B) puts a leader in charge who‚Äôs less likely to arrest us &amp; more likely to give in to our demands
I have to simply smirk at the conclusion some people are making, that with Biden president, anything is changing for the better here or abroad. You are simply in denial.
My personal favourite Michael Moore Moment was that time, after the SC Primary,  he went on stage at a Bernie rally and said 'Joe Biden waited 32 years to win his FIRST Primary. He will NOT win another one'.
I respect Duckworth. But - I think it will be very difficult for Biden to choose anyone other than a Black woman after he said four were being considered.  ‚ÄúNot even one of them was good enough?‚Äù will be the question that will be asked.
She isn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs exactly why Biden should choose her. We didn‚Äôt vote for a socialist to be our nominee and we don‚Äôt need one on the ticket at all.
Calling the Democrats 'The Party of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ' is absurd. If it was, Bernie Sanders would be the nominee, not Biden.
Joe Biden was part of a previous administration whom helped to kill tens of thousands in the Middle East with unrelenting drone strikes, while also funding and training the Islamic State in Syria thru the CIA in 2012.   But yeah, he "cares".

Let‚Äôs make that clear for the ones in the back... ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt even be president if it wasn‚Äôt for them‚Äù PURE FACTS. How does anyone expect the souless joe Biden to beat trumpü§îü§£
Joe Biden is not a candidate, candidates choose a running mate.
Yes I do. I believe there will be massive turnout on both sides, in every state - not just Florida. And Biden will get 8 out of 10 swing voters and win just about every battleground state. Incumbent presidents don‚Äôt lose often but they lose big when they do. I expect a landslide.
Well thats why your worried now, when its happening to you. Voting Biden isnt changing anything.
Biden doesn‚Äôt have to win Florida, but it will ensure victory if he does.  Between Trump and his lapdog De Santis they have screwed things up royally in the state. Hard for me to imagine Trump holding on to it now. I assume most voters are aware of when they‚Äôve been f*cked over.
Look at our options? In actuality, we have no options. I find it odd that Joe Biden has not picked a running mate this close to the November 3 election. I just feel like everybody‚Äôs telling us a lie. None of them live in the same world as we do.
Biden will save us from Trump's America.  #TrumpIsACompleteFailure #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #TrumpGestapo #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica

Biden, Trump.....doesnt matter, nothing will change for the better....democracy has long been a dead ideal, women will still be disrespected, and the country is slowly becoming dumber, hungrier and more dependent on the federal government.
Fact Check | Whopper of a Trump ad falsely suggests Biden supports "defunding" police  (not to mention that Defund is not anything like Abolish, if you study the movement)
St. Pete‚Äôs had it 51-46 Biden, also out today. They may have pushed leaners harder than Q did.   I think Biden wins Florida by 4-6 points. He‚Äôs a perfect candidate for the state and trump and de Santis have both screwed up royally.
I don‚Äôt think Biden wins Florida by more than 5 in the end. But he will win it - and that‚Äôs the ballgame!
The Biden for President campaign invites you to a conversation on how to restore the soul of America's workplaces with the women who once led the "Big 3" #CivilRights agencies responsible for protecting workers against discrimination and promoting diversity in employment.

94 days until Election Day. Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt want to have any debates. How can you vote for someone if you don‚Äôt know what he stands for? He only helped himself and his family for the past few decades. He pressured Ukraine into dropping charges on his corrupt son. Vote Red
When will Biden speak up against the senseless killings that have been going on by the anarchists! That are not being talked about and these people lives also matter!!

I think this VP choice is most impactful because if Biden does only run for a single term the VP is going to probably be the de facto Nominee in 2024.
(Yesterday) Biden is supportive of something called #BLACKlivesMatter AND has vowed to pick a woman running mate and likely a Black one for political reasons, rather than just picking the best person, and he says Trump is divisive? Yeah. Ok. YK

But all of that ends November 3rd. Once Trump is gone, there is no excuse. It would be irresponsible to let Biden run the status quo and disillusion people who were convinced that Dems were the answer and their lives didn't improve. That's the real danger.
But, that also requires acknowledging the weaknesses and flaws of who we elect. Biden literally spent his first few decades in congress propping up segregationists. I don't trust him. But if he's going to be the guy i'm going to be on his ass keeping him correct.
Biden won a majority of old people. When you go by age democraphics, you see the same split in ideology regardless of color. people under 45 largely are more progressive and less likely to support neoliberals like Biden

I don‚Äôt support defunding the police. Neither does Brindisi. Neither does Joe Biden.  Claudia has spread misinformation about their positions on that front, and she should have to answer for that.
In VP search, Biden has a known quantity in Susan Rice
Joe Biden has never said that he wants to defund the police, in fact, he has said the opposite. That ad is terribly misleading and also an effort to scare people into voting Republican. Tell the truth.

The frustration for me is how happy the DNC will be if Biden wins, not because they actually care about getting Trump out of office but, because of the perception that left voters ‚Äúfell in line‚Äù behind their garbage candidate. It‚Äôs infuriating.
It took Trump 6 months and a 20 point do in polls to acknowledge everyone should be wearing masks and that this pandemic will get worse. You really can't attack Bidens cognitive abilities when the guy you support is significantly worse than your portrayal of Biden üòÇüòÇThis guys still claiming Biden wants to defund / disband police, meanwhile he was proven to be lying about that on freakin Fox News, and he‚Äôs still out here lying about that to his racist fuck followers
Given the current alternative I would so choose Biden over a wannabe dictator.  As for the Republicans what active policies have they set forth to benefit the African/Black American constituency since Eisenhower?
So? Are you under the impression that Biden hasn‚Äôt already made his choice? Like 3 months ago?

Democrats shouldn't burn any bridges, especially since Biden still has a cabinet to fill.
It‚Äôs just a compilation of Biden gaffes and not knowing where he is or what‚Äôs going on. Definitely President material in the eyes of the left wing

Joe Biden does not want to see his friends die because of his recklessness.  Poor Herman Cain would still be alive if he had not been so stupid and supportive of Trump to attend the rally.
So we should just accept joe Biden being shit and not criticize him at all cool
This year doesn't operate under normal rules. The election delay debacle will devastate Trump's numbers this week. Friday's upcoming EMPSIT will be bracing, it will give no positive headlines. No conventions to provide temporary momentum. Biden's VP dominates the news for a week.
So, John Kerry's retrospective pinning of his loss for running a shit campaign on the now-disgraced John Edwards is supposed to be our criterion for whether or not Warren or Harris is a suitable pick for Biden in 2020?  okaaaaaay.....
Does Pence think that Biden can cause the deaths of more than 150,000 Americans in just 6 months? Trump likely won't be surpassed on that record.
Pence has got to go.  Trump is desperate and needs to counter Biden with a woman for VP.  Nikki Haley has been campaigning for the job for some time.
Justin.  I told you Susan Rice would be a great pick about a month ago.  You did not agree then.  Well, now her stock is rising rapidly and you are on the bandwagon.  Welcome aboard.
This is awful for the NYT to report and for Biden to permit by members from members of his team.
Exactly what I've been saying, day in and out! There's no reason this should be happening, if not for the fact that she's 1)a woman 2)a Black Woman! It's a scary thought for them to consider something happening to Biden and a Black Woman becoming POTUS! I know that's what it is!

No. His choice must. Must.  Be the next president. Biden just needs to get her past the first midterms without a huge failure.
I truly believe that Joe Biden will select Kamala Harris to be his vice president. Not gonna get my Depends in a bunch while I wait.
You caught up on fake news. You don't know nothing about Biden yet you want him in office. Research Kamala Harris, slept her way to the top. Planned parenthood selling baby boy parts. That's gonna be his choice for vp.
If Biden is announcing his VP pick next week, don‚Äôt you think he has made his choice already and that person has already accepted? I don‚Äôt recall the GOP speaking out against trump‚Äôs choice of Pence. Just cuz Dems have a big tent, doesn‚Äôt warrant the airing of everyone‚Äôs opinion.
Biden for. President
Biden talks about those subjects too. Open your eyes and ears.
The Obama/ Biden wing of the Democrats are barely left of Fine Gael but I‚Äôd still have them over any Republican. Obama has always been a bit preachy.
I like Harris but I wonder if Biden has a connection with Bass who lost her daughter and son-in-law in a car accident in 2006.
It‚Äôs in the tweet. But again if he wins narrowly by mail in, nothing to talk about... &amp; Biden is a Marxist now? Wildin big guy lmaooo
I'm old enough to have fully followed 3 election cycles. I watch every debate. GOP and  DNC. Biden was shoved down our throats since day 1. Hes horrible. Trump is horrible. They both represent the establishment. We have 4 choices in Nov. We need to not be afraid to split votes
So ‚Äúsmart‚Äù that the ‚Äúfake‚Äù virus is killing you. Republicans lol.
It will probably take Biden at least 2 wks b4 he can move in because they will have to fumigate the place first.
This has really gotten very ugly. Didn't have to. The coordinated hit job on Kamala Harris should shame the Democratic Party. It's Biden's pick all the way, but the process has been terrible.

They needed a reason to make trump look bad and this simultaneously helps them keep Biden out of the spot light because he makes a gaffe every time he talks. Trump just can‚Äôt expose it all at once, the sheeple like you wouldn‚Äôt be able to handle it all at once.
Joe Biden will say dumb things, and offensive things; that's who he is. But he won't mean most of them, and he will apologize for the worst of them.  POTUS says dumb and offensive things and means most of them, and won't even apologize for the ones he doesn't mean.
I mean, yes, you're right.  but you support Biden.  how y'all think he's any kind of legitimate upgrade and not more of the same of the last TWENTY years... is a complete mystery to me.  different colors, same shit

Fair points. But she‚Äôs no further left than Bernie and he almost took down Hillary. And 4 more years of experience, with a ton of Oval Office experience (as I see her having a prominent role in Biden‚Äôs presidency) she might have a chance. Interesting to ponder at the very least.
All of your tweets are irrelevant and pointless, just like your life. I voted for Hilary Clinton &amp; I'm going to vote for Joe Biden. You belong in prison.

What‚Äôs interesting is, he has all these ideas about why the youth may not vote, and doesn‚Äôt acknowledge his own role in voter suppression and ensuring Biden was the candiate. For better or worse.
I can see him going further in the final days/weeks and telling his supporters to not vote. The system and the result is delegitimized if both sides do not participate. Biden would be President, but the social contract would be in ruins.
People get butt hurt on the internet too fast and that‚Äôs coming from someone who doesn‚Äôt give a damn about either side but I won‚Äôt vote for Biden this election since I don‚Äôt vote for socialist communist so thump it is
Asking Biden to support policies that will help poor people survive isn‚Äôt disrespecting Biden voters, but asking for Ryan‚Äôs birth certificate to prove he‚Äôs American certainly is

Agree. The support for Biden in SC showed. It's always been a issue in Black community. While the SCLC and Southern method towards the movement won out on methodology, it has shown that this approach has greatly slowed and hinder the community advancement and overall treatment.
lets wait and see. he still seems to be ignoring the concerns of chicagoans regarding his library, and he played a big role in making biden the nom. one speech w no action &amp; nothing on the line for him doesn't change much
Is that Hunter Biden on Crack ?
If Biden wants a female VP, he should pick one from a state that Trump won in 2016.  Biden's VP will be pro-abortion, no matter whom he picks.   If he picks Harris, it remains to be seen if the left keeps quiet because of her record prosecuting drug offenders.
Clinton &amp; Biden have a legacy of destroying black families that won't be forgotten. I won't be co-opted to vote for a bigot with cognitive issues who isn't even pretending to care while DNC leadership dines off a system built with blood money. #BlackLivesMatter #leftisbest

Of course, the Eagleton bombshell was largely a result of the Democratic establishment basically sticking it to McGovern, so he had to resort to his 11th choice or something, so that's not so likely now. I doubt that anyone on the "A"list would turn Biden down if he really wanted
This can be read two ways. Either they believe the Presidency is not going to go their way and are desperately gonna try to flip senate instead or they believe presidency is in the bag for Biden and they will now try and flip senate as well.
The Trump campaign, meanwhile, quickly praised the endorsement as more proof that he‚Äôs the ‚Äúlaw and order‚Äù commander-in-chief while simultaneously attacking Biden as powerless to shore up Democrats.
Larry, why do you/they believe this is a positive sign for Trump? It can also be read as these lowlife scum believing Presidential election is in the bag for Biden so they're gonna spread the money around, no?
There was a reason Trump was so afraid to run against Biden that he turned to Ukraine and China for help.
Biden is highly risk averse-this is his safest option. It's only to be able to pose that they are taking the black &amp; progressive vote seriously, not to substantively take it seriously-the alternative being Trump they pretty much take the progressive vote for granted.
I get the feeling that this is synthetic drama to make the announcement of Harris be a "surprise" and to portray it as Biden mending fences with "the left"
OTOH reading this article, I get the impression it's a stalking-horse kind of leak. It builds the "drama" that the establishment is pushing against Harris, so that when Biden chooses her, it's an olive branch to"the left"etc. Trying to neutralize the actual left's critique of her

I'm with you on both aspects of this. She would actually be better situated to primary Biden as a sitting Senator in her second term, some accomplishments, etc. Less dangerous as VP
This look ridiculous.  was  taken away from the reporters. His handlers are afraid that biden would say something stupid from his dementia mind. Who would vote for someone like this. Biden is not ok. He is being taken back to his brainwashing basement where he belongs.

At an insane rate. To Biden, the laws he wrote don‚Äôt apply to his own son. Hunter would be in prison but he‚Äôs a Biden. Think of how many black people were locked up Biden‚Äôs policies for smoking crack like Hunter
Oh my god you‚Äôre the one who brought up Trump‚Äôs kids. We don‚Äôt like that either. We‚Äôre trying to point out that Biden protected his son from drug charges because of his political privilege, while at the same time Biden wrote the crime bill which locks away black kids for weed
Damn you‚Äôre really here caping for the Biden family and refusing to read

Sure Joe Biden spent 36 years in the Senate, 8 years in the White House, and has been a Catholic his whole life, but in all that time what has he ever done about incubuses and succubi causing medical conditions? NOTHING, that‚Äôs what! (I hate 2020.)
Joe Biden be saying nothing smh
Except Biden DOES NOT support defunding the police.  Get your facts straight.
Ahhh how could this be America under Biden when it is literally happening right now under Trump ?  üò≥üò≥üò≥üò≥üò≥üò≥
He‚Äôs probably thinking he wont lose any of his racist base if Biden chooses a black woman as VP.

Trump has lost his economic edge over BidenIf you have any influence on Biden, please advise him to cut back on the old white dudes and start listening to a more diverse group of folks. And I‚Äôm an old white lady...

Surprised you had the time since Barr/Durham are so committed to the delegitimization of Russian Investigation, building a bogus case vs the Biden‚Äôs, &amp; sending stormtroopers to create election photo ops for the most corrupt man to ever inhabit the WH.
Taxes were 4 years ago, before Biden running, so that has no relevance. Trump didn‚Äôt even show up to testify or provide evidence at his own impeachment... and god knows he‚Äôs done worse than Biden and Kav combined. The only weak one is you, blindly following a dictator-wannabe

DNC: *coups the primary for Biden* Also the DNC: hey this Biden guy might be problematic
I am having an honest conversation about him. He is fit for office, and you should stop saying that he is not. You are not helping in anyway with that kind of rhetoric. Biden is absolutely fit for office. Trump is not fit for office.
Do you think not cutting down your candidate means that you are delusional? I believe that focusing on the real problem is what we should be doing. Biden is not the problem. Trump is. Maybe focus on why we should be voting for Biden and what is good about him.
You: ‚ÄúBiden is clearly unfit..‚Äù  Me: You should stop shitting all over our candidate  You: Who said I was shitting on Biden? I didn‚Äôt do that.
It has everything to do with what you are saying. You‚Äôre basically punching yourself in the face to cut Biden down, because it makes you feel like you know better. We have enough of a challenge getting out the vote, without you throwing rocks at our candidate.
I can just feel it.If Biden isn‚Äôt crushing now, while the virus is hitting us hard, we fucked. What is wrong with America?
If you can‚Äôt tell the difference between Trump and Biden, you are beyond help.   P.S. It‚Äôs also no one‚Äôs job to show you facts that are clearly available.

I do t care about Biden and what he thinks. You need to be defensive. Expose Fauci for his insider pharm stock trading, being controlled by crazy Bill Gates, Wuhan Lab funding, lying about the virus, lying about benefits of HCQ &amp; owning vaccine patents. Treason against the ppl.
Biden..? You mean the guy that loses what he's saying half the time? Lol. Good luck stupid Joey.
It has a Republican lean at times, and Biden was probably up by 3-5 points at that time, so I'm not surprised by that
What they fail to recognize is that if Biden does not now pick Kamala, he will be seen as weak.  They also do not seem to realize that they are weakening the stature of the person he then picks.

Asked about the election, Joe Biden tells an anecdote about a kid from his old neighborhood named Tackle Box who once ate a butterfly on a dare.  He's hailed as the most progressive politician who's ever lived.

Every time this campaign tries to draw a contrast with Biden, the attempt boomerangs on them ten-fold.
Maybe you should read the stuff the Flynn case has produced.  Obama/Biden/Rice/Comey at a minimum conspired to frame the incoming NSA and at a max to manufacture grounds for impeachment.  As far as "blame Fox News", please. Bret Baier is the only straight news program on the air.
Yes - having another Catholic President would be wonderful.  If Biden wins the election, the bishops wil be all over him like they did with Obama.  It will be brutal.

Karen Bass would lose Florida for Biden, unfortunately. But it amazes me that there are 0 negative Warren articles coming out.
Shhh, this is exactly the terrible pick we want Biden to make - Incompetent, unlikeable, hack who somehow keeps getting promoted. That is what everyone wants to vote for in VP with high odds of moving up.  At least Trump picked Pence who is the definition of meets min standards.
We're gonna win big! Biden 2020!
The best part is that the Biden administration, in the interests of looking forward not backward, will not prosecute a single one of this administration's criminals.

I feel sorry for Joe Biden ...  and wonder why his wife allows him to continue in the campaign.
He‚Äôs been pretty snarky toward Biden at times.  I don‚Äôt get it.  Does he feel ticked that Biden didn‚Äôt call him in an official campaign capacity?
My question is - couldn‚Äôt the Democratic elections commissioner of the county or the Biden campaign asked the court to injoin the Trump campaign from impounding the ballots until irregularities could be determined one way or another?
Interesting.  I've been playing games (Solitaire, Spades, Hearts, etc.) on my phone and have only seen ads from the Dems, Biden, et al....
It broke my heart. What we once had. What we‚Äôve lost. What we may be headed for - if America doesn‚Äôt vote En Masse for Biden.

Definitely cool that the response to trump and Biden calling for the arrest of anarchists isn't a defense of people's right to protests but a rhetorical pretense that anarchists dont exist, trumps really the anarchist, all of which still assumes that we should round up anarchists
If Biden nails his VP candidate it could be over
Vote for Biden, maybe he nominates Obama for the Supreme Court.
Please do go out and get me a reputable citation, you know, facts to actually back up your claim that Biden won thanks to massive election fraud evidence of malfeasance. Or you can just keep yelling WAKE UP SHEEPLE see how serious people take you
Again with the embarrassingly wrong assertion that a Biden presidency would be the same or worse than a trump one. That‚Äôs just stupid. I‚Äôm sorry but it is it‚Äôs just stupid as hell and completely unserious; one is a meh centrist the other is a fucking fascist
Biden, And you‚Äôre still alive and still working in politics. Wow.   Just like most liberal college professors, you have no actual real life experience.  Congrats.
Biden needs everyone's vote knowing that Trump will refuse to leave.  There are few avenues to get him out given AGBarr is Trump's lawyer not the People's,
What do you think elections are for for??? The primaries are over and now we have two choices. If one of them is even an inch better than the other you vote for that one; joe Biden isn‚Äôt gonna try to kick 30m ppl off insurance or starve 700k others or deport 750k daca kids
Where is Biden today?  Couldn't make the funeral.
Im sorry if I made you uncomfortable by reminding you of just a tiny sample of the human suffering that trump has wrought and that will end with Biden. Elections aren‚Äôt about Expressing Yourself they‚Äôre about outcomes; a less than perfect president is BETTER than a fuckin monster
Oh good. So you agree with Biden.
Mike Bloomberg said he would do everything he could to help get Biden elected.. we need you to join Michael Jordan and others to help fight voter supression. Please
The reason you have to qualify with ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù is because the idea that Biden is ‚Äòanother side of the same coin‚Äô or will ‚Äòkeep going the same path trump did‚Äô is absurd; he‚Äôs objectively 50,000x better than trump on every issue progressives care about and he‚Äôs the only other option
The combination of Obama‚Äôs sought-after presence and his dire warnings about Trump appears to be paying off: Digital events he has participated in have raised $24 million for Joe Biden‚Äôs campaign since the start of last month.
Im not sure what you mean by ‚ÄúNovember 4th‚Äù; if what you plan to resist is efforts to legitamize a stolen election, then you‚Äôre not going to draw much support until after it happens period. Much more useful to focus that energy on helping Biden overcome voter supression and such
Trump is funnier.  Biden's would be funnier in the slapstick farce way of Weekend at Bernie's, except that Bernie is still alive just not there.  At least it would be funny until you actually needed someone there.
Trump vs. Biden: Where they stand on health, economy, more

Joe Biden has our support. Donald Trump has done nothing for internet consumers except facilitate more mergers and stripping away consumer protections. Competition remains an illusion for so many, so we need #netneutrality to protect us from yet more monetization.
They need to make Biden talk. Each and every time he opens his mouth it causes the whole United States of America to laugh and shake head in disbelief that this is who the Democrats have picked. They have lost their last bit of sense (if they ever had any).
Biden's actual running mate:
Correct yourself.  You were clearly wrong when you admonished Biden for suggesting this would happen.
Me waiting for the conspiracy theories to hatch: 1. Murdered by leftist doctors to embarrass Trump; 2. He would‚Äôve lived if they‚Äôd allowed him to take Hydroxychloriquine; 3. He was infected on purpose by a Biden supporter.
Today's headline: Biden back on rocker...
No one or anything will stop us. #WeWillVote for Biden 2020.
NBC: Biden's running mate most likely will be Biden's running mate
I hear you. Like I said. These are my opinions. This will pass. We will recover. And when that happens, I have certain things I cannot vote against and Biden has the wrong opinion on all of them. So I have to flip trump. I normally go 3rd party, but the left has pushed me too far
So, worth noting, I am NOT a fan of Biden. I am not likely to vote for him. I just will not vote for Trump. If gun to my head I HAD to pick one? I'd easily vote Biden. But Im much more likely to write in/3rd party than vote Biden.
If Biden showed leadership, I could see it. But  Bernie saying joe will be the most progressive POTUS since FDR. I can‚Äôt just not vote for that. I need to note to actively stop that. If they ran Tulsi, I would be in a tough spot. This proves neither party gets it.
I appreciate not wanting a victory for Trump.  Know that I want a victory for Biden no more than I want one for Trump.  Neither is an option for me.    I will be voting for  in a state Biden will likely win handily.  Because voting for her is my only option
I guess you wish you can take back the  ‚ÄúJoe Biden‚Äù is off his rocket tweet. Instead it‚Äôs Trump who‚Äôs crazy!!
Hell yeah, then we fall down the line and get a Democratic Senator since nobody else would technically be an office holder.  And whoever that senator is, I'm fairly certain they would be better than Biden!
Biden will become a far left puppet. Too risky. Plus he ain‚Äôt lasting 8 years. If his VP is hard left, I‚Äôm out.  I‚Äôm voting trump. Won‚Äôt matter in NY, but 3rd party is written off as Alex Jones crazies. But maybe if trump closes the gap, they will pay more attention.
trump wants to DELAY the election and is using lies about mail-in voting to justify his rhetoric. Don't let them get away with it.    #delay #TrumpIsARacist #TrumpIsNotWell #TrumpThreatensAmerica #TrumpMeltdown #TrumpPressConference #MichelleObamaPodcast
I do think that Biden is better. However, I don't know that I'm voting for him. I'm most likely to vote for a 3rd party.
But are you voting for Biden?  That‚Äôs no better. I have a number of friends in the LP that have always voted 3rd party. All of them are voting trump. Biggest reason is reopening, riots &amp; leftism gone wild. I wonder how rampant that is. Taking 2% from the LP is a big swing
Trump will murder Biden in debates that I expect.

vote for biden so elizabeth warren can be in office!!! please!!
I think debates will tell a lot. If trump can sell and Biden stumbles, polls might snap right. But if Biden can pull it together and trump resorts to name calling he could bury himself.
The extreme left isnt excited to vote Biden. They're excited to not vote Trump. I think Biden can pull more than enough middle/disgruntled R to easily win. Hillary had no shot at doing that, Joe I think can
I just wonder if a moderate factory worker that‚Äôs struggling to make ends meet &amp; his blue governor is keeping him home, but he‚Äôs been a consistent union blue voter. Will he change his mind?  And other than extreme left, who‚Äôs excited yo vote Biden?  Trumps people are fired up
This is what I consider the biggest issue with federal politics. Congress does not represent the people. Average age of Congress- 57, the Senate  62, Schumer  69, Mcconnell 78, Pelosi 80, Biden 77, Trump 74  Americans - 38  I love my Gram, but she shouldn't be in Congress

Biden has also adopted local manufacturing as a goal.(as opposed to China controlling the supply chain).
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden promised Tuesday that his economic agenda would combat long-standing racial inequalities as he sought to draw another sharp contrast with President Donald Trump.
As a supporter told me a couple of weeks ago, "At least he isn't going to turn this country into a socialist wasteland like Biden." Which what?
Sounds like a problem Joe Biden should try to solve, since saying things like this didn‚Äôt work in 16. Or maybe getting the ball rolling on ranked choice voting.  Or you can blame a tiny group for another 4 years of Trump. I know I‚Äôd just change my policies, but that‚Äôs me.
Biden says Trump 'behind the curve' on pandemic, denounces violent protesters
Biden terrifies Trump because there is no way for him to draw any contrasts between himself and Joe.  Any insult or critique he hurls at Joe boomerangs back on him ten-fold.
It is obviously Trump. Remember when Cuomo and Biden celebrated Photonics? That turned into a big nothing burger. A complete farce. The difference here is this is real work and real jobs.
Biden ready to pick his running mate.
Yes.  These four years have been a nightmare.  President Biden will restore dignity and respect to the office and allow us all to sleep at night.  Stop stoking fear.  We have an unprecedented deficit on the Republican watch that once again a Democrat will have to clean up.
Change was the least accurate pollster of the primary and has a strong anti-Biden house effect
It‚Äôs time now to drop the BOMBS on the Dem party, expose their corruption. Expose Joe Biden for the Ukraine corruption. We need a boomer to awake the rest of the people still asleep. This country will NOT survive if  is not re-elected
lol hilarious that you think Biden would not also be utterly lost on jeopardy, even a pre-school version.
Every time Biden tells us what he‚Äôll do as President it‚Äôs already being done or has already been done by Trump. Truth is he knows the Trump agenda is a winning agenda that‚Äôs why he uses it in his speeches but he‚Äôll never do any of it.
I drove from Western NY TO NC and back. I didn‚Äôt take a statistically accurate survey, but all I saw were Trump stickers a few old ‚ÄúI‚ÄôM WITH H=&gt;R‚Äùs here and there. Other than a some Anti-Trump yard signs, I didn‚Äôt see a single Biden sign in 1000 miles.
You all must be nervous after Barr admitted that he didn't think trump couldn't conceivably conduct a valid contesting of the election, if the win is a blow out in favor of Biden. Complicating matters for you: congresses researched voter fraud w mail ins: .0001%. Not your day!

Good on Biden for raising this seemingly obvious but often overlooked fact, and in a thoughtful and compelling way. Of course because I said a nice thing about Joe Biden I am now a cOrPOraTe CENtriST or a LiBErAL or some shit according to fake leftist twitter but who cares
Nope. It's Biden or applying for asylum. I won't stick around for the ovens to get built.
RUSH: All of the news that Biden's got it in the bag, that Biden's up by 10, 12, 13, whatever it is, they aren't true, they never have been true.
Dunno if Biden feels that way! We shall see.
What are you following Biden for? Isn't Trump your man?
This election had a slight chance at being the pathway towards anti-fascism. Now it's just about putting in a president too political to spend his time seeking personal enrichment rather than just being an imperialist. No less angry and focused on politics under Biden than Trump.
He had lost the primaries to Bernie. But then they realized before SC that Bernie was going to be the nominee and the party forced out everyone for Biden. Everyone agreed to get out because they were all in the know and running for VP which would become Pres.
This is a fascinating read:  "We misunderstand the nature of patriarchy if we think that merely having power and influence are verboten for women."  #WomenSupportingWomen
Personally I think Biden will pick someone who is nicer to him than Kamala was in the primary. He doesn't strike me as someone willing to forgive the treatment she gave him.
Biden is a solid Yes vote here.
No they‚Äôre not thats absurd (i shouldn‚Äôt need to explain to socialists the 50,000 ways a Biden wh is better than this one for anyone who cares about the left) in that letter he‚Äôs distinguishing random violent pricks from peaceful protestors (ie you) that‚Äôs not the worst thing
People think that trying to burn down a federal courthouse isn‚Äôt violence so why would they think that Joe Biden has major cognitive issues?
Man if he could‚Äôve been the nominee...like I‚Äôm not trashing Biden or anything but Brown was the answer to the 2020 primary‚Äôs electable vs progressive fight; not only is he one of the leaders of the Dems left wing he actually outperforms the party in a big, diverse swing state
Biden with a 94% chance here, and here‚Äôs a photo with statewide probabilities
Every time they say they won‚Äôt vote for Biden, a leftist (actual leftists not cosplaying hipsters with üåπemojis) gets pissed off; at least rightwingers are honest about wanting 4 more years of fascism and ppl who don‚Äôt care are honest about not caring
‚ÄúSimplistic modeling‚Äù is the key here. Morris also has a toy election model and I think it‚Äôs better for Biden. Don‚Äôt have the link but I‚Äôll find it
Biden says post-pandemic economy can fight racial inequality
Will miss you!  But you‚Äôll be a bigshot in the Biden Administration.
Kamala August 1st.  No way Politico just made up a Biden statement to pull a quote from
Nope. Not a chance. Will,wait for Biden.
Well Joe Biden says it's important for anarchists on the streets to get prosecuted, because America is a country where certain ideologies are illegal.  Apparently.
See you at Biden's inauguration.  THAT will be worthy.
1)  Can't believe next week is the first week of #August. 2)  VP pick by next week!  #Biden2020
Thankfully the large majority of real life sanders voters are normal people who care enough to back Biden in November even if he wasn‚Äôt their first choice, but that minority who are basically Che Guevara t-shirts in human form are very loud (especially online)
Joe Biden is a bit too high profile of an individual to have a news outlet make up a quote and attribute it to him on their website.
Recent shortlist member Susan Rice is a black woman who was in the Obama administration and hasn't publicly slammed Biden.
Is anybody going to ask Biden what other political beliefs should be illegal?
Democrats Attempt To Derail Biden Burisma Probe As Election Nears
It genuinely shocks me how ineffectual and out of touch the Democratic party is. If it wasn't for Trump being such a spectacularly awful candidate, I wouldn't be surprised if 2020 turned into 1984... Then again, Biden has yet to choose his running mate.
They can offer nothing, still win, and carry on as usual. I don't want 4 more years of Trump. That's obviously very bad. But there an underlying insidiousness to Biden winning too. And it feels like we don't have a choice but to let it happen.
The biggest reason I hate Biden, aside from the obvious of him being  republican lite, is that if he wins, it gives the centrist wing of the Dems legitimacy. It will confirm for them that they can outright ignore the prog wing, and not have to actually do anything progressive.
Ty so much Ethan!‚úå‚ù§
I can‚Äôt even imagine a world without this speculation poisoning every interaction.
That's a fascinating question right there. But to be fair, wasn't part of the push for photonics from President Obama, too? I mean, Biden was here for that announcement.
I'm still holding my breath for 175 days until President Biden is inaugurated and moved into the White House.
You got most of them, yeah. Biden was also a consideration for a little bit
Every American has access to luxury cars. Anybody can walk in, look at a Tesla or Aston Martin or whatever, and take one for a spin maybe.   But ... not everyone can afford to buy one.   Biden is saying that walking around in the dealership is good enough--the same as owning one.
Joe Biden wore the economic vision for American manufacturing first ... and he wore it better. #Biden2020
God these are like free Biden ads.
"Please, keep doing more press conferences"- The Biden Campaign.
You look fantastic Mr President and a fabulous news conference as usual. I really don‚Äôt know it blows my mind how anyone can vote for Biden. You are the winner. Trump 2020.
Biden isn‚Äôt much of an egotist
Not sure if the American people are tired of relitigating Obama's foreign policy and specifically Benghazi, but you can absolutely count on the GOP to do something like that. I also think the VP has to be a "do no harm" choice w/ Biden's outstanding polling
Biden, he's not Trump and he has progressive policies on climate and gun control
:( but I'm already ridin with Biden
If you're reluctant to vote for Joe Biden, just remember that these are the kinds of people who will continue being high-ranking officials with considerable amounts of power if Trump is re-elected.
Ok, Joe Biden speaking at a lectern in front of what sounds like a perfectly-empty auditorium is just weird.
Yeah Biden‚Äôs got this in the bag, you shouldn‚Äôt bother to go out and vote in November
Biden's #BUILDBACKBETTER . Giving a fantastic speech right now.. so presidential ! So proud of our next president
It's why their pushing so hard on Joe Biden's cognitive health. Classic Republican projection. Whatever they accuse you of is what they are doing
It TOOK you LONG ENOUGH to do the ONE THING I was interested in you following THROUGH on....Too bad you WAITED so long to give your attention to something that would benefit ALL Americans.  Your plan to finally do it at election time is BACKFIRING....Bye Don! (BIDEN) 2020!!!
JAYAPAL FOR PRESIDENT!! RIGHT AFTER BIDEN..
if I was writing this section I would‚Äôve emphasized strengthening unions by making organizing dramatically easier in order to help all workers and workers of color in particular but I‚Äôm not, which is why we have to both elect Biden and build sustained pressure to push him
Ill be generous and assume you actually think this is a strategy (and aren‚Äôt posturing and grifting sirota/gray style) this doesn‚Äôt work how you think it does. Biden isnt gonna waste 1 second catering to people who would never vote for him no matter what he promised; why would he
Sitting out the goddamn election or voting for some Green Party parasite isn‚Äôt ‚Äúpushing Biden to adopt m4a‚Äù anyone who thinks about this for more than two seconds sees that which is why the vast majority of Democrats (and former bernie voters) will vote Biden in November
20,000 lies... not sure what you mean. I guess you're keeping score. He did correct Biden's prison bill, and created a job environment nationally beneficial to minorities at a record level. But, I get the feeling you'll call that a lie too.
That‚Äôs not her most potent role. She‚Äôs an extremely high-profile legislator who‚Äôs popular with a national demographic that‚Äôs definitely not sold on voting for Biden.
If you‚Äôre asking if I think Biden will lose for want of Tlaib‚Äôs endorsement, then no. That seems very unlikely.   But I do think it shows a certain lack of moral fiber to be unable to come down clearly when so much is on the line.
That's how much you know Trump's the only one that cares about veterans and our soldiers #blm is a racist you're obviously and #idiot #AllLivesMatter retard #Trump2020 has only been in for 4 years Biden and Hillary have been in for over 40 are you blind or just stupid
Just like Biden and Hillary they had over 40 years to do something your point is?
Endorsing Joe Biden against Donald Trump should be the easiest decision of any Democrat‚Äôs life.   Never in our lifetimes has an electoral choice been more blindingly clear.
How is this a lie? They have audio, and he talked about it on video. I don't want him to be in trouble, but I guess we shall see. I'm not defending Trump for all of his decisions. Just saying Biden's history should also be considered. The Ukraine thing is by no means propoganda.
I preferred Warren or Sanders, but beggars can't be choosers when fighting fascism. So, Biden. But I'm not enthusiastic about him.
I didn't. But I am this year. Biden is in some trouble. Read this article.
Why do you make all these assumptions and snide comments about me? Deportations under Obama were outrageous! And if Biden does anything remotely similar, I will protest.
Deportations under Obama were outrageous, I agree. If Biden hasn‚Äôt released a plan for the pandemic that addresses your concerns, press him and his team on it.
I‚Äôm really not sure why you feel the need to be so antagonistic to me, but ok. I would have voted for someone more progressive in November, but there isn‚Äôt one available. Biden won. So fight for your progressive values with someone where progress stands a fucking chance.
This is embarrassingly out of touch with reality. Trump got into the whitehouse because of massive voter supression and a blatantly rigged electoral system that elevated him even after losing by 3m votes (the exact kind of thing John Lewis fought against) not Joe Biden
Corruption plagues Biden's history as well as his present. I agree with you, this is not a partisan thing...if you are calling Biden ethical, you haven't researched the wealth of facts available for everyone. All I am saying. All should be held accountable.
There was a primary to demand someone better than Biden. But Biden won. What exactly do you think was happening in early 2020?
But are you confident in Biden? Let's look at both candidates with the same level of scrutiny.
Ok, you do not know me, but go ahead, please do explain how you are right and I‚Äôm wrong. I‚Äôm ready. Truly. Explain how Biden is as bad or worse than Trump. He needs to be AS BAD OR WORSE. Go ahead. I‚Äôm listening.
If that statement is a reason for you to keep a clear and present danger in the White House, you need to think a little harder. Biden is not woke or anti-racist. I agree. The current president is a deeply racist, dangerously authoritarian person. There is no comparison.
While #Trump is pushing #AlienDNA...  "...$30B worth of previously proposed govt investments to a small business opportunity fund benefiting black, brown &amp; Native American entrepreneurs...spur five times as much in private investments."  #Biden2020
Are you seriously claiming that Biden is an authoritarian fascist? Because unless you are claiming that with a straight face (and I would challenge how you could possibly claim that), then there is no comparison.
Everyone needs to do their part, Armie. And this is not helpful. At all. PLEASE keep your privileges in mind and how other people are the ones who will suffer if Trump is re-elected! ‚Äî NOT YOU. You are a white, cis, wealthy man! We have to push Biden. But we have to ELECT HIM!
Done!
Armie, I love you, but how is this even remotely helpful right now? Biden is our only option. And he has made a lot of progress from the 90s, and even in the last few weeks with the joint task forces with Sanders. How about push for change you want?
By electing Joe Biden!
Look around. We have a pandemic out of control, unemployment in double digits, an economy cratered, crimes being openly committed by the president and his admin and you are worried about chaos that MIGHT happen under Biden? Lol!!!
‚ÄòIt's absolutely serious‚Äô: Susan Rice vaults to the top of the VP heap
Why did Trump focus on that simple IQ test for so long?  Because Biden can't pass it.  Something's wrong.
Lol I feel what you're saying! But remember all of that when Biden comes out the basement and talks in person, without his handlers.
I don‚Äôt think this is principled dissent. I think it‚Äôs valueless grandstanding.
Bernie Bros are leaving . . .
Yes and the plan is do not have children until your ready to start a family and your career is to a point you are comfortable with. My name is Joe Biden and forgot what I said already
Someone's angling for a Vice Presidency!
Doesn‚Äôt your logic imply that America isn‚Äôt great now?    Isn‚Äôt that the fault of current leadership?  So, this is a plea for a vote for Biden, you numb-nuts! üòÇ
A-rated pollster Fox News has Biden +13, while Trafalgar and Morning Consult has Biden +5 and +3. I‚Äôm much more inclined to believe Fox News‚Äôs results.
After 2016 and what appeared was going to be a resounding beating, he won. Polls again say resounding beating, I am not confident. I think Biden needs to come out of hiding to win over the blue collar middle class Americans that won Trump the election in 2016.
They‚Äôre really trying to hide Biden from speaking in public. The dementia is running strong üí™üèº
RUSH: What all of this means is that you shouldn't be believing anything in the news about Biden leading in the polls, about Biden being way ahead of Trump.
It'd be sweet if the Presidency that began on that ludicrous gold escalator with the claim that #Mexicans were rapists ended with #immigration pushing Biden over the edge to a win.  #Biden2020, for the future.
Seriously if you people devoted 1/10th, 1/50th even of the time and energy you spend bitching about libz/Biden/the dnc/whatever to helping progressives downballot and actual organized pressure campaigns and general elections and more you might actually be useful
Putting aside biden (although you cant really put aside Biden if you care even a little bit about any progressive cause since he‚Äôs by far the best of two options) the ‚Äòbigger picture‚Äô involves actually working long term to change the party instead of whining and voting green
Trump‚Äôs Nazi America.  Vote for Biden and vote GOP out to save America.
The way joe Biden speaks vs how trump speaks isn‚Äôt even political Biden speaks like a leader
They could 25th his dumb ass and put John Kasich on the ticket for November. A respectable conservative that would continue most of Trump's policies? He would wipe the floor with Biden.
Fitness is a relative not an absolute property, and even though when people say Trump isn‚Äôt fit to be President, they‚Äôre referring to his moral fitness, we should point out that a morbidly obese cheeseburger addict who doesn‚Äôt believe in exercise isn‚Äôt in better shape than Biden.
They haven‚Äôt changed at all.  Nothing changed except the openness of their positions.  They still oppose school choice for American minorities, and Joe Biden himself gave the eulogies for the last two serving Dixiecrats.
Biden isn't POTUS yet,  nor was Portland his district. Get bent!
Have y‚Äôall seen the propaganda commercial about how Biden is for defunding the police and an uwu old lady uwu has a robber and calls 911 and there‚Äôs a voicemail saying ‚Äúdue to the defunding police movement no one is here to take your call‚Äù? CAUSE IM üòÇüòÇüòÇ

RUSH: I&amp;#039;ve had a couple emails from people asking, &amp;#34;Hey, Rush, what do you think about this projection that Trump is gonna lose everything?&amp;#34;
I doubt that given that this started as a reply to a former bernie staffer who has most definitely NOT moved on and has no interest in Biden besides him losing lol. But yeah most bernie voters are normal democrats the small but loud contingent of dicks online give them a bad name
There‚Äôs a guy in my neighborhood who puts the nastiest signs in his front yard ‚ÄúLibrards‚Äù etc... I think I‚Äôll quietly place a Biden sign
No she just spends all of her time and energy complaining about joe Biden, complaining about Democrats, and then writing articles (like three weeks ago!)  and tweets explicitly defending sitting at home in protest or voting third party
This has to be something Biden is personally opposed to. I totally think we should legalize weed though
Agreed!!!! Been saying it to my one person I see daily. My reach is far! Biden: present plans for how you will solve things and then ask Trump where his are. And a plan to have a plan does not count Trump!  Debate w/Trump just gives the liar a stage. He is not worthy of a debate!
It‚Äôs nice of her to spiffy it up for the Biden‚Äôs!
George Carlin hated ALL politicians including ALL Democrats!    He would rail against Bernie Sanders who decried billionaire-beholden politicians THEN endorsed and campaigned for the two most billionaire-beholden candidates in history in Hillary and Biden!!
‚Ä¶..by voting for JOE BIDEN in 100 days!!!!!!!
Poll: Trump supporters more excited, Biden supporters more anxious
There are plenty of anti-Trump hashtags.  We need consistent messaging on POSITIVE #BIDEN TWEETS.  You feed 'em, we'll tweet 'em, trend 'em, and bug the h*ll out of 45.  But we need a central point of leadership.  Help us help you and elect #Biden2020!!
Before I get into this and explain it...I just have to ask... are you voting for Biden in November?
I will vote for Joe Biden no matter what
And just to be clear, I am not a huge Biden fan.   I voted for and donated to Bernie in 2016.  And Warren in 2020.    But Biden already has the most progressive platform of any nominee in history.    We just have to keep pushing him more to the left
Biden recycling &amp; updating Obama's campaign motto with the truth: "Don't even hope for change."
#Resisters -- WE'RE GETTING TO HIM.    Keep it up.  I'd love to see #Biden2020 in there more often!  Every time you bash #Trump, throw in a #Biden hashtag.   all we need is for you to tell us what to trend.  You have an army ready to go.
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Trump totally sucks, but Biden is the kind of guy who would jerk off into someone else‚Äôs sock.
So HRC never stepped foot in the "Fly Over States" during her run for the Oval Office, now Biden takes that winning tactic even further. He's hiding in his basement getting asked softball questions from the MSM, who ignores his ten page list of corruption as former VP under Obama
If Biden wins and we take the Senate these all need to happen or nothing will change  Effectively end the EC  Let DC/Puerto Rico vote for statehood  End the filibuster  Enact voting laws that include automatic registration for all 18+ and makes election day a federal holiday

The liberals know Biden cannot debate and talk freely without having a Teleprompter and they‚Äôre trying to hide them and keep them off for debate stage because they know it would show how much dementia he has
Biden should stay in his basement, don't talk to Fox News, or bother debating for that matter. Let's just vote.
Based Biden
A great man, John Lewis. reacting to #Trump's shameful snub.  #johnlewisRIP #DonaldTrumpIsRuiningOurCountry #Biden
Well I think you could argue it does help Biden politically to get Tlaib's endorsement. She's a representative in a swing state, and she would help him to line the progressive end of the caucus behind him
I mean in that nobody can force her yes. But the discussion isn't whether Warren/Tlaib is obligated to endorse Sanders/Biden it's whether or not we think they ought to do that
People are on to you  Hitler, Mugabe, and your bff Putin pulled the same stunts!
Biden campaign declines 'Fox News Sunday' interview, 1 week after Chris Wallace's Trump sitdown  #FoxNews
Now sit back and watch the polls turn in his favor from the very same people that a week and a half ago said that they once voted for him but are now voting for Biden. The electorate is fickle.
The problem is those of us with brains watch this and know how sad and true it is, and we are already voting for Biden. The cultists who support their leader won‚Äôt watch it, and if they do they‚Äôll get angry and shout ‚ÄúTrump 2020!‚Äù at the 16 second mark and label it fake news.
Gotta' love the jab at the end with the mask-wearing, as well.  All of us have seen enough with this cretin.  I don't just want Biden to win any more.  I want him to carry over 30 states while doing it.
trump will never agree to debate Biden. He knows how horribly it will go for him.
Lol... And Pelosi &amp; Schumer. And don't 4get Biden. They are just making a name for the dems. Pelosi told people early on that it was ok to to to Chinatown. They want illegal immigrants in the US to just commit crimes, collect welfare, &amp; vote the way they want. Lol... nice party.
It does make me nervous about who Joe Biden trusts to help him make these super important decisions. I hope he is relying on a multitude of information and people and not just this idiot. #JoeBiden2020

In 100 days, amid deep partisan divides and surging #COVID19 cases, Trump and Biden will face off in the presidential election. DNC Chair  says the election actually starts much sooner, and that the Biden camp is focused on getting the word out about early voting.
I think we will have to form a mutiny on January 20th to physically remove him . All hands need to be on deck that day in Washington.. we can either drag him out or we can join hands and cheer when Biden raises his right hand and takes the reigns.
And Biden and Dem leadership aren't advocating for any of those either. If they were there wouldnt be a problem
Roughly three months before Election Day, a new poll finds that Biden‚Äôs supporters are less enthusiastic than Trump‚Äôs ‚Äî both about the campaign itself and about their candidate ‚Äî although the Democrat‚Äôs coalition may be equally motivated by anxiety.
#Biden2020 + whomever works best for #JoeBiden.  Picking #Biden's VP is a #JoeBidenJob.
Poll: Anxiety props up Biden, Trump voters enthusiastic
Biden walked the streets of Wilmington a few weeks back answerring questions and talking with the people there. Get out of your bubble
Yeah I‚Äôd take $500 if they could get it extended to spring-early summer of next year like you said (otherwise they‚Äôll just cut it the day Biden is inaguarated) otherwise they should just tell the GOP to piss off; I wouldn‚Äôt put the party‚Äôs name on $200/wk that‚Äôs a joke
She should consult with Jill Biden as she's moving in in January.
The far twitter left doesn‚Äôt matter as much as they think they do. Biden will ignore them as he should.
Joe Biden is my favorite pickled vegetable.
This could be another re-alignment election. If Biden wins big it will mean he brought along the South. I can almost imagine a scenario where Biden squeaks by in PA, loses Wisconsin, Iowa and Ohio but wins NC, Georgia, Fla, Az and maybe even Texas.
Great point. Dems aren‚Äôt great at bringing out minority voters in off year elections. I‚Äôd agree with you, NC is gonna be a heavy lift. Fla seems do-able. Biden is popular with the elderly and Jews. Plus, he won there twice before on a presidential ticket.
You must be aware that 90% of AA folks vote blue. It‚Äôs not us telling them how to vote, it‚Äôs how they actually vote. 90%! You don‚Äôt do better than that in politics. Biden has a point.
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen someone with a Biden shirt. But year. I would as well.
Disagree.  It's a day to make sure everyone has equal voting opportunities.  It's a day to push a positive agenda that Biden has in mind.  It's a day to leave President Trump alone and let him talk as much as he wants.  #Positives
The Democrats are corrupt. I would not be shocked if the Democrats paid off the media to make announcements that Biden is leading in the polls when it couldn't be further from the truth.
Ty for shout out Friend!‚úå‚ù§
You mean Biden.
Bump!
Yet, leading Democrats refuse to call for an end to the violence.  And I didn't even mention Joe Biden or President Obama.  What are people to think other than they secretly support the Lawlessness, violence and damage to people and cities.
BIDEN 2020   He won't tear-gas your mom
Biden is a more racist than Trump could ever be
Yes, the president is living in fantasy in between more time on the golf course than any past president in history. Joe Biden is doing just fine. In fact there is no reason for any debates or conventions. Cancel them all and let's vote.
Biden thinks it's William Wallace.
Keep up this failing strategy of trying your best to paint Joe Biden as a radical left-wing revolutionary and maybe he‚Äôll end up with over 330 electoral votes.
They made fun of Biden, they wore gas masks on the floor to make fun of people in masks. They made masks political and NOW after 147,000 dead they want to rewrite history. Nah, not gonna happen.
If you‚Äôre a Democrat remember why you voted for Trump in 2016 in the first place. You were tired of the establishment raising your taxes, high unemployment, open borders, etc. Now are you really thinking about being like a dog that returns to his vomit by voting for Biden?
If Biden actually comes out from under his rock and debates President Trump...should Trump shake his hand,  throw the finger, or slap cuffs on him?
Biden will drone you and Tulsi probably has no qualms about killing everyone on the stage / calling in Assad for backup
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.

I am uncomfortable standing in line to vote in November, but I will if it means I have a chance to vote for Joe Biden. I absolutely cannot imagine four more years with this idiot.

Harris was my first choice for 46. With Biden I'd go with Rice &amp; Harris as AG.
May Biden's margin keep growing.
Twitter and Facebook become targets in Trump and Biden ads
I predict they‚Äôll go with Susan Rice because they perceive her as the most centrist and safe choice of all the black women under consideration, and because Biden knows her best
Can't wait for Biden to restore law and order.
Fox News should thank is lucky stars of they even get press credentials in a Biden Administration or any other. They have blood on their hands.
We've got 2 decades of Joe Biden's tax returns. Please show the class where he's in hock to China. Now let's peruse Trump's financial records... Oh yeah he's fighting tooth and nail to hide them from idiots like you. Well let's go through Ivankas mystery patents shall we.
Doesn't look as if it's going down like that, jefe. Not with Texas and Georgia being battleground states, and Biden ahead in every swing state.
You called Biden a racist. Were you lying then or now. Sorry, always
I think it's going to be whoever Jim Clyburn wants. Biden owes him big time
Cant wait till Biden comes in and rips down all the ugly walls youve built. get out of OUR HOUSE.
Anti-Trump Republican groups urge voters to support Joe Biden  via
Reefer madness came out 84 years ago and many still act like it was released 4 years ago. It's almost 2021, Dems need to grow a pair to say it out loud and push Biden on this.
Yet he will win over you. A lot of states will choose Biden over you. The majority of Americans see you for the failure you are. Stop flailing.
‚ÄúPerson. Man. Woman. Camera. TV.‚Äù  I‚Äôm pretty sure Biden isn‚Äôt all that concerned about the debates.
you can be for trump simply by trying to dent biden. so, i'm standing by my point here.
Translation:  I'm never going to accept my eventual defeat to Biden in 100 days, so I'm planning my escape now.
Wake up all you people out there voting for Biden. You see Portland, Seattle , NYC ... this is what every city will like if joe Biden gets in. Are you all stupid, can‚Äôt think for yourself. What the hell do u think will happen if the police are defunded? Who you going to call ?
Michelle Martin was just doing a promo about a  interview Mon. She said "when Biden is president next year." I don't care if you are a Biden or  supporter. She should have never said that. And they wonder why people think media is bias.
Never thought I'd see the day  when the GOP considered  Joe Biden (?!?) a radical leftist. ü§£
Kanye West tweets he 'can beat Biden off.‚Äù  Sure. Probably. But I wish he‚Äôd stick to the issues.
I agree with  The states and people that won Trump the last election are the white blue collar voters that felt left behind by the dems. Biden can easily win them over but unless he puts the effort in we are going to have four more years of this shit
You never heard Biden say he wants to defund the police? Is that a serious statement? If you are just going to lie and play dumb, I‚Äôm not entertaining you. Trump absolutely said police departments must change. One of the few times his words were on point.
Biden, the guy who‚Äôs condoning violent protests, and wants to get rid of the police? Yeah that seems to be working great in Seattle, Portland, and NYC! ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°
These updates will occur every 10 days (90 days until ED, 90 days, etc.). Another blog on the state of the election will probably be arriving in early-to-mid August; in an ideal world Biden's VP will be announced and we'll have data on how the pick impacted the race.
Ratings changes: Iowa: Tilt Trump to Lean Trump Ohio: Tilt Biden to Tilt Trump  (2/3)
FYI Joe Biden was actually born in Pennsylvania and has roots there. Since you have no depth, you have no roots and nobody claims you as their own.  Even your own family members denounce you. #TrumpIsNotWell #TrumpIsALoser #TrumpIsADisaster
New update to the aggregation of quantitative models: Biden sees a slight increase in his winning % to 86.49, but the races in Iowa and Ohio swing against him. (1/)
How about imaging how either one could add value to a Biden administration?
Yes, all the things Trump promised and failed to deliver in PA.. They should just shut up and vote for him again and get nothing for another 4 years and never be able to come back in any of their or their kids or grandkids' lifetimes.   Biden is the least "radical" anythingI agree that her cult on Twitter can be a real turn-off but I still think think Kamala is a moderate Democrat and one of the better choices for VP. She's on my short list - although I'll vote for Biden regardless of who he chooses.
Last I checked Biden realized he needs actual left of center progressives on board to win. I‚Äôm here to hold his corporatist ass to üî• and not sell our country üá∫üá∏ out. More than that, there‚Äôs no reason Dems can‚Äôt create ads like Lincoln without compromising the parties integrity!
Of course you think she was a horrible candidate and is a bad strategic choice for Biden, you‚Äôre a Republican who backed Meg Whitman.
Today was it for me. I‚Äôm done. Joe only gets any active support from me if it‚Äôs part of a Biden/Harris ticket.
2. This level of a criminal. Disbar him. It's astounding how many criminals Harvard has educated.  perjured himself at Senate heating. Is lying where one is deployed ok? Johnson is also an accessory to extortion.  you warned Johnson he goes after bs with Biden
Biden is also plagiarizing me and spying on me.
Biden isn't fit to lead either.
üìçIt‚Äôs not about liking any one politician at this point. America is on the chopping block in Nov.  Vote Biden, get Schumer as Sen Majority tyrant. Tag team that with Pelosi or the .squad‚Äîwho‚Äôve already hijacked her House gavel. Adios electoral college. Hello cultural tyranny.
Joe Biden can declare gun control a national emergency, then direct funds from the Pentagon.
You wish you beat Obama, and you will not beat Joe Biden. Tecnichally, you didn't even beat Hillary. Many people realized that they fucked up voting for you, republicans are openly voting for Joe. YOU ARE TOAST #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020  #EvictTtump
Boy, this is getting ugly. Biden ought to make his choice soon before this worsens.
The other guy is still Trump, right?  Biden could run with a can of baked beans for V.P.
Progressives don't know how to work the Karen Bass vs. Kamala Harris controversy üôÑ  If Biden picked Bass, the #KHive would lose their sh*t and risk us losing to Trump. They then become the new Bernie Bros" and take all the blame. The Dem Party shatters üíÖüèæ   Push #KarenBassforVP!
Chris Wallace challenges Biden to follow Trump on 'Fox News Sunday,' says ex-VP must 'get into game shape'   U know what Chris lets see u ask the same tough questions to Biden as u do Trump. There‚Äôs many u can ask him like, ur not getting the billion$‚Äôs.
We know how had Biden is though. We had 8 years of him. The only thing that changed was that the rich grew richer and the middle class shrunk.
If Biden wins I really hope he finds a place for you in his administration.
As a Republican candidate Trump made history with this graph.  He's history now, seeing Biden is up big in Florida, 9+ points to be exact
What's it gonna be thanks or fuck off? I'm the kind of person who makes my mind up quick and rarely changes it and I'm not gonna change my mind about any racist capitalists including Biden.
I feel like these people trying to push Biden are now careening into directions and toward unknowns that will surely backfire.  I hope he is appropriately ignoring them because this is what hurt McCain. Decision making seems hard. But not really. It‚Äôs obvious.
It really is a disgrace.  white ‚Äúadvisors‚Äù trying to trash Kamala Harris in the press to manipulate his decision. Joe Biden needs new friends

Whoever Biden picks will be lightyears better than Pence so stop it!
I think one reason I've been much more able to reconcile myself with Biden than many on the left is their main thing was an intra-party fight on the best way to reform healthcare, mine was these sorts of process issues üëá
Biden wrote the Bill, like theres no way around it dude.
I don‚Äôt want to burst your bubble, but if you looked through their previous tweets. This appears to be a monthly poll, and the trend. From this poll is moving in Biden‚Äôs favor.
Yes, because in 2010, then District Attorney Kamala Harris told Karen Bass to make this speech so she can release it reporters to secure her position as Biden's VP in 2020. Jeez. If it didn't come out now it would have come out during the general.
I think Biden is just as dumb as #Chump is and not much of an improvement on him either.

Be prepared for Biden‚Äôs VP choice to get vilified by conservatives and the media in a way Pence never did. Because she has a vagina, while he‚Äôs just afraid of them.
You stole an election from Hillary Clinton 4 years ago with Putin's help. On Novemeber 3rd Biden will beat you and the SDNY will put your  in prison. #personwomanmancameratv
Biden wouldn‚Äôt be saying he was the most progressive candidate if he didn‚Äôt care about their vote, he wouldn‚Äôt have put AOC and BETO on his staff which is ran by a former bernie staffer, he‚Äôd be moving closer to center like all other candidates have after winning their primary.
Jim Clyburn has been on tv a ton the past few days.   Obviously he would have a lot to say about John Lewis. But part of me thinks that he‚Äôs out to smooth out or push back on the Biden VP committee comments that have been reported.   I wonder who Clyburn wants ...
If Biden picks her, he will be entirely against it. If he doesn‚Äôt, they will lambast Biden for caving in to religious intolerance. FFS, it‚Äôs Fox! Truth is secondary.
its cause Hillary and Biden run off Obama for more POC votes

Back when i did Indian American advocacy work, i had an hr long breakfast w Biden discussing Jammu Kashmir. He is no Islamist. India needs a strong America, so even if he's not in line w Modi, he's infinitely bttr than Trump who is weakening us globally. (Also Saudis fund Trump)
Yo, look at Biden‚Äôs background and milquetoast environmental policy. Point being that we don‚Äôt have time for his ineffectual dismissive attitude over such a pressing catastrophe. Read my original comment, register that the Lincoln project backers gave us Trump. Dems need to act
Chip in to elect Joe Biden
Good rub, Biden/Harris 2020!
Our Country is set to fall if Biden is elected. With little to no Police and handicapping their Authority, Officers will quit and who will replace them. Patriots will band together and that will be the start of the end. Civil War will destroy us, while Foreign enemies wait.

I will actually vote for Biden if he picks Clyburn as VP out of respect for owning K-hive, warren losers, and all women in one swift blow
Help me understand this. Biden wrote the racistass Crime Bill so he could tie in his ‚Äúbaby VAWA‚Äù into it instead of just pushing VAWA?!?!??
I agree. Most of the people I know don't follow Twitter and when I tell them about the drama that's being generated here over Biden's selection of VP, they think it's crazy. However once they're aware of what's going on, they too have a strong opinion about the prospects.
Hey Mike.  I've dropped some bucks on ByeDon2020 merch and like it.  But does any of the money go to the Biden campaign? I like the stuff, but need Biden to win.
Imagine saying, "I'd vote for Biden over Trump, but Kamala Harris as VP is my deal-breaker!" ü§£ü§£ü§£ Idiot Berners. ü§£ü§£ü§£
‚ÄúWe have to tell them the truth. And some of the truth is going to be hard, because science ‚Äì masks do matter," Biden said at a fundraiser this evening, via pooler    "Social distancing does matter. You've got to get the curve down and keep it going down."
Not exaggerated.  The stories are not gossip, but factual. I am stunned to have just learn about Bass only a few minutes ago.  Would not want anyone one from that group near Biden.
Biden HAS foreign policy
By the way, *this* is why Biden mirroring Trump‚Äôs use of ‚Äúanarchists‚Äù to mean criminals was so bad. I‚Äôm the context of Portland protests the word very much refers to ideology as much as behavior.
I'll vote for Biden even if he chooses a goat as VP.   Having said that, I don't see as an advantage to have a scientology fan in that position. That's one of the creepiest cults in this crazy country of ours.
"This will take more than just holding our noses at the ballot box and voting for Biden," writes Zoe Fenson. "We need to make sure he wins by as close to a landslide as possible."

100%.   An "Avengers Assemble!" strategy against Trump is the way to go.   It'll give Biden a team of strong surrogates during the campaign. It'll also calm the fears of some people who worry about Biden's age by letting them know there is a strong team that comes with him.

You're right. Biden can keep quiet and let Trump endorse pizza places in the middle of a global pandemic.

I SO agree. For Americans to know in advance who BIden will have around him to work with him to right the economy , repair international relationships, put Americans to work with federal projects, calm the distemper. -  all to look forward to.
I hope Joe Biden has everything to go on day 1 as well as Pelosi‚Äôs House committees &amp; Schumer‚Äôs Senate ones. I have a feeling a whole lot of people are going to called to testify at hearings &amp; Trump won‚Äôt be able to direct them to refuse to show up or answer questions!!
A senile Joe Biden will be good for the United States. If we engage of wars of aggression, forced democracy, bully tactics, bombings of children, pedophilia of elites, and massive racism we can just say that we don't remember that stuff. üòÉ

Pretty conveniently placed given Biden is supposed to reveal someone by next week. Wow.
Just saw a guy in a Biden mask
And he makes fun of Biden's  mental state when he can't even remember who he ran against.
I am gonna block all of the K-Hive if or when Joe Biden announces Kamala Harris will be his vice president because  they have to be on the top of the list of the most obnoxious supporters of all time on social media.
You beat Hillary 4 years ago. Probably the most unlike able candidate to run for President except for you. She still got 3 million more votes and you needed Russia‚Äôs help to win. You would get crushed by Obama just like you will by Biden. #NobodyLikesTrump
This guys still claiming Biden wants to defund / disband police, meanwhile he was proven to be lying about that on freakin Fox News, and he‚Äôs still out here lying about that to his racist fuck followers
And they were trying to talk about Hunter Biden and nepotism??
Joe Biden should say something but he has strong black men &amp; women working in high level positions. Someone need to say, now, what is being said about Kamala Harris is not a reflection of the campaign and is unacceptable overall. Kamala Harris standing alone like Hillary Clinton.
Am I a bad Democrat?  I don‚Äôt care if Karen Bass went to a Scientology event in her district and said what politicians say? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Trump said there are ‚Äúfine people‚Äù who are white nationalists and locked kidnapped kids in cages. I‚Äôll vote Biden no matter who is picked. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I have a lot of feelings about the Biden/Warren fundraiser tonight.  Mostly it boils down to: 1. I still think Elizabeth Warren should be President. 2. Being a woman is exhausting AF.
Biden could pick my cat as VP and then shoot it on 5th Ave and I still vote for him. Still, he should choose a woman of color who is not tied to Scientology.

Given the current alternative I would so choose Biden over a wannabe dictator.  As for the Republicans what active policies have they set forth to benefit the African/Black American constituency since Eisenhower?

Odds are low. But if Biden just happens to drop that info,  you need to break the news in this thread.   Accomplished actress / political reporter.
Neither did Hillary. Warren has basically been erased from the media. Talk about misogyny. The thing is that Biden can't really do much except make a decision so it all stops and explain it so all the women understand his reasoning.  But after that its the general which is worse.

The supporters of the blacks should stop pressuring Biden to pick up a black VP. That will hurt Biden, and it's sure he will be defeated. Biden should pick up either the Michigan's Gov Gretchen Whitmer,  or New Mexico's Gov Michelle Grisham.

For everyone concerned about Jor Biden feelings, I don't give 0 fucks. Biden will be the leader of the Democratic party, a sitting congressional senator is being targeted in the most racist &amp; sexist manner. He can't remain silent especially when the Black woman is defending him.
Disqualifying. Biden has an embarrassment of riches with the other women on the short list.
Biden's pathetic attempt at pandering to Black voters.
It is mystifying why  Biden‚Äôs campaign staff does not understand that fact. You are completely right
Biden is never going to announce a VP ü§£
Obama looks older than Biden lol
nothing like biden taking all of liz's ideas and not making her VP
Mike Pence spoke to hundreds of our brave law enforcement officers and Cops for Trump members from around the country who are facing a constant barrage of attacks from Joe Biden and the Democrat Party
Joe Biden all the way
News Analysisüîé#JoeBiden‚Äôs proposed plan ‚Äúto meet the existential threat of climate change‚Äù by achieving a ‚Äúcarbon pollution-free‚Äù power sector by 2035 proceeds from faulty scientific assumptions, according to policy analysts and a  physicist.
Biden Obama gave us arab spring , fast furious. Nsa.  FBI. Plane full of cash to Iran ,And a whole host of other shady deals #obamaGate
Yea I disagreed with them. Even though it was obvious Biden was going to win after Super Tuesday, I still think primary voters should have voted for whoever their preferred candidate was. Of course the pandemic through a monkey wrench into everything.
Vote for biden and you get this all over.
Because between this shit right here and the Castro thing, she would lose Florida for Biden. Scientology is a cancer in my home state, and Castro might as well have been Satan. Older Cubans hate him like we hate 45 and they always vote.
I was responding to her getting attacked by Biden supporters. Don‚Äôt know why you would think otherwise. Oh wait yes I do. You‚Äôre just looking to yell at anyone you disagree with. Have fun with that.
Well said Bill.  In reality, the only candidate running for pres. is Trump - people will either vote for him or against him.  Biden essentially is a non-entity.  Nobody decides that they're voting for Biden because they like what he brings to the table
I‚Äôm voting Biden regardless,  but with a lot less enthusiasm if he picks ‚Äúpraising crazy religions‚Äù person as  VP.    That‚Äôs a deal breaker right there.

Yea Biden and obama and not Trump- I‚Äôm agree re Musk and bezos- and believe they were grabbed for difft reason - to keep them backing DJT pol that enrich them
Do you think the ACA didn't expand access to healthcare? Or do you think Joe Biden had nothing to do with that? Or do you think Joe Biden has no other ambitions on healthcare?  Is someone lying to you and are you believing their lies? Where do you get these ideas?
Biden got 1% in Iowa in 2008, dropped out and was perfect Veep candidate for Obama.
You're missing one obvious point ... Maybe Biden wants to focus on the domestic dumpster that's going on so having a globetrotting VP/State team is what's needed to rebuild ties with allies.  He's certainly not going to be flying the 1M miles that Hillary did.
Except that half of Florida has  #TrumpVirus and Biden is leading by several points. You are the Minority. Please be the of the Silent ones. üôÑ
But even during the primary people were telling me to I had to suck it up and switch to Biden because he was ‚Äúmore electable‚Äù
I guess I'll never get to find out what a defined Biden candidacy looks like
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
"Joe Biden lies about wanting to increase the minimum wage" "Joe Biden wants to limit access to healthcare"  How did you come to believe these sort of assertions that are so verifiably false?
She is carrying Biden. We NEED Warren. #VPWarren
Biden announced his VP. It's official, and just who we hoped for: the girl reading this.
I get that you're using the "settle for Biden" argument against Bass. But the analogy breaks down because we are essentially in the "primary" phase of the VP selection process, not the general election.
With respect, I think a Hawkins/Walker administration would be in many regards better for me and my students than a Biden/Harris administration.
Biden doesn‚Äôt. Trump is the most incompetent, narcissistic, childish imbecile this country has ever elected. My only question is why it took so long for so many to see that?
A Florida teen was arrested in connection with a hack of 130 Twitter accounts, including celebrities like Elon Musk,¬† Bill Gates and Joseph R. Biden Jr.
Is this tweet sponsored by Biden's campaign?  Keep ignoring the woman running.  Sexist much?

I love  but I can't believe that any interview with Dr. Jill Biden could ever be a "great" interview.   One thing is for sure... her appearance on Fox News Tuesday... means that  won't be announcing his VP pick on Tuesday.
If the Biden campaign picks anyone besides Kamala at this point, white supremacy wins.
This whisper campaign against  has to end. I want an ambitious person to be VP.   How many times did  run for Prez ‚Äî isn‚Äôt  he ambitious? And we need someone who CAN and WANTS to run for Prez in 2024 if Biden doesn‚Äôt at 82 yrs old! #KamalaHarris #VPHarris
Americans know and trust Joe Biden. Joe‚Äôs also always been liked, admired and respected by his Republican colleagues across the aisle. We do want Joe Biden for President, he‚Äôll restore honor, dignity and order to the U.S.A..
Gordon Hayward is worse than Trump and Biden put together
This is all so nutty. We are rarely happy with VP choice. Never universally. It‚Äôs just something to yammer about pre convention. I am horrible at reading tea leaves. I‚Äôll be hyped if it‚Äôs Kamala and I‚Äôll buy more merch and stuff, but Biden 2020
In response to Joe Biden's plan to address housing inequity, Donald Trump attempts to stoke a racial panic.

To every Harris supporter who latched on to Biden instead of Warren, Castro, Sanders, Booker or pretty much any of the other viable Democratic primary candidates after Harris dropped out, this is the thanks you get.
Yes but Biden literally voted for DOMA
Joe Biden wants to end the era of big companies paying nothing in taxes
The details in the story are not pretty.   Demings spent her police career protecting and serving the Orlando PD as much as the people of Orlando.  The fact that it's a conflict of interest inherent to policing does not make it any less reprehensible.
Would you say you put more effort into preventing a second Trump term or more effort into advocating against Joe Biden?
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
FFS Twitter. Joe Biden is not picking crazy Scientology lady, nor is he going to pick crazy demon semen dr.  This is not Trump naming ‚Äòacting‚Äô cabinet positions. Joe will pick somebody trusted, experienced, smart, principled.   He‚Äôs picking Kamala Harris, mark my words
Maybe they know instead that if Biden picks a Black woman as VP, all the press will talk about from here on in is busing and "reparations."   It's inevitable, and there will be a number of "gotcha" issues designed to put Biden on the spot.
I'd love it if you could point out where any of us have said that Joe Biden is affirmatively good. I think I've been very clear that he's not. We're acting like a person who wants to expand access to healthcare is better than someone who wants to limit access to healthcare.
Not one mention of Biden in the entire article but like a lemming you just throw out the new catchphrases your masters spoon feed you.  But continue on.
By jumping on this and making it trend without yet knowing all the facts, we are playing right into the hands of the Republicans.  They are just beginning their dirty oppo-research against Biden.

14) I ask you as fellow women, plz let Joe Biden know we NEED to know unequivocally where he stands. We know his record on women's issues. We need to see those beliefs in practice that when he has the chance to root out misogyny/racism in his own circle, HE DOES SO. This matters.
&gt;one of biden's VP wannabes is a scientology supporter me: honestly. nothing surprises me anymore.
Actually on paper Biden has done more damage to 100s millions of Americans' lives than Trump, Then there's his poor judgement with Foreign policy.   Trump is an idiot, Biden is a good salesman, Equally as dangerous. His record proves my point.

How could Biden not want Warren's energy and expertise on the ticket? She's the best choice.
Before Kamala Harris dropped out of the 2020 election, she held the 2nd most Black support based on statistical data, and had the most congressional Black caucus endorsements. This target on her potential nomination by Biden old white dogs is problematic just like Biden silence.
Harris took a cheap and dishonest shot at Biden about busing. It was dumb to bring the topic up as well.  You guys really want busing back for Dems to have to defend?
Both DJT and Biden are racists and fascists. Follow that syllogism when it comes to supporters.
Really? Stop trying to tell us what life in the suburbs is going to be like under Biden, when it couldn‚Äôt be worse than what it is under YOUR failed attempts at being president.  What are you doing other than spending your days tweeting and watching tv????
OK I know that between Trump, Biden, and revolution, you would choose revolution. New question time. Between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, who do you prefer?

Biden winning is the sequel to The Irishman. Press conference on this matter to come.
Oh. Now, with a potential Biden victory, you start caring about the debt again. Great.
Interesting how the press is all but ignoring Warren-- the best and most popular choice by far, nationally -- and forcing Biden to pick a Black woman.  You trust this MSM to help Dems? After 2016?
Donald Trump has set the stage for a civil war
I'm staying home, Biden and Democrats need to get their sht together, Enough of this false illusion. Biden is going to be a disaster. Which is already proven from the platform negotiations early this week, Trading out Trump for Democrats polite version isn't changed.
Elizabeth Warren says 40,000 people are attending the grassroots fundraiser with Joe Biden.  It comes on the end-of-month fundraising deadline.
I've already told you I'm not a Biden voter so I'm not sure what the relevance is of that last sentence. But it's definitely not a "privilege" to expect different things from one party or the other when the parties have different platforms and do different things.
Biden will have a tough time understanding this. Its Good!
Can you read more than one headline? That same poll stated that  "Biden has lengthened his lead over President Trump in the latest Rasmussen Report. The new national survey finds Biden with 48% support among Likely U.S. Voters to Trump‚Äôs 42%."
Pole shows three million Americans think Joe Biden is slipping.  Merriam and Webster defines slipping as senile.
Biden needs Harris. She‚Äôs tough as nails and no BS.
I think the Secret Service is already working with Jill Biden to select new linen and drapery material.
12) They VOLUNTEER the most. They get others to the polls the most. They talk to their friends about the importance of voting the most. What those conversations look like from ALL women will be determined by how this situation is handled. Will it be "Joe Biden has our back!"?
the idea of picking anyone who is not a national household name seems nuts.  Biden is old.  The reaction to the pick needs to be "well that sounds like someone who could step into the job" and not "who?"
We‚Äôre not super far in to be fair but Biden seems perfectly healthy and sound, very far from the senile fading man that the GOP keeps trying to paint him as
My favorite is people who look at biden vs trump and go ‚Äúugh, these options suck.‚Äù  Like I wish I could live life just making choices between something I like and something I don‚Äôt. But alas, here we are, living and shit.
He's endorsing Biden?
Never said perfect. Just better. Biden is a joke üòÇ
You should tell Biden to control who old white dogs, not me.
11) Plz help Joe Biden grasp the potential consequences of this course not being corrected. KHive/women will still support him, but it will be less a vote for him than a vote against DT. This matters in the quality of that support. Black woman don't just VOTE Democratic the most
Oy, no, I‚Äôm down here now! I need to move and fast. Though I think Florida is gonna go for Biden.
Can we acknowledge that even though neither will bring our country in the right direction, they will not both bring our country in the *same* direction, and Joe Biden's direction is clearly less awful than Donald Trump's direction? Is that not obvious for some reason?
The Biden campaign better hope these smears were some 3D chess level strategy because this shit looks really bad if they do not pick Kamala.  CC:
Their attacks are more motivated by ‚Äútwitter‚Äù supporters of other candidates. The attacks on Kamala‚Äôs ‚Äúambition‚Äù reported in Politico was by ‚ÄúChris Dodd‚Äù (former US Senator) and today‚Äôs attack of Biden choosing a ‚Äúsafer‚Äù Black woman ... was from ‚ÄúEd Rendell‚Äù (former PA Gov) ü§¨üò°

One consolation...they will have to use a chunk to rebuild the part that‚Äòs already fallen down. Biden will be in office  before they get to use the rest.
Biden is already an accomplished politician, Good actor, undesirable legislative &amp; voting record. Anyone thinking Biden will make positive transformative changes is either naive or willfully ignorant, Then there are his obvious mental health issues.
I‚Äôve made no public statements about Biden‚Äôs VP, this is disqualifing.
Sick and tired of the tropes bandied about by white men labeling women, especially black women, as too ambitious, disloyal and rubbing people the wrong way (code for aggressive). Democrats need to remember that Black Women are the backbone of the party
What about the part where Harris sucks the way Biden sucked in 2008?
Forget about what transpired between Biden &amp; Kamala. Why would u not have issue with a man or men telling a female shes too ambitious? That's a disgrace for a woman to see no harm in that. Tell u something else...WE NEED MORE FEMALE LEADERS. WE WOULDNT BE IN THIS MESS
Not Biden‚Äôs choice. It‚Äôs Perez.
Biden cannot choose the underhanded Harris, he needs to restore integrity of the VP role, she can‚Äôt do that. Rice, Demings, Warren work. I would love Maxine Waters, but Biden gains zero from a CA running mate.

Have fun defending this and Bass' comments on Castro. Biden can kiss Florida goodbye if he were to pick Bass.  And not like she brings nationwide name recognition to the ticket either. Little upside. Rice, Lance-Bottoms, Harris, Duckworth, Warren &amp; Demings are all better choices.
That would be a certainty if Biden gets in.  Trump has done great things.
Earlier I mentioned #Bass; she was in Students for a Democratic Society in Cuba multiple times &amp; tried to "bring back the revolution" to the US. Apparently, not a disqualifier for Veep. But #Scientology (rightfully) is! Hey, whatever gets the job done.

Hey everyone, when Biden announces his pick and it's not the person you preferred 1) remember that you probably didn't prefer Biden as nominee either, and 2) chill out and keep your eye on the ball.
If Biden wants to go with someone other than Harris this whole horrible mess of the past two weeks have made it likely that if he now picks someone else it will cause a backlash.  I will have a very hard time with another choice because of the treatment of KDH.
8) Joe Biden needs to get a handle on this QUICKLY. He cannot wait two more weeks to deal w/it directly if he holds the VP the announcement that long. He needs to specifically denounce the misogynoir happening &amp; apologize for the fact ANY of it came from within his own circle

EXACTLY. "Biden allies", "party insiders", "sources close to the former VP" are all just stupid ways of saying ANYONE who had a prominent job as a Democrat in the past 20 years.  Surprised they aren't getting quotes from Leiberman to trash her with.

They sure do. I am unfortunately related to some of them.  South Floridian upscale jews who think he‚Äôs amazing for Israel &amp; think Biden is an anti-semitic socialist!
Yep, compared to Biden obviously because he's the worst candidate I've ever seen. I'm also not serious with my original tweet but it's funny seeing everyone get mad over the logic they've been touting.
5) KHive trusted Joe Biden w/our primary support. Day-by-day, as we see Kamala Harris be falsely maligned with no response from Biden himself, it makes us question whether Biden will stand up for us as President, if he does not even stand up for his friend and dedicated surrogate

He and his wife Katherine are liberals. He gave Biden over $600,000 so far
Do you want to talk about all the times Joe Biden voted to increase the minimum wage or are you also committed to the idea that Trump and Biden are equally bad?
Choosing Kamala Harris has Joe Biden's Vice President is a signal to little girls around the world...that anything and everything is possible.   When little girls look to her as Joe Biden's Vice President, they'll say to themselves, "that can be me."
Yeah, i think its Kamala, my friend. Look, no one is perfect. But we need someone who is tough, modern, young, and a contrast to the boot-licking dunce, Mike Pence. A lot of suburbans are worried Biden is past it and a placeholder for the next POTUS. They wont risk far left
The depth of talent in the Dem Party is formidable. So many great women to choose from. Whomever Biden chooses as his VP will have my complete support!!   And FWIW, I‚Äôm ok with anyone in the VP spot rubbing others the ‚Äúwrong way‚Äù.  Trump is a lapdog to every despot out there!
Stand up HOW? a Trade War that costs us billions+decimates farmers?Obama+Biden fixed wrecked economy from LAST GOP admin, gave healthcare to 30 million more Americans, protected pre-existing+contolled Ebola+H1N1.
I‚Äôve been working nonstop since early 2016 to stop trump. Frankly I‚Äôm exhausted. Biden dragging out the VP choice when I really need something to inspire me through these last 90 odd days is really horrible for me.
Biden is in on it. He should leave her alone if he doesn‚Äôt there to be his VP.
Guys can we nicely try to convince this guy to vote for Biden? üòÄ
If Biden wins he will be a historic President before even doing anything. VP to the first Black president. President with the first Black VP. Oldest President. And the first person to become President 32 years after first running for the office.
4 more years. #Trump2020Landslide #Trump2020LandslideVictory  #Trump2020 Trump2020 Or it's going to get really ugly.  You think this is bad?  haha...if Biden gets elected, you will learn what "bad" ir "ugly" is.
i hope karen bass becomes biden's vp so the 2020 election will have scientology angle and we get project chanology 2.0.
I agree. But I‚Äôm also thinking these people you site, and many I know too, aren‚Äôt going to make this election. It‚Äôs the independents and Hillary haters from last time that tipped the scale to Trump. Biden is not as hated, especially against Trump.
Did it worked painting Obama as a socialist 2 times? What did worked is America first vs globalists. Independents don‚Äôt buy that Biden is a socialist if they do they don‚Äôt view it as the extreme version of socialism more like the European version.
"Coalesced" implies coordination.   Clyburn didn't need to coordinate with anyone or get anyone's permission. He simply supported Biden, and Biden won easily.  In this context, the usage of "destroy" is virtually hysterical, implying that something nefarious happened.

Democrats shouldn't burn any bridges, especially since Biden still has a cabinet to fill.
4) We knew pundits would play the "not this black woman, that black woman" game to protect white male supremacy. What we did not foresee is Joe Biden quietly allowing Kamala Harris to be denigrated by any of his advisors, and that this would incur no consequences to them
You should tag  She‚Äôs the one in charge of what Biden sees
Does Joe Biden want the next 90 days to be about Benghazi, "Her E-mails," Scientology, and Fidel Castro?  I'm guessing... no.

Sick &amp; tired of white men pitting women against each other &amp; using old sexist, racist &amp; destructive tropes of Black women! They are not doing Joe Biden any favors! Stop now before Black women stay home! ‚Å¶ should quickly pick his VP!
I care about the communities that Biden and Trump will harm, which is why I put in the modicum of effort needed to determine which of those two ghouls would be more harmful. You do know that just because two things are both bad, they are not necessarily equally bad, right?
Isn't that the phase  is also in?  I mean, Bill is probably just nervous from all the news that just came out.  Biden just doesn't know where he is or what he's doing.
You mean the kids in cages under Bush and Obama? Those kids? How about Biden being notoriously anti-LGBT? The author of the 1994 Crime Bill that mass incarcerated black men for non violent offenses? The Biden that condemned rioters throughout Obama‚Äôs presidency?
White people think they going to lecture me on Biden, you must not know but Biden is only getting my vote because Trump gotta get the fuck out but don't misconstrue that for my support of Biden. I never liked him and never will. Biden was spoon feed this, he didn't earn shit.

Is voting to raise the minimum wage not good? Those are both things that Biden has done. If you truly believe that Biden is in no way good, then it would logically follow that voting to raise the minimum wage is not good.
Nice editing on Biden. Beto did go there (I don't know how much), but he's not the candidate. Biden specifically said otherwise, so, while the editor is brilliant, the ad is just propaganda.
But...you do realize Biden has to declare a running mate *before* the election, right? So we can‚Äôt actually vote Trump out before there‚Äôs a VP selection; that‚Äôs not how this works.
This person need psychiatric help ASAP. Biden will  choose a woman and President Obama will help him pick  that VP. STOP THE BS
Yeah Biden not willing to kill his supporters what a snowflake #TrumpkilledCain #TrumpLiesAmericansDie #snowflaketrunp
It would make sense if trump and Biden WERE the same but they aren‚Äôt and you know it and are responding accordingly so thanks for validating exactly what I said, I wish they had this much passion to actually go out and vote
Repubs for Biden are just closet democrats, just too afraid to admit it.
3) The campaign needs to understand if it condones racist patriarchal behavior, it will lose. KHive was riding for Biden before most, tho we understood Kamala may not be picked for the ticket. Our support wasn't contingent on that, though for some the passion of that support was.
This is not the time to start tweeting bs about Biden. VILE trump and his supporters will  pick it up and run. Stop the nonsense about who, what or it. WHY?? Do you want another 4 years of this thing?? I don't think so.
America falls for the looks mostly. If Biden becomes the president he will be the luckiest candidate in a long history...

Either Donald Trump or Joe Biden will be the President on January 20, 2021. Which one do you prefer?
With each passing day this continues I become more convinced that Biden is behind it. Only one candida is being att led like this. Biden could have stopped it weeks ago. That it has not stopped means he approves of it.
Or even *want* to do that. Joe Biden is a NeoConservative; he‚Äôd be appalled at the idea.
Harris is a conversationalist. After Biden is placed in the home she will as president engage us all in conversations. We should think about this and have a conversation about it. This may be better than her implementing crackpot Dem policiesü§î

He turned a religious service into a democratic stump speech for Biden. He has no shame. That was a vicious administration for 8 years which ended with a failed coup d etat that he allowed.
I didn‚Äôt. I did not support him at all. My pick was Kamala Harris. Actually, Biden‚Äôs polling numbers with African Americans is lower than Hillary Clinton‚Äôs back in 2016. His numbers will go up by choosing a Black woman. Not a Tammy Duckworth. She‚Äôs not about diversity.
Don‚Äôt people understand that mail in voting cannot work or be accurate. What if people really want to vote for Biden but their parents put trump down instead. And he wins. It‚Äôs not fair on either end. What‚Äôs stopping me from taking my neighbors ballots and filling them out.
2) These sexist attacks continue to be put forth by old white men around Joe Biden, and their old white men news buddies happily offer multiple media outlets on which to denigrate Sen. Harris. All in the service of making sure the black woman who's *too* accomplished isn't chosen
As I said, she‚Äôs a career diplomat. She only has foreign policy experience. Yes Trump as no experience. That‚Äôs why the country is a mess. Because of Trump, he branded Susan Rice. In addition, her son is a Trump supporter. That would be bad for the Biden ticket.
It‚Äôs just a compilation of Biden gaffes and not knowing where he is or what‚Äôs going on. Definitely President material in the eyes of the left wing
How is it not true? Have you not seen Biden‚Äôs mental decay in real time?.. Better do your homework!
Rich investors will be fine if Biden hikes taxes, UBS says #CrainsNY
The fact no one in the Biden campaign is saying anything about Kamala Harris being disrespected in this manner is revealing. Even if she's not his nominee, she's a formidable Democrat who's a qualified &amp; experienced Black woman. You can't be this silent, Black women are watching.
Please consider voting for Biden. It‚Äôs not about voting for him. It‚Äôs about getting trump out. If trump wins, the Supreme Court could overturn so much stuff that‚Äôs really basic rights to cater to the far right.
Bernie supporter always and voted for Trump in 2016.  Won‚Äôt make the same mistake this year. Out of question to vote for Biden, I am deeply digusted by what he represents. So abstention thanks for asking
Biden winning lol
I like Karen Bass fine but Biden picking her would be like Hillary picking Tim Kaine all over again.  No thanks. It's Kamala Harris for VP. It better be Kamala Harris
I think your leader, Joe Biden, told you it‚Äôs ‚Äútime to get real.‚Äù We‚Äôre all hostages to the 1%  in this BS 2Party system.  Time for Progressives to grow a pair &amp; break away!
No. It should be an African American female who represents the demographic that walks the walk for the Democrats, when it comes to voting consistency and voter turn-out. Biden won the Democratic primary due to Clyborn and the Black vote. Trump won because of BernieBros in 2016.
tbh i think it'd mean she'd be president in a few years, i'm like 90% whoever biden's VP is will be, because i feel he's not going to do four years
ironic that once he‚Äôs finally elected, President Biden probably won‚Äôt remember any of it
So considering that I just linked you to 8 examples of times when Joe Biden voted to increase the minimum wage, do you want to admit that you might have been wrong here?
Signed up for Biden's emails, which I'm already kinda regretting.  One interesting thing: I've got fundraising emails "from" most of the big name VP contenders.  IDK but I have a hunch they'll use that data in in the selection process as a proxy for base trust/ enthusiasm.
She was sh*tting on Biden during the entire campaign trail and his team didn‚Äôt forget
You got to the heart of it, Cindy! Biden needs to get us excited to do more than just vote with volunteering and donations- but we‚Äôre being turned off by petty attacks on a very worthy female VP pick and we have had enough of women politicians being attacked. üá∫üá∏ #KHive

Hmmm, All these Biden VP leaks that victimizes Harris. Tell me, are they singing all praises and no criticism for any other on the list?
Why is the media worried about Biden when Trump won't able to answer tough questions?  Or easy ones?  Or string two words together to form a coherent sentence?  #butheremails
And there it is!!!Why he sent stormtroopers Into Portland. So he can hold show fear in US. Ironically it is on Trump‚Äôs watch, this abhorrent situation happened &amp; he forced it to happen.This won‚Äôt happen under Biden. It happened under trump! Biden will absolutely handle it better.

is a liar
Wrong-o.  Several other polls echoing the same sentiment - Warren nets the most new support overall, in every demo, and in swings with undecideds. The numbers don‚Äôt lie, GOP is terrified of her and playing down her chances...

And u never will. These asshole pollsters know who to call. They‚Äôre slick. Trump is beating Biden hands down. America doesn‚Äôt want an old progressive president and a VP picked because the color of their skin. Skin color doesn‚Äôt qualify anyone. We saw that for 8 yrs before.

- There will be no change until after the election. At that point, either Biden will be president or Trump will be free to admit that he made a mistake and correct course. Even though Trump is psychologically incapable of admitting that he made a mistake, he may find a scapegoat.

Thank you.If Trump wins you will be miserable and if Biden wins you‚Äôll be miserable.Good luck with your negative life.I will be happy in the US or happy in Bermuda.üñïüèæüñïüèæüñïüèæ
And you wonder why Biden's not buying ads. He ain't gonna compete with this.
At this point I don't give a flying fig about Biden's VP choice. I just want Trump and his cohorts gone. Biden has a right to choose whomever he wants to. He was a great VP, he knows the job inside and out. He may pick Harris, Bass or Rice. We won't know until the announcement.
Tweeting won't beat biden.
If someone is "never Biden" then wouldn't it be reasonable to assume that they would be better off (or at least not worse off) with Trump? Otherwise why would you be "never Biden" rather than "never Trump?"
I've never seen a Vice President nomination process this ugly. Maybe because the front runner is weak, maybe because its black women leading the vp nomination, maybe because Biden had since March to pick a fucking nominee &amp; still he have to push back his announcement a week..ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
A teenager! A 17 year old from Florida has been arrested for his alleged involvement in a massive Twitter hack earlier this month that took over the accounts of prominent users like Joe Biden, Bill Gates and Elon Musk and used them to promote a bitcoin scam.
She has said over &amp; over that she will do whatever she can do make sure Biden wins, &amp; for her that might mean not being on the ticket, &amp; continuing to hold events/fundraise. I also find the framing of Biden ‚Äúusing‚Äù her or ‚Äúdangling‚Äù her insulting; she makes her decisions.
Now quote Chris Wallace when he said Biden has to leave the basement and answer questions. Lol. Fuckin hypocrites.
Obviously some people are afraid Sen. Harris will "outshine" Biden. They want someone they "Think" they can control. All BS! Kamala Harris connects easily with people and will bring professionalism and a vibe to Biden, which will be unequaled.
Wouldn't be the first time Joe Biden burned a black woman before.
Who posts shit like this? What are you talking about?
More of your Racist rhetoric, so transparent who you are. I‚Äôm thinking Biden landslide. #RepublicansForBiden
Please may God help you. As everything is against you. You are the only hope for america .biden is the end of america.
The Black women on Biden's team need to step up, NOW.    Biden needs to show leadership and rely on his better judgment, and the judgment of old white men who are intimidated by "ambitious" Black women.
No... No he hasn't, I don't know what  Sudafed induced visions you're having but you've lost your damn mind if you think Biden is left of anything
I‚Äôm not inclined to freak out about Biden‚Äôs chances in November but I am absolutely terrified of how much further back an incompetent Biden administration could ultimately set... everything lol
Biden wants to increase the minimum wage and he was instrumental in legalizing same sex marriage
10/1 Harris is Biden's pick for VP.
Now way, Biden is going to nominate a Karen in 2020.
Obama. And if progressives like Bernie hadn't fortunately tied his hands later, his and Biden's Simpson-Bowles commission would have made a "Grand Bargain" with GOP ghouls to cut Social Security and Medicare in order to balance the budget.   But this is about the 2009 recession:
I mean, like come on..this president skid mark hasn't won a head 2 head poll against Biden in like...4ever
Pretty sure your in a hot zone bozo. I would not feel bad if you contracted this virus, because you have no common sense for our nation and its health. Please just do yourself a favor and save the embarrassment of losing to Biden and Resign and stop your circus act. #OrangeManBad
Lmao nominating Biden gave the DINO republicans keys to the white house
If true, Joe Biden is clearly not the prudent choice for Democrat nominee!
A 17 year old was the "mastermind" of the attack that targeted and outsmarted the accounts of Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Kanye West, Bill Gates and others. Well it couldn't of happened to nicer people. LOL What goes around comes around. "KARMA" is so sweet!
Biden should have zero men doing his vetting for VP. None. Zero.  The sexism is absurd.  They are all wildly qualified.
though i like warren the best, there‚Äôs not a lot of generational/racial diversity among her and biden, which is kinda what we need. i think demings would be the strategic pick as with her, he could win florida.
teens: please don't steal my twitter account
He is going to lose so many votes if he choose Kamala Harris as V.P. I have talked with alot of both DEM'S &amp; GOP'S an they will not go with Biden if he does. It's very concerning. I'm not sure what would be left in 4 yrs. When Pete's sworn in.
Trump will run against the VP, not the white guy, because he thinks sexism/racism will help him win.   He's been signaling this for months (Biden is a puppet of the left, a Trojan horse, etc.). Who's hiding in the Trojan horse? Kamala, or whoever.
Biden VP search is so embarrassing for everyone involved, a great sign for how he‚Äôll do as president, a job that involves very few high-stakes appointments and nominations
I know where I stand politically as well. I also know that I don't stand with either Trump or Biden. As I said, I'd prefer your mailman. But your thinking here is stupid and dichotomous.
Go over at 2 am and steal all the signs and replace then with Biden 2020 signs. That should make them happy.
Karen Bass, Susan Rice Rise As Biden's Search for V.P. Nears End
I don't know what the old men are playing at; but it is detrimental to Biden campaign. He most likely want Sen. Harris and these stooges are trying to get Joe not to go with her.
WATCHU TALKIN BOUT BIDEN
I'm not convinced of this. We've never had a President run mainly against the VP before, which is what's gonna happen because Trump thinks sexism/racism will help him win. He's been signaling this for months (Biden is a puppet of the left, a Trojan horse, etc.)
Kamala is disloyal. Was supposed to be a family friend and drove a bus over Biden with a smear to win a debate. That's not misogny. Stop disrespecting women with this baseless rant.
Containing China starts with repairing broken alliances, Biden advist Tony Blinken tells Bloomberg in interview
The relentless, wildly racist RW propaganda is having an effect.
Stop camping for Biden
If Biden doesn‚Äôt get elected i hope they at least give him a show on comedy central.... not many things amuse me the way he does üòÇüòÇüòÇ
She‚Äôs wrong because there seem to a lot of undecided voters out there. Biden ain‚Äôt that exciting, folks, big newsflash!
Alt view: Given Biden's age, his VP pick is critically important, as she may be far more likely than  most VPs to assume the office of president.
Stop being so condescending. Do you think I‚Äôd contribute so much money w/o paying attention? How will getting into the criminal‚Äôs head help elect Biden.
oh how GREAT, we all get stoned out of our minds so we can be happy on the ventilator, TY SO MUCH  now we can all be as INCOHERENT as you and Biden!
SOROS, JOE BIDEN'S BIGGEST BENEFACTOR  DAs backed by Soros, other liberal activists join fray in clash with police  #FoxNews
Yeah, Biden sucks. This isn't a good 'gotcha'. 'Massive racist' might be an overstatement, there are definitely worse, but he doesn't have a good record. He's another shitty establishment dem.
Minimally, I think he‚Äôs going to do a bogus indictment of  Hunter Biden.
This man isn't on Biden's campaign. He's sniping from the sidelines. What the hell you want him to do?
Assuming Biden becomes POTUS, which I know we shouldn't count on despite polling and everything, I really hope he makes for a very boring one who predicts his interests long in advance, does no stunts, and where we'd need to tune in to hear to the White House.
None. Nothing could be worse than DT. It‚Äôs so far beyond Biden.
if you told me give up my next stimulus check or vote for biden, i‚Äôd give up the stimulus check
I sound like a broken record. DO NOT ASSUME THIS IS IN THE BAG. It's not. Donate time &amp; $ to #FlipTheSenateBlue. If Biden wins &amp; it's a GOP Senate, we're screwed. If the POS wins &amp; we have Dem Senate, he's impeached. DO NOT BECOME COMPLACENT. #VoteBlue2020 #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
House committee subpoenas Pompeo for records on Biden investigations
Notice, she hasn‚Äôt said a word other than to cheerfully and enthusiastically campaign feo Biden.
We don't want him to claim NY as his home, either.
Tammy Duckworth Wants to Know WTF Are We Supposed to Do With Our Kids During COVID   Biden! Please strongly consider Tammy!! She will help you win in a landslide!
the simplest way of putting it is that it's 2020 and we're still talking about Joe Biden.
Joe Biden Makes The Simplest Anti-Trump Promise Ever And People Are Here For It  #SmartNews
Will be virtual guest at upcoming DNC and endorse Joe Biden and tuition free public college.
The Obama camp‚Äôs tactic to manufacturer support for Biden officially begins tomorrow. Check weekend cable news shows and the parade of former Black Obama insiders of line. Holder and Jarrett just to name 2. They will be co-signing the Obama endorsement of Biden.
"I would never support either Trump or Biden because I actually do take Climate Change seriously!"
It's not even a little. Biden said he's choosing a woman. He wants someone to partner with and be ready on day one. That's his number one criteria. Someone ready from the go. No one else comes close to Warren on preparedness to be president. Not even Biden.
Will be virtual guest at upcoming DNC convention and endorse Joe Biden and endorse tuition free public college.
how about joe biden who in his past speeches is obviously racist
I hate the veep stakes, Biden can pick who he wants
"how much Biden's running mate helps him in 2020" is almost certainly one of the least important things about them
So Brent Welder, who lost to Sharice Davids after receiving help from both Bernie and AOC ‚Äî acted a fool and had a temper tantrum.  Nina Turner should answer why Our Revolution accepts dark money.
Vote for Biden. The Trump administration hates the post office. I find that to be bizarre, but it‚Äôs true.
Who Can It Be Now?  Biden narrows VP list, with Karen Bass emerging as one of several key contenders  via
And it goes beyond just Biden. You know that I'm a centrist who doesn't identify closely with either major political party. Fascists try to recruit me. Socialists try to chastise me for enabling fascism. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

What sort of American considers Trump less evil than both Hillary and Biden?
I would be thrilled w/any of the amazing women Biden is considering for VP. Proud of our party for having such a deep bench of talent.  Whoever he picks, we must unite in the final stretch. There is too much at stake for anything but unity against this cruel, incompetent fascist!
I want them to go away!!

James Murdoch is a Biden donor.
thank you for calling out Juan Williams our on his joe Biden ppe lie. We all know Obama and Biden left our ppe stock pile empty. Joe Biden claiming he will do better than  is straight up bs, Biden will do what he‚Äôs always done and that‚Äôs nothing.
Do people realize that the unsafe streets etc trump talks about has only begun during trumps presidency that during Obama/Biden there was none of these problems. That ALL the failure started during trump not before, not next year if Biden is potus, is trump really that deranged?
Stop it! It is unseemly to allow Biden‚Äôs VP selection to devolve into the bashing of these women, just fucking stop it!
If Biden chooses Karen Bass, it just gives credence to the whole ‚ÄúBiden is a commie‚Äù narrative.  The Fox headline will be ‚ÄúBiden Chooses Fidel Castro Loving Communist Sympathizer as Runningmate‚Äù for the next three months.
Those were the days in Cuba, once Biden and AOC take over,
ah ah ah so funny let‚Äôs wait for November; zero enthusiasm for Biden
I just made a split contribution to Kamala &amp; to  's campaign to support Joe and the other candidate's she supports and to demonstrate her fund raising strength. Join me today!
I didn't vote him and not sure if I can bring myself to vote for him in the general. But I live in NYC, so it won't matter. But Biden does not represent my values at all.
For sure. I'm not expecting Biden to lose - this time.
Very funny, creative, but probably not effective in persuading undecided voters to vote for Biden.
Hopefully McConnell goes down with Trump.  He backed this mentally ill,incompetent narcissist instead of voting to inpeach him. I hope him and all his colleagues in the Senate get voted out of office for allowing this dictator to ruin our country. Vote Biden 2020!üá∫üá∏
...voted for a Commie Party cand for prez. de Blasio was a Sandinista. This Bass chick floating as a Biden VP was a Fidel nut. Immigrants tend to be more understanding &amp; appreciative of US Constitution. Let's amend this so    &amp;  &amp;...
I really can't understand the "she's too ambitious" thing. Forgetting it's just plainly misogynistic, Biden's STATED goal is a VP who is prepared to be president Day 1. Doesn't that require maybe a smidge of ambition? Biden's "advisers" are doing a terrible disservice. Shameful.
New Yahoo News/YouGov poll: Most Trump voters say they will not accept the 2020 results if Biden wins because of mail-in ballots
"Biden only needs to win 3 battleground states to defeat Trump ‚Äì and he's leading in all 6."
Well claiming he 'created' it, is  disingenuous. Republicans were 'tough on crime' before the Clinton &amp; Biden came along &amp; started mass incarceration, but the crime bill def didn't help. I think it was a terrible bill &amp; I don't like Biden.
My dream ticket from the beginning was #BidenWarren2020 because they can appeal to moderated and progressive. Warren is the only one that significantly improve Biden‚Äôs numbers in the poll. However, there‚Äôs a need for representation of someone of color in the ticket.
Sure... But anyone can run in the 2024 primary, and have a credible case against Biden's VP if his administration disappoints.
The blackness here says all the other black women on the list has way more carte blanche in the black community than Kamala. Even her Biden attack on bussing was not in line with most bussed black American's experience. Susan Rice is from Chocolate City &amp; has cabinet experience.
Don‚Äôt believe the #CortesMyth that Biden is extreme. He listens to everyone, as he should and unlike #TrumpThreatensAmerica. The only person #Trump listens to are the ones only in his head. Gov‚Äôt needs to be inclusive, not exclusive and divisive like this autocratic prez
Didn't people say that Biden would rub people the wrong way for him to be Obama's pick.  Maybe slow down on the spin and let Biden do his thing.
If the way Biden has treated the potential VPs during this unreasonably dragged out, ultimately demeaning and insulting contest is any indication of how he will treat them in office, I don‚Äôt want any of these women to join his ticket.
A little reminder: James Murdoch gave big to Joe Biden's joint fundraising committee with the DNC last quarter. He gave over $600,000 to the Biden Victory Fund, close to the max amount one can give to that operation.
registering to vote in a swing state joe biden personally better come suck me off
Biden Warned that Trump would try to delay the election and people like you whined and whined about it, and it turned out that‚Äôs exactly what trump floated. He was right. You idiots who thought W would be a good president were wrong. AGAIN
This is the strangest  thing I‚Äôve read on the internet today. In no way shape of form should joe Biden have made an announcement after South Carolina.
Why or how could he when he had countless bluechecks on twitter hating? üôÑ  Its the blue checks who chose all the losers over Biden that have the most to say about the VP pick.
