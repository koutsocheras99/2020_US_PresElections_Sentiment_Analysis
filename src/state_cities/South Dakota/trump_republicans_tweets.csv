"Trump must deny the [RFS 'gap year'] waivers to help rural America. The question is whether he is willing to say no to Big Oil before November, or if he is waiting until after the election to give them everything and the kitchen sink."

Trump admitted that he failed to mention U.S. intelligence indicating Russia paid Taliban to Kill American troops during a call with Putin. He says he has ‚Äúnever‚Äù brought up the issue with Putin because he doesn‚Äôt believe the CIA.

Watch a Trump Covid-19 Press Conference. Usually carried on at least one major network if not all of them. It's not conservative messages that is being "worked against." It's false and misleading information (like don't wear a mask or masks don't help) that is worked against.
I still don‚Äôt refuse to believe that...Donald? Trump? Donald Trump was elected POTUS? It‚Äôs Biff from Back to the Future crazy world now! It spins my brain.
I‚Äôm fairly certain that just like Trump, he isn‚Äôt really concerned about the legality of anything. It wasn‚Äôt any different when he was governor.
Comparing a pro game to a casual home game is nonsense from the get go. Also, average NBA game: 48 minutes. Average 18 holes: 4 hours. This is neglecting travel time.   You clearly haven't been paying attention.
Pretty much. Left wing bigots. It makes them even more ticked off when a black person supports something Trump said.
I still personally don‚Äôt believe Trump had anything to do with this. What i find even more odd is that he bragged about how well the military did in this skirmish, but didn‚Äôt brag about how he authorized anything. Even if he didn‚Äôt , i‚Äôd expect that from him. So maybe.
I think Haley would decline. It‚Äôs Kristi Noem. She has no real career to kill. South Dakota isn‚Äôt going to elect her to squat after this Trump LoveFest lately. Our state isn‚Äôt immune to Covid.
Trump didn‚Äôt annihilate anyone, praise Jim Mattis for that order. The media did cover that.  Feb 7th when a mercenary group ‚Äúnot affilated with Russia‚Äù (totally was) marched against our forces in Syria?  Yep. What did Bonespurs MaGee have to do with that?
2nd time voting for a president and this time I get to choose between Biden, Trump, and JoJo. they're all deeply and heartbreakingly disappointing. Anyways, have a great day!
It most certainly was not a hoax. Trump‚Äôs campaign literally worked with Russia and Trump was receptive to it. Maybe Trump is turning against Russia after finding out or knowing about the bounties, which is great , but he‚Äôs just as corrupt.

I have no idea what the context was. Trump speaks in riddles sometimes. He's a stable genius a  3d chess player. Always 5 steps ahead..
President trump can talk for hours and make perfect sense. Biden can't even answer pre approved questions right. They just stick him in the basement.
Enough of them will come around. Every Berniecrat I know has no problem with voting against trump and seem more enthusiastic than those who are voting for Biden.
I dont hate the Obamas like people hate Trump. I've seen alot less tolerant people on the left than the right thats for sure.
Before COVID-19, I could‚Äôve listed many reasons why I was voting for Biden instead of Trump.  But now it‚Äôs easy. We need to get out of this mess. It‚Äôd be hard to convince me the things that Trump has done to try to beat the virus is working/will work.  Watch this 6-minute video.

Beware of a Cornered Trump | Washington Monthly
I think that‚Äôs the nicest description of Trump I‚Äôve read on Twitter! Kudos for not being a foul mouth like myself!
It is simple. Trump only cares about himself. He will do and say pretty much anything he thinks will lead to his re-election.
I still think Trump will win. I take no delight in this.  But whoever does 50% of this country will think it‚Äôs fake.
I'm not 100% confident enough people want Trump out, to actually vote him out. We haven't had a single term POTUS since George H.W. Bush lost in 1993

Veselnitskaya is involved to the extent she's telling the truth about the Magnitsky and thus intentionally makes it VERY clear what Russiagate is really about...  It's NOT just about Trump.  It'a a move to get rid of Putin by Khodorkovsky and the elites he's connected to. #322

Didnt know that. He should of done a book tour like mary trump. Since he has actually spent alot of time with Obama. Not a long lost niece hes barely ever met.
Idk I don't look at all their policies..all the other presidents have been white though. All I'm saying is trump did more for the black community policy wise, then Obama. That should tell you something.
Malik obama isn't trying to sell a book and has actually met obama more then once or twice. He flew to america to vote for trump lol.
That's not even true. He shipped millions of jobs overseas.. trump brought those jobs back.
Um yes you would think the 1st black president would try and look out for black people more. Well trump signed a prison reform that released plenty of poc.. not to mention black owned businesses went up by 400% and unemployment for everybody was at an all time low.
But they actually knew each other. Unless you have severe t.d.s nobody believes mary trump. What are the odds that she writes a book in an election year?
Trump must be the worst smooth talker and worst racist of all time. He days what's on his mind,smooth talkers tell people what they wanna hear.
No I don't trust obama. Mary trump and donald have barely ever met. She's just trying to make money. Story Daniel's huh? She just recently admitted to lieing about everything.
I think trump should go to Dallas.
The "Spygate" narrative involving literally repeating the lies of Bill Browder about the Trump Tower meeting.   Browder does this to smear both Veselnitskaya and Glenn Simpson.   NONE of this defends Simpon's work with Steele, which I'll discuss shortly.   But Browder has shills.
Trump‚Äôs Reactive Engagement  Could Biden match this?  Especially when he may be seriously compromised by China?
This is not the flu though, It is at least 10 times worse. Many other nations were able to contain it. Trump's not guilty of DeSantis' denial or Cuomo's flub on nursing homes. But he is responsible for not taking action to ramp up testing and other preparedness, and much else.
Related to the long thread on Russiagate I've done recently, a few cranks jumped in the "Spygate" lies about the Trump Tower meeting being some sort of "set up' by Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.  A polite, curious person asked for me to expand on this topic so this thread.
I was looking at a snap story. And this girl had a snap saying trump 2020. Then the following snap was a bunch of drunks falling over tables with their clothes half off. Yeah. That sums it up.
I think Twitter took my post haha. My parents are in NYC they are huge trump supporters. I struggle every day to not go out there in defence of my family. That's a lot of wait on my shoulders... I maybe a lot of things but I'm no coward and that creates conflict in my mind.
It is the wildest thing that Trump and team think this is a good narrative to push.
The reason that I can now still sit here and put faith in what he says is likely only because he has taken such a step back from this administration to the point of criticism from this administration. And of course criticism from Trump tells us he's (Fauci) to be trusted.

There's a lot in Derek Shearer's biography,  but let's focus two things that tie Derek Shearer's interests to the Trump Tower Meeting and Bill Browder.   See he's the director of the "McKinnon Institute" &amp; worked with Ziff Brothers Investments?
To recap: the subject of the Trump Tower Meeting was the Magnitsky Act, put together by Winer, Browder, Khodorkovsky who are all connected to other key players in Russiagate like Christopher Steele, Kerry, Nuland, and Sid Blumenthal.   But what about the Shearers?

Let's untangle this with a couple of undisputed facts.   The Trump Tower Meeting was about The Magnitsky Act and   Bill Browder is the public face and main spokesperson for the Magnitsky Act.   Nobody denies either fact here, including Browder.
In fact, there's been a very deliberate effort to make sure there are two FALSE version of the Trump Tower Meeting story.  There's a version for the Left / Democrats : Russiagate.   A version for the Right / Republicans : Spygate.  The person behind BOTH versions:
When I say EVERYONE gets the Trump Tower meeting wrong, let's examine both incorrect views quickly.   Russiagate / Anti-Trump : The meeting shows collusion between Trump team and Russia.   Spygate / Pro-Trump: The meeting was a set-up by the Russians.   Both wrong. It matters.
Why?  To understand that, let's look at Derek Shearer &amp; see how he ties DIRECTLY to major source of Disinformation in Russia.   The Trump Tower meeting.   Pretty much EVERYONE pro or anti  gets the Trump Tower meeting wrong.   It's crucial.   And connects to Derek Shearer.
But  we know the basics, factually.  The Shearer dossier came first.   Steele is brought in later.  Tthere's a lot of Information Laundering going on throughout the entire story that covers the real origin of Trump / Putin story with the people closest to the Clintons.  Why?
That means nothing though. Would anyone that was voting for Trump/Pence shift to Biden because of it? No.   We have big problems to address. We need to put a VP in that will bring as many voters out to not just win WH, but Senate and grow the House.
Yes, I blame all the Republican party officials from the top down. Trump is a big part of this, but the rest of them have all joined in. No one has done anything to stop this except maybe tweet a time or two. The disgrace.
Well, the USA isn't above that, but publicly denouncing Putin is an easy win for the Trump administration. The fact that he won't say anything is remarkably troubling.
President Trump has spoken out against allies of the United States, but not an "enemy" that pays terrorists to kill our brave service members?
You can't be serious. You must be exhausted from the mental gymnastics you do to justify Trump.
Wait until Trump throws at Yankee stadium to this ü§£ü§£ü§£
Stop with the nonsense and fear mongering. Trump has not started any wars he has actually ended the endless wars of the previous presidents. You're buying the media hysteria.
Just read about Target selling BLM items and allowing their employees to wear the T Shirts.  Tomorrow I am going to Target with my Trump Shirt and Hat. I am tired of sitting back and letting others make a statement. Wish me luck.
50 bucks says trump completely forgot he has a 14 year old
Sounds like she was all on board with Trump trying to ruin the lives of other people though. Since regretting her vote happened now.
It's a trap.  Anything that goes wrong will now be blamed on POTUS.  Now, he'll have no choice but to give Chicago every cent of Fed assistance they request.  The Democrats will get a pass on everything.  It's Trump's mess now.
President Donald Trump announced Thursday that he has scrubbed his planned Republican National Convention scheduled for Florida next month, citing a ‚Äúflare-up‚Äù of the coronavirus.
Since when is a 'tabloid' considered 'the press'? Everyone knows that crap is ficticious, though it does seem that tRump does believe its conspiracy theories.
‚ÄúThey knocked the hell out of him - that was the end of him,‚Äù Trump happily says to Hannity, ridiculing Ted Wheeler, mayor of Portland, OR who was tear-gassed by federal law enforcement last night during demonstrations in the city.
He is almost 80 yrs old. Trump would do it but those pesky bone spurs...
Turnberry scandal: NYT says the State Dept Inspector General looked at it. NBC News says report was concluded and then marked classified in May. Trump then fired that Inspector General in May. Report is now nowhere to be found.

Trump's path is being led in handcuffs into a federal pound you in the ass super-max... because that's where traitors and crime bosses go.  any headlines to the contrary are irresponsible journalism.
"The timing for this event is not right," Trump told reporters at the White House during his latest briefing on the virus.
They WANT to get it to DOJ and FBI to get an investigation started tying Trump to Russia and Putin.   So what's the problem?  They are too closely tied to  &amp;    They are KNOWN operatives.   This article is from 1999.
It's seldom talked about &amp; news stories like this get it wrong.  Cody Shearer created the FIRST dossier, with another close Clinton operative: Sid Blumenthal.   Cody Shearer's dossier was given to the FBI by Christopher Steele, too.   Let's go over this.
Trump calls off Florida segment of GOP National Convention
You should be ashamed to support people who destroy our country stupid ass. Trump is going to expose these perverts and criminals and you get to watch too. Troll. I‚Äôm as American as it gets and I see for myself the truth being exposed. Keep watching media cry as we expose you all
Watch live: President Trump holds a coronavirus briefing from the White House.
From Politico: "The aides, who‚Äôd been in proximity to Guilfoyle, were forced to quarantine in their Rapid City, S.D., hotel rooms for three days and barred from any face-to-face contact with colleagues as they pleaded with the campaign to get them home."
Rioters, looters, and arsonists are not protesters, they don't have a job anymore so they have a lot of time on their hands thanks to the Trump Administration. Peaceful Protesters are the people trying to get the attention of Washington DC to make changes.
It‚Äôs trump rule. I‚Äôm sorry to answer.

Make America Great Again Dump Trump
Your the one that will be squirming ...on Nov 3.... Make America Great Again Dump Trump
Trump supporters! This is your chance to Do Something!
I guess the good times of the last few weeks is over?  We are so screwed. Can we please have the election soon so we get rid of Trump?
Lots of Trump flags flying in Sioux Falls, SD; haven‚Äôt seen a single Biden sign. We‚Äôre an open-carry state, though.
He not only fails to take responsibility for his insufferable behavior, he wants us to feel sorry for him because he was on food stamps?!  His ‚Äòpassion‚Äô is about arrogance, entitlement and the assumption his slimy party will excuse him like they have with trump.

What are you doing today to oppose the Marxist led insurrection?   If you want the Republic to survive you must be actively with President Trump.   SD will not be safe if the left wins in Nov.   Get in the fight.

Trump Virus...own it Donald!       #TrumpVirus
Do you agree with the following statement?  I stand with Donald Trump in wishing Ghislaine Maxwell well.
Man...If only I had a job. Well played Trump. We can't contribute to  if we are perpetually out of work!
I love that they show events from Trump's America and say this is what Biden's America would look like.   I mean, projection is a thing but this is absurd.
This is literally America in 2020... and Trump is the President... idk if the dude thought about it before he posted something so dumb.
If he asks either Kamala Harris to be his VP nominee, I'll like Biden even better.  I like Biden because, compared to Trump, he's a ray of sunshine.
Thanks Miss Eva for putting together such a great list and I would love to jump onto this train. Please follow back and I Gotcha all! And retweeted
Democrats Made Trump's Goon Squad Possible!  via
Why would anyone want to be president after this dumpster fire...Trump is hoping for a brain aneurysm and Biden is just hoping to live through an entire 4 yr term.
This is literally Trump‚Äôs America. You complete tool. #GestapoTrump
I think SNL just found their new guy to play Donald Trump.
Umm it is currently Trump America good try when Joe is not the President
Donald Trump started a war against the American people when he mocked a disabled journalist. He loves attacking people, this is retribution.
This is not Joe Biden's America, this is Donald Trump's America.
Trump is such a racist...Not!
Well they don't want help they want their cities destroyed.. they will blame trump for it.
I have 12 dicks on my timeline, but in my defense I only follow those 12 members of the Trump administration to call them out on their b*******.
üíØ% God's to honest truth! You're ABSOLUTELY NOT a "Christian" if you support Trump. You're as phony baloney as he is.  Sioux Falls, South Dakota
Not sure you understand something real simple Boris.   This is happening now. Trump did this.
Because #tRump said so!
Wow #OneTermJoni sucks  she was castrating hogs when the  classes were held. #Phoneyjoni helped #tRump destroy Ag markets and #ethanol. #OnetermJoni has never had an original thought in 6 years, talking points is her Mantra.
The Democrats have a lot of chutzpah talking about Trump not accepting the 2020 election.  They have yet to come to terms with the fact that HRC lost in 2016.

It is written: "It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingsom of Heaven"  The rich are not welcomed by God, so Trump is pretty much out. Good job voting for sin :3

Random fact of the day.. zero people from the Epstein flight log support president trump...  I wonder why?ü§îü§îü§î
Republican silence implies complacency to Americans.  Trump deploys Federal squads to Illinois &amp; New Mexico under 'law-and-order' push to quell Freedom of Speech Rights.
Yesterday,  finally focused on women: Rep. Ted Yoho (R-FL) called  a ‚Äúfucking bitch‚Äù. ‚ÄúFreedom‚Äù Caucus attacked  for not being Trumpian enough. Trump sent good wishes to a conspirator who recruited underage girls to be abused by a sexual predator.
President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he will send federal agents into Chicago and Albuquerque to help combat rising crime, expanding the administration‚Äôs intervention in local enforcement as he runs for reelection under a ‚Äúlaw-and-order‚Äù mantle.
CNN thinking right now... somehow blame President Trump for it...
If trump wins that state by any less than 10 points it‚Äôs a huge step for Democrats
Get tickets to ride with the Young Republicans of SD on their barge in the Trump Boat Parade - Saturday August 8th on lake Okoboji!
#OneTermJoni is just parroting the #tRump plan, she has never had an original idea in 6 years. Chuck was taking a nap üò¥ and woke up to the payroll tax cut. Both are bad for #Iowa
Long before ‚ÄòTrump‚Äôs troops,‚Äô the U.S. Army attacked WWI veterans with tanks and tear gas
Are you looking for someone who will let riots and damage happen and then ask Trump for 500 million from the Feds?  Yeah, that makes sense.
Trump is dismantling the Democracy!
"I am voting for   He will not coordinate with these Senators or Russia. Today's reminder: DONALD TRUMP IS LETTING THE RUSSIANS KILL AMERICAN SOLDIERS &amp; LETTING CORONAVIRUS KILL AMERICANS."
All Trump‚Äôs fault
Um, isn't this how President Trump governs?
She will speak at todays ‚Äútask force‚Äù briefing that Trump will hold.  ‚ÄúSuccess story, etc...‚Äù.   Rolling out‚ÄòR‚Äô Governors that can speak rather than the doctors.  Either that or Trump is bowing out and Pence screening VPs. (3 electoral votes ü§£)
The same man who mocked a disabled journalist is now wishing an accused child sex trafficker "well." I hope the people who elected Donald Trump stop and think, he's not going to treat their children any better. He is a carnival barking clown.
Taking it seriously from the start and prompt response would have saved a lot of lives not to mention the economy. Trump messed up just admit it.
The one to blame for the deaths in the US is Trump. He was slow to warn America as to the best course of action to take for self-protection. He tried to keep it a secret. The SG told us not to wear masks.
I don't believe Trump will make a change. Pence has broad support among GOP leadership and is seen as stabilizing influence. And if Noem was being considered, she wouldn't be discussing it with the Vice President.
The Trump administration will pay Pfizer nearly $2 billion for a December delivery of 100 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine the pharmaceutical company is developing, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced Wednesday.
Those tax cuts will pay for themselves Phil.  Just like the ones from 2017.  Never mind that the national debt was at 19 trillion when Trump took office and is almost at 27 trillion now.  Trust me, they‚Äôll pay for themselves

Well another civil war seems pretty much inevitable at this point, dontcha think? If it doesn't go down this way it will be because Trump in desperation starts a war w/ China and/or declares some big blue states in a state of rebellion so they don't get EC votes, Senators, or Rep
Good talk though man. No name calling just people expressing their opinions..
Everything is bought.
What I mean by that us science can be bought.. to persuade people to think a certain way.
Literally millions of people have experienced it. Something they can't explain so they don't bother trying.. new age religion.
Oh I know they're just trying to dumb down people. All those chemicals and fluoride.. keeps you docile.
Trump can‚Äôt have her talking
But you don't really know that. Nobody knows what happens when you pass.. do you believe in ghosts or demons? Do you think it's just really bad energy?
There is literally no way to prove that. You don't know.. nobody can proof that.
Ok your evidence is basically the murderers admitting their crimes.
I think there's some things the human brain can't comprehend so I'm not even gonna try. There's just some things we cant figure out. So I'm not even gonna try.
There was a guy who worked at the 1st tower  who testified on the 9/11 commission along with others that said about 15 seconds before the planes hit there was an explosion in the basement.. not one word from the media. Why would he risk his life to say that?
Because they were going against the official story that the media and politicians dont want people to hear.
It has been. Whistleblowers and people set to testify but magically died right before they could.
I'm not a big fan of organized religion but I'm not gonna say their is no god. There's some things science cant explain. I believe in positive energy and frequencies and some kind of after life.
Presented by who? The guilty party?
I'm good with my beliefs.. I have looked into things that's how I got my beliefs.. I don't blindly support anything I question everything.
For no reason? Ppl don't silence you if you have nothing to say.
You say unsupported but what are they gonna say?... ok you caught us. Our bad we promise we won't do it again.
Well they all connect. If they can lie about one thing they can lie about other big things. I don't believe everything just the things that make sense. It was an excuse to start wars. Oil,military complex, drugs,precious metals.. all those lifes for a lie.
You mean scientists who work for the government? It's like letting the murder's investigate the crimes. If you dont go along with their story they will ruin your career..
Yes 10k non goverment bought independent scientists.. what reason what they have to lie. They would be targeted for going against the official narrative. Theres a huge death trail with 9/11 also.
Even the goverment admitted it... because it was so far fetched not even they could defend it.
In the same day. That has not ever happened in history. Or how one plane was aloud to leave on 9/11 bin ladens family. You would never guess who they were talking to... marvin bush... how many coincidences do you need before it's mathematically impossible?
That caliber bullet could not do that. There have been multiple whistleblowers and even the goverment admitted it was not a lone gunmen..
There's no way his caliber rifle could have done that kind of impact. His head literally went the opposite direction as the alleged gunman's bullet..
