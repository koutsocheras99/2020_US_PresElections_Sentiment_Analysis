”I don’t want to be waiting around for weeks and months and literally, potentially if you really did it right, years, because you’ll never know,” Trump told reporters.
Trump has made America a failed state. Millions of unemployed. Over 150k dead from a virus. Erosion of checks and balances. Nepotism that would make Roman Emperors blush.
Trump because I want peace and prosperity in the USA . Not for it to turn into a socialist💩hole with whoever the DNC hand picks to be president after they finally declare Joe Biden unfit for public office.

Any #GOP Senator (aside from Romney) who says they oppose this effort postpone the election are the same GOP Senators who refused to remove him for extorting Ukraine to help him win the election. He’s gone from cheating to postponing—and they helped. #Trump #WeWillVote

Let's talk about Trump's call to suspend the elections....  via
TRUMP says we need PLASMA
so i just realized if we push back the election the speaker of the house becomes the acting president effective at the end of the term. so even if trump manages to usurp power and push it back he still would only serve his term until duly re-elected.
Wow. Racist _and_ undemocratic. What more could Donnie ask for? Throw in misogyny and it’s the Donald Trump trifecta!
Trump Floats Illegally Delaying Election
I must’ve missed the part where Trump made America great.
This idea that Trump can’t do it completely misses the point. He’s an an autocrat. Not only do the laws not apply to such men—they decide what the law is. It’s the whole point. As Hermann Göring put it: “The law and the will of theFührer are one.”

Psssst.... not sure if you’ve heard, but there’s a virus going around that’s responsible for some of that.  And some trashy ass far left idiots responsible for the rest.  But I’m sure mentally ill people will blame Trump.
"We can open schools in a way that protects the health of both students and teachers".  I agree  - delay face to face until we have a vaccine. I mean, even Trump thinks face to face events are risky so he wants to protect all of us by delaying the election, right Doc?
This is a nice sentiment. But.... I highly doubt many teams will. Schools need money, and alienating  potential donors doesn't seem high on the wish list. I recall a certain coach railing against Trump and the backlash that followed.

President Trump is betting against that outcome in asserting that the economy will undergo a V-shaped recovery in which last quarter’s plunge would be followed by an impressive rebound in the current quarter
You’ve got to be more sick than trump to think we believe that!
I can’t help but think #Trump would do anything to keep us from talking about how his narcissism and incompetence led to the country’s worst economic drop EVER. So please, don’t talk about Trump presiding over the worst economic drop EVER! #TrumpDepression

Assuming that other races cannot live in the suburbs is racist. Vote Trump, even if u don’t you’re still black (play on words of what Biden said😂) also he has brought more jobs to multiple ethnic groups than any recent president. All the violence in the US is caused by liberals.
You assuming other races are incapable of living a suburban life style, also stating that trump in the 70s not giving housing to those ppl shows the lack of information have. Those ppl could not afford the housing, also you would not be the same person you were 20 years ago.

He is a super racist that hired black executives in the 80s and a woman to run his entire engineering department for Trump Tower, soooo racist. I’m a Democrat and I can at least criticize Trump for factual things,  he hired Black people when it wasn’t trendy or cool.
A white supremacist it hires black executives in the 80s when it wasn’t popular to run his organization along with a woman who oversaw the entire engineer in department for Trump Tower. Super racist, 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️

Well let me explain to you something I know you won't understand unless you are a scholar of the Holy Bible. Trump is like Cyrus. Trump was Chosen to be President God has a job for him to do Prophets said Trump was next President as far back as 2000. Most noted one is Kim Clement
Trump isn't God Almighty you act like he is always expecting him to do everything an then blame him for everything you think is bad. Y'all are idiots 😂
PONZI schemes. They  are gaining financial and popularity by hating on Trump. They are getting money for lying. after Nov, we will get our pay back. But they hv to live with fact they walked out on Repubs and now support chaos, fires, bus in burning, murder, collusion and Biden.
Btw Matt. That was sarcasm. Trump sucks; Biden 2020
Trump is an all around loser. He let's Putin target his own soldiers overseas. He may as well send Vladimir a Thank You Card. Does absolutely nothing. He certainly ignores Intelligence Agents, and Health Experts, though. Leading to 147,000+ deaths. A real Menace #TrumpleThinSkin
LOL. 3 BROS, AINT WORKING!   independents moving to support the president,  That enthusiasm included some 300,000 supporters who opened their wallets last Tuesday and pumped $20 million into Trump’s campaign  This trend toward Trump is also showing up in registering new voters.
Yep GOOD TIMES!  With independents moving to support the president,  That enthusiasm included some 300,000 supporters who opened their wallets last Tuesday and pumped $20 million into Trump’s campaign  This trend toward Trump is also showing up in registering new voters.
Lol. Yeah pretty insane!  independents moving to support the president,  That enthusiasm included some 300,000 supporters who opened their wallets last Tuesday and pumped $20 million into Trump’s campaign  This trend toward Trump is also showing up in registering new voters.
It really did strike me as fishy at the time. Trump announced it so soon after the news of Fauci’s invitation. Pure Trump jealousy and narcissism. And a relief to know the Yankees didn’t actually invite him.
Trump Needed to Be Told Republicans Were Getting Sick to Take Action on Coronavirus, Report Says
Trump, you don't need anyone to help you look bad. You do a terrific job of that every single day. You big Dummy!!!! #TrumpleThinSkin
Rep. Swalwell on new information showing FBI spied on Trump: ‘They were right to do it’  Spying id illeagal. And it ain't thin skin, it's CALLED pissed off that Democrats can get away with spying.
But to come out and say Trump will lose the election if we don’t wear masks? I think he’s a Trojan horse for the deep state..
President Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic put his political fate in grave jeopardy. Now he’s hoping to get credit for his administration’s aggressive push for a vaccine -– and crossing his fingers that one gets approved before Election Day.
They'll do some spin on how that is not ANTIFA, it's some sort of right wing terrorists that hijacked it, and pose themselves as ANTIFA to boost Trump's chances of re-election.
Shame on you Nicole  you knew this all along! LOL If you really want to know where Trump learned everything he knows about Covid19 just watch this episode of "The Dead Zone" Plague (TV Episode 2003) - IMDb -   It's like frickin time travel man!
I didn’t know Tricky Dick Morris was a Medical Einstein with 10 PhD’s. This asswipe just said “If you want Trump to win, Wear the damn Masks”...WTF ???
Dumbest comment on twitter. Casual racism? Pointing out facts are always racist according to libtards like you. Do all libtards hate Trump so much they are willing to tear down the entire system just to avoid his re-election.
Not sure that would even break the top 25 list of Most Trump Things Ever
Time to donate to her opponent.  Fuck that shit.  You're either with us or you're not.  She just declared for Trump, as far as I'm concerned.

you’re 100% correct... The thing that gets me is Trump is in favor of continuing the UE benefits as well as another round of stimulus checks. I’m totally confused what McConnell and company are trying to accomplish.
They called and asked me for money a while back I told them would never give one penny to Republican politicians only give money to the Trump campaign.
Americans are not stupid. They know these protests and mayhem are intentional so all deaths and casualtys can be blamed on Trump. Americans know what is happening and will vote accordingly.
this is the love-child of trump and stormi daniels

President Donald Trump has been using the Rose Garden a lot more lately to make statements and hold news conferences in the age of the coronavirus. The first lady also hosted a state dinner for Australia in the garden last year.Oh let’s look at a recent example. Defense bill is also veto proof. Bipartisan. Trump HATES it. He doesn’t have to sign but it will become law. He is powerless. So will Trump take credit for removing confederate names from bases?
Really then why r u all still so butt hurt about not being able 2 put him and his enabler wife back in the WH? Also so excited about putting Biden in after 8 years of  doing nothing against Epstein? Pick a lane.Barr is a lapdog but goes after JE if it could hurt trump. Idiots
Bayou Brief: Trump Trumps Trump | First Draft
Oh really 🧐  I follow things fairly closely. Trump apparently dabbled with underage girls on occasion (see palling around with Epstein, and charges filed by then 13 yo girl against him).  Quite frankly, I do not believe you. Just a made up lie for the MAGGSfolk  Links ?
I can bet you would do the same to save yourself. It’s literally obnoxious that you can’t fathom trump also being part of it- trump likes 13 year olds...weird you support that bro. Go look up the 24 women that accused him over a 30 year period.
Right On,Dump Trump,He is not a example at all,He gotta go,For all people in the USA sake,Trump has no empathy at all,Just like is racist Father Fred Sr.which whom created the monster👹
Herman Cain is dead. Trump you are the one to blame. Hopefully Herman Cain death will open y'all eyes that Trump cannot run this country.
Donald Trump traveling around spreading COVID one old black man at a time seems a little too scooby doo villainesque even for him. And yet ...
Why would me staying married put Trump in prison?
Trump is doing exactly zero about child sex traffickers. Remember, he wished child sex trafficker Ghislane Maxwell well. (Coded message to keep her mouth shut &amp; a pardon is coming her way after the election. Else he will have her killed like Barr did Epstein).
Like the torturing of innocent brown refugee children that Trump started ? These are REAL CHILDREN not “unborn children”.  Being OK with Putin putting bounties on US military.  Killing 154,000 Americans with his various Pro-Death policies, and much more.
Almost forgot. Trump wanted the wall to help stop the trafficking from Mexico. Dems fought him tooth and nail.
We also have never had a President threatening to not leave. We have always had peaceful transfer of power.  Trump has made it clear, he’s not planning to do that.
I really hope this is the case but I think we are jumping to conclusions. The Trump vote is undercounted. Rasmussen polls, the same ones that showed him losing the election by two points in 2016 are showing him within 3 now. Rasmussen was actually the most accurate poll in 2016
Another one for you.   Do your own research. I did.
You read about trafficking arrests around the globe every week now  This is just the first couple of articles I found.
Im not sure he ever really left.  And I’m just really happy he seems to be here now. Trump is acting increasingly like a cornered rat.
Is Trump the second coming of false prophet Jim Jones? Thousands of Trump followers are dead today because Trump led them to destruction. Now Trump want to postpone the November election lol. I can't wait to vote against Trump.. the tooks about false prophets. Trump is here.
And no Trump may lose on Nov 3rd but he doesn't leave until Jan 20th. Morons. God our school systems suck and you cannot blame your ignorant asses on Trump..lol #EvictTrump
If Trump is guilty of ‘Killing’  Herman Cain with Covid   I stand here accusing the Democrats as guilty for the spread of Cancer and in short  order Killing  2 of their own  Elijah Cummings  John Lewis
Vote Donald Trump for President 2020!!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
#TrumpHatesScience is a laugh. And blaming him for 150000 deaths is a bigger laugh. Get a life people. You think it's Trump supporters filling the beaches and bars? Having COVID19 parties? Denying patients the right to choose their treatment? Banning DR'S sharing treatment ideas?
Trump don’t want people kneeling bro.. cause he see that’s bringing people together against his racist ass..
Trump leads thousands of his followers to death. Trump told Herman Cain wear a mask it you want to. Cain decided that he wasn't going to wear a mask because Trump wasn't wearing one. Now Mr. Cain is dead. We blame you Trump.

It will backfire severely on the Dems combined with the Barr hearing. Comparing Trump to Bull Connor?
Here’s the Democrat’s play for 2020:  They set up a potential narrative of malfeasance.  If Biden wins : “look! We avoided a problem”  If trump wins: “see we told you so!!!”, And it’s another phony Russia-esq narrative for another 4 years.
They only guy he believed Trump was worth his life. That really is too bad.
Jesus Christ. These people are absolutely sadistic. Sociopathic. Stop fucking voting for republicans. And do not tell me Trump Kushner ey al arent “real republicans.” They are republicans, stripped bare.
I don’t have the language to express my feeling for trump
Trump has been doing this since his first day in office. What were you doing about #EndHumanTraffickiing   during your eight years in the White House? #uselessjoe #Trump2020
Trump is freaked over mail-in voting. He’s trying to shut down the USPS.
A Trump donor and crony.
Trump banned Epstein and Maxwell. Trump is only person who helped the prosecutor with Epstein’s only conviction. I guess news media didn’t mention that? And Trump is the reason Maxwell is currently behind bars awaiting trial.

Trump said
When trump thought he would lose to Hillary in 2016, he said the election was rigged. When he shockingly won, we realized he was right. This time, Biden will win despite trump’s attempt to rig it again. We have learned.
I love how the media will report something President Trump has said and add that there is no evidence for his claim. I don't think I have ever heard that done so consistently before Trump - and they ONLY do it for Trump. Even Fox-News does it, as they did today on voter fraud.
No matter, in the end they will all climb aboard the trump train no matter what direction it heads.
I agree with the gloomy forecast of what may happen when Trump loses. He'll have to be dragged out of there.
Went from being surrounded by intelligent, radical, beautiful Black people to the land of Trump and Alabama state flags on lifted pickup trucks.  I hate it here.

Let’s be honest ppl. Trump did this same tactic in 2016. Called the election rigged. Said HC was stealing the election. Then he won the EC but lost the pop vote. Next he said millions voted illegally. Could not prove it. Now back to this crap again. This conman has to go!

Some republican states could sit out backing Trump, BUT first of all, DeSantis immediate response to refuse is telling—granted he knows he’s endangering voters who are already under siege w coronavirus, but that statement is pretty telling, IMO.
and he drives a Prius. But his wealthy counterpart who dodders around in loarfers and pastel polo shorts with his little doggy is a classic republican stereotype. He tried to defend Trump, but finally conceded “he’s a big ol mess, idnt he? It just don’t look good.”
I live on a golf course. It’s 80% old white men who ride around on golf carts gossiping. Very republican. I overheard two of them sounding pretty rock bottom. One was fully opposed to voting Trump &amp; called him a disaster. He may be a Democrat anyway—he’s not from here originally

Nobody wants oil rigs near Florida's beautiful beaches. But the Trump Administration still plans to drill off of Florida's Gulf Coast once the Eastern Gulf Moratorium expires in 2022. It's time to permanently ban drilling in the Eastern Gulf.
America,  Apparently, Trump never read the constitution he swore to protect....  so ignore his tweets today.
Again love preIt always will if we just let it. We can’t let our beloved democracy remain in the hands of a man so full of hate, anger &amp; bigotry that he seeks to destroy it from within bc nobody likes him. Trump doesn’t care about us or our country. He’s incapable. #VoteJoe
Even if you vote for trump you still a nigga in a suit -
Trump REALLY loves getting people killed. Yikes
I need you to know I’m returning to where I was eating when trump took the election and we’re all going to do the same things we did then and reverse this curse. I encourage you to try your own witchcraft
Do We Like Trump ❗️Vote 👇
And *this* is what finally turns Calabresi off from Trump?  Please. Spare me.
It astounds me that the left and media herald Fauci while simultaneously denigrate Trump for the Coronavirus response.
Just imagining Trump giving a eulogy and somehow managing to turn another person’s funeral into a rant about all his grudges.
Amazing to contrast Trump's anti-democratic talking points to with the talks to John Lewis' funeral. One group of people activity fighting to protect our democracy - to honor a man who was willing to die to for it. The other group, trying to sow seeds of doubt in our democracy.

Lol!! Notice how this woman puts in a comment about Dems. Like it’s Dems that want to postpone the election. IT WAS TRUMP WHO MADE THIS SUGGESTION AND NOT DEMS. This is the very definition of gaslighting!  Vote ALL Republicans out in November.
The Trump White House after Obama’s speech.
Trump can’t change the date of the election and Calabresi knows that. He’s just a last minute escapist, getting off the Titanic before it sinks. I’m happy that he’s abandoning Trump but he can keep his flimsy justification.
Trump's tweet this AM was not surprising and I don't think we should be giving it attention. Instead, we should be talking much more about how shameful it is that he doesn't think it's a big deal that he's the only living president that didn't even attend John Lewis's funeral.
Who said anything about Trump?? Who's the paranoid one now?!? LMAO
Republicans openly challenge Trump's tweet on delaying election.  THE GOP HAD THEIR CHANCE TO RID US OF trump AND  THEY DIDN’T...NOW WE DON’T WANT THEM OR HIM NOW!
Watch Live: Trump to hold press conference
Truth !!  I knew Donald Trump was utter scum almost 3 decades ago, when I was a registered R &amp; he was a registered D.  BTW, Fred Trump was arrested during a KKK riot in NYC. Donald has continued his father’s racist tradition.
Our lives have been turned upside down because of Trump
All I can think about is him cheesing at the Trump rally. 1 less
Lol, everyone has a turning point, but Trump has none; no bottom.
thing is, at the end of all this there's still a good chance that trump will be responsible for fewer overall human deaths
Herman Cain no longer has value to Trump, so he will be erased.
Boy, and u think the trump years is full of racial harmony? Trump is the most racially divisive president in history.  Obama did what Lewis would have wanted him to do. Sorry if u don’t understand that
Trump is too effing ignorant to get them, someone will have to explain them to him.
When are y’all going to wake up and look around you.  Trump is killing our citizenry, our economy, our military, and now he’s trying to kill our elections
I love it, just absolutely committed to being a no-argument simp. I already scrolled up to see if there was even a kernel of anything specific and there’s nothing there. Just a formless assertion that Trump’s tweet was conjecture without any follow-up.
That was not a funeral service, that was an anti trump rally
North Carolina Deluge of Absentee Ballot Requests Shows Why Trump’s Terrified of Mail-In Voting.  FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS...?  NOT IN trumps OR THE GOP’S (GROSS OLD PARTY) PLAYBOOK!

Crazy Trump trying to change everyone's focus from Trump and his Trump rally killing Herman Caine by saying crazy things. You have become predictable and boring Mr.President.
Has Trump tried to help this US soldier in the face of Russian politically motivated injustice? If not, why not?🧐
Voters should request mail ballots 15 days before November 3, USPS says.  COUNTERING trump! - Business Insider
I see it! I just want to know who did his make-up today???
For those out there putting down ppl not having graduated college, Bill stopped at high school.  All billionaires are not master thinkers. Most don't have common sense. That's where the hysteria began bc Trump has it all!
Trump is a profoundly evil human being is multiple ways. From treason to racism to sexual abuse to sadism and more, he is evil in every way.  Those that support him endorse his evil.  No true Christian can knowingly support such evil.  The goat Christians will drop in # soon.
what did he expect to get nasty comments? he’s a trump supporter
when did tRump say that? before or after he praised the confederate statues or said there were good people on both sides of the white nationalist murdering a protester?
Or, more akin to his petty juvenile style, deflect simply from Obama’s eloquent, touching, inspiring Lewis eulogy that made trump look extremely gd awful.
Man you really bring everything back to Trump dont you? #biasedmuch?
I’ll save this tweet for the inevitable follow-up from Trump where he doubles down on wanting to delay the election.
Compare Trump’s America First to this👇👇👇
Can you imagine. Trump will get up there and start complaining about Hillary and Obama and how unfair the media is to him. Before you know he will have people thinking Trump is the one who died .

is it technically correct to say that trump killed herman cain
Right now on  's site,there are 23"articles/story captions"(on top half main site).8 are about Trump, 9 are negative.Obama makes 1st appearance in a year and the headline, "Obama gets standing ovation for John Lewis eulogy".It's not about Obama or Trump- it is blatant bias!!
this is from Project Veritas. Right wing group known for making fake videos. I hate trump too but it's clear why they used a video of him in a mask so they could do the voiceover of him saying anything. Surprised they did it to trump tho and not Biden.
Needs to be one speaking to those who listen or are tempted to listen to Trump. Sounds like a  charge...
He’s dead because of his loyalty to the crazy GOP party and ignorant Trump outweighed common sense to protect his own health!
I  had tears coming out of my eyes today when I read all anti trump people writing that Herman's death was caused by us.
how in the he’ll you’re in office with your criminal record!  I forgot your criminal impeached Trump have you a pass. Georgia do better!
Blame the right culprits. Trump Trump Trump Pence Pence Pence GOP GOP GOP they allowed this virus to kill Cain and  over 150000 innocent Americans that died due INCOMPETENCE IGNORANCE and POLITICS
Trump says nuclear proliferation is scarier than climate change. He's failing at both.  interviews  assistant professor of history
Make no mistake  Democrats are evil. They've traded their humanity 4 the lie of communism which is from Hell. Zero conscience I've seen the progression on Twitter. When Trump got elected, suddenly it ramped up 300%&amp; steadily gotten worse The unrepentant evil displayed is terrifyn
trump supporting a doctor that thinks alien dna and hydroxy should tell you all you need to know.
So VERY True for all Trump supporters 🥺
Donald Trump suggests delay to 2020 US presidential election  #SmartNews
Informed all on FB if you support trump unfriend me now !
You must be delirious. Trump has brought the USA down to third world status in a free fall. He is NOT A LEADER AND NEVER WILL BE!
Didn’t you just write an op ed about how ridiculous it was that Biden said Trump would do this?   How is the media so ignorant about Trump? Everybody schmuck who has been paying attention knew with 100% certainty that Trump would be floating the idea of delaying the election.
I imagine a lot of rank &amp; file grunts are Trumpers, but the Pentagon brass despise him. Their order to forbid the Confederate flag at all military installations was widely interpreted as a message to Trump that they are not behind him, &amp; would not support him in that event.
So we gone act like Trump hasn’t said anything racist and did cause thousand of Americans their lives and hasn’t had sexual assault cases?
He might, but not because he is Biden.   Democrats could have run a wooden chair for president, and they would have voted for it only because it wasn’t trump.
2015 - obama is pretty cool huh guys 2016 - social democrat aka i like norway 2017 - who cares about politics schalke are playing well but trump bad 👎 2018 - tankies make me angry 😡 ooooh who's this aoc girl 2019 - democratic socialist, revolution bad  2020 - just socialist idk
And the head are religious nuts.  Trump is the distraction.
They, the democrats, create the problems, then blame Trump! We see you chuck..🥸🤡
Hell no we are not delaying this election ! trump must go ! There is not a dictatorship in America ! Impeach his arse now ! Along with all his appointees who are so unqualified to serve the US
All you idiots must go ! A Houston doctor whose anti-mask and pro-hydroxy speech was praised by President Trump and his son, Donald Trump Jr., also believes that alien DNA is used in medicine and gynecological problems are the result of people having sex dreams with demons GTFO!
I'm absolutely ready. Just remember when we're throwing Trump's fat ass out of the White House, lift with your legs not your back.

Here is Trump’s budget. Line G is the program that Adams has to rewrite ($85M). As you can see there is a $0 for FY20. You can’t try to kill something then take credit for it living.
Personal benefits?? I’d give both a kidney and a lung to not have any more trump appointed federal judges. It sounds like you don’t like Adrian and that’s ok. But he is still our best chance to have a senator who is a democrat.
Trump would get blasted for weeks if he did this. #DoubleStandard
This week Trump urged all states to open up, but voting needs to be postponed in November? He's insane.
Everyone uses this article but it doesn’t mention that in the FY20 budget, Trump zeroed out the program. Alma Adams &amp; Doug Jones pushes Congress but it ended. Adams wrote the new bill which passed both houses in a veto proof majority; signature was performative.
Shame on you, CNN. You just could not wait to break away from coverage of John Lewis' funeral to cover the demented, narcissistic, asinine, daily childishness of Donald Trump. It's extremely foolish to be manipulated by him. #ByeBye
Opinion | Americans are suffering. Trump offers them a doctor who warns of sex with demons.
How many people who attend the Trump Rally on June 20th have since come down with Covid-19?
I understand.  There is a lot of overlap in privilege. I was just pointing out how both parties exploit antiblackness to justify screwing over poor people.   I thought you shared it in a VBNMW way. I thought it was a "but trump" response...sorry
Trump campaign reaches $2 million in unpaid security bills just as Mike Pence rallies with cops -
People are still naively pretending that Trump won't do what he's constitutionally prohibited from doing.
I want to point out to Donald Trump. Dr Birx and even Dr Fauci. The lines you see on the map don't represent actual physical barriers. They are not made of N95 masks , Trump's hairspray or the wood used in construction of Don Jrs head. GET A NATIONAL PLAN...
Obama is just light-years beyond dumpy-ass trump...and trump knows it, and it's galling him😅
Trump is the backlash,
Trump Admits He’s Never Mentioned Bounties to Putin Because He Thinks It’s ‘Fake News’  via   THIS PRESIDENT HAS BLOOD ON HIS HANDS. HE A TRAITOR
Nope! The teeet was perfect. Now is the PERFECT time to point out that thousands upon thousands of Americans have dies directly because of Trump’s vainglorious arrogance,  stupidity, and irresponsibility.
Trump is going to have a press confe.......
Trump floats Delay Elections "trial balloon" into stormy weather Why the heck did he write that tweet?   #TrumpIsNotWell  #TrumpMeltdown  #DelayTheElection  #delayelection
It’s always been the game Trump has been playing to delay the vote realizing that he would be voted out. Stand up America we cannot allow any change that suggest who will be the next President of the United States and whether Trump will continue to be president. It’s time to VOTE
#WeWillVote in large numbers, stand in long lines if need be to vote Trump OUT.
Did trump really ask to delay the Election Day this year? Lmaoo
Obama has aged more during Trump's presidency than he did during his own.
Trump floats idea of delaying election, congressional Republicans reject idea
Incidently, Trump Admin never did stop kidnapping little kids. It’s just done secretively. It’s just come out that the crimes continue. Be an grown up and read the newspaper.   If you voted for this monster, that’s on you.
No one is celebrating Hermain Cain’s death but it’s important to note it, because these semi-prominent followers of Trump’s dangerous ideology are getting people killed every day. Hopefully people who learn of his death can be persuaded to begin to believe the science.
Any company or anything Trump supports, i know not to fw it. That means those people are just like him.
Dr Fauci tells TRUTH.  DONALD TRUMP is a diabolical LYER. Go with that. There are thousands of other reasons.
Bombshell Report Says Trump Ordered CIA to Share Counterterrorism Intel with Russia ‘Despite No Discernible Reward’

Trump is not putting up with this crap anymore. I am a woman this person shouts.
Good thing it’s not up to either of you bozos. Trump has voted by mail in the past, so what’s the problem now?  And he does not have the power to delay the election.
Don’t argue from a place of ignorance, especially when defending sociopathic monsters like Trump and his immigration policy Renfeild, Steven Miller. What they’ve done is Crimes Against Humanity, cell in The Hague stuff. Obama did nothing vaguely like that.
Lmao. Trump is the king of multidimensional chess playing.
Bayou Brief: Trump Trumps Trump | First Draft
I want to point out to Donald Trump. Dr Birx and even Dr Fauci. The lines you see on the map don't represent actual physical barriers. They are not made of N95 masks , Trump's hairspray or the wood used in construction of Don Jrs head. GET A NATIONAL PLAN...
Herman Cain is dead because he drank Donald Trump’s Koolaid.
The election will not be delayed nor will it be by mail in ballot and Trump will win again. Liberals are looney tunes.
Trump's priorities have him promoting quacks who link the virus to demon sperm.
Already here. Why pay to keep women and children or anybody in long term detention? Trump put children in those cages, overcrowding them and keeping them long term separated from family.  Adult men in a holding cell is not children caged long term.  Apples and oranges.
The list of things Trump couldn't do but has now done reaches from here to outer space. So I take no comfort in knowing he "can't" delay the election.
No pardon from Trump after January 2021...
I don’t want any both ways. I want you nasty racists to look at the complete picture instead of your child’s veiw of everything.  With Trump, cruelty is the point. He is a sociopath and sadistic. No normal person could think of the brutal stuff done at the border.
I didn't think it was that bad - i thought it was almost rhetorical...  but Trump knew exactly what he was doing and here we go
On July 29, 2020, all of Canada had 476 new Covid-19 cases &amp; 5 deaths due to Covid  Texas, by itself, had 10,502 new cases &amp; 313 death on the same day  The difference is Republicans, Trump, Abbott &amp; MAGAfolk that call life saving masks “face diapers”.  BTW, HCQ is useless 4 Covid
Donald Trump has capitulated to China over and over.
There is no aspect of being a sick asshole that you haven’t engaged in. Using the death of Herman Cain to trash President Trump is truly beyond the pale.
TRUTH IS SETTING IN  Trump said it's "curious" that Dr. Anthony Fauci &amp; Dr. Deborah Birx enjoy high approval ratings as it relates to their handling of COVID-19 while he does not. "They're highly thought of but nobody likes me," laments Trump.
Just realized that Trump and Biden are older than every living president except Jimmy Carter.
Trump "All the schools should be open and full attendance this next school year. Totally safe."  Also Trump: "Covid is too dangerous for people to safely go out and vote. We should probably delay the election."   😐
Well #MoscowMitch called himself the #GrimReaper, maybe it’s true.  He could have prevented all this by impeaching Trump when he knew he was guilty. #GOPCowards
Trump is good at getting under their skin. Gotta love him.
The concern is that dems will obviously use mail in voting to cheat trump out of a W
Is trump supposed to be on tv right now?

Trump floats idea of election delay, a virtual impossibility
It has been reported that Cain contracted the virus at the now infamous Tulsa rally. Sue Trump as his "people" removed social distancing markers the City had put up.
Don't be surprised if et al who aren't doing well in the polls start entertaining Trump's postponement of the election.  There in the same boat and it's sinking fast.   USS GOP    Buh-bye
Donald J. Trump your a loser.  Ok  Done  Don't worry about the election anymore
The fall of Adam is Trump's fault too.
Donald Trump has said nothing about the death of one of his surrogates Herman Cain. #COVID19 #Tulsa
You have to be a heartless, soulless &amp; person who hates herself so much tht there is not one tweet of condolence for John Lewis. A man whose life made it possible for Candace to be speak freely. I forget, she’s trying to make Trump happy &amp; not mention Lewis’ name. Pathetic person
I’m still dying off the fact that they had their own colored section at a Trump rally
Really don't need no light to see through trump.
There are 150,000+ dead Americans due to a virus that Trump said would disappear &amp; was under control. More deaths than in all the wars/conflicts the US has been in since WW2. Wake your butts up ppl. Trump is incompetent &amp; killing us
Don’t be distracted by talk of moving the election. The GDP is down 30%. Hundreds of thousands are dying from COVID. Trump must be held to account.
I suggest that you not block them unless they are hostile. Your posts may have some small effect on someone who otherwise would vote for Trump. Of course if they are belligerent, misogynistic, narcissistic, feeble-minded sociopaths (like our president), I'd suggest block away!
Does she still believe that she talks to trump several times a day?
U have to be a heartless person not to see that Ana (a staunch conservative) is right. These ppl did not believe in doctor or expert recommendations. They listened to &amp; tried to pls Trump. Now they are dead or ill. See the pattern here?
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
tRump is suppose to lead in times like these but what does he do? He fires the pandemic response team and says the virus is a hoax. this is he fault. but also Cains fault for not taking his own health serious enough to put on a mask and listening to the CDC.
Ahaha gfy TIME TO SEND KIDS TO SKEWEL BUT NOT ME  President Trump suggests the U.S. may need to delay the election  via
No doubt. I don’t like the Jimmy Carter treatment he’s getting as he ages. He has more human characteristics than Trump. He paints. I believe he’s capable of a fuller range of human emotions. But must be rightly placed in American history.
Anything trump touches died ! Criminal protecting criminals.
No masks Thin that Trump hoard. I don't care if people die anymore. That's what Trump has done to me.
Praise The Lord!!! Lets pop the Champagne 🍾 and drink to it  ... Except for Trump. We know he doesn’t drink, but someone give him a Diet Coke 😉
Look up the term Jingoist. That’s all you Trump thumping character worshipers are. Your “patriotism” and obsession with this completely amoral buffoon are ruining this country.
Trump have made a damn of America! Shame on y’all
So more of this. Nobody cares anymore. There is a funeral today so lets Trump that.
The United States under Trump is not a champion of human rights. Seriously, if he's reelected or just chooses to stay in office, Democrats and minorities will be loaded onto buses heading for Trump's concentration camps that now house immigrants. #WakeUpAmerica

2020 Election Live Updates: Republicans Reject Trump’s Suggestion to Delay Election, Something He Cannot Do - The New York Times
It’s an absolute truth. And if a Democrat was in the White House up for re-election you would be saying the same thing Trump is saying.  Everyone can vote in person and be safe.
Trump supporters are constantly projecting. Your president does something unbelievably reckless and irresponsible and all you have to say is "sometimes people on the left are that bad".
Do you think, for a second, all this talk of Constitutionality means anything to Trump?  It's quite clear the Constitution is not his concern. What will stop him?
Neither Trump nor Barr (nor you) decide when we will have elections. This is not your fiefdom to run ramshackle over.
No comfort in this.
It’s difficult to take you seriously on anything that isn’t trump trump trump.  That’s why I shall be voting for  and sending you packing in November.

Drumpf (German for Trump) uses symbolism &amp; codes/Gematria to convey a message. Here he is pictured freeing us, the Goyim &amp; showing his approval for King John III to put on the Crown already.
If vote-by-mail ends up hurting the GOP, despite it not doing that in the states who have it, whose fault is that? It's Trump's fault for lying so much about it to everyone that it alters the number of Republicans who do it. This is why the GOP should be defending vote-by-mail.
Which is exactly what Trump wanted
Did I see Clinton commemorate John Lewis before trump ? Did I miss that
Mostly younger people attended the protest. Maybe they were asymptomatic. Older people attended the trump rally. Can’t prove one contributed and the other didn’t without testing and contact tracing. You can’t have cases without TESTING!
Trump had potential and opportunity, but had no moral center, no vision for what "winning" looked like.  So, he picked twitter spats at a time when the nation needed a leader.  It's time to turn the page on this disaster.
Was the music guy subtweeting Trump with that song?
Nope. Remember Trump WANTS the kids back in school.  He wants people to also go out to vote. Biden and his people want the kids to STAY home and they want us to stay home and vote from home.
I grew up in Texas around people I considered to be good people. Many of them are conservatives and Christians (I am neither) - and I challenge any person who calls themselves a “conservative” to explain how Trump, his policies, or behavior aligns with any of that.
Meanwhile, Trump is tweeting about [checks notes] ...pizza?

GOP: States are the laboratories of democracy!  CO, OR, WA, HI, UT: We're doing vote-by-mail and it totally works. It also turns out that more people than usual vote, and it doesn't appear to give an advantage to any particular racial, economic, or age group.  GOP: Trump says no.
Look, I don’t like the guy &amp; he’s definitely on the list of Worst Presidents (but he’s moved down a slot or 2) &amp; he’ll never be forgiven for the Katrina f-up, but just TRY to imagine Trump saying (reading that someone else wrote) these words. TRY.

Trump really running a cult.
Despite headlines you may be seeing, Trump cannot delay the election
This is tragic. Supporting Trump can literally get you killed. He tested positive nine days after the Tulsa rally.
Could say the same thing about Trump considering he didn’t get the popular vote.
By now the media and viewers should know that Trump gets the bulk of his research and reading from Twitter. Anything he sees on Twitter that he believes he can manipulate in his favor by way of distraction and division he grabs on to. Folks keep your eyes on the prize. Vote. Vote

Trump just lost about 2% of his black supporters
Herman Cain is a black conservative who died from COVID after going to a Trump Rally.
Trump is a narcissist leading a death cult. You think he’s sad Herman Cain died? He fucking loves it that people die as a consequence of their blind devotion to him.
By “boarding the train”, I’m referring to showing up to an ill-advised rally without proper preventative measures. Caine’s passing is a tragedy, but we should learn from it. But I do not expect Trump to admit it was unwise.
Yes, we should put our faith in a judiciary that's been packed with Trump appointees. They will surely do the right thing.
Trump is discussing postponing the election and y’all not mad enough about that for me!
Chomsky at the beginning of the Trump's presidency:
Yep he was all in for Trump didn’t wear mask and look where it got him SAD
Donald Trump is the worst president the United States has ever had. It must never happen again.
Damn he really died for Trump
Think about just how much of a piece of shit you have to be, to value a $174,000/year job more than the Republic itself. I don’t think we’ve fully come to grips with how sociopathic many of the 100 US Senators are. Just as bad or worse than Trump.
The Trump administration has said publicly that its goal is to privatize the USPS. They are very open about their desire to kill the agency, so it is not surprising that instead of actually fixing it they would take measures to erode its popularity.
He really went to a trump rally knowing he was high risk for the virus that's wild as hell to me
Trump said we finna enter a dictatorship and y’all not listening!
Right? I am not worried about Trump LEGALLY undermining the election.
both. and tRump did kill Cain and Cain killed himself.
Victimization is one of the core tenants of the modern Republican party. They've been complaining about how they're the real victims for so long that once Trump really started abusing them, they were fully prepared to submit.
Trump can’t delay the election, experts say
Casualty from Trump's Texas rally, Herman Cain. These are photos I shot in 2012 at the Tea Party's Unity Rally preceding the RNC encouraging supporters to vote for the Romney ticket. #HermanCain

Herman Cain was the kind of person I would usually snark about, but his death fills me with sadness. No one should die in the service of lying, soulless piece of trash like Donald Trump, and Cain likely influenced many to take the same risks.

Trump could have paid his respects to Congressman Lewis at the Capitol. He chose not to. He could have attended the Congressman's funeral. He chose not. He chose to tweet that we should postpone an election that he will lose, so he can lay the foundation for disputing the results
He’s dead because Trump and Republicans are not living in reality.   He’s dead because Trump convinced Republicans that Covid was a hoax and that masks are a left wing political conspiracy.   YOU OWN THIS.

One would think the death of Herman Cain could be a wake up call for Trump to take Covid 19 seriously...one would truly hope that is the case.
I’m not a liberal, and I learned libertarianism from Neal decades ago, but I agree Kudz’s words as typed below. Trump is not a leader. His ways are foolish, and Caine died because he boarded that train. It’s truly tragic and utterly heartbreaking.
That would affect Trump’s voters more than Biden’s. No Democrats died from taking hydroxy pills, for example.
lolno.  How many of trumps associates went to prison?   Mueller outright said trump obstructed justice.

Herman Cain DIES of Covid-19 - after going to Trump's Tulsa rally

The election can’t come soon enough. Americans are dying because of Trump’s incompetency and denial. In his own words he defends Putin at every turn. Even while our soldiers are targeted, Trump submissively rolls out the red carpet for Putin’s wish list. God help us.
Trump keeps going on about how the upcoming election will be the most fraudulent in history bc if he loses he’ll be able to blame something else.
I'm ready for the trump wannabes to just go away.

Trump to black people: “What do you have to lose?”  Herman Cain: (Dies)
I know the GOP benefits from Trump’s abhorrent distractions, but I doubt they’ll like that very much. The military will not have to listen to him once his term ends, it will be beholden to the speaker, no matter how the GOP feels. I’m holding out until Labor Day to freak out.
I read somewhere that the GOP is giving Trump till Labor Day to turn things around before it dumps him. They warned him on his mail-in voting nonsense already bc they actually rely on it themselves in many elections. I don’t think they’ll take kindly to a Nancy Pelosi presidency.
Herman Cain has died of COVID.  So far nothing from Trump yet.
What a shame. Maskless at Trump’s Tulsa Murder rally - no big shocker.
Guess Trump really knocked 'em dead in Tulsa. Am I being disrespectful?  You're goddamned right I am. I have no respect for someone who thinks science is a hoax and a plot by the Democrats to take down Trump. His suffering was more than preventable; it was self-inflicted.
The GOP should be talking to trump to force his resignation but they're too far gone.

Trump wants to delay voting until people can “properly, securely and safely” vote but is fine letting students go back to school. He clearly only cares about HIMSELF.
trump saying delay the election instead of allowing mail in voting is making me log off for the rest of the day see y’all tomorrow
I think CNN and the other liberal news sources have made that clear. They have been caught several times reporting fake news stories and made up hate crimes. But there is much more to fake news. Like spending 3.5 years bashing Trump instead of being good subjective journalists.

I was reading a post by someone else at around 3 am and she believes that she has Trump-induced insomnia. I have to say that’s not a crazy notion to me and I think I may have it too. I have never had as much trouble sleeping as I have these last 4 years.
Seriously, Trump's executive orders override the Constitution.
NO, what we need is a safe and secure election. That can include vote by mail.   We also need a complete census, better handling of the pandemic and and a economic recovery plan. The ONLY solution is to vote Trump OUT!  #VoteBiden2020
That's the bigger problem that people are missing. Getting Trump out of office won't be the quick fix most people think it will be.
Unfortunately, the Constitution no longer matters. Trump will sign an executive order making himself president until another one is elected, which won't ever happen. Congress and the Supreme Court will do absolutely nothing about it.
His name was Bernell Trammell, he was a Trump supporter he was gunned down for it...  RIP Bernell
President Donald Trump is for the first time floating a “delay” to November’s presidential election.
Trump's Doc is also a minister and made false medical and  supernatural claims on YouTube, including that masturbation attracts demons, same-sex couples are an abomination and men should not wear dresses. ..This may hurt Trump with the Scottish kilt aficionados.
Meanwhile, your supreme leader is floating the idea of declaring himself the winner of the election regardless of the outcome. Our Constitution is under attack daily by Trump but you’re complaining that Pelosi isn’t holding your hand while you get a swab stuck up your nose.
I see the "whatever Trump says times minus one is what I think" rule is in full effect, so we're doing this now I guess.
I don’t think Trump loves 2020.
Fox reporters think Trump's threat to not accept election results or delay them is just fine. That's just being careful.  Bob Mann got it right years ago.  |  via

Psst, do a quick Google search on how much Trump has profited from the inexpensive drug.   I'll wait.
Agreed, which in itself is an indictment. Scientists should guide us not administrators or politicians. This is exactly where Trump has hurt us most, relatively speaking. His demonization of Dr. Fauci paved the way for governors, mayors and Univ administrators to ignore science.
You mean Donald Trump and his enablers, who have sacrificed over 150,000 Americans. Including 313 dead Texans just yesterday.
Hence the reason for Trump’s “delay the election” tweet. Anything to divert from this terrible news.
This is a terrible advice unless you're worried Trump might lose. This is an astounding, perhaps historic, blunder and the other side would be derelict to not exploit it.
what give refunds for the September show because it has not been canceled or postponed. Can you confirm if you all are coming or not yet? Because  and  are being worse than Trump about Covid apparently.
Pathetic. Again  has been saying since 2017 that Trump would pull this kind of garbage especially if/when he loses. He’s polling so terribly that he’s scrambling.
You see...I’m sure I’m not alone in having noticed the puzzle pieces being put in place before we could actually see the completed puzzle.   Everything Trump does is strategic.  The fix is in.
If #RussiaGate was a hoax why does  continue to sneak around meeting with Putin? Putin is Trump’s new sugar daddy! Trump can’t function without someone giving him lots of money to blow. Dopey Don will do anything for cash &amp; or praise.

Trump will try this. What happens if, let’s say, the Florida Governor, decides to stop the election and shut down voting locations? What happens if Trump sends the national guard into places like Detroit to prevent people from voting? Republicans won’t stand up to Trump.
President Trump floats election 'delay' amid claims of voting fraud
Interesting that Trump proves the point of the left instead of his own in this video.   Did this news station receive a single fraudulent vote in their experiment? No. But they did experience voter disenfranchisement, which is how republicans win elections.
...but I don’t think that Nancy Pelosi wants to be President. The 20th Amendment mandates that the current President’s term ends at noon on Jan. 20, no matter WHETHER THERE HAS BEEN AN ELECTION OR NOT. Pence and Trump would be removed and the Speaker of the House is 3rd in line.
This is now the third time on this thread (about Cedric Richmond and Richard Barr) in which you have invoked Trump. Trump lives rent-free in your (collective) minds. Your day is affected by his every tweet. Trump has nothing to do with my day-to-day life. No politician does.
We should honestly vote right now considering how much of this country Trump has killed
Ummm... the President doesn't have the ability to delay the election, and you know he will never concede. Whoever wins in November we're screwed, either way Trump won't leave office without a full blown Constitutional crisis and probably bloodshed. 2020 saving the worst for last
Trump gonna throw a extra couple hundred and stop the checks right before voting time and say vote for me if you want more
Trump knows he’s gonna lose, no matter when the election is held, who votes, or how they vote.  This is nothing more than an admission of that inevitability. So this is not about delaying it to a more opportune time. It’s about declaring the outcome fraudulent in advance.
Trump weighs close to 300lbs. Just saying.
Trump is capable of anything but cracking up like this 3 months before the election is a disaster for his campaign. He's admitting he's losing and his desperation and instability incentivizes the establishment to cut him loose.
Happy Thursday? Trump’s tweet de jour has a nice fascist hint to it. I like the way he mentioned himself though in the tweet: “a great embarrassment to the USA.” #thursdayvibes #Trump2020 #AmericaOrTrump #TrumpFascism #TrumpFailedAmerica
Trump really?

I am not confused about their overall plan &amp; I am not saying that Republicans or Trump are now pushing an agenda of demilitarization or anything positive overall, however I do think that closing foreign bases is always a good idea
It’s largely another Trump distraction tactic designed to shift focus away from the tanking economy and coronavirus. He can’t change an election date.  Vote.

Let’s give  a billion dollars to #resign.  Guarantee he will be bankrupt again in 2 years. Trump’s hurting himself as much as he’s hurting the Country. His bragging can’t hide the fact that he’s turned our Country into a failed State in 3 short years.

President Donald Trump will be holding a press conference around 4:30 p.m.
Trump is facing jail time if he can't get reelected, so he will do anything including setting off a nuclear bomb in New York City.
Well can be sure that trump is satan's right hand man, he has destroyed the United States and setting things up for Putin to take over the world.
Well if things go as they have in the bible, I expect that about 1/3 of the population in the United States will perish from the pandemic, storms, fires and or floods. God cleans house when things get too bad, trump has been a great help in stirring up hatred.
Trump just have to destroy everything he touches, he's not satisfied with preventing the smart foreigners from coming here,  which will cause a serious shortage in high tech companies.
Trump wants his dictatorship so bad,  the pandemic ruined everything, but he is a diehard And a police state is what Putin believes in
You do realize Trump and a large number of his staff vote by mail, right? It’s a thing that happens. Many states use it. Louisiana has early voting so we don’t all have to stand in lines for hours on Election Day if we choose not to.
You would quit Twitter if Trump lost? A) I’m not putting that in the hands of strangers. B) Part of my job is social media, so I kinda have to pass on that.   I do not believe he will win. I’d classify him as the underdog. But stranger things have happened.
President Donald Trump is for the first time floating a “delay” to November’s presidential election. The president is also making allegations that increased mail-in voting will result in fraud.
Mail in voting is absentee voting, updated. It’s been used for a very long time. No problems. Trump is afraid Democrats May mail vote in substantial numbers and kick his ass back to 5th Avenue. Start packing.

I was laughing so hard ...Clesn the SWAMP....There must be a layer that is so deep, below the SWAMP. Trump said that he could run his business better than his sons. I thought this was  only his EGO talking. Now, there’s more evidence of his beneath the swamp criminality.
All Trump has to do is issue an executive order - it’s not that hard to do but so many Republican presidents fail to do it.

Trump 2020
Trump Campaign associates failed to report any of the Russian/WikiLeaks overtures to fed law enforcement, publicly denied any contacts with Russians/WikiLeaks, and encouraged the public to doubt that Russia was behind the hacking and distribution of stolen emails.
Michael Cohen, on behalf of the Trump Organization, brokered a secret deal for a Trump Tower Moscow project directly involving Putin’s inner circle, at least until June 2016.
Trump requested campaign affiliates to get Clinton’s emails, which resulted in an individual apparently acting in coordination with the Campaign claiming to have successfully contacted Russian hackers.
Russian military hackers may have followed Trump’s July 27, 2016 public statement “Russia if you’re listening …” within hours by targeting Clinton’s personal office for the first time.
Donald Trump Jr. told the Russians during the meeting that Trump could revisit the issue of the Magnitsky Act if elected.
Trump Tower meeting: (1) On receiving an email offering derogatory information on Clinton coming from a Russian government official, Donald Trump Jr. “appears to have accepted that offer;” (2) members of the Campaign discussed the Trump Tower meeting beforehand
Trump Campaign chairman Manafort expected Trump’s winning the presidency would mean Deripaska would want to use Manafort to advance Deripaska’s interests in the United States and elsewhere.
The Trump Campaign chairman periodically shared internal polling data with the Russian spy with the expectation it would be shared with Putin-linked oligarch, Oleg Deripaska.
The Trump Campaign chairman and deputy chairman (Paul Manafort and Rick Gates) knowingly shared internal polling data and information on battleground states with a Russian spy; and the Campaign chairman worked with the Russian spy on a pro-Russia “peace” plan for Ukraine.
1. Trump was receptive to a Campaign national security adviser’s (George Papadopoulos) pursuit of a back channel to Putin.
The redacted Mueller Report documents a series of activities that show strong evidence of collusion. Or, more precisely, it provides significant evidence that Trump Campaign coordinated with, cooperated with, encouraged, or gave support to Russian interference activities.
Then the only reason for the "hearing" was to have a prop to scold and yell at. They could have used a cardboard cutout. This was not a hearing. It was a grandstanding platform to appease the liberal constituents who want to see their reps "give it to" the Trump administration.

There was only one irrrgularity for the fisa warrants. There are many that were fine. You know that you are reaching with the Biden issue. It was already determined he has done nothing wrong. And you know trump colludes, he is still doing it.
Mueller said he did not evaluate “collusion” with the Russian government. “The president was not exculpated for the acts that he allegedly committed,” Mueller told the House judiciary committee, adding that Trump could theoretically be indicted after he leaves office.
This is what I don't get. Let's say you're all in on republican. Then you see this kind of answer. What's being said without being said is, we know Trump got Russian help, so he can't come out and automatically say "yes it's wrong" why would you still support that.

The Corona Virus is about to get far worse. The amount of damage done by the #Hydroxychloroquine crap yesterday is amazing to watch.  Millions of right winger now believe if they get sick there is a miracle cure because Donald Trump and the Right wing media pushed it so hard.
And just to add, Fauci never said the drugged worked. He said it looked promising but was too early to tell. Testing needed to be done to know for sure. You know, back when everyone was all, "But Trump said!"
You're funny. Trump has to prove he can remember 5 words, while  sits back and laughs and laughs and laughs😂😅😂😅 #MagatsAreMorons
This happened in 2016 as well. I remember it well. They  even had the NERVE to argue with me the day AFTER the election. "Well, no I didn't vote, but my mom/dad did for Trump". I wanted to WRING their scrawy PRIVILEGED little necks. "Nothing will change" Don't live there anymore.
Exactly. Magats "try", and I emphasize TRY to throw kids in the mix. It's ludicrous. Trump uses children as he uses adults. How MANY has he KILLED at the border? How many has put in harm's way by NOT following thru on his gun control "promise"? Now sending them to their deaths.
I agree that your lack of Covid/Trump references is a definite plus for this script.  But, I'm not sure most audiences are going to get all of your deep-cut references to Tusk era Fleetwood Mac.
I know a bit of both.  Biden? Well let’s see, I have always personally liked him. I think he’s honest. I don’t see in him the cultish autocratic populist Trump embodies. The only thing Trump and I agree is Iraq. So this:
Oh I agree with that. Trump and his band of proud boys love to do just that. Then, they send his Gestapo in. It's dispicable.
Yep 151 COUNTRIES all have conspired in a dark room to let their citizens die so Trump would not get reelected.  They have destroyed their economies and fake dozens of studies to cover up that #Hydroxychloroquine works lol

You and   all falling for it AGAIN, aren't you? See/hear/read something that showed you $$$ might not be quite as ludcritive for y'all if Trump loses? The riotors aren't from the left. #TrumpGestapo #TRUMPisAFUCKINGNazi
The left should have never supported you by giving you billions just to turn into some Trump fanatic.
Thank you for EVERYTHING you have done and continue to do Steve.  is fantastic and has been a godsend.  is a hack, a Trump sycophant who, just like the traitor and his other minions will try but fail... #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica

I also agree, but what trump's goons are doing is so outrageous. I am so totally pissed &amp; I'm not even out there. Violence/vandalism is not the ans, but there are so many videos circulating showing these assholes attacking ppl for no fucking reason. Who is going to police them?
Trump is not helping the situation w/his goons. All he is doing is pissing ppl the fuck off! This will continue &amp; it's going to get worse. When they start killing ppl, who is going to hold them accountable? They are acting in such a way that started the protests in the 1st place.

They would never be as disgusting as Trump’s tweets!! Tweet away Mr. Future president!
Mr. Trump I was one of the first supporters of yours BEFORE you announced in 2016 - I wanted you to run.
Trump is a true President too if you voted for him or not.  He was elected just like Obama.  I even voted for Obana the first time because I thought he was different. I was wrong. I am now called a racist because I voted for Trump and will do so again.

Trump’s not racist?    Learn something every day.
Terrence! I’m so upset about Herman Cain! Now we have lost two great black trump supporters!!!
No shit on 1! 2. Absentee ballots are not the mail-in ballots the democrats are pushing for 3. They REQUEST absentee ballots they don't just get them in mail because they are registered. 4. Trump is doing nothing to undermine the election. The Democrats are going that. 5. GFY!
Yes Donald J. Trump is an actual President. He beat Hillary. GET OVER IT ALREADY!!!!!!!!!!!
And Trump isn't gonna delay this one because he can't! You people fall for it every time. Did you not see the fn ??? at the end? But if we are delaying school and sports why not the election why we are at it? NO I'm not suggesting we delay the election. Its a rhetorical question!
Who is trump trying to coup exactly
Oh I’ll be damned #Trump is on TV, press conference, indicating he’s going to interfere in the #Election2020 and giving us the way to do it. Saying it’s all fraudulent and it hasn’t happened yet!!! Is this the end of democracy?#DumpTrump2020

Love President Trump.  We  need him more than ever.
While this is important, we shouldn't let Trump distract us from the economic failing reported today. Thats what he's trying distract everyone from.
No but they at least think they can fire you for supporting Trump..... And that's how you know the nation is fucked.  They dictate they dictate every damn thing.    It's time to start over.

I hate to hear if Herman Cain's passing.  He was a true believer in American individual liberty and a true American story.  He was what I was hoping Trump would have been if not for lefts predictable method for tearing people down.  My condolences to all who knew him. God bless u

Has Trump said anything about #HermanCain dying? Probably not because he doesn't care.
Trump is gonna win again ON NOVEMBER 3RD! Biden won't concede though and will claim voter suppression. In the end you will all be crying just like you did in 2016 because you're a bunch of babies!
I think Herman Cain belongs alongside Sarah Palin in the pantheon of not serious candidates for high office who over the years helped Trump see the precise triangulation of attitude and issues to pull off the ultimate grift
Yeah don't turn this around. You are making a big deal over a supposed "outbreak" in Tulsa because of the Trump rally and ignoring the "outbreaks" at protests and rallies. Not wearing a mask doesn't make a person stupid or idiotic. Many masks were being worn at both gatherings!
WTF difference does it make if a person is "high profile" or not. They are people nonetheless and you're only making a big deal out of Caine because you think he got it a Trump rally. The mayor of Atlanta tested positive after attending a protest.
Makes one wonder what Putin and Maxwell have in common with tRump? Birds of a feather...
Its not a distraction. THe economy is no longer abysmal. The GDP is from April through June. THe economy was shutdown. I support Trump. I do not support delaying the election. He isn't going to try to delay the election. You just love getting trolled!

Herman Cain died this morning from COVID-19. He caught it at Trump's Tulsa rally. He didn't social distance and didn't wear a mask.  DAMN FOOL!
Yeah he bashed The thousands of people who worked in his companies? Sure buddy 😉 i’ve seen more compassion for the little people from Trump then I have ever seen from a Democrat! Democrats want to take more of our money and destroy The nuclear family.
No I was there I even voted for Obama the first time. Conservatives never treated Obama the way Democrats are treating Trump today!
Herman Cain downplayed COVID and refused to wear a mask Herman Cain didn’t wear a mask to the Trump Tulsa rally Herman Cain was hospitalized for COVID that he contracted at the Trump Tulsa rally  HERMAN CAIN JUST DIED
Point is where do you guys get the nerve to tell us to hold Trump accable for what he says when you guys don’t even do the same for your own party? U guys have said the most disgusting things about the American president and the fact is we fight for the man who’s fighting for us
Trump's political past. 1987 Republican 1999 Independence Party of NY 2001 Democrat 2009 Republican  2011 Unaffiliated/Independent 2012 Republican  Now that's wishy washy!
The dates of federal elections are set by Congress, and the Constitution makes no provisions for a delay to the Jan. 20, 2021 presidential inauguration.
Trump’s numerous tweets against mail-in voting have many Republican fearful GOP voters will be less likely to take advantage of the option.
You claimed she won something that no one was competing for. Trump won a majority of what counted. Hillary lost! Trump is your President!!
His tweet came on a day of bad economic news — the government reported that U.S. economy shrank at a dizzying 32.9% annual rate in the April-June quarter.
And its about voting against Donald Trump. :)

When asked if a $1,200 direct payment to Americans was enough, Trump said, "We're going to see it may go higher than that, actually."

No they didn't. They released a bill that insults families and working people, and threw money at fighter jets and DC Trump hotel. To call a bill a good faith effort when it doesn't enjoy support from the proposing party is a joke!

Nope. Apparently not. The Republicans think "Dems" are specifically doing this so Trump will lose reelection. As if he needs any help with that.. They're just trying to save face for the likely possibility that they lose.

Sorry but your wrong, (1) they did nothing when nancy knew, but try to impeach Pres. Trump. Pres. Trump did what he did when he found out what was going on. You also have to look at the media. No reporting.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Judge Jeanne Pierro (probably spelled wrong) tweeted that if you’re voting for President Trump to drop your State, and you wouldn’t have believed all the comments from California, New York, Michigan, Minnesota. It’s really happening, people are waking up all over the Country!
Not only this  but with 150k dead from covid, would LBJ been re-elected in 68 after only 59k died in Vietnam. I don’t think so. Trump is certifiable to think things are beautiful and great. Wake up people. WTF is wrong with everyone . Makes me absolutely sick
Dispicable. VET who served was doing nothing but yelling. Yeah that deserves pepper spray or whatever that was . Thank Trump. He is dividing this country worse than it was during the Vietnam era. And I see people much more angry and DANGEROUS than back then. Please vote him out
Where were the Democrats in January when Trump was talking about it? Oh yeah they too busy trying to impeach the president to care about this virus. They were too busy telling people that Trump was exaggerating, And they were asking people to go these hotspots with no masks
How about instead of bitching about what PRESIDENT Trump has done, you tell people what you would have done differently, or is whoever writes these pathetic canned tweets not able to wake you up? TRUMP 2020 🇺🇸
You mean the one we're federal agents with the most powerful intelligence appearatus in human history magically couldn't find anything it.  When almost all the guns he bought were purchased just after Trump's election but no one seems to know that.  Nope, that never did smell.

Use your common sense man. If Russia wanted Trump to win then why did they help Hillary get dirt on Trump? 🤔 It’s not hard to figure out.. I don’t care what CNN tells you
Really it’s common sense. If Russia wanted Trump to win then why did they give dirt about Trump to Hillary for her to use against Trump?.. think about it.. it’s not hard! Bc they really wanted Hillary to win. I don’t care what CNN told you.
Ya well you keep spilling that Chinese propaganda with this “keep the country on lockdown, calling it the China virus is racist, it’s all Trump‘s fault crap!
When he said that he was at a rally. No one in the country took it seriously except you Democrats. Hillary actually went through with it and paid Russians for dirt on Trump. Trump just talked about it,  Hillary actually did it. Why ain’t you pissed off at that? 🤔
Mrs. Trump when you talk about grabbing a woman by the Pussy and they will follow anywhere and youre talking about  Hippocrates

Hold up. Hillary paid Russians for dirt on Trump!! I don’t see you pissed off over that. Oh yeah even Robert Mueller said “no American colluded or conspired with Russia?” So take them garbage lies somewhere else
I love dunking on trump supporters
This was happening long before Trump.
Hey crazy woman.. If the protesters were actually protesting peacefully then Trump wouldn’t have to send federal agents to clean up you city.. if you don’t do anything illegal then (by law) the police cannot arrest you!! Not that hard to understand

I don't think this will change any minds. Anyone who cares about those things was never voting Trump.

That same AOC called all the women who support trump racist!
Infection rates and death rates are two different thing. Look we didn’t even know the virus was in America until Dec 21. That’s when the first case appeared. Dec 31 Trump band travel to China. Democrats were too busy with impeachment and saying Trump was exaggerating
Also just to mention, Trump’s son’s school is not opening because it is not safe. But everyone else’s kids should start school except his child due to safety concerns. #Biden2020 #GOPComplicitTraitors #UnidentifiedPoliceMustGo #TrumpVirus #NeverForget #CriminalTrump
You’re right they haven’t blamed anyone under the sun because they only blame Trump.
No they just got on the news and encourage people to come to the hotspots!! They were saying don’t change your daily life style Trump is over exaggerating
From the moment he took the oath he became President Trump. That title will never be taken from him and will immortalize him. No such thing as bad publicity for a narcissist.
Yeah I’m pretty sure the house is ran by the Democrats🤔 The GOP can’t do anything without Democrat support that’s exactly why Trump couldn’t get anything done for the last two years. Because Democrats obstructed everything, decided to play impeachment instead of doing their job
Isn’t it funny how they blame everything that happens in the world On Trump. They will go as far as to victimize a terrorist in order to blame make Trump

I know you must have looked up the QAnon stuff. It is a cult, plain and simple. They've been brainwashed but consider themselves 'woke'. When Trump tweets certain phrases they treat it like code. I find it equally funny and tragic.

Trump is our President. How is stating a fact grounds for termination?
Trump literally did away with Obama administration’s playbook on pandemic and failed to do the bare minimum in preventing It from roaring into a fire in The US while continuously down playing it.
I’m not sure why people are okay with Trump leveraging Ukraine for supposed dirt on Biden.
But if we’re comparing shit sandwiches, you’re gonna have to draw up all the bullshit Trump has done or denied or straight up lied about to save face politically. At the very LEAST Biden has the common sense not to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, nix a pandemic plan,
Do you feel that it’s an error on Trump’s part to send Federal Police to Portland?
I think A) Biden has played nice with separatists back in the day and has not  followed through with promises to protect groups of folks who deserve protection, and B) Biden is now set up to pass progressive policies on key issues that Trump has failed to acknowledge as issues.
Trump orphaned 2 boys in Houston.

is an idiot. I pray he doesn’t remain in office the remainder of his term. Saying New York still surged after stay at home order but doesn’t acknowledge the fact the virus doesn’t hit immediately to an infected person. He’s almost on a trump level of stupidity
Joe Biden is a lackluster politician but he stands mountains higher than anyone else in question here in terms of ethics. He’s also the only viable option in replacing Trump and so, the only one actually worth scrutinizing. He undeniably the better choice for President. IMO.
He's here to fix the problem, by sending in Federal Troops, for Law and Order Trump will not face up to anything, it's always someone else fault, but he's going to fix it You can't FIX STUPID !!!

Trump is a true President too if you voted for him or not.  He was elected just like Obama.  I even voted for Obana the first time because I thought he was different. I was wrong. I am now called a racist because I voted for Trump and will do so again.

I used to dislike you. Just being honest. I am a Trump supporter so of course I would get pissed when I didn’t like the coverage, however, a true journalist are like umpires. Like you said, you call balls and strikes. You call it like you see it. Keep up the good work.
The president is urging Americans who have survived COVID-19 to help battle the pandemic by donating plasma.
Trump’s not racist?    Learn something every day.
Terrence! I’m so upset about Herman Cain! Now we have lost two great black trump supporters!!!
No shit on 1! 2. Absentee ballots are not the mail-in ballots the democrats are pushing for 3. They REQUEST absentee ballots they don't just get them in mail because they are registered. 4. Trump is doing nothing to undermine the election. The Democrats are going that. 5. GFY!
Yes Donald J. Trump is an actual President. He beat Hillary. GET OVER IT ALREADY!!!!!!!!!!!
And Trump isn't gonna delay this one because he can't! You people fall for it every time. Did you not see the fn ??? at the end? But if we are delaying school and sports why not the election why we are at it? NO I'm not suggesting we delay the election. Its a rhetorical question!
Who is trump trying to coup exactly
Oh I’ll be damned #Trump is on TV, press conference, indicating he’s going to interfere in the #Election2020 and giving us the way to do it. Saying it’s all fraudulent and it hasn’t happened yet!!! Is this the end of democracy?#DumpTrump2020
Actually I really don't Tweet but after hearing the News and that as Bernie Mac would say "That Summmnma Bi##$ " please register to vote  if you don't vote means a vote for Trump.  Answer me this can you take 4 more years of this ##$$hole I'm just wondering

Love President Trump.  We  need him more than ever.
While this is important, we shouldn't let Trump distract us from the economic failing reported today. Thats what he's trying distract everyone from.
No but they at least think they can fire you for supporting Trump..... And that's how you know the nation is fucked.  They dictate they dictate every damn thing.    It's time to start over.
Obama, eulogizing John Lewis, takes aim at Trump over voting rights, protest response  Obama should be ashamed of entering politics into what should just been John R. Lewis. ⁦
I hate to hear if Herman Cain's passing.  He was a true believer in American individual liberty and a true American story.  He was what I was hoping Trump would have been if not for lefts predictable method for tearing people down.  My condolences to all who knew him. God bless u
Only you Mr. President  can solve the problems we face today. GOD BLESS AMERICA AND GOD  BLESS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  TRUMP 2020

President Trump,  the left is planning bad things for you and the country. BIG TECH, LEFT SOCIALIST DEMS,DEEP STATE SOROS AND ANARCHIST GROUPS ARE PLANNING TO RIG ELECTIONS IN EVERY WAY.  MACHINE VOTING, MAIL IN, ABSENTEE, DEAD PEOPLE  AND ETC.. I PRAY THEY ARE CAUGHT.
Has Trump said anything about #HermanCain dying? Probably not because he doesn't care.
Trump is gonna win again ON NOVEMBER 3RD! Biden won't concede though and will claim voter suppression. In the end you will all be crying just like you did in 2016 because you're a bunch of babies!
I think Herman Cain belongs alongside Sarah Palin in the pantheon of not serious candidates for high office who over the years helped Trump see the precise triangulation of attitude and issues to pull off the ultimate grift
Yeah don't turn this around. You are making a big deal over a supposed "outbreak" in Tulsa because of the Trump rally and ignoring the "outbreaks" at protests and rallies. Not wearing a mask doesn't make a person stupid or idiotic. Many masks were being worn at both gatherings!
WTF difference does it make if a person is "high profile" or not. They are people nonetheless and you're only making a big deal out of Caine because you think he got it a Trump rally. The mayor of Atlanta tested positive after attending a protest.
Makes one wonder what Putin and Maxwell have in common with tRump? Birds of a feather...
Its not a distraction. THe economy is no longer abysmal. The GDP is from April through June. THe economy was shutdown. I support Trump. I do not support delaying the election. He isn't going to try to delay the election. You just love getting trolled!

Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Herman Cain died this morning from COVID-19. He caught it at Trump's Tulsa rally. He didn't social distance and didn't wear a mask.  DAMN FOOL!
Yeah he bashed The thousands of people who worked in his companies? Sure buddy 😉 i’ve seen more compassion for the little people from Trump then I have ever seen from a Democrat! Democrats want to take more of our money and destroy The nuclear family.
No I was there I even voted for Obama the first time. Conservatives never treated Obama the way Democrats are treating Trump today!
Herman Cain downplayed COVID and refused to wear a mask Herman Cain didn’t wear a mask to the Trump Tulsa rally Herman Cain was hospitalized for COVID that he contracted at the Trump Tulsa rally  HERMAN CAIN JUST DIED
Point is where do you guys get the nerve to tell us to hold Trump accable for what he says when you guys don’t even do the same for your own party? U guys have said the most disgusting things about the American president and the fact is we fight for the man who’s fighting for us
Trump's political past. 1987 Republican 1999 Independence Party of NY 2001 Democrat 2009 Republican  2011 Unaffiliated/Independent 2012 Republican  Now that's wishy washy!
The dates of federal elections are set by Congress, and the Constitution makes no provisions for a delay to the Jan. 20, 2021 presidential inauguration.
Trump’s numerous tweets against mail-in voting have many Republican fearful GOP voters will be less likely to take advantage of the option.
You claimed she won something that no one was competing for. Trump won a majority of what counted. Hillary lost! Trump is your President!!
His tweet came on a day of bad economic news — the government reported that U.S. economy shrank at a dizzying 32.9% annual rate in the April-June quarter.

FishFace said really horrible thangs to and about POTUS Trump and was for impeaching him. Nasty man.
Today's D Brief: Fed forces move to swing states; Trump threatens Election Day; How not to sell a European drawdown; Pentagon calls journalists ‘adversaries;’ And a bit more.
Yet you trusted a failed businesses man to run the economy. And here we are. Anything that Buffon touches dies.. And now even Herman Cain is gone because he wanted to cheer that demagogue on. If trump wasn't president how many people would still be alive?
Now I know why Trump didn’t attend.  He doesn’t believe in any of that!!!
When Trump said America First, ppl didn’t realize he was talking about doing what we do over there over here more, and not about outsourced labor.
I can't decide if Trump is actually good at distracting people with his bullshit, if people fall for it willingly because they love the drama, or if they really are that dumb.
Why does he look like Trump had an illegitimate son with Ann Coulter
lmao trump gon have his supporters thinking the election delayed. whole time everybody else gon be at the polls on november third 🤣
ENDLESS corruption by #PutinPuppetTrump    is there any part of the US Constitution that trump WON'T piss on?  pro tip. read the Constitution, USPS is in there pretty early on.
Let's talk about Trump's call to suspend the elections....  via
How much was trump paid for this promo? Is Air Force One going to have NASCAR like decals stuck on it?  Also - wait a minute. What happened to your best pizza friend Papa John? Are you two timing him? Sounds like a trumpy thing to do.
Trump canceling the election would make the libs heads explode.  I 100% support this #MAGA #BidenCrime #LockHerUp
go ahead - spell out all the things being done by #2A cowars like yourself, that i've missed, which oppose tyrant trump and his secret police.  link all the news articles, photos, videos, etc.  or apologize for lying like a coward.
so, in your mind, the moms, dads, and veterans being assaulted by tyrant trump's secret police are "helpless victims"?  sounds like you're 100% full of crap.  but keep hiding in mom's basement, coward, like all the other  &amp; #2A cowards.
Trump portrait at the White House
That's why Trump should be tried criminally for leading all his fellow nitwits over the cliff. He is a vile human who cares about no one but himself!!! Oh, and there is this:
The fact that Trump and his crew didn't renew the Voting Rights Act should scare you if you are a true American patriot.   Everyone should have the right to vote.
If you voted for McCain then Romney then trump - I disagree fully with your policies &amp; priorities but that is a logical progression.   If you voted for Obama then Obama again then trump - you may not fully understand the concept of voting and/or governance.
Still under the delusion that  is a legit news site? We just had the worst economic quarter in 145 years, and it isn't anywhere on their home page. Why does Trump tweet insanity when there's bad news? Because the amateurs chase it. Every. Damn. Time. #JournalismMalpractice
I just heard  giving the eulogy at John Lewis’s funeral.   How did we go from erudite, empathic &amp; dignified to trump (who is the antithesis of all that) in 1 election cycle?  I no longer believe in universal suffrage.
black voices for trump?  um...
just like trump's knee-slapper about us injecting bleach?
Uh..... Because he's a member of the playing squad and will be heavily involved in the next game, assuming we get there? I think that trump's 'real' fans.
Thank you, but no i'll stick with earth.  However if somehow trump prevails by hook or crook on Nov 3, please let me reconsider!
President Trump floats the idea of delaying the presidential election.
Thanks for even mention Trump. Onion, this wasn't very satirical.
Trump drops a question that distracts from the worst ever US GDP figures and you lot a treat it like an potential coup. Of course he can't do it.  But he can play the media like a fiddle.
WE DO NOT HAVE A LEADER of the “free world,” NO WAY we should STILL be dealing with CORONA &amp; we didn’t start the shit!!! This is trump’s karma, not ours 😤
Trump doesn't know how to joke.
I fully expect the GOP/Trump to blame mail-in voting as a cause for their loss instead of, you know ... *waves hands around broadly* all of this.
Unless something miraculous happens, Trump's done in November...💪🇺🇲
Yes, perhaps since there's an unbroken chain since 1788, we might want to have the election as planned. Also, #ByeByeTrumpByeBye.
TRUMP be like :
is that why all the #2A activists are hiding in fear from tyrant trump's storm troopers?  but they never found a #BLM rally they couldn't attend, heavily armed.  racist scum =  #2A cowards.
yeah we've noticed  and #2A activists are still silent and cowering in fear against tyrant trump's storm troopers.  so, your bullshit words, can go there with the cowards who say them.
John Lewis refused to attend Trump’s inauguration and spent three and a half years refusing to accept American voters’ election of Trump  So why should Trump attend any part of a funeral for a person who publicly hated Trump
Opinion | Trump’s silly new talking point on the coronavirus actually refutes itself
When President #Trump is okay with reopening schools during peak COVID but wants to attempt delaying the presidential election due to COVID, you can easily tell that all he actually cares about is himself.
Your trust in God is why you follow Trump? What Biblical and Christian morals and values does he display? Please enlighten us all.
Aaaaaaaand there it is folks. The first salvo fired in Trump's attempt at a power grab. There be dragons - and an open door to dictatorship. It's all starting here.
U.S. Sen. James Inhofe put his phone to his ear when Trump called him the other day in a capitol hill restaurant, but left it on speaker. Nearby patrons heard the conversation, and one recorded it
Also the IRS, the USA 🇺🇸 SS statements, census every 10 years, yep you pretty much covered it!! Trump is scared if he loses he may face his crimes-full on!!
This nonsensical rhetoric of President Trump not leaving office is now officially being pushed by the Democrats to set the stage for a contingency in case their election fraud fails. If the Democrat plan to cheat fails, they are preparing to say that Trump cheated. Disgusting!

Glad Herman had a great time at trump's Klan rally. Hope it was worth it!
President Trump knows he can’t win at this point. He has no other choice, but to postpone at this point because he is gonna lose and lose by a landslide.
So y’all trying to tell me the stuff trump doing is not illegal?
So he basically died b/c of trump, &amp; his family can't do anything about it smh
No Bernie, the American people are sick and tired of the Democrats systematically destroying this country. Their incessant lies, their hypocrisy, their racial division, and their attempts to steal an election. On November 3rd, the American people will elect Trump again.
Doesn’t matter what pollster rated.  This is about which way the wind is blowing not the actual numbers.  The wind is blowing trump except in North Carolina and that’s steady.  Trump has surged in last 10 days in the midst of a shit storm.  Buckel up.
Trump Derangement Syndrome. It didn't bother him that Clinton transferred satellite technology to the Chicoms so they could develop their missile technology.
If Trump knows how to fix America, why's everything 1000 times more fucked up than it was 3.5 years ago???  Huh?  Got an explanation?
Trump wouldn’t even go pay his respects to John Lewis.  Meanwhile, Former POTUS W eulogized.  John Lewis was a civil rights fighter and a hero, it says a lot about a person who refuses to attend his memorial.
It has nothing to do with Trump leaving peacefully. That's an opportunistic statement. It's about wanting to make sure the election isn't stolen by fraud. It's about protecting our country and the American people.
The ACLU, a bastion for human/civil rights, never gives up, never gives in! I invite all to join with me in supporting the ACLU and its fight against neo-fascist lawlessness!
Yup. Very successful businessman. As a cancer survivor, he had no business being there to prove a point/support Trump.
I could be wrong but I’m pretty sure the Venn diagram of people who think Armageddon is the best mivie ever and people who voted for Trump is a perfect circle.
Trump would win in a landslide if election was held today.  Fake polls didn’t work in 2016 and won’t in 2020. #Trump2020LandslideVictory
Stop blaming trump - what about ur husband????
I know Trump wants to be careful about offending Voters but it’s long past time to pull ALL Federal funding from ANY State that violates OUR Constitutional rights by declaring themselves “sanctuaries” for criminals. It is a DIRECT violation of Federal Law
Never agreed w/anything you've said, until now. Trump deliberately politicized Covid. Trump only cares about Trump. Everyone else is just a means to an end. He's never shed a legitimate tear in his life.
We are buried to our necks in unrighteousness &amp; injustice as a nation bec too many men &amp; women of God have stayed silent for too long...long before Pres.Trump. Speak your heart &amp; follow your conscience, Ray. It's your right &amp; duty, brother. I'm worried,too. Lord, pls help us now

Yeah, well, let’s not forget Congress has failed to stop any of Trump’s illegal bullshit.
Look at the policies and not the man and you’ll change your mind to TRUMP 2020 Tommy!
The military will not back Trump in an illegal seizure of power. Likewise, they will not back Pelosi in what might be an equally illegal seizure of power. This is an untested COG nightmare and we’re all being dragged along for the ride by power-hungry despots.
President Trump  you need to tune in to Michael knowles  on his Daily wire  video about real rallies versus virtual. You will lose if we the people do not get to see you in person. Don’t hand the country over via email! #Trump
Looks like you’ve been wearing a few extra pancakes these days also there Teddy.  I know you blindly follow Trump but I guess you’re trying to look like him also.
So trump wants to delay the election, and I now want to smack anyone who says: “we have to vote! we really all have to vote in november” I mean I’ve wanted to for a long time

Trump is trolling the left because ya'll want to hide a wonderful treatment for COVID, keep us masked up and locked down. The left gets their panties in a wad when Trump trolls them.  It's hilarious to watch ya'll lose your minds and never regain it over being trolled.
I wasn't sure where I was going to go with this, but here goes nothing.  Have you noticed they have not once said anything positive about him? Even a broken clock is right twice a day. I didn't vote for Obama (or Trump for that matter), but I give credit where credit is due.  1/3

TRENDING: President Trump suggests delaying 2020 election.
Like, they’re trying to appeal to actual supporters of fucking FASCISM. While they do that, they go farther and father to the right and inevitably have the same policies as Trump does.  Even BIDEN called for the arrest of “anarchists”, ffs.
"Trump? Trump who? Never heard of him." #DumpTrump2020
Absolutely. A lot of folks fail to realize that the Dem party, in world politics, would literally be considered right-wing, and in some cases, far-right. Trump went mask off since the protests started and went full fascist.  Now Dems are trying to appeal to those supporters.
If I were a school superintendent in some deep-red county in middle America who knows it's not safe to return to in-person classes, Trump's postponing-the-election tweet just gave me some incredible cover to cancel the school year.

Trump proposes to delay federal elections until it's 'safe'
The illegitimate president is heading toward ever more illegitimate rule, as expected.
Trump is breaking new ground.
Candidates who believe they are winning want voting to commence today, not sometime in the distant future. Nothing Trump has said over the past months communicates his abject fear over his fate than his call to delay the election.
Trump is definitely promoting segregation in the 2020 election   Do you plan on supporting him?
Laws are man-made and are superceded by the laws of God.  God has gifted us Trump to rule man and right our wrongs.  The elections must be cancelled.

Just what POTUS TRUMP is not.
It is his today distraction from the GDP #'s. Marc E. Elias  Trump cannot delay the election. Only Congress, through a new law could do so. In any event, per the US Constitution  his term expires noon on January 20.  That cannot be moved, period.
Trump can’t delay the election. Period.
You gotta love him. Never seen a man with a worse case of foot-in-mouth-disease! Whether it's trump taking money from Russia, Bengazi created to smear Hillary. He just keeps saying out loud, the stuff you're not supposed to🤣🤣🤣

If you were really sick and your only two choices for medical advice were trump and Fauci. Who would you choose? Maybe that is why.
Keep spreading the word.  We need to decide what meds we want to take.  Should be between dr and patient not the big pharm or Dr Fauci.  Pres Trump needs to allow this.
President Trump suggests postponing November's elections citing issues with universal mail-in voting. Calls the 2020 elections most inaccurate and fraudulent in history.

I used to think so, but lately (usually after the latest tRump attrocity) I find myself pacing on the patio to get control of my anger and frustration.
Well of course it's all a hoax because trump says so...fake news, fake virus!  Fake Johnson and fake Gohmert too!
To the  troll who said Trump wasn't exonerated . Mueller will never let this go neither will Hillary be use they want Trump out of office. Even though both the Clinton's and Obama  had people murdered in cold blood and tried to ruin this country
I am earnestly attempting to have a real conversation here.  You know that media extends beyond CNN, MSNBC, FOX, etc. Its NPR, the AP, online news outlets, social media, and so on. I haven't said a word about Trump or specific events yet, I'm trying to find common ground with you
Trump commiserated earlier that Dr. Fauci's poll numbers are so high while nobody like him...
What does R, Kelly or Judge Roy Moore have to do with anything? Except one is black &amp; will rightfully go to jail &amp; the other one is white &amp; trump supported him for the Senate even though McConnell said they wouldn't seat a child molester if elected.
Michael Cohen, trump's lawyer was in prison for paying off Stormy Daniels. In his indictment person #1 ordered the payment &amp; cover-up. Person #1 was trump!  He would've been in the cell next to Cohen, if he wasn't President. He won't be come January,  think about that!

Even with the democrats doing everything in their power to infect more Americans and destroy the economy, Trump has been able to beat them back and destroy the chinese virus.  Amazing work!  #MAGA
Fox News lost me as a viewer ever since they had the audacity to report negative stores about the trump charities.  Who cares if they took money (to cover costs).  Nobody ever heard of or even donated to children cancer research before the Trumps and that is invaluable

right? and then they use republicans funding HBCUs as their prop for why we should support Trump, as if half of them don’t find them to be “racist” lmaoo.
Why is it that every time you send out a mask shaming article it’s always about Trump? It is not exclusive to Republicans. Lots of easy examples on the left also.
"Comrades, when attempting to defend an impossible position, start your tweet with, 'I'm not even a Trump supporter.'"
Cannot wait to see libs and neocons to get angry about Trump taking troops out of Germany as if the Cold War didn't ended decades ago and that all of it is just a giant scam coming from the military industrial complex.
House Dems passed an extended benefits bill in May. The GOP can’t even figure out a bill that their own party can agree on. So yes, it’s purely the fault of Republicans/trump.
We can’t have 4 more years of Trump. We just can’t, y’all.
He's a 'race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot', is what, Lindsey Graham said. "Textbook racist ", is what Paul Ryan called what trump said about a Mexican-American judge. "He's a fvcking moron", is what his Secretary of State said about him. Maybe nobody likes trump!

You’ve got to be kidding. This is a typical republican. This is why I’m happy Trump isn’t typical. Trumps intentions are way beyond the idea of government housing. Get everyone working for great pay by bringing manufacturing back.
He wants the FBI to spend twice as much for a smaller building down the street from his hotel. To keep a competitor from getting the building like he illegally got the old post office building for his hotel. trump grifts, we die!

It just occurred to me that Trump uses twitter an awful lot but he definitely doesn't read the replies. I think if he did he would just rage quit the internet.
The response really just writes itself: "Susan Collins has had just one priority for years: pretending to be "concerned" as Trump burns the country down. Time for her to step aside and let someone with better priorities do the job."
Cheap is Trump’s brand.

Has Trump been watching Vaush???
I’m not going to say Trump is squeaky, but the corporate GOP heavily resisted Trump and he still won. Contrast with DNC, who threw the primary twice for corporate candidates instead of giving Bernie and his supporters a fair shot.  If you hate Trump, I pray you vote 3rd party.
By then we'll he a decade into Trump Jr's reign.  #MAGA
Trump isn’t business as usual. He’s got lots of problems, and a lot of the same BS that establishment phonies have, but he has a pinch of libertarian anti war populist that makes him better than the corporate puppets we’ve had for half a century or more.
Due to Trump telling the post office to slow the mail down, your jewelry orders may take longer to get to you--I ship with priority mail express 2-3 day shipping (you pay $9.99 per package) but I've been having customers tell me their packages are slow. I'm sorry for that :(

Frightening that you don’t mean Trump.
Thank God for and God Bless President Trump .
Name the last president who was more libertarian than Trump. Figure you probably have thoughts on that.

Biden will resist social change and allow interventionism. Contrast with Trump pulling out of Germany to the chagrin of the establishment.  Didn’t the DNC/Biden have primaries during the peak of COVID?
Trump ran on ending wars and has done better in 4 years than Obama in 8. Read we were pulling out of Germany. GOP/DNC hate it, so you know it’s the right move. If Tulsi is in a cabinet, I’m more likely to vote for that team.

President Trump did none of that. Mortality rate is less than 1% even with all the inflated numbers. Factor in the MANY undocumented cases where people fully recover (most with little to no symptoms) and the mortality rate plummets to that of the flu or less. On the other hand:

I have friends who love Trump and are good people filled with love--they just love him. But I also have, well had, friends who cut me off because I support black lives matter and civil rights for all. Politics needs to be discussed because its embedded in our hearts.
Was this the topic of Trump’s phone call with Putin?
Because it's how I feel. I've seen so much hate from the conservative far right who believe Trump is Jesus.   Of course, many of those who voted Trump in 2016 only did so because they felt they had no choice. But those who spread hate really hurt our country.
We gotta vote Trump outta there.
It’s „mission accomplished“ anyway. They got the footage for Trump‘s campaign ads. It was never about anything else.
To all of my international friends, I didn't vote for Trump. In fact, Trump didn't even win the vote.   Please don't think Americans support our snubbing our allies. Most of us don't.   Those who do have had their hateful hearts preyed on by Trump.

What part is false? More drone strikes have flown under Trump. He changed the rules of reporting civilian deaths from drone strikes. Countless innocents are dead because of this. The only thing that’s “false” is if the responsibility of the total death toll is too vague.
How do you feel about THIS video and its contents? Your theoretical video of a trump supporter in Chicago doesn't exist but if it did and the trump supporter was harmed and/or disrespected, as a black man, I would be just as disgusted as I am of this video for what its worth.

Unfortunately for you, none of that is true. But it is the narrative that's being provided to you, and I understand if you aren't confident enough to let go of the narrative and think for yourself. Most Americans though, know Trump is not a racist and is doing a great job.

Not all Americans, just the ones listening to Trump.
I believe it's my civic duty to hold our elected officials accountable for their actions (or lack thereof). You only see what Trump tells you to see... what's the difference?
Wrong. He does not have the right unless Congress says he has. States declaring a state of emergency or Trump declaring a national state of emergency still does not give him the authority to declare martial law on his own. BTW, I don't have a "team."
150,000 and counting. tRump is still golfing, campaigning &amp; throwing out conspiracy theories. What he’s NOT doing is leading. He gives mixed messages regarding health and his supporters believe him. Hence, the USA has the highest death toll on the PLANET.
The "federal" people he deployed in Portland were unmarked... I've not heard what area of federal law enforcement they were from. If they were soldiers, then Trump already violated the Posse Comitatus Act which prohibits the use of the military for law enforcement.
Trump has absolutely no basis for declaring nationwide martial law, and it still doesn't mean he can postpone the election (especially when he himself is touting it's safe to go back to school).
If Trump tried to declare martial law and postpone the election, he'd basically be declaring himself a dictator and destroying the Republic. If you support that, you might as well pack up and move to Russia... that's where you belong. Once again, your "facts" are incorrect.

Yea, that sounds like misinformation posted on Trump's campaign website.
What evidence is the basis of your concern? Oh, right, because Trump has directed you to be concerned. Lapdog.
I disagree. Supporting the Republican platform and blind "loyalty" to Trump are two very different things. Tying oneself to Trump or riding on his coattails because he's popular with some groups is a very different decision. The Republican party is not the "Trump party."

Trump didn't arrest anyone. The FBI did. You remember, the FBI that Trump hates? This has been an ongoing federal investigation since 2008.
The Trump admin has also produced the largest backlog of pending T-visa applications - the special visa created by the TVPA for immigrant trafficking survivors - along with the highest number of denials in the history of the program and the lowest number of approvals in 10 yrs.
The fact is most anti-trafficking groups criticize Trump administration, saying it has abandoned actual survivors of trafficking when they need any sort of immigration relief.
Stop giving Trump exclusive credit for stuff that's been done for the last 20 years. Congress passed the Trafficking Victims Protection Act in 2000.
Epstein was first investigated &amp; eventually arrested in 2005. Case was shut down by Alexander Acosta (served as Trump's Secretary of Labor for 2 years) &amp; was negotiated by Alan Dershowitz (one of Trump's attorneys). So many connections. Maybe Trump should have been indicted too?
I've long said I'd vote for a potted plant than Trump, so Biden and a rock sounds even better than that.
I think for a lot of Republicans, if they want to save their party, they should vote Blue up and down the ticket in November.  They need to point out that the direction Trump is leading them is wrong, and that's the best way to do it.
Barr started and reminded that he is looking forward to retiring because he knows he may be in trouble once Trump is gone.

As okay as you are with Trump hugging Jeffrey Epstein.
So your defense of Trump spreading information is that the media also does it? (Ever hear the saying, "Two wrongs don't make a right"?) If it's wrong for the media, then it's wrong for Trump, correct? Otherwise, you're saying there's a double standard.
Criticism for his incompetency and holding him accountable is not defamation. If it were legal defamation, Trump would sue. Provide examples of the "blatant lies," please.
I only heard one.  Trump didn't literally say inject bleach, he just said something that lead some people to believe he thought that would be a good idea.
Unless he was running against Trump.

Yea protested peaceful and if you are comparing this to the revolutionary war you are calling this war so trump can just send in the marines and be done with according to you
Trump said the operation warp speed vaccine has lived up to its name and cut down on some years and in some cases many years.   What? That’s really not saying anything as usual. You could have kept all that shit to yourself.
Departing for North Carolina, President Trump says he will not be visiting Rep John Lewis...  who is laying in state at the US Capitol.  No words...
Why are you building a 13 foot wall around the White House Dictator Trump?
this is just a repeat. same pic and "wish her well" that's it. fact is trump help to get Epstein charged the first time. and he does wish her well if she dies its gonna be a shit load harder. stop being an ass and think about the kids damn. why is that so hard?
Well, Trump certainly doesn't, and many Republicans have proven they don't either. Maybe we should start voting for the best individuals for the job instead of a particular party.
trump supporters are the main ones who strive to better help our vets so how dare anyone say horrible things about our amazing president  we love you keep up the great work
You think Trump has been the best president of all time. 😂   I hope you get better soon.

Trump Supporters when 21 said “I call  it KKK cause my Choppa hate Niggas”
“I take no responsibility” Trump really doesn’t. He doesn’t do anything.
Armed takeover of America when Trump and Barr declare martial law.
Well, the payroll tax cut -- you know, the one for which Trump said he'd veto the bill if it wasn't there -- was cut out.
Since when is "loyalty" to the presidential candidate a disqualifying criteria... haven't we learned enough from Trump?
Yes Judge it is ! As we both know this is only a DISTRACTION! Trump is so out of it at this point he is pulling whatever distraction’s out of
Trump suppresses Free Speech. He puts comedians on no-fly lists and calls peaceful protesters anarchists, all while he has a constant attack on the Media who are constitutionally protected by the first Amendment.  Right now, most Republicans are following that lead.
I don't do prescribe to the idea that treating each other fairly and equally is a plot to get rid of Trump and destroy the country.
They’re saving the trump administration time and money
Sleepy joe no one respects you they will only vote for you because they dont like trump
Take Trump's war on Protesters as an example.  Are there some people causing trouble, starting fires, etc? Yes.  Is every protester in that category? No.  By grouping them together, Trump's made enemies of them all, and shown his lack of empathy and tact.
Hey Lightfoot you are the worst Mayor and you don’t know how to run anything. I bet Pres. Trump was excited to get a letter from you. Tend to your own business and leave everyone else alone.
Read this thread. Biden and Pelosi are trying to claim Trump is attacking peaceful protestors. Nadler says Antifa is a myth. They claim violent cities are a result of Trump’s Covid. Democrats are lying.  Here is the proof. See for yourselves. How can you trust these politicians?
-China Hack - Russian Interference - Mail In Voting Fraud  Trump is going to pull all 3 of these to try and make the vote void.
I don’t see anything wrong President Trump using President Reagan’s Legacy! It keeps President Reagan’s alive! President Trump see President Reagan’s prove that his job abilities better than Democratic Congress!
neither do biden or trump
Trump repeals housing rule, amplifying appeals to racial bias - Los Angeles Times
Feds shoot &amp; kill anyone there will be a billion man march to the White House to drag Trump out physically.
Trump is not going to accept losing the election.
That's what they pay him for and imbedded the Little Troll in the Trump Camp.
Drugs are illegal, but the criminals still get them.  The problem is a lack of leadership.  Don't blame your inability on President Trump.  When you point that one finger at Trump, the other three fingers are pointing at you. You can't do the job!!
Don't worry about the media President Trump send Wolf from Home land security and get back law and order.
President Trump is Americas last man standing between Americans and socialist.
John Lewis hated President Trump because he could not explain were over 400 million bucks were used in his district or should I say misused. Another crooked politician.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.    DONALD TRUMP IS LYING TO YOU YET AGAIN.
With Trump it’s always take and never give.
Paid Trump Supporters for a Photo Op.
No one believes anything you say Eric Trump.
I thought you said you would be tweeting less and focusing on the real issues at hand Mr. Trump.
What we gonna’ do with all those people once Trump loses?
Trump Proves His Cognitive Abilities With Five Magical Words: Person, Wo...  via
Trump is going full reptilian
Not this white woman! Right is right &amp; wrong is wrong. I will NEVER support racism or sexism from anyone. tRump has divided this country by stoking the uneducated voter. We can fire him in November and replace him with decency &amp; kindness, but only if everybody who agrees VOTES!
Trump turning his back on the GOP. Who could have saw this coming.....
None of those tyrants had anything to do with Marx ideology. They just plagiarized his name. Just like when Trump showcased a Bible. You can’t blame Jesus for Trumps sins.
Trump is a bad man.
At this rate Covid and Flu will be devestating in the Winter. Not to mention what Trump and his goons pull off. Be Prepared!
Are you comparing Eisenhower to draft dodging bone spur Trump?
How can any decent moral American support Trump.   Seriously.
These Butt kissing wannabe politicians follow trump watch where they end up!
dude Trump?  Racist friend. White Power Mississippi boy I guess. So so disappointing.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Trump should have been removed from office.  for  but more so after his impeachment. You chose him over country and you were warned he would fail us again.
Just like you not support trump doesn’t make you anything besides a grown ass man with an political opinion. Small mindedness really is outdated, try different perspectives before jumping the gun and screaming racism.
“the democrats are turning the middle to the Right!”   actually mom, Trump is turning the middle to the left. i know this because i am one of them.   “DALLAS🥺 they kill the babies. Did i fail you as a parent??”
If I lived there I would get a petition signed of a lot of locals requesting President Trump to step in and help.
If she could get away with it. She'd kill them off, or get Hillary to do it for her. She want's to be "The Grand Nagus". Nancy's Rule of Acquisition: if you can kill off Trump and Pence it will increase profit.😂😂
They're supporting Trump whether they admit it or not.
Ted Cruz has abandoned his oath to America and the Constitution; he has become a card carrying member of the corrupt fascist Trump cult, and will do everything in his power to turn America into  a tyrannical demagoguery.
Columnist: If Martians saw this Trump clip, they'd be 'scratching their head'
you seriously are delusional. Seek out the facts because you look like and sound like an idiot. Trump did nothing in January February did nothing. He banned China from entering the country. Besides that trump is racist and actually hates blacks.
That is backwards. Even Trump didn't get a good education and had to pay other people to take his tests.
Trump is less fit for office. If you want to vote for someone better write in Elizabeth Warren, she is more than fit. If you prefer to vote for a conservative, write in Bill Weld. But don't pick the worst choice just because you don't like the only sane person still running.
Ivanka didn't get patents in China? Jr. isn't building a hotel in Russia? Trump doesn't have ties to Turkey?
No, I don't support Trump... so why would I move to China or Russia or any of his buddies' countries?   Unlike Trump, I think China's concentration camps are wrong and we shouldn't be asking them for help in our elections.
Pray All "True Americans" vote in November. If we don't the End begins. Keep praying that God shows us mercy in the next 5 months. If He allows America a second chance and keeps President Trump in office, I will know that God expects us to turn back to Him in 2021. Amen.
I really believe they were ready in 2016. Hillary got the popular vote, but she was plagued with "baggage" that many couldn't get past. Plus Trump cheated. I think with the right woman, it can easily happen in 4 years.
Sleepy Joe when can we expect a debate with President Trump?Are you a coward? Come out of your basement  now!! You can’t run a country hiding in a hide-away.
Aliens would probably recommend we remove Trump. Right after they cure Covid for us.
Where is all of the money you were going to invest in the democratic race against Trump?
I'm not shocked at all, Teddy. Anyone who isn't up Trump's ass knows this is the right thing to do; we've had enough of a fascist cult led by a traitor in Congress.
I didn't mean it that literally, it's just that many people seem to support Trump beyond reason, no matter what he's done or said. Country should come before Party and before any individual in that party.
Leah have you tried talking with Mr. Trump? I’m sure he would listen. He is a kind man. Give it a whirl
No... loving your country and freedom are not related to supporting Trump.  Trump worship is an entirely different animal, completely separated from a love or respect for the United States.
We always thought that aliens would sit in the wings until they were needed to save us from unmitigated disaster... e.g. if we were about to start a global nuclear war. I guess the Trump presidency was enough for them.
Of course I am going to boycott baseball. This kneeling garbage is a stupid protest against President Trump.
Trump is a stooge, most world leaders are able to manipulate him into doing what they want, and if they want the US to collapse then they want to keep him happy and in his current position.  I do not think that Trump is purposely helping China, he just wants them to help him.
So what your saying is that Trump has already succeeded in dividing the country?  My thoughts on "Obamagate" is that it's a stupid conspiracy theory about the past when we should be look to the future, and uniting our "divided" country.
Additionally, China wouldn't benefit from Trump leaving office. He is systematically destroying the US Government, which is opening up room in the global landscape for China to expand their reach, both economically and with their military.
Trump did not rebuild the military. And Obama did not destroy it. When Obama was President we still put more of our GDP on Military Spending than almost any other country. He lowered it a bit, but they did not "run out of bullets".
Fox news and OAN have a narrative to explain away the times that Trump says something that makes him sound like a fascist or racist or a bigot, so they are both spinning things in opposite directions.   We need to actually listen to his words and judge for ourselves.
If you actually want me to go over some reasons why I don't think Trump is a good President, I'd be happy to, but since you don't want to listen to me, as you've said, then just go find the answers to those questions yourself.
