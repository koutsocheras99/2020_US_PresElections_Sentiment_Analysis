Stitt standing with gaping open mouth right next to Herman Cain circled in red at the Trump Tulsa rally Cain died of Covid 6 weeks later. I think we know where sTitt picked up the virus. No masks on these stupid Republicans - find the rest of them.
Biden will probably just keep his cool and not get into an argument with trump because will turn it against Biden if he doesn't say every word perfectly when even trump can't do it but that's okay with trump cuz he's president
They haven't agreed on anything yet.  Trump has threatened to sign an executive order on it if the decision isn't reached by tonight.  (Friday)
I’m not going to believe anything that Trump or any of his Republican Senators, Governors or Mayors want to say. It’s baseless, worthless words. Trump is trying to make things look better because he only has less than 90 days before election.
Notice I said “One dumb thing” and not incredibly racist thing every time he speaks once a month. I wish Trump wasn’t the better choice here but if you think Biden has what it takes you are either willing to risk our entire country to get trump out or you are blindto what you see
Trump closed the country down to foreign travelers when we first found out covid was a problem. (Remember covid was hidden by China in fall 2019 months before December). It’s the local governments fault for covid responses in their state.
Never forget this affable dude who’d be cool to have a beer with was leader of the country during the previously worst time in history and just because Trump is worse doesn’t lessen Bush’s haneous tenure.
Who the bleep cares?? Certainly not me or the other millions of Trump voters! Only those that care are Dem losers!!

If you think that "poorer, less educated, and many have not left their home states" better describes Trump's critics than his voter base, you're living in an alternate universe. Completely delusional. I mean you may as well believe Thailand is pronounced "Thighland".
President Trump on Thursday declared an emergency for Connecticut and ordered federal assistance to the state to aid in its response efforts to the damage resulting from Tropical Storm Isaias.
You better not vote for Kanye!  He’s a Trump supporter and admitted to trying to take votes from Joe.  Not to mention he’s in a bad state right now.  Chief is just scared a Black Woman would be VP.
The #JobsReport is being touted by Trump. How come nobody is pointing out that most jobs gained are not NEW, but are RETURNING jobs, as some states reopen businesses. There's a BIG difference. Words &amp; terms matter!        &amp; just for grins:

Trump is a dangerously incompetent liar living in his own fantasy world. He actually thinks he has done a good job and he makes up numbers to prove it.
The unethical Oregon Governor is trying to blame Trump for Oregon’s rioting.  He needs to poise before a mirror with the Portland Mayor and blame the image he sees.  They can blame each other!!

President Trump Bans Dealings With Owners Of TikTok, WeChat
And it only took trump 3 years to do it, so imagine if he gets elected again, we will be looking at another 7 trillion increase more that every other president combined.
Why do you assume I'm a liberal because I don't like trump? Hes a terrible president, he hasn't done a single thing he said he was going to do and he's increased our national debt by 7 trillion since he took office. That's almost as much as Obama did
Hello President Trump. We love you in Oklahoma. Do you know that the election is going to be stolen from you ILLEGALLY by the Democrats? (1) Biden is NOT going to debate you. (2) Biden is SKIPPING his own Convention. We all saw this coming....

This guys wants Trump to be president for life
Trump has a plan?   What a freaking joke.  Look at virtually every other country in the world.  They have begun to reopen safely and start schools because they, listened to the scientists and didn’t call this a hoax.
And you’re suggesting g that trump is?   The difference my friend is that Biden will rely on advisors and his cabinet to let our country with him as the leader.   Trump has Jared and Ivanka but uses his failed real estate experience to make critical decisions.  And he lies!!
At least they’re willing to do a lockdown. I live in Oklahoma. Our governor just said we don’t need stimulus, he was at the trump rally without a mask, got corona and is now not willing to lock us down or do a mask mandate cuz he’s so proud that we are fully “open” 😡
I think we can all agree that Trump doesn’t come across politically correct and maybe he isn’t right for the role of President.  However, Biden is in the same boat.
I wish Trump would hurry up and do something about the Fake News!

Biden could literally say “fuck black people” and still get votes just because he “isn’t trump”
“Trump hoists the Bible. Biden lives by it.”  Well...there is that. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020
If you’ve dealt with dementia patients then you certainly recognize it in Trump.
There is no policy reason to be Never Trump if you are a Republican.  Conservative judges, pro life, tax cuts, regulation cuts, pro military, pro law enforcement, pro business, pro 2A.  Why on earth would any Republican be a Never Trump unless they seek love from the left?
Yeah, Trump really nailed picking out that elephant. Stop backing this moron!
Just wait till the Epstein conspiracy Theorist come out.   "Trump is going to fake his death before the hard evidence that he was in with Epstein comes out."

Joe Biden to win California it is a battle ground for Donald Trump it is very very important there for Donald Trump to win California it is very very very important for the battleground state who went back to the White House.
The battleground is in California for Donald Trump it is a battle ground          And he will win that one that’s what          I’m looking at I did look at this on Google it is very very important for COVID-19 that is a battleground it is not for Joe Biden. Donald Trump sets up
It’s ok to think Biden isn’t sharp and quick on his feet when speaking, but don’t pretend Trump sounds any better. He doesn’t make sense a good amount of the time and he repeats words a lot. #SleepyDon
Lay out truth for the 2020 voters of what occurred.  DOJ-FBI-CIA-NSA-Obama &amp; Biden-Hillary-Rice—ALL instigators &amp; coverup artists wanting Trump to be illegally persecuted &amp; crucified. DISAPPOINTING BUT EXPECTED—THEY WERE UnAmerican FOR 8 YEARS. NO WONDER HILLARY LOST HER EMAILS

American's need to realize that Canada has had always had their backs in word and deed.  Being treated in this manner while Russia pays bounties on dead US soldiers is both infuriating.   Trump slaps tariffs on Canadian raw aluminum
On July 13th, Biden was up by 8.8 points over Trump, and today he's only up by 6.4 points.  In the last month, Trump has narrowed the gap by 2.4 points.  Good sign!
You have got to be kidding me?  I KNOW I say that a lot due to statements by Trump.  Joe Biden actually GOES to church. Not just for a photo op after gassing Americans. Remember, Trump had a photo of Biden praying at church in his ad. Trump can't even quote his fave scripture!
Earlier I was wondering if there are more journalists of color covering this Presidential election than in 2016. They won't be so surprised at white voters' Trump support.
When does  not give a good speech! Trump is a beast on stage!
Hearings about Obamagate has started! Trump gave Kodak over 700 million start making pharmaceuticals in America we will now produce 25% in the world. he also today cut pharmaceuticals 50 to 60% in America.
I mean .. the TIMING of it.  People JUST lost #unemployment benefits and #Biden.. while doing nothing to help checks happen, posts a video showing off his #corvette #car.. do you really think he won’t be absent weekends like #trump is?
The Clinton Foundation has been done and done again. All that was found was a true charity doing many good works throughout the Third World. What about the Trump Foundation? Or I should say, one of Trump's piggy banks?
Damn you all. Once again Trump uses an official WH event as a campaign stop...lying about Biden and God. This from the man who never goes to church. He will be paying for a lot when he meets God face to face.
Tell that to the 158,000 families who lost a loved one under your watch while trump did nothing
Trump makes certain comments that are cues to his investors and major donors so they know which stock(s) are “in play”. Trump has a history of conducting insider trading schemes through special messages since he took office with every press briefing and/or rally he holds.
He was also probably a member of Sam’s Club or Costco.  What’s your point?  Oh yeah, Trump is still living in your head rent free.  Lol.
That was one of the best interviews showing just how much Trump does not understand.
Wait - you have a PhD in Sex Counseling AND you support Trump - is this just a bid to garner his business?

It’s funny because Trump is def not a believer in any faith and Biden is a practicing catholic
so the plan is to keep biden hidden as much as possible and hope the anti-trump energy fuels his win, okay, now what is the plan for the next 4 years should that happen?? unprecedented puppetry brazenly displayed.
A judge accepted not-guilty pleas on the misdemeanor charge of obstructing an officer and ordered the four defendants, including a Norman city councilor and Tulsa teacher, to return Feb. 1.
Partly correct,  it's definitely not going away before Nov. 4th,  given the complete lack of leadership from trump.
Exhibit A: The Trump Foundation. I remain unhappy that it was solely a civil action that shut it down. Criminal fraud charges should have been brought.
Yeah, except Biden is a pretty devout Catholic and has a solid record as such. Trump will literally say anything to pander to people who don't have the comprehensive intellect to understand they're being played

The Trump Way. Gotta make money off everything I do as president.
This has nothing to do with the Second Amendment. Trump stole from his foundation and it was shut down. Those in charge  of the NRA stole funds and the same thing should happen to them.
what was racial makeup of OA FG?  Why did the 3 women say they are still considering trump?
This does not have to be legislated. President Trump should just write a rule and be done with it.

I can’t disagree with you there. Because I’m sick of all of the conflict of interest and corruption within our govt and congress. But again, why are we deflecting from Biden? As if Biden is a superior human and candidate? Atleast Trump is the lesser of the two evils.
This is why the slowing down of the postal deliveries is Trump's priority with DeJoy.

Gov. DeWine is third GOP positive near Trump in recent testing
It’s the other way around. Obama refuses to let Trump unveil it. Who can blame him? Trump threw a hissy and removed the portraits of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. I’d sit for Trump to announce he’s resigning, otherwise, fuck’em.
No trump no kkk no fascist USA. Remember #blackwallstreet #blacklivesmatter
I do agree...it's detrimental to Biden's cause and gets the backs up of the Trump sheep.

OK ⁦ let’s learn the difference between the good guys and the bad #MAGAts. Surely you guys can tell the difference since Trump and his minions are always lying!  Twitter temporarily stops DNC from tweeting after calling out Trump
This is incredibly inaccurate, not representative of most conservatives, which is why Trump was underestimated last time &amp; why he will be underestimated again. Keep up the OrangeManBad thinking so we get 4 more years of great policies and progress. And more good judges.
I hear that many people wish that Trump would depart for the great hereafter. Why are we paying for his campaign trips?

You have absolutely no clue what your talking about just because Trump says it’s fake news doesn’t make it fake news wake up
Good luck with that.... and thanks for boosting Trump in the polls. No way Americans are going to be good with you going after the one organization that fights for our 2nd amendment rights!
Stitt says he looks forward to Birx's visit and that she was "invited" to come to Oklahoma as she tours other states. President Trump said Birx will visit Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and Arkansas next week. He did not say she was invited to any of those states.
Yes, I took and passed the class this week. I am going back today to practice with my husband.  I am pretty sure all the women are TRump supporters. They equate violence = democrats.
Let's see ... when Biden was in the VP spot, did 160,000 Americans die from his inaction? Were 30,000,000 people out of a job? Were people rioting in the streets from coast-to-coast? Wake up, try to pay attention. The country is in ruins &amp; it is ALL TRUMP'S FAULT.
Keep Trump not Biden bad for USA
Next up: Dissolve the Trump presidency. Vote.
That's very likely true, but Biden still wouldn't be able to do anything about a state's prosecution of Trump.
So... yeah, idk what to say here others then Biden has kinda started doing the Trump/Michael Scott thing of starting a sentence and not having any idea where it’s going.
Oddly enough, Trump's Whitehouse has yet to hit the GDP peak that Obama did.  Again, data we can see on Dept of Labor.  Nobody will destroy anything more than it has been over the last 3 years.  It's not humanly possible to generate more hate and chaos.  Nice chat.
Respectfully, that is false.  As of May 2019 the economy started a slow trend down.  Not bad, but downward.  It continued and January was a very poor month for O&amp;G and manufacturing.  Trump said he it is sad we can't maintain a GDP of 4% and noted how bad Obama was...
Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the coronavirus task force, is set to visit Oklahoma next week on a tour to deliver "aggressive, tailored and targeted guidance" to states that are struggling to contain outbreaks.
Just wait till they say he will destroy Trump so badly, that he will just send his VP to debate Trump.
Trump has never mentioned another site.  If or when he does, I will listen.  Until then I'm fine here.
At first glance I thought your underwear said "TRUMP" then realized it was just "PUMP" lmao
Best news I've heard all day. Now if trump would just go away that would be great.
Replace "the NRA' with "Trump" and this sentence still works.
I feel like these last two sentences were for an audience of one. She's telling Trump "NY is coming for you.".
I don't need to hear a debate. I am voting for Biden regardless. And, come on, we already know how stupid Trump is.
There are also 2 apps.  Parlor and Parlar.  The people pushing it I do not trust either.   Has Trump ever mentioned another site?
Oh how so true. President Trump is ready for the battle to begin. I think I heard that Biden wants to make sure he can take notes to answer from because he can’t think how to answer questions without them. Lol to my understand only. Lol

Cher, no Trump wouldn’t care even then.  Trump has caused us to live in a extremely sad country.  Feels like the world is coming to an end.  If we have to deal with him any longer I am ready for the end. I can’t believe he has caused this. He really is evil.

Prove it James. Attacking the media is the first step in creating an authoritarian regime. It is why Trump has done it since day 1. You only want people to believe you. What happened in Portland will be remembered as an attack on civil liberties. We won't forget your complicity.
And that's the only way Trump and the republicans would have a case, but they don't want to give up their power to spy on the DNC (which they did with Biden) and the American people. This was an incredibly stupid political move on the GOPs part.
What are you disagreeing with? Disagreeing with the fact the accusations, which are obviously intentionally vague and non legally defined by Trump, are technically not even illegal is just a fact. You can feel upset because Trump is your daddy, but those are just your feelings
Trump is still the better option of the two. 🤷🏽‍♂️ easy presumption.

Trump also said he would reveal his health care plan within two weeks.

Billy Graham is and always was proud of Franklin. Just because you don’t like Donald Trump means nothing. Get over your hate
Trump Can't Quit Us  via
President Trump won the White House fair and square.
I'm not sure you understand anything. Comey was rogue. There was no predicate whatsoever to investigate Flynn or anyone on Team Trump. None.
LeBron says NBA won't miss Trump as a viewer - via  App
What is AG James’s announcement is that there is no wrongdoing by the Trump family? Maybe they got to her?
Many of those tests are obsolete. Because we You know, it's called science - and all the sudden everything's better. - Donald Trump ...  I can't ... I just can't. I can't already
Pro Trump at Stanford? Pray for him
I mean, who started taking rubles first, Moscow Mitch or Trotsky Trump?
Trump endorsed it
If Congress passed legislation to postpone which they can, trump would have to sign and given the situation i suggested he might not. Given the situation I suggested a delay would be welcomed by the Congress or it would be Trump vs Jorgensen
Trump 2020
I have great respect for liberals who understand that Trump is the better choice November 3rd.
Please take a minute and list the promises from the trump 2016 campaign that he fulfilled.   We’re waiting.
CONFIRMED: Twitter Official Who Announced Trump Campaign Account Suspension Is Former Kamala Harris Press Secretary
And trump photoshopped his own picture on the front of Time and had it hung in his properties.   He’s an insecure idiot.
I'm with 8. There's a combination of fear and disbelief in his eyes that only Trump can cause.
Hey dim wit, THEY WERE INVESTIGATED BY TRUMP AND THEY FOUND NOTHING.   FACTS.
A Trump election conspiracy collapses - it must be a day of the week
She had a ticket to the event. Trump's team asked to have her removed. Yet,  didn't charge trump for this police service to this "private event" Bynum is just as complicit.
is corrupting a critical civil service - the US Postal Service - in an attempt to suppress voting. Trump is more than a con-artist and grifter. He is a criminal and a traitor. #ImpeachTrumpAgainPray for the safety of Trump. He made a comment yesterday that was a little strange. Said a lot of people want to hurt him. Another of rich powerful people. And thats why he rushed signing some bills. Because no body els ever will. Kinda strange
I want Trump.. but the same.
The "GOP", Gang Of Perpetrators, are in compliance w Russia in this.  They want tRump to have another term so they can continue the tyranny against US.  Against those seeking refuge from dictators &amp; against our allies.  Twitterverse, it's time for us to make a move on Washington!
Fuck it. I'd even vote for Richard Nixon himself (were he still alive and eligible to run, of course) if he were the only way to kick Trump out of office; and I spent half my life wishing I could have personally burned Nixon at the stake. That's how dangerous I feel Trump is.
I think you underestimate people who support Trump and their worldview. I have no problem with ‘change’ in a generic sense. I will resist change that limits freedom and takes more money away from people to enrich government.  In my experience, socialism’s cons outweigh its pros.
Uhh...did Donald Trump refuse to rent to Black people?
How about the doctor that lies about Trump’s health! What was his name?
Nancy Shively: Opinion contributor, Teacher: I was a reluctant Trump voter. Coronavirus is the end of my Republican identity.  via  July 23, 2020
That’s President Trump to you soy boy, maybe even Mr.Trump.
Furthermore, Id rather be governed by 535 trump supporting rednecks living in rural America rather than people who live on either the east or west coast. Or by the current powers that be in the democrat party
I mean, do we want to manifest it by questioning it? I thought nothing shocks me to the point of my jaw dropping until Trump's #AxiosOnHBO interview Monday. I had to flip down my rear view mirror to double check. Jaw definitely dropped.
I think the funniest thing trump supporters will say is, “well you didn’t complain about (insert issue) when Obama was doing it,”. Like yes... I was literally a 12 year old🤣
Is this, like, a Trump MadLib?
"Donald Trump owning beauty pageants is like Michael Vick owning pet stores."
Donald Trump Jr. /2024 BABY!/
But what if trump applies to all of the above?
So you’re having in person rally’s ? That’s as bad as trump. #biden2020
Universal media strategy to make Trump appear less lucid than Biden will not work.  Biden is losing his mental capacities.  Trump is just stupid (can't be bought, pro-American worker, pro-American Industry, thwarts Chinese aggression) and WILL BE A 2-TERM PRESIDENT!
Just wait until Joe has his say. I heard they’re letting him make a statement Monday. Trump will no doubt be the fool.
When I saw there was no longer a checks and balances. That virtually no one in the party would stand against Trump and Trump would openly attack the few that did.
Joe would’ve already made this virus the equivalent of the common flu if he was running the show. Meanwhile Trump’s playing golf.
lol I think he's worse than Trump at this point. The fucking White House is sending a doctor because he refuses to follow basic bullshit
Apparently, showing Trump’s absolute failure as a president is election interference. That’s some tortured logic. Does this guy ever make sense?
You know Mr. Acosta. The more the majority of the news media hate this man, the more I like him.  During the 16 GOP primaries, Trump was not my choice, or even in my to 7. But now, I’m glad he won and hope he gets re-elected.
There are white hats in crypto too. #buylitecoin  The fed is dead but it’s a good thing. Digital dollar is not being created at the fed &amp; if it is, it has no value.  Trump has moved the debt to the fed but the assets to the Treasury.  #rainbowcurrency #nesara
They need to fear monger all the idiotic Trump followers in Oklahoma!  Most think it's just the flu and hyped up by the media.  I'm related to some of the morons who buy that shit by the truck full.  It's going to get them killed and possibly kill family members.  #trumpvirus
And you can't see through a single trump lie. He's been doing it for years you've had every chance
Trump is the biggest liar ever, and if you can’t see that, maybe fuck all the way off.
You’re asking what does it matter that companies can’t make insurance cost more for those that can’t afford insurance. The entire idea is to make it affordable. That’s what Trump claims he’s doing, it’s what Obama tried to pass...
Trump not Acosta
So apparently the film Idiocracy wasn’t  a comedy after all, looks like it was a fairly accurate prediction of Trump’s presidency  #Idiocracy  #AnyoneButTrump2020

"Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions — a protection which already exists under Obamacare"
That's because they are Trump goolies
Hope voters are smart enough to see what bipolar Kanye West is up to with Trump's blessing
Seriously I can’t believe Trump is ruining our national parks for money. Not shocked just repulsed by so much greed and his egotistical power. You do not exist to me or Americans. You psycho. Stay off OUR land! #TrumpFailsAmerica #grandcanyon #GOPCorruptionOverCountry
Here we go, Tucker giving Kanye some love.  Any votes they can take from Biden they will.  Kanye sucks tucker sucks and trump sucks.  Tucker Carlson praises Kanye West as 'most compelling voice against Planned Parenthood'  #FoxNews
Each of these wastes of oxygen payed $300,000+   To hit a ball with a stick at Trump's field of grass  Think about that a lil' bit
Don't worry. Trump will continue to do a great job!
I wouldn’t use nazi Germany as a comparison. It’s not going to go over well with people. Lots of Jews are for Trump. If they read that they would be horrified at that comparison.
Trusted his advisors? You mean the ones that told him about it LAST YEAR and he chose not to do anything about it? Governors shut down their states for a month and trump demanded they open back up. Congress voted to provide aid and even then he only wanted to help red states.
another federal failure under trump ... almost as if by design
I was checking out at the grocery store and the dude bagging my groceries had jokes... “What goes up but never comes down?” Helium? “No, Trump’s ego.” “What is the only appropriate Covid-19 joke?” This one I guessed right.
He is starting to get Trump hair......
If I see one more “this history expert/part time plumber who accurately predicted every election since Taft says Trump will loose” headline I’m gonna lose my shit. We said the same thing in 2016. There’s too much at stake to take anything for granted. Fucking vote.
Pres. Trump holds Friday evening briefing
Yes. It’s literally the reason McCain voted against dismantling it and Trump hated him
Your bio. Hoping to live through this so I can vote against Donald trump...   Jesus Christ, what a silly over the top dramatic thing to say? Hoping to live through this.  Pleas stop talking to me.  I’m getting dumber just engaging with you.
MSM treats OAN the same way lifetime politicians treat President Trump.   With disdain.
Yes, Don Trump is a true man of the people. Well at least those able to afford membership in his clubs.
Well I'm biased, because if history tells us anything, Trump lies about everything.
So sad! This could have been prevented. 💔
Welcome to Trump's America.
I'm shocked. Shocked, I say. 😐
Trump's contempt for America knows no bounds.
The oilfield has been ruined by Trump ! Did you know that ? He lifted the refs and over produced .He has been horrible for our area..
I’m confused. Where was the restraint the last 3 years? We are already too deep in debt to recover. We need a currency reset. Financialization, fractional reserve lending, and federal reserve intervention are what got us here. Trump will be the fall guy for decades of $ abuse.
At least, my ex admits Trump has messed up bad!
Biotch, my ex has a beach home there and he did leave ! He said he was safer there than Texas! He is a Trump lover so I might leave! You’ll are crazy..
Thanks for the shoutout!
F them Trump trolls! I am mad tonight ! I am tired!
Donald Trump isnt just a disease. He’s a pandemic coming to end the globe and we must to our best do survive it. We are not ready for another illness to ravage the globe its time we put an end to Donald Trump and save the earth again
I miss my dad ! He would hate Trump and we would have a great time being mad together .. I think he would protest .. I was Republican when he was alive.. He said Girl, you aren’t with that rich guy anymore! I changed parties while he was dying.. My daddy was awesome ..
During the Spanish Flu, the consistent messaging was that wearing a mask is the patriotic thing to do. From the beginning Trump radicalized that same “patriotic” base against wearing a mask and all his attempts fall apart because he’s just too lazy to put and keep a mask on
America  and the  want to cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, SNAP, Our Healthcare  and now Trump and the GOP want to destroy America with Covid-19! Don’t let this happen VOTE BLUE 2020! Bring America back💙🇺🇸💙
All of that, and I didn’t have space to include that Trump is currently ordering his justice department to argue to the Supreme Court that duly passed law, doing exactly what he just writ by fiat, is unconstitutional.
What I love about President Trump  is he plays the msm and the democrats  like a fiddle What they hate about Trump is he turned republican  They loved his money when he was  handing it out
So...Obama had to fight, tooth and nail, despite having a super majority in Congress, to get pre existing conditions in the ACA...then, it was the number one issue the GOP used to get congress back...now, Trump just thinks he can do it by EO? And GOP is just👌🏻 w/this?
that $600 just gives people $15/hr. Those idiots want to give Trump the glory of stimulus check and $400. Call Trump personally threaten them if they/he does that you will never let BUSINESS' not be able to be sued pass!
Trump displayed (okay, read statement) more compassion for Beirut (yes, an awful tragedy) than for any of the 160k Americans lost to COVID-19. #TrumpIsDemented
Yep, that's why they are already coming out with , "Trump won't accept election results ".
Your party needs to act Senator. The Republican senate needs to put trump in check with the constitution
Did tRump change his diaper before?
God forbid if our great leader pres. trump caught covid-19 and met his demise what should his tombstone say?
Trump campaign keeps pushing for earlier debate
Ahhh a bunch elitist azzhats who have ridden the trump chrome and glass coattails at the expense of the average Americans trying to feed their children!
Does everyone realize this entire nightmare began because Don Trump was offended by Barack Obama's jokes about him at a White House Correspondent's dinner years ago?
I fucking HATE this take. Will we get forward with Biden, not as far as any of us wants for sure. But Trump will drag us backwards into full blown racism.
Now all Trump supporters have to admit we “have plenty of money” to hand out.   Personally, I’d like all the federal taxes I paid last month to be refunded back to me.
Anna Navarro is a “big get” for Team Obama (I didnt know Obama was seeking 3rd term 😱) like Rush Limbaugh is a big get for Trump.  Just another example of media cheerleading for Biden.🙄
Even  is not airing Trump’s “press conference.”
Ha, that's SUCH a good argument. Obviously, you don't remember when he said this. He'd align himself with Satan to be VP. Doesn't mean he's not racist. Wow... Name ONE racist thing Pres Trump said about Obama...waiting....
the payroll tax cut trump just announced with permanently damage social security.          This is so very wrong. Mark you’re a fool  you need to take   on her deal
Every single day since January 2017 I have said/thought that I cannot believe Donald fucking Trump is our President. #TrumpIsDemented  and his #TrumpWordSaladLoop is excruciating 😖
Fun Fact: America is still waiting for Trump’s Infrastructure Week.
Trump said some company was firing people and bringing in foreigners for lower prices. I think he meant wages. But as usual it sounded weird.
U.S. Intelligence Says Republicans Are Working With Russia to Reelect Trump
ObamaCare, a law that Republicans promised to repeal for 6 years and then suddenly forgot about the day Trump got inaugurated.
So I am assuming the United States will be included in this list given how Donald Trump has decimated our country?
Yeah, I'm not following. Why were republicans fighting against this so hard if Trump was going to just end up giving it out anyway?
COVID cases are rising &amp; still power outages in New Jersey Gov Murphy is having dinner at Trump's golf course. Nobody should be there! Club got special exemption from rules early on.  Revenge (FU USA)is on the menu tonight.
Trump's gonna sign an executive order that requires health insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions.  ... It's called Obamacare.
I don’t sound anything. Obama is a great president. Didn’t say he was the greatest, I don’t think even he would say that. But trump on the other hand has been awful, one scandal after another and all of his own doing.
So if it's EVERYTHING dems wanted, and Trump is just going to give it to them, why did republicans fight against it for so long?
Trump is either in complete denial or just really doesn’t grasp the responsibilities of the job... or he just doesn’t give a shit about average janes &amp; joes...
A note to MSNBC and CNN, don't cover this Trump campaign ad.
Sir, on any scale trump comes out last.
I got to rip Trump, Bice &amp; Neese and praise Horn in a survey this afternoon so that was fun
you are a disgrace and you do not love this nation. If you did you wouldn’t be doing what you’re doing. Don’t claim you love Jesus if you still support trump you don’t
SMH! As a U.S. citizen, I just ask that you not judge the majority of us based on the Trump administration. We envy the people of New Zealand for having a leader with integrity, dignity, leadership, and intelligence. We can’t relate currently. 😫
Good for you for doing that. Trump wants our children to be his “cost of doing business” for ridding the country of Coronavirus.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Trump must be removed -  because we failed to hang the Dulles bros., GH Walker, Prescott Bush, et. al., for financing Hitler, and trying to overthrow FDR to install a pro-Nazi govt. in 1934.   From 1:07:00 min. Sheehan CV
this is a move out of trump’s playbook and tbh i knew stitt was a trump republican but i at least thought he was the “family values” type that feigns dignity while doing fucked up shit but no he’s genuinely just as fucked up as trump
I feel the same: "Given the unique state of our planet right now, and the ways in which 2020 has forced humans to examine the way we treat one another, I cannot in good conscience recommend Facebook to anybody."   #deletefacebook #socialmedia
Not a Trump sticker between a pride flag and black lives matter sign
#Ididthis piece on religious organizations getting a PPP pass by the Trump Administration:
I've heard some say they appreciate the work he's done in isreal. (I'm not a Trump fan at all, that's just what one friend told me.)
24/7 unless I MUST go out. Since all alone I must grocery shop &amp; pay bills. I'm in Trump Country where NO masks are worn.
Trump happened. God, help us.
Didn't Trump claim he we wouldn't need contributions to his 2016 campaign because he was so rich?
Distract &amp; Deflect probably. We know Trump said he didn't &amp; we know he won't. They have so much incoming shit, trying to look like they care. But until Trump says it, it's definitely not something we should consider as the real story.
A few things. 1, trump and Biden are both white supremacists in my eyes that do not have the best interest of my people. 2, if you can’t say “because of this policy or this executive order” this means you don’t even want a Biden presidency
Dear capitalists,  No one ever created a job without first having customers. There will be no customers until they feel safe. No one is safe with Trump.  Adam Smith was a fraud. He lived with his mother and inherited his father’s fortune.
Oh hell, Trump found pics of you with young boys I guess.
I’ll start a fundraiser for your bail. 😂🤣😂 He doesn’t care. He was also in a meeting today with no mask or social distancing? He’s Trump 2.0  😡😡
This is what I get stuck on too. How do we keep ourselves safe if someone will not take accountability &amp; change. Like how would we deal with someone like Trump? Or would there be no more Trumps created if everyone had access to mental health care &amp; there wasn't income inequality?
trump even lies about the lies he's lying about! Well over 20,000+ confirmed lies &amp; counting! #LiarInChief #GOTV2020 #BAMN
It’s no secret Trump 2020
Trump has never negotiated a deal. He cons saps.
I honestly wonder what trump has on him.
How sad. I'm sure the Trump people behind him will take it to court.
Yes, under Trump flip flops are mandated for all federal workers.
The people would never let that happen. Trump will win. Even after Trump, communism will never happen here. The people will fight to never let that happen.
Just more ways Don Trump is looking out for the needs of the common people.
You mean trump has dementia and is a racist.
Remember when republicans had a conniption fit every time Obama signed an executive order? Remember how they declared it unconstitutional? Apparently that was all bullshit.  Mnuchin Says Trump to Take Executive Action After Talks Stall
So the main message is you will be part of a Trump campaign commercial? Not hey you are wanted for attempted murder and we are coming to get you?
“You know what solves it?” Mr. Trump told Fox News. “When the economy crashes, when the country goes to total hell and everything is a disaster. Then you’ll have a [laughs], you know, you’ll have riots to go back to where we used to be when we were great.”
Megan and cardi have really hit a nerve with conservatives. First we are all wondering how yall heard and/or saw the video. Second, megan and cardi are not role models. Third, if your a trump republican, you are a fucking hypocrite
You'd think all those republican senators were getting a cut of the action from either Trump, or Putin.....oh...wait.......
Yes, yes they are under the Trump Era.
Looked here  Judge rules E. Jean Carroll can continue to seek Trump's DNA in defamation suit
My Brothers and Sisters in Jesus Christ in these United States, please identify for us what real, verifiable benefit the presidency of Donald Trump has been for the Church or for the Gospel.  No need to answer immediately.  Take the weekend.  I’ll wait.
Yeah, its how human history has worked for centuries. The problem is that the American ideal is to demand instant gratification. To compare to other topic, we don't want slightly better Trump, we want Bernie. But politics has never worked like that. So hopefully we get Biden.
When you can’t pay rent, the management will not ask if you voted democrat or republican. When a persons comes to the door with an eviction notice, they don't ask if you are a Trump supporter or not. Nobody is immune to this just like this pandemic.
Trump is funny. He makes me laugh. But still. He still has to be held accountable for the fucked up shit he did
Wow. Trump is corrupt as fuck. Tax fraud, bank fraud, paying off a porn star (his lawyer went to jail for that). His going to jail.
Biden will be better than Trump thought He was!
If we get Bama and LSU I'm calling President Trump IMMEDIATELY!!!!!
tRump is MOST CERTAINLY NOT THE ANSWER! Anything is better than this corrupt lunatic! We need to restore dignity, peace and decency to our nation! Biden will do fine! After 4 years we can go from there! #RepublicansAgainstTrump
He should be at the table but so should more of congress. No they’re not doing it to take down trump. They are doing it help Americans. Republicans don’t give a shit they’re mostly millionaires. Doesn’t matter if we the people can put food on the table
The economy will not fully recover until the country gets the coronavirus under control.. lockdowns did contribute to the economic impact, the vast majority of our current economic pain is caused by Americans taking precautions against getting sick.
Believe me when i say, i knew what i said would be, so you say, thought provoking. Aint nothing a little Trump Wall cant fix. Murder in the Streets! Divide the people for they cannot be trusted! A harsh reality but I'm grateful for the little i have.
If you think a Mises Stan account would be backing Trump, there’s some light reading I could suggest
What effect will Donald Trump Jr.'s recent tweet have on $NAK?
Cowgirls for Trump!!  It’s tax free weekend!!  #trumpthat #cowgirlsfortrump #aqhya #worldshow  Oklahoma State Fair

We need for all the other democracies to sanction trump for doing what he sanctioned Carrie Lam for doing to Hong Kong. We need to know if we still have any allies.
These mother fuckers LITERALLY said last week that Trump was killing children by reopening schools.
POTUS should be at the negotiating table but he can careless about the American people.instead trump sends meadows and munchin.
Thankful for the Trump Administration’s $29 million broadband investment in rural Oklahoma! This funding will help us in our vision to improve connectivity for all 4 million Oklahomans.   Read more here ↘️
I noticed she changed from "defend trump" to "support trump." I assume this is because she knows he's indefensible.
Trump will still win Alabama so who cares who you “say” your family is voting for. I do find it incredibly stupid that no one in the family has an original thought from the others.  🤪
No, it’s totally a coincidence that a week or 2 after Roger Stone gets out of prison all of these Republican operatives—including those that worked directly for Stone on Trump ‘16 campaign—are working to get Ye on the ballot in a handful of states he has no chance of winning
there you go, you have commercial on Trump, Ron Johhnson &amp; Lindesy Graham who are peddling Russian propoganda. The ODNI just released statement!
the reason trump needs to ban tiktok
Trump, less personal battles and more leadership! Was once wwg1wga, now I’m just looking to go......
Also, Elliot Abrams, found guilty in the Iran-Contra affair, is now the envoy to Iran, a further example of the shitty swamp corruption of the Trump administration.
It depends.  Has the White House released any transcripts of communication between Trump &amp; Putin..?
Seriously though, are there really very many people who would even want to have dinner with Trump?
YES!! 2nd STIMULUS TODAY!! $2,400/mo | Trump's Executive Order  via  this guy is full of shit😡
Conservative whites are still overwhelmingly voting for Trump.
This predatory quote by Trump: "You know, I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything...Grab ’em by the pussy. You can do anything."
Trump
Trump is pathetic!  We need real leadership.  Vote!
Which Trump has not done. How again is he cosmopolitan?
You make a big deal over Benghazi. It was just one example of the scandals and coverups of the previous administration. I’ll grant you that Obama was probably marginally better than Trump, but it was very marginal. He was an eloquent speaker, though, I’ll give him that.
Trump ads are popping up in searches, sites etc. This one seems subversive.           msm-media-accountability-survey/?utm_medium=ad &amp;utm_source=dp_googlesd&amp;utm_

yeah sure... you know Trump formed the Corona Virus Task Force, around January 31st... while he was being impeached by congress... orange man bad??
All of Trump's speechwriters.
Constantly berating someone in an effort to coerce them is actually the DEFINITION of bullying.  And to boot, you assume I'm a Trump supporter, just like you assume Carano is a racist.  Seems you haven't developed that fourth synapse yet.
Mark it: aid negotiations will fail, Trump will EO, Congress will sue. Why? Might as well find out what SCOTUS thinks should happen during a Legislative failure. Do you have a King or a Republic?
It was really sad to Elon go from a Tech genius to a Trump supporting shit tier meme poster. #IMissTheOldElon
Watching this clown double down on his misunderstanding of linguistics is actually the funniest thing I’ve seen all day. His name is literally from a language that uses aspirate/non-aspirate sounds. He of all ppl should know the h means aspiration &amp; Trump said it wrong 🤡
bill nye is a scientist. LIE. the war on drugs was to stop drug use. LIE. if you like your health insurance you can keep it. LIE. gender wage gap. LIE. abortion is for rape victims. LIE. the food pyramid is healthy. LIE. gulf of tonkin. LIE. trump put kids in cages. LIE.
Macaulay Culkin supported Trump?
I guess but most Christians don’t follow his teachings.  If they did Trump would not have their support the way he does.  They also wouldn’t glorify the money the way they do.  They also wouldn’t be against making sure everyone had health care or caring for the poor
Literally what the hell is going on right now with this country?
'regardless of the treatment and response to the woman VP, the reaction will be affirmative for the presumptuous confirmation bias laid out before she was even chosen.' Think it'll be worse than how people treat Trump? My guess is no. 🤷🏼
Trump is a liar same thing
Trump murders irony again. Can some other major countries please sanction Trump for the same damn thing? It would really help us to know who is on our side.
Donald Trump has the blood of a fucking 7 year old child on his hands now.
Prayers for you and your family! God in heaven, please protect our President, Donald J. Trump and his family from all enemies foreign and abroad. Guard his heart from all the hate and evil that is targeting him and his family! If God is for us then who can stand against us! Amen
Also debatable whether Trump is a billionaire and whether that has any relevance.  This idea that he’s playing 5D chess while the rest of us are blind to sophistication is troubling.
Will Trump use that “unilateral action” like he threatened?
Most of Trump's opponents have not been to prison so there's that.
Don’t think it’s a cause for celebration. Better than Trump but only marginally. We should be able to do so much better.
I JUST FOUND OUT I WAS FOLLOWING DONALD TRUMP GONNA GO THROW UP
😂 you are playing right! So we doing stupid shit again like 2016. Just come out and say bruh! You want trump to win

Check out #WalkAway .  It’s stories of former democrats who’ve switched to the Republican Party.  A lot of them lost family, friends, and jobs when they said they supported Trump,  we have LGBTQ people, African Americans, Latinos and every other group you can imagine.
I really didn't think anyone could be worse, then Trump Lite shows up.
Trump needs to be held accountable. The scope of his criminality cannot be ignored. If he gets a pass then the next republican in that office will be even worse.  Will Trump face real consequences for his crimes? The answer will haunt America's future
After watching interviews with several members of Trump’s administration this week I think Trump is sharing his stash. They all actually seem high. Very high.
Well we know pelosi isn’t prayerful for trump I don’t know anything on biden but funny he hasn’t condoned the burning of bibles if he’s for god
Liberals think right wingers are insane for believing pizzagate and Qanon, but also believe Trump is a Russian operative that works for Vladimir Putin.
This is your daily reminder that Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump by 2,865,075 votes. #25th #Corrupt #TrumpShutdown #Unstable

How about working with trump verses agains him

That's one of the things it's been about since Day 1:  College athletics: The NCAA did their part and stayed quiet early in the pandemic.  They let Trump &amp; Co push the K-12 narrative and waited for the trickle up.
This sounds like a Donald trump tweet 😂😂😂
The first round should have focused on all those things, too. Are republicans still trying to add billions in military funding and funding for a new FBI building into it? Because that's not focusing on the people who need help. And now trump is golfing and you're doing what?
Only 11? Where's the  love?
He doesn’t care about the black vote. He talking  to his white base that blm are bad. That’s all trump cares about.

Don’t know if Joe lost the black vote but  he’s not gaining more black votes. He needs to stop talking so much. We don’t want a Democrat trump when it comes down to speech. He has to pull it together and stay focus because he going lose the white male vote so he needs us to win

I know. I’m just gonna vote for trump if don’t grow some balls
Joe Biden isnt going to the DNC. He atleast has to debate Trump twice which he wont.

Somebody make a Trump, Nickelback, graph meme
Heres my logic. I DESPISE biden and the thought of voting for him makes me sick but right now we need damage control. People are dying in droves. Once we get rid of anti christ trump we need to keep this amger and momentum and show biden were not stopping at trump
Trump can tell his supporters two completely contradictory statements at the same time and they will believe both of them. If you try to point out that they both can't be true they will scream fake news. That is the depth of their intelligence.
Unfortunately here in oklahoma we dont have 3rd party for pres elections. As much as he disgusts me hes better than trump because we can at least shame him either to the left or into silence where as trump is too stupid to understand shame
As much as it sickens me. Yes. I dont think we have enough radicalized to afford to split the vote yet and that could put trump back in office however biden is easier to shame to the left or at least shame into silence than trump ever could be.
If you believe republicans are protecting your freedoms, you are not paying attention.  I don't know you. I don't want to know you. I'm not sure why you chose me to try and have this "conversation" with. We are never going to agree if you believe that trump and the GOP is good.
Trump Administration Secretly Blocked US Weed Research for Years, Memo Shows impeach the bastard
Joe Biden is both articulate &amp; reads well. He does flub words and panics, probably from his early stutter.  Trump’s reading skills are abysmal. I doubt he even knows that word. When he speaks, he often doesn’t form complete sentences &amp; is difficult to follow.  It’s word vomit.
This is what the Trump circus has done to dumb down our elections! 🙈
I remember a couple times when Whitney Houston was interviewed by Oprah and Barbara Walters and I noticed her sweating. At that time I didnt realize that was a sign of drug use. So, Im just asking if Trump sweating could be a sign of anything,other than possibly illegal drug use.
Maybe it's just me. Life was much happier when the racists kept their racism a secret. I'm so tired of this shit. People say Obama divided the country. Yeah cause he was black and some couldn't handle it. But Trump's America gave full permission to show hate #gop
Thank you, but no thank you. I don't need others to tell me how to think or what to believe. I can read and follow along on my own using reputable resources. Please just go away. Anyone who believes that trump is doing anything good for this country is lost to me forever. Bye!
Imagine thinking gamers wouldn’t rise up and help Trump ban all that shit.
He's not doing it for security reasons. He is doing it because Tik Tok made a fool of him many times. He does things for Trump, not America's best interest.
Latino voters in my area are mostly pro Trump.  You speak lies... #Obamagate
So many Trump haters will be voting for a documented racist because of hate. Lol
The typical democratic rebuttal he didn’t say what he really said but trump said this but he didn’t really say it? Insanity - here have another glass of Kool aid, come on man!
The ONLY reason im voting for biden (that sentence still makes me wanna puke) is becasuse if we split the vote i dont think well win and biden is easier to shame into the left than trump is

Rules?? So Joe can just not debate Trump ever? Do you really think he will ever come out of the basement to debate? The debates won't happen because Joe will continue to cancel due to covid concerns. Just like the DNC convention
The three latest (hateful, greedy) lies by the  that have been proven false  1. Trickle-down economics works,  2. $600 is enough to desensitize somebody from finding a job and working.  3. tRump has the mental capacity to handle the #tRumpVirus
So what? Trump never accepted the endorsement. The premier of the CCP endorses Biden. But I'm sure you're proud of that.
Trump &amp; team has had months to put together a nationwide strategy on re opening the country, schools &amp; slowing the spread of the virus. They had years to make voting more secure both at the polls &amp; by mail. They've failed miserably. These losers don’t deserve 4 more hrs of power.
The absolute ridiculousness that people have reached to defend Donald Trump is mind-boggling.
Trump was literally sued by the NAACP.
Well A.. if he WAS the person of my dreams he wouldnt like Trump. And B.. his ass would get dropped never to be seen again.
And every non-masker I've come across is a trump supporter pretending to be a Christian while taking no measures to love their neighbor. Just like James. CINO-- Christian in Name Only
Yes.  The stakes are too high with this election.  Trump is dismantling our democracy and his base is letting him do it.  Getting him and all of his unqualified, incompetent entourage out of the White House and DC is an imperative.
That all being said, the GOP of today is a bloated abscess of Trumpism and not at all "conservative." Until they get rid of Trump and the Christian Nationalist faction of the party, I will not vote for any Republican.
Come on now Kanye we kno you n Trump friends we not falling for that shit bro 😂
Barr is willing to break every law and violate every policy to get Trump elected. Laws mean nothing to them. Look for phony investigations to be announced at just the right moments.  Barr's Hail Mary
I can assure you I don’t have any Trump voting friends. They’ve been removed from my life. However, they DO NOT CARE. There’s nothing you could say or show them that would sway them from supporting him. They believe he will make them rich as well.
It's funny how the #Christofascist wing of the  say electing  will turn America away from their god.  Trump and his merry band of degenerates have done a better job of making ex-christians than I could ever hope to do.  I'm still voting for Joe, though.
No, they're dying because they come in contact with people who are not wearing masks and washing their hands. Those non maskers are trump's base. He told them for weeks they didn't need to wear one. Your mask protects me. My mask protects you.

I agree. Right now i dont understand politics cause i avoided it so long. Im learning noe though all i know is people are dying and while biden is blue trump hes more responsive to backlash. I just want people to stop dying so we can organize and finish this ince and for all
My logic behind voting Biden (that sentence made me throw up a little) is that we NEED to get rid of trump. Biden is just blue trump but hes more responsive to backlash. If we can get biden in office al then hold onto this anger &amp; revolutionary momentum we can end this for good
That made no sense at all, and I just came from Parler, which seems to be Internet Crazy town.  How does literal golfing enable the President to steal taxpayer dollars? I'm not a Trump apologist, that just didn't add up. Presidents are allowed to leave the White House. 🤣🤣🤣

Trump is not pro-life, pro-fetus or pro-choice.  Trump is pro-Trump.
The news media &amp; Democrats raked Trump over the coals when he shut down travel from China in January. Pelosi even encouraged people to visit China town in SF, taking the opportunity to cast Trump as a racist for banning travel from China while simultaneously minimizing the virus.
Trump was referring to Chlorine Dioxide. I have used this in the livestock industry for 15-20 yrs. It’s phenomenal what it does to animal health. HINT:It’s what they use to clean the eggs they grow vaccines in. Organic, cost pennies, and it is being suppressed BIG TIME.
Once that was gone, there needed to be something else to take its place, because right wing austerity economics is not broadly popular. Here comes Trump with his demagoguery on race and immigration. 2/
Trump is pissed at Tik Too because kids named Buster Hymen ruined his Tulsa rally. Plain and simple
Not verbatim. But I remember trump saying. When he wins the nomination he would expose the GOP for the filth they really are. He did just that
Who’s trump gonna blame covid on when everyone else got it under control?? We are the #1 world epicenter rn.. fuck y’all I wanna go to Europe
If trump and Biden should suddenly keel over, we could end up with Kanye as president. That would be so 2020.
It takes a special sort of gall to attempt to make a political issue out of your opponents misstatements when your candidate is Donald Trump
Is it just me, but I think I’d rather deal with Trump’s ‘Storm Troopers’ than these antifa Portland idiots.
Why sympathy for Con-ye, but not trump? They both suffer from mental illness.
If you are going to write in a name you might as well stay home and if you are going to do either of those then you are voting for Trump without casting a vote. So why all the name calling of Trump when you're going to vote for him anyway. Just a hypocrite!
I’m sorry but there is no longer any republicans worth a damn. They all enabled trump
Surely, most people can see who Biden really is and that his prays are real and also should know not to believe anything trump says.
Trump lies about everything.
All jokes aside Trump is an actual tyrant, anyone who thinks this is okay bc they "dont play those/dont play any games" is missing the point entirely. Imagine if Donald Trump banned sales of The Beatles during the 60s because they were British.
Donald Trump banned Fortnite  Bottom Text

Corruption he learned from trump no doubt
Neil Young sued President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign Tuesday for copyright infringement, saying he doesn’t want his music used as a theme song for a “divisive un-American campaign of ignorance and hate."
What does Trump think he knows about the environment that that child or AOC don’t?  What a stupid fucking clown 😔🤡
I think Trump should ban fortnite.  It would benefit all of us.
Plan B if Biden doesn’t win is getting to whatever person told Trump the story about the water pressure in their house. I mean if we could just get intelligence briefings to them, maybe some bits of the constitution, maybe we’ll make it fine through 2024
Y’all. Something is rigged in this poll.   It’s showing Trump with 2/3rds of 43 votes, but when I drill down it shows 10 people have voted!   Ballot fraud!
The Trump campaign is asking the Commission on Presidential Debates to move up the last presidential debate to the first week in September to get ahead of an expected surge in early voting.

Trump is a small, ignorant man. Fortunately his opinion of John  Lewis is of no relevance.
Trump didn’t sign the EO’s. Blue govs went on the murdering spree, they make Ted Bundy look like an amateur. 63% of all deaths happened in those 5 blue states. 45 others governors DIDN’T, place Covid positive patients into nursing homes. None of these 5 taking any flak. Unreal
I bet Biden can say Yosemite correctly. Also, Thailand instead of Thighland!😂
I watched about the last 20 minutes of a nuts QAnon video that claimed all of Trump’s mispronounced and misspelled words were a secret code just for them. It was stunning. Those Trump supporters will never accept that Trump has a clear deficit of some kind.
Well, it should be. Republicans are completely off the rails. White supremacy, confederate sympathy,  Nazis. COME ON. Republicans have lost all relevancy &amp; dignity when they got behind an egomaniac imbecile like Trump. When they defend his actions, they endorse them.

lol...you better have a psychiatrist lined up on election night when Trump wins again.  Dude is going to need an intervention.

The DOJ under the Trump administration cra kex down on human trafficking and sexual exploitation, more than any administration before including Obama's.
It’s not fighting back, it’s readjusting your bargaining position from one of weakness to one of strength, so that you can reach an agreement that is fair.  This is the one area where Trump actually is skillful and knows what he’s doing.
Trump acted on policy desperately needed policy changes where former presidents just made empty promises: the 1st step in prison reform, lowering prescription drug prices, requiring experience and skills to be looked at more than college degrees for federal jobs.

Trump is using a “trade war” to gain an advantage in negotiations, which will lead to an agreement that is fair to us rather than us just bending over and taking it.

If you want to point out flaws in Trump, go right ahead. Just don't piously use the Ten Commandments as though you, or anyone else, don't break them. Find valid arguments against his policy choices and back them up with substantiated data.
That’s like Trump banning things that promote racism and bankruptcy.
Every day feels like I am in a movie. #KINGTRUMP Trump clearly doesn’t care about people. The pandemic, the suffering, people have not good, many are being evicted. No steps to make it better? How can this be happening?

Damn man, Yes!!! I’m not fucking with Trump 4 more years!
How much did this illegal tRump rally cost the US citizens?
Trump bulk helps him in this, assuming he could keep his hands up. He also has 3” on Joe.  I think Joe has some spit, tho. And I’d bet he boxed in his youth.  The fight would be very similar to the election. If Joe dances a bit and let’s Trump impale himself he’s a shoe in.
You know they have spray that will help you clean your glasses and Q-tips to clean your ears out.  Try it. You may actually see and hear that tRump is lying to you and will NEVER keep any of his campaign promises. All he's doing is banking as much of our money as he can. Lemming
Nice try at redirecting the conversation back to Trump. That tactic doesn't work with me. You sit in judgement of him for breaking the Ten Commandments while breaking them yourself. Do you think Biden hasn't? Who says it's okay to break 1, 2, or 3 but not all? You?

Perhaps, but never Trump is ignorant...trusting our country in Biden’s socialist hands is essentially never-Republican.
Even assuming your insinuation is correct, at least something happened to him to get him that way. Trump seems to have been that way his whole life.
I'll give it 10 minutes before a Trump quote emerges.  I'll give it 10 weeks before anyone sees Biden in a public place.

If you were Republican you wouldn't be voting for Joe and the Democratic party that goes against conservative values. You just wouldn't vote at all if you didn't like Trump.

Trump's policies are moving into death cult country.
Last I checked they were in trump’s pocket
Kraft is playing a Trump card game here. Mac &amp; cheese is NOT a breakfast food. I love mac &amp; cheese. It's not breakfast. Fight me.
Oklahomies, we need to come to terms with the fact that we elected Baby Trump. 🤦‍♀️
Trump is as safe as a baby at his mama's teat! The military has his back 100%!
Truth. They have been hurting us for way longer, and much more insidiously, than Trump.
Next to “If you have a problem figuring out if you are for me or Trump, you ain’t black” this is the most racist thing a presidential candidate has said in the 21sr Century
Millenials and Zoomers are generally too afraid of nuclear power and not nearly afraid enough of nuclear weapons, which are still, y'know, targeted and ready to blow up the world. You don't want the guy who comes after the guy who comes after Trump with his finger on the button!
Um, maybe because Trump just makes shit up.
Bull shift! Trump is a competitor. He would debate even if he was 50 points ahead in the polls.
The DHS, which was tasked to protect the nation from foreign terrorists has morphed into Donald Trump's Praetorian Guard.
Only you, Mercedes, looked and acted unhinged in this segment. Apparently, you are not capable of having a rational conversation. None of Trump’s people are though, so you fit right in with that crowd. #BatshitCrazy #CantFixStupid #Deflect
VOTE TRUMP!!!!!!! MAGA!!!!!!!!
SNL and Colbert won’t be the same without all the Trump comedy but I’m ready for them to all go back to other news with less chance of killing everyone on the planet
Our country will only be respected once Trump is gone
I think Trump has slipped some from when he was younger like most people once they get into their 70s. But Biden is much worse.  He's approaching full blown senile.
Well the military gives all their funding to Trump for his wall so why should we give them more money
You mean friends like Don Trump, Governor?
That very thing is what got us Trump. Hold your nose, if you have to. But vote blue!
My favorite thing about the guns comment is Trump has passed more anti gun legislation in 3 years than Obama did in 8. BuT ThE dEMs ArE cOmInG fOr YoUr GuNs.
It is written in "Two Thessalonians," tRump is ignorant
I’ll admit to this feeling like a silver medal. But taking down the NRA would chop a huge funding arm off of Trump’s campaign. So it’s win-win.
The press should not air trump quotes unfiltered. Stop helping him spread lies that literally kill Americans.
This guy literally can’t complete a single thought without fucking it up. Yet, MILLIONS believe he’s capable of being the leader of the free world. At least with trump we won’t have other countries thinking they can fleece us like a kid going through grampa’s sock drawer. Snd hlp
Me too!!!! This is for tRump! Lol
They both are. Personally think trump has the EQ of a 14-17 year old boy and not the brightest. But here we are having to vote for 1 of 2 dummies.
I would love AOC to debate Trump on economics - or anything.  She would wipe the floor with him.
Well I’m not voting for tRump so that counts as a vote for Biden considering Democrats’ logic.
It’s not a gaffe it’s the words of a Segregationist. COVID19 hasn’t kept me from working after I lost my server job. I just got new skills. I’m not scared of a second tRump term. Are you?
This is why nobody in the White House wanted Trump to talk about those US troops that got bushwhacked in Niger.
If we told Trump that God is omnipotent so Biden can't hurt him, do you suppose he leave the stage?
Hello fellow Republicans! Either you put up with our current President or your other choice is socialism. Your choice but I guarantee if Biden wins you’ll be begging for Trump back when we turn into Venezuela.
As crazy as impeached trump is, I don’t blame Dr Fauci.
nobody pays attention to what trump says anymore, news break he's a liar.
Not a single person voting for Biden can legitimately say they are voting for him because he is a good candidate...they are voting for him simply because it’s not Trump. 🤦‍♂️
Show me - here is a source the left loves and I hate disagreeing: "What's False Despite creating some confusion with his remarks, Trump did not call the coronavirus itself a hoax."

We know.  The thought of Trump for 4 more years has y’all on the verge of tears.  So salty 😂😂😂
TexanRed, what do you think about trump saying the future President of the United States of America hates God?  Any comments?
I love Donald trump, i hate chicken nuggets, dr. Pepper is the worst drink ever, t Swift is trash, and tequila is horrible
stitt another one of trump's  out to lunch bunch.
Probably just personnel. As obviously failed the "maximum pressure" strategy is, Trump and Pompeo will still stick with it as long as they are in power.
I’m now treating the Biden-Trump Debate as a Heavy Weight Championship.  It’s going to be electric. The only way itll be better would is if Jo is there. #LetHerSpeak
Donald Trump’s god is so small.
I just got around to watching the full Trump interview with Axios, and let me point out that cases in Oklahoma were rising BEFORE the rally, despite what the President said
At a debate, Biden should do nothing but challenge trump to Bible trivia. What does John 3:16 say?  What was Joseph’s (Jesus’s dad’s) occupation? Who came before Jesus to prepare the way? What are the beatitudes? Etc.
tRump's opposite
When is someone going to tell this idiot he cannot turn these visits into a tRump rally on taxpayers money?  Maybe we can send him a note from. "Thighland" what an idiot and he is  the national embarrassment
Trump has did more for blacks than any other person in the world. He made fried chicken cheaper. The price of watermelon is at a all time low. Hell he even made grape soda taste like grapes. That man is a stable genius
Ok buddy
Ok buddy
Wait until he says you won't GET the vaccine unless you vote for trump. That's coming.
U know trump is pretty lucky! Sure aint gonna' break my heart 💔 when his luck runs out. It will be a hard fall from his high perch.
You must be joking. If you can' vote out trump at this point you are a lost cause.
Daniel in the lion's den, huh? Why would we want a Trump supporter to moderate the debate? Trump needs to convey strength, and a moderator that's opposed to the POTUS would help do just that.
Yet another great idea from Trump.  Just stay from that liberal bastion called Austin.
Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine tests positive for coronavirus ahead of Trump visit today.
People will call you a liberal bc you won’t support trump. I don’t like people who are far left either, or just anyone who is irrational. You guys are arguing about a racist rapist and a child predator. You both look stupid af! We are grown adults, have conversations like one.
Trump is beyond delusional.
Devin Nunes also. Probably more important than even the President. He helped save Trump’s neck, I think.
Maybe except for Pete Buttigeig but yeah of the Dems at least Biden, Butti and Warren are deeply religious where Trump seems to believe in nothing except money/Mammon
Trump love going strong in our home today! ❤🇺🇸❤🇺🇸❤#KAG2020 #MAGA2020
Imagine forgetting the Trump Foundation had to pay $2 million in damages to settle claims and agreed to dissolve in 2018 due to “pattern of illegality.”
Sad that he doesn't get that we all need a moment to smile and forget about the immensity of the death and disaster Trump has wreaked upon our country.  I command thee to go forth and make the country laugh.
Donald Trump
I’d say 68% Trump hatred, 32% people being comfortable with him, his experience and his enduring likability
Vote your conscience and principles. Even if that's not Biden or Trump and one of those two wins (as is likely), the winner not having your vote (and those of similar mind) still lessens any perceived mandate and has the potential of altering the future political landscape.
Nor is President Trump's. His "hate filled" Tweets are aimed at the traitors that tried to ruin this country.
Love it when Trump campaigns for Biden
Imagine going after a Innocent man but refusing to touch your god I’m mean trump
Watched the Axios interview and saw so much of my MIL in the way Trump deflected, refused to answer basic follow-up questions, and just lied. Bless  and all others whose job it is to put up with this bullshit. At least I can choose to not talk to my MIL.
Trump can’t even recite a bible verse
And Trump is a taco salad
I’m still waiting on what trump has done for the black community. Please don’t repeat the following: prison reform( meaning he thinks we all are criminals). Or founding for #HBCU (Obama did the same) &amp; please don’t say unemployment(which the first two years is a cause from Obama)
Such a potentially easy year for Democrats. Yet Biden gives them these kinds gaffes like he is trying to give Trump a run for his money.
Ahh yes conflating someone with whom you disagree with them being a Trump supporter. I'm a staunch Marxist-Leninist so you couldn't be more off-base even if you tried lmao
Wholly owned by lobbyists, and wedged tightly up Trump’s ass, that is what we know.
I am sure the French President isn't perfect but, he demonstrates leadership that is missing from Trump.
I hope that your equally as happy that this will pretty much hand Trump the election. Thank you so much. #kag2020

I don't like Trump at all so your aim is off.
Right. And it is despicable that Trump is using him this way. Yes, younger ppl would respond to him. But the message has to be that if they seriously plan to vote, they must vote for REAL. No more reality stars!!
Trump is going to win again.
That's the best dramatic reading I've heard since Orson Wells read the phone book on The Ed Sullivan Show.

The 2020 election begins for some states in 44 days. Trump has shown he obviously isn’t concerned about your health, he wanted to buy time.

Trump lies
I just want him and trump to do a boxing match and winner becomes president but hopefully since they’re  so old they just drop 🤦🏽‍♂️
There’s an old saying “If we wanted any lip off Trump, we’d scape Barr’s off Trumps zipper!”
What is it with right wingers? First Trump screws them over and they lap it up like a bunch of dogs then the NRA steals their money and they rally to support the NRA. Are they really just masochists?
So the Trump administration could be responsible for disbanding the NRA. Didn’t see that one coming.
The only person’s mental ability I question is Trump’s.
Not just the trump base, anyone with half of a brain knows attacking the second amendment is not only stupid, but should be looked upon with disgust.
He might actually be worse then trump fr jus bc he suppose to represent “salvation” for minorities but is just so dense and says stuff like this ALL THE TIME. 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️ politicians are a joke
I knew Trump would throw Dr. Birx under the bus when she tried to play the diplomatic card with him.  It is slavish loyalty to him or nothing.  Her sterling reputation means nothing to Trump.

Whoever your running mate Joe, I am voting for you!   I cannot wait for you to get us out of the national nightmare that is Donald Trump, William Barr, Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump, and the rest of the mob.
I am convinced 100% that these 2 caricatures are frauds. Opportunists. I'd bet the farm when they are at home with family they are laughing all the way to the bank. Blacks for trump is an oxymoron. Bet trump calls them the N word when they aren't around
President Trump    The minute a patient tests positive for COVID-19, they should be given HydroxyCholoroQuine!  Make an ORDER that requires at least “Patient Option!” for use of this drug to cure COVID-19.  It is criminal to withhold a treatment against death!
Using  's example of refusing to debate  because everyone already knows who he is, Vice President Biden doesn't need to debate trump even once.  We all know who trump is.  We also know who VP Biden is.  Thanks Jim Inhofe for the tip.

The upside to trump is keeping a competitor from vmbuilding a hotel across the street from his. This isn’t rocket science.
I can see Trump laughing at Hidin Biden during the debates!
It's funny cause Trump's MAGAs here in Oklahoma just keep saying the opposite. They say the virus is here and we should just live with it. We shouldn't wear masks, we should go to school, we should just proceed as normal and it's no worse than the flu.
55 years ago this country was moving forward. That has stopped and we are receding back to the worst days in our history. Trump and the GOP are taking everything away. We will have nothing if he steals this election.  Johnson Signs Voting Rights Act
Josiah loves to act like Trump in how tweets about people he disagrees with. He proudly shows off his law degree through his incredibly descriptive vocabulary. Give him a follow since he really needs attention.
I would PPV an interview where Trump is asked basic questions  What is Marxism? What is the Nuclear Triad? Is Frederick Douglas alive or dead? 10=5x solve for x How does the debt ceiling work? Name one book in the Bible. Tie your shoes for us. Name your younger daughter.
Trump is sending someone to OK to manage this crisis because you can’t. The head of state touting the most abysmal failure during this crisis looks to you and says, man he’s really screwing this up... how embarrassing.

I agree. I just don’t think this specific election is the hill to die on. Trump is a bigger threat to us right now.
Barr and Trump will bring the full weight of the U.S. government to steal the election.  James Comey Wrote a Letter in 2016. What Will Bill Barr Do?

Trump wants to hire them.  The US is offering bounties of $10 million to anyone who can catch hackers meddling in the presidential election
This is why we will win on nov.3rd.  Trump has systematically installed people to destroy every branch of government.  Almost like he was programmed by putin . Was he? Everything trump has done has been helping Russia,  recalling 12,000 troops from Germany for instance. Russia..
Rock what vote? We need to keep President Trump. Football is going to suck this year.
In order for the virus to "go away" you would need a high enough vaccination rate. Ironically that won't happen with the ignorant, conspiracy bound Trumpers refusing to vaccinate.  Fauci says virus may never be eradicated, contradicting Trump
Please be the entire Trump family
Pence and Trump both are just too ignorant of history and the Constitution to hold the positions they do.  I am still shocked every time one of them makes a statement like this.
The people who run accounts like this are gonna cost Trump the election.

Trump is Stupid. Biden is in severe cognitive decline.
Well, Republicans screwed up by lowering top rate when they lowered taxes. Trump and Bannon fought against it.  The world is very mobile. The lower corp tax rate has finally seemed to stop them fleeing.
True in the general sense, however Stephanie also lost a lot of those moderate votes early on when she started aligning herself with Trump and running on the same fear mongering tactics.
Trump’s not an eloquent orator, but he can put full sentences together.
Constitutionally, I'm not sure. I'm sure our founders never imagined the possibility of millions voting by mail. But Trump already got Dems to go on record saying no election delays, so imagine them shrieking as they realize they have to reprint and remail 300+ million ballots🤣
Mr Biden, if you feel so strongly about this issue, why don't you debate President Trump and tell the American people, that recently purchased AR styled firearms for their protection, that you are coming after those firearms and dont care that you will leave them defenseless.

Donald Trump steals the election. the Libertarians will destroy our Democracy, every social program and government agency on the books. End result a Corporate Fascist State run by American Oligarchs.
As soon as I read Trump was using tariffs and starting trade wars reminded me of Herbert Hoover.

Trump reminds me over of the buzzard hovering over  Mt. Scott, Oklahoma looking for something dead to eat.   Trump cheering housing collapse: 'That's called business'
I'm just saying, if you really feel like the BLM organization is a terrorist group, and want to help get it labeled as such.
The exact law that forces coverage of pre-existing conditions. The same law Trump is suing to stop 😂😂😂
It's called the affordable care act. President Obama signed it several years ago. Trump is a bit late again.
Trump just trolled the hell out of the Fake Media in his Speech today. I loved it.  Was cheering!  The man pulls no punches!  Fighter!  Patriot!  American! Trump.
Republicans &amp; Trump playing games with the people. Like Trump stated 2007 "I get excited"housing market crash also more unemployed than jobs means lower wages, peoples credit rating goes down then pay higher interest in the future, Hoover Trickle Down a Republican religion.
When I see President Trump give his speech is he reminds me of this little dude.
You could say I hate Trump and vote biden and im still say youre pretty.  I do like your messages.  Great work!
Trump and Senate Republicans using the same old playbook Herbert Hoover used . Trickle Down, pull up your boot straps, or like Hoover stated. We give them direct aid they will use the money to buy booze.
Trump starts talking regulations at least we know where he gets his info to parrot

He didnt actually this. What he did say is.  I like carpet, I like lamp. My new best friend is a stapler and its lonely in my basement.  Im adam sandler and Vote Trump 2020 in running for mayor of Hawaii and I want a cheeseburger with turkey but not cheese.  Then fell asleep.
Its fine... They did a great job with JFK.  I DONT TRUST THEM.  WHAT I DO TRUST IS GOD AND BEEN PRAYING FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR MONTHS NOW.  KEEP PRAYING!
Trump tick these kids off. There will be massive turn outs of every kid in the nation trying to vote him out of office. Remember. The average age of a solder during the Revolutionary War was from 17 to 19 years old. My family fought the British at "Kings Mountain".
Trumps going to far on the gaming part too, every gamer or those who play games may despise him even me. Damn you trump you make everyone's life hell.
One thing about Republicans there're predictable. Trump Republicans on the same path Hoover Republicans took. By 1932 one person was starving to death every 7 hours in the United States. BBC, PBS, "The Great Depression-Road to Rock Bottom"
It boggles my mind how people have a hardon to hate Trump and blame him for everything. :T He's a shithead but I've seen people blame him over unrelated crap. I remember that whole Hawaii false missile alert and people blamed him for that. Come on now...
Trump will get a debate jus not sure who he’ll debate jus yet
Yes an I watched MSNBC last night the polls show Hispanics having problems voting for Biden. Insanity. Frankly the people should be released and throw the Trump Administration in these camps awaiting trials for crimes against humanity.
Herbert Hoovers defining moment that caused him to lose the 1932 election. Sending Gen. MacArthur &amp; Federal Troops with bayonets &amp; gas mask after the Republican Senate voted NO to help the starving Bonus Marchers protesting near the White House..  Trump &amp; Barr no different.
And Trump gos golfing
Refusing to extend unemployment, people thrown into the streets, food riots what Trump prayer for then an excuse to have Barr call out the troops, with bayonets and gas mask and declare martial law and cancel the 2020 election. At least that what I predicted last December.
Well, any more a Trump supporter or anyone with an (R) behind their names cant be trusted if your working class.
The old "God Guns &amp; Gays" routine to get elected in the Heartland. Only Trump replaced "Gays" with "Energy" to pander to the energy states like Oklahoma,Texas &amp; Iowa that grows corn for Ethanol. Hey, it got Cruz ,Grassley &amp; Inhofe elected.
Ma stated to get elected in the Heartland just mention "God, Guns &amp; Gays". Trump replaced "Gay"s with "Energy" pandering to the people Pretty good for a guy that paid porn stars 130 grand to keep their mouths shut to get elected!
Surely the Trump Republicans reason for refusing help to the unemployed to cause food riots, then declare a national emergency, putting troops on the ground with bayonets like Hoover &amp;  cancel the 2020 elections. Trump and McConnell cant be that that devious. YES!
My 85 year old Mother warned the family May 2016. Trump would be another dictator like Mussolini.
This country is on the verge of going into another Great Depression worse that 1930's  all he can worry about teen  #TikTok? Trump will pull another Hoover . One person starving to death every 7 hours in this country in 1930!
Throw the Trump cronies in prison. Tampering with the mail is a felony. The old excuse "I was just following orders " want work today just like it didn't work at the Nuremberg trials!
Trump must have been thing about KFC.
Trump Republicans will make Hoover look good. Hoover didn't believe in direct payments to the working class after the 1929 Stock Market Crash caused by over speculation. People starved in 1930! Go to You Tube "Great Depression 2-The road to the bottom".
My family cussed Herbert Hoover as a child. looks like my sons and grandson will be cussing Trump after I'm dead a gone. We haven't seen nothing yet. The Great Depression in 1930 will look like child's play after Trump and the McConnell Republicans are done.
How many Tik Tok users vote?
All of what you put is straight lies.  He wasnt a friend of Epstien not like The clintons or Obama. 1/5 of deaths in America are due to Dem(wit) actions by New York. Which later spread from there. Trump has off office time and leisure like Golf and yes tweets, and
and the Dem(wit) party including Obamagate have been lying this entire year.  The funniest to me is that Trump is a racist.  So...  History hopefully wont lie but tell the truth about the lies like the fake impeachment of no facts or actual witnesses.  Yes Biden is an idiot.
Ah Reagan...those were the days...we NEED Trump to stay in Office or this country will die a slow and agonizing death...I LOVE AMERICA! Just not all the people who are trying to wreck it.
Is it just me or does Biden’s side of the house constantly have to explain what he said? I don’t see Trump do it even 1/20 of what Biden and his handlers have to do-that my opinion and I’m sticking to it! Peace.
1/5 of Americas COVID Deaths were a gift from the failure of leadership in the State of NEW YORK.  WAS IT TRUMP WHO PUT COVID+ IN NURSING HOMES?  WAS IT TRUMP THAT SAID MINGLE ON A TRAIN?  IS IT TRUMP ALLOWING MURDER AND THEFT IN NEW YORK  NO SO THANK A DEMOCrat for those GIFTS.
Run from the truth. I know... We all know...  Trump 2020

As soon as the Fed thinks Trump will lose the election. The market will fall like a 747 made of lead.
The United States was the last industrialized nation to provide Social Security for it's elderly. Now Donald Trump, McConnell &amp; Romney wants the United States to be the first industrialized nation to take SSI from it's elderly Think about it
Binary:  1=Biden. 0=Not Biden = trump   Yes your vote for Bernie is a vote for trump! That’s how we ended up with trump in the first place!
Never Biden is essentially saying trump 4Eva. We have to restore the center before we can move to the left. All or nothing gets nothing when you are too far out to convince the center.
Trump willing to walk over the dead bodys of our children just to say he opened the schools and businesses up in time for the election
Trump putting these guys in streets remind me of Hitler putting the SA in the streets!
Most kind hearted yes ...  But  I dunno about prettiest I mean we did have Michelle Oba....haha  Okay I cant even joke about that.  Damn too funny.  Yes Trump has it all!
Trump should thank FDR. The New Deal put more water in peoples homes &amp; businesses building water treatment plants than any POTUS in history. I know my Grandfather help build a plant,the WPA in Medicine Park Oklahoma &amp; later went to work for the city as an employee of the plant.
So pretty.  Trump is not racist.
Said it a thousand times and say it again. Grandma predicted in May 2016 Trump would be another Mussolini if he ever got into the White House.
Trump must be getting scared. Biden's a Catholic
Forgetting how asinine trump is, if you need to smile, read through the responses.
Isn't Biden an actual practicing Catholic? What religion does Trump actually belong too. As an agnostic, religion should not be in politics.
Trump is wacko
For years I thought tampering with the mail was a felony.  If that the case all involved should do to the slammer thing. The excuse used during the Nuremberg Trials, "I was just following orders" doesn't apply as well in 2020 Trump World!
Professor Lichtman your predictions since 1984 of maybe 100% right. But my 85 year old Mother predicted in May 2016 when the family asked what she thought about Donald Trump as POTUS.  Quote, "Trumps another Mussolini"!
Trump. 🙀😹
Now we’re talking about trump campaign and associated accounts. 🙀😹
Hahaha.  And that is better?  Omg you lady are an idiot and we have all made up our minds about that.  Vote Republican Trump 2020. Better school to avoid people like this...
Trump is proof. Always listen to your elders. Mothers Day 2016 the family gathered to honor my Mother. Mother, Grandmother and Great Grand Mother.  She was asked what she thought as Trump as POTUS.  Mom laughed, "Trumps another Mussolini"!
He talks real purdy but, as with my vetting process, I looked at his tweets, replies, media and likes and you get a better picture of a unrepentant republican trump supporter. 🙀😹
Guess he can't say hi to Trump
I see this as one more satellite organization now tied to trump and the GOP being charged with misconduct. Each individual conviction leads to neatly tying up a greater pattern of misconduct for many people/republicans who will be accountable under the RICO statutes. 🙀🙀😹😹

Well my 85 year old Mother stated in May 2016 Trump  would be another dictator like Mussolini.  Have to laugh. Shes was more intelligent that people in the military operating billion dollar aircraft carriers! Voting for a draft dodger?
Tampering with the mail is a felony. Hope Biden wins &amp; throws this Trump Stooge running USPS in the slammer &amp; that goes for anyone at USPS that stops the flow of mail. The excuse "I was order to block the flow" doesn't work the same excuse used at Nuremberg Trials
Biden drives Vets and the only thing I see Trump ever driving is a golf cart. Think about it.

Lmao. What is Trump doing to Justice?  And you idiot. Im Comanche not white why do I care about white people and powers to have or share?  Also you are a racist because many hispanic and blacks love Trump.  Biden said you aint black if you vote for Trump.   Racist dividers.
I don’t know a lot about ammonium nitrate but couldn’t that be better used as fertilizer? This definitely sounds like something trump would do given the chance, rather than help out some family farms. 🙀😾

No they dont.  We are geared up ready to vote Trump 2020! MAGA
Does not matter if you don't enforce the rules for Trump and his family.
Trump is setting the Dems up again.  His strategy - claim Dems will rig the election to get a response. Then he rigs it himself and uses the Dems words against them.  I see this repeating itself again this Nov.
I'm wondering about Trump. Ran across a quote on the History Channel today. January 30,1933. "No power in the world will get me out of here alive". Adolf Hitler.
Perhaps a “trump” amendment to the hatch act putting some serious jail sentences for each offense and a three strikes and your out rule. 🙀😹
Yes it is... Trump is the best President ever and we all see n love him for it.
Wow... All is forgiven ... Naaa. You dont speak for this people families.  It isnt war or a war effort.  It is murder for no reason other than blame Trump.  Thats sick.
Who asked for a diaper change? Id believe Biden did.  Complain about ratings.  He said he was upset that falsie is rated higher but people hate Trump.  Which he was right about. They hate trump for no reason.  But he is up in Numbers breaking records MAGA Trump 2020 baybee!!
Yep, my mail has slowed down in Oklahoma. Part of the Trump plan.

Its clear Trump is a Russian mole or puppet. Like Nikita Khrushchev stated in 1956. "We will take American without firing a shot".

The different between Trump &amp; Obama like night &amp; day. Trump just shut off the lights. Now we know the meaning behind a 1956 Nikta Kruschchev quote. "We will take America without firing a shot"!  Greedy Republicans &amp; Corporations never change.They supported Hitler in the 1930s.
Some republicans are celebrating Kobach lost the primary to an establishment guy. Their are no establishment guys left. Marshall won’t hold trump accountable any more than  Kobach. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #GOPComplicitTraitors #GOPCorruptionOverCountry #VoteBlue
“In an interview, Marshall gave Trump an “A-plus” for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic.” Republicans don’t send their best people. They bring crime, they bring drugs, they are rapists and some, I suppose, are good people. This guy isn’t the latter.
I’m rewatching Dexter. During one of his flashbacks, his dad told him “Bullies are felonies waiting to happen.” How appropriate for trump.  🙀🙀🙀😹😹😹
donald trump is two months older than bill clinton 74 -djt, 73 - wjc
And well she should. Trump is spreading misinformation about absentee voting. He is going to end up hurting himself, because Democrats know what he is doing and will go to great lengths to make sure he is voted out come Nov. 3.  Post office or no post office.
Wow are you not nice, neither is true but Trump has spent a year golfing and charged taxpayers hundreds of millions to do it. Not to mention your constant lies at the podium. Glad you will soon be fired.
Yes, I wish I could get more likes on my entries into the trump presidential archive. 🙀😹

When the Dem(wits) are in control there wont be a safe place to run to.  And there will be a wall to prevent escape.  Vote Trump 2020.
Haha     THAT WAS CUTE.  COVID IS A WORLD WIDE PROBLEM NOT A TRUMP PROBLEM.  If we locked up ourselves for 2 yrs maybe the virus could be irradicated but what will we eat? What will be do?   I will vote  20/20 because he has done more for America than Dems!
The president said he wants to extend the $600 weekly benefit to unemployed Americans.
Let me add, Trump is also not the classiest person, but again McCain has a very shady history in some of the stuff he did.  I wouldn’t knock anyone that has passed but Trump is a thin skinned individual.  Having said all of that, he’s still better than Hillary and Biden.
I read alot as well.  In fact did alot of reading in college. Reading "Behavior Observation and Written Documentation". I read the DSMR3. Whole chapters devoted to Trump. He's  nutts!
Neither do I until Netanyahu is in prison. Then again, I WOULD NOT trust the US until trump is in prison. 🙀😹  I deleted the old tweet because the error was too glaring.🙀😹
IMO that doesn’t make him racist.  He is directing that directly to Lewis. Trump is one of the worst communicators I’ve ever seen, but he does get stuff done.
Trump thinks he's  some kind of Al Capone. Hoping Trump ends like Capone. Locked up for evading taxes.
2 billion for another FBI  building across the street from a Trump hotel. Give me a break!
Trump so out of the loop it would be like talking to a fense post. Right now he's  more afraid of going to prison after hes dragged out of the White House than working class slobs dropping like flys.
Lock them up. The callousness  if this person reminds me of Trump.
Well ... since Walsh ended his campaign for office, I take that to mean you won’t be voting for trump. HIS language AND actions are much worse.
On Trump not true coronavirus never disappear
"bit" this is not some king of fucking comedy. Quit trying to help Trump by minimizing this
Watching Trump spin his garbage on confirms my belief that Fog Horn Leghorn was right.
"It is what it is". Trump
Follow the money. The Governor  of Oklahoma the day after Trump 1st mentioned this drug. Using state money purchased $2,000,000.00 worth of this worthless drug. Boils down to kick backs.
And Trump says mail in ballots are rigged even voting practice been in use since the Civil War. One thing for sure. Trump knows his Nazi Propaganda tactics.  Sucker needs to be locked up for life. "It is what it is"? 1,000 dead a day
Ever day Trump goes golfing. A 1,000 people die and all he can say, "It is what it is"?  This guys a Monster!
Reagan was my favorite. But I will say that Trump has done a lot of good. Trump had my vote 4 years ago and he has it now. Peace.
I think we NEED the debates now more than ever to shine a light on the differences between Trump and Biden. Then Biden can sit down somewhere.
Trump right again?
I really like it when President Trump talks about the strong immune system of children.  They hear it and believe it.  That faith will help the next generation be our healthiest.
And real news is the enemy of Trump!
No. Thom Hartmann read a few chapters in a new book called "Dark Towers". Surprised Trump still walking the streets.
So absurd.  There is a virus world wide with a 99% survival and recovery rate.  But Dem(Wits) somehow believe Trump is responsible?  You should be ashamed for using a virus as a political lie to cause chaos.  Republicans want to open America.  Biden been failling for 50+ yrs.
I started this today because BLM is a terrorist org, that's hurting the black community, and will create more animosity than healing.
Are you sure it wasn’t a blank piece of paper? Considering the fact that trump doesn’t read, it was probably just to make him “look important.”
Just like trump steaks😂😂😂
Compared to what we have now as a VP. Leave the guy alone. Let them squirm. Just more time for the Trump crazys to make attack ads.
I'm doing my part to stand against this creepy cult.
Just saying
I say we need to classify BLM as a terroist org, and I even just started a petition to start the ball rolling.
More people brain washed by Trump. Like Nikta Khrushchev stated in 1956. "WE will take America with out firing a shot". Russians stooges in the White House and US Senate will make dang sure it happens. Pandemic or no Pandemic.
The idea the US Mail Service will  be slowed down due to mailing ballots is hog wash!  Mail volume is down due to the down turn in the economy. This is a deliberate act by Trump cronies and I mite ad. Tampering with the nail is a Felony!
Trump said he would sign his healthcare plan by yesterday. Did he? I have not seen this covered
Trump should take a guided tour and give at least 6 speechs after a few days camping with them.
Grandma was right in May 2016. "Trump? Trumps another Mussolini". Then went on to say pay off your bills &amp; stock up on food kids. Another Herbert Hoover going to take over the White House.

Anything trump signs "Pre Existing Conditions" will be reinstated in the US . The US only country to deny health care for higher profits. From 1945 to 2010 over 2 million lost thier lifes. Twice I was forced to make the decision for DNR over this greed. My wife Janet 1950-1986.

Agreed. He does. According to God I have a free will, and old Bill DOES NOT TRUMP GOD! Peace.

Maybe bring Trump on a little history. In 1929 the GDP dropped 15% we a had a Great Deppression.  The GDP  has dropped over 30%  the US heading down the road to a third world country of haves and have nots and the middle class completely wiped out.
Trump was right...  Due to the defund police movement  The estimated response time is.  Five days....  Hahaha love'n it!
Trump just admitted he will make sure the results be delayed. He needs to be informed tampering with the mailings a federal offense. Even for a wannabe POTUS.
Can you please help my account grow.  For months I deleted followers to maintain a perfect 0...  Dunno why,   Oh!  The Russians!  Thats it the russians and Twitter made me do it.  But Im voting Trump on my own, so I think.  LoL.

Send out some subpoenas to appear before Congress or the senate remind the Trump appointed post master tampering with the mail is a federal crime. Let a working stiff do the same the Postal inspectors he knocking your door down hauling you to jail.

To late. My Mother that voted for Reagan stated Trump was another Mussolini in May 2016. What happen?

She stands behind Trump shaking her head up and up and down agreeing with Trump like one of thoses dolls you get at a carnival.
Well thus isnt a fast food decision. What's at stake is 340 million lives plus fixing the mess Trump made  with our Allies since WWII. Take all the time he needs.

You know what I want from the next President of the United States? A dedicated task made to ensure that every person left in cages by Trump's horrid regime and those who have "mysteriously" gone missing to be found and reunited with their families. Is it so difficult to ask for?
2.The 1st post was from comments made by my 85 year old Mother after Trump was elected. Her fear another Hoover in the White House. After researching the Great Deorssion I asked about starvation she broke down. She stated as a child she had a bloated bellie from hunger in 1932 .
In 1932 there were two classes of people during the Hoover Administration.  The Haves and Have Nots. That's the America Trump striving for. Trump was never excepted by the upper class and punishes the lower class.
The numbers from the Stitt government canit he trusted. Last Sunday no deaths reported in Oklahoma. 2 nurses in OKC reported 2 patients died from COVID-19.  Stitts not only incompetent but dishonest &amp; pandering to Trump that cares less
As a retired Railroad conductor,  this scenario with Trump and the Mitch McConnell reminds me of the movie "UNSTOPPABLE". Trump the idiot on the ground that let the train run away and now Democrats &amp; Republicans trying to stop it before it wipes out a town.
I dont know but I'm sure this question was asked in October 2019 when the CDC notified Trump COVID-19 was coming to our shores. I followed the news about  COVID-19 from the 1st  outbreak was reported in China &amp; the whistle Blower died. Same old Nazi propaganda.
Velschi and Ruhle are MSNBC’s premier business analysts. They have consistently pointed out many trump economic lies with “For Facts Sake!” segment.  I enjoyed watching them before I cut my news program watching way back.🙀🙀😹😹
The only way it can happen is if some political potient black person dies, and Trump crashes the funeral so he can tell his side of the story during their mini Dem(Wit) convention.
Giving them another reason to split the vote and keep trump in power? Do you, and Bernie really hate democracy as much as this administration does? Smdh
Trump crazy! It’s the new level of crazy that used to have its upper limits set by Charlie Manson before the parole board.🙀🙀😹😹
you’ve been captured perfectly! Go fuck yourself is entered into the trump presidential archive today! 🙀🙀🙀😹😹😹
Trump wouldn’t stand a chance!
Same here. Everyone on the list is more than qualified compared to what in the White House. We are blessed to have these intelligent Women ready to step up to the plate and take on this travesty left behind by the Trump Government.
Grandma 85 years old then was right in 2016. After watching Trump and the other half make their grand entrance announcing he was running for POTUS. "OMG , Trumps another Mussolini"!
trump is really trying to ban tiktok💀 don’t this orange turd got more things to worry about than some fucking app lmao
In Donald Trump’s world, there is the RICH and OTHERS. No middle class, or lower class, JUST OTHERS!
Trump states he wasn't going to help the Blue States because they didnt vote for him. The way see it. If I drove by a car with out of state license turned over andvrefused to aid people needing help. I would go to prison!
Trump will be golfing like today
Trump golfing again 🤬
It’s a likely recurring problem. trump’s anchor babies have political ambitions &amp; If you don’t believe people aren’t gullible enough to fall for that stuff again, you’re sadly mistaken. The three eldest offspring &amp; Kushner need to be prosecuted for their fraud &amp; abuses. 🙀🙀😾😾
starting the show with an attempt to shore up Trump. You are so transparent.
Well there are laws on the books. Mail Tampering is a Federal Offense. Find out whos doing the tampering &amp; bring charges against. From top to bottom. Maybe a facing 10 years in prison will give the head of the USPS second thoughts. Trump may not be around to save is sorry butt!
Chris Wallace just want his show to get ratings. I didn't watch his show when my favorite President Donald Trump was on there.
It win win for these guys. Like the Wall Street Banker after he got home in Oct. 24, 1929 the day of the Stock Market Crash &amp; told his wife.. "I made more money today than Iv made in my life. 100 million dollars". Trump stated 1995. "I make money when people lose thier homes"!.
Trump picking the wrong people to make war with. They much more intelligent  than he think he us.
Trump is banning tiktok just because it’s really a platform full of people who see through his fake tan not because it’s ✨Chinese owned✨
Yes. My 85 year old Mother predicted Trump would be another dictator like Mussolini She also suggested we pay off ALL our debts. US would probably be in another Hoover Great Deppression &amp; took her advise. Oh yes this was in May 2016. Years before predicted OBAMA would be POTUS
Oh no! Drain the swamp! Stop with the nonsensical campaign rhetoric. Trump has more lobbyists and insiders in his cabinet than the last three presidents combined. He is the swamp! 🙀😹
Nobody is afraid of trump. He’s a laughingstock. People around the world are laughing at him and the United States for electing him. The only thing more pitiful than trump is the people who support him. 🙀😹
North Korea isn’t scared of trump. Trump wants to be bed buddies with Kim and he knows it. The only goal of the North Korean regime is it’s continued existence. As long as trip is president, that is an assurance for them.🙀😹
The Iran deal was working! There’s nothing now that can stop the Iranians from developing a nuclear stockpile. If you weren’t so science averse, you would know that. Are you one of those death cult rapture freaks? Is that why you want Iran to have a nuke? Trump screwed it up.🙀😾
You can bet the people in the Trump adminstration causing delays are the same people funded by NRA Russian oligrath money, the same Republicans that made numerous trips to Russia even on the 4th of July. The same holding up COVID-19 to working class .
Trump would jump out of AF1 at 35000 ft
USPS workers need to remember who pays thier wages &amp; who they represent, not  Republican Party or Trump &amp; most important. It's a Federal Crime tampering with the mail! You will be held accountable! We marched in the streets to protect USPS damn sure march to remove Trump cronies
Don't forget Trump not the only politician guilty in this picture. About 20 Republican Senators . The Senators that spent the 4th of July in Moscow 2 years ago an example.
Jordan's terrified. He knows Trump administration and  his days are numbered
What if...  All of Trump's hollywood &amp; political haters are fueled by guilt and fear of their actions on Pedo island.  And...  The allegience to China is because they were under surveillience by China who forced them to act or face outting.  Hmmm...
Haha... Thats funny. What will be even funnier is when we Vote President Trump in a 2nd time.  MAGA!
Until Trump's voted out.Acosta doesn’t like Trump telling the Truth.   Of course Acosta doesn’t recognize the truth while living in a fantasy World.
MO—Just deflecting like most Democrats. It’s easier to blame Trump when their own actions are the cause.
That's because  is going to be our next mayor.   let Tulsa down when we needed him the most. He put his party over citizens.  Also I am absolutely convinced that he voted for Trump though he will never admit it. I hope he is feeling a lot of shame right now.
Arnold made fun of Trump for 'yosemite'   Hey Arnold...  Say California
Oh, there was a reason given all right!He got caught with his pants down in a picture on Instagram with his wife’s assistant. That’s why he’s having to leave the University. No wonder Evangelicals like Trump, they’re just like him!!!
NOT his wife. No wonder evangelicals like Trump, they’re just like him!!
Thoughts and prayers my ASS!! He’s the top Evangelical Trump supporter, who got caught with his pants unzipped in an Instagram photo with his wife’s assistant!! No wonder they’re on Trumps side, they’re just like him!!
Jerry Falwell Jr, one of Trump’s most prominent Evangelical supporters.  Will take an indefinite leave of absence from Liberty University. **He’s the guy that had his pants unzipped in a Instagram photo with his wife’s assistant!  What a joke they are!
Not for Trump. I don’t lack intelligence.
Didnt you mean Thighland??? Oh, so wanted you to be our president!!!  Election was rigged alright, for trump.  The one time he spoke the truth.
Fucking hell 5mil/yr for posting on TikTok. Trump aside, this is really what is wrong with our society
Trump and his administration is at it again!! Disinformation Campaign!!!!
every asshole on tiktok that supports trump only posts alm videos then goes to say we need to build a wall💀💀 not very pro life of u hailey🙈
why do trump supporters base their ENTIRE lives off of him like bruh what did he ever do for u💀💀
As I told trump do the stimulus and move on to ice cube contract for African Americans. I know ya position thankless but omg Thanks
History professor who has accurately predicted every election since 1984 says Trump will lose
🤣I remember this guy also. Was all about Trump and lowering the cost of his HIV drugs. He’s not exactly 100% stable.
Hopefully they are on the list to go down for treason. It is coming! Trump said yesterday that some things are about to happen &amp; that he has very powerful enemies &amp; that this may be the last time you see him for a while. Something big is about to happen.
I was all the way democrat until Trump came to office and I seen how the democrats used the far left as a weapon to try and derail him creating national instability and making us look like fools to the rest of the world all for there gain at our loss
The lights on that dark road have been turned off by the democrats when they saw Trump walking down it and then blamed the outage on Trumps presence. Don’t like what he says? Okay understandable but the far left has turned this country against each other not Trump.
If he’s warning the Russians despite trump, why haven’t you   lyin’ hypocrite  #BountyGateAintGoingAway
Not too hard to find an unattractive pic of Trump
The seriousness of the pandemic, and the fact tRump has screwed it up in the beginning and the Republicans decide to stop negotiations to go home while people are in need is really pathetic. You all have a job to do, stay till it's done, or no pay!😡😤😷
You obviously know NOTHING about President Trump.
Judge rules E. Jean Carroll can continue to seek Trump's DNA in defamation suit
Hmmm...Professor Kelly says, “Trump was the dumbest goddamn student I ever had.”
John Lewis, Herman Cain, Fauci’s pitch, Ghislaine; “No election?” Trump asks, Karen’s our without a mask.  Til-Tok ban, Ellen’s mean, Hydroxychloroquine; Mail-in ballots might be fake, why is everything a cake?  WE DIDN’T START THE FIRE!  #SummerSongs2020
Because Trump, was embarrassed by TikTok users and his failed rally in Tulsa. He wants TicTok to be declared a “National Emergency” are you kidding me right now? We’ve got more important issues at hand!!!
But trump "did" say, "Biden doesn't deserve the black vote..." because of his gaffe.  I would express that the media didn't say that, trump did.... ijs
Biden will probably just keep his cool and not get into an argument with trump because will turn it against Biden if he doesn't say every word perfectly when even trump can't do it but that's okay with trump cuz he's president
They haven't agreed on anything yet.  Trump has threatened to sign an executive order on it if the decision isn't reached by tonight.  (Friday)
Notice I said “One dumb thing” and not incredibly racist thing every time he speaks once a month. I wish Trump wasn’t the better choice here but if you think Biden has what it takes you are either willing to risk our entire country to get trump out or you are blindto what you see
There is only one African American culture and country? I can think of a few different ones. And if Democrats are going to take everything Trump says at face value then people with a brain are inclined to take everything that Biden says at face value.
THE HILL Writer sounds like a Democrat operator or Romney’s RINO buddy.   But Republican’s inept support for Trump caused the Dossier inspired investigation to achieve a strategic long term success.  Windows of opportunity must be embraced and acted upon.  Republicans blew it!!
Trump is a dangerously incompetent liar living in his own fantasy world. He actually thinks he has done a good job and he makes up numbers to prove it.
The unethical Oregon Governor is trying to blame Trump for Oregon’s rioting.  He needs to poise before a mirror with the Portland Mayor and blame the image he sees.  They can blame each other!!
The best thing about Trump for me is how much he reminds me of Jehu.
#TrumpHoaxedAmerica  when Trump talks, he lies. I hope everyone sees this video and understands how dangerously incompetent Trump is.
I plead the blood of Jesus over Trump, his entire family, and all of the White House staff.  I pray for discernment, strength, clarity and peace.  I've never been so proud of a president.  Thank you for fighting the evilest of evil. #GodWins
#TrumpHoaxedAmerica Trump is an habitual liar. Most of what he says is a lie. Even if he told the truth, how would you know? That is very dangerous coming from any political, much less the POTUS. Top that with his incompetence makes him the most dangerous person in the world!
i dated this polish girl lol when i was in Europe for a year :( she was supposed to move here but i had to go to the border for trump the day she was flying out 😞
It's the tRump Virus, you haven't done anything about it, your a failure! The USA is the worst because of you! Your borders are a joke because the rest of the world doesn't want Americans in their country. You are pathetic!😷😤😡
I wish Trump would hurry up and do something about the Fake News!
Trump 2020 🇺🇸🇺🇸
Democrats don’t give a shit they hate our country they think everything is unfair because they are spoiled and entitled they have no idea what oppressed or real hate is, this Native American seed storm as hating Trump enough to sacrifice us all for nothing.
The Pope brings in more of a crowd than Donald Trump.  America ain't bothered by Catholics.(not anymore, at least.)
Almost every day I think about the time trump said "there's many per capitas" and questioned "per capita relative to what?"
They don’t care. They will prop anyone up there if that means Trump is gone. Anyone!
That is the holy grail! And think of the economic stimulus that would provide, and we could more easily encourage far higher wages if employers were freed from hugely rising healthcare costs. Far bigger boost than Trump tax cuts.
If your not for Trump your not Republican or for America
Well, trump can’t put 3 syllables together . Obama was born in the USA and it’s a blatant lie that he admitted otherwise.
Biden is a good man but that would be a stupid move at this point. Trump wouldn't do it for him or anyone else and Trump deserves not to get away with everything he's done
if you are able to vote and choose not to because bernie isn’t the nominee and trump wins ... we will not be friends
Lay out truth for the 2020 voters of what occurred.  DOJ-FBI-CIA-NSA-Obama &amp; Biden-Hillary-Rice—ALL instigators &amp; coverup artists wanting Trump to be illegally persecuted &amp; crucified. DISAPPOINTING BUT EXPECTED—THEY WERE UnAmerican FOR 8 YEARS. NO WONDER HILLARY LOST HER EMAILS
Hearings about Obamagate has started! Trump gave Kodak over 700 million start making pharmaceuticals in America we will now produce 25% in the world. he also today cut pharmaceuticals 50 to 60% in America.
It’s funny because Trump is def not a believer in any faith and Biden is a practicing catholic
I wish this OLD, UGLY TROLL would DIE! The sorry piece of SHIT is as bad or worse than ASSHOLE TRUMP! If he looked in a mirror I think he would put a gun to his ugly head!!
What's with the predictions about 2024?  We need to get President Trump re-elected and then start the conversation in 2023.
You are so right.  Vote Trump!!!
We are a divided nation because of Trump!
i live in oklahoma, i’m constantly surrounded by trump supporters and meat eaters. sos sum 1 help
I dare  to have a "debate" abt the Bible! Biden would wipe trump out on a debate abt it &amp; only thing trump would be able to do is mutter "ppl are saying","ppl have told me", "I hear there's some guy in it who does some pretty good things, but, eh, I can't relate"!
And the left still hasn't conceded that Trump won the election!!! BUAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
The kids that have started back to school are already showing cases of the tRump virus! He still thinks it's just going away!😷😡😤
Someone, anyone, please cute a source where President Trump has said he won't leave the WH if he loses his re-election. Seems your most trusted news sources are all onboard with saying the military will have to intervene and go physically remove him.  I'll wait . . .
Not surprised ...  Trump campaign ad against Joe Biden contains a number of doctored images, CNN and WaPo report
I hear he must be ticked at Dr. Birx, he is sending her on a tour of some states for the tRump Virus!
Get a new Dr., he's a tRump Zombie!
My hope is that that all the damning evidence against trump has been saved for these last few months, where dems know they’ve got to win the election, not just get trump out.
US election 2020 poll tracker: Who is ahead - Trump or Biden?
OMG!The crazy left want to actually allow every registered voter their RIGHT to vote!The"vote"DOES MATTER-that's why left wants to insure that EVERY voter has the chance to cast theirs!You need to fear the dictator-in-chief you fool! trump is trying to break system!
The Examiner = Donald Trump's Pravda.
I'm not sure you understand anything. Comey was rogue. There was no predicate whatsoever to investigate Flynn or anyone on Team Trump. None.
Many of those tests are obsolete. Because we You know, it's called science - and all the sudden everything's better. - Donald Trump ...  I can't ... I just can't. I can't already
I have great respect for liberals who understand that Trump is the better choice November 3rd.
Facebook removes a coronavirus misinformation post from President Trump for the first time ever - The Washington Post
Could happen but trump can't be pardoned for state crimes in NY &amp; his family can still be charged
You act as if Trump gave $35,000,000 of his own money, instead of from grants from the Justice Department. This is a worthy cause without a doubt, but if he can’t take responsibility for errors he has made, he shouldn’t take credit for doing what is expected.
lmao all the trump supporters went and bought a jonathon isaac jersey lmfaooooo bro that nigga suck anyway!!!! these mfs are so racist it’s funny at this point
Where's Big Poppa Trump??
Facebook removes a post from President Trump for the first time ever - The Washington Post
It's really sad too because no matter how bad it is already Trump is pushing even harder to get kids back in school.
Let's start with sucking out the hairy clog Donald Trump!
There are so many of them. You guys should do a Ron Popeil "But wait, there's more!"   Or a cheesy furniture liquidation sale commercial "Everything must go!"  There are so many turds we fire when we fire Trump. It's an embarrassment of...embarrassments.
Yes, President Trump is working tirelessly to drain the swamp!
Apparently, Trump doesn’t want to kill people in Nursing Homes!   That would be a starter!  Cuomo given everything he asked for &amp; then didn’t use half !  Yeah, Cuomo is a real winner 😏😏😏😏
Apparently, if you got out of Starbucks &amp; educated “yourself” instead of following Herd...you would know Trump most Productive Potus since WWII...”only Potus to actually do what he campaigned on!  🇺🇸🇺🇸
Nestor just doesn’t get it....Trump actually doing what He promises duringElection.....you vote for the “do nothing for 40 + years in office ,saying “this time” he’s gonna do what he says 😂😂😂😂 Your head is way up your butt!😂😂😂😂😂
They are heros and activists if you ask me💁🏻‍♀️🙄......you all shot at them for taking racist trump merch !!!!  I’ll say it for those in the back ..... YOU ALL SHOT AT THEM FOR TAKING RACIST TRUMP MERCH !!!!   #PoliceReformNow !!! Systemic racism at its finest people open your eyes
They already gave Trump 140 billion extra dollars for that. They bitched about it then all voted for it. Your lying ass Demonrats are sometimes smart but they all lie. Thanks for playing but take the red pill next time. I hope to see you outside the matrix someday.
#LincolnVoter  Although I am a Republican I typically do not vote party lines. Until this year. The reason I will vote 100% Democrat this year is Trump. I recognized early that he was a dangerous, incompetent man, unfit for the POTUS position.
That's because it's a bot account.. Lol
Ordinarily can’t stand the sound of his voice, but I could watch Trump interview Trump all day long...
On New Voter Registration in Key States, Trump Is Blowing Biden Out of the Water
Fighting for life at every turn?? Do you have any idea how RIDICULOUS you sound in the middle of an out-of-control pandemic which Trump has made FAR worse than it should’ve been?? I can not believe you’re asking for another six years 🤦‍♂️
I work for doctors I see medical records on the DAILY!!! But you’re the expect right you know it all right?? Ma’am sit down your ignorance is showing .... I mean it already was bc you like trump but now you just sound dumb.
You’re speaking to a brick wall ma’am all I here is blah blah blah blah I’m a white privileged trump supporting pos blah blah blah move around troll you’re barking up the wrong tree
Trump’s last interview is like an SNL skit lol
Libs can only try to take Trump down because they have no positive agenda to help Americans.
He Predicted Trump’s Win in 2016. Now He’s Ready to Call 2020.   “The best way to predict the furture is to choose it!” - Abraham Lincoln   I choose  and will work to get everyone I know to choose him. Join me! The future is ours for the picking.
Missouri did it, too! Despite Trump’s efforts to rip access to healthcare away from Americans, we are taking our lives into our own hands and seizing the opportunity - personal responsibility- something you’d think  might get behind. We did it again!! #MedicaidExpansion
It stands for “trump derangement syndrome.”  People like Tim don’t have brains big enough to fathom someone with differing political views, so they resort to name calling. If your beliefs don’t perfectly align or you criticize anything trump says, you’re “deranged”
The sheer number of conspiracy believers is frightening &amp; Trump panders to them.
That is just insane. But I worry if it's the start of something worse than whats already happened in recent years. Iran Hezbollah ErikPrince-trump-Saudi mischief   It brings me to weep, what these numbskulls are up to.
In the Tulsa Ok area 1 Biden flag and 2 bumper stickers.  60-70 Trump flags and bumper stickers.
Wow   trump is a joke, the world knows it, and you’re the idiots supporting him.
Latest from news unstable dangerous chemical storage buildings. Been warned for years to clean them out. There was a mushroom cloud.   Trump w/o information called it an attack of course. 🙄🙄
Just how stupid is trump???
WARNING: Dickweed alert.   Watch the full "Axios on HBO" interview with President Trump
This whole debate is a fascinating  commentary on political dichotomy. Trump didn't come up with the HCQ cocktail, which helped other SARS-COVs. CDC isn't going to green light this COVID19 virus treatment until a full testing regiment confirms it is safe. Closed minds can't talk.
TRUMP 2020
TRUMP will keep ud free.
'It is what it is,' Trump says of rising coronavirus death toll as he insists outbreak is 'under control'  via
What are the odds that trump’s new found disdain for TikTock is 100% due to Sarah Cooper’s work? I am guessing they’re pretty good odds.
Everyone should be interviewing Trump like this... from now on!!!  THE BEST INTERVIEW OF TRUMP!!
The reason why he didn’t go to John Lewis funeral or have anything nice to say, is because he didn’t go to his “Inauguration” and that’s the truth of it....PERIOD! This interview makes Trump look stupid. Which is not hard to do!
Under Trump they had the greatest employment in history. What will you do? Nothing
Good Comment Ben—Many people making negative comments about Trump are clueless about skills &amp; intelligence used creating success outside the bubble of academic controlled settings. US is a great example of mega-successes by people who bypassed academic ladders &amp; myths.
Trump on COVID-19 deaths: “IT HAS IS WHAT IT IS.” #AxiosOnHBO #TrumpIsLosing
Trump is petty.  We know this. No one wanted him there anyway!!!  He knew he could not rise to the occasion.
When Birx did not refute trump's craziness re: disinfectants, I felt she was not living up to the standard of "Do no harm" since trump indicated she was backing this.
Vote for Donald J Trump. All 50 for Trump nov 3.
Bring Back Are you Smarter than a 5th grader well but trump up against a 4th grader and he would still lose
Except for try to find ways to line your pockets SOME ONE PLEASE PUT TRUMP ON SHOW ARE YOU SMARTER THAN 5TH GRADER IN TRUMPS CASE ARE YPUNSMARTER THAN A 4TH GRADER TRUMP WOULD STILL LOSE
FACT CHECK FOR SATAN TRUMP Add All Asian Countries Combined over 70 Million Test Done in Asia More Test than the US. Asia 367,000 confirmed Cases and like 37,000 Deaths and 207,000 Recoveries  Twice population of USA So Realy Satan Trump you haven't done Shit
Analysis | Trump actually doesn’t appear to understand how bad the pandemic is
Live updates: Trump says coronavirus ‘under control as much as you can control it.’ His experts disagree.
Also called Trump an illegitimate president several times!
At ~6:00, President Trump briefly talks about his visit to Oklahoma, saying the state was “almost free” from the virus when he visited for his campaign rally.  This interview aired last night on HBO’s  #COVID19
Trump’s Post Office??!!  That’s a bit of a stretch, don’t you think?  If you can stand in line at your local grocery store, Wal Mart, Target, Lowe’s, Home Depot, etc. etc. etc. then you can stand in line to vote.  I wonder why only Democrats are pushing vote by mail?
Susan Rice will volunteer to debate Trump and expand on Obama-Biden lies.
ABSURD—FBI auditing itself is the same absurdity as General Electric auditing itself versus an independent outside audit firm. The 2015-2016 Trump-Russian fiasco occurred due to the FBI doing its own thing in concert with Obama’s Executive management team &amp; a Comatose Congress??
Trump is be stuck on a stat related to effectiveness of treatment, whereas the question is regarding prevention.  Instead of both sides teasing and parsing these positions out, why doesn't everyone just wear a mask, wash hands, and hope an effective vaccine is around the corner?
Trump has a plan. It’s act like he is the victim while also taking any credit that is available.
DONALD J. TRUMP IS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!
$MSFT still don't understand buying TikTok and dealing with Chinese govt and Trump.
Yep, he's in on the cult. Him and tRump are going to cheat on the elections!😷😡😤
What baffles me is the misinformation between government officials, medical professionals and the media. Why can’t they jointly come to a truthful conclusion and present it as a yes or no?  I’ll answer. Trump promoted. it.
trump voters!
🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️I am extremely proud to say that I am a #WomanAgainstTrump! I have been for YEARS! I KNEW he would be the worst pres. in our country's history &amp; I warned friends &amp; family NOT to vote for him! I have not stopped being against trump! #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
Does this mean one in three people walking around is an ignorant self serving Trump supporter? 😳🥴😩😫😖😣..... I don’t like those odds.
Schools must open, says Trump, or no federal money. 150,000 to 500,000 deaths, after children die, people will understand Trump's motives.
bro white people with their chest support donald trump
Stop talking dude.   Unfortunately Trump lives in a different world than most people. He determines how good someone is based on how they treat him (which we all kind of do). But you can't have that view as the president. You just can't
#WomenAgainstTrump I find Donald Trump objectionable for his unconscionable disregard of human rights &amp; the environment.
Seems like  ought to tell rural and small-town voters that Trump wants to close their post offices and reduce or eliminate their mail service. Bet they won’t like that one bit.
I’m hearing tons of people say Joe Biden is too Chicken 🐓 to attend a Debate with Trump! Supposedly the Dems are going to protect their little Joe🤣
Yes, that’s true and has been in the plan way before the Bushes. A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for Communism, New World Order and more. If you want Liberty and Freedom Vote for Trump!
🤣🤣🤣But Trump would never use the word “ integral.”
Deutsche bank opens review into personal banker to Trump and Kushner. Trump, will start to fight even harder and dirtier to win this year‘s election to prevent from going to PRISON. Which means we must fight even harder to make sure Joe Biden wins!!!
What is Trump hiding?
As usual Trump is shooting himself in the foot.
If tRump politicizes the vaccine and takes the pro side, would you give him any accolades for it?
Not really. These are actually incredibly horribly done deepfakes. Like how bad they are is intended to be part of the humor. Some deepfakes are incredibly convincing if you get enough source footage of the person’s face from enough angles, and we’ve got plenty of trump’s.
Does anyone in the Trump administration have any sense of how bad he looks and sounds in these things? It’s almost like they’re letting him dig his own grave. And he’s to addled to know he’s digging it.
I don’t think we can ever recover from more of tRump
Make no mistake after 11/3 we will still have a battle to be fought. tRump will fight with every tool at his disposal. Between then and January will be terrible for our country!
trump is getting worse at his rambling and outright lies or is it my hatred growing?
Trump looks like he’s having a bowel movement
I'll call it the Trump Plague!
#Trump2020   Defunding police, rioting &amp; lawlessness, raising taxes, and closing down America isn't resignating well with voters that have a brain.
This is disgusting!! #TrumpThreatensAmerica with everything that is swirling around Trump how the hell can you vote for this disgusting, psychopath lunatic!??
If there are any woman out there that does support Trump, your husbands must be proud! No “independent woman” in their right mind, would support Trump. And we make up more of the voting majority then men. And we are here to vote against Trump! #WomenAgainstTrump
America. You do know Dim/media Marxists do not want Biden debate with Trump. You do know Biden’s brain is mush!  He will be put in memory care facility in time. Doubt his family would be interested in caring for him
I will not vote for Inhofe or Trump.  Please tell me that you will be honest and keep your spine if you win.
Trump is going to prison if he loses the Election this year. That’s now 100% clear. Trump and his whole FAMILY!!! Yes! This is great news indeed!!!
No. No one really loves Trump in the romantic sense, is my bet. Kids might have paternal love, but they seem pretty narcissistic as well, loving their Dad because of what he can give them financially.
An Evangelical friend told me early on that Obama smoked and Trump didn’t smoke or drink.  That was his reasoning that Trump is a better president.  🙄
And...Goddamn! That general in the back ground of the Trump photo is fatter than he is!? What in the fuck is wrong with our military these days?
I wouldn’t either. You guys have refused to secure our elections and now have a Postmaster General in Trump’s pocket to skew mail ins. Sounds like you have the reporting numbers exactly where Yrump wants them. Yes, he can win by cheating. Repeatedly proven!!
The Biden camp is waiting to see which potential VP will be indicted. DOJ waiting to see who Biden chooses before indictments. It’s nice to have TRUMP cards to play.
So when you misspeak the WORD million for thousand it it quite different than you whole statement being BS...like Trump regularly does. Wow FOX, this is reaching even for your brand of news!
Wow! The Clintons are on Epstein‘s list! Say what you will about Trump, but at least he waited until his kids were over 18 to start dating them.
This is all their fault anyway! They had a chance to IMPEACH and remove, they were cowards. It left us with a failure who failed to do his job, the tRump virus is killing us all and all you care about is your self!😡😷😤
as long as you keep calling Trump a far right fascists, he’ll win again.
I disapprove of Pres. Trump. enough said. ✌️☮️ #DumpTrumpDayNov3 #DumpTrump2020
Does anyone else get the feeling Trump is positioning Biden to make his VP pick that Trump will expose?
BREAKING: Microsoft 'prepared to explore purchase of TikTok' in the US Microsoft is an exceptional company. If the deal goes through, it’ll be a great acquisition...
Since there is only one company who makes it &amp; they are trump donors?
This is even unbelievable even to trump
I am not a Donald Trump supporter...  And I argue that he is, in fact, a conservative.  I would like evidence that the 70-something year old hotel manager/owner -- from NEW YORK --  with the supermodel wife -- hates homosexuals.  Then I consider the decorating in the hotels.
If you want proof, look at how many troops Donald Trump has sent off to this new war.  It's an uncomfortable realization, to say the least, regardless of how fiscally responsible it is.
In other news, presidential elections in 3 months. Out of curiosity, do you know who the Democratic, candidate is, equal time being what it is.  We can't blame Donald Trump, he's not smart enough.   Blame the party controlling the figure-head.
Trump Makes Offer to Pay for Funeral of Slain Solider Vanessa Guillen  via
Why? Most of us will support  no matter what, and 30% of the country will vote for Trump regardless.  is winning now. No need to act until the convention if he doesn’t want to. Please explain your comment, especially “in more ways than one.”
Because the deep state Pedophiles weren't expecting Trump to win.
if trump never sent me to the border i would’ve been married to a polish woman right now today lmao i think about that every day. that bitch was on her way to the united states and i got deployed randomly as fuck. i ain’t been the same since
What is Trump hiding? He won’t let any reporters into the Republican convention this year? Again what is Trump hiding? Are they going to have a bunch of white supremacists at the convention this year? What else is going on? #TrumpIsLosing
When President Trump won before my Democratic acquaintances where wailing “What will I tell my childrennnnn”. Good times 😀. I’m looking forward to it again. 💯
Shut up! Pelosi is right! If we cannot have a Doctor who is truthful every time, then she should not be speaking! That is why Dr. Fauci, is America’s Doctor, because he tells the truth It isn’t about pleasing Trump, but about protecting Americans!!!!
Dr. Birx answer on 300,000 dead at the end of the year, anything is possible. She didn’t want to answer the question directly. Also, she turns it on the American people! It’s because of “US” that cases are rising, not because of Trump, but because of us! She’s gone full Trumpian!
She is right.....Dr. Birx is about satisfying Trump and his base! Dr. Fauci on the other hand, is America’s Dr. He tells the truth and he is about being straight with ALL people!!
Trump already said he would ask foreign powers for info to help him.
Shame on you, criticizing trump for getting exercise riding in a golf cart!
I'm with you.  There's not much trump wouldn't do to promote 'law &amp; order'...that's where his biker buds and thugs come in handy!
Great Barr Response—But Perspective matters—Arsonists &amp; Looters Supporting Democrat’s Strategies to unseat Trump is permitted and encouraged by current Democrat Leaders.  Democrat Leaders = Unacceptable Political Terrorists—WHY???
I hate trump. I despise all their shady tactics. I see the bullshit they put in front of their support base everyday. I live in oklahoma surrounded by blind supporters. The propaganda here is insane. That being said Even this is too sloppy for them.
The numbers look a little too rosy for Trump, but which part doesn’t make mathematical sense?
Don't trust him or believe him, it's all a cover for the elections, he wants to buy your vote, meanwhile, he's holding up the US Mail, he's  behind it! The person ahead of the US Mail is tRump donor! 😷😡😤
tRump has done a lousy job! A complete failure!😷😡😤
And “7 cream and 5 sugar” is your problem......... I would be so proud to say you are my pastor.....NEVER! Of course, I’m sure as a pastor you know way more about infectious disease than any MD, immunologist, or scientist! Has he applied to Trump to replace Fauci yet?
So Fauci gets credit when things are going well..could be because his recommendations are followed, and, like magic, it works. When Trump goes on his own, it goes south and Fauci isn’t responsible. Hmmmm, sounds fair. What credibility does she have...I’m his daughter??? Weak!
Trump should fire him immediately
Because tRump is a failure and mishandled it from the beginning! He's a failure! Should not have all these deaths, all on him!😷😡😤
how can there POSSIBLY be an argument about whether tik tok should be banned or whether trump is wrong about banning it??  CHINA IS USING IT TO SPY ON US!!  national and personal security should be more important and this is coming from someone who LOVES tik tok and it’s content.
Sorry but not voting for Biden is a huge mistake,more trump is death for people who are out of the womb
Trump Bans TikTok After His First Video Gets 0 Views  via
I know it’s hard to hear with Inhofe’s nose so far up Trump’s rear, but still. Yikes.
Trump finally got something right.
Don’t need to point. It’s easily evident. I’ve seen it before and it’s real. He is not well. Your claims about Trump are pure propaganda.
He won’t debate Trump.
Earlier my dad and brother kept calling me and talking nonsense 🤦🏻‍♀ saying "jump on the Trump train" like omg. I miss home and can't wait to go back 🥺🥺
Democrats are looking for a lever to use against Trump.  Don’t give them one.
Bc trump's rich and you're not.
If trump resigns, Pence will pardon the whole lot of them.
The left hate Trump so much, they are trying to install a man with dementia into the Oval Office. I predict he won’t debate Trump and that the DNC will pull a power play and sneak someone else in.
Irreverent Reverend? Wait and see. Trump’s not the racist you say he is. He just appreciates presidents who follow the law.
Maybe if Trump would do more goofy dances on his Twitter Feed, America wouldn’t all be over on TikTok.
Fred Trump.
You guys do know that there are white supremacists that support TRUMP secretly in the crowd of the protesters to stir up shit.....right!!?? But yet, you want to blame all the Democrats for it? Those that blame Democrats for everything are truly pathetic!
That’s the most ignorant answer to a question! Why you automatically go to Democrats wanting to burn Bibles?And those two burning Bibles are probably white supremacists that voted for Trump and you know it!!!
NO TRUMP....you’re wrong!!!! You are trying to hide the truth of how bad the coronavirus really is under your watch!!!! People believe Dr. Fauci, way more than you!! Quit pushing out LIES!!
2 Guys, 1 Trump.
A million dollar donor to Trump is put in charge as Post Master General is the end of the post office!!
Well, it is entertaining to see what someone considers a positive Trump action. I think every last one of these supposed “Trump accomplishments” is a negative for our country, but it’s nice to see policies I oppose in addition to the abhorrent person I oppose.Neat package of doom
Trump has a record of incompetence, greed, hatred, racism, ignorance, and failure. Our economy is destroyed and 153,000+ Americans are dead because Jared thought only blue states would experience #COVID19 and Trump thought it would just disappear while he criticizes physicians.
When I hear someone say “I love Donald Trump!” I automatically put them into a group that includes things like, people who say they love CiCi’s pizza, red wasps, and root canals.
Democrats don't have to do anything to make trump look bad.  He dies it himself by speaking and tweeting.
What countries?  What proof? Only nursing home with Democrat gov affected?  Where was assistance from feds then?  Sending in PPE.  OFFERING A PLAN.  No, trump said only 15, it will go away. Get real.  It was bad for all and is out of control. The buck stops with trump.
In 8 years he improved lives for millions and milions and brought about some degree of social justice. Then Trump came along and exposed all of those who hated Obama for taking away their ability to legally be racist and greedy.
Thats insulting the D-List folks Trump team is F Troop, wondering where are the Fakowee planning ppl
It wasn't a campaign speech and he never mentioned Trump. Funny that he never mentioned Trump but everyone on both sides knew exactly what he was talking about. And it was about the chaos in current leadership - and he's thrown his support to Biden, he's allowed to support Biden.
Yes, while we plan to terminate trump's presidency
Do you think trump cares how it affects people?  He hasn't so far.  Mail doesn't matter.
I hope trump does ban tik tok they have an app for a reason no need to post tik videos all over snap 🤷‍♂️
USA’s 8-year march to Socialism &amp; Communism under Obama suffered a U-Turn with Trump’s election.  Obama’s Political Economic Revolution created Ultra-Wealthy Politically Elite &amp; Plantation Based Poor.  eg—The Clinton’s, Obama’s, Feinstein’s &amp; Pelosi’s + Open B &amp; CA-NY homeless
No kidding.  Most would have the sense to 1. Educate one's self 2.  Let experts lead 3. Work with experts for a PLAN. No wonder trump has filed bankruptcy so many times.  His blunders now are costing lives.
Inability to ID key players &amp; scuttle the Trump-Russia project quickly is the same inability that has enabled so many terrorist acts.  Likely other wild goose chases also disabled the agencies. Big question remaining:  intent of key people who created &amp; perpetuated the scam.
How is it possible that Biden is leading Trump in the polls in Michigan, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, etc... with his energy policies? His policies would kill millions of jobs and bankrupt the states. #DontBelieveThePolls
Complete disregard for the lives of American Citizens. They literally do not care about us. This is Trump’s “America”. VOTE VOTE VOTE!!!
I’m in twiiter jail..... I’m assuming bc I called trump a pedophile.....
Microsoft Said to Be in Talks to Buy TikTok, as Trump Weighs Curtailing App
I’m getting tired of that narrative tho that “kids using Tik Tok” fake registered for tickets to the Trump rally. First of all, a lot of us did that, myself included. I didn’t even hear about that until after the rally was over. And wouldn’t have mattered anyway, b/c....
DONT  FORGET THAT TIKTOKERS ARE WHAT MADE HIS TULSA RALLY FLOP!!! President Trump says he plans to ban TikTok from the US
Wait is Trump fr banning Tik tok?
Trump could win an Emmy in a heartbeat!!! Resign on primetime. I guarantee you that Emmy, Donnie! #ObamaHasAnEmmy
Moron. Tickets were free. Lots of us ordered multiple tickets w/no intention of attending. Actors were paid to show up.  Trump made zero money &amp; killed #HermanCain.  #Tulsa #TulsaRally #TulsaDeathRally
Trump is banning TIKTOK and I wasn’t even famous on there lol 😂
When u get hired to make TikToks then
Yeah, well, I won’t see any of that BS here because I block it or unfollow it immediately if I get even a whiff of Trump tolerance.
The sheriff here in Tulsa spoke before the Trump rally last month. I felt the same way.
Even a dummy would think an ethical Mueller would have investigated such but smart people know Mueller avoided trying to find the truth &amp; only tried to frame Trump’s supporters so they would squeal falsely on Trump.  Swamp Ethics on Steroids!!!
Wait.....WHAT!?? Oh my Goodness, I think this is the point in Trump’s life where he has totally lost it. What in the hell is he talking about!??
Interesting. Maybe some of the folks who can't shake Trump would vote against some of the dopes his installed.
Trump
Sure I suppose but what happened to dignity? Tact?  I know some people have a hard time seeing the line between funny and offensive.  Now saying that. Did the reporter make fun of trump?
WAKE THE H---- UP PEOPLE! HE HAS BEEN LYING TO YOU ALL ALONG! It's nothing but a hoax to destroy our Economy to try and get Trump out of Office! And the will stop at NOTHING, I MEAN NOTHING to get him OUT...You want you Freedom Back then Vote RED!
McConnell is signaling to GOP Senate candidates to distance themselves from Trump if it will help them win
And who got us into the mess? A Republican't. And he was allowed to speak at John's funeral. John Lewis, that is.  Hmm...Fox fact checking Trump? Maybe Murdoch has had enough? Maybe we find they really are Patriots, not to our degree but in some regard?
I can’t wait to see the new campaign piece  created from the public conversation  had with Trump when deciding to maintain the racist names for US military installations - named for traitors against our country!! Why do they love traitors more than soldiers?Pray for the safety of Trump. He made a comment yesterday that was a little strange. Said a lot of people want to hurt him. Another of rich powerful people. And thats why he rushed signing some bills. Because no body els ever will. Kinda strange
I want Trump.. but the same.
Fuck it. I'd even vote for Richard Nixon himself (were he still alive and eligible to run, of course) if he were the only way to kick Trump out of office; and I spent half my life wishing I could have personally burned Nixon at the stake. That's how dangerous I feel Trump is.
I think you underestimate people who support Trump and their worldview. I have no problem with ‘change’ in a generic sense. I will resist change that limits freedom and takes more money away from people to enrich government.  In my experience, socialism’s cons outweigh its pros.
Uhh...did Donald Trump refuse to rent to Black people?
How about the doctor that lies about Trump’s health! What was his name?
Nancy Shively: Opinion contributor, Teacher: I was a reluctant Trump voter. Coronavirus is the end of my Republican identity.  via  July 23, 2020
That’s President Trump to you soy boy, maybe even Mr.Trump.
Furthermore, Id rather be governed by 535 trump supporting rednecks living in rural America rather than people who live on either the east or west coast. Or by the current powers that be in the democrat party
I mean, do we want to manifest it by questioning it? I thought nothing shocks me to the point of my jaw dropping until Trump's #AxiosOnHBO interview Monday. I had to flip down my rear view mirror to double check. Jaw definitely dropped.
Is this, like, a Trump MadLib?
"Donald Trump owning beauty pageants is like Michael Vick owning pet stores."
But what if trump applies to all of the above?
Universal media strategy to make Trump appear less lucid than Biden will not work.  Biden is losing his mental capacities.  Trump is just stupid (can't be bought, pro-American worker, pro-American Industry, thwarts Chinese aggression) and WILL BE A 2-TERM PRESIDENT!
Just wait until Joe has his say. I heard they’re letting him make a statement Monday. Trump will no doubt be the fool.
When I saw there was no longer a checks and balances. That virtually no one in the party would stand against Trump and Trump would openly attack the few that did.
Joe would’ve already made this virus the equivalent of the common flu if he was running the show. Meanwhile Trump’s playing golf.
lol I think he's worse than Trump at this point. The fucking White House is sending a doctor because he refuses to follow basic bullshit
You know Mr. Acosta. The more the majority of the news media hate this man, the more I like him.  During the 16 GOP primaries, Trump was not my choice, or even in my to 7. But now, I’m glad he won and hope he gets re-elected.
They need to fear monger all the idiotic Trump followers in Oklahoma!  Most think it's just the flu and hyped up by the media.  I'm related to some of the morons who buy that shit by the truck full.  It's going to get them killed and possibly kill family members.  #trumpvirus
Trump is the biggest liar ever, and if you can’t see that, maybe fuck all the way off.
Trump not Acosta
So apparently the film Idiocracy wasn’t  a comedy after all, looks like it was a fairly accurate prediction of Trump’s presidency  #Idiocracy  #AnyoneButTrump2020
🤥 Mainly she was aware of Wexner/Maxwell/Epstein cult before New York/Trump ??
Seriously I can’t believe Trump is ruining our national parks for money. Not shocked just repulsed by so much greed and his egotistical power. You do not exist to me or Americans. You psycho. Stay off OUR land! #TrumpFailsAmerica #grandcanyon #GOPCorruptionOverCountry
Each of these wastes of oxygen payed $300,000+   To hit a ball with a stick at Trump's field of grass  Think about that a lil' bit
Don't worry. Trump will continue to do a great job!
I wouldn’t use nazi Germany as a comparison. It’s not going to go over well with people. Lots of Jews are for Trump. If they read that they would be horrified at that comparison.
another federal failure under trump ... almost as if by design
If I see one more “this history expert/part time plumber who accurately predicted every election since Taft says Trump will loose” headline I’m gonna lose my shit. We said the same thing in 2016. There’s too much at stake to take anything for granted. Fucking vote.
Pres. Trump holds Friday evening briefing
Your bio. Hoping to live through this so I can vote against Donald trump...   Jesus Christ, what a silly over the top dramatic thing to say? Hoping to live through this.  Pleas stop talking to me.  I’m getting dumber just engaging with you.
MSM treats OAN the same way lifetime politicians treat President Trump.   With disdain.
Yes, Don Trump is a true man of the people. Well at least those able to afford membership in his clubs.
Well I'm biased, because if history tells us anything, Trump lies about everything.
So sad! This could have been prevented. 💔
Welcome to Trump's America.
I'm shocked. Shocked, I say. 😐
Trump's contempt for America knows no bounds.
The oilfield has been ruined by Trump ! Did you know that ? He lifted the refs and over produced .He has been horrible for our area..
At least, my ex admits Trump has messed up bad!
Biotch, my ex has a beach home there and he did leave ! He said he was safer there than Texas! He is a Trump lover so I might leave! You’ll are crazy..
Thanks for the shoutout!
F them Trump trolls! I am mad tonight ! I am tired!
Donald Trump isnt just a disease. He’s a pandemic coming to end the globe and we must to our best do survive it. We are not ready for another illness to ravage the globe its time we put an end to Donald Trump and save the earth again
I miss my dad ! He would hate Trump and we would have a great time being mad together .. I think he would protest .. I was Republican when he was alive.. He said Girl, you aren’t with that rich guy anymore! I changed parties while he was dying.. My daddy was awesome ..
During the Spanish Flu, the consistent messaging was that wearing a mask is the patriotic thing to do. From the beginning Trump radicalized that same “patriotic” base against wearing a mask and all his attempts fall apart because he’s just too lazy to put and keep a mask on
America  and the  want to cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, SNAP, Our Healthcare  and now Trump and the GOP want to destroy America with Covid-19! Don’t let this happen VOTE BLUE 2020! Bring America back💙🇺🇸💙
All of that, and I didn’t have space to include that Trump is currently ordering his justice department to argue to the Supreme Court that duly passed law, doing exactly what he just writ by fiat, is unconstitutional.
So...Obama had to fight, tooth and nail, despite having a super majority in Congress, to get pre existing conditions in the ACA...then, it was the number one issue the GOP used to get congress back...now, Trump just thinks he can do it by EO? And GOP is just👌🏻 w/this?
that $600 just gives people $15/hr. Those idiots want to give Trump the glory of stimulus check and $400. Call Trump personally threaten them if they/he does that you will never let BUSINESS' not be able to be sued pass!
Trump displayed (okay, read statement) more compassion for Beirut (yes, an awful tragedy) than for any of the 160k Americans lost to COVID-19. #TrumpIsDemented
Yep, that's why they are already coming out with , "Trump won't accept election results ".
Did tRump change his diaper before?
God forbid if our great leader pres. trump caught covid-19 and met his demise what should his tombstone say?
Trump campaign keeps pushing for earlier debate
Does everyone realize this entire nightmare began because Don Trump was offended by Barack Obama's jokes about him at a White House Correspondent's dinner years ago?
Now all Trump supporters have to admit we “have plenty of money” to hand out.   Personally, I’d like all the federal taxes I paid last month to be refunded back to me.
Even  is not airing Trump’s “press conference.”
Every single day since January 2017 I have said/thought that I cannot believe Donald fucking Trump is our President. #TrumpIsDemented  and his #TrumpWordSaladLoop is excruciating 😖

U.S. Intelligence Says Republicans Are Working With Russia to Reelect Trump
ObamaCare, a law that Republicans promised to repeal for 6 years and then suddenly forgot about the day Trump got inaugurated.

COVID cases are rising &amp; still power outages in New Jersey Gov Murphy is having dinner at Trump's golf course. Nobody should be there! Club got special exemption from rules early on.  Revenge (FU USA)is on the menu tonight.
Trump's gonna sign an executive order that requires health insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions.  ... It's called Obamacare.
I don’t sound anything. Obama is a great president. Didn’t say he was the greatest, I don’t think even he would say that. But trump on the other hand has been awful, one scandal after another and all of his own doing.
So if it's EVERYTHING dems wanted, and Trump is just going to give it to them, why did republicans fight against it for so long?
Trump is either in complete denial or just really doesn’t grasp the responsibilities of the job... or he just doesn’t give a shit about average janes &amp; joes...
A note to MSNBC and CNN, don't cover this Trump campaign ad.
Sir, on any scale trump comes out last.
SMH! As a U.S. citizen, I just ask that you not judge the majority of us based on the Trump administration. We envy the people of New Zealand for having a leader with integrity, dignity, leadership, and intelligence. We can’t relate currently. 😫

this is a move out of trump’s playbook and tbh i knew stitt was a trump republican but i at least thought he was the “family values” type that feigns dignity while doing fucked up shit but no he’s genuinely just as fucked up as trump

24/7 unless I MUST go out. Since all alone I must grocery shop &amp; pay bills. I'm in Trump Country where NO masks are worn.
Didn't Trump claim he we wouldn't need contributions to his 2016 campaign because he was so rich?
Distract &amp; Deflect probably. We know Trump said he didn't &amp; we know he won't. They have so much incoming shit, trying to look like they care. But until Trump says it, it's definitely not something we should consider as the real story.
A few things. 1, trump and Biden are both white supremacists in my eyes that do not have the best interest of my people. 2, if you can’t say “because of this policy or this executive order” this means you don’t even want a Biden presidency
Dear capitalists,  No one ever created a job without first having customers. There will be no customers until they feel safe. No one is safe with Trump.  Adam Smith was a fraud. He lived with his mother and inherited his father’s fortune.
Oh hell, Trump found pics of you with young boys I guess.
I’ll start a fundraiser for your bail. 😂🤣😂 He doesn’t care. He was also in a meeting today with no mask or social distancing? He’s Trump 2.0  😡😡
This is what I get stuck on too. How do we keep ourselves safe if someone will not take accountability &amp; change. Like how would we deal with someone like Trump? Or would there be no more Trumps created if everyone had access to mental health care &amp; there wasn't income inequality?
trump even lies about the lies he's lying about! Well over 20,000+ confirmed lies &amp; counting! #LiarInChief #GOTV2020 #BAMN
Trump has never negotiated a deal. He cons saps.
I honestly wonder what trump has on him.
How sad. I'm sure the Trump people behind him will take it to court.
Yes, under Trump flip flops are mandated for all federal workers.
The people would never let that happen. Trump will win. Even after Trump, communism will never happen here. The people will fight to never let that happen.
Just more ways Don Trump is looking out for the needs of the common people.
You mean trump has dementia and is a racist.
Remember when republicans had a conniption fit every time Obama signed an executive order? Remember how they declared it unconstitutional? Apparently that was all bullshit.  Mnuchin Says Trump to Take Executive Action After Talks Stall
So the main message is you will be part of a Trump campaign commercial? Not hey you are wanted for attempted murder and we are coming to get you?
“You know what solves it?” Mr. Trump told Fox News. “When the economy crashes, when the country goes to total hell and everything is a disaster. Then you’ll have a [laughs], you know, you’ll have riots to go back to where we used to be when we were great.”
Megan and cardi have really hit a nerve with conservatives. First we are all wondering how yall heard and/or saw the video. Second, megan and cardi are not role models. Third, if your a trump republican, you are a fucking hypocrite
You'd think all those republican senators were getting a cut of the action from either Trump, or Putin.....oh...wait.......
Yes, yes they are under the Trump Era.
Looked here  Judge rules E. Jean Carroll can continue to seek Trump's DNA in defamation suit
Yeah, its how human history has worked for centuries. The problem is that the American ideal is to demand instant gratification. To compare to other topic, we don't want slightly better Trump, we want Bernie. But politics has never worked like that. So hopefully we get Biden.
When you can’t pay rent, the management will not ask if you voted democrat or republican. When a persons comes to the door with an eviction notice, they don't ask if you are a Trump supporter or not. Nobody is immune to this just like this pandemic.
Trump is funny. He makes me laugh. But still. He still has to be held accountable for the fucked up shit he did
Wow. Trump is corrupt as fuck. Tax fraud, bank fraud, paying off a porn star (his lawyer went to jail for that). His going to jail.
Biden will be better than Trump thought He was!
If we get Bama and LSU I'm calling President Trump IMMEDIATELY!!!!!
tRump is MOST CERTAINLY NOT THE ANSWER! Anything is better than this corrupt lunatic! We need to restore dignity, peace and decency to our nation! Biden will do fine! After 4 years we can go from there! #RepublicansAgainstTrump
The economy will not fully recover until the country gets the coronavirus under control.. lockdowns did contribute to the economic impact, the vast majority of our current economic pain is caused by Americans taking precautions against getting sick.
Believe me when i say, i knew what i said would be, so you say, thought provoking. Aint nothing a little Trump Wall cant fix. Murder in the Streets! Divide the people for they cannot be trusted! A harsh reality but I'm grateful for the little i have.
What effect will Donald Trump Jr.'s recent tweet have on $NAK?
Looks like these red states are reaping Benefits of the Trump administration
We need for all the other democracies to sanction trump for doing what he sanctioned Carrie Lam for doing to Hong Kong. We need to know if we still have any allies.
These mother fuckers LITERALLY said last week that Trump was killing children by reopening schools.

Which Trump has not done. How again is he cosmopolitan?
You make a big deal over Benghazi. It was just one example of the scandals and coverups of the previous administration. I’ll grant you that Obama was probably marginally better than Trump, but it was very marginal. He was an eloquent speaker, though, I’ll give him that.

yeah sure... you know Trump formed the Corona Virus Task Force, around January 31st... while he was being impeached by congress... orange man bad??
All of Trump's speechwriters.
Constantly berating someone in an effort to coerce them is actually the DEFINITION of bullying.  And to boot, you assume I'm a Trump supporter, just like you assume Carano is a racist.  Seems you haven't developed that fourth synapse yet.
Mark it: aid negotiations will fail, Trump will EO, Congress will sue. Why? Might as well find out what SCOTUS thinks should happen during a Legislative failure. Do you have a King or a Republic?

Watching this clown double down on his misunderstanding of linguistics is actually the funniest thing I’ve seen all day. His name is literally from a language that uses aspirate/non-aspirate sounds. He of all ppl should know the h means aspiration &amp; Trump said it wrong 🤡
bill nye is a scientist. LIE. the war on drugs was to stop drug use. LIE. if you like your health insurance you can keep it. LIE. gender wage gap. LIE. abortion is for rape victims. LIE. the food pyramid is healthy. LIE. gulf of tonkin. LIE. trump put kids in cages. LIE.
I guess but most Christians don’t follow his teachings.  If they did Trump would not have their support the way he does.  They also wouldn’t glorify the money the way they do.  They also wouldn’t be against making sure everyone had health care or caring for the poor
Literally what the hell is going on right now with this country?
'regardless of the treatment and response to the woman VP, the reaction will be affirmative for the presumptuous confirmation bias laid out before she was even chosen.' Think it'll be worse than how people treat Trump? My guess is no. 🤷🏼
Trump murders irony again. Can some other major countries please sanction Trump for the same damn thing? It would really help us to know who is on our side.
Donald Trump has the blood of a fucking 7 year old child on his hands now.
Will Trump use that “unilateral action” like he threatened?
Most of Trump's opponents have not been to prison so there's that.
Don’t think it’s a cause for celebration. Better than Trump but only marginally. We should be able to do so much better.
I JUST FOUND OUT I WAS FOLLOWING DONALD TRUMP GONNA GO THROW UP
😂 you are playing right! So we doing stupid shit again like 2016. Just come out and say bruh! You want trump to win
A lot of talk about a potential TikTok ban in the US, but the restrictions on Tencent could have a much, much wider impact on tech and entertainment.
tRump sucker. I may have to steal that.
I really didn't think anyone could be worse, then Trump Lite shows up.
Trump needs to be held accountable. The scope of his criminality cannot be ignored. If he gets a pass then the next republican in that office will be even worse.  Will Trump face real consequences for his crimes? The answer will haunt America's future
After watching interviews with several members of Trump’s administration this week I think Trump is sharing his stash. They all actually seem high. Very high.

That's one of the things it's been about since Day 1:  College athletics: The NCAA did their part and stayed quiet early in the pandemic.  They let Trump &amp; Co push the K-12 narrative and waited for the trickle up.
This sounds like a Donald trump tweet 😂😂😂
The first round should have focused on all those things, too. Are republicans still trying to add billions in military funding and funding for a new FBI building into it? Because that's not focusing on the people who need help. And now trump is golfing and you're doing what?
Only 11? Where's the  love?
He doesn’t care about the black vote. He talking  to his white base that blm are bad. That’s all trump cares about.

Don’t know if Joe lost the black vote but  he’s not gaining more black votes. He needs to stop talking so much. We don’t want a Democrat trump when it comes down to speech. He has to pull it together and stay focus because he going lose the white male vote so he needs us to win

Somebody make a Trump, Nickelback, graph meme
Trump can tell his supporters two completely contradictory statements at the same time and they will believe both of them. If you try to point out that they both can't be true they will scream fake news. That is the depth of their intelligence.
If you believe republicans are protecting your freedoms, you are not paying attention.  I don't know you. I don't want to know you. I'm not sure why you chose me to try and have this "conversation" with. We are never going to agree if you believe that trump and the GOP is good.
Trump Administration Secretly Blocked US Weed Research for Years, Memo Shows impeach the bastard
Joe Biden is both articulate &amp; reads well. He does flub words and panics, probably from his early stutter.  Trump’s reading skills are abysmal. I doubt he even knows that word. When he speaks, he often doesn’t form complete sentences &amp; is difficult to follow.  It’s word vomit.
This is what the Trump circus has done to dumb down our elections! 🙈
I remember a couple times when Whitney Houston was interviewed by Oprah and Barbara Walters and I noticed her sweating. At that time I didnt realize that was a sign of drug use. So, Im just asking if Trump sweating could be a sign of anything,other than possibly illegal drug use.
Maybe it's just me. Life was much happier when the racists kept their racism a secret. I'm so tired of this shit. People say Obama divided the country. Yeah cause he was black and some couldn't handle it. But Trump's America gave full permission to show hate #gop
Thank you, but no thank you. I don't need others to tell me how to think or what to believe. I can read and follow along on my own using reputable resources. Please just go away. Anyone who believes that trump is doing anything good for this country is lost to me forever. Bye!
Imagine thinking gamers wouldn’t rise up and help Trump ban all that shit.
He's not doing it for security reasons. He is doing it because Tik Tok made a fool of him many times. He does things for Trump, not America's best interest.
Latino voters in my area are mostly pro Trump.  You speak lies... #Obamagate

Trump &amp; team has had months to put together a nationwide strategy on re opening the country, schools &amp; slowing the spread of the virus. They had years to make voting more secure both at the polls &amp; by mail. They've failed miserably.

It does now. I was a 40-yr member of the GOP until Trump was nominated. After the enablement and corruption I have seen from the GOP, there is no more GOP in my future. 🇺🇸
Yes. Trump was mentioned by name is the case documents for Epstein’s trial and a child says he was one of the men to rape her on that island. Biden is not perfect. He’s not my first pick but I won’t vote for monsters.
No I am not supporting trump.
Did his doctor tell you that? Cause trump was bragging about passing a stroke test and just called Thailand thigh land.
You’ve obviously never heard trump speak. It sounds like he’s having a stroke every time he opens his mouth.
Trump is off the chain crazy! I think he is starting to feel desperate. He knows he is headed for a loss! Bigly!
Well Trump fails at both!
I agree, many of us just believe Trump is a liar, disgusting, corrupt, and has no morals, and supportin a person like that would say something about our own character and morals.
Sure, but Trump only has one play in his playbook, which is to go for the base that he already has and couldn't lose if, well, as he put it, if he stood on 5th avenue and shot people. It's a completely foolish strategy and I fervently hope it that it works as badly as it should.
The answer will always be "Trump is speaking"  until January, anyway
If Donald Trump asked a black journalist if he took a “cocaine test” it would be wall to wall coverage of him being racist.  But Joe Biden said it so he gets a pass.
Dude... I know people don’t like Trump and he’s said dumb things... but I really feel like Biden is just as bad.

Need Trump to not be President for that prediction to happen. He hates Bazos! I could see Congress reform the postal service before that happens.

Trumps rhetoric is inexcusable and probably the worst of any modern president. However, our country has a federalist system. The Trump Administration provided ventilators, startup for a vaccine, and other federal aid. Ultimately though it is up to the states to govern themselves.
6, every time Trump speaks/tweets.
I feel like people have forgotten that Trump changed the motto on the Statue of Liberty to fit his immigration policy. We slip further into fascism every day.

I didn't say it was a good strategy. :-)  I think the Biden campaign would be well served staying out of the headlines for the most part. Let Trump dominate the news cycle with his... Trumpiness. Biden's been shooting himself in the foot since at least 1988, so why chance it?

Also here is how it works Vote for Trump=Trump, Vote for Biden=Biden, Vote for third party=Third Party, Vote for No One=No One. Wanna get us to vote for Biden make him go left, why is the pressure on us to give up what we believe in, why can’t it be on him to win us over.
Why can’t we try to push Biden to the Medicare for All position, why can’t they ever unite on actual progressive issues, why do we constantly have to give up our principles to vote for the lesser of 2 evils? Voting for the lesser of two evils for so long got us Trump.
from what i’ve seen, he’s talked about using “emergency economic powers” or making an “executive order.” im not actually sure of the legitimacy of the threat but he’s definitely being pushier about it now than before. here’s a link

You really have unrealistic expectations of humanity, don't you? It's actually quite simple --&gt; if it's something Trump does, then it must be bad. Nothing deeper need be said.
I wonder think trump is so good yeah I believe he is better than last one. We go from liberal to right what is coming next
stop making trump your lifestyle and go get educated on oppression and equality.

All trump has done is ban TIK tok and 18 year olds from buying juuls

It's funny to me that Donald Trump is pretty much everything Republicans feared Obama would be. The only difference is he's 'on their side'. I yearn for the day 20 years from now that no one even mentions they're past support of Trump, due to the shear shame from hindsight.
Donald trump is a 🤡🤡
We had an election during the Civil freaking War, and during WW 2.  We wouldn't even delay an election for the greatest President ever and we're damn sure not doing it for the worst.  Once again, Trump proves he knows nothing about the country.
The stupidity of the government was previously hid under a thinly veiled mask; trump has shown a spotlight on it (and his own stupidity). Postponing election but open schools. Can’t make this up
Oh I hope trump is watching this nba game.
The real October surprise. Green men are going to show up and endorse Trump. They have some next level kompromat!
(Trump wants to delay election; there is no bottom on this guy).

I’m confused. Where was the restraint the last 3 years? We are already too deep in debt to recover. We need a currency reset. Financialization, fractional reserve lending, and federal reserve intervention are what got us here. Trump will be the fall guy for decades of $ abuse.

Right. And it is despicable that Trump is using him this way. Yes, younger ppl would respond to him. But the message has to be that if they seriously plan to vote, they must vote for REAL. No more reality stars!!
Trump has not asked for forgiveness because he believes he is without sin.🤣

Trump is such a bozo.  He thinks talking to the president is "leaking" information, and I bet no one could convince him otherwise.
Trump doesn't know what sources are in the room.  Some of his most trusted aides are direct pipelines to the press.
I absolutely believe Jim Acosta over Trump.  Trump is incapable of telling the truth so he projects that on everyone else he feels threatened by.

I’m watching the Axios interview with Trump and within the first 30sec before the Jonathan Swan walks in, it says “masks required” ..... and it still blows my mind how ppl fussing about masks. Even the White House is requiring masks but ppl refuse. 🤡
Trump, you were puke incarnate when you called Dr Birx “pathetic.” You should thank your lucky stars that she has a strong commitment to the people (not you),&amp; it would serve you right if she handed you her data and said, “it is up to you now...”
Listen, those two have been so unfairly targeted by Trump and GOP. It really really angered me when he pretended to be Lisa in the throes of...affection. He is one sick mother.
I dunno,  maybe Trump administration has diverted so much money from defense to build the wall,  Republicans tried to slip in money to replace what was diverted.  The plan was criticized,  so hand off responsibility. Maybe???
Agreed and is disgusting. I hope after Trump’s Gilded Age of Lies, corruption will be rooted out of both sides.   I can dream.
He’s not gonna hurt Biden. He will hurt trump
Fast chance since trump doesn't believe US intelligence services
It’s probably not what puts Trump away (hard to prove, unlike the bank and insurance fraud investigations), but it could endanger Jared Kushner once everything is uncovered.

Because you are a caring, compassionate physician, you would never think of adding additional pain to the bereaved by making such a statement.  Trump, on the other hand, has no soul and cannot express genuine sympathy.

Trump haphazardly repatriated over 85K Americans from Europe, mostly through New York and New Jersey with *NO HEALTH SCREENING IN PLACE*  That's the reason the Tri-State area got hit so hard.
Amazingly poor take.   Had Trump had alerted US Customs and set up even basic health screening before he repatriated all those Americans from Europe through JFK and EWR, NYC wouldn't have been hit so hard to quickly.  We're the 8th worst in the world.
It sent chills down my spine hearing his fans clap when he announced it. Most Trump supporters really are racist, let no one convince you otherwise.
Trump repealed a rule allowing low-income housing to coexist with suburbs. He's basically axing minorities from white neighborhoods. Looks like segregation is going to be one of his many racist campaign policies this time round

Did anybody see the Hunger Games? Do you remember at the end, Snow had everybody send the children forward to be safe? That is eerily similar to Trump demanding kids go back to school. Same outcome.

Interesting take considering I posted an article showing you wrong about your Deutsche Bank tweet and you’ve provided nothing. Are you just trying deflect because that’s what moronic trump cultists have been taught to do?
The word would be nonexistent!😬 it will have a very good 6000 dollar deductible,  thats the cheapest ever! (Read that last part in Trump voice)
I think Trump should just do it, he likes hearing his own voice so much anyway. And Biden can just chock up the W. 🤔😆

You know...I gotta say, whoever the “political people” in the WH are; those who advised Trump that the virus was only hitting blue states and therefore would be a good thing to them...those are not very smart aides.

Stevens believes Donald Trump “just removes the necessity of pretending” Republicans care about social issues. Instead, it’s all about “attacking and defining Democrats”. The idea that “character counts”, so prominent in earlier decades, is forgotten.

I’m fine with almost any of the candidates. Trump will latch on to her statements at the Scientology event and it will be very problematic.
So listening to Dr. Birx it seems the Trump administration has shifting from blaming the governors to blaming the American people for the COVID deaths and cases.
Listening to Dr. Birx on CNN makes me realize she is just as incompetent as everyone else in the Trump Administration.  No wonder there are over 150k dead Americans because of Trump's lack of response.
Ahhh what’s wrong fatdad? Did the big bad paper tell us trump’s gestapo was the group that was inciting the violence?

That’s a lie.   Trump went to court with Epstein over Maison de l’Amitie not to ban him from his club, and it happened well before police began investigating Epstein.
He could send someone up there with a cardboard cut out of himself, and he would still beat trump in a debate.He’s like a Democratic George Bush. He may suck, but he’s too tame and stupid to do anything that bad. We know how awful Trump is, Biden won’t be worse.

Because Trump says so and therefore, so does the governor.
Also of course, the Trump administration has limited enrollment in ACA so this is really a hollow promise, in addition to being hypocritical since he is asking S. Ct. to strike down ACA. Chaos.
Wonder why the Trump administration would want to gut the USPS? It is just to fuck over poor rural people and potentially add more chaos to the presidential election? Surely not.
Is Trump now attacking the concept of......pharmacists?

While watching Trump and his "presser", I came to the conclusion that he is just a hateful, despicable person and I don't much like him.
Yep, like that 1.75 billion dollar new funding for FBI building stuck in the bill. Trump screwed up the deal for a new FBI building swapping the current building and site in exchange for private developer building a new FBI building in suburbs of D.C. that was under way.
trump people  easy to spot some of them
I always wonder which once's are trump stupid and which one's are natural stupid. Its hard to tell by looking at them and sometimes you can tell after they speak or comment.  I wish there was an easier way to tell which stupid they are.
No comeback would have been necessary if the Trump administration had not botched the response to the pandemic, instead we'll all have jobs as grave diggers.

Well that's a novel way get out of having to meet Mr. Trump.
Why should he?  Trump’s doing the work of making himself look bad. Why stop him?
His hotel makes perfect sense to me.  It’s down the street.  He owns it, so he can charge the RNC a HUGE amount and profit from it - you know, all the normal trump things.
So it's kind of hilarious when the right and/or the anti-anti-Trump left keeps trying to weaponize entirely predictable Biden gaffes. Stupid shit may end up deciding this election (it always can), but that's not the stupid shit that'll do it.

Maybe they hold off on indictments until after Trump is no longer in office so he cannot exercise his pardon power? Knowing Trump, he will just issue blanket pardons to his family and friends before he leaves office anyway so probably doesn't matter. Plus, there is always State.
If necessary, after waiting in a 8 hour line, I would then crawl across hot coals and broken glass to vote Trump out.
The real reason - not racial strife - that she upset 'with Trump' is probably because a whole lot of people are pressuring her to become Biden's running mate.

If Taven met his Commander on Cheif Donald Trump tomorrow, how do you think Trump would treat him?
I think that WAS the personal message. I can imagine Trump saying, " Just act normal, Kev, don't change a thing, it will go away one day. And BTW, I got some Hydoxycloriquine to sell you."
You should be ashamed of yourself junior . We know you won’t be , you’re a trump
OKAY WELL we came to Tulsa for arraignment for the misdemeanor charges from the Trump rally and they scheduled our hearing for Feb. 1, 2021. This is not normal. All it is is the police state flexing their fake authority in an attempt to silence, minimize, &amp; intimidate us.
I believe DHS is only telling the side that casts them and Trump in a favorable light.   Yes, protest violence is terrible, but escalating force is not the answer.
Perhaps lay off the coffee a bit... and the all-caps.  Watch, this post will be used by the GOP/Trump campaigns.

"I was upset that Director Comey didn't coordinate that with us and acted unilaterally," Yates said.  "We would note that Yates wasn't too upset to warn the incoming Trump administration about Flynn just 48 hours after the FBI launched a perjury trap against him." - ZH
Big huge difference. Clinton actually was accused of a crime in which was proven he did. Trump was never accused of an impeachable crime. What they did accuse him of he didn't do! Dems ran a kangaroo court. Repubs gave Clinton all the time he wanted. Nothing was done in secret!
I think it might have to do with the census. The NY AG tweeted earlier today the hearing on Trump's order excluding certain people was scheduled for today. I don't know what happened but I'm saying census solely because I don't want to be disappointed.
I'm afraid to get excited, too. I wonder if it's about the census litigation between NY AG and Trump Administration. I hope for something else, obviously, but I'm going with census litigation to avoid disappointment.
There is a racist running for POTUS, and he ain’t Donald Trump.
She might be a squish on policy, but the reason why Okla Co Republicans should have always preferred Bice is that the Trump voters Neese attracts were always coming home, but the moderates in the suburbs needed a reason. Neese ain’t that reason. She’s gonna beat Bice, tho. 🤷‍♀️
Trump's main significance for that corner of the left is that he provides more occasions for liberals to respond in ways they hate.
They should have all been primaried for Trump conservatives.
Oklahoma!  BTW, all 77 OK counties voted for POTUS Trump in 2016. 😊
I think this is what the so-called 'Deep State' really fears about Trump - not that he lies but that he occasionally blurts out truths we're not supposed to know.

4.9 million AMERICANS INFECTED and that's counting only those who have been able to obtain a test with results. The deaths will only keep rising, with diabetics at the top of the list at risk. Nothing ridiculous about it, except Trump Chump's support of an incompetent President.
If this is true, it seems Trump is taking advantage of a Kanye West who might not be in his best right mind right now. That is despicable. Bad enough to undermine the election but he truly is using an individual who is not fit emotionally, apparently.
Six words that terrify Trump.

What you describe has happened around the world. Trump is world’s better than a career political hack that is now worth millions as a “public servant” and is adopting every socialist program there is. Add in dementia and his corrupt, racist history and you have a flawed candidate
I wonder why Trump installed someone to slow down the mail? Must be unrelated.
I'm not suggesting he will be. And you'd know Alabama's views on Medicaid better than I would. But Trump won Alabama by 28 points in 2016. He won Oklahoma, where I live, by 36. If Medicaid expansion can win here, it can win anywhere.

Exactly. 99.9% of his party stand in lockstep behind him. Trump isn't the disease, just a very severe symptom.
More evidence of Democrat-China collusion in Covid than there ever was Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia? I don’t recall any Repubs taking up for Russia. Have you ever heard a prominent Dem criticize China... ever?  Does anyone believe Dems are “above” colluding w/China?

Trump's DHS Running Terror Probe Into Antifa Over International Support ...  via
If the Biden administration decides not to prosecute, or if Biden decides to issue pardons, the Republicans will laugh and laugh and will say allegations about Trump crimes were lies all along.
To clarify my statement: I thought Trump said Lebanon officials said it was a bomb. I misunderstood. He said he spoke with generals who said it was an attack. It probably doesn’t matter what I heard but oh well. It is what it is.
I would give ANYTHING to see you put a trigger in Daniel Dale's hand that he could press, in real time, that would set off a buzzer and red flashing lights when Trump lies during these press conferences. As a viewer, that would totally make my day!
Another Trump “No shit, Sherlock” statement.
Trump’s bias for Florida is showing. He claims Florida’s elections are well-run. There was an entire SCOTUS case regarding Florida’s crappy election system. Oh, and they won’t listen to the electors who wanted former convicts to be given the right to vote.
It was obvious from the beginning when Trump left it to the states that he would blame governors for any mis-steps or bad #coronavirus #numbers, especially Democratic governors.    And here we are.
Trump sounded pretty certain that Lebanon authorities are convinced it was a bomb. Either he is not telling the truth or he disclosed something he should not have disclosed. I say this because I would assume it would be up to Lebanon to take that announcement.
Good question. Most anyone that has been wrong as much as Fauci would have been fired by now. The left loves him I guess because they realize he is sabotaging the Trump Administration.
Oh so the GOP gets to hand pick which states vote by mail, red states yes, blue states no! Wow sounds like something a dictator would say. If you vote for Trump you can vote by mail, but if you vote for Biden you can’t. He’s lost his fucking mind. How can anybody vote for him?
I don’t understand how Bill Stepien sends Trump out to debate. I expect conditions demanded that will give Trump an out.
Yes, he just recently said that, we could go on forever. The quid pro quo on video in Ukraine would have finished most politicians. Trump gets impeached for wanting to investigate Biden’s crime. Incredible.
No. Just having a hard time squaring lifelong moderate dem who didn’t vote for Obama in 2012 but did vote for Hillary In 2016 and is now a hard core Trump supporter. Seems like a pretty drastic conversion that you went through.
He did it to make the Covid deaths look as bad as possible to bring down Trump. Only possible explanation.
You mean Biden’s statements of 125 million Americans dying from Covid-19 or the 150 Million that have died from gun deaths since 2007? And they called Trump “unfit” for office in 2016? Biden thinks he’s running for the US Senate😳

What are they going to do, drag the delegates up there and point a gun at their head until they nominate Trump?  Torture them until they do? 🙄
my favorite part is when trump says something along the lines of "i have great (reading) comprehension, better than anyone you have ever interviewed" when asked if he reads his intelligence briefings
He reminds me of no one so much as my alcoholic, union-busting, ignorant, arrogant grandfather--but at his worst, not at his best--who died in his mid eighties 25 years ago. Trump does, I mean. Not Swan.
if you haven't watched the whole thing, you should  trump continues dancing around questions to make himself look great and swan keeps interjecting quietly into his mic with 1 liners about what the facts actually are
Actually, I’ve often thought racism is the default mode for the GOP. That being said, awfully nice to see someone making Lindsay nervous other than Trump!

Devout Trump voters and devout Bernie voters appear to be the opposite ends of the same populist horseshoe.

From  in    "America’s actual foe is radical covid-nineteen. It is a foe that’s terrorizing the country Trump leads, leaving mass death in its wake.  "The president is unwilling to acknowledge its true scale."
No Prez has ever stoked racial unrest like Obama. He did it the other day while giving the John Lewis eulogy. No Prez has done more for blacks than Trump. That is a fact. Amazing the people that let biased media make up their minds on who to vote for, rather than facts.
Donald Trump had 5 Secretaries of HHS in the first year of his presidency. Does anyone else think that’s very telling of the current health crisis?

Someone should remind Trump that Epstein died while in the custody of his administration.
Trump reminds me of early in my career trying to impress somebody on a subject I didn’t know enough about and was would get completely flustered.
It's not that Trump doesnt care about disabled ppl. He actively DESPISES us, &amp; thinks that we're weak by virtue of our disabilities. He openly flirts with the ideas eugenics is built upon.  He doesn't want a sign language interpreter because he'd rather disabled ppl die.
No school can educate Trump.
Trump tactics are so stupid. They knew the axios interview would air last night. They also knew it was a disaster. So they call a 5 pm presser to see if he can change the narrative before the narrative. Dumb.
By screwing with the mail, Trump is also making it more unreliable to do business by mail.
I couldn't tell if that was  or  doing the Axios interview with Trump tonight. He nailed the perplexed, dumbfounded expression she uses in her comedy skits dealing with Trump's nonsense. PRICELESS.
Nope, more like  skit, they have the same perplexed expressions while trying to deal with Trump's nonsense. Why is Trump still in office? 52 cowardly and complicit Senators, that's why.
My first thought was "Trump wants in on this".  Always the grift...

Also a video from 2004 of Jerald Nadler speaking to the fraud potential of  Mail-In ballots.  Now they see it as a tool to defeat Trump and they say Mail-In’s are fine.
You can thank Hillary Clinton for that interference. Dang, you're not up on the latest information. Do you get MSNBC in the great white north? You must, if you still believe Trump was working WITH the Russians.
I couldn't give a crap what Trump says. It's funny that in 2008 Debbie Wasserman-Schultz (Liberal Democrat) was saying the same thing. If it works so well, then why don't we know who won the elections in New York from over A MONTH AGO? Because it DOESN'T work.
The Democrats don’t want people to get over it fast. They want as many sick people for as long as possible. All to get rid of Trump. Real reason they hate  Hydroxychloroquine, it helps people.
That's somewhat true. Biden has done zero in all the yrs he's been in government! Trump's done way more than he promissed! Great pres. Another 8 yrs.!!! Then his son!

If there's an upside to the ambitious foreigners &amp;/or traitors to USA ladies &amp; gents in the backroom who selected Kamala Harris as Biden's VP is this: They had to get someone who is not a 100% natural born citizen. They tried with Obama, Rubio &amp; Cruz.
Who cares, both Biden and Harris are Democrats and can say anything needed at the moment for effect and change to an alternative view an instant later.
"It was a debate!" Translation: 'My effective attacks on Biden's character and record were just about trying to win votes. I didn't believe what I was saying.'

Biden has blocked access to his senate records. What else can you look at?
Polls before Biden's VP announcement said President Trump had 40% of the black vote. So now, he has 66% of the black vote? lol
I will not buy into all these trump distractions, propaganda and just treasonous action.  I will spread Biden and Harris’ message of progress, helping others and how we can restore our standing with our allies.
I think  commits an impeachable offense everyday.  This is why it’s imperative that Biden/Harris have to be elected. Restore dignity and honor to the USA.

He doesn’t even know what office he’s running for and thinks he has to beat Joe Biden to win the election.... for congress... 🤦‍♂️ It’s ALL about our rights... it says in the constitution... look it up Joseph
Biden can’t answer any real questions.  He can barely recognize where he’s at.

Trump is not a racist. Look at what he had done for blacks   Biden is a racist. Look at his words and what he has done for blacks. Nothing

I am going to vote for Biden/Harris. I was going to pretty much regardless but don’t insult my intelligence by pretending they’re above critique. Especially a woman who argued for legal slavery to continue.
Ignorance is bliss.  Biden cheating?  Now that’s fresh.
As directed by the Constitution, a presidential candidate must be a natural born citizen of the United States, a resident for 14 years, and 35 years of age or older. Hmmm if Biden dies then..?

Can you please explain this idiotic statement,  I suppose you think Biden who can't remember where he is or Kamala that jailed thousands for victimless crimes can do better, please wake up before you destroy your childrens future.
Hilarious to see all these Liberal drones opine on this senseless bullshit. Joe Biden doesn't have a clue. He's just trying to appear like he has a plan. A national mask mandate even outdoors is utter lunacy. Joe's handlers (Far Left) are making all the calls. It's all politics.

I figured it out...you are Joe Biden.
Cause it was a stupid ass question that’s why. those same reporters won’t ask joe Biden about his sexual encounters or him smelling kids or kamala robbing people of their freedoms in prison. That’s why he moved on . Stupid media
ya cuz joe biden is gonna deescalate fascism
😂😂😂 but let’s bash Tucker when Biden doesn’t even say it correctly!!! This is priceless!
Biden: Can I smell your hair?  Harris: Crap he is a creeper!!!
A dictator. Last I read a dictator wants to rule a whole country and take freedoms away. That’s not Trump. That Biden saying he want everyone to wear a mask outdoors or indoors, that’s dictating everything. Trump left it up to the states
keep going off about how we shouldn’t vote for Biden/Kamala bc they’re the lesser of the two evils like trump isn’t putting children in cages and trying to take away lgbtq+ rights and abortion access and literally just made a comment supporting redlining like it’s 1950 tho
How's does America like Biden now?

You mean intolerant racist voters.   Harris grew up with Hindu and Christian parents, and was raised in the 23rd Avenue Church of God in Oakland. She's married to a Jewish man. Biden and his wife are Roman Catholics.
Whoa. If I had a yard I'd buy one. Gimme them stickers, DSCC and DLCC and DCCC and the Biden campaign!

Except for when she helps Joe Biden accountable, in a Democratic debate, for racism. She regularly plays the black card, even though she was sworn into Congress as an Indian. Her record begs for questions like this. They undermine her bona fides.

Trump hits back at Biden after call for national mask mandate: ‘Stop playing politics with the virus’ | Fox News
Which is very good for this election to get Trump out of office. Biden is just as horrible but Harris will be the puppet since he can’t do shit on his own without help lol. I wish Jo Jorgensen had more support.
Because they don’t want to be asked any questions except from msnbc or cnn. Because they cannot answer them. Like why did Harris agree on April 2019, that Biden had molested women?
um...no, she's not. based on her not being born here, she shouldn't be allowed to be on the ticket, because if biden is removed from office, we would have a non American as President, and we all know that's not Constitutionally allowed
The problem with Democrats is they don't have anyone's back but their own. The majority are a bunch of crooks. Hillary, Biden, Omar, Tlaib, AOC, etc. Prosecute &amp; put them under the jail.
I vote with my finances. If Biden wins expect to pay out the ass in taxes for all of their social programs.

Question: Biden just said we need a nation-wide mask mandate. My thought: If masks are so helpful, that we need a federal mandate.....why would we need universal main-in voting? If I were  I'd ask Biden if he is willing to forsake mail in voting to get a mask mandate.

I am going to predict right now that come Oct. Bill Barr and the DOJ will arrest Comey, other FBI agents, Obama, AND Joe Biden.  Trump has said as much. Even drunk Judge Pierro ( I know its misspelled) has predicted that something will happen before the Election.
Is the  looking into her comment about something happening to  before the Election!!??? That’s a huge statement to make! What does she mean by that? What does she know? Is somebody going to try to assassinate Joe Biden!???

It seems like Biden’s entire strategy is based around the goal of beating Trump.  Is that what you’re seeing?  And is “what you are against” enough to win an election?

And they are going with Biden is on cognitive decline. This moron  can’t even read.
Everyone checking it out at once is probably bogging down their system.  I've seen enough.  If Biden wins it'll be because he cheated.  No way any American that sees this would vote for him. Only someone anti-American wants to destroy our country.

Trump didn't cause the virus, and Joe Biden is responsible for millions of Americans locked up, and surely some who unfairly died in prison. How is that better?

Well Vickie, I mean my tweet to you was pretty straightforward in that it was a question based on your tweet about Biden-Harris. Had nothing to do with  but I’m glad you acknowledge you can’t even follow a simple question (or realize I was joking about all.the.way)
Sadly these Negoes allow it. Biden said the same about Obama and noone on the left and no WOKE black person spoke up about it. Pityful.
Trump isn’t responsible for the deaths. If you think that we need to shut this whole country down and have nothing going then you are in sane. If you support Biden in Harris you support socialism which is an essence communism. That won’t fly here in the United States
Kids in cages happened under Obama/Biden in 2014. Every one of you liberals keeps trying to blame Trump for that and it’s not his fault for that. Trump took action against the virus and his travel bans. The Democrats called him everything in the book 1/2
Trump didn’t separate kids from families. That started in 2014 under Obama/Biden. Blame it on the right people.. It’s the Democrats that haven’t come to the table and negotiated anything
You can follow Jesus and be totally confident that Trump is doing more Christian things then Biden or Harris have ever done. If you support abortion you cannot support Jesus would be a follower either.
First of all children in cages happened in 2014 under Obama/Biden. That was in Trump. And Jesus didn’t deny healthcare. If that was the case he wouldn’t have healed the people that he did. Keep up with your false teaching. The Bible warned us Christians about people like you

Yes Joe Biden's a racist along with every single American. As a lifelong Christian with a preacher in our family we collectively reject Trump as a man of no faith in Christ. He doesn't even know any of the Bible and breaks Commandments daily. False Prophet
At this point I feel like third party votes will just get Trump elected :( there are too many people who are resigned (excited even!) to vote Biden/Harris. Soooo fuckin lame.
I actually didn’t think Biden could lose at this point, however adding someone that was garnering around 2% of the vote when you had to drop out of the primary could actually do the trick. When identity politics goes wrong...

Tara reads LIED!! If you cannot see that then you have blinders on. Are you kidding me? NoI one but a neighbor (she likely called for backup) 40 years ago suddenly remembered?!? And her brother. Periodi. No one else who worked around them ever saw that in Joe Biden. So it’s BS.
Trump wants us all to be able to do that. Biden only wants his buddies to be able to do it and the rest of us to pay for it!
TLDR. You cannot ask people to vote for Biden just cus “it’s the lesser of two evils”
LOVE him!  #WheresFauci?  Is he in the basement with Biden?
Nope, ridin with Biden. Back the blue wave!
Yeh because Joe Biden certainly can't and she can do what she does best
Biden is lying. He condemned white supremacists when he said it. He did not "call white supremacists very fine people"
Biden sure will.

So his endorsement was to guarantee a speaking part at the convention? It wasn’t because he prefers Biden to the orange idiot?
Joe Biden spoke at a KKK klansman’s funeral who was his friend.
Why is it that everytime a Black person runs for high office we hear about how articulate they are? As if it wonder when there is an articulate  Negro. Heard a CNN or MSNBC talk about how articulate  Biden's VP choice, Camel Hair, is.

The most tragic thing is over 160,000 people have died from the #coronavirus and it didn’t have to be this way. When Obama and Biden, were in office and Ebola came around, ONLY 2 Americans died.....(2) That’s what you call leadership....in a crisis!

Apparently Joe Biden picking 1 of his 2 narrowed options, chosen for race &amp; sex, specifically the one that called him a racist, is an 11. Great critical thinking, Jennifer.
Conservative Reporters need to ask the question and know his gonna blow. It only proves what we already know!  Health questions for Biden off-limits for media, unlike Reagan, McCain and Trump

lmao bitch if you dont think dems and republicans are colluding to slowly strangle your rights then you are a smooth brain. the two party system is a smokescreen. biden wants the same thing as trump. total control
Can someone please tell me if the Biden/Harris speeches were broadcast on all the networks?  Thank you.
Only if they don’t want people to realize that Biden was chosen by a black President twice as a running mate. Biden chose made a historical move in choosing a black woman as his running mate.  But sure he’s racist 😂😂
Explain to me why  did not excommunicate Biden and Pelosi??
I was too busy watching Biden/Harris. Not that was electrifying! 💪
Lol have you noticed since Trump has been in office attacks on the US have been almost non existent. As soon a Biden takes office if he wins, they will start right back up.
Has she changed her belief?  If so, why did she do so?
Biden and his newly chosen running mate campaigned together for the first time today, as the former primary rivals sought to solidify their advantage over President Trump and secure their place in American history.
After their first formal appearance together as a presidential ticket what do you think of Biden/Harris? Who will win? So far Trump/Pence is way in the lead with 68%.
I bet Biden reads his Intel briefing every day.
I can’t stand Trump and I can’t stand Biden. This sucks man
Who said I wasn't voting for Biden? Why do you keep making strawman arguments against me? Are you embarrassed and this is like a weird  defense mechanism?
Old creepy bumbling Biden.
I think I just had an orgasm watching Biden/ Harris.
Biden has an anti gay history, Trump does not
OMG, this is hilarious!  I just did it and after you type  it does go straight to   That is too cool!!! Love whoever is the keyboard warrior who did this!!!
Joe  - “unlike the African American community, the Latino community is incredibly diverse-“ - “poor kids are just as bright as white kids” - “if you don’t know whether you’re for me or for Trump, you ain’t black!”  Biden
Okay everyone. On 3 everyone will forget the attack on Biden from Harris. She called him a racist among other allegations. On 3, we pretend it never happened.  1..... 2..... 3  Hey look! Puppies!
Biden and Harris are WEAK on crime and want to see our cities burn, unlike President Trump and Vice President Pence who are working to restore LAW AND ORDER.
Phony Kamala Harris, Joe Biden’s new liberal handler.
I get people wanting trump out of office but.. Biden??? After the #metoo movement?? Just a thought.
This Biden speech is absolutely amazing and Presidential as all get out.
Joe Biden has no real solutions for our country. Bashing Trump is all he has.
Omg. I'm listening to Biden and crying like a baby.
SPECIAL REPORT: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris make their first joint appearance.
They only mean something if you're a republican law abiding citizen. Sadly the girl accusing Biden probably wont get justice because all the demonrats dont care because it doesn't fit their agenda.
At Biden/Harris event - they're late, and the reason the campaign is saying is some power issues but there have been no lighting problems, etc in the gym where they are having it.  Suppose the power issue is trying to power #JoeChina up?
A vote for Biden is a vote for Harris.

Or make it better! Amerikkka is right where it won't to be! The system not broke! It's working just like they want it to be! The words of Plies! The problem is we got sellouts like Kamala acting like she for us. But she not! U just want our votes just like biden! I was blind with
I knew u was full of crap before Tulsi Gabbard exposed u. The sad thing is everybody seen her expose u and act like u good for the country! You no better than Trump! Biden is no better than Trump! Amerikkka is a joke! It's only going to get worse! You chumps won't make a change
"if and when Biden decides to step aside"
That’s weird, you haven’t expressed this excitement for Biden vs Trump?
Scared of Joe Biden? The guy doesn’t know where he is most of the time and it shows every time he speaks. And Kamala Harris is a Christmas in August gift to Republicans. She is so unliked by even Democrats that she even dropped out before the primaries.
Fuck Biden in his dead brain
Harris: 'I believe' Biden accusers
He stopped the flights incoming from China while Pelosi was telling everyone to come to China Town because it was safe. The rest was the failures of Democratic leadership from mayors &amp; govenors. Also if he spied on Biden it would probably be a horror film. GD Pedophiles.
Remember when kamala said she believes everyone of Biden’s accusers. What happen there? Hush money I assume
Gross. We need to shed more light on this. World wide pedophilia ring going on right now. Her &amp; Biden are complicit. KLM!
wouldn’t it be great if the presidential debate was just Biden and Trump going back and forth with “it’s the ____________ for me”
Biden/ Harris:  We won't kill your kids!  (Unless they aren't fit for slave labor- then all bets are off).
Ration that insulin right- or it's really YOUR fault, isn't it?  Biden/Harris 2020  We'll only kill your kids if you're poor.
It’s very strange. She was a disaster in the primary after expecting to be a contender. And suddenly everyone is acting like this is some huge swing Biden’s way. If Biden wins it will have NOTHING to do with her
I mean he didn't get impeached. Cause he still has power and he's still the president. And I wouldn't be so sure about him not getting elected lol. Biden and Harris going to have their own hoops to jump through.
Hey, Dawn, did you see this? Holycrap 😮 nobody that's sane can deny that Biden is a full-blown racist.
You’re delusional! This suburban “housewife” is voting for Biden!
Looks like we will have a Glorious victory since the DemoCracks sealed the deal Trump winning due to Biden electing the evil cultist Kamela Harris as his Vice! #Trump2020 #MAGA2020 #KAG2020 #Patriot #Veteran…
Weaponizing religion: Trump's attacks on Biden's faith, calling him 'against God'
Nope, it was just a matter of being Hunter Biden...I can't imagine anyone else getting that treatment.
Voting third party is essentially voting for biden. A third party candidate is never going to win in our two party system. It's sickening
body language here- 1000% supportive of joe Biden?  lol
I agree 100% on that one...hate to be Captain Obvious, but I think he just thought because he was Joe Biden's son, he could do whatever he wanted, which is what he's used to.
This makes me think of that scene in Braveheart where William Wallace is saying to Robert the Bruce 'just lead them..."   The point being, these people (Kamala/Biden/Pelosi) are in positions of power and would be better off doing something good w/it.
The ugly visages of the promoters for Biden/Harris are so hateful. Their voices and speech patterns obnoxious.  These two demented and hater of America are what Dims/media/Rinos want.  A Godless Communist Government. Unbelievable
This is her saying... “I’m not going to outwardly support Trump, but I’m not above creating false statements against his opponents.” Don’t get me wrong, Harris AND Biden are Left... but not radical.
When Biden gets elected then pulls of his mask scooby doo style and reveals that he’s been Michelle Obama this entire time and then heals the entire world and wraps us in a tight hug with her ripped arms

You're in a heavily contested state with lots of electoral points, and LOTS of idiots. Biden absolutely sucks, but Trump is a fascist who doesn't believe climate change is real. Please vote for Biden
I completely agree with you on that. Both sides don’t have much to work with, but with that selection of VP I can’t go that way. Biden won’t last a full year and eventually she’ll take over and I’m not for that.
maybe they could put out a letter about what they'd do if Trump used sketchy FISA warrants and political appointees  to spy on Biden
Harris could not be president if Biden went down. Her parents were not citizens when she was born
The small govt card is not valid after federal troops invade and illegally detain citizens exercising their constitutional rights. Voting for Biden/Harris will ensure that every city doesn't become another Portland
I think black people are way smarter than Trump gives them credit for when he puts Kanye West on the ballots of a couple of swing states in order to draw votes away from Joe Biden. They surely must realize a Joke Vote will only come back to bite them in the ass.

The former primary rivals will appear at a high school near Biden's Delaware home to discuss their shared vision for how to defeat President Trump.
We’ll see if the people of CA will give her a vote or not.  If CA doesn’t turn red, then they deserve all that Biden/Harris have in store for them including higher taxes. So get out now and move if you want your vote to count.
you may not like biden or kamala and neither do i but there will be no chance for positive change again if trump wins and fills another supreme court seat this will do permanent damage you must vote for biden to save lgbt equality laws and roe v wade
I can't vote for someone who thinks trans women should be locked up with men. Hard stop. Biden had a large field of candidates he could pick from including Bernie which would have united the left and he chose a cop. At a time when defunding the police is a moderate popular stance

Joe Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate, making her the first Black woman on a major ticket  &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3
Yesterday Joe Biden, under pressure from the radical left, selected Kamala Harris as his running mate.  Not by the content of her character  but by the COLOR OF HER SKIN.  Not Martin Luther King's dream of "judging by content of character not by color of skin".
Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin will be the states I’m watching.  Trump-Pence or Biden-Harris will be determined by you.
At least Biden picked a VP he could stand behind. #Sorry #BidenHarris2020
The party leadership installs the nominee replacement.  The next highest delegate count replaces a presumptive.  Biden stepping down doesn't help Kamala.  Unless HRC is okay with someone else being the 1st female POTUS; it won't be Kamala.  Y'all are adding unnecessary steps.
Trump’s 2020 religious attack on Biden harks back to 1800
I think you're adding a step.   Convention ends, Biden steps down; HRC is announced as top of ticket.   Why do you think the party leadership installed Harris's staff for her before announcing her?  👀 Making sure she doesn't go rogue, like Trump did in 2016.

Come on, Biden has been a life long politician and now he will “fix” things. 😂 shouldn’t he have already been doing that? Harris a former prosecutor and AG who’s stance was tough on crime. Seems like a solid ticket to keep the Cheeto in office.
I am telling you, they will try to have Trump debate Harris. Basically be saying that Biden would tear him to pieces, so that Trump would have a chance, Biden will send in the Apprentice.  Jokes on him, Trump knows how to handle those too.
Really...suburban housewife? Lol! Just keep digging your grave with your cluelessness. Biden/Harris 2020!
Why? To fact check combat a post going viral on FB about Harris not being qualified for the office should anything happen to Biden, if elected, because her parents weren’t born in the US. 100% false. She was born in California and that’s the qualifying factor that matters. (2/2)
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. The dry dream and wet fart option on the 2020 ballot.
Biden said he would pick a woman
Let’s be honest. In 2016, HRC was the worst candidate in the history of candidates. Republicans couldn’t have that. Instead of learning a lesson, Democrats are now outdoing themselves with the Biden/Harris ticket. Blame yourselves. Hail to that red hat wearing 2-term booger.
Biden /Harris yes!
Her authoritarian policies preclude her from libertarian support. Did you know that you can be polite without sounding like you are on the Biden/Harris campaign team? You’ve abandoned your party, pandering to identity politics twice now. #MAGA2020 I guess.

Well he did say he was "only" 99% sure. At a time when many were assuming Biden had as much chance of nomination in '20 as Tromp did in '16.
My vote is going straight to Biden
And Biden is supposedly losing it? Try and read one of Trumps typical word vomits and make any sense of it.
Yes, this hypocritical communist is who Biden wants to "help run the country."
If Biden wins every state Hillary did (he will) and adds Michigan (99% chance he will), he only needs one more state and he’s President.

Go look at joe Biden’s too 75% donors. All coastal billionaires!!! I shit you not!
I hope Biden doesn’t put Kamala Harris in charge of Campaign Strategy, or they will run out of money two months before the election
Dude she believes what she said about him. Kamala has an agenda. Her agreeing to do VP on this ticket is bc she will become the next POTIS simply bc Joe Biden is 102 years old. A 95% chance she Harry S. Truman's this shit and succeeds in office. I kind of like her but dems reek.
like at this point, he could have chosen 4 possums in a trench coat as his fucking running mate and i would still smile all the way to the voting booth to vote for Biden. i do. not. care.

And I hope this isn’t interpreted as a “wasted vote” argument. I don’t think any type of voting is a waste. But I do think that Biden needs every vote he can get, and I think he is the candidate with the best chance to beat shitbird 45.

When I heard Biden chose Harris the debate was the first thing that came to mind. Pence is going to need mother to hold him after Kamala is through with him.  Regardless what you think of her she is a total badass during hearings.
Kamala Harris, Biden's running mate, spent career breaking barriers
A vote for Biden is a vote for Harris.
I agree.  A weak play from Biden.  But who else was there for him to loose with out there.
I don't trust Biden to not expand the airstrikes, but we're still militarily involved in all of those places, much to my dismay  Obama was still worse, but I'm still disappointed.
Reminding everyone of this gem of mine now that she’s Biden’s official Veep pick.
You fail to understand that a lot of people don't put 160K deaths on Trump  I really don't know what Biden would have done differently, and I haven't seen evidence that whatever that may be (Mask mandate) would have actually prevented the deaths  160K will be dead under Biden too
I don’t like Biden but I’ll chose him over Trump.
Biden isn't doing any of that.   He's alienating EVERY voting bloc.  Except donors &amp; apparatchik.  Donation data tells the tale.  Be glad he is in quarantine- or rally numbers would be painful. How are his state offices doing for volunteers?   Nah. #FeelTheMath
I love Biden uses a MacBook Air. Gets my vote  Then again I’d never vote for a fascist
The entire narrative about Biden being electable was laughable.   The right already has conservatives. They will (&amp; do) call the most far right D a "socialist".   That does cost votes. Right votes.   See the problem?
🤷🏾‍♂️   As a leftist, don’t care for her politics. I think she’s a good fit for Biden, but was hoping for Warren.  I am excited about Indian-American pols    who are much more progressive.  Some of my Indian-American friends are v excited, some feel like me.

Maya Rudolph reacts to Kamala Harris as Biden's VP pick, her SNL return
He's dancing to the same fiddle Biden will. Or whoever the D ends up being.
This is one reason it may be more advantageous than ever for a candidate to have his entire cabinet picked/announced during the campaign... make the campaign Biden+Kamala/Rice/Pete/Inslee et al vs. Trump+jr/Ivanka/Jared.
Joe Biden thinks Kamala Harris is the best person to run the country come January 2021.   Yes, you read that right.
He wrote the crime bill. He wrote the federal asset forfeiture  - the Biden/Thurmond bill. He's always been to the right of Reagan on policing. He promised to INCREASE their budget during Defund protests.  He gains nothing from adding her. It ain't about him.
Turning out Biden and Tromp voters is a path toward your "goal".
Not literally Biden’s behalf but him as the proxy for any white male with power being questioned by a black woman (ie Trumps form of himpathy lol
Wow, #CreepyJoeBiden has managed to upset the also ran other old white man! Maybe #SleepyJoe thought he would steal  s  fan base. Still sounds as logical as ANYTHING Biden has said all year! #Trump2020Landslide #ProLife #1A #2A #WalkAway
Biden Campaign Officials Donated Money to Group That Helped Bail Violent Criminals Out of Jail, Including a Serial Rapist and Accused Murderer  via
Pence doesn't believe those accusations about Trump, but Harris does believe them about Biden.  There's a pretty clear difference.
So many people just jonesing for a conspiracy. The bevy of armchair politicos using the VP pick to justify their nutty fucking suspicions is wide. From “I knew it was her because of how Biden sat 8 weeks ago” to “Tulsi Gabbard made this happen”   I’m tired y’all
And what did Kamala do to Biden about the bussing? One gamble paid off and the other didn’t.   Listen it’s unethical but it’s the game they play.
Biden Harris is backed by tech moguls and Wall St because they will preserve China sell out of our jobs and preferable tax codes for Wall Street . Wooops.  She called him a sex abuser and racist.  BLM . Open borders . Free health care for illegals ! High taxes . Fewer jobs !
Once again Trump wants to cut taxes for the upper 5%. Raise their taxes Joe.
In this case, when he said, "sleep," Biden actually meant taking a nap.
The die is cast, Biden - Harris ticket.  If, Biden wins he will serve until age 90 then step aside due to poor Health and the Dems have what they want a female President.  This has been the plot all along.
It’s either you can make a terrible voting choice or the worst voting choice. No inbetween. We had some amazing people up on the debate stage... I don’t know how we got here. I don’t even know anyone who voted for Biden. Wtf
Biden is said to be pleased that his pick for VP is you know... That lady from that place.

Biden thinks picking a person by their skin color and sex organs qualifies her .   Biden won’t last a full term. Harris covered up evidence in LA and let an innocent man go to prison for life . Put thousands in jail for grass then smoked it at home.  Even seems stoned on TV
Biden could’ve picked Nikkki Haley as his veep (ew, I just threw up a little in my mouth) and she’d be labeled ‘far left’ by a whole host of “pundits”.
I think the vice presidents scope of power is whatever the president allows, and biden aint going to stop her from anything.
2/ Now that Joe Biden has picked Kamala Harris, one thing that is certain: the enemy-making machines on the Right and Left have kicked in and are running full-bore. Watch how effective they will be in creating contempt in the Right and the Left.
1/ Discipleship to Christ: Biden/Harris and understanding the enemy/contempt-making machines of the world in the Right and Left.
Eww is joe Biden against Donald Trump
You are so intimidated by strong intelligent women. Kamala and Biden are going to eat your lunch! And then you're going to jail, fat boy!
She's too much of a cop that reveled in locking up Black men.  She and Biden have careers built on the crime war against Black America.
Watch SE Cupp's reaction to Biden's VP pick
Trump says he was surprised by Biden's pick
Kamala Harris, Biden's running mate, spent career breaking barriers
Elect Trump to a 2nd term?  That's a paddling.  Elect a Biden-Harris ticket.  Oh, you better believe that's a paddling.
Here's why Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris as his VP
I consider all this not worth paying attention too. It is all a distraction from the other side or just click bait. We all were waiting and very FEW had any issue with any Biden pick.
Biden choosing a cop for his VP candidate is a clear sign that the Democratic Party DOES NOT and WILL NOT listen to its constituents.
I would cite Harris' own campaign website but since she was chosen as Biden's VP the site links to his. Instead, I'll give you a link to a Reason article:
Trump machine is lying about this.
is this biden and harris’ america? omg 😍
I've seen a lot on Twitter basically denouncing Bernie for the immediate Kamala Harris support.  They understand that Biden and Kamala are part of the history of the corrupt justice system they hate.  Those that do vote will be gritting their teeth the whole way through.
i have to vote for joe biden and kamala harris i hate it here 😭
Death team for President. Biden Harris. Abortion  infanticide. Coming soon:  one child policy  forced sterilization  forced vaccinations forced euthanasia.  Godless society.
Block anyone saying they won't vote Biden based on Harris. They are bots or trolls.
#2020Election will be a shit show.. which smell do you prefer?  #KamalaHarris #Biden #Trump #Warren #Bernie
So,  are you voting for Biden/Harris this November?
biden’s pick for VP just proves we are moving deeper and deeper into a fascist police state and that “the people” can never truly win when our options, both A and B, are 1) chosen for us(DNC BS) and 2) blur party lines to give us a false sense of our freedom to vote.
I remember the day after Trump was elected. I was disconsolate. Being in Oklahoma, I'm surrounded by people who voted for Trump. I complained to my friend and he said, "Now you know how I felt when Obama was elected."  Well, this guy just said he's voting for Biden this year. 😮
Someone would always be salty with WHOEVER Biden picked, but let’s not take away the moment of the first black woman tapped to be Vice President. American history.
The Biden/Harris tag-team is going to face a "Rocky-like" Champion of the World . . .  #BidenBlow2020  .
Well Biden didn’t  pick a woman who was black. Kind of reminds me of Warren when she pretended to be Indian
What will Tammy do? Remain a Senator? Or...??? But, I'm still voting Biden/Harris 2020. Good enough for me, I think.
Of course she did. She cares nothing. Nothing for America. She panders. She lusts  for power. She is an empty empty soul like the demented racist Biden. She accepts his racism as she knows she will be President.  In her sick sick mind.
Yesss! Biden-Harris 2020!!
No, Biden is shitty on some policies and same for Harris. Those policies might not affect you and that’s why u probably won’t care but others care since it affect their lives. We are in shitty situation to choose between two horrible choices
You better vote this year. It’s Trump or Biden.
I’m sure Joe Biden didn’t know who his VP pick was until his wife told him
What about Biden’s corruption. Pay to play. Biden should be in jail.
The only thing historical about the Biden Harris ticket is for the first time in the history of the United States we have two open communists on the dem ticket. If they win there goes our Constitution and our livelihood
China will be thrilled if Biden wins.  Even Pelosi acknowledged that.  Russia is a pathetic country with 1/10th the GDP of China.  They aren't a legitimate threat like establishment dems have been squawking about for 4 straight years.
I was partial to Biden/Bass. Sounds like crappy fishing tournament.
It makes sense when replying to someone saying that Russia will be happy if Trump is elected.  Pelosi even said China wants Biden.  Who is a bigger threat?  China or Russia?  I think it's pretty obvious.  (Still voting third party, anyways)
I’m a realist.  It’s either Trump or Biden.  Why are you complaining about a VP pick?  Go vote in November. You still will need Iyanla to fix your life if you don’t go plan and work for your dreams. No politician is going to make that happen regardless who wins!
Trump has done more for Criminal Reform than Harris or Biden
Biden &amp; Harris are both pro-Zionist.  Trump is mucking up things- not pushing the agenda forward.  Adelson pulling his $ makes perfect sense.  He's probably part of the Lincoln Project.

I know some Bernie supporters who are extreme and/or uncompromising but the vast majority of them are not.  Over 80% of them are voting Biden according to most polls.  You’re just taking a few interactions from Twitter and projecting them onto a large demographic of people.

They are our ally but when Biden was VP he used $5M of US Money to bribe Ukraine to stop the investigation into Burisma and Hunter Biden.
If Biden and Kamala *both* withdraw before November, you'll know I'm onto something.
People have been dunking on Biden for the crime bill for years, what are you talking about?
Most of my mom's friends are voting Biden. Because they can't tolerate the President's brash personality. Her "Christian" friends. Biden/Harris are the strongest  abortion-supporting ticket in history.  The murder of innocent lives, and you're worried about his personality?
Same. I don’t think you’ll ever find a candidate like that however Biden/Harris is progressive as you’ll get.
You mean leadership when Biden threatened to withhold money if they investigated his son. You mean leadership when he used his office to get his son who was kicked out of the Navy for doing drugs.
I actually voted for Trump in ‘16 I’m ready for a change. Biden doesn’t check every box for me, but I personally think the country would be better served with him as president. I’m not asking you to agree I just started by trying to point out patriotic people can vote either way
Biden and Obama sold "American military troop security" to ANY country that would pay them and put American soldiers in harm's way.  THIS IS WHY the UKRAINE STORY is such A BIG STORY!  Biden will sell out again, that's his only form of diplomacy.
Biden didn't agree to take questions, until Nancy Pelosi tells him that it's OK for him to speak!
If Biden loses she needs to be bombarded with that video until it stings.
Why don’t they treat Biden and Harris like they do the President? And yell out gotcha questions,be Rude,Don’t respect,etc? President Trump answer puts up with their shit but still answers questions!You never saw that with Obuma because if they did he wouldn’t let back in?🤷🏼‍♂️🤥🤷🏼‍♂️
Vote for  is a vote for Iran, Ukraine, Chine &amp; Russia. A vote for Biden shows you support a racist and sexist.
Oh look another singer that thinks she can influence my vote.  thinks that Trump is dismantling the USPS. The USPS has lost $69B in the past 11 years. That started during the Obama/Biden administration. She is backing  who is a racist and sexist.
Biden doesn't know he is Joe Biden
You’re literally selling “harm reduction” with a straight face without one thing said about the harm Biden/Harris represents. Beg the question. Why do we have to settle for criminals like Biden at all without even making them earn your vote? Gaslighting like this.

Remember "Two weeks to flatten the curve?" Me too. That turned into 4 months which, If Biden had his way, would be mandatory masks for everyone who goes outdoors for the next 3 months. Perhaps Phil Johnson (like yours truly) is relatively resistant to government mind control.
At this point Biden could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I would still vote for him.
I’m voting for Biden because I love my county and cannot stand what Trump is doing to it

Good thing Biden's never been involved in any self-dealing or family enrichment scandals ever since he entered the state house in the early 70s or anything like that.

They played us like a fiddle &amp; Bejing Biden still has not caught on.
Who are "you people"?  I would have excitedly voted Democrat for Joe Kennedy III/Stacey Abrams.  Not another 4 years from an old, senile, washed up Biden-46 long years, ineffective political run from a man "who sells" US military protection to highest bidder (see Ukraine, NZ).
Joe Biden won’t last!!!  After if he makes it in  USA will find out he has dementia  or Alzheimer’s and the VP will take over!!!  SHOCKER!!!!!
The guy is a fraud. If any of these punks want respectful debate first they need to demonstrate independent thought and work to push Biden left. Anything less is gaslighting bullshit
Go with your feeling kn Biden and Harris. You won’t go wrong!
And the polls say Biden is leading by double digits. Come on, man!
But the people did, and when the people didn’t, don’t expect them to vote🤷‍♂️ Biden offers nothing to progressives, same for kamala.
Cut the harm reduction crap now. Pure right wing Dem talking points. It’s also disgusting because Biden could actually run on real harm reduction not this bullshit. AstroTurf

Biden appears to be in the early stages of dementia. That's why he doesn't answer any hard questions. So that means Harris will be the president with all her radical liberal ways.

I understand why they are talking about this, but there seems to be a narrative outside of the main purpose, readying Americans for Biden to give her the presidency.
If  and  win the election in November, I propose we #expiditetheinauguration.  #EvictTrump immediately after President Biden and Vice President Harris are confirmed the winners.
Old white man joe biden has been on the taxpayer dime for dang near 50 years.  #leech.
Biden might win Oklahoma if they get to “vote” like that
If dead people and pets can vote for Biden you can vote for Trump. Just get ahold of one of those mail in ballots. They’ll never check the post mark.
Agreed. I do think a lot of the Biden/Harris discourse should have run its course during the primaries. I understand that most of us aren’t happy the duo, but it’s to the point where we need to just accept the situation and start working with it.
Can someone give me one good reason to vote for Biden because I really have not heard one good reason to vote for him and because he’s not Trump is not a good answer ..
No. Wrong. Not sorry. I get you may not like Biden, and trust me he wasn't my first choice either. But we need to do every fucking thing we can to defeat Trump by the widest possible margin so choosing not to vote because you don't like Biden is irresponsible and stupid.
I know you know that but our friend doesn't seem to realize that. And according to his/her profile pic, voting for Biden is a non-starter.
Demand it, work towards it. But don't stop demanding for other things like M4A. Also don't not vote for Biden because he didn't meet a purity test.
I'm sure that if they'd support Biden you'd change your tune.  🤡🤡
Umm you can’t stop the mail Donnie! You are the reason why Biden gunna crush you in November #BidenHarrisLandslide2020

You know what would be better? People maximizing Biden's chances of winning by not fracturing the party with inflammatory rhetoric because he isn't pandering to each and every issue leftists want.
It doesn't matter what Biden commits to if he doesn't win. I think this election will be closer than you seem to think it will be. I figure anyone at all has maybe a 35-40% chance of beating Trump because of how they're gaming the system.
Biden was never my favorite. He wasn't even my second favorite. I just understand how big a deal this is, and I seem to have a better grasp on just how tenuous this situation is than you do.
I never said all the other problems disappear. But there is no problem at all that will be made better by Trump winning again. A great many problems will be made better by Biden winning, including this existential crisis we're in as a nation.
Fucking listen.  People took it for granted that Hillary would win in 2016 and so the attacks from the left were absolutely relentless. Learn from that.  The stakes are too high to fuck around.  Biden winning is very important. Him moving left? Not important at all by comparison.
Because you'd rather democracy literally be dismantled in America than Biden be President. Got it.
Because if Biden doesn't win, it very well could quite literally be the end of American democracy.

Maybe Kamal Harris figured out she was for Biden, and wasn't for trump, and that's what made her turn black?
NJ will be going for Biden Harris in a BIG way.
Your heart is huge &amp; Kamala is great! However, can a man/Biden w/ONLY 70% of his brain capacity REALLY lead the United States, as we explore new energies, fight new greed, hopefully gain immunity, continue to thwart China, keep Putin content, while educating ALL Americans? HONEST
I like brainless Biden
I support both you and Biden but, truth be told, we have had AT LEAST three and a half years to do those things and look where we’re at.
To start, a number of anonymously sourced quotes from Obama leaked out throughout the 2020 Biden campaign where the former president allegedly expressed doubts about his former running mates’ fitness for office.
Half the country would be unemployed in a Biden administration during a pandemic.
It sure does matter! At least Trump has done what he said he would. It’s not gonna affect SS. Unless all you watch is msnbc or cnn.  Biden has argued for cuts or freezes to SS for much of his 45 year career. What has he accomplished in all those years?
One of the worst run unions and organizations in America endorses Biden? Seems about right!
Cheaper to make there, hopefully the Chinese will prehack the machines to only vote Biden as revenge for the tariffs.
I mean you could argue most politicians are. Biden picking her IMO alienates his current radical base and fails to secure a sizable portion of mods playing the "law and order card" his party cant even denounce a terrorist group let alone prosecute rioters
After 51 Years in DC, If you think Joe Biden  is suddenly going to bring change. You are an Idiot!
I'm pretty sure I remember just a few days ago Biden on his bike zooming past a Fox news reporter.
Trump does a horrific job uniting all races, creeds &amp; religions. He's a scientific dolt. Yet, from his trade bills to his Middle East peace acts, to his opiate crackdown at US ports of entry, to his strong stance on China, to having 100%ok-90% brain capacity, he "trumps" Biden!
Non issue.  Israel/UAE is a huge issue and HUGE win for Trump!  Biden/Obama wussed out, delayed any peace talks, and have the blood of dead US soldiers on their wimpy hands-when they gave Iran 150 billion!!!!
It’s what they want. They know Biden can’t win, so they want away to delegitmize and cast “doubt” on the election.
Biden / Harris the faces of what basic bitches look like hahaha
I just stay away from all news and most social media, the world they show on a 24 hr loop is not the world I see outside my window. This will all be over right after the election, Biden wins it will disappear by Jan.1, Trump wins they will find something new to be mad about
If you unironically support Biden/Harris then you are definitely not a leftist lol
Joe biden however did say he wanted to defund social security
Kinda like the USPS Union endorsing Biden ??   Nothing suspicious there, right?
I guess we listen to opisite news sources and therefore get the bias we want. All i know is I am hearing reporters ask people and those people are stating Biden will not change dates or add a 4th.
You could be right, but local organizers are fighting quite an uphill battle against the two-party power structure. The fact that we’ve had only two parties worth anything for many decades now shows what a difficult process that is. Again, not saying I’m going against Biden
However I have to i will vote for Biden on nov.3rd. Mail, personally delivered,  cast a ballot in person.  Vote blue 💙!
He just needs to shut up and bring back Fauci and Burke. Did he send them to Siberia? We NEED their expertise not his BS. Biden doesn’t support wacko Qanon cult members to get their votes.
Not saying I’m not voting Biden, but let’s say my dream is one day the US is de-polarized like Germany or one of many other Euro countries with a true DemSocialist party and many diverse parties with diverse interests. How do I get there by voting Dem in perpetuity?
0 cap detected. Saw someone call biden a fascist, socialist, liberals, communist unironically
I’m glad to hear Biden won’t fall off the earth, it’s trump that I want to fall off the earth. Silly bot.
Legit If i had a nickel for every time I've had to explain to my moms friends that im an actual socialist and that biden isn't some radical communist and that he's more of a republican than anything I'd be so rich that i could give it to the poor
Not true I couldn’t stand your ass but decided to vote for you because I saw Hillary as corrupt. Joe Biden doesn’t have that problem. I’m voting joe and I’ve never voted dem for President. #byeDon
You are missing the point. Biden is the biggest hypocrite in politics. 47 years proves this.
What like funding HBC’s and making sure it’s 10 years instead of begging every year? Or creating opportunity zones in minoritie neighborhoods? Or signing first step act that allowed a lot of young black men that Biden and Clinton’s crime bill put in prison out of prison?

Consider, in the event they win, that she will very likely 'have' to replace Biden before his first year in office. He does not come across as a man who is mentally fit for the office  I truly believe a vote for Biden is really a vote for Kamala.

In her first two days as Joe Biden’s running mate, Kamala Harris has vouched for Biden’s character on race and more. And the enthusiasm surrounding her historic candidacy has brought in a record $48 million in 48 hours.

Bingo and many I think are ignorant on purpose. Some ive talked too truly believe Obama/Biden left Trump with nothing to fight virus. They're dumb
I can’t wait until you and Biden are in the White House.
Once again, any attacks against him reduce his chances against Trump. I guess you'd rather have Trump as President?  If it were a less odious opponent, fine. But it's Trump. And yes, hurting Biden helps Trump.
I'm just going to quote this on every Joe Biden tweet from now until the election.
I love hearing Kamala Harris talk about the plan that Elizabeth Warren wrote for Joe Biden.

So why are the press not allowed to ask questions at the Harris/Biden events?
Def don’t think Biden has the charisma of say, an Obama or a Reagan or even Trump. Putting him out there like this feels like being served re-heated leftovers. I don’t think he has the ability or the desire to gain the same kind of religious devotion as is given to 44 and 45
oh yeah that is kamala harris’ proposal that you just sent i was referring to biden’s. not like any of this matters anyway biden’s ass ain’t gonna get elected 😂
To me it looks like a lot of the enthusiasm for Biden is wishful thinking, like “Well, let’s make the most of this and give him our full support,” gaslighting themselves until they believe he’s amazing, while a large chunk of Trump supporters seem to borderline worship him.
You look like a bot. Are you a bot?
At this point Biden could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I would still vote for him.

Biden is elected.  Biden dies.  Token brown female VP assumes office.  Police state becomes worse under her reign.  Laugh.
When will they get rid of Biden? Predictions? 👇🏽 who are they swapping him with?
Listen, Biden and Harris are not perfect. They have issues with their past that they will need to deal with and make changes, but to say that because they aren't perfect, you should sit one out and let the current President get re-elected? Go fuck yourself.  Vote his ass out.
That Biden, Kamala doc signing was infamous!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
In no way, shape, or form do i think Biden is a good candidate but i think this is very misleading. His tax plan is actually fairly realistic IMO and are targeted at people making over $400,000 (the 1%). And I do support the increase of the capital gains tax.
I guess since Biden and Kamala have been putting away more blacks in prisons than ever before, BLM won’t be voting for them? If they have ANY common sense
This woman to all my Christian friends around the world SHE TORE THE BIBLE IN HALF and threw it on the floor!!!!!!  Anyone calling themselves a Christian that votes for her them. Biden was there!!!  Stated they don’t believe and Trumps family does!!!!!!!!
these are our choices. Absolutely fucking hate it. But we can survive a Biden presidency. We can elect other progressive candidates down the ballot. We can apply leftward pressure to Biden and still have a functioning country at the end. 4 more years of 45 will destroy us. (2/2)
What our President is trying to do is called Fascism. So whatever problems you have with the Biden/Harris candidacy shut your fucking mouth and vote against fascism!! #BidenHarris2020
Exactly this. A Biden/Harris ticket isn't perfect, and in fact there are def some legit concerns... but in the absence of a perfect candidate, I'd rather have the imperfect one that'll still at least push some liberal policies over the man who's actively trying to destroy America
If the democrats had any integrity, which they lack, they’d realize this disqualifies Joe Biden from being president by their own admission.
Vote for Biden/Harris cause we have more of a survival chance with them even if it’s still scary and with them we maybe will still have a victory 8 years down the road.
Raymond Arroyo: Is Kamala Harris Biden's shadow president?  via
I think the issue is that it ONLY resonates with people in the Fox News bubble. Joe Biden isn’t nearly as reviled by the general public as Hillary was. Calling Joe “far left” only works on those who would’ve never voted for him anyway.
Honestly, I would buy the rhetoric, but it failed last time. And paying more attention this time, the dnc will continue to do everything in its power to disenfranchise progressives. I can't not vote for Biden, but it's hard for me to be too upset with people that won't.
Watching my friends who grew up raving, are pro marijuana, and support BLM and defund the police now try to do mental gymnastics to justify supporting Biden and Harris makes me very sad. Just another example that logical consistency is dead in America.
THREADCEPTION  But no, seriously, there's some really important points made here and I'm guilty of doing it myself. I have legitimate concerns about some policies that a Biden/Harris ticket might advance... but they'd honestly still be far, far better than 4 more years of 45.
Mika supporting a proven racist and sexual predator in
Can't wait for Biden to win and people to remember dems suck too.
Sadly yes. A vote for anyone other than Trump or Biden is a "wasted vote" &amp; would be viewed as "helping Trump".
Their polls also show Biden leading President Trump.
We just had a poll showing Biden +3. Somebody is *wrong* by a lot. My guess, this one.

Please don't self-harm.  I'll also note this suggests you are in California.  If so, those electoral votes are already in the Biden/Harris Drug Warrior column.  So it would not just be self-harm, it's of no practical consequence to beat Trump.

Yep, this is one scenario/mindset I was worried about. I'd rather the nominees be Trump and Biden. I've dealt with Trump for 1,301 days. At this point, I can deal with him another 159. If he wins, then impeach him.
But that’s not a good thing to say. I get it. But it’s relinquishing your vote. It’s not holding anyone accountable. People should still be telling Biden he has to earn your vote.

Too many what ifs. I'd rather just see the election proceed as it is. That's just me though. Why spend energy on an impeachment when they could spend energy on getting Biden elected?

Biden/Harris are for heavy regulation (for climate change), wealth redistribution (heavy taxation aka "economic justice"), globalization (trade agreements that send jobs overseas), continued class warfare, and bailouts for Democratic Party controlled states.
Biden/Harris have been in government for 30+ years. They are part of THE SWAMP. Both of them have enjoyed political power, opulence, and the status their position has given them. During Harris' 30 years public service, and Biden's 44+ years, what actually improved?

Like, Obama and Biden did a great job with the recession we were dealt with and got us out of the gutter. Trump enabled business expansive policies to keep our economy rolling and expanding where it could have easily contracted. Both can be true

Bring honesty, class, compassion, and dignity back to the White House!  Vote #BidenHarris
Shouldn't Biden do that?
Maybe Hunter Biden is hiding in Kamala Harris basement 😂😂😂
Not even the pope will help Biden get elected.
Someone is afraid the man Biden can’t debate. We all know Biden is an idiot
I'm not voting for kanye. I was left with no choice in this matter and yes Biden was and is an idiot but at least he's 100% better than that nazi monster.
Hopefully not from the same place as the innocent people she blocked DNA testing against so she could keep her conviction rate up. I’m no trump fan but in the debates, trump will embarrass Biden and Pence will call out her keeping innocent black people in prison
Don’t get on my page slamming Joe Biden anymore because I will block you I’m pissed at Donald Trump he can go fuck hisself I need to be taken care of and every person in my predicament needed to be taken care of he failed me and thousands of others in the United States I’m done
Watch Biden during Thomas’ Confirmation Hearings. Pays Hill to lie, then dumps on her! Dems are a crock of snakes - always have been!
Giuliani has been quiet for so long you know he's up to no good, doing tRumps bidding. And, yes, they've probably found some miniscule issue with Biden that they've created &amp; manipulated into some great HOAX to defame his character &amp; integrity.   WE THE PEOPLE WILL NOT BE BAITED.
Herman Cain upon hearing Biden's VP pick:
I have literally hated Biden after what he pulled at the Confirmation Hearing for Justice Clarence Thomas. He dug up Anita Hill then dumped on her as well.  A loud-mouth, liar, thief. One term would have been one term too many! Shameful!
Biden and Harris will not be the  best thing for our country just the opposite. If you want to lose your freedom and be controlled by government you will not like what happens. I hope people will wake up before it to late. Our country survival depends on it. That's a fact.
Kamala Harris will be the one in charge not Biden. We will lose our freedom and everything will be control by the government. Do you really want the most dishonest two people running  our country? God help our country and the people. This country will be no more!!!
Fuck Joe Biden
Man,  has their "spin team" working overtime tonight. You're gonna have to do better than this to make America forget what a joke the Biden campaign is.

I do and Clinton never had the kind of lead Biden has not even close.
Biden Ravine
I can’t get over the fact that his team posted about “continuing his important work” and then immediately tweeted about the Biden campaign being “nuts...”
wasn’t she just blasting Biden not too long ago, even calling him racist?
The TRUMP "freight train over BIDEN" DEBATES WILL DESTROY what remains of Biden's frail psyche!!!
Biden/Harris 2020!!! America has had enough of trump and pence!! I know when the lord is sending us a signal!
Kamala is a horrible choice-if the goal is to garner 4 million more black votes-as she IS NOT a black voters black person.  Her DA record proves she's anti-black!!!!  Should scrap both Bedridden Biden and Harris; change ticket to Kennedy III/Abrams!!!
Biden should’ve picked Michelle 🥺
Why aren’t we hearing more about Comey, Clinton, Biden(Ukraine) no one cares about Kamala Devils! We all Know she is evil and  allows babies to be killed ( probably has designer shoes and purses made out of them)
Biden is in the White House for 4-8 years, another Trump Supreme Court pick will be on the bench for 30+. What is so hard to figure out about this. You will NEVER get MFA if we have a conservative majority Supreme Court.
Biden doesn’t know here from there. If anyone thinks he’s really gonna be the man pulling the strings if he gets elected they have no idea. Someone else is gonna be telling him everything to say as do. He’s just a puppet.
To be fair, Biden made up his mind about having a black woman as a running mate before any other qualification. He’s supposed to be a leader. So we hold regular Joes to a higher standard than a presidential candidate?
Biden/Harris of course!
Trumpturd and Mikey have nothing for Biden and Harris.
Ask isis how President Trump coddled them? U know sleepy Joe Biden the Terrorist u and ur buddy Obuma let build up a caliphate and let it keep expanding!🦅🤠🇺🇸

As usual it was full of repetitive nonsense, fear mongering, and promises he can’t keep. Watching that train wreck shortly after the Biden/Harris conference, how can there be an argument about which candidate is fit for the office of POTUS? #TrumpIsNotWell
Just to read "pool report" regarding Biden is SO refreshing!!!!
What in the world? This was clearly not written by Joe Biden.
Biden’s biggest supporter
Kamala Harris Fact of the Day:  Should the Biden-Harris ticket prevail, Kamala, 5’ 2”, would measure as the shortest Vice President ever (by 4 inches).  Shortest VPOTUS 5’ 6” Aaron Burr &amp; Martin Van Boren  Shortest POTUS 5’ 4” James Madison
I'm down to 1  ,,,  My dad  and in our last conversation, he asked if 'not voting Biden is a problem'  *headdesk
So is this how politics work now? Kamala says she believes Biden’s accusers just a few months ago.... and now we ignore all of that because it was just something you say to win? I hate it all. We need better choices.
So what will you be calling Joe Biden? He used the exact same pronunciation that Tucker did.  Or are you a total hypocrite?   And in case you missed it, Tucker was mocking the stridency of the critique, so if you don't take Biden to task with the same vehemency, hypocrite it is.
Biden really said “Man, people don’t want to vote for me? Watch this drive” and shit himself in the foot with his VP choice pushing even more people away from voting for him 🥴🥴
It turns out that  pronounced Kamala EXACTLY THE SAME as Joe Biden did. Now are you going to go off on Joe with the same vehemence. I doubt it. Hypocrite.
At this point Biden could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I would still vote for him.
I don’t think Joe Biden will last 4 months in office, before he’s sent to happy acres!
justify voting for biden knowing that Commie-Law filibustered votes to protect babies who survive abortions &amp; she supports late term abortion up to the head crowning. C'MON MAN!   #BLEXIT #KAG #KAGA2020 #MAGA #WalkAwayFromDemocrats #JoeBidenIsARacist #WalkAway
Gasses citizens? Boy talk about lacking context.  You're completely blind to the absurdities of Biden and Harris. Trump isn't close to being a dictator.
I don't understand how you can't see the problems with Biden and Harris. Are you just blind to the problems they have?
Weekend at Bernie’s is in for a longer run than Biden
At this point Biden could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I would still vote for him.

Joe Biden mispronounced his VP's name. Boy this guy's a winner. Come on man!
Yea I know!! Me neither too! There are theories that biden intends to step down if he is elected to allow Harris to take over.
If Trump  is re-elected he is going disassemble Social Security in January of 2021. Why would you do this? Are you insane? Your a lunatic &amp; the people need to vote this Narcissist out of office. So he can’t tell any more lies. VP Biden  help us. Please.
Joe Biden couldn’t come up with the stream if he had to
That website literally just trashes the green new deal, while trying to pretend that Biden has proposed something that's the same thing.
Signs Across America--OK for Biden/Harris -
Get a Biden-Harris flag.
Has he been hired to work on Biden's campaign now? Crazy state of things!
Really? Biden is Catholic in name only.  Pro-Abortion with a Anti Catholic VP pick.  I am not impressed by this AD.
Biden doesn't say anything because his handlers don't want him to accidentally say the opposite of what's on the cue cards.

I’m not voting for Joe Biden
i was only clarifying for those who are not energy players. who routinely heard biden and now trump take credit. love the cartoon!
That’s promising. Saw one sign of Joe Biden during the Primaries in West Texas
That is so true...   V.P. Biden this is who we want replaced in November! A lying buffoon, who is a narcissist &amp; lunatic. Help our country.
Neither did Stalin or Hitler. She is a known Socialist. Sooo is Biden have the same Socialist values?!!!
Are u insane? Kamala Harris repeatedly went to great lengths to BLOCK DNA testing on innocent people just to keep her conviction rate up. She went after Biden for sexual assault allegations... now you’re going to vote for them? Makes sense
Graham is deep state and running the clock hoping for a Biden victory
Hey Eric how about when she kept a innocent man in jail by knowingly witholding evidence that would free him. R his constiuency ready death camps. With Biden that’s next because his running mate is a KNOWN Socialist!!!
Wonder why Biden and affiliates are supporting Trump???? Weird but they can keep their support. #Trump2020
Nope. Hasn't been catholic in a long time. Just look at his voting record. If you are Catholic and you think Biden is please seek help. Talk to your spiritual director.
The DNC invited Kasich, did not invite Julián, and only gave AOC 60 seconds to speak. This is not the time to piss off an entire wing of your own party that you need to win down ballot races. Of course I’ll vote for Biden but gah dammit we deserve better!

True. I’m not a trump supporter but Biden was the Vice President for 8 years. If he knew how to fix things, why didn’t he tell Obama?
Just heard Biden just raised a record breaking 30 million....🤔 this and the BLM funding ActBlue which is basically the Democrats.... well let’s just say it’s clear the Democrats are funded by more then one terrorist organization ... 🤬
How Biden rode into VP Office on the coattail of Obama is suspect - he didn’t lend a thing to the campaign. He was disliked by his party!  Perhaps he learned Blackmailing #101 skills from the Clintons and will pass them on to his VEEP choice, as if the bitch needs advice on vice!
always appreciate your viewpoint. Concerning Biden as a baby boomer, he was born in 1942, one of the late Silent Generation. Boomers started the next year. Biden would be the first of his generation to be elected President, the only one never to elect a Pres.
Biden, Harris to make unusual campaign debut in virus era
Did theybsay anything yet about Biden doing the same.
I don’t want to hear what you think about Kamala Harris as the VP pick. I think she’s a great choice. At this point, I would vote for Biden if Steven Seagal was his running mate.
These Biden/Trump debates are going to look like two old men argueing over what channel to watch in a nursing home.
Actually, by not voting for Trump I’m helping Biden get elected
The reason for it is Brets boy Biden and bidens ho had some kinda train wreck confrence or whatever and bret leaked his biden underwear ready to talk about how much biden means to him and blah blah blah. Bret just needs to come out and say it he os riden with biden
I am so excited for the combination of Biden/Harris to make America great again!
Biden’s Cognative Decline™️ is really something to see.
Not for me! I will never ever have those thieves and liars for my POTUS! HOW EMBARRASSING CAN THOSE TWO BE? BIDEN HARRIS &amp; JOKE FOR 2.
People are concerned about me getting my babies ears pierced but are gonna vote for Biden and Trump knowing damn well they’re both PEDOS🤣 Sit down and worry about the other children in the world and not my well taken care of children🤨

So is Biden still a racist? Does Harris still believe Biden's rape accuser?  Doesn't matter either way, she's a hypocrite with no principals.

Now do Biden.

Biden will soon step aside and the DEM ticket will be SANDERS/HARRIS - a Marxist DREAM TEAM!
WRONG.  KAMALA IS NOT a black voter's black candidate.  Biden will lose and drag her down, too.  Too bad, as Joe Kennedy III can beat Trump!
If Biden becomes president our world will change dramatically and we will go into a recession like you’ve never seen . Everything about him is bullshit here’s proof   .......it goes to his website ......god help us ....Trump 2020
"Joe Biden and Kamala Harris introduce their presidential ticket in Delaware"
Joe Biden wants to make this law if he wins. No thanks. He cannot be allowed to win. It will destroy whatever small businesses are still around assuming we aren't forced into another economy killing lockdown.
I found it fascinating that 6 months ago she implied that Biden was a racist and a sexual predator and now she’s his running mate. I also thought that using his dead son to make points was really tacky.
Democrat October Surprise: Biden suffers medical calamity.  Harris picks Hillary as running mate.
The U.S. is in the middle of a perfect storm: COVID-19, murders, the fight for civil rights and justice, birthing the era of the BLM movement with the greater plague-the Trump Admin. All of this: Still, we will rise; we will recover. A strategic God w/Biden &amp; Harris leading US.
Biden/Harris ROASTED trump and VP Penis.
Yes, I was watching that Harris speech on Fox, bc the late afternoon on Fox News is my favorite cable news. Not as much since Sheppard got ousted, but still. Chris Wallace &amp; Neil Cavuto were on before they went to the Biden announcement
Oh no. Heaven help us. &lt;reaches for voting lever&gt; That would be terrible. Please save me. &lt;throws handle for Biden and Harris so hard the resultant devastation can be seen fromnspace&gt;
The facial expression from Biden makes it evident that he is so damn proud of his VP choice.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris introduce their presidential ticket in Delaware
Yehhhh Kamala: V.P Elect. Thank you Joe Biden for your pic; a sweet strategic move. May God bless you both and these United States of America as we journey down the road to recovery. It will take time but we will get there; we will recover.
"Harris is a trailblazer, and her leadership will move our country forward. The Democratic Party couldn’t be more excited for her to join the ticket,” said Oklahoma Democratic Party Chairwoman, Alicia Andrews.
Watching Biden Harris makes me proud gives me chills, gives me hope makes me happy
My two cents... Biden/Heiress 20 is joke..how the hell does they not say anything about condemning the  riots,rioters? It’s their followers burning down the cities!!!  wins in a landslide over these two communists
Yehhhh Kamala: V.P Elect. Thank you Joe Biden for your pic; a sweet strategic move. May God bless you both and these United States of America as we are on the road to healing. It will take time but we will get there; we will heal.
He is so hard to watch. You Biden supporters have lost your mind.
Hes not my first choice either but I'm ridin with Biden now.  Blue down the ticket.
Fun Thing That Happened: a bunch of leading experts did a DnD-style war game to see all the possible outcomes of the Nov election. They found that unless Biden wins an overwhelming victory, in every possible scenario there will be mass unrest and no peaceful transfer of power...

Could I ask you why you think voting for Biden is a more logical alternative than voting for Jo?
LOL, he won't have to try that hard to show Biden's racism, Biden does a good job of that by himself.
if you have a t-shirt for your campaign, get someone or several down to the high school wgere Biden is rolling out with Kamala. That man Lee Murphy has a lady standing in the camera shot with his website  pretty tacky on JOE'S rollout, but it's
Joe Biden couldn't tell you what the Second Amendment is without reading off a teleprompter, and even then he would still probably fumble his words
Joe Biden heard ya.
Lmao on this post.  Do you see the shape basement Biden is in?  He can’t even talk.  Good luck
Biden is Catholic!
Not going to lie and say it's my first choice. But in 2020, expectations/reality aren't the same. I will vote for Biden&amp;Harris, and I will push others to do the same. Not because I'm a #1 fan, but because other people deserve basic liberties. My selfishness doesn't come first.
That's one reason why I'm voting for Biden.
For those refusing to vote because a Biden/Harris ticket wasn't your first choice, just remember that there are others  voting because their life depends on it. So if you value "progress" more than human life, do us all a favor and STFU if trump wins again while you did nothing.
This is EXACTLY how I feel. Sick about it, but I will cast my vote for Biden/Harris
Imagine thinking a Biden/Harris ticket represents the “radical left” lol
Do you know what time the Biden/Harris  event is? I need to run to my doctor for a Med but don’t wanna miss it
No one wants bobble head VP Penis except for VP Penis wife.
So Trump seems completely blown away that Biden chose a candidate who might outshine him. He seems to think that the main criteria for a V.P. is someone who will hide behind your shadow and prop you up and kiss your ass when necessary.  Mike Pence totally agreed.
Joe Biden will either be unfit and Harris will step in as president. And polosi would be vp. This is there plan.
Biden - Harris = pro-abortion, both have a deep history of poor performance on prison and judicial reform, both favor pushing the democratic party further left.
At this point Biden could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I would still vote for him.
Okay so I saw this being tossed around yesterday. Is it legal for Biden to announce his cabinet before winning the election? Some said "yay" with others saying "nay"?
Trump is a total idiot.  Biden is in a coma state.  I'll take idiot over incompetent anyday.....work with a few situations like this at my 2 Oklahoma Universities, too
can’t wait for them to lose and liberals to blame it on Biden-Harris being “too progressive”  Why the DNC is only going after “moderate voters” instead of activating what should be their base is beyond me.
I'm part of a National Coaching Coalition and have maybe 70,000 black friends- who ALL KNOW that Kamala Harris is 'WHITE"!  Sorry, but she would have been a good VP choice in 2024 with Joe Kennedy III, but now she's sunk with Biden
The college kids voting for Biden are gonna be like, fuck yeah I’m dumb as fuck. Guilty as simp.
She endorsed Biden. Months ago.
Jamaican-Asian-American to be accurate. But she's still not VP material and Biden isn't competent enough to be Prez either. Killary's already had her 2 terms (we all know she was Prez when Slick Willie had the title).
Is that why we have to choose between Biden and trump?
Also do you believe Joe Biden is still alive?
I just think it’s fucked up as a woman to live in a country where you worry about the safety of Kamala Harris working with Joe Biden
Whites have no chance garnering enough votes to elect Biden/Harris. And, as Kamala IS NOT A BLACK PERSON'S BLACK, black voters will NOT waste time to even vote.  I have sent this to over 1 million eligible black voters in 1 day/will send to 20 million more

That's not Joe Biden.
The Biden campaign has said it plans a rollout that blends the historic nature of Harris' selection with the realities of the 2020 campaign and the gravity of the nation's circumstances.
Also, does 45 have to send his personal army to your city again to remind you of the existential threat that he is!? You guys sound ignorant trying to find reasons to not vote for Biden/Harris. I swear, uninformed, fake woke people are the worst. 🤦🏾‍♂️

BBC News - Kamala Harris VP pick: How she could help - or hurt - Joe Biden
Oklahoma.   No worries here.  Biden will, guaranteed, go 0-77 counties.
Ok man, if you think that Biden has a sudden change of heart in the last four years and isn’t just committed to the same neoliberal garbage that he always has been then that’s no skin off my nose
President Trump said Joe Biden running mate Kamala Harris was "nasty" and "disrespectful" to Biden, offering his first reaction to Biden's pick of Harris.
If Biden was serious he’d pack the court, but he won’t 4. Again, doubt it 5. ACA is garbage anyways, M4A is the only viable healthcare plan and Biden isn’t touching it with a 10 foot pole 6. Doubt it 7. He has attempted several times over his career to slash SS
It's so fascinating how extreme everyone's take is on Kamala Harris.  Either Biden doomed us all, or she's our gallant savior come to slay the white male dragons of the established GOP order.  I do see the confusion
And Joe Biden still doesn’t know what state he’s in
Shows what kind of "Catholic " Biden is.  Pro-Abortion with a Anti-Catholic VP pick.
But getting rid of Trump is utterly pointless if we’re replacing him with Joe fucking Biden. It’s useless. It doesn’t matter.
and Joe Biden every step of the way if they are elected. We must fight against this liberal insanity, reelect  and replace Kendra Horn with a conservative voice for the 5th district.
It should come as no surprise that the swamp has selected socialist Democrat Kamala Harris as Joe Biden's running mate. She supports gun confiscation, free health care for illegals, and radical environmentalist policies.  Make no mistake, Kendra Horn will stand with Kamala Harris
Neither Biden nor Kamala was my first pick, but I’ll take them over Cheeto Face any day
Biden’s gun tax policy is a joke and unfairly targets poor gun owners.

People think I’m defending Trump , I’m not. I dislyKalama, Biden and Trump all for different reasons
Republican attack ads make Joe Biden sound so much cooler than he actually is.
But Biden isn’t going to do anything to roll back any of Trump’s shit, and he’s just gonna be a repeat of the Obama presidency and give us someone even worse than Trump after. Biden doesn’t offer a viable alternative to Trump. This election is pointless
I get it. A vote for Biden means one vote less for Trump. I do not want another 4 years under a Trump Presidency. But you CANNOT ignore what these politicians are doing just because they aren't Trump
I am a suburban housewife &amp; I will not be voting for a racist buffoon &amp; narcissist that you are. It is time for a real man like Joe Biden   step into the office of President &amp;  Kamala Harris  along at his side!  That will make America great again!  NOT YOU!
I'm optimistic actually. Biden is personally pretty moderate, but his platform will be the most progressive in American history.  More than anything, I'm looking forward to having a cabinet of people who are even vaguely qualified.
Not going to happen...Biden is not much better than Hillary and we all know what happened there 🤷🏻‍♂️

I’m seeing a lot of Trumpies attacking progressives for supporting Biden/Harris now when they didnt in the primaries. I think the main difference is that we’re voting for someone terrible bc we have to, they’re voting for someone terrible bc he’s exactly what they want.
Hey Chip, what happened to the Biden accusers that Camilla Harris believed
If biden and harris are radical socialists trunp and pence are the antichrist and Hitler. #TwoCanPlayThatGame
Biden was a part of the Obama administration.  So, in reality, Biden HAS put them in cages   Also you should research his VP pick, as far as putting people in cages.  Congratulations, i wasted about a minute writing this in response to an obvious bot account
My thoughts...I don't want 4 more years of Trump. He could have named anyone vice president and I wouldn't notice. Still voting for Biden.
She’s not my first choice either but I’ll take her and Biden any day over trump. No one candidate is perfect, they all come with baggage but trump’s  baggage is on a whole other level. We can’t afford 4 more years of trump, literally and figuratively.
Chomsky is still on board with voting for Biden after he chose Harris as his VP
Is Harold also Biden’s son? Follow the money. Hunter and Harold should both be in jail
oh well im not voting because biden sucks just as bad as Trump does
You quiet AF About that charity thing huh? Y’all bring up Hunter Biden religiously but can’t seem to muster up Trumps son stealing money from kids with cancer. Weird.

Criticizing Kamala’s policy don’t make you anti black or anti woman. Same way I get off criticism for Trump, Biden, Obama etc she gon get it too.
Bold of you to assume Biden cares about kids in cages
Joe Biden isn’t going in the direction I want
Excuse me Bishop! Biden is a long time devoted catholic, his faith is everything! You sir might want to re read your bible, cause Trump ain’t cutting it
8 years of Obama/Biden and not a single Democrat came for a single gun anywhere. Go clean your own house first.
Does this mean that Biden is less racist / sexist than the guy who picked him to be his VP?
She’s publicly slandered Biden on many occasions and believes his accusers lol😂😂
If the Election War game they ran tells us anything, they’re going to protest the election results, Biden I’ll step down and the electors will try to give it to Kamala.  They’ll hold an inauguration in California and try to see what the Military does
If the country belongs to all of us, does that mean you and Biden will change these outdated, barbaric man made laws? Freedom is what the people want. We want to self determine and not be told what to do or how to live our lives. We want to be able to live in #Peace
The soul of this nation has been tried and found guilty of its transgressions. Every individual soul desires to be free. Can you or Biden free the people? All Power to the People!! #BlackPantherParty #endpoliceharassment #DefundThePolice #ChangeTheLaws #Peace #Allahuakhbar

Biden's VP is twice the man yours is  and 3 times the man you are...
Biden's VP is twice the man yours is   and 3 times the man you are......
When the alternative is someone who is a complete anathema to progressive values in an authoritarian right wing nationalist like Trump I imagine these people will hold their nose to vote for the Biden/Harris ticket regardless.
Biden's VP is twice the man yours is   and 3 times the man you are...
Biden's VP is twice the man yours is  and 3 times the man you are...
Biden VP is twice the man yours is and 3 times the man you are...
Trump is so appalling though that many of these people will hold their nose and vote for Biden and Harris anyway because the priority is to get rid of Trump.
She prosecuted the black and brown people that Biden’s law targeted. Very easy choice for him.
Why is Biden Harris 2020 account suspended?
Seeing a lot of people saying they’re not voting bc of the dem. candidate. If Biden is the democratic candidate then vote Biden! Don’t get to thinking your vote doesn’t count bc a nonexistent vote from you is a vote for trump.
Joe Biden has been nothing but spend his life getting rich off the American people he has accomplished absolutely nothing even if he had his mental stability is too far gone now
General. This whole movement started with police brutality. Then dementia ridden biden thinks its a great ides to make his vp a former cop. Peopke have a right to be outraged and say fuck the
The “Biden should have picked Tulsi” crowd might be the funniest three people on Twitter.
So were all in agreement right? Biden just betrayed the ENTIRE leftist movement and what we stood for? Were all agreed were saying fuck biden vote 3rd part and burn everything to the ground?
Reps were winning based on being tough on crime, to compete Dems had to become tough on crime. If crime wasn’t a problem already, the argument wouldn’t have been necessary. But miss me with the argument Biden put folks in prison, no criminals put themselves in prison. 1 of 100.
Biden chose a cop ad VP when all this shit started with cop brutality. Burn this goddamn system to the ground
I was going to vote biden cause we dont have the numbers for third party but this whole thing started with police brutality. Im not about to let a former cop whos known for high non violent incarceration become VP. Burn this fucker to the ground
That's about as big of a surprise as Joe Biden sniffing an 8 year old's hair.
Kamala Harris has done more to hurt People of Color since Joe Biden helped write the 1994 Crime Bill  Good thing they’re not on the same ticket...oh wait #VoteGold
#GeriatricJoe Biden as predicted picks black female senator as VP running mate. 2nd prediction: #GeriatricJoe when elected will shortly become unfit &amp; stand down in favour of said VP giving Democrats the first woman #POTUS &amp; the first BLACK woman #POTUS #transparent #woke #left
NEW: FiveThirtyEight data released this morning shows Biden favored to win the election. They simulated the election 40,000 times.
I walk a bit of a line here because I am a lefty by inclination and a pragmatist strategically; I don't like the Biden/Harris ticket, I think it is very far from where we need to be as a country, but the struggle to move us to the left is a cultural struggle first and foremost.
I told my husband it feels much like when Barack chose Joe Biden. A lot hope!!
Maybe Biden and Kampala can debate now. 😂
I don't have a party. And its messiah sure as hell isn't Joe Biden (Bernie Sanders, if anyone).   Ease back some there, edgelord.
I am voting early. Why wait til November? Vote Biden in ASAP!
When even Noam Chomsky is imploring people to vote for Biden...
Biden vs Trump better happen though. God owes us.
was forced to pick  for his VP by 100 ANGRY BLACK MEN! They sent Biden a letter threatening him if he did not pick a BLACK WOMAN for his VP he would lose all the BLACK VOTES.  is a COWARD! He can't think or do anything on his own!
Biden has spent more time telling people to not vote for him when they ask him what the holy fuck his actual platform is beyond “I’m not Trump” than he has spent actually coming up with a fucking platform. You are not owed votes.
He has an entire website where you can read it. But that isn't the point. We express it in terms of Trump to impress upon thick-headed individuals the criticality of backing Biden even if his politics/platforms aren't 100% what you want. Trump is indeed that much of a threat.
Okay. But Trump or Biden will be President. Must be nice to be in a good enough position to have the luxury of not caring which wins.
The debates are going to be hilarious. Biden will get asked the really tough questions, like what state he’s in and he won’t have a clue 🤣🤣🤣
Look at the bright side, Biden has been in politics for over 30 years and he doesn’t even know it 🤣🤣🤣
My opinion is Biden was forced to pick Harris by 100 BLACK ANGRY MEN they sent a letter to Biden threatening to take all BLACK votes from him. They also know that Biden won't live long enough so Harris will become president. VERY SCARY TIMES NOW!
Sheehan has a pretty brilliant analysis here, of Biden/Harris from a couple of weeks ago, reversing the DNC lurch to the right, how AOC will become a threat from the Left for 2024, and passing a Green New Deal. He thinks Obama should be Sec. of State.
Uhhh George I usually love you but WTF, Medicare for all and Green New Deal are NOT supported by the Biden ticket...
An ANT could pick Joe Biden up!
So you’re not going to vote for Joe Biden, the practicing Catholic; but rather the thrice married (who cheated on each spouse and then married the friend of Maxwell, currently in custody for sex trafficking) and who can’t recall a scripture. How “Christian” of you. You’re a fake.

Sadly at this point not voting for Biden is as bad as voting for Trump because you know his supporters will be out in force.
Trump/Pence 2020 it won't even be close. Trump hits 270 b4 biden hits 200.
You calling Biden dumb is like Einstein calling you smart.
I think a lot of us are just real uncomfortable about her history as a cop &amp; prosecutor. A lot to unpack with her ... it's a conversation we all need to have. But, in the meantime? Hands down, she and Biden aren't Trump, and that's enough for me. We can address the rest later.
Biden/Harris 2020 I predicted it would B  simply because she was clearly the strongest, most experienced, female candidate!
Biden has forgotten more than Harris will ever know 🤦🏻‍♂️
Calling a bad president a dictator doesn’t help your case.. it just, per usual, makes you look stupid.  Joe biden is infinitely worse than trump in comparison lmao. Trump is just the media villain when biden is the actual villian. Stop regurgitating shit
Are.. are there really people that would vote for Biden?
How Biden selected Kamala Harris as his running mate
Because i don’t like biden that means i want trump? Don’t be stupid lmao
It's no wonder democrats don't remember that they are the party of racism, hell they don't remember what Kamala said about Biden a few months ago!
According to the Kamal, Biden is both!
This election and all US elections ended in 2016 when Authoritarianism won. In what is left of our hearts, we know that if there is an election this Nov, it will be a charade. But, yeah, Harris and Biden is an awesome team.

BBC News - Biden's VP pick: Why Kamala Harris embraces her biracial roots   #SoutikBiswas
Heard an NPR pundit say that it may actually be her tempestuous past as a DA that balances the ticket. The Tr*mp campaign has been accusing Biden of being "soft" on crime &amp; wanting to "abolish the police" (if only, 'twere true). Now that she's in the mix that attack has no teeth.
I’m a POC, and I’m extremely excited for Biden/Harris.
I got a sawbuck that says Biden thinks this is his running mate. #kamalatheugandanwarrior #kamala #ripkamala  Yukon, Oklahoma
If that isn’t a scream of no confidence in Joe Biden, I don’t know what is.
Slogan for the Biden/Harris ticket....  "PEEPADS &amp; KNEEPADS"  LMAO
I’m more ready for the pres debates! Trump: "if you have ideas for how to fix America, which isn’t broken btw, then why didn't you tell Obama for 8 years, or anyone else the past 50 years? I’m great." Biden: "well you've had 3 1/2 pancakes, i like woody allen films, fish sticks"
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are the perfect “better than what we have but not great” duo
Honestly, the only way I would have ever remotely considered Biden is if he had picked Gabbard.
I knew that was coming i seriosly doubt hes a racist but with biden there is no doubt
What happened 5 hours ago, they’ve already moved on. Leftist memories are as good as Hiden Biden’s.
Infuriating and makes me 🤮🤮🤮🤢  Democratic Party sets rules for criticizing Biden’s VP pick Kamala Harris -  -
You think trying to paint Biden as a racist when he literally put an African American woman on the ticket is weak man.  Your downfall is you’re just attacking this time. No vision no plans for a 2nd term besides more cultural wars and more division. No thanks #biden/Harris
I don't agree with Biden's or Harris' stance on banning so-called "assault" weapons. However, I do agree with them on a plethora of other issues and think they are the best folks for the job vs the current embarrassment. And I'm not a single-issue voter.  #BidenHarris2020
If I do, it’ll be a wasted vote. I’m not voting for someone that dislikes my group. Biden doesn’t care about Black folks either.
Sheehan has a pretty brilliant analysis here, of Biden/Harris from a couple of weeks ago, reversing the DNC lurch to the right, how AOC will become a threat from the Left for 2024, and passing a Green New Deal. He thinks Obama should be Sec. of State.
You called biden a racist and a segregationist.  Were you wrong?
Tulsi Gabbard endorsed marriage equality before Barack, Biden and Hillary. What’s the reason Democrats were homophobes before 2013 and only Tulsi gets the blame? Also the only poll that set Tulsi vs Kai showed voters favored Tulsi. This is all reality btws.
Saying this now for future reference. If Biden wins, I’ll be surprised if he doesn’t step down relatively early in his presidency due to “mental decline” of sorts, and Kamala becomes President. Dated: 8/11/20.
I’m curious if this is still true.
You people are always triggered you people destroy cities but your going to make a statement like that about us lol go hid with basement Biden
Vote #BidenHarris2020 to save America!! #BidenHarris
By year 2 or 3.   I’d be surprised if Biden finishes a full term.
Steve Mnuchin probably approves of Biden's choice of VP.
Kamala Harris: Who is Joe Biden’s running mate?
y’all trying to give 20 reasons why Biden picked Kamala and the only reason he did it is cause Obama told him to 😂
He should have, I hate her and she's a 🐍 but any idiot can see she was the best choice after Biden committed to choosing a woman
Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate
Kamala Harris as VP is what you get when you concentrate on skin color instead of policies. Whatever your opinion of her, if you live in a swing state and you don't vote for Biden/Harris, you're a cunt, full stop.
Boy, you sure changed your view of Biden, huh? He's no longer racist, sexist, or believe the women whom have accused him. How fast you are to change your values you were touting while running for president. #TalkingOutOfBothSidesOfHerMouth
I’d like to find it surprising that in the same year there are world wide protests calling for an end to police brutality a super cop is picked as the VP nominee but, joe Biden loves mass incarceration so not surprised at all #toughoncrime #acab
Wanna bet it made Biden look ‘presidential’ for the first time?
What are you talking about? Biden has already agreed to 3 debates. Trump is the one still trying to negotiate...
Hoe Biden didn't pick Harris, the Deep State did!
I’m looking forward to it. Biden did well in the primary debates and Hillary mopped the floor with Trumps dumbass in the 2016 debates, so yeah...bring it. Mr 1917 pandemic ended WW2 is going to get powned.

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris: The Most Pro-Abortion Ticket in American History
I figured. That's one reason I didn't mind Biden holding off for however long he wanted to. I knew they were chomping at the bit to attack any of them.
For real, seriously. I am not a fan of Biden, and Kamela has a worrisome track record... I'm pissed that these are our choices... But even as crap as they are, they'll still be better than 4 more years of 45. I don't believe we can survive that.
You’re making the wrong assumption that Biden is making a single decision on anything
Harris is a good tactical choice--she's the attack dog Biden can't be.  Also, she handily gives a middle finger to folks who thought that real police reform or at least less killing babies for hire might come out of this year.  But, y'know, Biden's deeply held "faith," y'all.
Reade has been proven to be a liar. Her ex never said it was Biden and her friends have abandoned her because she’s a liar and psychotic obviously.
Biden is.
I don’t speak your language but when I saw vote Biden I knew it was ok! #RepublicansAgainstTrump
If you think Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will reform our criminal justice system then you shouldn’t be allowed to vote.
Please tell us that you no longer endorse Biden. You were spot-on about Harris in the debates. She is not what this country needs in the #blm era. Please consider a look at  I know you aren’t a libertarian, but she is much closer to your ideals.
Biden—Harris 2020! Leadership we can be proud of once again.
I don’t even care who Joe Biden didn’t pick. We’re playing football!
He never said it was Biden.
Oof, tough break on your VP pick... couldn’t find anyone who at least defended you against your accusers?
Joe Biden is going to cost Joe Biden the election.

Biden shoots himself in the foot and then forgets why it hurts
You do realize Joe Biden has accusations as well? There is no good person on either side. Don’t fool yourself into thinking the DNC is untarnished. The party of the KKK vs. the party of Lincoln.
Racism - Does it bother you that Biden's VP pick will be chosen by "skin color &amp; gender" instead of character!?!
YOU could have beaten Trump.! "Biden/Harris" or (if Biden retires before November) "Sanders/Harris" WILL LOSE to Trump/Pence!
Biden’s VP Pick: What Republicans have to say about Kamala Harris
Harris ‘honored’ to join Biden on Dem ticket
The DNC doesn't care.  If they cared Joe biden wouldn't be their pick.
Is it okay if we admit this race is really between  and  ?  How long after Biden’s president do they invoke the 25th? And they wouldn’t be wrong.
Half my time line love Kamala Harris, the other half hate her. I wanna say something, but right now I'm just Biden my time... 😏
She will but its a sideshow. It just takes one big slip from Biden to cause problems plus all the illegal shenanigans that the GOP and Barr have lined up to fix the Election Belarus style.
He is lying though. My problem with him playing 4 D chess is thinking it’s ok to lie and manipulate us. It’s not ok under any circumstances. It’s not his support of Biden it’s his covering and lying about him and for him.
Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris for his running mate
Yeah because Biden Harris 2020 is basically a Republican ticket 15 years ago lmao
One thing about  picking  as his vp. Trump is gonna have an hardtime saying Biden is wanting to end police. He picked a cop.
Even if you think Biden would do anything to create effective change, which he won’t (and you’re deluded if you think otherwise), we don’t fucking have time for two slow steps. People are dying and the country is hurling towards catastrophe. We don’t have time for gradualism
The base chose Joe Biden. Looks like you're *still* not over it.
Ofc you do. Joe Biden is also a conservative.
Sure they do, along with Joe Biden.
Kamala Harris is Biden’s running mate?  Joe will be excited when he finds out...
I have a feeling you weren't going to vote for Biden whoever his VP choice would have been, so why do I care about your opinion on her?
At this point Biden could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I would still vote for him.Time for shower: Step 1-put on mask.                         Step 2-pass out.                                Step 3-wake up water logged.         Step 4-crawl out of shower.         Step 5-CURSE OUT BIDEN.        Step 6-repeat step 5.                      Step 7-see 5 😂🤣😂
No according to Biden-because I don’t think he “nose” about fellatio or cunnilingus 😂🤣😂🤣😂

It’s not as crazy as it seems if you listen to Biden and Harris-thats what they are encouraging and in agreement with. Absolutely disgusting at best. Thank you for this! Peace🌸
I wish the President use this video as one of his campaign ads, he has a lot of ammunition on Biden and he should use it.
It’s your vote to cast! I’m voting for Biden/Harris.
Twitter "FACT CHECKED" and banned the President.  But I havent been banned yet.  Please see pic below.  If you believe in this...  Like Biden said, Youre a lying dog face pony soldier. You aint black. Come'on man!! You know you know the thing. Poor kids are just as intelligent as
Ill forget it and I will say your name wrong just to show how much I dont care for you.  Gross.  Disgusting.  If you run as VP for Biden you aint black.
Twenty Twenty Rigged = 222 / 888  Trump getting re-elected. BUT Elections are rigged. If THEY rig this election via the "Mail-In" and other means, then expect to see Harris installed as President when Biden forgets where he is.
This is well worth the read!
Biden Pick Kamala Harris = 1110 I was keeping it a bit to myself.
Hahah  Dot not feather.  Lmao.  Andd.........  Now she is Black.  Is she gonna get a dark sun tan and try natural black face?  Omg.  If you dont vote for Biden and Kahmahlah...  You aint black and its okay, neither is she or Them, They?  They are not black.  Haha...

Well, no, he’s not fit to RUN that’s why he’s Ridin’ Biden!! (Sorry it couldn’t be helped...tried not too😂) Peace🌸!
Hahaha...  Sleepy Joe made his first promise   Train wreck!  He said a black African American and  Even  IS IN THE ARGUMENT.  CAN YOU REALLY TRUST BIDEN?  DOES HIS WORD MEAN ANYTHING.  I SAY NO!   KEPT HIS PROMISES AND FOUGHT FOR THEM!  Word is Bond!
Haha...  Sleepy Joe Biden forget he was gonna pick an African American black woman?  This girl is INDIA INDIAN AMERICAN.  I can hear Joe,  Come'on man! I know what I said at the the, thing but she is a woman. She has the you know the Thing.
Biden is a boss that place America first. However Trump doesn’t understand that America comes first , before petty, vindictive qualms.
I don’t see Biden winning this election. Which is a good thing.
Biden has an entire cabinet to fill with girl magic 😍
I just ask myself WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE PARENTS?? I raised my kids to be aware that no one should touch them where their bathing suit covers, but Biden seems to have shot that all to hell...now I have to include “sniffing” with my grandkids?!? Peace🌸.

Why didn't Biden or Harris respond to questions from their large crowd of 12 supporters that showed up at their "press conference"?
Joe Biden to citizens  "I don't work for you!"  Yes he did say it.  Politicians seem to forget who's in charge.   Know why?   We let them.
Biden won't answer questions. Media's okay with that. I'm not okay with it. I want him to speak and expose his ignorance to the world. Here's something funny. Media says people want Joe to handle China's virus. Joe's plan? Is everything Trump has done and doing. Original Joe? LOL
Negative feedback from Tillerson, O’Bannon, Bolton, etc. You idiots are digging deep to elect Kamala and Biden. That’s why Trump supporters aren’t moved!
I'm saying that we need to counter Trump's EOs against Climate Change &amp; reverse the EOs he's written to reverse environment laws. Not that Biden or anyone else should use EOs to like Trump did. Laws need to be written to make the use of EOs more difficult.
And yeah all of us lose if Biden loses. Especially if RBG dies during those four years. And remember it's Trump that promised to protect trans people then fucked them over in the military. Everyone loses with Trump. Everyone.
Yes he will. Go to the Federal Government website and read all of the EO's he's written rolling back environmental protection laws. Biden will try to restore those. We also need Biden in place in case we lose RBG. We can't afford to lose another SC seat.
Really? Trey Gowdy? What is the real difference between him and Joe Biden? They both have always been against Trump. And Marco Rubio? What channel is this? Who’s show is this? Whose Audience is watching this crap
And Biden has lost his mind...

What do you know about the serious THREAT on Joe Biden when you said on your show, “Something BAD is going to happen to  befor the Election!?” Have you contacted the  about this grave threat? Also, another Fox host said the same thing!? #FoxNews
Is the  looking into her comment about something happening to  before the Election!!??? That’s a huge statement to make! What does she mean by that? What does she know? Is somebody going to try to assassinate Joe Biden!???
It seems like Biden’s entire strategy is based around the goal of beating Trump.  Is that what you’re seeing?  And is “what you are against” enough to win an election?
So basically she is saying she lied trying to defeat Biden. That means now she will lie to try and defeat  #ItWasADebate
Great visual - the trump train will plow through your town at break neck speeds and blow right past the things you need to have addressed while blowing environmental needs away. The Biden team will see each need as it comes and act with purpose and determination. #flipitblue
Hahahahaha! OMG! Sooooo funny! That dumb MF don’t know what to do about Kamala Harris or Joe Biden! But what he should do, is get the hell out of the way because he’s going to lose!
Any Catholic who votes Biden or Democrat commits a mortal sin and puts his soul in jeopardy of eternal damnation.  Ignorance of Dim evil is willful and thus souls are culpable
The Trump Train, after meeting the Biden Express.
Lmao white privlage doesn’t exist y’all trippin on some Hidin Biden Bullshit
Well Vickie, I mean my tweet to you was pretty straightforward in that it was a question based on your tweet about Biden-Harris. Had nothing to do with  but I’m glad you acknowledge you can’t even follow a simple question (or realize I was joking about all.the.way)
Really? Good Lord you are ready to fuck everyone completely over under Trump. If Trump stays in office this country is over. Period. I didn't want Biden/Harris but they won't destroy the Constitution. They won't reverse gay marriage or Row v Wade. They won't stop SS &amp; Medicare.
Biden has been asleep longer than 4 years.   His comatose sleep started in 2008-09.  He has been living in an imaginary &amp; delusional world since.
Yeh because Joe Biden certainly can't and she can do what she does best
'Why walk over those coals?' Biden camp weighs keeping Kamala in basement, too via
Sanity.   #BidenHarris
Has she changed her belief?  If so, why did she do so?
Old creepy bumbling Biden.
Okay everyone. On 3 everyone will forget the attack on Biden from Harris. She called him a racist among other allegations. On 3, we pretend it never happened.  1..... 2..... 3  Hey look! Puppies!
Biden and Harris are WEAK on crime and want to see our cities burn, unlike President Trump and Vice President Pence who are working to restore LAW AND ORDER.
Phony Kamala Harris, Joe Biden’s new liberal handler.
This Biden speech is absolutely amazing and Presidential as all get out.
If Americans needed a reason not to vote for Biden, you just got a big juicy one.
He stopped the flights incoming from China while Pelosi was telling everyone to come to China Town because it was safe. The rest was the failures of Democratic leadership from mayors &amp; govenors. Also if he spied on Biden it would probably be a horror film. GD Pedophiles.
Remember when kamala said she believes everyone of Biden’s accusers. What happen there? Hush money I assume
Gross. We need to shed more light on this. World wide pedophilia ring going on right now. Her &amp; Biden are complicit. KLM!
The ugly visages of the promoters for Biden/Harris are so hateful. Their voices and speech patterns obnoxious.  These two demented and hater of America are what Dims/media/Rinos want.  A Godless Communist Government. Unbelievable
maybe they could put out a letter about what they'd do if Trump used sketchy FISA warrants and political appointees  to spy on Biden
Harris could not be president if Biden went down. Her parents were not citizens when she was born
If something happened to Biden Harris cannot be his replacement it would go to pelocy
Biden was a gaffe machine when he was young, have you seen him lately Billy?
Open our eyes and ears to this evil evil duo. Biden/Harris
Joe Biden said Obama is the first “smart, articulate and good looking African American” do not get manipulated by the most racist politician in the books.
Kind of fitting that she would run with Biden who I truly believe is racist....sad that it is being hiden
Back in Black w/Harris &amp; Biden
Biden: I’m not sure you’re the right fit. Harris: I use Pantene. Biden: Welcome to the ticket.
Biden said he would pick a woman
Let’s be honest. In 2016, HRC was the worst candidate in the history of candidates. Republicans couldn’t have that. Instead of learning a lesson, Democrats are now outdoing themselves with the Biden/Harris ticket. Blame yourselves. Hail to that red hat wearing 2-term booger.
My vote is going straight to Biden
I’m more of the flip the red and blue states to green. I lean alil more on red myself but both suck right now I just can’t vote for Biden if anyone takes offense to that you shouldn’t because I don’t take offense to you voting for Biden to each his own we’re all fuck either way
And I hope this isn’t interpreted as a “wasted vote” argument. I don’t think any type of voting is a waste. But I do think that Biden needs every vote he can get, and I think he is the candidate with the best chance to beat shitbird 45.
I know Biden isn’t amazing. He wasn’t my first choice, or even my second or third choice. I don’t think he’s a great person. But he is who we’ve got. Voting for a third-party candidate is a risk we can’t take if we want this unqualified tyrannical fool out of office.
“In Historic Pick, Joe Biden Taps Kamala Harris To Be His Running Mate”. NPR tag line for Biden picking his running mate. Apparently somebody at NPR actually has a sense of humor!
Sorry, correction, she did attend a Church of God as a child but she considers herself a “Black Baptist”
Kamala’s biggest potential impact for Biden will be the loss of California when it would have been a slam dunk without her.  CA is getting fed up with Shit Hole San Francisco Politics and bully LA Politics.   Outcome TBD??
Perhaps because Biden is suffering from the early onset of dimentia.   — Easy ticket in for a potential presidency via the Article II Succession Clause. #BidenHarris2020 #KamalaHarris #KamalaHarrisForVP #BidenHarris
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
I agree.  A weak play from Biden.  But who else was there for him to loose with out there.
Reminding everyone of this gem of mine now that she’s Biden’s official Veep pick.
Biden taps Kamala Harris as running mate, setting aside tensions from primary  #FoxNews
Once again Trump wants to cut taxes for the upper 5%. Raise their taxes Joe.
It’s either you can make a terrible voting choice or the worst voting choice. No inbetween. We had some amazing people up on the debate stage... I don’t know how we got here. I don’t even know anyone who voted for Biden. Wtf
Biden is said to be pleased that his pick for VP is you know... That lady from that place.
Trump machine is lying about this.
Death team for President. Biden Harris. Abortion  infanticide. Coming soon:  one child policy  forced sterilization  forced vaccinations forced euthanasia.  Godless society.
Someone would always be salty with WHOEVER Biden picked, but let’s not take away the moment of the first black woman tapped to be Vice President. American history.
What will Tammy do? Remain a Senator? Or...??? But, I'm still voting Biden/Harris 2020. Good enough for me, I think.
Of course she did. She cares nothing. Nothing for America. She panders. She lusts  for power. She is an empty empty soul like the demented racist Biden. She accepts his racism as she knows she will be President.  In her sick sick mind.
Yay! So happy Biden chose Kamala Harris as his running mate... she’ll make a great future President :)
Trump instantly lashes out at Kamala Harris as Joe Biden announces her as VP pick ?
Kasich has become a left wing weirdo supporting AOC &amp; Bernie in support of Biden.   Don’t listen to what he says anymore, his actions have set his political path right through Socialism
With Kamala Harris as Joe Biden's ‘political living will,’ he is surrendering control of our nation to the radical mob with promises to raise taxes, cut police funding, kill energy jobs and open our borders. #LeadRight #ArmyForTrump #MAGA #KeepAmericaGreat #Trump2020
America can't afford Joe Biden. #LeadRight #ArmyForTrump #MAGA #KeepAmericaGreat #Trump2020 #Trump2020Landslide
Just when I think  couldn’t possibly be any dumber
Harris will dominate the debate stage against Pence but how will Biden do against Trump 🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️
Biden has chosen Kamala Harris as his VP pick!      DO NOT treat her like u did Hilary! Don't ask her abt her hair/clothing choices! Treat her the same u would a male candidate! Don't belittle her b/c she's female! #Respect is the key! #BidenHarris!
I’M SOOOOOOO HAPPY!!!! Let’s go Biden/Harris 2020!!! #BidenHarris2020
Biden needs to Quit lying or listen more closely.   Cannot remember much and creates fiction too often.
Biden|Harris is official
Sounds like a Biden lie!!
Biden and everyone said he shouldn’t ! Anyone saying he was right doing that now? Oh hell no ! Too easy to try to blame him when you absolutely know it wasn’t his fault ! Geez! Grow up and at least be honest !
Joe Biden is too busy Making under the table deals with China.  Wake up people !
A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll revealed that just 13% of voters say their vote is up for grabs in the presidential election   via
But but but Ben, it has training wheels. So Biden is more competent than that Raccoon!
Biden Campaign supporters are using Trumps Strategies and rewrapping them into a Democrat illusion so Biden &amp; voters think Biden created the idea.   DEJA VOUS—PLAGIARISM AGAIN!!!
I keep asking and no one will answer my serious question. What has Biden done for America? Not sarcasm, I honestly want to know.
Well this what this Native American has said for a while White people need to start suing it is their civil right this is discrimination at its finist just like Biden is being demanded to choose a Black female for VP it is just bullshit and it needs to stop it is nasty racism.
Just a born sick liar  Biden
0% chance Biden tweeted this himself. Because he's literally mentally incapable
Here we fucking go....They are already trying to say that the woman that Joe Biden, takes to be his VP was involved in the sabotage, corruption and  investigation into the 2016 Elections!! WTF!!??? Are you serious!!#TrumpPressConference
A last ditch effort, just like in 2016 and Hillary Clinton dump, they want to come up with non-fact based BS to come up with to damage Joe Biden. People are much smarter this time around and will NOT FALL FOR IT!!
Duh? Biden isn’t a progressive? We all know this.
Way less expensive than a totally botched pandemic response by Trump, &amp; these supports for the safety net will address the social determinants of health, reduce healthcare costs. We this under Biden because we will still have Social Security &amp; Medicare. Trump tried to end both!
Due to pandemic...Congress must pass relief bill that gives a person $3 for every time Joe Biden has said something racist.
We are a nation divided. Sorry to say. Elect Biden and things  really fall apart. Worse than Obumma times.
Backing a fool like Biden gets you a empty suit with no memory. How will he function? Let me guess. The dems will slip in Clinton, or just as bad, Obumma the court jester.
Joe Biden tried to cut Social Security and Medicare for decades.  Now, Biden is promising YOUR benefits to illegal immigrants.  President Trump is protecting Social Security and Medicare!  #LeadRight #ArmyForTrump #MAGA #KeepAmericaGreat #Trump2020 #Trump2020Landslide
I’m aware of two #Tulsa houses that had Biden signs taken out of their yard and replaced with “Commie” written on the driveway. One is a law enforcement officer.
Biden caused the crap in Latin America.
Instead of debating on the national stage maybe Joe will challenge Trump to a "Basement Push-up Challenge".  Biden is not worthy or mentally capable of holding the office of president.
To heal this nation as Joe Biden would say. I think a woman on the ticket is exactly what we need to heal this nation. No matter who it is he decides to pick!! And a woman who is very ambitious for that position is exactly what we need. #TrumpFailsAmerica
Biden can ride a bike, u can't!  gave wealthy a huge tax break that left out most Americans, stocks are already down b/c of ur incompetent response to COVID, same for economy/jobs! Looks like YOU are to blame donnie! 11/3/20 Americans will #MakeTrumpGoAway!🙂
That segment of the population who think a vote for Biden is anything but a vote against Trump really cracks me up.
Black ppl not fuckin with Biden look at his numbers with blacks
ok, where are the tough questions on Biden???
YOU are the biggest political crime &amp; scandal in American history! Hopefully, for the good of our country, YOUR removal from office will begin on Nov. 3rd when America tells u--YOU'RE FIRED!  Make America Great Again--Vote Biden!  #Biden2020! #TrumpCantRideABike
Biden is worthy of EVERY vote we give him! YOU are not worthy of living in the people's house b/c YOU are a HUGE disgrace, a failure, a laughingstock worldwide, &amp; a JOKE! YOU are a racist, vile, bully, greedy, LIAR! #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
Biden was out riding bikes while you were running away from strong women journalists' hard questions! We prefer a real man, not a whiny whuss baby who runs away from a strong woman b/c she called you out on ur lies! #TrumpHatesStrongWomen!  #TrumpIsWeak!
A tax that they will have to pay back! Another burden to put on their shoulders! Man, ur making  a Biden win that much more certain! Thank You!  #TrumpCantRideABike #TrumpsCovidCoverup
What's not racist about the left demanding Biden choose a woman, not white, as his VP choice?   "must be black"  How's that not racist? Or even sexism?
Biden has already forfeited his right to be President.  Class act—NO!!!
A childish response you think everyone who is against Biden more than Trump is a redneck, kkk or a racist but most of those people just don’t want to feed into the corruption and are trying to keep the government from taking every right that ever American has regardless of race
Another term for bully, although VP Biden will be fine.
Of course.  Russia targets Biden in election-meddling effort, U.S. intelligence says
Biden was sniffing her hair, went in for the kill!
Because they know Hiding Biden has no chance! See you later quid pro Joe!
Biden was marginal when he told Obama that Obamacare was a big fuc’n deal.  That was many years ago.
Biden at the new libtard rally!Imagine if Biden’s brother died, he would’ve forgotten already

I know some Bernie supporters who are extreme and/or uncompromising but the vast majority of them are not.  Over 80% of them are voting Biden according to most polls.  You’re just taking a few interactions from Twitter and projecting them onto a large demographic of people.
MSNBC/CNN.....YOU ONLY HAVE ONE POKER HAND (AND IT'S A LOSER)...YES, IT'S TRAGIC WITH ALL THE GLOBAL COVID-19 DEATHS, BUT TRUMP NOT TO BLAME..INDIA, RUSSIA, OTHERS-ALL REOPENING FOR ECONOMY BALANCE WITH VIRUS SPREAD.  BIDEN/HARRIS-LOSERS, KENNEDY III/ABRAMS would have won!
JOE BIDEN'S PRINCIPLES:  The Principles of Denial, Cover-up, Can't Remember, Me and my buddy Barack Weaponizing the FBI and of course, Joe Biden's "GET RICH QUICK/"F" THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER" SCHEME with UKRAINE!
INTEGRITY? PRINCIPLES? Biden-"no conflict of interest" AG-review of Hunter's career shows that he, along with Joe's brother James, have been trading on their family name for years, giving money to a member of Joe Biden’s family wins the favor of Joe Biden.
I imagine you had no problem with the postal service union endorsing Biden, you pathetic hypocrite. Unions have ALWAYS endorsed political candidates. You know that, right? 😂🤡😂
I don’t want Trump out I want Biden in jail.
And this is what the NBA,NFL,MLB,Soccer,ect are supporting,blm!!! This is not about black lives,it’s intimidation to cause fear!It’s Anarchy by Socialists/Communist with the support of Biden/Harris,MSM and Democrats! Voters better wake up and Vote straight Republican Ballot🦅🤠🇺🇸
They are our ally but when Biden was VP he used $5M of US Money to bribe Ukraine to stop the investigation into Burisma and Hunter Biden.
If Biden and Kamala *both* withdraw before November, you'll know I'm onto something.
People have been dunking on Biden for the crime bill for years, what are you talking about?
Most of my mom's friends are voting Biden. Because they can't tolerate the President's brash personality. Her "Christian" friends. Biden/Harris are the strongest  abortion-supporting ticket in history.  The murder of innocent lives, and you're worried about his personality?
Same. I don’t think you’ll ever find a candidate like that however Biden/Harris is progressive as you’ll get.
You mean leadership when Biden threatened to withhold money if they investigated his son. You mean leadership when he used his office to get his son who was kicked out of the Navy for doing drugs.
I actually voted for Trump in ‘16 I’m ready for a change. Biden doesn’t check every box for me, but I personally think the country would be better served with him as president. I’m not asking you to agree I just started by trying to point out patriotic people can vote either way
Biden and Obama sold "American military troop security" to ANY country that would pay them and put American soldiers in harm's way.  THIS IS WHY the UKRAINE STORY is such A BIG STORY!  Biden will sell out again, that's his only form of diplomacy.
Biden didn't agree to take questions, until Nancy Pelosi tells him that it's OK for him to speak!
If Biden loses she needs to be bombarded with that video until it stings.
Why don’t they treat Biden and Harris like they do the President? And yell out gotcha questions,be Rude,Don’t respect,etc? President Trump answer puts up with their shit but still answers questions!You never saw that with Obuma because if they did he wouldn’t let back in?🤷🏼‍♂️🤥🤷🏼‍♂️
Vote for  is a vote for Iran, Ukraine, Chine &amp; Russia. A vote for Biden shows you support a racist and sexist.
Oh look another singer that thinks she can influence my vote.  thinks that Trump is dismantling the USPS. The USPS has lost $69B in the past 11 years. That started during the Obama/Biden administration. She is backing  who is a racist and sexist.
I’m voting for Biden because I love my county and cannot stand what Trump is doing to it
Using symbolism associated with an old racist seems appropriate here, given Biden’s history of racism.
Why did Biden's people do this to him?
Still a bit curious as to why the University of Oklahoma allows the Chinese Communist Party to operate on campus.  ...on balance, would Bejing Biden likely approve, or disapprove, of this arrangement...
Good thing Biden's never been involved in any self-dealing or family enrichment scandals ever since he entered the state house in the early 70s or anything like that.
Has the Deaf community given Kamala and Biden a sign name? #deaftwitter
I’d take Biden/Harris over Tubby/Pinhead anytime.
I like you Kojo, but Jesse's right. Biden's been all about sweetheart loans and enriching his family ever since he was in the state house.
They played us like a fiddle &amp; Bejing Biden still has not caught on.
Who are "you people"?  I would have excitedly voted Democrat for Joe Kennedy III/Stacey Abrams.  Not another 4 years from an old, senile, washed up Biden-46 long years, ineffective political run from a man "who sells" US military protection to highest bidder (see Ukraine, NZ).
Go with your feeling kn Biden and Harris. You won’t go wrong!
And the polls say Biden is leading by double digits. Come on, man!
But the people did, and when the people didn’t, don’t expect them to vote🤷‍♂️ Biden offers nothing to progressives, same for kamala.
I guess she will be “The Help”
You mean the 20,000 more people that voted for Bernie than Biden in Iowa?
Biden appears to be in the early stages of dementia. That's why he doesn't answer any hard questions. So that means Harris will be the president with all her radical liberal ways.
Hey Jim how far is your nose up Biden ass?
Trump giving QAnon and Fox News their Biden Era talking points.
"Trade wars are easy to win" says  as he loses one trade war after another and now losing a 2016 Pennsylvania voter.   Volant farmer to speak at Democratic convention on why he's switching to Biden  via
Simply put, NO, Biden was for everything Dr. King was against.
You know what’s cool?  Biden/DNC can do the same during the Synchopant convention the following week!
I'm befuddled at  speaking directly B4 Joe Biden accepts the nom at #DemConvention  How they gonna ignore my mans in every possible way then suddenly drop him a primetime slot. Dont get me wrong this is great and the only thing that will make me watch but damn. Now?
And yet people wonder why he stays hidden in his basement...#HidenBiden    #FoxNews
How many pictures of Biden have you seen with Epstein? Zero. How many of Trump and Epstein? Thousands.
Grasping for anything anti-Trump, are we?  Go with Biden/Harris.  See how that works out 4 ya.
Because if Biden doesn't win, his position on climate change doesn't matter at all. First rule of politics: you have to win to govern.  The cages were built to house unaccompanied minors for a transition period while locating guardians or moving to HHS. Do you not remember 2014?
Its not a loose loose sit.  You mean lose?  It isn't that either.  Trump will mop the floor with Biden.
So you are dismissing the vote of religious people?? Calling them manipulated? Boy oh boy is that a mistake.  So your saying Biden and Kamala are atheist or agnostic? I don't believe even THEY are dumb enough to run on that. Give me one agnostic or atheist president.
Holy shit lefties are stupid.  ITS NOT ABOUT WHAT YOU GET WITH JOE BIDEN ITS ABOUT WHAT YOU DONT GET WITH TRUMP.  AAAAAAAAHHHHHGGGGGG!!!!
I understand why they are talking about this, but there seems to be a narrative outside of the main purpose, readying Americans for Biden to give her the presidency.
If  and  win the election in November, I propose we #expiditetheinauguration.  #EvictTrump immediately after President Biden and Vice President Harris are confirmed the winners.
Old white man joe biden has been on the taxpayer dime for dang near 50 years.  #leech.
Biden might win Oklahoma if they get to “vote” like that
If dead people and pets can vote for Biden you can vote for Trump. Just get ahold of one of those mail in ballots. They’ll never check the post mark.
Agreed. I do think a lot of the Biden/Harris discourse should have run its course during the primaries. I understand that most of us aren’t happy the duo, but it’s to the point where we need to just accept the situation and start working with it.
Can someone give me one good reason to vote for Biden because I really have not heard one good reason to vote for him and because he’s not Trump is not a good answer ..
No. Wrong. Not sorry. I get you may not like Biden, and trust me he wasn't my first choice either. But we need to do every fucking thing we can to defeat Trump by the widest possible margin so choosing not to vote because you don't like Biden is irresponsible and stupid.
I'm sure that if they'd support Biden you'd change your tune.  🤡🤡
Umm you can’t stop the mail Donnie! You are the reason why Biden gunna crush you in November #BidenHarrisLandslide2020
Is this an Obama-Biden cage?  Because if you didn't know, it was standard practice during the Obama administration to use these same type of holding areas.
Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign  Barry Obama: "Don't underestimate Joe's ability to f..k things up."   #FoxNews
It would be funny AF if Biden lost.
I swear Trump will attempt to tie Biden into hashtag Save Our Children within the next couple of months, which is hilarious because Trump himself has like 12 “celebrity elite” pics with Epstein
Dude, values. Our values are gonna be so good. Right now our values are bad. Having bad values is bad and having good ones is good, that’s why I’m voting Biden, because I want good values instead of bad ones.
This was the silent majority! No more. Speaking out &amp; getting in #GoodAndNecessaryTouble is maybe start of bringing Unity &amp; hope for us all.  TY so much 🙏 'I'm disgusted with Trump': Arizona Republican explains why he's voting for Biden
This kind of horrible voter outreach is giving me second thought about sucking it up and voting for Biden.
so I’ve said multiple times how Biden is better than Trump. You blocking me because you can’t read doesn’t change facts. Fuck you, moron. I’m a communist, not a “shitlib” as you would claim. I understand theory because I’m not a fucking idiot like you. 🖕🏼
You know what would be better? People maximizing Biden's chances of winning by not fracturing the party with inflammatory rhetoric because he isn't pandering to each and every issue leftists want.
It doesn't matter what Biden commits to if he doesn't win. I think this election will be closer than you seem to think it will be. I figure anyone at all has maybe a 35-40% chance of beating Trump because of how they're gaming the system.
Biden was never my favorite. He wasn't even my second favorite. I just understand how big a deal this is, and I seem to have a better grasp on just how tenuous this situation is than you do.
I never said all the other problems disappear. But there is no problem at all that will be made better by Trump winning again. A great many problems will be made better by Biden winning, including this existential crisis we're in as a nation.
Fucking listen.  People took it for granted that Hillary would win in 2016 and so the attacks from the left were absolutely relentless. Learn from that.  The stakes are too high to fuck around.  Biden winning is very important. Him moving left? Not important at all by comparison.
Because you'd rather democracy literally be dismantled in America than Biden be President. Got it.
Because if Biden doesn't win, it very well could quite literally be the end of American democracy.
Mine is my new Joe Biden/Harris face mask. And I will proudly be wearing to show my support
Maybe Kamal Harris figured out she was for Biden, and wasn't for trump, and that's what made her turn black?
NJ will be going for Biden Harris in a BIG way.
Your heart is huge &amp; Kamala is great! However, can a man/Biden w/ONLY 70% of his brain capacity REALLY lead the United States, as we explore new energies, fight new greed, hopefully gain immunity, continue to thwart China, keep Putin content, while educating ALL Americans? HONEST
I like brainless Biden
I support both you and Biden but, truth be told, we have had AT LEAST three and a half years to do those things and look where we’re at.
To start, a number of anonymously sourced quotes from Obama leaked out throughout the 2020 Biden campaign where the former president allegedly expressed doubts about his former running mates’ fitness for office.
Half the country would be unemployed in a Biden administration during a pandemic.
It sure does matter! At least Trump has done what he said he would. It’s not gonna affect SS. Unless all you watch is msnbc or cnn.  Biden has argued for cuts or freezes to SS for much of his 45 year career. What has he accomplished in all those years?
One of the worst run unions and organizations in America endorses Biden? Seems about right!
I mean you could argue most politicians are. Biden picking her IMO alienates his current radical base and fails to secure a sizable portion of mods playing the "law and order card" his party cant even denounce a terrorist group let alone prosecute rioters
After 51 Years in DC, If you think Joe Biden  is suddenly going to bring change. You are an Idiot!
I'm pretty sure I remember just a few days ago Biden on his bike zooming past a Fox news reporter.
Trump does a horrific job uniting all races, creeds &amp; religions. He's a scientific dolt. Yet, from his trade bills to his Middle East peace acts, to his opiate crackdown at US ports of entry, to his strong stance on China, to having 100%ok-90% brain capacity, he "trumps" Biden!
Non issue.  Israel/UAE is a huge issue and HUGE win for Trump!  Biden/Obama wussed out, delayed any peace talks, and have the blood of dead US soldiers on their wimpy hands-when they gave Iran 150 billion!!!!
It’s what they want. They know Biden can’t win, so they want away to delegitmize and cast “doubt” on the election.
Biden / Harris the faces of what basic bitches look like hahaha
Joe biden however did say he wanted to defund social security
I guess we listen to opisite news sources and therefore get the bias we want. All i know is I am hearing reporters ask people and those people are stating Biden will not change dates or add a 4th.
You could be right, but local organizers are fighting quite an uphill battle against the two-party power structure. The fact that we’ve had only two parties worth anything for many decades now shows what a difficult process that is. Again, not saying I’m going against Biden
He just needs to shut up and bring back Fauci and Burke. Did he send them to Siberia? We NEED their expertise not his BS. Biden doesn’t support wacko Qanon cult members to get their votes.
Not saying I’m not voting Biden, but let’s say my dream is one day the US is de-polarized like Germany or one of many other Euro countries with a true DemSocialist party and many diverse parties with diverse interests. How do I get there by voting Dem in perpetuity?
0 cap detected. Saw someone call biden a fascist, socialist, liberals, communist unironically
Legit If i had a nickel for every time I've had to explain to my moms friends that im an actual socialist and that biden isn't some radical communist and that he's more of a republican than anything I'd be so rich that i could give it to the poor
What like funding HBC’s and making sure it’s 10 years instead of begging every year? Or creating opportunity zones in minoritie neighborhoods? Or signing first step act that allowed a lot of young black men that Biden and Clinton’s crime bill put in prison out of prison?

Consider, in the event they win, that she will very likely 'have' to replace Biden before his first year in office. He does not come across as a man who is mentally fit for the office  I truly believe a vote for Biden is really a vote for Kamala.

In her first two days as Joe Biden’s running mate, Kamala Harris has vouched for Biden’s character on race and more. And the enthusiasm surrounding her historic candidacy has brought in a record $48 million in 48 hours.

Once again, any attacks against him reduce his chances against Trump. I guess you'd rather have Trump as President?  If it were a less odious opponent, fine. But it's Trump. And yes, hurting Biden helps Trump.
I'm just going to quote this on every Joe Biden tweet from now until the election.
I love hearing Kamala Harris talk about the plan that Elizabeth Warren wrote for Joe Biden.
If #BidenHarris win, and the Republicans gain control of the House, make  Speaker.  When #Biden is removed due to mental issues and #Harris is found to be ineligible, Jordan becomes #POTUS
Progressives are supposed to back Biden/Harris, while the party actively tries to destroy a progressive candidate's campaign against a "moderate" incumbent by using homophobia? The Dems can kiss my progressive ass.
Def don’t think Biden has the charisma of say, an Obama or a Reagan or even Trump. Putting him out there like this feels like being served re-heated leftovers. I don’t think he has the ability or the desire to gain the same kind of religious devotion as is given to 44 and 45
oh yeah that is kamala harris’ proposal that you just sent i was referring to biden’s. not like any of this matters anyway biden’s ass ain’t gonna get elected 😂
To me it looks like a lot of the enthusiasm for Biden is wishful thinking, like “Well, let’s make the most of this and give him our full support,” gaslighting themselves until they believe he’s amazing, while a large chunk of Trump supporters seem to borderline worship him.
You look like a bot. Are you a bot?
VOTE FOR BIDEN
Press ushered out of Biden- Kamala nomination doc signing. Why in Hell am I the only person bringing this up???
One thing is forsure, no flippin way they dont swap out Biden
Biden will most certainly get replaced. Maybe they want two women
Biden is elected.  Biden dies.  Token brown female VP assumes office.  Police state becomes worse under her reign.  Laugh.
When will they get rid of Biden? Predictions? 👇🏽 who are they swapping him with?
Listen, Biden and Harris are not perfect. They have issues with their past that they will need to deal with and make changes, but to say that because they aren't perfect, you should sit one out and let the current President get re-elected? Go fuck yourself.  Vote his ass out.
That Biden, Kamala doc signing was infamous!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
In no way, shape, or form do i think Biden is a good candidate but i think this is very misleading. His tax plan is actually fairly realistic IMO and are targeted at people making over $400,000 (the 1%). And I do support the increase of the capital gains tax.
these are our choices. Absolutely fucking hate it. But we can survive a Biden presidency. We can elect other progressive candidates down the ballot. We can apply leftward pressure to Biden and still have a functioning country at the end. 4 more years of 45 will destroy us. (2/2)
What our President is trying to do is called Fascism. So whatever problems you have with the Biden/Harris candidacy shut your fucking mouth and vote against fascism!! #BidenHarris2020
Exactly this. A Biden/Harris ticket isn't perfect, and in fact there are def some legit concerns... but in the absence of a perfect candidate, I'd rather have the imperfect one that'll still at least push some liberal policies over the man who's actively trying to destroy America
If the democrats had any integrity, which they lack, they’d realize this disqualifies Joe Biden from being president by their own admission.
Vote for Biden/Harris cause we have more of a survival chance with them even if it’s still scary and with them we maybe will still have a victory 8 years down the road.
Raymond Arroyo: Is Kamala Harris Biden's shadow president?  via
I think the issue is that it ONLY resonates with people in the Fox News bubble. Joe Biden isn’t nearly as reviled by the general public as Hillary was. Calling Joe “far left” only works on those who would’ve never voted for him anyway.
Honestly, I would buy the rhetoric, but it failed last time. And paying more attention this time, the dnc will continue to do everything in its power to disenfranchise progressives. I can't not vote for Biden, but it's hard for me to be too upset with people that won't.
Watching my friends who grew up raving, are pro marijuana, and support BLM and defund the police now try to do mental gymnastics to justify supporting Biden and Harris makes me very sad. Just another example that logical consistency is dead in America.
THREADCEPTION  But no, seriously, there's some really important points made here and I'm guilty of doing it myself. I have legitimate concerns about some policies that a Biden/Harris ticket might advance... but they'd honestly still be far, far better than 4 more years of 45.
Mika supporting a proven racist and sexual predator in
Can't wait for Biden to win and people to remember dems suck too.
Their polls also show Biden leading President Trump.
We just had a poll showing Biden +3. Somebody is *wrong* by a lot. My guess, this one.
Am I the only one who feels the Biden/Harris campaign materials and messaging targeted towards women reeks of a certain implicit TERF vibe? Like, beyond Harris’ brutally hostile treatment of Trans inmates in California?
Delete Biden Insert TRUMPIE  Projection defined !
really? Biden commercial blaming Trump 4 downplaying Covid? Y’all were calling him racist 4 banning China? Liars! Crooks! Idiots!          -destructive
Would love the see the D Duo focus mostly on their vision for the future. Allude to The Pres not doing his job, but promote what a Biden/Harris Admin WILL do with specifics. Better to invite voters to a more positive outlook.
Debate? Are there going to be debates again? Because the MOAB will be the Trump/Biden debate.🍿

"'Little Brown Girl': Australian Biden-Harris Cartoon Sparks Furore" by Reuters via NYT
Personally, I can't wait to spend the next 4 years trashing Biden's admin.
I think the Biden/Harris coallition is basically "everyone who doesn't like Donald Trump." That is currently a large group, but it's not very unified, so winning with that coalition will be easier than governing with it.
Voting Green is the right thing to do but unfortunately the Green Party isn't on the ballot here. Biden I guess
I’m obvi gonna be moderately happy if Biden wins in Nov. but that doesn’t change the fact that half the world should burn. If anything the last 4 yrs have only confirmed that Thanos was on the right track.
Yep, this is one scenario/mindset I was worried about. I'd rather the nominees be Trump and Biden. I've dealt with Trump for 1,301 days. At this point, I can deal with him another 159. If he wins, then impeach him.
Buuuut when joe Biden does it??
Literally wrote I’m voting fo Biden in my fb post condemning the DNC and someone had the AUDACITY to say “get Trump out” BITCH OBVIOUSLY BUT WE CAN STILL CRITIQUE CORPORATE INTERESTS IN OUR OWN DAMN PARTY
Who will DEMS pick to top their ticket with upcoming news that Joe Biden will be exiting the ticket/retiring from public office before October 1?
As the subsequent tweet notes, Harris only raised $40M in her entire campaign and Biden raises $60M in all of 2019.
Hey Georgie.  THE DEMS ARE THE LOSERS RIGHT NOW.  No White House, No Senate.  And, KKKamala has incarcerated more black youths than ANY POLITICAL FIGURE, EVER!  EVEN HER POLITICAL SPIN WILL NOT CONVINCE MY BLACK FRIENDS TO VOTE FOR HER TICKET WITH "WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S" BIDEN!

Too many followers. A vote for Trump is a vote for evil. A vote for Biden is a vote for evil and for being a dumb cuck.
Ummm....where is Joe Biden?
No.  The difference is that Trump doesn’t mind if you get rich, too.  Biden does.
Too many what ifs. I'd rather just see the election proceed as it is. That's just me though. Why spend energy on an impeachment when they could spend energy on getting Biden elected?
Mail in voting isn’t new. Trump has made up this narrative and his cult is actually believing it. I’m not a Biden fan either, both of these idiots are unfit for the job
Who the hell is voting for Biden? Like seriously.

Nah. The same media puppets who claim Kamala is 1st woc vp candidate also said Kamala was last women candidate when she dropped out &amp; completely ignored the fact Tulsi Gabbard was still in &amp; lasted longer than all but Biden.
Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris Both Support Abortions Up to Birth 😡 Supports Killing Babies “Under Any Circumstance”😡  ABORTRION is MURDER 😡
Find someone’s weak wife to troll hun!  I am NOT the easily persuaded type ! You see! I am an independent woman who survived a perpetrator! I know their kind well! God save us all! Biden isn’t a perp! In fact, our President is one! So f move along ! God save the American women .

It’ll be funny to see the tweets if Trump gets re-elected. It’ll be horrifying to see the economy and life as we know it if Biden gets elected. I’d prefer to go with seeing tweets about Trump.
Biden is already plotting trying to avoid the presidential debate.
You can leave when Trump loses. Biden-Harris 2020
What’s funny is the other side is saying the exact same thing about Biden. It’s almost like it’s a giant pissing match for who can get the most votes or something...
Remember THESE Kamala Harris moments? | Five videos show why the Biden VP is SO unpopular - Glenn Beck
If you think Trump is doing anything on his own you aren't paying attention. So if he can have Pence/Kuchner/McEnany/Barr/Mnuchin/OAN/FOX there behind him propping him up, then it's perfectly acceptable for Kamala to land some punches if Biden is too classy for that.
LOL, Russia is behind the democrats.   3 1/2 years of investigations showed President Trump was not aligned with Rusdia.  But Clinton and Biden are.(Rahm Emanuel, always on top of it)
Good grief!  Really??? You are concerned about Biden reading a script??!!   That is as ridiculous as your “feeling Biden won’t be on the ballot.” Sounds like a threat to a Presidential Candidate...
I am having a rough day.  A rough few days. I can't understand how people can spread BS that they really don't know is true,  and ignore the 🐘 in the room. 45 is an admitted womanizer.  He has more connections to Epstein than anyone.  Yet I see people saying Biden is a pedo.
Suck it up and vote blue. No 3rd party candidate stands a chance, so a vote for anyone else is = a Trump vote. We aren't voting for Biden. We're voting for the people who will come in and make a difference.
I said no, as I’m not kamilla and Biden.  is the better choice. Screw both sides of the swamp lady.
Trump arguably ran one of the strongest economies that we’ve experienced until 4 months ago when this pandemic started world wide.   Democrats also pushed hard for the economy to close but apparently it’s now Trumps fault it took a hit. Biden’s campaign is honestly just a 🤡 show
VP Biden and Senator Harris, have just called for a nationwide mask mandate, while not wearing a mask. They answered a total of 0 questions from reporters after their remarks.
We’ll take the Biden bus but when we reach the end of the line, we will go the rest of the way on foot because there is no bus to a better world.  Those routes have not been laid yet.
Now I know that  is posting all this as an interview for a Biden administration job, which will be sad for all of us.
He must be applying for a job in a Biden administration.
I have a good feeling that he will get one from Biden. Stood up to a corrupt administration and it ruined him. We need to make him whole.
Wow, man. I didn't accuse the previous presidents of being pedophiles. I could with Clinton, because there is evidence. Same with Biden. But I don't have anything on Obama, Bush Sr, W, Reagan, Nixon, etc. I was merely mentioning that prior administrations didn't attack the Cabal.
Fox News is reporting  chances of beating Joe Biden is 29% at this exact time in the race against Hillary in 2016 Trump's chances of beating Hillary was also 29% That speaks volumes! #Trump2020LetsSaveAmerica #Trump2020LandslideVictory #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver

How Kamala Harris Became Biden’s VP Pick | WSJ  via
Joe Biden then and now, the Joe you think you know isn't the one running for president!
I had a thought Kamala Harris would be a smart, right and strategic choice as running mate for Biden a few months ago; Biden exactly did what I had thought. I am also foreseeing the US getting female president after eight or a few more than eight years, if not earlier.
Remember when Kamala Harris said she believed Joe Biden's sexual assault accusers? That was after she called Joe Biden a racist. Phony Kamala.
Favorite quote of the day  nailed it she said  ticket is too far left for even the Reverend Jeremiah wright! She's right Biden Harris wouldn't just bring the chickens home to roost they would bring them home to kill them! #WalkAway  #WalkAwayFromDemocrats
I just personally believe it’s our civic duty to vote and I can’t continue to watch our environment be destroyed, so I’m thrilled with Biden and Bernies environmental plan
Yes team Biden has already printed up the campaign posters! 😂😂
The Biden campaign must have had knowledge of who  was going to pick for his running mate because they didn't waste any time rolling out the new slogan!
Okay twitter fam - how do we feel about Biden picking Kamala Harris for VP? #VPPick
I mean sure, it sucks, but the alternative is Trump. Whereas Biden MAYBE, MAAAYYYYBE, might listen to a left leaning base, and has (albeit half-assed) a more leftward platform, Trump is just gonna send federal agents to throw us in vans.
Ah yes, not wanting Trump again is "rewarding" Biden, yes.
I'm still going to hate vote for Biden/Harris, because another 4 years of Trump is not what this country needs, but we cannot just go back to the slightly left of center status quo with Biden and Harris.  The system gotta go, and be replaced with a better one
Biden didn't pick Klobuchar because of her terrible history as a prosecutor, so he chose Kamala Harris, someone with an equally bad history as a prosecutor.  Very cool
“I believe Biden’s accusers”
"Her tenacious pursuit of justice and relentless advocacy for the people is what is needed right now."
If/When Joe Biden wins, you’ll be looking at Kamala Harris, First Woman President within 4-8 years.
me reading that Biden picked Harris as his running mate
Come on Kamala Harris. Let the narc be Biden’s VP.
More leftist hypocrisy. Right up there with “you can keep your health insurance” and “ they didn’t build that”
Nope. What if one or two are controversial picks? The VP pick will take enough heat, never mind an entire cabinet. The GOP is looking for ANY reason to cast doubt on the strength of Biden’s candidacy. Let’s not give it to them.
You must be blind. Trump will smoke Biden. Cry for another 4 years. #OBAMAGATE
100% chance that Mr. Biden is going to need that "I can't believe I have to say this" thing at the debates
Just saw a Biden commercial.  Lame.  It will only sell to the lemmings.
Cleaning up the 💩💩💩 from 45 will take some time. And of course, what is left of the GOP will be never-ending obstruction and heckling of Biden’s admin - their favorite sport.

If Biden was serious he’d pack the court, but he won’t 4. Again, doubt it 5. ACA is garbage anyways, M4A is the only viable healthcare plan and Biden isn’t touching it with a 10 foot pole 6. Doubt it 7. He has attempted several times over his career to slash SS
Shows what kind of "Catholic " Biden is.  Pro-Abortion with a Anti-Catholic VP pick.
But getting rid of Trump is utterly pointless if we’re replacing him with Joe fucking Biden. It’s useless. It doesn’t matter.
Neither Biden nor Kamala was my first pick, but I’ll take them over Cheeto Face any day
But Biden isn’t going to do anything to roll back any of Trump’s shit, and he’s just gonna be a repeat of the Obama presidency and give us someone even worse than Trump after. Biden doesn’t offer a viable alternative to Trump. This election is pointless
I get it. A vote for Biden means one vote less for Trump. I do not want another 4 years under a Trump Presidency. But you CANNOT ignore what these politicians are doing just because they aren't Trump
I'm optimistic actually. Biden is personally pretty moderate, but his platform will be the most progressive in American history.  More than anything, I'm looking forward to having a cabinet of people who are even vaguely qualified.
oh well im not voting because biden sucks just as bad as Trump does
Bold of you to assume Biden cares about kids in cages
Joe Biden isn’t going in the direction I want

Hoe Biden didn't pick Harris, the Deep State did!
Reade has been proven to be a liar. Her ex never said it was Biden and her friends have abandoned her because she’s a liar and psychotic obviously.
He never said it was Biden.
You do realize Joe Biden has accusations as well? There is no good person on either side. Don’t fool yourself into thinking the DNC is untarnished. The party of the KKK vs. the party of Lincoln.
Is it okay if we admit this race is really between  and  ?  How long after Biden’s president do they invoke the 25th? And they wouldn’t be wrong.
Even if you think Biden would do anything to create effective change, which he won’t (and you’re deluded if you think otherwise), we don’t fucking have time for two slow steps. People are dying and the country is hurling towards catastrophe. We don’t have time for gradualism
Kamala Harris is Biden’s running mate?  Joe will be excited when he finds out...

You’re welcome! Yeah I just kinda don’t wanna exist that much anymore. The whole Biden presidency certainly hasn’t helped
Correct me if I’m wrong but didn’t Kamala call Biden a racist no more than 6 months ago? I guess it’s like Ted Cruz kissing Trump’s ass even though he called his wife ugly.
Trump2020 best president ever!!.biden and Harris.going under Trump2020
Well considering Biden isn’t a rapist...
So you think Biden groped children?
You appear to lack any real human empathy. However, you will probably be a one term potus. Biden could be too, if elected. But please, sir, get some help. Much of America cares about you....it just didn't work out long-term, and you deserve to get well. So do we.  🙏🏼♥️🇺🇸
Hilarious, a 14 month old article. “Seven of the women said Biden's behavior did not amount to sexual harassment or assault.” We now know Tara reade is a lying lunatic.
great pick!  She is going to be a thorn in the gop’s side!  She’ll light up mike pence’s dumbass in a debate!  She’s going to be a hellcat to that lame ass administration. Go Biden/Harris!  Let’s kick some ass in November!

Joe Biden what the fuck
I knew it was coming but man I’m still dying laughing. Kamala Harris and Biden TORE into each other in those debates. Pandering at its finest
2020 will elect Biden/Harris or be our last free election.
Did anyone tell Biden?
At this point Biden could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I would still vote for him.
Biden-Harris 2020.   LFG!
At this point Biden could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I would still vote for him.
Can’t find a video on Trump using the N-Word, but we have Biden saying it in Congress.  And you guys support him. Good luck.
Joe Biden will be waking up from his nappy time and prepare for the big announcement.
your article about pressure mounting for Biden to pick a black woman as a VP – I would like to hear more of this. It makes a lot of sense to me. I was not going to vote for a vanilla ticket, I will, but distastefully. But I believe  sees America now.
Perhaps because it was an accurate description.  Attempting to overthrow the duly elected president. Basis for impeachment was paid for and supported by Hillary, Obama, and Biden.
Whomever Biden picks as VP will be running the country shortly after inauguration   Joe will be resting quietly in the basement
It matters Democrats want that lie spread because if Biden wins he will be removed for medical reasons and his VP will be president
If Trump is so stupid....then why is Biden trying to duck the debates?
I love Mayor Pete but he's be a miserable VP choice for Biden. Hope he lands some spot in the administration though.
Biden is being deliberative. I much prefer that than be rushed like the current moron in the white housed
Zelda, you twit, had your dad done a President Trump routine it’d be okay. Btw, it’s was funny then , funnier now 🤣
Black male leaders warn Biden ‘will lose’ election if he doesn't name Black female running mate. Why does it matter the color of someone’s skin. You don’t vote for someone if they are black or white or brown. You vote on what they stand for. #vote2020

If  does not pick a woman of color as his VP pick, I will not vote for Biden. I will not vote for tRump either, but I will have lost all enthusiasm for him to be far seeing, and being in touch with the people. I will stay home. We’ll never see change.

You repeating the lies about Biden just prove how irrelevant you are to  the conversation.
Question...is Biden really going to be the Democrat nominee??? That’s why he’s not knocking on doors. Who would their nominee be? Sanders? AOC? Michelle Obama? Oprah? It could be anyone.
He works 24 hrs a day while Biden sits in his basement with his handlers.
Biden can’t even string a coherent sentence together. A debate would be the funniest thing I’ve ever seen. I hope it happens and I’ll have my popcorn ready.
What he is trying to say here is that Mr Biden has painted himself into a very tiny corner. Rice, as bad as she is, may be the best of a very pathetic selection.
At this point Biden could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I would still vote for him.

Biden rides a bike, wears a mask, has a sense of humor, and just owned a fox reporter. Seems okay to me.

In fact, Bernie's folks had played a big role in writing the rules of this year's primary.  And as soon as Bernie was no longer leading the delegate count, the fact that Biden didn't have a majority of delegates yet became the leading reason for Bernie to stay in the race.

It's not a perfect platform. And it's fine to point out its inadequacies. But it was the product of a lot of negotiations that pushed it leftward, thanks to a lot of hard work by progressives on the Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force.
let’s look at analyzing things as progressive or conservative instead bc the radical left that trump says biden is is literally still right of center and it’s the incredibly right-skewed party system that makes it seem otherwise
Biden’s rare Ws becoming less rare. His social media team should run the country cause they are killing it.

Help me understand. You withhold your vote from Biden to send a message to the DNC. But is it fair to say it wasn’t the DNC that choose Biden but the voters? Does it send the same message to the voters? What’s the end game? Sincerely asking.
I am not the one to reply to those saying who do I vote for?   That requires an amount of patience I simply don’t have.   To me it’s so obvious, &amp; you asking angers me.  I need to work on this. I don’t give a flip if you hate Trump, and dislike Biden. Get over it!
If people actually cared about having a politician "reduce harm" more people would have acted said no to Biden and forced him to dropout and have Dem endorse somebody else. Unfortunately people didn't, and won't, do that because of this whole rhetoric.

These people are out liars. They have called him every name in the book. The American people just dont believe them. Biden has been an empty suit and been running for President his whole life.
Just a few short months ago Kamala Harris said she believed the six women that accused Biden of improperly touching them. That was “before” she was handed the VP spot. Also intimated in the debates he was a racist.  Now all is good?  Politics.
Patriots, &amp; those that don’t riot, don’t kill cops, don’t burn the American flag, don’t worship China &amp; Russia. Believe in borders. Believe Biden is a wishy washy career political hack now worth millions as a “public servant”. Socialism doesn’t uphold Democracy. It usurps it.

Trump AND Biden?
In an earlier discussion of divisions within the Dem Party, Klein and Yglesias (more or less correctly) note a divide between e.g. Biden and Harris, on the one hand, and, e.g., Sanders, Warren, and AOC, on the other, over how committed they are to our political system as such.
If Trump’s a racist, he’s sure a piss poor one. Now Biden....
Delaware, how many big banks have HQ in Delaware. All show anyway because big banks will be big donors to Biden/Harris. Obviously they aren’t too tough on them. Al, show, no substance.
Learn history Ed. A larger  gov’t makes people smaller.  You’re for a larger Federal Gov’t. It usurps freedom and civil liberties from “the people”. 1A rights already in trouble, censoring dissenting opinion. Now we hear that Biden-Harris will enact Assault Rifle confiscation.
I am thrilled with  but also would have been very happy with any of the candidates on Biden’s short list. When I get down about the future of US, I think about the many honest and capable people in office right now. Our future is bright once we get past Trump era.
Also she literally can’t even get presidency if something happens to Biden because she was born and raised in a foreign country that means her Secretary of State would become president via Nancy Pelosi
Elizabeth Warren strongly supports the Biden-Harris ticket.  As does AOC, fwiw. Real Warren Dems don't try to reelect Trump.
How many employees has Joe Biden paid $20 an hour?
Joe Biden has 8 years to figure this out and many more years in other roles in government. He has had his opportunity. Go be creepy somewhere else Uncle Joe.
Wrong. 1. The majority of progressives voted for Democrats &amp; are part of the base, so disregarding them for Republicans is foolish. 2. AOC stated that in any other country besides the U.S. Biden &amp; her would be in different parties, because of the differences in policies they hold

Oh ok!! I was looking under collections then the Biden Harris collection.
I think they’re wanting a Biden-Harris one. But that’s also a good option!!

This is such common sense. Just now i had a flash of resentment that the Dems (Incl Biden/Harris) didn’t do this when they were last in power. But then I remembered a Senate anachronism called the “Filibuster”. That needs to go. Day One.
I do think that Warren can get more done as, say Sec of Treasury than as VP.  It will be very interesting to see what Biden's cabinet looks like.
Well put. Kamala was far from my first choice (for president or VP), but she was also far from my last. If Biden had made his choice before George Floyd's murder, my guess is it would have been Klobuchar, and that would have been terrible.
Biden and Harris are not as progressive as the folks I'd have most liked to see on the ticket, but progressives who are responding to Harris getting the nod by denouncing Biden and Harris aren't just arguing against the Democratic ticket, they're arguing against Warren and AOC.
My hope is Beto is in the Biden cabinet if they win

Nah Biden is his equal. Only thing is he actually has experience. Vote for libertarian
It started with more voters pulling the lever for Biden than for any of the progressive alternatives. Until we on the left of the party can convince more voters to support our candidates, the corporate donors will keep getting their candidates on the ticket.
Voting for anyone besides Biden is a vote for Trump, and a vote for Trump is a vote for racism, hate, queerphobia, etc. It is what it is, don’t vote 3rd party.

I always wondered what I was missing? Find me someone who can tell me she isn’t a better candidate to beat Trump than Biden or Bernie
So, are we just going to ignore the fact that Biden just picked a VP candidate that believes he is a racist. And stands with his sexual assault accusers?
Can we honestly hold this against her if we don’t hold Biden accountable for his alleged pedophelia or Trump for his supposed philandering?
I will be voting for Biden. I do want safety for my children and all children, with affordable housing and programs to help those who are struggling. I want my children to grow up safe AND compassionate, working as a community to insure everyone can live a happy, healthy life.

I guess I’ll hold my nose and vote for Biden and Harris, but Jesus what a grim state of affairs.   Eventually the constant capitulation to the right by Democrats is going to result in even more dangerous right-wingers like Tom Cotton having a shot at POTUS, and that’s terrifying
You hear it a lot: "I like Joe Biden because he is a moderate."  Biden just chose a VP candidate that has a more progressive voting record than the "radical" leftist/socialist/Marxist Bernie Sanders.
I’m sorry if that sounded rude or short. Im not feeling well right now and I apologize. When the Biden camp says he wants a woman of color as his VP, that screams AA. They aren’t looking for the best, they’re pandering for votes.
The vote is going to be so close that any vote not for Biden, is a vote for Trump. A libertarian is not going to swing enough votes their way to win. Sorry.

So is ok if Biden is racist and sexist. We’re to overlook that. Got it.
Ultimately polls and poll analysis shouldn't affect what we do or what the outcome is. I'll certainly do what I can (campaign at a distance, donate, vote) to help Biden win. What percentage chance you or I or Nate Silver thinks Biden has of winning is not of great consequence. 4/
Polling is imperfect. Poll analysis more so. But both are better than your or my gut feeling that "Biden is doing twice as well as Hillary on her best day." 3/
Now Trump, again, has a very small chance of winning. But, again, most folks don't want to / can't manage to think probabilistically about this. So, again, we want to deny what we can actually say about the likelihood of Trump or Biden winning. 2/
Apparently there is a 1.5% chance that Biden dies before Inauguration Day
I stayed out of the Veep Wars bec: 1) it's the Vice goddam Presidency; 2) only one person gets to pick the VP nominee and that one person was and is Joe Biden, so arguing about it on Twitter is a total waste of time; 3) they seemed almost designed to drive wedges between Dems. 5/
Like me, the vast majority of Bernie primary voters in 2016 voted for Hillary in November. And, of course, the vast majority of Warren Democrats will be voting for Biden/Harris. And many of us will be working to make sure they win. Because it's damn important. 3/
I love that you're discounting the fact that Biden is Catholic while SIMULTANEOUSLY counting his presence as a Catholic on the 2008 and 2012 Democratic tickets.  10/10, very Christian of you
Heard of Tara Reade? How about when Biden’s own VP candidate said he was a racist?
Joe Biden picking a moderate VP candidate so Republicans don't call her a far-left radical
Shouldn't you be phone-banking for Biden/Harris? Don't you want them to win? Get to work, buddy.
It’s funny how Kamala Harris called Biden racist now she is his VP, I wonder if that question will ever come up, probably not though because she is a democrat and it’s not part of the mainstream media’s narrative that something like that ever happened
So Biden has the American Communist Party endorsing him and now the Chinese Communist? Whose next Kim Jong-Un and Nicklas Maduro?  Sure glad Joe’s a “moderate”.  I get it, Joe’s a “moderate” Communist. Not a hard core one.
If Biden wins, we know who the first female President will be.

Kamala Harris Is the Future, So Mike Pence May Well Be History
The progressive wing of the party lost the nomination and we need to figure out how to win it next time, but throwing a fit and taking our toys and going home accomplishes nothing. The policy concessions Biden's made to Warren and Sanders are worth more than the Vice Presidency.
That loud minority of my fellow #WarrenDemocrats who would've been enthusiastic about a Biden-Warren ticket but who now denounce the entire Democratic Party needs to rethink their politics.  You know who _is_ enthusiastic about Biden-Harris?
But Biden’s ok? Guess that’s what watching CNN and MSDNC get your. Certainly not the news. They show you clips of him 5 years ago.  There’s a very good reason he’s always hiding.
Cognitive dissonance? Yes, Biden shows that all the time.
When you reach 60, most physicians give you a memory test of some kind routinely. If you were older, you would know that.  Compared to Biden, Trump has perfect memory. Either you haven’t heard Joe ( I know the media’s been covering for him) or you are in denial, Joe has dementia.
Some Trumper just tried to argue that since Harris lost badly in the Democratic primaries, Biden choosing her for VP has "shown blatant disregard to the American voters" by picking her.  Seriously. 🙄
Sure, lots to list. Only have so many digits. A Biden Presidency would be a disaster. He’s sold out to Bolshevik Bernie. Good luck convincing America that he’s a moderate now. And wasn’t that the reason he was selected in the first place, Biden wasn’t a radical?
I’m voting for more than just Biden and Harris. I’m voting for the government they’ll build.

Did you see Biden with the construction guy and the AR 14 or whatever comments 6 or so months ago?  They are both unhinged old men.
Trump stopped flights from China on 1/31 before one person in US had died. Biden called him xenophobic for doing so. Makes you wonder how much longer it would have taken Joe to stop flights?  Dr Fauci said that Trump’s early response saved thousands of lives.
I’m pretty sure she locked up tons of people as a federal prosecutor for pot, then went on a radio show and bragged about how she smoked it in college while listening to snoop and dre, who weren’t making music when she was in college. Oh and she called Biden a sexual predator 🤷🏻‍♂️
You’re not paying attention. Biden adopted most of Crazy Bernie’s Socialist platform. The Party can’t get to Socialism fast enough. Many liberals will have some soul searching to do before they vote for this radical ticket.
People have been criticizing the length of BIden's VP process, but there's a pretty good chance that if he'd selected his running mate back when Sanders conceded (that is, before George Floyd's murder), he may well have picked Klobuchar, who'd have been much worse than Harris.
The president of the USA is projecting when he says Biden committed treason. Horrible thing to accuse anyone of, particularly when the accuser has committed treason, or so it would appear. But I agree with you, Trump is profoundly vile and dangerous. He needs to be removed NOW.
And you’re voting for Biden? Trump is Einstein compared to Joe Biden.
The systemic issues that plague our country will continue to persist if we do not hold every single individual operating under these systems to a higher standard. I will vote for Biden but you must have me fucked up if you think I’m not gonna trash his uninspired status-quo bs.

Should be hard for the Trumpettes to criticize her on "law and order" grounds since she is a former DA. I think she will bring some unique perspectives to the ticket that will be much appreciated during these turbulent times.  I am so happy with Biden's selection of Kamala!
I don’t hate her, I will likely vote for her and biden, however, her character hurts me.
Will go well with "Biden wants to defund the police" claims....  🙄
“As progressives, we have got to think strategically. We’ve got to do everything we can to get Biden elected.”   This nation cannot take another 4 yrs of a Trump presidency. Hear Bernie’s message. It’s time to embrace #progressivesforbiden
Yawn, your boring as shit, and your scared of Harris because you know you’ll lose. If it was Susan rice you woulda had a chance but now you know Biden’s poll numbers are going to shoot up a lot
biden was actually gonna make me his vp but he couldn’t get on board with my idea to make all star by smash mouth the national anthem and i couldn’t get on board with his blatant sexism, racism, and love for cops
Me: BURN THE RICH START THE REVOLUTION  Also me: crying tears of joy as I vote Biden Harris into office
Less than two years ago Biden said “the poor kids are just as bright as the white ones” and somehow I’m supposed to believe he’s socialy progressive.
Former VP and Senator Joe Biden has chosen Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate. In other news, it is sunny, hot, and humid in Norman, Oklahoma right now.
In Historic Pick, Joe Biden Taps Kamala Harris To Be His Running Mate
Oh look Biden’s announcement do Harris for vp and the scared little trumps come running with all their bullshit
Of course, in 2020, in the middle of the BLM protests, crime bill author Biden picks the cop.
Biden/Harris huh? I guess at this point lmao
Now get those Biden harris sticks printed so I can slap one somewhere
I’m fine with it. Warren was the best choice, but Harris is ok. She’s not the worst person out there, and sures up a bunch of Biden’s problems
I knew that if Joe Biden picked a Black woman as his running mate, she would represent the top 1% just as well as any white woman ever could.
I didn't think Biden would choose the actual worst VP candidate but here we are
It’s Kamala. I’m good with that.
She literally sold T-shirts attacking Biden’s history on race during the primaries.   How the turntables
I am perfectly fine with Harris as the VP choice. Then again, I'd have been perfectly fine with any of the VP candidates who Biden was considering. It's just the Vice Presidency.
I am* Biden's VP pick.  DM for interviews.
As long as Biden isn't picking Bass, we're good.  Hard pass on throwing away Florida from the get-go.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, a lot of Obama administration veterans (e.g. the crowd behind Crooked Media) have expressed a preference for Rice. Their voices are pretty easily amplified. But I don't necessarily expect their preferences to make that much difference to Biden.
Agreed.  But also seems like there's an effort to make stuff meaningful that's pretty minor.  There's not a whole lot of change in the WI polls.
Everyone is trying to coax out something meaningful in pretty minor changes.  I'm more interested in what's up with the Emerson poll showing Biden only +2 in MN.
Everyone when the Biden team tells us to “text ‘First’ to 30330”
Though I'll give partial credit to VP Selection Process concern trolls who base their concern on the fact that these are extraordinary times so Biden should not follow a perfectly normal VP selection process. At least they admit that nothing out of the ordinary is going on here.
Veepstakes Speculation Twitter is among the emptiest Twitters. And the emptiest genre of Veepstakes Speculation Twitter is concern-trolling Biden's utterly unremarkable (beyond the promise to select a woman) VP selection process.
Do you think “Mother” will have to be next to Pence when he debates the female VP that Biden chooses?
what do you think about biden then since he’s a catholic?
I’d like to think positive. Biden isn’t giving me much hope. They need to debate.
What a totally deceived &amp; evil statement! The opposite is true. Being a true Christian &amp; supporting the Biden doctrine is impossible. #Trump2020Landslide
Big deal! Trump is sharp as a tack! I wouldn’t trust demented Biden to watch my dog!
I wouldn’t trust Biden to watch my dog!!! The man is demented! Give me a break. Stop watching #FAKENEWSCNN
Did I miss the Biden/Imminent press conference?
Any reporting Joe by you or MSDNC of Ukraine prosecutors listing Joe Biden as a “criminal suspect” in the firing of Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin? Whether you agree with it or not, the fact that Biden is makes it newsworthy right? Why is negative Biden news ignored?
Joe Biden confidently explaining that a gay is basically a woman, so he's kept his promise.
It cost money on my phone to text biden. They ask me for money daily
We need more than a new FBI building,  we NEED new FBI agents! Ones that will honor their oaths and never turn against their own country and people, like  the ones under Obama and Biden did.
Whatever Trump has said, next to Biden he will look like a Nuclear Physicist.  Isn’t there some “Elder abuse” laws that should protect Joe from such exploitation? Poor man.
Biden said that? That’s pretty good for him. He’s said that Covid has killed 125 million Americans, that 150 million Americans have been killed by firearms since 2007, and that he’s running for the US Senate. Dementia is a dreaded disease.
He's working for free! He donates all his pay checks to charities. It's the people like Biden that have made fortunes off of stealing from the American people.  Made his entire family rich too. Selling America out to China!
ACA punished people for being poor. One of less than 5 good Trump deeds was wiping out that mandate. Biden wants to bring it back.
Did you catch what Biden said about blacks the other day? Said they had w/few exceptions, no diversity of thought, unlike Latinos. Just one racist in the race, and it ain’t Trump.
He speaks fine. I’d put him up against Obama any day, w/o teleprompters. And Biden?  oh my. I think Joe’s going for the sympathy vote.
Biden was announced at 2 am
Folks, I gotta come clean: its me. I've been catfishing Joe Biden pretending to be Elizabeth Warren's 3rd cousin Barbara Little Bear for almost 2 years now and now I'm the vice president
Biden/McGraw 2020.
BIDEN PICKED BRIAN KELLY AS HIS VP!?!?!?
I don’t care who he picks. All are good choices. I’m voting Biden 2020.
GOP racist for calling out Marxist cop killers, rioters?Dems running a racist Joe Biden for President. Trump will get record number of blacks voting for him this fall. Dems  give them terrible schools, bad neighborhoods, no future, no hope. Been doing it for yrs.  Nothing changes
That’s great for Biden, but where will you be giving your concession speech? I don’t want to miss it.
Another county for your Election Night watchlist is Cherokee. If Cherokee swings towards the Dems in any meaningful way (around 42% or so), rural Okla may swing a little, too.  No, Biden isn't winnning Coal Co, but it may help show the decrease in votes for the Pres we expect.
However, with this in mind, if Biden really is 6-8% ahead in Okla Co... the 4 Democratic candidates for County office are almost certainly going to win.  Election night - for Pres - might not be exciting statewide but seeing how Biden is doing in Okla Co is going to be the story.
Joe Biden-Roger Stone unity ticket
If Biden had been, it would have been higher. Those “experts” that you deem always right early on predicted a death toll of 2 Million from Covid.I don’t recall Republicans blaming Obama for Swine Flu. Shows you how diabolical the Dems are. They wanted a recession to get rid of DT
Sorry but Trump disassociated himself from Epstein, unlike Clinton and others. Have you not see the creepy photos of Biden and kids?
We have enough voters who elected Biden as VP who can elect him as POTUS. Just gotta make sure they show up!   #votelouder
If you do this for what the true percentage of white, college educated voters will likely be, it's Biden +9. Still a healthy lead, but +13 is kinda the equivalent of figuring a batting average that excludes at bats where the batter struck out.
For a press conference? Hardly. You are kidding yourself if you think Biden doesn’t have serious dementia. The media is dishonest for covering it up. Biden’s hiding.
Oh, ok, giving the eulogy at Dem Sen Robt Byrd in 2010, a former  Klansman is not racist? Biden’s ‘94 Crime Bill put thousands of blacks in prison.Biden talks down to blacks, that is a form of racism. Be glad to compare what DT has done for blacks, versus 8 yrs of Obama-Biden.
And Biden gets a teleprompter at his last presser.
Joe Biden and real leadership?
“It shows, once again, that this election is all about Trump. And for as much as he tries to make it a choice between him and Biden, for this group, it’s a referendum.”
Biden has a lot less gaffes so that’s why so many Dems are advising him to stay in his bunker and not debate?  Right.

Robin Williams' decade-old comedy bit about 'rambling' Joe Biden goes viral after Democratic candidate's gaffes
Biden finally picked his VP
Go to bed Simone no one cares what you say biden has been in bed for hours
You were an baffoon on Steve Hilton... you are angry you were fired, there was nothing your said that said Biden was better... sry you are a joke!
And CNN, MSDNC, ABC, CBS AND NBC are apologists and defenders of everything Democrat. With 90% of the media acting as an arm of the DNC, your concerns about Fox are laughable. Be glad to count the pro Biden Dems on Fox versus pro-Trump Repubs appearing on those other networks.
If they have a good reason, like needing to rearrange their sock drawer on November 3rd, those potential Biden voters probably not going to find time to go to the polls. So yeah, enthusiasm for Joe is lacking a bit.
🎉#WINNING!#KAG2020✝️🇺🇸 National Polls: Biden's Lead Over Trump Shrinks to 3pts.
Hey, Bolshevik Bernie, Trump CANNOT cancel rent, because the U.S. is still a Constitutional Republic. That's private property. Your ilk has to win on Nov. 3 to make everything the property of the State. BTW, good luck with Biden as your champion.
Remember, if you don’t vote Biden, “you ain’t black.” 😂
Truth Is, Biden Never Had a Firm Grip on Reality.🤪🤡

Comfortably safely center in America is smack dab on the right and I don’t think I should have to pretend I’m comfortable in the center. No one else on the face of the planet would call Joe Biden or 80% of our Democrats centrists. In most other nations they’re on the right.
I doubt he’d call his own father a pedophile and fascist but yeah I’m sure he loathed Biden as much as I do. I’m not signing up for either sports team they both suck.
I’m most definitely criticizing bigger issues. I am not a fan of the majority of the Democratic Party. I blame the party for constantly bending over backwards and basically letting republicans drag our entire country to the right. I know biden isn’t all bad.
Then why are we virtue signaling? Fuck em both. I understand what you’re saying but you and I both know my audience is well aware of where I stand. If I was speaking to someone on the fence I’d tell them to vote biden but I wouldn’t sugar coat it.
Biden’s nose would’ve got way too excited😂
Historically, democrats easily get over 50% of the vote in these states. Biden isn’t reaching that, based on this data, and Trump is polling unrealistically far below what he got in 2016. Easily flawed and biased.
I don’t think it will matter whether we are ready or not. But, IMHO, it won’t happen. I DON’T think he will be as lucky as Nixon. I doubt Joe Biden will pardon Trump.
I bet Biden announces his pick , the day ole Donnie accepts the nomination!
Anyone Biden picks , I’m supporting
Oh my.  Starting to believe that a good portion of Biden votes will be “sympathy” votes. Not why we elect Presidents America.
That seems to be their mindset.  Also Joe Biden briefly rode a bicycle today and we're all supposed to be excited about it, so there's that.
I'm supposedly a Russian for pointing out that Putin uses reverse psychology and people fell for it? What would you guys even do with yourselves if Putin "endorsed" Biden? Lol, so pathetic.
With Pelosi,Schumer, Schiff, Nadler, and Biden, Democrats already look bad.
I’m pretty sure he’s not voting for Biden lol
China is involving themselves in election interference in our elections this fall. Word is they want Joe Biden to beat Trump. Why is this the least surprising news this week?
I'm sure the way forward is to further subcategorize people based on skin color, male/female, etc.  This used to be called racism &amp; sexism.  If Harris is truly a finalist for VP candidate, esp w/ Biden's impending collapse, then competency surely isn't a req'd trait.
Hey my man, BLM and ANTIFA just came out in the open in Norman, Oklahoma. Booth set up outside mall flying BLM and ANTIFA flags. Plus Biden flags. I have pics and video if you like!
🚨The Biden Swap That Should Concern John Durham
Team Biden: Respecting the health of the public and their campaign staff during a pandemic.  Team Trump: Not so much.
Biden - Robin Williams video is viral - yet it showed up #7 on my YouTube search.  Anti-Trump videos were ahead of it.  Not to mention - the Libtards at YouTube deleted the remainder of the Williams video.  This is what Woke Nazis do.
No one had to die? Biden criticized  Trump for stoppping flights from China on 1/31 before one American had died from Covid. More would have died under Biden. The “experts” that you value so much had early predictions of 2 MILLION Americans dying from Covid-19. Wise up.
Yeah when biden announces his running mate  biden will see his numbers drop
Once again, as in the "I take a cognitive test every day" comment, Fox News takes Biden completely literally, even though it's obvious to everyone else that Biden is trolling them.
"Just nab any old black person -- they're all pretty much interchangeable," Biden reportedly told his aides. "That Stacey chick, the Kamala cop lady, heck, get Denzel Washington for all I care. Any of them are fine. And poor VP candidates are almost as bright as white ones."
You’re so cute for continuing to believe that Biden’s gaffes are in any way comparable to Trump’s repeatedly stated intent.
What about Biden saying he wouldn't trust a vaccine because it's from Trump?  LMHO!!🤣🤣🤣
"Go away."  She has as much right to run for president as Biden or Trump.  But, of course, you do not believe in rights - which are what the Libertarian party is about.
uh y'all outta check out the profile on this guy... yes, he dunks on biden, but he's not your friend
BIDEN IS PICKING TOM IZZO AS HIS VP?!?!?!?!
The manner in which Joe Biden has dealt with personal tragedy has been reason enough for me to vote for and support a man of such courage and dignity.
Nope, pretty sure those taxes are going right back on the top 1%. As far as crushing the economy, seems your daddy crushed the one Obama/Biden gave him.
Calling out Biden for saying all black people think alike and then saying that he doesn’t deserve the collective “black vote” is just... pretty spot on for 2020
#REDCHINA &amp; #Iran both support Biden.
Excellent article on Biden's options for VP.  I'm still on #TeamDuckworth'The Five' slam Biden, Harris for dodging questions after dropping mask ...  via
Biden should know about the cages. Him and his buddy  built them.
With Biden in charge that will drop to zero. He will let them have anything they want
Older voters must’ve wanted Biden because they trusted him when with Obama. Idk lol I’m not in that demographic group 😂🤷🏽‍♂️
I’m fully aware what dense means. LA, Boston, Detroit, all densely populated cities with nowhere close to the failure rate of Cuomo. Biden lied his way into politics by claiming he had 2 more degrees than he had and said he was top of the class when he was bottom 25%. They all do
No matter what you do to the #postoffice I am voting for Biden.
I can’t get over the fact that his team posted about “continuing his important work” and then immediately tweeted about the Biden campaign being “nuts...”
Biden really said “Man, people don’t want to vote for me? Watch this drive” and shit himself in the foot with his VP choice pushing even more people away from voting for him 🥴🥴
That biden Harris ticket is socialism
The U.S. is in the middle of a perfect storm: COVID-19, murders, the fight for civil rights and justice, birthing the era of the BLM movement with the greater plague-the Trump Admin. All of this: Still, we will rise; we will recover. A strategic God w/Biden &amp; Harris leading US.
Yehhhh Kamala: V.P Elect. Thank you Joe Biden for your pic; a sweet strategic move. May God bless you both and these United States of America as we journey down the road to recovery. It will take time but we will get there; we will recover.

What did tRump do for CA. Make a choice: Biden or tRump?
Nah different electorate. More young voters. And more angry voters than in 2016. The pandemic. The mass protests. More Gen-Z voters. And Hillary was Astronomically more hatable than Biden. Biden just seems more stupid gaffs than evil.
And if COVID-19 didn’t escalate to this point, trump would’ve won easily. Now he’s facing a rising death toll and is forced to fund Obamacare because they had no plan up until this point. Biden is riding the protests and pandemic to election.
And Biden supported the crime bill (which increased budgets for policing nationwide). Tell me again how Biden is a crazy Marxist that wants to defund the police?? If anything trump is making a good law and order case for Biden 😂
Let’s get to work! I’m excited to elect the first female VP!
Now get those Biden harris sticks printed so I can slap one somewhere
You mean Joe Biden was informed he received a running mate?
What a totally deceived &amp; evil statement! The opposite is true. Being a true Christian &amp; supporting the Biden doctrine is impossible. #Trump2020Landslide
If Biden doesn't pick a mixed-race transgender I'm not voting for him.
I will vote for Joe Biden, no matter WHO he picks.

You were an baffoon on Steve Hilton... you are angry you were fired, there was nothing your said that said Biden was better... sry you are a joke!
Not all Biden supporters are pedos, but all of them decided groping children isn’t a deal breaker.
I don’t think it will matter whether we are ready or not. But, IMHO, it won’t happen. I DON’T think he will be as lucky as Nixon. I doubt Joe Biden will pardon Trump.
You must be getting your numbers from Biden.
Yeah when biden announces his running mate  biden will see his numbers dropThe media is wanting Biden to win so they will have control back.
She better learn what to say since according to her Biden is a sexual deviant. She said she believes he has committed sexual misconduct to several women.
Yes. He has no respect for the American people. We should have the right to make an informed decision. That’s why I’m voting for Trump. Biden must be trying to cover something up.
Now apologize for all the lies you’ve told on the President.And be honest about the bigoted Mr Biden.
Senator Kennedy On Harris Becoming Biden’s VP Pick: She’s AOC ‘Without The Bartending Experience’
He’s proven once that he can grow the economy like never before.  He will do it again.  Biden will kill the economy with his policies.  How do you not know that?
Because they’re retarded, John, it’s really that simple. Biden +7/10 is as good as its going to get no matter what.
Who running for president her or biden it sounds more like her
saying this with my full chest, I don’t like Biden or Kamala. but am i still gonna vote for this ticket because it’s the only shot to get trump out of office? 100%. and also, fuck jo jorgensen:)
Well, TBH Biden would say more twisted stuff if he could just remember, you know, that thing.
I heard that yesterday &amp; immediately thought-Baier misunderstood what the Judge was saying. Idk if she’s right, but I believe I know what she meant. Not that the D party would change their support of him, but that Biden would be unable to fulfill the role (medical/health reasons)
Because IF Biden wins, were going to go into a depression.  Hopefully neither happen.
Hey Tom, how’s Biden’s taint taste?  You’ve been there for a while now.
Biden will need to set up a 500 man task force to investigate &amp; prosecute THE TRUMP MOB! After CORVID, &amp; the economy...we need to clean up our NATIONAL DISGRACE created by the Republicans!
I will feel REBORN when we win back our country &amp; conquer COVID! It is in our hands...we have the team &amp; we have the power! GO BIDEN-HARRIS!
It was stupid for Biden to pick Kamala Harris as his running mate. In retrospect, the voters didn't want Harris as their president, much less their VP. LOL JUst wow!
Yet you vote for Biden who pushed a crime bill that incarcerated millions of black men. Anyone who votes for that racist and yells "Black Lives Matter" at the same time needs their head examined.
The best Kamala joke I’ve heard so far is this.  “Joe Biden picked her as his running mate”.  The punchline is subtle, but it’s funny as hell.
That might be the only person on this planet who would get me to vote against Biden
like why are they choosing to say oh well biden sniffs people like okay cool yeah he’s creepy but 43 women haven’t come forward saying he raped or sexually assaulted them!
Do you still think Biden is a racist?? What changed your mind please let us know.
Did he finally pick someone???? And seriously picked Kampala Harris?? The only way Biden can win is by cheating for sure!
So Biden’s years of racist politics &amp; bad political decisions don’t matter because- they’re the past, things change. But you think Trump supporters will just make excuses for anything bad he’s said or done. Got it.
There’s nothing safe about the Democratic agenda. Joe Biden might not be the most extreme, but his party is becoming that way &amp; that’s who he’ll be surrounded by. Biden has 30 years of showing us political bad decisions.
Suppose there’s another Supreme Court nomination come up in the next 4 years- Biden isn’t going to nominate anyone that a Republican would be ok with. My family is doing better economically with Trump. Not to say the pandemic didn’t hurt everyone, but we’re recovering.
Let's hope Biden immediately sets up a shadow government! With hundreds of people interacting on video meetings in their various areas planning their programs. On day one we HAVE to have a REVOLUTION!

No matter how you feel about Trump, how can any Republican feel good about voting in Biden? *also, people always forget the swindlers in this story. The Emperor was vain, but he was fooled by the Swindlers. Who are the swindlers? You? You certainly sang his praises.

I hope these debates happen. Joe Biden owes the American people some kind of clue as to what he stands for. Americans should not have to blindly trust a possible President. It should be illegal. He doesn’t respect Americans enough to come out and say something he should be barred
Here is a solution it is still legal for me to be on ballot as independent party candidate look it up F Trump and F Biden
Not to discount Biden’s ability to make me laugh with his Corn pop or hairy leg stories...
Biden won’t come out to talk and when he does all he can do is insult people
I would return the stimulus is the election is done properly. If Biden was to be president our future generations will grow up in  communist or socialist country. Our children and grandchildren’s entire way of life is at stake. He could turn this country inside out in one term
Biden should decline to debate TRUMP because TRUMP is unable to coherently discuss reality.
