China working against Trump's reelection, while Russia spreads disinformation on Biden: Director of National Intelligence
I think the ones being led by the Moron Caucus is going to die eventually. They don't believe science, masks, medical experts or anything.  And Trump is happily killing off not only his base, but his own party's at the same time. lol
He's either selectively ignorant, politically stupid, woefully insane, or is just fucking up so bad that he's trying to claim any kind of credit from his predecessor.  I don't think Trump realizes how outclassed he is on the issues we now face as a nation.
Also, Culp has admitted in his interview to voting for Donald Trump. If we get  for WA Governor, we are going to become the next Florida when it comes to COVID-19 management. It will become a shitshow. A disaster.

I‚Äôm seriously afraid if you don‚Äôt come up with a temporary extension or an agreement soon, then Trump will pull some executive shit or try to and people will think he‚Äôs some sort of hero. Don‚Äôt help him get re-elected.

Swearing.  Went about 7 years without cursing (never wanted the grandkids to hear it) but they just pour out now.  Between Covid and Trump I have had almost as much as I can take.
&amp;these poor fools don't even realize that they are being used by trump. üò¢
Dear trump supporters: He really does believe you all have brains no bigger than gnats. An executive order to protect pre-existing conditions which is already the law under the Affordable Care Act?  Please tell me not right about your brains.
The parents of the 3 kids  in the room waiting for trump to speak, should be charged with child abuse for making them watch an obviously drugged up kook.  Unless they were trying to provide a real life reason to "just say no to drugs" üòú
Wow, Trump's news conference was full of executive orders such as cutting out Big Pharma middlemen, and assuring that our country cannot be charged more for drugs than any other country. He was on fire!
I would hope not, then again some black people STILL support trump! Who knows what‚Äôs to come in the fall.
I thought about sending trump campaign an audition recording for inauguration 2017, but I think he got no-talent pretty well covered.
trump....I will be doing a news conference on the ChinaVirus, the just announced very good economic numbers, at 7pm.  It's 7:23PM mr trump....and you are still not at the podium at your golf course.

Trump votes absentee. Vote by mail is a large undertaking for any state. It takes years of planning to implement. It simply can‚Äôt be done this late.
It's a CYA move. He doesn't want to be associated with Trump when the empire falls.
Absolutely nothing. Just like Trump.
After every statement admitted Rapist Donald Trump should resign. So he can be put in jail.
We really should not give this idiot any press. He only says things that echo trump.

Legal Marijuana has been slowly creeping across the country for 7 years &amp; is about to make it self legal on the federal level The us is the last major country without universal healthcare &amp; that's going to happen as well It's an eventual thing The Dems just handed it ALL to Trump
Oh, sure, put it in a bathroom, man goes to piss, looks up and sees trump, shits while standing. I recommend a broom closet or tool shed.
I wouldn't put it past trump &amp; cronies to put out a totally useless "vaccine" in the last half of October.
Trump has decided that nobody is getting any stimulus money because he doesn't want to help those who are hurting or the blue states that didn't vote for him.  Does anyone want to hedge bets on how long he'll hold out before he caves in and signs the bill?
And pro-war healthcare for profit sociopaths are nothing close to real Democrats let alone "centrists" It's pretty well documented that Trump donates to the clintons and the Clintons donated to Trump Wake up people
So...since Trump wants to be a dick again by denying the country much needed stimulus money (because he doesn't want to spend any helping people), I can't get get flea control, or do anything with my books at the moment.  This man is pure evil.

trump has convinced me.....I won't vote by mail. Instead, I will drive the 4 blocks to the Snohomish County Elections Board provided secure  box at the Mukilteo Public Library and drop my ballot there.
I thought Trump lived the poorly educated, though?
You trying to spin millions of people on unemployment as a success is rich.  You trying to spin people who have lost their jobs because of Trump's failed pandemic response and then being called back to work as "jobs created" is equally as rich.
Trump stares into the sun during an eclipse and thought we delivered "F-52s", which only exist in the video game Call of Duty, to Norway.  He has also told more publicly documented lies than any other president in this country's history.
Look at you trying to pretend like you're not a Trump supporter.  People like you and Trump are why I became an Atheist.

So am I reading this right? Trump has inadvertently banned video games in America with his illegal executive order against Tik Tok and Tencent?

If not corrupt, not unlikely to have manifested flawed information processing methods. Just like Trump, people don't usually go that astray unexpectedly, but instead manifest the behavior over many years (as seen in creationists, for example), the lethal reaping from that sowing.
You guys actually believe he wants it gone because of China? Trump wants it gone because thousands of people banned together on tiktok and bought tickets to his rally, making him think it was gonna be full and even building seating outside, and then they didn‚Äôt show up.
Very Meta of them ... and also very time wasting.  But they might also be just a one trope pony, and will berate and bluff to avoid ever clarifying or applying their alleged knowledge to anything that can be pinned down objectively.  Donald Trump does this on a political level.
The ignorance of the jack boots who did this will be an additional example of Trump stupidity recorded for posterity.üò¢ü§¢
I have NEVER, not once in my life, considered having a gun. Until Portland. Until Seattle (I‚Äôm 4-5 hours from each). So until Trump, no. Now, yes.
Trump is not able to understand humanity and will only do what gets him attention-no matter how deplorable and narcissistic.ü§¢
He'll be every bit as bad as Trump.  Just watch the incedibly partisan hacks destroy him.  He'll be called at least a nazi and my followers won't step in cause winning is the most important thing
Facebook and the US Government can actually severely screw you over by having cart-blanche access to this kind of data, that's the main diff.  Decades of eroding civil liberties makes the entire Trump argument transparent.
This is the genius main stream media told us at the beginning of 2019 was most likely to beat Trump.  The Democrats had some great candidates this year, but they didn't kow tow to the party elite.  So we get Pedo Joe.  #GiantMeteor2020 end it all please
Can't Trump make them?? Don't let them get off.
"ObamaCare already does this!"  Trump's been trying to take that apart piece by piece and pushing to cover pre-existing conditions has been a political winner for Democrats.  Important to remember that an EO can be overturned with another EO, but an EO can't undo part of a law.
Trump is out Golfing (w/his donors waiting around to throw money at him)! While many Americans are Ill, going Hungry, &amp; are facing Homelessness! Eric Swalwell: "Nancy Pelosi is working tonight!" BUT, Trump's "people don't know a damn thing about what's going on in our country."

Jan is objectively a Tortucan here, since Trump did in fact tweet that &amp; explicitly denied responsibility for anything going wrong with his Covid-19 policy (it was on tape). That Jan would stonewall deny that says all you need to know about how loony &amp; intractable Trumpistas are.
It‚Äôs my understanding, Trump is going to bypas Congress with an executive order to get this passed.
Could be. *Or* maybe, just maybe, a lot of people regardless of their party preference realize how genuinely terrible Trump is at this job.
Trump was likely in fine spirits because (a) he gets a rush from the crowds cheering him (&amp; never fact checking him), plus (b) all the staff following him likely pumped a bit more money into the Trump coffers at the elite golf club he owns.
It's completely haphazard. He's missed some key battleground states, he's registered for some safe states (mostly Trump states) and he's filed in a few likely narrow margin states.  Feels very scattershot overall.
trump was talking with xi about his great deal..daily?..weekly??
im aware  doesnt take away from the fact that either due to incompetence or neglect or sabotage trump ignored warnings from intel and we really only had one shot at containment in the beginning  but the plan was always to let it wash over us imo

Since the ACA (never repealed nor replaced) contains that provision already, will Trump be issuing Executive Orders to decree we have Social Security, that there be a Brooklyn Bridge, and that the Sun rises in the East?
Incorrect.  But it may be stipulated that you may actually believe all that.  Most of the country doesn't.  We the People will be giving Trump (and so many of his enablers in public office) our job review.  Our Apprentice President has let the Republic down &amp; deserves firing.

That's an easy one: Trump's actually a terrible businessman, especially outside his limited experience area of catering to rich people whose checkbooks can help him gloss over the financial realities of being self-proclaimed prestige properties.
Trump and his cronies live in a very insular privileged bubble, with a childish disconnect from the reality of lives they know only as photo op imagery, in turn corrupted by Trump's insatiable Dunning-Kruger narcissism whereby he must always be right and superior.

That is funny "They can't look the other way" they sure as hell did when Trump said "Grab them by the pussy".
6.) In his Aug. 5 remarks on the  mass shootings in Ohio and Texas, Trump pointed to his administration‚Äôs record of prosecuting people who have violated federal gun laws. ‚ÄúLast year, we prosecuted a record number of firearms offenses,‚Äù he said.

Our national response to a national emergency has been pathetic and trump apologists are equally pathetic.
They are privately companies and can set what rules they want as long as they treat everyone the same. They have bent over backwards allowing trump to lie continuously. Taking up a seat in Congress and yet don't know how the Constitution works. Shame on you.

Will Biden debate Trump
But in a world where opposition to Trump comes from people who have functioning brain stems (&amp; a capacity to recognize &amp; oppose bullshit #RoyCohn lying) that's going to involve quite a lot of people.  Like most.
Anyway, long thread to say: I do not like these comments and it makes me defensive and angry. The God I serve is so seriously against invoking His name while oppressing people. If He wouldn't let Israel get away with it, why should we let Trump?
Second, read that last sentence. He is equating loss of (important) rights with a loss of God. Again, I must urge anyone reading (incl. Pres. Trump himself) to see the Bible - 2A Rights were not in the Bible, yet the church thrived. The Constitution is not equal with Scripture.
Trump says Biden wants to "Take away your guns, destroy your second amendment, no religion, no anything. Hurt the bible, hurt God. He's against God, he's against guns."   Here's why this is a massive theological problem:
I remember when Trump said this. He changed his tune real quick after the cameras were turned off.
‚Å¶ ‚Å¶ Shut down the power of the purse to this corrupt Trump administration!
The question is can we. With Barr, &amp; McConnell,  including several of trump minions, not to mention what they are doing that we are un aware of. I am an optimist yet I have doubt.
Gee, looks like a business opportunity, for some clever people.  That would rule out Donald Trump, of course.
Blame the victim ... pity he wasn't a Trump donor, or have a mansion, then you'd be on his side.
and yet people who despised W back then are wishing he could just have one more term in place of having Trump.. lol
Seriously though. Why do we need these debates? Typically it‚Äôs because we need to hear policy differences. But Trump has shown us his and they are self-serving, lawless and terrible for the country. Anything Biden does will be better.  I don‚Äôt need no stinking debates.
You're a Trump supporter therefore you make excuse after excuse for him. When he loses Nov. 3rd, maybe you can run his fan club.

Oh, Creationist Bob wants to play that deflection card.  Actually, I'll stipulate that Donald Trump isn't actually very bellicose, largely because he is a personal coward &amp; bully who can't even fire his appointees to their face.  But he is still the most ignorant to be POTUS.
Pitiful, you are just pitiful. So it's ok for tRump to sexually assault boys, girls and women because you have some sick conspiracy about what Clinton may have done? Sorry old man you need to raise your bar.

Your use of CAPS LOCK is VERY PRESIDENTIAL!  You'll have to work more on bad spelling, sudden rambling content shifts, &amp; include more petty name-calling to rise (or is it fall?) to the level of our Plague President, Donald Trump.
Not even the racy bits from the Song of Solomon?  Trump must certainly know all the "powerful" and "tremendous" Bible passages, right?  Ah, unless none of them actually talk about HIM, in which case his attention will wander off ...
The scary thing is this. In an alternative universe where Trump wasn't quite the asshole he is in this one, he could have listened to the experts, cared about the populace,  and instituted masks, social distancing etc. and he probably would have been ahead  and won reelection.
So trump was given a dementia test by a doctor, obviously there was a great concern about donnie's cognitive ability. Yo-semite or Thighland, where will dementia donnie try to hide from the law??? The tribe is going to prison.

I think when we hate each other it hurts God. I've seen NDE's where people pick up on the "other side" that when we hurt each other it hurts God. "He" doesn't want us to be this way, but to grow out of it, and love each other. In that sense, it's Trump &amp; Co. that's hurting God.

President Donald Trump and his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, are searching for places to impressively yet safely accept their parties‚Äô presidential nominations as the spread of the coronavirus adds fresh uncertainty to the campaign for the White House.

As usual, you are a liar.  I don't have any "prewritten Tweets".  I am a writer though, &amp; a coherent &amp; consistent one.  You may find it as hard to imagine others capable of quick responses as Donald Trump is trying to wrap his pea-brain around the legacy of John Lewis.
That's about as much as Don can muster.  He's a credulous Young Earth creationist who swallows all their stuff as credulously as he does the #RoyCohn lies of Donald Trump.  Don illustrates the #TortucanAlert mind in action, &amp; his bad methods cannot but lead to bad results.

Legal scholars dispute Trump‚Äôs claim to power ‚Äònobody thought the president had‚Äô after last ruling about DACA.
Trump is the worst kind of sinner because he cynically exploits religion to lure the gullible, not having a true religious thought himself. Whereas Biden is a true believer, but he doesn't force his beliefs on others.
Run, don't walk! If he loves Trump it is a guarantee that your moral compasses won't match. This will never work in the long term trust me. I had to walk away from a 30 year relationship for this very reason.

I would crawl through the hot desert sand, across burning coals and broken glass, with no food or water, to vote Trump out!
If the Republican Party wanted to be, you know... forthright about its intentions under the Trump regime, they need to replace the MAGA hat with one that more simply states its current belief system.  Less subterfuge, more honesty.
Oh cool. So Kanye is republican. So all you Rs who plan to vote for trump can vote for Kanye instead. Split the R vote and take way from Trump. Make it backfire like every other dirty trick trump tries to pull.

Trump is a grifter, a cheat, a #RoyCohn liar, who will attempt to destroy all who stand in the way of his money or his limitless needy ego.
Trump can't block people because he claimed his tweets are official statements. Twitter was not bound by this claim. There was no requirement for them to be forced to host his content. Even then, they only blocked his campaign's account, not his personal account.

When it all comes crashing down for Trump and the GOP, before the smoke clears people like this guy will be saying ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt fail because we were too conservative! We weren‚Äôt conservative enough! Trump was never one of us!‚Äù Conservatism cannot fail; it can only be failed.
Who do you trust to give you an honest evaluation on the #coronaviruspandemic , Dr. Fauci or Donald Trump? Silly question, right?

Aww, come on...that‚Äôs so unfair...Trump tells him what to say. No room for the radicalism of thinking and educating yourself. That isn‚Äôt allowed with the GOP. Tow the party line or be berated.
Same and to troll Trump.
By mail, while in my Pjs, the cat will probably walk all over the ballot and I will take a shot of tequila  after I vote for Biden. Then I will say fuck you Trump three  times.
In my area, we have a lot of Trump supporters. It IS a cult, and so discouraging.
If Clinton testified when he was President Trump can.
Lindsey Graham: If we nominate Trump, we will get destroyed.......and we will deserve it.
Donald Trump is deliberately trying to dismantle the US Postal service!  Why?  He doesn't want mail in ballots. He is also trying to ban TicTok.  Why?  They embarrassed him, because of the low turnout in Tulsa OK. He only cares about one thing, himself, not you, not our country!!
President Trump is flirting with signing executive orders to extend enhanced unemployment benefits and imposing a payroll tax holiday. Where are the constitutional conservatives who should be raging about Presidential overreach?
Your just making yourself a bigger joke buddy. Trump will EAT YOU UP on debate night and I will gladly watch it. For good measure I‚Äôll even watch on CNN
Anyone but Trump! I don‚Äôt care who vp is as long as we get rid of Trump!
You really should watch their ads without blinders on. They use trump's actual words often. Name examples of their lies, after you fact ‚úî them. Have you fact ‚úîed trump, ever?  Why do you want to live under a dictatorship? Losing all freedoms. That isn't my USA!
I read an article by Ryan Bort, in Rolling Stone, who suggests trump was "an abject moron who stumbled assbackward into the WhiteHouse."  Backassward, assbackward, (or mine) bassackward, pegs how an criminal narcissistic failure, a wannabe king, can become a GOP POTUS. #VoteBlue
Man are you mental. I know quite a few folks who voted Trump, and they all hate white supremacist. I argue against Trump, yet none of them demonstrate this garbage. Guilt by association claims will get Trump 4 more years. I think you're actually pro Trump. Interesting tactic.
Every Latino trump supporter
Good crud! And here I am defending Trump--didn't think it possible. Man, did someone plant a Democrat programmed nano-chip in your cerebral cortex?
The bounties "concern" started before Trump, in 2014.

Damn, what happened to those videos when Jesse Jackson praised Trump for helping Black communities. Trump also said that ‚Äúneo-Nazis and white supremacists ... should be condemned totally.‚Äù Alveda King: "Trump has done more for African Americans than Biden."
To Dinesh... so f**king what? Trump is still a moron. Quit rationalizing the irrational.

I didn't vote Trump, and won't this year, however, your partisan ignorance disqualifies you from undertaking any rational discussion. I criticize orange man a lot, but you're so ignorant of reality, that fools like you will cause millions to vote Trump.
Except for the girls and young ladies that Donald Trump trafficked and the girls and women slaves that worked in Ivanka's factories.
Politicians had zero role in my dislike for Trump. That particular sentiment was fixed decades before he started playing in the political realm. Being a terrible president flows logically from his being a terrible human.
I literally have to tell this to all trump supporters. They are the most gullible mindless sheep that go along with anything he says. Oh and then call you sheep for having common sense.
I want Harris, but if Biden chooses someone else, I will still support him. I can‚Äôt allow another 4 years of Trump because I know the horrible impact he‚Äôs had on the people I love &amp; care about in my community. I would not do that to them or to myself. It‚Äôs bigger than a VP pick.
He did say ‚ÄúIf you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black‚Äù. He was a sassy comment on a radio show and later apologized.
The DOJ must prosecute trump so that no person dares put our Democracy at risk again. He should go to prison and be stripped of all titles, compensation, and benefits that come with being  president.  He pledged allegiance to himself only. #survivingtrump #VoteBlue #VOTEBLUE
And you brought up ‚Äúpretending to care after 3.5 years of wrecking it‚Äù I brought up carbon emissions because you twats swear it‚Äôs the most dangerous thing to the planet. So trump put up lower numbers then Obama on the thing the left finds most dangerous
It‚Äôs not too complicated. It‚Äôs just you refuse to give in when the fact is simple that trump had lower numbers then Obama with less regulations ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
It did work. Trump=less emissions then obama with less regulations that hinder job growth and cheap electric
HAHAHA. Meanwhile- Brian Fallon, former Press Secretary for Hillary Clinton, Heads Facebook's "Fact Checking" Department. HE is the one to " blame". BTW- how do you know WHAT is a lie from Donald Trump when YOU say that "everything he says is a lie". Nice try.
OMG! üò≤ These Lefties trip me out. They act like Donald J. Trump is the worst thing since the bubonic plague. How about Herbert Hoover? He got us into a real ECONOMIC depression (and he was a businessman, too). Also, why don't we start talking about HOW Obama ran this country.
Great timing. This wont help Trump at all. Plus let‚Äôs be real, nothing is gonna happen.
Lies, lies and more lies. Trump always says the opposite of what is true!
Oh yeahüëçüèº Right on the Money (pun intended) President Trump was Killing them on their Economy ... it was looking like bad 10yrs. Ago!! We NEED Him 4more yrs! So We can bring back All our Pharmaceuticals!! New Boom Financially 4 Us.. the Virus ü¶† was No Accident! Look  Timing??!

Trump would not make it through a second term or go to prison because of his health .
Who cares‚Äîexcept, possibly, the CNN activists? I have yet to see one rational idea come from the Democratic Party. Biden is irrelevant. It‚Äôs the warped party backing him that will give Trump victory‚Äîand I won‚Äôt be even vote for Trump.
same as looking at carbon emissions. Obama‚Äôs last year 5170 Trump 2019 5130 (mill met tons). Seems close but if I factor in Trumps included slightly lower numbers without the regulations that hindered job growth and cheap electricity that Obama put in place it‚Äôs not close at all.
‚ÄúTrump should have forced us to lockdown earlier instead of letting the states control their own lockdowns!‚Äù Is the same person as  ‚ÄúTrump is a Dictator!‚Äù  Just admit your a hypocritical political hack and just hate trump it‚Äôs easier on everyone and your not fooling anyone.
Once the regulation is made and being met, that year will show you what that regulation accomplished, it doesn‚Äôt continue to drop after because YOU WERE MEETING THE REGULATION you don‚Äôt have anything causing it to drop more. So yes the fact that trump cleared the regulation
Lastly I could give a shit about the reduction. Trump put up lower numbers then Obama WITH LESS REGULATIONS. You seem to be under the impression that ‚Äúok put this regulation in place and then stuff will just continue to go down forever‚Äù that‚Äôs not how it works either
Proud Trump supporter in Washington state. Unfortunately those of us on the east side of the mountains are controlled by the libs in western Washington.
There is no pardon for Donald J. Trump in New York.
Trump has a plan, he will just let people die and do nothing.

Greed.  1. Solves hunger and many needs. More than enough to go around. 2. Ends the idiocy of the tRump crime syndicate.  3. Reduces the need for drugs and alcohol for self medicating.  4. Ends most wars and conflicts. 5. Probably finds cures for cancer and shit.
I hope it‚Äôs something in regards to the wiener laptop. But since this is NY and the people over there hate POTUS so much‚Ä¶ What if it‚Äôs an announcement of another fraudulent investigation into POTUS or the Trump organization?

Calling someone who has only been in government for 3 years and yet you defend politicians like Biden who have been in power for fifty years plus. And blaming trump for problems they couldn‚Äôt solve in that time. What a double standard.
Cleaning out the toadies Trump installed in key positions in our government, e.g., Justice, State, Defense, EPA, Treasury, DHS, etc., etc., and rolling back his policies and executive orders. Eight years worth of work!

Look at it this way. If China uses TikTok to influence the upcoming election, and Trump wins, they can blame him for not banning TikTok, and thus he helped China influence his reelection. The ACLU gave up on The Constitution a few decades ago, in favor of political partisanship.

Look you're exposed as a Democrat I don't care you can hate Trump till Hell Freezes Over, it won't change the fact the China gave the entire world this virus , just like the United States Other countries are having reoccurring problems with the virus.  you thanked China lately???
Trump supporters are, others I will say no, until they prove otherwise.
???? Ok, he is a bloviating idiot. How does  Trump manage to tie his shoes? God help us.
Ask yourself this: If Trump were a Russian asset, could have done any more to destroy America and her standing in the world than he's done in the last 3+ years?
Social media platforms are free to use, and their owners have every right to run them as they see fit. We also have the right to choose whether to use them. Trump has a history of verbally attacking and attempting to tear down anyone who challenges him.
I don't post a lot of politics, mainly because I try not to let political opinion become the foundation on which I build my life, but maaaan this guy! Trump is currently moving to shut Twitter down, because he was fact-checked.

Trump's presidency is as "Christian" as the faux Christian Dominionist Evangelical con. You know, the Falwell Xtians. Prolifers until the baby takes its 1st breath. Frozen in fear of all "others", LGBTQ &amp; non-white. Better hope the Pearly Gates are fake news.

God, I hope not. I'm hoping there's some leverage that'll turn things around. Today Trump said "no pre-existing conditions." Guarantee that he didn't wanna. They're losing. They know it. They'll start begging, I hope, and that includes saving the common folks (Lord willing).

Trump lied about it.
The Post Office is literally listed as an essential governmental service in the Constitution. Is Congress going to allow a single trump appointee to destroy a Constitutionally-mandated service essential to our functioning Democracy?
Even Tucker cut away from Trump's disastrous presser. Let that sink in. Tucker Cut Away From Trump's Presser.
He says he's not taking away cover for pre-existing conditions. As he's trying to pass legislation that will take that same cover away. Trump's left hand has no idea what his right hand is doing. Dementia is hereditary. Fred had it and Trump is definitely showing the signs
trump unveils new healthcare plan called O'Bama Care.

I would have thought China would prefer Trump, given the damage he is doing to the United States
trump will be the dogshit stuck to Republican shoes for a generation.
Both of them must be held financially liable for the damage their dereliction of duty caused! If necessary, take apart Trump and McConnell's businesses and seize any money in tax havens.
I just assumed Trump equated himself with God and was referring to his divine self.
No, and it is due to Trump and his people.

So setting a building with people in it on fire and possibly burning them to death is not necessarily bad per se, but it's possible that this action will help Trump's re-election campaign and THAT'S what is unacceptable.
Be sure to copy this tweet to Trump üëç!!!
I'm pretty sure most of the world views trump, his apologists, and his enablers with hostile incomprehension.
Trump is a #FakeChristian .
I thought QAnon was about how JFK Jr faked his own death to avenge the DeepStaters who killed his Dad, so trump could one day be recruited for POTUS to root out and destroy a 6,000 y.o. Moloch-worshipping, child sex trafficking, blood drinking cult? Totally reasonable stuff.
So Kanye is bipolar and Trump has an undiagnosed learning disability. They are horrible human beings. I'm so tired of empathy being focused solely on the problems of the super rich. I don't want to feel sorry for these horrible human beings.
That's where you're wrong. It's all the same shitshow. Biden spent forty years creating it. Trump has spent the last three years making it worse.
Trump is a #FakeChristian.

We are fortunate that as long as Biden pulls ahead in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania it is impossible for Trump to win the 270 votes which are necessary to win reelection.
Trump has so many executive orders. Like I've never seen a president do so many in his first or second term combined... at least not in recent years
Not every U.S. citizen thinks that their country or  leader is great many think that the current state of this country is really bad but just aren't as loud as the people who celebrate trump
Did‚Äôt I read some where that some of the trump kids voted in two different states?  Is that what you mean by voting more than once?
You sound like another trump voter.  Vote in person and the die of Covid-19 soon after.  Trump does not care about you, he has no heart.  Read Mary Trump‚Äôs book!
Sounds like you are referring to a quote from trump here.
You really have to ask that question?  After all the lies trump says every time he opens his mouth?
I think you are mixed-up.  It is trump who wants you to stand in line to vote for him, and then shortly after die of Covid-19.

They didn't check whether gassing pregnant women would be detrimental to their fetuses. How hypocritical. Trumps thugs essentially gassed fetuses. Fun Fact: Using tear gas is against rules of combat according to the Geneva Convention. Trump used it on pregnant American women.

I‚Äôll bet your worried. Worried that for the next four and a half years President Donald Trump will stay in that roll. And that he will be voted in my the majority of the voters. Not because he‚Äôs this great president. But because there‚Äôs no one winnable running.

Trump threatens executive actions as coronavirus relief deal remains elusive on Capitol Hill. Suspend payroll tax, extend eviction moratoriums,  extend unemployment payments.
I disagree with Biden that prosecuting Trump would be bad for democracy, in fact quite the opposite. We have sent the message that if you are in government you will be immune from the law. This is a very dangerous precedent we have and it needs to be reversed.
Biden didn't compromise this absolutely vital piece of rule of law.

#ImmigrationNation is tough to watch.  It should be.  There must be absolutely no question in anyone's mind, nor in history, that what the Trump administration did to families was immoral, cruel, and unusual punishment.  This is not what government is here to do.

I know it's impossible to reason and understand what Trump tries to say, but truly, as I re-read, what he said makes absolutely no sense.  It's like he tried to remember the main talking points his aides gave him and ended up with, "religion, pro-life, guns".

We will be drawing the Swamp in November...bush bye Trump!
This joke is so stupid but remember so is Trump‚Äôs BASE and they will not get the funny side of the tweet.They are all so confused now that they believe anything that looks like praise for Trump.
Because trump I‚Äôd dirty a lier a con and sooo corrupt
Dump trump make America America again dump trump
Trump‚Äôs Bank Was Subpoenaed by N.Y. Prosecutors in Criminal Inquiry
Voted effectively by mail in Washington AND received my fishing license from the Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife by mail no less! tRump encourages Florida to v-by-mail -SWING STATE- but threatens to sue Nevada for voting by mail. Smells like rotting corruption on a hot August day.
As a Leftist if you want to win the campaign Trump should focus on depressing Bernie supporters to vote Green and attack Biden on his warhawking and trying to cut social security
It‚Äôs unfortunate &amp; shameful &amp; corrupt that the GOP would use a man, Kanye West, who severely suffers mental illness &amp; bipolar disorder to rig the voting to favor tRump. They‚Äôre using Kanye, a very troubled individual for political gain knowing full well he has zero chance to win.
Seems like weird choices. Does this mean Trump will replace Pence with Cohen, Manafort, Papadopoulus, Pinedo, Van der Zwaan, Stone, Gates or Flynn?
Interesting the power Trump has over so many self proclaimed strong people, especially those enjoying their millionaire lifestyle and celebrity status . . .
Trump, the Great Russian Liar...
Does that mean Melania Trump get the check?
They want to blame Trump for everything. With only 4 years Trump in the house and democRats with the Hitler‚Äôs ideology they been executing for 40 years!
Donald Trump has no sources in the real world. Donald Trump lives in a fantasy land where he thinks he's a success. Donald Trump is a FAKE president.
you're not wrong but you know those clips were them talking about Biden right? the daily show edited them together with footage of Trump being a moron
Don't Trade with Trump - Sign the petition!   via
Part of quote"We can't do it without the cops" This arsehole needs done  for Federal crimes. So the problems he and coumo caused, they now ask the man they vilify then they will take credit. So lose 22000jobs to get their votes blame P TRUMP. He is evil üòà
The combo of Trump lowering corporate federal tax brackets and allowing more corporate profits to be taken under "security costs," which is how Bezos and others skirt around taking more taxable salary or stock. Tighten up those two things and that'd fix what you're talking about.
Really interesting election results last night in WA. Rs getting stronger in small coastal former timber industry counties; Trump country. But continuing to lose ground in urban Puget Sound.
I left out a lot of things, Twitter's character limit is only 280. Cruel, spiteful, small, scared, narcissistic, petty, spoiled, dishonest. I mean really, pick any negative adjective you want and it probably applies to Trump.
Americans would do better to stop electing them.    And I don't mean Trump, I mean the lefty lunatics who are State Governors, Mayors, etc.
Is that like trump rectum uvlight with bleach flush
"Oh no! But.. but.. but now how am I supposed to display my moral superiority now that black people like Trump and support the police?!"  -Signed, the white wokes
Sooo funny seeing all these lefty numbskulls lose their mind over this since they've been told over and over by the media how Trump is racist and theyve been suckered into that group think. They're beside themselves &amp; reading their flabbergasted comments is warming my soul! üòÇ

You can buy this poster at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, and you can draw a straight line from literally every item on it to the Trump Administration.
Do not retreat! Dont give up ground! Organize your community's constitutional citizen militias! 50, a week ago, now 75 counties are now organized! Trump has a plan. He's drawn China, corrupted Dems and the Jews, and Catholics that are in the evil Dem party, into boxed in canyons!
Natalia, dearest lady. We all know President Trump doesn't use proper grammar. You look a little bit silly bringing up grammar. Just saying. Rest your thread is really good. Follow me back.
In my mind  is more than a gay republican.  He is a true patriot who, through his words AND actions have proven to be a man of the American Patriot.  I love President Trump, but I think Mr. Grenell exemplifies American Patriotism.
In August 2016, a poll had Hiliary ahead of Trump by 8 points. Blue voters MUST stay diligent and committed!!!
Just one of a MULTITUDE of Trump glorious failures...
Well, some people want to DO something and actually change the things wrong with this country while other people think just getting Trump out will make things ‚Äúnormal‚Äù again so they can go back to brunch and consumerism.
Now do Trump...
Exact same thing.  I waited in line behind a Trump supporter for 3 hours and am not doing that again.  Drop off box is walking distance at a public library.  Not one Republican marked for the first time ever
When the reporter points out that the numbers don‚Äôt compare to the rest of the world and Trump responded with ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt do that, you have to go by the United States‚Äù  That right there is the problem, even our leaders aren‚Äôt looking at how the rest of the word handled COVID-19.
That is a joke, right? 50 Million people are currently out of work! How is that 4%? Why didn‚Äôt you care about adding to the National debt when you bought in to trump‚Äôs tax reduction scheme? #Hypocrisy
Another lie from BLOTUS. #25AmmendmentNowPresident Trump claims he has the right to issue an executive order on mail-in voting
This isn't the ONLY reason but it is a valid reason for why some so fastidiously follow Trump.
Mr. Trump has done everything for Americans period.
That was intentional by Jared and Miller. Trump is too stupid to understand how anything is going to affect anything.
Yeah, dogs don‚Äôt typically warm up to psychopaths. It‚Äôs why trump doesn‚Äôt have one.
Trump be like...
Cory u won trump rectum uvlight with bleach flush use regular ok

I really dont like trump
Trump is the only one "complaining" about it even though he uses it himself!!    Our troops use it, our college students use it, elderly use it!!!  It's been around forever!!  Amazing no complaints of fraud until a master of fraud comes into the WH
"...unqualified folks surrounding Trump..." We Americans just call them Congress.
Agreed. Too much crap has occurred with many departments in this country. It‚Äôs hard for a citizen to give police the benefit of the doubt nowadays. Good cops take the brunt of a f*ck up that occurred on the other side of the country. Part of the job tho...
All of them ! Even trump I believe is in on some of this shit. This shit goes DEEP.
Trump Says Coronavirus Is 'Receding' Even As Cases And Deaths Rise    What is Wrong with this guy..  the most incompetent clown wonders why folks don't like him
Only the cop who ran the tag could tell you why. It may be exactly what you suggest. You‚Äôll have to ask him/her.
Hey! No you don't. I'm on the west coast. Besides all the Dem leaders should be in prison before then! That is why we had to get all that Antifa and BLM crap out of the way. Avoid a huge uprising when mass arrests are made. See Trump has a really well thought out plan.
The true Republicans are voting for Biden since Trump destroyed what their party stood forüòè
Donald Trump is to sue Nevada because they have sent out postal ballots for the presidential elections. He claims it‚Äôs open to gross fraud! Is this common knowledge about postal ballots worldwide? I wish someone had warned us in 2014
Man... in one day I learned  would vote for Trump and  and the  had Jr on ... ugh. Rough day for podcast I like.
I think Trump might have lost a lot of votes because of his handling of this pandemic. Not just black.
Yeah... what‚Äôs low key is a lot of black dems agree when it comes to Trump... not the Republican Party necessarily... just good ole Trump bear.
That didn‚Äôt bother black people. Most black democrats low key think if you vote for Trump you ain‚Äôt really black anyway lol. Not right mind you... just how it is today.
Pretty funny that all these Christian cult Trump supporters have basically fucking deified Donald Trump and QAnon. Bro. Ex Christian here. Go dust off and read your fucking bible.  Exodus 20:02 &amp; Deuteronomy 5:6 Exodus 32  Oh wait. That‚Äôs the ‚ÄúOld Testament‚Äù, never mind
Exactly, I watch for the latest Trump gaffe.
You didn't know the liberals thinks he has powers and that trump is responsible for everything.
That guy would blame trump for everything in life.
Waaaaaaaaa, now you sound like trump. Quit whining a face reality, you can get 75% of what you want or zero. Your choice.
Seems this comment need an anecdote. The complaint is Trump is losing popularity. All the while Democrats are hiding a candidate who is mentally slipping. Reminder in the U.S. people elect Presidents not Vice Presidents. Be careful what you wish for.
This is the best piece I've read in some time about how we got here.  I Hope This Is Not Another Lie About the Republican Party.
Donald Trump King of Fake News and enemy of the People!
Yeah, but that doesn‚Äôt stop the hole from getting deeper. The only thing worse than not being able to pay one month‚Äôs rent, is not being able to pay six! But Trump can no more work against capitalism than a fish can work against the tide.
I hope you like what your country looks like after another 4 years of trump if you don‚Äôt vote for Biden. Don‚Äôt cut off our noses to spite your face. I wanted Bernie or Liz too, but I‚Äôm a grown up and I will vote accordingly.
Been saying that since the day trump was elected.
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised, but part of me didn‚Äôt want to believe that votes were changed. I assumed that a lot of people saw ‚Äúthe way the wind was blowing‚Äù after Obama put his thumb on the scale. They waited in line because they think voting against Trump is all they need to do.
A Case for the American People: The US v. Trump
Trump admitted, out loud, that if we all voted by mail, Republicans would never win again. He went back later to say it‚Äôs because Dems would cheat, but what he really meant was Republicans couldn‚Äôt cheat.
I‚Äôm 65 years old now and I have experienced some great, good and average United State‚Äôs presidents. But I have NEVER been ‚Äúconcerned‚Äù about the future of my country. Trump has changed ALL of that for me. I am GREATLY concerned about what can happen between Nov 2020 and Jan 2021.
Greg take trump rectum uvlight with bleach flush ICU 2 weeks
Maybe, but look at all the personal and professional things Trump did prior to being elected. Now we're trying to apply the same scandal logic to Biden? Just don't think it'll matter. People were tired of old guard corruption in Hillary, so she lost. Now we're tired of Trump.More Criminal Acts by tRump. #PutinsPuppet
No matter what!...don‚Äôt get him the ‚Äúdonald trump cut‚Äù!!!
Trump is pushing it but I will not bend lol
OMG. So easy and I want my money.  Donald Trump is the traitor in the White House and his comrades Lindsey and al the GOP who spent 4th of July in Russia getting their orders
White‚Äôs for life? White bread and Mayo movement  Trust fund tots Heaven is for white‚Äôs only ball Trump‚Äôs trash bash
Tell your liberal blowhard do-nothing friends to get out of the way. You play by the rules or you don't play at all. We are done doing it your way. This is Trump's game now. His administration, not yours. Not Pelosi's. Get used to it. Resign. Now.
IDK I keep trump to here Soviet artillery pounding Berlin. Bunker time.
üö®üö® HUGE NEWS üö®üö®  Donald tRump admits he is trying to look like an Oompa Loompa.  MAJOR!
Trump didn't do anything, he said word salad. And then also, um...Obamacare.
What we're seeing is you stooges putting on a show so trump can use an EO to look like a hero. If it was just an extension being argued about, it wouldn't be an issue. It's all the extra greedy bullshit that your side added that's the problem.
Trump and banksy got trade Mark's for body bags and caskets from china.
‚ÄúThe Supreme Court gave the president of the United States powers that nobody thought the president had,‚Äù Trump told Fox News interviewer Chris Wallace on July 19.‚Äù
Ludicrously offensive. This mindset GOT us, Trump, as POTUS. Conservatives = snowflakes. They just lost access to using that word.
This is what Trump is going after - no other President would do what he is doing to big P - going to get uglier
Pelosi is going to get Trump re-elected
Can Trump do UI by executive order?
Trump deserves no thanks. He has embezzled almost $150 million from taxpayers spending it in his businesses. He hires inept people like his daughter and son-in-law. Then there is Trump hiring  Louis DeJoy as Postmaster General who is to blame for delays in mail delivery.
China really wanted Trump
Do people need to get knocked by a 2x4 to understand.....don t tRump is a F...ing #RusdianAsset?
What song would you put in your phone as the ringtone for Donald Trump?
At first to convince people to Quit Eating Animals &amp; #GoVegan Then I in 2015 I started warning about tRump being a #ChildRapist
Democrats aren't any better than Trump.
SELFISH tRump SUPPORTERS......ARE KILLING üá∫üá∏
Trump supporters wake up. He‚Äôs going to ruin us even more than he already has . He only cares about how much money he can steal from taxpayers.
Donald Trump‚Äôs corruption is showing again. While other states will have to pay 25% of the cost of National Guard deployments helping them with coronavirus response, Trump made a special exception for just two states: Florida and Texas.
Joe Biden as well as Donald Trump are BOTH both not mental fit or stable to run the United States. We are fucked either way.
The moron doesn't get it that it's not just going to be Trump not watching it's going to be all his supporters not watching also.
He's trying to save this country and people are so blinded by hatred they can't see it.  Or they are haters and would rather see America sold to the devil and are fighting Trump tooth and nail.  If this country goes down there's going to be a lot of suffering.
For the last 46 years, Reagan is the only Republican with good jobs numbers.  And as the graph title state Trump is by far the worst.  No both sides here. Democrats are WAY better on the economy. Not even close. #FactsMatter #Biden2020
I do. Because my parents are small business owners in Texas struggling like hell. I'm watching him piddle this pandemic away while they struggle to stay afloat. Unfortunately they're in camp Trump too so it feels like a losing battle but I'm gonna keep fighting for them
You mean like oranges, thighland, Yo semites- just one day for Trump
But  unzipped pants with young woman is perfectly okay with God and Trump?
He says this‚ÄùI don't take responsibility at all': Trump deflects blame for coronavirus testing fumble‚Äù
This sincere tweet tweeted to show his humility &amp; willingness to #BeBetter Is a great place to üö´ a lot of bots, tRump cultists and closet racists.
Well I'm excited for you to see justice....tRump is a filthy jerk.
There will be singing üé∂ &amp; üíÉ ing in the streets. The tRump CRIME Family is going to go DOWN. I can feel it coming.
They are just not scary dogs. You can‚Äôt make them scary. That‚Äôs the problem Trump has wirh Biden
Just niw I saw a huge red truck with an American flag, a tRump flag, and a confederate flag. 2  out of three are losers, evil, disgusting. I was so angry I literally  saw red.  WHAT is wrong with these people!!
Which is why we should never turn our backs on them. Keep saying ‚Äúgood doggie‚Äù until you can find a big enough stick.  Not trusting the Never Trump folks past Nov. 3.
Trump promises executive action for eviction moratorium 'very soon' | Fox Business
This helps Trump so much and is so profoundly stupid. I know they are criminals, when has that ever mattered?
God and Trump don't mix. Fact is, Trump acts like he's AntiChrist. So take his statement with a mix of disbelief and incredulous, stir well and add Lysol.
Yeah, might as well keep trump. Looking bad both ways.
I hope they get Kanye on the ballot. The few votes he gets will come from trump not Biden! The Democrats are smart enough to understand that he is mentally ill...like trump!
Except trump‚Äôs administration has no idea where their families are so the kids sit in there month after month, even though a judge has ordered them to be let out!
Twitter temporarily restricted Trump campaign's ability to tweet over false Covid-19 claims - CNN
If I can't have both I'd rather see the NRA disappear than Trump. 'Course, I'd rather have both.
Not surprising since trump has been campaigning since 2016!
It's TRUE if trump is thier false GOD.
Not for nothing but the ore Covid post Trump economy also sucked for most people
If he was innocent why not give a DNA sample? Why, because he‚Äôs guilty. Anyone else would have to give DNA. When he‚Äôs kicked out of office he will have to give DNA.
This unforgivable gamble has led to tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths, particularly in states that Trump's sinking re-election campaign desperately needs to win, like Florida and Arizona.
Unfortunately this is Trump's re-election path: Stubborn people getting pissed at their democrat governors because of sports
This man is a national hero. Shame on Trump supporters.
It isn't just Trump not watching! Look at  and  ratings, they're in the weeds.   Why?    'Cuz they suck at being Americans, not because Orange Man Bad.
If I was Biden, I'd refuse to debate at all unless tRump releases his taxes. But that's me.üôÑ
It's called Democratic Socialism, and it's about to improve the quality of all our lives.  Trump can't stop it, Biden can't stop it and YOU certainly can't stop it.
Under tRump....A disgrace.
I think Trump might have been visiting one of his many rooms full of BIBLES, reading about Hittites, Jebites etc., just before the ‚ÄòYOSEMMITES‚Äô thing. #PutThatInYourPipe
Both candidates arguably have the signs of old age present. Trump is not smart though so Biden has him there.
Lol why we mad at trump THIS time..damn shame
Bishop, I cannot apologize for all white people but I can say I am ashamed of the white people that support Trump, especially those that call themselves Christian. There is nothing Christian in supporting Trump. Trump is the opposite of Christ.
I am not one of those 50% and I didn‚Äôt vote for him in 2016. As a Christian we aren‚Äôt supposed to hate anyone but lord help me I hate Trump! I disliked him before he ran for office but flat out hate him now!
...They are the SAME DAMN THING!! But Trump's answer the other day when asked why okay in FL, because the last 2 Governors are Republicans!! WTF?? This will not hold water with the Supreme Court if it comes to that.
The people who support trump fall into 2 camps. 1: the dirty investor. 2: the small people who only care that he hurts the people they hate. That's it.
You are a complete waste of space. Idiot Trump supporter.
All Trump needs to do is change the date and sign
I am a #Christian but that doesn‚Äôt mean I put up with any bull. I love to defend those that cannot defend themselves. I point out unfairness and fight against it. I don‚Äôt put up with racism or any bigotry. I love my neighbor. And I have always despised Trump. #VoteBiden2020
I can never understand why people do meth. How can they put all that crap in their body? Maybe that‚Äôs where Trump got the inject disinfectant idea. Plus who would want to by hyped up and jittery all the time? I can‚Äôt even take Sudafed because it makes me cry.
Lawmakers briefed today on how much Russia is doing to interfere in election were horrified on the over classification of evidence. They say public needs to know. Trump says no.
Stevens: "For myself, Judy, I'm going to work with Democrats. I think that the future of America, the policy is going to be decided by decisions inside the Democratic Party."
Stevens: "You know, I think those of us who are working in these various projects to defeat Trump who are Republicans, I think each of us is going to have to come to grips with that and see what the world looks like on November 4." /3
Judy Woodruff: "And so what happens now? You and other Republicans who are dedicated to making sure Donald Trump is not reelected, you don't have a home in the party anymore. Where do you go?"  /2
Stuart Stevens is on PBS News Hour saying that Republicans aren't likely to accept anti-Trump folks like him back into the party after the election. Moving forward, policy decisions for America are going to be made within the Democratic Party.  He plans to work with Democrats. /1

Author Isabel Wilkerson lit my light bulb why most white people support  criminal Trump --- he defends their white privilege. Their number 1 priority is to hold their superiority over blacks, browns and other non-whites.

‚Å¶ you are the swamp!  Trump‚Äôs Bank Was Subpoenaed by N.Y. Prosecutors in Criminal Inquiry - The New York Times
I can‚Äôt believe someone would say that.  Trump had nothing to do with it I‚Äôm almost certain of that.  I‚Äôd say their shitty government is part to blame though for leaving that there since like 2013
Calling it now, it‚Äôs going to be Trump who refuses to debate. He will say the moderator is biased.
‚ÄúFrom a national security perspective, however, President Obama said he wants to be sure that, as we engage with the incoming [Trump] team, we are mindful to ascertain if there is any reason that we cannot share information fully as it relates to Russia."
Trump hates America.
Let‚Äôs not forget about the $1.7 billion provision tRump &amp; GOP added for a new FBI building in this Stimulas AND  the $8 BILLION FOR Military weaponry the Republicans tucked in the COVID-19 RELIEF BILL !! This does not put food on our tables!
The good news is Americans value their country and democracy more than Trump does. Americans will do what it takes to defeat Trump, even stand in the rain for hours to vote him OUT....To Make America Great Again...We‚Äôre strong! Trump underestimates us! üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏

AXIOS on HBO: President Trump Exclusive Interview (Full Episode) | HBO  via
Republican Trump acolyte Sen. Kennedy just humiliated the entire US Congress and all of America in his interrogatory of Sally Yates.  This is not the kind of Senator or citizen, that we need in America.
Sen. Kennedy today in the Sally Yates, Russia hearing, dwelling on how she, in his being obnoxious, and how people despise Donald #Trump.
That leaves Trump out...
Yeah totally. I like left-wing candidates who stand up to corporate interests in healthcare, the military and finance but I also like...Donald Trump
When Trump, the AltRight and the Republican Party get done screwing America it is going to take several decades to restore America to anywhere close to what it was... #TheRedTeamMurderofAmerica
I agree #VOTE! Voting in person has always been stupid. Mail-in is more secure. Voting machines have massive issues.  Greater voter suppression in-person. &amp; PANDEMIC? Trump's lying, yet again.
Such a Tragedy!!  I don't see trump helping Lebanon.

Trump supports his sons killing animals for fun.
Fascism raises its ugly Trump.head
So all lives matter ,  Republicans Democrats,race, sexual orientation, religion, or IQ. I break for squirrels,dogs, cats, and stupid ass people who decide to just walk out in front of my car without masks. Who do Trump supporters break for? No one.
She ran as pro Trump.
A pandemic is NOT an "it is what it is" moment. It's a stand up &amp; lead moment to maximize  safety of Americans &amp; consequently helps the rest of the world. tRump has zero empathy &amp; this statement highlights his indifference to American lives #TrumpMeltdown  #TrumpThreatensAmerica
Literally the loudest whiners are Trump supporters. Trump and his base are not a majority, and never have been
Ever notice how the environment got a lot worse in the last 4 years?  Well it looks intentionally modified.  If you'd paid attention you'd realize there's more to this than meets the eye and has nothing to do with trump.
Trump is in no condition to debate.
Is it the number if days before trump, God forbid, is out?!
I can't give Trump too much grief about Yosemite. Back when I was first learning to read I said "Hermy-own" for Hermione and "Peen-uh-lope" for Penelope. English is tricky. Stick with it, Don. It gets easier the more you practice. #YoSemites
They say kids who don‚Äôt drink water or say they don‚Äôt like it, is because their parents are doing the same.   Well trump supports don‚Äôt wear masks because trump doesn‚Äôt.
This is so Trump: John Lewis Didn't attend his inauguration so he didn't attend any service honoring Lewis. Trump's hatred and quid pro quos run deep.
We are being ruled by a madman. The evidence, is clear, right there before us. And yet, no one, does a thing about it? Madness. It is we, who are mad.  #trump #vote
For sure! And the way Trump, Mitch McConnell and the sorry Republican Senate is sitting on their asses avoiding passing another Stimulas, thousand of Americans will be evicted and homeless with no home AND no cable. üò§
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs done nothing to stand up to this president even as Trump goes about undermining our national security and intelligence agencies.
‚ÄúThe history books aren‚Äôt going to look kindly on Leader McConnell during the Trump administration,‚Äù said Jim Manley, a Democratic strategist and aide to former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid.
The story will be that one man, Mitch McConnell, knew better than anyone how to use those around him for his personal gain. He‚Äôs used Trump, members of his party in the Senate and the people of Kentucky, as little more than the conduit to his personal and financial enrichment.
Today, the majority of the U.S. Senate finds itself stuck between McConnell‚Äôs mercurial demands and the declining prospects of President Donald Trump.
Trump doesn‚Äôt want to give schools the money to reopen as per CDC guidelines so he talks to them and suddenly the CDC says all schools must open.
Trump criticized the CDC‚Äôs guidelines as ‚Äúvery tough and expensive‚Äù and said the agency was ‚Äúasking schools to do very impractical things.‚Äù Speaking of CDC officials, he tweeted, ‚ÄúI will be meeting with them!!!‚Äù And Vice Presidentsaid revised guidelines would be issued next week.
I've always called him tRump. üòÇ And not ONCE President....only president*
Tell me Scarf woman isn't part of the tRump DISINFORMATION Team.
Every time I watch a  video, the next autoplay is that guy who does funny interviews with dumb people at a Trump rally or another attempt at lib comedy. Never another SecularTalk or indy media video.
Swan: 1000 Americans are dying a day  Trump: yo! Semite!
Maybe if y'all worked as a team instead of being political this would be over with. You have made many remarks about Trump (I despise) but he's doing it to all Dem govs. Grow up and we will have help.
That is entirely possible. But what is anyone‚Äôs possible motivation in voting for a pro Trump democrat?
It‚Äôs all about Trump . Poor Trump John Lewis didn‚Äôt come to his inauguration. So is that why Trump didn‚Äôt pay his respects?
So his comment about page in blankets has nothing to do with protests now but in 2015. Fake news from Trump.
He blames everything on Antifa. He watches fake news NBC fake news. I thought FOX  and CNN were Trumps fake news choices. Guess everything he doesn‚Äôt like is fake news. So every news outlet that reports unfavorable news for Trump is suddenly fake news.
Trump was asked behind the scenes on  "How do you like your eggs Mr. President?" His Response   #AxiosOnHBO #Axios #Trump #itiswhatitis #HealthCareOfficers
Love how he saying he has less troops in Afghanistan than Obama. Reporter said there were 8,800 when you took office then you sent more to increase of 14,000 then you reduced back to 8,500. Trump is saying it will be down to 4,000 soon but wouldn‚Äôt say when.
Trump keeps lying about Russian bounties and that he was never advised. That he reads so much and everyone says he can‚Äôt. He‚Äôs saying the brief about Russia never reached his desk.
Love how Trump lies again. The reporter says the uptake in cases in Tulsa after his June rally. Trump says it was over two months after the rally. It was just over 2 weeks.
I hope you lose. You used to be level headed, but sold out to the Trump team.
The entire interview with Trump.
I cant believe that Trump supporters believe that Ghislaine Maxwell said that he didn‚Äôt have sex with anyone while at Epstein‚Äòs house Especially after saying cancel everybody that has a relationship with Epstein because they‚Äôre all a bunch of pedophiles but you know except Trump.
Still triggered by Obama when the top things that should be on your mind is the pandemic and Russian bounties on our military. Hillary was right. Mashed potato head Trump.

Trump: No one has done more for population control than I have!
I guess mom‚Äôs basement is pretty lonely their Trump Troll.
How is it Donald Trump‚Äôs fault. They have extended by 5and half months. There have been a lot of opportunities to get your information in. It‚Äôs just like taxes, it‚Äôs not the governments fault if you can‚Äôt file a form. It happens every 10 years. Not that hard. Mine was like 5 ?‚Äôs
It‚Äôs not all on Trump. He gave the governors the chance to make a stand, and they ALL punted. What is happening is a failure on every level, from President, all the way down to each individual citizen ( and every politician on the way down)
Biden has cognitive decline of some sort.  Why are people trying to pretend he doesn't and comparing it to ridiculous things?  The dems want the status quo.  Any warm body will do.  That's why they despise trump because he was hoping to affect change.
Trump said isn't there anything you can drink to disinfect you on the inside. Which I took to mean, too bad there's not something like that.  Akin to vitamin C. He never even came close to making me think he meant we should drink bleach.  Because that's not what he was implying
Tell trump: No pardon for you!
I honestly don‚Äôt see anything wrong with this. Especially when the same people bitching about this laugh at images of Donald Trump being beheaded. Stfu and sit down. Fuck all y‚Äôall.
I suppose we‚Äôre looking for a more sophisticated answer than TRUMP?
The only person that heard the message was Trump himself.
Neither have I had a drunken orgy on a yacht and I am a Christian. I guess I am missing a few chapters from my Bible, either that or Trump Christians have their own version with ‚ÄúThou shalt have a drunken orgy on thy yacht paid for by tithes from the church.‚Äù
Trump would rather see everyone die then go to prison.
It‚Äôs not a zero sum game. Trump being bad doesn‚Äôt make Pelosi good.
Ahh. I first thought of little 12/13 year old Maria that tRump raped. SHE disappeared and was most likely murdered. Maria Butina, I'd bet fell out of a window.
That‚Äôs Trump spin. In some places, u have 2 prove that u are unable to vote in ur residency in order 2 receive an absentee ballot to ‚Äúmail in.‚Äù Many places no longer require that &amp; will issue you a mail ballot to upon request. Some states use all mail voting. It‚Äôs all the same.
Ok #Evangelicals #Christian followers of #Trump. #Christ #Jesus is the #Word the ultimate authority, correct? So when Christ say that the father of lies is Satan and liars are Satan‚Äôs children why do you support  a proven habitual liar? Is Satan your father?
The guy calls himself KGB agent Joe and he‚Äôs lecturing a Navy SEAL about loyalty? That rich. Trump supporters are so unpatriotic and dumb.
A debate isn't just for Trump and Biden.  It's for us, too.  We deserve to ask both these pricks pointed questions.   Iron out the fundamental differences in policy/governance.   It would be unprecedented to back out entirely.
One is periodically reminded that Trump won largely because Clinton was just a stunningly awful candidate
Not vote for donald trump.
Yep! The  camp is scared witless of poor old Joe getting on a debate stage with Donald Trump!
He really hates this as it reminds him of one of his most humiliating childhood memories per Mary Trump's book.
Shock collars are cruel ( for dogs, not for Trump and his sycophants)Trump and his "It is what it is" about American covid deaths is a heinous example of a low life person. Not a human being with feelings and empathy.  It's pronounced Tai-land...  It is what it is.... Fool lol üòÇ
I proudly voted for Clinton twice and I finally watched John Lewis‚Äôs service, and I can't stomach his being there. Trump and Bill should be in jail for their time with Epstein.
I also think a lot of Republicans didn't vote at all in 2016 because they didn't know the real Trump.
I guess this is called playing to your base who live in the a trump vacuum and don‚Äôt realize that this a HOAX!
Biden should pick Trump as his running mate, then tell Trump he has to step down because he can't run for VP while also being President. 50% chance Trump falls for it.
The fact that he did not bother to show up at a brilliant courageous Mans funeral,show us all we really need to know.john.Lewis was not a fan of Trump, Trump ,was out for revenge ,but for a  brilliant Man ,a real president would have been there no matter what ,to pay his respect
He's one of Trump's good people
#SettleForBiden...let‚Äôs face it, we hoped for #BernieSanders and his honest background, but we must go with the MOST progressive candidate. Right now it‚Äôs Biden, but if Trump happens to make student loans 0% interest...well, we‚Äôll see.
depressed,worried ,scared sick of Trump ,other then that,Great  How was your vacation ?  Mine was to the grocery store today I found myself saying to all ,what a pretty mask,wow you made your mask  I'm an empath.  ,So I had to make people proud of the fact that they wear one  .
Did I ever mention the president in this tweet? I‚Äôm not insinuating Trump has any fault here. The problem was caused by both sides and by different policy moves.
I don‚Äôt like Trump either, but can we please stop propping up ‚ÄúCommentary‚Äù and ‚ÄúOpinion‚Äù as News?.?! Your job should be to report and interview people. Your bought off views are why people have no faith in politicians or media.
Thanks Obama!  Trump and the GOP failed to destroy all of his achievements so now they're trying to take credit for one of them.  They blame him for all of their failures but it's still not enough!  Now watch this video and laugh at their stupidity.
High ho ,the gangs all here !!! Commandant Heir Trump's***** good people****
Even this morons wife ,Kim Kardashian,said that Kanye is mentally Disturbed. sadly,Trump is throwing money at him,and using him  to cause Biden to lose votes ..someone in this family needs to step in and get  him some much needed help,and stop him from making him a bigger fool
But that would mean that Trump couldn‚Äôt run his businesses. Or have a place to hide when shit is hitting the fan.
Don't let this keep happening because of the Commandant ,heir Trump. We have already had one Holocaust.never again?!? Is again Don't vote for this ignorant, ignoramus.please  Vote for Biden ,he loves America,has empathy.and will make this country great ,once again
That‚Äôs because he inherited it from Obama. Trump doesn‚Äôt know what the hell he‚Äôs doing, he had nothing to do with it. You need to retire or resign your hands are dirty.
Yeah, we call this the affordable care act. What's crazy is that repubs, despite the fact that this was passed by both houses, signed by the president and sorted out by the supreme court, is that they still want to repeal it. But Trump just unilaterally declares it? No problem.
There is no way Biden can get away without debating Trump!  I see what is going on because I have clarity and truth within me.  Thank you Tucker... Thank you for reporting the Truth with sardonic wit sprinkled in!
Classic Trump !
Trump called Paradise, CA "Pleasure" repeatedly.  GTFOH
I'm not like anyone At least that's what it seems like and what the media wants people to think for some reason I'm not stupid enough to go back to the blank label leaving the mainstream media just because Trump purposely calls it fake news to try and get people to believe it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Freaking Russia? I think multiple instances of the mainstream media meddling &amp; putting someone's name above someone else who has more points definitely trump's a couple of pages from a coloring book &amp; the words "sources say" Not to mention the Zionists OUT MEDDLING the mediaüòíü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I thought the Nixon years were pretty dark.  But that‚Äôs nothing compared to the situation Trump has pushed this country into.  We‚Äôre probably in the worst shape we‚Äôve been in over 150 years.
All of the mutant inbred kids of Oligarchs get to "invent" stolen technology while a Socialism using fascist government holds their hand Trump's uncle try to claim that Tesla's patents stolen by the FBI or useless Except that 80% of the technology we use today COMES FROM TESLA so
Looks what it's done for trump
It amazes me that people can know something's wrong with Trump but haven't thought to google "Trump psychology".  The APA and MSM helped muzzle them but I really think most of us have *chosen* to ignore expert warnings.
No it actually wasn't. Trump hyperinflated the market prior to Covid, which meant it would crash at any point. Not would, but could. The economists have been saying this for years.
This is outrageous. DeSantis needs to pull his head head out of Trump‚Äôs ass and listen to the medical experts. He is already responsible for a spike in the number of Trump virus patients and deaths. He will be responsible for even more.
Remember when Americans decided who the president would be?
So to clarify:  was talking about Kanye but I'm going to leave this here anyway because I think it's important to understand.  It depends on your definition of mental illness. Many of Trump's cult share one or more of his mental defects, if you prefer this term.
I don't know much about Kanye but I do know from what I've learned that malignant narcissists like Trump attract like-minded people. Every single member of #Cult45 shares one or more of Trump's mental defects.
MAYBE widely available several months into 2021...
Not trump
I've been saying this just about every day for months:  Trump and all of his enablers who publicly denied and downplayed #COVID19 killed Americans. They should be tried at the Hague.  #GOPGenocide #ItIsWhatItIs
But remember for privileged leftists re-electing trump might be ok but for those on margins it‚Äôs a huge difference with real consequences. Note Chomsky backs Biden.
Why do you give Trump a platform for this garbage?
One of my favorite Trump gems of all time. From the Trump Organization websites, under "inspirational quotes" From DjT himself, this pearl of wisdom. ü§´. Ahem "You're Going to have to Think Anyway, So Why Not Think"  Well, there you go.
Danger lurking. Republicans will move away from trump but to someone equally as destructive but more palatable to Americans. Beware! And beware of Lincoln Project and their ultimate goals.
Just FYI, you're most likely arguing with a Qbot here. There are several million following Trump's account. They still get me too sometimes.
Trump so screwed up and bitter.   Now he‚Äôs gonna screw with mail in ballots?  He‚Äôs a liar. New story same old claims of fraud.   November can‚Äôt come soon enough.   He‚Äôs getting worse.   We should all be scared. No telling what he could do.
FUCK Dü§Ænald Trump!! #OrangeusDumbasseous
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ That's funny..... Trump saying someone else is not worthy because of 'race rhetoric'.
Sadly for now, far too many in the GOP work for and profit from Putin. Maybe when tRump is put in prison in 2021, patriotic Americans will be encouraged to hunt down these parasite magats for free.
Can Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúpeople‚Äù be any worse than this? Tone deaf monsters! Insensitive asses.
Its like Trump listened to John Lennon's "Imagine" and thought. I could blame that on Joe Biden. Smhü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
What‚Äôs the Trump lawyers‚Äô next delay tactic?
Have your Trump family denied rental to black and Hispanic lately??? Or treated them less as your worker with less pay or better opportunities at all you businesses to this day .  You and your family are the biggest example of why there is such racism in America.
There is no excuse for Trump, hold powerful people accountable
Can I just clarify that it isn't the entire PNW. The farther you get from Seattle, the more Trump signs you see. It is just the urban pockets that are primarily crazy. Too many colleges in one space maybe?

You should have seen the ballot for Governor in Washington state. It had people running as: Republican Trump Republican Pre2016 Republican.  This was on the ballot!
why are the same way you did Mr. Trump! When you voted early-we and the people followed suit
Donald Trump is the biggest #Biblicalidiot there is. He always told everyone he‚Äôd be number 1
Michelle would galvanize the Party and trump would be wiped out and Dems down ballot would romp too.
I just saw that trump has banned payments to Tencent and stuff and I think that‚Äôs stupid because it‚Äôs literally quarantine, people are relying on video games to stay sane and keep a job and you‚Äôre gonna make it so half of the game companies can‚Äôt do anything like wtf that‚Äôs dumb!
How about Trump‚Äôs promise to release his taxes? Where is the wall Mexico was going to pay for? Where is his ‚Äúgreat‚Äù healthcare? Why didn‚Äôt the virus disappear ‚Äúlike a miracle?‚Äù

Trump is such a fool. He can't go soon enough. All this crap is distraction from COVID of course. 1200 deaths today alone.
Donald J Trump December 19 2019 still your President
Trump and Republicans have blood all over their greasy hands.
I am absolutely positive that THAT is exactly what Biden &amp; Trump's owNER wants people to think TWO FALSE CATEGORIES ONLY If you don't believe the wmds russiagate incubator babies media you have to be you ABSOLUTELY have to be a Cheeto lover or a PRO-WAR Obama "democrat"üôÑ STUPID
The Marxists would love it but Mr. Trump would never allow himself to be humiliated like this.
What‚Äôs really sad about you Mr. Trump is that you don‚Äôt realize that America is already great-now granted you‚Äôve dented it a few times here -once Jo is in place it will be back to that for greatness again
Oh sure ,Trump reads a bible it's called I love Hitler
Gotta be one of Trump's "good people"
Trump supporters,seriously want to know,how you can still support Trump.hes taking away your healthcare ,your ability to work bc of covid19.. He has not done one good thing for America.160'000 deaths bc he didn't bother to care in October of last year he knew about it back thenüëá
Trump trying to slow down the post office is just one more offense  he will be tried for in his trial   He will go to prison ,along with the ole Republicants   who won't do a thing to stop his reign of terror on America
You are so right I just don't get it..they know Trump has destroyed America,and they do nothing.  .I'm just so angry
Not ‚Äúblaming every tragedy on Trump‚Äù but absolutely am on this one: 162,000 now dead. Over 1,000 dead per day for last 11 days in a row. This is insane!
Trump is a kid who didn't do the homework lying that they did
Yes #TrumpKillsSeniors  But let's not forget that Trump is also killing these groups:  minorities people with pre-existing health conditions people in blue states  #TrumpGenocide
Aww, I think it is ‚Äúcute‚Äù Trump thinks he has a shot at winning the election. Hahaha! Not a chance!
Vote for Trump the biggest POS alive!  What he doesn't insult you with his pandering to black voters. Wow.
Trump‚Äôs too busy for all this nonsense.
The tweet started with ‚ÄúUS President Trump says‚Äù so we knew it was a lie right off the bat.
If there is a God, Trump will be watching Biden as POTUS from a prison cell.  Narcissists are always the victims in their own eyes.
Trump just says things and throws ‚Äústuff‚Äù out there to see what will stick or what he can make people believe. Biden wants to hurt God? What?
Please don‚Äôt get tired of doing something about what Trump is doing to our country. He still is continuing to do things that Congress should get involved for. Why aren‚Äôt you? Are you sick and tired of dealing with him? It is Congress‚Äô job to fight him every step of the way.
LOL it also appears that I thanked  for calling out Trump's BS when in fact it was Bot Sentinel.
More like conservative-leaning Independents now.  GOP is pretty much owned by Putin, and a thoroughly polluted cesspool, thanks to Trump and his sycophants.  Back to the drawing board. Try to learn from the mistakes. Start from scratch. Raise. The. Bar.
Michelle Obama! Biden would completely clean Trump‚Äôs clock and Democrats would surge down the ballot. We want Michelle! #MichelleObama
Trump and Republicans sending us all straight to hell with their gross inaction on this raging pandemicü•∂ü¶†
Listen, Trump got this message directly from g-d when he was reading ‚Äútwo corinthians‚Äù last night. C‚Äômon people - He clearly knows a lot about Jesus and the Bible and all of the guns that were in the Bible.
There is only one outcome when you give a malignant narcissist like Trump power over life and death.  Death.  #GOPGenocide
I have heard several different Trump voters say yes, but the reasons were physical attractiveness...
ok, that's completely fair - my failure to acknowledge the very real and present threat to people from even the Democratic party.  But I don't know of any case in which that harm would be greater under Biden than under Trump.

Honestly, sometimes my biggest worry is all the so-called "leftists" that behave as if they think Biden is worse than Trump. yeah, Biden is not a great candidate and I don't expect him to bring much, but at this point, not being actively malicious is a huge step up.
Fantastic news! Now do the Trump Organization.
How long before Trump tweets "They're trying to take your guns!"  ???
Didn‚Äôt the NRA donate $40 million to the 2016 trump presidential campaign? I wonder where that $40 million came from?
This is exactly the Trump strategy I mentioned. Good example.
It is Trump Admin that has politicized school openings. Facts: Adults teach kids in school &amp; kids return to homes w/ adults in them - Fewer kids get sick - but more &amp; more they r spreading it to those who do. Just another failure of this admin to see beyond their own "wants"
This is response about Inslee.  Now, I'm not sure how one can tear down a candidate because of their immoral actions and support Trump.   This is the Trump strategy: Accuse others of things everyone knows he himself has done. It's plain as day.
Tried to listen to a rational debate FOR Trump &amp; it is too infuriating. This video proves there really is no rational defense for this man to be President.
America is struggling to denounce an openly and vehemently racist president. Racism will be what destroys this country. The irony is that every white person in power should have had the moral impetus to stop this but didn't. This country deserves to burn.
¬´Pompeo warned that Trump‚Äîlike Barack Obama‚Äîwould be ‚Äúan authoritarian President who ignored our Constitution.‚Äù¬ª What a statement! Seems like he shares his boss's talent for projection.
Please continue investigating this Kodak scam. It was so obvious when trump announced this ‚Äúdeal‚Äù out of the blue that it was a scam. But such an obvious, awkward theft. The #GOP has allowed trump to steal at will. Vote  in 2020.
He can‚Äôt do that!
Wow I just went down a scary rabbit hole on twitter. So many fucking nut jobs even in the seattle area. Trump loving QAnon crazies boasting about not wearing masks &amp; how this is a hoax. Not always the kinds of people you‚Äôd think. I just can‚Äôt with this idiocy. America is doomed.

Seriously? Trump would pulverize Biden. His only hope for a debate win against POTUS would be the "Trump-is-a-bully" media blitz that would inevitably occur thereafter.
Why would they even *want* to "get Trump off the debate hook"? Have you listened to the former VEEP lately? He can barely articulate a coherent answer to an innocuous question. His only hope in a debate is the sympathy factor.
Trump only cares for himself
Controversial budget cuts at the United States Postal Service are raising concerns about the next stimulus check and the 2020 presidential election. The cost-cutting was enacted by the Postmaster General, Louis DeJoy, who was chosen for the job by Trump.
The facts are trump doesn't want mail in ballots because his friends in Russia won't be able to influence the election electronically

I would think you would first be complaining about the way the money was handled by the Trump administration in the business loan section of the first Cares Act Bill. Why aren‚Äôt you?

So if Trump wins, it won't matter to him because he'll have another 4 years to trample our constitution and consolidate power.  If Biden wins, Repugnicons will blame him and the Dems.  Either way, America will lose when it all comes crashing down.
The question is: how long will this last? All Trump needs to do is keep his house of cards standing until November.
Sorry... Would be nice to have a convo instead of whatever this thing is that trump supporters are doing? I am open to understanding and always open to new education when there is information I haven't found yet. What's wrong with the truth? What wrong with another person's view?

Let's ask Republican senators if they wouldn't mind reigning him in.  Oh wait! They already had a chance but decided to pretend that Trump's brain isn't hard wired for criminality. Guess Americans will just have to keep dying for their delusions and greed.

Do you have any idea what has happened? Go listen to congressional hearings on these accusations that started before Trump was even elected. It‚Äôs all there for you. I bet you like Antifa too.
Trump is the worst kind of person humanity has to offer. Every day he gives us more evidence of who he really is:  a sociopath/sadist extremely narcissistic paranoid delusional  All are common defects of history's most brutal dictators. He will get worse.
I'm with ya, here...  But is it bad I would rather be a part of the alternate reality where Trump was never President and we have Congressional inquiries as to how Hillary Clinton could have allowed 10 people to die of COVID-19 since January?
Trump, when are you going to worry about the Pandemic?
Trump, your full of crap!
That ballot was funny and scary. The party affiliations.  Trump Republican. Pre2016 Republican.  Those two really caught my attention.
I recall when Washington state and California, along with others, did this because yes again the Trump Administration has abandoned the citizenry.

Remember when Trump learned his acting skills in the WWE where buddies practice together all week long but then pretend to be "enemies" the night of the Big show and now pretends HIS media is his enemy and gets people to believe it by calling it fake news? YEAH ME TOO NO #
Remember when Trump's media tried to claim that someone else was meddling in our electionsbut the front runner with the most points was continually put at the bottom or left out of the picture completely? #TrumpsMedia
Remember when all of these presidents didn't use their media to lie to the public because presidents like Trump don't control the media? Yeah me neither

Trump is hands down the biggest loser. Well, next to America.
Sohel, it is the Dem run states that are destroying our economy.  Trump saved it from open borders and open travel from China which Dems wanted - can you imagine the amount of COVID deaths if Dems got what they wanted?  Also nothing illegal about Trump's edicts.

Trump says he's planning executive order requiring insurers to cover pre-existing conditions, something already established in ObamaCare which he's trying to dismantle

So stupid. Could it be any plainer Trump thinks he can win votes by destroying things and then claiming credit for trying to rebuild what he destroyed?
Maybe the Republicans want trump to look as bad as possible so he will loose the election.  Maybe they are not so secretly on our side.   Maybe they hate him enough to put Americans through all of this.  I see no other reason for what they are not doing.

Trump acts like he controlled this. He has little to no influence on labor relations. Trump is the last person who should he touting about saving high paying jobs, when he is notorious for hiring cheap labor and not paying them.
please someone cover the fact that Trump just said the people he invited for the ‚Äúspeech‚Äù in New Jersey didn‚Äôt have to wear masks because they are a peaceful protest!
Right before Trump was asked my the spectators at his speech weren‚Äôt all wearing masks and he said because it‚Äôs a peaceful protest they don‚Äôt have to! Looks like he‚Äôs getting ready to start having rallies again but call them protests! Mark my words
Oh yeah some people say Putin has Trump's face set up as a dart board in his office.
If you were or are president we can plan on this being the usual.  Also,  how can you blame Trump for this? You haven't really left your basement and you would expect all Americans to do the same,  so it would be worse under you.
I'm sure they're not, but I hope "democratic leadership" notices how Republicans are trying to paint Joe freaking Biden as the next Che Guevara.    You could run Mitt Romney against Trump and they'd call him a Marxist. It's no reason to not back actual progressives.

Yes thanks for reminding me since that was irrelevant to the discussion at hand - but yes Trump should also resign. He and Cliff can resign together and talk about how much they both think climate change is a hoax.
Trump himself said "it is what it is." So why is it a simplistic conclusion to think this was his plan? We can't know for sure what his motives are but the facts certainly don't prove this wasn't intentional.

Christ=Christian.Christ's example was feeding the poor &amp; needy, healing the sick, commanding, "Love your neighbor as yourself, &amp; Do not judge lest you be judged." Trump lets 160,000 people die in a pandemic by not doing his job.But loves the #Bible. Yeah, right.  #Biblicalidiot

Eight years of steady leadership and sensible regulation did more for prosperity than Bush's deregulation or whatever the fuck Trump's plan to the extent that he has one is.  This is why I vote for centrist mainstream Democrats like Biden, Obama, and Clinton.
And the kinds of Americans who have traded citizenship, community, and austerity for the moral decay of celebrity worship and me-first thinking see him as their avatar and love him for it.  Trump is not the problem. The people who voted for him are the problem.
It's what we learned about every time Trump has been in the news for the last 40 years.  Anyone who acts surprised at this hasn't been paying attention, and Trump's popularity has always been the most glaring symptom of America's moral and societal decay.

Do you truly believe this Trump ? you are going to be so sorry when you lose and wonder where God was ,he was with the other side you dolt
Also can we just point out that Trump then said TIE-land immediately after. So he doesn‚Äôt even pronounce it Thigh-land. He‚Äôs just a dummy and didn‚Äôt connect the word he saw with the Country so he said it as it was spelt then realised it was a Country. Just dumb and unqualified.

I blame lazy GOP Senators like Grassley for failing to stand to Trump‚Äôs incompetence. Americans pay the price while Chuckles goes on vacation.
Watching President Trump and Biden go at it, is going to be a lot like Billy Madison's speech about the puppy.
I‚Äôve watched you make an absolute fool of yourself trying to hold on to your racist, selfish ignorant insides but still be a self respecting woman! You do not get it both ways! Either your FOR America or your for tRump there is no grey areas! #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare

I think the Trump Organization should move to Sing Sing and lead a very reflective and remorseful life.   Jesus - he is a fucking moron.
In 2016 I voted for Hillary. I did not like her as a candidate. I had no idea who Tim Kaine was nor did I care.  What I did see coming was the shitshow (which we have now) that would happen if Trump was elected.

The crazier they get the more people will vote for Trump.  Sadly MSM has people thinking they are justified to behave this way, and that the majority of the world supports them.
I certainly hope it‚Äôs an announcement of Trump‚Äôs arrest.
There is nothing he has done that is positive. The GOP must answer for their denomination of Trump. That means they support everything he has said or done. Remember that as you vote.
That is all women need; this woman using pussy as a crude, sexist description of women. She doesn‚Äôt think highly of herself. That is what 3.5 years of Trump does.

Biden should call Trump and tell him if he drops out of the race, he might consider a pardon! Then when it hits the fan, Biden tells Trump "April Fool's!" Or "Fake News!" üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Anyone want to bet the prosecutor and Investigators got warnings? Trump runs like a wannabe mafia. Sends his cronies to scare people from testifying. I'm pretty sure Epstein was a Trump hit.
I am sure some of Trump's cronies are trying to intimidate the prosecutor right now. I sure hope the NY Prosecutor is being guarded big time.
These pigs don't hyperventilate. They expect and think their lawyers will protect them. But!! You can tell when desperation kicks in. And the crime family is showing pure desperation.   I would say the Trump crime family is a bunch of sweating pigs right now.

Don't believe Trump or GOP.  They constantly lie!
One problem with this analysis: Only about 30 percent of registered WA voters voted in primary, vs. the 78 percent who are likely to vote in the general (based on 2016 numbers). Trump will drive turnout big time from indie, #WalkAway dems, &amp; casual/ first time voter support.
NY probably has enough evidence to justify trump‚Äôs tax records. One way or another trump‚Äôs screwed. Barr  can only protect trump so much, Barr could face possible charges himself. How long can republicans support him? The worm is turning. Vote
Trump's gonna lose, and you know it. Just look at our country! It's f#cked big time with Trump at the helm. Let's just say the virus didn't happen.... We are still so f#cked. Trump's done.... He is finished.
What kind of president ignores a virus and gets 160,000 Americans killed in less than 4 months? Trump has literally Bankrupted this nation. And the division he has created is the worst it's ever been. You actually think Trump is doing a good job? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
No one cares about Trump any more. They waited too long to abandon him tho.
If you really wanted to win the presidency, shouldn't your goal be to beat Biden AND trump?  Do you believe trump is helping you run so you can be president, or are you allowing yourself to be used and made a fool of, so trump can try to win another term? You look bad either way.
Great.... Now Trump is gonna try and get them killed now? Look what Trump did to his friend Herman Cain!! Racist Trump is literally trying to kill all his "black" friends. So sad.

So she is voting for Trump we know
Sorry, no clarification needed. He stepped in it once again. For pity's sake, Biden is in mid-stage dementia. He needs to retire. This Dem trainwreck of a candidate is painful to watch, &amp; I am even a Trump supporter.
maybe we should pretend blm and acab are slurs so that trump supporters might start saying it

Yes, Trump is a little pissy at his turnout in Tulsa, so he is penalizing the kids..

Are SOME conservatives so stupid they would take medical advise from a known idiot? There are no proven facts that Hydroxychloroquine works on Covid 19! If you believe that, maybe it's good to shoot up bleach, because Dr. Trump says that is good too! #CONSERVATIVESBELIEVEANYTHING

A national boycott of Trump? No interviews from media. No articles written about him. (Unless urgent, then minimal, "the president" but not his name), none of us non-maga respond to a tweet or comment on his tweet. Just black him out. He Would Lose His Absolute Shit.   ;)
Its interesting too: none of us trust Trump. So if he said a vaxx was safe, we'd be skeptical af.  But his fans trust him. Yet, if he said a vaxx was safe, they wouldn't believe him either, since they're anti-vaxx/pro-conspiracy.
she's garbage, will vote for trump no matter what
The D strategy of donate to us or you'll get a Trump Republican in office just shows the problem with our whole polarized electoral system. Culp advances to General, but R moderates Garcia, Fortunato get 5%? This system is broken. We need RCV.

tRump would make a big deal of it, you know. They *should* debate just so people can see the clear difference between someone who speaks in full sentences and is coherent with actual plans (that would be Biden), and someone who only has a vocabulary of about 200 words (tRump).

SW WA and E. WA are much more like middle America than Seattle area. In CD races close 2 years ago, Trump R's swept.
Yeah I live in Trump country not disagreeing. Just the parties have so completely changed. Many people who identify as "Republican" do not identify with anything Trump, they identify with Dwight Eisenhower.
Republicans tend to vote early in mail in, but Trump R's are sweeping Congressional races in WA. In tight races two years ago, Trump R's already have over 50% of votes.  Don't assume  is going to sweep or the Senate will flip.
yea a little odd but President Trump is the last thing from a dictator imo. I think he‚Äôs just using some hyperbole here

Jonathan is right. Trump is so wrong. Trump is such an embarrassment to our country!
You should watch this whole #axiosonhbo interview. But this part was insanity - Trump says he doesn't trust any country, even US, on accurate case numbers. So they talk about deaths. Trump refuses to understand we have the worst deaths as % of population. Bonkers.
It was rather sad. Trump pleading for someone to believe him, look at his graphs, see?! See?! I did good??! Don't you see??! Like a child, trying to prove what a good job they did.  Trump actually seems like he misunderstand the facts so hard, that he thinks he is doing well?
That moment was amazing.  Honestly, the restrain shown in people like  or #ChrisWallace when they interview Trump, is astounding. Can you imagine hearing about "the manuals," pushing back, then having to just swallow it and move on to the next absurd line?
On why Trunp voters like him.  Because he hurts the people they think deserve it. Because he tells them its OK to be hateful too.   Trump is the opposite of appealing to the better angels of our nature.
They don't. There's no way anyone, ever, of any political views, could listen to Trump - truly listen - and feel like he is intelligent.
This is absolutely excellent.  facial expressions as he cuts through Trump's BS - it's sad, really, watching Trump pleading with him to look at his photocopied graphs, begging to be told how great he's done, clearly not understanding the data. Watch it: #axiosonhbo
This interview was extraordinary. I'd never seen this interviewer before - his style seems perfectly fitting for Trump's bs. He threw in flattery occasionally to hold him, but his biting critiques and quick wit were sharp jabs that Trump didn't always notice, but much amused me.
At some point Trump is going to flee the country
I love too that the ones who use sheep are like, "nuh uh, thats not true because Trunp said so and I blindly believe every word he says and ignore all else and follow him like a cult leader and I'm no sheep listening to so-called experts when I have THE VOICE OF TRUMP."
I was thinking more...
Trump can send him to school then and there is no issue. Baron
By the way there is two republican parties now, Republican Party and Trump Republicans. Think I‚Äôm kidding? Look at your ballot. That means you can be a Republican and not support Trump.

You and your fellow Republicans have had ZERO interest in the debt while Trump is in office, but now you see that there is going to be a Democrat president suddenly you are very concerned about it.
Its interesting that its 99% of the time white, Trump supporters, high odds of being "christian," who go out and verbally, physically, mentally abuse others. Arrogant entitlement, clinging to a participation trophy, expecting special treatment and allowance to break the rules.
You must be kidding me?  Trump tweets about his fishing expeditions most every day.  The stupidity of the GOP is completely astounding.
He lost his job, his boyfriend left him, got his car repoed,  got evicted, his dog bit him and his cat clawed his eyes.  But he still supports Trump "100%"
Really is amazing how stupid Trump supporters are isn‚Äôt it.

Believe it, Trump‚Äôs lying, racist, golfing 285 times ass is done
To whoever broke my sis window while she was working YOU A BITCH!! White Trump Supporters! 4300 West Way Yakima Wa ‚ù§Ô∏è do what you want w that info
True! But I see TDS on both sides.   Trump supporters can be just as delusional about his virtues as the haters are about his flaws. I'm stuck in the middle. I believe he is the worst prez ever (stupid, divisive, ignorant), but the fake news makes him look worse that he really is
Man you have no clue do you, oh look from Michigan.  They have done nothing, guy buy another Trump hat and staple it to your head.
She has proven to be a Trump stooge since she walked on stage at the first briefing.
Does that really excuse Trump being a kiss up?
Karen Bass has praised Fidel Castro and Donald Trump praised Xi Jin Ping, and Vladimir Putin. Shame on both!
You're right  - thanks for correcting me!  When I said "So is Trump" I should have said "The same could be said of Trump if we use the same guilt by association and innuendo that is often used against the Clintons" but the Epstein docs may be changing that w/ evidence
No one but Trump‚Äôs sickos gonna watch it anyway
I haven't accused anyone of any crimes in this thread.   I merely pointed out that the "guilt by association" can be used against Trump as easily as anyone else.   Is Clinton mentioned in the Epstein docs? I've just begun looking at them. Excerpts are posted by
Trump is not the only one creating division.
Well, at least Fox News knows how to photoshop! Why do you think they clipped Trump OUT of the pic with Epstein? A rather convenient "accident" wouldn't you say?
I never claimed not to be ignorant on the relation between Trump and Epstein. That's why I ask for information and tweet facts whether or not they help Trump. And learned two things: 1) There's no evidence Trump went to the island, and 2) Trump said the island was a cesspool.
Now do Trump and Fauci!

You can bet that if Stan has Twitter in January he would have criticized Trump from stopping flights from China.
Trump and the GOP are making a New New Deal necessary. The latest from
The pics &amp; video show Trump on friendly terms with Epstein in the presence of dancing women. In context of his long term behavior as a "sexual predator" (his words, joking about himself on Stern's show) make it easy for his enemies to make connections that may or may not be valid
Why do you say that to me? I never said the pedo island stuff is a conspiracy theory. But if you asked, I would say that PizzaGate was nutty as a fruitcake.  I'm no fan of Trump but I expose the fake news when they lie about him, like CNN's "Fine People" hoax.
Nice try but Trump is in a video partying with dancing women and telling jokes in Epstein's ear. But he also publicly denounced his island as a cesspool. Need to account for all the facts.    Pro tip: Calling people a dunce reflects more on your intelligence more than the other's
And I learned something that I doubt any Trump hating news source would publish. Here he is in 2015 calling Epstein's island a "cesspool" and implicating Prince Andrew.
Do you really want to be the kind of person that falsely accuses strangers  ? I LOVE facts! And I freely admit when I'm wrong. Case in point: I didn't know Trump had not gone to the island. But then again, I didn't say he did! I just said he was in pics with Epstein.

And TRUMP has never said "GRAB EM BY THE PUSSY"? Hypocrites are amazing
And so is TRUMP who is in pics with Epstein.
What are you talking about? TRUMP is in pictures with women and Epstein.
Why isn't TRUMP in that picture?

Trump wants to ban Tik Tok but not the KKK  Trump wants to postpone the election but still open up schools   This man makes no fucking sense..
Sure thing troglodyte.  I can show you 100 videos from the last 2 nights when Trump‚Äôs goons didn‚Äôt gas anyone it was a peaceful protest and everyone went home by 1am.   Trump and Barr lost bigly
Bill Clinton traveled with Epstein.  So did Trump. If Clinton is guilty by association then so is Trump.
Guess what it‚Äôs evey Poll!!!!!   Trump is gonna get his ass handed to him
Currently in America, we have violent protesters who are vandalizing statues of historical figures, and racist and homophobic clowns all over the place, complete with a plague that trump himself unleashed on our nation, and trumps complaining about tictoc?
Sounds like what should be written on Trump's gravestone

So...what's with Trump wanting to ban TikTok? I don't use it, but how is it a threat to him?

I think the ones being led by the Moron Caucus is going to die eventually. They don't believe science, masks, medical experts or anything.  And Trump is happily killing off not only his base, but his own party's at the same time. lol
tRump came of age in the late 60s, early 70s, and the only thing he ever got from that exciting period were the drugs, which most of us outgrew. He didn‚Äôt do Woodstock or experienced anything like Haight-Ashbury or the Summer of Love. For tRump it was only money and hate.
He's either selectively ignorant, politically stupid, woefully insane, or is just fucking up so bad that he's trying to claim any kind of credit from his predecessor.  I don't think Trump realizes how outclassed he is on the issues we now face as a nation.
Also, Culp has admitted in his interview to voting for Donald Trump. If we get  for WA Governor, we are going to become the next Florida when it comes to COVID-19 management. It will become a shitshow. A disaster.

Trump is a serious threat to our lives.  #TrumpPerpWalk2021
I‚Äôm seriously afraid if you don‚Äôt come up with a temporary extension or an agreement soon, then Trump will pull some executive shit or try to and people will think he‚Äôs some sort of hero. Don‚Äôt help him get re-elected.

Dear trump supporters: He really does believe you all have brains no bigger than gnats. An executive order to protect pre-existing conditions which is already the law under the Affordable Care Act?  Please tell me not right about your brains.
Last year my daughter was a sophomore in DECA, they missed out going to Nationals but her favorite event last Feb was signing up seniors who would be 18 in Nov to vote. She was really happy that most of them didn't support Trump, for our rural town that's pretty amazing.

Wow, Trump's news conference was full of executive orders such as cutting out Big Pharma middlemen, and assuring that our country cannot be charged more for drugs than any other country. He was on fire!
Obama Care from  TRUMP!
I would hope not, then again some black people STILL support trump! Who knows what‚Äôs to come in the fall.
Fox won't even cover Trump's "news conference" they cut away just like the other stations...
I thought about sending trump campaign an audition recording for inauguration 2017, but I think he got no-talent pretty well covered.
The key factor in the recession was predatory lending by the banks, now I don't agree with everything Obama did however in his 8 years in office he got the economy and jobs back on track. Trump inherited it and blew it...
Yes, he kept leaving things out. He never recieved a security clearance either. Trump over road it!

You are a fool if you actually believe that Democrats WANT to keep things closed, we would love to be back to normal, we aren't because of Trump's lack of leadership.

"A U.S. government intelligence report released on Friday says China is actively interfering in the 2020 election process against President Donald Trump's campaign."  I guess this means Biden will be an illegitimate president, too.

I thought Trump lived the poorly educated, though?
You trying to spin millions of people on unemployment as a success is rich.  You trying to spin people who have lost their jobs because of Trump's failed pandemic response and then being called back to work as "jobs created" is equally as rich.
Trump stares into the sun during an eclipse and thought we delivered "F-52s", which only exist in the video game Call of Duty, to Norway.  He has also told more publicly documented lies than any other president in this country's history.

They did that with Regan, admittedly we didn't know much about Alzheimer's back then but it's clear he was suffering from early signs of it in the last couple years of his term. It's hereditary and Trump's dad had it so I wouldn't be surprised if he did.

im sorry yall but trump built so different. like he cant even stand correctly
A significant part of Trump‚Äôs support in 2016 was from those over 65. Playing the old person card is not very smart...

Probably zero. Perhaps a different answer if looking at competence.  BTW, unlike a state, the federal government, which Trump leads, is the *sole* sovereign entity in this case.

Biden would at least keep the police restrained, while Trump would outright unshackle them and turn them loose on us.  I'm taking the attitude that due to the two-party system, Biden's our best choice, and we can choose to fuck over Corporate Democrats in the next 4 years 1/2
It's Trump's fault! Rather than deal with her personal feelings and finding healthy solutions for HER anger, she falls into her self made trap. It's the fault of other people. HRC and others fall into the same trap. Slaves to self.

So it‚Äôs okay for Trump who thinks the virus is a hoax or under control or whatever BS he is spouting this week to cancel the RNC and plan to accept the nomination in a politicized WH. But, Joe can‚Äôt cancel the DNC when he has been responsible with masks and social distancing.
No. But I'm sure  will have his usual inane commentary for the mindless MAGAts. Trump looked like the asinine fool he is in that interview. A man who's incapable of executive decisions regarding toilet paper, let ALONE executive decisions about OUR country!
Dr. trump thinks he has all the answers. For a man who has never attended any public school, how would he know? He is only thinking about the economy and the election (and himself).
I saw Rep. Jim Clyburn in an interview. He made some VERY astute observations. He compared Hitler &amp; Mussolini to Putin &amp; Trump. He's got a point.  has stated he's made several calls to Putin &amp; refuses to state about WHAT. Trump's getting marching orders.

By that logic she is still incorrect. This would mean that the ACA does not cover pre-existing conditions for all heart insurance plans. Maybe not all citizens have plans that fall under protection of the ACA, Trump‚Äôs executive order would cover this under ALL health insurance

And yet even weak Obama imposed sanctions that pissed off Russia so much they colluded with Flynn in December before Trump took office and Flynn promised the sanctions would go away
Can we just get a class action lawsuit going against Trump and his Post Master General?  Everyone depends on the post office; many for medications they need to live.  Trump is endangering millions of lives in addition to his indifference toward the Coronavirus.
Also, dumbass, "cancel culture" is capitalism 101.  Every American citizen has the right to spend their money as they see fit and if thst means boycotting a company for a practice or stance, that's their right.  Trump does "cancel culture" well.

You obviously don't understand the word corrupt.   So many of Trump's appointees have been dismissed for their criminal activity.   And so many rank and file workers have quit because of the crime going on around them, like Barr tanking cases.
I bet Trump's people are brainstorming how they can tie COVID-19 relief to having to prove you voted Republican in November.
Trump's time as a free man is coming to an end....

So Trump wants to repeal and replace the #ACA by opening up the market so any company can sell insurance. Right now, it's illegal for our government to sell insurance to citizens. We must QUALIFY to receive it.  #MedicareForAll insures us all. End the dumbshit!
TRUMP VIRUS IS KILLING AMERICANS.
I love America, that's why I hate Trump and his cronies. You couldn't address anything I stated cuz their is no excuse for defending Trump, his lies, his lawlessness, his subverting of our democracy &amp; democratic institutions, his incompetency, his alienating of our allies...
I love this is this a trend yet? Needs a hashtag, Trump declaring things that are already done... #americaisprettygreatalready or maybe #thanksobama #pleaseclap or idk I know we can think up the correct hashtag
I always judge people based on what they would lie about. William Barr leaning on the FBI to get the result he wanted is exactly something that crook would do.   He has squashed every investigation related to Trump and his donors.
Just FYI, love you guys, but the marketing that comes up before your video is Donald Trump....  hard to like your video with that preamble....
I wonder if they're pissed off that you decided to start arresting press first off tonight?  Chilling the first amendment protections of the press is the action of dictators. Who's giving these orders? Chief Lovell? Ted Wheeler? or are you listening to Donald Trump?
You're not being paranoid at all in my opinion. Trump  is an agent of the Russian government. Even if not in fact he is one in deed. Vladimir Putin is the only world leader he has never challenged in any way ,let alone tried to demean and degrade verbally.

Oh, they realize what they‚Äôre doing and are willing participants. They are nefarious but not stupid and the only real pawn is trump himself.
Trump is actually waging war against my home town. Having DHS is actually igniting tensions  This isn't about protecting federal property.   This is a distraction created by Trump to make people look away from his terrible handling of covid.  #Fascism  #DictatorTrump  #Covid_19
The mandate in #Obamacare for the coverage of pre-existing conditions.  (Sorry, Trump. You're late on this one)  #ThingsMorePopularThanTrump
this is how Trump is going to try to steal the election. pay attention to the changes in the USPS.
Trump couldn't even model wearing a mask and protect his own supporters. Herman Cain died cuz he went to a trump covid rally and you have the nerve to say trump and the GOP care about the sanctity of lifeüôÑ
This comment shows trump's promise of executive orders on COVID relief are a stunt. He knows they're illegal, but he wants to be sued so he can say he's trying to fix the problem &amp; ebil Democrats are suing him. Families will go broke while he plays games &amp; refuses negotiate.
I want #MedicareForAll. It appears that Trump is on the same page as Obama.. and that's ok if you want to continue the ACA.. but it has it's drawbacks, namely MASsIVE DEBT in AMERICA, and STILL unable to insure EVERY HUMAN. We need #MedicareForAll. Now. #CoronaVirus.
Imagine the gay dirt Trump et al have on Lindsey Graham. What else would explain his boot-licking?
Uh he wasn't charged cuz the DOJ mandate stating you can't indict a sitting pres. And the ones not respecting life are trump and the GOP who initially pushed covid as a hoax &amp; havent done a damn thing to stop it. In fact, they push to expose kids and elderly alike.

You do realize this happened almost 3 years ago? And that the FBI has been run by the deep state in opposition to Trump since before he took office? And that he is working to clean house at the FBI? It isn't Trump's FBI by any stretch of the imagination.
Who was it that  said was going to help Trump in the election?
And the city council and mayor are absent. Trump thinks Ted‚Äôs doing a good job, though.
So NOW that you all know that TRUMP and OBAMA are on the SAME PAGE can we GET SOME #MedicareForAll?? WHAT'S IT GONNA TAKE? A PANDEMIC OR SOMETHING?? #ObamaCare #ThanksObama #ACA
Nice deflection. Yes we should hold Russia accountable by imposing sanctions, or doing really ANYTHING! Yet Trump is incapable of doing anything but kissing Putin's ass.
Dream on....  He couldn't come up with a comprehensive healthcare plan that would be way affordable and the best plan ever (Trump's words)...you're gonna love it!  He copies a provision in Obamacare.  That is not a healthcare initiative.
I would be overly satisfied with #MedicareForAll. Trump or Joe Biden don't seem to understand the moral values associated with #MedicareForAll. Where is the compassion for the citizens? MILLIONS in #MedicalDebt. 500k per year file BANKRUPTCY over #MedicalDebt, 40k DIE. It's SAD!
Believe it when the ink dries. Trump tried this with UBI a couple months ago.  Man if he does though that would be a swing.
Nice pic! Says NOTHING! Trump is not Godly! Good luck with your TRUMP WORSHIP!
He did... PPB is out of control, the feds are still here and now Trump is saying he may deploy National Guard troops -  has unleashed hell on Portland.
#ObamaCare #ACA  Hello #America,  if we had #MedicareForAll there would be no need for Trump to issue silly executive orders cos  EVERY SINGLE HUMAN IN AMERICA would be AUTOMATICALLY INSURED. No worries.   WILL FIGHT YOU FOR #MedicareForAll   #MedicareForAll or #GetFired2020!
: yep, vote red, end up dead. trump looking to cut Social Security and Medicare. Hope you don't need to depend on them.
So....this is Trump's replacement of Obamacare?  Paltry attempt of talking an idea from Obama and rebranding it

You Trump MFs have the best humor. Gut laugh over here. lmao holy fuck the further down i go this tweet my laugh get better. Crazy MFs. ü§£ü§£ü§£
I don't think that Trump could do any of that anymore. ANd I'm sure Melania had that remove from her contract in the recent renegotiation.
Trump is right. Its like the flu. It comes and goes but is still around.  Besides, 330 million Americans and only 5 million cases. Where's the pandemic? Not very many cases when you look at it this way. Government over reaction.
Nearly four years and I am still waiting for Trump to be ‚Äúfor‚Äù something of value and believe he is sincere.
Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions ‚Äî a protection which already exists under Obamacare
um. yea.  Trump's first 30 weeks were a long time ago. Have you checked the data on manufacturing jobs lately?
Trump is less than human.

The Department of Homeland Security is a state police agency. Trump has taken another lesson from Putin.
Like Trump isn't doing that now? Give Joe a chance to put together his administration and pass bills, then if he does what you say, then judge him.
This is a sick, sick Trump cult with a side order of Jesus on a stick. Super spreaders.
We all want healthcare. Glad to pay for it, but the prices here are much higher than other countries even though the medical care is worse :/ I didn't know trump promised it, I hope he tries to make it happen.
neither rain, nor sleet, nor snow nor dark of night will stay him from his appointed rounds except this guy who wants to be a stooge for trump
Biden said  it. Not Trump. Not his father. Not in the 1970s. Biden did. Just this week.
Now that's American! Love it - protect your IP. beating trump at his own game üòÇ
How is Trump simultaneously running to the left and to the right of Joe Biden?
Biden still is much better then Trump on this issue:    You can think it doesn't go far enough, but it is miles above Trump.  There's no need to make outflanking takes that make you look not serious.
Well that was chaotic af. The people were good though. The beer was delicious.  Wise man once said, "Forgiveness is divine but never pay full price for late pizza."  Black Lives Matter. Trans rights. Wear sunscreen.  See you motherfuckers on the other side.  Fuck Donald Trump.
I want to know what does Putin and Trump have on them?
Gee, it's not like there was a major, ongoing racist backlash to Obama, and a major emboldening of violent racist groups since both Ferguson and Trump's election.  Those couldn't influence those figures at all I'm sure!
Or more likely, Trump ordered the state of Ohio to beat and arrest anyone that told the truth about their ruler having that virus garbage so the entire state had to lie.  That is the Trump cult.

2024. Trump and Kanye are 2 sides of the same coin as far as vision. But trump needs the next 4 years to finish getting rid of the swamp creatures. That way in 2024 Kanye doesn‚Äôt have to worry about the evil ones sabotaging him how Trump did.
A halt to student loan payments was also proposed by many Democrats in Congress.  It's okay to think Biden doesn't go for enough, but please don't try to insist that Trump is outflanking Biden, even as a joke.  It makes you look not serious.
What country does der Trump live in?
Trump won't win. He won't win even with all your GOP cheating; people are not wanting Trump. Cut bait and cleanse yourself of Trump's evil workings.
What happened to trump‚Äôs health care plan he was going  to announce in two weeks? That was  just another trump lie! Trump is just making shit up, he never plans anything but whatever helps himself!

You should, and the GOP should be looking into why Russia is putting bounties on our Troops, not trying to help Russia get Trump back in the office, shame on you!
We already have coverage for pre-existing conditions, it's called The ACA. What the heck are you talking about? Trump is claiming credit for something Obama did but I guess he's always been jealous of Barack Obama since he will be remembered as a great President unlike Trump.
People keep assuring us foolish minions that Trump can't make the leap to fascism but it is happening.  The USPS. Claims of rigged election. Voter supression. GOP running Putin's playbook. Fed thugs in Dem cities...

IDK if they are doing a bait and switch with Biden. It's very clear to all Americans that senile old Biden is NOT mentally there. He'd fail the cognitive test that he mocks Trump for. But they don't care. They just want power. And to stop the investigations into DNC corruption.

Biden supports student loan forgiveness for most people (everyone making under $125,000), through, so Biden has an even better plan then Trump who is merely delaying loan collection.  You can argue it's not going far enough, but it's still miles above Trump.

At Bill Clinton's funeral he should be lauded as the president who everyone knows was a lot like trump, but not as powerful.
The more I learn of what is going on in the USPS, the more it seems unlikely that Trump can be dislodged from office. This election will almost certainly be decided in the courts or in the House.

Fact: Obama and Biden built the longest economic expansion in American history. Trump turned it into the worst economy in American history in just three years.   It's not my fault you support the worst president in American history. Do better.

Protests didn't put 55M Americans out of work and kill 160,000 of them. Trump did.
With this combined with the obviously bullshit order to extend the unemployment benefits, it's clear Trump's strategy is to just pretend govern. I wouldn't put it past America to buy this crap.

In 2016 donations to the NRA jumped sharply. While in 2012 it spent $9 million, and in 2014 it spent $13 million in 2016, it spent more than $50 million on Republican candidates including more than $30 million on Trump‚Äôs effort to win the White House This money was vital to Trump
I got an email from GOP strategists asking me to respond to a survey, but the survey was whether I supported Trump or Romney.  I really hadn't heard much chatter about running Romney, but apparently someone is thinking about it.
Right wing racism, bigotry, sexism and violence is a threat to this country. But Trump supports that.
It's also going to piss off some underdeveloped third world government, but no one gives a shit about that part, LOL.

At the end of the day, Trump is the President, and he can fire/hire whoever he wants. Take the appointment of neocon Elliott Abrams for Iran Envoy today for example. If America First can‚Äôt shine through, that‚Äôs on him.
There is no longer any surprising me at how stupid Trump thinks his voters are, because they are that stupid.
Holy shit right better headlines. Trump is a known liar. Maybe write what hes actually doing instead of what he says he's doing.
I was talking about you. Turning his comment into yet another anti-Trump screed. You know, the president became a Christian back in about 2015 or so. Heard it from James Dobson whom I trust. That means Trumps old life is under the blood, just like the rest of us.
How do you think  has handled the nation's #coronavirus response? ü§î
"Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions ‚Äî a protection which already exists under Obamacare"
Trump‚Äôs foreign policy approach is like putting a gun to your head in a crowded room then asking everyone to praise you for de-escalating the situation by not pulling the trigger.
The Democrats should be doing everything they can to haul this guy in for public questioning. MONDAY. not on 4 weeks or 6 weeks when it's too late. Trump is actively trying to create the "delays" to voting himself so he can use it in his favor in November.
Trump the pathological lying sociopath only got elected as president because he promise to build border wall &amp; 99% populations are paying dearly because of the ill-advised voting by dumb voters. Prices are too high electing a pathological lying sociopath Trump for border wall.
Same here, except I'm not confident Trump is in our corner. The next week or two should tell an interesting tale.
Earth to Trump and the WH. Thanks to Pres. Obama, people with pre-existing conditions have been covered since 2010. Trump is really desperate isn‚Äôt he?
It is incredibly frustrating. When we see Trump's campaign accepted foreign help, then anything done during their time in office should be reversed: no court picks, no nothing. Should be voided. Sorry, bad behavior shouldn't be rewarded.
Thanks Obama!  Trump and the GOP failed to destroy all of his achievements so now they're trying to take credit for one of them.  They blame him for all of their failures but it's still not enough!  Now watch this video and laugh at their stupidity.
Next, trump will sign an Executive Order dictating Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness...his own idea from his most excellent superior best-in-the-world intelligent brain. #VoteBlueNoMatterWho2020 #VoteBlue2020
Trump is such a liar. Don‚Äôt be distracted. #staywoke
Now the craziest thing I‚Äôll expect in 2020 is Trump admitting Obama is American.
I'm not confident about anything. It appears to be Rice or Harris and I'd actually prefer Harris. She at least is more like Biden, a putrid politician rather than connected to HRC. Trump will win the election but the result may be altered. Are you confident?

I have a friend in local politics who is a New Zealand emigre. If Trump wins this election, maybe I‚Äôll ask her to adopt me, because I want to be part of a country where women lead. I‚Äôd be happy to sign a will contract to make sure I get nothing in terms of inheritance.
Aw. My mom just posted a "vote Trump out, and protest Biden on his very first day of presidency to move him to the left" article and ..  I usually shut these down but I gotta let her have a nice dream for the weekend.
Amen to Dump trump.
Looks like the Bikers for Trump will be dead before Election Day.
How is Trump immune from the virus?
No one is saying trump‚Äôs version will be ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù..
"A new forecast warns that COVID-19 deaths could reach 300,000 by December without widespread use of masks. (IHME) says consistent use of a face covering would lower the figure by 70,000."
Republicans are such flaming assholes. "The Red Line"?! You were cool with the racist, sexist and rapacious party of Nixon, Reagan and the Bushes...until Trump came along and said the quiet parts loud.
Ah yes... first the use of the inverted triangle now the Sieg Heil salute. Might as well and just make it official, Trump.   "Make America Aryan Again".
And?  You realize that your profession has lower trust  ratings than used car salesmen right? And this trend started way before Trump.  You‚Äôre just the symptom of the illness like a skin tag on a diabetic
'Peaceful protest': Trump defends audience at his golf club who did not adhere to COVID-19 restrictions
Donald Trump is the best President of my lifetime.
normalizes Trump.
Of course it's Trump's fault. Protecting the country from foreign threats is first in the job description. Dismantling the government has consequences, especially when you're a moron.
Under President Trump I no longer have rights. I'm forced to wear a useless face diaper if I want to buy groceries and not deal with idiots. My kids can't go to school even though I pay $k's in property tax. Businesses are being shuttered never to return.
I'm sure Trump would love to make a national holiday named after himself. But we already have one coming up.  Its called "Eviction Day". #ONEV1
I guess that‚Äôs the one thing Trump and I have in common.
And then his day got even worse, with the hashtag for ‚ÄúThings More Popular Than Trump‚Äù trended nationwide on the president‚Äôs favorite social networking site.  Here are fourteen things people think may be more popular than Donald Trump -
Can‚Äôt comprehend why she and George are still married... he is so anti Trump!
We pay Barrs bills, but he is beholden only to thug Trump!! ü§¨üë∫
I deplore Trump's cult of MAGA, but I'll say this about them, they've never DM'd death threats to because I'm not willing to vote Trump. That's, sadly, more than I can so for my fellow "liberals" pushing  on me.
Pretty sure I covered that. I‚Äôm voting against the guy who refuses to roll out a national plan to deal with a pandemic. Also pretty sure Biden hasn‚Äôt been president during a pandemic, although he did lead putting together the pandemic playbook... that Trump through out.
Donald Trump is systematically accomplishing all of Vladimir Putin‚Äòs objectives. He has divided the country, has caused enormous economic strife, and caused thousands of American to lose their lives. If Trump is not a Russian asset he is undoubtably a useful idiot.
Aw, he thinks he‚Äôs Trump, now. What a fucking try-hard.
People lost their jobs because there's an out of control pandemic. It's the single greatest national security failure in American history. Trump f^cked up. Bigly.
He probably is. They pushed a terrible candidate. Once again, probably the only losing candidate. Anyone else would be attacking Trump hard right now.
Last month we were asked to pray for Kanye West as he was dealing with a mental health issue. This month Republicans are using him to peel off votes intended for Joe Biden. We didn‚Äôt know Trump was mentally ill but we do know Kanye West is. The GOP thinks we‚Äôre as dumb as Trump.
Trump press conference and EO announcement re: preexisting conditions is meant to cause outrage and distract from his postal service sabotage.  Focus on what affects a free and fair election.
I hope not. No faster way for Haley to tarnish her name, than attaching it to the train reck that is Trump's reelection campaign. She currently stands as the only successful person of Trump's first presidency.
Funny you should mention this... we visited the Grand Canyon last year... gorgeous... but guess what? There's a Uranium mine already there... if Trump is so stupid, rise above him, don't wallow in this idiotic diatribe of junior high school drivel
Trump is common criminal pathological lying sociopath NOT COMPETENT ENOUGH to be president!!!  #Biden2020
Doubt he‚Äôll do a ‚Äúrepentance‚Äù book, because he doesn‚Äôt think he did anything wrong. Will spend the next few months campaigning for Trump, then quietly return to Liberty, with no change in attitude or behavior, once everyone has forgotten.
I'm for the Military. The Miltary is for Trump.  I'm for the Police. The Police are for Trump.  I'm for the Patriots. The Patriots are for Trump.  I'm for God. Trump is for God.  Trump is for Justice. I'm for Trump.  Prepare and be warned.

Huh?! The Affordable Care Act was signed into law in March 2010, ensuring that health insurance companies would cover pre-existing conditions, and is still the law of the land. Being a stupid Trump supporter, on the other hand, isn't covered - or curable - for that matter.
They ‚Äòfailed‚Äô so Trump can look like a hero. Except he of course won‚Äôt.
But that would mean that Trump couldn‚Äôt run his businesses. Or have a place to hide when shit is hitting the fan.

Can a trump supporter please articulate what constitutes a deal breaker? Because most of the country thought calling Mexicans rapists in 2015 was a deal breaker.
We all know how much Trump likes to claim credit for Obama‚Äôs work.
We won‚Äôt get rid of the virus until there‚Äôs a vaccine. As long as Trump is President the federal government will continue to fail its most primary duties.
leaders lead.  Trump simply agitates and divides.   Leadership takes courage, honor, and integrity so I don't expect it from Trump but I look forward to a leader who earns our respect, trust, and allegiance.
Lol. Trump‚Äôs bumbling squad of dickheads manage to remind everyone of Obama‚Äôs achievement. Nice work, Boris.
Yep, but Trump is worse. #NeverBiden #NeverTrump
You want to talk facts? Democrats called his China travel ban "xenophobic" and fearmongering, including Biden. They were against it. Only Trump was trying to do the right thing. Democrats are the failures, along with many governors.

Since ODNI is reporting that Russia's working to boost Trump &amp; undermine Joe Biden...shouldn't that red flag voters that Trump is not the one to vote for?  What's wrong with the comprehension of Trump supporters?   Oh yeah. I momentarily forgot about the hydroxychloroquine thing.
Is there any transgression that Trump can do that would make you pause? You and I are probably light years apart on policy, but I suspect we are close on values.   Decency, trustworthiness, humility, empathy must resonate.   How do you square Trumps moral compass with your own?
As if he acts totally alone, you dumb ass, it‚Äôs Probably Nancy wanting more money for her own causes.   Except of course you never mention that.   Always a Trump hater to the end, which for you I pray is soon!
I thought that Obama made it possible for anything to be done by executive order. Trump has a pen too.
This is turning into the slowest creep towards November. Can we just time travel to this election already?  Trump doesn‚Äôt even like being President. Can someone tell him he can just leave and take his cronies with him?

What about those who support law and order, Second Amendment rights, or even voted for Trump -- but otherwise, aren't bothered by your lifestyle choices and just want to be left alone?
Blah blah blah I hated Trump 3 years ago. Voted for Obama twice. Also had an awful experience with bad cops. My story in that regard was quite devastating, fyi. But the reason why I'm not on board the anti-Trump bandwagon or the anti-police bandwagon is because I think for myself
Trump is common criminal con-man!!!

What‚Äôs your boss, Trump, have to say about the Russian bounties? Maybe you could ask him for your constituents?
Right, so Trump's strategy between now and the election is to issue a flurry of executive orders which merely echo the existing achievements of the Obama years. Fascinating. For a certain class of voters, it might actually work - namely, Fox thralls and other forms of idiot.
When Trump is finally gone and then coronavirus is cured
Watching you DEFEND a proven racist and leader of the KLAN who tried to stop black Americans from having civil rights in your misguided effort to prove a conspiracy theory about Trump is amazing. I can go allllll night. Bring it.
Trump and the  don‚Äôt care about America
Yes, it is. Its users had the audacity to mess with Trump's rally.
Away from people dat are Trump supporters and negative energy. Cut em out and have a good time
I should never drink scotch and watch a Trump rally.  Depressing as fuck.  The USPS massacre news is also depressing.
I can‚Äôt tell if Acosta is a Trump plant or just that idiotic. It‚Äôs a toss up.
where the virus originated has nothing to do with how it was handled after it arrived here.Trump denied the science, mocked those who wear masks, holds rallies with no masks/distancing, pushed states to open prematurely, now wants our kids in school. 160,000 died on his watch.
President Trump on Thursday invoked his emergency economic powers to impose broad sanctions against TikTok, a move that was expected but ratchets up pressure on the Chinese-owned app to sell its U.S. assets to an American company.
It baffles me how Trump would not care any more than this for the lives, the actual, literal lives of the people who apparently do anything for him, including risk their lives. #TrumpVirus
I wonder if Trump will see this and send federal troops to The Performance Center?
This is trump's guy when he needs to say something really, really stupid.  He's the liar who runs gays for trump, blacks for trump etc....   If you were wondering, yes this is as about as low as a human can go and still be considered a human.
trump: ‚Äòoh no, have I been spelling Kanye‚Äôs name wrong this whole time?‚Äô
Sadly yes. I think splitting the vote right now won‚Äôt work. We would end up with trump for four more years and then a conservative Supreme Court and I can‚Äôt risk having the LGBTQ+ rights taken away. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Unless Trump is plaque psoriasis, I've seen no Big Pharma ads to support this claim. (Oh. Wait...)
This is a frequent Trump ploy. Look to see more Democratic-like moves in the coming days as the anti-left Trump runs for reelection, using already established Obama policies.  Ironic, no? Trump is constantly trying to take credit for things the evil Obama has already done?
Fearmongering because Trump sucks so bad? Basically, a tactic of desperation. You lie! It‚Äôs pathetic. You have no shame.
But yes, to your point, Trump DID inherit a good situation and ran with it for 2 years, but his trade war has been a disaster for manufacturing.  I sat in on enough conference calls to know corporations were warning of this in very early 2019.  We hit a manufacturing recession...
By big news do you mean he is taking credit for something that has been federal law for over 6 years?  Is is big because while it isn't an accomplishment at all, it is the biggest accomplishment of the Trump presidency?

My stomach turned when they booed the press and Trump hyped them up so they would do it some more. I can't wait for a return to decency.
So, Obamacare then.  He's invented Obamacare.  Just like Trump to take credit for something he didn't do.

was spot on in her assessment of Trump. His malignant narcissism isn‚Äôt just a personality disorder/quirk - it is something that is critically dangerous in any context. More so during a global pandemic when rational, empathetic leadership is a matter of life and death.

Since trump is determined to destroy all that Obama created, our strategy from the start maybe should have been to tell him Obama wanted to destroy environmental protections, that Obama didn‚Äôt want to insure Americans, that Obama wanted in-person voting, etc.

Whether to extend the supplemental $600 a week in jobless aid has proven to be a key sticking point in negotiations. Democrats have split, some saying the $600 number is a nonstarter and some saying the number is negotiable. So Trump said if negotiations continued to stall...

The scrappy Canadian who vowed to punch 'loud-mouthed' Donald Trump   via
You know that's covered in ObamaCare...which you guys are suing to get rid of, right?    And....he said 'in the next 2 weeks'...which in Trump-world means NEVER.
Donald Trump was such a USFL bully that a fellow owner threatened to punch him
There is no way Biden can get away without debating Trump!  I see what is going on because I have clarity and truth within me.  Thank you Tucker... Thank you for reporting the Truth with sardonic wit sprinkled in!
people who cares about the economy voted for clinton, people who wanted to systematically dismantle democracy so putin could become de factor puppetmaster of the US voted for trump
Why am I not suprised? Before he was President, he sat himself on the dais of a non-profit honoring a gentleman who donated bill bucks. Trump gave NO $$. When the gentleman appeared to be seated, Trump was in his seat and would not move. They had to add a chair for the honoree
You will lose Florida Trump. Call the movers. Your term expires in January.

If I were Donald Trump I wouldn‚Äôt be able to see my own penis.
Anything to kill mail in voting, which trump himself said would if people voted by mail he would lose.
I'm so confused. I thought he was leaving matters up to the states in regards to Covid/reopening.  But now he's trying to take credit?  I always lose track of the Trump train of logic. üòü
Biden should come out and say Day 1, I reverse all Trump's EOs and corruption.  So companies are warned not to invest in any activities based on the next 88 days or after.
Deferring the payroll tax is trump's way of killing Social Security.
Classic Trump !
Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio tested positive, then negative for the coronavirus amid a visit to the state from President Trump. Here's what the case tells us about testing and accuracy.
Idk but I always read Trump's tweets like it's a brat toddler typing it.
Yup. I live in the liberal bubble of Seattle, but I am from Michigan...and a part that LOVES Trump. He has a lot of support. I‚Äôve seen it with my own eyes. Lots and lots of people will vote for him.
I think the carpet looks expensive, but has a very petty-bourgeoisie look to it. Just like everything else about Trump.
Just as trmp took credit for President Obama's Veterans Choice Act, he now is trying to persuade his sheep that only he alone is responsible for requiring insurers to cover pre-existing medical conditions. Laughable!

I was just thinking about how nobody to date has ever stood up to Trump, Russia and Bernie the way Hillary Clinton has. She doesn‚Äôt walk on eggshells around anybody. You can‚Äôt intimidate her. Or bully her into silence. Or beat her down. There‚Äôs no one else like her. No one.
Trump to hold news conference at 7 p.m. EDT (2300 GMT)
Television. Vegetable. Apple. I think Trump thinks it‚Äôs a cognitive test.
You can tell a lot about a political party in how they appeal to voters during a primary election: ‚Äúthe very first issue is supporting President Trump,‚Äù Hagerty said. ‚ÄúFolks in Tennessee want a senator that's going to support President Trump and his agenda‚Äù
Every day of Trump is of course an escalation over the previous but it's really getting to me today.  What do you do when you're convinced we're on the precipice of losing our democracy?
I‚Äôm going to be very interested in Kamala hitting the campaign trail after the release of Vol 5 -the Senate‚Äôs Counterintelligence Report on trump. He‚Äôd know the she KNOWS what‚Äôs behind all the redactions.   What power.
I propose once Biden is in office, the US pull a quid pro quo when Putin is up for election and infiltrate his countries‚Äô voting and election process. It‚Äôs the right thing to do. He needs to be bounced out of office just like trump and who better than the USA to do it?
Look at his awful looking face. Eat your heart out Trump, you will never measure up to Obama‚Äôs class and intellect.
Trump: the sun must rise tomorrow.
Ok ok, Trump's a terrible person.
How convenient to finally, send them at a time that pertinent to Trump's election. Tell them to send the docs where Putin placed bounties on our soilders, ppls husbands &amp; sons, tell them to send those pprs. They cud send Joe's birth cert &amp; DL, idc, I'm still voting Biden
I hear thighland is to humid but YO-SIMITE has lots of rocks. Why would tRuMp advocate those travel destinations! ?
He can't trump up any good news of his own, so he claims the existing policies of Obama?   I suppose since he is such a big fan of Obama's that makes this charade OK.
What have you done Inslee?  Besides losing 1 billion dollars to Nigerians, not paying unemployment to the people of Washington, and complaining about Trump every chance you get? #Nothing
Americans are so proud we have trump to represent us...NOT!
Trump teases order to require insurers to cover pre-existing conditions
It's actually true. The only people who cared about coronavirus early on in the Trump admin were the unhinged china hawks.
If she's willing to do this kind of public ball-gargling for Trump - NOTHING you say will penetrate the mush that used to be her brain before she drank the #KKKOOLAid
When trump shut down the border I remember you are the first man to stand up and against him. I just feel like you are against for everything
Looks like the 2020 U.S. Presidential election will be decided by the country with the best propaganda machine‚ÄîRussia or China. Feeling a bit like a tool, American voter?
I can‚Äôt stand her but, she likes Biden very much. She has no love for Trump. She‚Äôs in Arizona, what difference does it make.

Trump says he'll extend unemployment benefits through the end of the year
So Mitch wont allow any votes unless Trump agrees. Trump "says" he wants a package to help. So why inject McCarthy as the GOP cheapskate/ negotiator? Either trump tells him to agree, or mitch passes whatever BS senate version and they reconcile it w house bill. WTF. Art o Deal???
Context: Trump victories in both TX and FL are in jeopardy and make his re-election even more unlikely.

Arrogant SOB rich people. Too rich to contract Covid. Just to listen to Trump tell lies.  #TrumpIsLosing  Guests at Trump club join audience for president's press conference
Now that Trump has signed an executive order enforcing a principal that already exists under Obamacare he should quickly sign another one declaring that setting a speed in a car above the posted limit is illegal! #EnoughIsEnough ü§£
Trump speaking about Portland Protests: ‚ÄúWe would like to be asked by the mayor or the governor, we will go in and stop the problems in Portland in 24 hours just like we did in Minneapolis after they really hurt that city...‚Äù

It‚Äôs an August primary. Skews older &amp; whiter. Even under Trump, the fundamentals work against Dems. Always have. 08: Gregoire got 48% and basically tied with the GOP aggregate, 12: Inslee got 47% and basically tied with the GOP. 2016: Inslee 49% ... Dems won handily each time.
It is getting to be that time again for Mark Blyth to tell us what is going on.  With trillions being handed out; Trump &amp; the Admin's handling of international relationships, esp China; manufacturing jobs and all of it!  Give him an entire show.  Please.
It's been a LONG time since I've head people clap for Trump.

Sooooo-according to Trump that was unconstitutional-was the only part they were trying to get rid of -before taking on entire law, but an EO by him and it is fine?? WTF -I can see how stupid this is-what are his advisers... #Nevermind
I wouldn't say Trump is a good guy, or that he's not a hypocrite, just that not everything he says is terrible. Is that so wrong? Literally, I say that and people assume I'm a Trump supporter. How f'd is that? There's this fear of the rabbit hole, or slippery slope.
you take care too.  This is global--and although are in much worse shape now than Norway, we really are all in this together.   Once Trump is gone, we will be able to tackle this in the US responsibly and get this under control.
Trump has a mega microphone. He can say what ever wants. But when it come to Health &amp; Welfare of the American people  he has no right spew his poisonous bile. There is a death cult out there that believes what he says to be true. Can't yell fire in a crowded theater. T not well.
Trump was a draft dodger himself and threatened his sons would be disinherited if they joined the military. He still wraps himself in the flag and pretends to be patriotic. He is willing to sacrifice our service members but thinks the military is beneath his own sons.
He has zero chance of winning in this state. The Republicans sold their sole . to the Devil when they didn't stand up to Trump. They are in trouble nationwide for years to come
Why is this even a thing for a poll...I don't see a poll for the BS Trump spouts
States ask that Trump's district drawing order be stopped
Jewish advocacy groups slam Trump's pick for German ambassador for bigoted comments
Left wing media is lying to you. Trump has helped many states. Even blue state Govs such as Cuomo and Newsome thanked Trump for his efforts. It falls on the states to make mask mandates or other laws regarding the virus. The president literally cannot make such mandates.
I'm waiting for the hate-filled tweet from Trump about Fox News ‚åö
After being told that Russia wants Trump re-elected.  Trump: "No one has been tougher on Russia than me!" which doesn't explain why they want him over Biden then.  Also Trump: "We should let Russia back in the G7 and make it G8 again!"  Soooo tough on them.
It seems to be working too!

Fck Trump &amp; his band of assholes.Trump and his "It is what it is" about American covid deaths is a heinous example of a low life person. Not a human being with feelings and empathy.  It's pronounced Tai-land...  It is what it is.... Fool lol üòÇ
I swear - that tweet is the love child of a three-way between Russiagate, "[hated person] doesn't like this picture, so it would be terrible if everyone tweeted it", and condemning Trump for Standing Rock (Feb 2017).  Exuberant stupidity, thy name is #BlueMAGA.
Something I'd love to ask the genius griftacular "consultants" running the DNC:  Did you vote for Trump just because he's white? Or Bernie?  Then why the hell do you expect a Black person to vote for someone just because they're Black?
I proudly voted for Clinton twice and I finally watched John Lewis‚Äôs service, and I can't stomach his being there. Trump and Bill should be in jail for their time with Epstein.
I guess this is called playing to your base who live in the a trump vacuum and don‚Äôt realize that this a HOAX!
Biden should pick Trump as his running mate, then tell Trump he has to step down because he can't run for VP while also being President. 50% chance Trump falls for it.
The fact that he did not bother to show up at a brilliant courageous Mans funeral,show us all we really need to know.john.Lewis was not a fan of Trump, Trump ,was out for revenge ,but for a  brilliant Man ,a real president would have been there no matter what ,to pay his respect
IDK if they are doing a bait and switch with Biden. It's very clear to all Americans that senile old Biden is NOT mentally there. He'd fail the cognitive test that he mocks Trump for. But they don't care. They just want power. And to stop the investigations into DNC corruption.
He's one of Trump's good people
At Bill Clinton's funeral he should be lauded as the president who everyone knows was a lot like trump, but not as powerful.
#SettleForBiden...let‚Äôs face it, we hoped for #BernieSanders and his honest background, but we must go with the MOST progressive candidate. Right now it‚Äôs Biden, but if Trump happens to make student loans 0% interest...well, we‚Äôll see.
depressed,worried ,scared sick of Trump ,other then that,Great  How was your vacation ?  Mine was to the grocery store today I found myself saying to all ,what a pretty mask,wow you made your mask  I'm an empath.  ,So I had to make people proud of the fact that they wear one  .
Did I ever mention the president in this tweet? I‚Äôm not insinuating Trump has any fault here. The problem was caused by both sides and by different policy moves.
"More harm than good to minorities". I've proven that that is a description of Biden, not Trump. I showed you a video of Portland moms aiding felony rioting at the courthouse. I explained that the intel was never corroborated. And only a couple of Dems have FINALLY condemened it.
I don‚Äôt like Trump either, but can we please stop propping up ‚ÄúCommentary‚Äù and ‚ÄúOpinion‚Äù as News?.?! Your job should be to report and interview people. Your bought off views are why people have no faith in politicians or media.
Thanks Obama!  Trump and the GOP failed to destroy all of his achievements so now they're trying to take credit for one of them.  They blame him for all of their failures but it's still not enough!  Now watch this video and laugh at their stupidity.
High ho ,the gangs all here !!! Commandant Heir Trump's***** good people****
Even this morons wife ,Kim Kardashian,said that Kanye is mentally Disturbed. sadly,Trump is throwing money at him,and using him  to cause Biden to lose votes ..someone in this family needs to step in and get  him some much needed help,and stop him from making him a bigger fool
But that would mean that Trump couldn‚Äôt run his businesses. Or have a place to hide when shit is hitting the fan.
You want to talk facts? Democrats called his China travel ban "xenophobic" and fearmongering, including Biden. They were against it. Only Trump was trying to do the right thing. Democrats are the failures, along with many governors.
Blah blah blah I hated Trump 3 years ago. Voted for Obama twice. Also had an awful experience with bad cops. My story in that regard was quite devastating, fyi. But the reason why I'm not on board the anti-Trump bandwagon or the anti-police bandwagon is because I think for myself
Don't let this keep happening because of the Commandant ,heir Trump. We have already had one Holocaust.never again?!? Is again Don't vote for this ignorant, ignoramus.please  Vote for Biden ,he loves America,has empathy.and will make this country great ,once again
That‚Äôs because he inherited it from Obama. Trump doesn‚Äôt know what the hell he‚Äôs doing, he had nothing to do with it. You need to retire or resign your hands are dirty.
We have tested more than anyone in the USA and we're doing far better than the UK and many European nations. If you blame it all on Trump, you're an idiot.
There is no way Biden can get away without debating Trump!  I see what is going on because I have clarity and truth within me.  Thank you Tucker... Thank you for reporting the Truth with sardonic wit sprinkled in!

Trump called Paradise, CA "Pleasure" repeatedly.  GTFOH
I'm not like anyone At least that's what it seems like and what the media wants people to think for some reason I'm not stupid enough to go back to the blank label leaving the mainstream media just because Trump purposely calls it fake news to try and get people to believe it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Freaking Russia? I think multiple instances of the mainstream media meddling &amp; putting someone's name above someone else who has more points definitely trump's a couple of pages from a coloring book &amp; the words "sources say" Not to mention the Zionists OUT MEDDLING the mediaüòíü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I thought the Nixon years were pretty dark.  But that‚Äôs nothing compared to the situation Trump has pushed this country into.  We‚Äôre probably in the worst shape we‚Äôve been in over 150 years.
But they are an organization created to prevent Trump from being re-elected. They may have some former republicans but their gameplan isn't converting people like WalkAway does by the hundreds of thousands so far.

rofl why would china want biden trump is a dumbass
Looks what it's done for trump
It amazes me that people can know something's wrong with Trump but haven't thought to google "Trump psychology".  The APA and MSM helped muzzle them but I really think most of us have *chosen* to ignore expert warnings.
No it actually wasn't. Trump hyperinflated the market prior to Covid, which meant it would crash at any point. Not would, but could. The economists have been saying this for years.
You've yet to prove a single thing. You continue to avoid addressing my points such as how democrats haven't condemned anything and how Biden has harmed black Americans tremendously and Trump's legacy of actually benefitting them.
The estimate was we'd have over 2 million dead by now if we did nothing. That means we've done a hell of a lot. You are not appreciative and you will never acknowledge the good that Trump has done. That's sad.
The CDC director agrees with Trump. And no, he's been handing out PPE like crazy and made sure no one needs to worry about affording care for the virus at the hospital. Even many blue state Govs have thanked him. He saves lives! You sound like you need to do much more research.
What do you mean livable wages? Tax cuts help with that and Trump will make more.
Neither do Democrats! Neither does the WHO! Neither does China! There's blame shared by many people and organizations and nobody is taking responsibility! Are you so blind that you think it's all Trump's fault????
Job recovery is going well during the pandemic because Trump knows how to create jobs. He's always been a jobs-focused president. Biden worked with NAFTA and sold our jobs overseas. Biden doesn't know how to create jobs. Never has. If he is elected, our economy isn't coming back.
This is outrageous. DeSantis needs to pull his head head out of Trump‚Äôs ass and listen to the medical experts. He is already responsible for a spike in the number of Trump virus patients and deaths. He will be responsible for even more.
Remember when Americans decided who the president would be?
And you don't know the facts. Democrats didn't urge Trump to take any action. In fact, Democrats, including Joe Biden, called his China travel ban "xenophobic" and fearmongering. This shows that a response from a Democrat president would've been more delayed. They hope you forget
So to clarify:  was talking about Kanye but I'm going to leave this here anyway because I think it's important to understand.  It depends on your definition of mental illness. Many of Trump's cult share one or more of his mental defects, if you prefer this term.
I don't know much about Kanye but I do know from what I've learned that malignant narcissists like Trump attract like-minded people. Every single member of #Cult45 shares one or more of Trump's mental defects.
You think Trump will have a landslide loss?? That's cute and wildly ignorant. You believe polls off-hand. That's so simple-minded of you. #WalkAway  campaign is incredibly successful, far more so than RVAT. Can't wait to talk to you in 3 months
MAYBE widely available several months into 2021...
What I‚Äôve known for some time is that there are 2 separately incorporated cities named ‚ÄòKansas City‚Äô - one in KS &amp; 1 in MO. My late cousin was an AP sports writer there. Trump was referring to the wrong one in KS, not MO, Home of the KC Chiefs.
Not trump
I've been saying this just about every day for months:  Trump and all of his enablers who publicly denied and downplayed #COVID19 killed Americans. They should be tried at the Hague.  #GOPGenocide #ItIsWhatItIs
At Bill Clintons funeral he will be compared to Trump, the other sex abuse president.
Trump: the Alfred E. Neuman president. ‚ÄúWhat, me worry?‚Äù #MAGA
But remember for privileged leftists re-electing trump might be ok but for those on margins it‚Äôs a huge difference with real consequences. Note Chomsky backs Biden.
Why do you give Trump a platform for this garbage?
One of my favorite Trump gems of all time. From the Trump Organization websites, under "inspirational quotes" From DjT himself, this pearl of wisdom. ü§´. Ahem "You're Going to have to Think Anyway, So Why Not Think"  Well, there you go.
Danger lurking. Republicans will move away from trump but to someone equally as destructive but more palatable to Americans. Beware! And beware of Lincoln Project and their ultimate goals.
We are nowhere near 2 million 6 months after the pandemic hit. I'd say that means we did more than bare minimum. Even Cuomo and some other blue state Govs thanked Trump.
Just FYI, you're most likely arguing with a Qbot here. There are several million following Trump's account. They still get me too sometimes.
I think one of the most damaging, long-term consequences of the Trump presidency is the erosion of trust in public institutions.
The Trump Administration pledge: ‚ÄúWhen you're cornered &amp; in doubt, run in circles, scream &amp; shout. Feign piety &amp; wave the flag,  lie &amp; boast &amp; strut &amp; brag. When you're busted, be a clown: rant &amp; shriek &amp; double down, throw a tantrum like a brat; And ALWAYS blame a Democrat.‚Äù
It's all democrats have right now. All they have is "trump is racist" and "trump mishandled covid19". They have nothing else to say because they can't talk about their own candidate since he is an unworthy, bumbling, mumbling, bland, senile puppet.
I know, it's disturbing. Cuomo is a murderer. But even he had to thank Trump for his assistance
That article is bullshit fearmongering in order to paint Trump as incompetent. Their bias is clearly written.  They referenced Johns Hopkins but that site shows ~70 per 100k death rate for the UK and ~49 per 100k death rate for the USA.
Yes, we're currently in a recession. You're jumping from point to point and not connecting any dots. Your arguments are as incoherent as a speech from Trump or Biden.
TVA reverses outsourcing decision on information technology jobs after Trump's executive order
Trump made it so everyone can be treated for the virus without fear of not being able to afford it. Trump cannot initiate a mask mandate. That's on the states. The WHO told us for a long time there's no evidence of human to human transmission. Our numbers could've been higher
FUCK Dü§Ænald Trump!! #OrangeusDumbasseous
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ That's funny..... Trump saying someone else is not worthy because of 'race rhetoric'.
Sadly for now, far too many in the GOP work for and profit from Putin. Maybe when tRump is put in prison in 2021, patriotic Americans will be encouraged to hunt down these parasite magats for free.
Can Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúpeople‚Äù be any worse than this? Tone deaf monsters! Insensitive asses.
Your first comment above didn't reflect reality unless speaking about unemployment after the virus- in which case, Trump is far from the sole perpetrator. The economy before the virus was fantastic regardless of your article. At least he didn't sell our jobs overseas like Obama
Its like Trump listened to John Lennon's "Imagine" and thought. I could blame that on Joe Biden. Smhü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
What‚Äôs the Trump lawyers‚Äô next delay tactic?
You mean after the virus hit? Because before that, the economy was fantastic. Are you naive enough to think that Trump is solely to blame for that, or do you understand the reality of the situation?
Just by virtue of his long tenure? Well, Congressmen and women tend to stay in their groups. So if Biden does, it's very little. But my point is that Trump has shown to be a very jobs-focused president. And we need that more than ever.
Have your Trump family denied rental to black and Hispanic lately??? Or treated them less as your worker with less pay or better opportunities at all you businesses to this day .  You and your family are the biggest example of why there is such racism in America.
trump is hilarious
You mean #ChinaVirus   At least job recovery is going well. Biden knows nothing of job creation. He sold our jobs overseas. Oh, and there's no reason to believe this is all Trump's fault. Even democrats share some blame, but they won't own up to it.
And you want to elect Biden who sold our jobs overseas and knows nothing of economics, job creation, or business? At least Trump has aided job recovery.
I'll admit when he says something wrong. I mentioned he's not articulate. But you are digustingly misrepresenting his comment. And you know it. Trump does lie but people lie about him even more.
So you know what he meant. He was not talking about all Mexican immigrants. Trump is not very articulate so that's what the media uses against him. Since you know what he meant stop pretending he meant something else
There is no excuse for Trump, hold powerful people accountable
He's got a lot on his plate. Obama didn't want to change medicaid and drug prices while people are dying who cannot afford their medication. Trump lowered those prices and big pharma hates him now.
Trump didn't bring up race with that low housing comment. You guys did. It had nothing to do with race so don't put that on him. The fact that you assumed only minorities live in low housing areas and they don't live in wealthy neighborhoods, is racist.
Are you serious? That's NOT what he said. Trump said that SOME SOME SOME SOME SOME not all but SOME immigrants are rapists and killers. He even said some are good people. Research it yourself instead of believing the bullshit people tell you. People lie about Trump all the time.
You feel emboldened because there are countless fake news sources against Trump because that's what gets their clicks and ratings. You're terrible at cutting through the BS, I've noticed.
You need to get better news sources. Trump was mentioning that SOME illegal immigrants are criminals. He condemned white supremacy so he wasn't praising them. Oh, and Biden just made a new racist comment yesterday morning! He's still his racist old self.
Your "facts" are just linking articles which are loosely relevant but don't really help your argument much. You knew nothing about Trump's accomplishments or Biden's history or much of what we've discussed
Thank you, Walter, for stepping forward with your thoughts and not being afraid to say voting tRump in 2016 was a mistake. He conned many people. I'm glad you saw the light now.
Can I just clarify that it isn't the entire PNW. The farther you get from Seattle, the more Trump signs you see. It is just the urban pockets that are primarily crazy. Too many colleges in one space maybe?
TikTok? Seriously? Focus on Covid-19, motherfucker!  The order, starting in 45 days time, would ban any U.S. transaction with TikTok-owner ByteDance.  via
This lawsuit that Ms. James has brought against the NRA makes big business in the USA look like a boy‚Äôs club. Big business just ignores the law. The corruption and rot begins at the head. If you want something, do trump a favor.
Sometimes those groups overlap... such as when he (or Obama, or Trump) deported people who were seeking asylum from likely death.
Trump inherited a good economy but set it on an even steeper incline. Job recovery is going better than expected even under the pandemic. Biden promoted NAFTA which lost America many, many jobs to other nations. If Biden wins, we're not making a full recovery as a nation.
I know! What's up with the generalizations from anti-Trumpers? If you are voting Trump, therefore you must be racist, sexist, xenophobic, Muslim-hating, and uneducated. It also doesn't mean we excuse everything he's ever done and said. These people mischaracterize us constantly.
Hey, DNC: This?‚¨áÔ∏è  You gave us this, openly rigging the primary. You knew Bernie could spank Trump like an unruly child, but that would've wrecked your gravy train.  Your billionaire bosses prefer Trump to Bernie, so you gave us this clusterfüà≤k.  Go to hell and take it with you.

Hooray for Justice! Finally, a brave judge alows a brave woman to proceed with serious investigations of a cowardly  May the truth prevail, and also have a major impact...
There's no hard evidence Trump did that BECAUSE they are black. Biden, however, worked to keep schools segregated, voted against civil rights measures, authored bills to arrest mass black populations and increase police power, militarized police, etc. You are voting for Biden?!?!
Alright you are too intellectually dishonest to speak to. You didn't know about Trump's prison reform, lowest ever black unemployment, economic opportunity zones for minorities, sickle cell research, funding of historically black colleges&amp;universities, etc. Stop being ignorant!
You should have seen the ballot for Governor in Washington state. It had people running as: Republican Trump Republican Pre2016 Republican.  This was on the ballot!
So now you acknowledge you were wrong and ignorant about Trump's work for minorities? Yes, Trump was sued for that. The people who sued him lost the case. Biden openly tells people "you ain't black' and just this morning he said black people all think alike and aren't diverse!
Why on earth do you think Biden changed? Don't be a fool. Trump wants to implement more of what? Trump implemented PRISON REFORM which benefitted thousands of black inmates and created economic opportunity zones for minority people and much more. Please do your research.
why are the same way you did Mr. Trump! When you voted early-we and the people followed suit
You are DEAD WRONG! Biden devastated black Americans with his 1994 crime bill and working to keep schools segregated. Trump created economic opportunity zones and prison reforms for minority people, supported black colleges &amp; universities and much more. Do your research!
Biden is racist as hell. Call Trump racist but Biden is overtly so with comments like these and "you ain't black".
You will excuse Biden's racist words and behavior but not Trump's? At least Trump didn't work tirelessly to keep schools segregated...
Nice deflection, but Trump isn't the one who worked tirelessly to keep schools segregated.
Michelle would galvanize the Party and trump would be wiped out and Dems down ballot would romp too.
I just saw that trump has banned payments to Tencent and stuff and I think that‚Äôs stupid because it‚Äôs literally quarantine, people are relying on video games to stay sane and keep a job and you‚Äôre gonna make it so half of the game companies can‚Äôt do anything like wtf that‚Äôs dumb!

We already have evidence that #COVID19 is killing more  elderly minorities people with preexisting conditions the poor  And that Trump and Kushner intended to harm/kill more people in blue states by withholding PPE.  They should be tried at the Hague.  #GOPGenocide #ItIsWhatItIs
Biden doesn't life by it. At all.  Neither does Trump.
Trump's inability to say what he wants to accomplish in a second term is a warning: "Having promised the American people nothing, Trump would therefore be accountable for nothing‚Ä¶it‚Äôs usually Presidents in pretend democracies who get away with this‚Ä¶"
Trump is such a fool. He can't go soon enough. All this crap is distraction from COVID of course. 1200 deaths today alone.
Trump and Republicans have blood all over their greasy hands.

I care more about actions and Trump, as I've described before, has done a great deal for black Americans whereas Biden has only hurt them while in office. Trump may be racist. It's possible. But Biden is overtly so.
The Marxists would love it but Mr. Trump would never allow himself to be humiliated like this.
What‚Äôs really sad about you Mr. Trump is that you don‚Äôt realize that America is already great-now granted you‚Äôve dented it a few times here -once Jo is in place it will be back to that for greatness again

Gotta be one of Trump's "good people"
Time for the DOJ to step in. That‚Äôs interfering with an election.
Trump supporters,seriously want to know,how you can still support Trump.hes taking away your healthcare ,your ability to work bc of covid19.. He has not done one good thing for America.160'000 deaths bc he didn't bother to care in October of last year he knew about it back thenüëá
Trump trying to slow down the post office is just one more offense  he will be tried for in his trial   He will go to prison ,along with the ole Republicants   who won't do a thing to stop his reign of terror on America
He obviously doesn't need to. He's just standing back and we're all watching tRump, in all his mania, slit his own political throat. LOL!
You are so right I just don't get it..they know Trump has destroyed America,and they do nothing.  .I'm just so angry
Not ‚Äúblaming every tragedy on Trump‚Äù but absolutely am on this one: 162,000 now dead. Over 1,000 dead per day for last 11 days in a row. This is insane!
I'm not "sleeping" with a trump supporter ever. If I were single, I'd avoid them all. ALL women should refuse.
Trump also massively funded historically black colleges and universities, created economic opportunity zones in minority communities, increased sickle cell anemia research, pardoned some black people, and black unemployment was lowest ever before the virus.
What a revealing question into the cultlike ideology of anti-Trump people. It's because we DON'T support racist policies. Trump has done plenty to help minorities if you'd like me to get into it. You and your ilk mischaracterize us constantly, and it is insulting.
Honey, you continue to show how brainwashed anti-Trumpers are. You've been debunked thoroughly already so I don't feel the need to do it again. You are injecting your own spin on Trump's comments. For instance, he never mentioned race. If you want to see a racist, look at Joe.
he can take laps around trump and you know it.   You just hate that your candidate is  1- a thief.  2- a liar.  3- a mental disaster.  4- has had at LEAST 3 TIAs  5- can't even pronounce our national parks  6- has been personally responsible for the deaths of 160k AMERICANS
cognitive tests are only given to people who are having mental decline.....  like trump. Its not something that you brag about.
Biden's ad neglects to explain HOW he would do a better job handling the virus. He and other democrats called Trump's China ban "xenophobic", implying their response would have been more delayed.
Trump is a kid who didn't do the homework lying that they did
In a way, North prefigured Trump‚Äîif you do the crimes right out in the open, unapologetically, you can get away with them. I'm referring to his brash statement, something like "You're damn right I lied to Congress, and by God, I'd do it again!" Am I misremembering? #MAGA
Yes #TrumpKillsSeniors  But let's not forget that Trump is also killing these groups:  minorities people with pre-existing health conditions people in blue states  #TrumpGenocide
So, nothing about what Trump said?
Aww, I think it is ‚Äúcute‚Äù Trump thinks he has a shot at winning the election. Hahaha! Not a chance!
The media will give him all the passes necessary until November 3. But they'll give Trump no passes and even distort what he says.
You sound as though you have zero evidence for all the children being abused under Trump. Maybe you should keep your worthless opinions to yourself.
Trump has been going up in the polls and in approval rating as of late. And Biden needs many good advisers because he has no ability to lead without them pulling all the strings.
Vote for Trump the biggest POS alive!  What he doesn't insult you with his pandering to black voters. Wow.

The tweet started with ‚ÄúUS President Trump says‚Äù so we knew it was a lie right off the bat.
If there is a God, Trump will be watching Biden as POTUS from a prison cell.  Narcissists are always the victims in their own eyes.
Trump just says things and throws ‚Äústuff‚Äù out there to see what will stick or what he can make people believe. Biden wants to hurt God? What?
You're ignorant. There's no way 2/3s of eligible voters go to Trump. Just because a corrupt nonprofit gets caught taking members money for board self-dealing. The NRA isn't the same as the Second Amendment, and definitely isn't for gun safety. I hope a responsible org replaces it
Please don‚Äôt get tired of doing something about what Trump is doing to our country. He still is continuing to do things that Congress should get involved for. Why aren‚Äôt you? Are you sick and tired of dealing with him? It is Congress‚Äô job to fight him every step of the way.
Far from it. You've shown to be incapable of critical thinking but quick to support articles you've likely not read yourself. And you have no idea abour the majority of the facts I describe, such as Trump vs Biden's record. You're such a waste of my time, I shouldn't bother.

#COVID19 is the best thing that ever coulda happened to the  campaign. All the #Democrats/ need to do to win the #2020Election is NOTHING. Let  do all the work for them. He can‚Äôt help himself. And as long as Trump conts to to need to be the center
Didnt have anything when he was VP. Tried to gen up some BS via Ukraine and that failed. Whatever they manufacture will be weak and desparate, just like Trump.
The thing is, claiming that Biden is outflanked by Trump is a weird thing to say and not a very funny joke.  Biden can easily negate this by simply pointing to his plan.  The joke doesn't make sense.
The Washington Post reports on a massive firing of career public servants by Trump‚Äôs Postmaster General. RUNNING USPS INTO THE GROUND AHEAD OF AN ELECTION by bleeding it out over the preceding months should be setting off many many alarms. üö®üì¨üó≥
Nothing. Can‚Äôt go anywhere thanks to Trump

Ah...this is already part of the Affordable Care Actü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è...#ACA #ObamaWasBetterAtEverything Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions ‚Äî a protection which already exists under Obamacare
Trump-owned properties in the US have imported more than 8 tons of Chinese goods since September  via
Except that Biden's plan goes a lot further and your tweet is misleading about it:    You can think it doesn't go far enough, but it goes much further then Trump.
Pelosi and Schumer wouldn't have gone on record complementing Meadows (in Trump's view) unless they only really wanted the $600 unemployment payment and small biz credit and none of them the rest. Smart move!
I don't think that Trump could do any of that anymore. ANd I'm sure Melania had that remove from her contract in the recent renegotiation.
Trump is right. Its like the flu. It comes and goes but is still around.  Besides, 330 million Americans and only 5 million cases. Where's the pandemic? Not very many cases when you look at it this way. Government over reaction.
Nearly four years and I am still waiting for Trump to be ‚Äúfor‚Äù something of value and believe he is sincere.
Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions ‚Äî a protection which already exists under Obamacare
um. yea.  Trump's first 30 weeks were a long time ago. Have you checked the data on manufacturing jobs lately?
Trump is less than human.

The Department of Homeland Security is a state police agency. Trump has taken another lesson from Putin.
Like Trump isn't doing that now? Give Joe a chance to put together his administration and pass bills, then if he does what you say, then judge him.
This is a sick, sick Trump cult with a side order of Jesus on a stick. Super spreaders.
We all want healthcare. Glad to pay for it, but the prices here are much higher than other countries even though the medical care is worse :/ I didn't know trump promised it, I hope he tries to make it happen.
Biden said  it. Not Trump. Not his father. Not in the 1970s. Biden did. Just this week.
Now that's American! Love it - protect your IP. beating trump at his own game üòÇ
How is Trump simultaneously running to the left and to the right of Joe Biden?
Biden still is much better then Trump on this issue:    You can think it doesn't go far enough, but it is miles above Trump.  There's no need to make outflanking takes that make you look not serious.
Well that was chaotic af. The people were good though. The beer was delicious.  Wise man once said, "Forgiveness is divine but never pay full price for late pizza."  Black Lives Matter. Trans rights. Wear sunscreen.  See you motherfuckers on the other side.  Fuck Donald Trump.
I want to know what does Putin and Trump have on them?
Gee, it's not like there was a major, ongoing racist backlash to Obama, and a major emboldening of violent racist groups since both Ferguson and Trump's election.  Those couldn't influence those figures at all I'm sure!
Or more likely, Trump ordered the state of Ohio to beat and arrest anyone that told the truth about their ruler having that virus garbage so the entire state had to lie.  That is the Trump cult.

2024. Trump and Kanye are 2 sides of the same coin as far as vision. But trump needs the next 4 years to finish getting rid of the swamp creatures. That way in 2024 Kanye doesn‚Äôt have to worry about the evil ones sabotaging him how Trump did.
A halt to student loan payments was also proposed by many Democrats in Congress.  It's okay to think Biden doesn't go for enough, but please don't try to insist that Trump is outflanking Biden, even as a joke.  It makes you look not serious.
What country does der Trump live in?
Trump won't win. He won't win even with all your GOP cheating; people are not wanting Trump. Cut bait and cleanse yourself of Trump's evil workings.
What happened to trump‚Äôs health care plan he was going  to announce in two weeks? That was  just another trump lie! Trump is just making shit up, he never plans anything but whatever helps himself!
They're trying to throw a wrench into the post office but it was the government that fucked it up 15 years ago. Don't believe this Trump stooge
2024, let Trump finish the job in draining the swamp and then in 2024 Kanye won‚Äôt have to deal with those evil forces.
ATTENTION ALL VETERANS: I HOPE YOU'RE WITH ME THAT YOU WILL NOT BE VOTING FOR THAT TRAITOR DONALD TRUMP IN NOVEMBER. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR KNOWING BOUNTIES WERE PLACE ON OUR SOLDIERS &amp; THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF KNEW IT, ONLY TO DENY NOT KNOWING.
You should, and the GOP should be looking into why Russia is putting bounties on our Troops, not trying to help Russia get Trump back in the office, shame on you!
We already have coverage for pre-existing conditions, it's called The ACA. What the heck are you talking about? Trump is claiming credit for something Obama did but I guess he's always been jealous of Barack Obama since he will be remembered as a great President unlike Trump.
People keep assuring us foolish minions that Trump can't make the leap to fascism but it is happening.  The USPS. Claims of rigged election. Voter supression. GOP running Putin's playbook. Fed thugs in Dem cities...
If you spent all of April and May talking about how Joe Biden is a rapist and then defend predators on the left OR defend Donald Trump If you spent all of October 2016 talking about ‚Äúgrab em by the p***y‚Äù and then defend Joe Biden Do you believe in anything?
Trump is a disgrace
Well this was quite pedantic. I understand that nuance may be lost on some but the fact is NASA did gain a large influx of money under the Trump administration while the previous administration only gave nebulous goals after severely mishandling the Constellation Project.
Seven-year-old Georgia boy dies of coronavirus, a day after Trump's claim that kids are 'almost immune'

I‚Äôm in the people‚Äôs republic of Seattle... no one has a Trump sign up because they don‚Äôt want their house burned down.
Biden supports student loan forgiveness for most people (everyone making under $125,000), through, so Biden has an even better plan then Trump who is merely delaying loan collection.  You can argue it's not going far enough, but it's still miles above Trump.
"Fake news" is real news that Trump doesn't like.

We‚Äôre getting 4 more of Trump because the left can‚Äôt bring themselves to unequivocally disavow these people.  These people right here get the protection of prestige media in the west.    Unbelievable.

Eminent domain, an essential tool in development of public infrastructure.  Pres Trump's big beautiful wall would have been impossible without it.

They pretend they never knew Trump and it was all a dream
You‚Äôre really banking on your followers to be dumb as stumps so they believe this is something Trump did instead of the reality that Obama signed it into law with the ACA.  How pitiful
AMLO and the Mexican government are fairly content with President Trump. The new USMCA deal is beneficial for Mexican industry, agribiz and workers.  Canada not so much, a lot of personal animosity on the part of PM Trudeau.

It's a pretty funny self-own watching Trump cult celebrated the amazing feat of leadership Obama accomplished by passing the ACA, while Trump has passed NOTHING and never even presented his BS magical healthcare plan THAT NEVER EXISTED!
The more I learn of what is going on in the USPS, the more it seems unlikely that Trump can be dislodged from office. This election will almost certainly be decided in the courts or in the House.

Protecting the country is Trump's job. He fucked up and 160,000 people are dead because of it. That's 40,000 Benghazi's. Spare me your unAmerican bullshit and own it. You fucked over your country and you're obviously willing to fuck it over again just to elect a racist. GTFO
you're trolling yourself at this point. Trump said it wrong then corrected himself. It was something we all made fun of but it's really not a big deal. Please chill

I've never been this angry in my 73 years. Foul monster trump is in court right damn now trying to end Obamacare's pre-existing condition protection &amp; he says this shite! Please, Americans, vote like your lives depend on it because they do.
Er NOPE  ACA is why insurance companies cannot deny pre-existing conditions  Trump has had 3 1/2 years to create his own health plan = NOTHING  His administration is in the midst of filing with the Supreme Court that the ACA is illegal thus removing pre-existing clauses  #Deluded
Fact: Obama and Biden built the longest economic expansion in American history. Trump turned it into the worst economy in American history in just three years.   It's not my fault you support the worst president in American history. Do better.
Because Trump cares about that kind of thing...
Protests didn't put 55M Americans out of work and kill 160,000 of them. Trump did.
With this combined with the obviously bullshit order to extend the unemployment benefits, it's clear Trump's strategy is to just pretend govern. I wouldn't put it past America to buy this crap.
Questions for the people actually voting for Joe Biden:  Would you let Biden babysit your daughter or granddaughter?  Would you let Biden drive a new car you own in the city?  Would you let Biden have the codes for the nukes? (Trump already has these and we aren't dead.)
Oh, for God‚Äôs sake. Trump is a Russia stooge. Breaking off ‚Äúdiplomatic relations‚Äù would be meaningless. Are you not paying attention  ?
There are no jobs to go back to. And governors closed because trump said that they should be the ones to make the calls therefore endorsing their decisions

If ppl of other countries appreciate and see what trump has had to endure and what he‚Äôs done for America, that means something. Lots of ppl wished they had a president like DT. Sad that American citizens don‚Äôt recognize it.
This doesn‚Äôt seem like a definitive date of November. But I do think based on China‚Äôs lack of action and Israeli action in mid January the United States #Trump knew and did nothing until mid March. Still atrocious as it is.

I swear, if he bungles this election and we get another 4 years of Trump, I don't know what I'm going to do. I can't take 4 more years of this! I'd be lucky to even live through it at this rate.

Trump acts like he controlled this. He has little to no influence on labor relations. Trump is the last person who should he touting about saving high paying jobs, when he is notorious for hiring cheap labor and not paying them.
Oh yeah some people say Putin has Trump's face set up as a dart board in his office.
If you were or are president we can plan on this being the usual.  Also,  how can you blame Trump for this? You haven't really left your basement and you would expect all Americans to do the same,  so it would be worse under you.
I'm sure they're not, but I hope "democratic leadership" notices how Republicans are trying to paint Joe freaking Biden as the next Che Guevara.    You could run Mitt Romney against Trump and they'd call him a Marxist. It's no reason to not back actual progressives.

BTW, bringing up Clinton and Obama to justify Trump gets pathetically old real quick.  Since you love Trump so completely,  absolutely nothing   If you cared...,( which I think you dont.)..Just type in Trump guilty on Google.and pick one.
Remember that time when Trump quoted a philosopher to make a point? No?
It's on Trump!
trump worrying about tiktok when he should be worrying about other important things
So fucking desperate he accuses a catholic of hating God!  That‚Äôs a stretch!  #TrumpleThinSkin #TrumpTheDisaster So here is where a serious Republican should correct tRump, like McCain corrected the woman at his rally dissing President Obama.  Let‚Äôs see...
NO AIR BREATHING HUMAN BEING IS UNDECIDED! If you are your a liar and a (R) in denial! Quit acting like these ads would sway ANYONE to change their vote! Desperation is and always has been a (R) thing! #TheyCheatLikeTheyBreath NO Self respecting citizens is voting for tRump!
We‚Äôve had more than enough of the abomination that is tRump!
Eight years of steady leadership and sensible regulation did more for prosperity than Bush's deregulation or whatever the fuck Trump's plan to the extent that he has one is.  This is why I vote for centrist mainstream Democrats like Biden, Obama, and Clinton.
And the kinds of Americans who have traded citizenship, community, and austerity for the moral decay of celebrity worship and me-first thinking see him as their avatar and love him for it.  Trump is not the problem. The people who voted for him are the problem.
It's what we learned about every time Trump has been in the news for the last 40 years.  Anyone who acts surprised at this hasn't been paying attention, and Trump's popularity has always been the most glaring symptom of America's moral and societal decay.
Trump says Thighland? What happens when he sees Niger on the teleprompter #TrumpIsNotWell oh well Phuket anyway! üòâüòÇ
tRump is a disgusting #RacistInChief it trends every other day for a reason.. Obama was racist üòÇüòÇ gotdamn that‚Äôs fresh #ExacpeTheCult #StopInjectingBleach
Anyone wanna come over for a cheeky sesh when trump dies x
As a person of faith (Protestant) I am deeply troubled that so many Christians ( some are friends) follow and support Trump. What he has said and done show no "fruits of the Spirit." Brainwashed and deceived are they.
Do you truly believe this Trump ? you are going to be so sorry when you lose and wonder where God was ,he was with the other side you dolt
Also can we just point out that Trump then said TIE-land immediately after. So he doesn‚Äôt even pronounce it Thigh-land. He‚Äôs just a dummy and didn‚Äôt connect the word he saw with the Country so he said it as it was spelt then realised it was a Country. Just dumb and unqualified.
Don‚Äôt presume that a Biden victory is a sure thing. If history is anything to go by, Trump could quit, cheat, delay, contest the result - or surprise everyone and win again.   #Biden #Biden2020 #Trump #Trump2020 #JoeBiden #DonaldTrump
Hi English person here, never said or heard Thighland in my life before Trump. My boss is English but was born in Thailand and grew up there says TIE-land as well. Do you say you‚Äôd like to go out for some thigh food? This is insane
Just as in the US it has to be ABT (anyone but Trump), so in the UK it has to be ABJ. I wouldn‚Äôt say that about any previous Tory leader, all of whom had at least a degree of competence and of wanting the best (as he or she saw it) for the country.
This whole TicTock issue is really messing with me; I‚Äôm either supporting a PRChinese against Trump or agreeing with Trump against TicTock!
Why is it now cool for *Republicans* to start trade wars? Oh yeah, there is no GOP, there is only Trump. And his tiny, tiny hands.
Mercy and comfort were never intended for Covid patients... there was no need for that.  All Trump did was public displays of bandaids that never contained the outbreak.   It should have been contained early and instead of downplayed for 2 months .
So obvious that the dems are exactly doing that. We're fighting back. Trump has done so much. He's bringing them to light and boy, are they mad!
Do you think Trump gets plasma infusions? Because that is a seriously creepy Elizabeth Barthory vibe
Are you trying to rename countries in a bizarre attempt to convince people that trump is not suffering from some form of debilitating illness?
If you think Trump is even remotely associated with God,  you clearly don't know God.  I'm sure he was reaching new Godly heights when he was cheating on his pregnant wife with porn stars..
Gunner... You clearly have no idea WTF you are talking about. Your boy screwed this up so bad, yet you are still trying to blame Democrats for his f#ckups! I don't think this virus response could have gone any worse than it has under Trump and this crime administration. Fail!
Fake News. Trump has been crying for almost 4 years now about this. Anyways, Look at our country under Trump!! Trump has royally destroyed this country. Trump has got to go!
Johnson is our Trump. I expect him to behave more and more like the orange man-child.  Thanks Tory voters......good job. üôÑ  Boris Johnson‚Äôs audacity during this crisis continues to amaze

At least Trump is in control of his facalties, but you liberals will support this idiot with a horrible track record and can‚Äôt come out of his basement long enough to have a unscripted conversation because look how dumb he sounds with a script l!! What a sad time this is!
Ha Ha Ha...... Biden can't represent himself and your pointing fingers at Kanya.  That's not going to fly. But fly with Trumps Landslide victory in November.             VOTE   TRUMP                  2020 - 2024            BE  A  WINNER DON'T  BE  LEFT  BEHIND
Tell me what policy or what President Trump has done to make him a racist? And be sure to list facts! I am Hispanic and I DONT find him racist at all! My son is a Dreamer and we trusjt jhim to work for us, he is an amazing businessman! ##liberalismisacult
Load of Right Wing Trump fans.
Facebook surveils us so advertisers can target us ‚Äî and Trump is exploiting their business model to push lies about voting. Congress and FTC need to investigate #Facebook.
If a president is a ‚Äúmaster,‚Äù then what‚Äôs trump?
Maybe one question can be about how our current situation  is similar to what from the Bible... Trump will babble himself into a coma.
And to say a devout Catholic doesn't know the Bible nor anything about God.  Who the F--- does Trump think he is??
Could you not simp for Trump for ONE. FUCKING. DAY?
You deserve to be president, simply because you‚Äôre for the people, not your election! Hell, anyone would be a better president! I Hope, you‚Äôre going to do better than Trump ! Survival of our country!
Do I love this country? You bet I do! Which is why I am voting for Biden! Trump is literally destroying this country.
RETWEET if you agree Trump doesn't even know how to find a biblical verse ..
Wow... talk about a monopoly... really America?.. bullshit.
And what exactly has Trump done to improve the lives, wealth gap, education, and opportunities for blacks?
Imagine not going after the Trump family+the" in yur face" corruption +out+out thievery from American Taxpayers! Shutting down the Trump foundation is just the beginning!!
When Biden is elected, he will challenge God to 12 rounds of bare knuckles boxing.  Place your bets folks!  The smart money is on Biden according to Trump.
I just sit here a wonder how much money Donald Trump has made since he took office ? Anyone have an idea ? What‚Äôs your best guess ?
No democrats do not want to do away with it. The current leadership wants to use your money for things that are illegal. Do you read? Trump doesn't
Trump also said he wouldn‚Äôt mind sleeping with Ivanka if she wasn‚Äôt he‚Äôs daughter. I don‚Äôt think Christians talk this way, so much for Christianity
The grease stains and orange makeup all over the interiors of the presidential fleet has to be unreal. We will have to literally mothball the fleet, and buy new ones. The fish smell is a combination of Melania and Trump. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Look across the pond,  Trump still has a following ü•¥
Na, he has an 80 seat majority &amp; has completed corrupted the UK. This is an inferior but non the less dangerous,  Trump America.
So Trump then?
New Fleet to aid in HIDEN BIDENs CAMPAIGN.  Prime trucks will be rolling to harvest illegal votes soon. Keep these TRUCKS PARKED. VOTE  TRUMP   2020 - 2024
As far as I can tell, Trump killed  one of the very few prominent Blacks in the party so there's that.
‚ÄúThailand‚Äù! Trump‚Äôs response: Do they wear Bow, Ascot or Neckties there?
Who made  a fucking scientist? Can you believe this guy is the president with the bullshit that spews from his mouth! Imagine all the good he could do and all he says is shit . #trump
As election day approaches Democrats need to prepare prosecution for Trump and his enabler‚Äòs think Nuremberg trials
Let Trump use his sharpie to cross out the Dem names and scribble GOP on it. That's a out how petty these idiots are.
Most 5 year olds could effectively out-debate trump.
#nuremberg trump associates and enablers
Did Trump invent this?
I guess that means you were always voting for Trump and have found your justification. Congrats, I guess?... at this point, the only way a VP pick should matter now is if Biden picked Trump or any of his enablers for VP...
I try to always check. Among all the other things Trump has killed, comedy has been a victim as well üòÇ

you expect me to take Trump seriously when I grew up watching him on WWE??
In 2016 I voted for Hillary. I did not like her as a candidate. I had no idea who Tim Kaine was nor did I care.  What I did see coming was the shitshow (which we have now) that would happen if Trump was elected.
Could he at least give Trump a high-five before leaving?
Voting for a third person is a vote for trump. Please, dont do that.
Serious question. Why do so many trump supporters have the same "up close face selfie with sunglasses on" facebook profile picture. It happens too often to just be coincidence
I wonder how long it takes for Trump to coat himself with tangerine juice?
You should be glad of it. Trump can't give an interview without falling in the shit

Trump
Trust Trump has THEE PLAN. Now its just paper monopoly money.  Has been for centuries. Spend it all ! Bleed the puppet masters. Wipe out the banking oligarchs   and go back to gold standard. A NEW DAY A NEW WAY A NEW COUNTRY A NEW WORLD A NEW FUTURE GODS DESIRE IS TO PROSPER YOU
Biden should call Trump and tell him if he drops out of the race, he might consider a pardon! Then when it hits the fan, Biden tells Trump "April Fool's!" Or "Fake News!" üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Anyone want to bet the prosecutor and Investigators got warnings? Trump runs like a wannabe mafia. Sends his cronies to scare people from testifying. I'm pretty sure Epstein was a Trump hit.
I am sure some of Trump's cronies are trying to intimidate the prosecutor right now. I sure hope the NY Prosecutor is being guarded big time.
These pigs don't hyperventilate. They expect and think their lawyers will protect them. But!! You can tell when desperation kicks in. And the crime family is showing pure desperation.   I would say the Trump crime family is a bunch of sweating pigs right now.
Ranger Lora!! I would happily have flowers sent to you during a meeting with a quick note on the outcome of the announcement!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ   Or we can go with flowers as a sign? Roses mean Trump is going to jail! üòÇüòÇüòÇ  Or a pizza? Yeah! Pepperoni means jail?
We will be drawing the Swamp in November...bush bye Trump!
I bet Thune feels great he sacrificed any remaining principles for Trump then #ETTD
Don't believe Trump or GOP.  They constantly lie!
One problem with this analysis: Only about 30 percent of registered WA voters voted in primary, vs. the 78 percent who are likely to vote in the general (based on 2016 numbers). Trump will drive turnout big time from indie, #WalkAway dems, &amp; casual/ first time voter support.
NY probably has enough evidence to justify trump‚Äôs tax records. One way or another trump‚Äôs screwed. Barr  can only protect trump so much, Barr could face possible charges himself. How long can republicans support him? The worm is turning. Vote
Trump's gonna lose, and you know it. Just look at our country! It's f#cked big time with Trump at the helm. Let's just say the virus didn't happen.... We are still so f#cked. Trump's done.... He is finished.
What kind of president ignores a virus and gets 160,000 Americans killed in less than 4 months? Trump has literally Bankrupted this nation. And the division he has created is the worst it's ever been. You actually think Trump is doing a good job? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
No one cares about Trump any more. They waited too long to abandon him tho.
If you really wanted to win the presidency, shouldn't your goal be to beat Biden AND trump?  Do you believe trump is helping you run so you can be president, or are you allowing yourself to be used and made a fool of, so trump can try to win another term? You look bad either way.
Great.... Now Trump is gonna try and get them killed now? Look what Trump did to his friend Herman Cain!! Racist Trump is literally trying to kill all his "black" friends. So sad.

Trump and his crime family days are numbered.
LiA, it's going to be awesome when Trump and his crime family go down!
These Investigators are working a case that will 100% convict. They aren't playing around. Trump's desperation is so obvious too. He is scared. He actually thinks getting reelected will save him. This crime family needs to come down like Saddam Hussein's statue did!!
We all know Trump is a moron. I can guarantee they will uncover this crime family. They wouldn't be going through this unless they have enough evidence at this point. Those saying they won't find anything are in for a spoiler.
Oh trust me!!! Trump and his kids are scared, and they know their days are numbered. I cannot wait to see this crime family gone.
Guaranteed they will find what they are looking for. The Trump empire is about to come apart.
This is going to be the beginning of the end of the Trump crime family! I really look forward to seeing his empire crumble! There is no doubt they have him cornered now! FINALLY!!!
Ok I was dealing with a MAGA where someone had posted this and they were legit like, "what about all the people who recovered." You can't make this up. (Well actually you can if you assume that they would rather people die than Trump "look bad.")
It was a chemical blast the Lebanon government has confirmed it and of course anything to kiss Trumps ass oh and while you were at it how come that Putin‚Äôs Russian bounties put on our soldiers and somehow that intel didn‚Äôt reach Trump?
Trump. I had no idea that America was this racist. I don't personally know any racists, I live in a liberal area and almost always have. I genuinely thought things were getting better. I feel really stupid for ever believing that.
He‚Äôll be gone before you know it. 2 more years of Ford as premier is better than 2 more months of Trump.
No Aubrey what is the saying? Don't get in the way of a fool making a fool of himself? Something like that? Anyways.

It doesn‚Äôt matter because they will never beat President Trump. We need to think positively. We already won. Work the secret.
Always has been and I don‚Äôt think he has a desire to change. He is dishonest and has used his power to try to SO TO SPEEAK keep them in their place. The attorney for Cival Rights was on Fox and he advices blacks to vote for Trump. MLK would be right with him. I think i need name
Chinese state media casually curb stomping trump
Not true it is the China virus. Get real you don‚Äôt get to pin this onto our great President. So Pelosi &amp; Schumer you are out and rightly so. You are both narcissistic sociopaths. Long live President Trump USE YOUR POWER TO HELP THE PEOPLE. THANK YOU üôè
Yes he is &amp; more. I‚Äôm wondering if the Fox late night gal. I don‚Äôt think she is a conservative.I‚Äôve never herd her speak like Ingram about hersupport for Trump. So are you a conservative?Also the gall that SEATTLEviolent protesters want equipment to keep them safe pd by Seattle.
Pretty much.  Refuse to work with Democrats and then have Trump sign some executive orders making him a 'hero'.
tRump is an embarrassment! A clown of clowns! He is directly responsible for more than 160,000 AMERICAN DEATHS! Living breathing Americans are now dead because of the sheer incompetence of the fool and his ego stroking toadies! #RibbitRibbit #YourJustAToadie

If ppl of other countries appreciate and see what trump has had to endure and what he‚Äôs done for America, that means something. Lots of ppl wished they had a president like DT. Sad that American citizens don‚Äôt recognize it.
This doesn‚Äôt seem like a definitive date of November. But I do think based on China‚Äôs lack of action and Israeli action in mid January the United States #Trump knew and did nothing until mid March. Still atrocious as it is.

I'm sure they're not, but I hope "democratic leadership" notices how Republicans are trying to paint Joe freaking Biden as the next Che Guevara.    You could run Mitt Romney against Trump and they'd call him a Marxist. It's no reason to not back actual progressives.
Duh Trump wants to scare something timid, not going to find it
Good question! Officers are required to refuse illegal orders, so why are they silent when Trump does it?  That‚Äôs reverse patriotism, and dishonorable conduct. We hanged Nazis for following such orders
‚ÄúAs I‚Äôve said so many times before, we‚Äôre in the battle for the soul of our nation, and President Trump‚Äôs decision today to profane God and to smear my faith in a political attack is a stark reminder of what the stakes of this fight truly are.‚Äù Joe Biden

Most Brits are spoon fed the bullshit from the MSM who hate Trump and only post the negative stuff about him. None of the positive things he does are newsworthy apparently. Trump loves his country and he loves Americans and he does his best for them. I would vote for him.

Ewwww. I have no problems tossing salad but DONALD TRUMP???
Yes thanks for reminding me since that was irrelevant to the discussion at hand - but yes Trump should also resign. He and Cliff can resign together and talk about how much they both think climate change is a hoax.
Trump himself said "it is what it is." So why is it a simplistic conclusion to think this was his plan? We can't know for sure what his motives are but the facts certainly don't prove this wasn't intentional.
Should anybody point out that this describes the trump voter

I read a take they exist to gaslight us post Trump with lots of "Not all Republicans supported him! The GOP is fine, vote GOP!" I like that take.
Trump‚Äôs unloved (and cynical) proposal for a payroll tax cut, and the Fed‚Äôs path in the fixed income market are really the same thing: defunding Americans‚Äô retirement income
Trump wasn‚Äôt president for the other crises.
Something is definitely happening.  I think it's time for Trump to bunker up and stay safe, let them execute the plan.
When Trump wins in November I'm gonna break my sobriety. Just Kidding!! I already broke it.
More proof Trump and the GOP couldn‚Äôt give a damn about the American people.
Trump never has apologized and he never will.  His ego prevents him from ever thinking he is wrong about anything.

1. Be careful what you wish for.  2. Define ‚Äúradical leftists‚Äù. Is that anyone who thinks Trump is a danger to Democracy and the future of this country?
. goes to church only for photo-ops; Biden goes for religion.... so let's just laugh at #Trump 's claim Biden is going to hurt God
Trump doesn't go give.people covid.
We know Trump is a car crash of a president, yet a country with 300 plus million people can only muster up Biden as his probable replacement? Abosukte mess over there.

How dare the media report the truth!  Corrupt indeed. It is like we didn't hear Trump firsthand call the Covid Virus, not the racist China Virus, a hoax many times.
You have to keep this messages coming!  Every time Trump tweets falsehiids IMMEDIATELY have a reasoned, fact-based response.  I call it the "Biden Rapid Response Team"   hit trump HARD with facts and data, science and evidenced-based..its gonna get ugly!
Trump is going to win!
Remember that time when Trump quoted a philosopher to make a point? No?
It's on Trump!
This is good. Trump will see this and want to debate. And then Trump will self destruct in a debate against Biden.
You know the same thing went through my mind last night when my wife mentioned that tRump and Pence have gotten injected with experimental vaccine. Or at least that is the current thinking bc they don‚Äôt wear a mask ever.
I totally and completely support President Trump's decision. He is so well informed and up on things... #ObamaGate #Obamagate
trump worrying about tiktok when he should be worrying about other important things
So fucking desperate he accuses a catholic of hating God!  That‚Äôs a stretch!  #TrumpleThinSkin #TrumpTheDisaster So here is where a serious Republican should correct tRump, like McCain corrected the woman at his rally dissing President Obama.  Let‚Äôs see...
Is Trump about to drop some information that shows Big Pharma has been hiding the effectiveness of HCQ on cancer, making them liable for countless deaths?

We‚Äôve had more than enough of the abomination that is tRump!
Eight years of steady leadership and sensible regulation did more for prosperity than Bush's deregulation or whatever the fuck Trump's plan to the extent that he has one is.  This is why I vote for centrist mainstream Democrats like Biden, Obama, and Clinton.
And the kinds of Americans who have traded citizenship, community, and austerity for the moral decay of celebrity worship and me-first thinking see him as their avatar and love him for it.  Trump is not the problem. The people who voted for him are the problem.
It's what we learned about every time Trump has been in the news for the last 40 years.  Anyone who acts surprised at this hasn't been paying attention, and Trump's popularity has always been the most glaring symptom of America's moral and societal decay.

As a person of faith (Protestant) I am deeply troubled that so many Christians ( some are friends) follow and support Trump. What he has said and done show no "fruits of the Spirit." Brainwashed and deceived are they.
Do you truly believe this Trump ? you are going to be so sorry when you lose and wonder where God was ,he was with the other side you dolt
Also can we just point out that Trump then said TIE-land immediately after. So he doesn‚Äôt even pronounce it Thigh-land. He‚Äôs just a dummy and didn‚Äôt connect the word he saw with the Country so he said it as it was spelt then realised it was a Country. Just dumb and unqualified.
Don‚Äôt presume that a Biden victory is a sure thing. If history is anything to go by, Trump could quit, cheat, delay, contest the result - or surprise everyone and win again.   #Biden #Biden2020 #Trump #Trump2020 #JoeBiden #DonaldTrump
Hi English person here, never said or heard Thighland in my life before Trump. My boss is English but was born in Thailand and grew up there says TIE-land as well. Do you say you‚Äôd like to go out for some thigh food? This is insane
Trump, the people who need help due to your malfeasance &amp; moronic mismanagement of the pandemic are now UNEMPLOYED thanks to you! Payroll tax reductions ONLY helps the EMPLOYED!

Just as in the US it has to be ABT (anyone but Trump), so in the UK it has to be ABJ. I wouldn‚Äôt say that about any previous Tory leader, all of whom had at least a degree of competence and of wanting the best (as he or she saw it) for the country.

I will never vote for a Republican again.  Why? Because they failed to remove a criminal president, Herr Trump.
Your logic is terribly flawed. Either Biden or Trump win the election. You know Trump MUST go. If you don't vote for Biden you're really saying you don't care about stopping Trump. Biden MUST win or the country is lost.
Who made  a fucking scientist? Can you believe this guy is the president with the bullshit that spews from his mouth! Imagine all the good he could do and all he says is shit . #trump
There is no way to justify voting for Trump and pretending you care about other people.  Trump is the tool the GOP are using to loot the country.  Destroy both.

Trump's scheme to hobble vote-by-mail in full swing under top GOP donor-turned-postmaster general.

Have Trump and Biden met each other yet?

I feel the answer is beyond nefarious.  Everything Trump does is designed siphon taxpayer's wealth in the form of a democratic society into his own personal gain.  He is I'll equipped for anythung outside of that and he does an abysmal job of hiding it.  A horrible investment.
I also think a lot of Republicans didn't vote at all in 2016 because they didn't know the real Trump.
I can separate people from their communist party that rules their countries. So you can separate Americans and Trump supporters.
I question everything about Trump.  What about the presidency makes it so important for someone so poorly equipped and received to want it bad enough to lie and cheat and steal to get it?  His criminal nature is infecting everything we are about and what actually makes us great.
I sure as heck hope this isn't a surprise to anyone because Trump has not only been a racist his entire life but has constantly stood with white supremacist movements and admires fascists like Kim Jong-Un, Viktor Yanukovych and Vladimir Putin. He cannot lead America. #Biden

If the MSM does their job instead of just repeating sound bites  from whatever crap Barr/Trump puts forward it would help. Every day he talks garbage and lies and we get to hear it repeated several times.
Of course it isn't better than a vaccine. But there are many people who must get back to work and can't afford day care or a nanny, so Schumer wants to make schools as safe as possible right now. He and the Demos are not supporting Trump's position, they want safety for kids.
I'm sorry but Bernie was never within 72 hours of clinching the nomination. He did well in the early smaller primaries but not the big ones. Bernie is a great guy and I have a lot of respect for him but anyone who would rather have Trump than Biden is clearly a Republican.
Not to mention, Trump is before the SCOTUS right this very minute with an attempt to kill the entire ACA, including this protection.  No one is safe with that lunatic in the White House.
It‚Äôs time to recognize the money Trump has siphoned off his ‚Äòcharities‚Äô. Money that was supposed to help children and veterans. He‚Äôs only in it for himself.

The Democrats should be doing everything they can to haul this guy in for public questioning. MONDAY. not on 4 weeks or 6 weeks when it's too late. Trump is actively trying to create the "delays" to voting himself so he can use it in his favor in November.
Same here, except I'm not confident Trump is in our corner. The next week or two should tell an interesting tale.
It is incredibly frustrating. When we see Trump's campaign accepted foreign help, then anything done during their time in office should be reversed: no court picks, no nothing. Should be voided. Sorry, bad behavior shouldn't be rewarded.
Next, trump will sign an Executive Order dictating Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness...his own idea from his most excellent superior best-in-the-world intelligent brain. #VoteBlueNoMatterWho2020 #VoteBlue2020

I'm not confident about anything. It appears to be Rice or Harris and I'd actually prefer Harris. She at least is more like Biden, a putrid politician rather than connected to HRC. Trump will win the election but the result may be altered. Are you confident?

This is a frequent Trump ploy. Look to see more Democratic-like moves in the coming days as the anti-left Trump runs for reelection, using already established Obama policies.  Ironic, no? Trump is constantly trying to take credit for things the evil Obama has already done?
My stomach turned when they booed the press and Trump hyped them up so they would do it some more. I can't wait for a return to decency.
So, Obamacare then.  He's invented Obamacare.  Just like Trump to take credit for something he didn't do.

No, stop lying. Trump is trying to bypass congress and that is what the problem is. We can't allow a president to rule by presidential decree, that is what dictators do. In the US we have the president, the congress and the courts. Trump thinks he can ignore the other two.
Despite Trump‚Äôs best laid plans, the message of John Lewis made an impact.   Way to go, kid!
The difference is that Cuomo and Schumer want to open the schools safely while Trump just wants to open the schools regardless of the danger to the kids.

Donald Trump has issues, but should liberals attempt to reach out to his fans. I don't know the answer, but the term "knuckle-dragging" probably pushes the away.  I made a video about learning to be better at political discussions.

Duh.  Trump has a personal grudge against China and they would rather have someone in office who would be willing to work things out. Putin likes having someone in office he can manipulate, so they're motivated to keep Trump in place.

Someone needs to ask Trump if he thinks the Earth is flat just to spice things up a bit
Trump‚Äôs plan is simply to let the virus explode and then use that as an excuse to say the election is impossible. We‚Äôll have over a quarter million dead by that point.
He has one. Trump‚Äôs plan is to let the virus run completely out of control so he can claim an election is impossible. #TrumpVirus
Trump was clearly given a specific set of stats to pitch, but doesn't really grok the basics. A decrease in "death to cases" only shows that MDs are learning how to treat people with Covid. Whereas "death (or cases) to population" reflects how we're managing its spread.
Agree. Similarly in the us trump is unambiguous in his agenda of Islamophobia while the Democrats are simply playing all sides- the shocking endorsement of hindutva icon  by none less than  is the latest in such a series of steps
sorry, youre on Team Trump now, cancelleee
Hmm...You register to vote with your signature. You get mailed a ballot &amp; you sign it - signature compared against that of your voter registration. My whole state has been voting by mail for several years. Trump et al wants us to believe they're postcards; but we're not idiots.
Trump, meanwhile, has yet to make a public statement on this, being too busy tweeting hackneyed slogans &amp; researching whether improving his putting skills will impact COVID.
I think the notion that Benghazi and "the unmasking" will drive out turnout for the hard right is a bit ridiculous. Fox News may love it, but their most diligent viewers are going to turn out for Trump regardless of who Biden picks for VP. And it won't impact moderates.
Kanye amplification, Epstein focus on Clinton while ignoring the obvious, faux outrage toward Biden‚Äôs racially insensitive comment. Etc. So many examples of bad faith engagement from Trump supporters.
As much as I despise the Trump administration, this jerk has a good point and there is plenty of evidence to support this statement.
"The class in power makes sure to pay their forces of repression first?" WOW - you are diva drama queen #1. Instead of sound bytes, how about you actually propose something to fix the systemic issues? You make noise the same way Trump does.
I would love if trump were weakening NATO but this is all a move to put pressure on China imo. Shuffling troops around from Europe to SE Asia just like the good old days
There is a national #COVID19 plan. Trump‚Äôs plan is to ensure the virus is so completely widespread that the election is impossible.  #Trump is Mussolini, #Putin is Hitler
Trump‚Äôs virus strategy now is to hope it becomes so widespread that the election is impossible.   #Trump is Mussolini. #Putin is Hitler.
Let‚Äôs be clear that the post Trump era must include legislation which puts a level of control on the executive branch. The founding fathers never imagined that king Henry would become President of the United States. Changes must be made.
Prince. Cause he's Prince. And because that would mean we're back before Trump's 2016 election and would have the chance to stop a world of hurt.
I would be perfectly fine to see #Trump in a lockdown mental health facility.
His plan is simply to have #COVID19 be so completely out of control that the election cannot happen.   #Trump is Mussolini. #Putin is Hitler. We‚Äôve seen this movie before.

No, we are all angry with Trump, Barr, McConnell.
Lol I really hope Trump supporters do stay home and boycott the election. Would do wonders for the country haha

Even a veterinarian in New Zealand conducts the testing for coronavirus.  No, America has its hands tied by Trump. He shuts everything down that he doesnt agree and replaces it with lies. Never thought China would handle this better than US. Thanks Trump.
You are as clueless as Trump. Well maybe not, he lies so that he won't look bad. But you believe him. We all know where it came from. Why the hell is China okay now and we aren't? Because Dems don't wear masks? Look at any Trump Rally.  Trump has blood on his hands.  What stops?
But let Trump worry about Tik Tok since its so much more important than a pandemic.
Donald Trump said he plans to bar the Chinese-owned social media platform TikTok from operating in the U.S  via    It wouldn't be that TikTok has been used by US youths to organize against Trump?
What's with Trump's right hand in that video? It like he's using an invisible cane or something.
The Economist. It has done an ongoing multi-faceted analysis based on the Electoral College. That was their probability graph.   Trump is actually projected to get way more Electoral College votes than Carter did. I just like how humiliating the probability graph looks.
This is why Trump put one of his major donors/supporters, Louis DeJoy, in place as Postmaster Gen. in June.
Wait, has Trump seen this? It may give him ideas for his wall.  You know, to improve relations with Latin America and all.
I like the sentiment, however 1) they probably charge for them (it is Trump after all), and that money goes to help fund his campaign, 2) they'll report those as "see how much voters love us" numbers.

No he didn't. He even said he didn't. People are going to church with phased in distancing. I saw more masks on Protesters than any Trump rally. But you think full school capacity is safe when Trump says the election should be postponed? Hypocrites!
But its ok for Trump to disrespect anyone and everyone on a daily basis? I doubt Obama would stoop enough to even say Trumps name. Trump plays high school games with the White House. Look what he posts on Twitter. Not Presidential at all. Complete embarrassment.
Why would Obama belittle himself to debate with this joke in the White House? Trump is sophomoric.
Ok then. This is what trust in Trump gets you.

Trump‚Äôs a Percy dude for sure - but nothing I see shows he diddles little girls. Clinton we know does as he went after young Monica L
Trump's insistence that this is going happen in spite of all Intel &amp; reason leads me to believe that: he &amp; his cohorts intend to perform a massive fraudulent action themselves. He'll then point to this fraud "that some country/Dems did" to declare the election invalid.

Apparently Herr "Il Douch√©" Trump believes the Constitution is just some optional suggestions he can toss away to suit himself.
TBH, the scaling back of USPS was visible in my community even prior to Trump: far fewer mailboxes on the street, plus the need to drive a ways to post offices because so many branches had been shut down‚Äîand it‚Äôs only accelerating now . . .

Trump wanted Greenland...
Bull. He just wants more time to come up with more ways to manipulate, suppress, and/or interfere with voting base. Mail-in ballots are no more a security risk than any other means of voting. It's a larger voter turnout that threatens Trump, McConnell, et al.

Get your facts straight. The MORON = TRUMP did not get over 50% of the people‚Äôs vote. He lost that by almost 3 million votes.

Trump is suggesting postponing the election. I can't see a world where Congress let's that fly, as it's not in his power to make that decision.  Either he knows this and is trying to distract from the abysmal 32.9% fall in the economy, or...
That's it. Trump has to go.

Check this out.  A Trump lawyer is actively trying to get Kanye on the ballot, and she did it in Wisconsin, a state Trump needs to win. Bottomline: Trump is campaigning for Kanye West to take votes away from Biden. #Biden2020
Linseed you've sold out and nobody respects you. John McCain is shaking his head from the grave. You've lost all credibility. Your only chance is to renounce Trump and get on board with what is right and good. You can stop doing what your doing.
Aww, they‚Äôre friends! Finally, Trump fits into the establishment!
Trump says Biden will "hurt God". Think about that. Trump is saying God is so weak, so vulnerable, that a lone Democrat can defeat him. That's not the God I believe in. How about you?

If Trump wins it is the end of Democracy. You two are at the top of the list, the most powerful, the biggest threat to Trump. If he wins, you two will be the first to go because he won't feel he can trust you in his quest for Dictatorship.
Rumors say that Trump is pondering an executive order granting women the right to vote. Amazing! Nothing like this has ever been done before
And you brought along Trump the Heretic. Trump said Biden would "hurt God". Clearly, Trump views God as weak, vulnerable, able to be beaten by a mere mortal. Is that how YOU view God? Do you agree with Trump that God is impotent? Why do you associate with a non-believer?
Not all of us appreciate the way he chooses to say what he believes. I would literally take any other president after Nixon and be happier at their behavior and how they treat others than Trump has.
Trump said Biden would "hurt God". Clearly, Trump thinks God is weak, vulnerable, able to be beaten by a common mortal. Trumps' God is apparently a loser. Trump said so.
I‚Äôm not sure I value the political predictions of someone who thinks a very significant amount of Dems are going to vote for Trump.  I take polls with a grain of salt bc upsets are possible but Biden‚Äôs doing better right now than Hillary was at her peak.
Hell yeah, sometimes you have to separate entertainment from politics in regards to practical candidates. I won't lie though, Dwayne Johnson would rock a celebrity president role much better than Trump or Ye, and it would make me ponder more. lol
We need a plan if Trump and Republicans steal election! 4 more years and we‚Äôll be dead.
A picture of a dead Bigfoot shot in the Highlands. The hunter (Shotgun Murry) claimed to have shot it, but after research it is believed to have died from COVID19. He was already dead when the hunter shot him. It was also proven by CBC NEWS that this was all Trump's fault.

No rudeness and belittling people when you're the president shouldn't be accepted but it's become expected from Donald Trump.
I've got an idea, they should take all Pentagon funding for the next two quarters. We aren't in a war right now other than Afghanistan (which we should have left anyway), and Trump will just raid that anyway for his idiotic wall. We can't eat a wall, and we can't live on a jet.
It‚Äôs obvious that insofar as Evangelicals support Trump in strong numbers‚Äîas they do‚Äîthey‚Äôre going to be subject to criticism. But then beyond just Trump the vague impression of many is that they‚Äôve sold out more generally‚ÄîTrump isn‚Äôt the exception.

I understand that there are all sorts of issues with discussing. I'm simply commenting on a president acting in a negative way and we dont blink at it. In previous presidencies this would have been a story. Now it's barely worth mentioning because Trump says nasty things often.
I'm not disagreeing with that, just commenting that any other previous president who got caught saying something unkind would have been a story. Trump does it so often that we don't even blink anymore. He's literally changed our expectations of presidential behavior.

To be fair, at this point in time, with MULTIPLE studies advising against HCQ as a treatment for Covid-19? Not the brightest Trump bulb in the conspiracy.
That is about as lame as it gets. maybe Russia thinks aliens might land and Trump would be better equipped to deal with them than Biden would? That sounds just as ridiculous as you do. Stop trying to defend the indefensible.

The explanation is machivellian. If Pompeo's reprimand to the Russian govt works out well politically, then Mr. Trump will claim credit for reprimanding. If it works out poorly politically or if Mr. Putin objects, then Mr. Trump will insult and fire Pompeo.

I guess a pardon mandates this sort of gratuitous boot licking.    Perhaps that's why Trump stands the way he does. It makes it easier to kiss his ass.

There's a paper trail and verifiable witnesses. To the guy  who said something about 3nd and 3rd hand info even watch Rachel interview the former ambassador? Doesn't sound like it.  Rachel doesn't have a fluff show or have Trump on the phone so he can spew his lies.
We need a  assessment on whether Biden will in fact ‚Äúhurt God.‚Äù Was Trump stretching the truth on that one? Maybe a yellow light on the truth-o-meter?
Maybe you should try and target the Trump voters because it‚Äôs obvious they‚Äôre having a difficult time pulling their head out of their ass and seeing the light of the day which everyone else can see it‚Äôs called the truth
What does Trump actually run other than his mouth.
By blaspheming him like Donald Trump.
I'm excited to vote Trump's punk ass out of office. Just like I was excited to vote for Biden in my state primary to end the Bernie cult. One cult down, one to go.
If you live in SC, for the sake of saving out country please vote for  He is a good man that will actually make a difference instead of sucking up to Trump every chance he gets like LG! Lady Graham if you‚Äôre nasty!
MAGAts worship him like a cult leader. I have a feeling, if he loses there will be suicides. People have made being in Trump‚Äôs cult a personality &amp; they will not be able to take it if they lose. (As far as I know, this is a real picture. Please correct me if you know different.)
Gamer Bros: SJW libs want to take our games away!  Trump: video games are illegal now
Anyone of true faith should be appalled by what Trump said and should be denouncing him.
Not on the fact that Trump has blown up the rule of law, passed on civil rights, enriched himself &amp; his family, let 160,000 Americans die &amp; your fucking worried about who #JoeBiden picks for a running mate. You deserve Trump.

If Trump looses this election because of the 18-20 YO backlash from the TikTok decision, historians should call it the  effect.
please stop it dude. America doesn't have time for your shenanigans this election. You can't fix a country when you haven't fixed yourself. Trump already proved that.

WTF?  I lived in Bangkok. The gracious citizens of Thailand (TIE-land) are Thais (Ties.) Better give  Trump's cognitive test.
True enuf.  But he also needs to offer a different, better vision.  A running mate would go along way to providing a face to the ‚Äúteam‚Äù leading us after Trump.
I just sit here a wonder how much money Donald Trump has made since he took office ? Anyone have an idea ? What‚Äôs your best guess ?
tRump thought the Yosemites were driven from Egypt by pharaoh with the help of a couple Corinthians.
What Trump hasn‚Äôt done is a terrible thing. When someone drops a glass and it shatters on the floor, you don‚Äôt blame other people that have dropped glasses in the past, you clean up the mess so people don‚Äôt get hurt. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Trump's only hope? Pull a Vinny the Chin
It‚Äôs great how war is a non-partisan issue. We must expand the empire at any cost.
It‚Äôs rare to do widespread phone banking before the nominee accepts; we don‚Äôt even know the down-ballot Dems in all states. Not sure why Trump‚Äôs campaign would even want people canvassing this early. They risk burning out volunteers they‚Äôll need later.
Indeed, President Trump should grant Clemency to all these innocents for whom the "Justice System" / Jury System failed them; i.e., Brendan Dassey; Julius Jones; Richard Glossip; etc.  &lt;3  &lt;3  &lt;3  That would show how BIG his heart is, etc.  I hope that pplwill pray 4 that wif me.
You mean Trump is hung like a Ken doll?? LmfaoThis is the genius main stream media told us at the beginning of 2019 was most likely to beat Trump.  The Democrats had some great candidates this year, but they didn't kow tow to the party elite.  So we get Pedo Joe.  #GiantMeteor2020 end it all please

And maybe a smart one. Shivers. I‚Äôm looking for things to be grateful for-one is that #Trump is stupid:cagey and corrupt  and manipulative, but stupid
I don't BELIEVE anything but my own eyes. I can clearly see how narcissistic Trump is, and can easily predict what he will do if he fears he will lose power. It's Narcissism 101, no degree needed. It's not political, it's psychological. He's a power hungry monster.
is it true that if there is no clear voted Pres. that Pelosi will be the interim president until it‚Äôs sorted out?  Makes sense that she would have Biden (a puppet) there to cause chaos between him and Trump, putting her in the house until it‚Äôs decided. Scarrrry!

The issue at hand has nothing to do with illegals, and you're a fool if you think anyone is buying that BS. Trump wants to keep blue voters from voting, because he knows he is losing. Notice it's always GOP trying to make voting harder? This is why.

It‚Äôs not possible for trump to debate. He doesn‚Äôt shut up, listen, or process.  Sort of like the old Chatty Cathy dolls where you would pull a string and get a recorded response. I can‚Äôt imagine trump adhering to the time constraints.

My brother in law has it. I was concerned when trump was elected because he kept repeating himself, said random unrelated things. It‚Äôs obvious trump has declined- his interviews show it clearly. A debate would be disaster.
Fuck this tired argument. It‚Äôs a lazy broken record one too. It‚Äôs up to Joe Biden to earn our votes. He is applying for the most powerful position in the world and you just want to hand it to him demanding nothing? That‚Äôs how we got trump!
I believe that any who support trump are ignorant and remain so by choice. They watch Fox news to confirm their beliefs - confirmation bias.

This is so perfectly spot on. I knew (many knew) when Trump was elected, it would be an utter disaster, but I never imagined this is where we'd end up. It is beyond heartbreaking. It is beyond infuriating. It is NOT beyond our abilities as a nation to begin to heal on Nov. 3rd.

First of all: you don‚Äôt know who I‚Äôm voting for. And it definitely is not a fascist like Trump. Second: Biden, whether I vote for him or not, is not just an awkward gaffe. If you think that‚Äôs all he‚Äôs done, you need to learn some history.

We are a laughing stock. Canada has a trump doll with a huge ass in a parade that spectators can walk up to and kick. Two things about that: 1. They are having a parade ( we are sheltering at home) 2. They are kicking the fat ass of a man they totally disrespect.
Before you say it, it's extremely unlikely Trump wins in a landslide and a close election with that much interference could be a disaster. And yes, 4 more years of Trump is also a disaster but that wasn't my main point
Duh.  Trump has a personal grudge against China and they would rather have someone in office who would be willing to work things out. Putin likes having someone in office he can manipulate, so they're motivated to keep Trump in place.
The virus and Putin both flourish with Trump in the White House. The American people want him gone. We need him gone. And he knows it. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs working to cook the vote.  #EvictTrump  #Landslide2020

tRump‚Äôs math is a little iffy, just like his bible reading.
Imagine being as racist as  to believe black voters will just vote for him because of the color of his skin.   Kanye, and Trump, are assuming they have no critical thinking skills and are just lemmings to any charlatan selling hydroxychloroquine pills on the corner.
Trump, among other things, is a grandstanding New Yorker who believes he has the right to do as he chooses. So was FDR but he obscured his thoughts under political laminate. What people do is what counts not what anyone thinks of them. We'll see.

Bulid in an automatic fact check. Every time there's a false or willfully misleading statement, they get a big red strike (ala "Family Feud"). After 3, they're out. Also, Trump is restricted to his podium ‚Äì none of this "sex predator stalking" behavior he pulled with Clinton.

Excellent thread on the importance of this election and why voting is so important. Trump will do whatever he can to contest this. Don't fool yourself into thinking he won't. His loss must be uncontestable. Don't waste a vote.
Are they talking about this very Trump?
There is no low below which Trump will not sink.
It isn't about if the NRA is good or bad (the NRA is several organizations and this wouldn't dissolve the NRA all up) it's about giving ammo to Trump 90 days before an election. Why not wait? Gun control is not politically advantageous. This hurts Biden.

Trump just issued 2 executive orders aimed at Chinese-owned apps, barring US companies from doing business with TikTok parent company ByteDance and messaging app WeChat

Christ=Christian.Christ's example was feeding the poor &amp; needy, healing the sick, commanding, "Love your neighbor as yourself, &amp; Do not judge lest you be judged." Trump lets 160,000 people die in a pandemic by not doing his job.But loves the #Bible. Yeah, right.  #Biblicalidiot

And the kinds of Americans who have traded citizenship, community, and austerity for the moral decay of celebrity worship and me-first thinking see him as their avatar and love him for it.  Trump is not the problem. The people who voted for him are the problem.
It's what we learned about every time Trump has been in the news for the last 40 years.  Anyone who acts surprised at this hasn't been paying attention, and Trump's popularity has always been the most glaring symptom of America's moral and societal decay.

No democrats do not want to do away with it. The current leadership wants to use your money for things that are illegal. Do you read? Trump doesn't
Trump also said he wouldn‚Äôt mind sleeping with Ivanka if she wasn‚Äôt he‚Äôs daughter. I don‚Äôt think Christians talk this way, so much for Christianity

And free trade is a manifestation of unregulated Capitalism.  NAFTA also set the stage for Trump's election, because the economic damages Americans suffered are seen as an artifact of Clintonesque neoliberalism.
Did Trump invent this?
I bet u wouldn't say that if trump had said it.
I guess that means you were always voting for Trump and have found your justification. Congrats, I guess?... at this point, the only way a VP pick should matter now is if Biden picked Trump or any of his enablers for VP...
I need healing. I‚Äôm repeating myself. I have a Trump parent and it is difficult in real life - beyond just tweeting about it. Dealing with it.
Tariffs aren't like sanctions.  Their mechanism is used primarily to make domestic products more competitive in local markets, so the motives aren't always punitive.  That said, Trump is unskilled in applying them in a way that doesn't come across as adversarial.

These pigs don't hyperventilate. They expect and think their lawyers will protect them. But!! You can tell when desperation kicks in. And the crime family is showing pure desperation.   I would say the Trump crime family is a bunch of sweating pigs right now.

One problem with this analysis: Only about 30 percent of registered WA voters voted in primary, vs. the 78 percent who are likely to vote in the general (based on 2016 numbers). Trump will drive turnout big time from indie, #WalkAway dems, &amp; casual/ first time voter support.

These Investigators are working a case that will 100% convict. They aren't playing around. Trump's desperation is so obvious too. He is scared. He actually thinks getting reelected will save him. This crime family needs to come down like Saddam Hussein's statue did!!
We all know Trump is a moron. I can guarantee they will uncover this crime family. They wouldn't be going through this unless they have enough evidence at this point. Those saying they won't find anything are in for a spoiler.
Oh trust me!!! Trump and his kids are scared, and they know their days are numbered. I cannot wait to see this crime family gone.
Guaranteed they will find what they are looking for. The Trump empire is about to come apart.
This is going to be the beginning of the end of the Trump crime family! I really look forward to seeing his empire crumble! There is no doubt they have him cornered now! FINALLY!!!

Interesting that  didn't react to my comment, but immediately liked yours. Only one opinion allowed!  Trump would approve.

IMO, Trump is a lazy freeloader. He doesn't care about anything or anyone but himself and how much money his business is making.

Trump seems to think all liberals are radical and hate God. It's amusing considering even a liberal atheist such as myself is beginning to pray for him to get dragged out of the office in handcuffs.

Your words are marked.  I suppose if you are wrong on this (I suspect you are wrong on most things), it still would not convince you to vote for Trump.  Trump is articulate, says what he means and means what he says.  He is the opposite of Biden, who really can't say a sentence.

Politicians had zero role in my dislike for Trump. That particular sentiment was fixed decades before he started playing in the political realm. Being a terrible president flows logically from his being a terrible human.
You voting for Joe or against Trump.  Nobody in their right mind would vote for Biden.  Trump has had a very peaceful 4 years as POTUS, helped a lot of people and rebuilt our military.  I don't think he has been callous at all.  I guess I need some examples.  Trump 2020!

Trump wouldn't know scripture if it walked up and smacked him upside the head with a bible.  How is a thrice-married (with five different kids between them) poster boy for the seven deadly sins the guy that these rubes follow, and not a life-long demonstrated, proven Christian?
I 100% agree.  Let's get the vote out.  Let's see what kind of following the dems get after your campaign -- everyone needs to vote.  The future of America is on the line and Biden looks to destroy it!  Make it clear to all involved.  We like America the way it is!  Trump 2020!
It means they failed to get the people to turn on Trump.  They are down to limited choices and intelligence is hearing chatter.  RNC shut down; but Trump will do it on the white house lawn.  As it is with stages of shock, they are angry and soon they will accept.  Protect Trump!

Right now the most important thing is that we get back what we lost.  Now, is not the time to push any agenda.  You won't be getting anything you want if Trump loses.  You are also a reasonable guy.  I know it is difficult but what you are risking is tremendous pain.
Yes, we do need to make America great again in 2020.... because Trump is destroying it

Interesting.  I agree with you that there should not be any mega rich.  Realize 90% of the mega rich are dems other than off the top Trump and musk.  Trump stated that he does not like the salary gap.  Equal people are not free and free people are not equal - democracy.  Careful.
Republicans couldn‚Äôt care less about the deficit.  (The link erroneously states Trump inherited the Great Recession; the article says the opposite is true.)
The article corrects the error in the link: Obama inherited the Great Recession, not Trump.

Wrong. The House picks the Pres. The Senate picks the Veep.   "The House named Mr. Biden president; the Senate and White House stuck with Mr. Trump. ... the nation stopped looking to the media for cues, and waited to see what the military would do."
What would a Biden scandal look like? Hunter Biden/Ukraine? Phony rape allegations? Those have already fallen flat. People want Trump gone, and they‚Äôre not going to fall for any more of Barr‚Äôs bullshit.
Trump should have no problem sending Baron to school.  He has hydroxychloroquine and kids are safe.  No issues what so ever.
Keep your promise to the American people and debate Trump.  If you are not up to the task, then you can't run the country.  If you feel strongly about being the leader of the free world, you can not cower in a corner and run for president of USA.  The world is waiting, Mr Biden.
If your state allows you to vote by mail, but also provides ballot boxes that you can drop those votes in, please make use of those if possible.  Trump will do everything he can to subvert ballots that enter the USPS system.

Stacy is great, and has the guts to say what needs said.  Trump needs to go now!
Yeah I am independent.  And you are correct Trump did not put bounties.  The consensus of the US intelligence community is that Putin did.  Trump was told, obviously since we know he doesn't read.  I served this country,  did you??
If mail in voting isn't blocked, this election will never be accepted.  What are you afraid of Inslee?  Let's have the election, get you removed from office and solidify Trump as POTUS.  Your days are numbered Inslee, Washington is going to vote you out of office!

He is too afraid Putin will release the pee pee tapes.  I feel like I am in the twilight zone.  Turning a blind eye to a world leader putting bounties on our men and women in uniform!!  Trump should be in prison.  How is this not Treason?

The shutdown is a punishment.  They are now doubling down on it.  It amazes me that the dems can blame the latest atrocity, no extension of unemployment benefits and no 2nd stimulus on Trump and the republicans -- when they are the ones that refused to extend them.

Besides, it's not like Trump is a good faith actor in this scenario, so we're not going to get anything but gaslighting from his performance on stage, anyway.  By all means, Biden should refuse to debate Trump. There's no point.
As someone who has watched every presidential debate since he was 9 years old (Reagan v. Carter, "There you go, again"), I gotta say that I don't see any point in Biden debating Trump. We already know both sides' positions. And COVID is a real thing.

Politicians had zero role in my dislike for Trump. That particular sentiment was fixed decades before he started playing in the political realm. Being a terrible president flows logically from his being a terrible human.
I literally have to tell this to all trump supporters. They are the most gullible mindless sheep that go along with anything he says. Oh and then call you sheep for having common sense.
I want Harris, but if Biden chooses someone else, I will still support him. I can‚Äôt allow another 4 years of Trump because I know the horrible impact he‚Äôs had on the people I love &amp; care about in my community. I would not do that to them or to myself. It‚Äôs bigger than a VP pick.
He did say ‚ÄúIf you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black‚Äù. He was a sassy comment on a radio show and later apologized.
The DOJ must prosecute trump so that no person dares put our Democracy at risk again. He should go to prison and be stripped of all titles, compensation, and benefits that come with being  president.  He pledged allegiance to himself only. #survivingtrump #VoteBlue #VOTEBLUE

same as looking at carbon emissions. Obama‚Äôs last year 5170 Trump 2019 5130 (mill met tons). Seems close but if I factor in Trumps included slightly lower numbers without the regulations that hindered job growth and cheap electricity that Obama put in place it‚Äôs not close at all.

Once the regulation is made and being met, that year will show you what that regulation accomplished, it doesn‚Äôt continue to drop after because YOU WERE MEETING THE REGULATION you don‚Äôt have anything causing it to drop more. So yes the fact that trump cleared the regulation
Lastly I could give a shit about the reduction. Trump put up lower numbers then Obama WITH LESS REGULATIONS. You seem to be under the impression that ‚Äúok put this regulation in place and then stuff will just continue to go down forever‚Äù that‚Äôs not how it works either

‚ÄúPresident Trump continues to act in delivering better and cheaper health care, protecting Americans with preexisting conditions, lowering prescription drug costs, and defending the right of Americans to keep their doctors and plans of their choice.‚Äù Say what?!
Please stop pretending JoeBiden is anything but a corporate tool pushed by the corrupt DNC. He‚Äôs better then Trump just leave it at that. It‚Äôs complete bullshit that we have that as our choice, the platform committee has shown who Biden is going to work for, it‚Äôs not the ppl.

trump is now spewing that Joe Biden is going to send the "inner city" to the suburbs, bringing crime and lowering property values.  He's citing the current unrelated protests as an example. Feds and all!  Where has he been Republicans? He's your "stable genius"!  (Continued) 3of4
Trump still brags how he has "done more for blacks than any other president", while for 3+ years, he has defunded or diverted billions from programs intended for "inner cities" (trump's synonym for black Americans).   How's Flint's water, trump?! ü§¢üò°ü§¨  (Continued) 1of4

If Trump‚Äôs puppet Postmaster General works to delay mailing of voter ballots, he risks being targeted in any and every way. Same for all corrupt Republicans.
Biden has said NUMEROUS things that if Trump had said them would be labeled as a racist. In addition to that Biden TRIED TO PREVENT THE COURTS From allowing desegregating schools.
Trump condemned white supremacy and the KKK in the exact same speech you are quoting. He was referring to normal people that were protesting the removal of the statue when he said ‚Äúgood people‚Äù however you ignore context and all the times he condemned the KkK in that speech
The GOP is losing long term members.  I wonder if the RNC has realized that they could save the Presidency and the Senate for the GOP by kicking trump and his enablers to the curb?   Their use of open corruption to win, at all cost, doesn't sit well with American's of conscience.

You missed Donald Trump's picture on there and Melania's too.
Bill Clinton is just one head of the hydra. He will not go down fighting which means others will go down with him. Including your precious Donald J. Trump. We already know Donald is a sexual deviant who at least fantasizes about having sex with his daughter Ivanna Junior.
That's a very long reach.  Any vote for Donald Trump is showing your support for child rape and sexual assault. You don't get to point fingers when you support a definite sexual deviant. The man fantasizes about sex with his own daughter.

Logic was never Trump‚Äôs strong suit. Fred must have hid him in the basement when the logic genes were passed out. (Of course, he seems to be missing a lot of other ones, too.)
Ike or Teddy would have slapped the shit out of Trump.
Fuck trump.
Trump is intent on becoming dictator-for-life *because* he sees it as the only way to get into the same wealth stratum with Putin and Mogilevich.  He must be stopped,
Because they are stupid. Trump followers?
Putin loves tik tok, his end game is to make us a pariah of the World. He wants us humiliated and mocked world wide. Trump is playing into his hands, again.
Look at it this way. If China uses TikTok to influence the upcoming election, and Trump wins, they can blame him for not banning TikTok, and thus he helped China influence his reelection. The ACLU gave up on The Constitution a few decades ago, in favor of political partisanship.
You dont debate Trump. You stand on a stage, he spouts lies and u teuths and abuses you. Why do that?
Looks the GOP just blinked.
how do you ban the KKK like even if Trump said  " We Ban The KKK " literally they will still hold rallies in their redneck woods. I guess you could go after the leaders whom are idiots and have twitter accounts but like. Idk man.
Get ready for TikTok to sue the Trump Administration. Trump loves a lawsuit!

Is this Trump‚Äôs GREAT? Not for most Americans.
Oh, cmon Ben. Can we ALL stop pretending that momentary focus on one issue means ignoring the rest.    would be a pretty poor president if he was endlessly stuck on one issue and refused to address anything else.   We get it, you hate Trump. This is a weak dunk...
Trump has no idea what he just did. He basically unleashed an Army that despises him. He has drawn all of their attention.
He lost Florida. He's done. Trump absolutely cannot win without Florida.
This all belongs to Biden.  I think you have them mixed up somehow and don't realize it.  You should check out  And see what you have to say. When arrests happen you will he like WHAT.
Maybe Trump will pardon Obama and Biden next year too.
Obviously you're a Biden supporter so there's nothing else I can say to insult you further.
Bernie, AOC, Obama, Biden. I could go on, but you get the picture. The left wants centralized totalitarian control.

Is it disqualifying for Harris to go along with pretending that Biden is OK and the top of the ticket? Is that level of deceit acceptable for a president? I would hope if the VP knew the P was incapable - they would speak out before the votes are cast.

I‚Äôve read it. We already have evidence that Obama directed the whole corrupt operation.
You‚Äôve missed something. Indictments don‚Äôt need to reach Obama/Biden to incriminate them, only their close officials. We already have plenty of evidence in the public domain.
He directed it. We have the records of the White House meeting where Obama led the whole thing. January 5th 2017.
He‚Äôll change his mind when the indictments pile up on Obama/Biden administration.
Name a reason you not voting for BIDEN without mentioning TRUMP
Will, what did you honestly expect....the corrupt protecting the corrupt! Durham and Barr gonna make "swamp" very uncomfortable for the next few months....Biden needs to be worried, he was dead caught in the middle of this abomination of a presidential coup!

What people don't understand about my outrage is I have no real problem w/Harris or Biden being on the ticket.    What I have a major problem with is BOTH on ticket &amp; NO Progressive representation on the ticket.
Trump has already said he won't accept Biden winning.  Nothing new here.
Bullshit, Biden is far more intelligent than the clowning tge while house. Thighland, Yo se mites, and let's not forget 2 Corinthians.
To: Mitch McConnel Ya know, it's one thing for your GOP folks to slant questions during hearings to "get the other side of the story"  It's quite another for Ron Johnson to blatantly say that he is using his committee to get dirt on Biden for the sole purpose of electing trump
Gotta love the deflection. Biden‚Äôs gaffes are dementia, it‚Äôs elder abuse.
More deflection. It‚Äôs hard to accept where this‚Äôs going, isn‚Äôt it? Indictments are coming for the Obama/Biden administration.
So......when Biden is Inaugurated, would you prefer he quote Gerald Ford....re: Nixon "Our long National nightmare is over" or should he say...re: trump "All of our National dreams have come true"

How is there not an age limit on who can run for president? Like this man Biden is 77 years old, would be 78 going into office. Like what?? The average life expectancy for a male in the US is 76 üòÇ
Except, this one won‚Äôt fall apart because of Obama/Biden and Mueller corruption.
Imagine if Biden or Obama or Hillary announced to the nation they they were "coordinating" with the Treasury Secretary to give "payments" to the American people without Congressional approval?
And we know she is voting for Biden-Harris
Biden and Harris will end this national nightmare we are living in.  Hands down, they will restore civility, stop the racism, stop the madness Ttump has brought down on all of us.  So pack your bags cause you going down too.

Biden/Harris 2020.  Yea baby!!!
Even if masks are required in heavily populated areas or areas where #COVID19 cases are high... cases aren't high everywhere. For example, would you force someone to wear a mask on a ranch in Wyoming? Biden/Harris and many of their supporters sound like control freaks to me.
So will she announce she is supporting the Biden/Harris ticket to avoid past missteps at the Republican convention?
Biden and Harris just had a private meeting with a number of advisors, including former Fed Chair Janet Yellen....  I would loved to have heard the discussion about the current Fed action of buying  corporate stocks to prop up the market.

Too bad it won't happen with the Biden Harris ticket.
I'm not young and I'm not going to vote for Prez/VP, only for down ballot.    My state is a guaranteed win for Dems. Biden doesn't even bother to campaign here. The elections are called before they even start counting my state's votes. My vote literally does not matter.

Saunders: Ask if Biden‚Äôs supporters will accept the results
Covid19 is a perfect analogy for American politics. Trump is the virus, and Biden is a mask. The mask is uncomfortable, and you're not happy you have to wear it, but you understand that if you don't it will literally cost lives so you wear it, because it's the right thing to do.
Does anybody else ever feel personally attacked by Trump? Because he's going after social security and affordable housing, and my medical care, and my LGBTQ community and my vagina. Then all these privileged white guys on my feed take a "never Biden" stance that could kill me.
Cannabis leaders react to Biden‚Äôs choice of Kamala Harris: Will she help or hurt marijuana legalization?
Wait...what? You are looking at suppression Polls? who does that? You didn't learn a damn thing in 2016 did you? the Helmuth prediction model has Trump 363 to Biden 176, which many believe is a low estimate, it will probably more like 400 to 144. I guarantee you. Just watch.
How can someone throw stones at Biden for a sexual assault allegation and simultaneously try to bully someone on Twitter by using sexually suggestive heresay as the anecdote?  Oh, they‚Äôre a trump supporter who also retweets sexual abuse ignorers (Jim Jordan). You are no patriot.
Biden is accused of ONE horrible crime and no one knows what happened. We do know the accuser changed their story multiple times. I dont use moral high ground to claim it‚Äôs acceptable or not. Trump has been accused of raping multiple women and a child too. You‚Äôre morally inept.
Are you talking about Alabama‚Äôs Jeff Sessions, the Attorney General that was confirmed in the senate by republicans only? Betsy DeVos? Trump? Biden has progressed from his stances from 40 years ago while republicans senators and the current president and staff still support it?!
Even Biden?
No.  And Warren would be forced to betray her progressive beliefs to enforce Biden/ Harris Wallstreet agenda.
I'm in a, Blue State where Right-Leaning Wallstreet Dems Biden/ Harris don't even bother to campaign.  They don't care about us because they call the elections before including our electoral votes. They don't give a damn about progressives. So they won't miss it when I don't vote
I feel like Biden picked Harris just to add diversity.
No.  I would have been okay with Karen Bass too.  She has progressive cred.  But Progressives are being denied representation in any power seat.  Right-Leaning Dems like Biden/ Harris take us for granted. Don't even campaign in my blue state. My vote doesn't matter to them.
I lived through Reagan years.  Biden is damn close to a Reaganite
She jumps on the bandwagon after she thinks it will get her points.  Her campaign was Right-Leaning which is why Biden picked her and Wallstreet is celebrating.
Biden and Harris would have been considered Reagan Dems in the 80s. They've moved the "center" way to the Right.  Wallstreet is celebrating.    I'm in a Blue state so they won't miss me not voting for Pres.  They don't even campaign here.
Still not going to support them.  My state is Blue. Progressives are the only ones that listen to us.  Biden &amp; Harris don't represent Progressives.  So they won't miss my vote.  I'm voting down ballot but will vote None on President/VP
They don't even campaign here because Washington is a reliably Blue state.  The only ones who have cared are Progressives.  Biden &amp; Harris don't care about our votes.  So why bother when my vote won't matter.
First off,  they're to the right of most Dems.    But... here's the only selling point necessary  Biden/ Harris aren't Fascists like Trump/ Pence
I'm not a Bernie fan.  Biden could have united the party by picking Warren.  Instead her picked a Wallstreet,  Right-Leaning,  "Law&amp;Order " cop
Cool. You didn‚Äôt even bring one single rational reason to the thread for your prejudices towards Biden and your unequivocal support for Trump. Your commentary was completely full of hypocritical bipartisan hacks. The fact you cant even promote a single rational reason says It all
Your point? That you hold Biden to a much higher standard than you do with Trump and Republicans? There‚Äôs video of Trump lying about cheating on his wife and wishing child self traffickers well. Your political hack jobs are a disgrace to free speech and the american way.
It was over 40 years ago. Again, why endorse republicans who have/had the same opinion yet attack Biden for it? Cause you and others with the same sentiment have no moral compass at all. You are not a patriot. Patriots don‚Äôt use their freedom to promote hypocrisy. Despicable.
Why do you care about what Biden did 45 years ago? Republicans were the masterminds behind segregation laws and DeVos and Trump are trying to bring it back yet you use It as a talking point to attack Biden? You have no moral compass. Is this how we make America great again?
Your partisan hacks here are anti-American and unpatriotic reasons for  bigotry. If you‚Äôre going to try to use talking points to discredit Biden don‚Äôt use ones that overly discredit Trump too. Make them at least rational. How do you only have hypocritical talking points?
That Trump is exponentially more of a racist than Biden. True. Yet you‚Äôre still voting for Trump? Thanks for clarifying your rationale behind your support for Potus 45. Trying to argue not to support Biden cause he‚Äôs racist when Trump is quantifiablly more racist is unpatriotic.
It‚Äôs pathetic that supporters of Trump even try to bring up the race card when attempting to discredit Biden. How patriotic and American. Way to Make America Great Again. One hypocritical and biased opinion after another to justify your prejudices and ignorance.
Racist you say? When did Biden take out multiple newspaper ads calling for the death of black teenagers that didn‚Äôt even commit a crime and then refuse to apologize or admit wrongdoing when it was proven they were innocent? He didn‚Äôt? Who did? Trump you say?! What a rarionale.
Q: Have you sent this same tweet to Biden? If not, why?
And now we're really pissed off.  We'll vote out the fascist,  but are not going to support the Corporate Right-Leaning Biden/ Harris Admin when they're in office.
She doesn't even respect Biden. She must be drunk on power. Where is her personal integrity. Oh, maybe she doesn't have any.i
Yeah.  Warren was gracious,  letting Biden take credit of her plans revised for COVIDtimes.  Biden used them to get support.   And has now clearly signaled with Harris as VP nom,  that he will NOT be working towards them at all.  They both would have been Republicans 40 yes ago
No they won't because we're being denied representation at the table. We have to choose Biden for less abuse but it's still Wallstreet Right-Leaning abusive policies.
More than half of the Democratic Party is being denied a power seat to represent us.  This is nothing short of major regressive move for the Dem party even if we are required to vote for Biden to get rid of Fascists.  It's still a hostage transfer situation to just less abuse
Does NOT mean I support Biden/ Harris in ANY way except to get Trump out then throw them out in 2024!
We have nothing to vote FOR , only AGAINST.  That's all because we're being denied representation in the seats of power.  So we vote AGAINST Trump Fascism by being forced to vote for Biden/ Harris Right- Leaning Wallstreet regressive ticket.
One of my fb friends is all mad. She‚Äôs big mad! But claims she‚Äôll vote for Biden anyway.  She‚Äôs railing about KH because of Bernie blah blah blah...
Didn't Trump just say yesterday the pandemic of 1917 (1918) ended the second world war. Yeah, he did. So at this point which old guy do you trust more? My money is on Biden. Cause Trump is Putins puppet.
Wait...was Joe Biden not vice president to president Obama for 8 years?

Yeah.  Warren/AOC 2024 and AOC 2028. If we survive the right- leaning Biden-Harris years.  But as older working poor with disabilities,  I'm going to be screwed for 4 more years either way.
Well,  I won't vote for Harris in 2024 unless the only alternative is another Fascist.  That's the only reason to vote for Biden/ Harris if you're a progressive.  I want more representation than "At least we're not Fascists. "
It hasnt happened in 4 years, but we *can* actually hold politicians accountable for their bullshit while in office. That is a thing we can normally do.  I just hope Biden's actually ready for the broke, sick, angry, radicalized nation he's about to inherit.
The electoral college says otherwise. I'm voting Jo Jorgensen, but in my state I'm sure Biden will win, so it doesn't really matter who I vote for. But at least I voted for the person I think would do the best job.
We'll vote for Biden,  because we have been FORCED to become One- Issue voters since we now have zero representation on the ticket.  Our only issue is voting Trump out. You can't make it into any kind of good, though. Because the Right-leaning Dem ticket betrays working poor.
Like the single issue voters voting to get Trump out? Because Biden Harris is crap for representing me.  The only reason they get my vote is because the alternative is Fascism.  I may puke voting for them, but I'll do it. Even knowing that they have it out to destroy Progressives
They will never fix it.  They are Wallstreet darlings.  That's why Wallstreet is celebrating Biden picking Harris.  Progressives have been betrayed again.
I didn‚Äôt say Biden wants to kill it. Their party is moving that way. Look at their up and comers.  says he loves capitalism all the time. I‚Äôm just pointing out the insanity of voting for bigger government instead of smaller. Trump needs to go. But not to these two.
I‚Äôm voting for Biden as a stop gap. But  we should all buy ARs.
Also,  remember Cabinet members are usually a short term career ending job.  She wouldn't go back to the Senate.  None of her policies would be implemented.  Except for the ones Biden &amp; Harris have stolen to pad their lack &amp; pretend they will work for ordinary Americans.

Did Joe Biden take out newspaper ads to wrongfully convict black teens of murder and refuse to apologize or admit wrongdoing when they were finally exonerated and freed? Didn‚Äôt think so. Who did? Oh, yeah. That was Trump
I‚Äôm confused. You claim you‚Äôre tough on crime and all this video does is claim Biden is too. How does this make you look good exactly? If anything, It makes him appeal to more conservative voters. Are you conceding already? It will save lives if you do.
Kamala worked with Joe Biden's son, Beau. He has a soft spot for her.
Except Biden/ Harris is a Wallstreet,  Right-Leaning, "Law &amp; Order " ticket that only pays lip- service to progressive causes.  Their slogan may as well be "We're Not Fascists Like The Other Side", because that's the only thing getting them elected.
Biden proved today that he does not support working poor Americans. We'll vote for him instead of Fascism,  but he won't be making any progressive changes like we need.
Don't lecture me.  I know better than you having lived through it.  There were excellent choices to move in a progressive direction at a time when it would be supported because of Trump and COVID.  Instead Biden picked Wallstreet "Law &amp; Order" after stealing Warren's work.
Unless Schumer quits and manages to appoint her to Dem Senate Leader--OR--Biden recinds his requirement for SCOTUS nominees to be Black,  there's no adequate position that she should accept.  Everything else is just being a mouthpiece forced to promote someone else's policies
I wish I could of seen Joe Biden‚Äôs reaction when they told him who his running partner was ü§£
People like WALLSTREET who are celebrating getting their right- leaning corporate Dem ticket?  Only reason there's any progressive support is bc alternative is fascism. It's only lip-service/won't enact ANYTHING progressive. Biden has signaled no seat for Progressives at table
Biden would have never picked Kamala if Fentanyl Floyd never died
We will never get Warren as Dem Senate Majority/ Minority Leader. Schumer won't step down &amp; Corporate, Blue Dog,  Law &amp; Order Dems like Harris would never vote for her to be.   Biden rejected her for SCOTUS because she isn't Black.  There are no more power seats for Progressives
If she were in the Cabinet,  she would be forced to enact the regressive right- leaning policies of Biden/ Harris.  Only a mouthpiece lackey without the power to make progressive change.  It's a short term crap. Career ending job.
I am kinda "meh" about the Kamala Harris VP pick. This has been the rumor for the last few months. I will vote for Biden but only because the alternative is far worse.
are democrats who are saying they‚Äôre going to refuse to vote for biden/harris really fine with trump winning again???
I said I would vote for the lesser evil.  That doesn't mean I will support the evil.  I'm voting AGAINST Trump. Not because I like or support a Biden Harris agenda.
She would be forced to run BIDEN'S Treasury, not hers.  Not progressive
Celebrating Biden/Harris 2020
Tell it to Biden who has denied Progressives representation.
No.  We're not.  I'll vote Biden/ Harris,  but I will not support their regressive agenda that denies Progressives a seat in one of the power positions.
Warren was SHUNNED by people like Biden who refused to support her for heading the CFPB even though she created it!!!!
And all of that is driven by POTUS, VP, SENATE Leaders,  etc.  Cabinet just are mouth pieces to do the work.  Warren would be blocked from making Progressive changes by Biden and Harris.    This is a bullshit move and Progressives won't forget it.
My advice is once Biden is in, we all should start a movement aimed at kicking out the chair from under the Corporate Democrats. First order of business: Ranked Choice Voting in all 50 States. Second order of business (can be concurrent): Find and run actual leftist candidates.
No.  POTUS. VP. Senate Dems Leader. House Dems Leader. SCOTUS.   Those are the positions with power. Biden has already ruled EW out of SCOTUS because she isn't Black.  The others are not open or up to him. They won't happen.  So,  yeah.  The Progressive Wing is betrayed again.Funny who funded this!?!

Ironic, isn't it.  btw same holds for my neighbor (the only sign on the block), which prompted me to order a Biden/Harris lawn sign, which should be here by the end of the month.  Put up some competition.
hey bernie sanders is a left winger! and Joe Biden is a liberal. let‚Äôs play a game where we guess which one supported segregation!
while she is a populist, that is a very broad term that can even be used to describe some one like Joe Biden is some instances
He doesn‚Äôt want a cabinet roll with Joe Biden.
so if we are going to hold his past to him so tightly, even if it‚Äôs just words, let‚Äôs talk about the crime bill. let‚Äôs talk about Biden‚Äôs stance on gay marriage. let‚Äôs talk about his view on segregation.

Biden doesn't need a shit ton to rally.  Trump threaded the needle in 16. Not happening again
I'll bet Mrs. Biden's boobs are real though....
Biden is offensive in the way some old codger is who hasn‚Äôt changed with the times but who you know doesn‚Äôt have hate in his heart. trump is offensive in the way someone taking a shit in your burrito is.

‚ÄúBrain dead Biden‚Äù is my vote. I was going to be nice to Joe but after once AGAIN promoting the #FinePeopleHoax as real, F him.
Wrong.  He knows that the only way Democrats remain relevant is to flood election offices in November with mail in ballots from non citizens throwing the election to Biden.  If Democrats are so sure of their superiority they should vote in person with voter ID.
Strategically, why should he?  If Trump had Biden‚Äôs lead(s), there‚Äôs no way he would.  In fact, one of the reasons Biden has such a big edge is because Trump keeps doing interviews.
But all that's beside the point. Trump OR Biden, what in the FUUUUCK are all of us who can't wear masks supposed to do? My wife can't wear one either due to trauma in her childhood. What's she supposed to do? She can't fucking work. And I guess face shields aren't "good enough."
Been mostly functional again.  instead, Biden chose the divisive and controversial one. Trump will still lose but nothing fundamentally gets better and we'll be stuck with tribalism, culture wars, ineffective dysfunctional govt for a decade. We needed a transformational, uniting
I believe could have turned some Rs into lasting "Amy Ds", would have been awesome down ballot wherever she campaigned.  Trumpists I know openly feared her before she dropped out.  There would have been no drama on election night and the Biden/Klobuchar ticket would have had
That whiteness itself will continue to be attacked.  They believe they are vlting for Kamala to be the next POTUS. They don't trust her. May not love Biden but they trust him not to do anything radical. Kamala is all over the map at different times depending on the sitch...
What she did to Biden at the debates. And those that pay close attention despise the fact that the wokes drove out Amy, the candidate they actually like, over BS. They see similar types of things happening the next 4 or 8 years.  The never ending woke stuff and the feeling...
It sounds like you have already put into your mind that you will lose the presidency, don‚Äôt be so quick to make excuses just because Biden is playing the gender and race card by bringing in Harris.
It is funny. It is the post.  There is one thing though, New York isn't polled that much. The last one in June by Siena showing Biden +25%. RCP  BUT, this is the Trump playbook! Lie, and lie some more. Big lies and get some to believe in "Alternate facts".

To the folks poking fun at Biden for holding his iPhone ‚Äúupside down‚Äù, with the speakers &amp; mic away from himself. Since the original iPhone, I‚Äôve pointed my speakers to the closest vertical surface and not myself. Sound is better after bouncing back. Try it. Mic works fine, too.

It's great that you can't stand Biden-Harris. But the nasty memes &amp; links you're sharing, are probably circulated by the russians. You're playing right into their hands. I'm not 100% satisfied, either. But we got to do what we can to get that demon out of the white house, pronto!
I guess that's why white women are LYING, claiming to be black women to get higher paid jobs.  Over half a century the Democratic Party has systematically DESTROYED the black middle class family, &amp; created chains of poverty for black people. Biden is the enemy, not the friend.
1st Biden said your not black if you vote for Trump...now he said we're not good citizens if we don't wear masks. All the time, outside wear masks... You really going to vote for this trash America?
This should be in EVERY Biden campaign ad. #BidenHarris #JoeBiden
They wanted her as POTUS &amp; when that wasn‚Äôt going to happen, they pulled her out so she couldn‚Äôt face #Tulsi like criticism. She‚Äôs who they wanted. Dems don‚Äôt pick their candidates. Now they‚Äôll push her to POTUS in front of #Biden &amp; push him out. ‚ÄúDemocracy‚Äù

Remember when they said ‚Äúmoving the embassy to Jerusalem was going to blow up the region‚Äù ... it didn‚Äôt happen. They‚Äôre lying to you.   GOP new voter registration in swing states &amp; fund raising totals don‚Äôt support your Biden win theory. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I'm well aware of Obama's terrible record on immigration.  It's very easy for us folks with no stake in the game to say it's no worse under Trump, but for the people I know who ARE effected, having Biden over Trump makes a massive difference.
For better or for worse, Trump lost too much support to win again. We're stuck with President Biden and Harris now for at least the next four years.
I need to get a Biden one for that reason.
He also passed DACA, which has had tangible benefits for my friends. Biden will protect DACA, Trump wont.
No man. You live in Vegas. It‚Äôs a sure thing right? Go put $1,000 on Biden ‚ÄúSniff your kids‚Äù &amp; Harris ‚Äúlock you up for pot.‚Äù  It‚Äôs a sure thing right? Guaranteed cash. Do it.
Absolutely. The DNC and the Biden campaign can't bring the fire because they don't have any in them.
There is no way Pete is going to primary incumbent Democrats. No chance. If Biden decides  not to run Kamala will, and Pete will work hard to see her elected.
What #Kamala #Harris Means for #Wall #Street and #Silicon #Valley. #vpotus #election #biden #election
I really am tempted to do full anti-electoralism some days because my change in suffering under Biden vs Trump is marginal - I guess that's sort of a result of my white privilege. When I remember the unique needs of oppressed peoples tho, I just cant morally justify that position
I don't disagree with you that people will suffer regardless, but there will be less suffering under Biden. For example, I have friends who are DACA recipients that live in fear under Trump who are guaranteed to be protected under Biden.
Y‚Äôall know you misspelled Trump?        ‚ÄúAt every turn, Biden has been wrong about the virus, ignoring the scientific evidence and putting left-wing politics before facts.‚Äù -
Counterpoint: the most vulnerable people in our society are going to be more hurt by another 4 years of Trump than 4 years of Biden. I advocate for socialism because I care about the well being of others, and Im willing to compromise my idealism for their sake.
That's not Joe Biden
Yep. He's making a gamble that Biden supporters will stay home, at the expense of the groups you mentioned *and* the health of his own supporters. He'd let all of them die in a heartbeat if it meant he didn't lose.
It was wrong in the case of Cruz, and it's wrong in the case of Harris.   American politics is sick and morally bankrupt.   Trump, Biden, Harris, Pence,     - all aren't worthy of representing the American people.
Joe Biden is going to lose no matter what
How can you say that? You are hearing the words that were spoken from VP Biden‚Äôs mouth. These are his words.

HAS ANY MOTHERFUCKER IN AMERICA IN 2020 TOOK THEIR HEADS OUT OF THEIR ASSES AND NOTICED THE AMOUNT OF RACISM AND SOCIAL UNREST THERE IS?AND DO YOU HONESTLY THINK A WOMAN OF COLOR WILL GET ANYWHERE NEAR THE WHITE HOUSE IN NOVEMEBR???!!
Creepy, sleepy Joe would resign for "health reasons" if they took Whitehouse. The Biden/Harris ticket is not going to win, the Dems know it. Both Biden &amp; Harris are just being given fake fealty as a show of thanks. All insiders know the Dems are going to lose.
The Obama to Biden districts were a problem and Amy won TRUMP districts.  And probably AA turnout as well.  Both contributed.  But if they weren't going to turn out in 20, WOW.
I'm told they are the most pragmatic voting block ever.  I'm told Trump is an existential threat to them.  You telling me, they weren't going to show?  Even tho they did big for Biden in the primaries? Those narratives are apparently BS.

And I won't be voting for Joe Biden. He's much too much of a conservative and Republican for me. The same goes for Harris.  But keep trying to pretend that this is the most radical far-left ticket in the history of our country because Twitler told you to.

A lot of Biden voters were more enthusiastic about voting against Trump then they were FOR Biden. This seems to be cementing Biden support (or Dem ticket support) amongst that group of voters
I'm afraid to show my support for Biden. TRIED to go camping 2 weeks ago. My in laws got into a HUGE debate. Dont mix alcohol and politics.

I make no secret of my disdain for the DNC. They're paid to ignore us and market to us without actually solving anything. Biden isn't even on my list of grudge candidates (let alone one I'd be happy with). But I intend to use every tool at my disposal to save folks I care about.

Inside the grueling VP search that led Biden to Harris
U vote for what is there now.  ND biden is the clear choice.  But Im 100% positive this loses other votes.  Just a matter of how many proggressives are now "energized".  FFS I'm willing to vote for an old, gaffe prone guy who doesn't match me politically with a race baiting...
I‚Äôm sure Joe Biden is shivering in his boots because Dilbert is pissed at him.
What bugs me is that it bugs suupporters to acknowledge reality on both sides on this. Its all politics.  Facts do not matter to one side more than the other.I vote Biden cause he's better than Trump.  Thats it.  But I won't deny the reality that the dude ain't sharp as should be
Just honestly ppl, Biden has lost a step which is to be expected for an old man.  Always been a gaffe machine but its worse now.  I dont hate him for natural shit.  But lets not be delusional about it.

I'm curious about your position that The Revolutionary Communist Party has endorsed Joe Biden. This was prior to his VP pick. If you are supportive of that, then bye bye to your trust fund and material positions &amp; private life.
Clinton won Minnesota by 1.5%, and I don't see much evidence that Biden would be that close to Clinton's margin. My guess is the truth is more like Biden +6/7 than either +2 or +12.

I disagree, because I think the federal deficit is already $2.7T, in large thanks to Trump‚Äôs administration‚Äôs spending. Democrats like Biden and Harris are working to make sure every American can financially survive the pandemic.

The narrative on the right, and basically accepted by many mods, is that Biden is losing it.  They like him well enuf under the circumstances but many doubt he makes it thru 4 years
You understand that your vote means nothing to them right? Even if there are enough lefty never Biden folks to throw it to Trump, they‚Äôre totally ok with that.   Trump = easy fundraising &amp; an easy foil to blame all the craven stuff they want to do anyway. We have 0 leverage

Not a waist. Look at the candidate that fits you and represents what you want in a leader. Not a waist!   Its a waist when you blindly pick a candidate and you did no research. I hate the "anything is better than what we have" argument." I equally hate the "Biden is Evil".
Bernie should have been the DNC nomination all together. But we already know they rigged the election to give Hilary the nomination, why wouldn't they do that again for Biden?

The moments before Biden choosing Harris were tense and full of humor
Analysis: What Joe Biden's choice of Kamala Harris says about him
Straight set up. There is no way, in any sane person‚Äôs mind, that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are the best option to not only lead our country but to defeat Trump in an election. No fucking way.  Prison population will increase &amp; be the new form of slavery under that admin, watch
Biden...Harris...One thing I can agree with is it‚Äôs better than the alternative, and if I could vote I‚Äôd wake myself up to go to the voting booth, get it over with, use some sanitizer, then wipe the tears from eyes.
I believe Harris puts the Senate in play for Rs.  I believe she is that unpopular with mods.  They are cool with Biden.  Harris is too far.
Its similar to a Trump Cruz ticket.  This isnt typical make up after a nasty primary shit.  Deeply personal.  This is the first time I've felt like Biden wasnt completely in control of the campaign.  I mean damn, she said that about you and knows better!
Hard same. Warren is the only candidate on Biden's VP list I have *any* respect for, and she's got her own truckload of problematic baggage.   Kinda makes me wish there was a way to kick everybody over 50 out of politics -.-'
The benghazi shit wouldn't play with the mods; only rally Trumps base.  I can say this very confidently:  Eastern WA mods can't stand her.  At. All.  The biden debate thing sealed the deal.  There's so much shit on her.  Only EW wouldve been worse and the VP matters this year
It really is like Trump picking Cruz for Veep.  I really thought Biden was stronger than that.  Honest to goodness wow.
Hot take:  Amy will never be POTUS.  She'll take a cabinet post and get wrapped up in some impossible BS controversy.  Biden had the opportunity to pick the most qualified AND electable and chose to appease the progressive woke crowd.  He is not who I thought he could be.
Thank you Vice President Biden for choosing President Harris. I think President Obama will agree with his Vice President.

Amy was the most obvious choice there has ever been. Ive never had a strong opinion on VP ever!  Didn't care.  Matters this year. And Biden cut the field to like an 8th of Americans to satisfy the wokes.  And ppl saw that.  Wasnt about best person.  Was about pandering

There are shit tons of not never Trumper moderate Rs who are inclined to vote Biden under the circumstances.  I meet with them every single day. And this will be a net negative for them cause they think a vote for him is a vote for her as next POTUS. May still vote Biden, may not

I'm riding with Biden under the circumstances but I'm very disappointed.  And I know how mods feel about her.  It will sway some cause they view her as the next POTUS.  Lead is big enuf he can get away with it.
I'm a mid 30's white cishet man. I'm the last one who should be spouting opinions, so I'll keep it short.  I'm not thrilled with Kamala. I'm still voting for Biden because not Trump. Neither choice is good, one is less bad. I'll take 4 years of no action over 4 years of decline.
Yeah not sure why u dumb over an opinion that has relevance. Biden a weirdo and Kamala got a past. I'm sure my vote will go that way still but there are questions I need to hear answered or I won't vote at all.
Well, it's about time. They are the only group YET to be insulted in, oh, I'd say... a few thousand years.  Oh, and this headline is missing the word "white".  Trump Suggests 'Men Are Insulted' by Biden Committing to Pick Female as His VP
The VP position has turned into more of a symbolic position used to regain voters the presidential candidate lost. She's only picked to help Biden win. Trump picked Pence to help him gain that Christian vote. He fooled many. Hopefully Biden will tap into his VPs skills.
I disagree. She's evolved. People do. She has name recognition and broad appeal. Most of the Twitter polls had her way ahead. I think it's a strong ticket. Marijuana is legal now in many states, it's not demonized as it once was. It's a non-issue. Biden said he'd leave it alone.
Yes, it's definitely Joe Biden's fault you're voting for a dumb criminal bigot.  We totally expected you to not do that.
Let's go back to the old days when the second-place vote getter became the vice president. Imagine Trump/Biden or Biden/Trump!
Welp as expected, I‚Äôm ready to fill out my ballot for Biden, now, Biden/Harris.  I don‚Äôt need the garbage between today and 11/3.  My vote won‚Äôt change. I knew who Trump was before and still do. #bidenHarris2020
I would like to thank the DNC for choosing  as Biden‚Äôs VP Nominee. (I wonder if Joe knows yet?) Thank you for doing everything possible to throw the election!
It takes one to know one &amp; they both know about locking blacks up. But this is their chance to reconcile with the county for the wrongs they‚Äôve done. Biden gonna put a black woman on the Supreme Court too.
Kamala Harris 'honored' to be Joe Biden's VP pick
Biden &amp; Harris have put a lot of blacks in prison, &amp; she is married to a white man. But she still is black &amp; now they ( Biden &amp; Harris) have a chance to fix a lot of the problems wrong with our justice system. They know because they did a lot of of it.
Yup, kinda what it seemed like. Congrats to Biden on a wise choice &amp; to Harris on being chosen!üëç
Status Coup BREAKING: Joe Biden Picks Kamala Harris as Vice President Running Mate
So Bindi Irwin is pregnant and Biden just selected the first Black woman to be a running mate for VP. Oddly one of the best days of 2020 so far.
Joe Biden hasn't held an official government position (VP) since 2017, so that's not possible. His time as a senator ended in 2009.
I think Biden has all but said he wants to groom his VP to run in 4 years
Joe Biden has selected Kamala Harris as his running mate
Great choice!! Biden/Harris 2020!
This guy endorses Biden and all y‚Äôall still worship him? If Donald trump is racist wtf is joe Biden lmao. This world is truly in Satans hands
Democratic party just trying to get the black vote and women vote. Even though Biden repeatedly degrades the black community and he likes to touch little kids. #BidenIsARacist #pedobiden
Seriously?  She is a net drag cause ppl assume they are voting for her as the next POTUS.  Mods still will probably vote for Biden but this was a terrible pick.
Me at work when Biden announced his VP
They wanted to run against Bernie so bad. It's like they already had some of the statements in a template. Trying to paint Biden and Harris as some kind of super-left ticket just isn't credible. It sounds ridiculous.
Picking a cop to be your running-mate in 2020 has got to be the greatest example that Biden is senile which I have ever seen
Most of the Twitter polls were heavily in her favor. Biden listened, and did the right thing to help him win.
kamala being vp is proof of biden‚Äôs tokenization of black women. i sure didn‚Äôt need proof, but this sets it in stone; he wants someone who looks progressive but won‚Äôt challenge his centrist politics. triumph of aesthetics over policy.

Tactically, if they want to maximize impact and reverse Trump policies they should hire a lawyer not a politician. But, umm... they might just be down to maintain most of the status quo but put a softer face on it. Not like Biden's time at VP was a heyday of conservation.
You're dreaming if you think Biden isn't running for re-election in 2024 if he wins this year. There's no up side in not using the incumbency advantage to keep the GOP out of the White House.

I would have liked to hear you again, but I'm not surprised. After all, the DNC establishment ran Biden just to stop Bernie. They don't want to change anything.
Biden can win this election by appealing to Progressives &amp; sure up his support within Black &amp; Brown communities which are the base of the Democratic Party. He doen‚Äôt need to appeal to Republicans. If they‚Äôre as ashamed of Trump as they say, they would do they right thing anyway.

Its not Harris.  I judge Biden to be more in control than the right believes, less scared of black voters than the left believes, and more stubborn and bullheaded than anyone believes.  He's gonna pick the one he wants
Trump gets blamed for Covid.  Down ballot Ds get it for this.  Biden has had some decent statements.  Not as many rank and file

Maybe he knows something about Biden's VP pick. Smells like an unfair assessment, though.
Joe Biden will be HIS VP

This is depressing! Vote for Joe Biden! Pass the word! Get out the vote! Vote out that orange lardass Trump! Trump is a Russian traitor!
And besides we basically hot an inanimate object in Biden so I would hope we got a VP pick who could at least prop him up once in a while to do something useful.
So then you do give a fuck. Well so do most people and for some of them the vp pick is going to be a factor into Biden earning their votes. We can't just vote Trump out and go back to the same conditions that led to his election. Also Biden could straight up die so important.
This thing is won with big D turnout (which will happen either way) and flipping burbs.  She'll seal the deal.  When I talk to Rs they acknowledge that but say Biden won't pick her.  Might even be deflating for them.  Its so freaking obvious she is the choice

To be clear I'm riding with Biden under the circumstances despite all those who claim I'm faking it or aomething.  Whovever he picks Im in. But Im telling you, others won't do the same.
Biden IS NOT going to pick the lady who basically called him a racist on national TV.  Not. Gonna. Happen.  He is old and less pragmatic and can't stomach the possibility of working with such a devious person for 4 years.  He doesn't trust her.  He and BO trusted each other

Don't worry, they love Biden and his son. Lol
What I think would be the smartest move (though he won't do it and it would be maaaaaybe somewhat risky) would be for Biden to work towards finding the most moderate Republican he can, or a Republican who has just been a thorn to Trump, to try and snag the moderates.
I hope it stays that way.  As you know I have my doubts.  If Biden is able to make some progress, I think it holds off the growing D Soc wing a while longer
"Joe Biden is unfit to be President and Joe Biden is a racist. Joe Biden has the mind-set of a plantation owner." -Leo TerrellNo one cares about Hunter Biden. You are killing people with your sabotage of the Postal Service. You are killing people with your disdain for us concerning the corona virus and the economy. Not to mention what you are doing to the children and elderly. You are evil.
People can say nasty things about Trump and his family. But now actress are making sure you can't say a bad thing about Harris. She is not fit to be vice president as Biden is not fit to be president.
So he‚Äôs going to be voting for Biden/Harris then?
You obviously haven‚Äôt seen unbiased polls then. You act like Biden is better than Trump.
You‚Äôre holding that one thing over her entire idealogy. Why not hold pedophilia over Biden‚Äôs head in the same way you criticize a woman with a PhD?
That‚Äôs all you can say? So let‚Äôs reflect on how Trump is literally racist and Biden‚Äôs campaign team is exploiting a black woman to gain more votes. What do you have to say to that? A quote from Biden, ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt vote for me, you ain‚Äôt black‚Äù. Is that NOT racism?
If you have done your research, you would know that is false. You‚Äôre 17. You‚Äôre literally just throwing your opinion out there without facts to back it up. I‚Äôm sure your parents are voting for Biden so you just hopped on the train so you could act more mature.
Biden‚Äôs campaign team was lowkey exploiting the BLM movement when they chose a black female to be his VP.... a quote from Biden, ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt vote for me, you ain‚Äôt black.‚Äù How does that make you feel?
Biden and Trump are pleasing boomers. Dr. Jo Jorgenson has proved that she is more interested in modern issues. My vote will reflect my morals. My morals do not support racism or pedophilia.
Biden will likely be sitting in a comfortable recliner with a drool cup in hand. Harris, and the energetic far left collectivists will be calling the shots. Cultural disintegration, corroding The Constitution is ongoing. Like the paint on your car peeling, exposed to rusting.

At $50,000/month, it would take Hunter Biden 225 YEARS to earn what Jared and Ivanka made last year ($135 million) doing who knows what for who knows who.

I haven't decided whether I'm going to vote for Biden yet. If anyone ever needed proof that this entire system we're living under is irreparably broken, it's the fact that the choice we're given is between two shambling, racist, sex offender corpses.
This is what happens "voting for the lesser of two evils." Biden is to appeal to old white men to get Trump votes while Harris is to get Hillary, Obama, and Police voters, and get fewer of any. Trump promises a conservative SCOTUS for another 50 years and gets all the KAGs.
Besides how depressing it is for Biden‚Äôs victims, what the Reade story exposed is useful for the future. Democrats will abandon every stated value they have in the name of preserving austerity and standing with corporate donors
If I were Biden, I‚Äôd ask you to be AG, not HUD Sec., although you do have experience defending tenants‚Äô rights &amp; your story about housing is compelling. I just think you‚Äôd make an excellent AG because of your passion &amp; knowledge about justice. You‚Äôre valuable in the Senate, too.
Hillary was 3% ahead of Trump in 2016 and she won the popular vote. Biden is 13% against Trump. How does that reflect in the 2020 government? That gives 71 seats in the Senate. The majority in Congress will be the largest since FDR. Trump gets 78 of 540 electoral votes.
Also Biden is on record saying he doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea to hold previous presidents legally accountable. So don‚Äôt count on anything happening to Trump. In 8 years they‚Äôll rehabilitate his image just like they‚Äôre doing with Bush now
People assume so much about Biden that they really shouldn‚Äôt. He‚Äôs still subservient to capital and its holders and they won‚Äôt allow him to refund it if they want to privatize it. The democrats want it privatized too, they‚Äôre just putting on a show because it‚Äôs affecting election
Harris and Biden are gonna sing an edited version of the ‚ÄúCan I have a peppermint?‚Äù Tik Tok song I‚Äôm calling it now.
You have to ask yourself, why is Biden/Kamala using a UN slogan for their slogan?
That's what we have been counting on. Surprising to see the GOP advertising for Biden, but Trump is pretty bad, so I guess it makes sense.
Voting won‚Äôt change anything other than the leader, but it will get him out and that‚Äôs what we need. After that we put pressure on Biden and Harris to move further left.
Don‚Äôt say ‚Äújust vote regardless of who for!!!‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt help get Trump out of office. Our country and the world is depending on us to get this insane dictator out of office, tell people to vote for Biden if you‚Äôre gonna advocate for voting.
Once the Chief Justice swears in Biden, trump is no longer president.  Send in DC PD, cuff him, and take him to NY for prosecution of voter fraud.
Even the more mathematically conservative  aggregated averages such as 538 have a 1 point uptick for Biden of late
Tf you talking about? Bernie people were trying to get people to stop caring about twitter but the snake emojis and Pete memes were latched onto by media in their efforts to sink him. Pod Save are losers who helped hurt Bernie‚Äôs campaign while Biden got millions in free media
Same here. Biden is going to get 70% of the electoral votes in Washington
Of course we have to be calling out our leaders. Biden sucks... but I think conditions might be better than the "mad-maxian" ones Trump is dead  set on creating. I want to live long enough to see if humanity figures it out before it's too late.
Are you voting Biden? I might vote Green Party since Washington will give their electoral votes to uncle joe anyway.
Yet the Biden ‚Äúrallies‚Äù get covered in full and live. You‚Äôre not smart are you?
Vote Green Party! Our state will vote for Biden regardless and all the politicians in the coming years must adopt Green Party legislation to save the planet.
I mean: make a case for Biden because he is stomping his feet like a spoiled toddler when it comes to supporting policy that would actually help people and get him votes. If you want to defeat Trump improve Biden because he is shit right now
Vote for Biden anyway. People's lives are at stake.
Most candidates run to the center in the general election. Biden is moving left.  via
Great ad- w/a few edits Biden could use it effectively. I‚Äôm unsure how I feel about that play-on-JFK quote at the end. We‚Äôre in battle with a ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs in it for me‚Äù culture personified by Trump and the GOP, it‚Äôs how we got here. Not sure I buy into implicitly endorsing the idea.
Trump is just so threatened by Biden/Harris!  It‚Äôs called insecure üòü!
BWAH HAHA HAAA! Unscientific?? Mr. Bleach Man who said it would disappear by Easter?!?! Trump calls Biden's coronavirus plan unscientific, rejects call for U.S. mask mandate
When Trump was faced with a decision he didnt follow the science, he followed miracle cures offered on Fox. Biden Will Follow The Best Scientific Advice. Not some witch doctor who thinks demon seed is a thing.
Vote for Biden. Trump is destroying the whole world.

we‚Äôre literally gonna be stuck with either trump or biden so may as well pick the one that‚Äôs not a fascist and who doesn‚Äôt think corona is a hoax ? Lmfaooo
Lmao people attacking ‚Äòvote blue no matter who‚Äô as though it‚Äôs a general rule that we all are gonna keep saying in every election forever &amp; as though we actually like biden like nahh it‚Äôs literally just for this election üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I think Joe Biden is gonna be a fine president what y‚Äôall talking about ????
There‚Äôs three ways post-Biden election plays out: 1) Kamala as Pres (neoliberal reign for 4-8 more years) 2) an actual honest-to-god socialist President (the best scenario) 3) an evil Republican far scarier than Donald J Trump
Biden isn't too far off of that. He and his cop will pursue anarchists with more fervor than the baffoon Trump will. You need to start working on turning Biden into a passable candidate. Quit vote shaming. Nobody owes a vote to anybody else.
if joe biden becomes president it‚Äôs boutta be woodrow wilson pt 2
Life is feeling very chaotic atm. Did 2 things: Donated to Biden/Harris Reached out to schedule an appt with mental health counselor. #MentalHealthMatters #dontletthedarknesswinagain
Look how many voters the democrats are swaying with moderate Joe Biden!
Kamala could beat you without Biden. Mind dwarf.
I think for a lot of people that the idea that "they think things will change this time" is wrong. I think people are looking for a greater sense of stability right now. They have minimum expectations of Biden, but assume they might survive him.
Like Biden did yesterday you mean?
Thank you, Julia! This and the Supreme Court appointments should silence ANY ridiculous purity B.S. from progressive complainers turning their backs on Biden/Harris. This is why it is imperative that we bring back Civics 101 beginning in grade school.
BIDEN IS LITERALLY A FUCKING REPUBLICAN.
And now: *Harris a cop *Biden is a racist, dementia-riddled rapist *Trump is a racist, dementia-riddled rapist *Pence needs to be electrocuted *Execute everyone in Epstein's book *Execute Breonna Taylor's murderers *criminalize racist judges *criminalize willful misinformation
You represent hope for a return to ethical government. You and Joe Biden wiill repair our world leadership. I am not religious, but I pray to God that you will prevail.
A vote for Biden/Harris is a vote for the party of Bloomberg and Kasich, Steve Schmidt and Rick Wilson.   If you‚Äôre a lefty and you‚Äôre response to this starts with ‚Äúbut Trump‚Äù you fail to see what brought us Trump in the first place.
I can‚Äôt see anything Biden does or can do to change my mind... Trump 2020
Say what you want about Biden, but he said nothing will fundamentally changed and he delivered üò§
Interesting you put the impetus on the voter and not on the candidate. Weird logic. Maybe tell Biden to adopt things that 80% of voters want
Does Biden try to delegitimize scientists? Does he deny climate change? Would he actively try to dismantle environmental regulations? Does he openly stoke the fires of white supremacy? Would he ignore medical professionals in the middle of a pandemic?
Pretty dumb move. Biden has only ignored us and actually sought to not include what we, the majority of voters, are asking for. Go get your boy and tell him to stop trying to lose.
I meant if it's stated as tit for tat, it give legs to their Hunter Biden memes. (But I acknowledge those PR rules as to what gives a story legs are all shot the pieces now). So, hold each Trump/Kushner accountable for their own feeding at the public trough!  Yes.
Hell yea Biden rollin to Electric Avenue

when you gleefully promote Biden working from his basement as an attack, it makes you sound like GOP stooges. I fear you are. Your political reporting is trash far to often.
Actually no. Hillary was ahead 3 points. Biden is ahead 12 points. Even Trump's polling has him behind 11 points

Thank you, Joe Biden, for choosing Kamala Harris as your running mate.  Now we have a fighting, winning team.  Let us all fight together to save our people and to save our democracy.  To borrow a Revolutionary War slogan:  everyone HOLD FAST!
I am excited that Joe Biden chose you as his running mate.  I know that you and Biden will fight for our people, our democracy and our Constitution.  I will fight with you.
If Biden wins, get ready for Trump to punish America
Rescued again by Joe Biden!
Fabulous!!                           Harris just showed why Biden chose her
Not all Biden supporters are warmongers and racists.   But they all decided warmongering and racism weren‚Äôt deal breakers for them.
Theres nothing to be proud of. You‚Äôre too cowardly to make a hard but necessary choice, thats all this is. Biden sucks but Trump is exponentially worse, we cannot risk 4 more years of this shit
You can call it vote bullying if you like. The point still stands. Its a wasted vote, and attitudes like this are whats going to land us with 4 more years of Trump. Biden sucks, but its pretty asinine to pretend he is anywhere near as bad as trump
Jesus do your research or get a new job. Her view on health care has evolved and she is now 200% behind Biden‚Äôs plan to expand Obamacare NOT  go with Medicare for all got that?  -I did your job for you now speak the truth !!!
"It was a party that claimed to adhere to the Constitution and the rule of law. No Republican leader today abides by these tenets."
i know he sucks but please for the love of everything vote for biden, i dont want another 4 years of this carrot lookin ass toddler‚Äôs bullshit
Seriously who cares at this point. Trump is raging against the dying of the empire, Biden is useless nostalgia for better times while we‚Äôre collectively euthanized. Any change will come from outside the democrats
waiting for the day biden slips up and calls kamala harris barack
I just followed you, now we're just waiting for the screw-ups, ahem, controversies, that are bound to happen with the Biden-Harris ticket.
The context of that edit of WAP to have Biden and Kamala in the video given the touching in the video (not weird on its own) and Biden‚Äôs actual behavior towards women (deeply weird) is Not Good Folks. Liberals are brain diseased for sure
Vote for Biden instead of Chuck Schumer?
So I'm streaming it now and let Biden speak just to hear what is different, and just found it hilarious he has to go back 3 years to Charlottesville to talk about racism. Motherfucker we in the streets today for the same shit
The left-wing is going to need to apply constant pressure to a Biden-Harris presidency (protests, organizing, local level elections, etc). Biden-Harris will not want to move left but we have to force them to do so.
Send proof of Biden being compassionate. Like acting in a compassionate way.
I didn't want to vote for Hillary and the electoral college makes my vote (Blue state) essentially null. I'm voting this year for Biden/Harris to make a statement to Republicans that they need to do better and to make sure Trump doesn't contest the election.

ma‚Äôam we all realize that it sucks but we literally have no choice right now ?? we either get trump or biden and trump is the one leading america towards being a fascist regime
went into an anxious &amp; dissociative episode at the grocery store yesterday after Biden‚Äôs announcement this moment in time is pure misery
You must have memory holed the Obama years completely because republicans gained so much ground between intentional compromises and taking everything back  the midterms. Meanwhile Biden says he‚Äôs gonna compromise again

I'm not voting for Biden. That doesn't mean I support Trump. Any more than not voting for Trump is a vote for Biden. Wtf... math dude
What good would voting for Biden do, versus watching the DNC finally burn? What message is more important? Trump can't do much without congress. If we elect Biden, they will screw us over again in 2024, at least til 2028, and then how many will die in wars and bs in the meantime?

No. Not voting for Trump. I'm not voting for Biden. You didn't read my comment.
Is this a pro-Biden account? I'm not voting for Trump, but I have yet to see you call Biden out on any of his BS.
Joe Biden is racist. He wrote the crime bill. Until he made these recent concessions. I don't trust him. I'm NOT voting for Trump. Also, I'm not sure it's worth continuing to enable the DNC and all of their BS while they continue to play us.
The way I see it is we only have two real options currently and it‚Äôs either Biden and her or trump and who the fuck is going to pick trump
She‚Äôs super problematic and I don‚Äôt know what the Biden people and the DNC knows that we don‚Äôt about why they think she‚Äôll help the ticket...? Maybe Tulsi was living on island time and missed the Zoom call...
It‚Äôs gonna be just like 2016 I think - liberals going in insanely sure and overconfident and then incredulous when tons of people stay home out of disillusionment, combined with the types of voter suppression they helped normalize during the primary. Idk anyone excited for Biden
if trump wins again he could very well end up turning america into a dictatorship and finding a way to stay in control even after 2024 and that‚Äôs absolutely terrifying, at least with biden we know we‚Äôd only have to deal with him for 4 years
Biden is a Jack Kennedy kind of Catholic- he is loyal to America
WHEN TRUMP GETS ELECTED AGAIN I DONT WANT TO SEE A SINGLE FUCKING PERSON WHO CHOOSES TO NOT VOTE FOR BIDEN COMPLAINING IT WILL BE Y‚ÄôALLS FAULT
lmfao we‚Äôre so screwed nobody is even realizing that we just NEED TRUMP OUT OF OFFICE YES BIDEN SUCKS TOO BUT HE‚ÄôS THE LESSER OF THE TWO EVILS OMFG
so has the whole of twitter basically just decided they‚Äôd rather have trump &amp; pence than biden &amp; kamala ..?
yes kamala harris is a terrible person &amp; we can acknowledge that while also understanding that voting for her &amp; biden is the only way to get Trump out of office üò≠üò≠
Kamala inherited Hillary‚Äôs foreign policy advisor Michelle Flournoy, who was going to be her defense secretary and will likely now be Biden‚Äôs  She founded Center for a New American Security which is full of Bush-era warmongers and funded by weapons manufacturers and oil companies
Why are you tryna get your constituents to vote for Biden tho?? I thought racism was your platform?
This election is seriouslyyyy not the election to do it. I really can‚Äôt risk trump winning again, the platform he‚Äôs given hate is just toooo much. Biden fucking sucks too but we need better ppl in the cabinet ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è plus idk if boycott would ever work, we need an outright revolution
Biden Whips It Out, Busts The Nutmeg.
Who knows if she‚Äôs even voting for them. She hasn‚Äôt said a single thing about Biden since she dropped out
Who will be Biden/Harris (Hillary‚Äôs) first victim nation if elected?  I think Venezuela. They‚Äôll do what Trump‚Äôs admin was thankfully too incompetent to do.

Pls don't wipe your ass with your vote by voting 3rd party because you don't like Trump OR Biden
I will begrudgingly vote for Biden but knowing that it won‚Äôt actually allow for change, not real change, just away from Trump and back to status quo is incredibly infuriating. And I‚Äôm white. I can‚Äôt even imagine how it is for people of color.
I‚Äôve seen so many black activists this evening talking about not voting because Biden/Harris are complicit in racism but also knowing in order to properly apply pressure through protests for actual change we need to vote in democrats. This is such a shitty situation.
My true motivation for this upcoming election is who won‚Äôt ensure climate catastrophe. I think it‚Äôs obvious who doesn‚Äôt care about science. So basically Biden/Harris not being hellbent to fuck the earth will get my vote but I‚Äôm no fanboy or even happy about it.

Biden has committed to choosing a woman as his running mate.
I‚Äôm so thrilled. I picked you as Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate months ago. I am so relieved that we have a chance against this evil.
Excellent choice, soon-to-be President Biden!
Imagine waking up in the first day of the Biden/Harris presidency. Its going to feel like bathing for the first time in 4 years. No vile, racist, Russian assets in the white house, all the human cockroaches scurrying back into the shadows after their horribleness has no home.

it‚Äôs hilarious how hard copmala went on biden just to be his running mate hahahahahahah identity politics are the wurst
Biden swore to a black female VP, and  couldn't provide the paperwork showing she is black. So she was never a real candidate for VP.
Joe Biden has picked a strong women as a running mate. Rumors abound Trump is looking for a new running mate. Mike Pence is trying a new look.
She was AG in 2016, man. I don't even want to argue about this but I'm really not sure where you're getting these points from. Biden doesn't support defund the police. It's pretty amazing to think 2 conservative dems are going to defund the police.
Kamala Harris will be the first Black woman nominated for vice president by a major party  via    Im very excited to support Biden and Harris!
Kamala Harris insinuated that Biden was racist on national television and he made her his running mate LMFAO
Agreed but I definitely feel confident with this lineup. If anything, they will capture the moderate vote while the popularity of Sanders and Warren among progressives will nudge Biden and Harris farther to the left.
With Biden being really old and covid going around, VP is way more important. Warren's wheelhouse is monetary policy. State dept is not where she would probably choose to be.
I can respect that I just would have preferred less cop worship. Biden already was talking about giving cops more money federally and this all feels on point for things going in the wrong direction.
With today's announcement of Biden/Harris, the trump administration officially enters its Lame Ass Duck Session.  #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Return compassion to the White House.  VOTE BIDEN/HARRIS November 3rd, 2020!
Yup. My main concern is if Biden wins, Kamala will likely be the nominee in 2024
Kamala Harris, the junior senator from California, has been picked as Joe Biden's running mate. Harris will be the third woman nominated as vice president on a major party ticket.
Glad Biden picked Kamala Harris, those California Electoral votes are critical.
I called Biden picking Kamala back after Bernie dropped out. Not shocked at all
What‚Äôs worse, trumps negligence killing thousands of Americans or Obama/Biden‚Äôs competence in killing millions around the world?
Yes, it goes without saying, but I‚Äôm fully on board with Biden/Harris 2020! Mostly because of Kamala Harris! When will there be merch?

Alright. I'm officially ready to be disappointed by Biden's VP pick.
He's got a number of paths forward. If he debates Biden face to face it's over.
I wouldn't say it's "in the bag" however he has a better chance than the left is giving him credit for. He's got a number of accomplishments under his belt and Biden clearly has signs of mental decline.
first of all i can complain about establishment dems all the fuck i want and second of all biden promised a black woman/poc as his vp and if he doesnt deliver its just another example of politicians lying to get what they want
I‚Äôve suggested this before, let me ask it as a question ‚Äî  Why hasn‚Äôt Biden considered one or more INDIGENOUS women as his VP ‚Äúpick‚Äù (to the best of available evidence)? #Biden #Biden2020 #BidenVP
Yang stopped being relevant the moment he bent the knee for Biden and took the gig on CNN. He'll get exactly what Warren got for selling out, nothing.
Ranks right up there with the idea that "the voters" picked Joe Biden.
Georgia Poll:  Biden 46% (+2) Trump 44%
Meeting with Joe Biden. What's the mystery?
I know this election isn‚Äôt life or death for you, self described lawyer/writer/mom. You‚Äôre working from home or raising your kids. I‚Äôm among the 30 million unemployed who don‚Äôt have healthcare and see a demagogue in Trump and then Biden saying ‚Äúnothing will fundamentally change‚Äù
This idea that the only people who are not excited or unenthusiastic w Biden being privileged is super ridiculous. The people who‚Äôve been most angry w Trump has been wealthy educated liberals. Most of every demographic under 50 didn‚Äôt vote for Biden among democrats
I‚Äôm not voting for him, but if I was choosing between Biden and Trump, foreign policy comes first.
Not at all. And it sucks I wish I could find a single reason to get excited about Joe Biden the kids in cages + mass deportations started under Obama/Biden, why would they end when he‚Äôs back? I‚Äôm still not gonna have healthcare. I believe the path forward is not at the ballot box
2016 did matter, and I voted for Hilary. America is in terminal decline, Trump is in denial about it, Joe Biden wants us all to pretend it‚Äôs 2010 again while it burns. The election matters, im just altogether checked out, not because im privileged but bc i don‚Äôt have delusions
Like Biden did in the 90s?
And Biden supposedly is the one with cognitive issues?
One thing I want to be really clear about ahead of time is that while I may or may not lambaste Biden for picking a less-than-progressive choice who thus does not meet the demands of the moment, I will not be criticizing any of the women for having been chosen.
And his kid has issues with Biden being out of it.
But seriously, keep pushing the biden narrative. It‚Äôs actually v helpful for us sweetie ;) Thanks for looking at my profile, I‚Äôm flattered!!
Must appreciate Trump signing the First Step Act in contrast to Biden‚Äôs crime bill.
I won‚Äôt be voting for Biden then, as he is compromised by donors
Ok best of luck to you and those who support Biden. I hope he loses, but if he wins I will not deny the legitimacy of his win, I won‚Äôt make up a fake claim that he was a Russian agent and try to get him impeached over bullshit, and I won‚Äôt #resist like a fucking spoilt child.
Honest to God, if the governors race in 2024 was Jenny Durkan vs Tim Sheldon, I would probably abstain. There is also a 100% chance I'm voting for Biden in November.
Depressingly on point
Damn when the NYT has to acknowledge reality to push back on antifa, you know the polling for Biden must be starting to deteriorate due to the chaos caused by the Dems armed wing....
‚ÄúThere will probably be books written on what that says about Americans and gender in U.S. politics, but there just isn't the same disdain for Biden that there was for Clinton.‚Äù
Truth. I have donated to the Biden campaign twice now. Both times via   co-events. By design. I know I‚Äôm not the only one ‚Äòvoting‚Äô with my $$.  for Veep!
The SCO prosecuting Flynn was all Dems ostensibly led by a senile RINO (Weismann was the de facto leader and he was going to host a Biden fund raiser), but enjoy your alternative reality...

We need everyone to vote for Biden in states like Florida, Texas, Arizona,etc.  Trump HAS to be removed. By not voting for Biden, you're saying trump is doing fine--he's acceptable.  I want better than Biden too. I'm willing to start w/Biden &amp; then get the best person in 4 years.
I didn't say you weren't voting.  I live in the beautiful state of Washington where I'm surrounded by intelligent people.  I'm not concerned about Washington picking Biden.  Florida on the other hand is a zoo--more karen's per square mile than any other state.  Please vote Biden
Right now trump HAS to be removed.  We'll start with Biden &amp; get a better person in the white house in the future.  If you dont vote for Biden you're basically saying trump in office is acceptable.  You're saying this dangerous full of hate monster sack of shit is good enough.
When I see these Biden videos all I can think of is  !

What if Biden nominated Ivana Trump as his VP?   (not ivanKa, the first wife, Ivana)
He may have said that publicly but he didn't even know he had to contact the Commission for Presidential Debates at first. Trump thought requests were sent to him. He made a fool of himself saying Biden wouldn't debate him when the commission was waiting for a response from him.
Nice way to try to curcumferentially marginalize Kanye while overtly criticizing Trump. All this while wearing blinders to Biden‚Äôs mentation deficiencies.

But covering it fairly or misrepresenting facts and twisting it to look as though trump is bad and it was all Biden's doing, I'll never trust the msm ever again
Such lies and deceit. You'd rather go backwards with fake Biden and even more fake Harris
Ummm socialism and government regulations are left, capitalism and not interfering is right. So Medicare for all is left, Biden said that's much government involvement, where does that put Biden? ü§∑
Then you're voting for a fraud, who is Indian and Jamaican, not African American, called Biden out for his racism not long ago, and literally had ancestors who owned slaves to which there are records proving it. Way to set us all back.

Oh shit you got us, guess we will vote for Biden now, not like those pics are photoshopped, taken out of context, and literally shows a father spending time with his daughter. You're delusional.
As crooked as she is, she got a way to become the President, if Biden wins, without any votes. All she has to do is invoke the 25th Amend. against Biden which she will succeed and then becomes the first Minority Female President without even an Election.
I said it in another tweet, if Biden wins, and I am sure we won't let that happen, she's going to push for the 25th Amen. in order to be President without being elected, she ran for the office and failed. This will be her chance to get in the office. Remember her threat.
People wake up, seeing Harris is now have been nominated as the VP for Biden and what she has said concerning us AS WELL as Biden, if Biden wins she will push for the enactment of the 25th A against Biden thus forcing him out of office to make her President w/o being elected.

My friends are calling me Larrydamus. Through all the twists and turns I said it was gonna be Biden/Harris since spring 2019. Today‚Äôs lucky numbers are 6, 18 and 52.
I don't necessarily appreciate this follow up.  I was asking for clarification.  And I sure hope Biden can win but that is absolutely not clear, especially evidenced by Trump winning as a non "front-runner" in 2016.  Thought it was obvious polls don't really mean much anymore.
Joe Biden picked the VP with the hardest name for Trump to pronounce. #kamala
Congratulations I believe you will succeed as being the first black American vice president Joe Biden has made an excellent choice let‚Äôs get this country back together again !
I think that is a product of the breathless media. Yes...Biden has changed the timeline. But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs for drama. He knows the importance of this choice and wants to get it right. Just my take on it.
UT county how could you elect the liberal  You have to question the mental stability of anyone that would support dementia Creepy Joe Biden. Vote Tanner out of office.  #TRUMP2020 #KAG2020LandslideVictory
Why New Gun Owners Should Fear A Joe Biden Presidency
With the way that 2020 is going, Biden's VP pick is gonna be either George W. Bush or the reanimated cadaver of Ronald Regan.
Biden VP pick: Susan Rice, the diplomat  and lightning rod  Susan looks sharp... Capable..and the logical choice.. As for kamala. AG is her thing
While it's improbable, it would be so fucking funny if Biden actually chose Pete as his VP.
So good ole sleepy Joe is saying low income people are criminals. Think about that ... Minn. group that saw $$ surge, some from Biden staffers, bailed out alleged violent criminals: report
We're not given any worthwhile candidates.  Out of a country of over 300 million people, are we supposed to believe that Trump and Biden are the best we can do?
One constituency Biden has is the black vote. If he chooses a white woman instead, will will lose the black vote and perhaps replaced by that white woman candidate who cannot beat Trump
Everyone pretty much knows Biden (age 77 now, 78 upon inauguration) will be a one-termer and will be the wedge for his VP to become the 47th president.  That's why he needs to think long and hard about who it's going to be.
I'm fairly certain that all the voters who would be influenced by a bully mocking a disabled reporter, for instance, are so firmly in the Trump camp it would be impossible to pry them out by the sight of Biden one-upping him with his own monkey show. We're going for independents.

Susan Rice Sells Netflix Shares as Biden VP Pick Speculation Heats Up  via
The greatest Biden virtue is his honestly and authenticity plus he has charismaIf people start wearing trump and Biden masks. Ima lose it.
No... Bernie hasn‚Äôt got one bill or any legislation passed in his name. The party hasn‚Äôt totally gone over to the far left. Biden is a moderate and that‚Äôs why black people overwhemingly voted for him and not Warren or Bernie. She‚Äôll tow the line.
Your absolutely right. Last year Biden was a rapist and a racist in her eyes but when she needs him he‚Äôs a great guy!
Also why don‚Äôt we let black people speak for themselves on this.  Looks like most black voters disagree with your view if rasicm and who is rasict
No doubt rascists come on all shapes and sizes.  I doubt your rasict family voted for a black president or that they would vote for Biden and Kamalla.   I guess their hero‚Äôs have turned on them.
Resign Trump! Forever the assassination of that little 5 year old boy is you failed to mention is now on YOU! Why you being so stupid? All you had to do was mention the little boy!!! WHY OH WHY didn't you say a national prayer for him? I don't care if Biden wins now. You're done!
I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôd piss people off with what I‚Äôm about to say, if I had a Twitter following:  Fuck Donald Trump. Fuck Joe Biden. Fuck Pence and his homophobia. Fuck Kamala Harris. Fuck Sean Hannity. Fuck Rush. Fuck Betsy DeVoss. Most of all, fuck all of us. #fuckpolitics
Is she saying she hopes Biden will stay alive until November or she Hopes they can do mail in ballots so they can rig the election
I have decided to stop following the White House and Press Secretary and what ever that thing is  until we get a real President and Vice President in Biden and Harris.  This ass wipe is not going to break the will of the American People!!!
I bet Biden knows how to pronounce our national parks.
Personally I think we‚Äôre looking at just that. There are no good candidates. What Trump has going for him is that he‚Äôs the evil we know.  Biden is a moron and Harris had already shown Shek Day or do anything to further her political aspirations. Everything is scary.
If you really want to get down to the brass tacks as to why Trump is president it's because of the candidate they put up again. Had it been anybody but Hillary Trump would not have won. Blame the DNC for why Trump is in office. And they very likely did it again with Biden.
I will still pay attention but if Biden is president I won't open Twitter every morning scared of what I'm about to read. And that I'm very much looking forward to.
Why does the virus have to be gone by election day in order for Biden to win? I don't follow your logic.
Republicans can no longer debate ideas so they lie about about birth certificates, emails, Biden's health, and now this garbage. Once upon a time we were the party of ideas.
Biden doesn‚Äôt speak out of both sides of his mouth. He is an American patriot. The village idiot lies 24/7 and his kkkult sucks it up. Vote üó≥ blue. End the lies.
Come on, Mr. Biden voted to invade Iraq, I‚Äôm afraid he would be more like Mr. Roosevelt, than Mr. Chamberlain.
It's hilarious how hard Fox and right wing media is trying to paint the most moderate ticket since LBJ as radicals. I mean, you can't get more down the middle moderate than Biden and Harris.
. being his VP selection makes me feel much better about Joe Biden potentially being president. We gotta get Tumps donkey ass out no matter what but I definitely didn‚Äôt want to jump from the frying pan into the fire üî•
So my take on this is that both candidates seek to be President but Trump is relaxing on the train letting others do the work as he coasts along in his comfortable life, while Biden is labouring and doing all the work himself without the glamour and comfort... Trump own goal!

You know what I‚Äôm worried about now? All of these buttheads who are SO against Biden/Harris that they either don‚Äôt vote or vote for someone else and Tr*mp wins. Again. The same way he did last time. Everyone just needs to fucking suck it up so we can make progress. #BidenHarris
Right up until inauguration day when Biden rattles off some bullshit about ‚Äúhealing the nation‚Äù and ‚Äúcoming together‚Äù and let‚Äôs all of these assholes off the hook, just like the Bush, Reagan and Nixon criminal organizations before them.
Still gonna vote for Biden/Harris but we need to know what she‚Äôs about just as much as Biden.   We cannot allow this to go unknown.   Also I‚Äôm really tired of everyone seeing this and going ‚Äúwell are you gonna vote for Tr*mp then?‚Äù No! Get your head out of your ass.
#HannityForBiden   After letting, even encouraging, Trump to make a total fool of himself in this interview, it's clear that Hannity is now working for Biden. Keep up the good work!
Joe Biden really helped write the 3 strlikes law........... but holding my vote would be ignorant too. What in the entire fuck ü§¶üèæ
That said Biden/Harris is still a better choice than, well, whatever is left of the failed trump administration. Just so tone deaf to have her as vp after months of protests against police brutality and an unfair justice system
You got an inside scoop on Biden getting Epsteined or something?
So now you guys want the debates?? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ If they can debate, then so can Trump and Biden.
They both agree Biden sexually assaulted women
settle for biden settle for biden settle for biden settle for biden settle for biden settle for biden settle for biden settle for biden  any other vote is a vote for trump so please  settle for biden
settle for biden???
So Biden finally announces his VP pick and it's  He absolutely could have done worse. She's certainly going to steer him in the right direction.   Now let's get out the vote and kick the orange idiot out of office! #resist #BlueWave2020 #BlackLivesMatter
The enthusiasm I‚Äôm seeing for Harris is making me smile.  Where do I get my Biden/Harris sign and bumper stickers??
Well, this is true!  Biden/Harris!
Holy Shit. Be Realistic Biden/Harris agruable worst than Trump #NeverBiden #HawkinsWalker2020
Lol  everyone who thinks Biden actually had a choice for his VP
Half white and hate Biden's racist ass and half Asian and hate Kamala's cop ass. Kamala is a historic moment for Asians like Margret Thatcher was a historic moment for women.
...  No matter how nasty Kamala was during the debates and Kavanagh,   Joe Biden forgives her cause her hair smells so good!
What do you think? Will Biden jump another 5 points in the polls?
Same. However, I feel there are many qualified women who are going to hold important leadership roles within the Biden-Harris White House. Excited for the change.
The Biden campaign was all but dead until it went to South Carolina. There, black people propped up his campaign which Y‚Äôall( Republicans) can‚Äôt have it both ways. We didn‚Äôt vote overwhelmingly for Kamala just because she‚Äôs black. Now she‚Äôs VP candidate, we gonna vote for Biden?
3-4 would be fine but will we even have 1? Joe Biden is so far left we will be living in a socialist economy something the founders would definitely not be pleased with.
Moderate???  You spelled "Far Left" wrong. And I wonder if she still thinks Biden is racist??
But you know. Black ain‚Äôt black with Biden.
I know that it seems hard to believe that I have received from him. But with the presidential election going on this year in America. I ended up voting for Joe Biden for president of the United States!
Joe Biden really just picked missblowsalot to be his vp? Lol
This just in joe Biden announces his replacement
So happy Biden chose you. It is time to ROCK the world and kick Trump and his administration to the curb.
I fully expect you to take a role of great responsibility in the Biden cabinet.
Does the Kamala Harris pick sway any voters who weren't already voting for Biden?
We got this, America! Congratulations to Kamala‚Äî Biden and Kamala 2020!
Kamala was the obvious choice 6 months ago, and I‚Äôm glad that Biden didn‚Äôt overthink it.

I think the VP choice is Biden's to make. He has to work with her.
The real important difference? Look at how small Biden's hands and feet are!
Yah? Australia is about to be ran right over by China! And president Biden won't help you out either!
Same kind of promises the USA Dems make to negroes and other minorities ahead of every election. Promisses they always break! Joe Biden already broke a big promise, and he isn't even elected yet. He failed to name his VP last week. Trump has kept EVERY single promise. Trudeau?lol
Biden supporters = racists
If she loves her husband, Jill Biden needs to step in and throw in the towel.
Did Putin OK it?  Sad that you lost your moral compass. Going after Biden with Russian intell.
I‚Äôm sure if Biden gets elected the will be absolutely 0 racist people. None, there were none before Trump so...
It's getting very sad at this point. When will the person who promised to be with him forever (Jill Biden) finally step in and take care of her husband??
Vote Joe Biden to be a racists pedophile..
"BIDEN IS GONNA TAKE OUR GUNS!"  Bitch they said Obama was too!!! Yet here I am, still locked and loaded.   Congress ain't organized enough to vote on anything.
Trump says Biden will "hurt God". Think about that. Trump is saying God is so weak, so vulnerable, that a lone Democrat can defeat him. That's not the God I believe in. How about you?
And you brought along Trump the Heretic. Trump said Biden would "hurt God". Clearly, Trump views God as weak, vulnerable, able to be beaten by a mere mortal. Is that how YOU view God? Do you agree with Trump that God is impotent? Why do you associate with a non-believer?
Trump said Biden would "hurt God". Clearly, Trump thinks God is weak, vulnerable, able to be beaten by a common mortal. Trumps' God is apparently a loser. Trump said so.
Think about it, Obama would most likely have a spot in Biden‚Äôs presidency. If he wanted it. üòÄ
He would probably be a better president than Biden. At least he can say a complete sentenceEspecially now that the mailman union has endorsed Biden. They cannot be trusted to handle a large number of ballots.
Thank God Biden didn't choose you for VP. Fuck Trump, but Snowden also absolutely deserves a pardon. Those two things can both be true.
His name is Dopey Don!!  If Trump is going to call Biden,  then we are calling Trump Dopey Don?!
Um. Biden and Harris are Christians
I find 170,000 dead Americans more interesting. Stop worrying about Hunter Biden and DO YOUR JOB.
Whats sad is how you believe that and cant provide any backing of your own in the slightest on how trump is bad. trump is the best thing thats ever happened to this country. At least i provided proof on why Biden sucks. Also, jorgenson is for abortion so no thanks.

You = Propaganda   I said PROGRESSIVES are turning their back on BOTH Trump and Biden.  Progressives have specific policy goals. Old black voters were tricked into thinking Biden was a safer bet against Trump, young black voters saw through the Neoliberal brainwashing.
Well I happen to know DOZENS of Black Voter who aren't interested in Biden OR Kamala.  You don't represent all of them.
Americans are very unenthusiastic about
Not as much as it SHOULD hurt Biden, is the answer.   The marginal differences between Trump and Biden become more marginal EVERY day!
If you want me to delve into the video parts of biden saying RACIST comments and not just falling into dementia such as provided before, then i can. Just say the word right after youve supplied the ones about Trump you claim exist.
"Joe Biden loses train of thought, forgets what he was saying"
I love when he says "if not, vote for the other Biden." He meant Trump lol.
"Joe Biden forgets where he is then laughs it off"
"Joe Biden cant remember his own name"
"Joe Biden cant remember what he was just saying"
"Joe Biden cant remember the Declaration of Independence"
"Joe Biden cant remember where he is, swears he isnt going nuts"
"Joe Biden forgets what office he is running for"
"Joe Biden loses train of thought, forgets what he was saying"
These are all very short (less than a minute) video clips i have sent you, so dont worry about them being fake articles, its biden speaking himself. Wont take long to watch and hear for yourself bidens own words.
I think Joe Biden did eat expired, unrefrigerated sushi prepared in the hospital's COVID ward by a homeless meth addict...that might explain a lot.
when you support Biden and you're a spider?
Yep and their names are Biden/Harris 2020! You done Matty Pants McDrunkface, you done! #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #RepublicansAreDestroyingAmerica #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
But, is it a fair bargain?
I‚Äôm gonna make a strong, good faith effort to ensure this doesn‚Äôt happen, and I hope you will too, but there are somethings we need to discuss in case Biden/Harris loses.
Terrified. Biden could of chosen Miss Piggy and you idiots would be giddy with excitement.
Ha! Don‚Äôt worry, I won‚Äôt be voting for Biden. Great bit of voter outreach there.
Biden/Harris don't WANT to #EarnMyVote.  Period.   I am laser focused on policy and voting records--both are absolutely abysmal on every fundamental level.
Here's a fool who thinks Progressives ruined Hillary Clinton in 2016 and will ruin Joe Biden in 2020.  Wrong. Those politicians failed/will fail based on their own merits.  Face it dude: Biden/Harris should be on the REPUBLICAN ticket!
Biden &amp; Harris will change things üíØ
If Biden manages to when with all of these dirty tactics that  is directing #postmastergeneralDeJoy to take. Can  fire him when he becomes the 46th President? This is #VoterSuppression
Another BS deep state sponsored editorial trying to pass as journalism.
Even though Biden doesn't check all your boxes, his agenda benefits the majority of the people. The main thing is to get Trump out. He's destroying our nation. I'd vote for a rock as long as it got him the hell out of there!!
Such an easy call. Biden is so stupid on this issue.
Sorry hon, this is a reach. Biden is doing exactly nothing to reach out to Latinos and that sure af includes Harris.
So how do you explain that Joe Biden is a practicing Catholic and the VP will be carrying out his vision of the country.  I am Catholic and I do not believe in abortion.  I believe that Joe Biden believes the same as I do.  Trump does not go to church or believe in saving lives.
But the more important point is the overwhelming evidence presented showed that President Trump did it: He wrongfully conditioned military assistance to Ukraine on a commitment to announce an investigation into Joe Biden.
Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Marco Rubio (R- Fla.) were the first out of the block to explain that the president is guilty but shouldn‚Äôt be ousted for it.
Should - Vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Does this need explaining?
Here‚Äôs some stuff we shouldn‚Äôt be doing and some stuff we should do re: the Biden/Harris ticket:
Each sign costs $600,000!?  I assume only Biden and Kamala bought them ü§£
You're running scared, Mr Trump. You're so befuddled by the Biden-Harris ticket, that you're inventing the most absurd lies and rewriting history. Per usual, you are spouting one lie after another, embarrassing yourself and the GOP nearly every time you open your mouth.
This is a set up. In the next week or two Joe Biden will have an health issue or be Hilleried, while this is happening Kamala will be by his side ( acting like the loyal friend). Then the Democrats will bow their heads in remorse and Kamala runs for  President.
Taking a 1 tweet break from posting shit about Biden to bring you something wholesome.

New post (Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate for November presidential election) has been published on Covid-19 News Info -
There's an endless list of things I'd rather do than watch Joe Biden and Kamala Harris speak together.  Near the top are: chewing shards of broken glass, performing my own colonoscopy, having long conversations with foreign telemarketers, and licking fresh bat guano.
I really want to believe in Biden/Harris I really do. But
God Biden is a boring speaker
The two party system will never die if people like us who don't support it don't vote it out. In current polls, Jo Jorgensen is only about 4% behind Trump. Biden is losing drastically in most polls. If you're a Bernie supporter, why not vote Jo?
Off you go to the Comrades 4 Biden gulag.
I can't stop shitting on Biden! It just keeps coming OUT OH GOD!!!
BREAKING: Biden determined to stop the spread of Communism in North Vietnam.
When she did that to Biden it sank her campaign.
We have a level of income inequality that makes democracy unsustainable. I am suppose to believe that Biden, Harris, Pelosi and Schumer are going to reverse their lives work, alienate their donors and do that?
This  and  double-stack is the best thing I've seen yet today. Side note/true story: Biden picking Harris won me a burger and fries.
I don‚Äôt get the same feeling now, Biden just doesn‚Äôt inspire loathing the way Clinton did. But I do feel that a lot of people feel they are being ignored and written off. And that can‚Äôt be good
Are you daft? She believes Biden is guilty of the sexual accusations against him yet she is now his running mate.
WAKE UP.  I just totally got that Biden and Harris are a political joke in a bad way. It's all BS smoke and mirrors.  It isn't us against them.  It's us against whoever wants to make us all slaves.  They hate trump because he loves this country and is fighting for OUR freedom.
THIS MAKES ZERO SENSE and sinister.  Why would dems have Biden and Harris?  Because maybe ?! Someone wants this country weak for a takeover??  It's a nagging unease that someone's pulling the wool over constituents eyes to use them for ulterior purposes.  Know what I mean??
I‚Äôm voting for Trump/Pence over the Biden/Harris alternative. And, Tom. . . nobody who supports the party of the abortion death-cult gets to assess the morality of anyone. Ever.
According to the ongoing narrative, Joe Biden (simultaneous evil mastermind and aging dotard) has picked Kamala Harris (at once a cop and anarcho-syndicalist coming to take our guns) to enact their evil plan of turning all of America into Seattle.  Plus, they hate each other. /1
It does make for an interesting narrative wherein Joe Biden (simultaneous evil genius and aging dotard) has selected as his running mate Kamala Harris (simultaneously a cop, and Bernie Sanders who will install a communist anarchic dictatorship).  Oh, and they hate each other.
I mean I really don't see Biden sending out the fucking gestapo to kidnap civilians using their right to protest so
Biden/Harris 2020: Sniff and Blow.
Well, I find this thread very interesting. I completely agree that the people need to continue in mass movements for there to be change. But I find it sadly cynical to attribute no admirable values and virtues to Biden and Harris.
She‚Äôs not running for president, hello! Remember it‚Äôs #Biden? #TrumpIsACompleteFailure #TrumpHatesWomen
Is getting chosen for VP so unimportant that you get called on the phone and the nomination sent in a text? How special?! Or is it that Biden can't be trusted to talk in person because he's tanking fast?
The news stations are interviewing East Indian women who are crying over their success at having another Indian woman running with Biden ??  A bit confusing.
Why are the news stations having women politicians of East Indian descent weeping with joy over their triumph at having an Indian woman running with Biden?
Great, can hardly wait for Trump to send the next stimulus so I can donate it to Biden/Harris 2020
Problem is...that's the best pitch Joe Biden has right now.
Hey so a lot of folks are saying it‚Äôs tone deaf for Biden to pick California‚Äôs top cop as VP in the light of the BLM movement‚Äôs call to defund... but I actually think it‚Äôs a formal fuck you! The DNC isn‚Äôt blind to the movement - they hate it.
Biden/Harris: Where dead and Red intersect
YES YES YES!! Happy Day! Our country needs to heal from Trump and the Biden/Harris ticket can do that. Joy! üòä

Wall Street is celebrating Harris I have not heard Biden or Harris in a wealth tax. Nothing

I'm not a huge fan of either. I will be voting for them, though. Harris is just as establishment as Biden is but i think she will help him with voter turn out.
She whiffed the Kavanough hearings and when she attacked Biden it sunk her campaign so I don‚Äôt think the ‚Äúfighter‚Äù thing is your best play here except for feels.  Also, prison labor
No, I think that's Hunter. This is the dead one, who for some reason is why we can't have medicare.

Fuck Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Ima vote for em... but fuck em.

Let's be honest, Biden could have picked a dead Christmas tree for VP and I'd still be voting for him.
Tears of joy!!!!!!  Biden/Harris 2020
Dude, that ‚Äòhiding in the basement‚Äô is so played out. Biden can ride a bicycle, walk and chew gum at the same time, think and speak coherently. Trump cannot drink a glass of water with one hand, walk down a ramp, tie his own shoes, wipe his own butt, nor can he pronounce Yosemite
Solid tweet. Will not be voting for Biden.
Are they going to form a human shield around her to protect her from the sniffing groper Biden?
Well Biden‚Äôs brains are pretty much gone
A vote for Biden is a vote against the fucking gestapo and a vote for Grandma being able to have SSI income. It probably isn't much but it's better than nothing.
When is Biden naming his VP candidate??
The VP choice is going to be the actual POTUS. Biden is in rapid decline, and is incapable of executing the duties of the office.

Meh. Hillary didn‚Äôt lose because of Russia. If Biden loses it won‚Äôt be because of Russia. Am I supposed to be viscerally outraged that China is working against Trump? I‚Äôm not
I am sure the Republicans will be happy to let President Biden do the same?  Right?
i‚Äôm saying that while biden isn‚Äôt in the right, trump most definitely isn‚Äôt either so this isn‚Äôt something to critique
so i‚Äôm not saying that biden‚Äôs thing right here is very good, but don‚Äôt act like trump is innocent either. elections are scummy, that‚Äôs just how it works
I don‚Äôt want Biden but Tara Reade is nonsense
But they are no longer on the list, correct? So am I to understand that you would support Biden if someone else with those qualifications for VP were on the list?
Because either way, y'all are going to say we can't elect Biden if he chooses Kamala, or if he chooses Rice. You'll find an excuse for putting in the worst president in history back in because you believe either one of the VP candidates nullifies Biden's chances.
, repeat after me. And you get extra points if you get it right. "Person, woman, man, camera, TV, President Biden".
Why haven‚Äôt Biden or his elder-abusing puppet masters cared about American manufacturing for the last 45 years? Explain that, will you?
China wants Biden - why would any American vote for him?
Marginally.  I promise you a year into his administration Biden's WH will look a lot like Trumps.  Full of Wall Street executives and warhawks.   At best you can say the Extremely Religious Right Wing won't have as much control.
It‚Äôs not illegal. Any United States citizen over the age of 35 can run for president. Kanye has the money and backing to do so. I don‚Äôt see that as cheating one bit. The Democrats are just whinning that it‚Äôll take votes away from Joe Biden. It will also take votes away from trump

Biden may have grown up in the Catholic church, but let me assure you he is not Catholic.  He is an unapologetic accessory to the murder of over 55,000,000 people.
If Biden is elected, the Administration will be full of vengeance. They will not tolerate "peaceful" protests, there will be camps/prisons for political dissidents. Once their revolution is complete, no more revolutions allowed. Thats how authoritarian gvmts roll.

Have some empathy for the marginalized and disenfranchised, please. We know if Biden wins you get to go back to brunch and not caring about politics, but for us if he wins‚Äîwhich I hope he does!‚Äîwe‚Äôll all still be out here fighting to make him give us more scraps.
I think people aren't taking it as a joke because he's also spending a lot of time recently telling people why they should vote Biden, no?
Vote for Biden and you will be voting in Socialism.
God save us if the Biden gets in. Can‚Äôt you see he has dementia. He‚Äôs not mentally  there .  He‚Äôll destroy our country.
Voting isn‚Äôt binary!!  Biden earn votes by supporting popular policies that help out the majority of voters... Medicare for all, ending wars, free college. Strengthening anti trust. Breaking up the banks...  A Trump win is the DEMOCRATIC parties fault. Never the voters..
The only real Democrat who ran for president ANTI-war and healthcare for PROFIT Tulsi Gabbard literally chewed her up and spit her out during the presidential debates and people are talking as if she can just fill in for Biden as if that is actually Democratic or actually a thing
Biden is not Trump ..wake up
I know right? At least your cousin and lifelong friend stuck with THE PLAN and let you "win" Poor Biden has to be told THE PLAN once every half hour ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
You guys heard of the fine people hoax? Biden kicked off his campaign with that lie yesterday.
We are going to need the rounds for the civil war the Left will start if Trump wins. If Biden wins, we'll need them for Betos confiscation plan. Not for mass shootings, but for the revolution you folks seem to want.
Very important to understand this. Not voting for Biden or not voting at all is the same as voting for Trump.  Make no mistake: every single one of Trump's followers will be voting for him in November.  #VoteOutTheGOP
Voting for Biden and Harris does not mean they are perfect. It is simply what needs to be done. Accountability will still be held.
People who say that voting for Biden is the same thing as voting for Trump are trying to convince you not to vote... which is the same thing as voting for Trump. Our enemies are still hard at work interfering in our elections.
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate
If Biden manages to win despite all of Trump's overt sabotage of basic voting processes, the Dems' response better not be "See? Our democracy works!".
Biden will hire "The Lone Ranger" to enforce his mandate.  Who was that unmasked man? I've got a silver bullet for him.
I was just thinking about what Trump said about all suburban housewives will vote for him he never mentioned that before Camilla Harris was nominated as vice president to Joe Biden. This is a very racist tweet saying that suburban housewives don't like black Americans. We 1)üëá
Not just the questions, h already destroyed everything Biden has said! haha
This is great. No debate will be required; every stupid thing Biden says, Trump can just call a press conference and pick it apart!  LOL   Joe can't take questions because he doesn't even know what he is saying!
Yes, and we need to work on ensuring certain senators don‚Äôt win. If we don‚Äôt take the Senate then even with the presidency Biden and Harris will have a hell of a time getting things done that need to get done because of what Trump has done to our country. Dems need it all back.
Well it looks like your dreams have just turned to nightmares! You might as well start now saying hello to President Biden and to vice president Harris
Oh-the words of a scared man, Biden and Harris, they are the chain to bed and you can‚Äôt do it! So tell me are your nails still intact or have you Bitten them them off yet
You are an awful governor. Please stop using Washingtonians lives for your Biden administration audition. I think they get that you are anti Constititional Republic, free-range leftist radical.
Imagine voting for Biden &amp; Harris ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Person: 1 tweet about how bad Trump is, 50 tweets about how bad Biden/Harris are.  Same Person: Upset that people think they don't want Biden to beat Trump.
Living in Seattle metro, King County... is there even a point voting for Biden?  Feels like pissing in an ocean of piss and saying that you helped.
Trump WILL destroy this country. WILL kill millions of people. And may well do even more.  Biden/Harris, well, we don't know what they'll do, but the odds of it being WORSE than Trump are slim, so I'll take them.
So as a public servant, performing the will of the governed, that means thousands of people were contacting him to do this? Naw, his days are spent auditioning for Biden administration. He needs to check a few boxes at WA states expense.
Biden will defer. He'll get run over on day one.
7 times Kamala Harris effortlessly proved just how incompetent Trump really is
After learning more about Harris, I'm legitimately getting pissed off. The problem is, we don't have a choice. We have terrible options, but we need to stop dividing the vote. Any vote not for Biden is a vote for Trump. I hate it. We cannot survive another Trump term.
My stance is very dependent on where I am. This is a rock solid, unshakeable blue state. Biden WILL win. My vote has zero impact on the actual election. Therefore, my vote is not a forced choice, it's an endorsement. And I STRONGLY feel none of the 3 options deserve that.
Biden literally doesn't even support legalizing marijuana, and Kama'lock-em-up Harris built an entire career out of throwing innocent people in prison for victimless crimes
I see no compelling reason to vote for either. Biden/Harris is an absolutely atrocious pair I agree with on *nothing,* and Jorgensen/Cohen is an absolutely pathetic, laughable ticket of completely unqualified nobodies with zero credibility (not to mention Jo is cringe af)
There is no chance of Biden losing Washington. My vote is not relevant to the outcome of the election and is not a case of harm reduction or forced preference, it's a case of making a normative endorsement of a particular candidate/ticket
So was she born in the US? Because Biden wont survive and we don't need another illegal president.
what if you have people in your life that feel the exact truth but about Gates or Biden?
Sorry folks it‚Äôs been taken down off her twitter and is no longer there.  So I can‚Äôt prove. I saw the video myself and was impressed. Well if someone recorded it, they will post it.  No poof- but I remember her saying is ‚ÄúBiden is an old man, an old racist‚Äù.
Otherwise I could say that Joe Biden  sniffed a unicorn + actually was part of Corn Pops gang, I have the photos!  Btw I‚Äôd like to see Trump saying that it was a cesspool. All the leader elites knew of the Island, on both sides of the aisle! Knowing of it doesn‚Äôt mean complicit.
Kamala Harris you are adored!!  Biden a good man.  Our ticket is hot!
To all the "apples to oranges" people out there:  Obama and Biden didn't downplay Ebola, call it a hoax, or tell us that it would magically disappear - they did their jobs.  Trump can't handle a crisis because he's mentally impaired.  That's why we have 165K+ dead from #COVID19.
I‚Äôm a suburban wife and mother and I would walk across broken glass on my hands and knees to vote for Biden and Harris.
Would be just as accurate if biden went to antifa site.
I hear he‚Äôs been spending a lot of money trying to fight this virus. And is in the background trying to help with the Biden campaign. So don‚Äôt be so ready to judge people. If you don‚Äôt know the answer don‚Äôt ask the question.
It‚Äôs just ignorance. I hope people don‚Äôt get into arguments about this shit with these people. Don‚Äôt waste your time. It‚Äôs like arguing with Trump. Spend time on lifting up Biden and Harris.
Hoping Biden holds the independent voters until after the election.
Senator Kamala Harris has campaigned for climate justice and stood up to the NRA. Her selection to Vice President Biden‚Äôs ticket is the right choice for this moment in our history; I‚Äôm looking forward to what‚Äôs to come and proud to support her.
If you‚Äôre talking down on Biden/Harris then all you‚Äôre doing is supporting/helping trump ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I love Kamala!  She gave me chills listening to her. She‚Äôs absolutely the right pick!  GO BIDEN HARRIS!  I‚Äôm going to now donate.
I am really enjoying listening to Biden and Harris without the noise of applause and screaming from the audience. It's very peaceful and calming and informative
As November approaches, you're going to notice more and more accounts claiming to be leftists who will try to encourage you not to vote. Not voting for Biden or not voting at all is the same as voting for Trump.  #ElectionInterference is constant.
Harris is unmoored in her ambition, unmoored meaning zero scruples in what she will do to further Kamala Harris. And she will be the prez as Biden will exit soon after the election. She is radical, angry, and wants power.
Gonna tell my kids this was Joe Biden's running mate
No, the premise of your question is faulty. There is no evidence to believe that Biden will behave the same way as Trump. No evidence that Biden will continue the process of destroying the country and attempting to turn it into a right-wing authoritarian dictatorship.
...oh Sorry this one is of Biden speaking as a racist. People can change, so I look for that hasn't he just doubled down?  I'm still looking for the one I saw of Kalama calling him out after the debates outside of building of brick, in front of doorway.
Bernie supporters were happy to say ‚Äúto hell with Bernie‚Äù after he endorsed Biden &amp; was unable to get him to move meaningfully left. Shocked the pundits who thought he was a ‚Äúcult leader‚Äù, but we were never a cult of personality (great track CM Punk forever) but a cult of policy.
White "leftists" going on and on about how they can't morally vote for Biden.
You and Bernie was my dream ticket, but Ill take you and Biden over The Pumpkin and The Pence any day. Can't wait for VP Debate #VoteBidenHarris2020
If Biden had picked a white dude as his running mate, would we be going all in exploring his ethnicity like people seem to be doing with Harris?
Why have I seen zero campaigning by Biden? By this time in the Obama campaign people were composing songs. Do you really all think Trump is going to lose? Did you notice that you were sure he was going to lose last time?
- excellent piece on   and bravo to Joe Biden.  Her long and dedicated career ‚Äúfor the people‚Äù &amp; yes she will be a wonderful VP and Klobuchar‚Äôs analogy of the NASA‚Äôs women beautifully depicted in ‚ÄúHidden Figures‚Äù was spot on &amp; it‚Äôs VERY EXCITING
It is true, Biden confirms.
Bottom line is that I believe in her and her ideas and I'm happy that so many of them are being adopted by Biden. She has and will continue to work hard in the name of public service because she knows it's not about her. It's about us. She has my support in all she does.
It is okay to be excited about Kamala Harris. She has changed her tune about LGBTQ people in the last few years which is good. Doesn't mean she isn't problematic, just like Biden. Regardless both of them are significantly better than the garbage currently in the Oval Office.
Perfect is the enemy of the good. For marginalized people there's a huge difference between Trump/Pence v Biden/Harris. For privileged liberals maybe not so much.
I still haven't forgotten how Biden treated Anita Hill.   Moving forward doesn't mean anything is forgotten.   I'm still voting #BidenHarris2020 .
Thank you, Juan. And for those privileged lefties at Counterpunch and the like who want the perfect and the pure it's time for them to get on board because for marginalized people (not privileged people like them) there' a HUGE difference between Biden/Harris v Trump/Pence.
...If 45 loses, there's still the damage done: fires of hatred stoked into cultural conflagrations; how much we've hastened the destruction of a habitable world; how we've alienated allies &amp; become a global joke. We need more than Biden/Harris‚Äîwe need a love revolution. ...
Why the fuck did Biden pick a cop as his running mate? Is he trying to lose this election?
So Kamala's Biden's running mate, I'm not surprised, just disappointed.
As much as I've been stanning Warren since 2016, I fully support Harris on the ticket with Biden.  I will vote #BidenHarris2020  with a big smile on my face.   With a blue wave in the Senate, Warren can thrive and work to unfuck Trump's fuckery. I'd love her 2b next Sen Maj Ldr.
Watching season 2 of Alf and they are making references to Joe Biden running for President. It‚Äôs kind of cool that Alf was ahead of its time. #Alf
She is to the left of Biden, and can be ruthless, so I think she the brawler.
I just made my first political donation, ever. Plus, I bought a Biden/Harris t-shirt. Now I want to punch a Nazi right in the fucking throat.
Everyone‚Äôs frustrated and taking solace in others verbalizing it. Honestly anyone Biden might pick would prompt a similar torrent of bile (for similar reasons; this whole campaign has been Dems telling us to get bent).
Yes he‚Äôs given us hope.  A reason to smile. BIDEN HARRIS!
"Vote Blue No Matter Who" is literally the exact same kind of totalitarian rhetoric that got us in the CURRENT mess, especially given a Biden/Harris ticket with Pete Buttigieg on the cabinet is indistinguishable in policy terms from Bush/Cheney with Paul Wolfowitz on the cabinet
Biden is the worst recent candidate except for Trump and Hillary. We were screwed before we even voted last time and this time.
Exactly. Warren supporter that will vote Biden because it's the right thing to do even though I'm not a fan of him.
It's gonna be Biden or Trump. Biden is not ideal but there's nothing to think about. Very few could be worse than Trump...
The State Department is going to need some massive rebuilding. Also, sanctions on Russia and Saudi Arabia need to be harsh and comprehensive. I hope Biden and Harris make that a priority.
Both she and Biden make noises about police reform, but Biden has said he supports community policing, which actually increases the budget/scope of policing. We need to be moving the other direction. Here's hoping they listen to the Black organizers who are pushing for change!
The available choices for the positions in the Biden administration are just delicious.  Attny General, Secretary of Treasury, Speaker of the House, Senate Majority Leader.  Strategic decisions need to be ready to go at the time of the inauguration.
Literally no one is doing this. We are all fucking terrified, and actually dealing with REAL LIFE consequences of the current administration. We can‚Äôt afford to be fucking intellectual about this. A Biden/Harris vote buys us some time to start to heal. It doesn‚Äôt end the fight.
I can find way more pics of Dumb Don with Ghislane Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstien than Biden. #TRUMPLIVESONPEDOISLAND
That would work, too, I just think she's so good with legislation that she'd be perfect at getting the right bills on Biden's desk. I don't trust Schumer for that at all.
Dude, I was already going to vote Biden/Harris, you don't have to sell it so hard
Okay cool cool, Biden/Harris - these folx want our vote, and are a heck of a lot better than the other choice, obvi. Let's push them towards abolition in the next few months, huh?
So vote for Trump to guarantee that Biden/Harris don‚Äôt get elected.
I am not a big fan of either  Biden or Harris.  Do I think they can stomp tRump? You betcha. Do I think things will change dramatically? Yes &amp; no.  Do I think Gov't action will be more in alignment with my beliefs with them in office? Fvck yes!
Joe Biden didn't pick anyone. His handlers did.
Yeah, I caucused for Bernie in 2016, and canvassed for him this year. I definitely hope Biden wins! But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll actually change much more than tone, and comes with another likely problem‚Äîwhite people feel comfortable again and stop engaging in politics.
You're wise beyond your years CJ.  Kamala bends with the wind.  If Biden wins, Kamala will be POTUS in 3-weeks to 90 days, and that is why she is his running mate.
That's good once in a while. Its Hot in CT but its August so that's not news. Wait Biden picked a running mater.
I would have liked Kamala to choose Biden as the VP- but I will take this for sure.
Once Biden promised a black woman as his VP, it kind of had to be Harris. She was the only in-the-box choice (statewide officeholder), and Biden can't afford to go out of the box.
Biden will wipe the floor in a debate with you. It's no contest. Add in a Senator Harris debate against Pence? Cherry on top. ü§£ #BidenHarris2020
No, the tough choice is Biden and Kamala. I thought you were responding to my response to a poll by  asking which of the FOUR you‚Äôd prefer to be president. And even considering it a two option poll of JUST Biden &amp; Harris, I cant decide.
I‚Äôm a little surprised! Apparently she quit following the Biden campaign on Twitter a few days ago so I thought ‚Äúwhew, at least it‚Äôs not Kamala!‚Äù
Lets' do this. Biden/Harris 2020.
It‚Äôs the definition of harm reduction. All four of them are bad news for most Americans. Trump and Pence far worse, sure. But even considering Chris‚Äô post a two-option poll and to choose between Biden and Kamala is also a choice I struggle with. Both suck for their own reasons.
As many have chimed in, this is a very safe pick by Biden. A move that won't win him any new votes in the swing states but is certain not to cost him votes at the same time. This is a great ticket and can help get the voters out (thought Tim Kaine was such a Meh pick in 2016)
I hope Biden announces his whole cabinet.  Let's get the recovery effort underway.
Oh good, Biden picked the cop. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Does Biden know she is black?
Who's Biden and what team is he being traded to?
Biden's VP was the candidates we met along the way
Not sure how I ever wound up following this guy but I'm blocking him now.  Not voting for Biden is the same as voting for Trump.  Our enemies are going to focus their efforts on this disinformation tactic the closer we get to November.  Don't be a Dave. Don't buy into it.
When Joe Biden is President,we will

Is Biden being blackmailed? Black male leaders warn Biden ‚Äòwill lose‚Äô election if he doesn't name Black female running mate
Guarantee Trump will schedule a speech or press conference as soon as it looks like Biden is about to announce. It's like clockwork. Anything to distract and draw the spotlight back on him. The media needs to pledge to ignore it, whatever it is
Sen. Warren would make a perfect Attorney General in the Biden Presidency.
- Joe Biden can actually ride a bicycle - Donald Trump can't even walk down a ramp
Must be a naive Biden supporter.
I agree that Trump is much worse, and an existential threat to democracy. But that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs wrong to ask ‚Äúmy team‚Äù to stand for something helpful beyond ‚Äúnot as bad as trump‚Äù, yet so many of Biden‚Äôs biggest supporters say that even doing that is helping Trump. üôÑ
I tend to get attacked and see my fellow lefties get attacked for criticizing Biden and Dems with ‚Äúdo you WANT Trump to win?‚Äù or ‚Äúwe just have to have unity, no purity tests!‚Äù and the Venn Diagram of people who make fun of Trump‚Äôs appearance is basically just a circle.
- fascinating article about the bubble wrap artist Bradley Hart and what a phenomenal idea!  Beautiful colors, realistic renditions and surprisingly efficient and effective.  Great exploration piece on glamping - that‚Äôs my way of camping.  Nice piece on Biden too! Vote
Actually...maybe Joe Biden.
Biden is not moving left. Remember the mask thing we discussed earlier?
Biden doesn't give a f*ck about trans people; one is not better than the other. One of them is just putting on a mask, so to speak.
Through ,please vote for  Joe Biden .it's the only choice it's our best choice  He is everything a president should be. He is empathetic he is smart and bright and he loves America. He was a great vice president and he will make a great president that I have no doubt
Right  and deserve better to vote him out and into prison, and Joe Biden will get our country back to being the majestic, incredible country it once was before the dictator commandant took over the presidency illegally For our very lives that we preciously and painfully have gone
You mean like the one where Hillary was given the questions beforehand so she could study? The moderator has to be you, madame governor, or another honest person who won't help Biden find his podium.
Kamala, Susan, Val is my short list for VP choice. Regardless, I will vote for Joe Biden even if he chooses a rock for his VP...üíôüíôüíô
....and hopefully Biden's AG will get this idiot imprisoned.
But whoever he chooses, I‚Äôm STILL VOTING FOR JOE BIDEN!!!!üíôüíôüíô
- great discussion: the tactical mistake of Biden‚Äôs VP announcement &amp; marginalizing the position and making it appear that the most qualified will not be selected.  Agree-there are many qualified black women who don‚Äôt need that tokenism approach
Too bad you're in cahoots with Putin and Oligarchs and Ukrainian information about Biden stirred up by Guilliani. Your mentor would be ashamed of you Lenningrad Lindsey.
Biden should pick Trump as his running mate, then tell Trump he has to step down because he can't run for VP while also being President. 50% chance Trump falls for it.
Let‚Äôs see. Having debate with spouse over Biden‚Äôs plan. I‚Äôm all for lowering/capping/removing student loans but also agree in forgiveness, if possible.
#SettleForBiden...let‚Äôs face it, we hoped for #BernieSanders and his honest background, but we must go with the MOST progressive candidate. Right now it‚Äôs Biden, but if Trump happens to make student loans 0% interest...well, we‚Äôll see.
Even this morons wife ,Kim Kardashian,said that Kanye is mentally Disturbed. sadly,Trump is throwing money at him,and using him  to cause Biden to lose votes ..someone in this family needs to step in and get  him some much needed help,and stop him from making him a bigger fool
Don't let this keep happening because of the Commandant ,heir Trump. We have already had one Holocaust.never again?!? Is again Don't vote for this ignorant, ignoramus.please  Vote for Biden ,he loves America,has empathy.and will make this country great ,once again
There is no way Biden can get away without debating Trump!  I see what is going on because I have clarity and truth within me.  Thank you Tucker... Thank you for reporting the Truth with sardonic wit sprinkled in!
With a presidential candidate like Biden it's quiet obvious why you would believe that.
Remember when Americans decided who the president would be?realDonaldTrump: #CovFeFe #ShitFlingingOrangeMacaque Can you believe this jerk is our President? #StateOfTheUniom #PresidentPussyAssBitch #talibanTrumpIf Obama did this, they would speak of nothing else. Biden could NEVER do it!
India would have supported Bernie/Tulsi  if he/she was contender 4 democratic party, I think trump will tear biden in upcoming presidential debates, we should stay neutral, and hope trump regain his post, otherwise our MEA really have 2 work hard bcoz biden is Pak supporter
What‚Äôs the Biden brigade?
Till Biden confronts Erdogan and calls him out on his support for ISIS with the help of Europe and allies, most of the diplomatic pressures will likely not work on Erdogan. ISIS connection must be pursued and be brought to international justice.
A friend pointed out that given Biden's political history, he's not innocuous and perfectly palatable like chicken. But he's *still* a clear and unquestionable choice over a plate of shit.
realDonaldTrump: If Obama did this, they would speak of nothing else. Biden could NEVER do it!
I think Joe Biden and the Obama Administration national security team disagrees with you on this one. Also, the Russian people since Snowden further empowered Putin to increase his surveillance of them.
Biden will lose at least 95% of his support if he doesn‚Äôt hold the Trump administration accountable for its crimes.

Biden's Catholic faith: Campaign ads vs reality
I think Obama got a big honeymoon. We knew he had to go after the banks (&amp; Co.) while it was possible but he refused. Some of us tried to get congress to push harder but to no avail. Biden must not get so much runway. Agreed.
This care package and the entire election is the ultimate 'fuck them kids' üòÜ -- Biden is riding with Boomers to take him home. Hate to see it.
Good on you for diving in to put your time where your mouth is. I respect your ethics. I'm only hoping to show you that voting for Biden can be both far from ideal and ethical in light of the foreclosure of possibilities in the alternative.
Where was 45 at John McCain's service? Where was 45 at John Lewis's service? Oh please - Biden will but 45 won't acknowledge it. See the difference now one has empathy one doesn't. "It is was it is".....45
Jason does want Trump to win. Too many Bernie supporters are now supporting Biden. By reminding us that we can't trust centrists like him, Jason hopes to drive us away from Biden, so he can again blame Bernie supporters for Trump's victory.
They bully and shame. But they don't give any substantive reason based on policy to vote for Biden over Trump.
I will give you my insight into this election so that prosperity can judge if I am hearing from God or not. Biden will be swapped out post convention. I don't know for sure who, but I am leaning towards Michelle Obama. Kamala may be the co-pilot, she can't debate Trump.
Biden and Harris will kill it!!!
Trump to speak near Biden's hometown on the night he is expected to accept the Democratic nomination
Healthcare will determine the outcome of this election. If we do not have any public option during a Pandemic, Biden will lose the support from the Progressive Left, many of whom may surrender by election time, given the stakes. We need Medicare for All. Period.
Welcome aboard the pirate ship. I hope we can convince you to vote Biden. You might want to follow as well as Mike.
Biden‚Äôs family is too busy with pay to play. Family of grifters abusing American trust. His entire extended family is corrupt.
---  Nobody believes you care about any of that shit. If you did, you wouldn't be cool handing Trump more years of power. Fauxgressives are Trump flunkies, quislings &amp; alt-right bigots. Nobody is fooled by this feckless ass twitter campaign tho. Everyone is voting Biden.  ---
This must make you feel good and harden denial of the reality (a) this is not 2016 (b) neither Biden nor Harris is for defunding police and (c) there are not enough racist or nativist votes to scrape so (d) Trump is going down in a landslide come November #BidenHarris2020
Why does every constitutional issue need to go to the Supreme Court these days? Can't people read? "Natural born citizens" cannot be anchor babies.  is not a natural born citizen. Biden works for the Ukrainian mafia. Neither can serve as President. #BigMike
Report reveals Obama-Biden relationship not as close as media portrayal | Conservative Institute
Many people do not want Joe Biden over President Trump.  Your negation of millions of people who do not support your views is insulting at best. Show some facts as to how he is "dismantling" the Post Office, you do not seem to have any. Feelings are not facts, nor your opinionsü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The majority of those voting  support him because 'he's not Trump," according to a new poll.
Biden picked Harris on 8/11, this poll was conducted between 8/9-12.   Did they check her favorability before she was picked?
Americans will do what they have to do to get rid of trump. That includes dropping absentee ballots into an official drop box, early voting, or even getting in line on Election Day (if need be) to vote for Biden/Harris!
And the  will continue to skate on "not being X (R-USA)" until we actually stop going along with their hype and hold them accountable to their claims and promises.  Hillary had no ideas.  Biden has no ideas.  Harris has no ideas.  But at last they aren't Trump, I guess.
OH it's 100% true.  Trump's weakness has always been women.  However, we're more concerned with RESULTS than your little fake purity tests and empty virtue signaling.  Biden = no results = 40 years.  Trump = HUGE results = 3 years.

LOL Biden doesn‚Äôt do interviews. They all try to get him on and the campaign won‚Äôt let him.
My favorite Biden policy is Bombing doctors without borders hospitals in the middle east, killing innocent people desperately seeking help, is actually really just 3D chess: we'll understand the wisdom of the move much further down the line.

Completely agree. With the questionable stance of the Trump admin, it‚Äôs been a longtime fear of a ‚ÄúNATO Test‚Äù by Moscow. The next few months will be pivotal. Restoration of stability and order will come with a Biden administration. #BidenHarris2020
Biden is complete trash when you look at his history, but he's no wannabe dictator. That gives the disenfranchised a fighting chance. That shit matters.
Biden would revive JCPOA. Iranians would be fools to offer Trump a breather   via

This is going to be a super important discussion on  and disability. Harris was the first candidate to release a disability policy (Biden was the last) but she also made many unforced errors with straws and mental health. #CripTheVote is a valuable resource
Ride that Blue Wave!
With the Dems running #JimCrowJoe for pres, there's really no need for Trump to steal it. Biden can lose it legitimately. He  won't get my vote, and I know I'm not the only Black person who rejects Joe Biden completely.
Yes, we do, President Biden!
I wouldn't say its more inspiring... but its definitely "here we go again..." I like how Dr. Cornel West described Biden-Harris: "A slow-moving disaster" ... sigh.
This was a genetically engineered virus.  Engineered to scare a society into submission. It worked as planned. If Biden wins we will see more of this in the future to control our movement &amp; behavior. Slow Joe Hiden Biden wasn‚Äôt selected candidate,he was chosen by the dep state
Just make sure she knows that Biden/Harris don't give a damn about us Pakistanis. You can vote out of fear for a dangerous President, but don't kid yourselves into thinking that Pakistani Americans are represented under this ticket. Be honest. Be honest for God's sake.

This is a small preview of things to come! Democrats planned this so they could frighten average Americans into believing this is Trumps America. This is not, this is America under threat of domestic terrorism. Do it their way or suffer. A vote for Biden will destroy peace 4ever!

After the nonsens Biden said about Turkey and Erdogan I will vote Trump !
I am more afraid of Biden/Harris than I am of a nuclear bomb.
You are so correct. The left are crumbling they just don't realize it yet.  Did you see my post about 3 minutes ago. About Biden's handlers. Let me know I can send to you.
It was attacked at the time.  You can certainly argue the voters should have paid more attention at the time.  What penalty are you looking for?  I certainly will back your call for Biden to NOT use that type of rhetoric again.
Biden signed it tho. Also said you ain‚Äôt blacks if you don‚Äôt vote for him. Also said n word twice
So is Biden

President Trump will campaign in swing states such as Arizona and Pennsylvania during the week Joe Biden is nominated.
And so Putin can cheat with the voting machines and Trump will say there's a huge "silent majority" and that polls can't be trusted.   As he declares victory even though polls showed a Biden/Harris landslide and clear Electoral College win.
1.) To use it as a battering ram against Trump 2.) To use it to push tyrannical socialist policies  Some think corona tyranny will disappear if Joe Biden became pres. I disagree. I think the left has had a taste of this tyranny and will milk it as long as they can.

"The Biden-Harris ticket brings together two powerful candidates who represent a fusion between the traditional and the emerging America."
Why yes he did. Exhibit A
---  Biden beat Bernie's ass by 50+points in the last primaries before the mercy rule saved him. Biden essentially secured 75% of the electorate, to Bernie's 25% when it was a 1 on 1. So, 50 points + would be more accurate. Congrats? üòÇ  ---
Accused sexual predator == Joe Biden. Kamala Harris said quite clearly that she believes Joe Biden is a sexual assaulter and predator.  Kamala believes the accusers.

There being no other option is the exact problem. What power do we then have if we couldn‚Äôt even get the politician we wanted? Or even close to that! Biden was the most watered down stood-for-nothing candidate in the primary and now he‚Äôs who we have to rally behind?
Sigh, it was disgraceful rhetoric but it was also clearly a metaphor talking about an effect of bank deregulation.  I DO NOT defend Biden for that.  But nor is it something to hold an 8-yr grudge over.  You can't defend things Trump says every day that are more offensive

I agree with this üíØ. I think it would benefit the Biden campaign if he came out with the checklist of reforms he'd take on to codify the norms that Trump has been able to railroad. IT would be a strong message that appeals across party lines.

I'm sure Biden, Harris, and the leadership of the Democrats agree with you.
That‚Äôs my point. She wouldn‚Äôt have won but would have definitelly emerged as the heir apparent. Fortunately, Biden sees that and is positioning her for the presidency. This is America. Black women can do anything but getting one into that office requires someone opening the door.
I read this:  He doesn‚Äôt tell you the folks were being re- appointed meaning Bernie had approved them before   He explains what happened in a few instances but not all   What does this have to do with Biden
So glad Biden didn't choose Rice. Snowden showed us the illegal things the NSA was doing, he's a hero like the whistleblowers showing us the illegal things happening within the USPS and all the other crazy shit Trump is doing. #Whistleblowers
Image how sad we liberals will be if they help get Biden elected and just does the same corporate stuff. Crying in our lattes and the avocado toast will be bitter. Boy, that would be so sad. Hope they don‚Äôt help make that happen.  (Maybe some reverse psychology?)
Do you guys think Biden would actually run a second term? Harris is only 55 years old and would have the money and resources in a primary.
You keep bringing up Bernie Sanders.  Is this because you can't defend supporting Joe Biden?  And speaking of brown people Biden has done us more harm that a whole box of Trumps.
This is what Erdoƒüan needed. he should be grateful to Biden. This level of ignorance is really scary...
By comparison, the Pony Express took only 10 days to get a letter from one ocean to the other. It was soon replaced by even faster telegraphs. So forget vote by mail. Vote by Morse Code.  Say what you will about their political views, Biden/Harris will make America go again.
Just a quick question.  Did anyone who watched this #meidustouch video miss the fact that it was about the hypocricy of Fox condeming Biden for things that more accurately describes Trump and Pence?

She‚Äôs the presumptive Dem VP nominee. Biden is the presumptive Dem presidential nominee. They will accept their nominations at the Dem National Convention next week. You‚Äôd better brush up on the process.
Exposing Trump (again) as trying to cheat and steal the election NOW will help Biden/Dems fight any post elections shenanigans...particularly with some of the courts. Any Trump claims - Chinese interference! Ukraine! Voter fraud! - will have less than zero credibility.
For example, Trump wanted Ukraine to get him dirt on Biden... which is what Ron Johnson is trying to make hey out of... but it is failing no one cares b/c it‚Äôs so clearly bogus. Impeachment proceedings knee-caped the ‚Äúemails‚Äù type scandal he was hoping to use in 2020. 2/
I‚Äôve heard similar whispering to what‚Äôs reported here. ‚ÄòFixing‚Äô the ACA with a narrow bill would be an utterly insufficient health care response now.
And how many of NY‚Äôs finest died because Trump refused to get NY the ventilators and PPE they needed?  But it looks like NY‚Äôs finest can be stupid, too. ‚ÄúSo what if Trump‚Äôs idiocy killed a bunch of us? We‚Äôre too scared of Biden!‚Äù
He‚Äôs campaigning for Biden?
No, the problem is you're apparently okay with people dying ‚Äì luckily most of them won't look like you?  If you can't see the broken logic there you're in need of mental help ‚Äì which if Joe Biden supported #Medicare4All you'd be able to receive.

Or.... Trump sends a back channel message to Snowden and says if you don‚Äôt turn state‚Äôs evidence against Biden I will support your extradition. If you do I will pardon you. And here‚Äôs a little motivation.
Tom, you need to watch shadowgate documentary. You need to get in touch with the two whistleblowers that basicly testified to a lot of stuff that implicate Clinton, Brenan, Obama, Biden and so many more. You will understand why Clinton can‚Äôt testify. She didn‚Äôt wipe the server.

It's annoying how Biden runs for president twice, gets no votes, then with the imprimatur of ONE person gets transmogrified into a future president; then Biden finds ANOTHER person who got no votes and AGAIN the imprimatur of ONE person transmogrifies HER into a future president.

Narcissist at his finest narcissism
Corporatist Kamala Harris is a big donor sellout who is linked to the black profiling, police harassment culture. So this is a matter-antimatter choice. It could have been worse. Right-wing Joe Biden could've picked Sarah Palin. But "cop, woman, black" fit Joe's profile sheet.
There is no "silent majority" -- It's Trump advancing his excuse when he cheats to win, even though polls show a landslide victory for Biden.
I think this was the right choice for Biden. She's less vulnerable to right wing attacks than Warren (who'd be better in the cabinet imo). She can dance, snappy dresser. A little crazy. Malleable politics. Gets the base out.

Should Biden, Harris be worried about their pasts?
You don't like Biden's 1994 crime bill?   Well, Trump thinks white supremacists are "very fine people," thinks kneeling at football games is a crime, and tear gassed protestors for a photo-op in front of a church.
If Biden wins it won't matter -- he supports AB-5 nationwide.    California-only repeal would be moot.  üôÅ

A writer I usually like has displayed the kind of everyday sexism that kept any of the women who ran off the top of the ticket.  does not want Harris (a lawyer) to be lawyerly. He wants her to make him cry. (But he's not complaining!)
You all accustomed to daily press briefings where he dodges questions, talks in circles, &amp; performs for his base. This isn‚Äôt normal. Biden will answer questions because he will have to. But he will do it in his own time...and he will have something of substance to say
Sorry I didn‚Äôt respond more politely to get told to cry more. I‚Äôm also not the one who thinks candidates are responsible for everything their supporters say online, but biden does believe that or at least did when it came to Bernie in the primary. That‚Äôs his standard.
My social media is filled w progressive Dems who dedicate a lot of posts to trashing Biden/Harris.   They aren‚Äôt perfect. But the other option is DONALD TRUMP.  Why are you debating Harris‚Äô voting record &amp; not working to remove the guy who is literally trying to rig the election?
On reproductive rights: Conservative evangelical  whom I admire had me worried - until the last para. Says ok to disagree with as long as you respect religious institutions. So yes elect Biden the pluralist.

He can answer every question with ease. But if Trump is alienating voters on a daily basis with racist, sexist or just plain stupid comments, why should Biden divert attention from that story because it's the day for his weekly news conference?

You are detached from reality if you think Biden is a Sociopath, and if you consider yourself a humanist, then you MUST vote against Trump in 2020 and for the only candidate that can defeat him.  Or you are just a Russian troll.

20/ But the comparison does help clarify the choices that other countries and potentially a President Biden will need to make.
18/ This makes sense as part of the hawks "hedging against a Biden win" ( but more broadly as Pompeo preparing for a 2024 primary where Trump will not be in a position to play kingmaker.
16/ Still, why pay the price?  Maybe there is some sense that it puts Biden in an uncomfortable position of appearing to defend the end of the embargo when he defends the JCPOA, but even JCPOA opponents in the democratic caucus can manage the distinction:
11/ Why have they changed their minds?  Let's start with what does not explain it -- a worry about the arms embargo or Iranian arms commerce.  If you wanted to limit arms commerce with Iran, the last thing you'd do is waste leverage on this fool's errand:

Hum, maybe you shouldve stayed in the race  of giving it to Joe biden as part of a mockery of democracy that occurred.
Obama offered Hillary a key spot in his administration and their primary was certainly nastier than Biden and Sanders‚Äô. Sanders‚Äô decision to accept or decline is his own, but I hope Biden at least gives him the option if he wins.
If the Democrats don‚Äôt, though, Sanders could be more willing. This is probably his final term, and he would in all likelihood be spending his last four years in the minority‚Äîa very boring proposition. In that situation he‚Äôd be far more influential in Biden‚Äôs administration.
I was not a Bernie supporter in the primaries, but if Biden wins, Sanders deserves to be offered a meaningful role in his administration. Any win Biden has will be at least in part because Sanders has rallied his supporters‚Äîrather unwaveringly‚Äîbehind Biden.
Your ignorance &amp; lack of connection between your claims &amp; reality prove you have no idea that Trump is President. You claimed Biden rejected COVID stimulus when Biden holds no public office. You claimed Biden isn't progressive when his website is full of pro-choice receipts.

I‚Äôm telling everyone, Pelosi and Schumer are complicit in it all. They‚Äôd rather fundraise off of it for the next four years than actually pass meaningful legislation under Biden.Biden will do whatever the puppet masters want. His brains going.
Photographic PROOF provided was 2014 BEFORE Trump was Prez, so non-xenophobic Obama &amp; Biden did it to God‚Äôs children. Liberal fact checkers eating crow on it &amp; we HAVE Constitutional law immigrants pledge to follow. Sharia law is unconstitutional. Patriots, not white supremesists
Your backwards.  Biden is way better than Trump.
IT'S BEING SAID...AOC SHOULD RUN FOR PRESIDENT??? INSTEAD OF  SLEEPY. JOE  BIDEN???? I AGREE WITH YOUR  AGENDA.!!! OAC....AND  OTHER SUCH FOLK..?? WOULD  CREATE A  LANDSLIDE  WINN FOR  PRESIDENT TRUMP
Right, Biden was going to be anyone with breasts, damn the qualifications.  Brain cells are an endangered species on Fox News.
Talor who a such a baby little B and your music sucks. Yeah let's let Biden win so he can turn it into martial law. He is still cleaning the corrupt including cheaters out of the offices they have held too long. Try donating your salary to fix a statue like him or just shut up
One gaffe was a big one -- nearly a word-for-word speech which had been given previously by a British politician, but with no attribution -- plagiarized liberally.  Biden may had had it handed to him by a staffer, but... the buck had to stop on his desk at some point.
I'll be honest I watch and observe a lot of your tweets and on this one. Biden is not responsible for blm neither is trump at fault for this
'No One Will Be Safe in Biden's America': Trump Endorsed by NYPD Union
I am so grateful to have a candidate such as Joe Biden who is smart enough to stay silent. Just need to let his opponent keep lying and talking his way out of of reelection. Joe can remain silent until November 3 and easily win re-election.
The left: a third party vote or a write in is a vote for Trump! The right: a third party vote or a write in is a vote for Biden! Me: You are all stupid and need to take a civics class

Joe Biden Picked Apart For Reading From Script During Kamala Harris VP Call
When you have no policies to be able to promote as the Biden/Harris campaign, the corporate media will promote a weird Marge Simpson fights back narrative for you.
I was thinking this is Melania the first day after Donald leaves the White House in January after getting hammered by Biden!
If trump wasn‚Äôt working to steal the election is never want mail to be handled by corps like ups + fedex. We may have no other choice which is the only reason I‚Äôd encourage those companies to step in. If the usps was too far gone - then Biden can then reinstate the usps.
I'm not sure it would help Biden when Trump is basically doing Lisa Lampanelli's act for the last 8 years
It is kinda pure Democratic Party that they wanted people to vote in person during the primary at the peak of COVID bc it favored Biden voters but now that Trump is manipulating USPS to do it they are throwing a fit.

What moronic person says that? How can you begin to compare Biden to Trump? Trump was given the worlds best economy, which he took credit for (before he ruined it). He was given instructions on how to prevent a viral disaster (before he threw them away). Should we talk climate?
Joe Biden‚Äôs pick of Kamala Harris as his running mate is an exciting step forward. She has proven herself to be a fighter &amp; fearless leader in the Senate. Together, they will lead our country &amp; fight for us all. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve endorsed #BidenHarris2020 - let‚Äôs get to work!
Biden will be a good president.  He knows how to bring people together.  To get anything done on the Federal level u need someone who can work both sides of the isle.

Idk, i had no idea Biden has an unscalable wall on his property. Oh, it‚Äôs scalable? Ok, so he‚Äôs doing it more for personal use on his own property, and not as a deterrent against immigration to protect an entire fucking country. Maybe trump should invest in a moat as well, lol
Does Biden think he's President already?
I get real nervous when so many radical leftist seem to be promoting violence. Then when already Harris is acting like a dictator. Keep her out it is not about Biden. They will probably eliminate him quickly like they did JFK.

Biden Calls for National Outdoor Mask Mandate: 'Next Three Months at a Minimum'
No he doesn't. However, Biden is even worse.  The left is anti Messiah even more than the GOP.  That's why I stopped voting. I can't vote for Satan.
Biden is suffering cognitive progressive failure and it shows in his speach and also in his ability to even have something written for him. Pitiful Biden plagiarized Reagan for his VP announcement.
I‚Äôm not rooting for anyone. I‚Äôm not going to reward Joe Biden for a life of service dedicated to the oppression of my people. Trump is an idiot. Biden and his new whore are focused and determined to keep me at the bottom of society. I‚Äôll take my chances with Trump.
Why would anyone consider voting for Biden when his party is so afraid to have him speak in public? Doesn‚Äôt seem very transparent.

Now that Biden has his VP pick it is 100% clear that whoever wins this election, we are all losing. Big time.

Harris sways w whatever gets her power; ie, Biden's a racist/segregationist/believe his sex accusers 1 day. When made VP, Biden's 'my old friend'. She's a perfect usable POS f the left.

Absolutely. Trump is looking for loyalty only, trust isn‚Äôt important.   Biden is looking for integrity.
They should react horribly to this announcement. Her family owned slaves, she believes Biden‚Äôs accusers &amp; called him a Racist. You can‚Äôt make this stuff up. The hypocrisy of the Democratic Party knows no bounds.

People going on about how they didn't get their ideal candidate need to get real. The situation is -  Trump or Biden? Pence or Harris?  I didn't get who I wanted either, but I can easily answer those two questions regardless.

This new ad only points out the truth and puts a bow on top. It‚Äôs hard to see how anyone could think Biden is anything but a snake oil salesman. I am a bit surprised that he chose Harris with her new ‚ÄòJoker‚Äô face- as in the character from Batman.
That‚Äôs kinda how Biden got the job from  Obama. He had some good points on  Obama during the debates. And Biden turned into Obama‚Äôs cheerleader when he was picked. Your fiercest opposition in the debat is usually someone who cares as much as you do. Those who care are good allies

I mean I'm gonna not vote for Biden, but it's not like I have to do that to own the Neolibs. They're getting constantly owned every single day. They think Pete Buttigieg is cool. That's so fucking sad I almost want to vote for Biden out of pity.

Honest question, what if you voted for Obama, and Hilary, and still plan on voting for Biden/Harris, but don‚Äôt like Harris due to her time as DA? Does that makes you a racist?
Absolutely do not vote green. A vote for green is one less for Biden, and that only helps trump. trump is the *only* person who benefits from a Green Party vote.
Biden is a practicing Catholic.
I love watching you talk about how great Biden is and how much of a lunatic Trump is...  You do realize backing a president who has had 160,000 American souls die on his watch... is probably political suicide.  #EndTheNightmare
So  you stated you believed Biden‚Äôs accusers, and also called him a racist at one point. How do you justify accepting this nomination? You‚Äôre a con artist at best who doesn‚Äôt believe their own narrative!
Progressive voters seeing Biden/Harris:
If you see baggage, flawed, difficult, ambitious, just stop reading the article.   Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris even after she was mean to him on stage. That's something Trump and a lot of Twitter wouldn't do.

Remember Joe Biden is a feeble old man who somehow is not progressive enough and too progressive and is an existential threat to our strong nation, because he‚Äôs a feeble old man. Got it?
ü§£ü§£ü§£ Who wrote this? Kamala openly states Biden is a racist &amp; supports those who accuse him of fondling/harassment. But I guess that's ok if he picks you as VP.
Our reality: 1. The Democratic ticket is Biden/Harris 2. Republicans are actively destroying us 3. These are the only two currently viable parties for top government 4. Third parties haven't done the work in the last few decades to truly become viable for the Executive Branch
Super excited for you future Ms. VP! Can't wait to vote for Biden/Harris this November.ü§òüòé
That's how you get Trump reelected splitting democratic votes away from Biden.
It‚Äôs our duty to plaster this whole exchange between Harris, Biden, and Gabbard all over the internet.
Pence has lost 165,000+ lives on his watch. Willing to take my chances on Biden/Harris.
Funny how Biden is smart and capable until he needs to be a confused old man who doesn't know what an Anarchist is. Love how y'all will give him the benefit of the doubt on this shit and have the nerve to mock the GOP for doing the same dumb thing. No thanks. I'm good.
Cop for VP? Barf.  All politicians are awful. I'm voting for the (much, much) better platform, not because I think Biden and Harris are great people who deserve to be in power.

My friends are calling me Larrydamus. Through all the twists and turns I said it was gonna be Biden/Harris since spring 2019. Today‚Äôs lucky numbers are 6, 18 and 52.
Kamala Harris is a former police officer, and a member of the Establishment undemocratic party. She has never passed or supported the working class in anyway. IMPEACH BIDEN!
No. He literally said he wanted to prosecute people with my political beliefs like two weeks ago. Fuck Joe Biden. If the Dems think they don't need to reach out to the Left, that's their fucking problem. I'm not letting them threaten me with the GOP as an excuse to be lazy.
So during a time when everyone is screaming for criminal justice reform and police reform, Biden decides to choose Kamala Harris as his VP? This election really is going to hell in a hand basket.
Never expected Biden to be playing 4D chess. Damn.
I am very disappointed. I thought the day Biden's crew announced their choice of VP candidate would give us a hint of their overall plan. Instead they chose an Jamaican/Indian woman not an African American woman with no plan for the future.
The main problem I have with leftists is their purity tests.  Anything less than Bernie‚Äôs entire platform is a no go.  With Biden, you get like 75-80% of that. It‚Äôs really up to the senate to dictate Biden‚Äôs agenda.
I'm voting  Washington will carry for Biden/Harris with or without my vote. At least this will possibly strengthen some kind of opposition to Republicans and Democrats in the future. If this vote results in Trump's election so be it.
It‚Äôs actually very touching, it‚Äôs about grief:  In the video it is 2 minutes in.
Excellent choice! I look forward to a Biden/Harris Whitehouse!

Opinion | Kamala Harris was Joe Biden‚Äôs boldest and most qualified pick
Is it just me or did  Biden just channel his inner "Ash Ketchum" &amp; summon his most powerful Pokemon?
Still trying to use tactics from his 2016 playbook.  First nickname apparently didn't stick to Biden like it did with Hilary.  Now he's throwing out a lame nickname for Kamala.  Man-Baby is going down in November.
You know I won't. But I find this entire situation hilarious. It's a bold move for Biden and one that might actually work.
Biden picked Kamala Harris.  Called that a long bloody time ago
That's exactly how I feel. I'm voting for Biden/Harris, but holding my nose as I do so. I know at least one member of my family is voting third party (Luckily WA is a solidly blue state).
The Harris pick is strategic. It won't really drive away any of the "center-right" that have switched to Biden after realizing the dumpster fire of Trump. She has a political fanbase that it brings in, and so many progressives know that we have to vote this ticket no matter what.
First Biden, now Harris. The 2020 election is DOA.
Can anyone tell me why I should vote Biden in the replies?

Rumor has it you stopped following Joe Biden on Twitter. Does that mean you are not the VP pick?
It's a reverse discrimination dog whistle to his followers that men are being victimized by liberals and women. I predict a fresh wave of folks complaining that Biden is breaking the law (based on what I've read, he isn't).  It also gets the conversation off of Russia/Covid/etc.
Biden also has a back story that appeals. Following a fatal accident involving a wife and child he made a point of commuting each evening  to surviving sons from Washington and knew many passengers &amp; staff on Amtrak by name. I don‚Äôt know why but I feel it shows a decent man.

But he might inspire someone in a swing state not to vote for Biden.
Anyone have any thoughts on this or noticed it too? Biden gets a ton of likes on his tweets, has less followers than the prez, yet prez has 80M followers and I don't think I've seen a tweet with more than 300k likes.
Don't know why we're stressing over Biden's VP pick, it's not like there are any good options there
Mr.  There's a story regarding Opponent  and Hunter Biden in BIG TROUBLE. Not sure if you knew what's going on and Ukraine will be investigating  aka Sniffling Joe.   God bless you and protect you always.
KAMALA WILL BE POTUS WHEN BIDEN DIES. SHE IS READY.

Minn. group that saw $$ surge, some from Biden staffers, bailed out alleged violent criminals: report
Obama/Biden is the reason we got trump, right? Biden/horrible choice, will be the reason we wind up with President Alex Jones. If the candidates refuse to fight for us, then they don't get my vote. Period. Forcing me to choose between evil and diet evil, is not a choice. #FUCKEM
So good ole sleepy Joe is saying low income people are criminals. Think about that ... Minn. group that saw $$ surge, some from Biden staffers, bailed out alleged violent criminals: report
We're not given any worthwhile candidates.  Out of a country of over 300 million people, are we supposed to believe that Trump and Biden are the best we can do?
This has been made clear over and over. Joe Biden is a narcissist and a racist and that has been made clear over and over. He verbally slams black people and they still get brainwashed by the left. This is changing and I believe 2020 will be a game changer!
Scott Bolden, DNC PAST CHAIRsaid this morning that the black vote is guaranteed. He said blacks will vote for Biden no matter what. I DISAGREE üíØ perrrrrcent.
Do we think Biden actually tweeted this.....?
Actually saw a Biden sign in Oxford. Didn‚Äôt know people were happily/voluntarily voting for him lol
Biden is a terrific Republican candidate
Dems are fucked. Too much leg work for the electorate to be so fortunate as to get the status quo compromise of Biden.
So what you are saying is that the protests that are happening today under the Trump presidency would happen inder a Biden presidency.  In order to stop the protests that are happening with Trump as president will stop if Trump is re-elected.  Your logic is that of a grifter.
We won't allow Biden to be elected President.
Really? Because Kamala would be the easiest to control by the lib/left once Biden is medically removed from the Oval.  Know liar Susan Rice is a traitor &amp; wouldn't be controllable at all.
One constituency Biden has is the black vote. If he chooses a white woman instead, will will lose the black vote and perhaps replaced by that white woman candidate who cannot beat Trump
Rainbows üåà and unicorns ü¶Ñ . US response to COVID-19 won‚Äôt even start until January 22 2021 and even then only if Biden wins.
This Biden character just feels fake.
To be honest it would probably take some kind of experimental teledildonics for Biden to live to next January

Look kiddo, you know Trump can barely string three words together at this point. Biden can physical and mentally run circles around Trump.  Biden has an election platform. What is Trump running on? "I don't want to go to jail" is not a 4-year plan.
Yep, he's mad he got fired so his big revenge is to vote for Biden.
I'm a Christian and I don't support Trump. Heck, I don't even support Biden either.
I agree. Ultimately it will be about building. In the USA there is a golden opportunity in November to make a big difference. It's a real shame Bernie isn't the one up against Trump. But let's hope Biden will shape up.
So much for my wager of "Joe Biden accidentally picks WWF's Kamala as VP"
I voted green in 2016, but I was in a solid blue state. I won't be this time. I'm all for us getting super leftist people elected, but we can't have 4 more years of trump, it's at least one more supreme court choice he gets.  I fucking hate Biden, but a blowout needs to happen.
LRT:  The biggest problem with this election is the bad stuff Trump is doing is almost all stuff that Biden supported as long as it wasn't done by Trump
Yep. She'll be easier to control by the lib left especially when she's made Pres once Biden is forced to resign due to senility.
Dems charge Trump to defund Social Security; GOP says Biden embracing socialism

This is your Legacy &amp; History of your True Colors.  Demonrats puppet aka  Records of Shame.  Hannity: Biden doesn't know what city he's in  via
Everyone pretty much knows Biden (age 77 now, 78 upon inauguration) will be a one-termer and will be the wedge for his VP to become the 47th president.  That's why he needs to think long and hard about who it's going to be.
I'm fairly certain that all the voters who would be influenced by a bully mocking a disabled reporter, for instance, are so firmly in the Trump camp it would be impossible to pry them out by the sight of Biden one-upping him with his own monkey show. We're going for independents.
Why is Biden so wimpy, biding his time on the VP decision?
WHAT IS AMAZING  MR BIDEN??? IS HOW MUCH MISS INFORMATION YOU ARE ALWAYS  DISPLAYING???   WHY DON'T YOU JUST  GO AWAY  SOMEWHERE???
CORRUPTION in our faces EVERY SINGLE DAY! I know this gmhas to be fraudulent! There isn‚Äôt a single ethical Republican left in office!
that says Biden 2020. I'm confused.
Biden is going to have a heck of a mess to clean up.
Disagree. Biden made Obama palatable to white voters.  He got Obama to the WH.   Hillary should have chosen Bob Casey of PA.  Conservative D.  He would have gotten those extra votes in PA or MI.
Not a fan of Trump or Biden, but no one person can take the blame for this collapse.  It's our own appetite for lusts of the flesh.  James 4:1-4
Biden only needs to get 2% of the white vote (&gt; age 45) in six states (MI, PA, OH,FL, WI &amp; AZ. The only woman to poll positively in those states was Harris.
I believe that Kamala Harris will be the VP pick because she is a weak willed Dem who will be easily controlled should Biden have to bow out of the Oval in 6mos leaving her as President. Rice is a traitor w her own agenda who won't be bullied by her own party.
Actually, we do. Billionaires provide jobs where the working class can work. You know jobs that provide money/security. Jobs that you/Biden are trying to take away.  Heard of that before?
Biden should pick 3 Vice Presidents to appeal to the polyamorous voter.
Biden needs to be more Obama like, and inspire people to vote for him
What are you posing for? Question your own sanity if you follow Biden. He is a very troubled man. Be open to sane change not violent demonstrators that crazy Pelosi &amp; Schumer suport plus Socialism. Your Pose looks like Narcissism.
Don't BLAME what you have done on Biden.  He hasn't made the decisions for the last four years.  YOU HAVE!!!  BLAME GAMES are for sissies. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #TrumpCantRideABike
She never said that wasn't his intention. Her point was that the black vote doesn't belong to the . and that Biden should offer something more then not Drumpf to attract votes. You know that but you're just an entitled troll. McResistence.
Biden is so "Old School", it scares me.  We can't continue to move in circles where the only choices we have are "Old School" or a total outright "Idiot" like tRUMP.  We need progress toward "Common Sense" and a halt to "Slavery" once and "for all peoples".  Mark Charles in 2020.

Susan Rice Sells Netflix Shares as Biden VP Pick Speculation Heats Up  viaYou support giving Americans 2k a month during the pandemic.. but Biden and the rest of the corporate shills declined to comment.

Pushing Biden to the left shouldnt be a goal.  We should focus on expanding our numbers by converting libs and independents.  Then, we would have more electoral power/if revolution happens we have support.  Right now, if things got worse Americans would pick more fascism.

Downside is Biden admin could spend four solid years doing nothing but investigating and prosecuting Trump associates
I live on the east side of Washington State, &amp; have to travel a lot, due to my husband's job.  I have not seen even ONE Biden bumper sticker nor yard sign.
Lol  So people had a choice at that point  Voters had a choice  They looked at Bernie and said "Nope!"  Your ego says you know better than the voters  Your ego makes you more like Trump than Biden  Which is why you are working for Trump now
Lol  Bernie was " clearly winning" despite getting fewer votes  And those damn Centerists just FORCED all those unwilling voters to vote for Biden  Yeah, that's it!
Lol.   "Progressives " who don't want Biden to win are Trump supporters.  Look in the mirror and say that three times:    I want Trump to win  I want Trump to win  I want Trump to win  Then remind everyone how woke and progressive it is to support Trump

It has been awhile since I felt hopeful, so this is Great! Excited that Trump is having a meltdown; &amp; Excited about Kamala Harris being picked by Biden! Also Happy for Chrissy Teigen &amp; John Legend on their good news!
WTF are you talking about??! This is madness- ok who are you voting for?? This makes absolutely no sense...you must be a Russian troll or something actually, I‚Äôm quite sure I‚Äôm wasting my breath on this. You‚Äôre either voting for Biden or any other vote or lack thereof is 4 45

I remember joe Biden saying he was gonna run for US senate. While a gaffe, coincidentally, his senate seat is up for re-election this year
Team Joe, is so cool. Like hipster, ironic, twenty years behind cool. #TeamJoe  #Biden  #joecool #maverick #egoiswritingchecks
vote for Biden thats how it stops
at least biden knows how to work hard and not sit there doing nothing while everyone else does the work.
Yes.  Please give Obama and Biden hours and hours of free airtime talking about all the great things they did and undermining everything  Cheeto...
So are biden harris ever going to take question from the press?   they ask for a 3 month mask mandate but refuse to clarify their comments. shove your mask and vaccine where the sun dont shine.
anybody else watching this biden news conference?  we must all wear mask for the next 3 months. bullshit.   he is so low energy, is he ok?
Mark my words: Biden will regret having not chosen Karen Bass or Elizabeth Warren and thereby alienating the progressives of the party and independent leftists. I'm terrified of a repeat of the 2016 election now, esp. since  gives Trump the same odds he had then
Either way the realty is you have 2 people to pick from: the Trump &amp; Biden. Full stop, that‚Äôs it...
What Kamala Harris reveals about Joe Biden. Commentary from  at the
If they were gonna take advantage of a dead man's account to keep tweeting it should have been more creative at least.   Like, "did you see what Biden did now? Laughing so hard that I'm literally dead."
The guy who died after getting infected by the hoax virus at Trump's rally says that Biden's campaign is weird.   Huh.
Biden is not a Catholic. Read the catechism.
When Biden announces Harris as his running mate
If he wanted dirt on the left (specifically the Biden campaign), he could use ANYTHING joe Biden has said
Donald Trump saying he loves Fracking! Seriously!! I vote we just let Trump open his stupid ass mouth, because every time he does, it's a vote for Biden!! Trump is trying to kill the world, &amp; his followers don't even care. #FUCKTRUMPANDHISCRONIES
Vote Green Party or stay home then, since voting for Biden is such an obvious non starter. Trump gets your vote either way, and thanks you for your support
NOT GOING TO BE A PRESIDENT BIDEN!!
Vote for Trump. He's your only hope. He understands the nuances of race relations and identity, Biden doesn't!   Biden is a racist, Trump has done more for Black and Brown people than any president, evendors Lincoln
at least he actually does stuff and and is giving money for improvements to infrastructure. I don‚Äôt care for politicians. Trumps not a politician. He actually does stuff. Biden‚Äôs been in Office for like 50 years ...
YES YES YES THANK YOU LORD JESUS GLORY GLORY GLORY AIN'T NO STOPPING US NOW WE'RE ON THE MOVE VOTE JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS TO GOD BE THE GLORY HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH AMEN AMEN AMEN!!!!!!!

god Biden is insufferable
So biden harris first campaign event is two and a half hours late,  I think Biden just figured out who his vp pick is.
I cant wait to watch how the media will treat harris and biden differently than  The difference will be astounding.
Watch the first Biden/Cameltoe press conference
Biden said he would possibly veto M4A, wrote the most racist crime bill in modern history, was apart of the birth of our horrible border policy, Kamala hid exonerating info as a PA, enforces longer terms to provide the state with cheap labor, then laughed about herself smokingpot
Class act, both Biden and Harris. #BidenHarris2020  #BlueWave2020
Wrong, Bishop. Biden is a Catholic. Now tweet an apology for your error.
He knows Biden is not Clinton right and this is not 2016?  Asking for a friend
Again this is not 2016, Trump has 3 and 1/2 years to ruin America and most importantly Joe Biden is not Hilary Clinton.
Biden / Harris illusion will last 4 years max
To hell with Biden and all the liberals. #MAGA2020
Is Trump a moderate? No. Nothing moderate about him in any way. But you love him for his extremism.   So weird for you to criticize Biden for this.
Yeah, whiny leftists, Biden sucks. Kamala sucks. Democracy will always suck under capitalism. Politics is dirty and not always our prison-abolition wet dreams made reality. But, wow, I'd really rather have the illusion of democracy under neo-liberal capitalism than a neofascist!!
Joe Biden is gonna sniff Kamala‚Äôs hairris
Biden and the Ugandan giant how can u lose
are you backing Joe Biden this election?
Here too.  Totally support this decision and thrill at the thought of what a President Biden cabinet will look like.  Wowza.  So ready to see an end to the deluge of daily ugliness we have endured for the last four years.
Tbh, Biden could have picked a russet potato as his running mate and I would still vote for him. I‚Äôm happy it‚Äôs  though (and not a potato)
But yeah, Harris and Biden are a couple of great people. Face it, both sides are pretty much GIGO - Garbage In, Garbage Out. Garbage politicians go into office, and garbage bills, taxes, etc. come out that we have to deal with and they do not.
Biden fought de-segregation of schools, because he didn't want his kids to "go to a racial jungle."
I‚Äôm so disappointed with this whole biden campaign already
Empathy vs Assholes = #Biden vs #Trump
Irrationally refusing to look into Biden and Kamala Harris more closely is an odd take, and pretty dangerous.   Also, quarantine Donald? Pretty sure it was governors forcing the country into quarantine, and leftist governors forcing us to stay in quarantine.
Biden has had decades to solve shit, and hasn't. The crime bill, for one, plus other lovely accolades in his political career.  And Kamala hiding DNA evidence is pretty low.  We, yet again, have an election with two pretty shitty candidates.
Eh, maybe you should look into Harris and Biden a little more first.
Well, yeah. But Kamala is hardly a champion of justice herself. So while Biden might still be the "better" choice. That doesn't mean we need to ignore the issues with presidential candidate Biden and his VP pick. We can't just ignore because "oh it's still better than Trump.
I am honestly wondering if Biden and the left/DNC even want to win this election, or want Trump to win so they can keep blaming the decades of corruption, ineptitude and the current pandemic on him. #KamalaIsaCop
BREAKING: Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate on Tuesday, making history by selecting the first Black woman to compete on a major party‚Äôs presidential ticket.
Biden is not Clinton and trump had not been president for 3 1/2 years and ruined United States
Yeah you know why Biden will do something at about the pandemic other than sit on his ass and golf
Biden is no Catholic.
The GOP still has not figured out that Joe Biden is not Clinton I see.
Fresh ink from
All joking aside, nothing about Joe Biden currently comes off as strong, competent or honest.
biden still will win by 18%
Biden? The puppet candidate suffering from dementia, ahead in the polls? Sounds like a fake poll, just as in 2016.
It doesn't matter.  You'll all fall in line behind Biden anyway.  Cenk already said anybody that doesn't vote for Biden is morally inferior, so why should the DNC allow you to be a part of their convention when you've already pledged your loyalty to them?
I feel like, Biden + team obviously are trying to balance: who they think would do the best job, bring the right qualities - with also, who brings the votes, helps them win? Their fave, might not poll as well. All the options were so great. I trust them to choose correctly. üñ§
I don‚Äôt believe that Joe Biden actually writes any of these tweets. Love them or hate them, at least I know that Trump does. At least we are hearing from the actual candidate and not some employee.
And, to top it all off, the Dems &amp; the MSM are blaming the Russians for Biden's unpopularity. You just can't make this stuff up!
Biden is totally out of touch with the American people &amp; himself, for that matter.
No way Biden picks the rat as his running mate
Yep so Biden up at least 5
They told him Biden is picking Harris as vp
So the info he got in Biden from Rudy was crap, got it.
‚ÄúBiden can ride a bike, he mentally stable. Even if he bit his own wife‚Äôs finger, prefers truth over facts, and can‚Äôt remember if he‚Äôs in Iowa or New Hampshire, he‚Äôs mentally stable, he can ride a bike‚Äù

Actually his Brother and Scott Green both own property there.. They will fact check you and state that  doesn't "OWN" Property there..  ...But those other two do.. And Biden took multiple trips there..
Democrats such as #Biden want to be certain to spread the piss stained streets, the rabid addicts in tents, and criminals around the whole country now with #AffirmativelyFurtheringFairHousing  Kiss your Guns AND your safe neighborhood goodbye.
Why do we need to tax the rich when we can just borrow trilions of dollars and never pay it back?  Not being "contrary" just tired of Bernie's people rooting against Biden, which may not apply to you personally but is a popular theme with Bernie linked accounts
So is it insecurity or just being so cucked by Trump that you bootlick this hard.  Even if it said Biden, flying a giant flag with a politicians name on your truck is just cringe.  #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
Tim for Biden to announce his VP pickReally !! Stop please stop !!!!! How many times you have to hear that that is a lie , stop spreading your hate and your envy , VP Joe Biden is an Honorable man , you should be ashamed of yourself
Do your job ! And stop spreading hate towards Joe Biden , enough is enough!!!
Said it, biden literally grabbed a woman by her pussy. They said he bribed Ukraine. Biden admitted he bribed Ukraine. We need Trump. You may not understand his personality, but you'll love his freedom.
Question, isn‚Äôt it easier to have the candidate leave?   Did they remove the press so they would not see Biden needing help to get up?
This all belongs to Biden.  I think you have them mixed up somehow and don't realize it.  You should check out  And see what you have to say. When arrests happen you will he like WHAT.
Maybe Trump will pardon Obama and Biden next year too.
Go Biden/Harris! An inspiring pairing at the much needed time.
Obviously you're a Biden supporter so there's nothing else I can say to insult you further.
Bernie, AOC, Obama, Biden. I could go on, but you get the picture. The left wants centralized totalitarian control.
She‚Äôs a phony and Biden is senile. It only gets worse from here for democrats.

Is it disqualifying for Harris to go along with pretending that Biden is OK and the top of the ticket? Is that level of deceit acceptable for a president? I would hope if the VP knew the P was incapable - they would speak out before the votes are cast.

I remember, that scares me! What kind of false accusation will they come up with relating to Hunter Biden &amp; Joe?
He knows Biden won‚Äôt pardon him.
The Election is already over:  TRUMP 362 to 176 BIDEN  The Democrats have fukd themselves from any chance of winning in Nov. The silent (63% Majority) are DONE with the anti-America CANCEL CULTURE, BLM, ANTIFA, Riots, White guilt, Mayoral Tyranny, Face Diapers, MSM, &amp; Shutdowns!
Wow! I can‚Äôt believe some people want this man as President when he is intimidating the postal service. The back-and-forth comes amid a vigorous campaign by President Trump to sow doubts about mail-in voting as he faces a difficult fight for reelection against Democrat Joe Biden.
I‚Äôve read it. We already have evidence that Obama directed the whole corrupt operation.
You‚Äôve missed something. Indictments don‚Äôt need to reach Obama/Biden to incriminate them, only their close officials. We already have plenty of evidence in the public domain.
He directed it. We have the records of the White House meeting where Obama led the whole thing. January 5th 2017.
He‚Äôll change his mind when the indictments pile up on Obama/Biden administration.
Name a reason you not voting for BIDEN without mentioning TRUMP
Will, what did you honestly expect....the corrupt protecting the corrupt! Durham and Barr gonna make "swamp" very uncomfortable for the next few months....Biden needs to be worried, he was dead caught in the middle of this abomination of a presidential coup!
The subject was "being creepy" per you. Trump talking about dating his daughter isn't creepy?  Um ok..üòÇüòÇüòÇ Let me break this down for you.  If Joe Biden was a paper sack of potato peels, he would be a better, more effective president than Trump could be on his very best day.

Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate
What people don't understand about my outrage is I have no real problem w/Harris or Biden being on the ticket.    What I have a major problem with is BOTH on ticket &amp; NO Progressive representation on the ticket.
Trump has already said he won't accept Biden winning.  Nothing new here.
After Biden in office;  Federal control of covid-19 testing &amp; mandate on face masks.  Children reunited with parents &amp; Defund ICE. Total remodel DHS.  Replace cabinet with actually qualified people. Start undoing all the BS trump put in place. Prosecute #ProsecuteTrumpNow &amp; Barr
Bullshit, Biden is far more intelligent than the clowning tge while house. Thighland, Yo se mites, and let's not forget 2 Corinthians.
To: Mitch McConnel Ya know, it's one thing for your GOP folks to slant questions during hearings to "get the other side of the story"  It's quite another for Ron Johnson to blatantly say that he is using his committee to get dirt on Biden for the sole purpose of electing trump
Gotta love the deflection. Biden‚Äôs gaffes are dementia, it‚Äôs elder abuse.
More deflection. It‚Äôs hard to accept where this‚Äôs going, isn‚Äôt it? Indictments are coming for the Obama/Biden administration.
So......when Biden is Inaugurated, would you prefer he quote Gerald Ford....re: Nixon "Our long National nightmare is over" or should he say...re: trump "All of our National dreams have come true"
The Election is already over:  TRUMP 362 to 176 BIDEN  The Democrats have fukd themselves from any chance of winning in Nov. The silent (63% Majority) are DONE with the anti-America CANCEL CULTURE, BLM, ANTIFA, Riots, White guilt, Mayoral Tyranny, Face Diapers, MSM, &amp; Shutdowns!

How is there not an age limit on who can run for president? Like this man Biden is 77 years old, would be 78 going into office. Like what?? The average life expectancy for a male in the US is 76 üòÇ
Except, this one won‚Äôt fall apart because of Obama/Biden and Mueller corruption.
Imagine if Biden or Obama or Hillary announced to the nation they they were "coordinating" with the Treasury Secretary to give "payments" to the American people without Congressional approval?
And we know she is voting for Biden-Harris
Thank you I Love my country and our democratic system. That's why I'm voting Biden!
Biden and Harris will end this national nightmare we are living in.  Hands down, they will restore civility, stop the racism, stop the madness Ttump has brought down on all of us.  So pack your bags cause you going down too.

So stop telling me to vote for the "lesser evil" when there is no such thing. There is no Biden and Trump, there is only capitalism and fascism. There is no voting them away. We are so far past that point.
The Dems kneecapped Bernie because he would have actually won, and he would have been bad for capitalism. They pushed for Biden because he's a capitalist. Dems and Republicans are on the same side, capitalism. The presidential election is just a sitcom. I'm tired of watching tbh.
Dear Joe Biden: Here‚Äôs the data, now it‚Äôs time to embrace marijuana legalization
Already covered my friend. The Demon-Rats won't be able to claim victory because the margin of the Trump Landslide will be biblical.... Trump 400....Biden 144
How BAD are the MSM's polls bullshit (again)? Trump will get 63% of the Independents and up to 36% of the black vote...that's a an electoral massacre.   How the fuk are they coming up with Biden ahead anywhere except CA, WA, OR &amp; NY?

Prevaricator trump is saying Kamala Harris (who was born in California) does not meet the citizen requirements. Who else will he falsely accuse? My senseless neighbor came over to tell me that Biden will need to pick another running mate. Fox news does it again.
Biden doesn't inspire me even by 1/10ths of the way Obama did.  If that doesn't tell you how jaded I am about the elections, nothing will. This shit needs to end.
Trump 363 Biden 176 This is how BAD the MSM's polls are skewed (again)!! Trump will get 63% of the Independents and up to 36% of the black vote...that's a an electoral massacre.  How the fuk are they coming up with Biden ahead anywhere except CA, WA, OR &amp; NY?

Counter hot take:  If you don't vote for Biden you have chosen to reinforce fascism.  There is a time to attack and a time to defend. The left lost this run and now we must mitigate damage. Vote for the enemy you want. Biden and Kamala have BOTH been dragged left in the past.

Seems like Biden isn't allowed in public at all, without supervision. That's probably a good idea...
If he truly 'understood what he posted was wrong' he never would've posted in the first place  wait for it ~ trump will come to his defence  Virginia mayor urged to resign after saying Biden picked 'Aunt Jemima as his VP'  via
She made him cry.   I can't wait to see what will happen when the Biden/Harris take office.
Such a lier can you even tell the truth once. I tell ya you don‚Äôt deserve to be Biden‚Äôs VP. You disgrace the position.
Congratulations! I'm so VERY happy Joe Biden made you his choice for his running mate! You'll make a superb VP!
My 91 yr old Mom,  just called to tell me that she had decided in Jan 2017 to vote for Biden in 2020.  Me: Mom, are you OK? Mom: I'm fine, why? Me: Um, Joe wasn't running then Mom: I know, what I meant was I'd vote for any Dem who could fog up a mirror on election day.  Whew!!
I could feel my whole body relax when Biden &amp; Kamala spoke about their Covid-19 plan this morning. I know I was getting the truth. I wish we could paste Biden &amp; Kamala into the WH!
Medical Advisor to Biden: If all Americans wear masks for 3 months we can save 40,000 lives Biden: Then we will order it  Medical Advisor to trump: (same as above) trump: I might lose votes if I order that, so no.
Biden/Harris 2020.  Yea baby!!!
Even if masks are required in heavily populated areas or areas where #COVID19 cases are high... cases aren't high everywhere. For example, would you force someone to wear a mask on a ranch in Wyoming? Biden/Harris and many of their supporters sound like control freaks to me.
So will she announce she is supporting the Biden/Harris ticket to avoid past missteps at the Republican convention?
Biden and Harris just had a private meeting with a number of advisors, including former Fed Chair Janet Yellen....  I would loved to have heard the discussion about the current Fed action of buying  corporate stocks to prop up the market.
Kanye may have danced with the devil but who's throwing the Ball?  Who is not only dancing but sleeping w the devil?  A: The puppet masters that control Biden (they needed one who was weak, loosing his faculties &amp; unable to fight) and have placed KHarris to assume the throne....
And he may have a stroke if Biden names you Attorney General...... Please, please Joe.....just do it

But who is for blacks? Trump? Get out of here.. our only hope in this election is Biden and Harris.. I can guarantee that they will have way more diversity in their party giving more minorities opportunity then what we have in the White House currently.
You just admitted you‚Äôre mean to Biden psycho.
Even so, I think Ayaan has more than earned the right to be half-wrong once in a while. I think Biden's sloppiness is quite dangerous.
Sir low income housing is a necessity for alot of families.  Why are you so against the low income folks who are hard workers? I guess if your not rolling in money you don't count. Biden for president 100%.
45 is literally an overt racist, son of a klansman. Biden has certainly said (and yes - 30 yrs ago) done some racist acts, but you're fooling urself if u believe black ppl think Biden is racist. White, 45 supporters are the ONLY ones who say Biden's racist. üôÑü§£üåä

Sudden thought just occurred to me: If #TrumpKillsUSPS, doesn't that also affect his base of voters as well--not just Biden and the Democrats?
Too bad it won't happen with the Biden Harris ticket.
I'm not young and I'm not going to vote for Prez/VP, only for down ballot.    My state is a guaranteed win for Dems. Biden doesn't even bother to campaign here. The elections are called before they even start counting my state's votes. My vote literally does not matter.

The media will continue to attack kanye simply for the fact that he takes voters away from Biden.
The cure! Shower, and listening to Biden and Harris. Suicidal ideation crises averted and remedied. Aaaaaaaahhhhh.
If Trump is so incompetent it should be easy to find a better candidate. Biden Harris is the best they could do. Are they really it. I can't begin to understand what goes on in a brain that thinks these two are the answer. Reminds me of when the gave Barry McCain and Palin.

Biden/Harris are not trying to make the US a socialist society, however Trump is trying to be a dictator and you are falling right in step with it...
Covid19 is a perfect analogy for American politics. Trump is the virus, and Biden is a mask. The mask is uncomfortable, and you're not happy you have to wear it, but you understand that if you don't it will literally cost lives so you wear it, because it's the right thing to do.
Does anybody else ever feel personally attacked by Trump? Because he's going after social security and affordable housing, and my medical care, and my LGBTQ community and my vagina. Then all these privileged white guys on my feed take a "never Biden" stance that could kill me.
Cannabis leaders react to Biden‚Äôs choice of Kamala Harris: Will she help or hurt marijuana legalization?
Wait...what? You are looking at suppression Polls? who does that? You didn't learn a damn thing in 2016 did you? the Helmuth prediction model has Trump 363 to Biden 176, which many believe is a low estimate, it will probably more like 400 to 144. I guarantee you. Just watch.

CRITICAL UPDATES: Trump, Biden/Harris, Stocks, Gold, Silver, Bitcoin, MO...  via
Biden is accused of ONE horrible crime and no one knows what happened. We do know the accuser changed their story multiple times. I dont use moral high ground to claim it‚Äôs acceptable or not. Trump has been accused of raping multiple women and a child too. You‚Äôre morally inept.
Are you talking about Alabama‚Äôs Jeff Sessions, the Attorney General that was confirmed in the senate by republicans only? Betsy DeVos? Trump? Biden has progressed from his stances from 40 years ago while republicans senators and the current president and staff still support it?!
Even Biden?
No.  And Warren would be forced to betray her progressive beliefs to enforce Biden/ Harris Wallstreet agenda.
I'm in a, Blue State where Right-Leaning Wallstreet Dems Biden/ Harris don't even bother to campaign.  They don't care about us because they call the elections before including our electoral votes. They don't give a damn about progressives. So they won't miss it when I don't vote
I feel like Biden picked Harris just to add diversity.
No.  I would have been okay with Karen Bass too.  She has progressive cred.  But Progressives are being denied representation in any power seat.  Right-Leaning Dems like Biden/ Harris take us for granted. Don't even campaign in my blue state. My vote doesn't matter to them.
I lived through Reagan years.  Biden is damn close to a Reaganite
She jumps on the bandwagon after she thinks it will get her points.  Her campaign was Right-Leaning which is why Biden picked her and Wallstreet is celebrating.
Biden and Harris would have been considered Reagan Dems in the 80s. They've moved the "center" way to the Right.  Wallstreet is celebrating.    I'm in a Blue state so they won't miss me not voting for Pres.  They don't even campaign here.
Still not going to support them.  My state is Blue. Progressives are the only ones that listen to us.  Biden &amp; Harris don't represent Progressives.  So they won't miss my vote.  I'm voting down ballot but will vote None on President/VP
They don't even campaign here because Washington is a reliably Blue state.  The only ones who have cared are Progressives.  Biden &amp; Harris don't care about our votes.  So why bother when my vote won't matter.
First off,  they're to the right of most Dems.    But... here's the only selling point necessary  Biden/ Harris aren't Fascists like Trump/ Pence
I'm not a Bernie fan.  Biden could have united the party by picking Warren.  Instead her picked a Wallstreet,  Right-Leaning,  "Law&amp;Order " cop
Cool. You didn‚Äôt even bring one single rational reason to the thread for your prejudices towards Biden and your unequivocal support for Trump. Your commentary was completely full of hypocritical bipartisan hacks. The fact you cant even promote a single rational reason says It all
Your point? That you hold Biden to a much higher standard than you do with Trump and Republicans? There‚Äôs video of Trump lying about cheating on his wife and wishing child self traffickers well. Your political hack jobs are a disgrace to free speech and the american way.
It was over 40 years ago. Again, why endorse republicans who have/had the same opinion yet attack Biden for it? Cause you and others with the same sentiment have no moral compass at all. You are not a patriot. Patriots don‚Äôt use their freedom to promote hypocrisy. Despicable.
Why do you care about what Biden did 45 years ago? Republicans were the masterminds behind segregation laws and DeVos and Trump are trying to bring it back yet you use It as a talking point to attack Biden? You have no moral compass. Is this how we make America great again?
Your partisan hacks here are anti-American and unpatriotic reasons for  bigotry. If you‚Äôre going to try to use talking points to discredit Biden don‚Äôt use ones that overly discredit Trump too. Make them at least rational. How do you only have hypocritical talking points?
That Trump is exponentially more of a racist than Biden. True. Yet you‚Äôre still voting for Trump? Thanks for clarifying your rationale behind your support for Potus 45. Trying to argue not to support Biden cause he‚Äôs racist when Trump is quantifiablly more racist is unpatriotic.
It‚Äôs pathetic that supporters of Trump even try to bring up the race card when attempting to discredit Biden. How patriotic and American. Way to Make America Great Again. One hypocritical and biased opinion after another to justify your prejudices and ignorance.
Racist you say? When did Biden take out multiple newspaper ads calling for the death of black teenagers that didn‚Äôt even commit a crime and then refuse to apologize or admit wrongdoing when it was proven they were innocent? He didn‚Äôt? Who did? Trump you say?! What a rarionale.
Q: Have you sent this same tweet to Biden? If not, why?
And now we're really pissed off.  We'll vote out the fascist,  but are not going to support the Corporate Right-Leaning Biden/ Harris Admin when they're in office.
She doesn't even respect Biden. She must be drunk on power. Where is her personal integrity. Oh, maybe she doesn't have any.i
Yeah.  Warren was gracious,  letting Biden take credit of her plans revised for COVIDtimes.  Biden used them to get support.   And has now clearly signaled with Harris as VP nom,  that he will NOT be working towards them at all.  They both would have been Republicans 40 yes ago
So what if Biden intentionally chose a woman. Do you feel threatened by that?
No they won't because we're being denied representation at the table. We have to choose Biden for less abuse but it's still Wallstreet Right-Leaning abusive policies.
More than half of the Democratic Party is being denied a power seat to represent us.  This is nothing short of major regressive move for the Dem party even if we are required to vote for Biden to get rid of Fascists.  It's still a hostage transfer situation to just less abuse
Does NOT mean I support Biden/ Harris in ANY way except to get Trump out then throw them out in 2024!
We have nothing to vote FOR , only AGAINST.  That's all because we're being denied representation in the seats of power.  So we vote AGAINST Trump Fascism by being forced to vote for Biden/ Harris Right- Leaning Wallstreet regressive ticket.
One of my fb friends is all mad. She‚Äôs big mad! But claims she‚Äôll vote for Biden anyway.  She‚Äôs railing about KH because of Bernie blah blah blah...
Didn't Trump just say yesterday the pandemic of 1917 (1918) ended the second world war. Yeah, he did. So at this point which old guy do you trust more? My money is on Biden. Cause Trump is Putins puppet.
Wait...was Joe Biden not vice president to president Obama for 8 years?

Results from CT today. It looks like Biden will get all 60 delegates.   Also an update from NY, where Sanders gives up 11 delegates to Biden.   New totals: Biden 2716, Sanders, 1115, Others 146.   Only the 2 uncommitted dels from KY are still unknown.
Agreed, Biden Harris for an honest America.
Beat me to it. Any chance the Biden campaign licenses that song? Would love to hear it at a Biden-Harris (virtual) rally!

Yeah.  Warren/AOC 2024 and AOC 2028. If we survive the right- leaning Biden-Harris years.  But as older working poor with disabilities,  I'm going to be screwed for 4 more years either way.
Well,  I won't vote for Harris in 2024 unless the only alternative is another Fascist.  That's the only reason to vote for Biden/ Harris if you're a progressive.  I want more representation than "At least we're not Fascists. "
10% unemployed, 165000 Dead from the virus that will just go away. Who needs your promises? Biden Harris to govern.
It hasnt happened in 4 years, but we *can* actually hold politicians accountable for their bullshit while in office. That is a thing we can normally do.  I just hope Biden's actually ready for the broke, sick, angry, radicalized nation he's about to inherit.
The electoral college says otherwise. I'm voting Jo Jorgensen, but in my state I'm sure Biden will win, so it doesn't really matter who I vote for. But at least I voted for the person I think would do the best job.
We'll vote for Biden,  because we have been FORCED to become One- Issue voters since we now have zero representation on the ticket.  Our only issue is voting Trump out. You can't make it into any kind of good, though. Because the Right-leaning Dem ticket betrays working poor.
Like the single issue voters voting to get Trump out? Because Biden Harris is crap for representing me.  The only reason they get my vote is because the alternative is Fascism.  I may puke voting for them, but I'll do it. Even knowing that they have it out to destroy Progressives
They will never fix it.  They are Wallstreet darlings.  That's why Wallstreet is celebrating Biden picking Harris.  Progressives have been betrayed again.
I didn‚Äôt say Biden wants to kill it. Their party is moving that way. Look at their up and comers.  says he loves capitalism all the time. I‚Äôm just pointing out the insanity of voting for bigger government instead of smaller. Trump needs to go. But not to these two.
I‚Äôm voting for Biden as a stop gap. But  we should all buy ARs.
Also,  remember Cabinet members are usually a short term career ending job.  She wouldn't go back to the Senate.  None of her policies would be implemented.  Except for the ones Biden &amp; Harris have stolen to pad their lack &amp; pretend they will work for ordinary Americans.

Warren needs a power seat,  not one where she's forced to implement the anti-progressive policies of a right- leaning Wallstreet Biden/Harris Admin.  Unfortunately, Biden has ruled her out for SCOTUS because she isn't Black. And Senate Dems won't make her their leader.

Did Joe Biden take out newspaper ads to wrongfully convict black teens of murder and refuse to apologize or admit wrongdoing when they were finally exonerated and freed? Didn‚Äôt think so. Who did? Oh, yeah. That was Trump
I‚Äôm confused. You claim you‚Äôre tough on crime and all this video does is claim Biden is too. How does this make you look good exactly? If anything, It makes him appeal to more conservative voters. Are you conceding already? It will save lives if you do.
Kamala worked with Joe Biden's son, Beau. He has a soft spot for her.
Except Biden/ Harris is a Wallstreet,  Right-Leaning, "Law &amp; Order " ticket that only pays lip- service to progressive causes.  Their slogan may as well be "We're Not Fascists Like The Other Side", because that's the only thing getting them elected.
Biden proved today that he does not support working poor Americans. We'll vote for him instead of Fascism,  but he won't be making any progressive changes like we need.
Don't lecture me.  I know better than you having lived through it.  There were excellent choices to move in a progressive direction at a time when it would be supported because of Trump and COVID.  Instead Biden picked Wallstreet "Law &amp; Order" after stealing Warren's work.
Unless Schumer quits and manages to appoint her to Dem Senate Leader--OR--Biden recinds his requirement for SCOTUS nominees to be Black,  there's no adequate position that she should accept.  Everything else is just being a mouthpiece forced to promote someone else's policies
I wish I could of seen Joe Biden‚Äôs reaction when they told him who his running partner was ü§£
People like WALLSTREET who are celebrating getting their right- leaning corporate Dem ticket?  Only reason there's any progressive support is bc alternative is fascism. It's only lip-service/won't enact ANYTHING progressive. Biden has signaled no seat for Progressives at table
I am so excited to vote for you and Joe Biden. I will never forget talking with you about gun violence prevention in Des Moines. You will be a force for good in our country! #BidenHarris2020
Biden would have never picked Kamala if Fentanyl Floyd never died
We will never get Warren as Dem Senate Majority/ Minority Leader. Schumer won't step down &amp; Corporate, Blue Dog,  Law &amp; Order Dems like Harris would never vote for her to be.   Biden rejected her for SCOTUS because she isn't Black.  There are no more power seats for Progressives
If she were in the Cabinet,  she would be forced to enact the regressive right- leaning policies of Biden/ Harris.  Only a mouthpiece lackey without the power to make progressive change.  It's a short term crap. Career ending job.
I am kinda "meh" about the Kamala Harris VP pick. This has been the rumor for the last few months. I will vote for Biden but only because the alternative is far worse.
I hope you don't blame God for not answering your prayer when Biden and Harris take office in January.
are democrats who are saying they‚Äôre going to refuse to vote for biden/harris really fine with trump winning again???
I said I would vote for the lesser evil.  That doesn't mean I will support the evil.  I'm voting AGAINST Trump. Not because I like or support a Biden Harris agenda.
She would be forced to run BIDEN'S Treasury, not hers.  Not progressive
Celebrating Biden/Harris 2020I will never vote Democrat ever again because of rude Biden bros...they hurt my fee fees
Thanks, #Biden!
Trump isnt going to pardon Snowden. But the liberal response to him suggesting it is going to alienate progressives who would otherwise reluctantly vote for Biden. They're already screaming about Russia at high volume. Whoever asked this question knew exactly what they were doing
Hiding in the basement is the worst possible thing Biden could be doing with dementia.
RICO was written by Biden, and it needs to be repealed. It has corrupted more police than any other piece of legislation by allowing police to literally rob people and then force them to prove how they got whatever they seized to get it back.
Wow! What leadership:  "The Biden campaign did not respond when asked whether a President Biden would push for a public option right away or start with a smaller bid on health care."
Biden says nuns inspire him to run, plans to sue Little Sisters of the Poor -
We feel sorry for Biden. He clearly isn‚Äôt there mentally anymore.
Refusing to vote for Biden is like refusing to wear a mask.  It's not about the consequences that you as an individual will face.  It's about the consequences that everyone besides you will face.  Refusing to vote for Joe is the most white privileged thing a liberal could do

I think you meant to write: Ah, you are obviously a Biden supporter. You can't even speak English! LOL I speak AND write Russian, and write, and speak English; I also correct poor attempts at writing in English, by skinhead wannabe Nazi sympathizers.
The nutcase probably has Alzheimers, his father died from it.  Biden doesn't have dementia, he does have a stutter that  makes him have to change the word he is trying to use midstream when his first choice won't come out, he is all there, no matter what the Twitler lovers say.
You don't deny it. I see a lot of gendered hate against Kamala that I wouldn't expect to have seen if Joe Biden had picked a man. Rather than criticizing her policy, you meme about her being a woman in a sexual way. I don't appreciate it.
bernie was on his save the post office grind early and we got biden. democrats are the ones stoping real change not republicans
I would say that her life is in grave danger.  Maxwell would be very inconvenient to an incoming Biden Administration. I would imagine that an aneurysm or heart attack would be listed as the cause of death
go look what the #fauxtrage from #reichwingdeathcult about Biden's son when he died from cancer. Or a host of number of other progressive politicians passed. And i'm sorry for the loss of the #WrongTrump
Yeah but even without approval voting, Warren did way better than Harris. she had more votes and pledged delegates than 26 of the 29 candidates. She raised vastly more money than Harris, both for her own campaign and for Joe Biden.

Suppose that Biden adds 2 to SCOTUS. What's to prevent the next opposition President from expanding SCOTUS by 5 or even 10 Justices? Eventually, you would have a Supreme Court with over 100 Justices! This is very extreme, I know; but you get the general idea!
Biden is a fucking crook..... Plain simple truth
Don‚Äôt push for Biden in this election and I will start believing in you.
Biden Harris....still cannot stop myself from laughing when I here these 2 twits. Plain simple truth
In Iowa, and around the country, polls are showing older voters trending toward Joe Biden and away from President Trump‚Äîa potentially tectonic development.
For a second I thought you were talking about Biden. The 1994 Crime Bill still affects many in this country today. Just because you‚Äôre white and you don‚Äôt experience it doesn‚Äôt mean people aren‚Äôt affected.
"It's no longer a conservative [republican] party committed to a better America for all Americans. It's Trump's Party‚Äîriddled with conspiracy theories, racism, sexism and intolerance. It's anti-intellectual and anti-science. It's corrupt to the core."

This from the man whose stupid MAGA hats are made in china but Biden‚Äôs support hats are made in the USA. Where‚Äôs your true loyalty lay, DONALD?
Why are all members of the Trump cult wearing caps from China bearing the Biden campaign slogan?
I don't think it's that Green and Libertarian finally have their moment to shine. I think it's that we see people move toward the Bernie camp OR the Biden camp. And then you see people move toward the Tea Party OR the Kasich camp. And then each traditional party is "weakened".
You and Biden are puppets. Tulsi Gabbard is an actual leader. #NeverBiden #NeverKamala #NeverHillary #TulsiDestroyedKamala #IStandWithTulsi #DemExit
Oh yes you're 100% right. This would be great for the primary process. I would love this from the DNC and RNC. We'd likely never get a Trump (or a Biden for that matter)
Contrast that to all the trashing on the Right of Hunter Binden not that long after Joe Biden lost Beau to cancer. That tells you all you need to know about the right
"Biden floated (at the time) baseless election card conspiracy later confirmed by Trump."
Biden would have nukes him. Funny how diplomacy works right?
As long as Biden continues to be indistinct from Trump on the issues of healthcare, foreign policy and climate change, I couldn‚Äôt really care less which right winger occupies the plantation house.
Donny J Trump is hindering his chances at being reelected by slowing postal service during the age of CPVID-19.  Vote Biden/Harris by November 3 and restore sanity to America.
I‚Äôve noticed the anti Biden and Harris memes a lot lately. When I bring up the fact that 1. This only helps trump and 2. This is exactly what happened last time, I‚Äôm called a boomer and laughed off.   I laugh bc that is not going to stop me at all.
You'd half to be an absolute moron to think that Biden had anything to do with that, that he condones that, and that it has anything to do with him. This has so much more to do with Trump. This is his America. These are the seeds he has sown.
This is very scary because it indicates Democrats have no idea how their health care laws actually work and what problems what new problems this bill would cause.
Concert instead.  Its the best joe biden can do.
Donny J Trump is going to face FEDERAL prosecution for  infringing on AMERICAN'S constitutionally protected right to vote freely and safely for Biden/Harris by mail in the age of COVID-19.  The clubhouse crook will be guilty as charged.
‚Å¶ failure. It‚Äôs not the Democrats holding up funding for USPS, and Covid 19 relief package. It Is You!!!!
Obama / Biden love #Privatization. LOVE IT.
Prayers for the Trump Family... They're looking at many criminal charges when My President Biden and VP Kamala take office! ü§≠
But Biden is leading Trump by 7%!?!?
Do any of you have an argument for voting Biden/Harris as a means of harm reduction, or as part of a long term political strategy? I'm looking around and just don't see it.
This is where we'll have to agree to disagree. Statistically, the winner is guaranteed to be Dem or GOP. I believe "not as bad as tRump" to be a gross oversimplification, but even if it weren't, I'd still vote for the only one that can best tRump, and that's Biden.
Biden should put his big boy pants on and give us something to vote for. He needs to EARN my vote, and so far he's failing miserably. Today he even took the public option off the table. He offers us nothing and you demand we vote for that?
Biden would definitely win if Christians write-in "Jesus."
I feel your pain sister. At least my daughter-in-law votes. She's a Berner but has already told me she's voting for Biden because she knows if she doesn't she's in effect casting a vote for trump and she'd NEVER do that. She's too smart.
She will likely be secretary of state if Biden wins.
This is Susan Rice, the likely Secretary of State for Joe Biden.  Questioning Trump because he wants to look at pardoning Snowden.  This is the people you support democrats: Warmongers who want their secrets protected.  #VOTETHEMOUT #NEVERBIDEN

Biden's not anti police, &amp; while I don't personally see him toady empty rhetoric - Law &amp; Order jig to prove loyalty, Its understood that the POTUS has the full force of arms at his disposal - Biden knows the drill back &amp; forward.
Neither. We need to get the fuck together and sort shit out. Trump and Biden are both shit and what's worse is that we're letting them be shit.
And then Biden will get another trump elected.
Does he know that he's asking people not to vote for him?  Really, his mouth is Biden's best ad maker.
Is somebody telling him that or is he just making it up? Seriously - Joe Biden should *not* debate this man!
But trump is embarrassing because he says stupid shit. Biden is better at hiding that he's a douchebag. üòâ Sarcasm aside, Trump has done good shit at killing the US empire imperialism but it's because of his own interest or stupidity every time it happens. So, he can be better.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I've donated a total of $13 to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris' campaign. Think of all the tater tots I could have gotten instead. At least 6.  Help make my money worth it by voting early this November! Don't let the forgotten tots go to waste! #VoteTrumpOut #VoteBlue
I mean...the answer to, "is Biden less of a warmonger than Trump?", is, "yes."  If it was, "imperialist", then you've got grounds for discussion. But "warmonger" is more specific. With Biden it would be a hyperbolic distinction for rhetorical effect. With Trump, it's literal.
Refers to many incidents where women say Biden was too familiar,  but that the touching wasn't sexual.    Incidents occurred in public.  Biden hasn't denied them, so I'm sure Harris "believes" them now as she did then.  If any video to contrary, please link.

#MyGutTellsMeThat our national nightmare will soon be over when Joe Biden is President of the United States.
Sorry. We have idiots in this country who have fallen victim to MSM. They aren‚Äôt voting for Biden‚Äôs policies (I don‚Äôt know if any tbh).  These useful idiots are voting solely for the fake narrative that ‚ÄúOrange Man is Bad‚Äù..
What would you expect them to do? Biden is a private citizen and Harris is currently in Senate minority. Trump and his cronies are currently in charge and he gutted FEMA disaster relief funds to pay for wall and unemployment benefits - by his executive orders.
It is possible. If Biden‚Äôs campaign actually started supporting real progressive policies. Instead he‚Äôs trying to rely on Trump being terrible.   Dont underestimate Trump. Hillary did in 2016 and look where that got us.   #BidenHarrisLandslide2020
Which, a local endorsement is weird, right? My school district has a small union that is part of east county, which is a part of oregon, which is a part of the NATIONAL education association. NEA endorsed Biden. PAT (Portland Public School's Union) didn't endorse president...
You‚Äôve heard it first from Daniel with the American flag in his name. Taylor Swift will have no money left if Joe Biden wins. God speed, Taylor.
You do know that Biden is a private citizen right now? He does not even have a vote in congress. But cutting SS is NOT his position. This from the campaign website:
I'm not a Biden fan. But all I want from him is his signature. He needs to be too afraid of us to veto or derail legislation he finds too progressive. That's why I'm contributing to 4 Senate + 7 House candidates, &amp; why I'll have no problem criticizing him loudly &amp; in the streets.
A game to get Biden elected. I think many media of color struggle with whether to name it and give it power or ignore it. This may sound like an easy choice but it‚Äôs nuanced.  highlights that we‚Äôre all here again. What are we gonna do? I‚Äôm not gonna shoot the messenger
Other: Trick question. Biden &amp; Harris already won the primary on the back of DNC corruption with the msm propaganda machine defeating Bernie &amp; #NotMeUs  And, just as in 2016 where we would've avoided Trump because #BernieWouldHaveWon in a landslide, #BernieWouldHaveWon in 2020
Opinion | Trump stokes fear. Biden and Harris can raise hope.
Two people who have no reason to lie in this scenario, and who have considerably more access to insider information than either of us do.   Health insurance stocks sure don't seem to be intimidated by a potential biden victory.
That he picked Harris as VP is all the more reason I will eagerly vote for Joe Biden.
I think if Biden loses in November we should throw Tom Perez into a volcano.
"Dan Lavey,¬†who has advised and run campaigns for leading #Oregon #Republican candidates, including former U.S. Sen. Gordon Smith &amp; past GOP nominees for governor Chris Dudley and Knute Buehler...explains why he'll vote for Joe #Biden in November."
When Trump steps on freedom of press, people are rightfully angry at his fascism.  But when the Biden and the establishment Dems do it to leftist journalists that are critical of them? Where's the outrage then?
The basic argument for electing Biden, boiled down to one sentence.
Biden was Obama's Lieberman, he's way to the right of Obama.   And the evidence has always been there in his record, and continues to be there in the contemporaneous statements of party leaders and actions of his campaign.  WAKE THE FUCK UP.
Democrats are used to having people do what they want.  Look at  believing ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt black‚Äù if an African-American votes for   Biden personifies the party of slavery, the Conferderacy, and segregation.
Stemming the tide of authoritarianism inthe ethnic-nationalist state is the only reason why I‚Äôm voting for Biden.
I will not vote for Biden because I don‚Äôt want to
We found out today we're not even getting a public option out of the Biden administration, at a time when 100 million people can't afford to see a doctor, during a global pandemic.  You want people on the left to vote for Biden, work on changing that.
Well have you seen Biden post? About Americans having a shot. Black and Brown? Well I've asked him what about Whites ? And for sure for myself?  And I also stated Trump does nothing either to protect my family or those 1000 plus out of Oregon.
Ok, who‚Äôs down to see the Kanye / Biden Presidential debate?
Back in reality:  Obama built it. Trump broke it. Biden will fix it.
I‚Äôd love to see the Kanye / Biden Presidential debate.  That would be awesome!!!!

100% correct.  When Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris are elected, along with enough Democrats to flip the Senate and expand control of the House, we will have one of the greatest years that we've ever had.

Can‚Äôt think of a better reason to vote for Biden and Harris
For die-hard 3rd party voters who refuse to vote for Biden, you can stand on your principles if you‚Äôll stand next to the children in their cages on the border. Get over yourselves and do what‚Äôs best for Trump‚Äôs trauma victims. #StoptheDonald

You do clothes and music really well. Biden and Harris won‚Äôt tell you how to do clothes and music. Don‚Äôt tell them (or us) how to run for President.

After 5.5 months of solidly politicising the coronavirus, Trump criticizes Biden for politicising the coronavirus.  And Biden is only restating current CDC recommendations.  Six months in, and we still have no national plan. And it shows in 168,000 deaths and rising.
While this is all mostly from industry people and senior congressional aides, that's usually how the walk back starts, and there is also this glaring bit.  "The Biden campaign did not respond when asked whether Biden would push for a public option right away or start smaller."
Wonder if the DNC can just throw up video montages of 45 saying racist/misogynistic/hateful statements over and over again at his rallies in place of most of Joe Biden‚Äôs debate responses?
I can‚Äôt wait to vote for Biden and still be blamed if he loses.
I used to think Trump would win, then like a month or 2 ago I started feeling like Biden would come out ahead, now with the postal service shit I‚Äôm starting to change my mind again and have no idea what to actually think lol
Empty vessel Biden..
via    Republicans proving yet again that they are Gouty Old Patriarchs; Trump is whining like the pitiful loser he always has been.
too humid.
I'm not certain why people argue Sanders' message was better when (1) he lost decisively to Biden among Democratic primary voters and (2) consistently polled slightly worse than Biden in general election matchups
You see that the party is already saying no public option?  Convention hasn't even happened yet.
Hey Ro, what do you have to say about the revelation that we aren't even getting a public option out of Biden?
And he calls Biden sleepy? Fuckin snooze fest bruh.
The amount of privilege these dinguses have to be able to say "the differences between Trump and Biden are so minor that the results will not affect me"
Im not with the democratic party so again, please try to stay on topic. You still havent shown me how you know trump isnt a pedophilic rapist but Biden is.
Do you really wanna start talking about meetings in the White House? Really? You start down that path you‚Äôre going to piss Donald Trump off Biggly. Anything the Bidens did was outdone by Trump a hundred times. #Biden

Biden AND trump are pedophiles, most people in office are! Idk why that is hard for you to grasp if you believe Biden is one.
You are literally a propagandist. He absolutely shouldn't be on your show being asked about Obama gate and hunter biden and dementia and rioters. He doesn't need to participate in russian interference just because you whine
biden's whole platform is "at least it's not trump"
So now show me your proof for believing Biden is a pedophile, I'd like to know why you say hes one but Trump, who has much more damning evidence against him, is not?
Trump doesn't answer questions, he crafts word salads that circle back to some vaguely connected falsehood, like "Nobody believed we could shut down China..." (He didn't, as you know...) So Biden's got nothing to prove on that score. (And yet his lead is stable. Carry on, Joe...)
She was the most diverse person in Biden‚Äôs Binder of Women for VP candidates.
How much more receptive r White ppl r to hearing it from Bidrn w/ a WOC as his backup, in a supportive role we've been conditioned to accept. Is it just BLM progress or would we have heard Obama, could he have been as explicit as Biden can?  Was he and I ignored it?
Nate, so does Oregon. Zero chance here. I'm no Trumpalo, so whats the stort, get Oregon whining and then play it to the base?...Always something....I hate both majors. Writing in somebody at this point Gary Johnson but Biden certainly takes Oregon so no wasted.
Ideas are actually ownable. What ideas and where they go is the province of the other 2/3 of IP law, which have been getting way out of hand. Hey, will Joe Biden fix that? Might make me vote for him if so.
Ah but they're confused. They must've mis-spoke!   Of course Biden's against STEAL, as in "stealing the election," or "stealing a bunch of money from the government for his private golf courses and hotels." üòé
I especially like how he's opposed federal funding of abortions for the vast majority of his entire career until he very credibly pivoted right before being named VP, just like Joe Biden.

Good news folks, the party is abandoning the public option before the convention.  We've already pushed Biden to the left, saying we'd crawl over broken glass to vote against Trump is paying dividends, not a single one of us is getting played or extorted.
Keep in mind Biden has become more progressive after working with Sanders &amp; Warren. And bringing Harris onto the ticket means he is showing he‚Äôs willing to listen to the people.  Enough said.
AND if we can get the right Congress, they can put forward amazing legislation that Biden will sign. But we have to push for the right reps, the right senate, and elect someone who we can work to bring this country along towards the 21st century.
Pretty tired of the anti-Biden ‚Äòleft‚Äô who say he isn‚Äôt as progressive as they‚Äôd like. Yes, he should be more prog. BUT we can move him towards more progressive ideals

Is this what happens when you don‚Äôt vote for Biden?
If Biden was hoping that Kamala would lock up the Black vote for him, he could be very sad after a Rasmussen poll found that 36% of Blacks say they are less likely to vote for him with her on the ticket. That‚Äôs a big number and if BLM is consistent, they‚Äôll not like Harris as VP.
Hey Hillary , ask Joe Biden he's pretty tight with China, maybe they could ship another virus before the election.
Nevermind you're just a Biden astroturf account and not a real boy.
Reading #ThePassageofPower right now &amp; there are SO many similarities between the JFK/LBJ &amp; O/Joe relationships. JB had closer friendship with his boss but he &amp; LBJ were both effective Senate horsetraders  dismissed as archaic, unrefined and less educated.
Gee it's almost like all the progressive who pointed out Biden's plans were bullshit were right.  "the party would start next year with a more modest package of fixes to ObamaCare that did not include a public option in an effort to get some early points on the board."
Go ahead.  Vote biden.  Aint gonna stop this
Tell that to Biden.  The squad is establishment 2.0  We see you.  hypocrites.
Yeah better than Biden same coin two sides. Trump still a piece of trash human being but as president is mediocre/decent. Again better than Biden tbh

This. I am so sick of the utter SELFISHNESS of "protest" voting (or not). There are 2 *legitimate* choices: Biden, or Trump. Anything else, whether you LIKE the choices or not, means you're acting like a child and can't see the ramifications for others, if not you.

Biden/ Harris is not far to the left.
If we can get a Biden administration, dem senate, and house - let's not get lazy when it is time to vote in midterms and call representatives. It is way easier than what we have been doing! If Dems had voted in 2010 in 2008 numbers, I think the whole world would look different
People telling themselves there will be a primary in 2024 are engaging in fantasy.   If Biden stays in, no primary, if he is going to drop out, he'll do it just before, or just after the midterms, then Harris is the incumbent, and again no primary.
Yes. They want to return to the way it was under O__ma &amp; Biden, the good ol' days for them when they had free reign to rip off and cripple America.

Nic, I respectfully disagree. Obama-Biden Administration handed over the entire Middle East on a platter to Turkey under the guise of "Arab Spring" so I suspect Biden here is merely scoring a point against Trump by attacking a vulnerable issue..

I haven't honestly found this to be true, Sanders supporters are always very quick to drag him when he does things we don't like, including endorsing Biden.

Are you voting for Biden? If not, why are you still a racist piece of shit?
The statement "It was a debate" IS an answer. Contesting one another for their party's nomination inherently involves examining who best reflects what the party as a whole wants to offer. Notice than Biden makes a swipe back (which fails, IMO) to question Harris' record.
Biden's are a corruption machine!
Here's the exchange in its entirety. She's careful to say that she think Biden isn't a racist and that he's done other good things, but on this issue she finds his record wanting:
I agree with you, but voter suppression is one of two major factors I'm considering.   The second being that he has a unified voter base and Biden simply doesn't.
I don't drink but  it will be "Trump is a racist, bigot, xenophobic, bad man,  settle for Biden'

Biden - "listen, man, back in my day, we knew...we had to figure it out, man. the Bulgarians, they could pour the best jack and coke" and then i'd dedicate it to Felix  Trump - "that girl who made fun of Samantha's 7th grade poetry, Frumpy Lizzie, I call her... Pathetic! SAD!"
Biden‚Äôs running entirely on Not dismantling the USPS and putting Not as many children in cages and Not repealing environmental protections which, because of current events, is now enough for me
Their key to victory, off the top of my head, involves taking full advantage of the power of rumor; getting as many people as possible to know that Biden is merely an accidental conduit for what could be the first female president. Gets likers and haters talking about it nonstop.
Im too angry to follow anyone. Im so tired of reading how ppl still refuse to vote bc they think Biden is as bad as trump.
Please don‚Äôt call me a liberal. I‚Äôm a progressive who is quite a bit to the left of Bernie. And I have no faith that Biden/Harris will get anything done. If they started fighting for real fundamental changes then maybe they‚Äôd change my mind, but I don‚Äôt see that happening.
Understandable to not be thrilled with Biden/Harris. Understandable to wish you had better options. Not understandable to not vote.   And there‚Äôs no way you could possibly know that not voting won‚Äôt affect the outcome, especially given the disenfranchisement.

Because there is nothing. To be honest I doubt they care. Like 'her emails' and 'the Hunter Biden investigation' it's not the proof they need but only the accusation to plant the seed of doubt in voters minds. Too many people think if it wasn't true no one could say or print it.
Climate justice. Biden plans to spend $2 trillion, which is a start, but his other stated commitments are for 1-4 decades past the day he leaves office, so... not exactly something he can be held accountable for.

C‚Äômon, man. If you genuinely want to change people‚Äôs minds, the very least you could do is not just repeat all the same wrong talking points everyone has already heard and gone over. Biden has a very long history of defending conservatism &amp; the status quo.
Trump is the President of the United States. Biden currently holds no political office. Sit down, Karen.
This is nowhere near as ambitious as Ronald Reagan‚Äôs approach to the ozone or to thermonuclear war. Compare Biden to any pre-Y2K Republican and it gets a lot harder to say ‚Äúhe‚Äôs Progressive actually‚Äù.
The Biden / Harris ticket is a sign of change for the future of the people and democracy
And all it took was Obama calling in every marker he had to clear the field for Biden in one of the reddest states in the country, mass amounts of voter suppression and weaponize from a plague. Good job. Hope that strategy works in the general.
I do not want Biden
I‚Äôm very curious about the race/class breakdown of those who say ‚Äú4 more years of DJT might be just the thing we need to truly smash our system‚Äù / ‚ÄúBiden is no different and we‚Äôll become complacent again‚Äù. Willing to bet many (most?) of those folks are white, upper/middle class.
Trump was made possible by forty years of neoliberalism spearheaded by men like Biden taking their toll on the american people. And it‚Äôs Dems who have been complicit in putting Trump‚Äôs judges in power. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Another reason to despise Biden.
You mean Dementia Joe and Hunter Biden.
My liberal relatives all think things will be better under Biden. Nothing will convince them otherwise. All have Trump derangement syndrome and all are still falling for the lesser evil nonsense.  I hate to say it, but I really have no hope especially with climate change coming.
Because Joe Biden is beloved by the entire country! #BidenHarris2020
I‚Äôm not a Biden supporter. Obv I‚Äôm gonna vote for him, but resignedly. I am a you supporter, so that helps.  My top primary choice was  His solutions for immigration are as essential as  for climate. I‚Äôm livid neither is speaking at  convention.
Biden has killed millions. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Biden may not have Obama's intelligence, but he beats Trump's room-temperature IQ by a wide margin.
Exactly. One minute Biden is a rapist, the next minute you‚Äôre his Vice President nominee!
The fact that he is copying a Portlandia joke on day 80 or whatever... YOU WILL EAT THIS CHICKEN AND LIKE IT!!! Only thing that‚Äôs missing is a temporary Joe Biden Twitter icon

My point is there‚Äôs  a difference between his treatment by Biden and Assanges treatment by Trump.  If you don‚Äôt think the Secretary of State and VP were always instrumental in his pinning in Russia i have some bad news for you.
You made that choice when you nominated Biden. Now stop shaming Leftists and go convince your Kasich and Bloomberg fans.
Biden isn‚Äôt the greater good. Get a goddamn clue.
Joe Biden isn‚Äôt the greater good, Jane. At best, he‚Äôs an equal evil.
You are delusional about Biden. His record is to support cuts to Social Security.  If he‚Äôs elected he will cut social security like he‚Äôs promised for 40 years.  He tried to cut it under Obama too but failed. Deny reality, but you‚Äôll find out.
If you allow a broken bone to heal without first setting it right, the limb is still fucked. A Biden presidency is just that.
Joe Biden has always supported cutting social security, medicare and Medicaid.  Campaign promises are nothing, it‚Äôs his record that tells the true story.
I‚Äôm not the one who voted for the one guy who would do the worst against him in the general, Jayne. Maybe you should get to work phone banking for Biden. Quick! November is getting close.
I don't know about any of you all out there, but the saddest argument to vote for Biden over Trump is to make politics boring again.  I nearly cry at the sheer relief of that thought.  That's when I realize how much Trump has traumatized us with the constant barrage of filth.
Biden is a terd not a cake.

"It looks like the coach has made his decision and...he goes for the deflection Johnny. I really hope this play plans out for him."  Accusations that are unproven versus a reality tha exists. Interesting choice. Probably a Biden fan.
‚ÄúHe inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden. And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground.‚Äù
It‚Äôs not just Jacobin pushing Biden it‚Äôs also the communist party USA.  They are also pushing Biden.  Insane incrementalists who are obstacles to change.  The world is upside down.
When can we talk about how great Biden and Kamalas record is? I love the crime bill!! She put those evil weed smokers behind bars!!he gets re-elected.  As erratic and abrasive as Trump is, I see a Biden presidency actually weakening us in the future by putting off what should be happening now.  At this time we still have the projection to call the shots.  A built out Chinese army ends that.  End/
Lying is important to you, isn't it?
That‚Äôs kind of an aside from AOC‚Äôs Green New Deal tho. Not related. He had his own climate plan. As does Joe Biden, and most of it came from Inslee.
What? Nothing, and how about you? You literally have exactly the same amount of power as Joe Biden right now. So do I, at least until the election. All we can do is talk about it. That‚Äôs our power. For now.
Biden steps down, Hillary is appointed by DNC to head ticket, Kamala is still VP and nobody accepts the outcome.
Biden is NOT a rapist and if you haven‚Äôt noticed that woman who accused him disappeared after it was discovered she conned many people and lied repeatedly. Meanwhile, trump has gleefully bragged about his sexual assaults. Don‚Äôt be a hypocrite.
The Trump and Biden campaigns, that kind.
Let's make a deal to not prosecute Trump in the US exchange for him resigning right now. Once Biden wins in Nov. and power is transferred peacefully as the constitution mandates, we can simply refer his case to the ICC  the Hague.
Biden will do whatever the puppet masters want. His brains going.
And followed his golf game up by biting off the Biden Harris style with the dark background and flags. He tries to appear presidential and he‚Äôs just pathetically jealous the praise isn‚Äôt on him. He‚Äôs probably jealous his brother is getting more attention than his PR stunts.
I am voting against trump, not for biden. Really wish we could have had Sanders.
Dude, it‚Äôs not that complicated. Nobody voted for Biden in the 2008 primary, and nobody voted for Harris in the 2020 primary. They both ate absolute shit and then got chosen for VP, which then sets them up to run for president
Lets check, that is important.
Millions will protest! Here is the thing, Biden and Harris should never concede and insist on an independent investigation on Trump and cronies fraud and criminal activity! If it has to go to the Supreme Court, so be it! The proof should include the collusion with Russia &amp; USPS!
Trump tells Biden, "Stop playing Politics with the Virus" wait.. WHAT!??? WHAT?!!! REALLY! THATS ALL TRUMP DOES IT EVERYDAY!!!
If Biden wins, get ready for Trump to punish America ‚Äì
Thank you, Dan. I would ask why the fed. gov. has not declared the area a disaster zone &amp; provided aid, but after 4 yrs of DT doing nothing, the answer is most likely... DT's golfing, could care less &amp; is too busy attacking Biden/Harris &amp; interfering with the USPS.
It's real but it's the U.S. Mexico boarder where democrat voters are coming in to vote for Biden. The metaphor is correct though.
Photographic PROOF provided was 2014 BEFORE Trump was Prez, so non-xenophobic Obama &amp; Biden did it to God‚Äôs children. Liberal fact checkers eating crow on it &amp; we HAVE Constitutional law immigrants pledge to follow. Sharia law is unconstitutional. Patriots, not white supremesists
NYT 8/15/20: ‚Äò the history-making announcement of...Kamala Harris...still felt electrifying to Dems who donated $50 million to the Biden campaign in the two days after the pick (to put that in perspective, Mr. Biden raised just over $60 million in all of 2019).‚Äô
Give me Biden any day over death, chaos, corruption and economic devastation.
Not only that, if former Vice President Joe Biden is elected but unable to serve as president,¬†Sen. Kamala Harris will be eligible to succeed him and become the first female president!
the postal workers union also endorsed biden, i think there is something uncomfortable about public unions endorsing candidates in general.
Wow  , on day his brother dies, you say  ‚Äúinherited the great economy from Barack Obama &amp; Joe Biden‚Äù and all President Trump did was ‚Äúrun the country into the ground.‚Äù Kamalaüòî Sigh... tax reforms, dereg., trade deals, pre #COVID19, 3.5% unempl.

Joe Biden is Catholic. What are you talking about?

Democrats get the bad rap on big government. It's actually the GOP that makes the government bigger. DHS? Started by W &amp; was supposed to consolidate multiple agencies. Didn't consolidate anything. GOP keeps wages down so you can barely afford your bullets. Biden is for workers.
The guy who's leading polling quality is "not Trump". Biden winning is so disjointed from ideology
Biden/Harris aren't on anybody's side. So WTFFFF is Bernie bending over for them for.
Kamala Harris is apparently just white enough that Joe Biden doesn't hate her.
Kamala Harris advocates universal health care. Vote Biden-Harris in November.
Mr.Biden, You do not have to support the opponent party,we can defeat him by ourselves. You ought to expose&amp;reveal the hidden swiss accounts of him which CIA-USA Govt. have been blackmailing him since 2003(according to Justice Court records). This will be magnitude 9 earthquake.

Obama and Biden wouldn't fail the response to a pandemic resulting in 170,000 Americans dead. They also would never intentionally sabotage a constitutionally mandated service that every American relies on because they think it's the only way they could win the upcoming election.

People too stupid to understand the letter carrier will take your mail?  This is really a left-wing fabrication to call foul on the election if Biden loses.

Biden seizes on Trump's attack on Social Security and Medicare, while team Trump panics
Right, Biden was going to be anyone with breasts, damn the qualifications.  Brain cells are an endangered species on Fox News.
Death looms over Biden's health care plan as well. Sadly, it's not his own that I'm speaking of. I hope Democrats are happy, nominating a conservative sociopath who is going to destroy their last chance to get a real health care system.
What!? Yeah over taxes or foreign aid but she accused him of being a racist &amp; said she believed women who said they were harassed by Biden. One of Biden's accusers says he raped her.
Sounds like a well executed birthday! Well done.
Challenge accepted! I think...
I feel you for wanting a united country, but there‚Äôs far too much corruption that needs to continue to be exposed. Trump is doing that. I think we‚Äôre in a transition period. It‚Äôs not pleasant, but it‚Äôs necessary. Biden is a step in the wrong direction.
Fuck me for not being happy with the garbage fire candidate the dems forced us to take. And again, it took everyone BUT Biden dropping out early to counter Bernie, but also our primary voting system is a joke and votes went to candidates that had already dropped out.
The Undertold, Undersold Story of Kamala Harris  //Agree. It took me a while to be okay with my emotional self in a business context, but I think it is important for her to be her genuine self.
Joe Biden has never even owned stock while in public office. You went to Moscow on the 4th of July and continue to peddle misinformation for Russia despite warnings from our intelligence community. Unpatriotic. Disgraceful.
It‚Äôs totally fine for them to play safe to get votes, as long as they kick serious ass once in office. For instance, they need to shove Medicare for all down our throats, plus a bunch of other stuff. Republicans voting for Biden after a year need to feel like they made a mistake!
First thing I'm doing after Biden is inaugurated: replace my God-forsaken silver car!  Never had that problem with my old red coupe!
I love that you can trick Republicans so easily. He could‚Äôve said ‚Äúwell we‚Äôre not going to let Biden stop us from eating red dildos‚Äù and they‚Äôd all go out and buy up all the red dildos.
So...I take it you drank 2.5 of those so as not to appear overzealous?
Primary voters rejected Biden twice, then Obama made him VP. And now here we are: primary selected Biden for president. So it doesn‚Äôt seem disqualifying at all really, not if you consider the CV of guy who she‚Äôs running with.
With the election with a bait and switch with Biden . How are you ok with that ?
May 2015.  Before Trump decided that Biden was a mortal enemy.  Better example is how Trump reacted to Representative Lewis‚Äô death (I mean the real Trump, not the aide who tweeted a meaningless note on the official account).

Um, you really ought to look in the mirror and consider your role in electing Trump. You, Biden, Obama, Pelosi, the whole corrupt and sociopathic Democratic establishment is as criminal and depraved as Republicans. You should all face consequences.
Who are you lecturing here? Because it's definitely not people who aren't sure Biden can promise them a better life than they have under Trump. Sounds like people criticizing Biden's approach to those folks, who already agree that Biden is the harm reduction vote. In swing states
Notice Kamala and Biden.....They are looking down at their papers.....They knew the reporters were going to not be allowed to ask questions.  Remember that.
The video is about how the things that Hannity said about Biden apply at least as well, or maybe even better, to Trump. Is anyone confused as to this point?  Manipulated media, my Aunt Fanny!
The Republicans have no substance. They have no counter Biden-Harris, in fact, Trump himself can‚Äôt articulate what his policy on anything is. All they can do is fall back on racist and misogynist tropes. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs all they have.

Biden got around 1% of the primary vote when he was seeking the Democratic nomination in 2008. He was still a fine pick for Obama.
Some: While I can't stand  I'm voting him for the sake of harm reduction.  Me: Harm reduction for whom? You? Your anxiety and distress witnessing real America? Much harm will come under Biden, but it will be less obvious.  It's an excuse, not an argument.
Trump grabs spotlight but reclusive Biden leads polls
Biden literally IS those things, but you have your head stuck so far up the ass of MSM you can no longer see what's right in front of your face.
Hard to imagine  winning without cheating, which makes it absurd that the corrupt and crazy Republicans need to go through such extreme efforts. Merely showing Biden's horrific record should be more than enough.

Agreed. Vote for Biden.
Sounds like you want people to vote. Wouldn't it be great if there was an election for them to vote in. I'm sure Biden will take your help:
I suggested nothing of the kind. You just pulled that out of your ass. There‚Äôs no evidence that Biden is so disabled, but I‚Äôve  confidence that he‚Äôll have a cabinet who‚Äôll dutifully exercise the 25th amendment should that ever be needed. Zero confidence in the Rs on that score.

I do not believe Joe Biden sexually assaulted Tara Reade. I do believe Bill Clinton raped Juanita Broaddrick. So Reade, though a charlatan, is right about Bill.
"Just" - why? Can't do multiple things at once. Question is to Joe Biden yo do better, not to voters.
Biden is from the future :D
They're looking at the Trump/Biden polls and telling themselves that the public is mandating corporate centrism. Never mind those other polls showing 70% of Americans supporting M4A and other progressive polices. Please kill me.
Any Presidential candidates, aides or enablers who obstruct, suppress, or impede voting should be disqualified from the race. Who would like to see Biden and congress make this a law?

Well stated Sista, 100%. By selecting Bigot Biden &amp; Crime Dawg Kamala, the Dems have in effect told us Blacks to sit down &amp; shut the F up. If they respected us at all they wouldn't have put together this foul ticket, so why should we give away our vote for free. Tired of the BS
SHE RAN FOR PRESIDENT and was a US Senator before that.  If she is not eligible, many people dropped the ball before Biden nominated her.  In other words, she is eligible.
And for those outside the US, that difference is a big deal. As voters I get biting the bullet and recognizing that the GOP an incredibly dangerous, near fascist party and voting Biden. But there's a lot of work to be done for dems to be good on BOTH domestic and foreign policy
Some people on the US left really need to get real about how both parties handle foreign policy. No shit Trump is worse than Biden, and it's fine to recognize that and vote for him. That doesn't change the fact that on foreign policy the difference between dems/GOP isn't that big
Biden his time.

Holy shit, bless that reporter for putting this suggestion in his head.   If he wants to show up Obama and Biden, letting Snowden come how is a great way to do it. Just saying.
Nice! This is a good one... hilariously 100% true!  The dynamic duo of Crime Dawg Kamala &amp; Bigot Biden armed with the '94 Crime Bill are tough on crime. These cape crusaders will fill up more empty cells with, and lock-up more, black men than the Kardashians - LOL... sigh, smdh
Regarding you feeling 'insulted' abt Biden choosing a woman; NO ONE CARES ABT YOUR FEELINGS. Only a money grubbin' trumpolite would be offended. Personally, I'm offended every day that 45 is in office, tearing apart the country &amp; letting us die b/c he DOESN'T CARE.

Do I think there'll be a Biden-Harris landslide in 2020? I don't know. I hope so. After 2016, however, I'm wary. I really feel like Biden-Harris should keep fighting no matter what the polls say or how rosy things seem. The loss in 2016 hurt and our country is paying to this day.

Trump lost the state of New York by 22.5% in 2016. Current polling has him down over 25% to Biden in New York. In NYC, it is even worse. The people that know him best hate him the most.
Not me! I‚Äôm voting Biden/Harris because I am inspired.
The only good thing if Biden wins is he most likely would draft our Governor Inslee opening the door for a possible Republican Governor for the first time in years. Better yet don‚Äôt fill the position since the protesters are running things anyway!
Tbh I hate them both. But Im still voting Biden because he is nowhere NEAR as bas as trump. Im picking the lesser of two evils. Wish I could pick NO evil, but realistically thats not the case. Also at least Biden doesn't want to be a dictator so we can vote for someone else later
If Biden is more powerful than God, shouldn't we vote for Biden?
Nearly every Warren suporter, and a majority of Bernie supporters are planning to cast their votes for Biden. But we're being honest.
How many questions did biden take??
listen i was only 15? at the time but i distinctly remember people being concerned about joe biden. in fact there was a whole coalition of white women who were upset it wasn‚Äôt hillary so...
Agreed.  Once in office, I will support all the pushback against Biden for better policies.  My comment was specific to the election.
Why is Biden allowed to lie about the election process?
There's a version of this that's wearable!
The number of active voters who will sit this one out bc they reject the ticket is FAR less than the number of people who have never voted.   They don't care about politics because politics doesn't care about them.  Instead of shaming anti-Biden/Harris people -- sign up to GOTV.
So when Biden is elected, finally the USPS will have new mail trucks with heat and ac. They deserve that. #SupportUSPS
I think the internet‚Äôs category for this  is ‚ÄúGillmor Gang Reacts... ‚Äú ...to the announcement of Kamala Harris as VP on the Biden ticket
Biden has repackaged the green new deal, and in doing so, has made it palletable for middle ballot voters. I don't care what you call it, this is that plan.
Sady can't be bothered to learn what Biden/Harris support, or what's likely to pass if Democrats take the senate. We're an empty symbol to be exploited for social capital.  These are the people who truly don't care about us.
No it supposed to highlight that, while not nearly as progressive as we would like, Biden represents a much better set of policies than Trump.
I am -so- happy that you were chosen as Biden‚Äôs VP pick. Looking forward to the debates. Please get as much visibility as you safely can. Love you. We can fix this mess. #VoteBidenHarris2020

If I were Biden, my first day, I‚Äôd declare that no imagine of trump would ever be placed on any federal property. No presidential library, no postage stamp, no lying in state, no federal burial and no Secret Service. We need to recoup the billions he has stolen.
Mainly because Dems need to reinforce the narrative that this is all about the importance of the presidency. Biden/Harris is a garbage ticket and if it looks like anything could be done w/o them in office the game is up.
I'm not sure "I am so tired of this partisan BS. I'm voting Joe Biden" isn't an oxymoron. You might instead want to consider a candidate who is also tired of this partisan BS and isn't one of the partisans. Perhaps one with a stunning and only slightly-unsettling beard.

Latest #TrumpPence2020 email cites:  "From the very first day of this Administration, President Trump has fought to lower taxes, secure our borders, protect the unborn, &amp; defend our great law enforcement. Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris are promising to do the EXACT opposite."   NOT
Only if you live in a world with two choices. Then sure, give your vote to Biden and you'll see defunding everywhere. But if you elect someone who will establish a meritocracy, with an honest AG that will prosecute murderers, all this goes away. Elect me and I will give you that.
How could you have been so stupid then as to throw your support to Joe Biden? A man who is the opposite of every moral principle you've spent your life advocating. Joe is every bit as horrific as Trump, no way is he getting my vote, period.
did not expect him to endorse biden like that
Yeah but he still won that primary so the majority of the electorate on that day voted overwhelmingly for him. And that's what elections measure, how many people you can get out to vote. Biden was not a top pick of mine, but the factions of people coalescing around him
What you call ideological purity is what others see as morality. She is a pathological liar, just like Joe Biden and Donald Trump, she put innocent people in prison and kept them there on technicalities, refused to prosecute criminal bankers, and you call that helpful?
Not every independent candidate strips votes from Biden. If you want a better system, you need better inputs.  I can give you a meritocracy where the best people I can find give us the best world we could possibly ask for.
In all fairness, I'm having trouble not seeing Biden as one of the diseased "corporatists". If you are truly interested in a White House that isn't bought and paid for by special interests, you should seriously consider helping me get elected.

How, by electing the fascist regime of Biden/Harris? How do you think we got Trump? Biden's Senate career was spent pushing the crime bill, multiple versions of the PATRIOT Act, and a long line of enablements that Trump has used. #GreenParty2020

Just watched the videos on this, thanks for sharing!   Can I clarify if you think implementing M4A produces worse outcomes for Black folks overall vs. Biden's plan?  Or does M4A as a policy exacerbate the disparities you mention because it has no specific plan to address them?

That‚Äôs only if Biden voters wait until Election Day to send their ballots. We need to make sure everyone sends in ballots as early as possible, so they are waiting to be counted.
My assumption is Biden would do both. The discrimination problem is stickier to solve, and (in my view) should come along with federal preemption of state and local zoning laws + investment directly in social housing, but even giving more people access to vouchers would help.

Good read: Learning to Love Joe Biden
If Biden is the answer, what exactly was the question?
I fundamentally disagree. Biden is not a regressive candidate. He is certainly a candidate beyond his time, and his policies are not nearly as progressive as they were seen 30 years ago. But his relative leftism is a fact, if you look back in history.
The NYPD police union not only endorsed Trump, they are participating in a mini rally for him, complete with MAGA gear.  Is this what he meant when he said ‚ÄúNew York is in play‚Äù even though he trails Biden by 35 points in the polls? What does he think this endorsement gets him?

Hell froze over and Cornell West endorsed Biden/Harris too üòÆ
just in case you were wondering why so many leftists these days are happy to say that cop unions are bad actually
I think that's a major oversimplification and bad take. Biden has a career of getting legislation passed, and his time in office has shown he can get it done. What was liberal, progressive 30 years ago won't match up with today's standards.
This is a stupid strategy. If he‚Äôs already ahead in the polls; and Trump hangs himself with his own rope, or lights himself on fire with controversy; why should Biden bother?

People who were already sold on Biden think it‚Äôs great. üëçüèª cool. Again, you don‚Äôt need to convince me. I loathe the establishment who work for the donor class. None of these candidates picked by the DNC big $ donors are going to excite me. This system is corrupt. üëãüèº
You mean Biden, right? Biden‚Äôs extortion of Ukraine.  By the way, you do know that Trump took Utah in 2016, he took 45% of the vote compared to Hillary‚Äôs 27%.
This poll also reveals why it makes total sense for Trump to kneecap the USPS:  ‚ÄúBiden voters mostly say they plan to cast their vote by mail, 62% to 36%. Trump supporters, though, plan to physically go to the polls ‚Äî 72% to 24%.‚Äù
Why are you okay with hiding the man? A lot of people on here just bashing Trump or Biden. The reality is that we haven‚Äôt seen much of Biden and the American people need to see him to come to their decision. Otherwise they‚Äôre at the mercy of some PR campaign.
I hear this argument every four years. Lesser evil voting only shifts the political spectrum right. Trump is a symptom. If Biden wins he has promised #NothingWillFundamentallyChange and Trumpism will remain. The only way to defeat fascism is to organize workers and fight back.
#MAGA MAGA hat made in China. China wants trump to win. Biden hat proudly made in USA.
The GOP is hate-filled, racist, and full of lies. Biden/Harris are moderates, which is why leftists are attacking them as not being liberal enough. And the idea that only Republicans are ‚Äúreal Americans‚Äù is disgusting and a typical dog whistle to white supremacy. YOU WILL LOSE.
Saying people telling Biden to adopt more sound electoral strategies "must want Trump" is like saying Mister Miyagi was training the karate kid to lose.  You, OTOH, are watching karate kid sit around on the couch eating garbage, enabling him to do just that, and expecting a win.
Biden confused "getting played by terrible people holding onto power" with "being a great negotiator" at a formative time and he's going to die still confused
I think people aren't taking it as a joke because he's also spending a lot of time recently telling people why they should vote Biden, no?
Obama enjoyed that so much he decided to do it again with Biden and Bernie. We should name it the 'Obama move.'
Honestly I‚Äôm not interested in this circle jerk. It is what it is and their performative bs isn‚Äôt sitting well with A LOT of people. I hope Biden can pull off a win, but people are disappointed. üëçüèª
Why not Bass? Hell even Barbara Lee would be less controversial. But I get it, the Democrats are all beholden time their donors, not their constituents.
You can't redefine real Americans as a special small class of white bigots. Actual, human Americans will not permit it. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will help save America by expelling that criminal from the White House.
I don‚Äôt believe the way to stop that is uncritical support for the Democrats. Joe Biden is going to lose if we don‚Äôt raise some demands and force him to move to the left. All that loser has to do is embrace #M4A, a policy with broad popular support and he‚Äôll win in a landslide.
If Biden was President, there would not be 168,000 dead from a virus Trump called a Democrat hoax.   If Biden were President unemployment would not be over 10% and the GDP would not have suffered the largest quarter loss in history.
So your argument is for incrementalism with Biden?

And Joe Biden stay on that touching little children inappropriately and a racist. That is all. PS: Harris being on his ticket don't mean shit.
Yes, but I'm referring to the way she talks policy in debates and on the stage in general. I find it off-putting. Anyone can have a ghost writer fill out policy notes online. You think Biden writes all his own policy on his website? I'm concerned with how a candidate conveys it.
Why does the Biden campaign say voting by mail is safe when Trump is actively trying to sabotage it? Why charge $9 for shipping a yard sign? No door to door GOTV. This feels like Hillary all over again. Stop celebrating. Start fighting as hard as Lincoln Project.

Dude, they're not going to commit to it.  Biden has said over and over that he won't. And that it won't even get to his desk if he was president.
If there are debates, Joe Biden is going to get destroyed by Trump. Probably why the Dems are trying to not have them.
From the news this morning, he's trying to compensate for still more bad news confirming his 2016 campaign's lying about their contacts with Russia. Probably more to come. His whole Obama/Biden treason nonsense seems quaint as a counter.
Right. I think she will be great. We just have to work to get Biden elected. And I personally think it will be difficult, Trump will try every trick.
I keep hearing people saying:  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm indeperndant or liberal but I‚Äôm not voting for Biden.‚Äù   From a practical point of view, That means you are voting for Trump.
After Trump, our entire legal system will need an overhaul.  And that's why we need to win by a huge margin ... So that the House, Senate, and the new Biden administration have the mandate to restore our constitutional system of checks and balances.  DESTROY THE GOP. üò°
How about being truthful and state that our intelligence service concludes that Russia wants Trump and China wants Biden.  That said focus on your accomplishments these last 4 years.  Difficult task, I realize, but it's what matters most to voters.
From here on out, anything that is anti-Biden/Harris is pro-GOP and pro-Trump.  If you help the fascist GOP win, more immigrants will die in our camps, their children separated from parents, COVID will kill millions of us, no hope of real change.  STOP HELPING FASCISTS.

It is fairly amusing to watch, in real time, the mental gymnastics my progressive friends are having to go through to REALLY try and pretend to be excited about a Biden/Harris ticket.  It‚Äôs okay guys. I‚Äôd be upset too.
Biden is a status quo candidate at best, and a weak/unwilling opposition to the shifting of the Overton window further towards authoritarianism at worst.  ‚ÄúModerate‚Äù (center-right) candidates only serve as accomplices to far right wing atrocities.

You objected to me refering to Biden as an appalling human-being.  All that horrific stuff waved through by Trump and Obama will be waved through by Biden.  It is appalling, and it's not normal that sociopathy should be rewarded with power. It should be perpetually pointed out.
*Always* in politics there's good reason why a politician had no choice but to be the bad guy, it just keeps happening!  Yeah, this piece addresses some of things you mention.
The US has a population of 330 mil, the majority of whom are not the bigoted, warmongering sociopaths that Biden &amp; Trump are.  A functioning democracy would not elevate these people to the position of most powerful person on the planet - it's insane.  US imperialism is appalling.

Whatever the intention of the cartoonist, I didn't read that.  I see Biden as Trump's ideological Democrat equivalent - which he pretty much is.  I guess a reading of the cartoon is dependent on how you feel about corrupt, racist, sexist US politics; and how Biden fits into that.
Biden's racism is generally less overt, but it's not hidden, he has a long political history that's filled with similar ideological positions as Trump.  Both are on the right, both back belligerent, imperialist foreign policy .  If you're into that, fine.

"The majority of us don't want M4A" is patently false. You must just have the wrong information there. Enough people want it that not supporting it means you're mot for the greater good. Also what reason do you have to believe Biden cares about this country?
When you have no policies to be able to promote as the Biden/Harris campaign, the corporate media will promote a weird Marge Simpson fights back narrative for you.

Just because I'm voting for Biden doesn't mean I won't criticize him or try to hold him to a higher standard. I won't defend his flaws or pretend he's perfect.  Trump supporters cannot say the same. Their existence depends on ignoring 90% of his actions and justifying the rest
I'm of the, I think that the left is still too weak to withstand the accelerated slide into fascism so I'll vote for Biden in the hopes of avoiding that, but I'm never going to admonish someone for not doing so.

You‚Äôre missing it. Enthusiasm. Dem models assumed Obama style black turnout. They didn‚Äôt show. Will they show for old man segregationist ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt black‚Äù Biden? Doubt it.  Trumps numbers are higher than Mitt and McCain among black vote. He will win.
Can‚Äôt wait!  Buddy of mine in Texas said he saw lots of Obama and Hillary signs in Dallas.  Hasn‚Äôt seen a single Biden sign.  You betta hope blacks get off the couch in Milwaukee for the old man!!  üòÇ  I can‚Äôt see it.
So, does this mean you will vote Biden-Harris?
Let this thread be an object lesson for Bernie Sanders and other Democrats in a Biden-Harris administration.  Come together and get things done. Better to be roughly right than precisely wrong.
Novogratz Says Stock-Market Bubble Will Probably¬†Pop If Biden Wins
Voting isn‚Äôt binary!!  Biden earn votes by supporting popular policies that help out the majority of voters... Medicare for all, ending wars, free college. Strengthening anti trust. Breaking up the banks...  A Trump win is the DEMOCRATIC parties fault. Never the voters..
If it makes you feel any better, the USPS Postal Workers Union has endorsed Biden.
We need national leadership during this health crisis, looking for Biden/Harris to give us the direction.
The Hill's Campaign Report: Biden, Harris make first public appearance as running mates
Or, he'll just wait for rapist Uncle Joe to pardon him. There is no way a criminal like Joe Biden pisses off the Republicans he so loves by sending Trump to jail, plus he doesn't want to end up in prison at the end of his crime spree. I'd prefer to burn the nation down.
Look we all get it,economic hardship based upon phoney lockdowns IS the Biden campaign. It‚Äôs their only hope, your Hail Mary. Try not to pretend otherwise it‚Äôs transparent. Americans will decide if Trump or a frail old man losing his mind and selling tax hikes can restart economy
Interesting: if Biden would call for Postal Service banking (an excellent idea, IMO); that means that banking, check cashing, &amp; payday-loan interests have a very strong incentive to see the USPS demolished before Biden can be elected.
M4A &amp; GND are equally important to me. Biden has done nothing, but give us the finger on these...and many other...issues.
If Trump would have led, we would be out of this pandemic, the strongest economy and 80% support regardless of party. There would be no Biden or Kamala -- However, his narcissism, incessant tweets and all about him attitude has us where we are. He never works: Golf, Tweeter, TV.
The trumpers don't harass me nearly as badly or as often as Biden supporters. They are fucking BRUTAL!
Thanks! I had defended him from people that were shaming him BC he was voting for Biden. I didn't even agree with him, but supported his right to vote for whomever he felt he needed to. That was a complete betrayal. Then he started talking shit about me to the vote shamers!
Really now?
I can't knock Joe Biden.  Some of the best years of my life were in the 3rd grade.

Well f*** this and Joe Biden.   Biden-Harris:  the ultimate police state solution.  Enjoy your civil liberties while you still got them.
It's interesting that the loser known as Joe Biden picked another loser who had to end her campaign of lies and performative expressions of outrage.
That is still a tautology not an argument:  What will anyone accomplish by not voting for Biden?  What is the outcome that will happen?   What is the change that will happen?
Sure did. He said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a Biden fan, I‚Äôll have to plug my nose to vote for him.‚Äù Dude, this is exactly why you are perpetually single!!! üí©for BRAINS.
you also, still, have not explain why voting for anyone but Biden is going to meaningfully make any change, at all, ever. We know, absolutely, that third party stuff doesn't do it. It hasn't in the past, it won't in the future. So that argument is closed I'm afraid

Ok so the point here was to bring up a question vaush has answered *extensively* in order to prove a point that has already been disproven?  Biden has moved left, a lot, thanks in part to Bernies massive, massive popularity.
I put the ‚ÄúTrump discount‚Äù in the polls at minimum 8 points.  So if Biden has a 4 point lead in FLA, he‚Äôs ahead by about 4. Biden camp knows this which is why they‚Äôre panicking on mail in.

And that‚Äôs to say nothing of the millions upon millions of recovered people with antibodies. Get the virus, move on.  Or hide under your bed for ten years.  We all know it: the lockdown IS the Biden campaign.

I disagree, Biden will be a 1 term president but he‚Äôll do fine. It‚Äôs why he won the primary by a land slide bedause he works between republicans and democrats where as no other candidate could.
I bet he is  a Biden supporter
There has been a lot of misery caused by your father the last 3 1/2 years. The best hope is the Biden DOJ will assign a special counsel to investigate the Trump crime family and the outcome will be a number of them will serve a prison sentence.
Biden makes Trump look like a idiot when it comes to real issues. Trump is only good at trolling.
Having a great accountant does not equate to being mentally incapable of remembering where you are Joe Biden.
So, here's the thing about Biden/Harris. Neither one has been great to the trans community: my friends, my family, myself. Obviously voting against fascists is good but I'm not excited about it. Duopoly systems are crap.
It's not journalists' job to do propoganda on behalf of a political figure or party - if it were, we would no longer be a free country. If one critical article is, to you, akin to a lynching or a coup against Biden, I think you may need to reflect on the skew in your perspective.
Ok hear me out.  Biden is part of the Demon Slayer Corps and that's why he sniffs people all the time.

Biden will tax your Cap Gains heavily. Your rebuttal?
But even then, *absolute* worst case in Florida is that an additional 2% of GE ballots miss the cutoff. So if those are 75-25 Biden it cuts his margin by 1%. But I'm skeptical 100% of the "last two days" ballots would not make it.

Fox News said they don‚Äôt expect Biden to be around in Nov. They just had a feeling. And bc Trump likes to follow the dictators handbook, jailing his opponents seems like a natural next step. Fake a crime and have your cronies lock him up. Russia probably working on ‚Äúevidence‚Äù now

I don't need to be reminded how horrible Donald Trump and the Republicans are, I'm well aware. We had many choices, Joe Biden was one of the worse. I hoped we would go with Bernie and fight for real change, so settle and get nothing for it.  5/10
Many have approached me about details about a friend I mentioned who was victimized by Joe Biden. I nearly told the story, which is not mine to tell, against the victim's wishes, out of anger. As much as I want justice, violating this person's trust ...  1/10
Killing civilians with drone warfare is a war crime. And why would I want Biden to hate Jews? I know you hate palestinians and Muslims but try to look past your hatred for a second
You are right. That is why we are voting for Biden.
You do realize that that is exactly what Biden and Harris are doing as well, right? They will do anything at all cost to win. That‚Äôs what is expected.
Me thinks triumphant profiles of Biden Campaign staff is premature.
If trump wasn‚Äôt working to steal the election is never want mail to be handled by corps like ups + fedex. We may have no other choice which is the only reason I‚Äôd encourage those companies to step in. If the usps was too far gone - then Biden can then reinstate the usps.

He did if you voted for him, and Biden‚Äôs gonna lose anyway. The vote is going to be as messed up as it has ever been this year. Privilege is saying it‚Äôs okay to settle for four more years of the same while people die, ass
That's simply not true.  Biden and Harris have both been quoted as saying that they're for confiscations; not to mention their 100% Open-Borders and "*Free Everything" policies, which are patently absurd.  Take back the DNC from the socialists.
I used my real name on my original account and was doxxed for making some jerk in Vegas unhappy.
No, that's not what's being said at all. Example: medically vulnerable people I know will suffer greatly under trump, but their funds and access will expand greatly under biden (via ACA, which worked better for them) - it's not a catch-all but you can't say that's not better
If anyone on the Biden campaign can't figure out that Trump's insults against Harris are a way of baiting her into unnecessary responses which in turn elevate her overall visibility above Biden's... then they deserve what's coming next.
"Healing" on the day after Trump engineered a Mideast reconciliation and on the day Hillary announces she would happily serve in a Biden Administration. Thanks, John.
No, I'm not. I'm saying Trump is very very bad, may even ruin democracy permanently, but Biden, while having similar policies in some areas (not many) will give us time to fight for the agenda we all really want, without risking lives under trump
I honestly think there's nothing funny about Biden's cognitive decline and it very much should be something people should consider when casting their vote. One of many factors.
But this is okay???
You don‚Äôt have to be in mental decline with a fetish for sniffing kids to vote for Biden, but you have to be comfortable with someone in mental decline who likes sniffing kids to vote for Biden.
But like- didn‚Äôt Biden win Black voters in the primary?  What am I missing?

Biden may have grown up in the Catholic church, but let me assure you he is not Catholic.  He is an unapologetic accessory to the murder of over 55,000,000 people.
If Biden is elected, the Administration will be full of vengeance. They will not tolerate "peaceful" protests, there will be camps/prisons for political dissidents. Once their revolution is complete, no more revolutions allowed. Thats how authoritarian gvmts roll.

Voting for Biden and Harris does not mean they are perfect. It is simply what needs to be done. Accountability will still be held.

People who say that voting for Biden is the same thing as voting for Trump are trying to convince you not to vote... which is the same thing as voting for Trump. Our enemies are still hard at work interfering in our elections.

7 times Kamala Harris effortlessly proved just how incompetent Trump really is
After learning more about Harris, I'm legitimately getting pissed off. The problem is, we don't have a choice. We have terrible options, but we need to stop dividing the vote. Any vote not for Biden is a vote for Trump. I hate it. We cannot survive another Trump term.
My stance is very dependent on where I am. This is a rock solid, unshakeable blue state. Biden WILL win. My vote has zero impact on the actual election. Therefore, my vote is not a forced choice, it's an endorsement. And I STRONGLY feel none of the 3 options deserve that.
Biden literally doesn't even support legalizing marijuana, and Kama'lock-em-up Harris built an entire career out of throwing innocent people in prison for victimless crimes
I see no compelling reason to vote for either. Biden/Harris is an absolutely atrocious pair I agree with on *nothing,* and Jorgensen/Cohen is an absolutely pathetic, laughable ticket of completely unqualified nobodies with zero credibility (not to mention Jo is cringe af)
There is no chance of Biden losing Washington. My vote is not relevant to the outcome of the election and is not a case of harm reduction or forced preference, it's a case of making a normative endorsement of a particular candidate/ticket
Sorry folks it‚Äôs been taken down off her twitter and is no longer there.  So I can‚Äôt prove. I saw the video myself and was impressed. Well if someone recorded it, they will post it.  No poof- but I remember her saying is ‚ÄúBiden is an old man, an old racist‚Äù.

I appreciate the explanation, as that‚Äôs not what I took from your earlier tweets. I agree pressure from the left should/will shape the campaign &amp; administration. It seems it has already, as Biden has moved that way (some) - whether through Bernie or progressives in the streets.
To all the "apples to oranges" people out there:  Obama and Biden didn't downplay Ebola, call it a hoax, or tell us that it would magically disappear - they did their jobs.  Trump can't handle a crisis because he's mentally impaired.  That's why we have 165K+ dead from #COVID19.

I'm honestly less concerned about conservative voters and more concerned at the perfect candidate crowd that has paid zero fucking attention to actual history. Look, I'm no Biden fan or Harris fan. But I know how they will pick better justices than Pence/Trump.
Harris is unmoored in her ambition, unmoored meaning zero scruples in what she will do to further Kamala Harris. And she will be the prez as Biden will exit soon after the election. She is radical, angry, and wants power.
Gonna tell my kids this was Joe Biden's running mate
No, the premise of your question is faulty. There is no evidence to believe that Biden will behave the same way as Trump. No evidence that Biden will continue the process of destroying the country and attempting to turn it into a right-wing authoritarian dictatorship.

Bernie supporters were happy to say ‚Äúto hell with Bernie‚Äù after he endorsed Biden &amp; was unable to get him to move meaningfully left. Shocked the pundits who thought he was a ‚Äúcult leader‚Äù, but we were never a cult of personality (great track CM Punk forever) but a cult of policy.
Did she say she isn't voting? She's not voting Biden or Trump. There are other options. And choosing not to vote for president is still a choice. Still her decision. And one she doesn't have to state.
White "leftists" going on and on about how they can't morally vote for Biden.
There's no way I could vote for Biden. Zero. His values do not represent mine. At one time, that was true of Tom, too.
You and Bernie was my dream ticket, but Ill take you and Biden over The Pumpkin and The Pence any day. Can't wait for VP Debate #VoteBidenHarris2020
Why have I seen zero campaigning by Biden? By this time in the Obama campaign people were composing songs. Do you really all think Trump is going to lose? Did you notice that you were sure he was going to lose last time?
- excellent piece on   and bravo to Joe Biden.  Her long and dedicated career ‚Äúfor the people‚Äù &amp; yes she will be a wonderful VP and Klobuchar‚Äôs analogy of the NASA‚Äôs women beautifully depicted in ‚ÄúHidden Figures‚Äù was spot on &amp; it‚Äôs VERY EXCITING
Bottom line is that I believe in her and her ideas and I'm happy that so many of them are being adopted by Biden. She has and will continue to work hard in the name of public service because she knows it's not about her. It's about us. She has my support in all she does.
It makes sense Harris would be Biden‚Äôs pick, nothing sells politics today better than a vagina. #gop #fakenews #ObamaGate #Kavanaugh
It is okay to be excited about Kamala Harris. She has changed her tune about LGBTQ people in the last few years which is good. Doesn't mean she isn't problematic, just like Biden. Regardless both of them are significantly better than the garbage currently in the Oval Office.
Perfect is the enemy of the good. For marginalized people there's a huge difference between Trump/Pence v Biden/Harris. For privileged liberals maybe not so much.
I still haven't forgotten how Biden treated Anita Hill.   Moving forward doesn't mean anything is forgotten.   I'm still voting #BidenHarris2020 .
Thank you, Juan. And for those privileged lefties at Counterpunch and the like who want the perfect and the pure it's time for them to get on board because for marginalized people (not privileged people like them) there' a HUGE difference between Biden/Harris v Trump/Pence.
...If 45 loses, there's still the damage done: fires of hatred stoked into cultural conflagrations; how much we've hastened the destruction of a habitable world; how we've alienated allies &amp; become a global joke. We need more than Biden/Harris‚Äîwe need a love revolution. ...
Why the fuck did Biden pick a cop as his running mate? Is he trying to lose this election?
So Kamala's Biden's running mate, I'm not surprised, just disappointed.
OK, it's really great that Harris has this immigrant background and is making history etc. etc. TBH I'm far more interested in (a) can she help Biden beat Trump? and (b) what are the policies she will fight for going forward?
As much as I've been stanning Warren since 2016, I fully support Harris on the ticket with Biden.  I will vote #BidenHarris2020  with a big smile on my face.   With a blue wave in the Senate, Warren can thrive and work to unfuck Trump's fuckery. I'd love her 2b next Sen Maj Ldr.
Watching season 2 of Alf and they are making references to Joe Biden running for President. It‚Äôs kind of cool that Alf was ahead of its time. #Alf
She is to the left of Biden, and can be ruthless, so I think she the brawler.
Not shown here: Obama winning #NE02  Joe Biden and Kamala Harris can win it again.
I just made my first political donation, ever. Plus, I bought a Biden/Harris t-shirt. Now I want to punch a Nazi right in the fucking throat.
She‚Äôs the one that slept with Willie Brown as part of a patronage job, right?   Called running mate Hidin‚Äô Biden a racist?   Believes in Socialized medicine?   Hasn‚Äôt condemned the rioters?   Wants to defund police?   An inspired pick! TRUMP 2020 - MAGA!

Joe Biden, like myself own guns.  Quit while you are ahead before the NRA goes into bankruptcy.
Kamala Harris is an incredibly strong, gifted public servant who will help write our history. She's also a savvy, talented politician and exactly who Joe Biden needs to win in a landslide. #MVP   Election night 2008 was incredible. It can happen again this fall. Let's make it so.
Everyone‚Äôs frustrated and taking solace in others verbalizing it. Honestly anyone Biden might pick would prompt a similar torrent of bile (for similar reasons; this whole campaign has been Dems telling us to get bent).
"Vote Blue No Matter Who" is literally the exact same kind of totalitarian rhetoric that got us in the CURRENT mess, especially given a Biden/Harris ticket with Pete Buttigieg on the cabinet is indistinguishable in policy terms from Bush/Cheney with Paul Wolfowitz on the cabinet
Biden is the worst recent candidate except for Trump and Hillary. We were screwed before we even voted last time and this time.
More than stepped up: formed a lasting and deep friendship and comraderie among peers that the current administration is sorely lacking it its servile adoration of the President.   I‚Äôll happily vote for Biden/Harris. They weren‚Äôt my first choices, but they‚Äôre good ones.
I also think it says a good things about Biden that he looked past the clashes they had in debates (and the crappy advice he‚Äôs apparently been getting from his friends that they‚Äôve been leaking to the press).
Harris is a pretty good choice. She doesn‚Äôt bring much regionality (Biden is going to win California, regardless), but she‚Äôs a smart, thoughtful, and dedicated public servant who represents groups that Dems have taken for granted for far too long.
Not surprised. They agree on prosecution and incarceration. She is smart and has a quick wit. Biden desperately needs a defender and attack dog on his ticket.
Exactly. Warren supporter that will vote Biden because it's the right thing to do even though I'm not a fan of him.
It's gonna be Biden or Trump. Biden is not ideal but there's nothing to think about. Very few could be worse than Trump...
The State Department is going to need some massive rebuilding. Also, sanctions on Russia and Saudi Arabia need to be harsh and comprehensive. I hope Biden and Harris make that a priority.
Both she and Biden make noises about police reform, but Biden has said he supports community policing, which actually increases the budget/scope of policing. We need to be moving the other direction. Here's hoping they listen to the Black organizers who are pushing for change!
The available choices for the positions in the Biden administration are just delicious.  Attny General, Secretary of Treasury, Speaker of the House, Senate Majority Leader.  Strategic decisions need to be ready to go at the time of the inauguration.
Literally no one is doing this. We are all fucking terrified, and actually dealing with REAL LIFE consequences of the current administration. We can‚Äôt afford to be fucking intellectual about this. A Biden/Harris vote buys us some time to start to heal. It doesn‚Äôt end the fight.
I can find way more pics of Dumb Don with Ghislane Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstien than Biden. #TRUMPLIVESONPEDOISLAND
That would work, too, I just think she's so good with legislation that she'd be perfect at getting the right bills on Biden's desk. I don't trust Schumer for that at all.
Dude, I was already going to vote Biden/Harris, you don't have to sell it so hard
Okay cool cool, Biden/Harris - these folx want our vote, and are a heck of a lot better than the other choice, obvi. Let's push them towards abolition in the next few months, huh?
So vote for Trump to guarantee that Biden/Harris don‚Äôt get elected.
Unless I‚Äôm badly mistaken,  is talking about a formal vote as a delegate, only on the platform.  It really is a completely separate issue from voting for Biden or not.  That said: Blind, knee-jerk ‚Äúthe Party is always right no matter what they do‚Äù used to be the USSR.
Hey #DonnieDimwit...at least Kamala can put together a coherent sentence. Something I have yet to see you do. You can't even read a teleprompter. LOL!  I can hardly wait to see the upcoming debates! Biden/Harris are going to wipe the floor up with you and Pency.
Well, it's Kamala Harris for Biden's Veep. So there's that...
I am not a big fan of either  Biden or Harris.  Do I think they can stomp tRump? You betcha. Do I think things will change dramatically? Yes &amp; no.  Do I think Gov't action will be more in alignment with my beliefs with them in office? Fvck yes!
Joe Biden didn't pick anyone. His handlers did.
Yeah, Biden/Harris are notorious socialists.
Yeah, I caucused for Bernie in 2016, and canvassed for him this year. I definitely hope Biden wins! But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll actually change much more than tone, and comes with another likely problem‚Äîwhite people feel comfortable again and stop engaging in politics.
You're wise beyond your years CJ.  Kamala bends with the wind.  If Biden wins, Kamala will be POTUS in 3-weeks to 90 days, and that is why she is his running mate.
That's good once in a while. Its Hot in CT but its August so that's not news. Wait Biden picked a running mater.
i love how harris was trying to beat biden n call him a racist and now has to act like nothing happened rofl both loserz
I would have liked Kamala to choose Biden as the VP- but I will take this for sure.
Once Biden promised a black woman as his VP, it kind of had to be Harris. She was the only in-the-box choice (statewide officeholder), and Biden can't afford to go out of the box.
Biden will wipe the floor in a debate with you. It's no contest. Add in a Senator Harris debate against Pence? Cherry on top. ü§£ #BidenHarris2020
No, the tough choice is Biden and Kamala. I thought you were responding to my response to a poll by  asking which of the FOUR you‚Äôd prefer to be president. And even considering it a two option poll of JUST Biden &amp; Harris, I cant decide.
I‚Äôm a little surprised! Apparently she quit following the Biden campaign on Twitter a few days ago so I thought ‚Äúwhew, at least it‚Äôs not Kamala!‚Äù
Lets' do this. Biden/Harris 2020.
It‚Äôs the definition of harm reduction. All four of them are bad news for most Americans. Trump and Pence far worse, sure. But even considering Chris‚Äô post a two-option poll and to choose between Biden and Kamala is also a choice I struggle with. Both suck for their own reasons.
Trump‚Äôs gonna get re-elected üòî    #CaliforniaFriends   Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate

Who's Biden and what team is he being traded to?
Biden's VP was the candidates we met along the way
Not sure how I ever wound up following this guy but I'm blocking him now.  Not voting for Biden is the same as voting for Trump.  Our enemies are going to focus their efforts on this disinformation tactic the closer we get to November.  Don't be a Dave. Don't buy into it.
When Joe Biden is President,we will
I don't know what they may want from Biden, but I do expect all of them to return to promoting Republican candidates.  They'll find some to dust off and sanitize, make it look like there's a new and reformed R party in the future.  Humbug.
Robin Williams roasts Donald Trump in resurfaced clips
If you lubricate the windmill with #Hydroxychloroquine then it won't make that cancer-causing noise. But Biden is against energy, so there's that.
If Biden is elected all border enforcement action by the CBP and other LE will stop, so tunnels will be unnecessary anyways.

Tamara Keith and Amy Walter on Biden in the spotlight, pandemic aid politics
Jill Biden is lovely!
They are both old outta touch douche bags. Ridicule both with same measure.  Also, not everything is Biden:Trump There is no ‚Äúparity‚Äù
There's much more to the presidency than the online culture war. A President Biden doesn't mean whities are going to start being hanged. Wisdom regarding international relations, particularly with our allies, is quite a few rungs higher on the ladder.
Biden's mental faculties have slipped, no doubt. But like I said, the people on his team, including the VP, will be miles better than the current resident in the White House. Any lip service they pay to progressives is just that, lip service.
Unfortunately there really are no other viable options. Tbh, to get the current occupant out, I'd be happy with a "Weekend at Biden's" presidency, as I know he'll have basically centrist advisors around him. It would have been a much tougher call if there was a far left candidate
2 morons in one
Thank you so much And honored
Is Biden being blackmailed? Black male leaders warn Biden ‚Äòwill lose‚Äô election if he doesn't name Black female running mate
That will prolly get her USAG if Biden gets in.
Guarantee Trump will schedule a speech or press conference as soon as it looks like Biden is about to announce. It's like clockwork. Anything to distract and draw the spotlight back on him. The media needs to pledge to ignore it, whatever it is
I just checked-so is Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi.
This is rich.   The worldview Biden represents has heavily relied since 1945 on the courts and bureaucracy overriding the popular will.   When democracy goes against the left, they denounce it as ‚Äúpopulism.‚Äùhe gets re-elected.  As erratic and abrasive as Trump is, I see a Biden presidency actually weakening us in the future by putting off what should be happening now.  At this time we still have the projection to call the shots.  A built out Chinese army ends that.  End/
Lying is important to you, isn't it?
That‚Äôs kind of an aside from AOC‚Äôs Green New Deal tho. Not related. He had his own climate plan. As does Joe Biden, and most of it came from Inslee.
What? Nothing, and how about you? You literally have exactly the same amount of power as Joe Biden right now. So do I, at least until the election. All we can do is talk about it. That‚Äôs our power. For now.
Biden steps down, Hillary is appointed by DNC to head ticket, Kamala is still VP and nobody accepts the outcome.
Biden is NOT a rapist and if you haven‚Äôt noticed that woman who accused him disappeared after it was discovered she conned many people and lied repeatedly. Meanwhile, trump has gleefully bragged about his sexual assaults. Don‚Äôt be a hypocrite.
The Trump and Biden campaigns, that kind.
Let's make a deal to not prosecute Trump in the US exchange for him resigning right now. Once Biden wins in Nov. and power is transferred peacefully as the constitution mandates, we can simply refer his case to the ICC  the Hague.
And followed his golf game up by biting off the Biden Harris style with the dark background and flags. He tries to appear presidential and he‚Äôs just pathetically jealous the praise isn‚Äôt on him. He‚Äôs probably jealous his brother is getting more attention than his PR stunts.
I am voting against trump, not for biden. Really wish we could have had Sanders.
Dude, it‚Äôs not that complicated. Nobody voted for Biden in the 2008 primary, and nobody voted for Harris in the 2020 primary. They both ate absolute shit and then got chosen for VP, which then sets them up to run for president
Lets check, that is important.
Millions will protest! Here is the thing, Biden and Harris should never concede and insist on an independent investigation on Trump and cronies fraud and criminal activity! If it has to go to the Supreme Court, so be it! The proof should include the collusion with Russia &amp; USPS!
Trump tells Biden, "Stop playing Politics with the Virus" wait.. WHAT!??? WHAT?!!! REALLY! THATS ALL TRUMP DOES IT EVERYDAY!!!
If Biden wins, get ready for Trump to punish America ‚Äì
Thank you, Dan. I would ask why the fed. gov. has not declared the area a disaster zone &amp; provided aid, but after 4 yrs of DT doing nothing, the answer is most likely... DT's golfing, could care less &amp; is too busy attacking Biden/Harris &amp; interfering with the USPS.
It's real but it's the U.S. Mexico boarder where democrat voters are coming in to vote for Biden. The metaphor is correct though.
NYT 8/15/20: ‚Äò the history-making announcement of...Kamala Harris...still felt electrifying to Dems who donated $50 million to the Biden campaign in the two days after the pick (to put that in perspective, Mr. Biden raised just over $60 million in all of 2019).‚Äô
Give me Biden any day over death, chaos, corruption and economic devastation.
Not only that, if former Vice President Joe Biden is elected but unable to serve as president,¬†Sen. Kamala Harris will be eligible to succeed him and become the first female president!
the postal workers union also endorsed biden, i think there is something uncomfortable about public unions endorsing candidates in general.
if you vote Biden imma assume you touch kids
Joe Biden is Catholic. What are you talking about?
And if Biden somehow doesn't make it to election day?
Democrats get the bad rap on big government. It's actually the GOP that makes the government bigger. DHS? Started by W &amp; was supposed to consolidate multiple agencies. Didn't consolidate anything. GOP keeps wages down so you can barely afford your bullets. Biden is for workers.
The guy who's leading polling quality is "not Trump". Biden winning is so disjointed from ideology
Biden/Harris aren't on anybody's side. So WTFFFF is Bernie bending over for them for.
Kamala Harris is apparently just white enough that Joe Biden doesn't hate her.
Kamala Harris advocates universal health care. Vote Biden-Harris in November.
Mr.Biden, You do not have to support the opponent party,we can defeat him by ourselves. You ought to expose&amp;reveal the hidden swiss accounts of him which CIA-USA Govt. have been blackmailing him since 2003(according to Justice Court records). This will be magnitude 9 earthquake.

Obama and Biden wouldn't fail the response to a pandemic resulting in 170,000 Americans dead. They also would never intentionally sabotage a constitutionally mandated service that every American relies on because they think it's the only way they could win the upcoming election.

Death looms over Biden's health care plan as well. Sadly, it's not his own that I'm speaking of. I hope Democrats are happy, nominating a conservative sociopath who is going to destroy their last chance to get a real health care system.
What!? Yeah over taxes or foreign aid but she accused him of being a racist &amp; said she believed women who said they were harassed by Biden. One of Biden's accusers says he raped her.
Sounds like a well executed birthday! Well done.
Challenge accepted! I think...
I feel you for wanting a united country, but there‚Äôs far too much corruption that needs to continue to be exposed. Trump is doing that. I think we‚Äôre in a transition period. It‚Äôs not pleasant, but it‚Äôs necessary. Biden is a step in the wrong direction.
Fuck me for not being happy with the garbage fire candidate the dems forced us to take. And again, it took everyone BUT Biden dropping out early to counter Bernie, but also our primary voting system is a joke and votes went to candidates that had already dropped out.
The Undertold, Undersold Story of Kamala Harris  //Agree. It took me a while to be okay with my emotional self in a business context, but I think it is important for her to be her genuine self.
Joe Biden has never even owned stock while in public office. You went to Moscow on the 4th of July and continue to peddle misinformation for Russia despite warnings from our intelligence community. Unpatriotic. Disgraceful.
It‚Äôs totally fine for them to play safe to get votes, as long as they kick serious ass once in office. For instance, they need to shove Medicare for all down our throats, plus a bunch of other stuff. Republicans voting for Biden after a year need to feel like they made a mistake!
First thing I'm doing after Biden is inaugurated: replace my God-forsaken silver car!  Never had that problem with my old red coupe!
I love that you can trick Republicans so easily. He could‚Äôve said ‚Äúwell we‚Äôre not going to let Biden stop us from eating red dildos‚Äù and they‚Äôd all go out and buy up all the red dildos.
So...I take it you drank 2.5 of those so as not to appear overzealous?
Primary voters rejected Biden twice, then Obama made him VP. And now here we are: primary selected Biden for president. So it doesn‚Äôt seem disqualifying at all really, not if you consider the CV of guy who she‚Äôs running with.
With the election with a bait and switch with Biden . How are you ok with that ?

Um, you really ought to look in the mirror and consider your role in electing Trump. You, Biden, Obama, Pelosi, the whole corrupt and sociopathic Democratic establishment is as criminal and depraved as Republicans. You should all face consequences.
Who are you lecturing here? Because it's definitely not people who aren't sure Biden can promise them a better life than they have under Trump. Sounds like people criticizing Biden's approach to those folks, who already agree that Biden is the harm reduction vote. In swing states
Notice Kamala and Biden.....They are looking down at their papers.....They knew the reporters were going to not be allowed to ask questions.  Remember that.
The video is about how the things that Hannity said about Biden apply at least as well, or maybe even better, to Trump. Is anyone confused as to this point?  Manipulated media, my Aunt Fanny!

Trump grabs spotlight but reclusive Biden leads polls
Biden literally IS those things, but you have your head stuck so far up the ass of MSM you can no longer see what's right in front of your face.
Hard to imagine  winning without cheating, which makes it absurd that the corrupt and crazy Republicans need to go through such extreme efforts. Merely showing Biden's horrific record should be more than enough.

I do not believe Joe Biden sexually assaulted Tara Reade. I do believe Bill Clinton raped Juanita Broaddrick. So Reade, though a charlatan, is right about Bill.
"Just" - why? Can't do multiple things at once. Question is to Joe Biden yo do better, not to voters.
They're looking at the Trump/Biden polls and telling themselves that the public is mandating corporate centrism. Never mind those other polls showing 70% of Americans supporting M4A and other progressive polices. Please kill me.
Any Presidential candidates, aides or enablers who obstruct, suppress, or impede voting should be disqualified from the race. Who would like to see Biden and congress make this a law?

Joe Biden is a corporate, conservative, racist, and sexual predator who was born with terminal asshole syndrome. He won't let anyone with morals into his administration. Good news for Ivanka Trump, though, she can probably stay.
Ohhh yeah. Mostly Culp, decent number of Trump, a couple Tim Eyman. One Biden sign in the Port Angeles Democrat's office.
Joe Biden‚Äô s America would like  this shit . White people  guilty  forever  before  blacks.
Well stated Sista, 100%. By selecting Bigot Biden &amp; Crime Dawg Kamala, the Dems have in effect told us Blacks to sit down &amp; shut the F up. If they respected us at all they wouldn't have put together this foul ticket, so why should we give away our vote for free. Tired of the BS
SHE RAN FOR PRESIDENT and was a US Senator before that.  If she is not eligible, many people dropped the ball before Biden nominated her.  In other words, she is eligible.
And for those outside the US, that difference is a big deal. As voters I get biting the bullet and recognizing that the GOP an incredibly dangerous, near fascist party and voting Biden. But there's a lot of work to be done for dems to be good on BOTH domestic and foreign policy
Some people on the US left really need to get real about how both parties handle foreign policy. No shit Trump is worse than Biden, and it's fine to recognize that and vote for him. That doesn't change the fact that on foreign policy the difference between dems/GOP isn't that big
Biden his time.
Fvck you. I‚Äôm voting Biden.
Holy shit, bless that reporter for putting this suggestion in his head.   If he wants to show up Obama and Biden, letting Snowden come how is a great way to do it. Just saying.
Nice! This is a good one... hilariously 100% true!  The dynamic duo of Crime Dawg Kamala &amp; Bigot Biden armed with the '94 Crime Bill are tough on crime. These cape crusaders will fill up more empty cells with, and lock-up more, black men than the Kardashians - LOL... sigh, smdh
Regarding you feeling 'insulted' abt Biden choosing a woman; NO ONE CARES ABT YOUR FEELINGS. Only a money grubbin' trumpolite would be offended. Personally, I'm offended every day that 45 is in office, tearing apart the country &amp; letting us die b/c he DOESN'T CARE.
Depends on how "opposite" they are. Somebody who thinks anarcho-primitivism is viable? Maybe. An ardent Biden supporter? OK. Somebody who believes ANTIFA are terrorists funded by Soros? Absolutely not.
FreedomToons animated Joe Biden's most inspiring quote
I wouldn‚Äôt worry about Biden getting elected champ there is nearly a 0 percent chance that‚Äôll happen
Thx Sista, hilariously 100% on point. I think what Bernie meant to say was: it would be irresponsible of him to oppose Joe Bigot Biden, since Bernie is also a cog in the Dem's political machine &amp; takes his marching orders from his puppet master... there, fixed it for ya - LOL.
President Joe Biden. Inmate Donald Trump. Pass it on.

Texting for the DNC this afternoon was a wild; I messaged 300 Texans, and conversed with about 20. I got two Biden volunteer signups, one lawn sign order, and one Trump supporting housewife who met her first trans person (me!) She was very nice, but very ignorant.
Do I think there'll be a Biden-Harris landslide in 2020? I don't know. I hope so. After 2016, however, I'm wary. I really feel like Biden-Harris should keep fighting no matter what the polls say or how rosy things seem. The loss in 2016 hurt and our country is paying to this day.
Putting the orange turds face on a new stamp for envelopes.  Funds the USPS.  Knowing the envelope contains my vote for Biden/Kamala.  Priceless.  #USPSsabotage
I'm certain Joe Biden and Kamala Harris know better, but I hope they take nothing for granted. I hope they fight all the way like they were underdogs. Let's not have a repeat of 2016. I don't think our democracy can stand 4 more years of Donald J Trump. #BidenHarrisLandslide2020
When Biden wins, I hope he considers a pardon!
Yes, because Biden wouldn't even notice it had happened.

What do you know about VP?  Obama said ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt trust Biden to not screw (f word supplanted) everything up‚Äù
The press respects Biden because he's honest? That's an amazing statement. People are out of their minds.
The GOP wants to make it so that people cannot send ballots by mail in any way. They are desperate because Biden is widely leading in the polls and Trumps desperately avoid jail.

canvassing for joe biden at the nude beach
Trump lost the state of New York by 22.5% in 2016. Current polling has him down over 25% to Biden in New York. In NYC, it is even worse. The people that know him best hate him the most.
Not me! I‚Äôm voting Biden/Harris because I am inspired.
The only good thing if Biden wins is he most likely would draft our Governor Inslee opening the door for a possible Republican Governor for the first time in years. Better yet don‚Äôt fill the position since the protesters are running things anyway!
Tbh I hate them both. But Im still voting Biden because he is nowhere NEAR as bas as trump. Im picking the lesser of two evils. Wish I could pick NO evil, but realistically thats not the case. Also at least Biden doesn't want to be a dictator so we can vote for someone else later
If Biden is more powerful than God, shouldn't we vote for Biden?
Nearly every Warren suporter, and a majority of Bernie supporters are planning to cast their votes for Biden. But we're being honest.
How many questions did biden take??
listen i was only 15? at the time but i distinctly remember people being concerned about joe biden. in fact there was a whole coalition of white women who were upset it wasn‚Äôt hillary so...
Agreed.  Once in office, I will support all the pushback against Biden for better policies.  My comment was specific to the election.
Why is Biden allowed to lie about the election process?
There's a version of this that's wearable!
The number of active voters who will sit this one out bc they reject the ticket is FAR less than the number of people who have never voted.   They don't care about politics because politics doesn't care about them.  Instead of shaming anti-Biden/Harris people -- sign up to GOTV.
So when Biden is elected, finally the USPS will have new mail trucks with heat and ac. They deserve that. #SupportUSPS
I think the internet‚Äôs category for this  is ‚ÄúGillmor Gang Reacts... ‚Äú ...to the announcement of Kamala Harris as VP on the Biden ticket
Biden has repackaged the green new deal, and in doing so, has made it palletable for middle ballot voters. I don't care what you call it, this is that plan.
Sady can't be bothered to learn what Biden/Harris support, or what's likely to pass if Democrats take the senate. We're an empty symbol to be exploited for social capital.  These are the people who truly don't care about us.
No it supposed to highlight that, while not nearly as progressive as we would like, Biden represents a much better set of policies than Trump.
I am -so- happy that you were chosen as Biden‚Äôs VP pick. Looking forward to the debates. Please get as much visibility as you safely can. Love you. We can fix this mess. #VoteBidenHarris2020

If I were Biden, my first day, I‚Äôd declare that no imagine of trump would ever be placed on any federal property. No presidential library, no postage stamp, no lying in state, no federal burial and no Secret Service. We need to recoup the billions he has stolen.
Mainly because Dems need to reinforce the narrative that this is all about the importance of the presidency. Biden/Harris is a garbage ticket and if it looks like anything could be done w/o them in office the game is up.
I'm not sure "I am so tired of this partisan BS. I'm voting Joe Biden" isn't an oxymoron. You might instead want to consider a candidate who is also tired of this partisan BS and isn't one of the partisans. Perhaps one with a stunning and only slightly-unsettling beard.

Only if you live in a world with two choices. Then sure, give your vote to Biden and you'll see defunding everywhere. But if you elect someone who will establish a meritocracy, with an honest AG that will prosecute murderers, all this goes away. Elect me and I will give you that.
How could you have been so stupid then as to throw your support to Joe Biden? A man who is the opposite of every moral principle you've spent your life advocating. Joe is every bit as horrific as Trump, no way is he getting my vote, period.
did not expect him to endorse biden like that
Yeah but he still won that primary so the majority of the electorate on that day voted overwhelmingly for him. And that's what elections measure, how many people you can get out to vote. Biden was not a top pick of mine, but the factions of people coalescing around him
What you call ideological purity is what others see as morality. She is a pathological liar, just like Joe Biden and Donald Trump, she put innocent people in prison and kept them there on technicalities, refused to prosecute criminal bankers, and you call that helpful?
Not every independent candidate strips votes from Biden. If you want a better system, you need better inputs.  I can give you a meritocracy where the best people I can find give us the best world we could possibly ask for.
In all fairness, I'm having trouble not seeing Biden as one of the diseased "corporatists". If you are truly interested in a White House that isn't bought and paid for by special interests, you should seriously consider helping me get elected.

Because Steve Mnuchin literally contributed to Kamala's AG campaign, along with Donald and either Ivanka or Melania, can't remember which one. Plus, she's a whore to Wall Street, just like Joe Biden, Obama, and the rest of the centrist corrupted Democrats.

How, by electing the fascist regime of Biden/Harris? How do you think we got Trump? Biden's Senate career was spent pushing the crime bill, multiple versions of the PATRIOT Act, and a long line of enablements that Trump has used. #GreenParty2020

I‚Äôm not rooting for anyone. I‚Äôm not going to reward Joe Biden for a life of service dedicated to the oppression of my people. Trump is an idiot. Biden and his new whore are focused and determined to keep me at the bottom of society. I‚Äôll take my chances with Trump.
Why would anyone consider voting for Biden when his party is so afraid to have him speak in public? Doesn‚Äôt seem very transparent.

If Biden doesn't get elected the SCOTUS will be incredibly skewed toward the right for the next 20 years. He can't do 2 terms, he's too old.
More like Harris will have Biden killed so she can be the top of the ticket
Oh hey, I almost died from H1N1, but it only killed my financial future. Somewhere out there is a bill I'll never be able to touch while keeping a roof over my head, and that was all under Obama; Biden was there the whole time too, so nothing is gonna change anytime soon
Now that Biden has his VP pick it is 100% clear that whoever wins this election, we are all losing. Big time.

‚ÄúAs a presidential candidate, [Kamala Harris] put forth a very knowledgeable, thorough platform as well that speaks to her breadth of knowledge of Indian Country &amp; tribal issues. I think that‚Äôs why together w/ [Joe] Biden ... they make a great team‚Äù - Pechanga Chair Mark Macarro
They both agree Biden sexually assaulted women
That‚Äôs kinda how Biden got the job from  Obama. He had some good points on  Obama during the debates. And Biden turned into Obama‚Äôs cheerleader when he was picked. Your fiercest opposition in the debat is usually someone who cares as much as you do. Those who care are good allies
I mean I'm gonna not vote for Biden, but it's not like I have to do that to own the Neolibs. They're getting constantly owned every single day. They think Pete Buttigieg is cool. That's so fucking sad I almost want to vote for Biden out of pity.

Honest question, what if you voted for Obama, and Hilary, and still plan on voting for Biden/Harris, but don‚Äôt like Harris due to her time as DA? Does that makes you a racist?
I love watching you talk about how great Biden is and how much of a lunatic Trump is...  You do realize backing a president who has had 160,000 American souls die on his watch... is probably political suicide.  #EndTheNightmare

BIDEN AND HARRIS are the traitors they serve corporate interests and never minorities or the working class. What they should be doing is muzzling the corporations and and empowering the working class. #Hawkins2020
Kamala Harris is a former police officer, and a member of the Establishment undemocratic party. She has never passed or supported the working class in anyway. IMPEACH BIDEN!
No. He literally said he wanted to prosecute people with my political beliefs like two weeks ago. Fuck Joe Biden. If the Dems think they don't need to reach out to the Left, that's their fucking problem. I'm not letting them threaten me with the GOP as an excuse to be lazy.
So during a time when everyone is screaming for criminal justice reform and police reform, Biden decides to choose Kamala Harris as his VP? This election really is going to hell in a hand basket.

Honestly I will laugh my ass off if Biden chooses Buttigieg as his VP after all of this speculation. It would be the funniest, most plausible pick he could make that would piss of literally everybody and have exactly zero political ramifications for him.
Biden also has a back story that appeals. Following a fatal accident involving a wife and child he made a point of commuting each evening  to surviving sons from Washington and knew many passengers &amp; staff on Amtrak by name. I don‚Äôt know why but I feel it shows a decent man.

Disagree. Biden made Obama palatable to white voters.  He got Obama to the WH.   Hillary should have chosen Bob Casey of PA.  Conservative D.  He would have gotten those extra votes in PA or MI.
Biden only needs to get 2% of the white vote (&gt; age 45) in six states (MI, PA, OH,FL, WI &amp; AZ. The only woman to poll positively in those states was Harris.
Biden should pick 3 Vice Presidents to appeal to the polyamorous voter.
Biden needs to be more Obama like, and inspire people to vote for him

Ben Shapiro says Trump should be 'overjoyed': He's now running against Kamala Harris, not Biden. BEN IS SPOT ON. JOE YOUR WORK IS FINISHED. YOU WILL BE GETTING CREMED CORN WITH DINNER TONIGHT AFTER ALL. AND YES YOU CAN STAY UP TILL8.
Only the jaded, Uber-rich and elitist ‚Äúhousewife‚Äù will consider voting for you. Reasonable, rational women with self respect will run to the polls to vote for Biden and Harris.   Thankfully there are many, many more of those.
BBC News - Biden's VP pick: Why Kamala Harris embraces her biracial roots
Democrats running Biden platform KNOW his mental capacity is diminishing. I agree the new evidence is staggering; however, Biden's dimentia will not allow him to be a sound witness. Dems know this &amp; will use to their advantage. Evil people! Target now Obama.
Is there a betting pool on when Biden steps down and Harris takes over!
Piece of advice for Trump: if you want Biden/Harris to lose, the first thing you should do is stand down yourself.
Sleepy Joe Biden and his VP Chamomile tea.
Mike Bloomberg promised to support Biden..and he is walking the talk
Except it will be Harris who might be Potus when Biden steps down due to his 'senior moments' become more and more frequent!
Surprise surprise! Biden picks Harris as his VP. üôÑ At this point all we need is for this ticket to get their shit together. Learn from their past mistakes and do better!
This new ad only points out the truth and puts a bow on top. It‚Äôs hard to see how anyone could think Biden is anything but a snake oil salesman. I am a bit surprised that he chose Harris with her new ‚ÄòJoker‚Äô face- as in the character from Batman.
That‚Äôs kinda how Biden got the job from  Obama. He had some good points on  Obama during the debates. And Biden turned into Obama‚Äôs cheerleader when he was picked. Your fiercest opposition in the debat is usually someone who cares as much as you do. Those who care are good allies
Even of Biden did, he'd be lying.
Wow, you're not very informed, are you?  "I don't want my kids growing up in a racial jungle" Joe Biden, author of the Crime Bill, the Bankruptcy Bill, the Patriot Act. And the same man who was anti-choice and pro DOMA.  Get your head out of your ass and you'll see the light.
My choice is easy. If I want four more years of Trump, vote for anyone but biden.  If i want to give him a retirement party (which may involve an Order 66), vote Biden.
#KamalaHarris ‚Äúwas habitually #abusing and #expanding her #power. #Harris opposed #California #laws requiring her office #investigate #shootings involving officers ‚Äî which sounds pretty topical to me. Harris also has a long history of #unlawful #convictions.‚Äù #Constitution #Biden

"Nothing will fundamentally change." Joe Biden  Don't dwell on your hope.
Jill Biden's going to make a great First Lady.
You are mistaken. Harris did not call Biden a racist; she criticized his support for busing.
Lets get to it!! Biden and Harris 2020
You know this shit is all orchestrated in the Smoke Filled Room. Biden is a puppet.
Absolutely do not vote green. A vote for green is one less for Biden, and that only helps trump. trump is the *only* person who benefits from a Green Party vote.
Biden is a practicing Catholic.
Remember when Biden was anti-choice?
So  you stated you believed Biden‚Äôs accusers, and also called him a racist at one point. How do you justify accepting this nomination? You‚Äôre a con artist at best who doesn‚Äôt believe their own narrative!

A historic day to the American people more important to the people of color especially a woman who is a South Asian and African American. Vice President Biden you have done a work that needs to be done and Sen Harris was the right running mate. We need the ticket, she was needed!
Democrats: Biden/Harris, because we never learn.
I‚Äôm going to go out on a limb(or am I) to say that #Biden DID NOT choose #KamalaHarrisForVP. The Democrats chose her for him. #BidenHarris2020
ü§£ü§£ü§£ Who wrote this? Kamala openly states Biden is a racist &amp; supports those who accuse him of fondling/harassment. But I guess that's ok if he picks you as VP.
Our reality: 1. The Democratic ticket is Biden/Harris 2. Republicans are actively destroying us 3. These are the only two currently viable parties for top government 4. Third parties haven't done the work in the last few decades to truly become viable for the Executive Branch
Super excited for you future Ms. VP! Can't wait to vote for Biden/Harris this November.ü§òüòé
That's how you get Trump reelected splitting democratic votes away from Biden.
It‚Äôs our duty to plaster this whole exchange between Harris, Biden, and Gabbard all over the internet.
Cop for VP? Barf.  All politicians are awful. I'm voting for the (much, much) better platform, not because I think Biden and Harris are great people who deserve to be in power.
Nothing positive to say about Biden's policies and history? Nothing?
Why does your dad hate Biden?
Biden picked who we expected him to pick for the reasons we expected him to pick her.  That‚Äôs all the opining I can muster about it presently.
She's for whatever Biden is for. That's her job now: Yes Man.
Never expected Biden to be playing 4D chess. Damn.
I am very disappointed. I thought the day Biden's crew announced their choice of VP candidate would give us a hint of their overall plan. Instead they chose an Jamaican/Indian woman not an African American woman with no plan for the future.
The main problem I have with leftists is their purity tests.  Anything less than Bernie‚Äôs entire platform is a no go.  With Biden, you get like 75-80% of that. It‚Äôs really up to the senate to dictate Biden‚Äôs agenda.
The same compassion Kamala showed when she was Too Cop and Biden showed when he wrote the Crime and Bankruptcy Bills? No, thanks.
I'm voting  Washington will carry for Biden/Harris with or without my vote. At least this will possibly strengthen some kind of opposition to Republicans and Democrats in the future. If this vote results in Trump's election so be it.
Actually, the first is Walker. As in Angela Walker.  Bad ass as in bad choice. Kopmala, Too Coo, and Joe "Crime Bill" Biden is a crap ticket.
Excellent choice! I look forward to a Biden/Harris Whitehouse!
"Nothing will fundamentally change." Joe Biden
Opinion | Kamala Harris was Joe Biden‚Äôs boldest and most qualified pick
DNC: What do we want?  Biden: No fundamental change!  DNC: When do we want it?  Biden: Ice cream!
Is it just me or did  Biden just channel his inner "Ash Ketchum" &amp; summon his most powerful Pokemon?
Friendly reminder that Kamala Harris is a cop and Biden adding her to the ticket among increasing party division over a lack of progressive action is like police responding to police brutality protests with flashbangs and tear gas.
Still trying to use tactics from his 2016 playbook.  First nickname apparently didn't stick to Biden like it did with Hilary.  Now he's throwing out a lame nickname for Kamala.  Man-Baby is going down in November.
You know I won't. But I find this entire situation hilarious. It's a bold move for Biden and one that might actually work.
The Harris pick is strategic. It won't really drive away any of the "center-right" that have switched to Biden after realizing the dumpster fire of Trump. She has a political fanbase that it brings in, and so many progressives know that we have to vote this ticket no matter what.
First Biden, now Harris. The 2020 election is DOA.
Joe Biden picked the VP with the hardest name for Trump to pronounce. #kamala

Really? Because Kamala would be the easiest to control by the lib/left once Biden is medically removed from the Oval.  Know liar Susan Rice is a traitor &amp; wouldn't be controllable at all.

Look kiddo, you know Trump can barely string three words together at this point. Biden can physical and mentally run circles around Trump.  Biden has an election platform. What is Trump running on? "I don't want to go to jail" is not a 4-year plan.
I'm a Christian and I don't support Trump. Heck, I don't even support Biden either.
I agree. Ultimately it will be about building. In the USA there is a golden opportunity in November to make a big difference. It's a real shame Bernie isn't the one up against Trump. But let's hope Biden will shape up.
I voted green in 2016, but I was in a solid blue state. I won't be this time. I'm all for us getting super leftist people elected, but we can't have 4 more years of trump, it's at least one more supreme court choice he gets.  I fucking hate Biden, but a blowout needs to happen.

I'm sure they're not, but I hope "democratic leadership" notices how Republicans are trying to paint Joe freaking Biden as the next Che Guevara.    You could run Mitt Romney against Trump and they'd call him a Marxist. It's no reason to not back actual progressives.
‚ÄúAs I‚Äôve said so many times before, we‚Äôre in the battle for the soul of our nation, and President Trump‚Äôs decision today to profane God and to smear my faith in a political attack is a stark reminder of what the stakes of this fight truly are.‚Äù Joe Biden

I fundamentally disagree. Biden is not a regressive candidate. He is certainly a candidate beyond his time, and his policies are not nearly as progressive as they were seen 30 years ago. But his relative leftism is a fact, if you look back in history.
I think that's a major oversimplification and bad take. Biden has a career of getting legislation passed, and his time in office has shown he can get it done. What was liberal, progressive 30 years ago won't match up with today's standards.
This is a stupid strategy. If he‚Äôs already ahead in the polls; and Trump hangs himself with his own rope, or lights himself on fire with controversy; why should Biden bother?
Here is a more detailed contrast between Biden and Trump if you wanted something with direct quotes from each candidate.
Well Obama has his girl in position now, watch the decline of support, news of declining mental status as we move to November.  Still convinced that Biden will not be the candidate!

No, that's not what's being said at all. Example: medically vulnerable people I know will suffer greatly under trump, but their funds and access will expand greatly under biden (via ACA, which worked better for them) - it's not a catch-all but you can't say that's not better
No, I'm not. I'm saying Trump is very very bad, may even ruin democracy permanently, but Biden, while having similar policies in some areas (not many) will give us time to fight for the agenda we all really want, without risking lives under trump

Incorrect. Right now, the only thing a third party vote will do is elect Trump. So, why not create more flexibility with Biden?
No, I'm not. I'm saying there's value to leftists, progressives in getting Biden over trump, and there are reasons being presented. I'm not watering anything down.
Yes, this is known.   My argument is not for the ideology of Biden. It's for the functionality of a president that won't be breaking norms every day. I'm sure people can appreciate why this is important
I disagree.
Will admit tho that some of the Never Biden folks are pretty embarrassing even as somebody that generally agrees with the sentiment, some of them *kinda* seem to downplay the badness of Trump and suggest some uh... sus things for a progressive to say imo
I think the general idea is that whatever would come from a Biden Administration isn't significant enough to warrant particularly supporting him
There's lots of reasons to not like Biden. There's some good policies in there too, and with the added bonus that he isn't Trump, who defeated both the content and character of our country.   I agree with what was said about the Obama admin. Et al

But that's my point. We know it won't happen with Trump but we don't know what happens with Biden
No one is saying our problems started with Trump. But the situation is definitely worse under him. Why not try something else? We can keep fighting with Biden the same way we fought with Trump
Joe Biden said yesterday: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about your rights, but your responsibility as an American.‚Äù Just remember that line when freedoms are gutted starting in January. Speech, assembly, religion, guns will all be taken from you because of ‚Äúresponsibility‚Äù.

You claim a lot of so-called ‚Äòcredibility‚Äô for yourself BUT you attempt to prove it by voting for Biden!!!?? You‚Äôve only proven you are mentally scrambled! You  vote for Biden and you will be a total loser!
Not all of it. There are important and immediate difference between Biden, Trump. For instance ACA, SC nominations, HHS funding, Pardons, Cabinet operations, Diplomacy, medicaid protections  Lots of these will have immediate effect for POC, Immigrants, Health Vulnerable people
When I said Biden is more electable, I meant to the broad swath of voters who turn out to elections, not just the people reading this thread.
Hey, I appreciate your passion but I'm talking about things in a different way.   My argument for Biden is that he's employing progressive people, and isn't trump. Additionally, I cannot see the damage in replacing Biden with Trump but I can see the damage of keeping Trump
However, Biden has a chance of winning and Hawkins has no chance at all. I'm not saying he doesn't have the better stance but it doesn't matter, electability is what matters
So the deal is to have employers ‚Äúdefer‚Äù payment of payroll taxes.  I hate to say it but it‚Äôs a politically genius move. The payments are delayed, and if Trump loses they return after the election and can be blamed on Biden/Harris. If Trump wins, he‚Äôll just lie it away.
If anyone is curious, there's actually some surprisingly good stuff in there

Harris is a bigger train wreck then Biden
trump could win despite losing the popular vote by ~3%. Polls could be off by another ~3% in his favor. And it's easy to imagine legit votes that don't officially get postmarked in time strip another ~3% from Biden.  Biden at 9% over trump is ostensibly a tie.

It's not even close to the same, for a number of reasons. Biden is a warhawk, and he might be (yet unproven) an assaulter, but he didn't break the law in office - Trump literally has, and was impeached for it. He has done more too. It's hard to keep track of how bad it is now
No dude youre misunderstanding me. I'm saying: Trump and Biden are both bad on every policy dimension we can think of but trump is especially bad not because of policy, but bc of process. He isnt afraid to break the law and will keep doing so, in ways that can't be fixed.

Biden and Kamala are giving a press conference... the last 9 minutes Biden have been talking about Kamala and Trump ... Nothing about himself or his plans ...Kasich wasn't too bad.  He said he is going to vote for Biden,,,we shall see.
Even funnier, the idea that Biden's election is what this is about.   Fuck I'll bite for either parties. The prosecution moves on, and this is just a well timed trendy diversion of ill intentioned government leaders pissed at themselves, for backing up into a corner.
#LastWord I  would love to wake up the morning of November 4, 2020 and find out Biden/Harris won by the biggest landslide in history. The last landslides went to a crook and a pirate it‚Äôs our turn!
Nope. You're the victim of political narrative. Biden isn't creepy at all &amp; he's not "taking advantage" of anyone. It's as innocuous as a grandparent giving a simple hug. If there were any "creepy" intents there, there'd been at least a little effort to hide it from casual view.
Ironic how Trump et al attack his foes with ad hominems that more easily fit Trump himself. "Crooked" Trump paying hush money to porn stars with election funds so they don't talk about where he "grabs them by". Biden may kiss babies,  but at least doesn't French them like Trump.
Unfortunate that he reserves those for only self-aggrandizement. What about the key traits of governing such as ethics, compassion, respect, service, et al? You know, those things that Biden has that Donald "Just about me" Trump only sees as obstacles to "winning"?
We have never had such a corrupt President that is backed by a corrupt Senate and Attny General and friends.Biden needs to put many laws in for protection against this ever happening again.

We can safely assume this guilty FBI lawyer has been cooperating with prosecutor Durham to nail senior officials in the Obama-era CIA, FBI, DNI and main Justice.  If Biden is elected, though, all this will be in vain.

BS, Joe Biden has done criminal stuff to cover up what He and Obama did to President Trump before Trump got into office.  Let's see Russian Collusion was a hoax Them the fake impeachment hearing Oh yea then there is COVID 19 and them blaming President Trump. Wake up  #Trump2020
To her credit, Tulsi supports Biden. Why shut her out if she got delegates?  And you asking who‚Äôs going to listen to AOC speak at the convention? A lot of people would, I‚Äôm very sure.
Are moderates not already motivated by their preferred candidate Biden and their preferred VP Kamala being on top of the ticket?
Regardless of who Biden chose for his VP if we want our country back we have to vote blue 2020 Trump is stealing our democracy he is attacking our institutions. He is sabotaging the post office &amp;  we cannot stand for this. We must take back our country!
Also why don‚Äôt we let black people speak for themselves on this.  Looks like most black voters disagree with your view if rasicm and who is rasict
And you think progressive policy would be a deal breaker for them and that they wouldn‚Äôt vote for Biden because of it?
No doubt rascists come on all shapes and sizes.  I doubt your rasict family voted for a black president or that they would vote for Biden and Kamalla.   I guess their hero‚Äôs have turned on them.
This is what happens when you Defund police departments in America.  Not a good way to stay United. Biden/Harris want to take away your guns too.   We Americans are not gonna stand for this......
Would you use Hannity praising the president using Biden clips?
Do you have the data that says moderate Republicans who don‚Äôt want to vote for Trump and for whom progressive policy would be the decision-making dealbreaker are more plentiful than progressives? If they‚Äôre already against Trump they should be committed to Biden at this point.
I understand you don‚Äôt support trump as well. But how has Biden spent the rest of his entire career advancing             ‚ÄúThe New Jim Crow‚Äù? and what even is the The New Jim Crow?
Typical. Anyone agnst Biden is a Trumper in your tunnel-vision view. Dsnt matter they won‚Äôt vote for Trump, either. If they don‚Äôt praise Biden as the savior from Trump, they‚Äôre Trumpers. That‚Äôs a #BlueMagat for ya. Take a look at the profile before ASSuming. #NeverBidenNeverTrump
Point Taken  yet, at this point, I'm seriously considering not voting for Bernie again &amp; voting for (barf!) Biden, while hoping  your "Copmala" is SOON forced to step up, take the reins, &amp; she primarily governs  for The People.
I‚Äôm pleading with Biden and the DNC to give us some representation, give us policy, give us something. We‚Äôre part of the party too. Don‚Äôt ignore us.  We need everyone to be excited to vote.
Convincing people to ‚Äúsettle for Biden‚Äù isn‚Äôt the way to get record turnout! You need to give them something to vote FOR.
Hmm.  So.  Dems will be crushed with doubt from your fantasizing about Kamala's lack of "blackness" ... and refuse to vote? Or refuse to vote for Biden? Rush into Donnie's arms? Buy your next cheesy "movie?" (Since we're using loose logic today)  What a twizzle.
That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt think he should be speaking at our convention... we can have him support Biden at some other event or something. We don‚Äôt need him being celebrated as an honorary democrat because he‚Äôs not.
UNBIASED TRUTH:  Joe Biden, you should make a Pre-Election announcement, select Elizabeth Warren as you‚Äôre Attorney General, make this announcement prior to the November election...
I'm not exactly hoping Biden will die, but I strongly suspect Kamala Harris will become as pure as driven snow &amp; be one of the best Presidents the USA has EVER had! Ergo, I just might reluctantly not #WriteBernieIn &amp; instead vote for (BARF!) efen senile old child fondling biden~~
I hope Biden is smart enough to make Beto VA Secretary, but even if he‚Äôs not Yang Gang isn‚Äôt done with Beto, we‚Äôll try to make Beto and his supporters part of our coalition going forward, hopefully  makes an appearance on  podcast soon.
Bull hockey....trump is tearing into the fiber of this country. Biden knows government enough to get us out of the trouble trump got us into.
When you realize there'd be less people alive today if Hillary won, realize how incredibly incompetent Trump is, when you realize that Americans are taking the street to reshape our society ourselves, a lame duck playing golf for four years doesn't sound so bad compared to Biden.
She‚Äôs not trashing Biden... in fact she endorsed him. ü§∑
So, we have a Mr. "C'mon man" Biden and Ms. "i think we should we should have tht conversation" Harris running against the most patriotic  in HISTORY!!! So, of course they want mail in voting... Has anyone say the difference in how the USPS union's donate money!!
She endorsed Biden, *is* a Democrat, and got delegates... she deserves to speak. Meanwhile Kasich, who isn‚Äôt a Democrat:
I‚Äôm willing to forgive anyone‚Äôs past political mistakes if they fall behind Biden and Harris now.  If not, my ignore list is very long and getting longer.
i‚Äôm not a liberal either bc fuck this country but i will be voting for biden bc i don‚Äôt know if my friends/family/i can survive another 4 years under tr*mp. idk if we can under biden either but our chances are definitely higher that route.
sounds like y‚Äôall might benefit from another 4 years of tr*mp ü•¥ü•¥ did your dad get that tax break ? stocks go up ?? paid your rent ??? fuck off !! must be easy to not vote for biden when it won‚Äôt affect you negatively. credit:  3arthkid on instagram
Had an interesting chat with  earlier. The bot, I mean VP Biden, knew who  was but not what a #Socialist was, interesting.
Basically, Biden is doing MORE as President BEFORE he is President than Donnie is AS Persident...

Message to Biden caregivers: I suggest that Biden's anger upon questioning maybe controlled by Celexa (citalopram hydrobromide) starting with 10mg daily increasing up to 40mg if needed over a month or so.  Warning: It won't improve his answers.
Biden &amp; Harris aren‚Äôt running the country so they are not in a position to ‚Äúhold China accountable ‚Äú.
Biden/Harris will not win anything. In fact they won't even win the prize that comes out of a cracker jack box.   Kamala Harris everyone thinks you have slept her way to the top. That not a good reputation to have.  America is winning daily with President Trumps Leadership...
M4A, which Biden does not support. If he all of a sudden flipped a script and said he did, I would be unable to trust his honesty because he has already proven and shown that he a dishonest person.
If Sean Hannity is so upset with the #ByeHannity ad, why don't he replace Trump with Biden clips and see what happens?
I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôd piss people off with what I‚Äôm about to say, if I had a Twitter following:  Fuck Donald Trump. Fuck Joe Biden. Fuck Pence and his homophobia. Fuck Kamala Harris. Fuck Sean Hannity. Fuck Rush. Fuck Betsy DeVoss. Most of all, fuck all of us. #fuckpolitics
Goes against some of my Biden preconceptions.
let me just draw a comparison... Biden is a Dumbledore and Trump is a Voldemort. Any questions???? For those that don‚Äôt understand, WATCH THE MOVIES. You obviously have the time. Educate your minds!!!
Me criticizing the KHive while still voting for Biden isn‚Äôt going to swing the election... Chill.
In the final stage of Alzheimer's you can't speak... hope Biden is learning sign language... at least thumb's up &amp; thumb's down... he should be able to master that.
‚ÄúMeatheads founded this nation, and Meatheads have ruled. PLEASE let Biden &amp; Harris cut the Meatheads out!‚Äù ü§®
Have you seen ‚Äúa very heavy agenda‚Äú.   Robbie Martin made a three DVD set which I would like everybody in the country to see.   Biden-Harris will fit in nicely. Not a good thing.
Biden will not pardon him he will proceed with recommendations!
I have decided to stop following the White House and Press Secretary and what ever that thing is  until we get a real President and Vice President in Biden and Harris.  This ass wipe is not going to break the will of the American People!!!
The post office hasn't failed. But if they haven't the money to carry the mail reliably and promptly, then it's Mr. Trump's job to get the money. He is the Executive branch of the government. Making sure USPS works well is his responsibility. Biden can do that job if Trump won't.
‚Äú...millions of votes for Biden &amp; Harris! üòÄ üò∑
Biden wants to break The United States ...Wait he can't remember oh thats right he is a puppet for the left yes The Obama/Biden policy's helped ruin this country more. Its taken President Trump almost 4 years to fix it among all garbage push back our President is dealing with.
While I don't want to see Biden in the white house "these people" are doing anything but providing Trump with votes. All of this is happening under Trumps watch. The country is in a free fall and we have captain dipshit behind the wheel. he's going to lose
I want to be hopeful about it but am sadly not sure if she‚Äôd want to run against Kamala. There‚Äôs no doubt the media will be popping Kamala up as the frontrunner the same way they did with Biden.
I thought it was Ridin with Biden üòÇ
I was never on the fence about who to vote for in November. I‚Äôve been committed to voting Biden for months... I‚Äôm allowed to have some critique about him.
Vote for Biden. Duh!
A vote for Biden/Harris is a vote for Nanchy (full of hate) Pelosi, schiffty schiff,and crying Schumer!  Remember that and vote #TrumpPence2020
This was a great ad. Biden is OUR next POTUS.  Thank you VP. Biden
It's been stupid and insane. Just focus on your health and your recovery! The only great news is that Biden picked Harris as his running mate!! #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020
Me on my way to the jr partners coalition to push the Biden administration to the left the day after the election
So the right wing's strategic attack on a Biden/Harris ticket is that America will become a socialist country....  Neither are for Medicare For All.  They're centrists. If Republicans didn't keep moving the goal post to the right, they'd be Republicans.
You don't have to be crazy about a candidate. You don't have to agree with all of their policies and record. You just have to believe that the country would be better off with Biden than with Trump. Biden may not get us all the way there, but he's a step in the right direction.
While I am no longer a supporter of Trump(or Clinton,Biden, any Dem or Rep) this is a true statement about the last 4 years. So rudely cut off by a virus that media won‚Äôt stop scaring us with.
I can hear Biden now. "I've decided, in order to keep harmony in America, that I will not be pursuing the conviction of ex President Trump."
One just like you would be.
I bet Biden knows how to pronounce our national parks.
Will someone in the media grow a pair and demand we get some answers out of Biden?
Biden F. Trump F-. Neither one is passing the class.
Your defense of a lying sexual predator is tiring. Along with your pathetic vote shaming.
And Biden has been trying to gut it for 40 years. Not mentioning that I see.
You said Trump doesn't want us to have healthcare and I pointed out that neither does Biden so what's your point?
You want to investigate Biden fine let‚Äôs investigate Ivanka &amp; Jared they make millions from several countries. So what Biden made $50,000 a mo. from Ukraine he did nothing wrong what are the Trump children doing. Check one check all.  They are just as wrong
You mean Biden right?
You're putting a lot of words in my mouth. I despise Trump and want him gone for all the same reasons as you. If the left wants to use their power they should fracture the party right now and replace Biden. Vote blue no matter who will back anyone right?
Biden is likely the 1st. candidate for POTUS that can't count backwards from 20 by 3... a test for stage 4 Alzheimer's.
Not just the repubs. Biden has been trying for 40 years to gut both programs.
A third candidate only helps Trump if you assume my vote belongs to Biden. If everyone who is swallowing the bitter Biden pill refused to do so, they would replace him because they wouldn't have the numbers. Towing party line is throwing your vote away.
The first time a President Biden kills people in the Middle East is the first time national news outlets will publish "Trump Would Have Handled This Situation Like A Don" articles.
Wondering the same.... unless there more to the clip that says he will do everything he can to stop it? He just seems to be saying what the post office/Biden is asking for/proposing. Nothing about admiring he is opposed??
Bush created the DHS and ICE and illegally invaded a country and killed a million people. Biden brags about writing the Patriot Act. Trump is a fascist but he's using the tools they created.
Not your point. The comment you replied to. Trump is heinous. So is Biden and so was Bush. Acting like Trump is the only reason things are bad is disingenuous.
It's going to be Biden or Trump. I'm not crazy about it either, but that's reality. You want Howie Hawkins or somebody? Put him in a state office, let him build a voting record &amp; name rec, &amp; get back to me then.
Car is no good W/O gas,put em together..they go a long way,there's a thousand analogies that fit the Biden/Harris ticket!But successful is the easiest way to put it! Trumps mouth will doom him!Biden is 13 pts.ahead of Trump already,! Many independent experts predict landslide!B/H
False. Biden already told Wall Street nothing will fundamentally change.
No thanks. I need my SS to live.
I think if Biden/Harris were in charge there would be
Vote Biden anyway
Biden is calling for a Nationwide Mandatory Mask wearing, who's in for a Nationwide Mask Burning, someone set a day and everyone make sure you record it and tweet, send it to Joe Biden to make sure he see's it.
That's just not the way of a Harris/Biden totalitarian socialist state.
Biden and Kamala are trying to save us? bwahahahahaha, they're trying to kill us, a lady was told she had covid and didn't have long to live, another doctor re-examined her and found it was from her wearing her mask, she had Legionnaire disease, got her the proper meds for it.
At least he wasn't in Wisconsin.  That line would have been bonkers if it were, ‚ÄúWe are not going to let Joe Biden and Kamala Harris cut America‚Äôs cheese‚Äù

If they look real to you, then I implore you to look for yourself and see how hypocritically it is for an Indian Jamaican woman who's ancestors were slave owner's, who called Biden a racist and rapist just months ago, accept being a running mate as the 1st African American woman
Endorse Biden is a good call to action.
I not only strongly suspect Biden &amp; Kamala are not only willing to sell their very own arses to corp USA, for a few $'s more, they'll even toss in their Grandma's, then I fully agree! Other than that one little flaw, I suspect, given the chance, Kamala will  be a great President.
The Politico profile on Biden and his relationship with Obama has a lot that‚Äôs interesting, but was struck by the line by a Republican that Obama is a mansplainer while Biden isn‚Äôt.
I have a feeling that this comic shows more about how the artist feels about Kamala Harris than how Joe Biden does.
But covering it fairly or misrepresenting facts and twisting it to look as though trump is bad and it was all Biden's doing, I'll never trust the msm ever again
Yes absolutely!!  We need to start taking steps to control this disease!  Hopefully Biden/Harris have already started on a plan to attack this thing! (Given Trump doesn't cheat his way back)
Such lies and deceit. You'd rather go backwards with fake Biden and even more fake Harris
Biden and Harris are gonna scare many people into changing there votes. Thats fine with me President Trump is going to win in November!!! #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver
That‚Äôs a contortion, yes. But the presidential election is binary at this point, and given my options, I‚Äôm thrilled to vote the much lesser of two evils. Trump aspires to dictatorship. He must be voted out of office. Biden describes it as an ‚Äúinflection point;‚Äù it is.
Idk, i had no idea Biden has an unscalable wall on his property. Oh, it‚Äôs scalable? Ok, so he‚Äôs doing it more for personal use on his own property, and not as a deterrent against immigration to protect an entire fucking country. Maybe trump should invest in a moat as well, lol
Personally I think we‚Äôre looking at just that. There are no good candidates. What Trump has going for him is that he‚Äôs the evil we know.  Biden is a moron and Harris had already shown Shek Day or do anything to further her political aspirations. Everything is scary.
You're delusional if you honestly believe Biden will be worse than Trump on race issues.
If you really want to get down to the brass tacks as to why Trump is president it's because of the candidate they put up again. Had it been anybody but Hillary Trump would not have won. Blame the DNC for why Trump is in office. And they very likely did it again with Biden.
Once Biden is elected sure!
You‚Äôd think Biden would‚Äôve checked that before he asked her to join the ticket.
Ummm socialism and government regulations are left, capitalism and not interfering is right. So Medicare for all is left, Biden said that's much government involvement, where does that put Biden? ü§∑
Mitt Romney is part of the Lincoln Project which is a group of Republicans who want Trump defeated. They would rather have Biden elected than let Trump kill the Goose that lays their Golden Eggs.  The Lincoln Project does not want the swamp drained
You can thank the Democrat party for that.  Make sure you run out and vote for Biden in Nov if you like this.
Then you're voting for a fraud, who is Indian and Jamaican, not African American, called Biden out for his racism not long ago, and literally had ancestors who owned slaves to which there are records proving it. Way to set us all back.
Remember that Biden was VP before he won the presidential nomination.
I will still pay attention but if Biden is president I won't open Twitter every morning scared of what I'm about to read. And that I'm very much looking forward to.
That would be Trump. Senator Byrd was involved in the KKK throughout much of the 1940‚Äôs. He was a Senator who‚Äôs length of service in the US Congress is 2nd only to the late Rep John Dingell. He later denounced his time with the KKK. People grow and learn.
That‚Äôs a really big if. Biden doesn‚Äôt even support nuking the filibuster as of yet.
How do you think they get the money? They‚Äôre expected to keep their promises to their donors. If Biden‚Äôs promise was ‚Äúnothing will fundamentally change,‚Äù or something like that, he‚Äôs expected to keep it.
When did I say I wasn‚Äôt voting Biden? Or are you assuming something?  I‚Äôm allowed to have my criticisms. Now shush.
Hoping  has a place for him in the Biden/Harris Administration!
This article from 2019 indicates Joe Biden ‚Äúhad quietly indicated that he would almost certainly not run for a second term while declining to make a promise.‚Äù Is that still the case?
Fox News' Jeanine Pirro Tries To Walk Back Ominous Prediction About Joe Biden #SmartNews
I don‚Äôt see her running for that immediately. It would be bad optics and would look like she‚Äôs running against Biden.
You do realize trump is running against Biden not Harris right?
Also we can have our differences of opinion on where she would be best at.   I‚Äôm sure wherever she goes (or stays), she‚Äôll make the most of it.  Just expressing my disappointment that Biden probably won‚Äôt want a fierce advocate for everyday people to be a part of his admin.
Not me, thankfully.  I do have a couple of kids who've bought into the "Trump and Biden are the same!" line.
She could say she helped Biden directly to fix everything.
High key I don‚Äôt think Biden is even going to nominate Warren for Treasury Secretary.  I‚Äôm becoming more convinced she‚Äôs going to be completely shut out of his administration because it‚Äôs what his corporate donors and the powers that be want.

Electing Joe Biden President of the United States of America... has help for the handicapped gone to far?
Yes we are... and we‚Äôre allowed to be in our feelings. I personally am still committed to voting for Biden, so I don‚Äôt need to be tone policed.
No one said that they didn‚Äôt want Biden to be president.
The world is already laughing. Our country has already collapsed.  Unfortunately, Joe Biden isn't President...
Mr.Biden.Look at Thermo Fisher they are an American company making strides with making tests and leading the way in agribusiness could be an agriculture Secretary in there!! But definitely testing contracts
Guess who showed up to vote in SC, and put Biden on the top of the ticket? Guess who's on TV sharing their opinions freely and succinctly? I can find a lot of material to support my contention.
I wonder if that comment made by  could be construed as a veiled threat towards VP Biden to do him some type of harm? Or to trigger a unstable Trump supporter to follow through? Is the Secret Service going to follow through on this? If not why not? America is asking
Biden is right.  Wearing masks is about our responsibility to use whatever means necessary, however imperfect, to protect each other in times of crisis.  The people shrieking that their freedom is infringed by such a slight inconvenience are just selfish crybabies.
I'm a Biden-Harris supporter tired of the ultra lefty sore loser bullshit trying to split the Dem ticket.   Trump is an existential threat to all POC and women who choose not to be baby factories.   People who don't think that's enough of a reason to vote Biden are human garbage.
We‚Äôll see. Biden might just kowtow to his corporate donors‚Äô wishes and advisors like Larry Summers, just like he did with his VP pick.
I never said he was perfect. You think Trump is pro-environment? Biden may not be the best on that count, but he's a hell of a lot better than Trump.
Just stop. Biden is far from the answer to the problems in the US. FAR from the answer. But we all know fascism is absolutely a non-starter. Overt racism is a non-starter. Trump is a non-starter. We can work with a guy like Biden.
Why does the virus have to be gone by election day in order for Biden to win? I don't follow your logic.
Not a fan of Harris because of her policies in the past, but I gotta say I‚Äôm impressed that Biden chose a woman of color as his running mate. I‚Äôm not going to let my reservations prevent me from voting blue (it never has before, and it especially won‚Äôt now)
I'm fairly left, love a good steak, and I have never been afraid FDA recommendations were going to take that from me. This wacky idea isn't going to convince me not to vote Biden/Harris.

I think we need to employ the same tactics to get a change in ALL the old guard in D.C. On both sides of the aisle, they're all just as corrupt and loonie as Biden.
Had to mention Biden‚Äôs plagerism. Just threw it in there.üôÑ
I didn't give you Biden but I will vote for him. He has a plan to battle coronavirus and will be a leader of the USA, not a dictator-wanna-be. And he won't be for sale to Russia, North Korea, or China.
I was alarmed about the Pelosi potentially becoming President portion mess.  I don‚Äôt support Biden or Harris for political office though &amp; it has nothing at all to do with their race, color of skin, or citizenship, origin of birth...I just don‚Äôt agree w/ their policies
So you're planning to leave the country? Because that's the only way you will not wind up under the leadership of either Biden or Trump.
He may be able to defund it but Biden will bring it back. Lol
Me, too. With the caveat that he‚Äôs the one on the ticket we can most hold accountable. Womxn‚Äôs Marches, anti-kids in cages rallies, &amp; BLM protests MUST continue if Biden wins. Things aren‚Äôt different bc of a Dem President. We can‚Äôt let up until we get what we want: Better lives.

Ah, so Biden is comparable to Dahmer or Manson. Gotcha. But it's going to be him or Trump. If I had to pick Dahmer or Manson to watch my dog, I just wouldn't leave my dog. But the only way you get to not live under the leadership of POTUS is to leave the country.
So what's your suggestion? We get either Biden or Trump come January. If you really don't care which one wins, I don't know what to tell you. Let 40% of the country make your choice, I guess.

Most people only read the headlines. Personally, i get a kick of conservative articles freaking out about things that don't exist, like Biden and Harris being Marxists. Hilarious!
Who would you trust to watch your dog? Trump or Biden? Pence or Harris?
I'm blocking every single person who claims to be a progressive and is criticizing the Biden-Harris ticket. Sorry, there's one shot against #45, there are zero other choices, so fuck right off.
The people rejected Medicare for All at the ONLY place that it mattered: the election, and chose Biden.  The problem with polls, is that they can lead people to make choices they won't support at the polls. QED.
The Russian and Trump BOT army has been set loose with the Biden/Harris news yesterday. It is only going to get worst from here on out. To bad Jack/Twitter won't do anything about it.
If Biden doesn't get elected the SCOTUS will be incredibly skewed toward the right for the next 20 years. He can't do 2 terms, he's too old.
We've been trying to do that for 200 years.   Not gonna happen before November. In 81 days, this country will choose the people who take the oath in January. It will be either Biden or Trump. You can make your voice heard, or let others choose for you.
It's kind of amusingly universal -- they all think they're criticizing Harris and Biden, but every time they just name reasons I'm eager to vote #BidenHarris2020.
so Joe you selected a ex-Senator of state that's losing their taxpayers to the state of Texas. So... a senator that doesn't know how to fix the homeless as vp and a ex-vp, Biden, that did nothing for the economy for 8 years; lovely....
Very good point. It will take decades to get back on track, so we can move forward as a better country. Biden and Harris will not fix all but they are a foundation to prevent future trumps and a foundation to save this world.

Tara Reade: Media Should Challenge Kamala Harris on Biden Accusers  via
I wrote in a candidate in 2016. My state is solidly Dem, so I felt safe doing it as I was "voting my conscious" but as it became clear T was winning election night, I regretted my choice for fear even my state would not go as usual. I will vote Biden/Harris this time.
I feel like the massive shaming of people who have legitimate concerns about Biden-Harris is disproportionate to the number of people who won‚Äôt vote. But I may be wrong.
I have a suspicion that most people on the left criticizing Biden-Harris are probably still going to vote for them. But I‚Äôll take a poll anyway... if you are a leftist who is critical of the Dem ticket, will you still vote for them?
A little advice for you...you should never go on TV and speak immediately after Biden, and especially never after Kamala.  It just magnifies how fucking stupid and low-energy you truly are. You should fire whomever in your campaign set that up. #douchebagnchief

To what extent could a Biden administration retroactively fine/enforce/prosecute these crimes?
Great. But we're still going to wind up with either Biden or Trump at the helm come January.
What did Biden say here that wasn‚Äôt true?  He did say this. The Charlottesville group is at best antisemitic. Trump did call them very fine people. Do you not think Trump is racist with all he‚Äôs said and done in the past?
If Biden/Harris win, I want to see the Womxn‚Äôs Marches continue on Washington, the BLM protests continue, and the rallies to free kids from cages keep going. Our lives still won‚Äôt be better, but they‚Äôll at least have a chance to be.
We are a safe blue state, it‚Äôs true, so we can protest vote. The. The bigger conversation for us in WA is beyond who our presidential vote will be. It‚Äôs ‚ÄúWhat are each of us doing to hold Biden accountable, hold Trump accountable, and how can we keep that going in 2021?‚Äù
I've now heard 3 R's bring up the Harris/Biden debate saying that she was mad bc he supported bussing.  But... she was saying he was against bussing.  They don't even know what the controversy is.  Neither do voters.  This issue is not a big deal.
Never forget Biden said this during a worldwide pandemic.
Well I know FOR SURE Biden won't so what's the difference?
Joe Biden texts me more consistently than any boyfriend I've ever had
But you can't. You will wind up in either of the other two places. We will have either Biden or Trump. Who is even running for Green this year anyway, and what have they done to consolidate political power since 2016?
Edit... *former readers Also, there is no ‚Äúassuming‚Äù the attempt. This pathetic birtherism opinion published THE DAY AFTER Biden names Kamala Harris as his running mate? Your former readers aren‚Äôt that stupid. It is what it is.
You don't get those choices. We will inaugurate either Biden or Trump in January. There is no other possibility.
How credible? As credible as the Biden accusers because I highly doudt that.
Is he working for the Biden campaign?
At least Trump has his ego getting in the way.  Biden will have no idea what's going on also, but his team of lobbyist handlers are supremely adept at evil.
#BernieOrBust wasn't a threat, it was a reality.  Nothing Bernie himself could say, never mind your privileged ass, to make anything about Biden appealing to voters that matter, not you or me, but people who've never voted in their life because they're too busy just surviving.
You just don't get it.  Trump is a symptom of a bigger disease.  Putting up shitlibs like Biden IS WHAT MAKES TRUMP RELEVANT.
‚ÄúWhenever I see a black person I start screaming ‚ÄòJoe Biden is a communist!‚Äô until I feel better.‚Äù ‚Äìcons, probably
I pick Trump then.  I'd prefer to let him golf for another four years while we elect downballot progressives and topple statues, you know... reshape society on our own.  Biden would only codify everything done by Trump so far and wage war after war after war.
I did vote for Clinton in '16 but it took my husband reminding me how guilty I would feel if she somehow lost our typically safe blue state. This year I'm excited to vote against Trump and know how much better Biden/Harris will be
Explain how the real world outcomes of a Biden Admin wouldn't be even worse.  Trump has started zero new wars and only overthrown one democracy.  Biden:
But we can't. That's not an option. Trust me, we'll get either Biden or Trump. So in your eyes, we either go 3 or 20 miles backwards. And people like me will make that choice for you. Running for POTUS isn't building political power.
Healing America from the destruction of the current administration needs to begin with a vote November 3rd for Biden/Harris.
They need to earn your vote as much as they need to work to earn mine.  But don‚Äôt go off about how the system hasn‚Äôt changed and nothing‚Äôs getting any better if you don‚Äôt vote the way that gets us closest to that change.  End of the day, Trump/Pence ain‚Äôt it. Biden/Harris is.
I, too, want to dismantle the system that forces us to make those choices and makes a third party impossible.  But we haven‚Äôt done that yet.  And refusing to vote Biden/Harris in 2020 doesn‚Äôt get us any closer.  So if you refuse to vote Biden/Harris, fine. That‚Äôs your right.
So I‚Äôm voting Biden/Harris because with the wins in the House and potentially the Senate we CAN and WILL hold Biden accountable for every vote, every veto, and every policy.  People forget progressives needed 5 seats to shift the axis of power to the left.
I‚Äôm gonna loss some followers, I‚Äôm sure, but here we go:  After sitting with it for months. After watching secret federal police kidnap protestors in Portland. After watching people I love suffer under #COVID19 layoffs and unemployment.  I‚Äôm voting Biden/Harris. 1/

Okay, then don't vote. But I will, and many people like me also will. And we'll either get 4 more years of Trump, or we'll get Biden. Welcome to reality. There are no other possible outcomes, barring a meteor strike that takes us off the map.
You claim we'll have a "depression" if Biden is President instead of you being president. We're in one now, you idiot. And you are the cause. Your failure, your incompetence, has us in a depression. But you're too stupid to realize that.
I know thats right! Fun him into the ground girl! Dump trump!üíØ biden/harris is the future
It will be either Biden or Trump. There is no other possible outcome. Why didn't your preferred candidate get on the ballot in one of the two major parties? That's how to get the bus you want. Duverger's law.
I'm old enough to remember when we were told the Democrats were justified in nominating centrists like Biden &amp; Harris because the GOP wouldn't be able to smear them as socialists/communists.
So my take on this is that both candidates seek to be President but Trump is relaxing on the train letting others do the work as he coasts along in his comfortable life, while Biden is labouring and doing all the work himself without the glamour and comfort... Trump own goal!

'If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black'  According to Biden it only involves supporting hin.

It's going to be Trump or Biden. Accept that. There will be no other outcome. And it's not because of Any nefarious plot. It's duverger's syndrome. A result of our winner-take-all system. It is inevitable.

hmmm let's see, Kamala got only 8% of support from California, the only way she can become VP with Biden is if they cheat including her giving out free BJ's to every voter. BUT I don't see a chance in Hell that Biden will be President, Kamala will make sure of that.

I don't think so, Trump is a champion of holding fast to a shitty narrative. He's on the racist suburban housewives rant again today with his typical fear mongering. He's scrambling. Biden/Harris are going to take Trump to the mat in a big way. We've got to VOTE!!

There‚Äôs no solid proof that Harris would have been the better VP even electoral wise. Polls showed independents and unenthusiastic democrats clearly preferring Warren. The ones who preferred Harris were already enthusiastic about voting for Biden.

Biden scares the hell out of me
tell me more about this "eliminate your health plan". I note that through revisions of Medicaid and online exchange rules, Mr. Trump has literally eliminated the health plans for tens of millions of Americans, although both Biden &amp; Harris have advocated insuring more people.
He probably doesn't remember, the party will be lucky if Biden remembers that she is his VP pick and running mate.

Equating Trump and Biden is a privileged idea because they‚Äôre saying it would not make any difference to them one way or another.. completely disregarding that Trump is a real danger to many on multiple levels. Preventing progress for the sake of political perfection is dangerous
For real though you have to vote for Biden.
A middle finger to Bernie. A middle finger to Warren (though, i'm sure she'll have a spot). A middle finger to what is really happening in America right now when people are calling to defund the police. Biden wrote the crime bill. Biden and Harris are pro-police.
not only sexist, as with 2016, but you are also a racist.  She's better than Biden. Biden's better than Trump. No one should vote for Trump. If we have to go back to the status quo, we go back to the status quo, but this is a big middle finger to the progressive left.
This is exactly what the democrats want. When Biden said months ago that his VP would be a woman of colour, that's identity politics, and is used as a weapon against the white supremacy/misogyny of Trump.
People are questioning if Harris is "black enough". Imagine if someone stated Biden wasn't white enough. I mean, it is an outrageous statement to question whether someone is truly the colour of their skin....
America is racist... what‚Äôs your point? We all know who we DONT want. I‚Äôd vote for a dog over trump. So, happy to have Biden/Harris 2020 in a two party system.
Google is your friend. Joe is NOT a friend of the Earth.

It's only a reality if you make it one. The DNC has ARMIES of people repeating the lie that there are only 2 people running and we MUST vote for sexual predator Biden and cop Harris. Just say no.
Just stop. A vote for DT is a vote for DT. A vote for Biden is a vote for Biden. Just admit you are fine with being a corporate puppet. Nothing wrong with that . But STOP with the "we only have 2 candidates" BS. It's just not true.
I think an important consideration is if you are in a swing state. I‚Äôm in WA, for example, which‚Äôll go Biden no matter what so I‚Äôm freer to write in/abstain. In a swing state, I would say voting for Biden has more importance/usefulness.
It's not a sane choice when Biden was INSTALLED by rigging the primary. I will NOT vote for cheaters, nor sexual predators and liars.

"Actions speak louder than words."  This axiom is universally understood by all voters.  IMHO, conservatives should be focusing on the "actions" of the candidates, and judging those actions.  Biden's actions are not Catholic, despite his claims otherwise.  Actions, not words.

Trump tweeted this: The ‚Äúsuburban housewife‚Äù will be voting for me. They want safety &amp; are thrilled that I ended the long running program where low income housing would invade their neighborhood. Biden would reinstall it, in a bigger form, with Corey Booker in charge. Disgusting.
Joe Biden is literally Donald Trump just a few stages deeper into dementia and instead of being on the apprentice and owning casinos he just was openly racist and sexist for 40 years.
Harris is not progressive. She's as far right as Biden in policy, and she's a middle finger to the left that are protesting police brutality in the streets right now that she was chosen to be VP. You can't remake Harris as a progressive. She isn't, never has been.

Biden and Harris make debut as running mates, vowing to defeat Trump  They look wonderful together I think compliments the democratic party and they will be invincible cannot wait to see Kamala go after Mikey pinhead pence she will tear him a new ass......
He‚Äôs has been a civil rights attorney and is Jewish.  That is a very righteous combination from the ‚Äò60s.  It makes me even more proud of this ticket.  Joe Biden, Jill Biden, Kamala Harris and Douglas Emhoff will rock this world!
I‚Äôm sorry, what? Joe Biden is a Catholic! Are you serious,or just trying to be relevant? News flash, you are neither! Sit down!
1 Biden is only a puppet in the Radical Democratic agenda. Joe Biden is being elderly abused and being used by the Democratic Party! ‚ÄúIf‚Äù Biden is elected to the highest office in the United States he won‚Äôt make it to Inauguration Day!
Biden...Harris...One thing I can agree with is it‚Äôs better than the alternative, and if I could vote I‚Äôd wake myself up to go to the voting booth, get it over with, use some sanitizer, then wipe the tears from eyes.
But if I don‚Äôt vote Biden I‚Äôm not black üòÇ they both say racist stuff. You should vote for people based off of their ideas for policies, foreign affairs, etc. Not based off who makes you feel good inside.
CANNOT operate a cellular phone so what's that tell you and he definitely IS NOT running his own  account he is just a RUNG IN A LADDER plus I here there is a contract out on BIDEN he's GREEN LIT whatever that means.  Something about past deals that have failed.
PEDOPHILE BILL YOU ONLY ENDORSE BIDEN BECAUSE YOU RAPE CHILDREN TOGETHER #EpsteinIsland    PHOTOS AN GPS PUT YOU AND ALL YOUR "ASSOCIATES" THERE MULTIPLE TIMES #EpsteinFlightLog  DEMOCRATES ARE PEDOPHILES AND RAPEST CREEPY JOE HAS HELD POLITCAL POWER 20+yrs DESTROYING IT.
Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate, adding former rival to ticket  Kamala Harris you should be honored Joey Biden Kamala was not my first pick...BUT HER SPUNKINESS AND ENERGY ARE QUALITIES OF A FINE VICE PRESIDENT AND SHE WILL TEAR PENCE APART......
Not to mention that back in the day Biden fought for segregation.
I echo the sentiments that Biden and Harris aren't my ideal candidates, but I'm still voting for them. We'll at least have a shot at being listened to as we raise our voices. We're not getting that with Trump. We try to raise our voices and he responds like a manipulative spouse.
I would like to thank the DNC for choosing  as Biden‚Äôs VP Nominee. (I wonder if Joe knows yet?) Thank you for doing everything possible to throw the election!
This guy endorses Biden and all y‚Äôall still worship him? If Donald trump is racist wtf is joe Biden lmao. This world is truly in Satans hands

I understand but strongly disagree. I respect him and agree shaming voters is not effective. I‚Äôm strongly encouraging him to reconsider because the fact is it‚Äôs trump or Biden. It will not be Green this cycle.

Donald Trump is So threatened by VP Joe Biden that he's willing to take help from any Country, he's willing to take down the Postal service, he's going to continue to risk American lives to discourage voting, funding Kanye West for Prez to take votes....what am I missing?
I just have to say this, all these idiots tweeting about the a$$ in the WH signing an EO for pre-existing healthcare coverage is about as stupid as it gets! It‚Äôs called the ACA thank you Obama/Biden
That‚Äôs wonderful they agree on Biden, but I‚Äôm sure they don‚Äôt agree on Bama and Auburn.
Joe Biden is 77.  Nancy Pelosi is 80. Are you kidding me?Why should he, Biden doesn't write or decide anything that comes out of his campaign.
There is no difference between trump and Biden. They work for the elites and corporations. Until voters stand up to the dem party then we will not be represented.
Dear Biden and Sanders Delegates: Please boo William Jefferson Clinton off the stage.
From the coming democratic convention? Could be ü§î.. to get our attention from Biden/Kamala?
These Biden people always give themselves away with these analogies where Biden is supposed to be the almost perfect option with some minor blemish. Like, how are we supposed to believe them and see their supposed wisdom when they won't even be honest with themselves?
I‚Äôm going to say what all the cowards aren‚Äôt saying: Joe Biden should nominate Rashida Tlaib for SCOTUS.
I seem to have direct evidence of Biden doing the same thing.   Neither cases are relevant to this where the democrats are trying to scam the voters.
Biden ought to make clear to deJoy that tampering with the USPS is a federal crime and Jan 2021 he will be arrested
Believe me, I'm Meh about the current ticket, and find it hard to sell Biden as a leader in isolation... but I will fight like hell not to have a fascist proto-dictatorship last more than one term
The reason they support Biden, they know he won't cut their budget, Biden is pandering to them. All they want is to keep their government job. Only business that can lose billions $each year &amp; keep in business

I really wouldn't be so confident Malcolm would vote for Joe Biden, or that he would give any credence whatsoever to the broader liberal-versus-conservative framework.
Thread! My view of this is different than other ppl‚Äôs + I totally get not wanting to vote for Biden like,,, fuck him! I think getting trump out is a harm reduction strategy only if we don‚Äôt return to complacency but it‚Äôs not my place to tell marginalized communities how to vote.
This tweet is just enraging me for so many reasons. If they instead endorse Biden, would that be a better thing? And what do you mean by ‚Äúpotential‚Äù problem, as if civil servants should ever be giving political endorsements even through a representative.
This Biden?
Biden will heart just as many of not more people, we can at least use Trump to hurt the right people.  The DNC wants to play dirty politics  I'm game
And you're not very convincing, I've at least cited all my shit, nor am I insulting, insulting people doesn't really make me wanna vote for Biden
Oh this ain't a hate vote, he earned it by being more in favor of Medicare for all than Biden, and by giving me 1200 dollars. He's the most liberal president I've had in my lifetime that's for sure
Biden says that under him nothing will change so not sure how that's an argument against Trump
It's alright I understand, I just think it's best to go on the offensive. Progressives won't win bending the knee to biden
I live in Washington. In the d primaries they voted joe biden. I dont know a single person who voted for him. They all went Bernie. I doubt they'll go trump because of the institutional corruption. We have 3 counties who go blue. If we had real elections. Trump would win easily
If Biden wins, do you think he‚Äôll resign before his term his is up so that Pence will pardon him? Is this a possibility?
Trump's even more supportive of universal healthcare than Biden is  please understand, Trump can be used as a weapon against the establishment.
Trump wants your vote, I am a Bernie supporter who's gone Trump, in my eyes, the best way to get the corperate Dems out is to embarrass them in front of America by losing to Trump. It's worked well so far, it'd work even better if Biden loses.  Join me brother, please. Fuck DNC.
Joe Biden has already forgotten that he's getting the nomination.
All of them need to be arrested for treason, and if Biden doesn‚Äôt do that I will not vote for his 2nd term!
Obama &amp; Biden &amp; many governor's &amp; mayors got on the same page &amp; dismantled the occupy movement.

No it isn't, infact I'd say it's better. Biden in more against Medicare for all than Trump after all.
I am sure biden will slaughter trump on the fake popular vote and trump will win. Just to piss them off as they play both sides.
That's hilarious. You call Kamala, our future Vice President, a nasty woman. You You can't honestly believe you respect any woman in the entire world. You wanna build a statue? Make it of Kamala, because she's going to make history by helping Biden take you down.
I think it comes down to, like in most coups, if the military will back him.  W Biden as the other choice I think theyre not gonna take sides cus its win/win  If anyone willing to cut the millitary budget were the dem pic itd be another story

Neither Biden nor Harris have great criminal justice track records. While I am hopeful that they will take this country to the next level, my fear is that many will see it as the stopping point for the grassroots work.
Seriously I 'd be thrilled if Biden/Kamala delivered one of these. Ecstatic if more than one.
's choice of  gives me hope. Biden has shown that he's not afraid to elevate someone who will make him look bad if it's for the good of our Nation.  I'm 100% behind this ticket. So happy  is on it!

This is why lesser of 2 evils voting g is problematic. Joe Biden is supposed the most left DNC platform ever but somehow it's way less progressive than every Dem platform until 1980? Literally hasn't been an opposition party since Reagan.
It's going to Joe Biden's campaign. There something democrats are great at, exploiting black people.   I seem to recall having a civil war to correct this kind of stuff, but what can you do? Some have a short memory.

If Biden &amp; Harris win it will be without my support or my vote
Thought this said Malarky and envisioned an ad where Biden yells malarky at each and every policy failure. That ad would slap, but Markey‚Äôs slaps harder.
Nothing about Biden. Not a fan of or Harris whatsoever.  "COLLAPSE" look around in your America!!! Get your shit together &amp; force a huge stimulus check for the Rest of the year!!!!
Since one could argue Biden is worse than Trump - he shares many of Trump's flaws, has a longer track record of doing so, and has accomplishments like the Iraq War that Donnie still hasn't achieved - you'll forgive me if I take a pass on your Red Team versus Blue Team bullshit.
‚ÄúWe want to win but we‚Äôre scared some random judge will throw them off the ballot in a swing state.‚Äù

Thank you. Voting Biden/Harris. Also, beware Russian bots and the crap they spew. It‚Äôs amazing how many people lap it up and regurgitate it.
Even if i didnt want a boost   FUCK JOE BIDEN
That's the point.   Biden or Saager????   Actual progressive people that don't have a voice in the Democratic party would vote for Saager. Especially when it comes to a lot of economic issues.  It's not the person.(no duh, I would rather have krystal) it's about any progress
At least you are showing Biden doing something you are incapable of!
This is in fact, really good and worth watching. They shoot straight past the bullshit about Biden/Harris and go right into applying what we know about Movement theory and power relations to our situation now and what to focus on. All of their points are interesting. Good show ü§ò
Yeah. People can vote for Biden if they want. I understand the train of thought. But this "Biden is a good guy / good candidate" thing is an insult to my intelligence AND ignores the important fact that even if he wins you will have to fight against him for every bit of progress.
Joe biden supports antifa because he is a communist just like Trump and the rest. As backed by the communist central bankers who took this country when they killed lincoln. Its called HISTORY.
2.  Legitimacy of the outcome.  His tactic is to overwhelm the system with shit.  So, anything less than a total landslide with all 50 states certifying electors sufficient to give Biden a clear 270 electoral votes, will create the confusion that raises this scenario.

This gets into one of the major problems with American politics, and why Obama/Biden led us directly into Trump (and why Biden/Harris would deliver us into the next Trump). Trump singles out Democrats as lying out-of-touch elitists working against Americans' interests...
I gave you an honest answer. I don't fuckin' waste my time with Joe Biden webcasts or whatever. Better things to do.  Many of his lies are promises (or crafted non-promises) he has no intention of keeping. I can't strictly prove it's a lie, but you're a fool if you believe him.

200% agree.  I rather have  as president. It's about making the country better. Saager _ I could agree on many things.  I don't agree with much at all when it comes to Biden &amp; Harris. If I do they don't go far enough for the betterment of the American people
The PANDEMIC is highlighting all the failures of our duopoly for the last many decades.   They people like US to close our eyes, shut our mouths &amp; turn off independent thinking &amp; vote 4 biden &amp; Harris. That will eventually lead to a smarter, more organized Trump with a ideology
Good possibility. Even the "squad" massively let's US down. Especially AOC.   Voting for Nancy to be speaker.   Biden has a large part to play in how Trump eventually became president. Going down the rebulican lite path (neo-liberlism) making our w Country worse off got US Trump
I am proud to be part of this milestone on Joe Biden‚Äôs path to becoming the 46th President of the United States. We have 83 days to elect fantastic Democrats up &amp; down the ballot, &amp; I will wake up each day ready to get to work. Will you join me, Team Heck? #giveaheck #heck4ltgov
Biden promised every girlboss running he'd make them VP so they'd all endorse a republican rapist racist, then grabbed Kamala based on correcting the news cycle.  Maybe if your idea of political change is getting women into power try not investing is spineless dupes
I am leaning towards 4 more yrs of Trump, instead of 8-12 more years of neo-liberlism.  Why? The progressive push from 3rd parties will continue.  Millions won't go to sleep if Trump wins again.   Biden administration will be pretty much Trump administration.  4yrs less then 8-12
Mr. Smith was sounding decent earlier about beating Biden or Trump.  Now he shows his true political ideology.   Pandering, identity politics &amp; neo-liberlism
REVEALED: Spoiler candidate Kanye West met with Jared Kushner amid efforts to derail Biden campaign -
Biden and Harris gave emotional and dynamic speeches. Whatever this is from Trump is just droning on and on and on...
. is a great contributor to public discourse. In May, tho, she used her WaPo pedestal to advocate something awful. She was &amp; is wrong. She should apologize.  Yet I wonder if she knew in May Biden's Veep reveal would swallow her book release news?
Every Democrat, including Biden and Harris, needs to amplify the need to defend our Postal Service.
I do wish Biden and Harris had attacked Trump for slowing down the mail. This is an issue which affects everyone.
Biden attacked Anita Hill in support of Clarence Thomas. Biden's been on the wrong side of many key issues (abortion, gay marriage) for most of his career. He straight up campaigned for a Republican in 2018. No reason to think he won't nominate some right-wing "compromise" judge.
I just want you to vote against Trump-I get you aren‚Äôt jazzed by Biden but tyranny is real and it isn‚Äôt far from our reality. You don‚Äôt need to do more- just please don‚Äôt convince others to do less.
Those were excellent speeches from Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
Kamala is so much more lively than Biden I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they have her taking the reins to keep him off the tv
In isolation, maybe? I guess? Donnie hasn't plunged us into another Iraq War, so that's at least a point in his favor vs Biden. But Donnie says worse things than Biden does.  But this election isn't in isolation. The people lose either way, either for 4 years or for much longer.
Plus the fact the demand was such a hilarious concession of the point. Five lies in 11 days, from a guy trying to avoid public appearances. Was this person afraid I would name four? I can't even fully attribute the Twitter lie to Biden, as he clearly doesn't run that account.
Yeah, but Joe Biden will probably have someone quite a bit younger help him turn it on.

Young Voters Love Trump's COVID Plan...When Told It's Biden's  via
Idk what to talk about on this weekend's show. Could blabber on about Biden/Harris but who cares. All the leftists lost their Primary in my area. Anybody got links about PNW projects, organizations, upcoming events, reports from protests etc? That's my jam.
It‚Äôs ignorant to vote for someone just because of their political party. Biden will do the exact same things that Trump has done to our country. There are no differences between them. Biden does not give a single shit about minorities. At all.
I was already not voting for Biden and now that he picked Kamala Harris I‚Äôm super not voting for him  (p.s. Trump can fuck off too)
Me too! My heart swelled up with joy, when Biden announced a strong woman as his running mate.
I can't believe that people think that Biden is capable of finding his slippers in his basement. People keep on looking down &amp; not observing what is really going on.
So Biden still did less for America in 40 yrs than Trump has done in 3 1/2 yrs, Thanks, got it! üòÜ
‚Äúwe‚Äôre not voting biden in we‚Äôre voting trump out‚Äù is the stupidest thing I‚Äôve ever heard and shows that people really don‚Äôt care about actual policy or change and just want to have their ‚Äúteam win‚Äù
That's what hard. I get that progressives (like myself) are not happy with the Biden/Harris ticket. I personally am weary of establishment Democrats and how much they are corporate sponsored. Biden had an abysmal record. Harris's is pretty bad too. One problem at a time.
Seriously, this 70 IQ Jimmy Dore level essentialism hobbles us as leftists. I‚Äôve explained 1000 ways why not supporting Biden would be disastrous for the left, and your only response is ‚Äúheh... the DNC is corrupt tho‚Äù   I‚Äôm aware, why not address some actual points dummy
No one should rest until Biden &amp; Harris are sworn in.
Don't fall for these hit pieces on Kamala Harris. Kamala is one of the most progressive lawmakers we have. Do your own research &amp; homework! And vote Biden Harris 2020 November 3rd üó≥
So: 4 years of Biden. That doesn‚Äôt mean we stop there. That‚Äôs 4 years of direct action, 4 years of spreading our message instead of Trump dominating the discourse, 4 years of not getting blamed single handedly for Trump‚Äôs re-election, and 4 years of markedly better policy.
My response is we got even closer but ultimately failed because the DNC was organized enough to pull together last minute behind Biden. If I told you an open democratic socialist was a nut hair away from snagging the dem nomination a decade ago, you would laugh at me.
I think he is being facetious. I'm guessing he's a "blood red" Republican and he's taking a shot at Biden by implying that he's NOT Catholic.
The law for running for President is where the person running was born, not the parents! I wish that could be a loop hole, but Biden won‚Äôt win, so no worries! #Trump2020üá∫üá∏üî•
My heart swelled with joy when Biden picked a strong running mate.
I‚Äôll bet the DNC brought that convention lineup to Biden and leveraged jt into the Kamala pick
Kamala Harris took Biden‚Äôs ticket from a ticket I was voting for out of necessity and desperation to a ticket I‚Äôm excited about.
Kamala Harris does not represent my values anymore then Joe Biden does. However I was never under the impression the VP pick would be an actual labor/socialist/progressive candidate. This ticket is by the wealthy to placate the salary class that feels guilty. Nothing more. üëé
Yeah, for sure. I think something that gets lost in a lot of mainstream discussion of these issues is that for people like me, Bernie was a pretty big compromise. When we get to the point of a Biden/Harris ticket, it goes from being a compromise to an insult.
I tend to believe the change will come (if it ever does) outside of the scope of electoral politics, but I largely agree with Freya here. Biden is a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù choice but my personal political beliefs are such that the difference between the right and ‚Äúleft‚Äù is a rounding error.
Accountability argument isn't going to work. Moving the democrats left is a fucking joke. Democrats have a house majority &amp; Nancy won't even have a vote on #MedicareForAll   Harris record is very conservative &amp; so is Biden.
It is a conservative majority right now &amp; they struck it down.   Supreme Court isn't gonna move anyone. Biden &amp; Harris care about their careers &amp; that's about it.
Supreme Court..... Biden isn't giving 2 shits about the Supreme Court.   Biden picks will be about the same.
Biden &amp; Obama deported 2 million.  Biden was talking about a wall back in the 90s.  Harris is a fucking cop.FUCKING COP!  Biden policies aren't gonna be that different from Trump policies.  It's gonna suck under a Trump or Biden administration.  Neo-liberlism is what got US Trump
A vote for the Biden/Harris ticket will turn the whole country into a üí©hole!!!
Sorry Liz, but what‚Äôs happening in Portland is not happening under Biden/Harris, it‚Äôs happening under Trump/Pence. Why do Republicans always point at the utter destruction under their policy and say ‚Äúsee look what will happen if you elect Democrats? ARE YOU FUCKEN KIDDING ME???
Is that your Biden phonebanking script?
Oh look they already had it lined up to use Kamala's accusations against Biden.
"The Democrats will save us." lol  Trump was able to attack Hillary from the left because Hillary was an awful candidate - almost as bad as Joe.  You can blame me for the world's ills if you want. But I would rather wipe my ass with my vote than ever give it to Biden or Trump.
Joe Biden‚Äôs campaign mate, I think who he chose to as his VP to run with. Kamela Harris.
A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for Kamala Harris. But actually.
Actually biden just loves Trump the communist trogen horse and picked someone that no one liked. He KNOWS THIS and just played your ass. Maybe you should get over yourself and the name calling..
That is a compelling case but I still think Trump being elected for four more years is far worse than Biden and Harris winning. Fighting the establishment Dems is a fight for next year and is a fight I will gladly be a part of. But I think, for now, that Trump needs to go.
bernie happily took another 200 billion and gave it to biden and endorsed him. How many times does he have to stomp on your dick before you wake up?Your protest is noted; however, that doesn't mean it isn't Kanye's intention. Both he and some of his supporters have admitted their purpose is to siphon off votes from Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris. I believe "black folks" are far more sensible than Trump, Jared, &amp; Kanye think.
What you‚Äôre refusing to acknowledge is your own movement‚Äôs culpability in its losses.  It wasn‚Äôt the media, or oligarchal elites, or the Illuminati that defeated you; your movement defeated itself.  Your guy lost to Joe Biden, for God‚Äôs sake, who was no one‚Äôs first choice.

Biden campaign sends scathing statement in response to Trump stoking false conspiracy theory
Ironic how Trump et al attack his foes with ad hominems that more easily fit Trump himself. "Crooked" Trump paying hush money to porn stars with election funds so they don't talk about where he "grabs them by". Biden may kiss babies,  but at least doesn't French them like Trump.
Unfortunate that he reserves those for only self-aggrandizement. What about the key traits of governing such as ethics, compassion, respect, service, et al? You know, those things that Biden has that Donald "Just about me" Trump only sees as obstacles to "winning"?
We have never had such a corrupt President that is backed by a corrupt Senate and Attny General and friends.Biden needs to put many laws in for protection against this ever happening again.
Will admit tho that some of the Never Biden folks are pretty embarrassing even as somebody that generally agrees with the sentiment, some of them *kinda* seem to downplay the badness of Trump and suggest some uh... sus things for a progressive to say imo

Anybody who is insulted that Biden picked a woman for VP needs to be insulted.
White supremacists will be voting for me. They want segregation &amp; are thrilled that I ended the long running program that allowed non-whites to invade their territory. Biden would respect the civil rights of all people, unlike me, who illegally outlawed  ‚Äúcolored‚Äù people renting.
Please stop saying Biden is a transitional candidate. Do you think that‚Äôs helping the country? I love Kamala, she was my 1st choice. But I‚Äôm afraid America is too dumb to survive without ppl (like us) guiding ppl. The left mean well, let‚Äôs focus on getting there &amp; then make fun!
You have to win first: What Joe Biden's pick of Kamala Harris tells us about Biden
Not gonna lie, a Biden/Klobuchar ticket would make me vote 3rd party &amp; look at expatriation options. She's that bad. At least Harris acts like she has an interest in the greater good.

One gaffe was a big one -- nearly a word-for-word speech which had been given previously by a British politician, but with no attribution -- plagiarized liberally.  Biden may had had it handed to him by a staffer, but... the buck had to stop on his desk at some point.
I am so grateful to have a candidate such as Joe Biden who is smart enough to stay silent. Just need to let his opponent keep lying and talking his way out of of reelection. Joe can remain silent until November 3 and easily win re-election.

Idk, i had no idea Biden has an unscalable wall on his property. Oh, it‚Äôs scalable? Ok, so he‚Äôs doing it more for personal use on his own property, and not as a deterrent against immigration to protect an entire fucking country. Maybe trump should invest in a moat as well, lol
I get real nervous when so many radical leftist seem to be promoting violence. Then when already Harris is acting like a dictator. Keep her out it is not about Biden. They will probably eliminate him quickly like they did JFK.

Biden is suffering cognitive progressive failure and it shows in his speach and also in his ability to even have something written for him. Pitiful Biden plagiarized Reagan for his VP announcement.
I‚Äôm not rooting for anyone. I‚Äôm not going to reward Joe Biden for a life of service dedicated to the oppression of my people. Trump is an idiot. Biden and his new whore are focused and determined to keep me at the bottom of society. I‚Äôll take my chances with Trump.
Why would anyone consider voting for Biden when his party is so afraid to have him speak in public? Doesn‚Äôt seem very transparent.

If Biden doesn't get elected the SCOTUS will be incredibly skewed toward the right for the next 20 years. He can't do 2 terms, he's too old.
More like Harris will have Biden killed so she can be the top of the ticket
Oh hey, I almost died from H1N1, but it only killed my financial future. Somewhere out there is a bill I'll never be able to touch while keeping a roof over my head, and that was all under Obama; Biden was there the whole time too, so nothing is gonna change anytime soon
Now that Biden has his VP pick it is 100% clear that whoever wins this election, we are all losing. Big time.
Kamala is exactly what we needed!! This is beautiful.  She put that narcissist buffon in his place and he's fucking scared of her. Go Kamala!!! #Kamala #KamalaHarris #progress #TimeForChange #hope
I did vote for Clinton in '16 but it took my husband reminding me how guilty I would feel if she somehow lost our typically safe blue state. This year I'm excited to vote against Trump and know how much better Biden/Harris will be
So my take on this is that both candidates seek to be President but Trump is relaxing on the train letting others do the work as he coasts along in his comfortable life, while Biden is labouring and doing all the work himself without the glamour and comfort... Trump own goal!

They both agree Biden sexually assaulted women
That‚Äôs kinda how Biden got the job from  Obama. He had some good points on  Obama during the debates. And Biden turned into Obama‚Äôs cheerleader when he was picked. Your fiercest opposition in the debat is usually someone who cares as much as you do. Those who care are good allies
I mean I'm gonna not vote for Biden, but it's not like I have to do that to own the Neolibs. They're getting constantly owned every single day. They think Pete Buttigieg is cool. That's so fucking sad I almost want to vote for Biden out of pity.

Honest question, what if you voted for Obama, and Hilary, and still plan on voting for Biden/Harris, but don‚Äôt like Harris due to her time as DA? Does that makes you a racist?
I love watching you talk about how great Biden is and how much of a lunatic Trump is...  You do realize backing a president who has had 160,000 American souls die on his watch... is probably political suicide.  #EndTheNightmare
If you see baggage, flawed, difficult, ambitious, just stop reading the article.   Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris even after she was mean to him on stage. That's something Trump and a lot of Twitter wouldn't do.
I put up a Biden banner on my profile, but this may be better?
I didn't know that Biden had in him to choose her.  Hell, Yeah, She is the Right Choice for these times.

Kamala Harris is a former police officer, and a member of the Establishment undemocratic party. She has never passed or supported the working class in anyway. IMPEACH BIDEN!
No. He literally said he wanted to prosecute people with my political beliefs like two weeks ago. Fuck Joe Biden. If the Dems think they don't need to reach out to the Left, that's their fucking problem. I'm not letting them threaten me with the GOP as an excuse to be lazy.
So during a time when everyone is screaming for criminal justice reform and police reform, Biden decides to choose Kamala Harris as his VP? This election really is going to hell in a hand basket.
It‚Äôs actually very touching, it‚Äôs about grief:  In the video it is 2 minutes in.

So what you are saying is that the protests that are happening today under the Trump presidency would happen inder a Biden presidency.  In order to stop the protests that are happening with Trump as president will stop if Trump is re-elected.  Your logic is that of a grifter.

Everyone pretty much knows Biden (age 77 now, 78 upon inauguration) will be a one-termer and will be the wedge for his VP to become the 47th president.  That's why he needs to think long and hard about who it's going to be.
I'm fairly certain that all the voters who would be influenced by a bully mocking a disabled reporter, for instance, are so firmly in the Trump camp it would be impossible to pry them out by the sight of Biden one-upping him with his own monkey show. We're going for independents.
Why is Biden so wimpy, biding his time on the VP decision?
CORRUPTION in our faces EVERY SINGLE DAY! I know this gmhas to be fraudulent! There isn‚Äôt a single ethical Republican left in office!

Disagree. Biden made Obama palatable to white voters.  He got Obama to the WH.   Hillary should have chosen Bob Casey of PA.  Conservative D.  He would have gotten those extra votes in PA or MI.
Biden only needs to get 2% of the white vote (&gt; age 45) in six states (MI, PA, OH,FL, WI &amp; AZ. The only woman to poll positively in those states was Harris.
Biden should pick 3 Vice Presidents to appeal to the polyamorous voter.
Biden needs to be more Obama like, and inspire people to vote for him
What are you posing for? Question your own sanity if you follow Biden. He is a very troubled man. Be open to sane change not violent demonstrators that crazy Pelosi &amp; Schumer suport plus Socialism. Your Pose looks like Narcissism.

Most important to me was Bernie's modest opposition to the wars + MIC. I want an anti-imperialist, Bernie was a compromise. Biden... Yeah. Hell no.  #VoteGreen2020
So that means you will stand with us after the USA elections when the popular vote is the election of Biden? Vs the fascism under 45?
I really wouldn't be so confident Malcolm would vote for Joe Biden, or that he would give any credence whatsoever to the broader liberal-versus-conservative framework.
Thread! My view of this is different than other ppl‚Äôs + I totally get not wanting to vote for Biden like,,, fuck him! I think getting trump out is a harm reduction strategy only if we don‚Äôt return to complacency but it‚Äôs not my place to tell marginalized communities how to vote.
This tweet is just enraging me for so many reasons. If they instead endorse Biden, would that be a better thing? And what do you mean by ‚Äúpotential‚Äù problem, as if civil servants should ever be giving political endorsements even through a representative.
This Biden?
Biden will heart just as many of not more people, we can at least use Trump to hurt the right people.  The DNC wants to play dirty politics  I'm game
And you're not very convincing, I've at least cited all my shit, nor am I insulting, insulting people doesn't really make me wanna vote for Biden
Oh this ain't a hate vote, he earned it by being more in favor of Medicare for all than Biden, and by giving me 1200 dollars. He's the most liberal president I've had in my lifetime that's for sure
Biden says that under him nothing will change so not sure how that's an argument against Trump
It's alright I understand, I just think it's best to go on the offensive. Progressives won't win bending the knee to biden
I live in Washington. In the d primaries they voted joe biden. I dont know a single person who voted for him. They all went Bernie. I doubt they'll go trump because of the institutional corruption. We have 3 counties who go blue. If we had real elections. Trump would win easily
If Biden wins, do you think he‚Äôll resign before his term his is up so that Pence will pardon him? Is this a possibility?
Trump's even more supportive of universal healthcare than Biden is  please understand, Trump can be used as a weapon against the establishment.
Trump wants your vote, I am a Bernie supporter who's gone Trump, in my eyes, the best way to get the corperate Dems out is to embarrass them in front of America by losing to Trump. It's worked well so far, it'd work even better if Biden loses.  Join me brother, please. Fuck DNC.
Joe Biden has already forgotten that he's getting the nomination.
All of them need to be arrested for treason, and if Biden doesn‚Äôt do that I will not vote for his 2nd term!

No it isn't, infact I'd say it's better. Biden in more against Medicare for all than Trump after all.
I am sure biden will slaughter trump on the fake popular vote and trump will win. Just to piss them off as they play both sides.
That's hilarious. You call Kamala, our future Vice President, a nasty woman. You You can't honestly believe you respect any woman in the entire world. You wanna build a statue? Make it of Kamala, because she's going to make history by helping Biden take you down.
I think it comes down to, like in most coups, if the military will back him.  W Biden as the other choice I think theyre not gonna take sides cus its win/win  If anyone willing to cut the millitary budget were the dem pic itd be another story

Neither Biden nor Harris have great criminal justice track records. While I am hopeful that they will take this country to the next level, my fear is that many will see it as the stopping point for the grassroots work.
Seriously I 'd be thrilled if Biden/Kamala delivered one of these. Ecstatic if more than one.
's choice of  gives me hope. Biden has shown that he's not afraid to elevate someone who will make him look bad if it's for the good of our Nation.  I'm 100% behind this ticket. So happy  is on it!

"Biden settled on Harris only after an exhaustive review that forged new political alliances, deepened existing rivalries and further elevated a cohort of women as leaders in their party." I liked how the process gave the candidates deserved appreciation.

This is why lesser of 2 evils voting g is problematic. Joe Biden is supposed the most left DNC platform ever but somehow it's way less progressive than every Dem platform until 1980? Literally hasn't been an opposition party since Reagan.
It's going to Joe Biden's campaign. There something democrats are great at, exploiting black people.   I seem to recall having a civil war to correct this kind of stuff, but what can you do? Some have a short memory.

Oh, they've been trying it hard recently. If it makes them feel better to blame me for their candidates sucking shit, then they can blame me if they want. But I would rather wipe my ass with my vote than ever give it to either Joe Biden or Donald Trump.
In the beginning (perhaps, like 48 hours ago) the idea seemed, so exciting (I‚Äôm sure), &amp; the people were overjoyed, but now ‚Äînullified! Obama gave him two terms &amp; now he‚Äôs working Kamala Harris to give him two terms. Joe Biden loves to work the minority &amp; reap all the gain. üëä

Nothing about Biden. Not a fan of or Harris whatsoever.  "COLLAPSE" look around in your America!!! Get your shit together &amp; force a huge stimulus check for the Rest of the year!!!!
Since one could argue Biden is worse than Trump - he shares many of Trump's flaws, has a longer track record of doing so, and has accomplishments like the Iraq War that Donnie still hasn't achieved - you'll forgive me if I take a pass on your Red Team versus Blue Team bullshit.

Powers of the VP are limited. This a Trump vs Biden race. Joe Biden has served as VP for 2 terms. If he wins, this will be his 3rd term in the WH. Thus, 12 years in the White House. I wouldn‚Äôt say he‚Äôs qualified. I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs greedy &amp; jealous. So, he put Kamala in the mix.

I muted Joe Biden. Trying to decide whether to undo it. üòû
Everyone who says they would have voted for Biden if not for Harris is a Trump supporter.  And always was.  Whether actively or passively.
Bill, she's phony because she accused  of being a racist, and believes his sexual assault accuser...yet, is willing to be is running mate?   Crocodile tears for Biden banning bussing, yet all smiles accepting the nomination.   That qualifies as phony to me!
It brings tears to my eyes of how proud I am but the winner takes all. Once a ‚Äúman‚Äù becomes President the campaign game is over &amp; everything changes. This a Donald Trump vs Joe Biden (who, has already served as VP &amp; understands the procedure) election for Office of the President.
Thank you. Voting Biden/Harris. Also, beware Russian bots and the crap they spew. It‚Äôs amazing how many people lap it up and regurgitate it.
Even if i didnt want a boost   FUCK JOE BIDEN
That's the point.   Biden or Saager????   Actual progressive people that don't have a voice in the Democratic party would vote for Saager. Especially when it comes to a lot of economic issues.  It's not the person.(no duh, I would rather have krystal) it's about any progress
At least you are showing Biden doing something you are incapable of!
This is in fact, really good and worth watching. They shoot straight past the bullshit about Biden/Harris and go right into applying what we know about Movement theory and power relations to our situation now and what to focus on. All of their points are interesting. Good show ü§ò
Yeah. People can vote for Biden if they want. I understand the train of thought. But this "Biden is a good guy / good candidate" thing is an insult to my intelligence AND ignores the important fact that even if he wins you will have to fight against him for every bit of progress.
Joe biden supports antifa because he is a communist just like Trump and the rest. As backed by the communist central bankers who took this country when they killed lincoln. Its called HISTORY.
2.  Legitimacy of the outcome.  His tactic is to overwhelm the system with shit.  So, anything less than a total landslide with all 50 states certifying electors sufficient to give Biden a clear 270 electoral votes, will create the confusion that raises this scenario.

This gets into one of the major problems with American politics, and why Obama/Biden led us directly into Trump (and why Biden/Harris would deliver us into the next Trump). Trump singles out Democrats as lying out-of-touch elitists working against Americans' interests...
I gave you an honest answer. I don't fuckin' waste my time with Joe Biden webcasts or whatever. Better things to do.  Many of his lies are promises (or crafted non-promises) he has no intention of keeping. I can't strictly prove it's a lie, but you're a fool if you believe him.

200% agree.  I rather have  as president. It's about making the country better. Saager _ I could agree on many things.  I don't agree with much at all when it comes to Biden &amp; Harris. If I do they don't go far enough for the betterment of the American people
The PANDEMIC is highlighting all the failures of our duopoly for the last many decades.   They people like US to close our eyes, shut our mouths &amp; turn off independent thinking &amp; vote 4 biden &amp; Harris. That will eventually lead to a smarter, more organized Trump with a ideology
Good possibility. Even the "squad" massively let's US down. Especially AOC.   Voting for Nancy to be speaker.   Biden has a large part to play in how Trump eventually became president. Going down the rebulican lite path (neo-liberlism) making our w Country worse off got US Trump

Biden promised every girlboss running he'd make them VP so they'd all endorse a republican rapist racist, then grabbed Kamala based on correcting the news cycle.  Maybe if your idea of political change is getting women into power try not investing is spineless dupes
I am leaning towards 4 more yrs of Trump, instead of 8-12 more years of neo-liberlism.  Why? The progressive push from 3rd parties will continue.  Millions won't go to sleep if Trump wins again.   Biden administration will be pretty much Trump administration.  4yrs less then 8-12
Mr. Smith was sounding decent earlier about beating Biden or Trump.  Now he shows his true political ideology.   Pandering, identity politics &amp; neo-liberlism
REVEALED: Spoiler candidate Kanye West met with Jared Kushner amid efforts to derail Biden campaign -

. is a great contributor to public discourse. In May, tho, she used her WaPo pedestal to advocate something awful. She was &amp; is wrong. She should apologize.  Yet I wonder if she knew in May Biden's Veep reveal would swallow her book release news?
Every Democrat, including Biden and Harris, needs to amplify the need to defend our Postal Service.
I do wish Biden and Harris had attacked Trump for slowing down the mail. This is an issue which affects everyone.
Biden attacked Anita Hill in support of Clarence Thomas. Biden's been on the wrong side of many key issues (abortion, gay marriage) for most of his career. He straight up campaigned for a Republican in 2018. No reason to think he won't nominate some right-wing "compromise" judge.
I just want you to vote against Trump-I get you aren‚Äôt jazzed by Biden but tyranny is real and it isn‚Äôt far from our reality. You don‚Äôt need to do more- just please don‚Äôt convince others to do less.
Those were excellent speeches from Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
Kamala is so much more lively than Biden I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they have her taking the reins to keep him off the tv
In isolation, maybe? I guess? Donnie hasn't plunged us into another Iraq War, so that's at least a point in his favor vs Biden. But Donnie says worse things than Biden does.  But this election isn't in isolation. The people lose either way, either for 4 years or for much longer.
Not one time have I heard Vice President Biden say "My Administration"! What a difference this makes for America. #BidenHarris2020
Plus the fact the demand was such a hilarious concession of the point. Five lies in 11 days, from a guy trying to avoid public appearances. Was this person afraid I would name four? I can't even fully attribute the Twitter lie to Biden, as he clearly doesn't run that account.

It‚Äôs ignorant to vote for someone just because of their political party. Biden will do the exact same things that Trump has done to our country. There are no differences between them. Biden does not give a single shit about minorities. At all.
I was already not voting for Biden and now that he picked Kamala Harris I‚Äôm super not voting for him  (p.s. Trump can fuck off too)
Me too! My heart swelled up with joy, when Biden announced a strong woman as his running mate.
I can't believe that people think that Biden is capable of finding his slippers in his basement. People keep on looking down &amp; not observing what is really going on.
So Biden still did less for America in 40 yrs than Trump has done in 3 1/2 yrs, Thanks, got it! üòÜ
‚Äúwe‚Äôre not voting biden in we‚Äôre voting trump out‚Äù is the stupidest thing I‚Äôve ever heard and shows that people really don‚Äôt care about actual policy or change and just want to have their ‚Äúteam win‚Äù
That's what hard. I get that progressives (like myself) are not happy with the Biden/Harris ticket. I personally am weary of establishment Democrats and how much they are corporate sponsored. Biden had an abysmal record. Harris's is pretty bad too. One problem at a time.
Seriously, this 70 IQ Jimmy Dore level essentialism hobbles us as leftists. I‚Äôve explained 1000 ways why not supporting Biden would be disastrous for the left, and your only response is ‚Äúheh... the DNC is corrupt tho‚Äù   I‚Äôm aware, why not address some actual points dummy
No one should rest until Biden &amp; Harris are sworn in.
Don't fall for these hit pieces on Kamala Harris. Kamala is one of the most progressive lawmakers we have. Do your own research &amp; homework! And vote Biden Harris 2020 November 3rd üó≥
So: 4 years of Biden. That doesn‚Äôt mean we stop there. That‚Äôs 4 years of direct action, 4 years of spreading our message instead of Trump dominating the discourse, 4 years of not getting blamed single handedly for Trump‚Äôs re-election, and 4 years of markedly better policy.
My response is we got even closer but ultimately failed because the DNC was organized enough to pull together last minute behind Biden. If I told you an open democratic socialist was a nut hair away from snagging the dem nomination a decade ago, you would laugh at me.
I think he is being facetious. I'm guessing he's a "blood red" Republican and he's taking a shot at Biden by implying that he's NOT Catholic.
The law for running for President is where the person running was born, not the parents! I wish that could be a loop hole, but Biden won‚Äôt win, so no worries! #Trump2020üá∫üá∏üî•

I‚Äôll bet the DNC brought that convention lineup to Biden and leveraged jt into the Kamala pick
Really, watch her first debate with Biden. Attacking him, blame blame blame, as she incarcerated minorities..She is a phony, egotistical, and a female version of the current DC executive leadership
Kamala Harris took Biden‚Äôs ticket from a ticket I was voting for out of necessity and desperation to a ticket I‚Äôm excited about.
Kamala Harris does not represent my values anymore then Joe Biden does. However I was never under the impression the VP pick would be an actual labor/socialist/progressive candidate. This ticket is by the wealthy to placate the salary class that feels guilty. Nothing more. üëé
Yeah, for sure. I think something that gets lost in a lot of mainstream discussion of these issues is that for people like me, Bernie was a pretty big compromise. When we get to the point of a Biden/Harris ticket, it goes from being a compromise to an insult.
I tend to believe the change will come (if it ever does) outside of the scope of electoral politics, but I largely agree with Freya here. Biden is a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù choice but my personal political beliefs are such that the difference between the right and ‚Äúleft‚Äù is a rounding error.
Accountability argument isn't going to work. Moving the democrats left is a fucking joke. Democrats have a house majority &amp; Nancy won't even have a vote on #MedicareForAll   Harris record is very conservative &amp; so is Biden.
It is a conservative majority right now &amp; they struck it down.   Supreme Court isn't gonna move anyone. Biden &amp; Harris care about their careers &amp; that's about it.
Supreme Court..... Biden isn't giving 2 shits about the Supreme Court.   Biden picks will be about the same.
Biden &amp; Obama deported 2 million.  Biden was talking about a wall back in the 90s.  Harris is a fucking cop.FUCKING COP!  Biden policies aren't gonna be that different from Trump policies.  It's gonna suck under a Trump or Biden administration.  Neo-liberlism is what got US Trump
Biden would be like ‚Äúc‚Äômon man‚Äù and discourage Hitler from genociding
It‚Äôs almost like these people are bad and have no moral backbone and will always say whatever is best for them in any given moment.
A vote for the Biden/Harris ticket will turn the whole country into a üí©hole!!!
Sorry Liz, but what‚Äôs happening in Portland is not happening under Biden/Harris, it‚Äôs happening under Trump/Pence. Why do Republicans always point at the utter destruction under their policy and say ‚Äúsee look what will happen if you elect Democrats? ARE YOU FUCKEN KIDDING ME???Nice comeback.

He's far from trumps billions. Biden doesn't disparage them either. See how trump divides people?
Biden himself said he was looking to be a one term President...  I wanted Bernie, but I guess we just can't have nice things.  But that's why I'm a fucking communist now.
But Biden was the VP of Obama for 8 years. Wasn‚Äôt that enough to erase white politics and end social injustice. Are these people even serious about what they say/promise.
Dude, trump did this himself. When there are photos and warnings from the PO that things are getting taken away or slowed down, how is this even remotely considered Biden‚Äôs? Trump is in charge NOW
It's unclear that [Biden] winning at the ballot box is going to solve very many of the problems that might be causing the revolutionary tension.

Well, bless your heart for that huge laugh! üòÇ But, if Biden were to pull it off, I doubt it would be years....Old Joe can barely remember which day it is, much less what he‚Äôs running for. I‚Äôd give it a month maybe??
That‚Äôs right, and Kellyanne was just on  ranting that it‚Äôs now on  to provide a Covid plan which of course he has been sharing daily in an effort to help Americans.  Failed  cannot get the job done so blames others
At least you can name something Trump has done. Can‚Äôt say that about Biden or Obama!üòÇ
If your take is ‚ÄúTrump and Biden are both trash so I‚Äôm not gonna vote‚Äù You‚Äôre basically saying you‚Äôre fine with how things are currently tbh
That Kamala Harris youthful exuberance &amp; confidence totally overshadowed Joe Biden today - and that's ok #mamala
Interesting that you pointed to her, I've said that this is turning into the Democratic version of McCain vs Obama... Biden and Harris are the antithesis of what their party wants and although Trump isn't favorable, the 'hold your nose and vote' doesn't inspire people.
Joe Biden was a member of the first Biracial administration. Now he will continue that as a new tradition, and make another first as a member of the first Bigender administration.  Hell Trump can claim to record for most corrupt.  #VoteBrightBlueAmerica
Of course that's what you want because you know Biden is slippin
If Biden can not debate Trump, how would he run the country?  It is a very very weak move by a very weak man.  Your suggestion that there be no debates just reminds me that the man has locked himself in his basement afraid to speak.
Biden is Catholic
And here you are, passive aggressively tweeting and hiding. Faceless for a reason? Just vote the Biden ticket and get over yourself. üôÑüôÑüôÑ
Trump is only wrong in that this would happen if Biden gets elected. He could lose the election to  and we‚Äôd all be better off.
The Trump Camp should troll Biden by adding ‚Äúhair sniffing‚Äù on theirs.
You think Sleepy Joe Biden, the most establishment politician that ran this year would choose a VP that actually wants fundamental change? Keep dreaming, brotha.
Another winner of a decision by Mr Biden.
Just a very gentle reminder that we can (and should) criticize Biden/Harris while also realizing that they are both 1000X better than the current jackasses.
"Joe Biden nailed this decision. By choosing Senator Kamala Harris as America's next vice president, he's underscored his own judgment and character. Reality shows us that these attributes are not optional in a president."  - Barack Obama on Biden-Harris
PS: I‚Äôm still not voting Biden üëπ
Are you kidding me, Jamie? That is the most bizarre case of TDS I have seen yet! And they call #QAnon2020 conspiracy theorist??!! üòÇ ü§£ üòÇ ü§£ Well, this was my laugh of the day along w/  being Biden‚Äôs pick for Prez.
So, I‚Äôm a centrist.  I think Biden/Harris Is the Dems‚Äô absolute best chance to pick up the presidency in 2020.  I‚Äôm reading the sour grapes from the far left on Twitter, this afternoon, and I‚Äôm reminded of this quote from The Newsroom:
And It Begins!! SHE WONT TELL BIDEN TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT...Harris: 'I believe' Biden accusers
Good stuff right here. I'm not a Trump fan however, this Biden/Harris ticket is just a sinking ship. #Biden2020 #KamalaHarris
If Tulsi was his running mate, Trump would have no chance but Biden is a dumbass

I am a follower of Biden cause I want to hear what that idiot has to say next.  It did not take long for me to figure out that he is too stupid to write his own tweets.
Second World War (??) Trump running neck n neck with Biden in the race for most gaffes  Let's just call it a draw &amp; move on
I am sorry Mr Biden, a socialist government does not work for me or most Americans.  You can take your plans and put them away cause you will not ever have a chance to implement them.  Thanks but no thanks.
It means China thinks they can work with Biden and HOPES he wins. Russia likes Trump and is CHEATING our systems to HELP him win.

Christie should tell trump to get a dog, ride a bike and show true empathy and he‚Äôll at least be  1% of Biden
This all day long. Biden‚Äôs not bragging about riding a bike, just doing it. Trump uses drinking one handed in a rally as a strength!
Whoever Biden's twitter writer is, is clueless.  Biden is now completely out of the picture.  I suspect he will start using AI for his videos.  I demand he start appearing in person!

Biden last seen on a bicycle, you're last seen on a golf cart, big comparison, big, no one has ever seen anything like that before.
We have a virtual reality candidate.  AI has advanced enough to allow someone to look like Biden and actually be someone else!!!!  Is this what is happening?  It most certainly could be happening.  Trump can not agree to a virtual reality debate!!
How many strikes does Biden get before MSM decides its a lost cause?  ha ha ha... I think they should double down.

That sounds like a conspiracy theory, Mr Biden.  You don't believe in conspiracies do you?  Once you wake up, the election should be over and you will have lost.... if they let you actually run.... bwa ha ha ha ha ha...
How the fuck is Trump and Biden the BEST America has to offer smh üòÖ
Biden is a racist!  He is so racist after 50 years of hurting minorities that he doesn‚Äôt understand how to correct for it. Trump 2020!
What planet are these people on?  I see it as msm are so biased toward Biden that nobody believes in them any more.   You could say they are so stupid it‚Äôs backfired.  Nobody wants their opinion any more.
We don't need to attract repubs to Biden. We need to attract the other 45% of people who are independent and often don't bother to vote. Repubs are always going to vote for real Repugs over Repug-Lite in bigger numbers. Excite the base who's more progressive if you want to win!
So, the dems are trying to mislead again and say the Russians are interfering again with the elections.  Being as nice as possible, you would have to be naive to fall for that again.  It certainly does not require Russia to find a way to denigrate Biden.  He does it to himself.
Setting for Biden is not an option.
I don‚Äôt care if Joe Biden can‚Äôt ride a tricycle, pees his pants and can only say three words... he is still light years ahead of Donald Trump. If Joe Biden takes a nap for four years straight he will have a better presidency than Trump
My 23 year old College Junior (he took a couple years to find himself before college...lived in Leipzig, Germany coaching American football at 19) sent me this yesterday.  Yes he is registered to vote and says all his friends are voting Biden. He‚Äôs in Arkansas.
Where is Biden‚Äôs helmet?
I dont understand why people think he would take Biden votes. Only people insane enough to vote for Trump will vote for Kanye.
Read the thread. China and Iran may be advocates for Biden. There is no sign that they are attempting to subvert our election.  Russia on the other hand is actively trying to subvert our election in favor of Trump. Ron Johnson and Chuck Grassley are helping them. MAGA Senators
John Lewis.  Dig him up and he‚Äôs more articles than Biden.
receiving Russian info on Biden to help Trump?
I bet Biden iz excited about finding out who his running mate will be.
why do you have someone writing your twitter messages.  Trump writes his own.  You should have Biden learn how to communicate with the public.  This is a freaking disgrace.
Unless Biden is elected.No one cares about Hunter Biden. You are killing people with your sabotage of the Postal Service. You are killing people with your disdain for us concerning the corona virus and the economy. Not to mention what you are doing to the children and elderly. You are evil.
People can say nasty things about Trump and his family. But now actress are making sure you can't say a bad thing about Harris. She is not fit to be vice president as Biden is not fit to be president.
So he‚Äôs going to be voting for Biden/Harris then?
You obviously haven‚Äôt seen unbiased polls then. You act like Biden is better than Trump.
You‚Äôre holding that one thing over her entire idealogy. Why not hold pedophilia over Biden‚Äôs head in the same way you criticize a woman with a PhD?
That‚Äôs all you can say? So let‚Äôs reflect on how Trump is literally racist and Biden‚Äôs campaign team is exploiting a black woman to gain more votes. What do you have to say to that? A quote from Biden, ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt vote for me, you ain‚Äôt black‚Äù. Is that NOT racism?
If you have done your research, you would know that is false. You‚Äôre 17. You‚Äôre literally just throwing your opinion out there without facts to back it up. I‚Äôm sure your parents are voting for Biden so you just hopped on the train so you could act more mature.
Biden‚Äôs campaign team was lowkey exploiting the BLM movement when they chose a black female to be his VP.... a quote from Biden, ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt vote for me, you ain‚Äôt black.‚Äù How does that make you feel?
Biden and Trump are pleasing boomers. Dr. Jo Jorgenson has proved that she is more interested in modern issues. My vote will reflect my morals. My morals do not support racism or pedophilia.
Biden will likely be sitting in a comfortable recliner with a drool cup in hand. Harris, and the energetic far left collectivists will be calling the shots. Cultural disintegration, corroding The Constitution is ongoing. Like the paint on your car peeling, exposed to rusting.
Can we please shut down or sue Fox News when Biden and Harris WIN? VOTE Blue!
It is Bernie using force lighting on Biden. Why would my pic be anything else?
He's far from trumps billions. Biden doesn't disparage them either. See how trump divides people?
Dude, trump did this himself. When there are photos and warnings from the PO that things are getting taken away or slowed down, how is this even remotely considered Biden‚Äôs? Trump is in charge NOW
Does anyone else wonder how Biden can tweet but not finish an audible sentence?
Sure, Hillary can serve in a Biden Administration. Joe will have a cheeseburger and fries. Hold the onions.

We will be rejoicing after you are voted out. We will celebrate your loss! We will be elated by your demise ! We will dance once you are convicted of crimes against our country! We will dance when Biden is the president! Good bye EVIL TRUMP!
Bullshit...Biden is incompetent and your character is seriously flawed. What possibly could go wrong in a Biden/Harris administration? How about the collapse of the U.S. economy, accelerated erosion of  constitutional rights, and armed conflict within our borders.
I can‚Äôt wait until I can say President Biden!!
Trump looks in a mirror and pretends what he sees is Biden. He may not have the intellectual capacity to realize it, but he‚Äôs talking about himself. About the only things he is good at is lying and projection.
Sure, let's go full government dictatorship. Trump, the authoritarian, needs to become even more authoritarian--like Biden and (especially) Harris. You ever hear of states, and the Constitution as it applies to state and federal authority.
I'm a white woman going to vote for #Biden. I like #KamalaHarris. #BidenHarris2020
Joe Biden raised $26 million in the 24 hours after he named Kamala Harris as his running mate, doubling his previous one-day record.

I can not believe how stupid people are on this page.  They are going to sit out of the race and not vote for Biden. What ignorance and arrogance. Not to mention the privilege that you have in order to sit this one out. Trump will be elected because of these morons. Black men?

Hey girl, let's do this! BIDEN/HARRIS2020üéâ
Jo has no chance of winning this cycle. She and the Independent party stand to kill and replace the GOP by endorsing thr Biden/Harris ticket. Harris, being the most pro-cop Dem, can attract disillusioned GOP voters. Jo can gain in the long run by playing ball now.

This is the depression talking, but at this point I don‚Äôt f***ing care about Biden‚Äòs shortcomings. 45‚Äôs negligence has helped kill multiple friends and family members in three months. I‚Äôm done. I don‚Äôt care who gets him out or what they‚Äôve done,  I just need him f***ing gone.

Biden picked the cop :(
Of course that is only one aspect of the prison issue. There are the 3 strikes laws, the overly harsh drug penalties. Something Biden had a hand in and has apologized for.   trump is calling Harris "nasty" for standing up to Biden.  Biden rewards her.  That is #BidenIntegrity
Trump four more years! Thank you Biden.
