I’m sure you find this racist, or sone how a white supremacist move
He is a bigger idiot than Trump, and you guys are going to vote for him
Not more nervous than this guy! My wife is black and she is way more scared of this idiot than Trump....
If joe picks Bass, will she go up against Pence, or Trump in the debates? Or, both?
Thread by  You all know why Trump has now left the White House - being seen off by the entire WH staff before he traveled to Oe he won't be back for awhile - to go to his resort in Bedminster, NJ, right? Everybody focuses on SPYGATE SPYGAT…
I have a feeling the NRA won’t be the only organization not survive the Trump occupation. I believe Trump has done what Bush didn’t... finally put the last nail in the coffin for what was known as the Republican Party.
Never trump never knows they want a Bush to lose nicely
After I saw Trump blast the press, it just got a whole lot better.
Trust in President Trump. I was watching a video and it was said that the people who are against the rioting have not started retaliating because we are the better people and we are letting them exterminate themselves. We need to continue to be patient it will all be over soon.
One of Trump’s Antichrist friends!
EO to announce that Trump is now in favor of #Obamacare
You’re right and I’m not disagreeing with any of that. In the NFL, that old school mentality you mentioned is alive and well. Those owners don’t care about the pandemic. It’s all business to them. Remember they’re mostly Trump supporters.
*LAST CALL*   12 of these Paw-tastic babies left until we can re-up again.    Seeing as fabric is hard to come by, well I'm just not sure when that'll be!  Last 12 will be 10% off until gone!
While  and  are fighting for extended unemployment benefits for the millions who are still out of work, Trump is in Bedminster, entering a room full of rich white guys, yuckin it up, as Hail To The Chief plays. #LetThemEatCovid
DaWhites wanna own the libs so badly they’re willing to risk their lives and their kids’ lives just to see Trump. That shit is crazy as hell!
Also, russia messed the the polls last time and are continuing to do so because trump is fine with them helping him again. It’s sadly, the only way he can “win.” #RepublicansCheat
Kemp went all in for Trump, and now he can't admit he was wrong, even if it means thousands more GA citizens dying.
A place where Trump's base would never be allowed to enter
He said it both ways. So even Trump seems to recognize his error.
Blame!! Trump!!🤬
China and Iran and the UK and Australia and Canada and most of the world know Trump is a loose cannon who can’t be trusted. Of course they’re all ready to get rid of him. That doesn’t mean they’re interfering in our elections like Russia is.
#LeningradLindsey is telling Trump to stand firm against putting $600 per week in the hands of hard working Americans, to stand firm against money to states to fight #COVID19 and to stand firm against funding schools to keep our kids safe.  stands firm for families.
Just imagine if this was Trump.  24/7 wall to wall hysteria from the media.  Nothing Biden says or does even gets a notice.  Pathetic bias.  #UsVsThem
When Mitch bowed out, he conceded midfield. Trump has to have something to run on going into the election. Nancy has the ball at her feet and an open net. This is am easy score.
First off, he did not grow up rich, that was your candidate. Joe's father was a used car salesman. It was Trump that did a quid pro quo in the Ukraine. Not Joe. You're confused Grandma. I've never heard him say he has all the answers. Take my advise, do research.
The way Trump confidently proclaims that no one has done more for black Americans than himself is um ... that’s delusional
If I took a shot for every time Trump has said fake news in this interview 💀
I’m watching the entire interview that HBO did with Trump, the interviewer said “1,000 people are dying a day” and that orange man said “people are dying it is what it is” why do people support him 💀
Trump’s EO about tiktok
Considering trump CAN'T do anything that require funds , it means NOTHING
Glad to finally hear someone in the church saying this out loud.
Wow, some somewhat honest reporting from  Of course China wants Biden to win, they know he won't be as tough on them as Trump. Trump's trade deals will mean trillions of future dollars to the US. Just one more reason we must re-elect President Trump.
Danchenko, a Russian lives in Washington D.C told FBI in Jan 2017 that Steele, a former MI6 officer, tasked him in June 2016 to dig up dirt on Trump. Steele was hired in May 2016 by Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm working for the Clinton &amp; DNC.
Herman Cain, the former Republican presidential candidate, businessman and close ally of President Donald Trump, was guided by his Christian faith in politics, business and his personal life, his pastor said at his funeral Friday.
Trump loves nothing better than these polls that paint him as the underdog. I wouldn't be surprised if he's not somehow responsible for their looney predictions!
Time to stop these talks before the Republicans cave. President Trump’s EO is exactly what we need (-) extra $600 unemp
Trump vaccine official: 'I would resign instantly' if pressured politically
No, Trump knows it’s right for Americans.
No, I’m not going to ponder why my opinion that Mary Trump is a hack doesn’t matter because of my whiteness. 🙄
trump has put more time and effort into trying to ban tiktok than he has into trying to control the pandemic wtf is happening
Do you think all the libs that support legalization of weed are going to support her, after she prosecuted hundreds and then bragged about smoking it herself? Oh, and the clips of her attacking Biden at the dem debates are going to be great for the Trump ads. This for a start.
great thread.  At this point, do Trump supporters even read?
In all my 60 plus years, I've never seen a more DISGUSTING human being as Donald J Trump
I think if Biden wins by voter fraud then there will be an all out civil war. I don't think Trump wants this to happen.
Dems are Party of Elites and tired of a two tiers justice system w lifetime polictian billionaires! Trump represents America and is fighting for our rights and freedoms. Biden &amp; Dems sold our country soul to China and laundered billions if not trillions thru Ukraine!
Nothing is as it seems &amp; that is certainly true with this article.  Read the headline, then read the article, then tell me if you think there is 1 chance in a million that Biden wins.  One BIG elephant in the room not mentioned - Biden's cognitive issues.
Yeah, sure. I heard Biden say in his typical dull witted way, that prosecuting Trump after he leaves office could be seen as  political revenge and a threat to Democracy. What he's really saying is it's politically destructive to him.
When trump goes on CNN, MSNBC, YOUTUBE, TOWN HALLS, PODCASTS, CBS, and all others Biden has done
He isn’t doing this because he cares, he’s not doing it because he wants to be president, he’s not doing this because he’s a good guy, because we all know he isn’t. He’s doing this because his BFF has shitty numbers and HES trying to keep Trump as president. Kanye is a POS
Trump has done nothing for the black community and how would you even know? Are you black? No? There's a seat over there then
I'm very aware of who both are. There aren't any 'non-racist' options. That's been my entire life story. But I'm married to a dreamer and Trump wants to make it harder for people like my wife to stay here; so why would I vote for his particular racism? A real answer...
Yes orange man bad and trump voter bad, much better. Bravo. 🤡
It's been  fixed since the beginning. McConnell has decided Trump will lose and his only hope to remain Majority Leader is to protect his Senators from political accountability. He is taking advantage of Trump's vanity in order shift responsibility. Only voters lose.
Election interference! If Trump ads get banned so should Bidens .
God must be pained as he watches trump assault humanity.
“If you are have trouble deciding whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black.” -Joe Biden
Ugh. You’re going to fuck this all up. I just feel it. And you have a complete lightweight in  leading this. We’re going to end up with four more years of Trump if you don’t get your shit together and learn how to be a street fighter. AND replace
It’s rather disappointing that he ended like this. Because I discovered him through his Fairly Oddparents reviews and thought he was a funny guy. Ever since that Trump rant, he’s been on a downward spiral.
No, he didn't.   And if he hadn't ignored it and called it a hoax back him January, and hadn't fired the pandemic response team, this wouldn't have gotten this bad.  This is Trump fault. This is his plague.
Not 1 single trump supporter is thinking about voting for Kanye, he is only doing this to take votes from Biden. Kanye has absolutely no chance of winning!
United States v. Fred Trump and Donald Trump. Violates Fair Housing Act by effectively banning minority residents. “Nice try”
So wait, is Trump suggesting Biden is more powerful that God?
9 out of 12 for 424. Easier than usual?
I started out as Never Trump! But all the republicans who enabled him by refusing to hold him accountable have convinced me to to NEVER VOTE FOR ANY REPUBLICAN, EVER AGAIN. #NeverRepublican
As of right now . Even Fox News says if Biden refuses to debate Trump . Trump will lose the election . It does not look good for us at all .
Donald J Trump is working with   Russia,  China, North Korea to overthrow American democracy and its relations for almost 5 year's now. They have successfully influenced one election gaining the end result they were working for and holding that gained power since 2016.
Fired??? He’ll be eating hamberders in Bedminster NJ with Trump on Saturday.
Wow,  everyday Trump gets more desperate!
I’m old and married, but the Trump question would have been asked prior to the first date.
This hurting God deal is another key point in the Shit Show we call the Trump campaign. I killed over 160K Americans. Biden will hurt God.
Yes this is a winner for Trump. A sign of pure genius. It’s likely to be a major debate question. Vote for me I banned Tik Tok.
This gaff doesn’t hurt you with me. I’d vote for a goat in a dress before I’d vote for trump.
Trump's not at fault. The more b's you guys post the more it becomes obvious what's really going on. So keep the propaganda coming. Your putting kids and women on the front line of protest. Cowards
Funny you accept Trump’s lies
My wife's from there. It's fitting
Humility? Seriously. The guy can't define humility. A president that requires a teleprompter and strings to function is just that. A puppet
Trump really think he taking this from us. bro just stop 😂
Well now. Trump decided to ban companies from doing business with Chinese companies like Tencent. I am pretty sure he doesn't know nor care but he may have caused a huge crash in the gaming/tech industry in the USA because of it. Tencent owns a very large portion of the gaming
So, FIRST, Bkacks aren’t black if they vote for Trump. NOW, the Black Community isn’t diverse? And,  is racist? I’ve never heard the President spout this kind of crap!!
I don't know. Because nothing good can happen, probably not. The only silver lining in this election cycle would be the two brain addled, racist ramblings of Biden v Trump. We probably won't even get that.
“Trump bans LoL”   Future headlines write themselves
I think the more these are worn that it will fix itself. They had these and any masks that are President Trump related.
President Donald Trump on Thursday issued an executive order that would ban the social media app TikTok from operating in the US in 45 days if it is not sold by its Chinese parent company ByteDance
We never should have allowed anything to be shut down.  I never saw anything like this under any virus under the previous administration.  That tells me all I need to know.
This logic makes my head hurt. Voting for the Lib doesn't take it away from Trump unless you were going to vote for him in the first place. It definitely doesn't give the vote to Biden, it gives it to the Lib. It's the equivalent of not voting at all, except you make a statement.
Like his VP pick would be the deal breaker against Trump
Facebook removes troll farm posing as African-American support for Donald Trump  via
They definitely won't be making Trump products
He fights his/our evil enemies daily.  I pray all the time.  #GodWins  If Trump loses, it will be voter fraud but remember #GodWins.
Misdirection? You are calling a conspiracy in Trump's DOJ. This isn't 2017. He's flushed everyone he could out after the Mueller investigation which is when this one took place. So yes. You don't get taken seriously and get sarcasm.
Never Trump Republicans are a very small fraction, mostly made up of Bush 2 speech writers and neoliberal Reaganomics geeks, who are pretty much responsible for where the Republican Party ended up... Trump is a symptom of 50 years of Republican policies.
Are we finally ready yet to admit that Kanye West is a "baby Christian" like Dobson tried to sucker us about Trump years ago?  Multiple instances of taking the Lord's name in vain in this article.
Will Joe's VP  be debating Pence or Trump? Or, both?
If a giant meteor hit America and killed ninety % of the population, you'd blame the low employment numbers on Trump.
Beds to Trump?  TVA how about decided to do the right thing!!
Trump humiliated his religious followers, especially Catholics, by insinuating they are stupid enough to think that Biden will hurt God. 🤦🏼‍♀️ Repugs put the final nail in their coffin by rushing to get Kanye on the ballot, implying black folks would vote for him cos he’s black.
Is four years of dementia worth taking Trump out of office? Funny. The answer is Yes. It is what it is. BTW Is Trump’s dementia somehow better?
Thank you Pastor Trump a man of the...... whatever. He is Gods protector you know.
This was the Hitler election program in 29/30. All Trump needs is to lose 900 pounds grow some hair and grow a little bit of hair under his nose. Then maybe learn how to read but that’s not a disqualifier.
I am jumping in here to point out that she describes herself as a staunch conservative in one paragraph and a moderate late in the piece.  Am I missing something here?  Real question: Do staunch conservatives count as moderates now that Trump is in office?
Biden and trump are fuckin idiots.
TRUMP wants everything to appear normal  I DON'T think it will EVER be normal like before the pandemic
These broadcast 'debates' have nothing to do with who knows more or makes a better case. Look at how Clinton 'schooled' Trump, yet Trump supporters and Fox said just the opposite. Anyone who has encountered a Trump supporter on Twitter knows they don't care about logic.
I wouldn't give a damn
How exactly is it racist?
I'm enjoying the latest mainstream media slobbering over Best-Selling Republican Consultant's Biography: Turns Out I Was a Piece of Shit This Whole Time  this is my favorite genre of book in the Trump era
Russians want to kill us. Trump is doing a great job.
Two Decades of Pandemic War Games Failed to Account for Donald Trump  via  Covid-19 wildfires are spreading in the U.S. because of the lack of leadership and bold action from the guy in this picture.  He's put all school aged kids in harms way.

If you can’t realize by now he is not all there in the head......just wait until he steps on stage with Trump.....
Why do you take China's side,  How about the first shots of a new Cold War being the CCP sending a deadly virus to our country? When will you hold them accountable instead of blaming everything on President Trump?
Trump couldn’t find the Book of Psalms without help.
No. They DON'T. It's just a tactic  Because if Joe says no, they will say Biden is afraid to debate trump
Trump in a mask and Gym in a jacket!?
Facts -- so inconvenient...
I find it interesting that when NBA players talk politics they should “shut up and dribble,” but Trump talks sports and it’s.... *crickets.*
It’s more like how many chins does trump have?
(CNN) NBA star LeBron James says the league won't miss Donald Trump's viewership after the US President criticized players for kneeling during the national anthem.
LeBron James says NBA won't miss President Donald Trump as a viewer...wooohooo November is right around the corner....yeppers let’s vote the clown out of office...
Gaffes what do you call Trump’s instability to read or have a coherent thought.
The NRA is not a gun lobby as much as power broker for the GOP. (Fact: Trump received $30 million for his campaign from them.) No one wants to take away guns. Most gun owners are responsible and we'll protect their 2nd amendment rights. Common sense gun laws!
No, this is NOT proof of Trump's supposed racism. You appear to be a bot account anyways, so you need to move on! INSTABLOCK!!
Vote Trump, get a vaccine??? Is this his new marketing idea??? Do people actually fall for this???????

Michelle Obama Blames Her 'Low-Grade Depression' In Part On Donald Trump  The former first lady said on her new podcast that she's struggling with the "day in and day out" hypocrisy of Trump's administration....yeppers, mine started on November 6, 2016
I'm sure our preference for individualism over collectivism and the failings of the Trump administration were primary factors, but what's never mentioned is the impact of our insanely polarized national politics.
That looks like exhaustion from the lies of trump and this God awful administration. Looks like most of us these days
My mom is 84 and a staunch Trump supporter. She does NOT want any vaccines!
Do you watch the news, or just mis-report it? Nearly every Republican who turned down Trump's support in 2018 lost their elections. Nearly all that accepted it won. You are either a blatant liar or you have your head so far up your ass you can lick where your heart should be.
Why would Trump name either of them AG?
They're one of the biggest donors, not to mention the "go-between" for Russian sponsors for Trump
How about forever. Trump was a fan of Herman Cain and it would be an honor for postus to implement the simple tax plan Cain suggests in his policy. And name it after Herman in his honor. Wow, the left would incinerate.
You’re triggered because Trump is leaving Biden in the dust.
FYI, Mr. President, this is going to upset a lot of your supporters! #NoMasks
It's not Trump's viewership he needs to worry about. It's the millions of freedom loving Americans who don't support their disrespect of the country that allows them to be millionaire athletes.
You need to be squawking about YOUR inaction, Trump’s, and the entire GOP. Bills on your desk, 150k + dead/ millions infected because of ZERO leadership under Trump, and your comrades have done nothing regarding healthcare. GOP: The Party of Inaction and Destruction. 🖕
I would look right at him and say “how the hell are you a Dr and you don’t believe in science? I’m sorry but I need to change Dr’s immediately. I need a REAL Dr, not one that obviously believes what Trump and his Dr do with Demon Sperm and Alien DNA. You can leave now.”
I don’t understand the announcement. Major grandstanding move. She has to know the expectations given the fact that Deutsche Bank gave up Trump’s records last year.
Paulding County is Trump country.  Not one bit surprised.
This is the same woman who was in jail for conspiracy and got pardoned by Trump. She’s literally a Trumpian republican running in the blackest district in GA.
I’m not a Trump fan. He’s an idiot. Not as big as an idiot as Biden, but an idiot. How does mask data not mean anything? If masks are the key to other countries success, and we wear them more, how does that work?
With any interview, Trump looks unhinged and losing touch with reality. He acts like a bratty teenager who can't go out on Friday night.
Trump said it was a bomb.
Are you Trump's son?
For a large, rotund individual, Donald Trump is incredibly small.
The acting State Department watchdog Stephen Akard has resigned after serving in the role for less than 3 months following the firing of the previous inspector general by President Donald Trump at the recommendation of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

You see now how one person can influence social behavior- trump deputy dawg junior in the flesh.
As happened in Israel when schools were opened during an uptick in cases it ended in tears. All those parental smiles will become sad faces as the Trump experiment fails again.
This is on Trump’s watch. Stop projecting this on to Dems. You and your other Trump supplicants own it. This is not 1968. The play book is reversed.
As a voter, I would love to see a presidential debate.    Biden vs Trump!   Who says we can’t enjoy the process to it fullest!  As a populous, are we not worthy of seeing our potential leader’s dialect and exchange? #timetodebate
#DonsNextCon This one makes me sick. Trump took builders seat on stage pretending that he donated big money for building for children with AIDS.

You lie almost as much as Trump does. I think I agree with Taylor Swift. You’re Trump in a wig. When he’s gone in January, however will you find another butt to embarrassingly plant those wrinkle lined lips?
It is his campaign account, Team Trump, not his personal account.
And the fact that Trump tweeted from his account less than 30 min ago.
It is his campaign account, Team Trump, that has been suspended, not his personal one.
It is his campaign account, Team Trump, that is suspended, not his personal one.

Not sure whether it's the moronic interpretations of the First Amendment, the Jwitter infighting, the antisemitic conspiracy theories or Donald Trump (which is to say, all of the above and more), but Twitter has broken me. I'll be back, but it won't be this week.
I come from a very pro trump republican household and it kills me because I know they have no idea what a united globalized society looks like and they never will.  They like Trump because he's a white business man so anything and everything he does is ok.
Glad to hear that you’re voting for country over party. If Dems ever put up a candidate as bad as Trump, I will do the same. I’m in GA. I feel your pain. We’re not doing any better than FL with  failed leadership here.

While the man was an habitual offender, this sentence was disproportionate and excessive. Poverty is certainly the root of this man wrongdoings, and needs to be considered. If Michael Flynn’s sentence can be commuted certainly this mans can too, but he’s not friends with Trump.
RUSH: All he did was run for president, get elected, he said he wanted to make America great again. Why is that controversial? You've gotta understand who these people are.
ACLU has filed nearly 400 cases against Trump: 'See you in court'
Their only job is covering up for Biden. They are already making excuses for him not debating President Trump. You are the fighter we need in Congress. Time to get rid of the Democrats and RINOs.
Well Joe told me if I vote for President Trump #YouAintBlack . Biden is one of the most racist person running for office. He just can’t hide it anymore
The positive test came hours before he was supposed to greet President Donald Trump in Cleveland.

The GOP needs to grow some balls like President Trump. Most of them hide under their desks instead of fighting back because they are afraid to be called a racist by the fake news. Only a few fight back. Hopefully the new batch running for office can fight back along with Trump.

Working at the news station has ONE big perk. I get to see transcripts of Trump talking. The way this man uses words is ATROCIOUS.

JT loves the smell of tRump's ass. Pass it on
... exercise that power. I’m sure a lot of people were totally fine handing over power to the Obama administration, but failed to consider that it would be giving Trump that same power. How about we give all that power to state and local governments instead?
Exactly.  Your alternative is Trump - the anti-thesis of American leadership.  You should be leading the conservative choice for Biden - so we can get back to normal debates about tax policy and deregulation not how many Americans should die per day, kids in cages, etc.
The dividing line in 2020 will be between those think that only  can save America and those think that America needs to be saved FROM Donald Trump.  #2020Election

Senator Kennedy has sold his soul to Trump. Being from LA with all the New Orleans voodoo and seers, you would think he would know better. Those who have bet on Trump, are taking a big gamble and might just be looking for a day job after he’s gone.

Until covid...Trump had increased EVERY economic indicator...lowest EVER black and Hispanic unemployment, stocks at highest levels...you may be on the hate Trump bandwagon, but you CANNOT argue the success he has had as president.
Oh... he pulled the “angry black person“ card 🙄😂😂🤣🤣...pack yo sh*t Trump. 😘
A process of evolution...we saw it play out in the fight to keep slavery...saw it during civil rights movement...women’s suffrage...now it’s BLM. Trump and his “crew“ are just following the playbook and the rest of us are “sick and tired of being sick and tired“ 😘.

If voting for Pence at the top of the ticket was an option, I would. As VP to Trump, I’m not interested.
I’m going to like Biden’s veep choice less than I like Pence, but the problem with the Trump-Pence ticket is not Pence. Likewise, people aren’t going to be voting for Biden because of who his VP will be. At best, the VP will reassure some voters.
I'm NOT voting for you. If you had developed a spine and looked out for the people of Georgia, instead of Trump, I would have voted for you. Im a Republican, but I'm voting against you.

Lol last time I checked they lied and the vote for impeachment was won just cause the majority was red bud. They have PLENTY to indict him. Corrupt system won’t allow it.

Here's my deal: In my state, my vote doesn't really matter. Trump is almost certain to win my state. If Election Night is so bad that he doesn't, then he's already lost the Electoral College by losing the swing states.

Mr Trump. You did good when you finally banned travelers from China. Did you know that 38 other countries banned China before you did?
It’s infuriating. The Trump crime family violates it for the millionth time yet no consequences. Just another day from a racist, narcissistic, pathological lying, mentally unstable sociopath. For God sakes, let there be justice served when this criminal is out of office.
Mr Trump: “We didn’t even have a rapid test before I got it”. Mr Trump. We didn’t NEED any kind of Covid test until 2020. People notice your mistakes especially when you are trying to blame something on someone else. Who has Dementia?

Trump supporters tell it's a vote for Biden.
Your ability to support Trump while also feeling like you’re quoting Orwell unironically is a breathtaking feat of mental gymnastics
Actually, what you’re saying is partly what I meant in my original tweet. Our security depends upon adherence to the Constitution and the rule of law, faith in government and institutions, and national unity. Trump has undermined all of these.
Trump himself 😂
Not quite he said popular vote would go to trump in 2016, which is just wrong.
Thank god  finally got some sense in them And started tying candidates to trump instead of doing the centrist bullshit that got them annihilated before.

Trump ACTIONS have “neutered” the CDC...left it highly ineffective when it comes to inspiring calm and reducing anxiety...destroying the public trust in the agency...it’s guidelines...it’s statistics. “If this is Trump approved...is it TRUTHFUL.” Thank God for Dr. Fauci.
Good morning Twitter family. Hope everyone is having a great day so far. Getting ready to do my cardio and then hit up the gym. We have 90 days remaining to vote out all of these Democrat clowns out of office. I know I will be voting for President Trump and all Republicans.

Don't need to. He got Trump talking just let Trump be Trump.

156,041 American citizen died from covid-19 and Trump said, it is what it is, during the Ebola crisis two people, only but two people died under President Obama's watch and they were screaming hollering for his resignation as president
I don't understand this take; if Trump really can handle the media the way it's claimed why hide? Plus one of the biggest criticisms of Obama was only speaking to outlets that would lob him softballs; why repeat that behavior?

Mr Trump: “When I took over, we didn’t even have a test”. Duh. When Mr Trump took over, we didn’t have a virus to test for.He didn’t stumble his words,and anyone can make a mistake, but so anxious to blame Obama, he forgot that C19 came in 2019, not 2015.
I was wondering how far I’d have to scroll to find the sick burn that is “tRump” but they instead opt for “tDump”. Genius commentary.
really wish people who support ice and trump would watch this and reevaluate their decisions.
I’m pretty sure there’s some thinking in the Trump camp that if they’re wasting millions on a lost cause, perhaps they’d be better off figuring out a way to keep the money...
It would take years and unfettered access to Trump Organizations records to unravel the financial backing thru layers of Russian money laundering companies to really expose the level of funds he’s gotten thru all his properties. MAYBE Vance will succeed but I doubt it.

Nothing like a Joe Biden voter rally to heat up the conversation, burn buildings &amp; Bibles and injure law enforcement. I guess Joe's voters have a lot of burning hot issues.  Poor old Trump only has peaceful folks acting civil and supporting law enforcement.

Dr. Birx looked so uncomfortable when Trump was spitballing using disenfectant and uv light to self treat Coronavirus. Watch the reaction during this video. She looks is praying for this to end or for someone to port her from the press room.

Hey people answer me this. We all know through legal court documents that show for a fact that the Obama administration spied on trump and falsified documents to try to impeach him. So you think the democrats are our friends and savior.
Watch your mouth. That's tRump you're talking about
I think Trump banning Tiktot is just his political battle with China. He need to be focusing more on battling this pandemic instead of worrying about app that will not be banned in the USA anytime soon.

Between Trump, Barr and the Trump base, our justice system has been trashed beyond belief. Truth, justice and pride must be restored in these agencies we so depend on.
I beg to differ; Real Republicans are not Trumplican’s. Trump IS THE GOP RIGHT NOW. He’s destroyed the brand . It needs to start over. The entire GOP is nothing more than a collection of enablers. The brand “Republican” will NEVER be trusted again. It’s no different from KKK now
I’m not sure that narrative is correct. It always looked more to me like moderates and independents broke for Obama after the post-Sandy Obama-Christie love in.  I’m pretty sure Romney got a larger percentage of the vote than Trump.

Not to mention that it is illegal, a word omitted from the Trump dictionary.
trump wanna ban tiktok but dont want to shutup the us down so we can get back to out normal lives. BITCH I WANNA GO TO WALMART AFTER 8!
Stephen Miller making comments about Obama’s speaking at John Lewis’s funeral is about as delusional as Trump thinking COVID-19 could be over by Easter.  Neither has any basis in reality.
Trump wants to win at all costs. He thinks that by keeping blacks out of the suburbs it's going to help him with white voters.
I've been to the  it's full of pro trump stuff.  All of the trumpets MUST go thete!
This is a accurate as saying tRump's pigmentation is natural🤣🤣🤣🤣 #VoteRedToKillAmerica #VoteRedToKillDemocracy
They chose to let people die without help.    I won’t forget this. Isn’t it a crime for Trump to just fail to give aid to his citizens?
So Republicans think we don’t want to work. We need the threat of homelessness and starvation to get out of bed. Oh, and Trump says we’re stupid.

Why do Trump supporters look better?
Trump is a Dr Luke fan.

Respect vs. pure evil...Trump supporters are real, genuinely welcoming people...demoncrats...well...

Lord I pray trump wins. Joe biden does not look right to me.
Yes-I was wondering how many abuse survivors Trump is triggering with his behavior.

Everytime I talk to my dads mom she got to talk to me about trump and shit 🤦🏾‍♂️
I love this...that is hilarious 😂❤️
Didn't know tRump was into SciFi
Every time Trump opens his mouth to speak this is my look!!! He is so damn.......🙄🙄🙄
Amen; I completely trust his judgement. He understands it truly is one heartbeat away. Their are real serious armed Trumpsters that are as close to an TRUMP JIHADI ARMY ; white Nazi supremacy groups. Trump will keep them agitated when he loses. He’s been that one heartbeat away.
If trump were a TV series, which one would he be?
Trump won just like that
Police have released few details about the killing, including any motive.
Oh, no! Your article is behind a paywall. 😢 I guess I’ll just have to go on believing Trump has no business being president. 🤷🏼‍♀️
ALL DAT M💰NEY YALL GOT FROM TRUMP 🍊 &amp; YALL GAVE IT TO DA STR💃🏽PPERS 🤦🏾‍♂️😭😂🤣 #SRTMediaTv
I don’t believe that, and besides... Trump doesn’t care, that’s what makes him great
President Donald Trump said he will take action as soon as today to ban popular social media app TikTok in the U.S.

Those are highly addictive bud. You’ll be as Orange as Trump you keep that up. Mask up, Man up
Good morning patriots. Hope everyone is having a great day and weekend. It’s truly a blessing waking up and knowing Trump is our President. He is the only one standing in the way of socialism in America. I am fired up, excited, and motivated to vote for our amazing President
I have seen a good number of Trump signs and bumper stickers this year. I have seen 0 Biden anything. I feel there is no fire in the Biden campaign. I guess it’s basically an Anti-Trump vote in November. Sad for Democrats that they can’t nominate a person to rally behind.
Only situations the left doesn't like, like churches and Trump rallies
Reminder that you can’t vote for Trump and be an LGBTQ+ ally
Trump appointed him to screw up the mail in hopes American voters would reject mail-in voting.  I can hardly walk, but just like every military who risk their life daily, I will risk the virus to cast my ballot. Voter turnout will be largest in history.
You don’t oppose farmers monthly assistance indefinitely, (plus $1200 per person stimulus) but you and your cronies only want to extend $600 unemployment benefits for 300 million unemployed Americans for ONE WEEK. That is so Trump! 1/20/21!
I think that’s correct. Trump doesn’t want a dog because dogs do not like him.
Is this about national security or successful Trump satirists like ⁦⁦⁦
I'm praying that these other delivery services will actually come through.  Jeff Bezos could really stick it to trump by using Amazon services
He can’t properly determine his chances of getting re-elected b/c there was another TikTok scam of kids getting free flights on the dime of Trump Supporters 😂
imagine thinking you finna get sponsorships from tik tok  and then trump say he finna ban it . I know they’re mad 😂🤦🏾‍♀️
I found my local ballot drop box in front of our Citizen’s Center and will take my absentee ballot there. Please everyone, stay safe. Absentee and use ballot drop box-usually out when early voting starts. We can fight Trump and Covid-19 at the same time.
More than ever, we must Unite Behind Biden’s Choice-whoever it is. NO Division internally to allow Trump and his trumplets room to knock us down. #StandTogether #GoodTrouble
RIGHT BC ALL LIVE MATTER BUT MOST IS KILL TRUMP LMAO!!!
It’s crazy how deeply people in other countries have invested themselves in the COVID hoax just to get rid of Trump. 🙃 Sweet video 💜
Yeah, good luck with that.    President Trump says he plans to ban TikTok from the US
Wtf type of bullshit is this ⁉️⁉️ "President Trump says he plans to ban TikTok from the US"
All of Trump’s trumplets are insane if they think we will forget who they are #VoteTrumpletsOut
"Exception"? Who's the #FuckingMoron running this tweeter? Did tRump himself got another account? Stick to person, woman, man, camera, TV... that's the English you've got
Just the fact the get along with it should force them to step down if trump get elected again. They are clowns.
Man trump is banning Tiktok. Fuck this. I’m going to Canada
-pandemic killing hundreds of thousands going on -police literally kidnapping people -schools planning to reopen which will harm millions of people -literally so much other important shit  Trump; fuck Tik Tok, they hurt my feelings
Us unemployed need your help Mr. PRESIDENT. Please help us. We know that you can do it. Trump 2020
To be clear, Trump has continued the drone program and has dropped what limited ethical restraints Obama had.
Ok so what do you do with an AG that backs up his powers if he say “declares state of emergency and martial law “? Don’t laugh. Trump knows he’s going to face serious state charges in NY. He’s going to get increasingly desperate
Because tRump's ass isn't going to wipe itself
Ah, yes. Just like how the Republicans treated Hillary Clinton during the Benghazi hearings.  When will trump be grilled about the 4 soldiers that were killed in Niger? Or the fact that he knew putin is paying the Taliban to kill American soldiers?
We all know the truth. trump calls it fake news, but that's the furthest thing from it.
That’s awesome news. President Trump should add a extra feet taller to the wall each time they try to stop him. We need to start speeding up deportations next.
Never ever tell me that trump loves our military.  Supreme Court sides with Trump on building border wall with diverted military funds  #SmartNews

RUSH: Trump&amp;#039;s job approval has jumped a net five points overnight, and he&amp;#039;s now at 50% approval, 48% disapproval. This is his best day on Rasmussen since February.
Mr Trump. Is your dog always faster than Obama’s dog?  That’s the first time in my life that I ever heard someone criticize a eulogy.
Kushner is perhaps even worse than Trump himself
It will eventually all come out. The level of graft of taxpayers as well as various “campaign funds” $$ is going to be breathtaking. Trump is lining his pockets from any and all Available as fast as he can. Gonna have some HUGE legal fees.
Mr Trump. Take a dozen eggs, and u need to know if any are bad.  Chances are, the more eggs you crack, you may find eggs that are good, you may find bad, or none good or none bad. But if you don’t crack the eggs, how will you know?
Ohio. Please don’t re-elect Jim Jordan again. His only function is an activist/agitator, not a Congressman. I have watched his behavior in several committee hearings lately, and he shows his connection, defense, and loyalty to Trump, more than ppl of Ohio.

A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for Donald Trump
A vote for joe biden is a vote for Donald trump. This statement holds more weight than yours because there’s some truth behind it since they’re both statist assholes.
Ah did some searching and yes he was retweeted.  However- he didn't have the Austin pin on his profile until the day AFTER he was retweeted by Trump- it wasn't there when Trump retweeted.  Next.
Federal LEOs are leaving Portland but the city is still violent.   Precisely what was accomplished here other than deepening partisan divisions and convincing more people that Trump wants a police state?  Maybe providing footage for Trump campaign ads?
Trump has also retweeted many of the Patriots Austin calls "QPharisees" and Q has also linked them many times in his drops in a positive light, even calling them Patriots and acknowledging them as valuable members to the movement.  As for that retweet, kindly share?
. is an even bigger tRump jockstrap than #GymJordan
Take that in context. Read fully and note the date. Compare and contrast with Trump tweets in that timeframe.  🤷‍♂️
I advertise that I am voting for President Trump. I don’t leave home without my MAGA or KAG hat
I cannot wait till he gets his ass fried for spying on Trump. He and biden had their hands in the illegal coup.
Believe Mr Stevens. Trump’s army of lawyers are going to cause chaos all over in certain voting districts in battleground states.
Thank you sir. Trump will pull stunts in key voting districts in states he’s losing to try and invalidate that district votes. Claiming they’re “compromised”. Watch as Republicans will enable these shams.
Hubuk has to wear the hijab, as for Trump'
You helped create a pernicious system of social control of the vulnerable called “mass incarceration.” It is not only Trump cronies who are unworthy of praising Lewis.
For real, I think is it a slow slide from covering for Trump until you are so deep your existence depends on Trump being correct so you no longer question. Am I wrong?
I’m not sure about devotion as much as desperate. During impeachment trial he had desperate panicked fear oozing out of every pore.  Poor guy shouldn’t have done anything worth extorting, cause that’s Trump’s game.
Never mind your massive antifa maskless protests. DeBlasio and  cuomo; the worst representatives in history. TRUMP 2020 you fools!!
Trump is the worst president for all country has ever encountered he’s a liar he’s a bigot why are the Republicans in the Senate continuously falling in love with this man
Good effort Chris-I would honestly like to know if he believes all that or just covering for Trump.
That’s good to know. Many of us hang our heads in shame over how Trump has “conducted business.” Ok everyone, it is July 30th, what #GoodTrouble can we get into?
Biden has been a politician for how many years? But all the United States problems are because of Trump now? It’s ridiculous. He was in a lose-lose with the Coronavirus. And please tell me you think Biden is of the right mind to be president? Can the Democrats not find better?
And they sensor all of us that dare to be Trump supporters!
“ Donald Trump is an existential threat to our republic.”  It is true, but I didn’t think this could happen. It is.
So showing footage of Trump's America and labeling it as Biden's America isn't working?? 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ Idiots.
You know tRump is still alive, right?
300 out of 1933, that's a whooping 15%. How would anyone be able to cross with so little left open🤣🤣🤣 I'm just glad tRump made México party for that 15% and he'll make them pay for the rest too  #FuckYourWall #WeWillVote  #VoteRedToKillAmerica #VoteRedToKillDemocracy
Probably not.  I’m starting to think this is all a hoax like Russia gate!!  I believe there is a Coronavirus but I also believe there is a flu every year.  I have a feeling after the election and Donald Trump is re-elected the media will turn its corrupt sights on something else!
All the MSM called Trump a lier about spying but looks like he was right so Twitter needs to let people say what they want. It’s should not up to them to fact check anyone.
Herman Cain died of complications from Covid. The news media want you to believe that he contracted the disease at the Trump Tulsa rally, however, it is UNKNOWN where he contracted it...the MSM are so dishonest...
Yes! I found this info a year or so ago because it bothered me that I couldn’t wrap my head around why and how people now to Trump. Thing that it hardest for me is how anyone speaks against the leader, and they are “re-educated.”
Rape is not okay, at all.  There's 0 to suggest Trump is guilty in any of those (quickly dismissed) accusations.  May be hard to accept but, it is possible for women to lie about sexual acts to push the narrative of "Orange man bad".
... Big pharmaceutical dismissal and banning of a proven COVID preventative and treatment simply because Trump endorsed it, Twitter and FB censorship/banning of conservative and Q accounts, the documented coup discussions between FBI officials- off the top of my head.
More evidence that  is out of his depth and unfit for his office.  via
Steele Dossier, Biased Left media slander continously even after being proven wrong time and time again, pushed Ukraine collusion hoax, Russian collusion hoax, FBI and CIA cooperation in spying on Trump's presidential campaign which was ordered by Obama and his officials...
Friends? Epstein was banned from Trumo properties and Trump was then the only person to help the FBI make a case against Epstein.  Also, he suggested to Barr to reopen the Epstein investigation...
I was ok with him till he voted against Kavanaugh.  You and I both know that miss Ford was full of crap.  The voted to impeach Trump.  If you like trump or hate trump he shouldn’t have been impeached for some made up BS.
I’m still not a fan, but he does look better in light of Trump. I think Obama’s shenanigans broke the GOP and drove it crazy.   Plus, a lot of Trump’s ideas came from Obama. He’s responsible for at least some of this mess.
I am voting for President Trump. According to Biden, I ain’t black
I suppose so. And maybe just a bit better. I still don’t like having to vote for joe, but he’s leagues better than trump.
Maybe Adam Schiff’s twin? 🤷🏼‍♀️
RUSH: I'm not sharing this with you to frustrate you, folks. I think that the point here is once again the Democrats are not confident that they're gonna win this.
So you think that just because trump did 1 thing, he handled this properly?
If trump dies, then pence runs. That’s how it’s always worked. Do you not know this?
Yeah, but from where I’m standing, I don’t really see that happening. There’s a difference in pointing out joe’s flaws, and attacking him and putting up there with trump. I don’t think they’re being equated, and if they are, it’s on the sexual assaulter level.
I feel like “attacking Biden” is a stretch. If you’re a white leftist, odds are you’re not suprised by this stuff from trump and you gave up hope a year or two ago on him. Just gotta get him out.
That’s awesome!!! 🤔 hmmmm who’s up next? Barr? The trump thing/it?I’m sure you find this racist, or sone how a white supremacist move
He is a bigger idiot than Trump, and you guys are going to vote for him
Not more nervous than this guy! My wife is black and she is way more scared of this idiot than Trump....
If joe picks Bass, will she go up against Pence, or Trump in the debates? Or, both?
Thread by  You all know why Trump has now left the White House - being seen off by the entire WH staff before he traveled to Oe he won't be back for awhile - to go to his resort in Bedminster, NJ, right? Everybody focuses on SPYGATE SPYGAT…
Within 10 days IF BIDEN WINS if Trump wins gloom &amp; doom, blaming Trump, demands for Congressional hearings, calls for appt of Special Prosecutor will begin
Here u go again. Intelligence cld not agree abt bounty according to multiple reports. How do u know Trump hasn’t discussed it but prefers not to comment?
I have a feeling the NRA won’t be the only organization not survive the Trump occupation. I believe Trump has done what Bush didn’t... finally put the last nail in the coffin for what was known as the Republican Party.
After I saw Trump blast the press, it just got a whole lot better.
And yes relax, I’m not abandoning Trump over the insurance thing, but it is a valid question if you call yourself Right Wing and a free market capitalist. His EO will make my liberal Leftwing family members very happy 🤷‍♂️
And that’s fine, Trump never progressed to be a conservative...he’s a pragmatist...just saying though...in this day in era of encroaching socialism...that still inches us closer to it 🤷‍♂️
Trust in President Trump. I was watching a video and it was said that the people who are against the rioting have not started retaliating because we are the better people and we are letting them exterminate themselves. We need to continue to be patient it will all be over soon.
One of Trump’s Antichrist friends!
EO to announce that Trump is now in favor of #Obamacare
You’re right and I’m not disagreeing with any of that. In the NFL, that old school mentality you mentioned is alive and well. Those owners don’t care about the pandemic. It’s all business to them. Remember they’re mostly Trump supporters.
While  and  are fighting for extended unemployment benefits for the millions who are still out of work, Trump is in Bedminster, entering a room full of rich white guys, yuckin it up, as Hail To The Chief plays. #LetThemEatCovid
DaWhites wanna own the libs so badly they’re willing to risk their lives and their kids’ lives just to see Trump. That shit is crazy as hell!
Also, russia messed the the polls last time and are continuing to do so because trump is fine with them helping him again. It’s sadly, the only way he can “win.” #RepublicansCheat
Kemp went all in for Trump, and now he can't admit he was wrong, even if it means thousands more GA citizens dying.
A place where Trump's base would never be allowed to enter
He said it both ways. So even Trump seems to recognize his error.
Blame!! Trump!!🤬
China and Iran and the UK and Australia and Canada and most of the world know Trump is a loose cannon who can’t be trusted. Of course they’re all ready to get rid of him. That doesn’t mean they’re interfering in our elections like Russia is.
#LeningradLindsey is telling Trump to stand firm against putting $600 per week in the hands of hard working Americans, to stand firm against money to states to fight #COVID19 and to stand firm against funding schools to keep our kids safe.  stands firm for families.
Just imagine if this was Trump.  24/7 wall to wall hysteria from the media.  Nothing Biden says or does even gets a notice.  Pathetic bias.  #UsVsThem
Trump’s EO about tiktok
U confused Obama &amp; Trump. O was do nothing who loved to brag while economy had worst recovery since Depression. Trump one who has something to brag abt, best economy, highest empl rate, record unem for, mfg return, record stock market, great until China decided to ruin world.
Glad to finally hear someone in the church saying this out loud.
Wow, some somewhat honest reporting from  Of course China wants Biden to win, they know he won't be as tough on them as Trump. Trump's trade deals will mean trillions of future dollars to the US. Just one more reason we must re-elect President Trump.
So the Democrats and Republicans are arguing about the second stimulus bill because Trump wants to really only give relief to schools that open up during a pandemic?! So he only wants to reward people and children for risking their lives?!! Am I hearing this right?
Herman Cain, the former Republican presidential candidate, businessman and close ally of President Donald Trump, was guided by his Christian faith in politics, business and his personal life, his pastor said at his funeral Friday.
Trump loves nothing better than these polls that paint him as the underdog. I wouldn't be surprised if he's not somehow responsible for their looney predictions!
Time to stop these talks before the Republicans cave. President Trump’s EO is exactly what we need (-) extra $600 unemp
Trump vaccine official: 'I would resign instantly' if pressured politically

Do you think all the libs that support legalization of weed are going to support her, after she prosecuted hundreds and then bragged about smoking it herself? Oh, and the clips of her attacking Biden at the dem debates are going to be great for the Trump ads. This for a start.
great thread.  At this point, do Trump supporters even read?
I think if Biden wins by voter fraud then there will be an all out civil war. I don't think Trump wants this to happen.
Dems are Party of Elites and tired of a two tiers justice system w lifetime polictian billionaires! Trump represents America and is fighting for our rights and freedoms. Biden &amp; Dems sold our country soul to China and laundered billions if not trillions thru Ukraine!
Nothing is as it seems &amp; that is certainly true with this article.  Read the headline, then read the article, then tell me if you think there is 1 chance in a million that Biden wins.  One BIG elephant in the room not mentioned - Biden's cognitive issues.
He isn’t doing this because he cares, he’s not doing it because he wants to be president, he’s not doing this because he’s a good guy, because we all know he isn’t. He’s doing this because his BFF has shitty numbers and HES trying to keep Trump as president. Kanye is a POS
Trump has done nothing for the black community and how would you even know? Are you black? No? There's a seat over there then
I'm very aware of who both are. There aren't any 'non-racist' options. That's been my entire life story. But I'm married to a dreamer and Trump wants to make it harder for people like my wife to stay here; so why would I vote for his particular racism? A real answer...
God must be pained as he watches trump assault humanity.
“If you are have trouble deciding whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black.” -Joe Biden
Ugh. You’re going to fuck this all up. I just feel it. And you have a complete lightweight in  leading this. We’re going to end up with four more years of Trump if you don’t get your shit together and learn how to be a street fighter. AND replace
It’s rather disappointing that he ended like this. Because I discovered him through his Fairly Oddparents reviews and thought he was a funny guy. Ever since that Trump rant, he’s been on a downward spiral.
No, he didn't.   And if he hadn't ignored it and called it a hoax back him January, and hadn't fired the pandemic response team, this wouldn't have gotten this bad.  This is Trump fault. This is his plague.
Not 1 single trump supporter is thinking about voting for Kanye, he is only doing this to take votes from Biden. Kanye has absolutely no chance of winning!
United States v. Fred Trump and Donald Trump. Violates Fair Housing Act by effectively banning minority residents. “Nice try”

Fired??? He’ll be eating hamberders in Bedminster NJ with Trump on Saturday.
Wow,  everyday Trump gets more desperate!
I’m old and married, but the Trump question would have been asked prior to the first date.
This hurting God deal is another key point in the Shit Show we call the Trump campaign. I killed over 160K Americans. Biden will hurt God.
Yes this is a winner for Trump. A sign of pure genius. It’s likely to be a major debate question. Vote for me I banned Tik Tok.
Trump campaign team is pitiful for this.
This gaff doesn’t hurt you with me. I’d vote for a goat in a dress before I’d vote for trump.
Trump's not at fault. The more b's you guys post the more it becomes obvious what's really going on. So keep the propaganda coming. Your putting kids and women on the front line of protest. Cowards
Funny you accept Trump’s lies
My wife's from there. It's fitting
Humility? Seriously. The guy can't define humility. A president that requires a teleprompter and strings to function is just that. A puppet
Well now. Trump decided to ban companies from doing business with Chinese companies like Tencent. I am pretty sure he doesn't know nor care but he may have caused a huge crash in the gaming/tech industry in the USA because of it. Tencent owns a very large portion of the gaming
I don't know. Because nothing good can happen, probably not. The only silver lining in this election cycle would be the two brain addled, racist ramblings of Biden v Trump. We probably won't even get that.
“Trump bans LoL”   Future headlines write themselves
I think the more these are worn that it will fix itself. They had these and any masks that are President Trump related.
We never should have allowed anything to be shut down.  I never saw anything like this under any virus under the previous administration.  That tells me all I need to know.
As I recall Dr Fauci said masks not effective for months, now all n. He advises Trump. The  mobile hospitals + Navy Hosp ships were fanfare not requested? Getting Ford Motors to produce ventilators no good? Expediting processes thru FDA not good? China travel ban excellent

He fights his/our evil enemies daily.  I pray all the time.  #GodWins  If Trump loses, it will be voter fraud but remember #GodWins.
Misdirection? You are calling a conspiracy in Trump's DOJ. This isn't 2017. He's flushed everyone he could out after the Mueller investigation which is when this one took place. So yes. You don't get taken seriously and get sarcasm.
Never Trump Republicans are a very small fraction, mostly made up of Bush 2 speech writers and neoliberal Reaganomics geeks, who are pretty much responsible for where the Republican Party ended up... Trump is a symptom of 50 years of Republican policies.
Will Joe's VP  be debating Pence or Trump? Or, both?
If a giant meteor hit America and killed ninety % of the population, you'd blame the low employment numbers on Trump.
Beds to Trump?  TVA how about decided to do the right thing!!
Trump humiliated his religious followers, especially Catholics, by insinuating they are stupid enough to think that Biden will hurt God. 🤦🏼‍♀️ Repugs put the final nail in their coffin by rushing to get Kanye on the ballot, implying black folks would vote for him cos he’s black.
Is four years of dementia worth taking Trump out of office? Funny. The answer is Yes. It is what it is. BTW Is Trump’s dementia somehow better?
Thank you Pastor Trump a man of the...... whatever. He is Gods protector you know.
This was the Hitler election program in 29/30. All Trump needs is to lose 900 pounds grow some hair and grow a little bit of hair under his nose. Then maybe learn how to read but that’s not a disqualifier.
I am jumping in here to point out that she describes herself as a staunch conservative in one paragraph and a moderate late in the piece.  Am I missing something here?  Real question: Do staunch conservatives count as moderates now that Trump is in office?
Biden and trump are fuckin idiots.
I'm enjoying the latest mainstream media slobbering over Best-Selling Republican Consultant's Biography: Turns Out I Was a Piece of Shit This Whole Time  this is my favorite genre of book in the Trump era
Russians want to kill us. Trump is doing a great job.
Two Decades of Pandemic War Games Failed to Account for Donald Trump  via  Covid-19 wildfires are spreading in the U.S. because of the lack of leadership and bold action from the guy in this picture.  He's put all school aged kids in harms way.
Taking advantage of Trump’s former nude modeling wife is more like it.
Why do you take China's side,  How about the first shots of a new Cold War being the CCP sending a deadly virus to our country? When will you hold them accountable instead of blaming everything on President Trump?
Trump couldn’t find the Book of Psalms without help.
Trump in a mask and Gym in a jacket!?
Facts -- so inconvenient...
I find it interesting that when NBA players talk politics they should “shut up and dribble,” but Trump talks sports and it’s.... *crickets.*
It’s more like how many chins does trump have?
Gaffes what do you call Trump’s instability to read or have a coherent thought.
The NRA is not a gun lobby as much as power broker for the GOP. (Fact: Trump received $30 million for his campaign from them.) No one wants to take away guns. Most gun owners are responsible and we'll protect their 2nd amendment rights. Common sense gun laws!
No, this is NOT proof of Trump's supposed racism. You appear to be a bot account anyways, so you need to move on! INSTABLOCK!!
Trump is way sicker
Big difference - Trump provides his own, no need to doctor anything up.
Sad that trump would sink to this level.....but not surprised.  We Americans can NOT trust this man.
Sad that trump has to sink to this level.....but not surprised he would.  We CANNOT trust this man or any of his minions.
Vote Trump, get a vaccine??? Is this his new marketing idea??? Do people actually fall for this???????
I ordered a Trump flag on Amazon and they changed the product listing picture to a giant dildo on the order status page. Anytime I got notifications I saw the picture of it. Someone is Seattle is having a laugh. 😂
I'm sure our preference for individualism over collectivism and the failings of the Trump administration were primary factors, but what's never mentioned is the impact of our insanely polarized national politics.
My mom is 84 and a staunch Trump supporter. She does NOT want any vaccines!
Do you watch the news, or just mis-report it? Nearly every Republican who turned down Trump's support in 2018 lost their elections. Nearly all that accepted it won. You are either a blatant liar or you have your head so far up your ass you can lick where your heart should be.
Why would Trump name either of them AG?
They're one of the biggest donors, not to mention the "go-between" for Russian sponsors for Trump
How about forever. Trump was a fan of Herman Cain and it would be an honor for postus to implement the simple tax plan Cain suggests in his policy. And name it after Herman in his honor. Wow, the left would incinerate.
You’re triggered because Trump is leaving Biden in the dust.
FYI, Mr. President, this is going to upset a lot of your supporters! #NoMasks
It's not Trump's viewership he needs to worry about. It's the millions of freedom loving Americans who don't support their disrespect of the country that allows them to be millionaire athletes.
You need to be squawking about YOUR inaction, Trump’s, and the entire GOP. Bills on your desk, 150k + dead/ millions infected because of ZERO leadership under Trump, and your comrades have done nothing regarding healthcare. GOP: The Party of Inaction and Destruction. 🖕
I would look right at him and say “how the hell are you a Dr and you don’t believe in science? I’m sorry but I need to change Dr’s immediately. I need a REAL Dr, not one that obviously believes what Trump and his Dr do with Demon Sperm and Alien DNA. You can leave now.”
I don’t understand the announcement. Major grandstanding move. She has to know the expectations given the fact that Deutsche Bank gave up Trump’s records last year.
Paulding County is Trump country.  Not one bit surprised.
This is the same woman who was in jail for conspiracy and got pardoned by Trump. She’s literally a Trumpian republican running in the blackest district in GA.
I’m not a Trump fan. He’s an idiot. Not as big as an idiot as Biden, but an idiot. How does mask data not mean anything? If masks are the key to other countries success, and we wear them more, how does that work?
With any interview, Trump looks unhinged and losing touch with reality. He acts like a bratty teenager who can't go out on Friday night.
Trump said it was a bomb.
Are you Trump's son?
For a large, rotund individual, Donald Trump is incredibly small.
You see now how one person can influence social behavior- trump deputy dawg junior in the flesh.
Hulu is racist and supports Trump. No one can tell me anything different lol
As happened in Israel when schools were opened during an uptick in cases it ended in tears. All those parental smiles will become sad faces as the Trump experiment fails again.
This is on Trump’s watch. Stop projecting this on to Dems. You and your other Trump supplicants own it. This is not 1968. The play book is reversed.
#DonsNextCon This one makes me sick. Trump took builders seat on stage pretending that he donated big money for building for children with AIDS.
This man Trump really said “it is what it is” over peoples lives🤦🏾‍♂️ so I made this😂 #TraitorTrump

I’ve been saying this for the longest, if Kanye West got on ballot in certain states he will split the vote that will work in Trump favor, he isn’t as stupid as folks thinks he is....and what’s crazy...some people will actually vote for him. 😞
You lie almost as much as Trump does. I think I agree with Taylor Swift. You’re Trump in a wig. When he’s gone in January, however will you find another butt to embarrassingly plant those wrinkle lined lips?
It is his campaign account, Team Trump, not his personal account.
And the fact that Trump tweeted from his account less than 30 min ago.
If you are in Wisconsin...and vote for Kanye West which is essentially a vote for trump...u r a fucking disgrace.
It is his campaign account, Team Trump, that has been suspended, not his personal one.

Please do not allow the Trump Administration to take advantage of you. I'm old enough to be your mom and this is absurd and blatantly taking you to the River. Be well.

At the last minute, President Donald Trump and his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, are searching for places to impressively yet safely accept their parties' presidential nominations as the spread of the coronavirus adds uncertainty to the campaigns.
got a video idea for you. Mash up Biden’s video with the corvette and trump in play drive the semi-truck
Not sure whether it's the moronic interpretations of the First Amendment, the Jwitter infighting, the antisemitic conspiracy theories or Donald Trump (which is to say, all of the above and more), but Twitter has broken me. I'll be back, but it won't be this week.
I come from a very pro trump republican household and it kills me because I know they have no idea what a united globalized society looks like and they never will.  They like Trump because he's a white business man so anything and everything he does is ok.
Glad to hear that you’re voting for country over party. If Dems ever put up a candidate as bad as Trump, I will do the same. I’m in GA. I feel your pain. We’re not doing any better than FL with  failed leadership here.
Yea he’s going to debate Trump...lol
I would love to see Jim Cramer n Trump tougher they have more energy than 1000 average people
Noticed how trump doesn’t go on these huge family vacations like Obama did Hawaii Africa Martha’s Vineyard coating millions of tax dollars while taking prez salary Trump does none of this but no mention in media about millions in saving taxpayers 💰
Hey! Don't Trump voters already have a mentally unstable candidate?
A) There’s no national testing program so the numbers you’re using mean jack shit since you have no idea what that sample size truly looks like B) Trump Administration calls it a pandemic. Take it up with him.
Another bonus of the Trump presidency 👍
When 2750 lbs of explosives go off  IT'S A BOMB!  If Trump would have called it "fireworks", Rachel would have called it a bomb.  Most "fireworks" don't have a visible blast radius when they go off.
You be referring to the Trump admin
If Trump would keep his pie hole shut this would end.
Well, Dopey, the Trump Administration’s  calls it a pandemic.
Bumbling trump may have the Republican nomination, but there is no way a nearly illiterate, self absorbed, crook of his magnitude will win enough votes to remain in office.
Let the BS games begin. How about no debates. What’s the point?  We all know what Trump will do. He doesn’t change and his brain will not grow.
Only in Trump’s America have there been death threats to a doctor and top virologist during a pandemic due to the politicization over wearing a face covering to prevent contagions from exiting an infected respiratory system. Pretty fucked up.
Death threats and harassment are acceptable in Trump’s America? What about LAW AND ORDER!
Trump supporters.
I just don’t get why Fauci is the enemy, not Trump.  So maddening
That’s one of the rare times I’ll post something with trump that I agree with. Parody or not. 😂😂😂
Why don’t Democrat’s interview real people from other countries?  I know for a fact that not only are we not respected, we are pitied and actually whole heartedly disrespected and equally disliked. It’s all because of trump and his R enablers.
I can't believe a word the Trump administration says, I wouldn't trust their data.
She must have a bigly brain like dr. Scientist bigly brain trump.
That's pretty hilarious of you to say considering Trump is VEHEMENTLY OPPOSED to mail-in voting. It's the Dems who want mail in voting so THEY can steal the election.   You can bet that every single patriot out there will be making it a point to vote in person if at all possible.
ATLANTA – U.S. Sen. David Perdue has answered a TV ad aired by Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff accusing President Donald Trump and – by association – Perdue of failing to respond to the coronavirus pandemic.
Truth! Thanks, mr. trump
And this isn’t the first time they have used images of Biden praying or in quiet contemplation to infer that he is sleepy or lacks stamina. It is SOP for the Trump team.
just falsely accused the 2016 Trump campaign of trying to hack into all 50 states electoral processes. What is this BS?
So, you're already excluding Susan Rice? And there is nothing corrupt about Trump. But I'll give you imperfect, like every other human who ever walked the Earth except one.
But Trump said that kids are immune to it...
Slowed down in the interest of defeating trump.  But we are doomed to spend a generation fighting this out hoping that exhaustion will recreate a viable center.  Or worse, somebody actually wins.
Fun fact: Barron Trump and Ivanka’s children will not be returning to a physical classroom this fall.
It will be epic and when they get through fact-checking Trump you are going to find out that Trump has done a lot of lying, just tune into CNN you'll see just like I did!!!
And by "Barack Obama", you mean "Donald Trump".Donald Trump, Jr. is the chief jack-officer.

You support Trump, yet you criticize someone else?   He’s responsible for a hell of a lot of misery &amp; death. You’re lying to yourself if you won’t admit it (you won’t).  Every other country got their sht together, but not US. We’re a laughingstock. We have no leader, just a fool.
Ooo, are they all going to go to Gitmo?  As I said, I’m waiting for the Barr October Surprise, which will probably involve FBI. Everyone knows it’s a politically motivated stunt that won’t hold up.  Don’t get too excited. There’s Trump Truth Commissions coming.
I can easily admit these governors made awful mistakes.  For you, it’s just a game. You aren’t capable of admitting Trump made mistakes.   Because we don’t have quick &amp; dependable testing, we will never get a grip on this. England has a 90 min test. We have a 9 day test.
Trump care is not a thing. I am counting on him addressing this in his second term!
And your point is?  is right. You people are cloven hooved swine. KAG TRUMP 2020
Tell that to the 160,000 dead. Potentially 280,000 by November.  You all are even willing to accept widespread death for Trump. He wouldn’t piss on you if you were on fire, if he had to miss his tee time to do it.  He plays you so well.
Yes, I linked it further down. Clearly, Trump didn’t get the result he wanted.
We had an opportunity to have all the masks we needed, made in the US, set up by a doctor at NIH and an American company. They BEGGED the Trump admin four times in Jan &amp; Feb to set it up. They said— nah. Idiots &amp; amateurs.
Here’s an accurate, comprehensive timeline — not a PR release for Trump. One issue that affected response: the administration had steadily dismantled pandemic &amp; emergency response safeguards, foreign policy safeguards, &amp; health safeguards. Oops.
Please  just claim your marbles you stole from us and go away!  Opinion | We are only beginning to suffer the consequences of Trump’s failures
You’re quoting the Trump villain WHO? Ironic.   I’m not talking travel bans — I’m talking preparation. Which Trump didn’t do. Doctors begged him to put in orders for PPE. He refused. He wasted Jan &amp; Feb completely.
And I am not blind nor uninformed nor uneducated nor naïve and dumb not downright hateful prejudice people. I love Donald Trump and I need him out office  I do feel with all of my heart Joe Biden will bring America back. I am not a left winger nor am I a right winger.
Legally, Sessions was obligated to recuse. I know the law is unimportant to Trump, but it’s a fact.  What Trump found offensive was Sessions wasn’t willing to break the law for him. But Bill Barr is. I never thought I’d have any respect for Sessions, but he did stick to it.
There are lots of ways to screw up parenting:
i hope that the girls out there dating trump stans know that their man will always be more in love with turnip man 🍊 then with them ❤️ like sis he doesnt even have a pic of you in his room but he’s got the full cardboard cutout of a pedophile and his name in their bio 💀
I certainly hope so. Barr and Trump deserve jail terms.
Yet it never would’ve risen to that number of patients, if Trump had listened to the intel, warnings,&amp; briefings he received, rather than holding rallies, fundraising, &amp; playing golf in Jan &amp; Feb.   He thought it would disappear — still does. He’s a fool. Ultimately, it’s on him.
My point is that Trump and Trumpism isn’t the root cause of our problem but a symptom. The root of our problems is a willful ignorance brought on by a refusal to accept facts b/c too many don’t like those facts. Too many Americans think freedoms includes freedom from reality 1/x
I would love to be added to the list. TRUMP 2020 ♥️🇺🇸👊🏼

Is it true that the lawyer working for Donald Trump who sued the small TV station in Wisconsin is the same lawyer that is working for Kanye West’s campaign? How is that legal. The campaign running two candidates for the Republican Party?
Oh, I’m prepared for Barr to release an October Surprise of indictments — we all know something sleazy &amp; completely political like that’s coming. Just meant for election, won’t hold up. Maybe McCabe, Comey, Strzok. Barr is just Trump ‘s Roy Cohn.
Trump is not allowed to operate any type of charity or foundation because of it.
I’ll be too busy celebrating, I imagine. If it weren’t for the coronavirus, this country would erupt in the biggest party in history. Regardless, the world will celebrate — and breathe a collective sigh of relief.  That is, if Trump doesn’t barricade himself in the White House.
It's part of the way a conman operates, right? Election interference has a meaning--bad or unlawful efforts to interfere with voting. But Trump renders our common language meaningless. It reminds me of the way he uses lawyers to tie up judicial attempts to limit him. Endless bs.

Regardless of what else Sessions did, he did assigned Huber to look into HRC (purely based on Trump’s animus).  What Trump &amp; his toadies are angry about is Huber’s inability to drum up a case against the Clinton’s. Huber investigated rather than coming up w/desired results.
I’d like to hear Trump sight read Albuquerque.
We should thank Trump. He represents all the worst things about the United States right out in the open. Untethered consumption and depravity. Hatred and spite. We look at the worst things about us everyday. It’s all up hill from him.
Biden will have a code stroke before Trump’s re-election. He gets very agitated and loses his composure. Someone will push him about his statements about Black Americans.
US intel: Russia acting against Biden; China opposes Trump
I’m smiling. Many came out after Trump. He shut them up by taking a cognitive test. Biden should not be afraid. He says he can ace it. Let’s see.
Hitler would not allow any German to say a kind word about a Jew. The left will not allow anyone to say a kind word about Trump or his supporters. Who is being had by whom? How does hate emerge in consciousness? How does it make you stupid? Inquire.
Yes. 71% means a little better than 2 in 3 chance. Meaning between a 1 in 3 and 1 in 4 chance Trump wins.   If you flip a coin 10 times and get heads 3 times, that doesn't mean the coin's broken.
No shit Sherlock. Trump is the worst thing for China and Iran. Russia is small potatoes compared to them.
You mean when they got closer than any other mainstream forecast model and published an article days before the election warning people to be cautious and that Trump was only a normal polling error away from winning?
Russia's an asshole nation who thrives on creating chaos in the world. Trump makes the job way too easy for them it's no surprise that they backed him in 2016 and again in 2020. Putin probably laughs his ass off at what a fool Trump is while he thinks he's the smartest guy.
I'm voting for him, but that's it. To get rid of Trump I would vote for Satan, or a dog, or a paper bag.

I am not entirely convinced that when  said Biden is going to "hurt God", Trump wasn't talking about himself 🤨
This is about corruption, not guns. Everyone can see how Trump defends the corrupt and harasses the innocent over and over and over again.
“He's a narcissist and he is delusional," Bottoms said. "He's done nothing for African Americans in this country, and to speak that in the same sentence as John Lewis is almost blasphemous."
I'm picturing Trump saying "my people!" Once he found guns and God, he was right at home.

Is it a conspiracy theory to think that Trump's insistence on hindering tiktok stems directly from zoomer activism against him?

I think that Trump and Putin really want to sleep with each other.  Classic back rubbing posturing.
Convincing everyone that Trump is just an old man with no idea what he’s doing is the most dangerous thing they’ve done.
My grandma called today to tell me my posts about Biden on Facebook might make people vote for trump but I’ve mostly been posting video clips of him just speaking....
In 2018, Trump pressured Sessions to investigate HRC. It’s actually, you know, illegal, to drum up investigations against your enemies, but Sessions finally named investigator named Huber to look at all those Clinton conspiracies.   He found nothing.Didn’t announce it, of course.
I’m pretty smart. My sons are very smart. We all agree Trump is very smart. They also both believe that they are smarter than Biden. So you need to wake up. Young people can see through your BS.
Are you saying you'll vote for Trump if you don't get who you want? Shame.
I think  's assessment of the possibility of Trump refusing to leave office is essentially right EXCEPT a strong Biden victory might backfire. If Biden is too successful it could play into a "fake votes" narrative. Fox News' will decide how Trump does, not the GOP.
Trump kills highs!

Agreed. I’m torn, being a proponent of clear policy/political philosophy beliefs from candidates so that voters can make an informed decision. However I think joe is crossing the line and attempting to appease voters he probably already has. This will just make a great trump ad.
Trump was blessed with great genes. Biden does not have Trump’s work ethic or energy. Biden’s good genes of his youth are no longer expressed. He’s an old man, fading toward his finitude. No one can stop that.
The ability to admit mistakes and apologize for those mistakes is one of the most critical differences between Trump and Biden. He is nowhere close to perfect, but still is miles ahead in terms of caring for others. It is our job to hold Biden to these promises once elected.
Betty, I’m a physician. Trump has a great mind. Biden has a failing mind. Look at Biden videos over the last two years. Something is going on. Let’s see a cognitive test and EEG. Let’s inform the public; let’s bring this out into the light of day.
But.. didn't Trump say that COVID19 was a ploy from the Democrats to discredit him??   STRAIGHT clown behaviour  (But seriously, I need some names, fam. Art thieves don't sit well with me)
Maybe, maybe not—but it is important for Biden to stand up to Trump’s petty insults, and to not concede ground to him.
And you think Trump doesn't have any appalling scandals and blood on his hands? Wow you must not watch TV or see his pictures with women and prostitutes. And hangs out with people who have sex slaves. So don't tell me that Trump is not guilty. Like how he handles his daughter.
Kevin McCarthy will do a great job then handoff to Trump.

It’s not racist to say your going to make a diverse choice for VP who brings a different perspective to the table. Trump would have been/is labeled a racist because he is one.
Power is the only thing, besides money, that Trump has ever been interested in. Do a search on malignant narcissism and read Mary Trump's book. Trump wants to be America's dictator and Putin and China are working to make it happen.
If you think the GOP assumes people will vote for Kanye just because he’s black, that’s an incredibly racist (and wrong) assumption. The GOP assumes people will vote for Kanye because he’s famous - and they will, largely from younger demographics that don’t favor Trump.
She's an easy target bc she says the quiet part out loud. This is how 80% of white women think. They pretend like having BLM on their IGs makes them not racist, or that secretly voting for Trump saves unborn babies. It's sociopathic &amp; excuses them from self reflection or empathy
Pelosi and her goons were too busy impeaching Trump to see the 30 mile plume from the crematoria in Wuhan. They refused to investigate China then and now. America we have a problem. Vote the hateful Dems back across The River Styx.
Kinda bummed this isn't about Trump
Go Trump! He’s the best there is.
NY AG announcement is about this. No Trump news today. In normal times, this would indeed melt down twitter. But these are not normal times.
“B-b-but Trump...” Shut up. Biden sucks and we all know it.
The rule was not guilty, Ford is a liar &amp; was well paid to lie.  Democrats dirty tricks and games won’t work under Trump! 😂
Hyperbole ("kill us all") isn't helpful and sounds petty, more like something Trump would say than any respectable influencer. Don't stoop to their level.  Arguments carry more weight if you stick to the punchline ("what if you offered full virtual for those who wanted it") 👍
The innacuracies in the FISA application for Carter Paige (who had already left the Trump campaign) are not new news, and were not partisan in their motivations, and were not unique to Paige. They are an argument against FISA, but not that it was used in a partisan manner here.
The President is doing everything needed. President Trump gave Governor’s the Task of managing their own States because each State is different.   Blame the Governor’s, they are the issue in Blue States.   Trump’s Democrat scientists &amp; Taskforce set guidelines to follow!
Comey certainly made errors—namely announcing the reopening of the investigation into Clinton’s letters a week before the election—but the investigation into Russia’s contacts with the Trump campaign was appropriate, necessary. The idea that he was out to get Trump is absurd

How ironic. You voted for Trump?
We are the real Donald Trump. He's a wannabe Putin.
Now Biden has plans Trump has no plans he just says it is what it is.
Well we all have our own opinion you have yours and I have mine and I'm not leaving and I know you're not leaving so we can just agree to disagree. What you mean my opinion Trump doesn't care about Americans only his political process
Donald is either lying or grossly incompetent. It is not possible he could have known so little about Deadly Virus Covid19 (and everything else) from his high position as POTUS. The Pandemic of the Century, and he had no idea what he was doing?
It’s intentional. The new postmaster is a wealthy Trump appointee.
I think Trump made the mistake of not realizing how much some people, particularly his older, rural voters, might depend on the USPS, and might be very unhappy to have their dependable mail service disrupted as part of an election tactic.  Doesn’t hurt to let people know about it
Epoch times owned by China, Republican propaganda rag. Trump knew about covid, profits off Chinese trademarks, Praises actual traffickers Epstein gf Ghidlaine Maxwell. Quack conspiracy theorists donned fringe terrorists by FBI that you’re promoting by using this hashtag #VoteBlue
Trump is right. Article published in Science yesterday elucidates why children are immune. There are four endemic coronaviruses that provide cross immunity to COVID-19. We should be having endemic coronavirus parties. The masks may prevent immunity. What a twist!!
Earlier today, Trump claimed children are safe and practically immune from Covid.  Your children are not safe.  Children are vulnerable to immunological and neurological disorders that may last a lifetime.  Know the facts about kids and COVID and protect…
Biden is so much better than Trump so I'm Ridin with Biden. Biden's the better of two evils because Trump is the biggest evil.

The torch hides behind a torch for a reason. Another Bolshevik who wants to burn America down. Trump is the only one who can stop the Bolsheviks, and we all know it. Go America! Go Trump!
Jesus, both Trump and Biden are so damn OLD. 😖
Biden has no executive functions left. Obama is worried about him. He wants Susan Rice to be a wetnurse for his second infancy. If you want security vote Trump!  If you want chaos, vote for Biden!
I guess if you can swallow what . says you can swallow what Trump says. . There are #ConsequencesForTrump and his friends.
Trump has the data on his side.  New article published in Science today gives more evidence of why we should open up schools. Four endemic Coronaviruses provide immunity to COVID-19. Children are probably immune because of cross immunity.
.  and  won’t do anything about it. They continue to enable Trump’s corruption, genocide and russian bounties. They don’t care  #Pelosi

The facts are on Trump’s side. The numbers and data. The Italian and Spain studies show that sheltering in place has the same exposure rate as work.
Biden could catch COVID. He’s going to get a lot of exposure soon. That would be a great twist if Trump helps to save Biden.
Hitler used the same hate strategy. He would not allow any German to say a kind word about a Jew. The left will not allow a kind word about President Trump or his supporters. Attacking the CEO of Goya was a classic Nazi tactic. Who is being had by whom? Inquire!
In case anyone is wondering, this change means ⁦ realizes he’s losing badly and knows he needs to do something to shift the narrative as soon as possible. This is a loser’s move that reeks of desperation.

7,400 people die everyday in the US before COVID. Less have died in first two quarters of 2020 than the last two quarters of 2019. Most COVID deaths are in at risk elderly. Many sent to their deaths by Dem gov. Trump has saved our economy. Biden can’t go to Milwaukee. He’s over!
“You ain’t stupid if you don’t vote for me.” Joe Biden. BLM Bolshevik mob wants to remove the police so they can destroy one community at a time. It took them 5 years to kill 30 million in Russia. Biden can’t stop them. President Trump can.

Some states are, some are not—vote by mail advocates have been saying this for months—and Trump and the GOP are definitely arguing to stop vote by mail (except in FL, I guess)? But the House corona relief Bill provides money to make vote by mail safe and secure everywhere. Guess

Trump had a perfect score. Check his results. Surprise is a big part of the test. Biden will take a different test regarding content. But Biden needs a test by Navy doctors with no political affiliation.
If you compare what Trump has done to the big six countries in Europe with total population similar to America. Trump and Republican governors have done a phenomenal job with COVID. Take out NY and NJ, and we are the gold standard for the world.

I honestly can not comprehend how a human being with any cognitive ability can listen to Dr. Fauci and Donald Trump and not be 100% positive who they should believe. I guess I just don’t get it, kinda like the President.
Trump has the best empirical mind of our time. He wakes up looking at COVID issues, numbers, vaccine results, world monetary data, jobs, interest rates, stocks, bonds, valuation, and Fed Reserve concerns. Biden wakes and asks where am I.
Nagy died because China preferred an infected world rather than an isolated China. They sent 30k a day from infected Wuhan to 194 countries during Jan and Feb. Had Trump not issued the travel ban we’d have 3 million Nagys and would be in the greatest depression in history.

And yet Congress investigated in 2016 and found nothing. If there’d been scandal there, the GOP &amp; Trump campaign would’ve been all over it.  Trump insisted Sessions investigate HRC again, so JD investigator looked into all he could find 2018-19.  Once again, there was nothing.

Yeah that's kinda weird.   Moe likely explanation is Trump doesn't have a leg to stand on if he can't "save" America from socialism.   Then he has to grasp at straws to somehow make Biden a socialist.   And his followers are so out of touch they don't know the difference.

It was a hard choice but 1) trump cuz he just gotta go 2) bezos cuz all that untaxed money and poorly treated employees
I’m certainly not a partisan. I’m a moderate. Yet, it’s obvious that unless people are falling for propaganda, rarely would there be an intelligent person loving Trump as he is an abysmal, corrupt, failure. I say this with 99% certainty: Trump will lose.

Trump claims he will do existing conditions protections by executive order -  why didn’t Obama do that???  Maybe because it can’t be done by executive order?
He doesn’t realize he is being used by big business. You my be done with Trump but you’re still carrying out his wishes. Our country is sick, jobless, hungry and many have died. We need a politician with diplomatic experience. Do you have those skills?

Yeah. At this point I feel like every organization and person who is not pro Trump can get what they want as long as they don’t get in their own way. Of course, this is something Dems have failed to do time and time again, and Biden also has to not do it to himself either. 😅

Unfortunately, you are not wrong. I also think that’s why he was somehow made the Democratic candidate... b/c he is the easiest target for Trump and Russia to campaign against. Trump will use anything bad that happened in Obama’s terms against Biden saying he was in on it too. 😅
Trump comes across as a buffoon. We all know that. Joe ain’t exactly acing these appearances either, and the pressure on Biden is minuscule compared to Trump. He should be knocking these appearances out of the park but...

I feel sorry for Kanye, his kids, and his wife.  It’s easy to say what she should do, but the laws make it incredibly difficult for her to act in his best interest.  This latest episode from Trump World is beyond the pale and they’ve drilled below the bottom of the barrel.
Of course Fox is saying trump’s approval ratings are going up! Duh!  He made them main stream and they will say everything that’s untrue just to get ratings.  trump is still DOWN in the ratings and both trump and Fox News is sill lying to all Americans!
In 2012, I voted for “none of the above” precisely because of Trump’s personal immorality.  Republican and evangelical voters had a much better choice  in the primaries, but chose poorly. After 4 years, Trump cleaned up his act, so he gets my vote.
See, now you're getting into propaganda shit again.  There is no major war happening at the border (pan to a caravan the left COMPLETELY lied about). Crazy how that suddenly just went away. EVERYTHING TRUMP DOES IS MISDIRECTION. If there's something bad, he always deflects.

Most Trump supporters acknowledge he's not a good person. Are there some crazed ones that do? Sure! But the majority of us understand that he's flawed. People who say Christians should only vote for people of good moral character are essentially telling us not to vote, ever.
Any rational adult would struggle debating trump but not for the reasons Geraldo thinks. More like “WTF are you even talking about?” or “Am I being punked?” or even “If you’re not going to take this seriously, I’m not doing this.”
Is Donald Trump yours? Because ypu seem to be going out of your way to get him reelected.  We are not stupid
Trump isn't a good person. I'll give you that. But we don't support Trump because we think he's Christian. You're not a bigot that thinks Christians only vote for Christians are you?
Don't ya just hate it, when you accidentally throw a Nazi Heil salute and people get all upset about it?   Except for the fact that nobody does that accidentally, ever  Dude is a Nazi POS!  Because I'm not a Trump supporter, I don't have to defend these sickening subhumans
It is very difficult to watch. It also kills every liberal narrative of Trump being a racist without them looking like complete hypocrites. There are many other videos as well. This one of a fun one. You have to skip a few minutes in to get to Biden.

No, it doesn’t, it’s only if you limit your scope of time. Long after Trump leaves office in January people will be dying from his stupidity. See where I’m goin with this sparky?
Fake ads and photoshopping will get you nowhere. You’re being called out and made to look really foolish. Give it up. Just resign before you lose badly.
The Darth Vader helmet is on backorder.
Good news! Trump's sycophant needs to be replaced by a man of courage.
Don’t make hate a way to make a decision? Let’s see. Quick comparison. What’s worse, Germany (Hitler) and Japan killing 400k in WWII or Trump doing it because he won’t shut down the country because he’s too stupid to listen? Imagine Hitler in front of you now, got any hatred?
I AM AMERICAN. More than you because when I see a bully, I call bullshit and put him on it. I.E. Donald J. Trump. See I’m the bully’s bully. I’m tired of the constant excuses. Trump is killing people as we speak; HE DOESNT KNOW WHAT HE’S DOING. He’s not listening to scientists.
I also don’t like her son pro Trump views. Reminds me of KellyAnne\George Conway. We don’t need this drama or dysfunction. This would be a gift to the GOP.

Trump v. Vance Decision Means E. Jean Carroll’s Lawsuit Against President Will Move Forward, Judge Rules
If there is ANY word to describe Trump, I think it's misunderstood. He talks like no other POTUS &amp; so when people hear him talk, they hear racist, narcissist, liar, etc. For example him saying the virus will "go away". He's being grossly misunderstood here. He's the ultimate /8
we can't say, but we know for sure Trump's campaign and early presidency was spied on. Yes, liberals can look at his firings of Comey &amp; others as "corruption" but especially with what we know now, how could he NOT fire Comey? He was CLEARLY incompetent. /3
Trump would need to clear it with his Deutchbank and Russian oligarch bankers.  This could require a new big line of credit.
Is it possible this whole thing was a setup so he could avoid Trump? 😂😂😂
The problem with you people is that you're so biased, you take a defense of anything trump mentioned or supported as a small trump rally. Just stop, the rest of us see you as psychotic. There is a point to the countdown, it speeds up and guarantees the process. Get over yourself.

wonder how many homeless people could be fed and housed by the funds that donald trump is using on youtube ads alone
He failed just like he failed on getting his love Kim jung un to stop building nuclear weapons. mr deplorable unethical trump will never admit to this failure...it is because he loves dictatorship and is eyeing a dictatorship position. It will not happen in the USA.

Second test for Ohio Governor Mike DeWine comes back negative. First test came back positive as the governor traveled to meet with President Trump in Cleveland. So no Covid and no meeting. Out of caution DeWine will test again this weekend.
I didn't ignore ANY of your tweets. Actually, I responded to every single one. You think Trump's policies were bad for the US economy. Which economic policies were bad for the US?
Are you kidding me? We have a pandemic, over 155,000 dead in this country and he’s worried about fucking TikTok? #TrumpIsAFailure
When you go out of the way to avoid criticizing despicable Trump toadies while picking nits with the media, you know what you do.
Eva... "i work with some of the most intelligent policy makers in the country. None are trump supporters." This is an anecdote. You don't use them in debates without being called a fool...
But he DID accept it. Trump, that is.

This is the perfect depiction of liberals growing to meet Trump! MAGA
Is this you?
You mean the majority of past business associates that still support him? He's managed to con the entire country? Geez, the way you talk about this guy is even more impressive than the way I talk about him.  And Trump became a Christian? When was this?
What policies are "shitty"? The ones where he helped the people of the Black community? Or the ones got rid of all of Obama's bad decisions to boost our economy? Or the ones where he brought jobs to the US? Or the ones that decrease trade deficits?
I'm not saying NYC likes Trump... I don't make claims like that because it is anecdotal and not based on facts. You also said because NYC is the economic capital of the US, it represents the country. Therefore, since NYC hates Trump, America hates Trump. Those are your words...
Show me a bunch of voters who are committed to Biden but will back off if the VP is Kamala.. or Whitmer, or any of them.  Sure we all have our favorites but anyone who would vote Trump due to the VP isn't with us anyway.

You’re clearly stuck with your opinion. I never said Trump has done nothing good, but he has done things much much worse than any President ever has. He won’t even go under oath, even when impeached because he has no respect for our institutions and no respect for the rule of law
The opinion of other countries is a minor concern. America first = Trump 2020!
Then vote for trump
Kanye was a dick before trump was.
You’re either a liar or ignorant
trump was my fourth, no compliments for him
Yes, but Trump supporters get released because of how dangerous COVID is. They refuse to wear masks because it's not dangerous but don't think they should stay in prison because it's dangerous. Trump logic.
Huh?  Are you drunk?   It’s either vote for the incompetent igornoramus that is Trump OR Biden.   Biden’s VP pick is just gravy.   Let’s keep it real folks.

IMO, there is no excuse for supporting the birther theory. However, that doesn't make Trump automatically a racist. It's obvious the sole aim was to make Obama ineligible to run for POTUS, not because he was Black, but because he was kicking Rep's ass. That was the REAL reason /1
They are not the President! Looks like Trump is the one that doesn’t care about black lives!
This man Trump is bored af huh #takehisphoneaway
DeSantis fired the woman who was reporting the real numbers, then Trump took away the data collection from the CDC and gave responsibility for it to the White House. I’m assuming Jared’s calculating the figures himself now. WE DONT TRUST YOU
Trump has been misspeaking and mispronouncing throughout his Presidency. He deserves ridicule if he can’t pronounce a country’s name right, among other things.
Probably the amount. But both sides want tons of pork. Frustrating - they can’t agree on a basic relief bill and leave the ornaments out of it! Give Trump some credit on this one. He wants to try executive order to get the basics in place.
I think Pres Trump needs a geography lesson. I’ve seen THREE Trump ads in the last half hour. In Georgia, on MSNBC!!! No Trump potential voters in Georgia watch MSNBC. #gasoline
It SHOULD mean Never every Republican who has enabled trump during his presidency.
The DOJ gave her a bye. Meanwhile Richard Burr of NC was sold out bc he’s on the Senate Intelligence Committee and they are about to come out with their report on Trump. No coincidence.
Says who, you? Who said I didn’t serve? How bout Trump? How’s his service record? Funny how hypocritical your response is guaranteed to be. I’m glued to the edge of my seat waiting with bated breath for this one.
I’m saying I’m positive Trump won’t get re-elected and I’ll bet $1k. Will you?
Oh, I’m not defending Trump at all. He may be a bombastic with no scruples about what he says but I don’t question his cognitive ability. On the other hand, It is clear that Joe Biden is suffering from actual dementia or something truly diagnosable. Great choices, America👎🏼
Trump used the cages far more than Obama, Trumps family has racked in 10’s of millions while being public servants and his policing initiative has literally done nothing to curb any police brutality
There are 160,000 Americans dead from a pandemic and President Trump just said this about dishwashers: “We now have the water that you need, instead of stupid where you have much less water than you need”
Donald Trump has never shown up to a congressional hearing as he would lie and commit an act of perjury if put under oath.   He’s not only a clown, but an embarrassment
I would stand on broken glass for 8 hrs to vote against Trump.
Also, compare policies. Trump signed prison reform that RELEASED majority POC, Biden's prison reform IMPRISONED mostly POC. Trump funded HBCUs, Biden supported segregated schools. Trump created OZs to help minority communities, Biden supported policies to keep POC impoverished.
you know, Tony Alpert in Battlefield Hardline was very literal about his second amendment rights, I have a bad feeling that some of Trump’s white nationalist followers are just as literal about their second amendment rights as Alpert!
I'm actually from LA, went to school at UCSD.👍  Trump has said some dumb things, but its hard to deny that he has helped POC with his policies. And you know Biden is no longer a moderate. He needs the left to win this election. Otherwise "Trump-haters" is his only base.
I'm with about Trump. I don't like always like his antics either. He also says things I don't agree with or give me pause. But this is bigger than how I feel about one man. This is about the future of America.
Oh Come ON S. E.  He could pick a tin can and it would be better than Trump and Pence.  If you say differently, you are just looking for excuses to vote for Trump and absolve yourself from responsibility.  PFFFTTTT
This should be a wake-up call for all those people that only hate Trump cause you think he's a "racist". If you're going to apply that term to one, then be fair and apply it to the other. And if you're Black and this doesn't give you pause, you're only confirming what Biden said.
This. all of it. If Trump is your guy, screw.
Is he quoting John Lennon?  No religion?   Imagine there’s no Trump. It isn’t hard to do.

So MUCH BLAME!!!! TRUMP CULT LEADER!
Please, Trump is the candidate who will get us to Third Impact, probably with Peter Thiel in the cockpit of Unit 01
I thought that word shouldn't be used in ANY setting, but fine. It's not just that clip. It's a repeated history of racist language AND actions. If you're going to say Trump is a racist, then be fair and do the same to Biden.
Joe Biden is a lifelong Catholic and Trump couldn’t accurately quote John 3:16 but subtle dog whistle my dude
You can do better  Learn the difference between misinformation and calling out misinformation!

Just because he was the VP of Obama, doesn't automatically make him not racist... He has a history of not only supporting racists, but taking policy actions that disparage the Black community. What actions has Trump taken that are racist?
Im not saying there’s no substance to his statement but more that he’s mishandling public appearances &amp; getting Trump out should be prioritized over an easily misunderstood niche sentiment  I’m not minimizing Latino diversity  My Filipino mom’s maiden sounds Latino=Conquistadors

No one should be surprised that Kanye would allow Trump &amp; his racist minions to use him by assisting him to get on ballots with the intent of helping Trump. Kanye is that Narcissistic &amp; Stupid.
What he was really thinking 💭 Trump after a brief pause: "I mean, who’s Melania? 🤔Have you seen her? But, 'Don't worry about it. Just don't worry about it.' I think I've got a good attitude." There, I fixed it. 🤣😂🤣😂🤣

The AG as recently as Wednesday posted online about her efforts to counter the Trump administration's actions on the census and abortion.
That’s too bad. She has a great story and I think she can handle Pence. And if Trump is trying to run as the law and order candidate, it seems like she’d be a great foil for his b.s. But, I’m a Never Trumper. I guess I’m out of touch with the base.

You sound like a Trump supporter. This is exactly the stance immigration hawks like Tucker Carlson and Anne Coulter have.
This is a click bait headline. As always, I suggest you read the article.    Second sentence:  "Overall, the poll found that 43 percent of voters would choose Biden in a present-day matchup whereas 40 would choose Trump.” BLOTUS is only ahead with midwestern, white, old, men.
She’s basically supporting everything Trump stands for. Build a country from within. Have national pride and love your country
Youre missing the point. Trump is like Poland &amp; Hungary &amp; wants to limit immigration &amp; just like Poland &amp; Hungary wants to build the nation within &amp; have the best quality of life for the inhabitants. You going to Poland are basically endorsing everything Trump supporters desire.

What you are witnessing is called "scapegoating."  I'll help you with the definition.  President Trump has failed so badly with managing the Coronavirus, that he is trying to rename it the China Virus so that people will blame China and not him.  Thankfully, most get that.
Yes, I'm aware that the Pres. calls the virus the Chinese Virus, but that is not the virus' name. No one else in the world calls it that. It's name is Coronavirus.  One could call it Trump virus for it killing 154k Americans on his watch I guess?   I still prefer the real name.

Of course a Trump supporter says all democrats are racist, but fails to recognize how unbelievably racist the man he supports is.

It’s not a red or blue issue. Trump invoked DPA for creation of ventilators and PPE after states had to go through bidding wars b/w themselves for necesssry equipment. Obama left a pandemic playbook (which Trump ignored) and created a pandemic task force (Trump disbanded this).
The trump administration had 3 &amp; 1/2 years to replenish that. Trump admin also disbanded the pandemic task force that was housed at the WH, which could’ve been in charge of this. They also ignored the pandemic playbook by the obama admin that would have addressed this.

You have blamed Trump for actions of officers he has no control over, while excusing the actions of politicians who do have control over the officers.  You can feel foolish, but I have asked for evidence that Trump's language has influenced any of the attacks &amp; have gotten none.
They are the ones in control of their city. Trump has zero control over the NYPD. The only people who can do anything about it, if they don't agree, are the city and the state. BTW, they both said the arrest should have happened, just not like that.   But ... "Orangeman Bad!"
Ok.   NYPD (a police department in a state and city that is overwhelmingly Democrat) arrests someone for destruction of property in NYC, but it's all because Trump is mean to the Chinese Communist Party.   Got it.
That was the NYPD.... Again, not Trump...
It was carried out by NYPD. Comrade DeBlasio is the mayor of NYC. Andrew "nursing home eradicator" Cuomo is the progressive governor.   The NY state assembly is 106-42 Democrat over Republican.   These were City police in a Democrat dominated state. But Trump tyranny?

I am still not sure Trump isn’t going to sacrifice Pence and pick Haley. It would give him both a COVID scapegoat and a woman on the ticket to match Biden.   That said, Biden could pick some rancid meat as his running mate and still have my vote.  #Biden2020
The DemocRATs wrote that law to 're-enslave' black men about the time they founded the KKK.  Come on man, the same DemocRATs formed BLM the new and improved KKK.  Only one who has done any prison reform since LBJ's Great Society destroyed the black family?  President Trump
Dictators don’t allow violent riots in their streets.  Dictators don’t allow district judges to tell them what to do, yet Trump has given in to every nationwide injunction issued. Even those overturned in appellate courts.   So tell me, how has Trump acted like a dictator?
Again, how would you condemn China?  Do you agree that the Communists in China deserve to be condemned?  Do you agree, that Trump has very little influence in Democrat bastions such as San Francisco where we see urban youths engaging in racist attacks against Asian Americans?
trump administration will try to spiN Anything.....and deplorables rejoice
That tRump blowin smoke up everyones ass
i believe in god and trump not socialism that what the so-called democrats want ,get real .
they hate him more than they hate trump
Kanye and Biden the only people standing up to Trump and Biden flakey as a mf
Nope at this point we can just call it a fact.  Trump has been that bad.
Trump's dreams of a vaccine as his October Surprise aren't rooted in reality   there are so many anti-Vaxxers who oppose vaccines of any kind, any #COVID19 vaccine would have to be truly safe &amp; effective to convince them &amp; still they may say no
I don’t use Tik Tok, but it seems to me, if it’s a real emergency than waiting 45 days to start, would suggest otherwise. Just another Trump action to divert the news cycle.
And this one can be blamed on Trump to I guess.
I’m sure the left can find a way to blame Trump for this.
So insult her with more ads, like Trump she seems to have a thin skin.
Felons. Not influenced by Trump or people calling out China. They are idiots.
That means ur voting for Trump. No vote = vote for trump.
Canada. Not big fans of Trump for the most part up there.
You think Trump is a leader.
It’s more that just Trump who isn’t watching.
You still haven't figured out why anyone would vote for Trump? It's simply because the Democrats are so abhorrent.  As it's been for so many of the recent elections, many see Trump as the lesser of two evils. There may be some "Trump cultists", but he was elected by moderates.
Trump bans dealings with Chinese owners of TikTok, WeChat
Buy it with RUssian assets laundered through a few condo transactions in tRUmp tower after he rapes teenage girls and boys trafficked by Epstein. Just another distraction of this repugnant, criminal president. The shame.
I would vote for a Pauly Shore/Gilbert Gottfried ticket over Trump and I'd be right in doing so.
Yep, sorry you are wrong on this. This single election will determine if we go all out Marxist for AOC or we make America back into the values your Father fought for in Vietnam. U may dislike Trump BUT he is the best chance we will have to return to what our founders intended.
Awww and you’re the kind of person who would make trump proud. #blueMAGA
Right?! It amazes me how many people were privileged enough to not wake up to these problems until Trump became president. &amp; then they get mad at those who have suffered &amp; learned from experience that things won’t get any better with Biden.🙃
Asian markets are tanking overnight after Trump’s executive order threatening WeChat and TikTok.
Trump has 84.7 mil followers. Biden has 7.4 mil. Nobody cares about Sniffin' Joe.
Alright  tell that to  and the other victims of Trump he assaulted. #TrumpIsNotWell #TrumpIsALaughingStock  #TrumpForPrison2020
Alezheimers is a terrible disease.  Crazy Joe will never debate Trump.  He'd be babbling nonsense after about 15 minutes.  It's elder abuse what you people are putting him through.
They hate trump so much they would put Biden in. The ramifications of a senile commander in chief eludes them
..And nothing of value was lost. :x   Taking the L to kill Tencent's influence to me, however petty that may sound, is the only good thing Trump has ever decided to blunder into.  If half of organized gaming cannot survive without a politically motivated Chinese company, tough.
Not me! And, I hope those I taught know better also  We are not taking about most people here.. Trump is the President of this nation and should know know better!
And Trump isn't saving video games. Censored or not by the end of the day it's up to the companies that release them on their systems what can and can't be censored. (looks at Devil May Cry 5 booty censorship on playstation) -_-.
The trump administration seized PPE orders from local governments.

You know Trump is the president and should’ve acted in order to prevent all of this from happening correct?
Feel free to watch the whole interview with Jonathan Swan it’s fantastic. I mean you might not think so since Trump is annihilated in it.
President Trump to ban dealings with Chinese owners of TikTok, WeChat
Trump visited Georgia’s governor just hours before he sued Bottoms. So herself and other leaders are like, “what a coincidence”.
You follow Trump, you don't care about truth.
⁦ &amp; ⁦⁦  missed the horrible news of the 7 year old that died in GA today. #emperorhasnoclothes #COVIDIDIOTS #covid #whatdahell #science #sciencenotidiocy
Trump literally said “it is what it is”
Uhm... Biden’s was today.  And remember the interview when he told black people they ain’t black if the are confused about who to vote for?  And the little thing about 7-11s.  What did Trump say last week? I think I missed it. You must know since you referenced it.   Do share.
The basis of democracy is the ability of protest. They weren’t rioting. Trump sending in secret police was an authoritatrian move to prevent people from their constitutional right to assemble.
Just another fruit loop !  Judge nixes Trump bid to delay suit from woman alleging rape
Did this doctor graduate from Trump University medical school?
Dementia Joe says black people all think alike and you say not a word about it?  Had Trump said it you would tweet about it for weeks.
If so, why are there reports of “GOP operators” helping him get on the ballots?  Why would GOP operators be working against Trump?  What am I missing? 🤷🏼‍♀️
Crazy Joe is in capable of learning from his mistakes.  He still believes, with notable exceptions 'you aint black' if you are voting for Trump.
Gonna get your book.  We can have differences in policy and how to execute them, and disagree with decency.   #Trump is not only an indecent person, he has made it so that now the whole concept of American democracy is at stake.
Why, it appears the GOP has not only embraced the policies of hate, voter suppression, lies, and denial, but encourages them. Why should anyone trust the GOP. Your father was a great man and he stood up to Trump and the GOP was silent.
Dead Team Trump: Please continue to make mental acuity the cornerstone of your campaign.
Commission rejects President Trump's push to add debate against Biden
trump is damaged
The only thing about #trump saying crap like this, is demonstrably, he has no plan or policies to lay before the people that invokes any type of confidence! He’s just a moron!!
Of course it does.  Never Trump MEANS Never Republican.  Songbird was always a DemocRAT.

We gotta get rid of TRUMP!

Ol #JimCrowJoe.... He’s officially given up on the Black vote 😂 he knows we’re not voting for him... Woo hoo!! #m4 more years of Trump I guess 🤷🏾‍♂️ oh well, what’s the worst that could happen #NoAntiBlackRacism #CutTheCheck
I don’t ever do politics on social media but if y’all vote for Kanye in states he’ll be on the ballot as an independent...He clearly struggles w/ a mental health issue. He is being exploited by the grand ole party and ‘dump trump’ to steal election again. #staywoke #democracyrule
Playing electoral defense, Trump claims Biden opposes God
Probably by giving Trump four more years.
Since you only believe Fox News, here’s an article FROM FOX NEWS proving my point.
trump is literally forcing schools to open and is threatening to pull their funding if they refuse. it’s a bit of blackmailing don’t you think?
Trump couldn’t find Main Street with a map.

Why They Hate Trump So Much
Trump says, without evidence, vaccine could be ready by Election Day  via  He's f'n joking. Like we're gonna believe THIS nonsense?
Seven years old. This is why Trump and Republicans cannot be allowed to spread misinformation about children being immune from the coronavirus.
I want to go to this Thighland that trump talking bout sounds like a fun place 🤔 😂😬
They showed no such qualms when Trump added to the deficit by cutting taxes on the rich. They’re just warning up to revisit their Obana-era obstructionist ways. I hope people remember this.
This guy is no better than trump, he’s just slicker with his wordplay  🤦🏾‍♂️
Blessed to have another lovely day of exceedingly normal facial expressions and skintones from Our Great President. Thank you, Mr. Trump.
Cynic!  This just PROVES Trump's Biblical literacy!  I'm sure he was just confusing Biden with Jacob.
Trump will protect God, guns...just not people.  Brilliant guy!  Just watch.
Go with Trump!  Brilliant guy!  Just watch!

Still waiting on a reporter to ask Trump to quote John3:16
I'm glad he's having so much trouble!! He really helps Trump get elected everyday. He's so pitiful, but I want to help him sometime because I really feel sorry for him Lol
Trump hate is what they live for. Joe could have a bowel movement while at the mike and the haters would vote for him and explain he overcame potty training but when he’s nervous....
What exactly are her qualifications? I believe we're having enough trouble with that now. She would cause Trump's re-election which we CAN'T have.
Trump is off his rocker to claim that about Biden!  How can he claim to know Biden's relationship to God?
shut down the country sooner  to save lives yet theres this #TrumpIsKillingAmericans ??? ppl are mocking hydroxychloroquine! THEY WONT EVEN TRY IT BC GOD FORBID TRUMP IS RIGHT. Yet when they finally realize it helps they'll find some way to say it was his fault.
Trump is just telling the truth
people dont like trump bc of what he does.. he does these things bc its WHAT REPUBLICANS SUPPORT/DO. half of yall online act like 5 year olds stomping bc you're not getting what you want. #Trump2020
Once a Republican always...it's nice some have allied with us, but we shouldn't trust them. Cupp was on the bandwagon right up to Trump...now she wants a say on Dem VP..?!  Oh Hell NO!
Also, its really sad to see people only go by what the media says. Did you know the trump administration donated $35 million to aid human trafficking victims? no? oh thats right bc the media only tells you the "bad" he does.

You underestimate Trump's evil. Connect the dots, Joy. He doesn't care about the 160K deaths since they are disproportionately black and brown Americans. As a racist, fascist, he views it as a coincidental, handy genocide.
The majority of people still fully committed to voting for Trump are doing it mainly because they LOVE that it pisses certain people off. Has nothing to do with politics, what might benefit them personally -- none of that. Just that it pisses certain people off.
Trump what were we suppossd to see?U top whatever every time u speak!

Reporters need to start asking trump questions about his mental health. Call him out on his inability to form sentences that make sense.
We are in the middle of a very real and on going crisis and we have an election coming and I want to talk about saving our country with health care , economic concerns, because its not just Trump I don't like!!!!!!😂🤣😀
Great journalism. Get a Trump hack/lacky to write an article extolling Trump’s non existent accomplishments &amp; then get the GOP, (Trump cult central), to tweet it out like it has significance beyond the bull it is.

Thank  you  3x NBA   Champion   LeBron  James  !   I  personally   could   care   less   what  trump   thinks  or   says !
Wow, this from a man who enables Donald Trump.
I don’t think it has to do with Trump. I think it’s about the NRA, which is almost as good.
No he doesn’t, his goal is to infiltrate our feeds and try to convince blacks either not to show up or vote for the Orangeman. Blacks in swing states will defeat Trump!
LIE - By 2016 President Obama brought the unemployment rate down for AfricanAmer from16% to 5% left by Bush in 2009. Trump makes claims his policies were the result, when it was obvious rates were still dropping when Obama left office.👁-DELTA-10-Tango
They know that a great economy is Trump's greatest asset.  To hell with the American people if they can defeat Trump!
If you told me 20 years ago that the 2020 election would be between Biden and Trump, I'd wonder if the country was nuts?   And I'd be right, too!
Even if it is a plan for Trump, I got no problem with that, Joe Biden, The clintons, Bill Gates, Obama. Etc need to be a as far away as bc possible
It's a diversion from everything else that's going wrong here. Unfortunately, that only works when the person directing the diversion has any amount of credibility, which Trump doesn't.  This is a simple (albeit large and catastrophic) ammonium nitrate explosion.

Really, I doubt that base on her testimony, but you’ll support any BS GOP talking points. Let’s hope TN realizes what a failure you and Trump are.
C'mon, context doesn't matter to who now? Trump called shit whole countries that because they are, nothing to do with race, you call him racist. Are you telling me that if Trump had EVER been on camera saying nigger you or any leftist would care about context?!?!

That's the goal - to drive votes.  Even though I'm replying to you on Twitter, you are right, who the hell cares how much Twitter activity it gets, as long as it gets ppl to vote for  It hits #Trump where it hurts.
u know trump was there right?

Trump inherited the trajectory and you people know it! Nothing Trump has done has created anything. Nothing you can point to from Trump made one damn bit of difference! Trump has always inherited everything, and he’s managed to fucked it all up! He’s the worst kind of loser🤡
Obama created the recovery from the disastrous years from the previous Republican administration. The longest monthly job creation began under Obama and continued until Trump fucked up the Coronavirus response. Unemployment was declining every year starting under Obama 2/
They will NEVER admit it..they will whine and blame..they will NEVER take responsibility! It will be Obama's fault for  not leaving enough Covid 19 tests for Trump to claim as  His!
So you don’t think Trump and his crime family are interested in their bank accounts?! Talk about not paying attention😂

That was my thought too so if trump uses the WH he doesn’t have to pay for a venue and saves his campaign money. And he uses all WH security that we pay for. Doesn’t seem above board to me.
I think Miss G got into tRump’s hair product. Looking pretty blonde these days. Maybe that’s what they do after golf. Do each other’s hair.
Question, who is responsible for paying for the  convention? trump indicated in his presser tonight how much money he would save the people by having it at the WH. Isnt this paid out of his campaign funds or do we pay for it?

It will go away like Trump: when it's forcefully defeated.
Wait... there is no exaggerated parody of Trump. Not really.

Is this supposed to be a joke making fun of a joke? Biden and trump jokes everywhere. Stop giving them fuel to work with and maybe the shitpoats would stop, lol. Nah, this every generation when something new comes along. Embrace it or you don’t. People will speak.
Oh my god you are so uneducated it’s funny. Yes you’re extremely racist. Saying “like you’re perfect” isn’t an excuse to be racist. You also didn’t disagree that trump is racist so i guess you agree.
Fauci just needs to say fuck it and spend time with his family. This is getting stupid that people would listen to Donald Trump instead of a man who has served under five presidents.
That made me want to throw-up when Trump did all that..sick man! And encouraging followers to go punch people and he would bail them out!  Name calling..humiliating people .. the list goes on and on!  How can anyone look up to this man?
Well, really anything discussing Trump.

Gee, what was happening last November?  Oh yeah, Nana's fake impeachment...  If Trump tried to do anything then you would have cried and said he was 'deflecting'.  You can't make this stuff up, ladies and gentlemen.  Trump landslide coming in November.  It's going to be great!
mr.  trump, cause I have no more words
Exactly. Democrats have turned over every stone and pebble looking for something. Trump's been investigated so much everyone knows all his dark secrets trying to unseat his presidency. If Hillary can't find it then it doesn't exist

You literally trust anything the comes from Trumps mouth and it’s sad. On top of that you’re a woman who supports trump? That’s hysterical considering he hates you.
It will be fun to watch.  I'll be honest I could care less who wins.  I love Trump like a brother, I wouldn't want my brother putting up with this abuse 24 x 7.  With Biden as President I can just sit back an laugh, laugh, laugh.

Trump's Trash!
The progressive movement hasn’t taken off because they can’t get votes. This is shown with Bernie and many DSA candidates.   I’ve seen nobody that predicted the DHS being used as a method for Trump’s re-election
Hey   What's wrong with your daddy?
Other than voting him out what do you think is the solution to stop Trump’s agenda? I would love to hear something that the majority of Americans would also agree with
Literally what would you do with Trump in office and Republicans with the majority in the senate.   Not everyone is in line with your views, you can see that in many elections
Biden may not be my first choice but I do not want Trump and Pence picking another supreme court Justice. Check out the Majority Report.
GREAT JOB  ❤️PKCV Live: Trump holds press conference  via

You took pride in holding crowded, mask free indoor superspreader events like the one with Trump at the mega church in Phoenix.
Hmm, but Donald Trump continues to spin the tale that no one is tougher on Russia than he is. Putin must be a masochist.   "Russia Continues Interfering in Election to Help Trump, U.S. Intelligence Says" #TrumpRussia #TrumpPutin #BountyGate #gapol
Really Lindsey. The Fed gov under Trump left the fight of the virus to the states.  And u promised help in the next bill when stimulus passed. U LIED AS USUAL AND GOP DIESNT WANT TO GIVE MONEY TO DESPERATE STATES AND SCHOOLS.  SCUMBAGS.
Many people voting against Trump instead of for Biden - would have preferred Bernie but we are where we are. Full speed ahead.
Tell that to Trump pre Covid. He ran up the deficit in 4 years to nearly the amount Obama raised in 8
You should see how much Trump added before the pandemic before you try to fake outrage about the deficit
As a part of the $100M  in grant funding made available for the #ReConnect Pilot Program through the CARES Act,  is investing more than $29M to provide #broadband service in unserved rural areas in #Oklahoma. #etisoftware #beamfly #ruralinternet
Trump cleaning up the mess that was left  to him by the previous guy. I like it!!!
America has an IRRESPONSIBLE leader in DONALD TRUMP. He and his Congress, along with FOX NEWS and their RACIST buddies REFUSE TO WEAR A MASK which is meant for safety, REFUSE TO FINANCE Americans during this pandemic crisis, REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE SYSTEMIC RACISM!
If you really care about the defcit, Donald Trump should be the President you despise the most
Right, not surprising Rod Blagojevich is a Trump fan, or that he's saying positive things about him since getting a pardon. Of course doesn't surprise me to see Dinesh saying nonsense in support of Trump. I just didn't think 'cosmopolitan' would appeal to his readership.
How do y’all feel about this upcoming election ? I think it’s fucked either way ... trump or Biden ... but could be worse with trump... I think we all doomed
Using the phrase “Trump Blacks” kind of embodies how the GOP screwed up this whole Kanye thing
Trump and Biden’s kids all went into the family business. And they all got rich.
insider  RRR saying that the embarrassing turnout at the Ariz-Nevada Trump rally Is why no campaign events. If kids r at school adults should do elections. Right?! Sounds like entire world is waiting on u to put me in. U told them U would! REMEMBER💊 ? ❤️PKCV

As I recall, ain't Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman a financial partner as well as best pals with Donald Trump and Jared Kushner?!   "Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been accused of sending a hit-squad to Canada"
That would be trump and his tweets.
When he is jilted by his paramour.  Trump eventually condemned Stormy Daniels.
Donald Trump claimed that children are immune to Covid-19, and to open up the schools. Guess sycophantic Georgia Republican Governor Brian Kemp took Trump at his word.    "Georgia child, 7, dies of coronavirus as state’s death toll surpasses 4,000" #gapol
My compassion ended when I saw he was a willing pawn in the trump re-election strategy.
Any rational adult would struggle debating trump but not for the reasons Geraldo thinks. More like “WTF are you even talking about?” or “Am I being punked?” or even “If you’re not going to take this seriously, I’m not doing this.”
Don't ya just hate it, when you accidentally throw a Nazi Heil salute and people get all upset about it?   Except for the fact that nobody does that accidentally, ever  Dude is a Nazi POS!  Because I'm not a Trump supporter, I don't have to defend these sickening subhumans
I can totally see the Dems overreaching and face the voters’ wrath in 2022 should they sweep to victory this November, but Trump and COVID are the only issues that matter now.
Your piece on Trump’s Axios and Chris Wallace car wrecks were incisiv.... wait you memory holed them
Why would someone be hiding their vote. The man is literally President. Feel like there’s more secret Biden voters than a trump voters
Well actually at this moment in time when you have all this shit going down in dem run cities, you are wrong. If you give it up, its gone. Sometimes we have to do shit that really sucks to make it right. Voting for Trump now is the only real answer at this time. Unfortunately
How great it is that deplorable unethical trump is gone.
May he Rest In Peace. May trump and Kimp suffer immensely.
Biden lacks of policy and ideas, Trump has a big chance to win and probably he will, because Electoral college 🤷🏽‍♂️, so focus on those states in which he only needs two or three points to win.
He failed just like he failed on getting his love Kim jung un to stop building nuclear weapons. mr deplorable unethical trump will never admit to this failure...it is because he loves dictatorship and is eyeing a dictatorship position. It will not happen in the USA.
Second test for Ohio Governor Mike DeWine comes back negative. First test came back positive as the governor traveled to meet with President Trump in Cleveland. So no Covid and no meeting. Out of caution DeWine will test again this weekend.

Hmm, I prayed to God, queried Her regarding this latest preposterous claim of Trump's - She was quite bewildered. She replied that Her servant Joe has been a most devout follower.   "Trailing in election polls, Trump says rival Biden is 'against God'"
It’s like they have us over a barrel! We’re sures hell not voting for Trump so all that’s left is Biden and he’s not right for America either. It’s ridiculous and unfair that 4 states decided who would be the democratic candidate for the whole country!  How are we ok with this?
Show me a bunch of voters who are committed to Biden but will back off if the VP is Kamala.. or Whitmer, or any of them.  Sure we all have our favorites but anyone who would vote Trump due to the VP isn't with us anyway.
That was me, too. Was for Scott Walker, then Marco Rubio, then Ted Cruz. Wouldn't vote for Hillary, couldn't vote for Trump, ended up voting for Evan McMullin (talk about a wasted vote!). This time? Will crawl through glass to vote for President Trump - the Dems are that bad...
You’re clearly stuck with your opinion. I never said Trump has done nothing good, but he has done things much much worse than any President ever has. He won’t even go under oath, even when impeached because he has no respect for our institutions and no respect for the rule of law
The opinion of other countries is a minor concern. America first = Trump 2020!
Then vote for trump
Kanye was a dick before trump was.
You’re either a liar or ignorant
trump was my fourth, no compliments for him
Just throwing it out there: If people started boycotting the Kardashian’s brand and citing Kanye’s relationship with Trump as the reason, this might wrap up quickly
Lindsey used to attempt to be honorable.  Nowadays just says whatever he thinks will help trump.  No truth to power in his character.  Oops. No character.
This man Trump is bored af huh #takehisphoneaway
DeSantis fired the woman who was reporting the real numbers, then Trump took away the data collection from the CDC and gave responsibility for it to the White House. I’m assuming Jared’s calculating the figures himself now. WE DONT TRUST YOU
Probably the amount. But both sides want tons of pork. Frustrating - they can’t agree on a basic relief bill and leave the ornaments out of it! Give Trump some credit on this one. He wants to try executive order to get the basics in place.
It SHOULD mean Never every Republican who has enabled trump during his presidency.
Trump used the cages far more than Obama, Trumps family has racked in 10’s of millions while being public servants and his policing initiative has literally done nothing to curb any police brutality
There are 160,000 Americans dead from a pandemic and President Trump just said this about dishwashers: “We now have the water that you need, instead of stupid where you have much less water than you need”
Donald Trump has never shown up to a congressional hearing as he would lie and commit an act of perjury if put under oath.   He’s not only a clown, but an embarrassment
I would stand on broken glass for 8 hrs to vote against Trump.
you know, Tony Alpert in Battlefield Hardline was very literal about his second amendment rights, I have a bad feeling that some of Trump’s white nationalist followers are just as literal about their second amendment rights as Alpert!
Oh Come ON S. E.  He could pick a tin can and it would be better than Trump and Pence.  If you say differently, you are just looking for excuses to vote for Trump and absolve yourself from responsibility.  PFFFTTTT
All that money should have went directly to taxpayers who would have had money to put into the economy! Americans could have sheltered in place and contained the virus so schools and businesses could safely reopen, but no Trump and corporate politicians had it their way as usual!

Or with Trump taking action (e.g. China travel ban) in late January and all the left (including Biden) freaking out.
Let me guess, there’s a correlation between Trump’s cult members and the people who disapprove of Obama.
Joe Biden should refuse to debate Trump until he releases his tax returns. If you look at the polls Trump needs these debates more than Biden does. If Biden doesn’t debate Trump that’s arguably more harmful to Trump than Biden.
Watching the full Trump Axios interview and, whooo boy, it is 38 minutes of stream of conscious lies and delusion.
"Assault weapons" Have been banned from public access since 1986.

TRUMP IS A FOOL !
Good. I’m sure he spoke with trump to get clarification on the virtues of morality.
I do wish Trump has a better grasp on the facts. Goddam it seems like he just reads what is in front of him and has no real connection to it. But, at least he can read and think in semi-complete sentences. Even if they often make no sense.
Poor Lindsey. You are trending.  And it’s not kind.  Your faked fealty to trump is embarrassing.  This hearing blew up in your face.  It may cost u your ELECTION. WE CAN PRAY.
God miller. Trump used “everybody saying” people are telling me” I’ve heard from lots of people” many people agree with me”.   All the while lying.  Trump has no scruples.

After Trump's interviews with Chris Wallace and Jonathan Swan, I'd be more worried about him.
I'd prefer to see them behind bars!
Disappeared? What the hell are you on about with this talking point? He's been doing events and giving speeches on a weekly basis. Besides, why fight with Trump over the airwaves when Trump continues to damage his own political standing just by talking?
So are you saying that working against your own government under any administration is okay? Trump would have been fine with it because he fires anyone trying to safeguard our democracy and promotes and embraces those who engage in criminal activity.
Beyond Trump's lies about him post actual proof of your inane assertion.
I really wish Hillary Clinton had been in charge of stopping this pandemic instead of Donald Trump
If you added up every Biden gaffe, you'd still have the equivalent of just one Trump press briefing.
Safe to say that  is floundering badly in his reelection campaign. The fact that his staff doesn't care to see it, will only serve to help  win in a landslide
Remember that  said this was an attack, without facts to back that claim up. Trump is dangerous.  Fact-checkers conclude Beirut explosion was not nuclear blast and Lebanon cites ammonium nitrate stored in warehouse as the cause
The fact that Trump is struggling in a usually safe red state like Iowa should concern him.

Herman Cain, the former Republican presidential candidate, businessman and close ally of President Donald Trump, was guided by his Christian faith in politics, business and his personal life, his pastor said at his funeral Friday.
Trump loves nothing better than these polls that paint him as the underdog. I wouldn't be surprised if he's not somehow responsible for their looney predictions!
You should see how much Trump added before the pandemic before you try to fake outrage about the deficit
It’s the wrong kind of smart as it is cheating.   Trump is no way genius.   He is underhanded, scheming, deceitful, devious, sly, crooked, duplicitous obliquitous, calculating, crafty, sneaky and Machiavellian!
Time to stop these talks before the Republicans cave. President Trump’s EO is exactly what we need (-) extra $600 unemp

How do y’all feel about this upcoming election ? I think it’s fucked either way ... trump or Biden ... but could be worse with trump... I think we all doomed
great thread.  At this point, do Trump supporters even read?
Please, be careful, President Trump!!!
This is all coming from McConnell if you look back to when it began. Trump told us so in a presser where he thanked those who helped him fend off impeachment.  Doubt he’d waste time with chess on this. He did Kobach same way.
I think if Biden wins by voter fraud then there will be an all out civil war. I don't think Trump wants this to happen.
Whoever runs ads for Trump is doing an A+ job. Nothing about my online presence indicates I’d even THINK about voting for the big orange dildo. Go ahead and keep wasting that ad spend on my liberal ass. You’re doing great sweetie. 😉

My compassion ended when I saw he was a willing pawn in the trump re-election strategy.
He isn’t doing this because he cares, he’s not doing it because he wants to be president, he’s not doing this because he’s a good guy, because we all know he isn’t. He’s doing this because his BFF has shitty numbers and HES trying to keep Trump as president. Kanye is a POS
Any rational adult would struggle debating trump but not for the reasons Geraldo thinks. More like “WTF are you even talking about?” or “Am I being punked?” or even “If you’re not going to take this seriously, I’m not doing this.”
Trump has done nothing for the black community and how would you even know? Are you black? No? There's a seat over there then
I'm very aware of who both are. There aren't any 'non-racist' options. That's been my entire life story. But I'm married to a dreamer and Trump wants to make it harder for people like my wife to stay here; so why would I vote for his particular racism? A real answer...

No, he didn't.   And if he hadn't ignored it and called it a hoax back him January, and hadn't fired the pandemic response team, this wouldn't have gotten this bad.  This is Trump fault. This is his plague.
FWIW: NORVA is The Swamp, the epicenter for Karen, and basically everything Trump stands against. Hampton Roads area has a huge black population and turnout.

Well now. Trump decided to ban companies from doing business with Chinese companies like Tencent. I am pretty sure he doesn't know nor care but he may have caused a huge crash in the gaming/tech industry in the USA because of it. Tencent owns a very large portion of the gaming
Biden lacks of policy and ideas, Trump has a big chance to win and probably he will, because Electoral college 🤷🏽‍♂️, so focus on those states in which he only needs two or three points to win.
He failed just like he failed on getting his love Kim jung un to stop building nuclear weapons. mr deplorable unethical trump will never admit to this failure...it is because he loves dictatorship and is eyeing a dictatorship position. It will not happen in the USA.
I don't know. Because nothing good can happen, probably not. The only silver lining in this election cycle would be the two brain addled, racist ramblings of Biden v Trump. We probably won't even get that.
“Trump bans LoL”   Future headlines write themselves
You must admit.  Trump is amazingly consistent.  He never shows empathy, he never apologizes, he lies every day, he usurps our institutions and obstructs accountability, he invents facts, propagates false conspiracies... all before lunch.

Yeah. At this point I feel like every organization and person who is not pro Trump can get what they want as long as they don’t get in their own way. Of course, this is something Dems have failed to do time and time again, and Biden also has to not do it to himself either. 😅

Many people voting against Trump instead of for Biden - would have preferred Bernie but we are where we are. Full speed ahead.
So it looks like the Republicans purposely sabotaged the negotiations for stimulus just so Trump can look like the hero and do an Esexutive order this weekend. Ridiculous and careless when so many needed the help a week ago! Infuriating! 🤬 #VoteThemAllOut
Is contempt of court even a consideration any longer? Congress could have used Trump hotel in DC for imprisonments pending subpoena compliance.
I am highly educated in business, traveled the world and lived in Saudi Arabia for four years. I am wealthy and both hubby and I took early retirement at 40. I think Trump is an incompetent, racist, corrupt, greedy Dotard. Plus as an independent voter I will be voting for Biden!

See, now you're getting into propaganda shit again.  There is no major war happening at the border (pan to a caravan the left COMPLETELY lied about). Crazy how that suddenly just went away. EVERYTHING TRUMP DOES IS MISDIRECTION. If there's something bad, he always deflects.

Joe Biden should refuse to debate Trump until he releases his tax returns. If you look at the polls Trump needs these debates more than Biden does. If Biden doesn’t debate Trump that’s arguably more harmful to Trump than Biden.

It's not about #TikTok. It's because it was developed in China, and #Trump is playing the race card to try to anger his base into outrage. He wants them to believe he's being tough on China. Oh, and that little rally in Tulsa that TikTok users torally punked.
I was a Republican before Trump. Seeing what the party has become, and how everyone so easily forfeited their integretiy for Trump, I see that the Republican party as it was when I was younger no longer exists.

This tells just how unhinged the Democratic Party has become. They’ll stand up Charles Manson and his followers (Bush and his acolytes) as representative of an honorable party with integrity. Why? Trump Derangement Syndrome.
These people have regained full credibility after helping lead this nation into a war we’re still mired in. Why? Trump Derangement Syndrome. These people have forfeited America’s future with the sinkhole they created in the Middle East, and still they’re favored ober progressives
This is what I call Trump Derangement Syndrome. Michelle Obama fondly hugs the guy who stole the WH in 2000 and started multiple illegal wars, not mention handing the governments treasury to his rich buddies. We have ex Bush officiados &amp; war mongering conservatives all over MSNBC
But hey, at least they were nice and polite as they royally fucked the American people. Not like the cruel, obnoxious Trump who passed the same policies, but is so personally toxic as a human being. THIS is the party of sociopaths Biden is so eager to work with.
According to Biden, Obama, and the Democratic establishment this is the GOP they want to return after Trump leaves. You know, that honorable party who was polite as they stole elections, started  illegal wars, and handed over government functions and tax revenue to big business.

So we don't have one member in the #Democratic party willing to tell us the briefing. What's the worse that can happen if they disclose it. This makes no sense that trump can classify things to help him and we are in the dark.
Plan. After trump wins, strike a deal with The entire pacific coast, including Mexico, supporting democratic secession from the union. They’ve floated the idea already. However, in doing so we could give Dems what they want, to include no wall. And they can live in shit together

Trump’s adminstration is the most corrupt in history. Just look at the number of indictments and convictions (and the head of crime family overturns them). He will say anything to divert attention from the pandemic he’s mismanaged.
Trump will win by a landslide and you will be looking for a new career.
I will go on the record again. Biden will not be on the ballot for President. He will be replaced, most likely he skips the debates...the Dems install someone after that doesn’t have to debate Trump.

Another great agency whose work also has protected us for decades until Trump decimated it is the EPA. The disasters their work avert is not as dramatic as the one in Beirut but probably even more devastating. Trump will destroy us all if we don’t remove him.

Trump was actually on the flight list in 1997...it shows it on the scans of the actual logs. Tom Hanks was not, so that kind of debunks the list you posted. How many more are wrong?
I don't deny Trump is horrible. I don't deny Joe is decent. But I do say that Bernie Sanders has the most heart &amp; compassion &amp; should have been the nominee. Lately the DNC is just a diet version of the RNC. Bernie is the reason we talk about $15/hr, MFA, free college &amp; green deal

The fact any state outside the reddest of the red has Trump behind in single digits should be alarming to Democrats, especially after 2016. But they’re so beholden to their corporate and wealthy donors they scared as hell to cross them.
Let me help you decode anyone calling themselves a swing voter, they support Trump but will no way in hell admit it. Which means the polls mean nothing, much like they didn’t in 2016. Democrats ignore this at their own peril.
Exactly. You mean like the polls that had Hillary overwhelmingly beating Trump. Now that was some great science there! Oh, that’s right, Russia!If Kanye West's name is on your ballot when you go into the booth this November and you cast your vote for him, you pretty much chose to re-elect President Trump.

I’m sure Trump and his handlers will be quick to tout this, but I bet most of these “new” jobs are not really new. They’re jobs people returned to. I’d love to see the actual new jobs that were created. I bet the numbers are in the low hundreds of thousands.

I don't know why Yang doesn't come right out and say "fuck yall, I'm running with or without your endorsement".  I *guarantee* if Yang was to debate Trump, which we know Biden plans to avoid, people would immediately realize Yang is the actual candidate. Sorry, DNC.
Trump is going to brag about bringing these USA jobs back, so I expect short term boost from him, but long term, a Biden victory with all the Green Deals, will make these investments explode. I think by 2030 , 50% of all vehicles will be electric.
That was better than Dukakis in a tank. Reminiscent of Kerry in a wet suit.  But the imagery here is good, it is appropriate for a man of his age and portrays him as both refined and in touch with America. Both things Trump can't do.
Lord I am watching Fox News.... but Trump is in Ohio and I have 2 huge Ohio Based SPEC stock investments that could explode if he even mentions them one little bit.
All that money should have went directly to taxpayers who would have had money to put into the economy! Americans could have sheltered in place and contained the virus so schools and businesses could safely reopen, but no Trump and corporate politicians had it their way as usual!

I think Pres Trump needs a geography lesson. I’ve seen THREE Trump ads in the last half hour. In Georgia, on MSNBC!!! No Trump potential voters in Georgia watch MSNBC. #gasoline
The DOJ gave her a bye. Meanwhile Richard Burr of NC was sold out bc he’s on the Senate Intelligence Committee and they are about to come out with their report on Trump. No coincidence.
Says who, you? Who said I didn’t serve? How bout Trump? How’s his service record? Funny how hypocritical your response is guaranteed to be. I’m glued to the edge of my seat waiting with bated breath for this one.
I’m saying I’m positive Trump won’t get re-elected and I’ll bet $1k. Will you?
Oh, I’m not defending Trump at all. He may be a bombastic with no scruples about what he says but I don’t question his cognitive ability. On the other hand, It is clear that Joe Biden is suffering from actual dementia or something truly diagnosable. Great choices, America👎🏼
Oh Come ON S. E.  He could pick a tin can and it would be better than Trump and Pence.  If you say differently, you are just looking for excuses to vote for Trump and absolve yourself from responsibility.  PFFFTTTT
That was better than Dukakis in a tank. Reminiscent of Kerry in a wet suit.  But the imagery here is good, it is appropriate for a man of his age and portrays him as both refined and in touch with America. Both things Trump can't do.
This. all of it. If Trump is your guy, screw.
Is he quoting John Lennon?  No religion?   Imagine there’s no Trump. It isn’t hard to do.
True! Some trumpers are hiding it! Everybody who wants Trump removed needs to go vote! Better yet, right now make sure people are applying for a mail-in ballot. The time for that is almost up. Help your parents, or your kids if they’re new to voting. We must not be complacent!!

The AG as recently as Wednesday posted online about her efforts to counter the Trump administration's actions on the census and abortion.
That’s too bad. She has a great story and I think she can handle Pence. And if Trump is trying to run as the law and order candidate, it seems like she’d be a great foil for his b.s. But, I’m a Never Trumper. I guess I’m out of touch with the base.

I don't care about earning your respect. I care about informing so when your house of cards topples and you repeat Trump's lies about "it not being fair or legal." The biggest political swing in our lifetimes is about to happen because more people than not know Trump is terrible.
Check this out: 83% of parents prefer online learning or hybrid learning over in-person schooling. Hard to imagine things getting better for Trump if he goes against that.
Most people have known for some time trump has to go.  Number one priority.

You sound like a Trump supporter. This is exactly the stance immigration hawks like Tucker Carlson and Anne Coulter have.
This is a click bait headline. As always, I suggest you read the article.    Second sentence:  "Overall, the poll found that 43 percent of voters would choose Biden in a present-day matchup whereas 40 would choose Trump.” BLOTUS is only ahead with midwestern, white, old, men.
She’s basically supporting everything Trump stands for. Build a country from within. Have national pride and love your country
Youre missing the point. Trump is like Poland &amp; Hungary &amp; wants to limit immigration &amp; just like Poland &amp; Hungary wants to build the nation within &amp; have the best quality of life for the inhabitants. You going to Poland are basically endorsing everything Trump supporters desire.
I cannot stand Trump but this is outrageous. The acquiescence of the entire Democrat establishment and, especially, the MSM is depressing. Where are the patriots?
BECAUSE I DO! I ain’t showing you unless you concede it to be true and do not attempt to discredit it. These are MY emails with execs at Fox News. I have 4 of them. I know your tactics all too well. For instance, tell me the last negative Trump story that wasn’t fake news.
What you are witnessing is called "scapegoating."  I'll help you with the definition.  President Trump has failed so badly with managing the Coronavirus, that he is trying to rename it the China Virus so that people will blame China and not him.  Thankfully, most get that.
Yes, I'm aware that the Pres. calls the virus the Chinese Virus, but that is not the virus' name. No one else in the world calls it that. It's name is Coronavirus.  One could call it Trump virus for it killing 154k Americans on his watch I guess?   I still prefer the real name.
Different county, different school &amp; another child (first grader) diagnosed with Covid day 3.  trump has no clue how to lead. He  cares about himself &amp; doesn’t care schools don’t have the means to open safely. He has no plan to help &amp; won’t! I have no kids in school but I’m angry

trump wants all schools opened &amp; ONE county in GA had 260 employees in this ONE district infected/exposed to Covid-19. All his supporters thinks he cares but clearly trump does NOT care. Should have sent $ to help schools. He doesn’t have a plan for anything ever. He has to go!
Removed tweet. Thanks Twitter!This man lies to America every darn day &amp; his platform to speak was finally stopped this one time.  I wish they would do it all the time since he’s always breaking the law.  trump still has not said anything to the families about our soldiers!
Well my ability to prognosticat is not very good. You think Trump is terrible. Do you honestly believe Biden the dementia patient is better? You're not punishing the GOP if you would vote for Pence.  Do think Biden won't resign? You have to be voting for his VP, or not at all.
This is a great video that will fall on deaf ears to those that need to see it. Trump is purely a con man and all his actions have been to enrich himself. But his supporters don't care and don't realize they have also been conned.

Please let this be something about Trump's criminal activities
Joe Biden should refuse to debate Trump until he releases his tax returns. If you look at the polls Trump needs these debates more than Biden does. If Biden doesn’t debate Trump that’s arguably more harmful to Trump than Biden.
trump always says he will do something in “two weeks” and yet nothing ever happens.  Not only is trump illiterate but he cannot even tell time or keep from telling lies which he’s done over 42 thousand times.  Tiny children don’t lie that much.

Dear hypocrit, please stop. Trump is going down and he HAS to. He's killing people with his stupidity and you're too brainwashed to see that. EVERYTHING he does/says is TOXIC.
This is my point Joseph, only right media is telling you this.   Think about this in terms of common sense, okay? Be objective for a minute. In what world can you record rioting footage of your own America (Trump's) and then use that footage saying it would be Biden's America?

Trump voters, my friend. The polls though
"Let's see if all" is improper/fragemented grammar. Loved Trump's softball-question laden Fox &amp; Proven Liars interview this morning that he COMPLETELY whiffed on. "Hey folks, if you thought it couldn't get any worse for Trump after the Chris Wallace interview, I give you AXIOS!"
And yet STILL Trump is the worst president, by far. At least 120k deaths he's now responsible for, solely. Stupidity does not an excuse make.

Good. I’m sure he spoke with trump to get clarification on the virtues of morality.
I do wish Trump has a better grasp on the facts. Goddam it seems like he just reads what is in front of him and has no real connection to it. But, at least he can read and think in semi-complete sentences. Even if they often make no sense.
Because I’m still an American dumbass.  And no, it’s been closed ever since the left and China destroyed the global economy trying to get rid of Trump by releasing a virus and sending around the world before telling anyone.

God miller. Trump used “everybody saying” people are telling me” I’ve heard from lots of people” many people agree with me”.   All the while lying.  Trump has no scruples.
This question is indicative of the frustration with the way the virus is being politicized here. Dems and the press are bludgeoning Trump with it, some valid points. We are treated to daily body counts and pontificating about how may more. If Biden wins the reporting will change.

Trump wants a payroll tax cut in the next stimulus package. It’s a bad idea.  The White House is pressing for cuts to the Social Security and Medicare payroll tax — but it won’t help the people who need it most and would be a nightmare to administer.

Oh, I’m not defending Trump at all. He may be a bombastic with no scruples about what he says but I don’t question his cognitive ability. On the other hand, It is clear that Joe Biden is suffering from actual dementia or something truly diagnosable. Great choices, America👎🏼
Trump used the cages far more than Obama, Trumps family has racked in 10’s of millions while being public servants and his policing initiative has literally done nothing to curb any police brutality
Donald Trump has never shown up to a congressional hearing as he would lie and commit an act of perjury if put under oath.   He’s not only a clown, but an embarrassment
you know, Tony Alpert in Battlefield Hardline was very literal about his second amendment rights, I have a bad feeling that some of Trump’s white nationalist followers are just as literal about their second amendment rights as Alpert!
That was better than Dukakis in a tank. Reminiscent of Kerry in a wet suit.  But the imagery here is good, it is appropriate for a man of his age and portrays him as both refined and in touch with America. Both things Trump can't do.
All that money should have went directly to taxpayers who would have had money to put into the economy! Americans could have sheltered in place and contained the virus so schools and businesses could safely reopen, but no Trump and corporate politicians had it their way as usual!

Trump's base didn't beat HIllary; it was the apathy of the Bernie fans and the undecideds fooled by Comey's letter into thinking her emails were a big deal.
Trump's base doesn't matter. They're 30-35 percent of voters and can't be persuaded. The other 60-65 percent are gonna steamroll his ass.

You sound like a Trump supporter. This is exactly the stance immigration hawks like Tucker Carlson and Anne Coulter have.
She’s basically supporting everything Trump stands for. Build a country from within. Have national pride and love your country
Youre missing the point. Trump is like Poland &amp; Hungary &amp; wants to limit immigration &amp; just like Poland &amp; Hungary wants to build the nation within &amp; have the best quality of life for the inhabitants. You going to Poland are basically endorsing everything Trump supporters desire.

I think Bernie could win. Trump has enough negatives. At least Bernie is coherent. Seriously, if you are trying to decide between not voting or voting for Biden I think that decision would be easier with Bernie. And really Bernie isn't a Democrat, so they would push back on him.

Good. I’m sure he spoke with trump to get clarification on the virtues of morality.
Because I’m still an American dumbass.  And no, it’s been closed ever since the left and China destroyed the global economy trying to get rid of Trump by releasing a virus and sending around the world before telling anyone.
The China Virus will continue in other countries and the Democrats and the countries that conspired to spread this virus to bring down trump they do not care.
161000 dead americans.. Yep, trump is fantastic 👏 👌 😀 👍
This question is indicative of the frustration with the way the virus is being politicized here. Dems and the press are bludgeoning Trump with it, some valid points. We are treated to daily body counts and pontificating about how may more. If Biden wins the reporting will change.

Big news!!!!! mr deplorable unethical trump is going to lose the election and we can hardly wait.Absolutely not I think both candidates are horse shit. I think it’s a joke either made it. However I do think trumps better and I will be voting for jojo until I have to vote for trump.
Same reason Trump wants the 100% M&amp;E deduction as the bill is seen as must-pass and so anything that they can sneak in, now's the time, whether or not it has anything to do with COVID-19. Especially since Trump's veto threat is empty; he can't afford to be obviously the killer.
Trump's understanding of conservatism is basically just enough to do Rush Limbaugh's (or Tucker Carlson's or Sean Hannity's) act on steroids, without much underlying understanding of the conservative/GOP policy priorities needed to inform those acts.
IMHO: Dems need to give up on getting back the full SALT deduction no matter how much their donor class wants it back, and the GOP needs to cave on state &amp; local assistance—make it a no-interest loan so it scores as zero net spending.
I pray this will backfire on them. Trump has destroyed so many lives. I pray people are paying attention this time around.
“Captivating”, so you are trying to help Trump in his re-election. I am praying to God that this doesn’t work this time. Most people assumed Clinton would win last time without their vote. Voting for Trump was a joke. They won’t make that mistake again!

Trump was asking a question in lieu of the fraudulent mail-in voting that has taken place in NY.  Only Congress can delay the election and he knows that.  Would you rather have an honest election or one that we know will be fraudulent? That is the question he is really asking.
Boy you can’t tell the Trump thumpers that’s...it’s crazy how delusional people can be when it means you get to say nigger
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is for the first time floating a “delay” to the Nov. 3 presidential election, as he makes unsubstantiated allegations that increased mail-in voting will result in fraud.
This is how we get a dictator right fucking here. He knows he might lose, and he doesn’t want to take that chance. Idc if you supported Trump earlier this morning, you have to see the danger of this statement and at the very least reconsider. This is bigger than any party.
Trump will win. Republicans will retake the house, hold the senate. In a landslide. Because this shit is supported by democrats. And we see you.
If one of my grandchildren get covid because Brian Kemp and Donald Trump forced schools to reopen, I will do everything I can to see that they pay for the pain and death they have caused to our children. That is a promise.
Don’t say Post Trump above a whisper! 🤞
Biden was my next to last choice in the primary. I believe that, due to our electoral college system, only a binary choice is possible. Future elections and a needed national mask mandate can only happen if Trump is defeated. Voting for Biden is my last hope and yours too.
Biden could never kill nearly 170000 Americans.

I still think had it not been Biden, Kamala would have been the consensus. She was the most qualified outside of Warren.
The lefties who wanna VBNMW won’t actually do anything to help Biden get ellected they just wanna shame people who will do otherwise because it feeds into their superiority in the “discourse.” An impotent thing when your most signifigant political action is voting.
He just endorsed Biden/Harris.
Fight in brothers. It’s just a warm up if Biden wins which would be a cold day in hell. But if the libs find a way to cheat there will be civil war in this country like you never seen. Then tell me who is going to get the best down not the right.
No the left are the raciest ones. Biden I will only pick a African American woman. That’s discrimination and Harris is descendent of slave owners all facts. So you tell me who the raciest are and hypocrites.
Biden-Harris biggest fraud in history Biden broke the Equal Pay Act of 1963 Saying he pick a African American woman. Discrimination! Harris is not African American. Harris is a descendent of a family who owned 86 slaves. Who are the Raciest &amp; Hypocrites? Report the truth
If he loses, he will be escorted out of the White House by the USSS on the moment Biden is sworn in.
Never thought he'd endorse Biden
He's obviously voting for Biden then
Where are Pelosi and Schumer? Have they decided to let Biden handle all responsibility for dissent?

Obama knew of Biden’s worthlessness for 8 years. Exactly why he orchestrated Biden’s nomination. Needed to have a firm grasp on the puppet’s strings.
Biden will get far better ratings.
Biden campaign is hiding because they have something to hide.
Joe Biden puts mask mandate in national spotlight  #TravInsAgt #AgtTravelers
Just like Biden did in Ukraine getting the prosecutor fired there doing his quid pro quo he will do the same here. There is no doubt Biden is as dirty as Hussian Obama.  His in China’s back pocket getting paid millions of dollars.
I loved your #MAGA hat! You looked wonderful Red is definitely your color! It's so great 2 c u on Hannity with Larry Elder! Makes my heart sing 2 have such a prestigious gentleman support  &amp; tell all the good he has done &amp; tell the racism of Biden &amp;negative record of Harris
Don't be surprised if that is exactly when shootings will start, esp if Trump claims the Biden victory was illegitimate.  I also wouldn't be shocked if something happened before the election which precipitates Trump calling for martial law.  I say the future is unpredictable.
So think of it this way. Biden Harris win. And gop wins house. Kevin McCarthy is now speaker. Biden “dies” and Harris becomes president. Kevin does not become Vice President. Harris gets to choose her VP. Which is a highly unlikely scenario.
I know this is from May 2020 but... Seems kinda odd...and convenient...and scary af. So, is how Harris/Biden can b polling ahead of  even tho VP Biden refuses to answer even 1 simple question? Seems like a way to interfere in &amp; steal an election🤔😳

Deane Bonner has been recovering from an attack of vertigo over the last couple of weeks. When the former head of the Cobb NAACP heard the news that Joe Biden asked Kamala Harris to be his running mate, she felt a jolt.
Fucker never made it here before he went the knee again. I would have chosen, him or Tulsi or yang. Trump is my fourth pick. Staying home is my 5th. Biden was never gonna get it from me.
The first domino has fallen. Of course, he’ll end up as a highly paid CNN legal analyst. And if Biden wins, the investigation will end.

What do Biden, Pelosi, Schumer, Feinstein, and Facebook all have in common?  OWNED by CHINA!!

One silver lining if Biden wins, I’ll finally be able to talk shit about the president with my parents.
Fact check: Trump promotes another birther lie, this time about Kamala Harris
It's too bad for you Obama isn't the one running against Trump. Joe Biden is. He has 8.3 million followers. 78 million less than Trump. Bahaha!
If you’re going to go do hard against mail-in voting, you need to vote in person. That’s my opinion on the matter.  I honestly don’t care what Obama or Biden did or didn’t do lol
President Trump talks with the media more then any other President ever. Biden comes out to accuse Trump for all kinds of things makes all kinds statements &amp; accusations talks like he is some kind of leader then walks away from the Mike without taking even one softball question.
We know Biden did not pick Harris for her political skills she has non. He picked her to be his Pit Bull attack dog. He knew she attack lie make stuff up about Trump &amp; basically be ruthlessl towards him. She is there to do nothing but attack him &amp; lie 24/7 along with the media.
Tucker Carlson revealed the scariest truth about Joe Biden selecting Kamala Harris as his VP  via

You don’t have to be crazy about him.  Ask yourself if you want 4 more years of trump and then happily vote for Biden.
Trump is blamed for everything so if that rapist Joe Biden (someone that is the reason for mass incarceration of black people) wins I will blame him for everything. If the Braves lose. If my dog dies. If I break a bone.
Did Mike Pence just say that he’s going to beat Biden’s meat??
First Biden does not know what day it is. Harris is about the biggest hypocrite there is.  Biden probably does not even know who his running mate is. If he was asked a question he probably answer a question from two days ago &amp; Harris will just make up a pure lie.
Their tactic is to lie and smear and just make up total BS about Trump and his White House then duck and run.  Like the Taliban they make a surprise ambush then run away. Well that’s what Biden &amp; Harris are doing.
What do you expect the Dems lie about everything along with the left wing media.  Now Biden and Harris are on a totally lying smear campaign.  But they won’t take even softball question from the media.

You’d think she’d put her country over her party. She knows Joe Biden well and knows that he’d be an outstanding President. She also knows that her father would have already endorsed him and would have likely been his Secretary of Defense.
I'll take a chance on the USPS. Images of the mailbag scene from Christmas on 34th St, all for Biden/Harris.
the fact that some people are choosing to not vote over both trump and Biden doesn’t sit right with me
Wow. Such desperation from the Biden camp.
She is a big part of their plans. What I see is Biden gets elected and takes demands from Nancy then he has to step down because of health problems Kamala takes over and appointments Nancy as VP then somehow Nancy takes over and then you have hell on earth.

Personally I am thrilled that the ticket is Biden and Harris. Not that I would want them to win and not that I think that ticket can’t or won’t win, but considering we very well could have been looking at Sanders/Abrams or something like that I think we’ve dodged a bullet.
And Biden mispronounced his running mate’s name. 🤔 But then, maybe it was victory for him to even remember it.
Trump on Biden-Harris:  “They don't want to have cows, they don't want to have any form of animals."  Trump is confusing Biden-Harris for Bart Simpson.

Team Biden and Kamala let’s make history
I have an 8 &amp; 11 yr old girl. It doesn't take Kamala running for VP to make them feel strong and confident. I have raised them to know how capable they are. Kamala is not a good example. &amp; Biden definitely isn't.
Congratulations on your primary Keep up the good work Be strong &amp; tell America that the marxist left led by Biden/Harris (Obama etal r )in there too-gross!) r on a mission 2 destroy America &amp; our freedoms &amp; turn it into a commie nightmare where they have all power&amp; we r slaves!!
You are Dem operative and everyone knows it. To ever say you are a conservative is just a joke. You know Biden will be humiliated on debate stage
I don't think you people actually understand our rigged ass voting system.  Votes against Biden/Harris AND Trump won't have electorate pull.  Then what? He fucks us to death?  If you really wanted someone else, the work to be done was the last years - in a still frigged system 💩

Since the democrats feel Obama and Biden didn’t spy on Trump, why not have Trumps DOJ and FBI and CIA start doing it to Biden. 🤷🏻‍♂️

Biden, because he overall has less to say; she never shuts up
I will add I don't expect schools to stay shut down forever.  I just expect them to open and operate safely for all.  Based on verifiable photos we've seen from the past week, I think it's safe to say these schools have many improvements to make.
Anyone with sense would be upset at someone attempting to down play the potential spread from kids to adults.  Especially when it happened to them.  If your ACTUAL argument is there is such a small chance that it doesn't worth shut downs, ok.  But the possibility IS there.
Now if you have some proof to disprove my Covid results or otherwise, I’m all ears. Otherwise, I’d suggest taking some classes on how to hold a civil discussion instead of utilizing ones profile description to get out of a conversation.
If you took just another minute to click that twitch link, you’d see videos clear as day with my face.   I’m not one of these bots you been dealing with, I have receipts. Do the math yourself if you need to verify my comments about just getting over Covid. Let’s stay on topic.
The COVID result, the fact that I got it from a kid playing organized sports, or both?
I just honestly want to know how Biden got the nomination lol. Like, I honestly want to know how democrats could look at their candidates, and go for him. Like sure, he was Obama’s VP, and everyone loved Obama, but that was 11 years ago. Times have changed
Go to Antifa website and it takes you right to Joe Biden’s campaign. So it shows Biden supports Antifa and BLM outside of being a Racies. I thought this was Anerica and his pick was going to be a Black Female. If Trump said that the media would go berserk.
So.... are you saying you’re not voting for Biden?
Biden did the most raciest thing he could possibly do. In this country we pick people based on experience not race. But Biden picked a VP based on Gender and  color. So he said he would pick a woman of color. So it just shows he is a bigger raciest then thought.
The designation of who is fash is meaningless, it’s a bullshit term that gets thrown around to much. Also Biden’s been trying to and had bragged about cutting social security for ages. They’re not different. There’s a market reason the libs wanna cut it.
I just got over a stint with COVID. I can confirm children do have a high enough “viral load” to infect others because that’s how we got it.
I am not sure what they are doing, but I suspect they are trying to maneuver for the House and the Senate and trying to make us look away with the obvious clown show of biden/harris

Looking forward to the day when the Biden administrations AG subpoenas you for the criminal investigation of Trump that you most likely participated in.
Just watched the wonderful Biden/Harris acceptance speech. He was like our proverbial father figure and she was the favored first child. I am so happy to see intelligence, grace and reverence displayed. Thanks Joe Biden for offering Kamala Harris the position as Vice President.
You mean , “cam-a-la” as Biden says and not Kam-a-la lol
please call Biden-Hair Ass out on their lies. Biden speech today is despicable. Can’t let them win. Please remind people she is not Afro American
Katie people listening to Biden right now are screaming at their screens. Don’t let them get away with the lies they are spreading.
Im not a republican but my parents are. They live in Pennsylvania and theyre voting for Biden time. How he handled Covid is the reason why. They’re older so they’re higher risk and they dont feel like Trump is taking it seriously.
A perspective by the  (National Shooting Sports Foundation) on Kamala Harris and gun control.
Biden can’t do it. Body and mind won’t allow it.
Don’t fall for it!!! Don’t let him draw support from Biden. We must be unified to defeat Trump.
Biden and Harris will most likely win (as long as Biden remains out of the public eye). Harris will replace him pretty early on and run for re-election in 2024. We won't have a chance to address the real issues until 2028 but by then things will likely be too late.
Kamala is running along side KKK Supporting Joe Biden. What an inclusive ticket the Democrats have arranged.

Kamala as Biden's VP pick?  What do you suppose she was thinking??
No they wont be.  Theyre sick of being trapped in the house because of your mismanagement of Covid.  They want out of the house and that means voting for Biden.
Joe Biden didn't pick anyone, he was picking his nose when the Deep State chose Heels Up Harris
Honestly doesn't matter...Joe can debate or not...you can have Kamala or not...BIDEN WILL NOT EVER WIN!!!
Think I’m gonna skip this years presidential election, tired of choosing the lesser of two evils! I hate Kamala Harris and I hate Trump, Biden is just a dumbass in the way
Imagine talking shit about Trump but ACTUALLY thinking Joe Biden is going to do a better job :( Imma just sit this one out.
IF YALL WANT TO VOTE FOR TRUMP THAT IS ALL YOU GOT TO SAY. Don’t hide under “anti-Biden”.
You sound scared.... #placeholderjoe never planned on debate. Joe isn’t even campaigning.  He read from a script while taking to Kamala. We see Biden. He’s a big boy running for President- Time to step out in front of Americans and earn the vote. Dems planning #chaos
Dream on. It’s ok we know Biden doesn’t want to come out to play. #basementpresidentialdebates2020
Because Biden was gonna dunno matter what
Anybody believe Biden had anything to do with the selection?
Post a couple Pro Biden Tweets, you should be fine.
Hold up, both of you. The "I would veto m4a" line is worthy of criticism because to VETO it means it already got THROUGH congress. That would be trashing a big win. Biden remains a better option than Trump. It's colossally stupid for him to threaten veto on prog legislation tho!
Yeah, because those  ratings are through the roof. Biden does online town halls and gets 19 viewers. Unless  gives a press conference detailing her rise to the top - Willie Brown - no one would watch.
Kamala Harris is the First Indian American to be selected to run for President after she gets rid of Mindless Joe Biden!!! And I thought they said they were going to nominate a Black Woman. Oh well, four more years...…...

Well that was quick!  Bypassed by Biden, Abrams likely to focus on 2022 rematch against Kemp
And now CNN is setting the stage to admit that Biden isn't fit for office in February. They'll begin pushing for him to step aside then.
Kamala Harris also laughed about separating children from their parents in prison. Her and Joe Biden want to take away AR-15s away from the American people.  already exposed this woman on the debate stage. How do people celebrate her.
Congratulations!!!   I am so happy, words cannot express my feelings !! A Biden / Harris ticket is phenomenal!! The two of you are the dynamic duo of hope!!!! I can’t wait to go out and vote for the both of you!!
Fairly powerless VP? Have you seen Joe Biden? I don't give him a year before he's removed from office under the 25th. She will end up President if they win.  Better she be neither.
Really doesn't matter who Biden picked...
sure ain’t learn about biden’s crime bill in school. not surprised.. bc i ain’t kno bout none of this.
was biden my first pick? no. am i thrilled with him picking harris? no. will i vote for them because doing anything else will result in 4 more years of trump? yes i absolutely will bc i refuse to let my frustrations with the ticket get us 4 more years of corruption and hatred.

The suspense is over. Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden announced on Tuesday afternoon that Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) is his vice presidential running mate.
This GOP line doesn't seem to stick on Biden or Harris....for gods sake woman - Harris was an Prosecutor / Attorney General - her policy - prosecutor record are center right. She backed MFA in primary and Joe wants ACA. COME ON LOL

i agree...after his next term. Look at facts, how many peace treaties did Biden/Obama do? Prison reform? Cutting medication pricing(very big for my family)? tax cuts? The economy would be crazy big right now if it wasn't for COVID.
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS PICKED A STRONG WOMAN THAT HAS HIS BACK, HAVE THE AMERICA PEOPLE BACKS NO MATTER WHAT RACE THEY ARE!!  SENATORS HARRIS YOU WILL HELP VP BIDEN BRING AMERICA OUT OF HELLLLLLLLLLLL WHERE TRUMP AND HIS CURRUPT ENABLERS HAS PUT US!!! MAY GOD BLESS YOU SISTER!!
If we had an honest media Biden would be polling at about 30% or less. Only the far left extremist would be supporting him.
SISTER HARRIS YOUR MOTHER LIVES IN YOUR HEART,SHE'S ALWAYS WITH YOU &amp; PROTECTING YOU!!!! SHE IS VERY PROUD OF YOU AS I AM!! DON'T LET ANYONE DICTATE TO YOU WHAT YOU CAN AND CAN'T DO!! YOU ARE A CHILD OF GOD!! YOU ARE STRONG, BRILLIANT!! YOU WILL HELP BRO. BIDEN WIN THIS ELECTION
didnt Biden screw it up worse? And he is supposed to be her partner.
this is a nuanced and divisive issue and ppl are making good points on why you should or should not vote for the biden/harris ticket. but this thread is very relevant.
I mean, at least Biden is going after swing states. Hillary couldn't be assed to speak to the plebs, as there were rich donors to talk to.
Is it really easy? Tucker is easy. Commala is a bit more of a challenge. But don't throw shade when biden can't do it correctly.  Plus I bet a dollar biden screws it again.
Leaders in the Chattahoochee Valley are reacting to the news of former Vice President Joe Biden announcing Senator Kamala Harris as his vice presidential running mate.

The great part is that Joe Biden is inheriting a built in cabinet of the most capeable people in US government.
My family did not own slaves. I did not lock up pot smokers (minorities)then brag about smoking dope. I cannot list all the racist things that biden said. Do you need help with that?
I agree it’s best Biden ad going
Let’s do this! BIDEN/HARRIS

How about biden. Let him ramble a bit.

TUNE IN YALL PLEASE!!!!!! THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION    Joe Biden and Kamala Harris introduce their presidential ticket in Delaware
Biden is counting on folks like you who are ill informed. Please dig deeper for the truth. I know it is difficult to find because the MSM is biased. The democrat party wants to send the innocent preborn to death and that is horrific.
Lee also trots out the socialist straw man but Biden and most Democrats are not socialists. If they were, Biden would not be the nominee.

Within minutes of the presumptive Democratic nominee's announcement Tuesday, false information was circulating on social media, claiming that Harris had called Biden a "racist" and that she is not eligible to be president.
BIDEN WILL NOT MAKE IT FOR THE NEXT 4 YEARS!!😱 HE'S ALREADY HAD A BRAIN STROKE! LOOK IN HIS EYES!
...the fact we have to pick between two different scum bags should say enough about the current state of our nation. A lot of people are supporting Biden just so Trump isn’t the president anymore, and I the homophobic and racist isn’t from the actual person but their policies.
Wow cannot believe Im about to have to block so many WHITE people for immediately being pieces of shit after Kamala was picked as the VP. Im all in for the Biden/Harris ticket
I mean, that’s a big reason why I personally don’t like Biden. So to say that the reasons he’s “demonized” are not based in truth is very shortsighted and letting your bias cloud your judgement. There are many legit reasons to dislike Biden, just like trump. More so for Trump tho
She’s so nasty, damn good choice. Until she dropped out she was getting this 69 year old southern white boys vote. I’m damned proud Joe picked her. Great choice!!!! She could be President and It shows Biden’s good judgement.
know Joe Biden ad sierra club.
Are you crazy.  He was not the one to get sued for housing discrimination you and your father were!!!! enough said . joe biden black voter not you!!!!!!
I am not trying to justify anything for Trump. I was however pointing out the hypocrisy of the original post of the media clipping parts of Biden's videos and using them out of context being wrong but the same is done to Trump and there is nothing wrong with that.
I applaud Shaun King for supporting Biden and Harris. Putting aside your personal feelings for the greater good (Defeating Trump) is what we all need.
From the start, some Biden advisers saw Harris as a logical choice. She was among the party's most popular figures, a deft debater and a fundraising juggernaut.
She’s going to bat for the idea that women are capable and qualified, not necessarily for Biden.
No centrist would want Biden or Trump. Honestly both are just serving their corporate donors and not the people.
I'll vote for trump or not at all tbh. I was grudgingly voting for Biden after he was picked by the DNC (not the american people) to be the nominee. Now Harris was only wanted by Wall Street, not voters.   Its shameful to think Biden will be any different from Trump as president.

Bernie lost the progressive vote as soon as he bent the knee for Biden and gave up everything he stood for.
Sadly they know that progressives will grudgingly vote Biden so they chose Harris specifically as a slap in the face to progressive views instead of shoring up the vote. They already know their eggs are in one basket and want to stomp out all the resistance to their corruption
Honestly if you are a progressive, neither Biden nor Trump will give you anything that you want and they want you to lose hope.
is very much against the people. The Kamala pick was also just another slap in the face to any progressive who tries to convince themselves that Biden is even a little bit forward thinking with the likes of Warren or Sanders whispering in his ear.
Thoughts on Kamala VP Pick: Biden is absolutely just a figure head with no real policies that he has other than whatever Wall street tells him to do. So with Kamala being his VP, her policy will ultimately dictate his. She has a shitty history from when she was a prosecutor &amp; 1/2
He certainly is not Christlike. I think Biden is Christlike.
Kamala Harris, congratulations but how are you voting on take our guns away when blacks are killing blacks,#1 crime in America always to this day. You and Biden are a joke,leave our country and know what opressions about,from a white God Fearing loving man that despises you
Look, don’t vote for Biden just because you hate Trump. Biden is senile and is as corrupt as they come. Also don’t get me started in Kamala Harris. What I’m trying to get at is just vote for Jo if you hate Trump.
Congrats on becoming Biden's running partner. #KamalaHarrisForVP
After reflection and a quick informal social media review concerning Biden's choice of Kamala Harris, I have determined that people who weren't going to vote for Biden still aren't and people who supported Biden still do.
So tell me Rick, you voting for Biden this year? Really? You are going to support a candidate who believes its ok to murder babies in the womb?

Mama doesn’t like Pence being alone with women, so Biden can chaperone.
Not crazy about her but then I don't like anyone.  She was the obvious pick when Biden said he would pick a minority woman. Her primary performance was underwhelming, she won't add her state to Biden column, but she will help secure black voters and progressives.
Congratulations President Trump™ on Candidate Joe Biden's© naming of Kamala Harris® as V.P. pick.
He legit thinks they just named Kamala from the 80s WWF as Biden's VP.  Also, apropos of nothing, my phone tried to change Biden to Vixen, so I think my phone is drunk.
I’m excited for Kamala Harris. Biden is still CREEPY AF but I’ll take my chance with him.
That's exactly what the debate will be like...Biden will be given the questions and his staff will put the answers on cue cards!!!
Ronna, I truly don't believe Biden could make it for 4 years!! I'm serious!

Seriously tho, Kamala Harris? The woman that has made a fucking fortune on the false imprisonments of minorities? The woman that has “backed the blue” since it was a “stance”. This is who everyone is proud of Joe Biden for picking? YGMFU.

Have you heard the way Biden talks about children?
The more we talk the more I think you’re just here to push people away from Biden and towards Trump
Yeah well no he doesn’t shows your lack of research
Biden lost the candidacy in 2016 to a person who then lost to Trump its hugely egotistical of him for un and steal votes from Jo. You see how that logic works out?
1. She gets into the debates and destroys Trump and Biden and wins in a landslide
How have I shown this by not voting for Biden?
I’m not trying to rationalize anything I think you’re mad because there’s a candidate better than Biden
Biden and Trump are and I support neither
No you’re right but continuing corporate subsidies, continuing the war in the Middle East, gun control, continuing the war on drugs, continuing the militarization of the police and many other things are impossible enough for me to not vote for Biden or Trump
Mathematically she can though she’s on enough ballots to hit 270 so let’s get her on the debate stage then Trump and Biden can prove why they are the better candidate
You keep saying that but ya know I just don’t believe it maybe you should keep repeating it over and over instead of providing a reason for me to vote for Biden other than he’s not Trump
I wouldn’t vote for Biden anyways I’m not siphoning votes from anyone and if you believe I am then you’re admitting that Jo’s policies are better than Biden’s but #BlueNoMatterWho ammiright
I am not comparing Trump to Biden. I am stating that the politicians that make the laws are the ones to blame since they promise the same thing every two and four years and never deliver what they promise. They were doing it before Trump and it will continue after
And it’s not supporting trump because Biden and nobody else is entitled to your vote
I like to hear your plan on this Pandemic not some babble about Joe Biden.
YES!!! Russia is responsible for all the Trump signs and flags I see everywhere!!  And they must be the ones taking down all of the Biden signs!! because I haven’t seen ANY!!

Ah, so it’s the Russians putting out all of those Trump signs in yards and all of the Trump flags I see everywhere AND it must be the Russians organizing all of the Trump flotillas everywhere AND that would explain why I have seen 0 Biden anything anywhere!! THE RUSSIANS!!!!

I still think had it not been Biden, Kamala would have been the consensus. She was the most qualified outside of Warren.
A Biden presidency would be much more like a despot than the allegatations from the Left that Trump is. Biden is his ticket now, and not a single press conference this week has he taken questions. Contrast that with Trump, who if anything, is too accessible and transparent!
5.  I do believe this actually is a devious plan for them. Get supposed “moderate” Biden to fool everybody, he then wins, and drops out a year later and there is your President Harris. You all better turn out to vote for Trump, and better convince your family, friends etc too!
3. Then in 16, again the Super Delegates swayed to Hillary over Bernie...now in 20, they knew Bernie would once again lock it up, so they once again did the establiahment’s bidding and got Pocahontas to split the Bernie vote to destroy him and get Biden the senile in
2. (Contd) to nominate their candidate. Bernie would’ve gotten the nomination again, but the old guard called up everybody to get behind Biden. There is nothing “Democratic” about the “Democratic Party”. Think about it..in 08 the Super Delegates swayed to Obama from Hillary....
Thread: Even  ‘s Chris Wallace, a Democrat, is getting mad that Biden refuses to go on the hot seat as Trump always does. There is no more hiding him, Biden is a senile old man that has zero business running for President. Once again, the Dems rigged their process

Just like Biden did in Ukraine getting the prosecutor fired there doing his quid pro quo he will do the same here. There is no doubt Biden is as dirty as Hussian Obama.  His in China’s back pocket getting paid millions of dollars.
So think of it this way. Biden Harris win. And gop wins house. Kevin McCarthy is now speaker. Biden “dies” and Harris becomes president. Kevin does not become Vice President. Harris gets to choose her VP. Which is a highly unlikely scenario.
I know this is from May 2020 but... Seems kinda odd...and convenient...and scary af. So, is how Harris/Biden can b polling ahead of  even tho VP Biden refuses to answer even 1 simple question? Seems like a way to interfere in &amp; steal an election🤔😳

love u your tweets movies I thought of good tag for Biden n Harris  Joe n Hoe
We know Biden did not pick Harris for her political skills she has non. He picked her to be his Pit Bull attack dog. He knew she attack lie make stuff up about Trump &amp; basically be ruthlessl towards him. She is there to do nothing but attack him &amp; lie 24/7 along with the media.

Did Mike Pence just say that he’s going to beat Biden’s meat??
First Biden does not know what day it is. Harris is about the biggest hypocrite there is.  Biden probably does not even know who his running mate is. If he was asked a question he probably answer a question from two days ago &amp; Harris will just make up a pure lie.
Their tactic is to lie and smear and just make up total BS about Trump and his White House then duck and run.  Like the Taliban they make a surprise ambush then run away. Well that’s what Biden &amp; Harris are doing.
What do you expect the Dems lie about everything along with the left wing media.  Now Biden and Harris are on a totally lying smear campaign.  But they won’t take even softball question from the media.

Personally I am thrilled that the ticket is Biden and Harris. Not that I would want them to win and not that I think that ticket can’t or won’t win, but considering we very well could have been looking at Sanders/Abrams or something like that I think we’ve dodged a bullet.
And Biden mispronounced his running mate’s name. 🤔 But then, maybe it was victory for him to even remember it.
We must defeat 45.  Biden/Harris will restore dignity to America.  Vote and let’s take our country back.
Trump on Biden-Harris:  “They don't want to have cows, they don't want to have any form of animals."  Trump is confusing Biden-Harris for Bart Simpson.
when it come this presidential election wanna be with yall but the differences between a biden platform and a trump one are significant enough for me to show up. if we get a plan to just deplatform the executive branch by november ill be there in a heartbeat, tho
I”ve been calling Fauci “Herr Fauci” for his intoxicity on unelected power he’s been given by the media and Democrats...but now we have to add  to be addressed as well as “Herr Biden” since he wants to be the mask police apparently if he wins with a national mandate
Those of you who know me, know I am in favor of VOLUNTARY mask use (and or in a case where a PRIVATE business requires it such as airlines). To do a federal mandate on this is police state facism. If Biden wins, here comes the mask GESTAPO
Biden would get rid of cows? I know who Devin Nunes is voting for!
POV you’re 8 years old and you’re in the same Dairy Queen as Joe Biden
Hey  you are a FAKE CONSERVATIVE...we know it now more than ever. You simply have cashed-in by acting like you are an “outraged” conservative...but you sold your soul to the Left. There is no way you can’t think America would’ve been better off with Hillary or Biden
Joe Biden says there have been three defining moments in his life:  1. Running for President. 2. Picking a VP. 3. "You know the thing". 😂🤣

Flipped on my Facebook account for a min, trumpeters now talking about Biden and Harris wearing black masks, suggesting a secret message to antica or their so called fantasy people they made up to fit the story.
What is Jeanine Pirro saying? Why would she say something so cruel, regarding Biden?  Why does she have a platform anywhere?
Did you forget about Tara Reade or Kamala's affair with Willie Brown. What about Hunter Biden? How about all the photos &amp; videos of JB getting handsy with little girls? 🤔
Team Biden and Kamala let’s make history
I have an 8 &amp; 11 yr old girl. It doesn't take Kamala running for VP to make them feel strong and confident. I have raised them to know how capable they are. Kamala is not a good example. &amp; Biden definitely isn't.
You are Dem operative and everyone knows it. To ever say you are a conservative is just a joke. You know Biden will be humiliated on debate stage
I don't think you people actually understand our rigged ass voting system.  Votes against Biden/Harris AND Trump won't have electorate pull.  Then what? He fucks us to death?  If you really wanted someone else, the work to be done was the last years - in a still frigged system 💩
I doubt Biden has ever sent a Tweet.
"Joe Biden Picks Black Vagina as Running Mate"
It must really suck to see Biden tweets with 300k likes and your tweets with 50k once your Russian bots were removed. Sorry bro.
Sign. Me. Up.l!!
Hey. I know logic and practicality escape you, and thats ok, but can you sell on Biden/Harris? Just let me ask you four (4) "why" questions and see if you can sway my vote to destroy this country. How 'bout it?
I will add I don't expect schools to stay shut down forever.  I just expect them to open and operate safely for all.  Based on verifiable photos we've seen from the past week, I think it's safe to say these schools have many improvements to make.
Anyone with sense would be upset at someone attempting to down play the potential spread from kids to adults.  Especially when it happened to them.  If your ACTUAL argument is there is such a small chance that it doesn't worth shut downs, ok.  But the possibility IS there.
Now if you have some proof to disprove my Covid results or otherwise, I’m all ears. Otherwise, I’d suggest taking some classes on how to hold a civil discussion instead of utilizing ones profile description to get out of a conversation.
If you took just another minute to click that twitch link, you’d see videos clear as day with my face.   I’m not one of these bots you been dealing with, I have receipts. Do the math yourself if you need to verify my comments about just getting over Covid. Let’s stay on topic.
The COVID result, the fact that I got it from a kid playing organized sports, or both?
I just honestly want to know how Biden got the nomination lol. Like, I honestly want to know how democrats could look at their candidates, and go for him. Like sure, he was Obama’s VP, and everyone loved Obama, but that was 11 years ago. Times have changed
Go to Antifa website and it takes you right to Joe Biden’s campaign. So it shows Biden supports Antifa and BLM outside of being a Racies. I thought this was Anerica and his pick was going to be a Black Female. If Trump said that the media would go berserk.
So.... are you saying you’re not voting for Biden?
Biden did the most raciest thing he could possibly do. In this country we pick people based on experience not race. But Biden picked a VP based on Gender and  color. So he said he would pick a woman of color. So it just shows he is a bigger raciest then thought.
I just got over a stint with COVID. I can confirm children do have a high enough “viral load” to infect others because that’s how we got it.
That’s all the Biden campaign could afford to pay!
well if you go to search bar and type  it takes you to Biden s website. Wow #RIGGEDELECTION
Looking forward to the day when the Biden administrations AG subpoenas you for the criminal investigation of Trump that you most likely participated in.
please call Biden-Hair Ass out on their lies. Biden speech today is despicable. Can’t let them win. Please remind people she is not Afro American
Katie people listening to Biden right now are screaming at their screens. Don’t let them get away with the lies they are spreading.
Im not a republican but my parents are. They live in Pennsylvania and theyre voting for Biden time. How he handled Covid is the reason why. They’re older so they’re higher risk and they dont feel like Trump is taking it seriously.
A perspective by the  (National Shooting Sports Foundation) on Kamala Harris and gun control.
Biden can’t do it. Body and mind won’t allow it.
Don’t fall for it!!! Don’t let him draw support from Biden. We must be unified to defeat Trump.
Biden and Harris will most likely win (as long as Biden remains out of the public eye). Harris will replace him pretty early on and run for re-election in 2024. We won't have a chance to address the real issues until 2028 but by then things will likely be too late.
Kamala is running along side KKK Supporting Joe Biden. What an inclusive ticket the Democrats have arranged.
How many of you really believe Biden had anything to do with selecting Kamala Harris? Yeah, me either...
It’s a different between MAGA people and those who like Biden/Harris. Don’t give me that both are mean line. Do you then, sit it out.
Kamala as Biden's VP pick?  What do you suppose she was thinking??
I rather Biden then an Uncle Tom 😂😂😂😂
Jason Nichols  watching you on Fox and all I have to say is: "can you please get off the narrative that Trump is a racist" Look at the facts, he has done more for blacks than Biden or Harris has done and if he was such a racist why did he donate to her campaign?
No they wont be.  Theyre sick of being trapped in the house because of your mismanagement of Covid.  They want out of the house and that means voting for Biden.
Joe Biden didn't pick anyone, he was picking his nose when the Deep State chose Heels Up Harris
Honestly doesn't matter...Joe can debate or not...you can have Kamala or not...BIDEN WILL NOT EVER WIN!!!
Think I’m gonna skip this years presidential election, tired of choosing the lesser of two evils! I hate Kamala Harris and I hate Trump, Biden is just a dumbass in the way
IF YALL WANT TO VOTE FOR TRUMP THAT IS ALL YOU GOT TO SAY. Don’t hide under “anti-Biden”.
You sound scared.... #placeholderjoe never planned on debate. Joe isn’t even campaigning.  He read from a script while taking to Kamala. We see Biden. He’s a big boy running for President- Time to step out in front of Americans and earn the vote. Dems planning #chaos
Dream on. It’s ok we know Biden doesn’t want to come out to play. #basementpresidentialdebates2020
They are going to have to be careful going after a black(?)female!  Stay on her record-Trump turn her attacks on him into him pointing out Biden’s many weaknesses-let Pence deal with Harris!  Just keep listing her record!
Anybody believe Biden had anything to do with the selection?
Post a couple Pro Biden Tweets, you should be fine.
Hold up, both of you. The "I would veto m4a" line is worthy of criticism because to VETO it means it already got THROUGH congress. That would be trashing a big win. Biden remains a better option than Trump. It's colossally stupid for him to threaten veto on prog legislation tho!
Yeah, because those  ratings are through the roof. Biden does online town halls and gets 19 viewers. Unless  gives a press conference detailing her rise to the top - Willie Brown - no one would watch.
Kamala Harris is the First Indian American to be selected to run for President after she gets rid of Mindless Joe Biden!!! And I thought they said they were going to nominate a Black Woman. Oh well, four more years...…...
“He (Biden) caves to the extreme left whenever he needs to. Harris is way to the left of what Biden used to be, of course at the moment they’re kind of in sync. Dick Morris
John Kasich  you think Joe Biden is a man of deep faith? If he were he would not believe and support abortion, removal of prayer from school and wanting to teach Islam and so many more liberal views that go against God.
You overshot your shot, I said I care, I’m just not hell bent over politics. I know all about BOTH Biden/Kamala, I’ve interviewed them both just like Trump/Pence, though I interviewed VP. Neither has a strategy in place on bettering the US. All have 80+ days to have a plan. 👈🏾
Remember, Biden (and the Clintons) LOVED ol KKK Robert Byrd...he was their “mentor”...proof the old bigots never “switched and became Republican”....nope, they decided best way to stay in power was to use minorities by keeping them down with government dependence #NeverBiden
..man, these super deep conservatives/GOP voters are HOT🔥 today, not at Biden, b/c he picked a black woman named Kamala Harris as his VP candidate. My blocking game also be HOT🔥as well w/trolls thinking they can throw rocks &amp; hide their hands. I’m not the one you want! 👏🏾💯
Rand is spot on!!! And it is funny (and sad) how the Establishment Obama/Clinton/Biden Democrats squashed Tulsi...Tulsi a military veteran who while I disagreed with on 90 percent of the issues at least was honest...even a bit Nationalist
5. Biden has shown he bows to pressure by picking Kamala. Biden claims to be a “moderate” but a moderate would never pick Harris. And Biden’s plan is to “win” and then resign and let Harris take over. #NeverBidenNeverHarris
It’s not only that. They just wasn’t expecting the one woman that they did not want to see be his running mate become his running mate because they are fearful of the power/backing (support system) Biden and Harris will have together w/the ppl, &amp; now, Trump supporters hella mad!
4. Also, Trump despite being called since day 1 “a dictator” has shown what federalism is, he’s let governors mostly run their states during the crisis and assisted them where needed which is how it is supposed to be! Biden would lock everything down permanently and hide
Claudia....THEY BIG MAD today! What shook them...a BLACK woman they don’t like is Biden’s VP candidate and they are fearing this is the end for them! You hate to see it! 👏🏾
It only makes sense a raciest Biden pick another raciest for his VP pick.  Just shows he stays true to his raciest values.
Anyone but Trump  (by anyone I mean Biden, shut up Kanye)
Just a reminder that voting for Biden and Harris isn’t just about the presidency. It’s also about getting better cabinet leaders. A neurosurgeon is head of HUD and the  current secretary of education doesn’t care about kids getting sick at school from COVID. We need better.
Intelligent people will research that video showing Joe Biden saying the N word and will learn that he was criticizing the words of a racist bigot.
Biden chose k harris thus assuring the re - election of Trump Pence.  Thanks for the Peace of mind. Sleepy joe.
Not only that, but Biden would be the 1st VP to win the White House as President since George H.W. Bush did in 1989.
Did Biden have any chances???
Awesome choice, Biden! So happy for Kamala and my party.
Biden actually read a script on the Zoom call and held his phone upside down. This man is toast. This is not going to go well for y’all.
BidenHarris ticket will bring Donnie down, &amp; while Biden’s straightening out Donnie’s mess, Kamela will be putting him in jail!
Harris. Will. Eat. Pence. Alive.  ⁦⁦
To all you liberals who just bought weapons out of fear due to the riots will have to sell them back to the government under a Biden/Harris win. Whatcha ya gonna do then? Vote Trump/Pence and keep you’re guns!
Now, Biden, put   over education please.  needs to go. Senator Warren would be the best for education....she will rebuild the education system.
...what’s your re-election plan? (that’s not attacking Biden/Harris)
Biden will not be the nominee. He will be gone.
Well that was quick!  Bypassed by Biden, Abrams likely to focus on 2022 rematch against Kemp
Kamala Harris also laughed about separating children from their parents in prison. Her and Joe Biden want to take away AR-15s away from the American people.  already exposed this woman on the debate stage. How do people celebrate her.
Congratulations!!!   I am so happy, words cannot express my feelings !! A Biden / Harris ticket is phenomenal!! The two of you are the dynamic duo of hope!!!! I can’t wait to go out and vote for the both of you!!
Really doesn't matter who Biden picked...
sure ain’t learn about biden’s crime bill in school. not surprised.. bc i ain’t kno bout none of this.
was biden my first pick? no. am i thrilled with him picking harris? no. will i vote for them because doing anything else will result in 4 more years of trump? yes i absolutely will bc i refuse to let my frustrations with the ticket get us 4 more years of corruption and hatred.
Guess I can still vote for Biden/Harris- even though her stepson is a Tiger!!  ##ccsucks #dupioneers #nowademocrat #recoveringrepublucan

You will stoop as low as it takes for the sake of power. Have you seen the case to which the man, (NOT Pres. Obama, NOT VP BIDEN) has pled guilty?  He isn't pleading to spying, U LIAR. He's pleading to taking a cyber short cut, of which you have probably taken thousands.

.⁦ is such a good-hearted man. Imperfect, to be sure, but astoundingly decent.
Is a Biden/Harris victory going to make it easier for the Left to win Democratic Primaries?   I'm just saying, if you are a Progressive Democrat, that should be a VERY HIGH PRIORITY.
Right now, the Left's major problem is that we don't get past PRIMARIES.  That doesn't get better with Biden and Harris dictating the ethic from the top of the party.
“You ain’t black if you don’t vote for me,” Biden said with a smirk, and added, “Black Americans lack diversity with few exceptions.”  “Vote for Security. Vote for your lives. Vote President Trump.”
Kamala Harris can’t escape the wicked witch of the West phenomenology. She’s been type-cast for that role. Joe Biden can’t escape Barney Fife typecast. He’s played Barney all of his life. Barney was never meant to be sheriff. Joe was never meant to be president.
Biden looks like crap. He’s fading away. Everyday he loses more brain cells and his world of possibilities narrows into a basement and a record player.
How will Biden respond when all seems lost, and Harris decides to accuse Biden of molesting her? Will Harris pull a MeToo coup?
“You ain’t black unless you vote for me.” Inductive reasoning. Biden’s claim is like the famous claim that all swans are white—undermined by one black swan. You lose! Go Trump!
Joe doesn’t write those tweets. K-Harris is the last person you’d want watching your back. I’d say K Harris will say Biden molested her. She’ll move to the head of the ticked, &amp; Biden will be remembered as an old demented guy who molested women. Keep Jill with you at all times.
I’m in AthensGa, a town that will go (at least) 70-30 Biden.   I have yet to see a Biden sign. I do see the occasional Trump sign.   Takeaway: there is no pro-Biden, here or anywhere. There is only anti-Trump.
Biden stopped and composed himself and addressed his security staff who’d dropped their jaws. “I sleep with different socks to remind me to put on my pants. I’m going to need a better reminder. Sorry!”
“You ain’t black if you don’t vote for me,” Joe Biden said with a smirk, and added. “Black people with few exceptions lack diversity.”  “I’m voting for security. Vote for President Trump!”
The Biden family is getting ready to go down. Get ready for Presidential Nominee Harrs!

I know how we could have saved 80k lives. Lock up the Five Dem Governors who sent 80k to their deaths in Nursing Homes. Cuomo, Murphy, Wolf, Whitmer, and Newsom. Stop Biden and his mass murdering governors.
Trump has protected Social Security. Schumer, Biden, and the left want to print more money allowing inflation to take away your Social Security and other property of value. You will become their slaves in America’s Venezuela.
I don’t... which is partly why I supported Warren. But your perfect candidate doesn’t exist. The choice is between Biden and Trump, and Biden is by far and away the best choice and will make a fine President.
I don’t disagree that parts of it were bad policy. The bill was a compromise. Biden himself said it wasn’t perfect and went on record back then about not being a fan fo the sentencing. But the bill included an assault weapons ban and the Violence Against Women Act. These are good
Yeah, we're voting for Biden!!
Voting by mail, absentee ballot is safe. But mail-in-ballots are not verifiable. They are fraud waiting to happen from the mailbox to the vote box. Biden’s Dementia has made him stupid. He looks like crap.

Such lies you tell I'm riding with Biden and I wouldn't vote for you if my life depended on it. And there's a lot of Republicans turning their back on you because you haven't done a darn thing you said you were going to do.
Biden wants to print more money so that he can make you poor and dependent with inflation. Give 2 trillion to the failing Dem sanctuary cities, and Biden will give you a 200 billion. Demented Joe Biden and Communist K-Harris need your vote to make you poor.
Biden will not provide security. Anything you put before security you will lose. Don’t let Biden fool you with DNC propaganda.

Biden can’t comprehend anything, he can barely read a teleprompter.
Joe Biden ended his first campaign for president?
You have to understand,  four more years of Trump Presidency doesn't screw up the Democratic party the way a Biden/Harris Presidency does.  Company Democrats are aggressively anti-Left.

Pelosi, Biden, and Harris will use their SS to rob, murder, and burn down one community at a time.
“You ain’t black if you don’t vote for me,” Joe Biden said. “And Black Americans with few exceptions lack diversity.” Trump has the best empirical mind of our time. No one better! “He has my vote!”
Biden has several hurdles. He’s physically and mentally challenged. He’s fragile. He could fall and break his hip. That would do it.
The skinny brain syndrome is well known. As Biden loses weight his brain shrinks exponentially. Biden’s condition is called hydrocephalus exvacuo. It would be nice to see a CT scan of Biden’s brain with an EEG.

And he won't have the House for the next 2 either... and not the next 4 if he starts doing to things you're talking about... Of course when Biden/Harris start doing those things, the #Resistance will cheer - and that's exactly why the oligarchs gave us these four years of Trump.

No, the reason Harris got the job is she is qualified. She has the resume and relevant campaign experience. Plus, Biden trusts her bc she worked with his son. The headlines about her race and gender are bc that is what makes the pick historic. See the difference?

You ain’t black unless you vote for me,” Joe Biden said. “Black Americans lack diversity with few exceptions.”  Where doe Comma-la-te-da fit into Biden’s bigoted and racist America? She’s either a liar or a fraud?
NO that’s Biden &amp; Clinton
Not saying that I’m not still gonna vote for Biden/Harris buuuut .... can we all agree that historically they are basically republicans ???
Let’s hope Biden reverses everything Trump did but even Biden cannot bring back the over 100,000 dead people who have died needlessly because of  Trump’s handling of COVID-19.
It is public information along with his aneurysm brain surgery. Biden is a medical disaster waiting to happen. He’s living his last hour.
Joe Biden humiliates Trump amid his attacks on Kamala Harris  via
It took Bolsheviks five years to destroy one community at a time, burn all the churches, and murder 30 million. Biden &amp; Harris can’t stop them. Trump is the only path to security. Whether you love or hate, he’s the man. Whatever you place before security, you’ll lose. Everything!
In fact, (my mistake) there is data about Warren voters' second choice. It shows a similar number of her supporters would have gone to Sanders as would have gone to Biden.
Fwiw, we dont have data on who Warren voters would have chosen for their second choice. Many of them jumped ship to Biden when she quit because they didnt like Bernie. Evidence that all of Warren's supporters would have gone to Bernie is anecdotal and likely inaccurate.
If Trump’s immigration plan is -100, Obama/Biden’s was what a -70? And the best Democratic candidate on the Primary stage was maybe a +10? So is it better to have Biden for 4-8 years, or a wide open primary in both parties where immigration can be a central issue in 2024?
Yesterday, Presidential candidate Joe Biden announced his pick for Vice President: former presidential candidate &amp; Senator Kamala Harris. Campaign numbers show an enormous support for the pair in November’s election. Read more here:
Biden finds himself pulled off-message by self-inflicted mistakes - Axios
Biden doesn’t write his tweets. Come on, man. Biden looks like crap. He stumbled yesterday morning and staff were concerned he’d had a stroke.
"You can push Biden and Harris to the Left!!"  Biden is dumb, and Harris is smug.   We may need to admit that it's simply easier to fight Trump than it is to "convince" company Dems.
Harris and Biden are trying to use Black Americans like personal slaves. Then they are going to strip them of security and enjoy the carnage. Horrific! Trump is the only path to security!
Romney’s son was on the take along with Hunter Biden.
Well she did once say that Joe Biden was in fact racist so...🤷🏻‍♂️😂
I call BS.  Biden has been “spurring” the nation for many years and we are tired of being taken advantage of!
All this bs about Biden/Harris being so radical. You know what's radical? Fucking anonymous cops in the streets. Appointing fucking crooks and thieves to every possible govt job. Fucking firing inspectors general. Pardoning your fucking pals. That's fucking radical.
Biden is a lying Idiot. You are correct that he advised Obama not to take out Bin Laden. Just worthless, doesn’t he know it’s all on record?
I’m so dead that ppl think we are hating Biden Harris just to hate!! It’s not too much to ask to want a candidate who’s a genuinely good person who doesn’t have a history of creating or upholding racist policies to target the communities they swear to protect! I’ll still vote tho
When my dog gets his ballot that Trump says he'll get...he's fucking voting for Biden 🐾 #Dogs4Biden
You are smart enough to see the choices before you this November. DJT isn’t a choir boy, never has been, never will be, but when you see what Biden and the Democrats are proposing to do to this country your choice is an easy one to make.
My dog's fucking voting for Biden
The power has been out in Joe Biden’s mind for a long time. Let’s draw him out of the basement and see how he does.
The fix for a rigged election is already in motion. I bet they are planning on Biden stepping aside as his fitness for office is questioned. With DNC chairman pushing that she is ready to govern on day 1, something is up. Today was awkward
If you think Democrats like Biden and Harris are socialists starting a class war, just wait another 4 or 8 years, and you'll have the real thing. A real progressive tax structure will provide for this country's future.
She is ready on day one because Biden is unfit and mentally impaired, and the party will ask him to step aside? #MAGA
His brain must’ve caught what Biden’s brain has. WTF???
Trump just said Antifa was virtually a part of the Biden campaign.
Levin: Kamala Harris is SUICIDE for Democrats and Joe Biden  via
Me too...it was unexpected and Biden was on it...RIGHT!!
Biden could have chosen Condoleeza Rice and the GOP would still be like...THE MOST SOCIALIST LEFIST EXTREMIST TICKET EVER.
Harris wants to step over Biden’s dead body to rule America with her iron BLM Bolshevik fist. She’ll defund the police, take your guns, and let the peaceful Bolsheviks deliver historical justice. She won’t offer protection. She’ll enjoy the carnage.
“You ain’t black unless you vote for me,” Joe Biden said. “Black Americans have no diversity.”
The confederate Dems have sided with the BLM Bolsheviks. They want to defund the police and burn America down, one community at a time. Trump is the Lincoln of our time. Biden looks like crap, Jeff Davis.
1/3  I wrote this bit on subjective freedom and late modernity, before Harris was picked as Biden's VP.
Harris is a witch that few would want to live under. Biden is in his last hour of life. Harris could become the next Xi or the next Hitler. It all depends how her Socialist party might devolve.
Out of all the great choices we had at the beginning of the primary race, I can’t believe we ended up with a Biden/Harris ticket. Casting my ballot is going to make my jaw hurt.
LIVE VIDEO: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris appear together in Delaware
I’m really going to be clenching my teeth when I fill in that bubble next to Biden and Harris.
Has anyone else found the pro-Loeffler ads targeting Collins to be a bit... WEIRD? Collins is about as conservative as you get and it seems the pro-Loeffler folks are targeting people who don't know that. I dunno. It's like the same as trying to get socialism to stick to Biden.
That’s a strong selling point for Biden
Trump was nominated by the GOP which bent over backwards to gift him the nomination despite his lack of anything close to majority support from the party voters. He’s done nothing but continue the substantive policies Obama-Biden gave us.
What does a single vote for Biden change? How do you expect us to ever abolish the 2-party system (that is not actually a thing, and exists entirely a result of our unwillingness to use our voices to challenge it) if we continue to support it with the little power we wield.
Trump exists so that we will run into the arms of fascists like Kamala Harris. Everything Trump has done is the logical extension of the policies that Biden helped implement as VP. If we allow ourselves to vote out of fear, we’ve already lost.
I’m not a huge fan, and probably won’t be voting at all, but she’s a far better candidate than Biden, Harris, Trump, or Pence, and I don’t have to worry about her failings because she won’t be elected. I have no faith in the LP, but we need to build momentum for change.
She never backstabbed him either? She didn't owe anyone an endorsement. She saw the writing on the wall before y'all and decided she could do more good advising Biden than in helping a sinking Bernie campaign.
Y'all are bad at politics. Bernie didn't lose because of Warren, but because the centrist candidates came together around Biden. Either Warren was never going to win so she should have dropped out, or her endorsement was important enough to help Bernie win. You can't have both.
To be fair, the hill isn’t much steeper than the one they climbed four years ago. But we all misjudge reality - like thinking this is a contest without a predestined outcome, or that there’s a difference between the people who gave us Trump and Biden.
So you’re suggesting that my vote for Biden can change things, but my vote for  or my decision to stay home can’t? Because that’s some serious sophistry for someone throwing around “self-serving rationalizations for doing nothing” at others.
It’s not nonsense, it’s the way the system works, man. You can argue that libertarians shouldn’t actively campaign against Biden/for Trump, and I’d agree, but you can’t act like you support liberty, and then use your tiny voice to cast in with the lot and support the status quo.
Or maybe you recognize that Biden served in one of the worst administrations in the history of the world re: immigration and foreign policy, and you realize your lone vote has no impact beyond its value as a signal to others, and you don’t want to signal support for imperialists.
I agree with you in general but I did the same thing in 2016 and voted for Hillary. Four years later and I'd rather vote my conscious. I still might vote Biden but as of now I plan to write in Bernie. I really doubt Biden wins Georgia anyways, although it may be more competitive.
i know this isn’t the first time i’ve said it, but i’d KILL for Biden to be the super scary radical leftist that Fox keeps trying to scare its viewers into believing he is. the dude said he’d veto Medicare for All. on god what the fuck do you think a leftist is
gotta say. it’ll never not be amusing how hard Fox and Trump and all them keep trying to push that Biden is “embracing the radical left” and that picking Kamala means he’s “dropping the label of moderate”. bruh. he’s a centrist whose VP nom is a cop. fuck you mean?
I don’t think biden can convince anyone who’s red that he’s not a socialist through soundbites and messaging. He’s just gotta hope to drive up turnout and I don’t think he’s particularly good at that comparatively
I’m tired of the Trump bashing... is he the most experienced, qualified or educated president we’ve ever had? Not even close. Is he a better option over Joe Biden.... yes. This is a pb&amp;j vs steak and mays conversation.
Y’all screaming “vote blue no matter who” and saying that there are no better options than Biden and Harris are so pathetic to me. You would sacrifice your agency, ideals, and honor to a pack of old politicians because you can’t think of anything better? Disgusting
Good luck with second term trump! I'm sure that will be much better for you than Biden and the lady that voted with Bernie 95% of the time.
What I want to know is how many 2016 Trump voters or 2016 abstainers are voting Biden this time?  Otherwise you’re not a data point that gives any indication of how 2020 will be different from 2016.
Who is Kamala Harris? A look at Joe Biden's vice presidential running mate
. of  is interviewed by  about Joe Biden choosing Kamala Harris as his running mate.
Biden was pro same sex marriage before Obama was.
Can someone tell me why I should still vote for Biden after seeing this ad
You really think Biden will even make it to inauguration?
Important difference: that was Clinton’s chance on Election Day, while it’s Biden’s chance today. If the election were held today, Biden would have a 93% chance
I’ll translate Bill speak:  Biden is senile and can’t complete a sentence.  Trump will trounce him.  Let’s not have that happen
As for nothing tying Trump to Russia, don’t be ridiculous. He’s literally had business dealings and private meetings and private phone lines set up with them. There’s as many ties there as Biden has to China, so at BEST it’s a wash 🙃
Hahaha what are you even talking about?   Are you saying private meetings shouldn’t exist by government leadership? Or it’s okay if there’s no wrongdoing found? If the former, Trump is in the wrong. If the latter, then you can’t blame Biden as no wrongdoing has been found.
A vote for Biden and Harris is a vote for damning yourself to Pete Buttigieg on television for the rest of your life.
I have never been less enthused about the options on offer. But I of course will be voting Biden/Harris regardless, because that shit matters for people's actual lives.   And we cannot survive another four years of 45.
The irony of someone saying we’ll be lockdown forever under Biden when Trump hasn’t handled this pandemic in the six months he’s had to do so 🙃🙃🙃
Nate still peddling his snake oil. "We predict that Clinton/Biden will win"*  * But if Trump wins, we are still the least wrong, which means we are really right too.
Saw . on TV. He’s totally SHOT, looks terrible, exhausted, fat, and weak. If there was ever a good reason to vote Biden/Harris 2020 it’s him. Check out this jerk. He never had much going for him, but whatever he did have is missing in action! #TrumpIsLosing it.
Clinton had a 71% chance on Election Day. Biden has a 71% chance 3 months out. If the election were today, the model would give Biden a 93% chance
Saw . on TV. He’s totally SHOT, looks terrible, exhausted, fat, and weak. If there was ever a good reason to vote Biden/Harris 2020 it’s him. Check out this jerk. He never had much going for him, but whatever he did have is missing in action! #TrumpIsLosing it.

JOE BIDEN JUST GOT TRUMP REELECTED WITH KAMALA HARRIS PICK  via
I'm no great political analyst, but I'm thinking Biden's selection of Kamala Harris gives him an edge in California.
I trust Putin more than Biden
Biden looks like crap. He’s in his last hour. He can barely make it through a five minute interview without a racist comment.
So-called “partial birth abortions” have not been legal since 2003, and Biden has never been a cheerleader for them.   Keep trying,
Interesting choice on Biden’s part. Seems as though he didn’t consider this well. As much as I like Harris, this pick will not get him the votes he is looking for. Moderates don’t like her for Green New Deal &amp; Bernie’s Boys don’t because Biden is too centrist.
Kamala Harris Brings Extreme Gun Control Position to Biden Ticket  via
Ah—Just was reminded: Biden never SAID he doesn’t hold grudges with respect to Harris. That quote came from notes he had at a press conference in anticipation of a question never asked. The notes were captured on camera...
It will happen like this. October 10th, Biden will wake up not knowing where he is. He’ll stumble and fall. They’ll rush him to the hospital under Code Stroke protocol. His neurologist will diagnose as severe dementia. We’ll never hear from Biden again.
Behold: As the King of Madness &amp; Queen of Duplicity insouciance subdues and atrophies minds of the feeble. A splendid show of contrition without any requisite of remorse. So let’s rejoice in this anachronistic matrimony and welcome Biden’s new Cajoling Consortium of Thaumaturges.
Calling kamala and biden socialists is like the final proof that American education does not teach political science
I’m only voting for Biden cuz Taylor told me to
Me going to vote for Biden and Harris 2020
joe biden out here acting like we didn’t just scream “fuck the police” for 3 months
I guess Biden forgot to read the room... nice!! 😹😹😹
Damn, Biden looks like crap!
“Can Joe Biden sabotage this election? Find out tonight at 11”
Trump attacking Kamala is a joke...if the only thing he can say..is that she was nasty to Biden in the primary..well, he ain't got fucking shit about fuck
Sounds like you didn’t get the memo. Biden had new hair implants during the lockdown. They transplanted his curly leg hair. It took over a hundred hours to cover his bald head.
Poor Biden and the hate-based Dems. They can’t see what America’s children can see. Biden is an old man whose best days are over. He’s living his last days.
Biden wears depends. But remember incontinence is not an early sign of dementia. It’s a late sign.
Biden sounds damn bad, like crap. “Black Americans lack diversity.” “I don’t give a damn if they don’t vote for me. They ain’t black.”
I need someone to tell me why it's going to be easier to organize under Biden/Harris, rather than Trump/Pence.
This makes no sense at all.  Obama chose a very unthreatening Joe Biden as VP.  Haig had already shown us that Sec of State is not “in charge.”   SOS is a great job but not the #2 job.
Biden looks like crap and sounds like crap. There is no makeup that will cover his Dementia. Joe will never pass the Montreal Cognitive Test. He’s got to take the test. Remembering 5 things will be impossible. Go Trump! The best empirical mind of our time.
Biden looks like crap. He’s living his last hour.
They’ll do the opposite. Biden is on record saying the 94 crime bill didn’t go far enough to lock people up and saying busting out of district kids would “turn our schools into a racial jungle” Pair that with her record in Oakland incarcerating black people. That’s what they push
To be clear I do not like Biden or Kamala and this ticket IS trash but expecting Bernie to come out and bash it, risking dividing the left and further jeopardizing the chances of voting Trump out, is moronic
Really? Who was the Catholic during the Obama-Biden years?
Lol I’m sorry what did y’all want the man to tweet? "Biden sucks ACAB" like??? He’s a politician who votes left why would he sabotage the left’s only chance at getting trump out by tweeting anything other than support????
Because it's Biden.
In the last four days, I've seen more "elections don't matter"-style posts on my social media feed than I have in the last 8 years.  They all come from people trying to get folks to vote for Biden.
ok i know i said i wouldn’t participate in the discourse but i think it goes without saying that i didn’t need to see big tiddie Biden today 😔
Okay so if you’re a liberal going by your weird screech logic this means you can’t vote for Biden
That right there reminds us even more why we don't need to vote for Biden-Harris. Looking forward to watching brainless, clueless celebrities melt down with the other snowflakes after their pedophile presidental favorite and useless vice presidential favorite lose. #Trump2020.
I am a little bit curious about what the "defund the police" black feminists are going to do with the "Yaaassss Queen" black feminists over a Biden/Harris ticket.
Trump will only spew lies about Biden/Harris. Ignore it and focus on fighting voter suppression in your city/county/state. That is the real threat we're up against.
Rice will become the greatest political criminal in American history. By not choosing Rice, Biden gave the greenlight to scapegoat Rice for Obamagate. The question. Is Rice smart enough to save herself?  Durham’s door is open.
I agree with Mimi! Happy and with emotions that I had not quite anticipated! Biden/Harris
A Biden/Harris ticket gives us 4 more years of Trump I’m afraid. The Democrats can’t pretend to be for progressive policies with these two. It’s like they’re trying to appeal to moderate Republicans who don’t like Trump. Being anti-Trump isn’t enough. It wasn’t in 2016.
I don’t like anything about our current political system. I hate the Biden is a rapist. I hate that Harris was a prosecutor. But unless you have another way to start digging us out of the mire, then I don’t really want to hear it.
Stacey Abrams says she’s really Joe Biden’s pick for VP.
I’m pissed too, but y’all niggas still better vote Biden/Harris.
And if you’ll justify Harris, is there anyone Biden could’ve picked that you wouldn’t still vote for him?
Joe Biden didn’t pick shit. The dnc appointed their real candidate.
And if we being real.... Biden is older so... please tell me you know where I’m going with this so I don’t have to say it
If that’s the alternative, I’ll take it over what Biden/Harris will bring for the next 12-16 years, possibly the next 2 with full control of Congress. (I’m not suggesting anyone vote for “the alternative” when there are actually multiple alternatives both on and off the ballot.)
Joe Biden really picked the worst VP there is lol get ready for 4 more years of trump
#ADOS I feel that Biden and the DNC didn't take ADOS seriously. They confirmed it with Kamala as his VP choice. I hope they are ready for the consequences of that. 🤔
Fuck Kamala Harris,Fuck Joe Biden,Fuck Donald Trump,Fuck Mike Pence,Fuck Barack Obama,Fuck the Clinton's,Fuck the Bush's,Fuck Nancy Pelosi,Fuck Mitch McConnell....basically Fuck 99% of all politicians
don’t you hate when joe biden
Too bad Biden didn’t write that tweet! Look at the grammar. We are being lied to and manipulated.
Biden/Harris 2020. Anyone but COVID N Chief Trump.
What is the alternative to voting Biden/Harris without being complicit in policies I disagree with?   I recognize this tweet isn’t speaking to me, but I like to think I consider other people/demographics and their livelihoods before I vote.
Yes. Vote Biden/Harris. We've learned that neoliberalism is better than fascism.
It matters to Black Americans who lack diversity according to Biden. It matters to the Monolith.
K-Harris has a problem. No one likes her. Biden has a problem. Harris knows he’s a demented old white guy who’s a racist at heart. Harris is no Obama. She’s the wicked witch of the West.
We need the Dems to have to negotiate with the left side of the party, rather than with the GOP. We need more AOCs. Leverage. Shift the negotiation table. Run left candidates in safe blue districts. If you don't like Biden/Harris, then pick a senate race to sponsor.
Perfect pick to neutralize the claim that Biden wants to defund the police. Since, ya know, Kamala is a cop. 🙄
Cannot think of a worse female running mate Biden could’ve chosen
It was in her book. Beau Biden was the only other AG she mentioned by name. She was the only AG at his funeral. It was always her.
Sounds great! You’ve convinced me to vote Biden/Harris. Great job!!!!
Two-faced Harris agrees to wet nurse Biden’s second infancy. But she will not give up her Senate seat. Sounds like she knows what’s coming.
Biden just threw away any chance he had

K-ration Harris got the nod. Biden just announced that he picked Susan Rice. But she lost in committee vote. K Harris won by a procedural matter. A tie goes to a flip of a coin decision. Tails won.
think of all the Biden Bottoms shirts we are gonna miss out on
Good choice   will be an awesome running mate!
With #KamalaHarris now #Biden’s VP, lets hope she will honor her campaign commitment to #MedicareForAll and push Biden to give all Americans equal access to health care.  With millions losing jobs and what health insurance they had, Medicare For All is more crucial than ever.
Biden just picked 47. We needed this.
Rice loses her bid for VP. She is out. Biden and Obama know what they did. Rice does too. Rice needs to watch her back.
Biden/Harris. Let’s go.
And once Biden wins, we must keep pressuring from the left.

Biden et al., direct your attention and build your repertoire of reflective phenomena controlling what you think and eventually changing what you are, burying your sentient experiences that contradict their lies. Don’t give them your attention.
Obama and Biden know what they did. Rice knows too. Their anxiety and hot water are related to how much power they have to control data that might expose them. Rice is their greatest liability. They have to keep her close.My video in the other reply address this... it’s Biden’s response to cognitive test.

A black woman saying she is voting for Trump because Biden chose Harris... I’VE SEEN IT ALL THIS MORNING 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Biden supporters make my skin start itching
The part where she called him a racist? The part where Kamala believed all of Biden’s accusers? The part where she believed Jussie?
Actually we would be tethered to Russia more with the Marxist views of Biden/Harris....if it’s a divorce from Russia if Trump loses then it’s a marriage with a second Russian wife with 4 kids and a Chinese foster child.

How Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris: Inside the history-making VP pick
And who can miss this thread from  who is now fawning over Harris and the Biden-Harris ticket.
Trump — racist, misogynist  Pence— homophobe, racist   Biden — racist, misogynist, ...... Harris — racist   Jo Jorgensen—  Spike Cohen —
Biden and Kamela are the lesser of the two evils so stop acting there are better options. The other options are voting for Trump or not voting at all which is basically the same thing as voting for Trump.
I’m confused. Is Biden a racist or not?
Kamala Harris vice-presidential pick launches Biden towards a cabinet that looks like America  via  Lets Riot loot and destroys America Like the past three months. Take over and destroy democracy.
The Racist Republican’s are out in force now. They are attacking Kamala like the racist cult sheep they are. The name calling and pathetic bullying has begun. From their Traitor Tot Trump on down they are loosing their minds. Well done Biden/Harris. Let’s win this. 💙🇺🇸

Yes and if you remember I was telling folks that despite Biden’s campaign looking Dead that the Black Church Ladies would save him! 🤣🤣🤣  I knew things would change once the Black Delegation got a Vote. 🤷🏽‍♂️
IMO Kamala is a HUGE boost to Biden and he did right by Blacks!  He was on life support until the Black Delegation came and lifted him up! Black Women made him the Dem Candidate!
There they go. Everybody’s a critic. Biden and anyone is better than Trump/Pence.
Alright..... So now what negative y’all got to say about this cuz y’all gonna always find something negative with good ole Joe

No offensive, but can you read or hear? They said the exact opposite of what you are saying. They said the media is tearing down Biden and NOT tearing down Trump... take your blinders off.
That's not true and he's not a God just the best thing for America. Biden and all the Marxist Socialists, like you, will destroy America.

Geriatric Joe isn’t getting my vote - that’s for sure.  Actually, I know a lot of people and I’d say perhaps 10% are voting for Biden
Bowman aligns with Biden, the Establishment.
Yeah and Biden admitted that he was wrong.   When has Trump ever owned up to one of his THOUSANDS of lies?  I parse nothing. I watch the full versions of briefings and interviews to gain full context. Trump blatantly lies all the time.
Every day I see people posting “What are Biden’s plans? I don’t even know!” And I send them links. If you don’t know, it’s just willful ignorance.
We’re all gonna die: Biden 2020
Joe Biden?? Is that you?
Unless Biden/Kamala fall flat on their face, this legitimately SHOULD BE the end of the Republican Party.    I mean damn, they aligned themselves with Trump.  They supported Trump.  They defended Trump.   THE END.
What hopefully the majority of American voters will do on (or possibly before) Nov. 3rd, 2020 &amp; will become true when Biden/Harris replace Trump/Pence on Jan. 20, 2021:
Provide all of your evidence that Biden is a socialist.
Look there are very valid concerns about Biden and Harris’ contributions to mass incarceration and they need to answer for that but don’t act like Trump’s an abolitionist. Remember protesters were getting kidnapped by federal officers and that’s just the beginning
If you're a voter in the U.S. staying a live long to say and actually do to cast a ballot against Trump/Pence and for Biden/Harris on or before (if definitely needed) November 3rd, 2020!
Y'ALL MIGHT THINK VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN MIGHT WIN BUT DONALD TRUMP HAS A LOT OF SUPPORTERS WHO GONNA KEEP HIM IN THAT WHITE HOUSE JUST WATCH WHAT I TELL Y'ALL
EVERYBODY supports some form of Universal healthcare. Ya'll aren't special because you call it M4A, which is basically a bernie bro talking point to distance from Obamacare which is what the majority of the party is expecting to be recovered under Biden.
Wow, Trump's brother dies of Covid 19 and all Trump can say is Biden will be a better president than him. Crazzzy day in the white house.
Let's get Biden elected then get him impeached and have the first woman of color become president
Ok? Biden can’t even string together two coherent thoughts. Worked with ABI patients for 5 years. Biden is 100a% suffering from a cognitive deterioration. Oh and he inappropriately touches kids on camera over and over again. You’re gonna vote for that? 🤨
millennials being reminded that they have to vote for Joe Biden:
lolol Mayor Bottoms will be out of here as soon as she gets that job in the Biden administration. She has no intention of running for reelection for mayor in 2021... let alone running for governor in 2022.
Fair and we will continue to call Biden a senile dumbass. Deal?
Joe Biden, with all of his faults, would've stayed by his brothers side on his death bed rather than golf. Jog on mate!
At least Rudy was for law and order. You will be mad at the republicans for not forcing down your throat that communism will never work in the US if Biden, I mean Kamala is elected president.
Also they disapprove of police being militarized and lengthy prison sentences for blacks w/ minor offenses. These two things were headed by Biden  w/the crime bill. Biden can call it a "racial jungle" then 20 yrs later run for oval! That  letter "D" is a golden tix for anything
Furthermore bernie was begging for my vote and I cast it for biden just like many I know, kiss my ass
Biden was my next to last choice in the primary. I believe that, due to our electoral college system, only a binary choice is possible. Future elections and a needed national mask mandate can only happen if Trump is defeated. Voting for Biden is my last hope and yours too.
y’all know if you don’t vote for Biden we’re going to turn into an actual fascist nation. tr*mp cannot be trusted!!!!!!!!!!!!! i recognize my privilege in being able to say that. but like......................... this deadass is life or death
But you still can’t vote for Biden, huh?
That's a fucking lie and u know it, it was obviously always gonna be between biden and Sanders,  after south Carolina,  black voters especially older voter chose biden over Sanders,  the other's dropped out so sanders the independent didn't win and I was glad
#BidenHarris2020   Biden votes to lock up black people
What you mean, i voted for biden over Sanders,  but if Sanders got the nomination then I'd vote for him, but di you, enjoy republican presidents and a conservative Supreme Court for the foreseeable future,  its on you
i think it has to be felix biederman to write it because he is the only one who has the definitive understanding of who biden is and the place he occupies in american history
been doing more thinking on this article and my thoughts on biden have evolved to the point where i believe that he is one of the most compelling and tragic figures in american history. he has to win this election so somebody can write the robert caro style biography of him
Your right consequences for  Obama/Biden rice and the rest of the crooked dems.
The good news is Obama/Biden will pay the price for there crimes! So much ignorance. 44 was the worst president in anyone’s lifetime. The most non patriotic scum of the earth!
Ignorance!! How about Obama/ Biden’s crimes? So much ignorance!
The Hell it does.  I know what you’re implying and you’re full of shit.  I don’t care if it were a green 6 eyed dragon.  She’s a chameleon and no one knows what she’ll do, including you. Biden is a racist according to her during the debates and now she’s okay with him?  How?
I would have thought the “Biden” would have been over the asshole. Hmm.
All you mfs that are complaining about Biden and Trump now should’ve been active when we had a great option for presidency, but y’all paid Bernie DUST.
Biden's campaign ad on   and  is the most ridiculous, pandering BS I've seen in awhile. Seriously black folks?? Y'all really falling for this?
Followed all!
This time it would be different. She could be one of the reasons for maximum black &amp; Indo-American votes for the democratic party. Wise choice by Biden at the time of BLM era.

Northern Maine just about every other house I saw this week on vacation. Countless Trumps, 2 Biden over 300 miles
A Biden presidency would be much more like a despot than the allegatations from the Left that Trump is. Biden is his ticket now, and not a single press conference this week has he taken questions. Contrast that with Trump, who if anything, is too accessible and transparent!
Biden cannot speak one sentence straight 😀
It is going to be Biden-Harris at the White House this November 2020.
First Jonathan Capehart on Ari yesterday and today, Tiffany Cross bragging about forcing Biden to pick Kamala Harris. So disrespecting and bragging is worst. So, it's time for my eye roll to Biden
5.  I do believe this actually is a devious plan for them. Get supposed “moderate” Biden to fool everybody, he then wins, and drops out a year later and there is your President Harris. You all better turn out to vote for Trump, and better convince your family, friends etc too!
3. Then in 16, again the Super Delegates swayed to Hillary over Bernie...now in 20, they knew Bernie would once again lock it up, so they once again did the establiahment’s bidding and got Pocahontas to split the Bernie vote to destroy him and get Biden the senile in
They’re still doing this bit!  Anyway Jill Biden never got canned from the AV Club for publishing a fawning review for something that hadn’t been released yet so I think we can give her this one
2. (Contd) to nominate their candidate. Bernie would’ve gotten the nomination again, but the old guard called up everybody to get behind Biden. There is nothing “Democratic” about the “Democratic Party”. Think about it..in 08 the Super Delegates swayed to Obama from Hillary....
Thread: Even  ‘s Chris Wallace, a Democrat, is getting mad that Biden refuses to go on the hot seat as Trump always does. There is no more hiding him, Biden is a senile old man that has zero business running for President. Once again, the Dems rigged their process
I just watched your interview with Steven Moore, Horrible. Allow people to answer. Cutting them off, makes you look like a bully. I agree with your points but you annoyed me by not letting him respond. Go Biden!
Trump very well knows that by mail-in-voting will favor democrats more, he is trying every trick to stop that by stopping the funding to USPS, removing the postal blue boxes at counties...still one cannot stop Biden-Harris winning in Nov 2020.
Biden is already backing off the public option plan before the election has even happened.   I swear if I see one more liberal tell me Biden believes healthcare is a human right I’m going to write in Ralph Nader in Nov.
How many questions did Biden answer today?
And if that isn't enuf here is the real reason why they're losing money! One more thing to add to the changes we can implement if Biden/Harris wins in November. Think about all of this as you vote in November ...
All  would need to do to win now is promise to appoint  as Secretary of the Interior.  #Election2020
But HE IS the Great Divider.   His ability is uncanny.  Effortless.   He was BORN TO DIVIDE.   Try to make it thru the next 90 days.  Don’t assume Biden will win either.  Ever seen a scary movie?   It’s never over when you think.  Good luck! 🍀
Kamala Harris has never embraced her Indian roots. Biden thinks that he can swing key states with Indo American voters. Far from reality #kamalaHarrisisafraud #JoeBidenIsARacist #JoeBiden2020
I mean, I’m no big Biden/Harris fan, but I believe they have the ability to walk and chew gum. And, don’t be so selfish. The dignity of every human being is important.
Trump lead the lowest black unemployment ever, created #OpportunityZones, permanently funded black colleges... if Trump is a racist he sucks at it.  Biden on the other hand, he’s been a racist since 1977.
With Biden as President?  Haha.  The only way sane or normal will happen is if both current parties are dismantled.  Term limits, and clean House and Senate.  But it will never happen.
Haha makes me laugh. Since when Biden started caring about blacks.? #JoeBiden #kamalaHarrisisafraud
I agree. Joe Biden would never go on television and lie for half an hour every day.
That's even with 538's comparatively conservative model. JHK Forecasts has it 50/50 and other models have it similarly better for Biden.
Biden and Harris will not budge on healthcare, unfortunately. Beginning November 4th, I will work, donate, do whatever it takes to get progressives elected.
I remember her saying the other day how excited she was for Biden. This girl needs to research.
I do believe if Biden is elected, Trump is going to end up in prison some how.
Usps is being dismantled by its OWN poor management!  Trump is Not doing that.  It’s being done to make Trymp look bad...  just like the riots!!  Usps Union is supporting Biden..

Joe Biden has my vote and respect. Kamala Harris has my respect and approval. The pair are phenomenal!!
Biden had his son put on the board of a Ukrainian energy company being paid 500K a year, that's profiteering. His history demonstrates extreme racism. And both are against reparations. They need to start appealing to black ppl and the left
I'm on it. Biden it is.
Harris and Biden's legacies with black people show that both despise us quite a bit
Joe Biden said when it was known that he would be the Democratic candidate for president, that he would select a woman of color to be his VP. He in fact chose Kamala Harris because of her race and gender. I guess it wasn’t the content of her character, but the color of her skin.
"She is on a Joe Biden ticket and not a Bernie Sanders ticket."
It's just Biden campaign ad fodder day after day after day
It’s so gross. Bernie sees the good in everyone, to the point where him not going harder at Biden cost him the nomination and his backing Kamala has made a lot of the left understandably critical of him. Centrist and libs need to leave him alone. No one messes with pawpaw but us
i’m not saying i support trump, or biden... or kanye. everyone is fucking trash.
Biden literally does this every week already.
That depends on who is controlling the military. If Biden(kamala) is controlling the military,  he she  will definitely use them against US citizens who rebel against them. America will be over and controlled by Anarchy and BLM.
Sure, it could be, I don't say who will win, I just want to clarify to our allies and friends that we will be with them if Biden wins. :D

Neither Obama or Biden would let this country's economy crumble, and let the unemployment rate be the worst it's been since the great depression.
Neither Obama or Biden would have called the COVID-19 pandemic a liberal hoax while it ravages our country, killing 160,000 and infecting 5.4 million. Neither of them would sit idly by while the US intelligence community proves that Russia is paying bounties for dead US troops.
Was hoping some serious arrest would go down before the election like James Comey or something like that. Probably not likely. There is so much public knowledge about Biden's perverse behavior I don't know what could entail. I do believe this will be the most fraudulent election
They should throw him in an oubliette in a sub-basement under the Capitol and leave him there until after Biden is inaugurated.

Don't care what you want to see. You aren't nothing to Trump supporters.  Trump 2020.  Dems are racist to Black Americans. We don't think the same Joe Biden
He just endorsed Biden/Harris.

But others will vote for Biden out of pragmatism.  It is easier to push Democrats left than it is to resist a move to the right under Republicans, due to Democrats having no fundamental principles whatsoever.  Well-liked third party candidates on both sides throw it into chaos.

Wow. Just as bad from the far left.  They were ok with Biden and now they're unleashing their fury on both Harris AND Biden.   Something seems manufactured about this. I've seen the shitty memes.
Fight in brothers. It’s just a warm up if Biden wins which would be a cold day in hell. But if the libs find a way to cheat there will be civil war in this country like you never seen. Then tell me who is going to get the best down not the right.

No the left are the raciest ones. Biden I will only pick a African American woman. That’s discrimination and Harris is descendent of slave owners all facts. So you tell me who the raciest are and hypocrites.
so y’all just going to sit here and pretend like what he said was informative or helpful in any type of way he actually made fun of black people right in their faces damn the audacity Biden
Yang, Gabbard, and Buttigieg were the only candidates I had enough respect for to maybe give them a chance against Trump. Right now a vote for Trump is a vote against Biden just like a vote for Biden is a vote against Trump.
NPR ran a story about the Biden team supposedly leaning toward not even trying to prosecute him or his admin if they win and honest to god the mind reels. God knows I moan about this party but if they explicitly ran on nailing these ppl to the wall I’d canvas in a hazmat suit
Kinda like “lock her up”, but Clinton has never been charged with a crime.  Yet, many around the Trump campaign have been convicted. Like Trump just said Obama and Biden committed treason, by “spying” on his campaign. No one will be charged. You know why? Because Trump is a liar.
Blame the Democrats for giving Yang like 10 seconds of time in the debates and Gabbard even less. Exaggerating, but the reality is that while I plan to vote Trump, I donated to both their campaigns bc they were not far left and also Biden is losing his marbles man.
Biden is a white supremacist sir  Blacks live in a complete system of white supremacy in America no matter which political party is in office  are we done?

I say let em have it. The postal service is bound to lose hundreds of thousands of votes. Simple, Trump voters go to the polls and Biden voters send them in. We’ll see who comes out better!!
The fact that Joe Biden is only 8 points ahead of TrumpsterFire in national polls shows how truly horrible Joe Biden actually is.  My left shoe would be 30 points ahead right now, and y'all have never even seen it.
It’s not Biden speaking, you have to actually listen to it.
How does this make more people vote for Biden?
so i guess that means you;re just going to keep hammering Trump and the rest of the red team, while letting the blue team play rope a dope .. How about using some of those investigative journalists to point out the hypocrisy of biden/harris positions ? Hammer on the socialists ?
Why is Trump so upset with Harris, He’s running against Biden~ lol 😂
Why are you more mad at people unhappy with Biden and Harris than people who are happy to vote for Trump again?
Trump adds campaign stop near Joe Biden's hometown on first day of DNC  via
Hey fellow #WarrenDemocrats see this? 👇🏽 We’re all upset  wasn’t the VP pick, but she’s fully behind Biden now. We should be too. Please stop with the negative comments about Biden &amp; Harris. You’re only helping Trump at this point.
I mean, if Trump gets 70million and Biden gets 100 it will be obvious
Sit bot sit. Biden has already agreed to debates against this buffoon.
when did i say i supported joe biden or barack obama?
Biden screwed up on VP pick, I can't vote for Kamala. I am opposed to not voting, that is ultimately a vote for the winner. Abstaining only had meaning in parliamentary proceedings. Trump is a jerk and the GOP needs to be punished.  Maybe I go with the Constitution Party.

He’s endorsing Biden?  That’s odd.
He's obviously voting for Biden then
and many other news organizations, are literally encouraging massive voter fraud this election season.   That’s their only hope of Biden beating Trump.
Just Saying that Biden isn’t taking questions isn’t good enough  .  That’s a bs cop out.  IT IS THE ISSUE OF THE CAMPAIGN!  Ethical journalists would be screaming this top of show every night.  Are you?
This is platinum: Republicans for Joe Biden exists because Trump doesn’t have GOP values &amp; morals &amp; is an embarrassment to our country &amp; te world.
We will know when Florida counts, if Biden wins FL, Trump is toast.
They/she are once again mistakenly thinking this election is in the “bag” for Biden. Apparently 2016 taught the DNC nothing.
Great idea.   Ten Biden hardball questions gets 10 everyday already hardball questions.

got this shit off facebook but pls read it i’m so sick of seeing biden-harris hate on my TL... Like bitch??? what! do! u! suggest! we! do?!?!? this is fucking life and death, America is in the TOILET !! and it all happened in T**MP’s AMERICA!!!  we have to vote him out PERIOD!!
Kamala Harris really called Joe Biden a racist and is now like “Nvmd. I was just playin.”
You’re an alleged sexual assault survivor but you’re going to speak at the nomination of a man that has bragged about sexual assault, she definitely lied on Joe Biden I have no doubt. She wants some attention clearly.
Just because I speak boldly against Biden and Kamala dont ever think that makes me a potential republican. I dont need to go as hard  on Trump because what's understood need not be explained however these democrats still got negroes fooled. Make no mistake however Trump aint it.

We can’t be mad only at the cops for enforcing these laws, watch our cities get destroyed for it, then spare the legislators that created the very problem (worse yet turn to em 4 solutions)...On this issue alone, Biden to me, is the head of the snake (based off his own views).
Almost as good as Kamala’s reply to Colbert when he asked if she believed Biden was a racist, as she called him during the last Dem debate.  Her response, giggle giggle, “it was a debate!” 🤔 Whatt?
Oh come on... why didn’t Biden choose Warren?
Still can’t believe y’all got on here with the nerve to slander Kamala like she won’t do more good for us than Biden probably will lol
It did change things slightly. And idc what Joe Biden says, we aren’t going back to “normal” bc too many of us have been radicalized during this and won’t just let the status quo be enough. My bad, that went on longer than I expected.
pretty sure more people rightly blame biden and bill clinton for the crime bill than they do hillary  but who knows there's probably a lot of loons who do it to hillary too
Wrong... Biden the senile rapist chose her because she is would easily integrate into his campaign; he could have chosen Warren and that would’ve been a fine choice! But, no Warren is wilful do gooder, something that wouldn’t have quite settled with Senile Joe...
I wouldn’t answer that call.  It’s a robocall at best.  Though Biden’s administration may be calling and inviting the entire Chump Klan to answer for their litany of crimes.
Biden-Harris the biggest fraud in history. Biden broke the Equal Pay Act of 1963. Saying he pick a African American woman. Discrimination! Harris is not African American. Plus Harris is a descendent of a family who owned 86 slaves. Who are the Raciest &amp; Hypocrites?
Mom just called. “One of the upsides of your father passing away is that now I can put a Joe Biden sticker on my car!” So I just ordered her these. 🤣
The media was obsessed w/ Biden picking a VP who would appeal to Trump voters. A naturalized Haitian woman in Miami or the 1st time voter with DACA recipient siblings &amp; undocumented parents in Orlando are the voters Joe needs to win this election.
Go vote for corrupt n senile Biden. 40 years in politics was used to enrich himself n family. Biden paid hundreds thousands using US Aid to fire prosecutor who was seizing corrupt Barrissma assets n arrest warrant for corrupt owner.
Oh...Biden’s gonna take it all away! He &amp; Obama ONLY administration NOT to raise SS! They don’t give a shit about you or blacks! #FACTS
In his own words, his name (Biden) is imprinted on every major and minor crime bill that has come out of congress last 44 years of his tenure in D.C. The damage on (especially) black people caused by these laws will take at least another 2 generations or so to reverse.

Biden has actually moved to the left on issues like climate change, student debt, and taxes since the primaries. He’s adopting many of Elizabeth Warren’s policies. We can still do so much good for America under a Biden/Harris administration.
In what ways have progressives succeeded in working with Donald Trump over the last four years on issues such as wealth disparity, healthcare, human rights, police brutality, etc?  Progressives have a much better chance of being heard by Joe Biden.
Let’s be honest, if Biden didn’t run, Kamala probably would have gotten the nomination.

Right! But white people want a one-stop-shop to exonerate them from all that work. Voting for Biden (&amp; Harris!) is going to expiate a lot of that guilt  Stay on us, Doc! We just have to keep shouting!
I think you should look into what Sanders has said about his discussions with Biden.   Here is the unglamorous part: people have got to run for office on every single level. The state houses are wreaking havoc on the processes of law that determine so much. Everyone must show up.
I wish Bernie was still running ☹️ Biden’s policy’s aren’t that great. No “full” legalization of marijuana, abortions would have restrictions.. mm. Idk.
that isn’t Biden specifically. 65% of his supporters are voting for him simply because they want trump gone, not for him. that would be the same for any candidate, one with policies more so

My only 2 worries about that: (1) Will the damage done be too great come January 2021? (2) Will enough folks vote to save the post office (e.g. vote for Biden).
Good point. And didn’t both countries shut their borders?

If the Crime bill makes Joe Biden then were the Black legislators who pushed that bill racist as well ? Folks want him to be racist so bad they are going to re electban actual blatant racist. Clownery
Joe Biden has already admitted that millions of people will be left without coverage under his proposal.  Sanders had more union support than any candidate, even the Culinary union in Nevada overwhelmingly voted for him.   Kamala dropping M4A because of union support is BS.
I’m at peach with Biden winning lol beats the alternative
There we go, first evidence of a Biden boat parade! His election results will look exactly the same! That happened after he took on Kamala-Toe Harris as his VP choice! Love it! Let me pander even more to the colored Americans!
Lol, Biden has clear and precise messaging on his policies.  He has even announced his working with both Warren and Sanders to help shape some of these policies.   The other side has nothing.  They haven't had anything for four years. So these posts is bullshit!  #BidenHarris
Obama knew of Biden’s worthlessness for 8 years. Exactly why he orchestrated Biden’s nomination. Needed to have a firm grasp on the puppet’s strings.
Has anyone see a single Biden parade? A single Biden rally?
I guess Biden got a little lucky in that Trump is brazen in describing his own intentions. Think about how ill prepared fact-check is for someone with a minimum of discretion.
There was nothing great inherited,guess in the lefts eyes it was great since you don’t know how to build an  took a worldwide pandemic to slow the economy to best Obama/Biden yrs,even with a pandemic still creating more jobs a month then ever under you Dems

Trump is attempting to steal the election right before our eyes &amp; ppl wonder why I’ll take Biden over this bitch. I want a QUALIFIED politician who won’t abuse their power &amp; has respect for the transition of power when their term comes to an end. Trump shows signs of a dictator.
Sounds good but what could we actually do in DC? Serious question
Those excited by Biden/Harris are not the target audience.  It’s for those in the progressive/leftist movement who hate them for their complicity in racism/capitalism/sexism/imperialism, but willing to support them against Trump/Pence who are worse.
Because the media made the entire election about beating Donald Trump instead of substantive policy issues. They portrayed Biden as the safe candidate and Bernie as the risky candidate. That was the number one issue for voters.
Dude... I’m disappointed how hard it is for you to argue about the question I asked without the whataboutism with Biden. This has nothing to do with him.

Trump is only 3 years younger than Biden. He claimed it was difficult to pass a basic cognitive test, and examples of his constant mispronunciations, terrible memory, rambling, and ignorance are widely available on YT.  He fails your own standards.
Now do that "insert something fabricated by Fox News that has nothing to do with the topic" Joe Biden did.
Biden will get far better ratings.
Sanders would have been a candidate who'd boldly say, "Trump is dangerous, but we need to address systemic issues that exist beyond Trump." But instead we have a Biden candidacy that says, "Ignore systemic issues (that we plan to profit from), Trump is all that matters."
And frankly I'm sick and tired of reading stupid opinions. So I don't care how much you think Trump is Hitler, the fact is Joe Biden is worse and there are 4 candidates who can win. If you cant figure out who to vote for, just don't fucking vote.

Jennifer this piece is perfection. Joe Biden is the epitome of the “connect”, and as fellow connector, this is why I have always loved him and wanted him to be the nominee from the start. He’s real. He’s decent. He’s empathetic. The opposite of Trump.
And the FDA is entirely made up of leftist commies trying to elect brain dead biden.   They are biased to the point of recommending the killing millions of covid patients. The FDA is immoral and incompetent.
In late June, Joe Biden claimed President Donald Trump “wants to cut off money for the post office so they cannot deliver mail-in ballots.” At the time, we wrote that…[he] had no evidence…—but now he does.
I several states and Biden infected so many people with corona virus by making them vote in person instead of postponing or voting by mail  He killed a lot of people and no one is holding him accountable for those specific death of elderly poll workers
A vote for anyone other than Trump or Biden is a vote against Trump and Biden. Trump and Biden will only collect the votes they earn. And if Biden gets less, it’s because he hasn’t earned them 🤷🏼‍♂️
Specially since even with his light appearances Biden is still averaging like 1 unforced gaffe a week.
maybe, idk i don’t habe much faith in an outright support of a GND by kamala post election frankly, and i see biden as just bill clinton 2.  democrats are tired of the constant political news and just want a guy who isn’t republican to make the news stop being so scary.
Over the next week, Georgia Democrats will pressure Biden to live up to running mate Kamala Harris’ challenge to deliver “more than a victory” in November by competing in a state that Republicans have carried in every White House vote since 1996. #gapol
and not to mention more progressive policies essentially were told to fuck off by nominating biden so that’s pretty depressing  cant wait to hear the same phrase “we can do progressive policies next election we need to defeat the GOP right now!” in 2024 again
Because self-respect and preserving your dignity are more difficult than settling for less. Especially as a group. If we (Biden supporters) come out of this mess with a victory, there’s going to be a lot of Republican finger-pointing.
Oh that's right he's playing shadow elect for Biden.
There will be 50 seperate elections on election night. Biden may lead big nationally, but it’s not that big in each individual state.
trump is actively destroying the postal service to suppress voting, something he had claimed openly which nothing will happen about and frankly the damage to the postsl service will probably remain after biden is president because all his voters will have checked out of politics
ive honestly been clocking out of the election a bit frankly  it’s just depressing seeing every democrat poster worshipping biden  this sucks so much
Biden talking about his policy for the Erdogan Kurdish situation.   Imagine hearing the first clear US foreign policy discussion in 4 years and calling it 'iNcOhErENt'. State of these comments.
When the first ad on a YouTube video is anti-Biden
I sense a little jealousy that you didn’t get invited to ride on a boat. Some people work hard and save up enough money own buy one. What do Biden supporters do for fun?
can you PLEASE remix the VPs statement that “I’ve got some red meat for you. we’re not gonna let Biden and Harris cut our meat” it will be hilarious
Lol, you remember that time Biden worked in the White House for 8 years, right???
the likelihood of kamala using secret police to kidnap people off the streets, whether she’s a super cop or not, is low. There are things happening under Trump that just plain will not happen with Biden. It makes 0 sense to not vote for him and still call yourself progressive.
Biden only does what his handlers tell him too. I would do a laugh emogie....bit it's too sad. The guy is in old age and is being used. Sad he does not have the balls to be his own man. Guess he deserves it for being a puss all his life. Gosh....idk where i stand on this really.
People are saying that the election could tighten. What if it doesn't? What if Biden's lead continues to widen?
If one #FoxNews poll shows that more people are voting for #Biden but another poll says more people think their neighbors are voting for #Trump then all that tells us is that more Biden supporters hate their neighbors. Think about it.
Oh look, these are the police that Joe Biden wants to give more money to as incentive to not beat citizens over the head and do there job. Clearly more funding is what is needed here...gtfoh. #DefundThePolice

He brought it on himself. Republicans insist on talking about Biden’s supposed mental unfitness despite the *plentiful* ammunition that exists against Trump. It is the weirdest path of attack, which I can only assume originated from Trump’s tendency to project his weaknesses.
Someone please make a #meme of a Biden Boat Parade with one row boat (no oars), and maybe a canoe or two.
Just wait until a liberal judge orders states to count these votes to help Biden.
Pretty sure Kamala and Biden welcome the birther attacks as a useful distraction from talking about their records.
One GA organization got 50,000 more Black MEN to participate in the primaries for Biden.  I told you, Republicans: There’s an ENTIRE VOTING BLOC ready to hear your pitch.  But trust ... they will make their demands. They want TANGIBLES, not some Congressional Committee meeting!
Well, I'm not sure how else to interpret "we're blamed for not voting". There's nothing in that statement that says you're not going to continue that action. Anyway, I hope you'll vote against actual fascism this November by holding your nose and choosing Biden.
From January 2020 promoted by Erdogan’s lovers angery at Biden. Not sure whom Erdogan prefers. Trump or Biden. His “friendship” with Putin is pragmatic after being abandoned by Obama. He prefers NATO support over Putin, or Trump chaos but he may not get NATO support with Biden

🙋‍♂️Raise your hand if you are going to Vote for President Joe Biden!
What we absolutely can't do is allow Donald J Trump, AKA the Tangerine Terror, to stay in the White House another four years. #Trump is the only one who will experience defeatism come November. America will prevail &amp; restore truth &amp; dignity to the White House by electing #Biden.
There is Amtrak but people don’t give it a second thought. I suppose once Biden starts kicking Trump’s ass, there will be calls to defund Amtrak too.

You know that you've been a pathetic disaster of a  &amp; you won't get the votes to win, so you're trying to destroy the  to suppress votes. You're the evil villain in America's current story. I will walk over broken glass &amp; swim through a sea of covid to vote for #Biden.
it's weird bc i see it in hyper-progressives who work for all of those things -- defunding police, dismantling ICE, opening borders, etc. -- and see voting for biden as their hard stop, not gonna do it boundary. like? it's counterintuitive to all your other beliefs!
"the history-making announcement of Kamala Harris as Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s running mate still felt electrifying to Democrats, who donated $50 million to the Biden campaign in the two days after the pick (Biden raised just over $60 million 2019)"

I literally haven’t seen Biden in a public setting taking questions or even personally announcing his running mate... what are they hiding??
Build Back Better is just idiotic  And, it's an oxymoron  If you're building something better (progress), then you're not rebuilding back (regress)  It's the perfect slogan for Biden's oxymoronic campaign
Dude i am not voting biden. He is a disgrace. Bye.
Do you remember when you joined Twitter? I do! #MyTwitterAnniversary Actually, I don't remember. I've only recently been active on Twitter. Now I'm dedicated to electing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. And Jon Ossoff and Rafael Warnock in Georgia. And Jaime Harrison in SC.
i understand that i need to vote for biden, but it feels nasty. i think he’s incompetent, racist, and predatory. i feel like if i vote for him bc i hate the alternative, that’s the same reasoning behind most republicans who voted for trump in 2016 lmao
“She’s in favor of universal healthcare....”   “But she is in favor of Bernie’s plan?”   “Actually she’s on a Biden ticket and not a Sanders ticket.” 💀💀💀
Obama's comment was meant as a compliment to Biden, that he wouldn't just go with the flow, that he could be disruptive when need be...
Just like Biden did in Ukraine getting the prosecutor fired there doing his quid pro quo he will do the same here. There is no doubt Biden is as dirty as Hussian Obama.  His in China’s back pocket getting paid millions of dollars.
How about we just send you some Biden and Harris signs instead? Seems more appropriate given the state of things. #TrumpForPrison2021 #BidenHarris2020 #BidenHarris
Lowkey getting tired of criticizing Biden and Kamala’s past records. They’re both terrible.  More importantly though, their present platform is pathetic and will cost tens of thousands of lives per year bc they refuse to adopt policies their own party overwhelmingly supports.
I should have clarified that I mean the people rather than the establishment DNC politicians.  The voters insulting us daily for refusing to vote for Biden.  They just wanna go back to sleep and not be bothered with the heinous things our government does....
is willing to watch every American foundation burn just to keep in power the man who ruined the economy, neglected the pandemic, and caused the largest unemployment rate in history. Trump is not fit for office. Donate to Biden instead:
#BenedictDonald I think this election will be a landslide victory for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris...if all the votes are counted. VOTE as early as the law allows.

I made what's going to be my last ditch effort to convert my friends over to Biden. They're in Alabama. I lived there for 43 years. Yes there's something in the water &amp; air, but what I never could figure out. I'll be with Crimson Tide for life, I'll never live there again.
Pelosi says Trump is 'openly working to destroy' the USPS ahead of election: Despite his habitual cheating trump’s been a failure his entire life &amp; his attempt to ‘cheat’ his way into a 2nd term will fail as well
Not a fan of how Bernie would concentrate more power in Washington DC, but at least Bernie + Warren + Yang each had a vision. Biden is here purely for that notch in his belt. No vision, just “not Trump.”
I think Biden will drop out and Pence will join the dark side. Pence Harris
Hah! Real women know the truth, you hate women and denigrate them.   You've done nothing for anyone but yourself all your life. All us nasty women will be voting Biden! #WomenAgainstTrump #TrumpKillsUSPS #BidenHarrisLandslide2020
“She is on the Biden ticket not on a Sanders ticket”
Believe women. Except for when they accuse Joe Biden.
Biden himself said it.   What accomplishments? You mean the one where she pimped herself out to married powerful men to get career advances??

Harris says the truth about Biden then denies now.  Sad! Shameful! Harris compared brave people of ICE to the KKK.  N Harris wants to be our second in command. NO!
Biden released his taxes, so should Trump.
So why didn’t Biden pick Tim Kaine? #jokes
like yes. we get it, biden isn’t that great (what politician ever has been perfectly wrapped up in any box???), however it will be A LOT easier to get him to put in place policies that we actually want. or we can just let trump win again and all die from a virus 💀
Well I'm just asking. I'm not getting jailed for my freedom of speech am I.Cathy Areu said shes putting people in jail whether guilty or not guilty. I just cant support someone who supports Cathy Areu is she one of your leaders? What shes doing is illegal. Be safe Joe Biden.k cya
Get a load of this piece of excrement who continues to push fake news despite this #finepeoplehoax being crushed years ago. Joe Biden, the media &amp; DNC keep pushing this idiotic lie.  has been embarrassing these clueless liars. I criticize  about real issues
Biden mask mandate: Any mask? Or must be an N95? Outdoors? While jogging alone? How about inside a store? 3 months? It’ll be snowing in the North. Why won’t u take a few questions, Joe? Is this what leadership looks like?
like the only option is to use biden to stall for time basically and it would derail a lot of the fascist momentum tr*mp managed to get
So think of it this way. Biden Harris win. And gop wins house. Kevin McCarthy is now speaker. Biden “dies” and Harris becomes president. Kevin does not become Vice President. Harris gets to choose her VP. Which is a highly unlikely scenario.
i know we’re all dunking tf on the biden/kamala ticket but y’all better still vote for that old white fuck bc its either trump or not trump
I know this is from May 2020 but... Seems kinda odd...and convenient...and scary af. So, is how Harris/Biden can b polling ahead of  even tho VP Biden refuses to answer even 1 simple question? Seems like a way to interfere in &amp; steal an election🤔😳
Oh, I hope so. I really don't have any hard feelings towards Beto. He wound up endorsing Biden shortly after Pete and Amy did, and I'm grateful to him for it.
Good...enough is enough!!!
"'Trump may damage American democracy permanently' - Khizr Khan, whose army captain son died in Iraq, gave a speech at 2016 Democratic convention that was a moral indictment of Trump. Joe Biden, he says, has the character to be president" #BidenHarris2020
"By politicizing agencies, Trump is creating a situation in which the right will accuse Biden of engaging in political manipulation simply by reverting them to their more traditional roles."
Exactly, Biden and trump are pedos and this Kamala lady is a super cop who wants people in jail so the government can use prisoners as free labor.
Biden why do you always run/hide in your basement and refuse to answer questions that are not stage and prepped first!🤨
((( BIDEN THERE’S A DIFFERENCE )))  MAILING A BALLOT TO EVERY SINGLE VOTER (regardless if there living or💀!  I.E. more registered voters than living in the district)  vs VOTER REQUESTING A BALLOT (that have to physically fill out a form to get a ballot) Biden is as smart as a 🐀
The biggest difference is American Dream Trump vs American Socilism Biden!
So, Kamala will be living in the White House rather than Joe Biden IF elected? Has it already been decided that Biden’s dementia will keep him from serving? Guess it doesn’t really matter since Trump will be President for 4 more years! #MAGA2020
And they are still attacking Biden and Harris right now. If they want unity then they should rein in their own.  By the way, have you noticed that they stopped saying, "Vote Blue No Matter Who" ever since their Chosen One dropped out?

Saying I’m hurting Biden by criticizing his corruption is like blaming fans for losing the super bowl when your teams coach was drunk and the players wore high heels.
What if Biden has picked Michelle Obama to be VP? That would have put Barack back in the White House as the VP First Gentleman !DOPE!
Ahh white ppl with black lives matter hashtags tweeting negative things about Biden/Harris and nothing about Trump 🤔
This is why I am voting for Biden. I have a moral compass.
Joe Biden isn't going to do any of that.  He's pretending he will now just like Obama pretended to be progressive in 2008. He lied.  It's how we got Trump.  Anything less than the Green New Deal is inadequate.
How can these people spend their whole life fighting the system do a complete 180 for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris
Biden released his taxes. Trump should, too. Buzz off, Greta.

Time to start treating Joe Biden like he is the President since he is going to win and he has already stated clear public administration policy to governors.
I'm most confused by the "who do you trust to handle the pandemic"  ❓. White men w no college degree pick Biden +23 pts?!? Who are the repubs and trump supporters in this poll?
So you’re saying we should back Biden so that the Billionaire exploiting the poor can lose? Cause that’s literally what Vaush is saying. You don’t get woke points for ideas. Actions speak louder than words and Trump winning is making the job of leftists harder.
said Biden was a sexual predator. So was she lying to us then, or is she lying to us now?
cronies. Think trump mentioned harris and biden more than anything else BUT failed to mention the coronavirus, Which is destroying this country. Did you miss that...
Its also a lie given Biden has promised to revitalize American manufacturing (which is probably a calculated political pander.) Biden too knows American manufacturing isn't returning wholesale.
Imagine claiming shit like "its Biden or fascism" when Biden is responsible for one of the most fascistic things the US has ever done, the patriot act.
Could we have a civil sand box conversation about Biden, Harris,  Trump, Pence, Democrats and Republicans without name calling or baseless accusations and unsubstantiated opinions?
Vote for Biden.

I wish the numbers were better as well but have to remember that polling formulas evolve. Many of 2020 polls that show Biden with smaller leads (applied retroactively), would also show HRC with much smaller leads or losing states in 2016.
Perhaps her roll is to show him the money!

Don’t have to... Biden bragged about it on video.
Unlike most potential presidents, no one knows what Biden stands for. He’s the figurehead for a shaky coalition that harbors radical views.  Bernie is economic minister. Warren Foreign minister. AOC Interior Minister/Welfare. Schumer Defense Minister...SAD
DeJoy should be charged with a crime. Now! So should the Republicans that are aiding and abetting. And hopefully, right on the Inaugural stage at the moment Joe Biden is sworn in, Trump will be placed in handcuffs and hauled away for his multiple crimes. #TrumpIsKillingAmericans
Nope to scratching off war.  Bush started two wars and Joe helped.  Obama added 5 more and Joe helped.  Trump is too stupid to start more.  Biden is the greater evil because he'll start more wars.
Question of the day. Will Kamala keep Joe Biden on as her running mate?
Congratulations to Oklahoma on being the only state to avoid the scourge of a Biden county. Mike Gundy will be proud.
I answered you.  Joe Biden's environmental policies don't do anything until 20 years too late.  It's the same outcome as Trump's.  Anything less than #GreenNewDeal #GreenNewis inadequate.
Michelle Obama to go to bat for Biden
I answered you.  Biden on war.
I think that’s Biden
IMO, Biden &amp; Harris were the 2 worst candidates to choose to respond to the times we're in
This is all a set up! Biden’s gonna step aside make Pelosi President! Our country will go down the shitter worse than Obama years!🤮
Instead of a race war, we should have a drinking game.  1. Every QAnon reference is a drink, #savethechildren signage (w hashtag!) smooooke! 2. Whenever Biden or Harris is called a communist, drink! An anarchist, twice! 2. If shots are fired, shots for everyone! We'll need them.
2) The percentage of people who won’t vote for Biden and Harris because they are too moderate is extremely extremely small compared to the number of people who will not vote because the process is opaque or they don’t care about politics
I can't criticize Biden or the Democrats, though,  right? If I do I'm personally responsible for their downfall, do I have that right?
Is why Biden/Harris is a helluva Republican ticket. They’re both center right, not leftist. Got to work on getting more  into Congress and change this country for the good from the bottom up.
She pandering just like Biden smh y’all get too excited when y’all see a black politician. She don’t care about black people. She don’t even claim to be black lol Y’all don’t even know what she stands for or what she wants to do in office.
I my don’t matter, she don’t even claim it. She’s pandering to the black vote just like Biden did. They really don’t give a fuck about black people, they just use our culture as a way to get our vote

In light of  admission abt denying funding to USPS to stop mail-in ballots, are you still “considering” voting for Biden? Or are you going to waste your franchise w/a write-in?

Hey man my position, if you notice, is not sticking up for Biden. At all. Carlson knows better but is pandering to racists. And I don’t think “who’s more racist” is a good talking point for anyone hoping for a GOP victory in November.
So Trump is agreeing with everybody that the post office can’t handle election ballots. And everybody’s crying about it? And then you use a sound clip of reporters getting forced out of a press conference because someone asked Biden a question, but you don’t question that?
If you give Trump the power to force Twitter to publish anti-mask QAnon conspiracy nonsense, you give Biden and Harris the power to force Breitbart, Fox &amp; Daily Caller to publish Antifa manifestos (IDK if Antifa has manifestos, that just sounded scary) or anything they want.
But China wants Biden....

Play acting. Biden gave Obama the Veep pick he demanded.
Biden being a guaranteed win was an exaggeration, I assumed that would be obvious since every media outlet shows him in the lead (like they did Hillary in 2016) but if my exaggeration was taken at face value that was not my intent. No media outlets have him at 100% chance.

I went thru this dudes tweets since the beginning of Aug and he barely had a negative thing to say about Trump and there plenty to go after him on for the last two weeks. He made sure to attack Biden/Harris. That Howie dude does the same thing. Attack democrats is their mission.
You're being played dude. Every one of Joe Biden's supporters are being played. Trump was talking about very fine people on both sides of the statue debate. He condemned white nationalists and neo-nazis.
And yet if Trump wins, every democrat is going to say they are sure it is due to fraud, there could be no other way. And so, of course, it will be important to remove him by force, and install Biden no matter what.
Joe biden ass is a overt racist as well Trump is more offensive to POC while Biden boldly insults black people. Both are open racist with Trump the POC feels it while biden gone uplift all other groups and mass incarcerate us. A vote for either is negroism.
Is this just a little funny?  Have you bothered to consider what, if any, funds you will have left if Biden gets into office and wants to fund socialism?

Biden is a moderate. He is not a socialist....far from it. Don't let the radical right brainwash you
I can't speak directly to what you're doing (assuming a personal attack again) but I'm telling you by what I've seen  there are many riots out there their pushed by the progressive left and people like Joe Biden and other Democrats are not condemning it that should tell you a lot
Notice how all the people saying to wait til after the election to be critical of Biden are the same people who stood silently by as the Obama administration deoned half the middle east and eliminated the middle class?  I'm not too confident

No, I said it was pointless to point out past transgressions of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris until after the election unless you wanted Donald Trump to get another 4 years in office. These are the terms. This isn’t debatable.

Biden an anti Israel Presidential candidate, has Hutzpah.On Trumps historic Middle East peace agreement, claiming as VP he laid the ground work. What Biden, Obama did was sell out Israel at the UN! Obstaining on a vote condemning Israel!  Allowing Israel to be called  criminals.
Has there been a time in history, when Presidential, And Vice Presidential candidates, can have a press conference, say anything, with impunity? Biden, Harris are the answer. Make accusations, and leave without taking any questions.
Biden blames Trump for all of the lost lives due to COVID.  So by his rationale, if he had been President and didn’t close the borders (as he ridiculed Trump for doing) he would have been responsible for 1-2 Million American lives lost!
Has Joe Biden, or Donald Trump for that matter, taken a stance that I’m not aware of on transitioning children?

How on earth did you come to such a ridiculous conclusion?Are you unaware of what is happening in America right now?She’s actually a great pick for Biden &amp; will help him win.3/4 of America hate trump &amp; even his own party is pulling away from him, albeit quietly. Educate yourself!
TFW  gets to debate Joe Biden.
So Biden is better on economy?
So excited to support our Biden/Harris dream team!!
I honestly don’t see how someone can vote for Biden especially with Harris. Moreover, taking polls at face value is a fools game.
The Democratic base is getting stronger and wiser. And now with the Democratic ticket of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and ALL of the EXPERIENCE they each bring, we are NOW ENERGIZED! It may be a difficult race, BUT IN THE END WE WILL WIN!
So Biden gets more than 400 EVs?
Join me in supporting Help defeat Donald Trump and elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris via
Pretty much is the plan… Biden is just a front.
I am so excited to support the #BidenHarris ticket. Joe Biden is running to restore the soul of our country. To win this fight he picked a strong fighter- Kamala Harris has spent decades defending our constitution and protecting the most vulnerable among us. I am ready!
Biden/Harris is the ticket of austerity and foreign provocations. There will be the usual miserable moaning( 'there is no money for social programs') as the defense budget steadily climbs.
This suburban "housewife" will be voting for Joe Biden as will the other three people in my family.
There are now hundreds, if not thousands of people on my facebook, who are both Biden and Trump supporters. While I asked Trump supporters to NOT COMMENT because my facebook is a site to support Biden/Harris 2020 only, they still felt the need to comment. RESPECT MUST BE EARNED!
A really important watch for anyone like me who is disappointed in every presidential ticket up this year. TL:DR- This won't bring change, it will beat Trump. Change is still a fight.  Let's talk about the Biden Harris campaign and what it means for us....
No she doesn't, dork. I guess Biden's Catholicism is being conveniently forgotten then?
I didn’t know that Joe Biden is Catholic.  John F. Kennedy was the first Catholic president we had.  I do know that Biden was an ACME SenateNet agent.
Ronna McDaniel lies as much as Trump. Obviously they fear this Biden/Harris ticket.
Is this a safe space? *whispers* I wish Biden picked Stacey Abrams instead
Republicans are clearly worried about the Biden/Harris ticket. The ridiculous assertions being made by Trump &amp; Ronna McDaniel are lol pathetic.
The big concern for me is that it seems apparent that at least some of Biden's crew, if not Biden himself, resents feeling like they had to choose someone like Harris--she's headed into a pretty toxic workplace with backstabbers aplenty.
I do not want to see civil war here by any means... But we have to face the fact we are already at war.. we are having a virus used against us and everything else..  Is the silent majority going to remain asleep if Biden does win and there is voter fruad or doubt on results?
I do know I haven't seen a single Biden flag, yard sign or sticker anywhere
God is calling on you Joe Biden to make the fabric of America right! To show people from ALL walks of life that the United States of America is a beacon for those seeking a better life! I proudly stand behind you and pray for you daily that you will have STRENGTH to GET IT DONE!
Isn’t Biden Catholic?
Interesting. No, really. Something to keep banging the drum on. I am also concerned about these republican "allies". However, I have more faith in Biden.
Biden's Catholic
The whole Tara Reade thing self-imploded without Biden doing a thing. We're supposed to give the accuser the benefit of the doubt. I believed Reade too until all her lies and grifts came out. No one has yet to prove that Trump's 2 dozenl0 accusers were lying.
D'oh! You're right. Biden is a practicing Catholic of the non pedophilia type.   No wonder Tobin overlooks this. He prefers Catholics who place brown babies in cages and white babies on laps.
Glad to vote against him. Now, who had more blacks incarcerated in the US, Kamala Harris or Joe Biden?
Btw, Fig Newton, how are Trumpy’s golf cart rides going?? Biden was out riding a bike to stay in shape while Trumpy rode around a golf course while hundreds of thousands are dying. I guess Trumpy knows “whale” is a shape, even though actual whales are in better shape than him.
She's literally willing to throw away what little rights she has left, and for what? Trump has been systematically removing every right gained under Obama/Biden &amp; yet she seems to be okay with that. If he gets to stack SCOTUS, it's all over, &amp; again, she's apparently ok with that
Its interesting how these anti-Kamala and anti-Biden replies always blow up while its the middle of the night in the US. Putin's scared.
I put a picture of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on my Facebook page, encouraging people to support them. I STATED CLEARLY IN NO UNCERTAIN terms that if you are a TRUMP SUPPORTER, YOU ARE NOT TO LEAVE A COMMENT ON MY SITE! Do you Trump Supporters read? Or are you ignorant like HIM?
Historic wisdom states that people do not vote based on the bottom of the ticket. I don’t think that holds true for this election. I was voting for  but I do feel better with  on the ticket. It shows that Biden respects her knowledge despite differences.
Want some truth? Harris went after Biden and he didn't go all fragile, male ego, snowflaking on a podium over it. He decided she should be a voice in his campaign and his government. Gee, imagine that. Y'all might want to man up &amp; see if it's possible for you to grow some balls
I honestly don’t see a Biden victory after the Harris pick.
It seems Shaun King's memory is just as good as Joe Biden's memory...🤔😂
New State memos disclose relentless pressure by Hunter Biden-connected Ukrainian firm | Just The News
It's not over by any means. The over/under on Biden making it to election day is not even baked in here.
2 scenarios: 1) Biden landslide with coattails, flips Georgia, Senate, keeps House, and the "Burn it down" folks crow loud. 2) Trump wins, everything gets more Trumpy. QAnon goes mainstream: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene plans 2024 presidential campaign.
You live in a bubble. Not knowing the VP Biden is a practicing Catholic is proof of that.
You don’t have to very smart to be smarter than  So we’ll do ok with Biden. By the way Kamala has enough smarts for both of them
Yes man! We are so ready..! Thank you Dr. Jill Biden!
She was def the best candidate for presidency,  i predicted this from day 1. Too bad Biden will get slain in a debate. He doesn't represent the party. Party should run the best candidate that represents the following, Good night sleepy Joe, Landslide , good night!
AMEN, Madam Vice President indeed. We Biden/Harris supporters have a fight on our hands, but what sacrifice came without one! TIME FOR CHANGE! WE ARE READY! ONE LOVE Gabrielle Giffords, Stay safe! ONE LOVE! Aliciadine
Biden should have picked Tulsi.  Then I would have been worried.  Not so much now.  Either way,  is the winner.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris I am using my social media platform on Facebook to ramp up votes for your supporters and others who want CHANGE! I am with you both all the way! I hope that this helps! Let's GET OUT THE WORD TO VOTE FOR BIDEN/HARRIS IN 2020!
the fact that people are bragging abt not voting for Biden-Harris 😒 it’s the not knowing/caring enough abt the electoral system and the importance of this election and young voter turnout for me
Brilliant.  In Biden’s own words...
Biden/Harris makes Mondale/Ferraro look exciting..not a compliment btw.
Biden is a practicing Catholic.
Yikes.  This can’t help their relationship...
I was ready the first time around. I was ready when Biden won the primaries.

Only difference between biden and trump is the public opinion  They are both crooks
Fired up and ready to go again!!! Biden/Harris 2020!!!
You bet! We support Biden/Harris!
The GOP is dead in America! We're supporting Biden/Harris!
You're a ride and crude embarrassment to the people you are supposed to be serving. We will be supporting Biden/Harris!
We are happy about that! Proud to support Biden/Harris!!
If you think Biden’s platform is “I’m not the other guy” you’re not paying attention. Parties come and go but there will always be two. I didn’t vote for Biden in the primary, and I stand by that decision, but I will not be complicit in giving this fascist wannabe another term
The reality that conservatives are trying to paint is harder to by with Biden.
Just from my short time living in Georgia it's wild. I've legit seen Biden stuff in Alpharetta. Not a *lot*, but damn sure more than I ever expected before moving out here with my preconceived notions.
Kamala Harris challenged Joe Biden in a debate and made him a better man. Rather than hold a grudge, he picked her as his running mate. This tells a lot about the man Joe Biden is - together they will make this country proud. I just contributed to their campaign. #BidenHarris2020
Everyone knows Biden is the beard for Harris. He’s gone in less than 12 months.
Did she not call joe Biden a racist? Ah I forgot we can just throw around that term nowadays.
I stand by what I said. Nobody outside of his base believes that Joe Biden is a Marxist.
“Joe Biden wants to abolish the police and also he named a cop as his running mate checkmate libs” great message discipline guys
If Biden wins and Kamala Harris becomes our VP, it will be an Obama moment for me #BidenHarris2020 #happytears
Not crazy about Biden, but the fact he’s actually listening to progressives and changing his policies for them hasr thinking that he’s definitely better than Trump
Really? Biden holds his faith dearly, you can’t determine is he is or isn’t Catholic. Plus, you’ve lived without one in the whole house for 3 years... that’s... Sad.
Congratulations First Lady Jill Biden and Mr. Emhoff! LET'S GO! ONE LOVE! Aliciadine
A brave, bold choice for sure. This should encourage Americans from any background to run for office and make their voice heard! It will be interesting to see how this campaign pans out. #KamalaHarrisForVP
This broad actually endorsed Biden!!
Biden/Harris &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Trump/Pence  Voting third party is the same as voting for Trump. This shouldn’t even be a conversation
I loved Bernie and Elizabeth. But I'm not sure they'd be in the same position that Biden is now....
She’s no joke, she just thinks Biden supports segregation, believes he sexually assaulted those women, oh and she was smoking weed in college while listening to Tupac and Snoop, despite graduating at least 6 years before either released their first album.
Thank God Biden didn't chose Bottoms maybe now she'll take care of Atlanta as she elected to do. However in my opinion I doubt she will
Don’t forget that Kamala is a Law &amp; Order VP. Something  knows nothing about. I know Biden will pick a real Attorney General.
It's kinda weird.  was not my pick among Dem Presidential candidates. But she was my #1 pick for Biden's VP. She checks all the boxes. Great pick!
You’re so inspiring. I had hoped it was you, but will show up to do my part for Team Biden in November.
I have fans on 6 continents who love my music. And while I appreciate you, I will not allow you to desecrate my beliefs that Biden/Harris are BEST for America.  I will also BLOCK ANYONE who tries to use my facebook to wage war!Do NOT TRY TO USE MY SOCIAL MEDIA FOR YOUR PETTINESS!
But when majority of voters don’t think Biden will finish a first term, it’s a play that could work.
If you claim you’re anti-trump but the first thing you did when Biden announced his VP pick is find dirt on Kamala Harris, you’re not anti-trump.
I don’t know how anyone who is serious about police reform could possibly vote for a Biden/Harris ticket. He wrote and she enforced the laws that led to mass incarceration of black men.   Jo Jorgensen is an option.
She has accused Biden of being a racist, said she believes his accusers(sexual harassment)-in addition to her filthy war on poor people while DA. What a great pick 😂
When you start leading the American people by wearing your mask consistently and daily, let us know. Otherwise, pay attention to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to see what REAL LEADERSHIP looks like. Compared to your record, a 2 year old could win! LOSER IN CHIEF/BUNKER BABY!
LMAO!!! You sound scared as hell!!! #BidenHarris2020 #Biden #Kamala
I guess #phonyKamala doesn't “believe” Joe Biden’s sexual assault accusers anymore...🤔
I am definitely voting for Biden/Harris...we need to move on from the caveman mentality!
Since 2016? How many women aborted for him? He used to be pro-choice until he decided to hijack the Republican Party. He has no values, no political ideology. The guy is simply playing Americans. Biden is a better Christian
Please. We are between a rock and a hard place. Trump is the hardest place. As a Sanders supporter, I beg you, make that choice for Biden because I fear that we may not have another chance. 😰👊🙏💪WTF is a 'Biden Republican'?  Willard Romney and Skippy Kasich?  They are called DemocRATs you can have them Twinkle Toes.

Only if Biden steals the election with the phony mail fraud vote.  He nationalizes 20 million illegals and the rest of south America comes streaming over the border, it's on.  It will last about a week.  America will be a very white country when it's over.
You've seen a Biden sign?
#NBABubble. Please stop posting shit about what Labron thinks about anything.Espn,,etc sports think this guy is God I am a white dude that doesnt give a F***about what he thinks nor do i care about the NBA. JOE BIDEN. Come outta  the basement and answer questions
Trump is going to win all 50 states including NYC.  The DemocRATs have self destructed and the entire country knows it.  Biden can take his 11 million illegals and shove them where the sun don't shine, he is done.
American People,, Peep Game?! I've heard Chinese Communist party spokespeople say,,  When the new Biden &amp; Friends administration are in office after the election,, Everything will return back to normal...FOR THEM!! "We Can Not Allow These Traitors To Win"!!  America Stand Up!!!
We are in great shape.  We all know it is a hoax.  Even the schools are open, but the Biden controlled press will only tell you about the ones in town were they could get the union to force remote classes.  Couldn't pull that off out where the good schools are.
Biden get's elected they can send all the freeloading thugs over here.
Congratulations Acosta - With this tweet, you've put yourself to the front of the list of potential Biden White House Press Secretary.  #Hack
Where are the #FewGoodApples?    I know I shouldn’t be surprised, but this is beyond deplorable.
So who writes your Twitter posts? We know it isn't Chicken Joe Biden himself - heck he is almost completely out of it? Fact is Trump has been the best President America has seen since Abe Lincoln - He actually kept campaign promises - that's something U know nothing about?
At first I thought it was from  . Biden's team has been underestimated
“Trump is ripping a page out of Richard Nixon’s law-and-order campaign playbook from 1968...” We know how that worked out?!? #Vote #VoteBlue #DumpTrump2020 Trump gets endorsement of NYC police union, warns 'no one will be safe in Biden's America'
Neocons will pick up the slack, then.  2020 is so weird. Republicans are now either wacky red hat wearing quasi nationalists, center-Righties that can't stomach a Biden/Harris ticket (🤯), or neocons pledging to vote for a very moderate ticket from the Left to remove Trump.
Still think that’s accurate tho 😬  ...blown away that there’s “never Trump” folks that can’t pull the lever for a Biden/Harris ticket. It’s about the best we could hope for from the left.  You do you though, Brian. As for me, I can’t vote fast enough.  🤷‍♂️
Not true! Biden has answered questions about the weather, what type mask he prefers, is the basement ptoperly ventilated, can the press get him any coffee?
One might ask who do you so-called Republicans think Biden and Harris are going to put on the supreme court? Clarence Thomas or Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The visions could not be clearer.
so now you’re listening to #biden instead of #science #mandatory #mask😡 when #MasksDontWork what happened to individual #choice. Choose camp 2
Utter weakness on full display by the Biden campaign.
It amazes me that MAGA cult members actually try to attack Biden/Harris on morals????  Did you forget who your supreme leader is and his past?  Hell just look at your 1st lady.....came into the country illegally, slept with a married man to have an anchor baby.
If the Biden Campaign controlled press doesn't report it ... it never happened.  Been that way since Obammy remade America in his own image.
Why would you go to a political propoganda site for the Biden Campaign for news about 'Covid-19'?  Unless you haven't poisoned your mind enough for the day.
Unfortunately we are at a point where the candidates aren’t great, but Trump is definitely much much worse than Biden. The focus should be getting Trump out of office and by voting third-party or writing in someone’s name is just going to help re-elect Trump. But you do you.
You are too kind.  Biden is a known repeat liar.  He has told many whoppers such as his academic record.  He and his entire family are also crooks!
Nothing original about joe Biden.
Let’s be clear, Harris doesn’t support Biden.  She is using Biden, which is hard to criticize because he is simply a road block to her being President.He’s not well. Furthermore, Biden has no policy integrity and neither does she.They will get along fine before his 2 week notice.

Vote for Biden
Doesn't fit the Biden Campaign controlled media narrative.
I’m voting for Biden bc I want to actually help people. For me, not voting or voting for third party (which - be real. Will never get elected) is telling people in need that my own individual ideas about utopic politics are more important than their livelihoods.
speaking of liars.  Now do Lying Biden.  Oh that’s right he’s on your team so you just turn a blind eye to his 50 years of lies.
And it’s been China, China, China the whole time.  Biden is unfit for office.

The only age demographic where Trump is ahead of Biden is age 60 and older. That is the age demographic that would be most likely to vote by mail. It does strike me as a flawed strategy
Biden’s Mask Mandate Is a Ploy to Keep Him in the Basement
Maybe because they expected some level of maturity from us.  Accept their votes for Biden and shake their hands. When trump and his sycophants are gone, then we can discuss political philosophy. Until then, realize you are an adult and act like one.
Looks like the post office is dead while these fools are still debating about a crime bill. If Donald Trump win again remember you said you couldn't vote for Biden because of a crime bill and Harris is a cop who locked up criminals but wasn't supposed to lock up black criminals.
Restore dignity to the office of the Presidency.  Never Trump, Never Biden.  I’ll be writing in.  Not for sale 2020.

Things sure are different.  Back in the day, of Biden, Trump, Nancy and of probably 80 percent of Congress , the health of the auto makers told much of the story for the entire society.  Now I don't know.  Trump thinks its wall street, but not from my seat.
What does JOE BIDEN offer VOTERS ??
Oh my God !!! Hillary is back, "to help Joe Biden, in any way possible"????
Now more than ever it's true:  "It's not who votes that counts, it's who counts the votes"  Only way Biden wins is if the whole process is a fraud.
She’s garbage and it was a horrible pick Biden... This pick just elected trump another 5 yrs
I’m so angry about what’s happening to our Postal Service. We are being destroyed by villians — right before our eyes. I don’t give a shit about Biden-Harris in November — where are our patriots and heroes RIGHT NOW!
I don't think I get their defense. Since Biden said "little brown and black girls" could be inspired to have a higher office. It's ok to diminish a brown WOMAN?
Oh oh... actually I kind of like that she is coming out... no one likes her, not even the leftist democrats... this will help a Trump to garner more votes for him...  Hillary Clinton says she's ready to serve in Biden administration
Bless your heart, he's the President of the United States I doubt  covers his press conferences.     Has nothing to do with the Biden Campaign using my tax dollars to extend his 45 year career shaking down the American People.
'Q' is now the 'Tea Party' boogey man of 2020.    Defund   make the Biden Campaign pay for their own propoganda.
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden's Running Mate | National Review
. lead story was Biden suggesting a mask mandate (😲) rather rather than the record number of deaths. They're even bringing back Benghazi and Ferguson leading up to the election.   (Changing the channel before Nielsen ratings notices I watched. )
😂 yeah right, Biden doesn’t know what the hell is going on, I doubt he knows what day it is or where he’s at when he wakes up In the morning
Seizing on Masks as a Campaign Issue, Calls for Mandate. He doesn't get it. Not every situation requires a mask. Expert review reveals social distancing and using masks when distancing not feasible, plus wash hands. The best defense for COVID19
So Biden is Right wing? How far Left are you?  As for Dems, there are 2 kinds: The corporatists (think establishment), as you mentioned, and the communists (think AOC).
JOE BIDEN: Seeks National Mask Mandate
Reagan was 77 when he left office. Biden is 77 NOW, and already sounding mentally worse than Reagan ever did. Even the MSM may not be able to cover for him much longer.
I’m going be honored to 🗳 for you President Biden &amp; Vice President Harris in November 2020 Election...
#TheMaskedSinger  is over...Now, its the masked American  and according to biden, you should NEVER be unmasked
Absolutely not.  Look at a comparison of approval ratings between Hillary and Biden.
In what way is she moderate? Her views on immigration are radical. She is (and has been) authoritarian. She called Biden a segregationist and a sexual assailant when up against him and is now on the same ticket. Calling someone “nasty” isn’t sexist and if you think it is, maybe..
#baitandswitch.    Vote for Biden, get Harris at inauguration......

Joe #Biden was mentioned 17 times more at President #Trump's"#Coronavirus Briefing," than the actual virus in a 43 minute press conference there were two minutes and forty-eight seconds addressed #Covid19 and 37 minutes and 15 seconds on Joe Biden.  No new information was given.
The only war being lost is the Biden Campaign's floundering around looking for an issue...
Biden is a Moderate like I'm a Host at a Cheesecake Factory. (I haven't worked there in years.)
The USA will be rejoicing when VP Biden is elected President on Nov 3,2020
He is just looking for cover. He wants to hide out in the basement until the election is over.
The polls showing Biden ahead are laughable!
WoW! Hopefully they can avoid ole pervs like Chicken Joe Biden?
Kamala Harris exacerbates Biden’s existing problem with religious voters. He must work to reassure them.  there are many religions, &amp; we all don't vote b/c of our religion. I belong to an Orthodox Jewish synagogue, does that make me a "religious voter"?
Democratic Party Nominee: Joe Biden
Does it really matter, of all the vile things he’s done, it still doesn’t make one bit of diffrence. Nothing gets done, nothing will. I’ll vote for Biden, hopefully he wins, and trump will write a book, and make more money, and laugh in our faces.
Why are you attacking Joe Biden. SMH
Lol.  Feels like I wouldn’t have a problem with Biden if I did
Except it’s not propaganda.  Biden has literally talked about enjoying kids rubbing up his legs. That’s not propaganda. That’s someone who doesn’t understand what’s acceptable and what’s not
So I guess Trump is gonna win again since it’s apparently so morally corrupt to vote for Biden. Nice.
I don’t drink orange kool aid tho. I got no problem with people attacking trump for the pos he is. It’s the pretending Biden isn’t also a pos I have a problem with
Just an FYI.  Hating Biden doesn’t mean I like trump.  I hate trump too 🤷‍♂️
How does Biden’s policy make him equally dangerous??? Where are his ties to the KKK??? What are his conflicting billionaire-business-owner interests??? What are his connections with foreign governments??? What bigoted hateful misinformation is he promoting to our country???
Well that wasn’t part of the metaphor for a reason. By that logic you’re insinuating that a Biden presidency could potentially make everything worse than it would be if we stuck with Trump.
Because with Biden there is at least a CHANCE for something better than this!!!! If you were sick and someone offered you a pill, saying, “This may make you feel better or it may do nothing at all,” are you gonna turn it down simply because it’s not a guaranteed cure???
At the very least, even if Biden ended up being the exact same as Trump, at least we tried to get something better. If we end up with Trump again we already know what we’re stuck with.
I’m confused why you’re asking me to give a specific outline of why or how Biden is different than Trump as if it isn’t completely obvious???? I obviously can’t “prove” anything to you, we’d both have to wait and see.
Every 8 year old should be angry at Biden.  And every 8 year old should be angry at people thinking it’s ok he gropes them
We can only either have Biden or Trump. Choosing to have Biden rather than Trump does NOT mean that I fully support and agree with everything Biden/Harris say and do, it means I’m just choosing one over the other. But not choosing IS choosing to let others decide for you.
Again it seems like you’re insinuating that Biden is JUST as bad as Trump which doesn’t make any sense to me and if that’s really how you see it then idk what to tell you.
Joe "HITLER" Biden calls for Nationwide MASK Mandate. Fuck Him !!!! Have you forgotten Obama &amp; his Joe Biden. The Swine Flu for you dummies. They ignored it &amp; people died ????
If you really don’t see any difference between electing Biden versus TRUMP I really don’t know what to tell you. True, voting is not going to fix our problems but if Trump is our president for 4 more years it’s going to be a LOT harder for us to make the radical changes we need.
Biden and Trump are the only candidates that have a possibility of winning at this point. Either your vote supports Biden or your vote (or lack there-of) is indirectly supporting Trump. Regardless of everything else, ONE of them is going to be elected and you can’t not choose.
I’m not asking for general explanations, I’m asking for the people saying they aren’t going to vote to explain why they’re ok with letting Trump win again and why that’s apparently a better option than electing Biden.
The Corporate Media have made so much money hounding Trump for 4 years. Do they want that to end? CNN will collapse. MSNBC will collapse. WaPo will lose half their readers. Will an October Surprise actually come in AGAINST Biden?
I’m genuinely trying to understand. Do you really believe that electing Biden is no better than passively electing Trump for 4 more years??
I'm confused. Is  a radical leftist secretly pulling  strings to further a socialist agenda, or a moderate that's going to alienate the base and cost Biden the election? #BidenHarris

Hillary &amp; Harris, only better chance, Biden will back out at convention. We’re just talking about swing states, but I think Trump Pence will still win electoral.
But when Biden did it, the Very Next day, it was just a gaffe. Just ol Joe being Joe.
What is your plan, for everyone to not vote??? Ok then what happens when Trump wins again??? You won’t elect to hurt our people but you will let Trump get elected again??? Biden would hurt our people but Trump won’t continue to??? I’m just trying to understand.
How is the Biden accusation credible but not the 25 allegations against Trump not?
Sounds like you hear only what you want to hear.  Biden listens to others. He evaluates and he's not afraid to change his mind if their ideas are better.
But Biden has a cognitive decline?  What the f is he talking about?
Universal Basic Income and Medicare for all if Biden gets elected.    Democracy dies with the DemocRATs.  Mail in voting, it's not who votes that count it's who counts the votes.  Always was, always will be.
I don't see why it can't be both. Its not like they are stopping Biden by making the world know progressives exist in the party.
Wow. You might want to read what I said again and note that I am a actively trying to help Biden and get people not to vote 3rd party. The DNC isn't making it easy. They added Yang to speak at the DNC convention so it looks like the actual goal of this tweet has been achieved.

Sounding nervous, Donnie! Biden for the win November 3! 81 more days!
That's what happens when you buy a Biden ticket
The thought of Biden winning is beyond my imagination.  We somehow survived a President who hated America and was a radical Marxist/Communist, but Harris is far worse!
VP Biden and Sen Harris are the folks to do that. They will remind our partners in the world they are our friends and allies. They will and do embrace diversity and the amazing strength it brings to our nation. I will not sit by and ignore your hate, I will vote Blue.
You mean you can vote for Kamala Harris? Biden's days are clearly numbered. I expect a William Henry Harrison presidency from him.
another Lie by Biden
It makes her Indian!!! She was a horrible choice... Lots of Black people will not vote this year because of that pick... Biden lost the election😂😂
So they need to stop saying she’s African American... She was a horrible choice and this will lose the election for Biden
Biden is the lesser evil but still evil.
I’m pissed just waiting 3 weeks for a book sent from within my own state. If I was waiting on meds or a check, and I wasn’t already voting for Biden, it would be enough to change my mind. #TrumpKillsUSPS
It definitely is a slap in the face. You’d rather another 4 years of a literal Anti Christ instead of just sucking it up and voting for Biden/Harris. I personally don’t like her views but as VP she won’t have that much power.
homophobic and taken America back in policy virtually faster than any president. There’s no telling how much damage can be done in another four years. Biden *also* sucks but we just gotta keep holding ppl accountable to that for the next elections (at every level) we can elect-
Bruh!  Kamala Harris is getting so much more scrutiny because she is a woman. I *DO NOT* agree with what she has done and she should be held accountable while in office by us paying attention to what she and Biden are doing. But guys... trump and pence are racist,sexist-
Biden-Harris, Osoff, Blackman, Bryant are your leaders for a real future and everyone in Georgia should vote these names on November 3rd #gapol
He clearly wasn’t talking about us, but YES! I am voting for Biden Harris.
- you gotta give up the title of “Slow Joe Biden” I thought of a new name for him because he’s easily manipulated so it’s gotta be “Play-Doh Joe” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Do yawl really think Biden made the selection for his VP? Really? Come on now . He probably saw the selected name the first time he read his queue card script he read from whil talking with her.
Wings n things and I went big for 9.97? Biden ain’t gonna have prices like this ijs
You must be young.... I'm guessing 20s lol the she was enforcing a crime bill that the cbc help write along with Biden
Biden thinks he picked Elizabeth Warren as VP. ASK HIM WHO HE PICKED.
Biden, Harris lash Trump in introduction of historic VP pick
Yeah congrats for sleeping your way to the top Kamala!!  With married men no less. And suddenly Biden is not a racist sexual assaulter like you called him only months ago?
Yeah congrats for sleeping your way to the top Kamala!!  With married men no less. And suddenly Biden is not a racist sexual assaulter like you called him only months ago?  You libs would have no standards if not for double standards!
Let us not forget she made it tougher for miniorites and put a lot away just like biden did with his 1994 criminal justice bill.
What is sad is someone who is a pimp for the DNC acting like he has any morals or integrity?  Note your channel has no news of Biden's many gaffes - why? Because you are in the anal cavity of the DNC?
Stop worrying about the Dems and pack your boxes! We putting u out as soon as the counts r in! U sold your vp slot to the KKK, Biden &amp; Barris have a true work ethics behind them. History in the making #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica #DumpTrump2020
Fake Flake will be irrelevant after Trump destroys the Marxist duo of Chicken Joe Biden &amp; Kamal-toad Hairasz?
And I keep seeing all these people talking about how seeing Biden/Harris renews their faith in America and makes them feel pride in their country again. Really?? Seeing 2 corrupt cops being morons makes you feel more patriotic but the riots and protests of the last several months
It’s time for the right wing, extremist, fascist reign of  to end. Vote Biden/Harris &amp; end the carnage inflicted by Trump.
Joe Biden is a sexual predatory and almost as corrupt and incompetent as Trump. We should not be excited to vote for him. Kamala Harris imprisoned thousands of Black people on non-violent marijuana charges and she keeps them in prison for as long as possible to use them as slaves
You realize Biden is only 3 years older than Trump right?
Hey y’all. I am so tired of seeing all these tweets praising Biden/Harris. Like they don’t give a shit about you. We don’t have to love the democratic nominee the same way the right does. We need to hold them accountable for their action the same way we do with the right.
This is a tactical error. Soaring rhetoric from Biden-Harris followed by Trump languidly reading statistics.
Joe Biden Selects Kamala Harris as Running Mate -
Why would the stock market crash if Biden was elected President? It didn’t crash when he was elected Vice-President.
Biden introduces VP choice Harris; much history, no crowd
I never listen to never politicians; definitely not a combo like Biden and Harris.
Biden and Harris finally shut up.
We've been starved for this. Leaders, actual leaders.
Joe Biden is Presidential.
Biden is talking to us right now. Trump reads to us lol.   Seriously, he’s looking into the crowd &amp; we feel more confident that it’s genuine.  take notes on how to address your people my friend!
This suburbanite is voting Biden/Harris 2020
HAPPENING NOW: Biden and Harris have finally stepped out, in matching blue suits too.
WHEN Biden wins.
LIVE: Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris TOGETHER for the 1st time as running mates
Remember THESE Kamala Harris moments? | Five videos show why the Biden V...
Former  US  V.P.  &amp; US   Senator   Joseph   R.  Biden   made   a   excellent  decision   to  pick  U S  Senator  Kamala  Harris (D-CA)  for  his  running  mate !#BIDENHARRIS2020
Biden is forgivening student loans. They slow as hell😭
Media shows its bias &amp; hypocrisy by refusing to as ⁦ health related. questions
Yeah Fr it’s pretty sad Trump and Biden are our two options. But ig #SettleForBiden
Harris released a detailed plan to invest in HBCUs and black entrepreneurship. She formed a task force to combat racial and ethnic disparities in COVID. Biden says he will provide $300 mil in grants to cities that reduce discriminatory zoning regs. There’s much MUCH more too.
If any one person could give me a viable alternative to Biden/Harris I would immediately voice my support for it but the reality is that they are our ONLY option other than Trump. I hate it just as much as everyone else but that’s the reality.
Believe it or not I have the exact same feelings as you do towards the corrupt democrats, but as much as I hate it, Biden is the ONLY alternative option to Trump, no one else is going to be elected. We have to choose one or the other.
One of my biggest foreign policy questions about a Biden presidency would be whether he’d reintroduce “the pivot” away from China like Obama started to do at the end of his term. Foreign policy side of Twitter, let’s discuss. 👍🏼
I can't believe you fell for that LIE!!! Biden does NOT support defunding.   Do you even know what defunding means?!?
A day care center minutes before Joe Biden arrives ....
I just think we need more than 3 months to organize in support for a third-party candidate if it‘s to be successful. I’m sure that will be exactly what we do as soon as this election is over and we’ll have years to plan, but I’d like to be doing so under Biden rather than Trump.
You’re SO woke that you’re not voting for Biden/Harris but not woke enough to outline an alternative plan when people ask???? Ok so how about instead you just shut thE FUCK UPPPPPP!!!!
I don’t really want Biden/Harris either but until one of you geniuses can make an actual PLAN of action go viral rather than a complaint, they’re our only option other than Trump.
To say the election is over now is like saying the baseball game was over after the 1st inning.  Wait till Biden is Live and Uncensored on the debate stage.
I can't wait for Biden live and uncensored at a debate stage near you!!
Hey, all of my people (#Team43 🤠) came out in support of Biden... and that’s a known known!   🤣🍻
If you vote for joe biden unfollow me thanks
Who is Kamala Harris? A look at Joe Biden's vice presidential running mate
You know thats who the Dems are really putting up there...right? Biden didn’t choose her. Lol
Biden-Harris(Obama) sees this and thinks, "Hiw can we send the mullahs MORE CASH?"
Breakfast Club Reacts To Joe Biden Picking Kamala Harris As Running Mate
Forces in the country, and within the Democratic Party, were indeed pushing Biden toward a history-making pick--&gt;&gt;
me: biden and harris are great indicators of how little people in power actually care about those they claim to represent neoliberals:
This is bull shit on it’s face, Biden is a life long Catholic. What pray tell is Trump Bishop?
No I will not! Biden/Harris 2020 #RidinWithBiden
Good luck with this Lola but I fear it’s like spitting in the wind. Can you find some that aren’t regular voters to come to the Biden side?
You were my first choice, but Kamala Harris was my 2nd. Look forward to campaigning hard for Biden/Harris 2020 and Abrams for Governor 2024!
i support whoever i vote for. it’s wild to me that you’d “blame” voters instead of the oppressive system biden does not care about progressivism unless it’s convenient. what about him implies he listens? choosing a cop vp or saying “nothing will fundamentally change” if he’s pres
🤔 Misogyny from where? Certainly not the same people who were willing to accept Palin as VP.  Unless just standing against a Biden/Harris ticket is now equal to misogyny.
Oh Liz, you already had your talking points ready to go before Kamala Harris was named Biden’s running mate. All you had to do was insert her name Grade for you = F, for thoroughly lacking originality.
Just because the Biden Campaign controlled press does not report it, doesn't mean it did not happen.  Every DemocRAT supports this terrorism.  Every one of them.  If they live in your house, kick them to the street.
Notice how the wording has changed. The fake NYT diverging from the "African American" necessity to "Person of color". Their nuance is telling.  Kamala Harris Is Biden’s Choice for Vice President
It makes you wonder about the principles of the left.  Another example would be Harris herself calling Biden a racist and an abuser of women, but then accepting the nomination. Accusations only matter during the primaries 🤷‍♀️
Defund  another article which proves it is just the propoganda wing of the Biden Campaign.  Taxpayers should not be forced to pay for this crap.  The DemocRATS need to fund their own crap.
You'll be waiting a long time since you refuse to accept any new information, like the covid plan from January or the fact that Joe Biden's chief of staff Ron Klain ran point on Ebola virus.  Remember when there was a scary disease you didn't get because they did their job
What is Trump doing (and not just talking about doing)  One thing Joe Biden would do is open up the Obamacare exchanges for a special enrollment period for the newly unemployed.  Trump has not done that. Lynnie-Karen
I am currently quarantined in my house because my MAGAT father had a fever and I don't want to give this disease to the people I love.  I am a suburban housewife who is unsafe and Ridin' with Biden
You have to win first: What Joe Biden's pick of Kamala Harris tells us about Biden
Yes!  I don't see any boat parades for Biden!
This women was just accusing Biden of felonious crimes and now she’s praising him. Why I’ll never care for these political figures..
It may be snark, stating Biden is not catholic because of his stance on abortion?  Maybe.
i’m with you on that! all candidates deserve a place on the debate stage. she’d probably tear biden &amp; trump to pieces. she’s super smart and well spoken
You ppl are just the Nazi party of the US, it’s fine cause I know you already know this. But America is tired, so tired. I hope Biden doesn’t pardon Trump. He won’t be President forever and trump foundation will be what sends him to prison.
Ummmmm, Biden is as Catholic as the Pope.
Kamala hates Biden and you know it. Come back with something witty..The left’s hypocrisy knows no boundaries..
HRC was and is rotten to the core, Biden is gonna piggy back on 8 years behind obama to win it all just watch lol
In Biden's defense, if you had to pick your VP among all the Dems, who is a good choice?
That sounds like Biden.
How Biden selected Kamala Harris as his running mate
Would a President Biden put #KamalaHarris in charge of the gulags he's pressured to open up?
BREAKING: Joe Biden selects Sen. Kamala Harris as vice presidential running mate - TheBlaze
voting for biden like
Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate, first Black woman
It’s as if this bishop from a tiny diocese just excommunicated Biden. Should we tell him that’s not how it works?
but whatever i guess, now i cant support them bc a biden bro was toxic on the internet :(
Watching  while making dinner. YT asks me, “Can you take a poll to help our advertisers?”  🙄 OK, YT. “Which do you have a more unfavorable opinion of, Trump or Biden?” “Trump.” YT then proceeds to show me 2 Trump ads in the next 10 minutes. Slap your algorithm, YouTube.
We aren’t enemies, my dudes. But we are in an aggressively boiling melting pot that’s going to bubble over any minute now. I don’t know if Biden or Kamala are going to be our wooden spoon, but I do know they aren’t our saviors
There’s a reason the left isn’t excited about Biden. Mans ain’t it
Biden will make the order to arrest us if we don’t take the vsccine
It could have been a Joe Lieberman rebooted, I would still vote for Joe Biden!
Tulsi should’ve been Biden’s VP pick. #VPHarris #BidenVP
Biden and Harris=Birris or #BirristheVirus
Right you are. I’m not a fan of either Biden or Kamala, but they can’t do much worse than the current administration...we REALLY got screwed on this and the last election...
Warren is too fake and soft. I can't get over warren lying her way through life about the Indian stuff. I don't see how Biden stands a chance. The debates are gonna be a total shit show
My homie that works in DC was telling me she was the one they didn't want Biden to pick because it gonna be hard to attack her.
Kamala was an absolute dumpster fire as a presidential candidate and an unpopular AG in a liberal state. People in her own Party can’t stand her. Tulsi Gabbard was the move. Biden screwed up.
I think this analysis goes to the exact point for the Dems having picked Kamala as the VP. Biden is clearly unable physically and mentally  to campaign and even less of running the country. It’s now basically Donald Trump vs. Kamala Harris for president
“The current president is a science denying, racist, pedophile enabling, drug addicted murderer responsible for over 150,000 deaths BUT I am not happy about voting for Biden/Harris.”
biden better not drop out before the debates..
Don't get the Kamala choice. Tulsi would have been a much better choice. Still a bit too radical for me. Can't see this working out for Biden at all.
Biden's late to THAT party.
Ma’am, So proud of you and happy for your selection. Way to go, you will make a great team. I know you and Joe Biden will return our nation to the right path.
Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate, first Black woman
Yes, President Obama, let’s win this thing!  Our country needs healing and it needs healing fast!  I pray God uses Biden and Kamala in a mighty way!
She did accuse Biden of racism.  It was harsh.
I am guessing Secretary of State.  It will be a Kamal + Abrams ticket when Biden steps down.
Abrams will be the Secretary of State. So when Biden steps down in 2021, Kamala, P and Abrams, VP
"Joe Biden is not that smart." #BidenHarris2020
Joe Biden announces George Soros’ Vice President pick... There I fixed it for you.
So our choices in the next election are Joe Biden and The Syracuse Orangeman. Yeah I'm going to go downtown and see if I can get a crack head to run so I can have someone I feel can make a good decision.
Congratulations Senator Kamala Harris!! You and VP Biden will certainly get my vote!!
Neither did Biden’s the first two times. In fact, now that I think of it, the first two and a quarter times.
I’m on auto donate to Biden but I donated some more!!
So Soros finally told Biden who his replacement is.
Biden probably forgot about it 😂
In a move designed not to expand his base ⁦ taps #KamalaHarrisForVP....
Truth: I was anxious. Worried Biden would choose wrong. I am so relieved and happy!!!! #BidenHarris2020
I first knocked doors for Michelle Nunn. I gave to Hillary's campaign. I knocked doors again for Stacey Abrams. I gave more than ever before to Warren in this primary. I'm progressive as fuck and I am telling y'all, Biden/Harris is a ticket we all can support without reservation.
I feel you bruh but the overthrow won't come until we are old n gone...it will be MJ (my 5 year old) that will be apart of that revolution. Biden cabinet will say another about what the nxt 4 going to be like...Sanders and Warren from what im hearing will be apart of it.
your ratings are so bad you didn’t even get live coverage of your daily lie fest. The celebration of Kamala being named Biden’s running mate was much more important &amp; news worthy.
Flashback: ⁦ said she believed women who accused ⁦ of inappropriate touching
I think its a solid win...funny enough its blk men thats not happy with this pick smh..we are the lowest voting block anyways....as long as the black women vote in high number like they been doing Biden wins.
Thanks for reiterating what a great choice this is! I can’t wait to cast my vote for Biden/Harris - by mail!
Oh you misunderstand me. I’m don’t plan to rely on Biden for much. Restructuring our elections process imo is going to have to be something the people do, trickle up change if you will. I just think the priority is to get Donnie gone if we want any sort of positive change.
BREAKING: Harris selected as Biden’s VP pick
Still think Biden doesn’t have the black vote?! Think again  And, please stop digging around in the mud and throwing it at them. They’re a great ticket and YOU KNOW IT! The higher they go, THE LOWER YOU GO! 🤢
Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
Too bad Biden can’t speak though
There is the ticket  Harris: 'I believe' Biden accusers
Suspect Biden VP announcement timed opposite this hearing. Dems want this out of news cycle
and joe biden choosing a black woman just to prove he’s not racist or sexist when he’s said so much racist shit and i 100% believe tara reade.....like what the fuck
I really enjoyed Woody Harrelson's Biden, too.
Joe Biden made the perfect choice with this pick. She’ll be an awesome VP, inspiring heir apparent and brutal campaigner. We saw her eat Biden’s still beating heart on the debate stage. Now we get to see her go after Donnie.
i am so sad,,, i have to unfollow you bc the shittiness of biden has increased by so much,,, thank you for the jokes back when it wasn’t reality 💗

Remember this? 😆
Darn! We’ll never win in California! 😂⁦ taps ⁦
Please don't let this ride end 😂 #JoeBlow2020
To the people saying they’re not voting for Joe Biden now that Kamala Is the VP running mate, not voting for Biden is a vote for trump and we both know it. We gotta choose the lesser of two evils and in four years we’ll get AOC.
Representation matters #BlackLivesMatter #BidenHarris2020
Of course. Of course. Of course. Biden picks the only person as his running mate that would make me even less excited to vote for him.
Biden picked Kamala Harris as his running mate ??? Oh baby trump finna win
Joe Biden really picked Kamala Harris I think he trying to lose because as a black man Joe signed that war on drugs bill in 90s and now picks a woman that was locking black men up for sport in the 2000s. Bernie I need you bro 🤦🏿‍♂️
Biden/Harris huh!? Let’s go black women!
Right pick for the nation VP.  Joe Biden has done his part. Now it’s our turn to do ours by cleansing and reclaiming peoples house (White House) in November 2020

Outstanding pick! No question that  on the ticket helps Biden win down here in Georgia! #gapol
Biden chose Kamala Harris, whom I have read up on, and she is a lawyer, has a long record of respect for the law, and I think she wants access to the law to be more universal.

Endorsing Biden.  Speaking first night of convention.
He said WW2 instead of WW1. That's a verbal slip. It did impact the war's resolution. And it got going in early 1918, not late 1917, but that's minutiae. 90% of Americans can't name the years around WW1. And a high % of Biden supporters are willfully ignorant of his dementia.
These are Biden's leading VP contenders? I haven't seen this much baggage since the last time I was at an airport...
Oh sure, keep bringing up Trump's "grab em by the pussy" line like it was literal yet make every excuse for Biden saying nigger years ago. What hypocrites. Btw, Ben Shapiro's joking about that stupid song was one of the most hilarious things I've seen all year! 😂
I saw the video too.  Don't know why the agent didn't empty his sidearm into the guy.  'Death by Cop' is what the Biden voter was looking for.
Even Biden doesn’t think soGeorgia’s  will headline a Biden campaign voter protection rally urging Congress to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act on Thursday, the same day he’s set to receive the party’s presidential nomination. #gapol

That's for Biden
Idiot. Acosta is the WH correspondent.  With attention to the PRES.   Biden isn’t president yet.
No, you are an idiot for blindly believing deplorable unethical trump. Biden and Harris are a great team!
Oh I agree, they don't want Biden to speak freely without a script. But you'd be lying if you said Trump didn't ever go off his script and stumble through to get back to script and sometimes say rather ridiculous things.

Biden an anti Israel Presidential candidate, has Hutzpah.On Trumps historic Middle East peace agreement, claiming as VP he laid the ground work. What Biden, Obama did was sell out Israel at the UN! Obstaining on a vote condemning Israel!  Allowing Israel to be called  criminals.
Has there been a time in history, when Presidential, And Vice Presidential candidates, can have a press conference, say anything, with impunity? Biden, Harris are the answer. Make accusations, and leave without taking any questions.
I will gripe about Biden  I might even say stuff about Kamala  (Probably not since she is the first smart move Democrats have made this entire election cycle)  But I’m certainly not voting for more fascism racism and mass death  So vote like lives are on the line because they are
By selecting #KamalaHarris Joe Biden is assured of the Black votes, women's votes, perhaps East Indian votes (after having derided the E. Indian accent of owners of 7-Eleven &amp; gas station managers), may also get the votes of Arab people who have a similar sounding name as Kamal.
Biden and Harris at their first joint fundraising event spoke without telling a lie.  How is that for a change!   O'Donnel -The last word.
Biden better buckle up because he’s got a big mess to clean up. And the only way to clean up this time is real change. Americans deserve healthcare and to be able to vote from the safety and comfort of our homes! Let Trump close our post office we’ll use our computers finally!
I don’t pick Biden 🤦🏻‍♀️
Hey  &amp;  so, how will Joe Biden actually enforce the mask mandate &amp; jail people?  They are defunding the police, right?  Great way to continue to spread #Covid_19 : put together in a small space a bunch of people who didn't wear a mask. #halfbaked
All of us #NastyWomenVote and we'll vote for Biden/Harris!
Brett I hope if And when you interview Biden , you treat, and ask him the same very tough questions you asked of Jared Kudhner!
I am SO PROUD of you both, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. I was in tears when I looked at the two of you dancing with the young people. And yes, the two of you will bring REAL LEADERSHIP back to America. It is what American people have been craving! THANK YOU! ONE LOVE! Aliciadine
So, Joe Biden wants to FORCE everybody to wear a mask? He sounds like a authoritarian to me...
Kamala Harris said she believed Biden's accusers, she is now forever tied to a sexual assaulter.
With all due respect. Why can't  biden finish his term?? Who has made this determination?
wake up America!! This guy wants a Nationwide Mask Mandate and won’t even answer press questions! This is what a Biden presidency looks like😳 Biden is weak!!
I saw Joe Biden on a couple of episodes of Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego on YouTube.  Your friend Barbara Bush was on another episode of that show.
You can’t have it both ways. Do Biden/Harris want to abolish the police or do they want to “mass incarcerate America”? This is such terrible messaging it’s laughable
This whole rumour of Biden’s dementia and demise is something I only see on Fox News, and even there it is just opinion people saying they have heard this from unnamed sources. To me it smells like Fox trying to start a rumour to aid Trump in the election.
Sounds like Biden also disrespected his socialist VP as per WP
After Trump’s derailed campaign loses in November, I look forward to working with Joe Biden’s administration to bring heavy rail public transit into Gwinnett

Just like how people still support Obama and still want Hillary to be president, with all this real evidence coming out. Even their own people are throwing them under the bus as we twit, and now you see Biden as the great and powerful one. He really seems capable to you?
His own White House staff will be voting for Biden. They see it up front
What Republicans see = True  What Democrats see = False  it’s a Conservative meme so they truly think Trump is their Messiah but never work through their shadows in therapy so they project their faults onto others  my lefty feed contains MUCH Biden criticism but I’ll vote for him
I was surprised to see some of your base coming onto my Facebook page after I put Biden/Harris 2020 signs. I let them know in no uncertain times that you will not RUN MY PAGE! They are mostly white, poor, uneducated, gullible, ignorant people. These are the ones you CAN CONTROL!
Okay, so what is Joe Biden's excuse? That's exactly how he pronounced it today...
So the fact that Joe Biden just said her name wrong today at the press conference means what? Does he also disrespect his running mate?🤷‍♀️ You're reaching. 🙄
"But not Joe Biden. He's not that smart." That sh-t floors me every time I listen to that #PhonyKamala and #SlowJoe  ad...🤣🤣🤣
I don't like Kamala Harris but I'm a Democrat. So Kamala Harris  “could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody,"and I still will vote for Joe Biden.
They have literally no idea how to run against Biden and Harris, this is just hilariously embarrassing
you accuse Senator Ron Johnson of being in cahoots with Russia for denigrating Biden... are you in cahoots with Biden? Because all you do is spread his propaganda!
Pretty sure you would have said this about whoever Biden chose.  It's sad that conservatives are so unoriginal these days.
I got a theory Trump told Kanye to run for President so he could take away some black votes from Biden.. Politics is one big ass scheme.

Phony Senator Harris Comparing Ebola, and Biden’s response to , the eleven people infected. And prosecuting Trumps handling of Covid that is a world wide pandemic infecting hundreds of millions, and millions killed, is dishonest, something that comes naturally for the senator
It’s really rich to watch Biden introducing Harris by reading a teleprompter. He just said Trump has racist rhetoric 😳Roll the many tapes please!
Thank you and I too appreciate the respectful conversation as well! I wish you and your family the best and especially in navigating the school year and hope things go well!
Biden is pathetic! My favorite part- saying President Trump needs to meet face to face with Congressional Leaders as he hides in his basement!

I do have kids (one with asthma) and am enrolling them in a virtual school for this year because I don’t have confidence the public school systems will be given the proper tools to curb the spread.
Interesting you say this! This AM a little after 10 Fox News broadcasted a Biden Ad. I thought to myself... MSM Won’t ever air a Trump AD. Right out of the shoe Fox News aired a Biden Ad! Amazing 😉
links you directly to Joe Biden’s page. If Biden wins Soros and anarchy win. It will be the downfall of America
I don’t think we’ve learned anything definitive their ability to spread, except maybe they make up a higher % of asymptomatic spreading (i.e GA schools). What we do know is they can’t spread while learning remote with families following strict social distancing guidelines.
I’m hopeful it’s less dangerous but I also believe we’re still too in the infancy of our understanding of COVID to know. Even if it is less dangerous, kids can still spread like everyone else. And I don’t think we’ve taken the proper steps to have the BK employees back either.
Wait... is he campaigning for Biden now?
Didn’t say they shut down earlier, they didn’t. I do believe their shut down restrictions were more strict and enforced which helped get things under “control”. For GA where I live, we shut down and have opened up based on no signs we should have.
Yeah, ummm....this election is &lt;12 weeks away. People are vastly overestimating the chance of some massive overhaul happening
You forget that all those countries shut down and took the initial wave of cases seriously, the US did not. It was a coordinated effort to do what was necessary to stop the spread and then open slowly and with restrictions. We never got step 1 right.
Of course she is! She is a 🤥 her ideas and values are absurd! The contentious relationship she and Biden have will be very interesting! She will speak for him and take over! He is an empty vessel! She is a power hungry woman who will say whatever she thinks people want to hear🤦🏻‍♀️
We are ALL IN Joe Biden! LET'S GO! BIDEN/HARRIS IN 2020!
The fact that you see Biden/Harris as worse than Trump/Pence is instructive. For many of us, Trump’s moral, temperamental, ethical and mental unfitness for office represents an unacceptable risk to the republic and outweighs any other consideration.
What I'm confused a out is why these idiots seem to think Joe Biden will not be able to complete his term??? I'm mean if the lard ass, fast food never does a day of exercise ,can't walk down a ramp unassisted, or hold a glass of freakin water can manage! Biden will be FINE

Hillary called trump supporters deplorable. Biden said if you have a hard time deciding between me or trump then you ain’t black. Idk about the Harris quote haven’t heard it before.
So excited to support our Biden/Harris dream team!!
The Democratic base is getting stronger and wiser. And now with the Democratic ticket of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and ALL of the EXPERIENCE they each bring, we are NOW ENERGIZED! It may be a difficult race, BUT IN THE END WE WILL WIN!
Pretty much is the plan… Biden is just a front.
I am so excited to support the #BidenHarris ticket. Joe Biden is running to restore the soul of our country. To win this fight he picked a strong fighter- Kamala Harris has spent decades defending our constitution and protecting the most vulnerable among us. I am ready!
Biden/Harris is the ticket of austerity and foreign provocations. There will be the usual miserable moaning( 'there is no money for social programs') as the defense budget steadily climbs.
This suburban "housewife" will be voting for Joe Biden as will the other three people in my family.
There are now hundreds, if not thousands of people on my facebook, who are both Biden and Trump supporters. While I asked Trump supporters to NOT COMMENT because my facebook is a site to support Biden/Harris 2020 only, they still felt the need to comment. RESPECT MUST BE EARNED!
I didn’t know that Joe Biden is Catholic.  John F. Kennedy was the first Catholic president we had.  I do know that Biden was an ACME SenateNet agent.

D'oh! You're right. Biden is a practicing Catholic of the non pedophilia type.   No wonder Tobin overlooks this. He prefers Catholics who place brown babies in cages and white babies on laps.

I value your opinion so i want to know why Biden is the clear cut favorite for you now that kamala is on board but we can talk about it another day. Maybe you know something i don’t. So I find it intriguing. It’s others that feel the same way as you do.
Haha pop your Shìt! Kamala put Biden over the top now huh?? Why is that because she suppose to be a sister or because she actually did or plan to do something to help benefit black ppl?
the fact that people are bragging abt not voting for Biden-Harris 😒 it’s the not knowing/caring enough abt the electoral system and the importance of this election and young voter turnout for me
Biden/Harris makes Mondale/Ferraro look exciting..not a compliment btw.
This is true whether you want Trump to win or not. Biden backed himself into a corner and failed to gain any centrist footing in the process.

The reality that conservatives are trying to paint is harder to by with Biden.
Kamala Harris challenged Joe Biden in a debate and made him a better man. Rather than hold a grudge, he picked her as his running mate. This tells a lot about the man Joe Biden is - together they will make this country proud. I just contributed to their campaign. #BidenHarris2020

I loved Bernie and Elizabeth. But I'm not sure they'd be in the same position that Biden is now....
It was an honor to be on Senator Kamala Harris' Georgia Leadership Team.   It was an honor to support her then and is an honor to support her as VP. She is extremely qualified for this position and makes an amazing team with Biden.  Let's do this! #BidenHarris2020 #gapol

But when majority of voters don’t think Biden will finish a first term, it’s a play that could work.
If you claim you’re anti-trump but the first thing you did when Biden announced his VP pick is find dirt on Kamala Harris, you’re not anti-trump.
I don’t know how anyone who is serious about police reform could possibly vote for a Biden/Harris ticket. He wrote and she enforced the laws that led to mass incarceration of black men.   Jo Jorgensen is an option.
She has accused Biden of being a racist, said she believes his accusers(sexual harassment)-in addition to her filthy war on poor people while DA. What a great pick 😂
When you start leading the American people by wearing your mask consistently and daily, let us know. Otherwise, pay attention to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to see what REAL LEADERSHIP looks like. Compared to your record, a 2 year old could win! LOSER IN CHIEF/BUNKER BABY!

Ben Shapiro saying “wet ass p-word” and Harris being chosen as Biden’s running mate was just the kind of week I needed
i get what people are saying about her track record against crime, but i’m just happy that he picked somebody who will be able to eviscerate pence on the debate stage and maybe be a president who’s willing to listen to the people. she’s for equality and she’ll be good for biden💁‍♂️

I would like to announce that I will be Joe Biden’s VP and would also announce that I will be realist MF in there ✌🏾
If Biden is elected what is the over/under number of moths before the 25th amendment is invoked? I say 6.
CNN breaking news that Joe Biden has officially chosen a Vice Presidential running mate for the Democratic party and should be making an announcement as early as sometime today!
Hunter Biden settled $450K in tax debt within 6 days last month. Last year, he said he was too broke to pay child support.Biden was my next to last choice in the primary. I believe that, due to our electoral college system, only a binary choice is possible. Future elections and a needed national mask mandate can only happen if Trump is defeated. Voting for Biden is my last hope and yours too.

No, you are an idiot for blindly believing deplorable unethical trump. Biden and Harris are a great team!
I think Trump has been cognitively consistent for 4 years. You might say ok, consistently stupid, but still consistent. Biden today compared to Biden 4 years ago seems like there has been somewhat of a decline, he has more trouble finding words, and there is just something else.
He just endorsed Biden/Harris.

Fight in brothers. It’s just a warm up if Biden wins which would be a cold day in hell. But if the libs find a way to cheat there will be civil war in this country like you never seen. Then tell me who is going to get the best down not the right.
No the left are the raciest ones. Biden I will only pick a African American woman. That’s discrimination and Harris is descendent of slave owners all facts. So you tell me who the raciest are and hypocrites.
Yang, Gabbard, and Buttigieg were the only candidates I had enough respect for to maybe give them a chance against Trump. Right now a vote for Trump is a vote against Biden just like a vote for Biden is a vote against Trump.
Blame the Democrats for giving Yang like 10 seconds of time in the debates and Gabbard even less. Exaggerating, but the reality is that while I plan to vote Trump, I donated to both their campaigns bc they were not far left and also Biden is losing his marbles man.
Biden-Harris biggest fraud in history Biden broke the Equal Pay Act of 1963 Saying he pick a African American woman. Discrimination! Harris is not African American. Harris is a descendent of a family who owned 86 slaves. Who are the Raciest &amp; Hypocrites? Report the truth
If he loses, he will be escorted out of the White House by the USSS on the moment Biden is sworn in.
Never thought he'd endorse Biden
Biden screwed up on VP pick, I can't vote for Kamala. I am opposed to not voting, that is ultimately a vote for the winner. Abstaining only had meaning in parliamentary proceedings. Trump is a jerk and the GOP needs to be punished.  Maybe I go with the Constitution Party.
He's obviously voting for Biden then

So think of it this way. Biden Harris win. And gop wins house. Kevin McCarthy is now speaker. Biden “dies” and Harris becomes president. Kevin does not become Vice President. Harris gets to choose her VP. Which is a highly unlikely scenario.
I know this is from May 2020 but... Seems kinda odd...and convenient...and scary af. So, is how Harris/Biden can b polling ahead of  even tho VP Biden refuses to answer even 1 simple question? Seems like a way to interfere in &amp; steal an election🤔😳

Because of the green new deal they decided to run BIden off solar power which only gives him so much time before he needs recharge.  They should consider lithium batteries for longer life so he can take questions.
Biden will win we already know that. Your done
Trumps fine. Biden is not.
Seriously, I would like to hear one thing that Biden is going to do that has convinced you to vote for him!  He has been in political office for 50 years ans has done nothing.
Biden is leading in the polls now, according to the media. So if Trump wins, will you assume fraud? And, because of the assumed fraud, would you approve of forcefully removing him from office?
Biden being a guaranteed win was an exaggeration, I assumed that would be obvious since every media outlet shows him in the lead (like they did Hillary in 2016) but if my exaggeration was taken at face value that was not my intent. No media outlets have him at 100% chance.
And yet if Trump wins, every democrat is going to say they are sure it is due to fraud, there could be no other way. And so, of course, it will be important to remove him by force, and install Biden no matter what.
What I find funny about the situation is Dems that simply cannot fathom another legitimate Trump victory. Doesn't matter how much you say that Trump voters are silent until the booth. All they know is what the media tells them, which is Biden is a guaranteed win. It's crazy/sad.

We know Biden did not pick Harris for her political skills she has non. He picked her to be his Pit Bull attack dog. He knew she attack lie make stuff up about Trump &amp; basically be ruthlessl towards him. She is there to do nothing but attack him &amp; lie 24/7 along with the media.

"I don’t think he really cares about what a 30-something Pod Save America host thinks about him, and that honestly might be why he’s the nominee.”
This is why people don’t trust conservative polling...the answers choices’ wording and neglect to be unbiased by not even saying Biden’s name makes this so skewed and biased it’s unusable.  “I’m no liberal snowflake” vs. “Its West or Trump”? Give me a break.
Yea so your answer choices don’t even mention Biden and they are worded in a skewed manner which makes this poll incredibly biased.  This is why people don’t trust GOP/conservative polls.  “I’m no liberal snowflake” is by no means an indictment on Biden. You’re a disgrace
You don’t have to be crazy about him.  Ask yourself if you want 4 more years of trump and then happily vote for Biden.
And YOUR party makes a MOCKERY of ALL Americans and of the country, itself, in forcing a demented old man in Biden on us like we’re all too stupid to see it.
Biden asking to ware mask but nothing about Distancing. Because he wants to make sure the Rioters and looters face cover but still can burn and steal.

Biden wants mask for 3 month. We were right he wants to keep this virus live with mask no matter what so he can stay in basement not answering any questions. #Basement President
First Biden does not know what day it is. Harris is about the biggest hypocrite there is.  Biden probably does not even know who his running mate is. If he was asked a question he probably answer a question from two days ago &amp; Harris will just make up a pure lie.
Their tactic is to lie and smear and just make up total BS about Trump and his White House then duck and run.  Like the Taliban they make a surprise ambush then run away. Well that’s what Biden &amp; Harris are doing.
What do you expect the Dems lie about everything along with the left wing media.  Now Biden and Harris are on a totally lying smear campaign.  But they won’t take even softball question from the media.
“In a fund-raising email about Ms. Harris’s selection, Vice President Mike Pence -“this is YOUR Country, NOT THEIRS,” he wrote.
There are many more senerios she missed. 1- dems push mail in voting and results are tainted. Leading to dem protest then confrontation with Trump supporters, and basically civil war. 2- Biden wins Trump leaves but half don't accept results and civil war.  Either way, violence.

Personally I am thrilled that the ticket is Biden and Harris. Not that I would want them to win and not that I think that ticket can’t or won’t win, but considering we very well could have been looking at Sanders/Abrams or something like that I think we’ve dodged a bullet.
Real question. Asking cuz I’d like to know. Why is this president so afraid of mail in ballots? If everyone is eligible, why would it be harmful to HIS campaign &amp; not Biden’s?
I am SO PROUD of you both, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. I was in tears when I looked at the two of you dancing with the young people. And yes, the two of you will bring REAL LEADERSHIP back to America. It is what American people have been craving! THANK YOU! ONE LOVE! Aliciadine
If Biden stays in his basement why do we need masks.

And Biden mispronounced his running mate’s name. 🤔 But then, maybe it was victory for him to even remember it.

I would vote for Joe Biden as often as I can.🤣
Trump on Biden-Harris:  “They don't want to have cows, they don't want to have any form of animals."  Trump is confusing Biden-Harris for Bart Simpson.
Taking bets for how long before Biden refers to Harris as Hunter.
Can’t wait for real leadership BIDEN/HARRIS 2020
when it come this presidential election wanna be with yall but the differences between a biden platform and a trump one are significant enough for me to show up. if we get a plan to just deplatform the executive branch by november ill be there in a heartbeat, tho
With all due respect. Why can't  biden finish his term?? Who has made this determination?

Biden would get rid of cows? I know who Devin Nunes is voting for!
POV you’re 8 years old and you’re in the same Dairy Queen as Joe Biden
I'm pro-Bernie but am voting for Biden. The issue that progressives have is that Harris may be treated as the inevitable nominee if she runs for Pres after being incumbent VP with the "how dare anyone primary her" mentality even if she is technically not the incumbent. Same as 16
I saw Joe Biden on a couple of episodes of Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego on YouTube.  Your friend Barbara Bush was on another episode of that show.
Joe Biden says there have been three defining moments in his life:  1. Running for President. 2. Picking a VP. 3. "You know the thing". 😂🤣
You have Biden winning?
I agree. There are so many more, and clearer, reasons to object to her and the Biden/Harris ticket.
Pirro warns "something" will happen to Biden between now and Election Day.  # via  her sources have gone from “some say”, to “I have a hunch.” #FoxIsntNews
So TwitLer is just going to let Joe Biden lie and do nothing about it? Interesting.  But think about it: If TwitLer corrects this PROVABLE lie, then it will expose the MSM and Left for constantly repeating this, and we know TwitLER won't do anything to upset the Left.

Flipped on my Facebook account for a min, trumpeters now talking about Biden and Harris wearing black masks, suggesting a secret message to antica or their so called fantasy people they made up to fit the story.
They have now taken it down.. but not before ppl grabbed screen shots. Antifa is in bed with Biden 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️ #ThursdayThoughts
Did you forget about Tara Reade or Kamala's affair with Willie Brown. What about Hunter Biden? How about all the photos &amp; videos of JB getting handsy with little girls? 🤔
Team Biden and Kamala let’s make history
I have an 8 &amp; 11 yr old girl. It doesn't take Kamala running for VP to make them feel strong and confident. I have raised them to know how capable they are. Kamala is not a good example. &amp; Biden definitely isn't.
Just like how people still support Obama and still want Hillary to be president, with all this real evidence coming out. Even their own people are throwing them under the bus as we twit, and now you see Biden as the great and powerful one. He really seems capable to you?
His own White House staff will be voting for Biden. They see it up front
I was surprised to see some of your base coming onto my Facebook page after I put Biden/Harris 2020 signs. I let them know in no uncertain times that you will not RUN MY PAGE! They are mostly white, poor, uneducated, gullible, ignorant people. These are the ones you CAN CONTROL!
Trump attacks Kamala Harris over Kavanaugh hearings in first remarks since she was named Biden's running mate  via   VP pick Kamala Harris "is proof that Joe Biden is an empty shell being filled with the extreme agenda of the radicals on the left."
CNN Suggests Kamala Harris Will be President When Biden Decides to “Step Aside”   Not surprised by Joe Biden's radical pick for VP running mate being Phony Kamala Harris, who is expected to take over if Biden ever "wins" the presidency, &amp; later steps down.
The fact that you think Biden will win is laughable. You’re a complete clown show.
You are Dem operative and everyone knows it. To ever say you are a conservative is just a joke. You know Biden will be humiliated on debate stage
I don't think you people actually understand our rigged ass voting system.  Votes against Biden/Harris AND Trump won't have electorate pull.  Then what? He fucks us to death?  If you really wanted someone else, the work to be done was the last years - in a still frigged system 💩
Log on to see Romney trending and think he must have endorsed Biden.  Nope.   He is playing interference for the deep state and blocking subpoenas.  What’s he covering up?
I doubt Biden has ever sent a Tweet.
"Joe Biden Picks Black Vagina as Running Mate"
It must really suck to see Biden tweets with 300k likes and your tweets with 50k once your Russian bots were removed. Sorry bro.
Sign. Me. Up.l!!
Hey. I know logic and practicality escape you, and thats ok, but can you sell on Biden/Harris? Just let me ask you four (4) "why" questions and see if you can sway my vote to destroy this country. How 'bout it?
I missed the Biden &amp; Harris debut today.  What did I miss?
You should work harder, find a better job. It’s not trump’s fault or job. If you think it is, then you’re a liberal. Get it? It’s called capitalism. Vote for Biden if you want the government to help. Remember this is where they get high on power like they’re doing now, re masks
I will add I don't expect schools to stay shut down forever.  I just expect them to open and operate safely for all.  Based on verifiable photos we've seen from the past week, I think it's safe to say these schools have many improvements to make.
Anyone with sense would be upset at someone attempting to down play the potential spread from kids to adults.  Especially when it happened to them.  If your ACTUAL argument is there is such a small chance that it doesn't worth shut downs, ok.  But the possibility IS there.

Now if you have some proof to disprove my Covid results or otherwise, I’m all ears. Otherwise, I’d suggest taking some classes on how to hold a civil discussion instead of utilizing ones profile description to get out of a conversation.
If you took just another minute to click that twitch link, you’d see videos clear as day with my face.   I’m not one of these bots you been dealing with, I have receipts. Do the math yourself if you need to verify my comments about just getting over Covid. Let’s stay on topic.
The COVID result, the fact that I got it from a kid playing organized sports, or both?
I just honestly want to know how Biden got the nomination lol. Like, I honestly want to know how democrats could look at their candidates, and go for him. Like sure, he was Obama’s VP, and everyone loved Obama, but that was 11 years ago. Times have changed
Go to Antifa website and it takes you right to Joe Biden’s campaign. So it shows Biden supports Antifa and BLM outside of being a Racies. I thought this was Anerica and his pick was going to be a Black Female. If Trump said that the media would go berserk.
So.... are you saying you’re not voting for Biden?
Biden did the most raciest thing he could possibly do. In this country we pick people based on experience not race. But Biden picked a VP based on Gender and  color. So he said he would pick a woman of color. So it just shows he is a bigger raciest then thought.
Pretty sure you would have said this about whoever Biden chose.  It's sad that conservatives are so unoriginal these days.
I just got over a stint with COVID. I can confirm children do have a high enough “viral load” to infect others because that’s how we got it.

I got a theory Trump told Kanye to run for President so he could take away some black votes from Biden.. Politics is one big ass scheme.
I see the hate Biden campaign program is shaping up. It is hilarious, though, that the Cultists latch onto an imaginary defect while ignoring Trump’s obvious mental deficiencies.
That’s all the Biden campaign could afford to pay!
I was going to say (taking nothing away from Joe Biden, who does look presidential), so would most of us compared to the moron in the WH.
well if you go to search bar and type  it takes you to Biden s website. Wow #RIGGEDELECTION
Looking forward to the day when the Biden administrations AG subpoenas you for the criminal investigation of Trump that you most likely participated in.
At least Kanye still has his mind!  In actually feel sorry for Biden.  His handlers are abusing him on the National stage and it’s recognized as some kind of normal.  SMH
You don't have to constantly worry as a news channel that you are going to be broadcasting lies, and potentially life threatening ones, to the public when Biden and Harris are speaking. With Trump it's almost a certainty that it will happen
The Trump people who have been trying to question  competency can't be feeling too confident about how that attack will stick after watching Biden's speech introducing  as his VP pick. Biden's cognitive abilities are significantly better than Trump's
please call Biden-Hair Ass out on their lies. Biden speech today is despicable. Can’t let them win. Please remind people she is not Afro American
Katie people listening to Biden right now are screaming at their screens. Don’t let them get away with the lies they are spreading.
Thank you and I too appreciate the respectful conversation as well! I wish you and your family the best and especially in navigating the school year and hope things go well!

Biden is going in..... I’m excited to vote for him in November. He’s serving trump on a platter.
I do have kids (one with asthma) and am enrolling them in a virtual school for this year because I don’t have confidence the public school systems will be given the proper tools to curb the spread.
I don’t think we’ve learned anything definitive their ability to spread, except maybe they make up a higher % of asymptomatic spreading (i.e GA schools). What we do know is they can’t spread while learning remote with families following strict social distancing guidelines.
Everybody it's important to always have a sort of healthy fearful caution, if the data says things are getting worse then they are, but if it says they're getting better then the data is wrong  although sneak peek if Biden wins things might get better you'll have to wait and see
I’m hopeful it’s less dangerous but I also believe we’re still too in the infancy of our understanding of COVID to know. Even if it is less dangerous, kids can still spread like everyone else. And I don’t think we’ve taken the proper steps to have the BK employees back either.
Im not a republican but my parents are. They live in Pennsylvania and theyre voting for Biden time. How he handled Covid is the reason why. They’re older so they’re higher risk and they dont feel like Trump is taking it seriously.
Wait... is he campaigning for Biden now?
Didn’t say they shut down earlier, they didn’t. I do believe their shut down restrictions were more strict and enforced which helped get things under “control”. For GA where I live, we shut down and have opened up based on no signs we should have.
You were saying,
A perspective by the  (National Shooting Sports Foundation) on Kamala Harris and gun control.
You forget that all those countries shut down and took the initial wave of cases seriously, the US did not. It was a coordinated effort to do what was necessary to stop the spread and then open slowly and with restrictions. We never got step 1 right.
Biden can’t do it. Body and mind won’t allow it.
Don’t fall for it!!! Don’t let him draw support from Biden. We must be unified to defeat Trump.
Biden and Harris will most likely win (as long as Biden remains out of the public eye). Harris will replace him pretty early on and run for re-election in 2024. We won't have a chance to address the real issues until 2028 but by then things will likely be too late.
Kamala is running along side KKK Supporting Joe Biden. What an inclusive ticket the Democrats have arranged.
How many of you really believe Biden had anything to do with selecting Kamala Harris? Yeah, me either...

What I'm confused a out is why these idiots seem to think Joe Biden will not be able to complete his term??? I'm mean if the lard ass, fast food never does a day of exercise ,can't walk down a ramp unassisted, or hold a glass of freakin water can manage! Biden will be FINE
It’s a different between MAGA people and those who like Biden/Harris. Don’t give me that both are mean line. Do you then, sit it out.

Biden didn’t select Kamala fat left told him to pick her since she is real far left. Remember she said she wants to destroy Second Addendum  in first hundred days.
No they wont be.  Theyre sick of being trapped in the house because of your mismanagement of Covid.  They want out of the house and that means voting for Biden.
And in the mean time you are helping trump win reelection. You are helping RBG to be replaced by a right wing nut job. Biden wasnt my first choice either but he's my ride or die now because the next president will either be biden or trump.
Joe Biden didn't pick anyone, he was picking his nose when the Deep State chose Heels Up Harris
Honestly doesn't matter...Joe can debate or not...you can have Kamala or not...BIDEN WILL NOT EVER WIN!!!
TFW  gets to debate Joe Biden.
So Biden is better on economy?
Think I’m gonna skip this years presidential election, tired of choosing the lesser of two evils! I hate Kamala Harris and I hate Trump, Biden is just a dumbass in the way
I honestly don’t see how someone can vote for Biden especially with Harris. Moreover, taking polls at face value is a fools game.
The Democratic base is getting stronger and wiser. And now with the Democratic ticket of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and ALL of the EXPERIENCE they each bring, we are NOW ENERGIZED! It may be a difficult race, BUT IN THE END WE WILL WIN!
So Biden gets more than 400 EVs?
It’s ok not to like trump. But I believe he loves his country more than you hate him and he will do what he thinks is best for me and you like it or not . I couldn’t imagine Biden at the wheel . His problem would be , he wouldn’t know he is at the wheel
IF YALL WANT TO VOTE FOR TRUMP THAT IS ALL YOU GOT TO SAY. Don’t hide under “anti-Biden”.
You sound scared.... #placeholderjoe never planned on debate. Joe isn’t even campaigning.  He read from a script while taking to Kamala. We see Biden. He’s a big boy running for President- Time to step out in front of Americans and earn the vote. Dems planning #chaos
Dream on. It’s ok we know Biden doesn’t want to come out to play. #basementpresidentialdebates2020
They are going to have to be careful going after a black(?)female!  Stay on her record-Trump turn her attacks on him into him pointing out Biden’s many weaknesses-let Pence deal with Harris!  Just keep listing her record!
There are now hundreds, if not thousands of people on my facebook, who are both Biden and Trump supporters. While I asked Trump supporters to NOT COMMENT because my facebook is a site to support Biden/Harris 2020 only, they still felt the need to comment. RESPECT MUST BE EARNED!
dems are not gonna fuckin do shit.  biden's gonna make a law saying "it's okay to kill someone for protesting" and headlines r gonna be like "AT LEAST MR JOE MADE A LAW BEFORE BRINGING IN THE FEDS GOD BLESS AMERICA GOD BLESS DEMOCRACY"
No she doesn't, dork. I guess Biden's Catholicism is being conveniently forgotten then?
I didn’t know that Joe Biden is Catholic.  John F. Kennedy was the first Catholic president we had.  I do know that Biden was an ACME SenateNet agent.
"In this dystopian world, Kamala Harris sails above the presidential bar. Harris reflects something we take for granted in this circling of the drain we call politics in the Trump era: she looks and sounds presidential because she is" #BidenHarris2020
The big concern for me is that it seems apparent that at least some of Biden's crew, if not Biden himself, resents feeling like they had to choose someone like Harris--she's headed into a pretty toxic workplace with backstabbers aplenty.
I do not want to see civil war here by any means... But we have to face the fact we are already at war.. we are having a virus used against us and everything else..  Is the silent majority going to remain asleep if Biden does win and there is voter fruad or doubt on results?
I do know I haven't seen a single Biden flag, yard sign or sticker anywhere
God is calling on you Joe Biden to make the fabric of America right! To show people from ALL walks of life that the United States of America is a beacon for those seeking a better life! I proudly stand behind you and pray for you daily that you will have STRENGTH to GET IT DONE!
Anybody believe Biden had anything to do with the selection?

Why Trump may struggle to run against a Biden-Harris ticket  via
Post a couple Pro Biden Tweets, you should be fine.
Hold up, both of you. The "I would veto m4a" line is worthy of criticism because to VETO it means it already got THROUGH congress. That would be trashing a big win. Biden remains a better option than Trump. It's colossally stupid for him to threaten veto on prog legislation tho!
Second-greatest day. Seeing him refuse to concede but be ignored after Biden wins in a landslide will be almost as good as seeing him gone from the White House before Jan. 20 because he doesn't want to participate in Biden's inauguration.
Yeah, because those  ratings are through the roof. Biden does online town halls and gets 19 viewers. Unless  gives a press conference detailing her rise to the top - Willie Brown - no one would watch.
Glad to vote against him. Now, who had more blacks incarcerated in the US, Kamala Harris or Joe Biden?
Kamala Harris is the First Indian American to be selected to run for President after she gets rid of Mindless Joe Biden!!! And I thought they said they were going to nominate a Black Woman. Oh well, four more years...…...
I put a picture of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on my Facebook page, encouraging people to support them. I STATED CLEARLY IN NO UNCERTAIN terms that if you are a TRUMP SUPPORTER, YOU ARE NOT TO LEAVE A COMMENT ON MY SITE! Do you Trump Supporters read? Or are you ignorant like HIM?
Historic wisdom states that people do not vote based on the bottom of the ticket. I don’t think that holds true for this election. I was voting for  but I do feel better with  on the ticket. It shows that Biden respects her knowledge despite differences.
“He (Biden) caves to the extreme left whenever he needs to. Harris is way to the left of what Biden used to be, of course at the moment they’re kind of in sync. Dick Morris
I honestly don’t see a Biden victory after the Harris pick.
Biden represents Obama's legacy, there are enough blacks that will vote for him for him for that reason alone. He doesn't need help there. Kamala is there to appeal to suburban women. And counter Trump's Law and Order message.
You don’t have to very smart to be smarter than  So we’ll do ok with Biden. By the way Kamala has enough smarts for both of them
Bottoms. Why don’t you do your job as Mayor of Atlanta and quit worrying about Joe Biden. You’re responsible for an eight year old females death. If you are so smart and we know you are. Straighten Atlanta out
You overshot your shot, I said I care, I’m just not hell bent over politics. I know all about BOTH Biden/Kamala, I’ve interviewed them both just like Trump/Pence, though I interviewed VP.

Nobody is crazy about Biden we all had other candidates in mind but four more years of Trump we can’t survive that. There is no perfect candidate but this election is too important to not not vote or third party. Bite the bulletin vote Biden and them him accountable to policy.
That clip right there is full proof that Biden didn’t make the VP pick...
“personally spent time with leaders of both Israel and the UAE,” Michael Doran scoffed that “the biggest memory the Emiratis have of their time together with Biden” was when he had to apologize after accusing them publicly of having funded and armed jihadists in Syria.
Biden an anti Israel Presidential candidate, has Hutzpah.On Trumps historic Middle East peace agreement, claiming as VP he laid the ground work. What Biden, Obama did was sell out Israel at the UN! Obstaining on a vote condemning Israel!  Allowing Israel to be called  criminals.
Has there been a time in history, when Presidential, And Vice Presidential candidates, can have a press conference, say anything, with impunity? Biden, Harris are the answer. Make accusations, and leave without taking any questions.
Biden blames Trump for all of the lost lives due to COVID.  So by his rationale, if he had been President and didn’t close the borders (as he ridiculed Trump for doing) he would have been responsible for 1-2 Million American lives lost!
Has Joe Biden, or Donald Trump for that matter, taken a stance that I’m not aware of on transitioning children?
Vote for Biden because he is decent, qualified, experienced and can restore NORMALCY to this country... you don’t have to like or love someone to hire them to do a job for you.  Americans need to GROW UP!
History has been made! Congratulations Kamala Harris on becoming the VP nominee. You represent every woman of color. I know you will do us proud!!!  #pwreign #politics #BlackWomen #BlackWomenLeadVP #BlackGirlMagic
Biden asking to ware mask but nothing about Distancing. Because he wants to make sure the Rioters and looters face cover but still can burn and steal.

I will gripe about Biden  I might even say stuff about Kamala  (Probably not since she is the first smart move Democrats have made this entire election cycle)  But I’m certainly not voting for more fascism racism and mass death  So vote like lives are on the line because they are

There are many more senerios she missed. 1- dems push mail in voting and results are tainted. Leading to dem protest then confrontation with Trump supporters, and basically civil war. 2- Biden wins Trump leaves but half don't accept results and civil war.  Either way, violence.
Exactly. Not even Biden/Harris can tell you how. And they won’t. They’re betting on fear mongering for their votes. Not actual solutions. #BLEXIT2020 #BLEXIT
By selecting #KamalaHarris Joe Biden is assured of the Black votes, women's votes, perhaps East Indian votes (after having derided the E. Indian accent of owners of 7-Eleven &amp; gas station managers), may also get the votes of Arab people who have a similar sounding name as Kamal.

Can you translate what Biden was saying? Your candidate loves to fondle children and is a child molester.
And Biden still leading. WTF
Hey  &amp;  so, how will Joe Biden actually enforce the mask mandate &amp; jail people?  They are defunding the police, right?  Great way to continue to spread #Covid_19 : put together in a small space a bunch of people who didn't wear a mask. #halfbaked
All of us #NastyWomenVote and we'll vote for Biden/Harris!
It’s a condensed convention and not everyone could be up there. Beto isn’t there either or Katie Porter so many I would have loved to see or hear. They had to pick key ones that would be most impactful to Biden and Kamala to win. It’s nothing personal.
Brett I hope if And when you interview Biden , you treat, and ask him the same very tough questions you asked of Jared Kudhner!
. You have this election in the bag. You’re only thing that stands between us and four more years of total incompetence. Hopefully this call for a three month mask mandate while OUTDOORS is not a sign of even dumber ideas to follow.
I only listen to real leaders who believe in science and follow advice of experts. That’s why I am ignoring this  IMPOTUS Dotard and listening to Biden and will also be voting for him to take over for this 🤡 in November.
Only Trump could kill 160,000+ Americans. Biden wouldn’t do that
So, Joe Biden wants to FORCE everybody to wear a mask? He sounds like a authoritarian to me...
Stop this already! ✋🛑 The condensed convention roster has been chosen this isn’t Biden’s first rodeo. Move on! We have an election to win enough of the nit picking. Over this noise!
I don’t want to hear any more whining about convention it’s condensed &amp; this isn’t Biden’s first rodeo they know who they need to speak to win. So either get on bored &amp; back the current nominee, or get the hell out of the way! We have an election to win no time for this noise! 👊
I would vote for Joe Biden as often as I can.🤣

This whole rumour of Biden’s dementia and demise is something I only see on Fox News, and even there it is just opinion people saying they have heard this from unnamed sources. To me it smells like Fox trying to start a rumour to aid Trump in the election.
I agree. There are so many more, and clearer, reasons to object to her and the Biden/Harris ticket.
Why is it totally OK if Biden (HER RUNNING MATE) mangles her name but you find it offensive if a conservative host, without malice, mispronounces it?  You clowns in the biased media are the disrespectful.

Republicans are so worked up about "dead people voting" even though there's no evidence of that happening since JFK in 1960  but "dead man tweeting" political propaganda is perfectly OK!  Nice work honoring the legacy of the man you claimed to care about
What Republicans see = True  What Democrats see = False  it’s a Conservative meme so they truly think Trump is their Messiah but never work through their shadows in therapy so they project their faults onto others  my lefty feed contains MUCH Biden criticism but I’ll vote for him
CNN whines that Trump and Carlson mispronounced Kamala’s name but does not mention that Joe Biden mispronounced it AFTER nominating her.  THIS is CNN.
So the fact that Joe Biden just said her name wrong today at the press conference means what? Does he also disrespect his running mate?🤷‍♀️ You're reaching. 🙄
Log on to see Romney trending and think he must have endorsed Biden.  Nope.   He is playing interference for the deep state and blocking subpoenas.  What’s he covering up?
Really tired of seeing people complain about how much time they are getting or who isn’t speaking at convention. 🙄 This isn’t about one person or their platform, it’s a condensed convention and it’s about the Dem party as a whole. Biden has chosen key speakers for a reason. ✋
"But not Joe Biden. He's not that smart." That sh-t floors me every time I listen to that #PhonyKamala and #SlowJoe  ad...🤣🤣🤣

Disagree. As someone who has lived in Ohio Kasich is popular with both Dem &amp; GOP. If him talking can sway voters in this very key state it could be the thing we need to get Ohio blue. Biden knows what he is doing. This is about the whole party beating Trump in Nov.
I missed the Biden &amp; Harris debut today.  What did I miss?
Honestly he should be. Having a GOP at the convention going to vote for the Dem is huge and he is popular in a very key swing state of Ohio. Him speaking to explain why he is picking Biden over his own party in hopes of swaying others is very important and deserves time.

Yeah, ummm....this election is &lt;12 weeks away. People are vastly overestimating the chance of some massive overhaul happening
You were saying,
The fact that you see Biden/Harris as worse than Trump/Pence is instructive. For many of us, Trump’s moral, temperamental, ethical and mental unfitness for office represents an unacceptable risk to the republic and outweighs any other consideration.

Maya Rudolph reacts to Kamala Harris as Biden's VP pick, her SNL return
Biden didn’t select Kamala fat left told him to pick her since she is real far left. Remember she said she wants to destroy Second Addendum  in first hundred days.
Because, Biden is much better for this country than Trump is.
How on earth did you come to such a ridiculous conclusion?Are you unaware of what is happening in America right now?She’s actually a great pick for Biden &amp; will help him win.3/4 of America hate trump &amp; even his own party is pulling away from him, albeit quietly. Educate yourself!

I am so excited to support the #BidenHarris ticket. Joe Biden is running to restore the soul of our country. To win this fight he picked a strong fighter- Kamala Harris has spent decades defending our constitution and protecting the most vulnerable among us. I am ready!
Biden/Harris is the ticket of austerity and foreign provocations. There will be the usual miserable moaning( 'there is no money for social programs') as the defense budget steadily climbs.
This suburban "housewife" will be voting for Joe Biden as will the other three people in my family.
A really important watch for anyone like me who is disappointed in every presidential ticket up this year. TL:DR- This won't bring change, it will beat Trump. Change is still a fight.  Let's talk about the Biden Harris campaign and what it means for us....
No she doesn't, dork. I guess Biden's Catholicism is being conveniently forgotten then?
Is this a safe space? *whispers* I wish Biden picked Stacey Abrams instead
The big concern for me is that it seems apparent that at least some of Biden's crew, if not Biden himself, resents feeling like they had to choose someone like Harris--she's headed into a pretty toxic workplace with backstabbers aplenty.
I do not want to see civil war here by any means... But we have to face the fact we are already at war.. we are having a virus used against us and everything else..  Is the silent majority going to remain asleep if Biden does win and there is voter fruad or doubt on results?
I do know I haven't seen a single Biden flag, yard sign or sticker anywhere
Isn’t Biden Catholic?
Interesting. No, really. Something to keep banging the drum on. I am also concerned about these republican "allies". However, I have more faith in Biden.
Nasty suburban housewife here and I will not be voting for you! I am all in for Biden and Harris and couldn’t be more excited to vote for them in November requesting my ballot today! 👊 #nastywoman #suburbsforbiden
The whole Tara Reade thing self-imploded without Biden doing a thing. We're supposed to give the accuser the benefit of the doubt. I believed Reade too until all her lies and grifts came out. No one has yet to prove that Trump's 2 dozenl0 accusers were lying.
Glad to vote against him. Now, who had more blacks incarcerated in the US, Kamala Harris or Joe Biden?
She's literally willing to throw away what little rights she has left, and for what? Trump has been systematically removing every right gained under Obama/Biden &amp; yet she seems to be okay with that. If he gets to stack SCOTUS, it's all over, &amp; again, she's apparently ok with that
Its interesting how these anti-Kamala and anti-Biden replies always blow up while its the middle of the night in the US. Putin's scared.
Historic wisdom states that people do not vote based on the bottom of the ticket. I don’t think that holds true for this election. I was voting for  but I do feel better with  on the ticket. It shows that Biden respects her knowledge despite differences.
Want some truth? Harris went after Biden and he didn't go all fragile, male ego, snowflaking on a podium over it. He decided she should be a voice in his campaign and his government. Gee, imagine that. Y'all might want to man up &amp; see if it's possible for you to grow some balls
I honestly don’t see a Biden victory after the Harris pick.

You live in a bubble. Not knowing the VP Biden is a practicing Catholic is proof of that.
You don’t have to very smart to be smarter than  So we’ll do ok with Biden. By the way Kamala has enough smarts for both of them
Yes man! We are so ready..! Thank you Dr. Jill Biden!
She was def the best candidate for presidency,  i predicted this from day 1. Too bad Biden will get slain in a debate. He doesn't represent the party. Party should run the best candidate that represents the following, Good night sleepy Joe, Landslide , good night!
Biden should have picked Tulsi.  Then I would have been worried.  Not so much now.  Either way,  is the winner.
From this moment on, anyone who isn’t on board with Biden/Harris is noise and I have zero time for that I am all in focused to get them elected! Stay focused peeps and tweet responsibly to the cause and let’s win this! 👊
the fact that people are bragging abt not voting for Biden-Harris 😒 it’s the not knowing/caring enough abt the electoral system and the importance of this election and young voter turnout for me
“Normalcy” back to today’s America. Especially when their own choices are completely erratic and turbulent. This election is gonna be such a mess and I was sure Biden would win before but now with Kamala with him, they’ll be “”””lucky”””” to win.
Biden’s “return to normalcy” is just atrocious, tone deaf, and ignorant. Besides the fact that America has never been good, it is naive to just say “all of this will go away” when trump is gone. He has impacted media so insanely that there is no “going back” everything will-
-transparent. People aren’t fucking stupid they see that the two had no chemistry, they’re gonna see this as her trying to get into the WH, they’re gonna see this as Biden trying to save face with moderates. Because that’s what they’re doing it’s not hard to read. It’s so nasty
She lsaid on stage that she believed in the woman who filed sexual assault charges on Biden. Called him a segregationist. Called him out on his racism. And then proceeds to run with him, because morales don’t actually matter to her, what matters is getting into the White House
He’s always stood like that. Unless he’s had dementia since he was 18, there’s not really any evidence to support that crazy theory...Joe Biden on the other hand...
Brilliant.  In Biden’s own words...
I know right, she must think a lot like Biden. She’s basically saying black people can’t be politically diverse. Incredible. The hypocrisy, the racism, so obvious.
Biden literally could not have picked anyone worse. Of course the fact that he picked a woman of black and indigenous heritage is a good thing, but she literally is so flippant, put thousands behind bars, and a complete hypocrite. I hope whatever they’re going for works but ffs

The GOP is dead in America! We're supporting Biden/Harris!
You're a ride and crude embarrassment to the people you are supposed to be serving. We will be supporting Biden/Harris!
We are happy about that! Proud to support Biden/Harris!!
If you think Biden’s platform is “I’m not the other guy” you’re not paying attention. Parties come and go but there will always be two. I didn’t vote for Biden in the primary, and I stand by that decision, but I will not be complicit in giving this fascist wannabe another term
The reality that conservatives are trying to paint is harder to by with Biden.
Just from my short time living in Georgia it's wild. I've legit seen Biden stuff in Alpharetta. Not a *lot*, but damn sure more than I ever expected before moving out here with my preconceived notions.
I stand by what I said. Nobody outside of his base believes that Joe Biden is a Marxist.
If Biden wins and Kamala Harris becomes our VP, it will be an Obama moment for me #BidenHarris2020 #happytears
Really? Biden holds his faith dearly, you can’t determine is he is or isn’t Catholic. Plus, you’ve lived without one in the whole house for 3 years... that’s... Sad.
A brave, bold choice for sure. This should encourage Americans from any background to run for office and make their voice heard! It will be interesting to see how this campaign pans out. #KamalaHarrisForVP
Biden/Harris &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Trump/Pence  Voting third party is the same as voting for Trump. This shouldn’t even be a conversation
I loved Bernie and Elizabeth. But I'm not sure they'd be in the same position that Biden is now....
Thank God Biden didn't chose Bottoms maybe now she'll take care of Atlanta as she elected to do. However in my opinion I doubt she will
Don’t forget that Kamala is a Law &amp; Order VP. Something  knows nothing about. I know Biden will pick a real Attorney General.
It's kinda weird.  was not my pick among Dem Presidential candidates. But she was my #1 pick for Biden's VP. She checks all the boxes. Great pick!
You’re so inspiring. I had hoped it was you, but will show up to do my part for Team Biden in November.
If you claim you’re anti-trump but the first thing you did when Biden announced his VP pick is find dirt on Kamala Harris, you’re not anti-trump.
I don’t know how anyone who is serious about police reform could possibly vote for a Biden/Harris ticket. He wrote and she enforced the laws that led to mass incarceration of black men.   Jo Jorgensen is an option.
She has accused Biden of being a racist, said she believes his accusers(sexual harassment)-in addition to her filthy war on poor people while DA. What a great pick 😂
I guess #phonyKamala doesn't “believe” Joe Biden’s sexual assault accusers anymore...🤔
What’s wrong with Kamala Harris? Probably better than Biden himself.
Yes. But now they are best friends. Just like Obama and Biden.
I am definitely voting for Biden/Harris...we need to move on from the caveman mentality!
Since 2016? How many women aborted for him? He used to be pro-choice until he decided to hijack the Republican Party. He has no values, no political ideology. The guy is simply playing Americans. Biden is a better Christian
Please. We are between a rock and a hard place. Trump is the hardest place. As a Sanders supporter, I beg you, make that choice for Biden because I fear that we may not have another chance. 😰👊🙏💪
This exactly. Harris isn't perfect, but she's a whole lot better than pretty much all our other options atm, and she sure af is better than keeping our current president in office. And even Biden is better than what we have now. Not by much, but still.
Biden just LOST my vote FR!!! Do your research people and I mean VERY VERY Well 😳

Will start gofundme for bail money hang on lol
Biden takes no questions, gives no interviews that are not preprogrammed. He appears only in very short, controlled segments, but visibly suffers from dementia, with its characteristic hair trigger angry outbursts.  The Leftist Media protects him.  I tremble for our future.
I’m not sure if you’re being tongue-in-cheek here, Scott, but many a truth is said in jest.   2021 is likely to be worse than 2020. If Biden wins, we’ll be longing for 2020.

Biden literally is offering NOTHING period. He’s running a Hillary 2.0 campaign of I’m better than Satan. That’s it. I don’t expect him to support a  $2000 ubi, cause he’s a corporate tool. But the least they can do is offer at least $750-1000/mo ubi til the pandemic ends. Nope!

Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden’s Running Mate
I pray to god Kamala Harris proves me wrong and she does everything humanly possible to push Biden to systemic, structural change to restore power back to the people and lift up their lives. History since Clintonism infected the party tells me she won’t, as Obama didn’t.
For Obama, a textbook narcissist, Biden was always perceived as a buffoon who couldn’t protect Obama’s precious legacy. Obama embraced Joe only to preclude a Pres. Sanders, with the understanding Harris, Obama’s acolyte, would have extraordinary power even before Joe steps aside.
I wouldn’t call Biden/Harris that.... maybe some other words but okay!

If you think we were doing any better economically before Trump your a retard. That’s the tweet. Kamala Harris is a fraud do your research she might be worse then Joe “I don’t make sense” Biden.
Old but true. Not sexist. Biden is also a phoney, painting himself as a Progressive AND a Moderate like he can actually be both.
Which means a quicker demise w/Trump or the continual, slow march off the cliff w/Biden. That’s the choice we face in November. We know this bc Biden has told us nothing will fundamentally change under his administration except better decorum. Almost time to say good night Lucy!
This is the continued future of America with Trump or Biden. This is the predictable result of decades of neoliberal policies by both parties. But as I’ve said many times we deserve this corrupted government and all of the damage we get. We are the architects of our own demise.
Ok. After not voting for Biden/Harris &amp; leaving to chance that Trumpandemic might be re-elected, what’s the move? Not necessarily your plan but the plan of someone who is thinking this way &amp; spewing misinformation about this candidate? Are you voting for Trump by default?
Kamala Harris was hand picked by the Democratic establishment so she can become president when Joe Biden dies in office if he gets elected. I don't have facts to back this up, but I wouldn't be surprised if that was the case.
Biden is such a beta donk
Vote Biden.  45 must be defeated no matter what. Not voting or voting third party just helps 45.
Some one will be in office in November. A knee will be on our neck in November. Biden doesn’t have the thirst for murder like Trump. He’s lost too much( family). We’re faced to look into a man’s eyes &amp; see his heart. Or do nothing. For our children. Not even for us.
All that I can say is that I’ve seen Trump. Forget about him being racist &amp; his lineage to the KKK he’s radically incompetent. With that being said by the process of elimination I’m voting for Biden &amp; Harris so as to not leave open the possibility that #Trumpandemic continues.

Birds of a feather lose together. Biden could have picked the Pope as a running mate and he would still lose because he sold out his country when he committed treason giving Iran a sworn enemy billions of our dollars.
Its the truth tho isn't it? Biden made a big deal about wanting to pick someone based on their gender and race. Why? Its also obvious that the  is counting on ppl voting for her instead of him.

Honestly fuck both of the candidates and both of the VPs 💯 All of em slimey and ain’t shit. The only props I give to trump is at least we know what to expect out of him. Biden snakey and we can’t trust him. Kamela knows what to say to get black votes but she aint shit either

Biden just mangled it.   I doubt he gets it right 1 time out of ten going forward.
Turned on  long enough to witness the NOT AfricanAmerican Veep pick figuratively blow Joe by claiming to know Beau &amp; witnessed “most beautiful love between a father &amp; son”. It was so disgusting I had to turn it off. Shameful how they try to capitalize off Biden’s dead son

That is unless Joe Biden does something I think he’s constitutionally incapable of doing, first admitting he’s wrong, and second grow a pair of testicles and defying his donors, and to get the rest of this corrupt donor ass kissing cabal to go along with him. Not gonna happen!
I'm assuming that she was the only one who agreed to do it, the rest not wanting to have their names tainted by being associated with Biden.

Also, trying to play nice won't make the left, or Harris, or Biden hate you and your constituents any less.

Maybe Biden could teach Trump how to be racist because he's don't it all wrong.
He’s confessed to this multiple times before he “won” the nomination and since he won it. As Jill Biden said, you should just hold your nose and vote Joe. Unspoken in her statement, don’t expect us to do anything other than what we’ve done his entire career, serve the donor class

Interesting how everyone is celebrating Biden/Harris as if they've already won. That needs to stop. It was people acting like that with Clinton/Kaine that ut us in this situation to begin with. Celebrate AFTER a win, not before.
I’m an American who believes that black lives do matter. For that reason, I could NEVER vote for Biden. He helped write the 1994 crime bill that locked up black fathers (over pot &amp; stupid crap) &amp; Kamala spent her career locking up black Americans. I’m voting for President Trump.

The excitement of seeing Biden and Harris running together to get us out of this pandemic mess.  I want to stop the bleeding of our soul. It doesn’t matter whether they’re conservative or progressive, they matter to me.
EXACTLY! Even if she did, Biden's obviously "over it," so why should they even care? I think this clearly shows that they're so scared out of their wits; they're scrambling for "traction," &amp; "grasping-at-straws!"
Wasn’t Harris always Obama’s candidate, back when he was discouraging Biden (“You don’t have to do this, Joe”)?  But Harris couldn’t even win the Democrat Primary; so, Obama plotted this bait and switch.  #VoteRedToSaveAmerica   #HarrisIsTooRadical

I think Harris will bring the energy in spades that they claim Biden is lacking. It’s a shame she can’t debate Trump!
So does anyone else think that #BidenHarris2020 is merely a Democrat ploy to get her into the White House and then have Poor, Creepy ol' Joe Biden deemed unfit for president? #Trump2020 #MAGA2020
And if she fails to respond to our demands &amp; push Biden hard for concessions she’ll all but know she need not even suit up for ‘24. As  said on  show, progressives are on the rise. The monied interests are scared shitless now. 3 or 4 more big wins  &amp; they’ll fold
has this exactly right. I’m not Voting in support of Biden, but hand the office to the person who can be accountable and will respond to pressure. Harris wants to run for Pres. The more and relentless pressure will have a definite impact on her in 2024.

Don’t get me wrong, Trump is Satan as far as I’m concerned and HAS to be removed. But that doesn’t mean this country was all daisies and roses under the previous 4+ decades run by Democratic and Republican neoliberals, which includes Biden’s policy influences as well.
If you don’t believe Biden is a bait &amp; switch guy I suggest you take off the rose colored glasses &amp; do some research on his 40+ year political career. Your children’s future depends on you being a more informed voter. Anyone taking these people at their word in 2020 is troubling.
Young people backed Bernie over Biden for a reason, because they’re informed on the issues affecting their present &amp; future. After witnessing 30+ years of Clintonism running this party, and understanding Biden as a full throated supporter of Clintonism, my cynicism is warranted.
Now you understand where I’m at in this election. I’m cynical because the facts dictate I be. The money &amp; power in the Democratic Party didn’t line up behind Biden &amp; against Bernie because they believe he’ll do the right thing &amp;:pass progressive policies. We’ll have to make him.
I will vote for Biden because he’s not the Satan in the White House. Would I love it if he fought for the policies hes putting out, yes. But I’m prepared to go to battle with him if he doesn’t. There’s no more going home the day after the election, the stakes are way too high.

Biden risks alienating young Black voters after race remarks
As  said on #seeingamerica , she’s voting for the person she wants to hold accountable. Make no mistake, with Biden’s well documented affinity to neoliberalism and general conservative disposition on, we’re going to have to fight like hell to win this battle.
I want Biden to win. But if we think that’s all it’ll take to correct the fundamental, structural problems this nation faces, you’d better think again. As Hannah Nicole Jones said on Megan Rapiopnoes new show, Seeing America, her worst fear is people will go home if Biden wins.
Now, predictably, the establishment came together to force in the nation a Bidendy nomination to try and restore the system as it existed before 1/20/17, as Biden proudly proclaims that his only goal as president. And the failure to understand THEY caused Trump continues.

A few things just from the tweet without reading the article: 1. No he won't be 2. If he was, it would be great 3. Democratic Party wanted to pick Biden as the moderate choice. We told you it didn't matter because he'd be painted this way anyway.

US officials: Russia denigrating Biden ahead of election
You think Biden isn't racist? Anyone who says Trump is mentally incompetent, but supports Biden has serious issues (hypocrisy). What did Obama do for black ppl? Trump had lowest black unemployment &amp; undid Bidens law which prisoned more black people way too long. Learn history.
Yeah, right...Russia would rather have a very strong Donald Trump in office rather than a weak, addled, puppet like Joe Biden.  Have a hard time believing that.
Biden is a big supporter of abortion .. this is against the teachings of his church,Strong supporter of same sex marriages,and all this transgender stuff, against the teaching of the church..Had his fingers up in the private parts of a underage girl... he should be horse whipped
US officials: Russia denigrating Biden ahead of election
I think both push narratives. Also Obama had 8 yrs without any problems. Pelosi and Biden 40-50... so why can’t Trump have 8? November is around the corner. Vote him out. I will still support your president because at the end of the day I am an American. Peace to you!
Posts I made regarding Biden &amp; suggesting fairness &amp; ppl not to be hypocritical of what he said. Plus, apparently unable to reason to where statements come out intelligently. Deleted by Twitter monitor who did not like my opinion. Disliking diversity of thought!
As far as diversity of thought, well, everyone makes sweeping generalizations &amp; Biden has done what many ppl do &amp; have done. There is some grain of truth to what he is saying, however, it is a generalization.
Pandemic will end if biden elected, and continues if trump elected.

I wouldn’t go that far. This is where I am. Take care of your own life. I get along with everyone and everything. I don’t need someone licking my shoe or destroying some building to say my life matters. Biden has had 40 years to make it right.
Awe thank you I am just happy I at least was able to experience being a mom. So many other woman I know are still struggling to achieve this dream. I have a friend trying with invitro and has had no success. I hope #Biden will invest in this cause once he becomes our next #POTUS.
So you have a lot of bot followers?  Do you agree with what Biden said about African Americans not being diverse?
No and thats why biden and his crackbaby son need to stay away from the white house
Biden walks to church on top of aborted babies.
It’s just a little taste of NYC under the Biden Administration because I’m hearing fossil  fuels will be a energy source from the past...🙄
Joe Biden would have handled COVID-19 like an adult. Is anyone refuting that? Possibly saving lives. Tell me about his feelings toward Black people after we get that petulant child out of the White House. Desperate times call for desperate measures.
Biden/DuckworthIf you watch it with the sound off it looks like hes singing at a biden rally but with more people
We need them November 3! And we need them for Biden and not Trump. We needed them in Georgia for Abrams, but 12% of black men voted from Kemp, and we see where it got us.
The fact that news outlets even give 2 shits about what China and Iran want is enough to tell me that Biden’s “predictability” is dangerous for America!!
You want Trump again? This is how you get again? A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump. Vote for liberty and freedom. #VoteGold
Doesn’t seem like it will. And Joe Biden needs to be brought down along with #NancyPelosi #Chuck Schumer
That’s Joe Biden.  He hasn’t completed a sentence in 6 months.    Reminder to record the debates.
We want Biden at the debates.  Turn him loose.   I bet he doesn’t show.
He says 40,000 lives could be saved over the next three months.

“Wearing the mask is less about you contracting the virus,” Biden said. “It’s about preventing other people from getting sick.”
Me and my nigga was conversing earlier and we was talmbout Joe Biden VP pick. Mrs. Kamela Harris. I think she is an excellent pick and is a savage which is exactly what we need Joe soo chill so she will balance it out. I did hear she my be an unpopular pick but i have my own 🧠
The majority of News outlets have allowed orange sherbert to be senile all day without challenge.. I don’t care if Biden is blowing bubbles, and thinks he’s the Queen of England, I’m voting #BidenHarris2020
I get that Mrs. Harris is not everyone's pic for VP.  But, let's do better and focus on getting 45 out!  I have a feeling it didn't matter which Black woman Biden picked,  People were…
From the start, some Biden advisers saw Harris as a logical choice. She was among the party's most popular figures, a deft debater and a fundraising juggernaut. But there was that debate-stage attack on Biden's busing record to consider.
There is no such thing as a perfect political candidate...it’s a lot not to like about Biden and Harris but don’t let that keep a mentality retarded president in office...I’m just saying
Find out what The Breakfast Club thinks about Biden picking Senator Harris as his running mate!
So the day after we lose Kamala/James Harris, Biden announces his VP running mate is Kamala Harris....no, we're not in a simulation at all...
I don’t care how y’all feel about Biden or Kamala. I can’t deal with Trump for another 4 years. He’s aggy!
Kamala Harris, Biden's V.P. Pick, Is First Woman of Color on Major Party Ticket
My mama just yelled that she didnt know Kamala went to Howard and then sighed. And then I sighed. And said yeah.  And then she said well at least shes younger so if Biden dies somebody can take over who can keep up 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
All of this excitement for the Pence/Harris debate popped up all over social media instantly. I wonder why it wasn’t a thing for Trump/Biden 🤔
What do you think of the pick?
Holy shit. This is probably the smartest move Democrats have made via this election. Which says a lot because it's the most sensible play and again, Biden should have never been the presidential candidate
If Biden doesn’t pick Harris or Rice he might as well drop out the race.
Joe Biden is on the cusp of announcing the biggest, and possibly most consequential, decision of his political career with the unveiling of his running mate.
So Biden has an impediment and Trump has a disability. SSDD.
What if Trump and Biden are the same bird?
Yes, but she’s right before Biden. That seems to suggest something. I get letting others speak who might not be chosen, but isn’t it customary for the VP nominee to basically introduce the presidential nominee?
Biden did not write this, had to his assistant an caregiver that did !!!! LMAO #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver
Just make sure Biden gets to the Debates.
The plandemic.  If Biden wins in November it will quietly fade away.  Who wants to bet it?
Biden and Trump can't even form complete sentences.
Biden? I was talking about Trump. But Biden didn't produce then either. I never said no influence, you can read. President* look I can find typos too Amash is a Libertarian now...
Trump was not very successful. Biden had awful results, you're blind.
Check LP presidential election since 2012 and notice the curve. Biden/Trump have done nothing helpful in more than 24 years. She's a college professor.
Wow.  Biden, Obama, Killary, Pelosi.    The Fraudulent Four.  Corruption at its finest.   You’ve been brainwashed sweetheart
But China wants Biden so bad.  Wonder why?  He’s a puppet.  They will have full control.
Turn him loose.  Don’t let Biden skip the debates.
Biden isnt worthy of anybody's vote.What hopefully the majority of American voters will do on (or possibly before) Nov. 3rd, 2020 &amp; will become true when Biden/Harris replace Trump/Pence on Jan. 20, 2021:
If you're a voter in the U.S. staying a live long to say and actually do to cast a ballot against Trump/Pence and for Biden/Harris on or before (if definitely needed) November 3rd, 2020!
i’m not saying i support trump, or biden... or kanye. everyone is fucking trash.
Georgia’s  will headline a Biden campaign voter protection rally urging Congress to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act on Thursday, the same day he’s set to receive the party’s presidential nomination. #gapol
That's for Biden
I am voting in person for biden
I think Trump has been cognitively consistent for 4 years. You might say ok, consistently stupid, but still consistent. Biden today compared to Biden 4 years ago seems like there has been somewhat of a decline, he has more trouble finding words, and there is just something else.
Yang, Gabbard, and Buttigieg were the only candidates I had enough respect for to maybe give them a chance against Trump. Right now a vote for Trump is a vote against Biden just like a vote for Biden is a vote against Trump.
Blame the Democrats for giving Yang like 10 seconds of time in the debates and Gabbard even less. Exaggerating, but the reality is that while I plan to vote Trump, I donated to both their campaigns bc they were not far left and also Biden is losing his marbles man.
I mean, if Trump gets 70million and Biden gets 100 it will be obvious
Biden screwed up on VP pick, I can't vote for Kamala. I am opposed to not voting, that is ultimately a vote for the winner. Abstaining only had meaning in parliamentary proceedings. Trump is a jerk and the GOP needs to be punished.  Maybe I go with the Constitution Party.
We will know when Florida counts, if Biden wins FL, Trump is toast.
While this is plausible, #NewHampshire, although very close in 16, has not shown that same inclination in 20. More importantly, the polls out of #Florida have been stubbornly consistent, showing #Biden ahead, comfortably outside margin of error.
Over the next week, Georgia Democrats will pressure Biden to live up to running mate Kamala Harris’ challenge to deliver “more than a victory” in November by competing in a state that Republicans have carried in every White House vote since 1996. #gapol
"'Trump may damage American democracy permanently' - Khizr Khan, whose army captain son died in Iraq, gave a speech at 2016 Democratic convention that was a moral indictment of Trump. Joe Biden, he says, has the character to be president" #BidenHarris2020

Biden released his taxes. Trump should, too. Buzz off, Greta.
Pretty much tells the end game of a Biden Harris administration
This should tell you everything you need to know about Trump's efforts to kill the US Postal Service!! This is authoritarian fascism, pure and simple. Watch the video with the article! #TRE45ON #TraitorTrump #FascismIsHere
Biden is leading in the polls now, according to the media. So if Trump wins, will you assume fraud? And, because of the assumed fraud, would you approve of forcefully removing him from office?
Biden being a guaranteed win was an exaggeration, I assumed that would be obvious since every media outlet shows him in the lead (like they did Hillary in 2016) but if my exaggeration was taken at face value that was not my intent. No media outlets have him at 100% chance.
And yet if Trump wins, every democrat is going to say they are sure it is due to fraud, there could be no other way. And so, of course, it will be important to remove him by force, and install Biden no matter what.
What I find funny about the situation is Dems that simply cannot fathom another legitimate Trump victory. Doesn't matter how much you say that Trump voters are silent until the booth. All they know is what the media tells them, which is Biden is a guaranteed win. It's crazy/sad.
No, he picked Joe Biden. Such delusional poppcock. That and your statement on USPS

Emory’s National Election Experts React To Joe Biden’s Vice-Presidential Pick Harris
This is why people don’t trust conservative polling...the answers choices’ wording and neglect to be unbiased by not even saying Biden’s name makes this so skewed and biased it’s unusable.  “I’m no liberal snowflake” vs. “Its West or Trump”? Give me a break.
Yea so your answer choices don’t even mention Biden and they are worded in a skewed manner which makes this poll incredibly biased.  This is why people don’t trust GOP/conservative polls.  “I’m no liberal snowflake” is by no means an indictment on Biden. You’re a disgrace
And YOUR party makes a MOCKERY of ALL Americans and of the country, itself, in forcing a demented old man in Biden on us like we’re all too stupid to see it.
“In a fund-raising email about Ms. Harris’s selection, Vice President Mike Pence -“this is YOUR Country, NOT THEIRS,” he wrote.
Biden and Kamala gave away the secret.  Authoritarian Government over reach resulting in a totalitarian tyrannical police state
Genuinely curious, what about Biden do you think would classify him as fascist?
I mean what’s the better approach? I can keep talking about leftist ideas and convincing people I know and online that they’re the way to go until a revolution/collapse happens and vote Biden to reduce harm in the meantime. Or what? I don’t think there’s a better option
Dictator want to be? Biden and Karen....I mean Kamala want to have a national mandate on mask. There is no Constitutional power to mandate this or enforce it and reeks of fascism
I basically agree with this. But when that system does get torn down, we’re going to need a new system that’s better rather than worse. That’s why we need to keep pushing society left until it happens. If electing Biden is a step left, then I think it’s one we have to take
Biden better buckle up because he’s got a big mess to clean up. And the only way to clean up this time is real change. Americans deserve healthcare and to be able to vote from the safety and comfort of our homes! Let Trump close our post office we’ll use our computers finally!

Welcome to what the Biden/Harris administration will look like across America.
The fact that you think Biden will win is laughable. You’re a complete clown show.
You should work harder, find a better job. It’s not trump’s fault or job. If you think it is, then you’re a liberal. Get it? It’s called capitalism. Vote for Biden if you want the government to help. Remember this is where they get high on power like they’re doing now, re masks
The biggest goofies are the ones who are supporting Kamala Harris when we know her and Biden are never gonna support abolishing the police and ICE lmao do y’all even know what you support 🥱
I got a theory Trump told Kanye to run for President so he could take away some black votes from Biden.. Politics is one big ass scheme.
This is what a Biden Administration will look like. Get ready people #Trump2020 #WomenForTrump #BidenHarris2020 #SaveOurDemocracy #realchangestartsathome
At least Kanye still has his mind!  In actually feel sorry for Biden.  His handlers are abusing him on the National stage and it’s recognized as some kind of normal.  SMH
Gave Joe 8 years to bring back jobs and he failed. He was for the Paris agreement that allowed China to pollute the earth at a historical rate. Joe Biden never fixed police violence
You don't have to constantly worry as a news channel that you are going to be broadcasting lies, and potentially life threatening ones, to the public when Biden and Harris are speaking. With Trump it's almost a certainty that it will happen
The Trump people who have been trying to question  competency can't be feeling too confident about how that attack will stick after watching Biden's speech introducing  as his VP pick. Biden's cognitive abilities are significantly better than Trump's
Thank you and I too appreciate the respectful conversation as well! I wish you and your family the best and especially in navigating the school year and hope things go well!
Biden is taking no prisoners..... #SpecialReport #BidenHarris2020
Biden is going in..... I’m excited to vote for him in November. He’s serving trump on a platter.
I do have kids (one with asthma) and am enrolling them in a virtual school for this year because I don’t have confidence the public school systems will be given the proper tools to curb the spread.
I don’t think we’ve learned anything definitive their ability to spread, except maybe they make up a higher % of asymptomatic spreading (i.e GA schools). What we do know is they can’t spread while learning remote with families following strict social distancing guidelines.
Everybody it's important to always have a sort of healthy fearful caution, if the data says things are getting worse then they are, but if it says they're getting better then the data is wrong  although sneak peek if Biden wins things might get better you'll have to wait and see
I’m hopeful it’s less dangerous but I also believe we’re still too in the infancy of our understanding of COVID to know. Even if it is less dangerous, kids can still spread like everyone else. And I don’t think we’ve taken the proper steps to have the BK employees back either.
Didn’t say they shut down earlier, they didn’t. I do believe their shut down restrictions were more strict and enforced which helped get things under “control”. For GA where I live, we shut down and have opened up based on no signs we should have.
Lol. Last time I seen this poll Biden was up by 20 points
You forget that all those countries shut down and took the initial wave of cases seriously, the US did not. It was a coordinated effort to do what was necessary to stop the spread and then open slowly and with restrictions. We never got step 1 right.

I’ll take whatever chance at whoever would be Biden VP as long as it leads to getting Trump the fuck out of office. That’s the main goal and seeing niggas acting like sambo because of Kamala is concerning
It’s a different between MAGA people and those who like Biden/Harris. Don’t give me that both are mean line. Do you then, sit it out.
I think Biden/Bottoms is too vulnerable to memes.
And in the mean time you are helping trump win reelection. You are helping RBG to be replaced by a right wing nut job. Biden wasnt my first choice either but he's my ride or die now because the next president will either be biden or trump.

He will be in Washington apart of Biden's cabinet, he wont have time to worry about the Pence's lol
worrisome (about the majority of this year &amp; of course the pandemic), neglectful (alternate might be 'disrespectful', about Trump &amp; his administration especially after that 'it is what it is' statement), &amp; hopeful (about the hope that Biden now w/ Harris wins on Nov. 3rd)

Why Trump may struggle to run against a Biden-Harris ticket  via
Second-greatest day. Seeing him refuse to concede but be ignored after Biden wins in a landslide will be almost as good as seeing him gone from the White House before Jan. 20 because he doesn't want to participate in Biden's inauguration.
Biden represents Obama's legacy, there are enough blacks that will vote for him for him for that reason alone. He doesn't need help there. Kamala is there to appeal to suburban women. And counter Trump's Law and Order message.
Bottoms. Why don’t you do your job as Mayor of Atlanta and quit worrying about Joe Biden. You’re responsible for an eight year old females death. If you are so smart and we know you are. Straighten Atlanta out
You overshot your shot, I said I care, I’m just not hell bent over politics. I know all about BOTH Biden/Kamala, I’ve interviewed them both just like Trump/Pence, though I interviewed VP. Neither has a strategy in place on bettering the US. All have 80+ days to have a plan. 👈🏾
They both won though. Biden won the D primary and Trump won the R primary. It's not actually big news.
..man, these super deep conservatives/GOP voters are HOT🔥 today, not at Biden, b/c he picked a black woman named Kamala Harris as his VP candidate. My blocking game also be HOT🔥as well w/trolls thinking they can throw rocks &amp; hide their hands. I’m not the one you want! 👏🏾💯
It’s not only that. They just wasn’t expecting the one woman that they did not want to see be his running mate become his running mate because they are fearful of the power/backing (support system) Biden and Harris will have together w/the ppl, &amp; now, Trump supporters hella mad!
I value your opinion so i want to know why Biden is the clear cut favorite for you now that kamala is on board but we can talk about it another day. Maybe you know something i don’t. So I find it intriguing. It’s others that feel the same way as you do.
Claudia....THEY BIG MAD today! What shook them...a BLACK woman they don’t like is Biden’s VP candidate and they are fearing this is the end for them! You hate to see it! 👏🏾
Haha pop your Shìt! Kamala put Biden over the top now huh?? Why is that because she suppose to be a sister or because she actually did or plan to do something to help benefit black ppl?

Not only that, but Biden would be the 1st VP to win the White House as President since George H.W. Bush did in 1989.
For all the complaining about leaks, the Biden team picked a VP and staffed up the office without any actual leaks to the media. Not even last minute leaks from the camps of those not chosen. That's impressive.
This is true whether you want Trump to win or not. Biden backed himself into a corner and failed to gain any centrist footing in the process.

What a day! The 8 hour drive wasn't bad, then a home cooked dinner, carrot cake, Tesla Stock Split, and Biden picking Kamala! I needed this POSITIVITY in my life! ❤️
Biden/Harris! I'm ready to cast my vote.
Next: Biden will be replaced be Kamala Harris at the DNC convention, and a “moderate” white male will become her running mate - John Kasich?
Exact opposite happened to me. I was agnostic when involved with religion. I doubted because of hypocrisy.   Found my Higher Power I call God in AA. It was the personal stories of recovery I called miracles that helped me connect. My spiritual awakening. Incredible experience!
I don't think anything could make the ones who aren't happy, happy. I pray every night that the ones like that are a small minority, so we don't have to worry about Trump/Pence for 4 more years. Because I assure you, Biden/Harris will be 1000% better than Trump/Pence.
Biden/Abrams would have sounded way better

No.   Just eager for the adds of her attacking Biden
I taught Catechism to school kids several years ago.   Left because of hypocrisy too!  Got tired of being told was going to hell if didn’t follow Catholic dogma.   Love, honor and obey? Hah my ex took it literally. It should be love, trust and respect.   Never looked back!

That time when being the Governor of Georgia was your backup plan. #gagop #beentherelostthat
They changed it to Slow Joe for some reason. Cue infinite footage of Trump creeping down a ramp and Biden jogging up it.
As far as I can follow, Kamala is a racist because she called out Biden for being a racist and now she's a phony because she's sucking up to a racist. The whiplash between pretending racism doesn't exist and calling people racists really has to drive up their chiropractor bills.

Biden did not let emotion fuel his decision. As Trump should know it is good business. Trump is all emotion and makes bad choices because of it
That's impressive; I wouldn't have thought it would be possible to come up with that incoherent a message, but you managed it. What are you trying to say, that Biden's a racist? That he's a cuck and she's a shrew? That they're both commies? Dang, y'all are bad at this.
The ads he is going to make against Joe Biden will be her own words
He wanted the absolute worse pick and is surprised Joe made such a terrible pick. The ads about to come out against Biden from her mouth are going to be tremendous. And the ads showing her character will define evil.
...because he’s shook now knowing Biden has Harris as his running mate. Trump was all over the place in the presser.
Right  #letsgo Democrats we got this! Lord whatever you’re doing in this season do it with Biden/Harris #Amen 🙏🏾🙌🏾
Biden and Kamala? 🤣 show how they sell their soul for the ticket . Democrats a joke . Republicans a bigger joke.
Trump (since he can’t campaign due to COVID) has taken these✌🏾daily #coronavirus briefings✌🏾&amp; turn them into his campaign rally platform. Honestly, he looks like he &amp; his campaign doesn’t have a game plan to win re-election other than simply attack Biden &amp; now Kamala.
That's not the genius strategy you think it is, Fredo. People want progressive policy change, especially increasing taxes on rich crooks such as yourself. She's a better candidate in the general than she was in the primary, possibly better than Biden.
As a prosecutor she will be able to debate Trump better than Biden.
People are desperate for an end to chaos. Trump's camp can't describe Biden as boring and mediocre; people would prefer that. So they have to pretend he threatens a worse kind of chaos. It's not going to stick because it's silly on its face, but it's all they've got.
Proposed: Make the second of the three debates Prez vs. VP. Biden-Pence would put everyone to sleep, but Trump-Harris would be something you'd record and burn onto DVD.
Girl stop it!!!! Seriously? I’d file and HR claim  😂 My old 45 supporter coworkers were very hush hush but now everyone is very excited about Biden &amp; Harris. And I’m new, it’s definitely going to be a thing . I’ve gotta prepare big time
You were never going to vote for Biden anyway. Sit all the way down.

Not Biden.
I mean, Biden is racist so.... that’s where it stops for me. 🤷🏽‍♂️
Doesn’t really matter. Biden’s toast anyway and Democrats know it.
I’d still vote for Biden/💩
Is Maddow talking about Obama/Biden/Rice/Clapper/Comey and how they abused intelligence agencies and corrupted the FBI?  Wow.
Some people say Biden better have a Black women V.P. and then turn around and say if he doesn't I will still vote for him anyway 🤦‍♂️
I still believe that the most likely scenario is that Biden's lead in the polls narrows to ~5% by Election Day, and although he wins the popular vote (and I would predict more than Hillary did, maybe 4 instead of 3 million votes) Trump is still re-elected.
Hoping Biden's choice is a big hit and makes Trump jealous, so he dumps Pence for a dollar-store version of Biden's pick.

Biden screwed up on VP pick, I can't vote for Kamala. I am opposed to not voting, that is ultimately a vote for the winner. Abstaining only had meaning in parliamentary proceedings. Trump is a jerk and the GOP needs to be punished.  Maybe I go with the Constitution Party.
Very well said, Biden doesn't have the balls to stand up to violent protesters, rioters, or looters, and why in the world would you want to defund the police? They are the ones protecting us and keeping violent criminals and drugs out our neighborhoods.
Believe me. Biden/Harris would consider this.

Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden’s Running Mate
I wonder what "Favor" she gave Biden in return for him choosing her....I bet we can all guess
I think that what hurt Bernie the most was the obvious media bias &amp;the fact that the states hold primaries at wildly different times. Whenever Bernie won: "He Ekes Out Victory." Whenever Biden won: "He crushed Bernie."
Over the next week, Georgia Democrats will pressure Biden to live up to running mate Kamala Harris’ challenge to deliver “more than a victory” in November by competing in a state that Republicans have carried in every White House vote since 1996. #gapol

If Biden won’t take questions from the press now while trying to win an election...  He sure as hell won’t answer questions if elected.
Because of the green new deal they decided to run BIden off solar power which only gives him so much time before he needs recharge.  They should consider lithium batteries for longer life so he can take questions.

This is why people don’t trust conservative polling...the answers choices’ wording and neglect to be unbiased by not even saying Biden’s name makes this so skewed and biased it’s unusable.  “I’m no liberal snowflake” vs. “Its West or Trump”? Give me a break.
Yea so your answer choices don’t even mention Biden and they are worded in a skewed manner which makes this poll incredibly biased.  This is why people don’t trust GOP/conservative polls.  “I’m no liberal snowflake” is by no means an indictment on Biden. You’re a disgrace
Biden an anti Israel Presidential candidate, has Hutzpah.On Trumps historic Middle East peace agreement, claiming as VP he laid the ground work. What Biden, Obama did was sell out Israel at the UN! Obstaining on a vote condemning Israel!  Allowing Israel to be called  criminals.
Has there been a time in history, when Presidential, And Vice Presidential candidates, can have a press conference, say anything, with impunity? Biden, Harris are the answer. Make accusations, and leave without taking any questions.
Biden blames Trump for all of the lost lives due to COVID.  So by his rationale, if he had been President and didn’t close the borders (as he ridiculed Trump for doing) he would have been responsible for 1-2 Million American lives lost!
Has Joe Biden, or Donald Trump for that matter, taken a stance that I’m not aware of on transitioning children?
Vote for Biden because he is decent, qualified, experienced and can restore NORMALCY to this country... you don’t have to like or love someone to hire them to do a job for you.  Americans need to GROW UP!

Biden wants mask for 3 month. We were right he wants to keep this virus live with mask no matter what so he can stay in basement not answering any questions. #Basement President
I will gripe about Biden  I might even say stuff about Kamala  (Probably not since she is the first smart move Democrats have made this entire election cycle)  But I’m certainly not voting for more fascism racism and mass death  So vote like lives are on the line because they are
We will see. your known quantity (Biden) doesn’t know where or who he is. #BLEXIT
There are many more senerios she missed. 1- dems push mail in voting and results are tainted. Leading to dem protest then confrontation with Trump supporters, and basically civil war. 2- Biden wins Trump leaves but half don't accept results and civil war.  Either way, violence.
Exactly. Not even Biden/Harris can tell you how. And they won’t. They’re betting on fear mongering for their votes. Not actual solutions. #BLEXIT2020 #BLEXIT
By selecting #KamalaHarris Joe Biden is assured of the Black votes, women's votes, perhaps East Indian votes (after having derided the E. Indian accent of owners of 7-Eleven &amp; gas station managers), may also get the votes of Arab people who have a similar sounding name as Kamal.
Biden appears like he's looking forward to the pudding cup they promised him for showing up.
Still wondering how a person who calls Biden a segregationist,now says he’s the person to heal the nation.Also wonder how a person who couldn’t make it to the Dems IA Caucus,now thinks she should be a step away from the Presidency.Wake up America,Or we’ll be Venezuela

Real question. Asking cuz I’d like to know. Why is this president so afraid of mail in ballots? If everyone is eligible, why would it be harmful to HIS campaign &amp; not Biden’s?
People want it to rhyme with Pamela, but that’s WRONG!   Even Joe Biden sometimes says it Camela.  says it wrong EVERY TIME man! Time to get it right!  Comma-La Karma y’all.  Kamala isn’t hard to say. So say it right.

This whole rumour of Biden’s dementia and demise is something I only see on Fox News, and even there it is just opinion people saying they have heard this from unnamed sources. To me it smells like Fox trying to start a rumour to aid Trump in the election.
I agree. There are so many more, and clearer, reasons to object to her and the Biden/Harris ticket.
Why is it totally OK if Biden (HER RUNNING MATE) mangles her name but you find it offensive if a conservative host, without malice, mispronounces it?  You clowns in the biased media are the disrespectful.

links you directly to Joe Biden’s page. If Biden wins Soros and anarchy win. It will be the downfall of America
I don’t think we’ve learned anything definitive their ability to spread, except maybe they make up a higher % of asymptomatic spreading (i.e GA schools). What we do know is they can’t spread while learning remote with families following strict social distancing guidelines.
I’m hopeful it’s less dangerous but I also believe we’re still too in the infancy of our understanding of COVID to know. Even if it is less dangerous, kids can still spread like everyone else. And I don’t think we’ve taken the proper steps to have the BK employees back either.
Didn’t say they shut down earlier, they didn’t. I do believe their shut down restrictions were more strict and enforced which helped get things under “control”. For GA where I live, we shut down and have opened up based on no signs we should have.
Yeah, ummm....this election is &lt;12 weeks away. People are vastly overestimating the chance of some massive overhaul happening
You were saying,
You forget that all those countries shut down and took the initial wave of cases seriously, the US did not. It was a coordinated effort to do what was necessary to stop the spread and then open slowly and with restrictions. We never got step 1 right.
The fact that you see Biden/Harris as worse than Trump/Pence is instructive. For many of us, Trump’s moral, temperamental, ethical and mental unfitness for office represents an unacceptable risk to the republic and outweighs any other consideration.
Fact check... Clinton (and Biden) were the DIRECT catalyst for Mass Incarcerations.

Glad to vote against him. Now, who had more blacks incarcerated in the US, Kamala Harris or Joe Biden?
She's literally willing to throw away what little rights she has left, and for what? Trump has been systematically removing every right gained under Obama/Biden &amp; yet she seems to be okay with that. If he gets to stack SCOTUS, it's all over, &amp; again, she's apparently ok with that
Its interesting how these anti-Kamala and anti-Biden replies always blow up while its the middle of the night in the US. Putin's scared.
Historic wisdom states that people do not vote based on the bottom of the ticket. I don’t think that holds true for this election. I was voting for  but I do feel better with  on the ticket. It shows that Biden respects her knowledge despite differences.
Want some truth? Harris went after Biden and he didn't go all fragile, male ego, snowflaking on a podium over it. He decided she should be a voice in his campaign and his government. Gee, imagine that. Y'all might want to man up &amp; see if it's possible for you to grow some balls
I honestly don’t see a Biden victory after the Harris pick.
Biden represents Obama's legacy, there are enough blacks that will vote for him for him for that reason alone. He doesn't need help there. Kamala is there to appeal to suburban women. And counter Trump's Law and Order message.

Biden should have picked Tulsi.  Then I would have been worried.  Not so much now.  Either way,  is the winner.
I value your opinion so i want to know why Biden is the clear cut favorite for you now that kamala is on board but we can talk about it another day. Maybe you know something i don’t. So I find it intriguing. It’s others that feel the same way as you do.
Haha pop your Shìt! Kamala put Biden over the top now huh?? Why is that because she suppose to be a sister or because she actually did or plan to do something to help benefit black ppl?

Just from my short time living in Georgia it's wild. I've legit seen Biden stuff in Alpharetta. Not a *lot*, but damn sure more than I ever expected before moving out here with my preconceived notions.
Kamala Harris challenged Joe Biden in a debate and made him a better man. Rather than hold a grudge, he picked her as his running mate. This tells a lot about the man Joe Biden is - together they will make this country proud. I just contributed to their campaign. #BidenHarris2020

Thank God Biden didn't chose Bottoms maybe now she'll take care of Atlanta as she elected to do. However in my opinion I doubt she will
We love Kamala, thank-you Joe!!!  "Why Kamala Harris is a historic VP pick for Joe Biden. Presidential candidate Joe Biden has chosen California Senator Kamala Harris to be his running mate" #KamalaHarrisForVP #BidenHarris #WeLoveKamala #gapol #Dunwoody
Don’t forget that Kamala is a Law &amp; Order VP. Something  knows nothing about. I know Biden will pick a real Attorney General.
This is a big deal. I want to be in a Democratic Party where candidates aren’t afraid to be challenged on their record, including on race issues.  The fact that Biden chose Harris after their conflict during debates signals that we are a party committed to reflection and growth.
It's kinda weird.  was not my pick among Dem Presidential candidates. But she was my #1 pick for Biden's VP. She checks all the boxes. Great pick!
You’re so inspiring. I had hoped it was you, but will show up to do my part for Team Biden in November.
Biden did not let emotion fuel his decision. As Trump should know it is good business. Trump is all emotion and makes bad choices because of it
If you claim you’re anti-trump but the first thing you did when Biden announced his VP pick is find dirt on Kamala Harris, you’re not anti-trump.
I don’t know how anyone who is serious about police reform could possibly vote for a Biden/Harris ticket. He wrote and she enforced the laws that led to mass incarceration of black men.   Jo Jorgensen is an option.
She has accused Biden of being a racist, said she believes his accusers(sexual harassment)-in addition to her filthy war on poor people while DA. What a great pick 😂
As a prosecutor she will be able to debate Trump better than Biden.
I guess #phonyKamala doesn't “believe” Joe Biden’s sexual assault accusers anymore...🤔
I am definitely voting for Biden/Harris...we need to move on from the caveman mentality!
Since 2016? How many women aborted for him? He used to be pro-choice until he decided to hijack the Republican Party. He has no values, no political ideology. The guy is simply playing Americans. Biden is a better Christian
Please. We are between a rock and a hard place. Trump is the hardest place. As a Sanders supporter, I beg you, make that choice for Biden because I fear that we may not have another chance. 😰👊🙏💪
This exactly. Harris isn't perfect, but she's a whole lot better than pretty much all our other options atm, and she sure af is better than keeping our current president in office. And even Biden is better than what we have now. Not by much, but still.
Biden just LOST my vote FR!!! Do your research people and I mean VERY VERY Well 😳
Ben Shapiro saying “wet ass p-word” and Harris being chosen as Biden’s running mate was just the kind of week I needed
Desperate Trump...  I bet Biden knows that the 2nd world war ended in 1945.. #thickasshit
I don't know how to do the emoji but I'm on the the Biden/ Harris train!!
So Obama chose Willie Brown’s mistress as Biden’s VP pick.
ALL DAMN DAY LONG BABY! Biden/Harris 2020!
Nah. This is a great and logical choice.   Rice had too much Benghazi luggage.  Not worth it.  Biden can find plenty of very qualified AGs with principals in this country.   And Cali will elect another Dem Senator. Kamala can spar  with Trump.  It’s all good. 🇺🇸

So Joe Biden--the guy who authored the Crime Bill responsible for locking up a lot of Black and Brown people--picked Kamala Harris--a person who prosecuted a lot of Black and Brown people? 🤔 You can't make this stuff up...

Which reminds me, she was a cop &amp; punish people for selling cannabis. She gotta show me she understands how benign it is especially compared to alcohol, in order for me to be 100% in love with her as VP. She still my number one pick. And I am fully supporting Biden in this choice
Yes!!!!  Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate
I’m not concerned about Joe Biden being President.  I’m concerned about Kamala Harris being President.  Dedicating the next 84 days and my life to make sure that NEVER happens!

We elected  because of Obama, Biden and Susan Rice.  Imagine a Biden / Rice ticket.  Another Democrat implosion and beat down will be sweet.😎
I will now be taking bets for Biden’s VP pick
I don’t know how many of those polls I did begging Biden to name Warren his VP or at the very least don’t pick some neolib but it better have been enough.
If Biden is elected what is the over/under number of moths before the 25th amendment is invoked? I say 6.
Not Biden.
I mean, Biden is racist so.... that’s where it stops for me. 🤷🏽‍♂️
Doesn’t really matter. Biden’s toast anyway and Democrats know it.

That's for Biden
No, you are an idiot for blindly believing deplorable unethical trump. Biden and Harris are a great team!
I don't know any vets supporting Biden either, especially combat vets..  Just because you made it through basic and got med boarded from AIT doesn't mean you have bragging rights...🤣  There is alot of stolen Valor, and POGs acting like they were in a ranger bat...
Biden screwed up on VP pick, I can't vote for Kamala. I am opposed to not voting, that is ultimately a vote for the winner. Abstaining only had meaning in parliamentary proceedings. Trump is a jerk and the GOP needs to be punished.  Maybe I go with the Constitution Party.
Very well said, Biden doesn't have the balls to stand up to violent protesters, rioters, or looters, and why in the world would you want to defund the police? They are the ones protecting us and keeping violent criminals and drugs out our neighborhoods.
Believe me. Biden/Harris would consider this.
I’m staying right here and FIGHTING for this country!!! Fuck them!
I wonder what "Favor" she gave Biden in return for him choosing her....I bet we can all guess
Over the next week, Georgia Democrats will pressure Biden to live up to running mate Kamala Harris’ challenge to deliver “more than a victory” in November by competing in a state that Republicans have carried in every White House vote since 1996. #gapol

What if Biden has picked Michelle Obama to be VP? That would have put Barack back in the White House as the VP First Gentleman !DOPE!
Biden released his taxes. Trump should, too. Buzz off, Greta.
If Biden won’t take questions from the press now while trying to win an election...  He sure as hell won’t answer questions if elected.
Because of the green new deal they decided to run BIden off solar power which only gives him so much time before he needs recharge.  They should consider lithium batteries for longer life so he can take questions.

This is why people don’t trust conservative polling...the answers choices’ wording and neglect to be unbiased by not even saying Biden’s name makes this so skewed and biased it’s unusable.  “I’m no liberal snowflake” vs. “Its West or Trump”? Give me a break.
Yea so your answer choices don’t even mention Biden and they are worded in a skewed manner which makes this poll incredibly biased.  This is why people don’t trust GOP/conservative polls.  “I’m no liberal snowflake” is by no means an indictment on Biden. You’re a disgrace
And YOUR party makes a MOCKERY of ALL Americans and of the country, itself, in forcing a demented old man in Biden on us like we’re all too stupid to see it.
Biden asking to ware mask but nothing about Distancing. Because he wants to make sure the Rioters and looters face cover but still can burn and steal.
Biden wants mask for 3 month. We were right he wants to keep this virus live with mask no matter what so he can stay in basement not answering any questions. #Basement President
There are many more senerios she missed. 1- dems push mail in voting and results are tainted. Leading to dem protest then confrontation with Trump supporters, and basically civil war. 2- Biden wins Trump leaves but half don't accept results and civil war.  Either way, violence.
Biden appears like he's looking forward to the pudding cup they promised him for showing up.
Still wondering how a person who calls Biden a segregationist,now says he’s the person to heal the nation.Also wonder how a person who couldn’t make it to the Dems IA Caucus,now thinks she should be a step away from the Presidency.Wake up America,Or we’ll be Venezuela
Biden better buckle up because he’s got a big mess to clean up. And the only way to clean up this time is real change. Americans deserve healthcare and to be able to vote from the safety and comfort of our homes! Let Trump close our post office we’ll use our computers finally!

I am SO PROUD of you both, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. I was in tears when I looked at the two of you dancing with the young people. And yes, the two of you will bring REAL LEADERSHIP back to America. It is what American people have been craving! THANK YOU! ONE LOVE! Aliciadine
If Biden stays in his basement why do we need masks.

I saw Joe Biden on a couple of episodes of Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego on YouTube.  Your friend Barbara Bush was on another episode of that show.
You have Biden winning?
I agree. There are so many more, and clearer, reasons to object to her and the Biden/Harris ticket.
So TwitLer is just going to let Joe Biden lie and do nothing about it? Interesting.  But think about it: If TwitLer corrects this PROVABLE lie, then it will expose the MSM and Left for constantly repeating this, and we know TwitLER won't do anything to upset the Left.

I got a theory Trump told Kanye to run for President so he could take away some black votes from Biden.. Politics is one big ass scheme.
I see the hate Biden campaign program is shaping up. It is hilarious, though, that the Cultists latch onto an imaginary defect while ignoring Trump’s obvious mental deficiencies.
I was going to say (taking nothing away from Joe Biden, who does look presidential), so would most of us compared to the moron in the WH.
At least Kanye still has his mind!  In actually feel sorry for Biden.  His handlers are abusing him on the National stage and it’s recognized as some kind of normal.  SMH
You don't have to constantly worry as a news channel that you are going to be broadcasting lies, and potentially life threatening ones, to the public when Biden and Harris are speaking. With Trump it's almost a certainty that it will happen
The Trump people who have been trying to question  competency can't be feeling too confident about how that attack will stick after watching Biden's speech introducing  as his VP pick. Biden's cognitive abilities are significantly better than Trump's

I do have kids (one with asthma) and am enrolling them in a virtual school for this year because I don’t have confidence the public school systems will be given the proper tools to curb the spread.
I don’t think we’ve learned anything definitive their ability to spread, except maybe they make up a higher % of asymptomatic spreading (i.e GA schools). What we do know is they can’t spread while learning remote with families following strict social distancing guidelines.
I’m hopeful it’s less dangerous but I also believe we’re still too in the infancy of our understanding of COVID to know. Even if it is less dangerous, kids can still spread like everyone else. And I don’t think we’ve taken the proper steps to have the BK employees back either.
Wait... is he campaigning for Biden now?
Didn’t say they shut down earlier, they didn’t. I do believe their shut down restrictions were more strict and enforced which helped get things under “control”. For GA where I live, we shut down and have opened up based on no signs we should have.
You were saying,
You forget that all those countries shut down and took the initial wave of cases seriously, the US did not. It was a coordinated effort to do what was necessary to stop the spread and then open slowly and with restrictions. We never got step 1 right.
We are ALL IN Joe Biden! LET'S GO! BIDEN/HARRIS IN 2020!
What I'm confused a out is why these idiots seem to think Joe Biden will not be able to complete his term??? I'm mean if the lard ass, fast food never does a day of exercise ,can't walk down a ramp unassisted, or hold a glass of freakin water can manage! Biden will be FINE

And in the mean time you are helping trump win reelection. You are helping RBG to be replaced by a right wing nut job. Biden wasnt my first choice either but he's my ride or die now because the next president will either be biden or trump.
TFW  gets to debate Joe Biden.
So Biden is better on economy?
I honestly don’t see how someone can vote for Biden especially with Harris. Moreover, taking polls at face value is a fools game.
The Democratic base is getting stronger and wiser. And now with the Democratic ticket of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and ALL of the EXPERIENCE they each bring, we are NOW ENERGIZED! It may be a difficult race, BUT IN THE END WE WILL WIN!
So Biden gets more than 400 EVs?
There are now hundreds, if not thousands of people on my facebook, who are both Biden and Trump supporters. While I asked Trump supporters to NOT COMMENT because my facebook is a site to support Biden/Harris 2020 only, they still felt the need to comment. RESPECT MUST BE EARNED!

Glad to vote against him. Now, who had more blacks incarcerated in the US, Kamala Harris or Joe Biden?

Historic wisdom states that people do not vote based on the bottom of the ticket. I don’t think that holds true for this election. I was voting for  but I do feel better with  on the ticket. It shows that Biden respects her knowledge despite differences.
I honestly don’t see a Biden victory after the Harris pick.
Biden represents Obama's legacy, there are enough blacks that will vote for him for him for that reason alone. He doesn't need help there. Kamala is there to appeal to suburban women. And counter Trump's Law and Order message.
You don’t have to very smart to be smarter than  So we’ll do ok with Biden. By the way Kamala has enough smarts for both of them

Haha pop your Shìt! Kamala put Biden over the top now huh?? Why is that because she suppose to be a sister or because she actually did or plan to do something to help benefit black ppl?
Brilliant.  In Biden’s own words...
For all the complaining about leaks, the Biden team picked a VP and staffed up the office without any actual leaks to the media. Not even last minute leaks from the camps of those not chosen. That's impressive.
Yikes.  This can’t help their relationship...
This is true whether you want Trump to win or not. Biden backed himself into a corner and failed to gain any centrist footing in the process.

Exact opposite happened to me. I was agnostic when involved with religion. I doubted because of hypocrisy.   Found my Higher Power I call God in AA. It was the personal stories of recovery I called miracles that helped me connect. My spiritual awakening. Incredible experience!
I taught Catechism to school kids several years ago.   Left because of hypocrisy too!  Got tired of being told was going to hell if didn’t follow Catholic dogma.   Love, honor and obey? Hah my ex took it literally. It should be love, trust and respect.   Never looked back!

They changed it to Slow Joe for some reason. Cue infinite footage of Trump creeping down a ramp and Biden jogging up it.
As far as I can follow, Kamala is a racist because she called out Biden for being a racist and now she's a phony because she's sucking up to a racist. The whiplash between pretending racism doesn't exist and calling people racists really has to drive up their chiropractor bills.
Kamala Harris challenged Joe Biden in a debate and made him a better man. Rather than hold a grudge, he picked her as his running mate. This tells a lot about the man Joe Biden is - together they will make this country proud. I just contributed to their campaign. #BidenHarris2020

She’s no joke, she just thinks Biden supports segregation, believes he sexually assaulted those women, oh and she was smoking weed in college while listening to Tupac and Snoop, despite graduating at least 6 years before either released their first album.

But when majority of voters don’t think Biden will finish a first term, it’s a play that could work.
Biden did not let emotion fuel his decision. As Trump should know it is good business. Trump is all emotion and makes bad choices because of it
That's impressive; I wouldn't have thought it would be possible to come up with that incoherent a message, but you managed it. What are you trying to say, that Biden's a racist? That he's a cuck and she's a shrew? That they're both commies? Dang, y'all are bad at this.
When you start leading the American people by wearing your mask consistently and daily, let us know. Otherwise, pay attention to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to see what REAL LEADERSHIP looks like. Compared to your record, a 2 year old could win! LOSER IN CHIEF/BUNKER BABY!
That's not the genius strategy you think it is, Fredo. People want progressive policy change, especially increasing taxes on rich crooks such as yourself. She's a better candidate in the general than she was in the primary, possibly better than Biden.
As a prosecutor she will be able to debate Trump better than Biden.
People are desperate for an end to chaos. Trump's camp can't describe Biden as boring and mediocre; people would prefer that. So they have to pretend he threatens a worse kind of chaos. It's not going to stick because it's silly on its face, but it's all they've got.

This exactly. Harris isn't perfect, but she's a whole lot better than pretty much all our other options atm, and she sure af is better than keeping our current president in office. And even Biden is better than what we have now. Not by much, but still.
Dang, Biden announces his VP pick, and almost immediately I see people who aren’t happy with it being told they need to fall in line. The Democratic party isn’t owed the progressive vote, y’all.
You were never going to vote for Biden anyway. Sit all the way down.
End of the day. We have to be on they side anyway. Our lives will be better with her and Biden
Desperate Trump...  I bet Biden knows that the 2nd world war ended in 1945.. #thickasshit
i get what people are saying about her track record against crime, but i’m just happy that he picked somebody who will be able to eviscerate pence on the debate stage and maybe be a president who’s willing to listen to the people. she’s for equality and she’ll be good for biden💁‍♂️

If you're not smiling, go stick a thumb in your eye!! Great call, p Mr. President-to-be!!  "Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate"
Yes!!!!  Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate
I’m not concerned about Joe Biden being President.  I’m concerned about Kamala Harris being President.  Dedicating the next 84 days and my life to make sure that NEVER happens!
Nailed it! A sign of great things to come from the Biden Administration!

Biden picks kamala harris for VP
We elected  because of Obama, Biden and Susan Rice.  Imagine a Biden / Rice ticket.  Another Democrat implosion and beat down will be sweet.😎Joe Biden and lies go together like peanut butter and jelly.  He may have done some good, but he also did a lot of bad.  And he lied his way through it.  How about Anita Hill and how he treated her?  "Poor kids are just as smart as white kids"
Again, What about all the lying Biden has done his entire career?  Just going to ignore that question?  You would eat a turd sandwich from Biden and tell him how good it tastes.  You are being played!!!  And too stupid to know any better.
So you are conveniently ignoring Biden's history of lies?  Instead, try to deflect and bring up Trump.  Biden has a history of lying.  He does the same things you don't like about Trump.  And Biden also avoided service in Vietnam.  Just doesn't get pushed by the media.
What? Joe Biden lie? You tell me.
Funny you mention Joe Biden and lies together.  Yeah, he is the paragon of truth, NOT.    People just want to overlook his lies now.  Forced him out of a Presidential primary in the past over his lies.  Now, he is the "savior" of the Democrats.  Shows you how low they have sunk.
2032.  Biden for 4, Kamala for 8, AOC for 8.   has the heart and wisdom....but not enough experience---yet.  #TrumpFailedAmerica
Is it not as obvious to you as it is to me that he just really DOES NOT WANT TO BE ELECTED? Come on!! Biden is trying to throw this ... he wants out. #duh #byebye #begone
I'm amazed at those who tout Joe Biden and his political record as getting back to 'normal' politics.
The hamfistedness and incompetence is nowhere on display better than openly signaling they're doing this now, giving Biden and the Democrats nearly 3 months to counter the strategy. Trump should really ask his boss Vlad for some more subtle election rigging strategies.
Exactly. It’s literally the same exact quote Harris used when commenting on Biden’s racism. the quote you two said was her saying he wasn’t racist. You know, the original point of this whole thread. Thanks for affirming.
Democrats don't want Joe Biden out campaigning because he'll be sniffing your daughters.
Ah but your good friend and a great guy Robin Williams told the truth about Biden so shame on you for twisting the story.
And how many morons think Biden is even aware of what is going on?  He is still waiting to see who he names as his VP candidate.
Kamala Harris Crystallizes Trump’s View of Women   WOULD YOU VOTE FOR THIS WOMAN AS PRESIDENT?  because that's what she will be if Biden wins, then gets sick or dies, which he will , the democrats are banking on this to happen
Five faith facts about Biden VP Kamala Harris
Rescued again, by Joe Biden... thank you Joe! 🤣🤣🤣
It either should or should not matter what. Olof a persons skin is,,, for Biden to say months ago he would pick a woman of color, and have a short list is evidence that his choice was intentionally about color.  Why?
You are going to be severely disappointed when Trump and Biden win re-election.
So you don't want Biden to be exposed in debates with Trump?  We know what Biden used to be, but he is not the same now.  I want to see him in action on the stage.
That and her calling Biden a racist the ENTIRE primary lmao
Y’all may not like Biden or Kamala....but I am truly looking at them how we were all waiting on the avengers to come back to save everything in End Game
I am a 28 year retired Air Force Veteran who received an invite to be a Trump Patriot...below is my response: I'm not, never was and have no future plans to be a Trump Patriot. I am a true American; what I'm not is a Russian sympathizer. Go Joe Biden and Kamala Harris...
Biden and Kamala are not relevant. It's going to change direction.
Wow, Abrams can't even edge in a headline as a veepstakes loser.  (Current hed is "Keisha Lance Bottoms not picked for Biden’s VP.")
Biden/Harris ticket! Let’s do this!
Joe "you're not black if you don't vote for me" Biden   and   Kamala "I promise you I'm black niggas and nigguettes" Harris
Biden &amp; Kamala is the most meh choice of all time
I just chipped in $19.08 to the campaign and I encourage my Sorors to do the same!!! 💗💚💛💗💚  #westriveandwedo #AKAsvote #vote2020  Chip in to elect Joe Biden
Boy who else is excited for Cop-ala Harris as VP.  What a pick in the summer were we are talking about police reform, Biden chooses somebody who put many into the system.
They shouldn't. I would, however, like a bishop to tell Biden he can't call himself Catholic anymore.
It'd be fun to see if they would fall for something like "Biden is considering dark horse candidate State Sen. Judith Zaffirini for veep to reach out to the Hispanic community."
Hypocritical to demand a particular race or gender.  Black male leaders warn Biden ‘will lose’ election if he doesn't name Black female running mate
your going right out the door.biden 20/20
that's why I'm voting biden 20/20.
trump derangement syndrome is showing. that mean you like biden?

"IF you don't vote for me, you are not black"  Calling somebody at a town hall fat.  Challenging a worker at a plant to step outside over a discussion about guns.  Biden is not acting normal and the Media is trying to cover and hide for him.Biden is +100 in the dead vote. #YouAintAlive
Finally true words spoken by him. Vote Biden Harris 2020
So being against Biden’s segregationist past was FAKE?

Yeah I agreed along time ago, please stop Biden from pretending to be something he is not or will ever be. How dare he lay Americans problems in a woman of color! Please have a talk with him, you know as well as most of us he is not stable!
Hunter Biden: MIA?!? What the HELLO?!?
My opinion only! How dare “Biden” place “his “ election on Ms. Harris ! In my view she should be running for office not a weak bitty man. Sorry Biden that’s just the way “I”feel... you thank we don’t see what your pulling you need to have a talk with your Boss “President Obama.
Please vote early so you can’t see Biden and Harris’ dumbfuckery on display😂
Biden/Harris not taking questions because they don’t have original plan on Covid 19. They copied and trying to take credit and blame Trump and lied. They framed their attacks well, though. Most people are smart enough to see through the lies.
I’m sure hose who forced her onto Biden will cover it!
Mr Biden can you explain your policy?? Nope no questions today folks just bullshit platitudes for the base!!!!
Vote for Biden–if you’re racist.
A vote for Biden?
BIDEN campaign will not take any questions. why
Stand by our principles and risk another 4 years of trump or give in and maybe get.. ugh.. Biden.
They will try to steal it like they stole my Biden yard signs.

Biden’s pick probably gave Trump the 2020 election, gift wrapped.
But Joe Biden is.
Joe Biden should announce a different cabinet member everyday just before trump's press rallies. Would drive the #shitholepresident even more bonkers than he already ts!

Why you lie so much Biden.
ALMOST LAUGHABLE, that BIDEN wants to bring to ALL OF AMERICA, the BS IN SAN FRANCISCO by NAMING ONE OF ITS LEADERS as HIS VP!  #NOTHANKYOU!!
AMAZING how the DEEP STATE ALWAYS picks the DEEP STATE! Biden Deep State since 1972! Picks Harris, Deep State since 2017! DC NEVER CHANGES! #DRAINTHEDAMNSWAMP! VOTE  &amp; ALL REPUBLICAN down ballot candidates!!
To those people who say they are surprised that Biden picked Kamala after the way she went after him during the debates I say that speaks to his character, that he's able to overlook personal grievances to do what's best for the country!
Biden is entering the “racial jungle.” #KampalaHarris
Harris destroys the ticket. She’s a bigger joke than Biden. Farewell, Democrats!
Trump will win for sure. No one likes Kamala. She has already been rejected by her own party for President. Biden will have to step down for mental incompetence so she’s who they’re pushing to run the country.
Democratic Party said Bernie couldn’t win cause Trump would say he Radical Left...Now he doing it with Biden and Kamala lol....We tried to tell y’all that they would spew that regardless
Joe Biden has chosen Kamala Harris as his VP running mate!
WASHINGTON (AP) — Biden picks California Sen. Kamala Harris as his VP, making her the first Black woman on major party presidential ticket.
Looks like a Biden-Harris ticket!
I just thought you were quoting things you don’t like about Trump. You want to talk about Trump’s mental state but Biden is truly in the throes of an actual mental breakdown. We all know it. It’s sad.
Just like Joe Biden “slipped” about Obama’s new view on gay marriage. Calculated.
Funny how you analyze every single word he says, looking for a mistake. Yet Joe Biden speaks nothing but mistakes and you ignore it completely. You people are a joke.
Exactly.  whiffed on the perfect set-up today when he didn’t zing her about the fact that Biden will need the questions prior to the debate!!
"1.2 billion. So you go ahead and you stack spaghetti sauce at a store— at at at a supermarket. You control the guy or the woman that runs the run run run— brings out the carts on a onaonaona on a forklift. What happens?!" -Joe Biden
To the millions of Americans struggling to get by right now — those who can't find a job or pay the bills: Joe Biden’s party will do nothing for you. They need you suffering so that they can gain power— they will forget you as soon as they have your vote. Same as always.
While we are on POTUS candidates making sense, can you make sense of anything Hidin’ Biden says?
What if Trump officiates some special marriages like Biden did?

Ben Shapiro makes solid points about Joe Biden
Although Biden is a practicing Catholic who has for years talked openly about his faith, Trump claimed he was “against God,” then launched into a rambling attack on Desperate man will do desperate things. Liar in Chief!
