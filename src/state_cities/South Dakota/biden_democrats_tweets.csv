NDN Collective's Nikki Love will be joining the roundtable ‚ÄúBuild Back Better" on racial and economic equity, outlining how Biden‚Äôs plan will address systemic racism and advance racial economic equity in MN and across the country. Friday 7/31 REGISTER HERE
Whatever you think of Biden, odds are that he‚Äôs going to surround himself with people who actually know how government functions and he will listen to them instead of firing them when they disagree with him
Biden vows to fight racial inequality with economic agenda
we‚Äôre not there yet. If I had to guess when it would be at the end of a Biden first term or the middle of his second term. He would be the 21st Century Andrew Johnson. And as the new President comes in Biden‚Äôs words out the door would be watch out for Antifa and BLM.
You know the hearing is a train wreck for Democrats when networks go from the hearing to Biden, whose been a train wreck his whole adult life.
Biden says post-pandemic economy can fight racial inequality
An nonendorsement for Biden is an endorsement for four more years of Trump.
The only problem with Joe Biden attending a funeral is that he might think that he is the corpse.
But fewer people say the U.S. is on the right track. Plus, how we feel about the future of our jobs and the coronavirus threat. Explore the mood of the country in 8 charts.
The Stein-Swingers and Bernie Burners were a lost cause when  Biden took the lead in the primaries.
If you really believe that  you would step aside and let a woman of color be the Democratic nominee for President.
When Biden is elected, which he will be, all will be saved. Your faith in America will be restored and no more bad things will happen.
Which means if you support Biden you support pedophilia, socialism and dementia?  Ridiculous generalization
Truthfully, Carlin wouldn't support either candidate.  Biden more so, because Biden has been entrenched in politics longer than most so-called "progressives" have been alive.  Biden is part of this "club" he's talking about.
This is one area I think we need to redo our thinking 100% Mr. Biden please explain to me how if you make $18 an hour now that you will convince my boss to give me an $8 raise when you boost min to $15. Because if you just raise to $15 it makes me that much closer to being poor.
Interesting, if this is true then why do so many want to vote Biden? üòÖ
Yep. It makes sense. Plus, if Biden wins, cornhole-19 will disappear the day after the election.

Biden, Obama pair in socially distanced video to decry Trump
#ImVoting4BidenBecause I believe in keeping our country a democracy and restoring our standing and respect in the world. I believe in siding with our allies and not authoritarians. I believe in #Biden.Already know of Beijing Biden.
A WARNING to  &amp;  Americans are anticipating your attack on Biden. Do you really think they're going to believe anything you present?
If you let those who were planning on voting for you go without housing, food, and money they need for transportation to get to and from work you are pretty much handing the presidency to Joe Biden because they just won't vote for you.
Let's stand with anyone who will defund the military and REFUSE to stand with anyone who votes to increase its budget - like your friend Joe Biden
Will Biden fix all of that? Alright, then let us try to see if he'll listen.
Besides, since when has our motto been to dream less? Last time I checked, Biden has not won yet. As such, his cabinet is still wide open. Advisers are as much responsible for setting policy as POTUS. I think it's only fair to bend his ear a little since we are voting for him.
Yes! Biden 2020üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
If Biden somehow becomes our next president just remember, if you were one of those individuals stating "Trump's not my president", you can't get mad and argue if people start stating "Biden's not my president "
He isn't a problem. Your family funneling our money into your family coffers &amp; to Trump sponsors is an actual crime.  Hunter Biden got a position because of privilege of familial association. This is a glass house you don't want to be throwing rocks in, moron.  #TrumpCrimeFamily
That's because he knows he's not going be there anymore, so he wants construction noise, saws and hammering to be the soundtrack for Biden 5 months from now. Maybe he can even create a secret passage? He's such a #uck.
just like your fake ad on joe biden?
Or Biden say 150 million in the U.S. have died from COVID
This sort of nonsense could push me toward voting for Biden. I want to see where this goes first.
In my very unscientific poll, 62.5% of the respondents said they believe there will be no public debates between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. I have heard the same prediction from folks on the right and left. Time will tell. #Election2020
First he tried to dig up dirt on Biden and they found nothing. Then he tried to say Biden wasn‚Äôt all there and that didn‚Äôt stick. Now this new low. Trump is scared to face off against
Will Beijing Biden and the Marxists now in control of the Democrat party bring this tyranny to the US?  They can be seen posting about going after Trump supporters if they win the election.
It is much more likely Beijing Biden and the Marxists now in control of the Democrat party will bring this tyranny to the US.  They can be seen posting about going after Trump supporters if they win the election.
Yeah, but somehow I still don't see you voting for Biden.  Maybe you won't vote for anybody but definitely not Biden.
Not trump is a bigger prize. I'll deal with the Not Biden in the next election.
What jobs did he provide for the black community? Biden signed a bill to put black peoples in jails Trump signed one to get them out. Want to keep going?
Portland, Seattle, New York, Chicago pretty much all of California all shit. Shall I keep going or shal I continue to show you how fucked up the streets are and have been? I‚Äôll wait to tell me one thing Obama or Biden for black people. Go ahead.
With fewer than 100 days until the presidential election, presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden has announced he will choose his running mate next week.
My favorite quotes i saw on here was "You couldve ran a potato against trump and won by a landslide, but you chose Biden."
Bro I cant with these two, Trump and Biden are like choosing to get stabbed in the right foot or left foot.  Just a disaster
I guess you can add his name to Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and Joe Biden!  #DoNothingDemocrats
Joe Biden should hire  if he wants to win the White House.
The Latest: Biden says he hasn't been tested for coronavirus $TRV #TRV #Health #MLBbaseball #Professionalbaseball
Many local law enforcement agencies are not are not enforcing laws against rioters, arsonists and anarchists.  In some cases local Democrat elected officials are preventing them.  There is little reason to believe that Democrats actually want to stop this lawless behavior.
Joe Biden just ain‚Äôt right in the brain.
This is a preview of Joe Biden‚Äôs administration.   Bailing on Americans to please the GOP.   Why should we work to support them again?
Joe Biden will pass the ‚ÄúFace Act‚Äù! It‚Äôs still real to me!!!
If you're more angry at the DNC and Biden then you are Trump I think you have a problem.
If you can find common ground with anyone in the Democratic party, I have a hard time believing that you're a Conservative. The Dems went hard Left years ago and Biden is nothing more than a puppet and that's all he'll be as president.
With 48 hours left on my poll, 70% of respondents believe there will be no public debates between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. What say you? #Election2020
2nd time voting for a president and this time I get to choose between Biden, Trump, and JoJo. they're all deeply and heartbreakingly disappointing. Anyways, have a great day!
I had a Joe Biden joke, but I can‚Äôt remember it.
President trump can talk for hours and make perfect sense. Biden can't even answer pre approved questions right. They just stick him in the basement.
Enough of them will come around. Every Berniecrat I know has no problem with voting against trump and seem more enthusiastic than those who are voting for Biden.
More like a sandwich of that flavor. #SouthPark  #Biden
OMG, Biden has been in govt for over 40 YEARS!  40  FUCKING YEARS.  Hypocrisy.
Information on Joe Biden's plan to fund "COPS" ü§î
Before COVID-19, I could‚Äôve listed many reasons why I was voting for Biden instead of Trump.  But now it‚Äôs easy. We need to get out of this mess. It‚Äôd be hard to convince me the things that Trump has done to try to beat the virus is working/will work.  Watch this 6-minute video.
Argh. I was going to leave this alone, but I can‚Äôt. People are blaming BLM, media, Biden, communists, etc. I have watched the vid many times. No clue why they are fighting. It‚Äôs the kind of thing kids post because they find it entertaining.
Question about the presidential election. Do you believe there will be one or more public debates between Donald Trump and Joe Biden? #debate #Election2020
Go back and look at all the stupidly racist things that Biden has made over the decades. He has been in office for over 40 years.  It's all a joke.
Not a Biden voter my friend.
Biden/Harris 2020 sounds pretty good   #MakeAmericaAmericaAgain. Cheers.
Claim 1: false Claim 2: false Claim 3: false  What kind of politician lies like this? Answer Joe Biden
Why is he focused on beating Biden, but not Trump?
Twitter and Facebook become targets in Trump and Biden ads $TWTR #TWTR #Technology #Generalelections #Elections
Biden continues to hunker down in his basement bunker. Not the kind of President I want to lead our great nation. #Trump2020LandslideVictory
Reached a new level...woke up to nurse Anders and remembered the dream I was having...was in the office with a few coworkers doing year end things, left to go sweater shopping, returned to office - we were all stressed about joe Biden revealing his VP pick at the first debate.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Oh you‚Äôre talking about Q. I‚Äôve been trying to find them on 4chan and idk how to üò≠ I mean I understand him just fine tho so idk what people mean by saying he blabs. Biden, Biden blabs. What Biden does is the definition of blabingü§°
Trump‚Äôs Reactive Engagement  Could Biden match this?  Especially when he may be seriously compromised by China?
Hey man be thankful. They gave us joe Biden.
that is the point. we are tired of the corruption, daily drama, incompetent narcissist racist divisiveness in america. so yes please vote for Biden!
Anyone with a stake in the #Construction trades needs to wake up &amp; understand how terrible this  policy actually is;
Trump Campaign Derides 'Fake' Fox News Poll That Shows Biden Ahead - National Memo
I miss Obama, and I hope Biden does the job as good and as well.
Can you go next week wearing a Biden 2020 shirt?
Remember : Bill Browder is the public face of the Magnitsky Act.   But the bill was put together by interests in the UK and Jonathon Winer, the lawyer for both Browder and that Russian Oligarch I talked about at the beginning of this thread.   Biden-connected Khodorkovsky.
If Biden wins he'll be nothing more than a figurehead puppet for the extreme, left wing part of the Democratic party. He's no longer coherent enough to actually be in control.
Joe Biden and Obama put those kids in cages too. Nothing will change if he wins. He'll keep doing it. The Media just won't report on it anymore and you'll forget lol.
Joe Biden will leave us ruined. If you think it's bad now, just wait Ha ha.
Compassion and Empathy....Do you even know what those words mean? Ha ha ha. Joe Biden doesn't. So if you do, you too could be president.
That means nothing though. Would anyone that was voting for Trump/Pence shift to Biden because of it? No.   We have big problems to address. We need to put a VP in that will bring as many voters out to not just win WH, but Senate and grow the House.
Whelp. This confirms more thing for Biden to tackle next year. #JoeBidenJob
Looked like Obama was endorsing Biden based on the YouTube video I saw today.
Person: Obama (popular) Woman: Hillary (popular vote) Man: Biden  (most popular candidate) Camera: Protestors (popular grievances) TV: tRump (watching unpopular news &amp; not working)  I think anyone can remember this stuff (I only started taking Prevagen yesterday).
He canceled because he didn't want bad press, I believe that. Wanting to protect lives is 6 mos too late. He's taking the poll numbers seriously &amp; is trying to walk in Joe Biden's footsteps.
Joe Biden's Pandemic Adviser ADMITTED Obama and Biden BOTCHED the H1N1 Response "We did every possible thing wrong." Oops, someone forgot to tell Ron Klain not to tell the truth.
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama stepped up their attacks on President Donald Trump and defended their time in the White House in a new video showing their first in-person meeting since the coronavirus outbreak.
Lots of Trump flags flying in Sioux Falls, SD; haven‚Äôt seen a single Biden sign. We‚Äôre an open-carry state, though.
Okay and your defense for this very awkward rambling point that Biden was trying to make?
Never trumpets are always in on the take.    Just like joe Biden.
I love that they show events from Trump's America and say this is what Biden's America would look like.   I mean, projection is a thing but this is absurd.
